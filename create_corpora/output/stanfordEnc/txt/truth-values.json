Although it\nwas Frege who made the notion of a truth value to one of the central\nconcepts of semantics, the idea of special semantical values, however,\nwas anticipated by Boole and Peirce already, see the survey article on\na “history of truth values” by Béziau (2012).\nAccording to Kneale and Kneale (1962: 413), Boole’s system\ncontains all that is needed for its interpretation “in terms of\ntruth values of propositions”, and as Church (1956: 17) remarks,\nthe “explicit use of two truth-values appears for the first time\nin a paper by C.S. Peirce in the American Journal of\nMathematics, vol. 7 (1885), pp. 180–202”. Frege\nconceived this notion as a natural component of his language analysis\nwhere sentences, being saturated expressions, are interpreted as a\nspecial kind of names, which refer to (denote, designate, signify) a\nspecial kind of objects: truth values. Moreover, there are, according\nto Frege, only two such objects: the True (das\nWahre) and the False (das Falsche):\n\n\nEvery assertoric sentence … is to be regarded as a proper name,\nand its Bedeutung, if it has one, is either the True or the\nFalse. (Frege 1892, trans. Beaney 1997: 158)\n\n\n\nThis new and revolutionary idea has had a far reaching and manifold\nimpact on the development of modern logic. It provides the means to\nuniformly complete the formal apparatus of a functional analysis of\nlanguage by generalizing the concept of a function and introducing a\nspecial kind of functions, namely propositional functions, or truth\nvalue functions, whose range of values consists of the set of truth\nvalues. Among the most typical representatives of propositional\nfunctions one finds predicate expressions and logical connectives. As\na result, one obtains a powerful tool for a conclusive implementation\nof the extensionality principle (also called the principle of\ncompositionality), according to which the meaning of a complex\nexpression is uniquely determined by the meanings of its components.\nOn this basis one can also discriminate between extensional and\nintensional contexts and advance further to the conception of\nintensional logics. Moreover, the idea of truth values has induced a\nradical rethinking of some central issues in the philosophy of logic,\nincluding: the categorial status of truth, the theory of abstract\nobjects, the subject-matter of logic and its ontological foundations,\nthe concept of a logical system, the nature of logical notions,\netc.\n\n\nIn the following, several important philosophical problems directly\nconnected to the notion of a truth value are considered and various\nuses of this notion are explained.\n\n\nThe approach to language analysis developed by Frege rests essentially\non the idea of a strict discrimination between two main kinds of\nexpressions: proper names (singular terms) and functional\nexpressions. Proper names designate (signify, denote, or refer to)\nsingular objects, and functional expressions designate (signify,\ndenote, or refer to) functions. [Note: In the literature, the\nexpressions ‘designation’, ‘signification’,\n‘denotation’, and ‘reference’ are usually\ntaken to be synonymous. This practice is used throughout the present\nentry.] The name ‘Ukraine’, for example, refers to a\ncertain country, and the expression ‘the capital of’\ndenotes a one-place function from countries to cities, in particular,\na function that maps Ukraine to Kyiv (Kiev). Whereas names are\n“saturated” (complete) expressions, functional expressions\nare “unsaturated” (incomplete) and may be saturated by\napplying them to names, producing in this way new names. Similarly,\nthe objects to which singular terms refer are saturated and the\nfunctions denoted by functional expression are unsaturated. Names to\nwhich a functional expression can be applied are called\nthe arguments of this functional expression, and entities to\nwhich a function can be applied are called the arguments of\nthis function. The object which serves as the reference for the name\ngenerated by an application of a functional expression to its\narguments is called the value of the function for these\narguments. Particularly, the above mentioned functional expression\n‘the capital of’ remains incomplete until applied to some\nname. An application of the function denoted by ‘the capital\nof’ to Ukraine (as an argument) returns Kyiv as the object\ndenoted by the compound expression ‘the capital of\nUkraine’ which, according to Frege, is a proper name of\nKyiv. Note that Frege distinguishes between an \\(n\\)-place function\n\\(f\\) as an unsaturated entity that can be completed by and applied to\narguments \\(a_1\\),…, \\(a_n\\) and its course of values,\nwhich can be seen as the set-theoretic representation of this\nfunction: the set \nPursuing this kind of analysis, one is very quickly confronted with\ntwo intricate problems. First, how should one treat\ndeclarative sentences? Should one perhaps separate them into\na specific linguistic category distinct from the ones of names and\nfunction symbols? And second, how—from a functional\npoint of view—should one deal with predicate\nexpressions such as ‘is a city’, ‘is\ntall’, ‘runs’, ‘is bigger than’,\n‘loves’, etc., which are used to denote classes of\nobjects, properties of objects, or relations between them and which\ncan be combined with (applied to) singular terms to obtain sentences?\nIf one considers predicates to be a kind of functional expressions,\nwhat sort of names are generated by applying predicates to their\narguments, and what can serve as referents of these names,\nrespectively values of these functions? \nA uniform solution of both problems is obtained by introducing the\nnotion of a truth value. Namely, by applying the criterion of\n“saturatedness” Frege provides a negative answer to the\nfirst of the above problems. Since sentences are a kind of complete\nentities, they should be treated as a sort of proper names, but names\ndestined to denote some specific objects, namely the truth values:\nthe True and the False. In this way one also obtains\na solution of the second problem. Predicates are to be interpreted as\nsome kind of functional expressions, which being applied to these or\nthose names generate sentences referring to one of the two truth\nvalues. For example, if the predicate ‘is a city’ is\napplied to the name ‘Kyiv’, one gets the sentence\n‘Kyiv is a city’, which designates the True\n(i.e., ‘Kyiv is a city’ is true). On the other\nhand, by using the name ‘Mount Everest’, one obtains the\nsentence ‘Mount Everest is a city’ which clearly\ndesignates the False, since ‘Mount Everest is a\ncity’ is false. \nFunctions whose values are truth values are called propositional\nfunctions. Frege also referred to them as concepts\n(Begriffe). A typical kind of such functions (besides the\nones denoted by predicates) are the functions denoted by propositional\nconnectives. Negation, for example, can be interpreted as a unary\nfunction converting the True into the False and\nvice versa, and conjunction is a binary function that returns\nthe True as a value when both its argument positions are\nfilled in by the True, etc. Propositional functions mapping\n\\(n\\)-tuples of truth values into truth values are also called\ntruth-value functions. \nFrege thus in a first step extended the familiar notion of a numerical\nfunction to functions on singular objects in general and, moreover,\nintroduced a new kind of singular objects that can serve as arguments\nand values of functions on singular objects, the truth values. In a\nfurther step, he considered propositional functions taking functions\nas their arguments. The quantifier phrase ‘every city’,\nfor example, can be applied to the predicate ‘is a\ncapital’ to produce a sentence. The argument of the\nsecond-order function denoted by ‘every city’ is\nthe first-order propositional function on singular objects\ndenoted by ‘is a capital’. The functional value denoted by\nthe sentence ‘Every city is a capital’ is a truth value,\nthe False. \nTruth values thus prove to be an extremely effective instrument for a\nlogical and semantical analysis of \n language.[1]\n Moreover, Frege provides\ntruth values (as proper referents of sentences) not merely with a\npragmatical motivation but also with a strong theoretical\njustification. The idea of such justification, that can be found in\nFrege 1892, employs the principle of substitutivity of\nco-referential terms, according to which the reference of a complex\nsingular term must remain unchanged when any of its sub-terms is\nreplaced by an expression having the same reference. This is actually\njust an instance of the compositionality principle mentioned above. If\nsentences are treated as a kind of singular terms which must have\ndesignations, then assuming the principle of substitutivity one\n“almost inevitably” (as Kurt Gödel (1944: 129)\nexplains) is forced to recognize truth values as the most suitable\nentities for such designations. Accordingly, Frege asks: \nWhat else but the truth value could be found, that belongs quite\ngenerally to every sentence if the reference of its components is\nrelevant, and remains unchanged by substitutions of the kind in\nquestion? (Geach and Black 1952: 64)  \nThe idea underlying this question has been neatly reconstructed by\nAlonzo Church in his Introduction to Mathematical Logic\n(1956: 24–25) by considering the following sequence of four\nsentences: \nC1–C4 present a number of conversion steps each producing\nco-referential sentences. It is claimed that C1 and C2 must have the\nsame designation by substitutivity, for the terms ‘the author of\nWaverley’ and ‘the man who wrote 29\nWaverley Novels altogether’ designate one and the same\nobject, namely Walter Scott. And so must C3 and C4, because the\nnumber, such that Sir Walter Scott is the man who wrote that many\nWaverley Novels altogether is the same as the number of\ncounties in Utah, namely 29. Next, Church argues, it is plausible to\nsuppose that C2, even if not completely synonymous with C3, is at\nleast so close to C3 “so as to ensure its having the same\ndenotation”. If this is indeed the case, then C1 and C4 must\nhave the same denotation (designation) as well. But it seems that the\nonly (semantically relevant) thing these sentences have in common is\nthat both are true. Thus, taken that there must be something what the\nsentences designate, one concludes that it is just their truth value.\nAs Church remarks, a parallel example involving false sentences can be\nconstructed in the same way (by considering, e.g., ‘Sir Walter\nScott is not the author of Waverley’). \nThis line of reasoning is now widely known as the “slingshot\nargument”, a term coined by Jon Barwise and John Perry (in\nBarwise and Perry 1981: 395), who stressed thus an extraordinary\nsimplicity of the argument and the minimality of presuppositions\ninvolved. Stated generally, the pattern of the argument goes as\nfollows (cf. Perry 1996). One starts with a certain sentence, and then\nmoves, step by step, to a completely different sentence. Every two\nsentences in any step designate presumably one and the same thing.\nHence, the starting and the concluding sentences of the argument must\nhave the same designation as well. But the only semantically\nsignificant thing they have in common seems to be their truth value.\nThus, what any sentence designates is just its truth value. \nA formal version of this argument, employing the term-forming,\nvariable-binding class abstraction (or property abstraction) operator\nλ\\(x\\) (“the class of all \\(x\\) such that” or\n“the property of being such an \\(x\\) that”), was first\nformulated by Church (1943) in his review of Carnap’s\nIntroduction to Semantics. Quine (1953), too, presents a\nvariant of the slingshot using class abstraction, see also (Shramko\nand Wansing 2009a). Other remarkable variations of the argument are\nthose by Kurt Gödel (1944) and Donald Davidson (1967, 1969),\nwhich make use of the formal apparatus of a theory of definite\ndescriptions dealing with the description-forming, variable-binding\niota-operator (ι\\(x\\), “the \\(x\\) such that”). It is\nworth noticing that the formal versions of the slingshot show how to\nmove—using steps that ultimately preserve reference—from\nany true (false) sentence to any other such\nsentence. In view of this result, it is hard to avoid the conclusion\nthat what the sentences refer to are just truth values. \nThe slingshot argument has been analyzed in detail by many authors\n(see especially the comprehensive study by Stephen Neale (Neale 2001)\nand references therein) and has caused much controversy notably on the\npart of fact-theorists, i.e., adherents of facts, situations,\npropositions, states of affairs, and other fact-like entities\nconceived as alternative candidates for denotations of declarative\nsentences. Also see the\n supplement on the slingshot argument. \nTruth values evidently have something to do with a general concept of\ntruth. Therefore it may seem rather tempting to try to incorporate\nconsiderations on truth values into the broader context of traditional\ntruth-theories, such as correspondence, coherence, anti-realistic, or\npragmatist conceptions of truth. Yet, it is unlikely that such\nattempts can give rise to any considerable success. Indeed, the\nimmense fruitfulness of Frege’s introduction of truth values\ninto logic to a large extent is just due to its philosophical\nneutrality with respect to theories of truth. It does not commit one\nto any specific metaphysical doctrine of truth. In one significant\nrespect, however, the idea of truth values contravenes traditional\napproaches to truth by bringing to the forefront the problem of its\ncategorial classification. \nIn most of the established conceptions, truth is usually treated as a\nproperty. It is customary to talk about a “truth\npredicate” and its attribution to sentences, propositions,\nbeliefs or the like. Such an understanding corresponds also to a\nroutine linguistic practice, when one operates with the adjective\n‘true’ and asserts, e.g., ‘That 5 is a prime number\nis true’. By contrast with this apparently quite natural\nattitude, the suggestion to interpret truth as an object may seem very\nconfusing, to say the least. Nevertheless this suggestion is also\nequipped with a profound and strong motivation demonstrating that it\nis far from being just an oddity and has to be taken seriously (cf.\nBurge 1986). \nFirst, it should be noted that the view of truth as a property is not\nas natural as it appears on the face of it. Frege brought into play an\nargument to the effect that characterizing a sentence as true\nadds nothing new to its content, for ‘It is true that 5 is a\nprime number’ says exactly the same as just ‘5 is a prime\nnumber’. That is, the adjective ‘true’ is in a sense\nredundant and thus is not a real predicate expressing a real\nproperty such as the predicates ‘white’ or\n‘prime’ which, on the contrary, cannot simply be\neliminated from a sentence without an essential loss for its content.\nIn this case a superficial grammatical analogy is misleading. This\nidea gave an impetus to the deflationary conception of truth\n(advocated by Ramsey, Ayer, Quine, Horwich, and others, see the entry\non\n the deflationary theory of truth). \nHowever, even admitting the redundancy of truth as a property, Frege\nemphasizes its importance and indispensable role in some other\nrespect. Namely, truth, accompanying every act of judgment as its\nultimate goal, secures an objective value of cognition by\narranging for every assertive sentence a transition from the level of\nsense (the thought expressed by a sentence) to the level of denotation\n(its truth value). This circumstance specifies the significance of\ntaking truth as a particular object. As Tyler Burge explains: \nNormally, the point of using sentences, what “matters to\nus”, is to claim truth for a thought. The object, in the sense\nof the point or objective, of sentence use was truth. It is\nilluminating therefore to see truth as an object. (Burge 1986: 120)\n \nAs it has been observed repeatedly in the literature (cf., e.g., Burge\n1986, Ruffino 2003), the stress Frege laid on the notion of a truth\nvalue was, to a great extent, pragmatically motivated. Besides an\nintended gain for his system of “Basic Laws” (Frege\n1893/1903) reflected in enhanced technical clarity, simplicity, and\nunity, Frege also sought to substantiate in this way his view on logic\nas a theoretical discipline with truth as its main goal and primary\nsubject-matter. Incidentally, Gottfried Gabriel (1986) demonstrated\nthat in the latter respect Frege’s ideas can be naturally linked\nup with a value-theoretical tradition in German philosophy of the\nsecond half of the 19th century; see also (Gabriel 2013) on\nthe relation between Frege’s value-theoretically inspired\nconception of truth values and his theory of judgement. More\nspecifically, Wilhelm Windelband, the founder and the principal\nrepresentative of the Southwest school of Neo-Kantianism, was actually\nthe first who employed the term “truth value”\n(“Wahrheitswert”) in his essay “What is\nPhilosophy?” published in 1882 (see Windelband 1915: 32), i.e.,\nnine years before Frege 1891, even if he was very far from treating a\ntruth value as a value of a function. \nWindelband defined philosophy as a “critical science about\nuniversal values”. He considered philosophical statements to be\nnot mere judgements but rather assessments, dealing with some\nfundamental values, the value of truth being one of the most\nimportant among them. This latter value is to be studied by logic as a\nspecial philosophical discipline. Thus, from a value-theoretical\nstandpoint, the main task of philosophy, taken generally, is to\nestablish the principles of logical, ethical and aesthetical\nassessments, and Windelband accordingly highlighted the triad of basic\nvalues: “true”, “good” and\n“beautiful”. Later this triad was taken up by Frege in\n1918 when he defined the subject-matter of logic (see below). Gabriel\npoints out (1984: 374) that this connection between logic and a value\ntheory can be traced back to Hermann Lotze, whose seminars in\nGöttingen were attended by both Windelband and Frege. \nThe decisive move made by Frege was to bring together a philosophical\nand a mathematical understanding of values on the basis of a\ngeneralization of the notion of a function on numbers. While Frege may\nhave been inspired by Windelband’s use of the word\n‘value’ (and even more concretely – ‘truth\nvalue’), it is clear that he uses the word in its mathematical\nsense. If predicates are construed as a kind of functional expressions\nwhich, being applied to singular terms as arguments, produce\nsentences, then the values of the corresponding functions must be\nreferences of sentences. Taking into account that the range of any\nfunction typically consists of objects, it is natural to conclude that\nreferences of sentences must be objects as well. And if one now just\ntakes it that sentences refer to truth values (the True and\nthe False), then it turns out that truth values are indeed\nobjects, and it seems quite reasonable to generally explicate truth\nand falsity as objects and not as properties. As Frege explains: \nA statement contains no empty place, and therefore we must take its\nBedeutung as an object. But this Bedeutung is a\ntruth-value. Thus the two truth-values are objects. (Frege 1891,\ntrans. Beaney 1997: 140)  \nFrege’s theory of sentences as names of truth values has been\ncriticized, for example, by Michael Dummett who stated rather\ndramatically: \nThis was the most disastrous of the effects of the misbegotten\ndoctrine that sentences are a species of complex singular terms, which\ndominated Frege’s later period: to rob him of the insight that\nsentences play a unique role, and that the role of almost every other\nlinguistic expression … consists in its part in forming\nsentences. (Dummett 1981: 196)  \nBut even Dummett (1991: 242) concedes that “to deny that\ntruth-values are objects … seems a weak response”. \nIf truth values are accepted and taken seriously as a special kind of\nobjects, the obvious question as to the nature of these entities\narises. The above characterization of truth values as objects is far\ntoo general and requires further specification. One way of such\nspecification is to qualify truth values as abstract objects.\nNote that Frege himself never used the word ‘abstract’\nwhen describing truth values. Instead, he has a conception of so\ncalled “logical objects”, truth values being primary and\nthe most fundamental of them (Frege 1976: 121). Among the other\nlogical objects Frege pays particular attention to are sets and\nnumbers, emphasizing thus their logical nature (in accordance with his\nlogicist view). \nChurch (1956: 25), when considering truth values, explicitly\nattributes to them the property of being abstract. Since then it is\ncustomary to label truth values as abstract objects, thus allocating\nthem into the same category of entities as mathematical objects\n(numbers, classes, geometrical figures) and propositions. One may pose\nhere an interesting question about the correlation between Fregean\nlogical objects and abstract objects in the modern sense (see the\nentry on\n abstract objects).  \nObviously, the universe of abstract objects is much broader than the\nuniverse of logical objects as Frege conceives them. The latter are\nconstrued as constituting an ontological foundation for logic, and\nhence for mathematics (pursuant to Frege’s logicist program).\nGenerally, the class of abstracta includes a wide diversity\nof platonic universals (such as redness, youngness, justice or\ntriangularity) and not only those of them which are logically\nnecessary. Nevertheless, it may safely be said that logical objects\ncan be considered as paradigmatic cases of abstract entities, or\nabstract objects in their purest form. \nIt should be noted that finding an adequate definition of abstract\nobjects is a matter of considerable controversy. According to a common\nview, abstract entities lack spatio-temporal properties and relations,\nas opposed to concrete objects which exist in space and time (Lowe\n1995: 515). In this respect truth values obviously are\nabstract as they clearly have nothing to do with physical spacetime.\nIn a similar fashion truth values fulfill another requirement often\nimposed upon abstract objects, namely the one of a causal inefficacy\n(see, e.g., Grossmann 1992: 7). Here again, truth values are very much\nlike numbers and geometrical figures: they have no causal power and\nmake nothing happen. \nFinally, it is of interest to consider how truth values can be\nintroduced by applying so-called abstraction principles,\nwhich are used for supplying abstract objects with criteria of\nidentity. The idea of this method of characterizing abstract\nobjects is also largely due to Frege, who wrote: \nIf the symbol a is to designate an object for us, then we must\nhave a criterion that decides in all cases whether b is the\nsame as a, even if it is not always in our power to apply this\ncriterion. (Frege 1884, trans. Beaney 1997: 109)  \nMore precisely, one obtains a new object by abstracting it from some\ngiven kind of entities, in virtue of certain criteria of identity for\nthis new (abstract) object. This abstraction is performed in terms of\nan equivalence relation defined on the given entities (see Wrigley\n2006: 161). The celebrated slogan by Quine (1969: 23) “No entity\nwithout identity” is intended to express essentially the same\nunderstanding of an (abstract) object as an “item falling under\na sortal concept which supplies a well-defined criterion of identity\nfor its instances” (Lowe 1997: 619). \nFor truth values such a criterion has been suggested in Anderson and\nZalta (2004: 2), stating that for any two sentences \\(p\\) and \\(q\\),\nthe truth value of \\(p\\) is identical with the truth value of \\(q\\) if\nand only if \\(p\\) is (non-logically) equivalent with \\(q\\) (cf. also\nDummett 1959: 141). This idea can be formally explicated following the\nstyle of presentation in Lowe (1997: 620): \nwhere &, \\(\\Rightarrow, \\Leftrightarrow, \\forall\\) stand\ncorrespondingly for ‘and’, ‘if… then’,\n‘if and only if’ and ‘for all’ in the\nmetalanguage, and \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) stands for some\nobject language equivalence connective (biconditional). \nIncidentally, Carnap (1947: 26), when introducing truth-values as\nextensions of sentences, is guided by essentially the same idea.\nNamely, he points out a strong analogy between extensions of\npredicators and truth values of sentences. Carnap considers a wide\nclass of designating expressions (“designators”) among\nwhich there are predicate expressions (“predicators”),\nfunctional expressions (“functors”), and some others.\nApplying the well-known technique of interpreting sentences as\npredicators of degree 0, he generalizes the fact that two predicators\nof degree \\(n\\) (say, \\(P\\) and \\(Q)\\) have the same extension if and\nonly if \\(\\forall x_1\\forall x_2 \\ldots \\forall x_n(Px_1 x_2\\ldots x_n\n\\leftrightarrow Qx_1 x_2\\ldots x_n)\\) holds. Then, analogously, two\nsentences (say, \\(p\\) and \\(q)\\), being interpreted as predicators of\ndegree 0, must have the same extension if and only if\n\\(p\\leftrightarrow q\\) holds, that is if and only if they are\nequivalent. And then, Carnap remarks, it seems quite natural to take\ntruth values as extensions for sentences. \nNote that this criterion employs a functional dependency\nbetween an introduced abstract object (in this case a truth value) and\nsome other objects (sentences). More specifically, what is considered\nis the truth value of a sentence (or proposition, or the like).\nThe criterion of identity for truth values is formulated then through\nthe logical relation of equivalence holding between these other\nobjects—sentences, propositions, or the like (with an explicit\nquantification over them). \nIt should also be remarked that the properties of the object language\nbiconditional depend on the logical system in which the biconditional\nis employed. Biconditionals of different logics may have different\nlogical properties, and it surely matters what kind of the equivalence\nconnective is used for defining truth values. This means that the\nconcept of a truth value introduced by means of the identity criterion\nthat involves a biconditional between sentences is also\nlogic-relative. Thus, if ‘\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)’ stands for\nmaterial equivalence, one obtains classical truth values, but if the\nintuitionistic biconditional is employed, one gets truth values of\nintuitionistic logic, etc. Taking into account the role truth values\nplay in logic, such an outcome seems to be not at all unnatural. \nAnderson and Zalta (2004: 13), making use of an object theory from\nZalta (1983), propose the following definition of ‘the truth\nvalue of proposition \\(p\\)’ (‘\\(tv(p)\\)’ [notation\nadjusted]): \nwhere \\(A\\)! stands for a primitive theoretical predicate ‘being\nabstract’, \\(xF\\) is to be read as “\\(x\\) encodes\n\\(F\\)” and [λy q] is a propositional\nproperty (“being such a \\(y\\) that \\(q\\)”). That is,\naccording to this definition, “the extension of \\(p\\) is the\nabstract object that encodes all and only the properties of the form\n[λy q] which are constructed out of\npropositions \\(q\\) materially equivalent to \\(p\\)” (Anderson and\nZalta 2004: 14). \nThe notion of a truth value in general is then defined as an object\nwhich is the truth value of some proposition: \nUsing this apparatus, it is possible to explicitly define the Fregean\ntruth values the True \\((\\top)\\) and the False\n\\((\\bot)\\): \nAnderson and Zalta prove then that \\(\\top\\) and \\(\\bot\\) are indeed\ntruth values and, moreover, that there are exactly two such objects.\nThe latter result is expected, if one bears in mind that what the\ndefinitions above actually introduce are the classical truth\nvalues (as the underlying logic is classical). Indeed,\n\\(p\\leftrightarrow q\\) is classically equivalent to \\((p\\wedge\nq)\\vee(\\neg p\\wedge \\neg q)\\), and \\(\\neg(p\\leftrightarrow q)\\) is\nclassically equivalent to \\((p\\wedge \\neg q)\\vee(\\neg p\\wedge q)\\).\nThat is, the connective of material equivalence divides sentences into\ntwo distinct collections. Due to the law of excluded middle these\ncollections are exhaustive, and by virtue of the law of\nnon-contradiction they are exclusive. Thus, we get exactly two\nequivalence classes of sentences, each being a hypostatized\nrepresentative of one of two classical truth values. \nIn a late paper Frege (1918) claims that the word ‘true’\ndetermines the subject-matter of logic in exactly the same way as the\nword ‘beautiful’ does for aesthetics and the word\n‘good’ for ethics. Thus, according to such a view, the\nproper task of logic consists, ultimately, in investigating “the\nlaws of being true” (Sluga 2002: 86). By doing so, logic is\ninterested in truth as such, understood objectively, and not in what\nis merely taken to be true. Now, if one admits that truth is a\nspecific abstract object (the corresponding truth value), then logic\nin the first place has to explore the features of this object and its\ninterrelations to other entities of various other kinds. \nA prominent adherent of this conception was Jan Łukasiewicz. As\nhe paradigmatically put it: \nAll true propositions denote one and the same object, namely truth,\nand all false propositions denote one and the same object, namely\nfalsehood. I consider truth and falsehood to be singular\nobjects in the same sense as the number 2 or 4 is. …\nOntologically, truth has its analogue in being, and falsehood, in\nnon-being. The objects denoted by propositions are called logical\nvalues. Truth is the positive, and falsehood is the negative\nlogical value. … Logic is the science of objects of a special\nkind, namely a science of logical values. (Łukasiewicz\n1970: 90)  \nThis definition may seem rather unconventional, for logic is usually\ntreated as the science of correct reasoning and valid inference. The\nlatter understanding, however, calls for further justification. This\nbecomes evident, as soon as one asks, on what grounds one\nshould qualify this or that pattern of reasoning as correct or\nincorrect. \nIn answering this question, one has to take into account that any\nvalid inference should be based on logical rules which, according to a\ncommonly accepted view, should at least guarantee that in a valid\ninference the conclusion(s) is (are) true if all the premises are\ntrue. Translating this demand into the Fregean terminology, it would\nmean that in the course of a correct inference the possession of the\ntruth value The True should be preserved from the\npremises to the conclusion(s). Thus, granting the realistic treatment\nof truth values adopted by Frege, the understanding of logic as the\nscience of truth values in fact provides logical rules with an\nontological justification placing the roots of logic in a certain kind\nof ideal entities (see Shramko 2014). \nThese entities constitute a certain uniform domain, which can be\nviewed as a subdomain of Frege’s so-called “third\nrealm” (the realm of the objective content of thoughts, and\ngenerally abstract objects of various kinds, see Frege 1918, cf.\nPopper 1972 and also Burge 1992: 634). Among the subdomains of this\nthird realm one finds, e.g., the collection of mathematical objects\n(numbers, classes, etc.). The set of truth values may be regarded as\nforming another such subdomain, namely the one of logical\nvalues, and logic as a branch of science rests essentially on\nthis logical domain and on exploring its features and\nregularities. \nAccording to Frege, there are exactly two truth values, the\nTrue and the False. This opinion appears to be rather\nrestrictive, and one may ask whether it is really indispensable for\nthe concept of a truth value. One should observe that in elaborating\nthis conception, Frege assumed specific requirements of his system of\nthe Begriffsschrift, especially the principle of bivalence\ntaken as a metatheoretical principle, viz. that there exist only two\ndistinct logical values. On the object-language level this principle\nfinds its expression in the famous classical laws of excluded middle\nand non-contradiction. The further development of modern logic,\nhowever, has clearly demonstrated that classical logic is only one\nparticular theory (although maybe a very distinctive one) among the\nvast variety of logical systems. In fact, the Fregean ontological\ninterpretation of truth values depicts logical principles as a kind of\nontological postulations, and as such they may well be modified or\neven abandoned. For example, by giving up the principle of bivalence,\none is naturally led to the idea of postulating many truth\nvalues. \nIt was Łukasiewicz, who as early as 1918 proposed to take\nseriously other logical values different from truth and falsehood (see\nŁukasiewicz 1918, 1920). Independently of Łukasiewicz, Emil\nPost in his dissertation from 1920, published as Post 1921, introduced\n\\(m\\)-valued truth tables, where \\(m\\) is any positive integer.\nWhereas Post’s interest in many-valued logic (where\n“many” means “more than two”) was almost\nexclusively mathematical, Łukasiewicz’s motivation was\nphilosophical (see the entry on\n many-valued logic).\n He contemplated the semantical value of sentences about the\ncontingent future, as discussed in Aristotle’s De\ninterpretatione. Łukasiewicz introduced a third truth value\nand interpreted it as “possible”. By generalizing this\nidea and also adopting the above understanding of the subject-matter\nof logic, one naturally arrives at the representation of particular\nlogical systems as a certain kind of valuation systems (see,\ne.g., Dummett 1981, 2000; Ryan and Sadler 1992). \nConsider a propositional language \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) built upon a set of\natomic sentences \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) and a set of propositional\nconnectives \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) (the set of sentences of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\)\nbeing the smallest set containing \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) and being closed\nunder the connectives from \\(\\mathcal{C})\\). Then a valuation\nsystem \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) for the language \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is a\ntriple \\(\\langle \\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{D}, \\mathcal{F}\\rangle\\), where\n\\(\\mathcal{V}\\) is a non-empty set with at least two elements,\n\\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is a subset of \\(\\mathcal{V}\\), and\n\\(\\mathcal{F} = \\{f_{c _1},\\ldots, f_{c _m}\\}\\) is a set of functions\nsuch that \\(f_{c _i}\\) is an \\(n\\)-place function on \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)\nif \\(c_i\\) is an \\(n\\)-place connective. Intuitively, \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)\nis the set of truth values, \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is the set of\ndesignated truth values, and \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is the set of\ntruth-value functions interpreting the elements of \\(\\mathcal{C}\\). If\nthe set of truth values of a valuation system \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) has \\(n\\)\nelements, \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) is said to be \\(n\\)-valued. Any valuation\nsystem can be equipped with an assignment function which maps the set\nof atomic sentences into \\(\\mathcal{V}\\). Each assignment \\(a\\)\nrelative to a valuation system \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) can be extended to all\nsentences of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) by means of a valuation function \\(v_a\\)\ndefined in accordance with the following conditions: \nIt is interesting to observe that the elements of \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) are\nsometimes referred to as quasi truth values. Siegfried\nGottwald (1989: 2) explains that one reason for using the term\n‘quasi truth value’ is that there is no convincing and\nuniform interpretation of the truth values that in many-valued logic\nare assumed in addition to the classical truth values the\nTrue and the False, an understanding that, according to\nGottwald, associates the additional values with the naive\nunderstanding of being true, respectively the naive understanding of\ndegrees of being true (cf. also the remark by Font (2009:\n383) that “[o]ne of the main problems in many-valued logic, at\nleast in its initial stages, was the interpretation of the\n‘intermediate’ or ‘non-classical’\nvalues”, et seq.). In later publications, Gottwald has changed\nhis terminology and states that  \n[t]o avoid any confusion with the case of classical logic one prefers\nin many-valued logic to speak of truth degrees and to use the\nword “truth value” only for classical logic. (Gottwald\n2001: 4)  \nNevertheless in what follows the term ‘truth values’ will\nbe used even in the context of many-valued logics, without any\ncommitment to a philosophical conception of truth as a graded notion\nor a specific understanding of semantical values in addition to the\nclassical truth values. \nSince the cardinality of \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) may be greater than 2, the\nnotion of a valuation system provides a natural foundational framework\nfor the very idea of a many-valued logic. The set \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) of\ndesignated values is of central importance for the notion of a\nvaluation system. This set can be seen as a generalization of the\nclassical truth value the True in the sense that it\ndetermines many central logical notions and thereby generalizes some\nof the important roles played by Frege’s the True (cf.\nthe introductory remarks about uses of truth values). For example, the\nset of tautologies (logical laws) is directly specified by the given\nset of designated truth values: a sentence \\(A\\) is a\ntautology in a valuation system \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) iff for every\nassignment \\(a\\) relative to \\(\\mathbf{V}\\), \\(v_a(A) \\in\n\\mathcal{D}\\). Another fundamental logical notion—that of an\nentailment relation—can also be defined by referring to the set\n\\(\\mathcal{D}\\). For a given valuation system \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) a\ncorresponding entailment relation \\((\\vDash_V)\\) is usually defined by\npostulating the preservation of designated values from the premises to\nthe conclusion: \nA pair \\(\\mathcal{M} = \\langle \\mathbf{V}, v_a\\rangle\\), where\n\\(\\mathbf{V}\\) is an \\((n\\)-valued) valuation system and \\(v_a\\) a\nvaluation in \\(\\mathbf{V}\\), may be called an \\((n\\)-valued)\nmodel based on \\(\\mathbf{V}\\). Every model \\(\\mathcal{M} =\n\\langle \\mathbf{V}, v_a\\rangle\\) comes with a corresponding entailment\nrelation \\(\\vDash_{\\mathcal{M}}\\) by defining\n\\(Δ\\vDash_{\\mathcal{M} }A\\textrm{ iff }(\\forall B \\in Δ:\nv_a (B) \\in \\mathcal{D}) \\Rightarrow v_a(A) \\in \\mathcal{D}\\). \nSuppose \\(\\mathfrak{L}\\) is a syntactically defined logical system\n\\(\\mathfrak{L}\\) with a consequence relation \\(\\vdash_{ \\mathfrak{L}\n}\\), specified as a relation between the power-set of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\)\nand \\(\\mathcal{L}\\). Then a valuational system \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) is said\nto be strictly characteristic for \\(\\mathfrak{L}\\) just in\ncase \\(Δ\\vDash_V A \\textrm{ iff } Δ\\vdash_{ \\mathfrak{L}\n}A\\) (see Dummett 1981: 431). Conversely, one says that\n\\(\\mathfrak{L}\\) is characterized by \\(\\mathbf{V}\\). Thus, if\na valuation system is said to determine a logic, the\nvaluation system by itself is, properly speaking,\nnot a logic, but only serves as a semantic basis for some\nlogical system. Valuation systems are often referred to as\n(logical) matrices. Note that in Urquhart 1986, the\nset \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) of designated elements of a matrix is required to\nbe non-empty, and in Dunn & Hardegree 2001, \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is\nrequired to be a non-empty proper subset of \\(\\mathbf{V}\\). With a\nview on semantically defining a many-valued logic, these restrictions\nare very natural and have been taken up in Shramko & Wansing 2011\nand elsewhere. For the characterization of consequence relations (see\nthe supplementary document\n Suszko’s Thesis), however, the restrictions do not apply.   \nIn this way Fregean, i.e., classical, logic can be presented as\ndetermined by a particular valuation system based on exactly two\nelements: \\(\\mathbf{V}_{cl} = \\langle \\{T, F\\}, \\{T\\}, \\{ f_{\\wedge},\nf_{\\vee}, f_{\\rightarrow}, f_{\\sim}\\}\\rangle\\), where \\(f_{\\wedge},\nf_{\\vee}, f_{\\rightarrow},f_{\\sim}\\) are given by the classical truth\ntables for conjunction, disjunction, material implication, and\nnegation. \nAs an example for a valuation system based on more that two elements,\nconsider two well-known valuation systems which determine\nKleene’s (strong) “logic of indeterminacy” \\(K_3\\)\nand Priest’s “logic of paradox” \\(P_3\\). In a\npropositional language without implication, \\(K_3\\) is specified by\nthe Kleene matrix \\(\\mathbf{K}_3 = \\langle \\{T, I, F\\},\n\\{T\\}, \\{ f_c: c \\in \\{\\sim , \\wedge , \\vee \\}\\} \\rangle\\), where the\nfunctions \\(f_c\\) are defined as follows: \nThe Priest matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}_3\\) differs from\n\\(\\mathbf{K}_3\\) only in that \\(\\mathcal{D} = \\{T, I\\}\\). Entailment\nin \\(\\mathbf{K}_3\\) as well as in \\(\\mathbf{P}_3\\) is defined by means\nof\n (3). \nThere are natural intuitive interpretations of \\(I\\) in\n\\(\\mathbf{K}_3\\) and in \\(\\mathbf{P}_3\\) as the\nunderdetermined and the overdetermined value\nrespectively—a truth-value gap and a truth-value glut. Formally\nthese interpretations can be modeled by presenting the values as\ncertain subsets of the set of classical truth values \\(\\{T, F\\}\\).\nThen \\(T\\) turns into \\(\\mathbf{T} = \\{T\\}\\) (understood as\n“true only”), \\(F\\) into \\(\\mathbf{F} = \\{F\\}\\)\n(“false only”), \\(I\\) is interpreted in \\(K_3\\) as\n\\(\\mathbf{N} = \\{\\} = \\varnothing\\) (“neither true nor\nfalse”), and in \\(P_3\\) as \\(\\mathbf{B} = \\{T, F\\}\\)\n(“both true and false”). (Note that also Asenjo\n(1966) considers the same truth-tables with an interpretation of the\nthird value as “antinomic”.) The designatedness of a truth\nvalue can be understood in both cases as containment of the classical\n\\(T\\) as a member. \nIf one combines all these new values into a joint framework, one\nobtains the four-valued logic \\(B_4\\) introduced by Dunn and Belnap\n(Dunn 1976; Belnap 1977a,b). A Gentzen-style formulation can be found\nin Font (1997: 7)). This logic is determined by the Belnap\nmatrix \\(\\mathbf{B}_4 = \\langle \\{\\mathbf{N}, \\mathbf{T},\n\\mathbf{F}, \\mathbf{B}\\}, \\{\\mathbf{T}, \\mathbf{B}\\}, \\{ f_c: c \\in\n\\{\\sim , \\wedge , \\vee \\}\\}\\rangle\\), where the functions \\(f_c\\) are\ndefined as follows: \nDefinition (3) applied to the Belnap matrix\n determines the entailment relation of \\(\\mathbf{B}_4\\). This\n entailment relation is formalized as the well-known logic of\n “first-degree entailment” (\\(E_{fde}\\)) introduced in\n Anderson & Belnap 1975 (see also Omori and Wansing 2017). \nThe syntactic notion of a single-conclusion consequence relation has\nbeen extensively studied by representatives of the Polish school of\nlogic, most notably by Alfred Tarski, who in fact initiated this line\nof research (see Tarski 1930a,b; cf. also Wójcicki 1988). In\nview of certain key features of a standard consequence relation it is\nquite remarkable—as well as important—that any entailment\nrelation \\(\\vDash_V\\) defined as above has the following structural\nproperties (see Ryan and Sadler 1992: 34): \nMoreover, for every \\(A \\in \\mathcal{L}\\), every \\(Δ \\subseteq\n\\mathcal{L}\\), and every uniform substitution function \\(σ\\) on\n\\(\\mathcal{L}\\) the following Substitution property holds\n(\\(σ(Δ)\\) stands for \\(\\{ σ(B) \\mid B \\in\nΔ\\})\\): \n(The function of uniform substitution \\(σ\\) is defined as follows.\nLet \\(B\\) be a formula in \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), let \\(p_1,\\ldots, p_n\\) be\nall the propositional variables occurring in \\(B\\), and let\n\\(σ(p_1) = A_1,\\ldots , σ(p_n) = A_n\\) for some formulas\n\\(A_1 ,\\ldots ,A_n\\). Then \\(σ(B)\\) is the formula that results\nfrom B by substituting simultaneously \\(A_1\\),…, \\(A_n\\) for\nall occurrences of \\(p_1,\\ldots, p_n\\), respectively.) \nIf \\(\\vDash_V\\) in the conditions\n (4)–(6)\n is replaced by \\(\\vdash_{ \\mathfrak{L} }\\), then one obtains what is\noften called a Tarskian consequence relation. If additionally\na consequence relation has the substitution property\n (7),\n then it is called structural. Thus, any entailment relation\ndefined for a given valuation system \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) presents an\nimportant example of a consequence relation, in that \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) is\nstrictly characteristic for some logical system \\(\\mathfrak{L}\\) with\na structural Tarskian consequence relation. \nGenerally speaking, the framework of valuation systems not only\nperfectly suits the conception of logic as the science of truth\nvalues, but also turns out to be an effective technical tool for\nresolving various sophisticated and important problems in modern\nlogic, such as soundness, completeness, independence of axioms,\netc. \nThe term ‘truth degrees’, used by Gottwald and many other\nauthors, suggests that truth comes by degrees, and these degrees may\nbe seen as truth values in an extended sense. The idea of truth as a\ngraded notion has been applied to model vague predicates and to obtain\na solution to the Sorites Paradox, the Paradox of the Heap (see the\nentry on the\n Sorites Paradox).\n However, the success of applying many-valued logic to the problem of\nvagueness is highly controversial. Timothy Williamson (1994: 97), for\nexample, holds that the phenomenon of higher-order vagueness\n“makes most work on many-valued logic irrelevant to the problem\nof vagueness”. \nIn any case, the vagueness of concepts has been much debated in\nphilosophy (see the entry on\n vagueness)\n and it was one of the major motivations for the development of\nfuzzy logic (see the entry on\n fuzzy logic).\n In the 1960s, Lotfi Zadeh (1965) introduced the notion of a fuzzy\nset. A characteristic function of a set \\(X\\) is a mapping which\nis defined on a superset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) and which indicates membership\nof an element in \\(X\\). The range of the characteristic function of a\nclassical set \\(X\\) is the two-element set \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) (which may be\nseen as the set of classical truth values). The function assigns the\nvalue 1 to elements of \\(X\\) and the value 0 to all elements of \\(Y\\)\nnot in \\(X\\). A fuzzy set has a membership function ranging over the\nreal interval [0,1]. A vague predicate such as ‘is much earlier\nthan March 20th, 1963’, ‘is beautiful’,\nor ‘is a heap’ may then be regarded as denoting a fuzzy\nset. The membership function \\(g\\) of the fuzzy set denoted by\n‘is much earlier than March 20th, 1963’ thus\nassigns values (seen as truth degrees) from the interval [0, 1] to\nmoments in time, for example \\(g\\)(1p.m., August 1st, 2006)\n\\(= 0\\), \\(g\\)(3a.m., March 19th, 1963) \\(= 0\\),\n\\(g\\)(9:16a.m., April 9th, 1960) \\(= 0.005\\), \\(g\\)(2p.m.,\nAugust 13th, 1943) \\(= 0.05\\), \\(g\\)(7:02a.m., December\n2nd, 1278) \\(= 1\\). \nThe application of continuum-valued logics to the Sorites Paradox has\nbeen suggested by Joseph Goguen (1969). The Sorites Paradox in its\nso-called conditional form is obtained by repeatedly applying\nmodus ponens in arguments such as: \nWhereas it seems that all premises are acceptable, because the first\npremise is true and one grain does not make a difference to a\ncollection of grains being a heap or not, the conclusion is, of\ncourse, unacceptable. If the predicate ‘is a heap’ denotes\na fuzzy set and the conditional is interpreted as implication in\nŁukasiewicz’s continuum-valued logic, then the Sorites\nParadox can be avoided. The truth-function \\(f_{\\rightarrow}\\) of\nŁukasiewicz’s implication \\(\\rightarrow\\) is defined by\nstipulating that if \\(x \\le y\\), then \\(f_{\\rightarrow}(x, y) = 1\\),\nand otherwise \\(f_{\\rightarrow}(x, y) = 1 - (x - y)\\). If, say, the\ntruth value of the sentence ‘A collection of 500 grains of sand\nis a heap’ is 0.8 and the truth value of ‘A collection of\n499 grains of sand is a heap’ is 0.7, then the truth value of\nthe implication ‘If a collection of 500 grains of sand is a\nheap, then a collection 499 grains of sand is a heap.’ is 0.9.\nMoreover, if the acceptability of a statement is defined as having a\nvalue greater than \\(j\\) for \\(0 \\lt j \\lt 1\\) and all the conditional\npremises of the Sorites Paradox do not fall below the value \\(j\\),\nthen modus ponens does not preserve acceptability, because\nthe conclusion of the Sorites Argument, being evaluated as 0, is\nunacceptable. \nAlasdair Urquhart (1986: 108) stresses  \nthe extremely artificial nature of the attaching of precise numerical\nvalues to sentences like … “Picasso’s\nGuernica is beautiful”.  \nTo overcome the problem of assigning precise values to predications of\nvague concepts, Zadeh (1975) introduced fuzzy truth values as\ndistinct from the numerical truth values in [0, 1], the former being\nfuzzy subsets of the set [0, 1], understood as true, very\ntrue, not very true, etc. \nThe interpretation of continuum-valued logics in terms of fuzzy set\ntheory has for some time be seen as defining the field of mathematical\nfuzzy logic. Susan Haack (1996) refers to such systems of mathematical\nfuzzy logic as “base logics” of fuzzy logic and reserves\nthe term ‘fuzzy logics’ for systems in which the truth\nvalues themselves are fuzzy sets. Fuzzy logic in Zadeh’s latter\nsense has been thoroughly criticized from a philosophical point of\nview by Haack (1996) for its “methodological\nextravagances” and its linguistic incorrectness. Haack\nemphasizes that her criticisms of fuzzy logic do not apply to the base\nlogics. Moreover, it should be pointed out that mathematical fuzzy\nlogics are nowadays studied not in the first place as continuum-valued\nlogics, but as many-valued logics related to residuated lattices (see\nHajek 1998; Cignoli et al. 2000; Gottwald 2001; Galatos\net al. 2007), whereas fuzzy logic in the broad sense is to a\nlarge extent concerned with certain engineering methods. \nA fundamental concern about the semantical treatment of vague\npredicates is whether an adequate semantics should be\ntruth-functional, that is, whether the truth value of a complex\nformula should depend functionally on the truth values of its\nsubformulas. Whereas mathematical fuzzy logic is truth-functional,\nWilliamson (1994: 97) holds that “the nature of vagueness is not\ncaptured by any approach that generalizes truth-functionality”.\nAccording to Williamson, the degree of truth of a conjunction, a\ndisjunction, or a conditional just fails to be a function of the\ndegrees of truth of vague component sentences. The sentences\n‘John is awake’ and ‘John is asleep’, for\nexample, may have the same degree of truth. By truth-functionality the\nsentences ‘If John is awake, then John is awake’ and\n‘If John is awake, then John is asleep’ are alike in truth\ndegree, indicating for Williamson the failure of\ndegree-functionality. \nOne way of in a certain sense non-truthfunctionally reasoning about\nvagueness is supervaluationism. The method of supervaluations has been\ndeveloped by Henryk Mehlberg (1958) and Bas van Fraassen (1966) and\nhas later been applied to vagueness by Kit Fine (1975), Rosanna Keefe\n(2000) and others. \nVan Fraassen’s aim was to develop a semantics for sentences\ncontaining non-denoting singular terms. Even if one grants atomic\nsentences containing non-denoting singular terms and that some\nattributions of vague predicates are neither true nor false, it\nnevertheless seems natural not to preclude that compound sentences of\na certain shape containing non-denoting terms or vague predications\nare either true or false, e.g., sentences of the form\n‘If \\(A\\), then \\(A\\)’. Supervaluational semantics\nprovides a solution to this problem. A three-valued assignment \\(a\\)\ninto \\(\\{T, I, F\\}\\) may assign a truth-value gap (or rather the value\n\\(I)\\) to the vague sentence ‘Picasso’s Guernica\nis beautiful’. Any classical assignment \\(a'\\) that agrees with\n\\(a\\) whenever \\(a\\) assigns \\(T\\) or \\(F\\) may be seen as a\nprecisification (or superassignment) of \\(a\\). A sentence may than be\nsaid to be supertrue under assignment \\(a\\) if it is true under every\nprecisification \\(a'\\) of \\(a\\). Thus, if \\(a\\) is a three-valued\nassignment into \\(\\{T, I, F\\}\\) and \\(a'\\) is a two-valued assignment\ninto \\(\\{T, F\\}\\) such that \\(a(p) = a'(p)\\) if \\(a(p) \\in \\{T, F\\}\\),\nthen \\(a'\\) is said to be a superassignment of \\(a\\). It\nturns out that if \\(a\\) is an assignment extended to a valuation\nfunction \\(v_a\\) for the Kleene matrix \\(\\mathbf{K}_3\\), then for\nevery formula \\(A\\) in the language of \\(\\mathbf{K}_3\\), \\(v_a (A) =\nv_{a'}(A)\\) if \\(v_a (A) \\in \\{T, F\\}\\). Therefore, the function\n\\(v_{a'}\\) may be called a supervaluation of \\(v_a\\). A\nformula is then said to be supertrue under a valuation\nfunction \\(v_a\\) for \\(\\mathbf{K}_3\\) if it is true under every\nsupervaluation \\(v_{a'}\\) of \\(v_a\\), i.e., if \\(v_{a'}(A) = T\\) for\nevery supervaluation \\(v_{a'}\\) of \\(v_a\\). The property of being\nsuperfalse is defined analogously. \nSince every supervaluation is a classical valuation, every classical\ntautology is supertrue under every valuation function in\n\\(\\mathbf{K}_3\\). Supervaluationism is, however, not truth-functional\nwith respect to supervalues. The supervalue of a disjunction, for\nexample, does not depend on the supervalue of the disjuncts. Suppose\n\\(a(p) = I\\). Then \\(a(\\neg p) = I\\) and \\(v_{a'} (p\\vee \\neg p) = T\\)\nfor every supervaluation \\(v_{a'}\\) of \\(v_a\\). Whereas \\((p\\vee \\neg\np)\\) is thus supertrue under \\(v_a,p\\vee p\\) is not, because\nthere are superassignments \\(a'\\) of \\(a\\) with \\(a'(p) = F\\). An\nargument against the charge that supervaluationism requires a\nnon-truth-functional semantics of the connectives can be found in\nMacFarlane (2008) (cf. also other references given there). \nAlthough the possession of supertruth is preserved from the premises\nto the conclusion(s) of valid inferences in supervaluationism, and\nalthough it might be tempting to consider supertruth an abstract\nobject on its own, it seems that it has never been suggested to\nhypostatize supertruth in this way, comparable to Frege’s\nthe True. A sentence supertrue under a three-valued valuation\n\\(v\\) just takes the Fregean value the True under every\nsupervaluation of \\(v\\). The advice not to confuse supertruth with\n“real truth” can be found in Belnap (2009). \nOne might, perhaps, think that the mere existence of many-valued\nlogics shows that there exist infinitely, in fact, uncountably many\ntruth values. However, this is not at all clear (recall the more\ncautious use of terminology advocated by Gottwald). \nIn the 1970’s Roman Suszko (1977: 377) declared many-valued\nlogic to be “a magnificent conceptual deceit”. Suszko\nactually claimed that “there are but two logical values, true\nand false” (Caleiro et al. 2005: 169), a statement now\ncalled Suszko’s Thesis. For Suszko, the set of truth\nvalues assumed in a logical matrix for a many-valued logic is a set of\n“admissible referents” (called “algebraic\nvalues”) of formulas but not a set of logical values. Whereas\nthe algebraic values are elements of an algebraic structure and\nreferents of formulas, the logical value true is used to\ndefine valid consequence: If every premise is true, then so is (at\nleast one of) the conclusion(s). The other logical value,\nfalse, is preserved in the opposite direction: If the (every)\nconclusion is false, then so is at least one of the premises. The\nlogical values are thus represented by a bi-partition of the set of\nalgebraic values into a set of designated values (truth) and its\ncomplement (falsity). \nEssentially the same idea has been taken up earlier by Dummett (1959)\nin an influential paper, where he asks  \nwhat point there may be in distinguishing between different ways in\nwhich a statement may be true or between different ways in which it\nmay be false, or, as we might say, between degrees of truth and\nfalsity. (Dummett 1959: 153)  \nDummett observes that, first,  \nthe sense of a sentence is determined wholly by knowing the case in\nwhich it has a designated value and the cases in which it has an\nundesignated one,  \nand moreover,  \nfiner distinctions between different designated values or different\nundesignated ones, however naturally they come to us, are justified\nonly if they are needed in order to give a truth-functional account of\nthe formation of complex statements by means of operators. (Dummett\n1959: 155)  \nSuszko’s claim evidently echoes this observation by Dummett. \nSuszko’s Thesis is substantiated by a rigorous proof (the Suszko\nReduction) showing that every structural Tarskian consequence relation\nand therefore also every structural Tarskian many-valued propositional\nlogic is characterized by a bivalent semantics. (Note also that\nRichard Routley (1975) has shown that every logic based on a\nλ-categorical language has a sound and complete bivalent\npossible worlds semantics.) The dichotomy between designated values\nand values which are not designated and its use in the definition of\nentailment plays a crucial role in the Suszko Reduction. Nevertheless,\nwhile it seems quite natural to construe the set of designated values\nas a generalization of the classical truth value \\(T\\) in some of its\nsignificant roles, it would not always be adequate to interpret the\nset of non-designated values as a generalization of the classical\ntruth value \\(F\\). The point is that in a many-valued logic, unlike in\nclassical logic, “not true” does not always mean\n“false” (cf., e.g., the above interpretation of\nKleene’s logic, where sentences can be neither true nor\nfalse). \nIn the literature on many-valued logic it is sometimes proposed to\nconsider a set of antidesignated values which not\nobligatorily constitute the complement of the set of designated values\n(see, e.g., Rescher 1969, Gottwald 2001). The set of antidesignated\nvalues can be regarded as representing a generalized concept of\nfalsity. This distinction leaves room for values that are\nneither designated nor antidesignated and even for\nvalues that are both designated and\nantidesignated. \nGrzegorz Malinowski (1990, 1994) takes advantage of this proposal to\ngive a counterexample to Suszko’s Thesis. He defines the notion\nof a single-conclusion quasi-consequence \\((q\\)-consequence)\nrelation. The semantic counterpart of \\(q\\)-consequence is called\n\\(q\\)-entailment. Single-conclusion \\(q\\)-entailment is defined by\nrequiring that if no premise is antidesignated, the conclusion is\ndesignated. Malinowski (1990) proved that for every structural\n\\(q\\)-consequence relation, there exists a characterizing class of\n\\(q\\)-matrices, matrices which in addition to a subset\n\\(\\mathcal{D}^{+}\\) of designated values comprise a disjoint subset\n\\(\\mathcal{D}^-\\) of antidesignated values. Not every\n\\(q\\)-consequence relation has a bivalent semantics. \nIn the supplementary document\n Suszko’s Thesis,\n Suszko’s reduction is introduced, Malinowski’s\ncounterexample to Suszko’s Thesis is outlined, and a short\nanalysis of these results is presented. \nCan one provide evidence for a multiplicity of logical values? More\nconcretely, \\(is\\) there more than one logical value, each of which\nmay be taken to determine its own (independent) entailment relation? A\npositive answer to this question emerges from considerations on truth\nvalues as structured entities which, by virtue of their internal\nstructure, give rise to natural partial orderings on the set of\nvalues. \nAs soon as one admits that truth values come with valuation\nsystems, it is quite natural to assume that the elements of\nsuch a system are somehow interrelated. And indeed, already\nthe valuation system for classical logic constitutes a well-known\nalgebraic structure, namely the two-element Boolean algebra with\n\\(\\cap\\) and \\(\\cup\\) as meet and join operators (see the entry on the\n mathematics of Boolean algebra).\n In its turn, this Boolean algebra forms a lattice with a partial\norder defined by \\(a\\le_t b \\textrm{ iff } a\\cap b = a\\). This\nlattice may be referred to as TWO. It is easy to see that the\nelements of TWO are ordered as follows: \\(F\\le_t T\\). This\nordering is sometimes called the truth order (as indicated by\nthe corresponding subscript), for intuitively it expresses an increase\nin truth: \\(F\\) is “less true” than \\(T\\). It can be\nschematically presented by means of a so-called Hasse-diagram as in\nFigure 1. \nFigure 1: Lattice TWO \nIt is also well-known that the truth values of both Kleene’s and\nPriest’s logic can be ordered to form a lattice\n(THREE), which is diagrammed in Figure 2. \nFigure 2: Lattice THREE \nHere \\(\\le_t\\) orders \\(T, I\\) and \\(F\\) so that the intermediate\nvalue \\(I\\) is “more true” than \\(F\\), but “less\ntrue” than \\(T\\). \nThe relation \\(\\le_t\\) is also called a logical order,\nbecause it can be used to determine key logical notions: logical\nconnectives and an entailment relation. Namely, if the elements of the\ngiven valuation system \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) form a lattice, then the\noperations of meet and join with respect to \\(\\le_t\\) are usually seen\nas the functions for conjunction and disjunction, whereas negation can\nbe represented by the inversion of this order. Moreover, one can\nconsider an entailment relation for \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) as expressing\nagreement with the truth order, that is, the conclusion should be at\nleast as true as the premises taken together: \nwhere \\(\\Pi_t\\) is the lattice meet in the corresponding lattice. \nThe Belnap matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}_4\\) considered above also can be\nrepresented as a partially ordered valuation system. The set of truth\nvalues \\(\\{\\mathbf{N}, \\mathbf{T}, \\mathbf{F}, \\mathbf{B}\\}\\) from\n\\(\\mathbf{B}_4\\) constitutes a specific algebraic structure –\nthe bilattice FOUR\\(_2\\) presented in Figure 3 (see, e.g.,\nGinsberg 1988, Arieli and Avron 1996, Fitting 2006). \nFigure 3: The bilattice\nFOUR\\(_2\\) \nThis bilattice is equipped with two partial orderings; in\naddition to a truth order, there is an information order \\((\\le_i )\\)\nwhich is said to order the values under consideration according to the\ninformation they give concerning a formula to which they are assigned.\nLattice meet and join with respect to \\(\\le_t\\) coincide with the\nfunctions \\(f_{\\wedge}\\) and \\(f_{\\vee}\\) in the Belnap matrix\n\\(\\mathbf{B}_4\\), \\(f_{{\\sim}}\\) turns out to be the truth order\ninversion, and an entailment relation, which happens to coincide with\nthe matrix entailment, is defined by\n (8).\n FOUR\\(_2\\) arises as a combination of two structures: the\napproximation lattice \\(A_4\\) and the logical lattice \\(L_4\\) which\nare discussed in Belnap 1977a and 1977b (see also, Anderson, Belnap\nand Dunn 1992: 510–518)). \nFrege (1892: 30) points out the possibility of “distinctions of\nparts within truth values”. Although he immediately specifies\nthat the word ‘part’ is used here “in a special\nsense”, the basic idea seems nevertheless to be that truth\nvalues are not something amorphous, but possess some inner structure.\nIt is not quite clear how serious Frege is about this view, but it\nseems to suggest that truth values may well be interpreted as complex,\nstructured entities that can be divided into parts. \nThere exist several approaches to semantic constructions where truth\nvalues are represented as being made up from some primitive\ncomponents. For example, in some explications of Kripke models for\nintuitionistic logic propositions (identified with sets of\n“worlds” in a model structure) can be understood as truth\nvalues of a certain kind. Then the empty proposition is interpreted as\nthe value false, and the maximal proposition (the set of all\nworlds in a structure) as the value true. Moreover, one can\nconsider non-empty subsets of the maximal proposition as intermediate\ntruth values. Clearly, the intuitionistic truth values so conceived\nare composed from some simpler elements and as such they turn out to\nbe complex entities. \nAnother prominent example of structured truth values are the\n“truth-value objects” in topos models from category theory\n(see the entry on\n category theory).\n For any topos \\(C\\) and for a \\(C\\)-object Ω one can define a\ntruth value of \\(C\\) as an arrow \\(1 \\rightarrow Ω\\) (“a\nsubobject classifier for \\(C\\)”), where 1 is a terminal object\nin \\(C\\) (cf. Goldblatt 2006: 81, 94). The set of truth values so\ndefined plays a special role in the logical structure of \\(C\\), since\narrows of the form \\(1 \\rightarrow Ω\\) determine central\nsemantical notions for the given topos. And again, these truth values\nevidently have some inner structure. \nOne can also mention in this respect the so-called “factor\nsemantics” for many-valued logic, where truth values are defined\nas ordered \\(n\\)-tuples of classical truth values \\((T\\)-\\(F\\)\nsequences, see Karpenko 1983). Then the value \\(3/5\\), for example,\ncan be interpreted as a \\(T\\)-\\(F\\) sequence of length 5 with exactly\n3 occurrences of \\(T\\). Here the classical values \\(T\\) and \\(F\\) are\nused as “building blocks” for non-classical truth\nvalues. \nMoreover, the idea of truth values as compound entities nicely\nconforms with the modeling of truth values considered above in\nthree-valued (Kleene, Priest) and four-valued (Belnap) logics as\ncertain subsets of the set of classical truth values. The latter\napproach stems essentially from Dunn (1976), where a generalization of\nthe notion of a classical truth-value function has been proposed to\nobtain so-called “underdetermined” and\n“overdetermined” valuations. Namely, Dunn considers a\nvaluation to be a function not from sentences to elements of the set\n\\(\\{T, F\\}\\) but from sentences to subsets of this set (see also Dunn\n2000: 7). By developing this idea, one arrives at the concept of a\ngeneralized truth value function, which is a function from\nsentences into the subsets of some basic set of truth\nvalues (see Shramko and Wansing 2005). The values of generalized\ntruth value functions can be called generalized truth\nvalues. \nBy employing the idea of generalized truth value functions, one can\nobtain a hierarchy of valuation systems starting with a certain\nset-theoretic representation of the valuation system for classical\nlogic. The representation in question is built on a single initial\nvalue which serves then as the designated value of the resulting\nvaluation system. More specifically, consider the singleton\n\\(\\{\\varnothing \\}\\) taken as the basic set subject to a further\ngeneralization procedure. Set-theoretically the basic set can serve as\nthe universal set (the complement of the empty set) for the valuation\nsystem \\(\\mathbf{V}^{\\varnothing}_{cl}\\) introduced below. At the\nfirst stage \\(\\varnothing\\) comes out with no specific intuitive\ninterpretation, it is only important to take it as some\ndistinct unit. Consider then the power-set of \\(\\{\\varnothing\n\\}\\) consisting of exactly two elements: \\(\\{\\{\\varnothing \\},\n\\varnothing \\}\\). Now, these elements can be interpreted as\nFrege’s the True and the False, and thus it is\npossible to construct a valuation system for classical logic,\n\\(\\mathbf{V}^{\\varnothing}_{cl} = \\langle \\{\\{\\varnothing \\},\n\\varnothing \\}, \\{\\{\\varnothing \\}\\}, \\{f_{\\wedge}, f_{\\vee},\nf_{\\rightarrow}, f_{\\sim}\\}\\rangle\\), where the functions\n\\(f_{\\wedge}, f_{\\vee}, f_{\\rightarrow}, f_{\\sim}\\) are defined as\nfollows (for\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nX, Y \\in \\{\\{\\varnothing \\}, \\varnothing \\}:\\quad & f_{\\wedge}(X, Y) = X\\cap Y; \\\\\n& f_{\\vee}(X, Y) = X\\cup Y; \\\\\n& f_{\\rightarrow}(X, Y) = X^{c}\\cup Y; \\\\\n& f_{\\sim}(X) = X^{c}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n It is not difficult to see that for any\nassignment \\(a\\) relative to \\(\\mathbf{V}^{\\varnothing}_{cl}\\), and\nfor any formulas \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the following holds:  \nThis shows that \\(f_{\\wedge}, f_{\\vee}, f_{\\rightarrow}\\) and\n\\(f_{\\sim}\\) determine exactly the propositional connectives of\nclassical logic. One can conveniently mark the elements\n\\(\\{\\varnothing \\}\\) and \\(\\varnothing\\) in the valuation system\n\\(\\mathbf{V}^{\\varnothing}_{cl}\\) by the classical labels \\(T\\) and\n\\(F\\). Note that within \\(\\mathbf{V}^{\\varnothing}_{cl}\\) it is fully\njustifiable to associate \\(\\varnothing\\) with falsity, taking into\naccount the virtual monism of truth characteristic for\nclassical logic, which treats falsity not as an independent entity but\nmerely as the absence of truth. \nThen, by taking the set \\(\\mathbf{2} = \\{F, T\\}\\) of these classical\nvalues as the basic set for the next valuation system, one obtains the\nfour truth values of Belnap’s logic as the power-set of the set\nof classical values \\(\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbf{2}) = \\mathbf{4}: \\mathbf{N}\n= \\varnothing\\), \\(\\mathbf{F} = \\{F\\} (= \\{\\varnothing \\})\\),\n\\(\\mathbf{T} = \\{T\\} (= \\{\\{\\varnothing \\}\\})\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B} =\n\\{F, T\\} (= \\{\\varnothing, \\{\\varnothing \\}\\})\\). In this way,\nBelnap’s four-valued logic emerges as a certain generalization\nof classical logic with its two Fregean truth values. In\nBelnap’s logic truth and falsity are considered to be\nfull-fledged, self-sufficient entities, and therefore \\(\\varnothing\\)\nis now to be interpreted not as falsity, but as a real truth-value gap\n(neither true nor false). The dissimilarity of\nBelnap’s truth and falsity from their classical analogues is\nnaturally expressed by passing from the corresponding classical values\nto their singleton-sets, indicating thus their new interpretations as\nfalse only and true only. Belnap’s\ninterpretation of the four truth values has been critically discussed\nin Lewis 1982 and Dubois 2008 (see also the reply to Dubois in Wansing\nand Belnap 2010). \nGeneralized truth values have a strong intuitive background,\nespecially as a tool for the rational explication of incomplete and\ninconsistent information states. In particular, Belnap’s\nheuristic interpretation of truth values as information that\n“has been told to a computer” (see Belnap 1977a,b; also\nreproduced in Anderson, Belnap and Dunn 1992, §81) has been\nwidely acknowledged. As Belnap points out, a computer may receive data\nfrom various (maybe independent) sources. Belnap’s\ncomputers have to take into account various kinds of information\nconcerning a given sentence. Besides the standard (classical) cases,\nwhen a computer obtains information either that the sentence is (1)\ntrue or that it is (2) false, two other (non-standard) situations are\npossible: (3) nothing is told about the sentence or (4) the sources\nsupply inconsistent information, information that the sentence is true\nand information that it is false. And the four truth values from\n\\(\\mathbf{B}_4\\) naturally correspond to these four situations: there\nis no information that the sentence is false and no information that\nit is true \\((\\mathbf{N})\\), there is merely information that\nthe sentence is false \\((\\mathbf{F})\\), there is merely\ninformation that the sentence is true \\((\\mathbf{T})\\), and there is\ninformation that the sentence is false, but there is also information\nthat it is true \\((\\mathbf{B})\\). \nJoseph Camp in 2002: 125–160 provides Belnap’s four values\nwith quite a different intuitive motivation by developing what he\ncalls a “semantics of confused thought”. Consider a\nrational agent, who happens to mix up two very similar objects (say,\n\\(a\\) and \\(b)\\) and ambiguously uses one name (say,\n‘\\(C\\)’) for both of them. Now let such an agent assert\nsome statement, saying, for instance, that \\(C\\) has some property.\nHow should one evaluate this statement if \\(a\\) has the property in\nquestion whereas \\(b\\) lacks it? Camp argues against ascribing truth\nvalues to such statements and puts forward an “epistemic\nsemantics” in terms of “profitability” and\n“costliness” as suitable characterizations of sentences. A\nsentence \\(S\\) is said to be “profitable” if one would\nprofit from acting on the belief that \\(S\\), and it is said to be\n“costly” if acting on the belief that \\(S\\) would generate\ncosts, for example as measured by failure to achieve an intended goal.\nIf our “confused agent” asks some external observers\nwhether \\(C\\) has the discussed property, the following four answers\nare possible: ‘yes’ (mark the corresponding sentence with\n\\(\\mathbf{Y})\\), ‘no’ (mark it with \\(\\mathbf{N})\\),\n‘cannot say’ (mark it with ?),\n‘yes’ and ‘no’ (mark it with\nY&N). Note that the external observers, who\nprovide answers, are “non-confused” and have different\nobjects in mind as to the referent of ‘\\(C\\)’, in view of\nall the facts that may be relevant here. Camp conceives these four\npossible answers concerning epistemic properties of sentences as a\nkind of “semantic values”, interpreting them as follows:\nthe value \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) is an indicator of profitability, the value\n\\(\\mathbf{N}\\) is an indicator of costliness, the value\n? is no indicator either way, and the value\nY&N is both an indicator of profitability and an\nindicator of costliness. A strict analogy between this\n“semantics of confused reasoning” and Belnap’s four\nvalued logic is straightforward. And indeed, as Camp (2002: 157)\nobserves, the set of implications valid according to his semantics is\nexactly the set of implications of the entailment system \\(E_{fde}\\).\nIn Zaitsev and Shramko 2013 it is demonstrated how ontological and\nepistemic aspects of truth values can be combined within a joint\nsemantical framework. Kapsner (2019) extends Belnap’s framework\nby two additional values “Contestedly-True” and\n“Contestedly-False” which allows for new outcomes for\ndisjunctions and conjunctions between statements with values\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{N}\\). \nThe conception of generalized truth values has its purely logical\nimport as well. If one continues the construction and applies the idea\nof generalized truth value functions to Belnap’s four truth\nvalues, then one obtains further valuation systems which can be\nrepresented by various multilattices. One arrives, in\nparticular, at SIXTEEN\\(_3\\) – the trilattice\nof 16 truth-values, which can be viewed as a basis for a logic of\ncomputer networks (see Shramko and Wansing 2005, 2006; Kamide and\nWansing 2009; Odintsov 2009; Wansing 2010; Odintsov and Wansing 2015;\ncf. also Shramko, Dunn, Takenaka 2001). The notion of a multilattice\nand SIXTEEN\\(_3\\) are discussed further in the supplementary\ndocument\n Generalized truth values and multilattices.\n A comprehensive study of the conception of generalized logical values\ncan be found in Shramko and Wansing 2011. \nGottlob Frege’s notion of a truth value has become part of the\nstandard philosophical and logical terminology. The notion of a truth\nvalue is an indispensable instrument of realistic, model-theoretic\napproaches to semantics. Indeed, truth values play an essential role\nin applications of model-theoretic semantics in areas such as, for\nexample, knowledge representation and theorem proving based on\nsemantic tableaux, which could not be treated in the present entry.\nMoreover, considerations on truth values give rise to deep ontological\nquestions concerning their own nature, the feasibility of fact\nontologies, and the role of truth values in such ontological theories.\nThere also exist well-motivated theories of generalized truth values\nthat lead far beyond Frege’s classical values the True\nand the False.

Although it\nwas Frege who made the notion of a truth value to one of the central\nconcepts of semantics, the idea of special semantical values, however,\nwas anticipated by Boole and Peirce already, see the survey article on\na “history of truth values” by Béziau (2012).\nAccording to Kneale and Kneale (1962: 413), Boole’s system\ncontains all that is needed for its interpretation “in terms of\ntruth values of propositions”, and as Church (1956: 17) remarks,\nthe “explicit use of two truth-values appears for the first time\nin a paper by C.S. Peirce in the American Journal of\nMathematics, vol. 7 (1885), pp. 180–202”. Frege\nconceived this notion as a natural component of his language analysis\nwhere sentences, being saturated expressions, are interpreted as a\nspecial kind of names, which refer to (denote, designate, signify) a\nspecial kind of objects: truth values. Moreover, there are, according\nto Frege, only two such objects: the True (das\nWahre) and the False (das Falsche):\n\n\nEvery assertoric sentence … is to be regarded as a proper name,\nand its Bedeutung, if it has one, is either the True or the\nFalse. (Frege 1892, trans. Beaney 1997: 158)\n\n\n\nThis new and revolutionary idea has had a far reaching and manifold\nimpact on the development of modern logic. It provides the means to\nuniformly complete the formal apparatus of a functional analysis of\nlanguage by generalizing the concept of a function and introducing a\nspecial kind of functions, namely propositional functions, or truth\nvalue functions, whose range of values consists of the set of truth\nvalues. Among the most typical representatives of propositional\nfunctions one finds predicate expressions and logical connectives. As\na result, one obtains a powerful tool for a conclusive implementation\nof the extensionality principle (also called the principle of\ncompositionality), according to which the meaning of a complex\nexpression is uniquely determined by the meanings of its components.\nOn this basis one can also discriminate between extensional and\nintensional contexts and advance further to the conception of\nintensional logics. Moreover, the idea of truth values has induced a\nradical rethinking of some central issues in the philosophy of logic,\nincluding: the categorial status of truth, the theory of abstract\nobjects, the subject-matter of logic and its ontological foundations,\nthe concept of a logical system, the nature of logical notions,\netc.\n\n\nIn the following, several important philosophical problems directly\nconnected to the notion of a truth value are considered and various\nuses of this notion are explained.\n\n\nThe approach to language analysis developed by Frege rests essentially\non the idea of a strict discrimination between two main kinds of\nexpressions: proper names (singular terms) and functional\nexpressions. Proper names designate (signify, denote, or refer to)\nsingular objects, and functional expressions designate (signify,\ndenote, or refer to) functions. [Note: In the literature, the\nexpressions ‘designation’, ‘signification’,\n‘denotation’, and ‘reference’ are usually\ntaken to be synonymous. This practice is used throughout the present\nentry.] The name ‘Ukraine’, for example, refers to a\ncertain country, and the expression ‘the capital of’\ndenotes a one-place function from countries to cities, in particular,\na function that maps Ukraine to Kyiv (Kiev). Whereas names are\n“saturated” (complete) expressions, functional expressions\nare “unsaturated” (incomplete) and may be saturated by\napplying them to names, producing in this way new names. Similarly,\nthe objects to which singular terms refer are saturated and the\nfunctions denoted by functional expression are unsaturated. Names to\nwhich a functional expression can be applied are called\nthe arguments of this functional expression, and entities to\nwhich a function can be applied are called the arguments of\nthis function. The object which serves as the reference for the name\ngenerated by an application of a functional expression to its\narguments is called the value of the function for these\narguments. Particularly, the above mentioned functional expression\n‘the capital of’ remains incomplete until applied to some\nname. An application of the function denoted by ‘the capital\nof’ to Ukraine (as an argument) returns Kyiv as the object\ndenoted by the compound expression ‘the capital of\nUkraine’ which, according to Frege, is a proper name of\nKyiv. Note that Frege distinguishes between an \\(n\\)-place function\n\\(f\\) as an unsaturated entity that can be completed by and applied to\narguments \\(a_1\\),…, \\(a_n\\) and its course of values,\nwhich can be seen as the set-theoretic representation of this\nfunction: the set \nPursuing this kind of analysis, one is very quickly confronted with\ntwo intricate problems. First, how should one treat\ndeclarative sentences? Should one perhaps separate them into\na specific linguistic category distinct from the ones of names and\nfunction symbols? And second, how—from a functional\npoint of view—should one deal with predicate\nexpressions such as ‘is a city’, ‘is\ntall’, ‘runs’, ‘is bigger than’,\n‘loves’, etc., which are used to denote classes of\nobjects, properties of objects, or relations between them and which\ncan be combined with (applied to) singular terms to obtain sentences?\nIf one considers predicates to be a kind of functional expressions,\nwhat sort of names are generated by applying predicates to their\narguments, and what can serve as referents of these names,\nrespectively values of these functions? \nA uniform solution of both problems is obtained by introducing the\nnotion of a truth value. Namely, by applying the criterion of\n“saturatedness” Frege provides a negative answer to the\nfirst of the above problems. Since sentences are a kind of complete\nentities, they should be treated as a sort of proper names, but names\ndestined to denote some specific objects, namely the truth values:\nthe True and the False. In this way one also obtains\na solution of the second problem. Predicates are to be interpreted as\nsome kind of functional expressions, which being applied to these or\nthose names generate sentences referring to one of the two truth\nvalues. For example, if the predicate ‘is a city’ is\napplied to the name ‘Kyiv’, one gets the sentence\n‘Kyiv is a city’, which designates the True\n(i.e., ‘Kyiv is a city’ is true). On the other\nhand, by using the name ‘Mount Everest’, one obtains the\nsentence ‘Mount Everest is a city’ which clearly\ndesignates the False, since ‘Mount Everest is a\ncity’ is false. \nFunctions whose values are truth values are called propositional\nfunctions. Frege also referred to them as concepts\n(Begriffe). A typical kind of such functions (besides the\nones denoted by predicates) are the functions denoted by propositional\nconnectives. Negation, for example, can be interpreted as a unary\nfunction converting the True into the False and\nvice versa, and conjunction is a binary function that returns\nthe True as a value when both its argument positions are\nfilled in by the True, etc. Propositional functions mapping\n\\(n\\)-tuples of truth values into truth values are also called\ntruth-value functions. \nFrege thus in a first step extended the familiar notion of a numerical\nfunction to functions on singular objects in general and, moreover,\nintroduced a new kind of singular objects that can serve as arguments\nand values of functions on singular objects, the truth values. In a\nfurther step, he considered propositional functions taking functions\nas their arguments. The quantifier phrase ‘every city’,\nfor example, can be applied to the predicate ‘is a\ncapital’ to produce a sentence. The argument of the\nsecond-order function denoted by ‘every city’ is\nthe first-order propositional function on singular objects\ndenoted by ‘is a capital’. The functional value denoted by\nthe sentence ‘Every city is a capital’ is a truth value,\nthe False. \nTruth values thus prove to be an extremely effective instrument for a\nlogical and semantical analysis of \n language.[1]\n Moreover, Frege provides\ntruth values (as proper referents of sentences) not merely with a\npragmatical motivation but also with a strong theoretical\njustification. The idea of such justification, that can be found in\nFrege 1892, employs the principle of substitutivity of\nco-referential terms, according to which the reference of a complex\nsingular term must remain unchanged when any of its sub-terms is\nreplaced by an expression having the same reference. This is actually\njust an instance of the compositionality principle mentioned above. If\nsentences are treated as a kind of singular terms which must have\ndesignations, then assuming the principle of substitutivity one\n“almost inevitably” (as Kurt Gödel (1944: 129)\nexplains) is forced to recognize truth values as the most suitable\nentities for such designations. Accordingly, Frege asks: \nWhat else but the truth value could be found, that belongs quite\ngenerally to every sentence if the reference of its components is\nrelevant, and remains unchanged by substitutions of the kind in\nquestion? (Geach and Black 1952: 64)  \nThe idea underlying this question has been neatly reconstructed by\nAlonzo Church in his Introduction to Mathematical Logic\n(1956: 24–25) by considering the following sequence of four\nsentences: \nC1–C4 present a number of conversion steps each producing\nco-referential sentences. It is claimed that C1 and C2 must have the\nsame designation by substitutivity, for the terms ‘the author of\nWaverley’ and ‘the man who wrote 29\nWaverley Novels altogether’ designate one and the same\nobject, namely Walter Scott. And so must C3 and C4, because the\nnumber, such that Sir Walter Scott is the man who wrote that many\nWaverley Novels altogether is the same as the number of\ncounties in Utah, namely 29. Next, Church argues, it is plausible to\nsuppose that C2, even if not completely synonymous with C3, is at\nleast so close to C3 “so as to ensure its having the same\ndenotation”. If this is indeed the case, then C1 and C4 must\nhave the same denotation (designation) as well. But it seems that the\nonly (semantically relevant) thing these sentences have in common is\nthat both are true. Thus, taken that there must be something what the\nsentences designate, one concludes that it is just their truth value.\nAs Church remarks, a parallel example involving false sentences can be\nconstructed in the same way (by considering, e.g., ‘Sir Walter\nScott is not the author of Waverley’). \nThis line of reasoning is now widely known as the “slingshot\nargument”, a term coined by Jon Barwise and John Perry (in\nBarwise and Perry 1981: 395), who stressed thus an extraordinary\nsimplicity of the argument and the minimality of presuppositions\ninvolved. Stated generally, the pattern of the argument goes as\nfollows (cf. Perry 1996). One starts with a certain sentence, and then\nmoves, step by step, to a completely different sentence. Every two\nsentences in any step designate presumably one and the same thing.\nHence, the starting and the concluding sentences of the argument must\nhave the same designation as well. But the only semantically\nsignificant thing they have in common seems to be their truth value.\nThus, what any sentence designates is just its truth value. \nA formal version of this argument, employing the term-forming,\nvariable-binding class abstraction (or property abstraction) operator\nλ\\(x\\) (“the class of all \\(x\\) such that” or\n“the property of being such an \\(x\\) that”), was first\nformulated by Church (1943) in his review of Carnap’s\nIntroduction to Semantics. Quine (1953), too, presents a\nvariant of the slingshot using class abstraction, see also (Shramko\nand Wansing 2009a). Other remarkable variations of the argument are\nthose by Kurt Gödel (1944) and Donald Davidson (1967, 1969),\nwhich make use of the formal apparatus of a theory of definite\ndescriptions dealing with the description-forming, variable-binding\niota-operator (ι\\(x\\), “the \\(x\\) such that”). It is\nworth noticing that the formal versions of the slingshot show how to\nmove—using steps that ultimately preserve reference—from\nany true (false) sentence to any other such\nsentence. In view of this result, it is hard to avoid the conclusion\nthat what the sentences refer to are just truth values. \nThe slingshot argument has been analyzed in detail by many authors\n(see especially the comprehensive study by Stephen Neale (Neale 2001)\nand references therein) and has caused much controversy notably on the\npart of fact-theorists, i.e., adherents of facts, situations,\npropositions, states of affairs, and other fact-like entities\nconceived as alternative candidates for denotations of declarative\nsentences. Also see the\n supplement on the slingshot argument. \nTruth values evidently have something to do with a general concept of\ntruth. Therefore it may seem rather tempting to try to incorporate\nconsiderations on truth values into the broader context of traditional\ntruth-theories, such as correspondence, coherence, anti-realistic, or\npragmatist conceptions of truth. Yet, it is unlikely that such\nattempts can give rise to any considerable success. Indeed, the\nimmense fruitfulness of Frege’s introduction of truth values\ninto logic to a large extent is just due to its philosophical\nneutrality with respect to theories of truth. It does not commit one\nto any specific metaphysical doctrine of truth. In one significant\nrespect, however, the idea of truth values contravenes traditional\napproaches to truth by bringing to the forefront the problem of its\ncategorial classification. \nIn most of the established conceptions, truth is usually treated as a\nproperty. It is customary to talk about a “truth\npredicate” and its attribution to sentences, propositions,\nbeliefs or the like. Such an understanding corresponds also to a\nroutine linguistic practice, when one operates with the adjective\n‘true’ and asserts, e.g., ‘That 5 is a prime number\nis true’. By contrast with this apparently quite natural\nattitude, the suggestion to interpret truth as an object may seem very\nconfusing, to say the least. Nevertheless this suggestion is also\nequipped with a profound and strong motivation demonstrating that it\nis far from being just an oddity and has to be taken seriously (cf.\nBurge 1986). \nFirst, it should be noted that the view of truth as a property is not\nas natural as it appears on the face of it. Frege brought into play an\nargument to the effect that characterizing a sentence as true\nadds nothing new to its content, for ‘It is true that 5 is a\nprime number’ says exactly the same as just ‘5 is a prime\nnumber’. That is, the adjective ‘true’ is in a sense\nredundant and thus is not a real predicate expressing a real\nproperty such as the predicates ‘white’ or\n‘prime’ which, on the contrary, cannot simply be\neliminated from a sentence without an essential loss for its content.\nIn this case a superficial grammatical analogy is misleading. This\nidea gave an impetus to the deflationary conception of truth\n(advocated by Ramsey, Ayer, Quine, Horwich, and others, see the entry\non\n the deflationary theory of truth). \nHowever, even admitting the redundancy of truth as a property, Frege\nemphasizes its importance and indispensable role in some other\nrespect. Namely, truth, accompanying every act of judgment as its\nultimate goal, secures an objective value of cognition by\narranging for every assertive sentence a transition from the level of\nsense (the thought expressed by a sentence) to the level of denotation\n(its truth value). This circumstance specifies the significance of\ntaking truth as a particular object. As Tyler Burge explains: \nNormally, the point of using sentences, what “matters to\nus”, is to claim truth for a thought. The object, in the sense\nof the point or objective, of sentence use was truth. It is\nilluminating therefore to see truth as an object. (Burge 1986: 120)\n \nAs it has been observed repeatedly in the literature (cf., e.g., Burge\n1986, Ruffino 2003), the stress Frege laid on the notion of a truth\nvalue was, to a great extent, pragmatically motivated. Besides an\nintended gain for his system of “Basic Laws” (Frege\n1893/1903) reflected in enhanced technical clarity, simplicity, and\nunity, Frege also sought to substantiate in this way his view on logic\nas a theoretical discipline with truth as its main goal and primary\nsubject-matter. Incidentally, Gottfried Gabriel (1986) demonstrated\nthat in the latter respect Frege’s ideas can be naturally linked\nup with a value-theoretical tradition in German philosophy of the\nsecond half of the 19th century; see also (Gabriel 2013) on\nthe relation between Frege’s value-theoretically inspired\nconception of truth values and his theory of judgement. More\nspecifically, Wilhelm Windelband, the founder and the principal\nrepresentative of the Southwest school of Neo-Kantianism, was actually\nthe first who employed the term “truth value”\n(“Wahrheitswert”) in his essay “What is\nPhilosophy?” published in 1882 (see Windelband 1915: 32), i.e.,\nnine years before Frege 1891, even if he was very far from treating a\ntruth value as a value of a function. \nWindelband defined philosophy as a “critical science about\nuniversal values”. He considered philosophical statements to be\nnot mere judgements but rather assessments, dealing with some\nfundamental values, the value of truth being one of the most\nimportant among them. This latter value is to be studied by logic as a\nspecial philosophical discipline. Thus, from a value-theoretical\nstandpoint, the main task of philosophy, taken generally, is to\nestablish the principles of logical, ethical and aesthetical\nassessments, and Windelband accordingly highlighted the triad of basic\nvalues: “true”, “good” and\n“beautiful”. Later this triad was taken up by Frege in\n1918 when he defined the subject-matter of logic (see below). Gabriel\npoints out (1984: 374) that this connection between logic and a value\ntheory can be traced back to Hermann Lotze, whose seminars in\nGöttingen were attended by both Windelband and Frege. \nThe decisive move made by Frege was to bring together a philosophical\nand a mathematical understanding of values on the basis of a\ngeneralization of the notion of a function on numbers. While Frege may\nhave been inspired by Windelband’s use of the word\n‘value’ (and even more concretely – ‘truth\nvalue’), it is clear that he uses the word in its mathematical\nsense. If predicates are construed as a kind of functional expressions\nwhich, being applied to singular terms as arguments, produce\nsentences, then the values of the corresponding functions must be\nreferences of sentences. Taking into account that the range of any\nfunction typically consists of objects, it is natural to conclude that\nreferences of sentences must be objects as well. And if one now just\ntakes it that sentences refer to truth values (the True and\nthe False), then it turns out that truth values are indeed\nobjects, and it seems quite reasonable to generally explicate truth\nand falsity as objects and not as properties. As Frege explains: \nA statement contains no empty place, and therefore we must take its\nBedeutung as an object. But this Bedeutung is a\ntruth-value. Thus the two truth-values are objects. (Frege 1891,\ntrans. Beaney 1997: 140)  \nFrege’s theory of sentences as names of truth values has been\ncriticized, for example, by Michael Dummett who stated rather\ndramatically: \nThis was the most disastrous of the effects of the misbegotten\ndoctrine that sentences are a species of complex singular terms, which\ndominated Frege’s later period: to rob him of the insight that\nsentences play a unique role, and that the role of almost every other\nlinguistic expression … consists in its part in forming\nsentences. (Dummett 1981: 196)  \nBut even Dummett (1991: 242) concedes that “to deny that\ntruth-values are objects … seems a weak response”. \nIf truth values are accepted and taken seriously as a special kind of\nobjects, the obvious question as to the nature of these entities\narises. The above characterization of truth values as objects is far\ntoo general and requires further specification. One way of such\nspecification is to qualify truth values as abstract objects.\nNote that Frege himself never used the word ‘abstract’\nwhen describing truth values. Instead, he has a conception of so\ncalled “logical objects”, truth values being primary and\nthe most fundamental of them (Frege 1976: 121). Among the other\nlogical objects Frege pays particular attention to are sets and\nnumbers, emphasizing thus their logical nature (in accordance with his\nlogicist view). \nChurch (1956: 25), when considering truth values, explicitly\nattributes to them the property of being abstract. Since then it is\ncustomary to label truth values as abstract objects, thus allocating\nthem into the same category of entities as mathematical objects\n(numbers, classes, geometrical figures) and propositions. One may pose\nhere an interesting question about the correlation between Fregean\nlogical objects and abstract objects in the modern sense (see the\nentry on\n abstract objects).  \nObviously, the universe of abstract objects is much broader than the\nuniverse of logical objects as Frege conceives them. The latter are\nconstrued as constituting an ontological foundation for logic, and\nhence for mathematics (pursuant to Frege’s logicist program).\nGenerally, the class of abstracta includes a wide diversity\nof platonic universals (such as redness, youngness, justice or\ntriangularity) and not only those of them which are logically\nnecessary. Nevertheless, it may safely be said that logical objects\ncan be considered as paradigmatic cases of abstract entities, or\nabstract objects in their purest form. \nIt should be noted that finding an adequate definition of abstract\nobjects is a matter of considerable controversy. According to a common\nview, abstract entities lack spatio-temporal properties and relations,\nas opposed to concrete objects which exist in space and time (Lowe\n1995: 515). In this respect truth values obviously are\nabstract as they clearly have nothing to do with physical spacetime.\nIn a similar fashion truth values fulfill another requirement often\nimposed upon abstract objects, namely the one of a causal inefficacy\n(see, e.g., Grossmann 1992: 7). Here again, truth values are very much\nlike numbers and geometrical figures: they have no causal power and\nmake nothing happen. \nFinally, it is of interest to consider how truth values can be\nintroduced by applying so-called abstraction principles,\nwhich are used for supplying abstract objects with criteria of\nidentity. The idea of this method of characterizing abstract\nobjects is also largely due to Frege, who wrote: \nIf the symbol a is to designate an object for us, then we must\nhave a criterion that decides in all cases whether b is the\nsame as a, even if it is not always in our power to apply this\ncriterion. (Frege 1884, trans. Beaney 1997: 109)  \nMore precisely, one obtains a new object by abstracting it from some\ngiven kind of entities, in virtue of certain criteria of identity for\nthis new (abstract) object. This abstraction is performed in terms of\nan equivalence relation defined on the given entities (see Wrigley\n2006: 161). The celebrated slogan by Quine (1969: 23) “No entity\nwithout identity” is intended to express essentially the same\nunderstanding of an (abstract) object as an “item falling under\na sortal concept which supplies a well-defined criterion of identity\nfor its instances” (Lowe 1997: 619). \nFor truth values such a criterion has been suggested in Anderson and\nZalta (2004: 2), stating that for any two sentences \\(p\\) and \\(q\\),\nthe truth value of \\(p\\) is identical with the truth value of \\(q\\) if\nand only if \\(p\\) is (non-logically) equivalent with \\(q\\) (cf. also\nDummett 1959: 141). This idea can be formally explicated following the\nstyle of presentation in Lowe (1997: 620): \nwhere &, \\(\\Rightarrow, \\Leftrightarrow, \\forall\\) stand\ncorrespondingly for ‘and’, ‘if… then’,\n‘if and only if’ and ‘for all’ in the\nmetalanguage, and \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) stands for some\nobject language equivalence connective (biconditional). \nIncidentally, Carnap (1947: 26), when introducing truth-values as\nextensions of sentences, is guided by essentially the same idea.\nNamely, he points out a strong analogy between extensions of\npredicators and truth values of sentences. Carnap considers a wide\nclass of designating expressions (“designators”) among\nwhich there are predicate expressions (“predicators”),\nfunctional expressions (“functors”), and some others.\nApplying the well-known technique of interpreting sentences as\npredicators of degree 0, he generalizes the fact that two predicators\nof degree \\(n\\) (say, \\(P\\) and \\(Q)\\) have the same extension if and\nonly if \\(\\forall x_1\\forall x_2 \\ldots \\forall x_n(Px_1 x_2\\ldots x_n\n\\leftrightarrow Qx_1 x_2\\ldots x_n)\\) holds. Then, analogously, two\nsentences (say, \\(p\\) and \\(q)\\), being interpreted as predicators of\ndegree 0, must have the same extension if and only if\n\\(p\\leftrightarrow q\\) holds, that is if and only if they are\nequivalent. And then, Carnap remarks, it seems quite natural to take\ntruth values as extensions for sentences. \nNote that this criterion employs a functional dependency\nbetween an introduced abstract object (in this case a truth value) and\nsome other objects (sentences). More specifically, what is considered\nis the truth value of a sentence (or proposition, or the like).\nThe criterion of identity for truth values is formulated then through\nthe logical relation of equivalence holding between these other\nobjects—sentences, propositions, or the like (with an explicit\nquantification over them). \nIt should also be remarked that the properties of the object language\nbiconditional depend on the logical system in which the biconditional\nis employed. Biconditionals of different logics may have different\nlogical properties, and it surely matters what kind of the equivalence\nconnective is used for defining truth values. This means that the\nconcept of a truth value introduced by means of the identity criterion\nthat involves a biconditional between sentences is also\nlogic-relative. Thus, if ‘\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)’ stands for\nmaterial equivalence, one obtains classical truth values, but if the\nintuitionistic biconditional is employed, one gets truth values of\nintuitionistic logic, etc. Taking into account the role truth values\nplay in logic, such an outcome seems to be not at all unnatural. \nAnderson and Zalta (2004: 13), making use of an object theory from\nZalta (1983), propose the following definition of ‘the truth\nvalue of proposition \\(p\\)’ (‘\\(tv(p)\\)’ [notation\nadjusted]): \nwhere \\(A\\)! stands for a primitive theoretical predicate ‘being\nabstract’, \\(xF\\) is to be read as “\\(x\\) encodes\n\\(F\\)” and [λy q] is a propositional\nproperty (“being such a \\(y\\) that \\(q\\)”). That is,\naccording to this definition, “the extension of \\(p\\) is the\nabstract object that encodes all and only the properties of the form\n[λy q] which are constructed out of\npropositions \\(q\\) materially equivalent to \\(p\\)” (Anderson and\nZalta 2004: 14). \nThe notion of a truth value in general is then defined as an object\nwhich is the truth value of some proposition: \nUsing this apparatus, it is possible to explicitly define the Fregean\ntruth values the True \\((\\top)\\) and the False\n\\((\\bot)\\): \nAnderson and Zalta prove then that \\(\\top\\) and \\(\\bot\\) are indeed\ntruth values and, moreover, that there are exactly two such objects.\nThe latter result is expected, if one bears in mind that what the\ndefinitions above actually introduce are the classical truth\nvalues (as the underlying logic is classical). Indeed,\n\\(p\\leftrightarrow q\\) is classically equivalent to \\((p\\wedge\nq)\\vee(\\neg p\\wedge \\neg q)\\), and \\(\\neg(p\\leftrightarrow q)\\) is\nclassically equivalent to \\((p\\wedge \\neg q)\\vee(\\neg p\\wedge q)\\).\nThat is, the connective of material equivalence divides sentences into\ntwo distinct collections. Due to the law of excluded middle these\ncollections are exhaustive, and by virtue of the law of\nnon-contradiction they are exclusive. Thus, we get exactly two\nequivalence classes of sentences, each being a hypostatized\nrepresentative of one of two classical truth values. \nIn a late paper Frege (1918) claims that the word ‘true’\ndetermines the subject-matter of logic in exactly the same way as the\nword ‘beautiful’ does for aesthetics and the word\n‘good’ for ethics. Thus, according to such a view, the\nproper task of logic consists, ultimately, in investigating “the\nlaws of being true” (Sluga 2002: 86). By doing so, logic is\ninterested in truth as such, understood objectively, and not in what\nis merely taken to be true. Now, if one admits that truth is a\nspecific abstract object (the corresponding truth value), then logic\nin the first place has to explore the features of this object and its\ninterrelations to other entities of various other kinds. \nA prominent adherent of this conception was Jan Łukasiewicz. As\nhe paradigmatically put it: \nAll true propositions denote one and the same object, namely truth,\nand all false propositions denote one and the same object, namely\nfalsehood. I consider truth and falsehood to be singular\nobjects in the same sense as the number 2 or 4 is. …\nOntologically, truth has its analogue in being, and falsehood, in\nnon-being. The objects denoted by propositions are called logical\nvalues. Truth is the positive, and falsehood is the negative\nlogical value. … Logic is the science of objects of a special\nkind, namely a science of logical values. (Łukasiewicz\n1970: 90)  \nThis definition may seem rather unconventional, for logic is usually\ntreated as the science of correct reasoning and valid inference. The\nlatter understanding, however, calls for further justification. This\nbecomes evident, as soon as one asks, on what grounds one\nshould qualify this or that pattern of reasoning as correct or\nincorrect. \nIn answering this question, one has to take into account that any\nvalid inference should be based on logical rules which, according to a\ncommonly accepted view, should at least guarantee that in a valid\ninference the conclusion(s) is (are) true if all the premises are\ntrue. Translating this demand into the Fregean terminology, it would\nmean that in the course of a correct inference the possession of the\ntruth value The True should be preserved from the\npremises to the conclusion(s). Thus, granting the realistic treatment\nof truth values adopted by Frege, the understanding of logic as the\nscience of truth values in fact provides logical rules with an\nontological justification placing the roots of logic in a certain kind\nof ideal entities (see Shramko 2014). \nThese entities constitute a certain uniform domain, which can be\nviewed as a subdomain of Frege’s so-called “third\nrealm” (the realm of the objective content of thoughts, and\ngenerally abstract objects of various kinds, see Frege 1918, cf.\nPopper 1972 and also Burge 1992: 634). Among the subdomains of this\nthird realm one finds, e.g., the collection of mathematical objects\n(numbers, classes, etc.). The set of truth values may be regarded as\nforming another such subdomain, namely the one of logical\nvalues, and logic as a branch of science rests essentially on\nthis logical domain and on exploring its features and\nregularities. \nAccording to Frege, there are exactly two truth values, the\nTrue and the False. This opinion appears to be rather\nrestrictive, and one may ask whether it is really indispensable for\nthe concept of a truth value. One should observe that in elaborating\nthis conception, Frege assumed specific requirements of his system of\nthe Begriffsschrift, especially the principle of bivalence\ntaken as a metatheoretical principle, viz. that there exist only two\ndistinct logical values. On the object-language level this principle\nfinds its expression in the famous classical laws of excluded middle\nand non-contradiction. The further development of modern logic,\nhowever, has clearly demonstrated that classical logic is only one\nparticular theory (although maybe a very distinctive one) among the\nvast variety of logical systems. In fact, the Fregean ontological\ninterpretation of truth values depicts logical principles as a kind of\nontological postulations, and as such they may well be modified or\neven abandoned. For example, by giving up the principle of bivalence,\none is naturally led to the idea of postulating many truth\nvalues. \nIt was Łukasiewicz, who as early as 1918 proposed to take\nseriously other logical values different from truth and falsehood (see\nŁukasiewicz 1918, 1920). Independently of Łukasiewicz, Emil\nPost in his dissertation from 1920, published as Post 1921, introduced\n\\(m\\)-valued truth tables, where \\(m\\) is any positive integer.\nWhereas Post’s interest in many-valued logic (where\n“many” means “more than two”) was almost\nexclusively mathematical, Łukasiewicz’s motivation was\nphilosophical (see the entry on\n many-valued logic).\n He contemplated the semantical value of sentences about the\ncontingent future, as discussed in Aristotle’s De\ninterpretatione. Łukasiewicz introduced a third truth value\nand interpreted it as “possible”. By generalizing this\nidea and also adopting the above understanding of the subject-matter\nof logic, one naturally arrives at the representation of particular\nlogical systems as a certain kind of valuation systems (see,\ne.g., Dummett 1981, 2000; Ryan and Sadler 1992). \nConsider a propositional language \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) built upon a set of\natomic sentences \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) and a set of propositional\nconnectives \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) (the set of sentences of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\)\nbeing the smallest set containing \\(\\mathcal{P}\\) and being closed\nunder the connectives from \\(\\mathcal{C})\\). Then a valuation\nsystem \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) for the language \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is a\ntriple \\(\\langle \\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{D}, \\mathcal{F}\\rangle\\), where\n\\(\\mathcal{V}\\) is a non-empty set with at least two elements,\n\\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is a subset of \\(\\mathcal{V}\\), and\n\\(\\mathcal{F} = \\{f_{c _1},\\ldots, f_{c _m}\\}\\) is a set of functions\nsuch that \\(f_{c _i}\\) is an \\(n\\)-place function on \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)\nif \\(c_i\\) is an \\(n\\)-place connective. Intuitively, \\(\\mathcal{V}\\)\nis the set of truth values, \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is the set of\ndesignated truth values, and \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is the set of\ntruth-value functions interpreting the elements of \\(\\mathcal{C}\\). If\nthe set of truth values of a valuation system \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) has \\(n\\)\nelements, \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) is said to be \\(n\\)-valued. Any valuation\nsystem can be equipped with an assignment function which maps the set\nof atomic sentences into \\(\\mathcal{V}\\). Each assignment \\(a\\)\nrelative to a valuation system \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) can be extended to all\nsentences of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) by means of a valuation function \\(v_a\\)\ndefined in accordance with the following conditions: \nIt is interesting to observe that the elements of \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) are\nsometimes referred to as quasi truth values. Siegfried\nGottwald (1989: 2) explains that one reason for using the term\n‘quasi truth value’ is that there is no convincing and\nuniform interpretation of the truth values that in many-valued logic\nare assumed in addition to the classical truth values the\nTrue and the False, an understanding that, according to\nGottwald, associates the additional values with the naive\nunderstanding of being true, respectively the naive understanding of\ndegrees of being true (cf. also the remark by Font (2009:\n383) that “[o]ne of the main problems in many-valued logic, at\nleast in its initial stages, was the interpretation of the\n‘intermediate’ or ‘non-classical’\nvalues”, et seq.). In later publications, Gottwald has changed\nhis terminology and states that  \n[t]o avoid any confusion with the case of classical logic one prefers\nin many-valued logic to speak of truth degrees and to use the\nword “truth value” only for classical logic. (Gottwald\n2001: 4)  \nNevertheless in what follows the term ‘truth values’ will\nbe used even in the context of many-valued logics, without any\ncommitment to a philosophical conception of truth as a graded notion\nor a specific understanding of semantical values in addition to the\nclassical truth values. \nSince the cardinality of \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) may be greater than 2, the\nnotion of a valuation system provides a natural foundational framework\nfor the very idea of a many-valued logic. The set \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) of\ndesignated values is of central importance for the notion of a\nvaluation system. This set can be seen as a generalization of the\nclassical truth value the True in the sense that it\ndetermines many central logical notions and thereby generalizes some\nof the important roles played by Frege’s the True (cf.\nthe introductory remarks about uses of truth values). For example, the\nset of tautologies (logical laws) is directly specified by the given\nset of designated truth values: a sentence \\(A\\) is a\ntautology in a valuation system \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) iff for every\nassignment \\(a\\) relative to \\(\\mathbf{V}\\), \\(v_a(A) \\in\n\\mathcal{D}\\). Another fundamental logical notion—that of an\nentailment relation—can also be defined by referring to the set\n\\(\\mathcal{D}\\). For a given valuation system \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) a\ncorresponding entailment relation \\((\\vDash_V)\\) is usually defined by\npostulating the preservation of designated values from the premises to\nthe conclusion: \nA pair \\(\\mathcal{M} = \\langle \\mathbf{V}, v_a\\rangle\\), where\n\\(\\mathbf{V}\\) is an \\((n\\)-valued) valuation system and \\(v_a\\) a\nvaluation in \\(\\mathbf{V}\\), may be called an \\((n\\)-valued)\nmodel based on \\(\\mathbf{V}\\). Every model \\(\\mathcal{M} =\n\\langle \\mathbf{V}, v_a\\rangle\\) comes with a corresponding entailment\nrelation \\(\\vDash_{\\mathcal{M}}\\) by defining\n\\(Δ\\vDash_{\\mathcal{M} }A\\textrm{ iff }(\\forall B \\in Δ:\nv_a (B) \\in \\mathcal{D}) \\Rightarrow v_a(A) \\in \\mathcal{D}\\). \nSuppose \\(\\mathfrak{L}\\) is a syntactically defined logical system\n\\(\\mathfrak{L}\\) with a consequence relation \\(\\vdash_{ \\mathfrak{L}\n}\\), specified as a relation between the power-set of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\)\nand \\(\\mathcal{L}\\). Then a valuational system \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) is said\nto be strictly characteristic for \\(\\mathfrak{L}\\) just in\ncase \\(Δ\\vDash_V A \\textrm{ iff } Δ\\vdash_{ \\mathfrak{L}\n}A\\) (see Dummett 1981: 431). Conversely, one says that\n\\(\\mathfrak{L}\\) is characterized by \\(\\mathbf{V}\\). Thus, if\na valuation system is said to determine a logic, the\nvaluation system by itself is, properly speaking,\nnot a logic, but only serves as a semantic basis for some\nlogical system. Valuation systems are often referred to as\n(logical) matrices. Note that in Urquhart 1986, the\nset \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) of designated elements of a matrix is required to\nbe non-empty, and in Dunn & Hardegree 2001, \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is\nrequired to be a non-empty proper subset of \\(\\mathbf{V}\\). With a\nview on semantically defining a many-valued logic, these restrictions\nare very natural and have been taken up in Shramko & Wansing 2011\nand elsewhere. For the characterization of consequence relations (see\nthe supplementary document\n Suszko’s Thesis), however, the restrictions do not apply.   \nIn this way Fregean, i.e., classical, logic can be presented as\ndetermined by a particular valuation system based on exactly two\nelements: \\(\\mathbf{V}_{cl} = \\langle \\{T, F\\}, \\{T\\}, \\{ f_{\\wedge},\nf_{\\vee}, f_{\\rightarrow}, f_{\\sim}\\}\\rangle\\), where \\(f_{\\wedge},\nf_{\\vee}, f_{\\rightarrow},f_{\\sim}\\) are given by the classical truth\ntables for conjunction, disjunction, material implication, and\nnegation. \nAs an example for a valuation system based on more that two elements,\nconsider two well-known valuation systems which determine\nKleene’s (strong) “logic of indeterminacy” \\(K_3\\)\nand Priest’s “logic of paradox” \\(P_3\\). In a\npropositional language without implication, \\(K_3\\) is specified by\nthe Kleene matrix \\(\\mathbf{K}_3 = \\langle \\{T, I, F\\},\n\\{T\\}, \\{ f_c: c \\in \\{\\sim , \\wedge , \\vee \\}\\} \\rangle\\), where the\nfunctions \\(f_c\\) are defined as follows: \nThe Priest matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}_3\\) differs from\n\\(\\mathbf{K}_3\\) only in that \\(\\mathcal{D} = \\{T, I\\}\\). Entailment\nin \\(\\mathbf{K}_3\\) as well as in \\(\\mathbf{P}_3\\) is defined by means\nof\n (3). \nThere are natural intuitive interpretations of \\(I\\) in\n\\(\\mathbf{K}_3\\) and in \\(\\mathbf{P}_3\\) as the\nunderdetermined and the overdetermined value\nrespectively—a truth-value gap and a truth-value glut. Formally\nthese interpretations can be modeled by presenting the values as\ncertain subsets of the set of classical truth values \\(\\{T, F\\}\\).\nThen \\(T\\) turns into \\(\\mathbf{T} = \\{T\\}\\) (understood as\n“true only”), \\(F\\) into \\(\\mathbf{F} = \\{F\\}\\)\n(“false only”), \\(I\\) is interpreted in \\(K_3\\) as\n\\(\\mathbf{N} = \\{\\} = \\varnothing\\) (“neither true nor\nfalse”), and in \\(P_3\\) as \\(\\mathbf{B} = \\{T, F\\}\\)\n(“both true and false”). (Note that also Asenjo\n(1966) considers the same truth-tables with an interpretation of the\nthird value as “antinomic”.) The designatedness of a truth\nvalue can be understood in both cases as containment of the classical\n\\(T\\) as a member. \nIf one combines all these new values into a joint framework, one\nobtains the four-valued logic \\(B_4\\) introduced by Dunn and Belnap\n(Dunn 1976; Belnap 1977a,b). A Gentzen-style formulation can be found\nin Font (1997: 7)). This logic is determined by the Belnap\nmatrix \\(\\mathbf{B}_4 = \\langle \\{\\mathbf{N}, \\mathbf{T},\n\\mathbf{F}, \\mathbf{B}\\}, \\{\\mathbf{T}, \\mathbf{B}\\}, \\{ f_c: c \\in\n\\{\\sim , \\wedge , \\vee \\}\\}\\rangle\\), where the functions \\(f_c\\) are\ndefined as follows: \nDefinition (3) applied to the Belnap matrix\n determines the entailment relation of \\(\\mathbf{B}_4\\). This\n entailment relation is formalized as the well-known logic of\n “first-degree entailment” (\\(E_{fde}\\)) introduced in\n Anderson & Belnap 1975 (see also Omori and Wansing 2017). \nThe syntactic notion of a single-conclusion consequence relation has\nbeen extensively studied by representatives of the Polish school of\nlogic, most notably by Alfred Tarski, who in fact initiated this line\nof research (see Tarski 1930a,b; cf. also Wójcicki 1988). In\nview of certain key features of a standard consequence relation it is\nquite remarkable—as well as important—that any entailment\nrelation \\(\\vDash_V\\) defined as above has the following structural\nproperties (see Ryan and Sadler 1992: 34): \nMoreover, for every \\(A \\in \\mathcal{L}\\), every \\(Δ \\subseteq\n\\mathcal{L}\\), and every uniform substitution function \\(σ\\) on\n\\(\\mathcal{L}\\) the following Substitution property holds\n(\\(σ(Δ)\\) stands for \\(\\{ σ(B) \\mid B \\in\nΔ\\})\\): \n(The function of uniform substitution \\(σ\\) is defined as follows.\nLet \\(B\\) be a formula in \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), let \\(p_1,\\ldots, p_n\\) be\nall the propositional variables occurring in \\(B\\), and let\n\\(σ(p_1) = A_1,\\ldots , σ(p_n) = A_n\\) for some formulas\n\\(A_1 ,\\ldots ,A_n\\). Then \\(σ(B)\\) is the formula that results\nfrom B by substituting simultaneously \\(A_1\\),…, \\(A_n\\) for\nall occurrences of \\(p_1,\\ldots, p_n\\), respectively.) \nIf \\(\\vDash_V\\) in the conditions\n (4)–(6)\n is replaced by \\(\\vdash_{ \\mathfrak{L} }\\), then one obtains what is\noften called a Tarskian consequence relation. If additionally\na consequence relation has the substitution property\n (7),\n then it is called structural. Thus, any entailment relation\ndefined for a given valuation system \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) presents an\nimportant example of a consequence relation, in that \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) is\nstrictly characteristic for some logical system \\(\\mathfrak{L}\\) with\na structural Tarskian consequence relation. \nGenerally speaking, the framework of valuation systems not only\nperfectly suits the conception of logic as the science of truth\nvalues, but also turns out to be an effective technical tool for\nresolving various sophisticated and important problems in modern\nlogic, such as soundness, completeness, independence of axioms,\netc. \nThe term ‘truth degrees’, used by Gottwald and many other\nauthors, suggests that truth comes by degrees, and these degrees may\nbe seen as truth values in an extended sense. The idea of truth as a\ngraded notion has been applied to model vague predicates and to obtain\na solution to the Sorites Paradox, the Paradox of the Heap (see the\nentry on the\n Sorites Paradox).\n However, the success of applying many-valued logic to the problem of\nvagueness is highly controversial. Timothy Williamson (1994: 97), for\nexample, holds that the phenomenon of higher-order vagueness\n“makes most work on many-valued logic irrelevant to the problem\nof vagueness”. \nIn any case, the vagueness of concepts has been much debated in\nphilosophy (see the entry on\n vagueness)\n and it was one of the major motivations for the development of\nfuzzy logic (see the entry on\n fuzzy logic).\n In the 1960s, Lotfi Zadeh (1965) introduced the notion of a fuzzy\nset. A characteristic function of a set \\(X\\) is a mapping which\nis defined on a superset \\(Y\\) of \\(X\\) and which indicates membership\nof an element in \\(X\\). The range of the characteristic function of a\nclassical set \\(X\\) is the two-element set \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) (which may be\nseen as the set of classical truth values). The function assigns the\nvalue 1 to elements of \\(X\\) and the value 0 to all elements of \\(Y\\)\nnot in \\(X\\). A fuzzy set has a membership function ranging over the\nreal interval [0,1]. A vague predicate such as ‘is much earlier\nthan March 20th, 1963’, ‘is beautiful’,\nor ‘is a heap’ may then be regarded as denoting a fuzzy\nset. The membership function \\(g\\) of the fuzzy set denoted by\n‘is much earlier than March 20th, 1963’ thus\nassigns values (seen as truth degrees) from the interval [0, 1] to\nmoments in time, for example \\(g\\)(1p.m., August 1st, 2006)\n\\(= 0\\), \\(g\\)(3a.m., March 19th, 1963) \\(= 0\\),\n\\(g\\)(9:16a.m., April 9th, 1960) \\(= 0.005\\), \\(g\\)(2p.m.,\nAugust 13th, 1943) \\(= 0.05\\), \\(g\\)(7:02a.m., December\n2nd, 1278) \\(= 1\\). \nThe application of continuum-valued logics to the Sorites Paradox has\nbeen suggested by Joseph Goguen (1969). The Sorites Paradox in its\nso-called conditional form is obtained by repeatedly applying\nmodus ponens in arguments such as: \nWhereas it seems that all premises are acceptable, because the first\npremise is true and one grain does not make a difference to a\ncollection of grains being a heap or not, the conclusion is, of\ncourse, unacceptable. If the predicate ‘is a heap’ denotes\na fuzzy set and the conditional is interpreted as implication in\nŁukasiewicz’s continuum-valued logic, then the Sorites\nParadox can be avoided. The truth-function \\(f_{\\rightarrow}\\) of\nŁukasiewicz’s implication \\(\\rightarrow\\) is defined by\nstipulating that if \\(x \\le y\\), then \\(f_{\\rightarrow}(x, y) = 1\\),\nand otherwise \\(f_{\\rightarrow}(x, y) = 1 - (x - y)\\). If, say, the\ntruth value of the sentence ‘A collection of 500 grains of sand\nis a heap’ is 0.8 and the truth value of ‘A collection of\n499 grains of sand is a heap’ is 0.7, then the truth value of\nthe implication ‘If a collection of 500 grains of sand is a\nheap, then a collection 499 grains of sand is a heap.’ is 0.9.\nMoreover, if the acceptability of a statement is defined as having a\nvalue greater than \\(j\\) for \\(0 \\lt j \\lt 1\\) and all the conditional\npremises of the Sorites Paradox do not fall below the value \\(j\\),\nthen modus ponens does not preserve acceptability, because\nthe conclusion of the Sorites Argument, being evaluated as 0, is\nunacceptable. \nAlasdair Urquhart (1986: 108) stresses  \nthe extremely artificial nature of the attaching of precise numerical\nvalues to sentences like … “Picasso’s\nGuernica is beautiful”.  \nTo overcome the problem of assigning precise values to predications of\nvague concepts, Zadeh (1975) introduced fuzzy truth values as\ndistinct from the numerical truth values in [0, 1], the former being\nfuzzy subsets of the set [0, 1], understood as true, very\ntrue, not very true, etc. \nThe interpretation of continuum-valued logics in terms of fuzzy set\ntheory has for some time be seen as defining the field of mathematical\nfuzzy logic. Susan Haack (1996) refers to such systems of mathematical\nfuzzy logic as “base logics” of fuzzy logic and reserves\nthe term ‘fuzzy logics’ for systems in which the truth\nvalues themselves are fuzzy sets. Fuzzy logic in Zadeh’s latter\nsense has been thoroughly criticized from a philosophical point of\nview by Haack (1996) for its “methodological\nextravagances” and its linguistic incorrectness. Haack\nemphasizes that her criticisms of fuzzy logic do not apply to the base\nlogics. Moreover, it should be pointed out that mathematical fuzzy\nlogics are nowadays studied not in the first place as continuum-valued\nlogics, but as many-valued logics related to residuated lattices (see\nHajek 1998; Cignoli et al. 2000; Gottwald 2001; Galatos\net al. 2007), whereas fuzzy logic in the broad sense is to a\nlarge extent concerned with certain engineering methods. \nA fundamental concern about the semantical treatment of vague\npredicates is whether an adequate semantics should be\ntruth-functional, that is, whether the truth value of a complex\nformula should depend functionally on the truth values of its\nsubformulas. Whereas mathematical fuzzy logic is truth-functional,\nWilliamson (1994: 97) holds that “the nature of vagueness is not\ncaptured by any approach that generalizes truth-functionality”.\nAccording to Williamson, the degree of truth of a conjunction, a\ndisjunction, or a conditional just fails to be a function of the\ndegrees of truth of vague component sentences. The sentences\n‘John is awake’ and ‘John is asleep’, for\nexample, may have the same degree of truth. By truth-functionality the\nsentences ‘If John is awake, then John is awake’ and\n‘If John is awake, then John is asleep’ are alike in truth\ndegree, indicating for Williamson the failure of\ndegree-functionality. \nOne way of in a certain sense non-truthfunctionally reasoning about\nvagueness is supervaluationism. The method of supervaluations has been\ndeveloped by Henryk Mehlberg (1958) and Bas van Fraassen (1966) and\nhas later been applied to vagueness by Kit Fine (1975), Rosanna Keefe\n(2000) and others. \nVan Fraassen’s aim was to develop a semantics for sentences\ncontaining non-denoting singular terms. Even if one grants atomic\nsentences containing non-denoting singular terms and that some\nattributions of vague predicates are neither true nor false, it\nnevertheless seems natural not to preclude that compound sentences of\na certain shape containing non-denoting terms or vague predications\nare either true or false, e.g., sentences of the form\n‘If \\(A\\), then \\(A\\)’. Supervaluational semantics\nprovides a solution to this problem. A three-valued assignment \\(a\\)\ninto \\(\\{T, I, F\\}\\) may assign a truth-value gap (or rather the value\n\\(I)\\) to the vague sentence ‘Picasso’s Guernica\nis beautiful’. Any classical assignment \\(a'\\) that agrees with\n\\(a\\) whenever \\(a\\) assigns \\(T\\) or \\(F\\) may be seen as a\nprecisification (or superassignment) of \\(a\\). A sentence may than be\nsaid to be supertrue under assignment \\(a\\) if it is true under every\nprecisification \\(a'\\) of \\(a\\). Thus, if \\(a\\) is a three-valued\nassignment into \\(\\{T, I, F\\}\\) and \\(a'\\) is a two-valued assignment\ninto \\(\\{T, F\\}\\) such that \\(a(p) = a'(p)\\) if \\(a(p) \\in \\{T, F\\}\\),\nthen \\(a'\\) is said to be a superassignment of \\(a\\). It\nturns out that if \\(a\\) is an assignment extended to a valuation\nfunction \\(v_a\\) for the Kleene matrix \\(\\mathbf{K}_3\\), then for\nevery formula \\(A\\) in the language of \\(\\mathbf{K}_3\\), \\(v_a (A) =\nv_{a'}(A)\\) if \\(v_a (A) \\in \\{T, F\\}\\). Therefore, the function\n\\(v_{a'}\\) may be called a supervaluation of \\(v_a\\). A\nformula is then said to be supertrue under a valuation\nfunction \\(v_a\\) for \\(\\mathbf{K}_3\\) if it is true under every\nsupervaluation \\(v_{a'}\\) of \\(v_a\\), i.e., if \\(v_{a'}(A) = T\\) for\nevery supervaluation \\(v_{a'}\\) of \\(v_a\\). The property of being\nsuperfalse is defined analogously. \nSince every supervaluation is a classical valuation, every classical\ntautology is supertrue under every valuation function in\n\\(\\mathbf{K}_3\\). Supervaluationism is, however, not truth-functional\nwith respect to supervalues. The supervalue of a disjunction, for\nexample, does not depend on the supervalue of the disjuncts. Suppose\n\\(a(p) = I\\). Then \\(a(\\neg p) = I\\) and \\(v_{a'} (p\\vee \\neg p) = T\\)\nfor every supervaluation \\(v_{a'}\\) of \\(v_a\\). Whereas \\((p\\vee \\neg\np)\\) is thus supertrue under \\(v_a,p\\vee p\\) is not, because\nthere are superassignments \\(a'\\) of \\(a\\) with \\(a'(p) = F\\). An\nargument against the charge that supervaluationism requires a\nnon-truth-functional semantics of the connectives can be found in\nMacFarlane (2008) (cf. also other references given there). \nAlthough the possession of supertruth is preserved from the premises\nto the conclusion(s) of valid inferences in supervaluationism, and\nalthough it might be tempting to consider supertruth an abstract\nobject on its own, it seems that it has never been suggested to\nhypostatize supertruth in this way, comparable to Frege’s\nthe True. A sentence supertrue under a three-valued valuation\n\\(v\\) just takes the Fregean value the True under every\nsupervaluation of \\(v\\). The advice not to confuse supertruth with\n“real truth” can be found in Belnap (2009). \nOne might, perhaps, think that the mere existence of many-valued\nlogics shows that there exist infinitely, in fact, uncountably many\ntruth values. However, this is not at all clear (recall the more\ncautious use of terminology advocated by Gottwald). \nIn the 1970’s Roman Suszko (1977: 377) declared many-valued\nlogic to be “a magnificent conceptual deceit”. Suszko\nactually claimed that “there are but two logical values, true\nand false” (Caleiro et al. 2005: 169), a statement now\ncalled Suszko’s Thesis. For Suszko, the set of truth\nvalues assumed in a logical matrix for a many-valued logic is a set of\n“admissible referents” (called “algebraic\nvalues”) of formulas but not a set of logical values. Whereas\nthe algebraic values are elements of an algebraic structure and\nreferents of formulas, the logical value true is used to\ndefine valid consequence: If every premise is true, then so is (at\nleast one of) the conclusion(s). The other logical value,\nfalse, is preserved in the opposite direction: If the (every)\nconclusion is false, then so is at least one of the premises. The\nlogical values are thus represented by a bi-partition of the set of\nalgebraic values into a set of designated values (truth) and its\ncomplement (falsity). \nEssentially the same idea has been taken up earlier by Dummett (1959)\nin an influential paper, where he asks  \nwhat point there may be in distinguishing between different ways in\nwhich a statement may be true or between different ways in which it\nmay be false, or, as we might say, between degrees of truth and\nfalsity. (Dummett 1959: 153)  \nDummett observes that, first,  \nthe sense of a sentence is determined wholly by knowing the case in\nwhich it has a designated value and the cases in which it has an\nundesignated one,  \nand moreover,  \nfiner distinctions between different designated values or different\nundesignated ones, however naturally they come to us, are justified\nonly if they are needed in order to give a truth-functional account of\nthe formation of complex statements by means of operators. (Dummett\n1959: 155)  \nSuszko’s claim evidently echoes this observation by Dummett. \nSuszko’s Thesis is substantiated by a rigorous proof (the Suszko\nReduction) showing that every structural Tarskian consequence relation\nand therefore also every structural Tarskian many-valued propositional\nlogic is characterized by a bivalent semantics. (Note also that\nRichard Routley (1975) has shown that every logic based on a\nλ-categorical language has a sound and complete bivalent\npossible worlds semantics.) The dichotomy between designated values\nand values which are not designated and its use in the definition of\nentailment plays a crucial role in the Suszko Reduction. Nevertheless,\nwhile it seems quite natural to construe the set of designated values\nas a generalization of the classical truth value \\(T\\) in some of its\nsignificant roles, it would not always be adequate to interpret the\nset of non-designated values as a generalization of the classical\ntruth value \\(F\\). The point is that in a many-valued logic, unlike in\nclassical logic, “not true” does not always mean\n“false” (cf., e.g., the above interpretation of\nKleene’s logic, where sentences can be neither true nor\nfalse). \nIn the literature on many-valued logic it is sometimes proposed to\nconsider a set of antidesignated values which not\nobligatorily constitute the complement of the set of designated values\n(see, e.g., Rescher 1969, Gottwald 2001). The set of antidesignated\nvalues can be regarded as representing a generalized concept of\nfalsity. This distinction leaves room for values that are\nneither designated nor antidesignated and even for\nvalues that are both designated and\nantidesignated. \nGrzegorz Malinowski (1990, 1994) takes advantage of this proposal to\ngive a counterexample to Suszko’s Thesis. He defines the notion\nof a single-conclusion quasi-consequence \\((q\\)-consequence)\nrelation. The semantic counterpart of \\(q\\)-consequence is called\n\\(q\\)-entailment. Single-conclusion \\(q\\)-entailment is defined by\nrequiring that if no premise is antidesignated, the conclusion is\ndesignated. Malinowski (1990) proved that for every structural\n\\(q\\)-consequence relation, there exists a characterizing class of\n\\(q\\)-matrices, matrices which in addition to a subset\n\\(\\mathcal{D}^{+}\\) of designated values comprise a disjoint subset\n\\(\\mathcal{D}^-\\) of antidesignated values. Not every\n\\(q\\)-consequence relation has a bivalent semantics. \nIn the supplementary document\n Suszko’s Thesis,\n Suszko’s reduction is introduced, Malinowski’s\ncounterexample to Suszko’s Thesis is outlined, and a short\nanalysis of these results is presented. \nCan one provide evidence for a multiplicity of logical values? More\nconcretely, \\(is\\) there more than one logical value, each of which\nmay be taken to determine its own (independent) entailment relation? A\npositive answer to this question emerges from considerations on truth\nvalues as structured entities which, by virtue of their internal\nstructure, give rise to natural partial orderings on the set of\nvalues. \nAs soon as one admits that truth values come with valuation\nsystems, it is quite natural to assume that the elements of\nsuch a system are somehow interrelated. And indeed, already\nthe valuation system for classical logic constitutes a well-known\nalgebraic structure, namely the two-element Boolean algebra with\n\\(\\cap\\) and \\(\\cup\\) as meet and join operators (see the entry on the\n mathematics of Boolean algebra).\n In its turn, this Boolean algebra forms a lattice with a partial\norder defined by \\(a\\le_t b \\textrm{ iff } a\\cap b = a\\). This\nlattice may be referred to as TWO. It is easy to see that the\nelements of TWO are ordered as follows: \\(F\\le_t T\\). This\nordering is sometimes called the truth order (as indicated by\nthe corresponding subscript), for intuitively it expresses an increase\nin truth: \\(F\\) is “less true” than \\(T\\). It can be\nschematically presented by means of a so-called Hasse-diagram as in\nFigure 1. \nFigure 1: Lattice TWO \nIt is also well-known that the truth values of both Kleene’s and\nPriest’s logic can be ordered to form a lattice\n(THREE), which is diagrammed in Figure 2. \nFigure 2: Lattice THREE \nHere \\(\\le_t\\) orders \\(T, I\\) and \\(F\\) so that the intermediate\nvalue \\(I\\) is “more true” than \\(F\\), but “less\ntrue” than \\(T\\). \nThe relation \\(\\le_t\\) is also called a logical order,\nbecause it can be used to determine key logical notions: logical\nconnectives and an entailment relation. Namely, if the elements of the\ngiven valuation system \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) form a lattice, then the\noperations of meet and join with respect to \\(\\le_t\\) are usually seen\nas the functions for conjunction and disjunction, whereas negation can\nbe represented by the inversion of this order. Moreover, one can\nconsider an entailment relation for \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) as expressing\nagreement with the truth order, that is, the conclusion should be at\nleast as true as the premises taken together: \nwhere \\(\\Pi_t\\) is the lattice meet in the corresponding lattice. \nThe Belnap matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}_4\\) considered above also can be\nrepresented as a partially ordered valuation system. The set of truth\nvalues \\(\\{\\mathbf{N}, \\mathbf{T}, \\mathbf{F}, \\mathbf{B}\\}\\) from\n\\(\\mathbf{B}_4\\) constitutes a specific algebraic structure –\nthe bilattice FOUR\\(_2\\) presented in Figure 3 (see, e.g.,\nGinsberg 1988, Arieli and Avron 1996, Fitting 2006). \nFigure 3: The bilattice\nFOUR\\(_2\\) \nThis bilattice is equipped with two partial orderings; in\naddition to a truth order, there is an information order \\((\\le_i )\\)\nwhich is said to order the values under consideration according to the\ninformation they give concerning a formula to which they are assigned.\nLattice meet and join with respect to \\(\\le_t\\) coincide with the\nfunctions \\(f_{\\wedge}\\) and \\(f_{\\vee}\\) in the Belnap matrix\n\\(\\mathbf{B}_4\\), \\(f_{{\\sim}}\\) turns out to be the truth order\ninversion, and an entailment relation, which happens to coincide with\nthe matrix entailment, is defined by\n (8).\n FOUR\\(_2\\) arises as a combination of two structures: the\napproximation lattice \\(A_4\\) and the logical lattice \\(L_4\\) which\nare discussed in Belnap 1977a and 1977b (see also, Anderson, Belnap\nand Dunn 1992: 510–518)). \nFrege (1892: 30) points out the possibility of “distinctions of\nparts within truth values”. Although he immediately specifies\nthat the word ‘part’ is used here “in a special\nsense”, the basic idea seems nevertheless to be that truth\nvalues are not something amorphous, but possess some inner structure.\nIt is not quite clear how serious Frege is about this view, but it\nseems to suggest that truth values may well be interpreted as complex,\nstructured entities that can be divided into parts. \nThere exist several approaches to semantic constructions where truth\nvalues are represented as being made up from some primitive\ncomponents. For example, in some explications of Kripke models for\nintuitionistic logic propositions (identified with sets of\n“worlds” in a model structure) can be understood as truth\nvalues of a certain kind. Then the empty proposition is interpreted as\nthe value false, and the maximal proposition (the set of all\nworlds in a structure) as the value true. Moreover, one can\nconsider non-empty subsets of the maximal proposition as intermediate\ntruth values. Clearly, the intuitionistic truth values so conceived\nare composed from some simpler elements and as such they turn out to\nbe complex entities. \nAnother prominent example of structured truth values are the\n“truth-value objects” in topos models from category theory\n(see the entry on\n category theory).\n For any topos \\(C\\) and for a \\(C\\)-object Ω one can define a\ntruth value of \\(C\\) as an arrow \\(1 \\rightarrow Ω\\) (“a\nsubobject classifier for \\(C\\)”), where 1 is a terminal object\nin \\(C\\) (cf. Goldblatt 2006: 81, 94). The set of truth values so\ndefined plays a special role in the logical structure of \\(C\\), since\narrows of the form \\(1 \\rightarrow Ω\\) determine central\nsemantical notions for the given topos. And again, these truth values\nevidently have some inner structure. \nOne can also mention in this respect the so-called “factor\nsemantics” for many-valued logic, where truth values are defined\nas ordered \\(n\\)-tuples of classical truth values \\((T\\)-\\(F\\)\nsequences, see Karpenko 1983). Then the value \\(3/5\\), for example,\ncan be interpreted as a \\(T\\)-\\(F\\) sequence of length 5 with exactly\n3 occurrences of \\(T\\). Here the classical values \\(T\\) and \\(F\\) are\nused as “building blocks” for non-classical truth\nvalues. \nMoreover, the idea of truth values as compound entities nicely\nconforms with the modeling of truth values considered above in\nthree-valued (Kleene, Priest) and four-valued (Belnap) logics as\ncertain subsets of the set of classical truth values. The latter\napproach stems essentially from Dunn (1976), where a generalization of\nthe notion of a classical truth-value function has been proposed to\nobtain so-called “underdetermined” and\n“overdetermined” valuations. Namely, Dunn considers a\nvaluation to be a function not from sentences to elements of the set\n\\(\\{T, F\\}\\) but from sentences to subsets of this set (see also Dunn\n2000: 7). By developing this idea, one arrives at the concept of a\ngeneralized truth value function, which is a function from\nsentences into the subsets of some basic set of truth\nvalues (see Shramko and Wansing 2005). The values of generalized\ntruth value functions can be called generalized truth\nvalues. \nBy employing the idea of generalized truth value functions, one can\nobtain a hierarchy of valuation systems starting with a certain\nset-theoretic representation of the valuation system for classical\nlogic. The representation in question is built on a single initial\nvalue which serves then as the designated value of the resulting\nvaluation system. More specifically, consider the singleton\n\\(\\{\\varnothing \\}\\) taken as the basic set subject to a further\ngeneralization procedure. Set-theoretically the basic set can serve as\nthe universal set (the complement of the empty set) for the valuation\nsystem \\(\\mathbf{V}^{\\varnothing}_{cl}\\) introduced below. At the\nfirst stage \\(\\varnothing\\) comes out with no specific intuitive\ninterpretation, it is only important to take it as some\ndistinct unit. Consider then the power-set of \\(\\{\\varnothing\n\\}\\) consisting of exactly two elements: \\(\\{\\{\\varnothing \\},\n\\varnothing \\}\\). Now, these elements can be interpreted as\nFrege’s the True and the False, and thus it is\npossible to construct a valuation system for classical logic,\n\\(\\mathbf{V}^{\\varnothing}_{cl} = \\langle \\{\\{\\varnothing \\},\n\\varnothing \\}, \\{\\{\\varnothing \\}\\}, \\{f_{\\wedge}, f_{\\vee},\nf_{\\rightarrow}, f_{\\sim}\\}\\rangle\\), where the functions\n\\(f_{\\wedge}, f_{\\vee}, f_{\\rightarrow}, f_{\\sim}\\) are defined as\nfollows (for\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nX, Y \\in \\{\\{\\varnothing \\}, \\varnothing \\}:\\quad & f_{\\wedge}(X, Y) = X\\cap Y; \\\\\n& f_{\\vee}(X, Y) = X\\cup Y; \\\\\n& f_{\\rightarrow}(X, Y) = X^{c}\\cup Y; \\\\\n& f_{\\sim}(X) = X^{c}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n It is not difficult to see that for any\nassignment \\(a\\) relative to \\(\\mathbf{V}^{\\varnothing}_{cl}\\), and\nfor any formulas \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the following holds:  \nThis shows that \\(f_{\\wedge}, f_{\\vee}, f_{\\rightarrow}\\) and\n\\(f_{\\sim}\\) determine exactly the propositional connectives of\nclassical logic. One can conveniently mark the elements\n\\(\\{\\varnothing \\}\\) and \\(\\varnothing\\) in the valuation system\n\\(\\mathbf{V}^{\\varnothing}_{cl}\\) by the classical labels \\(T\\) and\n\\(F\\). Note that within \\(\\mathbf{V}^{\\varnothing}_{cl}\\) it is fully\njustifiable to associate \\(\\varnothing\\) with falsity, taking into\naccount the virtual monism of truth characteristic for\nclassical logic, which treats falsity not as an independent entity but\nmerely as the absence of truth. \nThen, by taking the set \\(\\mathbf{2} = \\{F, T\\}\\) of these classical\nvalues as the basic set for the next valuation system, one obtains the\nfour truth values of Belnap’s logic as the power-set of the set\nof classical values \\(\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbf{2}) = \\mathbf{4}: \\mathbf{N}\n= \\varnothing\\), \\(\\mathbf{F} = \\{F\\} (= \\{\\varnothing \\})\\),\n\\(\\mathbf{T} = \\{T\\} (= \\{\\{\\varnothing \\}\\})\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B} =\n\\{F, T\\} (= \\{\\varnothing, \\{\\varnothing \\}\\})\\). In this way,\nBelnap’s four-valued logic emerges as a certain generalization\nof classical logic with its two Fregean truth values. In\nBelnap’s logic truth and falsity are considered to be\nfull-fledged, self-sufficient entities, and therefore \\(\\varnothing\\)\nis now to be interpreted not as falsity, but as a real truth-value gap\n(neither true nor false). The dissimilarity of\nBelnap’s truth and falsity from their classical analogues is\nnaturally expressed by passing from the corresponding classical values\nto their singleton-sets, indicating thus their new interpretations as\nfalse only and true only. Belnap’s\ninterpretation of the four truth values has been critically discussed\nin Lewis 1982 and Dubois 2008 (see also the reply to Dubois in Wansing\nand Belnap 2010). \nGeneralized truth values have a strong intuitive background,\nespecially as a tool for the rational explication of incomplete and\ninconsistent information states. In particular, Belnap’s\nheuristic interpretation of truth values as information that\n“has been told to a computer” (see Belnap 1977a,b; also\nreproduced in Anderson, Belnap and Dunn 1992, §81) has been\nwidely acknowledged. As Belnap points out, a computer may receive data\nfrom various (maybe independent) sources. Belnap’s\ncomputers have to take into account various kinds of information\nconcerning a given sentence. Besides the standard (classical) cases,\nwhen a computer obtains information either that the sentence is (1)\ntrue or that it is (2) false, two other (non-standard) situations are\npossible: (3) nothing is told about the sentence or (4) the sources\nsupply inconsistent information, information that the sentence is true\nand information that it is false. And the four truth values from\n\\(\\mathbf{B}_4\\) naturally correspond to these four situations: there\nis no information that the sentence is false and no information that\nit is true \\((\\mathbf{N})\\), there is merely information that\nthe sentence is false \\((\\mathbf{F})\\), there is merely\ninformation that the sentence is true \\((\\mathbf{T})\\), and there is\ninformation that the sentence is false, but there is also information\nthat it is true \\((\\mathbf{B})\\). \nJoseph Camp in 2002: 125–160 provides Belnap’s four values\nwith quite a different intuitive motivation by developing what he\ncalls a “semantics of confused thought”. Consider a\nrational agent, who happens to mix up two very similar objects (say,\n\\(a\\) and \\(b)\\) and ambiguously uses one name (say,\n‘\\(C\\)’) for both of them. Now let such an agent assert\nsome statement, saying, for instance, that \\(C\\) has some property.\nHow should one evaluate this statement if \\(a\\) has the property in\nquestion whereas \\(b\\) lacks it? Camp argues against ascribing truth\nvalues to such statements and puts forward an “epistemic\nsemantics” in terms of “profitability” and\n“costliness” as suitable characterizations of sentences. A\nsentence \\(S\\) is said to be “profitable” if one would\nprofit from acting on the belief that \\(S\\), and it is said to be\n“costly” if acting on the belief that \\(S\\) would generate\ncosts, for example as measured by failure to achieve an intended goal.\nIf our “confused agent” asks some external observers\nwhether \\(C\\) has the discussed property, the following four answers\nare possible: ‘yes’ (mark the corresponding sentence with\n\\(\\mathbf{Y})\\), ‘no’ (mark it with \\(\\mathbf{N})\\),\n‘cannot say’ (mark it with ?),\n‘yes’ and ‘no’ (mark it with\nY&N). Note that the external observers, who\nprovide answers, are “non-confused” and have different\nobjects in mind as to the referent of ‘\\(C\\)’, in view of\nall the facts that may be relevant here. Camp conceives these four\npossible answers concerning epistemic properties of sentences as a\nkind of “semantic values”, interpreting them as follows:\nthe value \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) is an indicator of profitability, the value\n\\(\\mathbf{N}\\) is an indicator of costliness, the value\n? is no indicator either way, and the value\nY&N is both an indicator of profitability and an\nindicator of costliness. A strict analogy between this\n“semantics of confused reasoning” and Belnap’s four\nvalued logic is straightforward. And indeed, as Camp (2002: 157)\nobserves, the set of implications valid according to his semantics is\nexactly the set of implications of the entailment system \\(E_{fde}\\).\nIn Zaitsev and Shramko 2013 it is demonstrated how ontological and\nepistemic aspects of truth values can be combined within a joint\nsemantical framework. Kapsner (2019) extends Belnap’s framework\nby two additional values “Contestedly-True” and\n“Contestedly-False” which allows for new outcomes for\ndisjunctions and conjunctions between statements with values\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{N}\\). \nThe conception of generalized truth values has its purely logical\nimport as well. If one continues the construction and applies the idea\nof generalized truth value functions to Belnap’s four truth\nvalues, then one obtains further valuation systems which can be\nrepresented by various multilattices. One arrives, in\nparticular, at SIXTEEN\\(_3\\) – the trilattice\nof 16 truth-values, which can be viewed as a basis for a logic of\ncomputer networks (see Shramko and Wansing 2005, 2006; Kamide and\nWansing 2009; Odintsov 2009; Wansing 2010; Odintsov and Wansing 2015;\ncf. also Shramko, Dunn, Takenaka 2001). The notion of a multilattice\nand SIXTEEN\\(_3\\) are discussed further in the supplementary\ndocument\n Generalized truth values and multilattices.\n A comprehensive study of the conception of generalized logical values\ncan be found in Shramko and Wansing 2011. \nGottlob Frege’s notion of a truth value has become part of the\nstandard philosophical and logical terminology. The notion of a truth\nvalue is an indispensable instrument of realistic, model-theoretic\napproaches to semantics. Indeed, truth values play an essential role\nin applications of model-theoretic semantics in areas such as, for\nexample, knowledge representation and theorem proving based on\nsemantic tableaux, which could not be treated in the present entry.\nMoreover, considerations on truth values give rise to deep ontological\nquestions concerning their own nature, the feasibility of fact\nontologies, and the role of truth values in such ontological theories.\nThere also exist well-motivated theories of generalized truth values\nthat lead far beyond Frege’s classical values the True\nand the False.
