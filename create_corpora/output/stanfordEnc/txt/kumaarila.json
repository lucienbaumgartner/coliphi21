Among\nthe most influential thinkers in the history of Indian philosophy, he\nmade significant contributions regarding the full range of issues that\nfollow from that school’s constitutive concern with Vedic authority\nand exegesis; virtually all Indian philosophers writing subsequent to\nhim—and particularly Buddhist philosophers, whose positions were\nmost completely antithetical to his—found it necessary to reckon\nespecially with his work in epistemology and philosophy of\nlanguage. Among the areas in which he exercised lasting influence are\nhermeneutics, poetics, jurisprudence, and (arguably) historiography.\nChief among the doctrines that have occasioned philosophical\ninterest in him is that of svataḥ\nprāmāṇya—“intrinsic\nreliability,” which might be understood as immediate justification—which\nsurely represents Kumārilas most significant epistemological\ncontribution; occasionally dismissed as fundamentalist in spirit, this\nhas come to be appreciated (sometimes in light of the “reformed\nepistemology” advanced by contemporary thinkers such as William\nAlston and Nicholas Wolterstorff) as a cogent working-out of the kinds\nof commonsensical epistemic intuitions characteristic of Thomas\nReid. Together with a robust realism about linguistic universals and\nthe peculiarly Mīmāṃsaka conviction that the Vedic\ntexts are eternal, this epistemology was effectively deployed by\nKumārila to show that a commitment to the uniquely authoritative\nstatus of the Vedas (and to the ritual practices enjoined thereby) was\nrationally held.\n\n\n\nHaving flourished in the latter part of the seventh\ncentury ce, Kumārila Bhaṭṭa\nwas roughly contemporaneous with the Buddhist philosopher\nDharmakīrti, whose own predecessor Dignāga was among the philosophical rivals whom Kumārila critically engaged; Kumārila has long been recognized as a significant influence on his younger contemporary Śaṅkara\n(fl. c. 710). Kumārila thus wrote at a time of profoundly significant\nphilosophical activity in India, contributing much to a pan-Sanskritic\ndiscourse—sometimes referred to as\npramāṇa-śāstra, or the “discipline of epistemic warrants”—that was\ncharacterized by shared standards of rationality and inter-traditional\ndebate. Pressed from all sides by opponents from rival schools of thought, Indian philosophers at this time were keen to maintain the consistency of their various commitments in the face of critique; with all these disputants sharing a Sanskritic philosophical vocabulary that had been refined particularly by Buddhists, India’s philosophical traditions quickly developed in subtlety and sophistication from this point on. \n\nCharacteristic of this period of inter-traditional debate is the\nlegendary account of Kumārila as having studied for a time at the\nfamous Buddhist monastic university at Nālandā, then in its\nprime. Based on the mastery of Buddhist doctrine he thus gained,\nKumārila went on to decisively counter Buddhist\nphilosophical positions. According to a Buddhist variation on such\nlegendary reflections of the state of philosophical contestation (one\nrecorded by the 17th-century Tibetan historian Tāranātha),\nKumārila is indeed represented as having defeated various lesser\nBuddhist thinkers in debate. However, his renown prompted the Buddhist\nDharmakīrti, in turn, to go in disguise to study with\nKumārila,\nfrom whom Dharmakīrti learns\nthe key to Kumārila’s thought and then bests him in debate,\nconverting Kumārila and his followers to Buddhism. As history,\nsuch accounts are surely as suspect as the view (still attested\nin some Indian scholarship) that Kumārila’s dialectical\nsuccesses are chiefly to be credited for the decline of Indian\nBuddhism. Nevertheless, these traditions confirm at least that\nKumārila was a formidable philosophical opponent of his Buddhist\ncounterparts. It is fitting, then, that among the sources for studying\nKumārila’s thought should be not only the texts of\nMīmāṃsaka commentators on his work—particularly Uṃveka\nBhaṭṭa (fl. c. 710), Pārthasārathimiśra (fl.\nc. 1075), and Sucaritamiśra (c.1120)—but also the work of the scholar Buddhist\nŚāntarakṣita (c.725–788), whose massive\nTattvasaṃgraha extensively engages (and quotes from the\nworks of) Kumārila. \n\nIt is sometimes surmised from his evident knowledge of Dravidian\nlanguages (his Tantravārttika includes some discussion of\nTamil word forms) that Kumārila may have been south Indian; as\nis typically the case for the figures of classical Indian philosophy, though,\nhe is really known to us only in the stylized terms of traditional\nhagiographies. What is certain is that Kumārila was one of the two\nmost significant commentators on the foundational texts of the\ntradition of Pūrva Mīmāṃsā; indeed, this\northodox Brahmanical tradition of thought divides chiefly along two\nlines of seventh- and eighth-century commentary, with those\nMīmāṃsakas who take their bearings from Kumārila\nhaving been styled Bhāṭṭas (“followers of\nBhaṭṭa”), while those who defer instead to\nPrabhākara—who flourished around 700, and who is sometimes\nsaid to have been Kumārila’s student—are\ncomparably called “Prābhākaras.” \n\nInsofar as this central divergence between Kumārila and\nPrabhākara involves reference to a shared foundation of texts, it\nis important to appreciate the traditional Brahmanical context for\nKumārila’s thought. “Mīmāṃsā” literally means something like “investigation” or “inquiry,” but here refers particularly to hermeneutical inquiry. Kumārila’s tradition of\nPūrva (“prior”) Mīmāṃsā,\nthen, is typically so denominated in contrast to\n“Uttara,” or “subsequent,”\nMīmāṃsā. \n\nBoth strands of\nMīmāṃsā have as their guiding concern the\ninterpretation and right application of Vedic texts, which these two\nschools agree in thinking to be uniquely authoritative for matters of\nultimate concern. These schools differ chiefly over which portion of\nthis vast corpus of texts should be thought definitive; for\n“Veda”—a scriptural category that is arguably\ndefinitive of “Hinduism”—represents a status\ntraditionally claimed for a huge range of texts, composed over a large\nperiod of time (from c. 1200 bce to early in the first millennium\nand even later), and comprising a wide spectrum of literary genres and\ncharacteristic doctrines. Advocacy of the “Pūrva”\nMīmāṃsā position is defined by commitment to the\nauthority particularly of the earlier portion of the Vedic corpus\n(culminating with texts called Brāhmaṇas), which\nchiefly concerns the performance of ritual sacrifice; hence, the school\nof thought advanced by Kumārila was also well known as Karma\nMīmāṃsā (“hermeneutics of ritual action”) or Adhvara\nMīmāṃsā (“hermeneutics of sacrifice”). In contrast, Uttara\nMīmāṃsā takes its bearings from that portion\nof the Vedic corpus that comprises the Upaniṣads, which were\ntraditionally styled “Vedānta” (“culmination of\nthe Veda”); indeed, the same word is more familiar to many modern readers as denoting Uttara Mīmāṃsā itself. \n\n(On relations between these two\ntraditions of Mīmāṃsā, see the essays in Bronkhorst 2007.) \n\nJust as texts in the many strata of the Vedic corpus mostly represent\nthemselves as in some sense interpreting the texts that precede them,\nso, too, the philosophical tradition of Pūrva\nMīmāṃsā (henceforth, simply\n“Mīmāṃsā”), in this regard typifying the generally scholastic character of first-millennium Indian philosophy, developed in the form of commentaries on the foundational texts of the tradition (and\ncommentaries on the commentaries, etc.). Mīmāṃsakas, as\nadherents of this school are called, thus take their bearings from the\nMīmāṃsā Sūtras attributed to a\ncertain Jaimini, who is thought to have flourished near the beginning\nof the first millennium ce. The first of Jaimini’s\nsūtras (“aphorisms”) names “the desire\nto know dharma”\n(dharmajijñāsā) as the constitutive concern\nof Mīmāṃsā, where dharma is represented\nin early commentary simply as what “connects a person with the\nhighest good.” Among the salient points about the goal thus\ncommended by Mīmāṃsā’s foundational text is\nthat dharma, as here imagined, denotes a constitutively future\nstate of affairs; dharma, Mīmāṃsakas typically\nsay, is always “yet to be” (bhaviṣyat). \n\nThis characterization of dharma can be taken to suggest that\nit has something to do with post-mortem existence states of affairs, which\nwere indeed among the expected results of certain Vedic rites.\n(Early proponents of Mīmāṃsā differed from most other\nIndian philosophical schools in not taking liberation from\nsaṃsāra to be the ultimate desideratum.) The\nperennially subjunctive character of talk of dharma perhaps\nmore significantly reflects, however, the view that Vedic injunctions\nessentially enjoin the ongoing bringing into being\n(bhāvanā) of a ritual world that must continually be\nrenewed; it is insofar as no one ever finishes bringing this\nworld into being that its realization is always still to come. (See, on\nthis idea, Clooney 1990, 129–161.) Philosophically, the significant\npoint is that, as always yet to be realized, the summum\nbonum for Mīmāṃsakas is essentially inaccessible\nto perception, and only language can be thought to represent a way of\nknowing it. This is surely the paramount intuition informing the entire\nMīmāṃsaka project, which centers on confidence in the\nepistemic status of Vedic injunctions and the mind-independent reality\nof language. \n\nTypifying the “sūtra” genre of mnemonic concision,\nJaimini’s aphorisms are often intelligible only with reference to\ncommentaries; the earliest of the completely extant commentaries on\nJaimini’s sūtras is that of Śabara (fl. c. 400 c.e.),\nwhose commentary (which itself quotes from at least one\nno-longer-extant earlier commentary) defines the basic parameters of\nthe tradition’s unfolding. The divergent elaborations of the\nMīmāṃsaka project represented by Kumārila and\nPrabhākara are therefore framed, in turn, as commenting on\nŚabara’s interpretation of the Mīmāṃsā\nSūtras. It is typical, then, for passages from\nKumārila’s corpus to be cited with reference to the section\nof Śabara’s commentary from which they depart—which\neffectively means that Kumārila’s topics can usually be\nreferred to by the particular sūtras of Jaimini upon which\nŚabara was himself commenting. So, for example,\nKumārila’s elaboration of the svataḥ\nprāmāṇya (“immediate justification”)\ndoctrine in epistemology is framed in terms of Śabara’s\ncommentary on Jaimini’s “codanā\nsūtra”—the sūtra, that is, that specifies\nthat Vedic “injunction” (codanā) is the only\nvalid way of knowing dharma. References, then, to the passages\nin which Kumārila develops his signal epistemological contribution\nare typically to the numbered verses of the “codanā\nsūtra” chapter of his\nŚlokavārttika. \n\nThe latter title names one of four works attributed to Kumārila,\nand one of the two most important; it is the\nŚlokavārttika that is typically taken to be of\ngreatest philosophical significance, and it was surely this work that\nwas most recurrently engaged by other Indian philosophers. The\nŚlokavārttika is framed by Śabara’s\ncommentary on the beginning of the first chapter of Jaimini’s\nwork—the part of Śabara’s commentary traditionally\nstyled “Tarkapāda,” or the “part\nconcerning reasoning,” wherein Śabara considers as a\npreliminary matter questions pertaining to whether Vedic texts\nought in the first place to be thought an epistemically reliable basis\nfor action. It is thus in the Ślokavārttika\nthat Kumārila argues for the epistemological and metaphysical\ncommitments relevant to the governing claim that the Vedas are uniquely\nauthoritative for matters of ultimate concern. Typically of the\n“vārttika” genre of commentary,\nKumārila’s “commentary” often significantly\nrevises or elaborates on the thoughts advanced in Śabara’s\ntext, and the novelty of some of Kumārila’s arguments is\ntherefore often clear. Typically, as well, of the inter-traditionally\ncontested period in which he wrote, the epistemological and other\narguments of the Ślokavārttika generally involve\nKumārila’s heavily engaging rival Indian schools of thought\nand showing their alternative positions to fail as defeaters. While the\narguments are in the service of claims (such as that the Vedas are\neternal) that are unlikely to be attractive to modern readers, this\ntext is often a model of philosophical subtlety and sophistication. \n\nThe philosophically rich Ślokavārttika can be\nunderstood, however, as a prolegomenon to the real, hermeneutical\nbusiness of Mīmāṃsā, which is most significantly\nadvanced in Kumārila’s Tantravārttika. Framed\nas a commentary on the remainder of Śabara’s chapter 1\nthrough his chapter 3, this massive work addresses questions raised by\nthe different kinds of sentences to be found in the Vedas, the status\nof Brahmanical literature that is not part of the Vedic corpus, and all\nmanner of grammatical and metaphysical issues pertaining to the\nperformance of Vedic ritual as that is enjoined by sometimes\ninterpretively obscure Vedic texts. In this under-studied text, then,\nthere is much to be learned about Kumārila’s highly ramified\nphilosophy of language, as well as about the ideological and practical\nparticulars of the ritualistic Vedic worldview. In addition to the\nŚlokavārttika and the Tantravārttika,\nKumārila authored the Tupṭīkā, which\ncomments on the remaining balance of Śabara’s commentary;\nand the no-longer-extant Bṛhatṭīkā,\nwhose extensive treatment of many of the concerns of the\nŚlokavārttika is recoverable from the large parts of\nit that are preserved in the Buddhist\nŚāntarakṣita’s Tattvasaṃgraha (see\nFrauwallner 1962). \n\nIt is relevant to begin with Kumārila’s characteristic\nepistemological doctrine not only because this is widely thought to be among his most characteristic philosophical contributions, but also\nbecause Kumārila appeals to the epistemological intuitions\nelaborated in this doctrine in arguing, as well, for a great many of\nhis other claims; indeed, the commonsense realism reflected in\nKumārila’s epistemology represents a useful way into his overall\nphilosophical project, which is shot through with essentially realist\ncommitments. Thus, for example, Kumārila was strongly critical of\nthe doctrine of svasaṃvitti\n(“self-awareness”), which is arguably foundational for the\nBuddhists Dignāga and Dharmakīrti; it is particularly\ninsofar as that doctrine figures in a generally representationalist\nepistemology—one that is to be understood as part of a larger\nBuddhist case for epistemic and perhaps even metaphysical\nidealism—that Kumārila will have no truck with the idea,\ninstead affirming that what we are immediately aware of is just the\nordinary objects we typically take ourselves to be aware of.\nKumārila’s guiding intuition, then, is that we are generally\njustified in taking awareness as veridically disclosing precisely the\nkind of world it seems to us to disclose. \n\nKumārila’s development of a comprehensive epistemological\norientation along these lines is occasioned by Śabara’s\ncommentary on the second of Jaimini’s\nMīmāṃsā Sūtras. So, having announced\nin the first sūtra that the “desire to know\ndharma” is the constitutive concern of\nMīmāṃsā, Jaimini then says in the second\nsūtra that “dharma is a goal defined by [Vedic]\ninjunction (codanā)”—that, in other words,\nwhat is epistemically authoritative with respect to what\nMīmāṃsakas take to be the summum bonum is just\nthe texts of the Vedas (and more precisely, those injunctive passage\nthat enjoin the execution of particular ritual acts). This amounts to\nthe generally epistemological claim that among the various ways of\nknowing available to us, the linguistic items that are Vedic texts\nuniquely represent “reliable epistemic warrants”\n(pramāṇa) with regard to dharma. \n\nIndian philosophers, particularly under the influence of the Nyāya\ntradition of thought (and of the appropriation and systematization of\nits main terms of art by the Buddhists Dignāga and\nDharmakīrti), were generally preoccupied by Kumārila’s\ntime with the issue of pramāṇas—with the\nquestion of which doxastic practices (perception, inference, testimony,\netc.) should be reckoned as “epistemic criteria” or\n“reliable doxastic practices” (as we might render\npramāṇa), and with characterizing the criteria so\nidentified. Mīmāṃsā’s Buddhist opponents\ncharacteristically affirmed, in this regard, that only perception and\ninference had this status, and that all other ways of arriving at\nbeliefs were somehow reducible to one of these. Proponents of\nMīmāṃsā chiefly affirmed, in contrast, not\nonly that there is an irreducibly and distinctively linguistic\nway of knowing, but indeed that it is this (and not perception) that\nshould be understood as most significant. For while it is in\nthe nature of perception to bear only on actually present states of\naffairs—the salient point of Jaimini’s fourth sūtra,\non perception, is that this consists in the kind of sensory cognition\nhad when there is contact with something present\n(satsaṃprayoge)—language alone has the capacity\nto engender awareness of future, or “to-be-realized”\n(bhāvya), states of affairs. Insofar, then, as the\ndharma that Mīmāṃsakas are most interested in\nis just such a state of affairs, the fact of perception’s bearing\nonly on what is (as it were) ready-to-hand is to be reckoned a\ndeficiency. The epistemological project for proponents of this school\nthus becomes that of making sense of the unique epistemic authority of\nthe kinds of Vedic injunctions (paradigmatically, “one desirous\nof heaven should perform the agnihotra sacrifice”) that\nwould not fare well on any account that instead privileged\nperception. \n\nTo that end, Kumārila’s predecessor Śabara argued that\nlinguistic utterances engender some cognition\n(avabodhayati), and that as long as the idea thus engendered\nis clear or “determinate” (niścita), one is\nentitled to accept it as a basis for action. Of a sentence such as\n“one desirous of heaven should perform a sacrifice,” then,\nŚabara would mainly ask:  do you understand the\nsentence? If not, then the sentence is reasonably disregarded\nowing to its engendering an essentially doubtful\n(saṃdigdham) cognition; but insofar as the sentence\nmakes an epistemically contentful claim, we are entitled to judge the\nprima facie unambiguous cognition thus brought about to be\nfalse only if it is explicitly falsified—only if we have, that is, knowledge to the effect that someone has not gone\nto heaven as a result of having performed the agnihotra\nsacrifice. Determinately contentful linguistic cognitions that have not\nbeen falsified are reasonably taken, then, as bases for action. \n\nDespite, however, Śabara’s probably warranted confidence\nthat his interlocutors could never be in a position to show\nthat sentences regarding the post-mortem careers of Vedic practitioners\nare falsified, the burden of proof will surely be thought by most to\nremain on him. It is at this point, though, that Kumārila more\nconvincingly shifted, in effect, the burden of proof. His\nground-breaking approach to epistemology involves raising a\nsecond-order question about the doxastic practices we take to be\nreliable (about, that is, pramāṇas). Of any way of\nknowing, then, that might be thought relevant to the adjudication of a\nclaim such as Śabara’s (and Kumārila recognized that it\nis strategically advantageous in this regard to focus especially on\nperception), Kumārila asks:  does it have its status\nas epistemically reliable—does it have, as\nKumārila puts it, its prāmāṇya, or\n“being\na pramāṇa”—“intrinsically”\n(svataḥ), or does it have this property only on account of something else (parataḥ)? What\nKumārila thus asks is whether any cognition’s having the\nepistemic qualities in virtue of which it is to be reckoned a reliable\nwarrant—truth-conduciveness, say, or the capacity to confer\njustification—is something that obtains immediately, or\nwhether instead justification is necessarily mediated by one’s having\nhigher-order reasons for confidence in one’s first-order\ncognitions. \n\nThe locus classicus for Kumārila’s argument here\nis verse 47 of the codanā sūtra chapter of the\nŚlokavārttika:  “It should be understood\nthat all pramāṇas’ have the property of\nbeing pramāṇas intrinsically; for a capacity not\nalready existing by itself (svataḥ) cannot be produced\nby anything else.” (All of the passages given here from\nKumārila and his commentators can be found in Arnold 2005,\n57–114.)  The argument Kumārila concisely expresses here in\nverse form is straightforward but compelling: if it is thought that\nany cognition finally counts as a reliable warrant only insofar as it\ncan be demonstrated to be such (for example, by appeal to a subsequent\ncognition of the causes of the initial one), infinite regress ensues;\nfor the subsequent, justifying cognition would, as itself a cognition,\nsimilarly require justification, and so on. Or, as Kumārila here\nsuggests, if the initial cognition isn’t credited with the\nintrinsic “capacity” for conferring justification, then no\nfurther cognition could be able to bestow that, either—unless,\nof course, the further cognition is itself credited with immediately\nhaving that capacity, in which case, why not simply allow this with\nrespect to the initial cognition? As Kumārila’s\ncommentators like to put it, if it is thought that we must await\nsecond-order justification before thinking we are justified in\ncrediting first-order cognitions, then “the whole world would be\nblind.” \n\nAmong Kumārila’s guiding intuitions here is the commonsensical\nthought that radical skepticism is not a tenable idea—that, in\nother words, it is to be presumed that we\nare, simply as a matter of empirical fact, already justified\nin believing a great deal, and that the task of epistemology is\ntherefore to consider what must be the case in order for that to make sense.\nThe thrust of Kumārila’s argument can be brought out by\nbriefly contrasting this epistemological position with what\nMīmāṃsakas not unreasonably took to be the\ncharacteristically Buddhist position in this regard (with its being\nparticularly the thought of Buddhists like Dignāga and\nDharmakīrti that Mīmāṃsakas targeted with their epistemological arguments). Against the kind of\ncommon-sense realism exemplified by proponents of\nMīmāṃsā, these Buddhists were inclined to\nencourage wariness with regard to our ordinary epistemic intuitions;\nBuddhists, after all, are chiefly concerned to argue that we are\nmistaken in inferring (what is perhaps among our most unshakable\nconvictions) that our manifestly episodic cognitions are the states of\nan underlying self. To that end, Buddhists like Dignāga\nand Dharmakīrti privileged what they took to be the constitutively\nnonconceptual, perceptual awareness that ultimately discloses,\nthey take it, only fleeting particulars. Dharmakīrti’s\nintuition in this regard was that it is especially in virtue of the\ncausally describable character of perception that it is thus to be\nprivileged, since on his view, the capacity to interact causally with\nother particulars is what distinguishes anything as really\nexistent. (This intuition means, among other things, that\nBuddhists would also attack the strong linguistic realism of\nMīmāṃsakas, since the kinds of abstract objects posited\nto make sense of language cannot be thought to have causal\nefficacy.) \n\nIn characterizing what he takes to be the Buddhist position with regard\nto the issues we are here scouting following Kumārila, the later\nMīmāṃsaka commentator Pārthasārathimiśra\ninvokes these central commitments of Dharmakīrti to motivate a\ncase for the direction of explanation that Mīmāṃsakas\nwould reverse:  “Since we see that there is cognition of\na jar that is sometimes based on a jar, and sometimes not\nbased on a jar, a jar cannot be ascertained only by that [i.e., only by\na cognition that seems to us to have a jar as its content].\nAccordingly, it must be ascertained that the arising of a cognition of\na jar really is based on a jar only after ascertainment that there is a\njar which really exists as the cause of that cognition, [which\nascertainment can be] based only on perception of pragmatic\nefficacy.” This credibly represents Buddhists in the tradition of\nDignāga and Dharmakīrti as holding that we reach epistemic\nbedrock only when we have “cognition whose phenomenal content is\npragmatic efficacy” (arthakriyānirbhāsaṃ\njñānam)—that, in other words, it is reasonable\nto doubt whether things really are as represented in cognition until we\nhave arrived at the kind of awareness that is causally related to what\nit is of (as, for example, when one not only sees that there is a jar,\nbut actually carries water with it). \n\nThat is what it might look like to suppose, against\nthe Mīmāṃsakas, that the status of first-order\ncognitions as epistemically reliable should be thought to\nrequire demonstration with reference to something over and above the\ninitial cognitions. Against this, Kumārila argues that the problem with\nsuch an appeal is that the second-order awareness that the\nthing perceived is pragmatically efficacious is itself just another\ncognition. Kumārila would allow, then, that a subsequent\ncognition concerning pragmatic efficacy could count as a potential\nsource of falsification; the impossibility of carrying water with what\nhad seemed to be a jar would indeed count as overriding the previously\njustified belief that one had seen a jar. What he refuses, however, is the\nclaim that the cognition of pragmatic efficacy provides a fundamentally\ndifferent kind of justification than the initial cognition.\nConfidence, to the contrary, that pragmatic efficacy does\nprovide something more—that it tells us, e.g., that an\ninitially justified belief is also true—could\nonly be based on the presupposition that “pragmatic\nefficacy” is somehow more immediately available to awareness\nthan, say, a jar; but this begs precisely the question at issue, and\nKumārila can not unreasonably ask why the Buddhist is willing to\ncredit the second-order cognition as intrinsically valid, but not the\nfirst. \n\nIt is important to appreciate the extent to which Kumārila’s\nepistemology involves essentially phenomenological\nconsiderations about the credibility of cognition. He says in this\nregard (at codanā verse 53) that “the epistemic\nreliability of cognition is obtained just by virtue of its consisting\nof cognition”—that, in other words, it is simply in the\nnature of contentful awareness to make an epistemic claim on the\nsubject thereof, and that these claims are to be suspended or set aside\nonly when specifically countervailing cognitions are forthcoming.\nMoreover, one typically does not go seeking knowledge that\none’s first-order cognitions are false; rather, it is only when\npresented with overriding cognitions—cognitions,\nKumārila says, typically brought about “effortlessly,” i.e.,\nwithout any ostensibly justificatory search on the part of the\nsubject—that one sometimes finds it necessary to revise one’s\njudgments. Kumārila does not propose, then, that one must first\nconsider and rule out all possible defeaters before arriving at\nconviction; the point, rather, is that one’s judgment is justified\nuntil and unless some specifically overriding cognition happens to be\nforthcoming. \n\nAn account of the possible overriding of prima facie justified beliefs\nturns out, then, to be integral to Kumārila’s epistemology.\nOne might, in this regard, worry that on the view he thus proposes,\nsecond-order cognitions of defeaters end up themselves having a\nprivileged status; that is, Kumārila might be thought to credit\n“overriding cognitions”\n(bādhakajñāna) with a capacity for effecting\nepistemic closure such as he does not allow for the initial cognitions\nthus overridden (which, as with scientific hypotheses for Popper, are\ntaken as never able to provide any definitive epistemic\nclosure). Thus, for example, it could be supposed that one might just\nas well conclude, from the fact that two contradictory cognitions have\narisen, that the second one is suspect—and that it\nwould therefore be unwarrantedly privileging “overriding”\ncognitions to suppose that second-order cognitions ipso facto\ncount as evidence of the falsity of the prior cognitions on which they\nbear.  Here, though, it matters that Kumārila’s account\ninvolves essentially phenomenological considerations; his point is\njust that a subsequent cognition calls for the revision of a preceding\none only if it seems to a subject to do so. Thus, to\nhave some prima facie justified belief subsequently called into\nquestion just is for the subsequent cognition to present\nitself as having, phenomenologically, the force of overriding the\npreceding; if that is not how the second awareness seems, then its\nphenomenological content will not be that of an overriding\ncognition in the first place, and it therefore will not present itself\nto the subject thereof as undermining any already-held belief. \n\nIt might also be worried that Kumārila’s account of\nfalsification leaves the epistemic process infinitely open, with\nsomething like an infinite regress of potential revisions—that\nwe could never be entitled, on this account, to claim anything like\nknowledge. Regarding this line of objection,\n Kumārila\n and his\ncommentators finally fall back on an appeal to common sense, urging\nthat it is unreasonable to encourage doubt where no specific cognition\nof any deficiencies explicitly raises one; otherwise, as the\ncommentator Sucaritamiśra puts it, “there would be the\nunwanted consequence of annihilating all worldly discourse.” The\nMīmāṃsakas thus take it that skeptical concerns can\nreasonably be pressed only so far, and that if it is thought that we\nare entitled only to those beliefs that have been decisively secured\nagainst all such doubts, then it would turn out that we know very\nlittle indeed. This thought reflects, again, Kumārila’s\ncommonsense realism, according to which it is beyond doubt that we\ndo know a great deal, and that any epistemology according to\nwhich that turns out to be problematic is, ipso facto, to be\nthought suspect. \n\nThe foregoing reading, on which Kumārila’s\ncharacteristic epistemological doctrine centrally involves the claim\nthat phenomenologically determinate cognitions immediately confer\nprima facie justification, is informed by one of a couple of\nsignificant lines of traditional interpretation of Kumārila’s\ntexts; in particular, this reflects the interpretation of the\ncommentator Pārthasārathimiśra, which is arguably\npreferable both in terms of its exegetical adequacy to Kumārila,\nand in terms of its philosophical cogency. (See, however, McCrea 2018 for a different perspective on the matter.) There is, however, an\nalternative line of interpretation to be gleaned from the commentary\nof Kumārila’s near-contemporary Uṃveka Bhaṭṭa\n(whose commentary is referred to in the Buddhist\nŚāntarakṣita’s engagements with Kumārila).  Among\nthe salient points of Uṃveka’s reading is the worry that\nKumārila cannot, as has so far been suggested, have meant to\nargue that all phenomenologically credible cognitions are to\nbe credited with being truth-conducive; seemingly counter, then, to\nKumārila’s own suggestion (quoted above) that “the validity\nof cognition is obtained just by virtue of its consisting of\ncognition,” Uṃveka notes that the fact of “being a\ncognition” (bodhakatva) commonly characterizes both\nveridical and erroneous cognitions. \n\nUṃveka worries, then, that if Kumārila is understood as\nsaying that a cognition’s being truth-conducive follows simply\nfrom its being a cognition, there would be the unwanted\nconsequence that if one mistook the glint of mother-of-pearl for that\nof a piece of silver (a stock example of error in Indian philosophy),\nthis erroneous cognition would have to be credited as a\n“veridical cognition” (pramāṇa). (It\nmatters for this discussion that the word pramāṇa\nis equivocal, alternately referring to reliable doxastic practices, and\nto episodes of veridical cognition such as result from the\nexercise thereof.) Uṃveka’s intuition, then, is that\n“being a pramāṇa” can only\ncharacterize, as it were, the certified outcome of the\nepistemic process; he is therefore concerned to interpret\nKumārila’s doctrine in such a way that “being\nintrinsically truth-conducive” ends up being predicated only of\nwhat are clearly veridical cognitions. \n\nTo that end, Uṃveka urges that Kumārila be understood as\narguing that what produces the truth-conduciveness intrinsic to some\ncognitions just is the causes of those cognitions that are\nveridical—that, in other words, the point of Kumārila’s\ncharacteristic claim is that the truth-conduciveness of any\ncognition originates intrinsically, arising from the same\ncausal factors in virtue of which it is rightly said to be\nveridical. With respect, then, to Kumārila’s claim\n(at codanā 47) that “a capacity not already\nexisting by itself cannot be produced by anything else,”\nUṃveka glosses Kumārila’s “by anything else” as\nsuggesting that a cognition’s capacity for truth-conduciveness cannot\nbe produced by anything over and above the causal factors\nrelevant to cognition. From the perspective of an interpretation informed by Pārthasārathimiśra, it thus seems that Uṃveka retains precisely the idea\nKumārila means to call into question, which is that veridical\ncognitions can be distinguished particularly with reference to the\ncauses thereof; for on Uṃveka’s view, what distinguishes a\nveridical cognition of silver from mistaking mother-of-pearl for\nsuch is the fact that in the former case alone, silver really is\npresent as the\ncause of the cognition. Uṃveka thus takes it that what\nimmediately or “intrinsically” attaches to cognitions is to\nbe understood not in terms of what may be the case prima facie\n(not in terms of how cognitions may at first appear), but in\nterms of what we end up with. The status of truth-conducive cognitions\nas truth-conducive, then, is understood as by Uṃveka as “intrinsic” only in the sense that this status results from the same causes that give rise to the cognitions so characterized—which means we can determine which cognitions those are by identifying the relevant causes. \n\nIn contrast to this interpretation of Kumārila, the\neleventh-century commentator\nPārthasārathimiśra—who also wrote an independent\nessay on the doctrine here in view\n(entitled Svataḥprāmāṇyanirṇaya,\n“Ascertainment of Intrinsic Validity”; see A. Subrahmanya\nShastri 1982, Arnold 2002)—embraced just the view that\nUṃveka thought so problematic. Pārthasārathimiśra emphasizes that it was\nprecisely Kumārila’s point to argue that all\nphenomenologically credible cognitions—all cognitions, that is,\nthat first present themselves as candidates for the status of reliable\nepistemic warrants—should be thought intrinsically or\nimmediately to have that status. This is, on one view of the matter, because\nPārthasārathimiśra takes the fact of any cognition’s\n“being truth-conducive”\n(prāmāṇya) essentially to concern not\ntruth, but justification—not, that is, the\noutcome of the epistemic process, but what gets it off the\nground in the first place. Kumārila’s reference, then, to\nthe “capacity” that cognitions immediately have in this\nregard is to be understood as a capacity for conferring\njustification—a thought that\nPārthasārathimiśra expresses by saying he takes\nKumārila’s doctrine to affirm (against Uṃveka) not\nthat this status intrinsically exists (bhavati), but\nthat it intrinsically “appears” (bhāti). The\npoint of departure on this understanding of Kumārila, then, is the\nkind of epistemic claim that any cognition seems to a subject\nto make upon him. \n\nAmong the points Pārthasārathimiśra adduces in favor of\nthis interpretation is that Uṃveka cannot make sense of the\naccount of falsification that figures in Kumārila’s\nelaboration of his epistemology. On the reading of\nKumārila’s epistemology proposed by Uṃveka,\nPārthasārathi says, Kumārila would have to be understood\nas claiming, with regard to cognitions that turn out to be overridden,\nthat their truth-status had changed. In other words, on the\nview that “being truth-conducive”\n(prāmāṇya) is intrinsically produced\n(i.e., by the same causes that produce the cognition), any subsequent\nrevision in judgment would have to consist in the actual transformation\nof the initially known state of affairs—what had been\ntrue, that is, would now be false. Against this,\nPārthasārathimiśra urges that “this doesn’t\nmake sense, because of [the cognition’s having been]\nnon-veridical from the outset.” This rejoinder virtually amounts\nto the statement of a realist conception of truth:  in cases where\nour initial cognition is overridden, the initial cognition was false\nall along; all that changes is our awareness thereof.\nPārthasārathi thus separates the (subjective, epistemic)\nstate of justification from the (objective) fact of\ntruth, and clarifies that what is intrinsic to cognition has\nto do with the former. This is why Pārthasārathi can\ncoherently take the whole doctrine of intrinsic validity precisely to\ndepend on what Uṃveka took to be an unwanted\nconsequence:  its being all determinately contentful\ncognitions that can reasonably be assumed immediately to confer\njustification. \n\nOn this reading, then, Kumārila’s doctrine is to be\nunderstood as holding that it is characteristic of contentful\ncognitions immediately to confer justification, with the\nmediation of higher-order cognitions capable not of conferring anything\nessentially different in kind, but only of calling for revision. If,\nabsent the arising of any overriding cognition, the prima facie\njustification holds, then the initial cognition stands as veridical\nin virtue of the fact that it was truth-conducive—in\nvirtue of the fact, as Pārthasārathi puts this point, that\n“being truth-conducive” (prāmāṇya)\nis the “motivator of the concept and the word\n‘pramāṇa’”\n(pramāṇabuddhiśabdayor bhāvakatayā).\nThis effectively reverses the direction of explanation favored by\nUṃveka, who is instead concerned to argue that the status of\nbeing truth-conducive is caused by the same factors that cause\nveridical cognitions. \n\nIf it seems like settling for less thus to argue, with\nPārthasārathi, that defeasible justification is all that can\nbe yielded by our epistemic practices, he can rejoin by asking whether it could make sense to want anything more\nthan that; what could it look like, epistemically, not only to be\njustified in holding a belief, but also to know it is\ntrue? In fact, this is already just what one is entitled to\nthink in virtue of being justified, and it is hard to imagine what\nsense it could make to think we might be, with respect to any\nparticular belief, in a better epistemic position than already\nentitled to think it true. Indeed, it is arguably just the\npoint of Kumārila’s epistemology thus to challenge the\nintuition that “knowing” could only consist in knowing\nthat one knows. Just, then, as with the influential efforts\nof contemporary “reformed epistemologists” to undermine\nthe threat of “evidentialist” challenges (see, especially,\nAlston 1991, as well as Arnold 2005), Kumārila’s epistemology\namounts to a critique of empiricist foundationalism—one that\ngets its purchase largely by showing that the foundationalist impulse\nends up leading to intractable skeptical problems such as can only be\nforeclosed by an appeal to common sense. \n\nOf course, there are, in addition to the foregoing philosophical\nconsiderations in favor of Kumārila’s epistemology,\nspecifically Mīmāṃsaka concerns driving the project. In\nthis regard, Pārthasārathi has a particularly cogent point in\nfavor of the interpretation on which Kumārila has, as suggested\nabove, effectively reversed the standard order of epistemological\nexplanation. Thus, Pārthasārathi urges that\nMīmāṃsakas cannot proceed on the assumption\nthat Kumārila meant to ask about the status only of\npramāṇas (i.e., only of those cognitions that are\nalready known to be veridical); for that would effectively disqualify\nthe Vedas from coming under the purview of this discussion, since\nMīmāṃsā’s opponents will not grant that the\nVedas count as epistemically reliable (as a\npramāṇa) in the first place. Indeed, whether or not\nwe are entitled to think the Vedas epistemically reliable is just\nthe issue in question; it would therefore be to little avail to\nask how it is simply that cognitions already known to be reliable have\nthe status they do, since it must first be established that Vedic\ninjunction is a rational basis for action in the first place. And the\nonly way to further this goal, Pārthasārathi argues, is to\nshow that all contentful cognitions (even those that turn out\nnot to have been veridical) should be recognized as immediately\nconferring justification. Aptly expressing the reversed direction of\nepistemological explanation commended by this interpretation, William\nAlston has asked to similar effect: if a subject\n“were not often really perceiving X why should the experience\ninvolved provide justification for beliefs about X?” (1991: 10)\nSimilarly, Pārthasārathi can ask: if it were not really the\ncase that one desirous of heaven should perform a Vedic sacrifice, then\nwhy (as this epistemological program is concerned to show) would the\nexperience of a Vedic injunction to that effect provide justification\nfor that belief? \n\nOn the view, then, that Kumārila’s doctrine reverses the\nusual order of epistemological explanation, the claim is that insofar\nas any cognition engendered by a Vedic injunction intrinsically confers\njustification simply in virtue of its being a cognition, Vedic\ninjunction first becomes a candidate for the status of “reliable\ndoxastic practice” (pramāṇa)—and the\npoint of Kumārila’s epistemology is that this is a status\nthat any reliable doxastic practice should then be thought to enjoy\nuntil or unless it is overridden. Here, though, is where other\ncharacteristically Mīmāṃsaka commitments significantly\ncome into play—chiefly, the commitment to the view that the\nVedic texts are, like language itself, eternal or primordial.\nJaimini’s fifth Mīmāṃsā Sūtra\nspecifies in this regard that “the relations between words and\ntheir referents are primordial (autpattika)”—a\nview meant to underwrite the claim that the Vedas themselves are\ntranscendent or “impersonal” (apauruṣeya).\nIt is, then, particularly together with this view that\nKumārila’s epistemology can be taken to warrant the\nMīmāṃsaka claim that the Vedas are, in fact,\nuniquely authoritative; for insofar as they are thus taken\nessentially to transcend any human perspective, Vedic injunctions,\nuniquely among reliable doxastic practices, therefore cannot\nbe falsified. \n\nThat the claims expressed by or implicit in Vedic texts cannot be\nfalsified has to do with the distinctive capacity of language to bear\non imperceptible states of affairs such as are not ready to hand, but\nalways “going to be realized” (bhāvya or\nbhaviṣyat). Thus, to the extent that any linguistic\nepisode reflects or expresses something of the epistemic perspective of\na particular language-user, the claim it makes is always such as can be\noverridden based on considerations involving that limited epistemic\nperspective—based, e.g., on the speaker’s mendacity, or\non his reporting a perceptual or inferential claim that turns out\nitself to be mistaken. Language itself, however, is not thus\nlimited by any particular perspective; to the extent, then, that one\njoins Mīmāṃsakas (as Heidegger sometimes seems to do!)\nin finding intelligible the idea that language itself might,\nas it were, utter the Vedas, the fact of there being no epistemically\nlimited author whose intentions the Vedas would express means there\ncan, in this case alone, be no basis for overriding the claims that\nissue from these texts. (That Mīmāṃsakas argued\nstrenuously against Buddhist and Jaina claims about the possible\ncultivation of omniscience reflects the stake they thus had in denying\nthat there could be any epistemically unlimited perspective;\nlanguage as such, in contrast to such individual knowers as\nthe Buddha and the Jina, is not itself a limiting perspective.) \n\nIt is important to note (what is sometimes overlooked) that the\nforegoing claims about the eternality of language and of the Vedas are\nlogically independent of the epistemological position Kumārila has\nelaborated; the epistemological doctrine of “immediate\njustification” does not, that is, by itself support the claim\nthat the Vedas are uniquely authoritative. While Kumārila’s\nepistemology may, then, by itself show that Vedic texts are\njustifiably credited as epistemically reliable (that, in other\nwords, Mīmāṃsaka beliefs are rationally held),\nit is logically independent claims about the eternality of the Vedas\nthat are taken by Mīmāṃsakas to warrant the stronger\nconclusion that Vedic injunctions are uniquely so. It is\nimportant to appreciate the independence of these positions from one\nanother, and accordingly to note that the assessment of\nKumārila’s epistemology (both traditionally and among modern\nscholars) is sometimes driven more by resistance to the eternality\nclaim than to anything integral to Kumārila’s\nepistemology. \n\nThus, for example, the tenth-century Nyāya thinker Jayanta\nBhaṭṭa—who was himself much influenced by the\nthought of Kumārila, and who was inclined to cede to\nMīmāṃsakas authority in hermeneutical\nmatters—was worried, as a theist, about Kumārila’s\nepistemological case for the authoritative status of the\nVedas. Jayanta thought Kumārila’s defense of the Vedas\nproblematic, however, chiefly insofar as Kumārila’s epistemology\ndovetails with claims about the eternality of the Vedas, thus making\nfor an essentially atheistic case for the eternality of the\nVedas.  So, while Nyāya thinkers like Jayanta characteristically\nheld that authorship of the Vedas is to be attributed to\nīśvara, “God,” Kumārila’s\ndefense of the eternality of language involves critiques of\ntheism that are, indeed, very much like some characteristically\nBuddhist critiques of theism. (On this, see Krasser 1999.) But while\nKumārila’s epistemological doctrine is clearly meant to\ndovetail with these other commitments to secure a unique epistemic\nstatus for the Vedas, the claimed eternality of language (and the\nconsequent critique of theism) is not itself a point that is advanced\nby Kumārila’s epistemological case for the immediately\njustificatory status of contentful cognitions; indeed, that there is\nnothing intrinsically anti-theistic about his epistemology is suggested\nby the fact that William Alston (1991) has elaborated a strikingly\nsimilar epistemology precisely in order to show specifically\ntheistic practices to be justified. To the extent, then, that\nJayanta attacks Kumārila’s epistemology chiefly by pressing\nthe point that it is problematic to suppose there could be authorless\ntexts (as, for example, in his philosophical play\nĀgamaḍambara; see Dezso 2005, 213–17), it should\nbe recognized that he misses the mark. \n\nDespite the importance of thus distinguishing these two moments in\nKumārila’s case for Vedic authority—the\nepistemological moment, that is, and the case for the\nessentially transcendent character of the Vedas—it should be\nallowed that Mīmāṃsaka commitments regarding the\neternality of language in general (and of the Vedas in particular) are\nhardly incidental to their overall position. While, however, few modern\nreaders are likely to be favorably inclined towards the view that the\nVedic texts are authorless, these commitments reflect often profound\nintuitions, elaborated by Kumārila and other\nMīmāṃsakas, about the irreducibly linguistic character\nof thought, and about the reality of the kinds of universals that must\nbe posited to make sense of the objectivity of language. Arguing, in\nthis regard, for the eternality of language, Kumārila challenged\n(chiefly Buddhist and Nyāya) proponents of contract- or\nconvention-theories of linguistic origins to explain how any\nparticular linguistic act could coherently be imagined as\nthe first such act. The problem he raises is that any\nparticular linguistic act is intelligible as a linguistic\nact—intelligible, that is, as instituting linguistic\npolicies—only given the prior understanding that the\nmeaning-creating utterance itself means something. One person\ncould, that is, propose to another that (for example) this thing here\nbe called a ‘cow’ only by telling her\nso—but the possibility of his doing so is just what we are in\nthis case trying to explain. \n\nKumārila can be said in this regard to share Wittgenstein’s\nfamously expressed intuition about the problem with Augustine’s\naccount of language-acquisition. With regard to Augustine’s contention that language-learning is explicable in terms of foundational moments of deictic usage, Wittgenstein says that “Augustine describes the\nlearning of human language as if the child came into a strange country\nand did not understand the language of the country; that is, as if it\nalready had a language, only not this one. Or again: as if the child\ncould already think, only not yet speak. And\n‘think’ would here mean something like ‘talk to\nitself’.” (Wittgenstein 1958, §32) Kumārila can\nbe taken similarly to have urged, in pressing his case for the\neternality of language, that we can only imagine thinking to\nconsist in “talking to oneself”—and that to\nunderstand that is to understand something more than just\nwhat things are called. What Kumārila challenges his\nNyāya and Buddhist opponents to explain, then, is where we get the\nvery idea of meaning  something, and in what that\nconsists. \n\nKumārila thus argues that the irreducible givenness of\nlanguage—its always already being there—is a condition\nof the possibility of there being any particular speech acts, and of\nany thought such as might explain these. Particularly as\nagainst the essentially psychologistic account of language to be\ngleaned from the Buddhist Dharmakīrti, Kumārila’s view\ncan be understood to credit something of the irreducibly social\ncharacter of language, which is to be understood on this view as having\nan essentially mind-independent reality; the possibility of\nmeaning anything cannot be explained with reference to the\ngoings-on in any particular minds. It might reasonably be\nsaid, then, that while Dharmakīrti’s apoha doctrine\namounts to a paradigm case of what V. N. Volosinov characterized as\n“individualistic subjectivism,” Kumārila’s\naccount paradigmatically exemplifies the alternative pole that\nVolosinov characterized as “abstract objectivism.” (On\nthese arguments, see Arnold 2006, and 2012, Chapter 4; Taber\n[forthcoming]. See, as well, Volosinov 1986, 45–63.) \n\nIt is important to note, with respect to Kumārila’s\ncharacteristically Mīmāṃsaka intuitions about language,\nthat the word śabda—which often means\n“word,” as in the fifth of Jaimini’s\nMīmāṃsā Sūtras, where it is\nrelations between śabda and referents (artha)\nthat are said to be primordial—is essentially ambiguous between\nwhat Saussure distinguished as langue and parole.\nThus, the same word can also refer generally to\n“sound,” in the sense denoting any object of the\nauditory sense faculty. To that extent, śabda can be\nunderstood as referring either to language as such\n(Saussure’s langue), or to particular, temporally describable\noccasions of linguistic utterance (Saussure’s\nparole). It thus becomes clear that arguments for thinking that\nśabda is eternal will seem rather different depending on\nwhich of these senses one takes to be in play. Buddhists, especially\ninsofar as they are typically apt to focus on particular occasions of\nuse, find it obviously true that (as on one favored Buddhist example of\na formally stated inference) “śabda is impermanent,\nbecause it is produced,” just like artifacts like jars (which we\nknow to be both produced on particular occasions, and essentially\nimpermanent). The Buddhist claim is less obviously compelling, however, if instead\none takes it that śabda denotes always already available\nconditions of the possibility of any particular utterance’s\ncounting as linguistic. \n\nStill, while it is surely appropriate thus to credit\nKumārila’s arguments for the eternality of language with\ncapturing profound insights regarding our linguistic being, the case\nfor his account of the eternality of language is greatly complicated by\nthe fact that Kumārila actually holds, in a way, that it is in\nboth of the foregoing senses of the word that\nśabda should be understood as eternal; on his view, that\nis, it is not only linguistic universals that are timeless, but also\nthe phonemes that manifest these. This view reflects, no\ndoubt, characteristically Mīmāṃsaka commitments,\ncentering on the category of mantra, about the\nVedas—commitments, in particular, about the inherent power not\nonly of language as such, but of properly uttered Sanskrit sentences\nto\nbring into being the states of affairs they concern. Many\nBrahmanical texts preserve, in this regard, a famous story of the\nsignificance of precise transmission of the text:  wishing, by\nuttering the nominal compound Indra*ndash;śatru (which could\nmean “conqueror of Indra”), to make his son triumphant, the\nmythical figure of Tvaṣṭar instead ensured his son’s\ndeath by pronouncing the compound so that it had the sense of an\nadjectival, bahuvrīhi compound (“having Indra as\nconqueror”)—with the latter state of affairs then brought\ninto being by his utterance. \n\nIt is perhaps insofar as he was attuned to such a view of the\nsignificance of Vedic language that Kumārila was apt to eschew\ntypically holistic understandings of meaning, and instead to hold the\nkind of atomistic view on which individual phonemes can be thought part\nof what is eternal about language. Kumārila was, in this regard,\ncritical of the Sanskrit grammarians’ sphoṭa\n(“bursting forth”) theory of meaning, which had been\nelaborated precisely to account for the expression of meaning in light\nof the manifestly temporal character of linguistic utterance.\nThe considerations here in play are not unlike those that preoccupied\nHusserl in his On the Phenomenology of the Consciousness of\nInternal Time (1991); just, then, as Husserl was led to venture\nthat the seemingly instantaneous present of consciousness must somehow\ncomprise something of the past and future if we are to account for\nthings like the musical experience of melody, so, too, Sanskritic\nthinkers had wondered how to account for the dawning of\nmeaning relative to the necessarily temporal unfolding of any\nsentence one could encounter. At the moment, for example, when the last\nphoneme of a sentence is uttered, the initial phonemes are no longer\npresent; at what point, then, are we to say that the sentence’s\nmeaning is experienced, and how are we to account for that\nwith regard to the necessarily vanished moments that are involved? \n\nWhile proponents of the sphoṭa (or “bursting\nforth”) theory had urged that we must, in this regard, posit the\nsudden dawning of something akin to a unitary proposition\n(which might, indeed, be taken as the sense of the word\nsphoṭa in this context), Kumārila instead argued\nthat understanding—whether of sentences, or just of\nindividual words—can be explained with reference to\nmemory of discrete phonemes, and that reference to anything over and\nabove the phonemes was therefore unnecessary. Similarly, Kumārila\neschewed the holistic account of sentence-meaning—called\nanvitābhidhānavāda, the doctrine that a\nsentence is “the expressed meaning of a series [of words]”\n(per Brough, 1953, 416)—advanced by Prabhākara, who\nwould argue that complete sentences represent the basic unit of\nmeaning. Instead, Kumārila held the so-called\nabhihitānvayavāda doctrine—the view that a\nsentence is “a series of expressed word-meanings” (Brough,\n416)—on which sentence-meaning is essentially analyzable in\nterms of word-meanings that are independently intelligible. Against,\nthen, the kind of holistic view on which the sense of a word is to be\nknown chiefly from substitution in sentences, Kumārila argued\n(just as he had against the sphoṭa theory) that\n“as the words are uttered in a sentence, each word performs its\ntask of expressing its meaning, and the sentence is the summation of\nthese meanings.” (Brough, 415; see, as well, Kunjunni Raja\n1963, Matilal 1990, Siderits 1991.) \n\nWhile such atomistic views might not be judged very promising, and\nwhile they are not obviously required by (and may even seem in tension\nwith) such intuitions as that language essentially transcends\nindividual occasions of use, they fit well with Kumārila’s\nadditional commitment to thinking that the phonemes of Vedic Sanskrit\nare part of what is eternal in language—though it is surely\ndifficult to imagine how something as eminently temporal as\nsound could thus be reckoned as in any sense\ntimeless. Notwithstanding his counter-intuitive commitment to\neternally existent phonemes, Kumārila was also an uncompromising\nrealist about more clearly abstract universals, taking it, for example,\nthat the referents of kind-terms are real properties such as being\na cow. (See Scharf 1996.) This comes through not only in\nKumārila’s philosophy of language, but also in his\nepistemology; against, then, Buddhists who argued (with Dignāga\nand Dharmakīrti) that perception is essentially non-conceptual,\nKumārila firmly held that perceptions, properly speaking,\nimmediately yield justified beliefs regarding things as the\nkinds of things they are; that perception thus discloses things\nunder some description shows, among other things, that the\nkinds of conceptual items that figure in descriptions are real. \n\nOne can really see, that is, not only particular bovine\ncritters, but also the fact of their exemplifying go-tva, the\nproperty of “being a cow”; this is just what it means to\nperceive any such particular as a cow. This is among\nthe points regarding which Kumārila found it apt to deploy the\nepistemological doctrine of immediate justification; thus, among the\nreasons why it cannot reasonably be denied that properties like\nbeing a cow are real is that there is nothing that finally\nfalsifies the many justified beliefs we have concerning things that are\nperceived as exemplifying just such properties. Insofar, that is, as we\nare prima facie justified in thinking of something perceived as\nbeing a cow really to be cow, and insofar as no overriding\ncognition is forthcoming, we are entitled to think the perceived fact\nof its being a cow is real. (See, on these lines of thought,\nTaber’s 2005 translation of the\nŚlokavārttika’s chapter on perception.) \n\nWith respect to the question of how timeless properties like being\na cow relate to the individuals that “manifest” them\n(tokens are in this context referred to as vyakti,\n“manifestations” of types), Kumārila aimed to finesse\nthe issue that bedeviled Brahmanical proponents of the Nyāya\nschool. Thus, Naiyāyikas characteristically invoked the\nVaiśeṣika category of “inherence”\n(samavāya), holding that an “inherence”\nrelation obtained between universals and the particulars that\ninstantiate them. Criticizing the Nyāya account on the grounds\nthat thus positing an intermediary category to do the work of\nrelating the two different kinds of things just opens up an\ninfinite regress, Kumārila instead held a view with affinities to\nthe kind of perspectivalism that is generally characteristic of Jaina\nphilosophy; on this view, “universal” and\n“particular” represent different aspects of the same\nthings, with neither aspect being finally intelligible apart from the\nother. (See, e.g., Ślokavārttika,\nākṛtivāda 8, ff.; Jha, trans., 1983, 282,\nff.) \n\nAmong the grounds for certain of Kumārila’s claims regarding\nuniversals is the epistemic practice of arthāpatti, or\n“necessary presumption.” This represents a doxastic\npractice admitted as distinct (i.e., as a pramāṇa)\nonly by Mīmāṃsakas, with proponents of other schools of\nthought having regarded this as indistinct from inference\n(anumāna). If there is a difference from inference as\nthat doxastic practice was systematized by Indian philosophers, it is\nperhaps that arthāpatti will not as readily admit of\nformalization; this represents, then, something more like inference\nto the best explanation—the presumption or\n“positing” (kalpanā) of something without\nwhich some explanandum would not make sense. According to a stock\nexample, it must be supposed, of a corpulent person who never eats\nduring the daytime, that he eats at night. Kumārila appealed to\nthis mode of reasoning to argue, for example, for the necessity of\npositing universals as the referents of words; thus, what one\nunderstands, on rightly taking the meaning of a word, is that\n(a universal) without which the word’s communicative\ncapacity would not be intelligible. \n\nThe same epistemic procedure is invoked, as well, to offer a peculiar\nalternative to the characteristically Buddhist view that awareness is\ninherently reflexive (that all awareness, that is, involves\nsvasaṃvitti, or “self-awareness”).\nProfoundly wary of the significance of self-awareness in Buddhist\narguments for idealism—Dharmakīrti’s arguments for\nthe foundational character of self-awareness, for example, amount to a\ncase at least for the kind of epistemic idealism on which the\ndirect objects of awareness are mental representations (see Arnold\n2008)—Kumārila was at pains to disallow that awareness is\nessentially reflexive. Against that idea, he held the counter-intuitive view that\nour awareness of ourselves as being aware is in fact a\npresumption from jñātatā, the fact of\nsomething’s “being known.” From the occurrence of an\nact of “being known,” that is, we presume there to have\nbeen an act of knowing, though that is not itself part of the\ncontent of our awareness. Lest this seem a manifestly untenable idea,\nit is worth noting that the broadly Sanskritic discussion of these\nissues typically took its bearings from grammarians’ analyses of\nthe various factors relatable to a verb in any sentence; thus,\nKumārila, like other Indian philosophers who argued against the\nBuddhist doctrine of self-awareness, urged that it is incoherent to\nhold that the same thing could at once be agent and\npatient of a single act—and if it is counter-intuitive\nto think, with Kumārila, of something’s “being\nknown” prior to or independently of a subject’s\nknowing that, it may make a difference that the guiding\nidea of “being known” is that of an act such as can be\nreferred to. “Being known,” then, is here thought to\ncharacterize the objects of such acts, and is therefore not\nsomething itself to be known by introspection. (For a sympathetic reconstruction of this doctrine in a different context, see Siderits 2011.) \n\nMost controversially, Kumārila invoked the epistemic practice of\n“necessary presumption” in arguing (at great length in the\nTantravārttika) for the category of apūrva,\nwhich it is hard not to consider a basically ad hoc category\nmeant to account for the efficacy of Vedic sacrificial rites.\nApūrva denotes, then, the temporally remote consequences\nof ritual acts—what it is, in other words, in virtue of which a\ncorrectly performed Vedic rite can be judged efficacious, even in the\nabsence of any immediately observed effect of the expected kind. The\nfelt need to posit such an entity follows from Kumārila’s\nconvictions regarding the epistemic claim that is made (at least upon\nthe right kind of person) by Vedic injunctions. Thus, insofar as one\ncan (as Kumārila argued in elaborating the epistemology sketched\nin §2, above) justifiably hold that Vedic injunctions make\ncontentful claims about matters of ultimate importance, and insofar as\nthe rites enjoined thereby are manifestly temporal events that are yet\nsaid to bear on always “yet-to-be-realized” states of\naffairs, it must be the case that something relates present, temporally\noccurrent ritual performances to the essentially imperceptible realm of\ndharma; for otherwise, the Vedic injunctions would be\nmeaningless. \n\nHere again, Kumārila’s arguments relate closely to\nlinguistic preoccupations in light of which the point he makes can seem\nmore interesting than it might at first. With respect, then, to the\nquestion of what, in the Vedic texts, refers to the obscure\n“apūrva” he has thus posited, Kumārila\nholds that this should finally be understood as the referent of\nverbs; for nouns essentially denote already present things,\nwhereas it is verbs in virtue of which injunctive sentences enjoin\nactions that are always to be completed. (See, e.g.,\nTantravārttika 2.2.1, ff.; and\nŚlokavārttika,\nvākyādhikaraṇa, 330, ff.)\nKumārila’s arguments here track, then, an often-cited\nhermeneutical maxim favored by Mīmāṃsakas: \n“what exists conduces to what is to be brought into being”\n(bhūtaṃ bhavyāya kalpate). It is, in other\nwords, the state of affairs whose “realization”\n(bhāvanā) is expressed by the verb that should be\njudged predominant particularly in the injunctive sentences that\nrepresent, for Mīmāṃakas, the most important parts of\nthe Vedas. (See McCrea 2000.) So, just insofar as they refer to\nalready-present things, nouns refer to things that are essentially\nsubordinated to the realization (the\nbhāvanā, or “making real”) of the\nacts that are what such sentences primarily enjoin; insofar,\nthen, as it is reasonable to think that verbs, too, must have\nreferents, and insofar as these referents are always essentially\nyet to be realized, Kumārila thinks it necessary to posit\napūrva (the temporally remote consequence of ritual acts)\nas being, as it were, the “referents” of verbs. (See\nClooney 1990, 239, ff.; Halbfass 1991, 300–307) \n\nOnce again, Kumārila can here be seen to take his bearings\nfrom the thought that what matters most is what is disclosed by the\nunique capacity of language somehow to bring into view—indeed,\nto bring into being—a world beyond what is actually\npresent. Kumārila’s richly elaborated sense of our linguistic\nbeing thus reflects, above all, a guiding commitment to the view that\nVedic injunctions essentially enjoin the ongoing bringing into\nbeing of a ritual world that must continually be\nrenewed—that, indeed, the world itself is sustained by Vedic\nsacrifice, which is rationally undertaken chiefly insofar as the texts\nthat enjoin this essentially transcend any particular human\nperspective. \n\nKumārila’s confidence in the genuinely referential nature of\nlanguage is also reflected, finally, in his characteristic arguments\nfor the idea that it is an enduring ātman\n(“self”) that is the underlying subject of all of our\nactions (and that therefore stands to realize, in the future, the\nfruits of Vedic practices). Like thinkers in the Brahmanical Nyāya\ntradition of philosophy, Kumārila (here closely following\nŚabara) was concerned to vindicate this conviction particularly in\nthe face of Buddhist arguments to the contrary (the claim that persons\nare “without self,” or anātma, being a\ncardinal Buddhist doctrine). Kumārila’s intuitions in this\nregard center on the thought that “the notion\n‘I’” (ahaṃ-pratyaya) must have a real\nreferent. That this is so, he argues, is directly experienced in the\ncase of memory, the content of which constitutively involves reference\nto “I” as the subject of past experiences now remembered.\nIn contrast, then, to arguments (such as those offered by many\nproponents of Nyāya) to the effect that memory\npresupposes an enduring subject, Kumārila’s\ndistinctive claim is that in the always first-personally indexed\ncontent of mnemonic experience we really\n“encounter” the referent of the first-person pronoun.\nInsofar, that is, as it doesn’t make sense to think one might\nremember an experience, and at the same time be uncertain about\nwhose experience it is that’s remembered, it must be\nthought that there is in this case genuine “recognition”\n(pratyabhijñā) of the referent of “the\nnotion ‘I’.” (See, especially,\nŚlokavārttika, ātmavāda, verses\n107–110; Jha 1983, trans., 401–02; Taber 1990.) \n\nInterestingly, Buddhists like Dignāga and Dharmakīrti take\nthe phenomenologically second-order character of memory here identified\nby Kumārila—the fact, that is, that mnemonic awareness is phenomenologically\ndistinct from present awareness in virtue of the explicitly reflexive character of memory—as evidence only that moments of awareness have a reflexive aspect. That momentary mental states are thus characterized by their “self-awareness” is, for these Buddhists, nothing like awareness of a self; rather, it is something like the fact that moments of cognition are self-intimating. (On svasaṃvitti, see Ganeri 1999, Kellner 2010, Thompson 2011.) \n\nKumārila, we noted at the beginning of this section, is deeply\nresistant to the Buddhist doctrine of self-awareness, insofar as that\nis enlisted by these Buddhists as evidence for the idealist claim that\nwe are, finally, indubitably aware only of the content of our own\nmental states. Against, though, the Buddhist appeal to the\nphenomenologically distinctive character of memory, Kumārila can\nargue that it is not moments of subjectivity that we encounter in memory, but rather the fact that the subject who now remembers is the same\nas the subject disclosed in the remembered experience. Not momentariness but continuity is the most phenomenologically salient feature of memory—and insofar as Kumārila here again takes his bearings from the guiding epistemological intuition that we are generally justified in taking awareness\nas veridically disclosing just what it seems to us to disclose. While Buddhists like Dignāga and Dharmakīrti propose, then,\nan explanation of personhood that is counter-intuitive in light of the\nphenomenally continuous character of awareness, Kumārila\ncan again invoke his characteristic epistemological doctrine; thus, he\nargues not only that we are prima facie justified in believing\nourselves really to be as we seem (particularly in the case of\nmemory) to ourselves to be, but also that there is finally nothing that\ncan be taken to override that conviction. (See ātmavāda\nverses 125–26 [Jha 1983, 405], and, as well, Taber 1990.)\nKumārila’s account of the self, then, represents another expression of the common-sense realism that informs his entire project. \n\nThat Kumārila can so often enlist common-sense intuitions in\ndefense of his project, however, might be thought in tension with such\nsurely non-commonsensical ideas as that there is a mysterious\n“apūrva” connecting the eminently temporal\nacts of Vedic practitioners to the always “yet-to-be”\ndharma from which Mīmāṃsakas take their\nbearings—and in tension, as well, with\nMīmāṃsā’s foundational appeal to an\nessentially authorless corpus of Sanskrit texts. Indeed,\nKumārila’s philosophically sophisticated efforts thus to\ndetach characteristically Vedic claims from any finite human\nperspective can be understood as rather insidious. It is not beside the\npoint to note in this regard that the Mīmāṃsā\ntradition he advanced can be characterized (as by Sheldon Pollock) as\n“the dominant orthodox discourse of traditional India”\n(1989, 604); for it is at least arguably the case that it is\nprecisely the appeal to the transcendent character of the Vedas that\nsecured Mīmāṃsā’s dominance, and that\nthe securing of dominance was just the point of that\nappeal. That is surely as some of Mīmāṃsā’s critics argued; proponents of the skeptical\n“Cārvāka” school of thought, for example, argued that the various\naspects of the Vedic worldview were all introduced by Brahmins simply in\norder to secure their own livelihood as the adjudicators of that\ntradition. Whether or not that represents a reasonable account of the\naims of Kumārila and other Mīmāṃsakas, it is\nsurely a defensible view at least that such ideological effects were\namong the upshots of Mīmāṃsaka influence. Sheldon\nPollock has recurrently argued, in this vein, that the dominance\nachieved by proponents of the Mīmāṃsaka project is\nreflected in widespread Indic conceptions of authoritative discourse in\ngeneral—conceptions such as Kumārila himself advanced with\nhis arguments concerning, e.g., the epistemic status of the vast corpus\nof Brahmanical literature (generally styled smṛti,\n“tradition”) that extends beyond the Vedic corpus\n(contrastively styled śruti,\n“revelation”). \n\nThus, Kumārila argued at length in the\nTantravārttika (e.g., 1.3.1, ff.) that traditional\nliterature can be accepted as authoritative just insofar as it\nexhibits the property of “being rooted in the Vedas”\n(vedamūlatvam)—even if that means, in some cases,\ninferring the reality of a no-longer-accessible Vedic text as the\nbasis for retaining manifestly important traditions that do not\nobviously stem from any extant Vedic text. Chief among the upshots of\nthis is that what Kumārila and other Mīmāṃsakas\ntook to be the basis for the distinctive epistemic status of the\nVedas—namely, their being transcendently\n“impersonal” (apauruṣeya)—was\neffectively claimed, as well, for whole traditions of learning\nostensibly relatable to the Vedas. As Pollock has suggested,\n“other sorts of Brahmanical intellectual practices seeking to\nlegitimate their truth-claims had perforce to conform to this special\nmodel of what counts as knowledge, and so to suppress the evidence of\ntheir own historical existence.” (1989, 609; see, as well,\nHalbfass 1991, passim) \n\nThe characteristically Mīmāṃsaka claim that the Vedas\nare eternal can thus be understood to inform a pan-Sanskritic episteme\nsuch as lends itself to the sort of analysis that is characteristic of\nPierre Bourdieu, according to whom “every established order tends\nto produce (to very different degrees and with very different means)\nthe naturalization of its own arbitrariness.” (Bourdieu 1977,\n164) The enormous influence of philosophical projects such as\nKumārila’s, that is, arguably had the effect of masking the\nspecifically located and interested character particularly of\nBrahmanical claims to authority, giving historical and contingent\nclaims the status that goes with their supposedly just reflecting\nthe way things are. It is not unreasonable, then, to see in\nthe success of Kumārila’s project a paradigm case of the\nkind of historical situation in which, as Bourdieu puts it, “the\nestablished cosmological and political order is perceived not as\narbitrary, i.e. as one possible order among others, but as a\nself-evident and natural order which goes without saying and therefore\ngoes unquestioned.” (ibid., 165–6) To that extent,\nKumārila’s philosophy would seem readily to admit of the\nkind of ideology critique advanced, following Bourdieu, by Pollock. \n\nWhile that is not an unreasonable characterization of the context and\nimplications of his philosophy, Kumārila can also be read as\narguing for a radical de-centering of individual aims and\nprojects—for the relativization of all claims and goals to an\nessentially linguistic reality that is above all distinguished by its\nvastly exceeding any particular\nperspective. Mīmāṃsakas typically distinguished, in\nthis regard, between dimensions of Vedic practice that are essentially\n“for the sake of the person”\n(puruṣārtha), and those that are “for the\nsake of the sacrifice” (kratvartha)—and in the\nfinal analysis, it is the latter dimensions that are of ultimate\nsignificance for proponents of the Vedic worldview defended by\nKumārila. (This interpretation is advanced by Clooney 1990,\n163, ff.) While Kumārila’s robust realism surely extended,\nthen, to the thought that the selves persons typically take\nthemselves to be are real—that, e.g., the referential character\nof the first-person pronoun discloses something that is really the\ncase—there is an important sense in which his project can be\ntaken finally to cut against the pursuit of any self-centered\nagenda. Emphasizing, to similar effect, some profound intuitions that\ncan be understood as reflected in the doctrine of the transcendence of\nthe Vedas, J. N. Mohanty has suggested that the salient point of this\nclaim is that “the intention of the author is not relevant for\nunderstanding the texts. The text itself is primary and\nautonomous.” (2007, 65) \n\nExemplifying, that is, a long-standing tradition that has always\nalready preceded the individuals who find themselves constituted\nthereby, the Vedas, on the understanding of them commended by Mohanty,\n“constitute the founding texts for the Hindu world by opening up\nthe horizon … within which the tradition has understood itself\nand [within which] we who belong to that tradition have understood\nourselves.” (ibid.) Mohanty, then, not implausibly finds\nit possible to see a basically Gadamerian thought reflected in the idea\nof the Vedas as authorless, and thus to emphasize the character of\nthese as representing a horizon for (rather than a constraint\non) ethical thinking:  “The Hindu understanding of\ndharma as embodied in the imperatives laid down in the [Vedas]\npreserves the idea of ethics as rooted solidly in that tradition which\nwas founded by those texts, but which those texts have permitted us to\nreinterpret ever anew.” (ibid.) While this is an\ninterestingly profound characterization of some of the insights driving\nKumārila’s project, it is no less reasonable to emphasize,\nas well, that insofar as Kumārila’s arguments helped secure\nfor Mīmāṃsakas the status of privileged arbiters of\nthis ongoing “reinterpretation,” questions of power and\nauthority remain ineliminable from an understanding of what he was up\nto.","contact.mail":"d-arnold@uchicago.edu","contact.domain":"uchicago.edu"}]
