Abû Nasr\nal-Fârâbî was probably born in 870 CE (AH 257) in a\nplace called Farab or Farayb. In his youth he moved to Iraq and\nBaghdad. In 943 CE (AH 331) he went to Syria and Damascus. He may have\ngone to Egypt but died in Damascus in December 950 CE or January 951\nCE (AH 339). Scholars have disputed his ethnic origin. Some claimed he\nwas Turkish but more recent research points to him being a\nPersian (Rudolph 2017: 536–45). \n\n\nAl-Fârâbî had two main interests:\n\nPhilosophy and logic in particular. Such interest explains why he\nis known as “the second master” (the first one, of course,\nbeing Aristotle) and\n\nMusic. His huge Kitâb al-musiqâ\nal-kabîr or Great Book of Music is the most\nimportant medieval musical treatise in Islamic lands and also includes\nsophisticated philosophical sections.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, much has happened in Farabian scholarship. New\nand better editions of his works as well as new and better\ntranslations have led to deeper studies of his thought and to some\ninteresting and lively controversies. More current bibliographies\nallow for more detailed research. We still lack critical editions,\nfull English translations—and even, at times, translation in any\nlanguage of several texts—as well as a solid introduction to\nal-Fârâbî’s philosophy. More research is also\nneeded to better understand the relation between his philosophical and\nmusical interests.\n\n\nOne can find the most recent and detailed listings of\nal-Fârâbî’s works and their translations in\nUlrich Rudolph, “Abû Nasr\nal-Fârâbî” (2017: 526–594), and Philippe\nVallat (2004: 379–87). Also, Jon McGinnis & David. C.  Reisman\ntranslated a series of Farabian texts in their Classical Arabic\nPhilosophy: An Anthology of Sources (2007: 54–120).\n\n\nIn what follows we will underline important scholarly developments of\nthe last thirty years and add useful complements to these listings. In\norder to highlight these scholarly developments we will follow the\ntraditional order of the Aristotelian sciences that\nal-Fârâbî himself offers in his Enumeration of\nthe sciences, ‘Ihsâ’\nal-‘ulûm, one of his most famous texts, as its\nMedieval Latin versions had much influence in the West. There is no\nfull English translation of this text, but Amor Cherni (2015)\npublished an edition with French translation and commentaries.\nRecently, a new critical edition with German translation of one of the two\nMedieval Latin versions have come out: Über die\nWissenschaften (de scientiis) Dominicus Gundissalinus’\nversion (2006). Alain Galonnier published a critical edition, French translation and study of the other Medieval latin version: Le De scientiis  Alfarabii de Gerard de Cremone (2016). Following this\ntraditional theoretical order makes much sense since we know very\nlittle about the chronological order of\nal-Fârâbî’s works, even if there is some\nindication that The Opinions of the People of the Virtuous\nCity, also known as The Perfect State, and The\nPolitical Regime, also known as The Principles of the\nBeings, may be among his latest works. The paucity of serious\ninformation about the chronological order of\nal-Fârâbî’s works makes it difficult to\ndetermine whether some inconsistencies and tensions between different\nworks result from an evolution in his thought, as Damien Janos claims (2019, pp. 166–70), or hint at a distinction\nbetween exoteric and esoteric treatises or simply arise from\nlimitations inherent to human nature that affect even the greatest\nphilosophers. As al-Fârâbî understood philosophy as\nall-encompassing and attempted to present coherent views, some works\nstraddle several philosophical disciplines and so we will indicate\nwhen such is the case. Al-Fârâbî’s knowledge\nof Aristotle’s works is extensive, and even includes some of his\nzoological treatises. \nIn the Enumeration of the Sciences\nal-Fârâbî first focuses on language, grammar,\nmetrics, etc. His Kitâb al-Hurûf (Book of Letters)\nor Particles, gives us much information on his views on\nlanguage. Muhsin Mahdi, who published the first edition of this text\nin 1969a based on a single manuscript, later on found two other manuscripts but could not complete a new edition. Making\nuse of the new material already gathered by Mahdi, Charles Butterworth\nhas prepared a second edition with facing full English\ntranslation to be published by Cornell University Press. Muhammad Ali Khalidi gave a partial English translation\ncovering the middle section (2005).  Thérèse-Anne Druart\n(2010) began studying al-Fârâbî’s innovative\nviews of language. In Freiburg-im-Brisgau Nadja Germann (2015-16) and her team\nhave been working on language and logic in classical Arabic and are more and\nmore impressed by the sophistication of\nal-Fârâbî’s positions. As for\nal-Fârâbî, music is at the service of speech, the\nlast section of the Great Book of Music explains how\ntechnically to fit music to speech, i.e., poetry, in order to enhance\nthe meaning of a text. Azza Abd al-Hamid Madian’s 1992 Ph. D.\ndissertation for Cornell University, Language-music relationships\nin al-Fârâbî’s “Grand Book of\nMusic”, includes an English translation of this section. \nNext to the study of language, al-Fârâbî considers\nlogic. For a long time the possibility of a serious study of\nal-Fârâbî’s logic remained somewhat elusive.\nEditions and translations of his logical works, except for his\n[‘Long’] Commentary on Aristotle’s De\nInterpretatione (Zimmerman 1981), were scattered in\nvarious journals and collective works often difficult to access. Many\nof these texts were more critically edited and gathered\nin al-mantiq ‘inda al-Fârâbî, ed. by\nRafîq al-‘Ajam and Majid Fakhry in 4\nvol. (1985–87). In 1987–89 Muhammad Taqî\nDânishpazuh published in Qumm a more complete collection of\nlogical texts, including a newly discovered part of a long commentary\non the Prior Analytics.  Soon afterwards, two books on Farabian logic followed: Shukri\nB. Abed, Aristotelian Logic and the Arabic Language in\nAlfârâbî (1991) and Joep\nLameer, Al-Fârâbî & Aristotelian\nSyllogistics: Greek Theory & Islamic Practice (1994). In 2006 Mauro Zonta published fragments of a long commentary\non the Categories in Hebrew, Arabic, and English translation. John\nWatt (2008) assessed the influence of the Syriac organon on\nal-Fârâbî and Kamran Karimullah (2014) dedicated a\nlengthy article to al-Fârâbî’s views on\nconditionals. Translations now are coming out: Alfarabi’s Book of Dialectic (Kitab al-Jadal) (David M. Di Pasquale, 2019), and Al-Farabi, Syllogism (Wilfird Hodges & Saloua Chatti, forthcoming), as well as further studies of al-Farabi’s logic by Saloua Chatti (2019) and papers by Terrence J. Kleven (2013)  and Riccardo Strobino (2019). \nSome issues dealt with in logic are also relevant to ethics and\nmetaphysics. Al-Farabi sees logic as the path to happiness (Germann, 2015). He also discusses the issue of future contingents. If the truth\nvalue of statements on future contingents is immediately determined,\ni.e., before the event happens, then everything is predetermined and\nfreewill is an illusion. Aristotle treats of this issue in On\nInterpretation, 9. Al-Fârâbî discusses more\ncomplex aspects of this issue as he adds a consideration of\nGod’s foreknowledge and defends human freewill against some\ntheologians (see Peter Adamson (2006), “The Arabic Sea Battle:\nal-Fârâbî on the Problem of future\nContingents”). \nAs Deborah L. Black (1990) showed, following the Alexandrian\ntradition, philosophers in Islamic lands consider Rhetoric\nand Poetics as integral to logic proper and so parts of\nAristotle’s Organon. Lahcen E. Ezzaher (2008:\n347–91) translated the short commentary on the Rhetoric.\nFrédérique Woerther (2018) & Maroun Aouad are preparing a\nnew edition of some of al-Fârâbî’s texts on\nrhetoric. Stéphane Diebler in Philosopher à Bagdad\nau Xe siècle (2007) [in fact a very useful collection of\ntranslations of short Farabian works] gave a French translation of the\nthree very brief treatises al-Fârâbî dedicated to\nPoetics. Geert Jan van Gelder & Marlé Hammond (2008:\n15–23) translated one of these treatises, The Book of\nPoetics, into English, as well as a brief relevant passage in the\nfirst part of The Great Book of Music. Terrence J. Kleven (2019) studies The Canons of Poetry.  Scholars interested in\npolitical philosophy have highlighted the distinctions\nal-Fârâbî makes between (1) demonstrative discourse,\nreflecting Aristotle’s positions in the Posterior\nAnalytics (in Arabic this text is known as The Book of\nDemonstration), and which alone is philosophical stricto\nsensu, (2) dialectical discourse, typical of the\n“mutakallimûn” or theologians and linked to\nAristotle’s Topics, and (3) rhetorical and poetical\ndiscourse, used in the Qur’ân or Jewish and Christian\nScriptures in order to address ordinary people.  \nGreat respect for Aristotle’s theory of demonstration led\nal-Fârâbî to attempt to fit any theoretical\ndiscipline in its framework, though some of them, such as music, do\nnot exclusively rest on necessary and universal primary principles, as\nthey also include principles derived from empirical observations\n(Miriam Galston, 2019). As music is dear to\nal-Fârâbî, it is in the first part of his Great\nBook on Music that we find the most extensive consideration of\nprimary empirical principles and their derivation from careful\nexamination of practice, i.e., in this case of musical\nperformances. \nAfter logic comes mathematics. For al-Fârâbî\nmathematical sciences include arithmetic, geometry, optics, astronomy,\nmusic, the science of weights and mechanics. Only recently has more\nattention be paid to this aspect of Farabian thought. Gad Freudenthal\n(1988) focused on al-Fârâbî’s views on\ngeometry. Except for pointing to al-Fârâbî’s\nrejection, in contradistinction to al-Kindî, of the validity of\nwhat we now call astrology, scholars had neglected his views on\nastronomy and cosmology. Damien Janos’s Method, Structure,\nand Development in al-Fârâbî’s Cosmology\n(2012) has filled this gap. His book throws new light on various\naspects of al-Fârâbî’s astronomy, cosmology,\nand philosophy of nature. It also highlights the link between\ncosmology and metaphysics. Johannes Thomann (2010–11) pointed to\na newly discovered commentary on the Almagest attributed to\nal-Fârâbî (Ms. Tehran Maglis 6531). \nIn the Enumeration al-Fârâbî follows the\ntraditional classification of music under mathematics. In The\nGreat Book of Music he certainly indicates that music derives\nsome of its principles from mathematics but he also insists, as we\nsaid above, on the importance of performance for determining its\nempirical principles. On some points the ear, rather than theoretical\nreflections, is the ultimate judge, even if at times the ear\ncontradicts some mathematical principle. For instance, he is well\naware that a semitone is not exactly the half of a tone. Of The\nGreat book of Music there exists only one full translation, that\nof Rodolphe d’Erlanger into French (originally published in\n1930–35 before the Arabic text was edited; reprint 2001). Only\npartial English translations exist. I referred to two of them: one in\nthe section on language and one in the logic section under poetics.\nGeorge Dimitri Sawa (2009) translated the two chapters on rhythm.\nAlison Laywine (McGill University), both a philosopher with excellent\nknowledge of Greek musical theories and a ‘Oud player, is\npreparing a full English translation of this complex and lengthy text.\nYet, The Great Book is not the only text\nal-Fârâbî dedicated to music. After having written\nit, dissatisfied with his explanation of rhythms, he subsequently\nwrote two shorter texts on rhythms (English translation of both by Sawa\n2009). Apparently al-Fârâbî invented a system of\nnotation for rhythms.  In his Philosophies of Music in Medieval\nIslam Fadlou Shehadi (1995) dedicates his third chapter to\nal-Fârâbî.  Thérèse-Anne Druart (2020) shows how al-Farabi links music to language, logic and even politics. \nAfter mathematics comes physics. We have only a few Farabian texts\ndealing with physics taken in the broadest sense and covering the\nwhole of natural philosophy. Paul Lettinck addresses some of\nal-Fârâbî’s views on physics in his\nAristotle’s Physics and its Reception in the Arabic\nWorld (1994) and Janos (2012) also does so. Marwan Rashed (2008)\nattempted a reconstruction of a lost treatise on changing beings. \nAl-Fârâbî wrote a little treatise rejecting the\nexistence of the vacuum by means of an experiment. Necati Lugal & Aydin Sayili (1951)\npublished the Arabic with an English translation. \nThe substantive Refutation of Galen’s Critique of\nAristotle’s Views on Human Organs merits serious studies.\n‘Abdurrahman Badawi edited it in his Traités\nphilosophiques (1983: 38–107). It shows\nal-Fârâbî’s interest in Aristotle’s\nzoological works and develops interesting parallels between the\nhierarchical structure of the organs of the human body, that of\ncosmology, that of emanation, and that of the ideal state. Badr El-Fakkak (2017) explains these parallels and Jawdath Jadour (2018) studies the structure of this text, which remains untranslated, and presents a new edition of al-Farabi’s Epistle on medicine.  \nPhysics includes Aristotle’s On the soul and scholars\nhave paid much attention to al-Fârâbî’s little\ntreatise On intellect (ed. by M. Bouyges, 1983). A full\nEnglish translation of this important treatise, of which there exist\ntwo Medieval Latin versions, was finally given by McGinnis &\nReisman in their Classical Arabic Philosophy (2007:\n68–78). Philippe Vallat published an extensive study of al-Farabi’s views on the intellect (2019a). The issue of the soul and the intellect is linked to logic, ethics, cosmology, and metaphysics. It also gives rise to a\ndebate. Earlier scholars considered that for\nal-Fârâbî universals are acquired by emanation from\nthe Agent Intellect, which for him is the tenth and last Intelligence,\neven if in many passages the second master uses the language of\nabstraction. Recently, Richard Taylor (2006 & 2010) argued that,\non the contrary, there is genuine abstraction in\nal-Fârâbî, even if in some ways it involves the\nemanative power of the Agent Intellect. \nMetaphysics follows physics. It is not easy to assess\nal-Fârâbî’s understanding of metaphysics. The\nvery brief treatise, The Aims of Aristotle’s\nMetaphysics, insists that, contrary to what most people assume,\nmetaphysics is not a theological science but rather investigates\nwhatever is common to all existing beings, such as being and unity.\nMcGinnis and Reisman provide a full English translation in their\nClassical Arabic Philosophy (2007: 78–81). In 1989\nMuhsin Mahdi published the Arabic text of a short treatise On One\nand Unity. It is still untranslated but Damien Janos (2017) explained its structure and contents and Philippe Vallat (2019b) studied it. Many passages of The Book of Letters are of\ngreat metaphysical import as Stephen Menn (2008) showed. These texts\nraise the question of the exact relation between logic and\nmetaphysics, as, for instance, both disciplines treat of the\ncategories (see Thérèse-Anne Druart (2007) & Kristell Trego (2018)). Such texts\npresent an Aristotelian outlook focusing on ontology that sharply\ndistinguishes metaphysics from Kalâm and seem to leave limited\nspace for philosophical theology and Neo-Platonic descent in\nparticular. \nOn the other hand, both The Opinions of the People of the Perfect\nCity and The Political Regime or The Principles of\nBeings begin with a metaphysical part presented as a Neo-Platonic\ndescent followed by a second part dealing with the organization of the\ncity or state and do not treat of being and unity as the most\nuniversal notions. The hierarchical structure of the ideal state\nmirrors the hierarchical emanationist structure presented in the first\npart. Walzer edited the former with an English translation under the\ntitle The Perfect State (1985) and Fauzi M. Najjar edited the\nlatter (1964). Charles Butterworth (2015) provided the first full\nEnglish translation of The Political Regime in The\nPolitical Writings, vol. II, pp. 27–94. The question of how\nexactly the ontology relates to the Neo-Platonic descent or emanation\nhas not yet been fully clarified, though The Enumeration of the\nSciences addresses both aspects. Furthermore, whether the\nNeo-Platonic descent grounds the political philosophy or metaphysics\nis simply a rhetorical appeal to make\nal-Fârâbî’s controversial political and\nphilosophical views palatable to religious authorities and ordinary\npeople is a hotly debated issue. Disciples of Leo Strauss and of\nMuhsin Mahdi divide al-Fârâbî’s views into\nexoteric ones for a broad audience and esoteric ones written for an\nintellectual elite. The exoteric are more compatible with the\nreligious views and speak, for instance, of an immortality of the\nhuman soul, whereas such views are deliberately muted in esoteric\nwritings (below we will see that a lost treatise of\nal-Fârâbî may have denied the immortality of the\nsoul). Among the most recent “Straussian” positions on\nthis debate one can find two papers by Charles E. Butterworth: (1)\n“How to Read Alafarabi” (2013), and (2)\n“Alfarabi’s Goal: Political Philosophy, Not Political\nTheology” (2011). Recently, Philippe Vallat (2019c) attempted to clarify what al-Farabi means by “esoterism,” Some other scholars such as Dimitri Gutas, S. Menn\nand Th.-A. Druart take Farabian metaphysics, including the\nNeo-Platonic descent as at the core of\nal-Fârâbî’s works, even if in his\nPhilosophy of Aristotle, al-Fârâbî treats\nlittle of metaphysics. We will say more on this controversy in\npresenting ethics and politics, which in the Farabian classification\nof sciences, follow metaphysics. \nAl-Fârâbî dealt little with ethics, but part of the\ncontroversy stems from what we may know of his lost Commentary on\nthe Nicomachean Ethics, his main foray in Ethics. Despite the\nexistence of an Arabic translation of Aristotle’s\nNicomachean Ethics (ed. by A. A. Akasoy & A. Fidora with\nan English translation by D.M. Dunlop, 2005), we see few signs of its\ninfluence in al-Fârâbî’s extant writings. Yet,\nal-Fârâbî wrote on it a lost commentary, to which\nthree Andalusian philosophers, Ibn Bâjja, Ibn Tufayl and\nAverroes, refer. According to them, therein\nal-Fârâbî denied the immortality of the human soul\nas well as the possibility of any conjunction with the active or Agent\nIntellect, considering them tall tales. Yet, in many other works, such\nas the Treatise on the Intellect, the Opinions, and\nthe Political Regime, he claims that this conjunction is\npossible and constitutes ultimate happiness. If what the Andalusian\nphilosophers report, presents an accurate reading of this lost text,\nthen the disciples of Leo Strauss may have some justification in reading\nal-Fârâbî’s works as divided between exoteric\nand esoteric ones since the content of this work would contradict\nviews in more popular texts, such as the Opinions in which\nthe Neo-Platonic influence is the strongest. Neo-Platonic metaphysics,\nconstrued mainly as the descent and emanation, would provide an\nexoteric view good for a more general public, but denied in the\nesoteric works reserved for an intellectual elite. Chaim\nMeir Neria (2013) published two quotations from this commentary (in\nHebrew translation and with English translation) that have been newly\ndiscovered and gave a summary of the issue.  \nThough we do not have any ethical text from\nal-Fârâbî relying mainly on the Nicomachean\nEthics, Marwan Rashed (2019) discussed his ethical outlook in relying on the Attainment of Happiness. We do have a brief ethical treatise in the tradition of\nHellenistic ethics, Directing Attention to the Way of\nHappiness or Tanbîh (not to be confused with the\nAttainment of Happiness or Tahsîl), which is\npropaedeutic to the study of philosophy proper and of logic in\nparticular (English translation in McGinnis & Reisman’s\nClassical Arabic Philosophy (2007: 104–20)). This\ntreatise (1) incites the student to curb his passions in order to be\nable to focus on his studies and (2) encourages him to begin the study\nof philosophy and of logic in particular. It is obviously\npre-philosophical and serves as introduction to a Farabian elementary\nintroduction to logic The Utterances Employed in Logic\n(Mahdi’s edition, 1968;\nno English translation). Al-Fârâbî’s\nconception of truly philosophical ethics remains unclear as we have so\nlittle extended textual basis to establish it. Janne Mattila (2017) compared the philosopher’s ethical progression in al-Farabi and in al-Razi. Ethics, when treating of our relations with other people, implies intersubjectivity, but al-Farabi, though not treating it much in what concerns this life, offers an interesting picture of it in the afterlife (Druart, 2017). \nAl-Fârâbi’s political philosophy fared much better\nand has attracted much attention from many scholars. According to\nThe Enumeration, it also includes kalâm, i.e.,\nnon-philosophical theology, and fiqh or Islamic law. Many\nFarabian political works have been translated into English. Muhsin\nMahdi translated three of them in Philosophy of Plato and\nAristotle (1969b; reprint 2001), which contains The Attainment\nof Happiness, The Philosophy of Plato, and The\nPhilosophy of Aristotle. These three texts form a trilogy.\nCharles E. Butterworth in, The Political Writings, vol. I\n(2001), translated Selected Aphorisms, part V of The\nEnumeration of the Sciences, Book of Religion, and\nThe Harmonization of the Two Opinions of the Two Sages: Plato the\nDivine and Aristotle and in vol. II (2015), Political\nRegime and Summary of Plato’s Laws.  \nAl-Fârâbî does not take inspiration from\nAristotle’s Politics (a text which does not seem to\nhave been translated or summarized into Arabic) but rather takes some\ninspiration from Plato’s Republic and Laws,\neven if his access to these two texts may have been rather limited, as\nthere is some doubt that a full Arabic translation of them ever\nexisted. Though Averroes wrote a commentary of sort on the\nRepublic, its brevity and content do not testify to an\nin-depth knowledge of the whole text. Yet, David C. Reisman (2004)\ndiscovered an Arabic translation of a single passage from the\nRepublic (VI, 506d3–509b10). As for the Laws,\nwe certainly have al-Fârâbî’s Summary of\nPlato’s Laws, but this text (Arabic ed. by Th.-A. Druart\n(1998) and English translation by Butterworth, in The Political\nWritings, II, (2015: 129–73)) is very brief and covers only\nthe first eight books. Whether this summary relies on a full or\npartial Arabic translation of the Laws or on a translation of\na Greek summary, possibly that of Galen (lost in Greek), at this stage\ncannot be determined. For the latest status quaestionis about\nArabic translations of Plato’s works and their paucity, see\nDimitri Gutas (2012). Al-Fârâbî’s own brief\nPhilosophy of Plato does not exhibit detailed knowledge of\nPlato’s works. \nThough al-Fârâbî’s political philosophy takes\nsome inspiration from Plato, it much transforms it in important and\ninteresting ways to reflect a very different world and adapt it to it.\nInstead of a monolingual and monoethnic city state,\nal-Fârâbî envisions a vast multicultural,\nmultilingual, and multireligious empire (Alexander Orwin, 2017). He also sees the necessity to\nmake of the philosopher king a philosopher prophet ruler.  \nAl-Fârâbî’s Summary of Plato’s\nLaws caused much controversy, which Butterworth narrates in the\nintroduction to his translation (2015: 97–127). In 1995 Joshua\nParens, making use of a draft of Druart’s edition, published\nMetaphysics as Rhetoric: Alfarabi’s Summary of\nPlato’s “Laws”. He argued that\nal-Fârâbî takes metaphysics, or maybe more exactly\nspecial metaphysics or the Neo-Platonic descent, i.e., what treats of\nimmaterial beings rather than ontology, as a form of rhetoric, and\nthat such was already the case for Plato. Whether or not we should\nread Plato as Parens and other Straussians claim\nal-Fârâbî understood him is a hotly debated\nquestion.  \nMarwan Rashed (2009) introduced a new element in the controversy by\nputting into serious doubt the authenticity of\nal-Fârâbî’s Harmonization of the Opinions\nof the Two Sages. Following an Alexandrian tradition, this\ntreatise (for Butterworth’s 2001 English translation, see above)\nargues that, despite a series of issues on which Aristotle and Plato\nseem to contradict each other, there is remarkable harmony between\nthese two sages, as one can easily resolve such contradictions. This\ntext also refers 1. to the so-called Aristotle’s Theology,\nwhich in fact Aristotle never wrote, as it derives from Plotinus, and 2. to Proclus Arabus, as Peter Adamson (forthcoming) shows. On\nthe other hand, Cecilia Martini Bonadeo, in her 2008 critical edition\nand Italian translation of this text (al-Fârâbî,\nL’armonia delle opinioni dei due sapienti, il divino Platone\ne Aristotele), argued for the Farabian authenticity of this text.\nWhether one accepts the Farabian authorship of this text affects\none’s understanding of the whole controversy of how to read\nal-Fârâbî, as well as one’s understanding of\nthe relationship between his Aristotelianism and his Neo-Platonism. It\nalso makes the whole issue of the relationship between his metaphysics\nand his political philosophy still more complex and convoluted. \nAmong the most recent developments, expressed in various articles, on\nthe Straussian side, let us point to Butterworth’s “How to\nRead Alfarabi” (2013) and “Alfarabi’s Goal:\nPolitical Philosophy, Not Political Theology” (2011) to which I\nreferred earlier. On the other side, we can point to Charles\nGenequand’s “Théologie et philosophie. La\nprovidence chez al-Fârâbî et\nl’authenticité de l’Harmonie des opinions des\ndeux sages” (2012), which objects to M. Rashed’s\ndeclaring the Harmonization inauthentic, and his (2013)\n“Le Platon d’al-Fârâbî”. Amor\nCherni (2015), on the other hand, published a book on the\nrelation between politics and metaphysics in\nal-Fârâbî (La cité et ses opinions:\nPolitique et métaphysique ches Abû Nasr\nal-Fârâbî), which includes an appendix\nrejecting the authenticity of The Harmonization.  \nThough we now have more decent editions of\nal-Fârâbî’s texts and more complete\ntranslations, in English and in French in particular, many such\neditions and translations are scattered in various books and journals.\nGathering all of al-Fârâbî’s available texts\nis no mean accomplishment. If Oxford University Press would publish\nThe Philosophical Works of al-Fârâbî, as it\ndid for al-Kindî in 2012 (one volume, ed. by P. Adamson &\nP.E. Pormann), beginning with those still untranslated or not fully\ntranslated into English, as well as those whose English translation is\nhidden in rare books or unusual journals, we would be eternally\ngrateful, but we are well aware that it would require several volumes\nand much time.  \nSome texts still need to be better edited. Some texts are not\ntranslated at all into any European language or not yet into English.\nScholars do not always seem fully aware of what is available and what\nother scholars have said. Much more work still needs to be done, but a\nclearer and more complex picture of\nal-Fârâbî’s works is emerging. It highlights\ntheir breadth and sophistication, even if we still have trouble\npiecing together all the parts. ","contact.mail":"druart@cua.edu","contact.domain":"cua.edu"}]
