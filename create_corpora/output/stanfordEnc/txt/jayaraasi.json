His main claim is that it is not\npossible to arrive at true knowledge with standard means recognized by\nthe traditionally adopted model of cognitive procedures\n(pramāṇa) in Indian epistemology, because one should first\nproperly define basic criteria of validity for valid cognitive\nprocedures, which is not possible without a prior true knowledge of\nreality against which we could test the procedures for validity etc.\nAs it is traditionally argued, our knowledge of reality and of objects\ndepends on valid cognitive procedures. However, as Jayarāśi\npoints out, all valid cognitive procedures are either fundamentally\nflawed and ultimately unreliable or they require further valid\ncognitive procedures, and these stand in the same need etc. Therefore,\nwithin the traditional epistemological model, we can neither formulate\nproper definitions of valid cognitive procedures nor define what\nreality is and what basic categories are. This is at least the case,\nhe claims, with all the cognitive tools and epistemological categories\nwhich are traditionally claimed to be now at our disposal. He has been\ndifferently classified as a sceptic, agnostic or materialist.\n\nThe first serious attempt to date Jayarāśi\nBhaṭṭa was undertaken by Sukhlāljī\nSaṁghavī and Rasiklāl C. Pārīkh, who brought\nthe Tattvôpaplava-siṁha to light, in their 1940 edition\n(p. iv-xi) of the treatise, assign the work to 8th century (p. x).\nThis dating was slightly modified by Sukhlāljī\nSaṁghavī (1941) who placed Jayarāśi’s\nTattvôpaplava-siṁha between 725–825, which, in turn, is\naccepted by Eli Franco (1987: 12–13). However, the latter, in\nthe ‘Preface to the second edition’ of 1994, modifies the\ndate of Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa and assigns him to the\nperiod of 770–830 on the basis of what he thinks are\nJayarāśi’s indirect references (primarily terminological\ngrounds) to the Buddhist philosopher Dharmottara (ca.\n740–800). \nIn fact, that dating of the Tattvôpaplava-siṁha could be\nslightly modified to perhaps 800–840. I would place\nJayarāśi Bhaṭṭa after the Digambara Jaina\nphilosopher Akalaṅka Bhaṭṭa (c. 720–780) and\nbefore Vidyānanda Pātrakesarisvāmin (c. 850), a\nphilosopher in the same tradition who commented on Akalaṅka. As\nFranco (1994: XI) himself notices, the Buddhist Kamalaśīla\n(c. 740–795) nowhere refers to Jayarāśi in his\nencyclopedic commentary of the Tattva-saṅgraha. Further, we\nfind no mention of Jayarāśi in the oeuvre of Akalaṅka\nBhaṭṭa, although he was very well acquainted with current\nideas of his contemporaries. It would be especially surprising in the\ncase of Akalaṅka Bhaṭṭa not to mention an author who\ngreatly influenced the way Jaina thinkers argued and formulated their\nthoughts, because both of them seem to belong to South India. On a few\noccasions Akalaṅka did have a chance to either allude or even\ndirectly refer to such an original thinker as Jayarāśi\ncertainly was, but he nowhere does it. A good instance is\nAkalaṅka’s work Aṣṭa-śatī ‘In Eight\nHundred Lines’ (itself a commentary on the work\nĀpta-mīmāṁsā, ‘An Examination of An\nAuthoritative Person’) of Samantabhadra, c. 580–640). In\nit, (the commentary on verse 1.3 of\nĀpta-mīmāṁsā, AṣŚp.2 = AṣS\n29.20), Akalaṅka refers to a materialist argument: ‘[The\nopponent]: “For this reason it has been said that there is no\nomniscient person, because truth claims [of various teachers competing\nfor primacy] turn out to be wrong cognitive criteria, inasmuch as\nthere is no difference between them (i.e., all are equal in their\nconvincing force). Since one accepts that [it is not possible to\ndecide for or against a view among a few competing ones], there is\nnothing wrong [in rejecting the idea of an omniscient person].”\n[Akalaṅka:] Ergo this decision of some [thinkers, i.e.,\nmaterialists] is itself void of any rational basis. For, as we know,\nthe scope of perception [which could prove the materialist’s rejection\nof an omniscient person] cannot itself demonstrate that there cannot\nbe any other proof of an omniscient person, because this would have\ntoo far-reaching consequences. Neither can [the materialist prove that\nan omniscient person cannot exist] with the help of inference\n (anumāna), because it has no validity [for him]’.\nAkalaṅka clearly has in mind a typical materialist philosopher\nwho rejects the idea of omniscience, but at the same time accepts\nperception (pratyakṣa) as the only valid instrument of\nknowledge, while rejecting the validity of inference (anumāna).\nThat is a standard account of a materialist (Cārvāka /\nLokāyata) thinker in India and there is really nothing to suggest\nthat what Akalaṅka had here in mind as the target of his\ncriticism was a ‘qualified sceptic’ (like\nJayarāśi) who rejected the ultimate validity also of\nperception. \nHowever, the account changes in what Vidyānanda (c. 850) has to\nsay on Akalaṅka’s passage. Vidyānanda is, to our knowledge,\nthe first Indian philosopher to know of and to directly refer to\nJayarāśi. In his Aṣṭa-sahasrī ‘In\nEight Thousand Lines’, Vidyānanda (AṣS 29.20–36.6)\ntakes the passage ‘“Since one accepts that [it is not\npossible to decide for or against a view among a few competing ones],\nthere is nothing wrong [in rejecting the idea of an omniscient\nperson].” [Akalaṅka:] Ergo this decision of some\n[thinkers, i.e., materialists] is itself void of any rational\nbasis’ (tathêṣṭatvād adoṣa ity\nekeṣām\naprāmāṇikaivêṣṭiḥ) as\nexplicitly implying two kinds of approaches to the same question.\nFirst (AṣS 29.20 ff.), he says some nihilistic thinkers (eke)\nare the Laukāyatika (the followers of Lokāyata, the\nmaterialist school), who do not admit any instrument of knowledge\nwhich would could go beyond the perceptible world, i.e., they accept\nperception as the only cognitive criterion. Second, Vidyānanda\nsays (AṣS 31.2 ff.), there are also ‘those who propound\nthe dissolution of [all] categories’\n(tattvôpaplava-vādin), a term which could hardly be more\nunivocal in its clearly referring to Jayarāśi. Had\nAkalaṅka known of Jayarāśi, his ‘qualified\nscepticism’ and rejection of the validity of perception also, he\nwould have included him among those who rejected the idea of an\nomniscient being. \nThat Jayarāśi postdates Akalaṅka is evident also from\nthe fact that, in his Ascertainment of Perfection\n(Siddhi-viniścaya), Akalaṅka refers to\n‘heretics’ (nāstika) and to the materialist\ntradition, which maintains that the world is composed of the four\nelements, but at the same time accepts only one valid cognitive\nprocedure (pramāṇa), namely perception (pratyakṣa),\nnot even inference (anumāna), and therefore cannot demonstrate\nsuch element-based structure of the universe, or alternatively\nentertains a possibility that there are no valid cognitive procedures\nat all (pramāṇâbhāva) or finds problems with\ndefining what perception is\n(pramāṇa-lakṣaṇânupapatti; SVi 4.12, p.\n272.3–5). These are clearly the forerunners of the ideas\nelaborated by Jayarāśi, however at the time of\nAkalaṅka they are still in an undeveloped form, and clearly the\nJaina philosopher does not refer to Jayarāśi. However, his\ncommentator Anantavīrya (SViṬ, p. 277.6–278.22)\nimmediately recognizes in these nascent ideas the elaborated system of\nJayarāśi, retroactively projecting them onto\nAkalaṅka’s passage, and refers to Jayarāśi and\nhis treatise by name. \nAs little as we know of the exact dates of his life even less we know\nabout the place where he flourished, and we are actually left to\nspeculations, for no hard evidence, such as inscriptions etc., can be\nfound to help us. There are three points that might suggest\nJayarāśi was of South India, all being rather weak. The\nstrongest evidence is the circulation and reception of the\nTattvôpaplava-siṁha: the first mention of the work is made\nby South Indian Digambara authors Vidyānanda (c. 850) and\nAnantavīrya (turn of 10th and 11th centuries). Another equally\nweak piece of evidence is that Jayarāśi’s critical method of\nargument (see below), which the Jainas adopt, first penetrates the\nworks of South Indian Digambara authors, incidentally the same who are\nthe first to make reference to Jayarāśi. This method of\ncritique becomes the standard one among Gujarati Jainas only at a\nlater stage. The third argument in favour of South Indian origin of\nJayarāśi (Saṁghavī–Pārīkh 1940,\nxi), even weaker that the two above, is his title Bhaṭṭa,\nregularly appended to the names of a number of South Indian\nphilosophers and often used as an official title of South Indian\nDigambara high rank clerics (bhaṭṭa,\nbhaṭṭāraka). Jayarāśi’s title might suggest\nhe was both South Indian and a Brahmin by social class (varṇa).\nHowever, the title Bhaṭṭa is not exclusively used by\nBrahmins or exclusively in South India, though there is indeed a\ncertain tendency of this kind. However, since there seems nothing at\nall to suggest that Jayarāśi was born in North India, even\nsuch slight hints gain some evidential weight. \nThe only preserved work of Jayarāśi is the\nTattvôpaplava-siṁha (‘The Lion [Destroying] the\nDelusion of Categories’, often interpreted as ‘The Lion of\nthe Dissolution of [all] Categories’ or ‘The Lion which\nAnnihilates [all] Principles’). Its palm leaf manuscript was\ndiscovered in 1926 in a manuscript library at Patan by\nSukhlāljī Saṁghavī and Rasiklāl C.\nPārīkh, and the text remained virtually unknown until its\npublication in 1940. \nThe work was quite well known in mediaeval philosophical milieu, both\nin the South and North of India, but hardly ever treated in a way a\nserious and original philosophical treatise deserves: Indian\nphilosophers of established traditions do not, as a rule, refer to the\nwork directly or refute its contents, not to mention any attempt at\nthe providing a genuine appraisal of the work or entering into\ndiscussion with its author. They simply ignored it. \nTwo reasons might be mentioned for such a situation. First, Indian\nphilosophers did not principally engage in discussions with\nrepresentatives of the materialist school, except for standardised\ndismissive refutations of a few basic materialist theories, which are\nmentioned by Indian philosophers in their works in order to render a\n‘complete’ picture of the philosophical spectrum. These\nstandardised, habitually repeated refutations were not applicable to\nJayarāśi, who was not a typical representative of the\nCārvāka / Lokāyata school. New powerful philosophical\nmachinery would have to be applied to engage in a discussion with\nJayarāśi. And that is precisely the second reason: the\narguments Jayarāśi consistently applies, his rigid and\ncoherent lines of argumentation proved to be an extremely hard piece\nof cake to swallow for those whose views he criticised. It seems,\ntherefore, that the general approach of Indian philosophers\nvis-à-vis Jayarāśi was that of disregard and failure\nto notice the weight of his work. A few exceptions can be mentioned\nthough of those who attempted to engage with\nJayarāśi’s arguments, notably two Jaina philosophers,\nVidyānanda and Anantavīrya, and a propounder of the\nNyāya system, Bhāsarvajña (Franco (1994: \n553–586)). Jayarāśi is occasionally mentioned in a\npositive light when Indian authors acknowledge his powerful method of\ncritical analysis, and these are primarily, or even exclusively, Jaina\nauthors. Sometimes they even refer to Jayarāśi as an expert\nin some fields, e.g. by Malliṣeṇa (c. 1229), who says:\n‘A refutation of all cognitive criteria in details should be\nconsulted from the Tattvôpaplava-siṁha’ (SVM,\np.118.1–2). \nThe text of Tattvôpaplava-siṁha was preserved without any\ncommentary and it seems that its was never commented upon. We cannot\nsay with absolute certainty whether its author had any followers or\nwhether he established an independent school, but that is not unlikely\nbecause we occasionally come across the expression\ntattvôpaplava-vādin in the plural: ‘those who\npropound the dissolution of [all] categories’ in philosophical\nliterature, and across the single term Tattvôpaplava used as if\nit denoted a separate school. \nIt is not certain whether Jayarāśi composed any other work.\nHe himself refers to a treatise entitled Lakṣaṇa-sāra\n(‘The Quintessence of the Definition [of Cognitive Criteria\n(pramāṇa)]’) on one occasion, while refuting the\nusage of the term ‘non-verbal’ (avyapadeśya) in the\ndefinition of the cognitive criterion (pramāṇa, or\n‘veridical instrument of knowledge’) of the Nyāya\nschool. There, he says that the inapplicability of the term has\nalready been shown in the Lakṣaṇa-sāra and one should\nconsult that work. It is highly probable that he indeed refers to his\nown text for the simple reason that he generally does not mention any\nworks of any other authors either in support of his own views or in\nfavourable light, except for the materialist teacher Bṛhaspati\nand his Bṛhaspati-sūtra. Still, it is not impossible that\nthe text he referred to under the title Lakṣaṇa-sāra\nmight have been penned by another representative of the\nCārvāka / Lokāyata school who had been held in esteem\nby Jayarāśi, e.g. his own guru. \nThere has been some controversy concerning whether Jayarāśi\ncould at all be ranked among the representatives of the Indian\nmaterialist school, i.e., among the Cārvākas /\nLokāyatas. Until the publication of the\nTattvôpaplava-siṁha, Jayarāśi was considered a\ntypical representative of the materialist school. It all changed when\nthe publication of the work in 1940 made the text available to\nscholars. The publication revealed that Jayarāśi’s view are\nfar from what one considered  ‘standard’ or\n‘orthodox’ materialism and hardly compatible with what we\nso far knew about the schools of the Cārvākas /\nLokāyatas. As a result, a wide range of conflicting\ninterpretations abound as to how to classify\nJayarāśi’s philosophy. \nSukhlāljī Saṁghavī and Rasiklāl C.\nPārīkh (1940: xi-xii) take the text as ‘a work of the\nLokāyata or Cārvāka school, or to be more precise\n– of a particular division of that school’, emphasising\nthat Jayarāśi ‘is developing the doctrine of the\northodox (!) Lokāyata’  with a ‘critical\nmethod’ (p. xii). The tradition of ascribing the view to\nSaṁghavī and Pārīkh that the\nTattvôpaplava-siṁha is ‘a genuine Cārvāka\nwork’ relies rather on the misreading of what both the authors\nsay: they are well aware that Jayarāśi develops an original\nand independent school within what he himself considered a materialist\ntradition. This view, adopted also by Ruben (1958), is somewhat\nmodified by Franco (1987: 4–8), who speaks of a ‘radical\nchange from a rather primitive materialism to a highly sophisticated\nform of scepticism’, and also recently by Ethan Mills (2018),\nwho claims that Jayarāśi developed ‘materialist\nstrains’ and represented ‘skepticism about\nphilosophy’, or ‘skepticism about epistemology’\n(Mills (2015), (2018)). \nThus, a group of other researchers (e.g., Koller (1977), Matilal\n(1985: 482), Matilal (1986: 27), Solomon (2010: xvi), Jha (2013: vii),\nGokhale (2015: 156–157), Mills (2018)) classify\nJayarāśi as a sceptic, either loosely affiliated to the\nCārvāka / Lokāyata tradition or not at all, even as an\nanti-religious sceptic (Matilal (1985: 482)), a radical sceptic\n(Franco (1987: 3–8)), ‘the full-fledged form of Indian\nSkepticism’ (Solomon (2010: xvi)), an extreme sceptic who\nrepresents ‘a kind of anarchism in the realm of values’\n(Gokhale (2015: 180, 155)), sometimes also as an agnostic (Ruben\n(1958); Matilal (1985: 483, n. 10)), or a combination of both, being\nan author of ‘a work in defence of scepticism, or at best,\nagnosticism’ (Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya’s\n“Editor’s Note” to\nChattopadhyaya–Gangopadhyaya (1990: xiv)). A rather unusual\nstance on Jayarāśi’s affiliation is represented by\nK.K. Dixit (1962: 103) / (1990: 529), who claims that he was both a\nmaterialist and… ‘a worshipper of illogic’\n(sic!). \nStill another line of researchers disagree that Jayarāśi\nbelonged to the materialist tradition at all, typical proponents of\nthis opinion being Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya (1959), (1989) and Karel\nWerner (1995). Chattopadhyaya (1989) argues that since\nJayarāśi criticises all philosophical views and schools, he\ncannot be reckoned as an adherent of the Cārvāka /\nLokāyata tradition, because one can either be a materialist or\nsceptic; and clearly Jayarāśi’s philosophical views do not\nfit into the typical materialist framework. Karel Werner (1995) seems\nto support such an approach, although with some reservations, but\nwithout any solid rational argument, except for an subjective\nimpression. Recently, also Ramkrishna Bhattacharya (2009: 51, 76 n.\n43) follows this line of interpretations and argues that\n‘Jayarāśi was not a\nCārvāka/Lokāyata’, suggesting that he was not a\nsceptic but represented ‘a fundamental idealist (solipsist)\nposition’. To this group belong also both A.K. Warder (1956:\n52), who accepts that he was neither a materialist nor sceptic but a\npositivist instead, and K.N. Jayatilleke (1963: 82), who interprets\nhim as ‘not a sceptic but an absolute nihilist in his\nmetaphysics’ and ‘a pragmatic materialist’ and\n‘a logical sceptic’ (p. 91). \nThere could hardly be a better source of information on the true\naffiliation of Jayarāśi than the author himself. He nowhere\nstates in his work that he is a Cārvāka / Lokāyata, in\nwhich he does not differ from all other Indian authors who nowhere\nmention their philosophical affiliations in the form: ‘The\nauthor of the present work is Buddhist’ or ‘I am a\nfollower of the Nyāya school’. In most cases, such\naffiliations are communicated through the opening sections, e.g. in\nthe introductory verses (maṅgalâcaraṇa), or in the\ncolophons, but usually an indirect manner, e.g. by paying homage to\nthe Awakened One (buddha) or to a guru or Mahêśvara, or\nthrough some other hint, but it is hardly ever done directly, in an\nunequivocal manner. Unfortunately, the preserved text of\nTattvôpaplava-siṁha does not contain any introductory\nverses (probably there were none). The only concealed information in\nthe opening section of the work could be found the first verse that\noccurs in the very beginning which says: ‘The worldly path\n(laukiko mārgaḥ) should be followed…/ With respect\nto everyday practice of the world (loka-vyavahāra), the fool and\nthe wise are similar’ (TUS, p.1.9–10 = Franco (1987:\n68–6–7)  = Solomon (2010: 1–2) = Jha (2013: 2)),\nquoted from some other source, taken as authoritative by\nJayarāśi. The expression ‘the worldly path’\n(laukiko mārgaḥ) often occurs as a reference to the\nLokāyata (‘the followers of the worldly [practice]’),\ne.g. by Haribhadra in his ŚVS1.64. Most importantly, however,\nJayarāśi on several occasions quotes verses of\nBṛhaspati in order to either support his own opinion or to show\nthat there is no disagreement between the\nTattvôpaplava-siṁha and the tradition of Bṛhaspati\n (cf. Franco (1987: 5)). Further, he explicitly mentions the\nmaterialist teacher by name and refers to him with reverence\n‘Honourable Bṛhaspati’ (bhagavān\nbṛhaspatiḥ, TUS, p.45.10–11 = Franco (1987: 228.10)\n = Solomon (2010: 229) = Jha (2013:\n 187)),[1]\n the reverential term occurring only once in the whole work. This is\nrather unique, for Jayarāśi does not seem to follow any\nauthorities or to quote passages and opinions which he unreservedly\nviews in favourable light. There can hardly be any doubt, that\nJayarāśi placed himself within that tradition and apparently\nacknowledged that he was originally trained within it. \nIn the colophon of the treatise (TUP, p. 125.13–18 = Franco\n(1987: 7) = Solomon (2010: 98) = Jha (2013: 463–464)),\nJayarāśi explicitly pays homage to Bṛhaspati, here\nreferred to by his traditional epithet ‘preceptor of gods’\n(sura-guru; cf. Bhattacharya (2009: 25, 51, 76)), and so does the\nauthor refers to himself as ‘preceptor of deities (gods)’\n(deva-guru): \n‘Even [all] such unshakeable reductio arguments (vikalpa) that\nescaped the attention of the  preceptor of gods (i.e.\nBṛhaspati) find their way into this lucid [treatise] that\ncrushes the conceit of charlatans. This [lucid treatise], titled\n“The Lion [Destroying] the Delusion of Categories”, which\ncontributes to great advantage and will gain excellent reputation, has\nbeen composed by [me], the preceptor of deities (gods) [known as]\nBhaṭṭa Śrī\n Jayarāśi.[2]\n [These] reductio arguments of Jayarāśi [found] in this\n[treatise] are efficacious in annihilating the charlatans, are\nelaborated by [Jayarāśi who is] the ocean of knowledge, [and\nare meant to] vanquish disputants.’ \nThe idea which Jayarāśi here expresses is clear: he follows\nthe footsteps of his own preceptor, Bṛhaspati (both\n‘preceptor of gods’), developing the latter’s\narguments and augmenting them with his own, more sophisticated. \nJayarāśi criticises basically all philosophical schools with\ntwo exceptions: the Advaita Vedānta of Śaṅkara and the\nCārvāka / Lokāyata school. The reason for being silent\non the tradition of Śaṅkara was that the latter was either\ncontemporaneous or posterior to Jayarāśi, but there would\nhave been no reason not to formulate any criticism against the\nCārvāka / Lokāyata school, if that had not been\nJayarāśi’s own tradition. Further, even though\nJayarāśi is generally very cautious not to express his own\npositive views and theories, there are several exceptions, which\nclearly reveal his materialistic outlook (see \n Section 2.3 Positive Views below). \nThere is also some external evidence corroborating to a certain degree\nthe thesis about Cārvāka / Lokāyata affiliation of\nJayarāśi. Vidyānanda who first mentions\nJayarāśi brings some interesting details to light (alluded\nto above). In his Aṣṭa-śatī (AṣS\n29.20–36.7), he explicitly indicates a category of nihilistic thinkers\nwho reject a number of vital principles and claim that ‘There is\nno [reliable] omniscient authority (tīrtha-kāra), there is\nno [reliable] cognitive criterion (pramāṇa), there is no\n[reliable] authoritative doctrine (samaya) or [reliable] Vedas, or any\nkind of [reliable] reasoning (tarka), because they contradict each\nother,’ and he quotes a popular verse: ‘Reasoning is not\nestablished, testimonies differ, there is no sage whose words are a\ncognitive criterion (i.e., authoritative), the essence of the moral\nlaw (dharma) is concealed in a secret place (i.e., is not available).\nThe [proper] path is that taken by the majority of\n people’[3].\n Whether the verse comes from an unidentified Lokāyata source,\nwhich is not impossible, or not, it is echoed by Jayarāśi in\nthe above mentioned verse at the beginning of his work and the\nexpression ‘the worldly path’ (laukiko mārgaḥ).\nInterestingly, the verse has an obvious sceptical underpinning. The\ncategory of such ‘nihilists’ includes (1) the followers of\nthe Lokāyata school (laukāyatika, AṣS 29.26), also\nknown as the Cārvāka (AṣS 30.25), who are associated\nwith the view that there is just one cognitive criterion, i.e.\nperception, and (2) the category of ‘those who propound the\ndissolution of [all] categories’\n(tattvôpaplava-vādin, AṣS 31.2). Vidyānanda\n(AṣS 31.2 ff.) explains who the latter are: ‘Some who are\nthose who propound the dissolution of [all] categories take (1) all\nthe categories of cognitive criteria such as perception etc. and (2)\nall the categories of the cognoscibles as dissolved (i.e., not\nestablished)’. Throughout his text, Vidyānanda keeps these\ntwo traditions – the Lokāyata and the Tattvôpaplava —\nseparate, although he does acknowledge that they are genetically\nrelated, the main difference between them being whether one recognises\nat least one cognitive criterion (Cārvāka / Lokāyata)\nor none (Jayarāśi). Further on, Vidyānanda begins the\nexposition of materialism (AṣS, p. 35.22 ff.) which is\ndesignated with a generic term ‘cognitive criteria-free\nassumption’ (apramāṇikā …\niṣṭi), among which the first variety represents standard\nmaterialists who accept perception as the only cognitive criterion\n(AṣS, p. 35.19–37.9), and the second variety concerns\n‘those who propound the dissolution of [all] categories’\n(tattvôpaplava-vādin) who do not accept any cognitive\ncriteria (pramāṇa) (AṣS, p. 37.10 ff.). Also\nAnantavīrya explicitly classifies Jayarāśi as a\nmaterialist by making a pun the the word cārvāka: ‘The\nauthor of “[The Lion Destroying] the Delusion of\nCategories’” says what is charmingly chastised by the\nCārvākas’ (SViṬ, p. 277.19:\ntattvôpaplava-kṛd āha –\ncārvākaiś cāru carcitam…). \nA typical charge against Jayarāśi’s affiliation to\nmaterialists (Cārvāka / Lokāyata), known for two main\nclaims – that there is only one cognitive criterion\n(pramāṇa), namely perception, and the four elements compose\nall the universe, including consciousness – would the apparent\nparadox: Jayarāśi seems to acknowledge neither. This led\nBhattacharya (2017: 353–354) to dispute, on philologically\nimplausible grounds, that Jayarāśi refers to Bṛhaspati\nand the Bṛhaspati-sūtra as his own tradition. However, the\nearliest external recipients of Jayarāśi’s ideas, the\nJaina thinkers Vidyānanda and Anantavīrya, importantly\nascribe to Jayarāśi or to his immediate materialist\ntradition a saying that ‘Bṛhaspati’s aphorisms are\nprimarily meant to refute the opponents with respect to all\n [issues].’[4]\n This serves as an external evidence that Jayarāśi did\nacknowledge the authority of  Bṛhaspati and his aphorisms\nbut interpreted them in the spirit of his own methodological\nscepticism. \nThat there must have been some strain among the materialists prior to\nJayarāśi which both admitted that the world is composed of\nthe four elements and at the same time apparently doubted that there\nis any cognitive criterion (pramāṇa) is reflected by\nAkalaṅka, who points to the following paradox such a materialist\nwould have to face: ‘As a result of the absence of cognitive\ncriteria (pramāṇa) [the materialist] cannot ascertain that\nperception, and nothing else, is the only one [cognitive criterion],\nor [ascertain] the essence of cognoscible objects. Since, when other\ncognitive criteria are negated, a [proper] definition of perception\nbecomes inexplicable, what [cognoscible objects] by what [cognitive\ncriteria] could be established or negated, on account of which [one\ncould maintain that] the world is composed of the four\nelements?’ (SVi 4.12, p. 272.3–5). \nOf significance is that Vidyānanda puts Jayarāśi on par\nwith the Buddhist doctrine of Emptiness (śūnya-vāda),\nas represented by Nāgārjuna, and with Vedāntic\nidealists (brahma-vāda), as three kinds of self-refuting theories\n(TŚVA 80.22–81.14; 195.14–16). This might\ntheoretically be taken as evidence that all three represented\nscepticism. However, since there is no hint that Vedāntic\nidealists were sceptics at all at that\n time,[5]\n and we have strong evidence that Jayarāśi was not a\nsceptic, what Mills (2018) takes to be the three pillars of skepticism\nin classical India, namely Nāgārjuna, Jayarāśi and\nŚriharṣa, represented here by a forerunner, cannot be\nclassified as sceptics, despite their commonalities, as noticed by\nVidyānanda. \nJayarāśi can be therefore taken as a genuine representative\nof an offshoot of the Cārvāka / Lokāyata tradition,\nprimarily because he himself thought he was a follower of\nBṛhaspati’s materialist tradition, and probably because he had\noriginally been trained in the materialist system. It also seems very\nlikely that the representatives of the Cārvāka /\nLokāyata system occasionally had sceptical inclinations prior to\nJayarāśi, which helped him to abandon typically materialist\nclaims and undertake his sceptical project. However, neither he nor\nhis work can be taken as typical representatives of the\nCārvāka / Lokāyata school or a first-hand source of\ninformation about that tradition. Despite this, the work remains the\nonly authentic, albeit not ‘orthodox’ treatise of the\nCārvāka / Lokāyata tradition that has come down to\nus. \nJayarāśi can be classified as a sceptic  only in a\nqualified sense (‘qualified sceptic’), namely as a kind of\nmethodological sceptic, who consistently avails himself of a\nparticular method to analyse theories and the contents of\npropositions, but at the same time retains a set of positive\nbeliefs. \nThe point of departure of his methodology is a sophisticated and\nhighly elaborated reductio type of argument (prasaṅga),\ndeveloped earlier within the Madhyamaka school of Buddhism and its\nprominent adherent Nagārjuna (c. 150 CE). \nIn his method, Jayarāśi analyses a particular thesis T of\nhis opponent by, first, listing all logical implications or all\ndoctrinally possible conclusions C1, C2,\nC3, … Cn, admissible within the\nopponent’s system, that follow from thesis T. Then he demonstrates how\nand why each of such conclusions C1, C2,\nC3, … Cn either leads to an\nundesired consequence (logically problematic or unwelcome within the\nopponent’s system) or contradicts the initial thesis T: \nwhere ‘0’ stands not simply for ‘false’\n(logically), but may also stand for ‘not admissible within the\nopponent’s specific set of beliefs’, or ‘not compatible\nwith the opponent’s specific set of beliefs’. To analyse the\ntruth value or admissibility of each of the conclusions C1,\nC2, C3, … Cn, if their\nstructure is complex, Jayarāśi analyses the conclusions in\ntheir turn using exactly the same method. \nWhat may look like a well-known logical law that underlies the\nreductio ad absurdum argument, i.e., \nor like other typical laws of the proof by contradiction, i.e., \n[(~p→q) ∧ (~p→~q)] →\np, \n[~p → (q∧~q)] → p, or \n[~p → (q≡~q)] → p , \nseems at first closely mirrored by Jayarāśi. However, his\napproach is significantly different in one particular aspect. First,\nJayarāśi analyses positive theses in order to disprove them.\nSecondly, the reductio or the proof by contradiction, whereby p is\nrejected, does not commit one to admitting ~p in the sense of\naccepting a positive state of affairs contrary to p.\nJayarāśi is satisfied merely with a rejection of a thesis,\nwithout postulating his own solution to a problem. In other words,\nwhen Jayarāśi disproves thesis T by demonstrating that its\nconclusions C1, C2, C3, …\nCn are all wrong (either false or doctrinally\ninadmissible), he does not commit himself to the contrary thesis ~T\nwith some kind of ontological entailment. The better way to describe\nhis method would be the following patterns: \n[(p→q) ∧ ~q] → ~p, \n[(p→q) ∧ (p→~q)] →\n~p, \n[p → (q∧~q)] → ~p, or \n[p → (q≡~q)] → ~p , \nTo give an example, Jayarāśi first skillfully demonstrates\nthat the universal cannot exist by mentioning three possible\nconclusions: If (T) the universal exists, then (C1) the\nuniversal is different from the individuals in which it is\ninstantiated, (C2) it is not different from the\nindividuals, or (C3) it is different from the individuals\nin some aspects and it is not different from the individuals in other\naspects. Each of these options is then analysed into further options,\nall being eventually shown as wrong or impossible. Since all the three\nconclusions C1, C2 and C3 are\nrejected, the initial thesis T (‘the universal exists’) is\nalso rejected. However, he does not say what at all exists, if there\nare no universals. \nIn his method, Jayarāśi does not mention all logically\nconceivable conclusions entailed by a thesis he wants to disprove. In\nmost cases, he limits himself just to those implications which are\nrelevant to the discussion with a particular philosophical school, and\nall other logical or thinkable implications of which we know that the\nopponent would never admit for a variety of reason are simply\nignored. \nInterestingly, the critical method of analysis of the reductio type\n(prasaṅga) which Jayarāśi so amply uses is basically\nabsent in the works of the Digambara philosopher Akalaṅka,\nwhereas the method is regularly used by his commentator\nVidyānanda and all subsequent Jaina thinkers, which may have its\nhistorical relevance and suggest that Jayarāśi was posterior\nto Akalaṅka. \nThe reductionist tactics, which Jayarāśi shared with the\nMādhyamika Buddhists, was traditionally classified by Brahmanic\nphilosophers, e.g. the Naiyāyikas, as an eristical dispute or\nrefutation-only debate (vitaṇḍā) and considered as a\nnon-genuine argument, because the goal of an authentic debate was to\nstrive for truth, understood of course in positive terms. Were such\ncriticisms denying Jayarāśi a genuine argumentative value\njustified? Clearly not, and for a variety of reasons, the most\nimportant being that the main objective of Jayarāśi is\nindicated in the title of his treatise: the dissolution of all\ncategories. How should we understand it? Was his approach purely\nnegative, eristical, nihilistic or agnostic? His main objective, it\nseems, was not necessarily the strong claim that no truths can ever be\nknown. Rather his intention was to show the fundamental dependence of\nour knowledge of reality on cognitive means and categories we accept\nmore or less arbitrarily. The dissolution of all categories implies\nthat the criteria on which all philosophical systems and theories of\nthe world rest are in need of further evidence, which itself is not\npossible without adopting some of these categories or some other\ncategories which again call for further evidence, but which categories\nand methods we chose is ultimately our arbitrary decision. To engage\nin what Brahmanic philosophers would call a ‘genuine\ndebate’ (vāda) one would necessarily have to accept that\nsuch an arbitrary decision is ultimate and justified, thus giving up\nthe further search for truth, even though the process would be\ninfinite and doomed to terminate untimely. In other words,\ncontradictions and inconsistencies are, in fact, inherently systemic\nin the sense that they are generated by a body of propositions each\nadopted arbitrary for this or other reason, and the systemic knowledge\nultimately lacks reliable and coherent foundations. Just as with\nPyrrhonism in Sextus’ interpretation, Jayarāśi seems to be a\nperpetual investigator: he discards all theories and propositions that\nare neither consistent nor proof-tight, for which there is also no\ncompelling evidence. But it would probably be far-fetched to claim\nthat the idea of truth did not represent any value for him. \nJayarāśi may be arguably claimed to represent what has been\nonce labelled epistemological scepticism, or ontological scepticism\n(Hankinson 1995, 13ff), i.e., the position in which one refuses to\naccept the truth of some proposition or to affirm the existence of\nsomething, without denying it, as distinguished from negative\n(ontological) dogmatism, i.e., the attitude in which one actually\nrejects the truth of some proposition and denies the existence of the\nalleged objects. Further, Jayaraśi’s qualified methodological\nscepticism should not be confused with what is covered by the term\ne.g. in the case of Descartes’ approach to seek ultimately firm\nfoundations after all beliefs liable to doubt have been successfully\neliminated. Jayarāśi seeks neither ultimate foundations for\nhis system or firm basis for his epistemology, ontology or ethics,\nbecause he never, even vaguely, intimates he would have any. He is\nsatisfied with demonstrating that all we, the philosophers, have so\nfar established, does not hold. But contrary to Descartes’\nmethodological scepticism, Jayarāśi does not really cast\ndoubt on what comes to us from the senses. \nAt the outset of his work (TUS 1), he points out the major deficiency\nof our knowledge: ‘To establish cognitive criteria\n(pramāṇa, instruments of knowledge) depends on proper\ndefinitions. Further, to establish objects of cognitive criteria\ndepends on cognitive criteria. When proper definitions are absent, how\nis it possible that one would treat both the cognitive criteria and\ntheir objects as genuinely real?’ To adopt certain definitions\nwe first have to adopt certain definitions and criteria of validity.\nThat has to be done vis-à-vis the external reality and tested\nfor validity with respect to phenomena that have all the appearance of\nreal, for Indian philosophers en bloc accepted the correspondence\ntheory of truth. To test the definitions, criteria of validity and\ncognitive criteria with respect to real objects, we should first know\nwhat these real objects really are. To know that we have to have\nreliable instruments of knowledge (cognitive criteria) and criteria of\nvalidity at our disposal. We land in vicious circle: we can neither\nknow cognizable real objects nor determine what genuine cognitive\ncriteria are, nor be actually able to define them without having the\nidea of validity first. Without it we cannot even properly distinguish\nbetween valid cognitive procedures and invalid ones. \nSince it is vital to have a proper definition of a cognitive\ncriterion, or a valid cognitive procedure and criterion of truth for\nphilosophical enterprise, Jayarāśi analyses such definitions\nwhich were formulated within most important philosophical schools in\nIndia. The cognitive criteria whose various definitions are one by one\nexamined are perception (pratyakṣa), inference (anumāna),\npresumption (arthāpatti), reasoning based on analogy\n(upamāna), negative proof based on absence (abhāva),\nequivalence (sambhāva), tradition (aitihya), and verbal or\nscriptural testimony (śabda, āgama). In terms of\nargumentative structure and nature, they all can be reduced to three:\nperception, inference and testimony. The philosophical schools which\nJayarāśi most frequently refers to and criticises their\ndefinitions of the cognitive criteria are the Nyāya,\nVaiśeṣika, Sāṁkhya, Mīmāṁsā\nas well as Buddhist and Jaina schools. \nHe demonstrates that no one so far has offered an irrefutable\ndefinition of perception (which does not have to mean that perception\nas such has to be completely unreliable). All definitions of\nperception are seriously flawed and we cannot rely on it in the way it\nis defined: we do not have even a reliable method or a dependable\ncriterion to distinguish a genuine perception from a mirage, optical\nillusion or a mental image (e.g. in hallucination, reminiscence or\ndream). However, Iit is not the case that Jayarāśi argues\nthat ‘there is simply no way … to know that our\nsense-perceptions are true’ (King 1999: 19). What he is up to is\nto demonstrate that, given our present definitions of perception and\ncategories on which our epistemology rests, there is no way to\ndetermine which of our sense-perceptions are true. \nWhat is considered inference (anumāna) relies on data provided by\nperception which makes inference doubtful. But inference the way it\nhas so far been defined is flawed for a number of other reasons. There\nis no reliable way to relate properties or facts in a truth-conducive\nway. For instance, to infer the cause from the effect one would have\nto first define what causality is, which as Jayarāśi\ndemonstrates cannot be done with the categories we have at our\ndisposal: there is actually no reliable way to relate A and B as cause\nand effect. Further, what do we relate in inference: universals with\nuniversals, universals with a particular, or a particular with a\nparticular? Since universals do not exist, inferences which are based\non such notions are intrinsically flawed. We are left with the idea\nthat inferences depend on particular-to-particular relation. That\nbeing the case, there is no method to establish any kind of valid\nrelationship of universal  character between two particulars\nwhich could allow us to draw any sound inferences from\nsingle-instantiated cases. Further, inferences will have to rely on\ncases of inductive reasoning which are logically not valid and cannot\nbe demonstrated to be universally valid. Also testimony of an\nauthority cannot be a legitimate source of knowledge because, first,\nsuch testimony would have to rely on other cognitive criteria and,\nsecond, we would have no means to determine what a reliable testimony\nis or who an authoritative person can be. Therefore, given all\navailable definitions and criteria admitted by the tradition,\nnothing can be known for certain (Balcerowicz (2019:\n918–­924)). \nJayarāśi’s undertaking is not restricted to the examination\nof valid cognitive procedures, or cognitive criteria\n(pramāṇa) and their definitions. In the course of his work,\nhe analyses a number of fundamental ideas and demonstrates that their\ndefinitions are inadequate and they cannot exist as understood and\ndefined by philosophers. These include such notions as validity and\nnonerroneousness, sublation of previous knowledge by a subsequent\nexperience, universals, the relation of composite wholes to their\nparts, production of cognitions, ontological categories such as\ninherence of properties in their substrata, the nature of illusion,\nthe definition of what exists (e.g. the real object’s ability to\nexecute causally efficient action, artha-kriyā), the nature of\nsense-object contact, memory and recollection, momentariness and\npermanence, conceptuality or conceptual state of mind, relation of the\nconceptual image in cognition to the external thing represented, the\nnature of consciousness (rejection of non-material character), rebirth\nand karmic retribution, causality, visible and invisible objects,\nabsences, rules of inference etc. All these ideas, as\nJayarāśi demonstrates, stand in need of proper definition\nand as long as we do not have them cannot be maintained in their\npresent form. \nImportantly, as a recent publication demonstrates, he strictly applies\nfundamental principles of logic, including a range of standard,\nclassical laws of logic, such as: the law of non-contradiction, the\nlaw of excluded middle,  the law of identity,  De\nMorgan’s laws,  Leibniz’s law (the indiscernibility\nof identicals), and other basic axioms of logic, including patterns of\na priori reasoning whose validity is solely determined by their\nlogical form and structure, and not necessarily by their empirical\nrelevance or validation through empirical observation. At least on one\noccasion he also makes use of the fourfold division of logically\npossible alternatives of p, i.e. the tetralemma\n(catuṣ-koṭi) in an argument directed against the Buddhists\n(who themselves accept the tetralemma as a standard procedure):\np, ~p, p∧~p, ~(p∧~p)\n(Balcerowicz (2019: 924–931). He also takes the conclusions\nderived from premisses through such reasoning based on logic\nprinciples and range of rules (formulated as laws of logic) as valid.\nErgo, he accepts inference – but not anumāna –\nas legitimate means of arriving at truth, and these consistently\nremain beyond his criticism. This analysis sheds important light on\nthe nature of his criticism of what was traditionally accepted in\nclassical India as ‘inference’ (anumāna), which is\ndeficient for two main reasons: its definitions formulated by\nphilosophers are faulty, and its validity is rooted in empirical\nconditions. Indian anumāna is just a sub-theory of logic and\nshould be understood as inference in a qualified sense and of a\nnarrower scope, applied to empirically relevant claims, based on\nempirically observed regularities and advancing arguments involving\nthe problem of induction; anumāna completely excludes deduction\nand all varieties of a priori reasoning and analytic judgements. What\nis termed anumāna should therefore be called ‘disputational\ninference’ or ‘debational inference’, in view of its\norigins in the context of debate. We can observe that\nJayarāśi’s case does not present that of a genuine\nsceptic who would put to doubt the possibility of arriving at truth\nper se and would point to fundamental impossibility to know facts. His\napproach is not scepticism, which questions the epistemic principles\nhe himself also employs. Instead, with the logical apparatus that\nrests in one domain the validity of which he takes for granted,\nJayarāśi finds fault with another, quite different domain:\nthat of the principles of traditional Indian epistemological and\nlogical model, rooted in reasonings which are based on empirical\nobservation and are not a priori (Balcerowicz (2019:\n931–943). \nJayarāśi, as we noted, is cautious not to affirmatively\nstate anything, and nowhere does he use such expressions as\n‘thus it was established that’ (iti sthitam) or similar\nexpressions typical of all other philosophical works. Despite this,\ncan we reconstruct any positive views he affirms or is his scepticism\nall-embracing? It seems there a few such views. His clear rejection of\nkarmic retribution, afterlife and the supernatural (‘human\nactions do no bring otherworldly results, such as rebirth in heaven\netc.’) and the claim the ultimate reality for us is what we\nexperience and what surrounds us concerns both metaphysics and ethics.\nMetaphysically, there is no supernatural reality of any relevance to\nus. Ethically, the only criterion to determine what is right and wrong\nis what people agree to accept as such (‘the worldly path should\nbe followed’). Quite frequently, he uses examples of\nnon-existent entities such as demons (piśāca), atoms\n(paramâṇu) and god (mahêśvara), taking their\nfictitious character for granted, which indicates that he apparently\nrejected invisible reality which is intrinsically beyond our\nsenses. \nA recent publication enumerates altogether more than a dozen such\npositive views that can be possibly reconstructed and ascribed to\nJayarāśi (Balcerowicz (2020: 599–600)). On one\noccasion (in the Buddhist section, TUP, p.57–88 = Franco (1987:\n269–271) = Solomon (2010: 120) = Jha (2013: 228–229)),\nwhile refuting the view that ‘the first moment of consciousness\n[of the newly born], immediately after the exit from the mother’s\nwomb, is preceded by another moment of consciousness’, he\nconcludes that ‘the first moment of consciousness in the womb\netc. [i.e., of the newly born], must come from the combination of the\nelements’, which is a typically materialist view. He further\ntakes consciousness to be a product of matter; rejects the existence\nof the soul or any kind of conscious entity that might exist\nindependently of the material body, and all that is supernatural and\nimperceptible, such as demons (piśaca), atoms\n(paramâṇu) or god (mahêśvara); dismisses\nafterlife, transmigration, karmic retribution (karman), virtue\n(puṇya) or vice (pāpa); denies heavens, hells, liberation,\nomniscient beings and omniscience; rejects ritualism and and the\npurposefulness of religious cult, religious revelation, religious\nauthority (āpta), the concept of righteousness (dharma);\ndismisses the validity of the pramāṇa model of\nepistemology, but accepts the validity of direct experience\n(anubhava). \nHe plainly states that ‘universals do not exist’ (TUP, 4.5\nff.), which does not seem to be a mere thesis which he rejects just\nfor the sake of argument, because throughout his work he will refer to\nthis claim (‘we have already shown that universals do not\nexist’). He is a nominalist in accepting only particulars which\nfor him are external, macroscopic, non-momentary and material objects.\nOn another occasion (TUS 24) he criticises the view that composite\nmacroscopic wholes cannot exist, and what exists instead are their\nparts only (a typical Buddhist nominalist position). He concludes\nthere is no way to demonstrate that composite wholes are non-existent.\nInterestingly, he nowhere links the idea of composite wholes (and the\nparadox of the whole and its parts), which he seems to accept, to idea\nthe universal (and the paradox of the universal and the particulars as\nits instantiations), which he clearly rejects. These two concepts, the\nwholes and universals, were generally analysed in India jointly as two\naspects of the same problem: just as the whole exists (or does not\nexist) through its parts, in the very same way also the universal\nexists (or does not exist) through its particulars. Interestingly,\nJayarāśi never links these two issues, precisely because, it\nseems, he admitted the existence of macroscopic objects of our\nexperience (i.e., composite wholes) whereas he rejected the existence\nof universals. Being a sceptic, he does seem to accept a\n‘commonsensical view’ of the world that consists of such\nmacroscopic objects, but not of invisible atoms or universals, demons\nand god. In line with this approach, he seemed also to maintain that\nconsciousness is a product or combination of the four elements (see\nabove). It should not come as a surprise to discover that all these\nviews he shared with genuine materialists of the Cārvāka /\nLokāyata tradition. \nWhat may appear as a truly sceptical thesis is his assumption that all\nphilosophical claims are always made within a particular set of\nbeliefs, i.e., within a particular system which is based on\narbitrarily accepted criteria, definitions and categories. His\npragmatic, ‘commonsensical attitude’ is highlighted in a\nverse he quotes: ‘with respect to everyday practice of the\nworld, the fool and the wise are similar’ (see above), because\nultimately we all have to rely on our experience and defective and\npartial knowledge of reality. \nThe conclusion of his work: ‘Thus, when all categories are\ncompletely dissolved in the above manner, all practical actions (which\nentails thought, speech and activity) can be enjoyable, without being\nreflected upon’, is quite meaningful. On the one hand it could\nbe taken to imply some kind of a carpe diem attitude: given our\nlimitations and intrinsic inability to know with certainty, the only\noption we are left with is to enjoy the world the way it appears to\nus. On the other hand, the statement could also suggest that what\nJayarāśi had in mind was that for all our practical\nactivities, including thinking, verbal communication, behaviour or\nordinary life, the world of our actions — as long as it is\nrelevant to us — is ‘here and now’ and retains its\nultimate validity, even though we are incapable of its proper\nphilosophical analysis.","contact.mail":"piotrbalcerowicz1@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
