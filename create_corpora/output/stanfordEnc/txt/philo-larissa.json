Under his leadership, the\nAcademics abandoned the radical skepticism of Arcesilaus and Carneades\n(who professed to live without rationally warranted beliefs) in favor\nof a form of mitigated skepticism allowing for provisional beliefs\nthat did not claim certainty. But Philo himself seems to have gone a\nstep further in his controversial “Roman Books”, where he\nrejected the Stoic definition of knowledge on which the\nAcademics’ mitigated skepticism relied. The evidence suggests\nthat he proposed instead a weaker, fallibilist theory that allowed for\nordinary knowledge but did not support the theoretical dogmatism of\nthe Academics’ philosophical rivals. By challenging the accepted\nepistemological framework of the Hellenistic period, Philo thus\ninadvertently helped to set the stage for the subsequent revival of\nPlatonism as a dogmatic tradition based on the interpretation of\nPlatonic doctrines. He is most widely known, however, as the teacher\nof Cicero, through whose work Academic skepticism became known in the\nLatin-reading world.\n\nThe external facts of Philo’s career are largely undisputed. He\nwas born in 159/8 BCE (but see Fleischer 2017b). After eight years of\nstudy with Callicles, a student of Carneades, in his native Larissa,\nPhilo moved to Athens in 134/3 BCE, where he spent fourteen years with\nClitomachus, another of Carneades’ students, who was the\nscholarch (or head) of the Academy from 129/8 (or perhaps 127/6) to\nhis death in 110/9 BCE. Philo was elected to replace Clitomachus in\nthat year, and remained the scholarch until his death in 84/3 BCE. \nPhilo’s tenure as head of the Academy was troubled by two\nevents. First, in the late 90s BCE his authority was challenged by the\nsecession of his student Antiochus of Ascalon, who set up a rival\nanti-skeptic “Old Academy”. (A second student,\nAenesidemus, also left the Academy to found or revive the radically\nskeptical Pyrrhonist school, probably in the 90s BCE; but the dating\nof this secession to Philo’s tenure as scholarch is insecure.)\nSecondly, civil unrest in Athens and the threat of the Mithridatic war\nled to an exodus of Academic philosophers to safer cities. Philo\nhimself moved to Rome in 89/8 BCE, where he continued to give lectures\nand published his “Roman Books”. It is unclear whether he\never returned to Athens after its “pacification” by the\nRomans in 86 BCE. The name of his successor as scholarch, who probably\noversaw the final demise of the Academy as an institution, is also\nunclear. (The section of Philodemus’ Catalogue of Academic\nPhilosophers—our main source for his\nbiography—dealing with Philo’s death, his students, and\nhis successor, is at several points illegible; see Fleischer 2017c.)\nNone of Philo’s written works survive, but we possess a summary\nof a work on ethics, some direct evidence for his Roman Books and\nearlier epistemological views, and indirect evidence for a work on\nrhetoric. \nSince the evidence for Philo’s various epistemological views is\nphilosophically rich but radically incomplete, their interpretation is\nunsurprisingly controversial. The primary sources agree that\nPhilo’s views evolved between his election as scholarch in 110/9\nBCE and the publication of the Roman Books in 88 BCE; but the precise\nstages of his epistemological evolution and the arguments that led\nPhilo to change his mind are not explicitly described in the texts we\nhave. \nOur evidence indicates (and no scholar disputes this) that Philo began\nas an adherent of the radical skepticism attributed to Carneades by\nClitomachus. The two central questions that the evidence appears to\nleave open are: \nIn order to understand these questions it is important to know\nsomething about the context in which Philo’s views evolved.\nSeveral sources make it clear that when Philo arrived in Athens in the\n130s BCE, the Academy was sharply divided over the legacy of\nCarneades. One side, led by Clitomachus, advocated radical skepticism\nas the authentic Carneadean position, while another, led by Metrodorus\nof Stratonicea, promoted some form of mitigated skepticism. We know,\nhowever, that Philo was elected scholarch in 110/9 BCE as a\nrepresentative of the Clitomachian, i.e., radically skeptical, wing of\nthe Academy (see Numenius fragment 28). We also know that the\nepistemological views in his Roman Books in 88 BCE were regarded as\nshocking innovations by Academics of all kinds (see Cicero\nAcademica [Ac.] 2.18). \nWith respect to the first question, this suggests that, if Philo\nabandoned radical skepticism prior to the Roman Books, then he adopted\nthe form of mitigated skepticism earlier attributed to Carneades by\nMetrodorus. Otherwise he held the same view from the 130s BCE until\nleaving Athens in 89/8 BCE. \nOn the second question, about the epistemological position of the\nRoman Books, the limited textual evidence has elicited from\ninterpreters three answers: some form of mitigated skepticism,\nfallibilism, or Platonism. The first answer implies that Philo’s\nview developed once, from radical to mitigated skepticism, whether\nprior to (Sedley 1981; Vezzoli 2011; Tarrant 2018) or in the Roman\nBooks (Glucker 1978; Lévy 1992, 2010). According to the second\nanswer, the Roman Books adopted a form of fallibilism. Philo’s\ninnovation in the Roman Books may then be understood either as his\nfirst departure from radical skepticism (Hankinson 1995; Thorsrud\n2009) or as a second change of view, now from mitigated skepticism (M.\nFrede 1987; Barnes 1989; Striker 1997; Brittain 2001). The third\nanswer, that the Roman Books advocated a form of Platonism, may\nsimilarly presume Philo’s views developed either once, from\nradical skepticism directly to Platonism (Glidden 1996), or twice,\nfirst from radical skepticism to mitigated skepticism and then to\nPlatonism (Tarrant 1985). \nGiven these two questions and the interpretive constraints on their\nanswers, we arrive at a schema of five accounts of Philo’s\nepistemological development: \nThe resolution of these questions depends primarily on an\ninterpretation of Cicero’s Academica, our principal,\nand only first-hand, philosophical source for Academic skepticism. But\nthis text strongly suggests Philo held three epistemological positions\nover his career, since Cicero identifies and distinguishes three\npositions held by different Academics in Philo’s lifetime: a\nradical skepticism associated with Clitomachus (e.g., in Ac.\n2.78, 2.108); a form of mitigated skepticism held by a group of\nAcademics who regarded it as incompatible with the Roman Books\n(Ac. 2.148, 2.11–12 & 2.18); and the Roman\nBook view (Ac. 2.18). So it is clear that the Roman\nBooks did represent a third distinct Academic position. It also seems\nclear that they represented Philo’s third\nepistemological view, because the interpretation of Carneades that\ngenerated the second view is explicitly tied to Philo and Metrodorus\n(Ac. 2.78, cf. 2.148), while we know that the Roman Books\noffered a novel interpretation of Arcesilaus and Carneades that was\ncontested by the proponents of the second view (Ac.\n2.11–12, 2.18). We can thus safely infer, in response to the\nfirst question above, that Philo advocated mitigated skepticism at\nsome point in the 90s BCE, prior to the Roman Books of 88 BCE and\nafter his election to the scholarchate as a Clitomachian radical\nskeptic in 110/9 BCE. That this is correct is confirmed by the\ncriticisms of mitigated skepticism aimed at Philo by his student\nAntiochus before the Roman Books (see\n section 3.4\n below), and by the fact that virtually all the generic references to\nAcademic skepticism in later writers assume that it was a form of\nmitigated skepticism (see, e.g., Gellius Attic Nights 11.5.8,\nPhotius Library 212.170a, Plutarch Stoic\nContradictions ch. 10, and Sextus Outlines of Skepticism\n[PH] 1.226–31). Since Metrodorus was regarded as\nunorthodox, the only plausible candidate for the creation of this\nreceived view of Academic skepticism is a work by Philo from the 90s\nBCE. \nThe second question above is much simpler to dispose of once the first\nhas been resolved. If Philo had previously been a mitigated skeptic\nand the Roman Books presented an epistemological innovation, his final\nposition was not mitigated skepticism. But we have excellent evidence\nthat it wasn’t a (recognizable) form of Platonism, since\nAntiochus and Numenius flatly rejected it, despite being avowed\nrevivers of Platonism. (The only evidence in favor of the Platonist\nhypothesis is an explicitly unsupported fantasy in Augustine, to the\neffect that Platonist doctrines were secretly taught in the Academy\nthroughout its skeptical phase [Against the Academics\n3.37–43].) The fallibilist interpretation of the Roman Books is\nthus at least prima facie the most plausible candidate\noffered to date. Whether it is in fact a satisfying candidate will\ndepend on its ability to present a coherent philosophical\ninterpretation of the development of Philo’s epistemological\nviews from the evidence we have. \nThe following sections thus offer an interpretation of Philo’s\nphilosophical development on the hypothesis that he held three\ndistinct epistemological views, as proposed by the Radical Skepticism\n→ Mitigated Skepticism → Fallibilism account above. It is\nworth stressing, however, that, given the uncertainties of our\nevidence, the exegetical and historical arguments above cannot be\nregarded as conclusive. The case is not closed (see, e.g., Glucker\n2004 and Tarrant 2018). \nPhilo’s distinct epistemological views share one fundamental\nfeature: all of them deny the possibility of knowledge according to\nthe dominant Stoic conception of it. The essential context for\nunderstanding Philo is thus the critique of Stoic epistemology offered\nby Academic philosophers, and especially by Arcesilaus and Carneades,\nover the preceding hundred and fifty years (c. 280–130 BCE). \nThe Stoics’ epistemology was designed to accommodate their\nbelief that it must be possible, in principle, to achieve the sort of\ninerrant wisdom Socrates had desired. The Stoic theory depends on\nthree innovations (see, e.g., Cicero Ac. 1.40–2.). (1)\nThey defined the formation of a belief as a matter of assenting to an\noccurrent thought or impression that something is, or is not, the\ncase. (2) They isolated a certain kind of perceptual (and perhaps also\nnon-perceptual) impression as “cognitive”\n(cataleptic), because it was self-warranting, such that\nassenting to these impressions constituted a “cognition”\n(catalepsis—lit. a “grasp”) of the state of\naffairs they represented. And (3) they took secure knowledge of the\nsort Socrates sought to be the state of an agent whose beliefs are\nconstituted entirely by perceptual and non-perceptual cognitions. As a\nresult, given their ethical doctrine that secure knowledge was\nnecessary and sufficient for happiness, and since, according to (3),\nsuch knowledge could be achieved by restricting one’s assent to\ncognitive impressions, the Stoics identified the avoidance of opinion\nand error—i.e., assent to non-cognitive impressions, whether\ninadequately warranted (opinion) or false (error)—as the\noverriding principle of rationality. \nThe Academics attacked every part of this Stoic theory—their\npractice was to argue against all philosophical positions—but\ntheir criticism focused, unsurprisingly, on the central notion of the\ncognitive impression. The Stoics standardly defined a cognitive\nimpression as one that came from what is, was stamped and impressed\nexactly in accordance with it, and was, accordingly, such that it\ncouldn’t be false (see, e.g., Sextus Adversus\nMathematicos [ M] 7.248 or Cicero\nAc. 2.77). They took this to mean, roughly, that an\nimpression is cognitive if and only if \nThe general Academic tactic against this view was to concede the\npossibility that an impression might meet conditions [a] and [b], but\nargue that condition [c] never obtained. They appealed to our\nexperience of twins etc. and in abnormal states such as dreams,\nillusions and episodes of madness to show that it was always possible\nto have a false impression with exactly the same richness and detail\nof representation as a true one; it follows that meeting condition [b]\ncould never suffice to show that condition [c] obtains, with the\nresult that the warrant claimed in [c] is never available to us. (See,\ne.g., Sextus M 7.402–10 & Cicero Ac.\n2.84–90). \nThe Academics used these arguments to point out that if our\nimpressions are never self-warranting in the way cognitive impressions\nare supposed to be, and if the Stoic definition of the cognitive\nimpression is correct, there is no cognition. Hence, if all knowledge\ndepends on cognitions, as the Stoics claim, nothing at all can be\nknown. The Academics also offered a corollary to this argument,\ndrawing on the Stoic principle of rationality mentioned above: \nThus, according to the Stoic theory, once it is shown that there are\nno cognitive impressions as they define them, if there are any wise\npeople, they will have no beliefs; and, whether there are any wise\npeople or not, it is never rational to assent to any impression. (See,\ne.g., Sextus M 7.150–7 & Cicero Ac.\n2.66–8 & 2.77–8). \nThe Stoics, of course, came up with plenty of sophisticated\ncounter-arguments to the criticisms of the cognitive impression, to\nwhich the Academics devised equally subtle responses. But one argument\nin particular seems to have seriously troubled the Academic students\nof Carneades: the Stoic “inactivity” objection. This was a\nvery simple practical reductio, connected to the corollary\nargument given above: if the Academics were right it would be\nimpossible to act at all (let alone well), since voluntary action\ndepends on beliefs and thus on assent (see, e.g., Cicero Ac.\n2.24–5 and 2.34–7). But since action (indeed, good action)\nis possible, the Academics must be mistaken. The later Academics saw\nthree ways in which they could respond to this counter-argument\nwithout giving up their arguments against cognitive impressions. They\ncould: \nThese three options turn out to define the three Academic positions\nPhilo held: position [1] was the core of Clitomachus’ defense of\nradical skepticism; position [2] was the basis of Philo’s\ndefense of mitigated skepticism; and position [3] was the one Philo\ndefended in the Roman Books. \nThe dialectic of Academic and Stoic argument and counter-argument\noutlined above may give the impression that Carneades, and the earlier\nAcademic skeptics more generally, were committed to the conclusions\nthat they argued for, i.e., that there are no cognitive impressions,\nthat nothing can be known, that the wise person will suspend assent\nuniversally, etc. But there are several reasons to doubt that\nCarneades straightforwardly believed on the basis of these arguments\nthat nothing can be known and that it is irrational to assent to any\nimpression (see M. Frede 1987). First, such a position is obviously\ninconsistent: since beliefs are assents on the Stoic view (and\nCarneades’ arguments rely on Stoic assumptions), the two\nconclusions cannot be consistently held at one time by a rational\nagent. Secondly, the arguments only work if one already accepts a\nbasically Stoic epistemological framework, i.e., their theory of\nimpressions, their empiricism, their conception of knowledge, their\npsychological doctrine etc. But Carneades had no reason to accept any\nof these highly contestable views rather than, e.g., the Platonic or\nEpicurean alternatives. And, thirdly, we know that the Academic method\nof argument was dialectical: Carneades made it his practice to argue\nfor and against any and all philosophical views. And, in this\nparticular case, there is good reason to think that his arguments were\ndesigned to show the inadequacies of the Stoic view and their\napparently skeptical consequences for the Stoics themselves. This is\nmore or less directly attested in some sources (Numenius fr. 27,\nSextus M 7.159–64, cf. 7.150), as well as evident\nfrom the fact that Carneades was happy to try several incompatible\nresponses to the Stoic reductio argument—viz. options\n[1] and [2] above—both of which can easily be read as further\ncriticisms of Stoic epistemological views (see Striker 1980 [1996] and\nAllen 1994). \nSo Carneades was not committed to the views that nothing can be known\nand that it is always irrational to assent on the basis of\nthese anti-Stoic arguments: the latter do not give him reasons to\nbelieve their conclusions. Nevertheless, it seems likely that he\nwas committed to them in some sense, since the Stoics and other\nphilosophers kept on arguing against these views as if they were his,\nor the Academic, position, and some of his students clearly agreed.\n(Carneades’ actual position remains controversial; see Bett 1989\nand Allen 2004 [2020].) Clitomachus, at any rate, advocated an\ninterpretation of Carneades’ skepticism that saw his method of\nargument on either side of all philosophical questions as motivated by\nsome sort of commitment to the view that it is irrational to assent to\nanything less than what one knows to be true, and as resulting in a\nsimilar kind of commitment to the view that nothing can be known. And\nit was this interpretation of Carneades that Philo held at the start\nof his Academic career (Numenius fr. 28). \nClitomachus defended the consistency of a radical skepticism of this\nsort by denying that assent is necessary for action or belief, as the\nStoics had claimed in their inactivity objection to the Academic\ncorollary argument\n (section 3.1\n above). His defense came in two stages, both appealing to arguments\nCarneades had used in response to the Stoic objection. The first stage\nidentified a way to discriminate between our thoughts without\nappealing to their objective status as true or as\n“cognitive” impressions (see Cicero Ac.\n2.98–99, cf. 2.32). Here Clitomachus drew on Carneades’\n“theory of probable [or, better, ‘persuasive’\n(pithanon)] impressions”—i.e., the description of\nordinary epistemic procedures that Carneades promoted as an\nalternative to the Stoic theory of cognitive impressions (see Sextus\nM 7. 166–89 and Allen 1994). In ordinary life,\nCarneades argued, we proceed without assuming that a set of what the\nStoics call impressions is “cognitive” or immediately\nwarranted to be true. Rather, some “impressions” leave us\nwith no immediate inclination to accept them, while some strike us as\nsubjectively “persuasive”, at least initially, owing to\ntheir internal characteristics (e.g., the richness of their\nrepresentation). We can increase or diminish the initial\npersuasiveness of our impressions by considering the perceptual\nconditions under which we experience them (e.g., normal perceptual\nconditions for perceiving the state of affairs they represent), and\ntheir fit with our other impressions (e.g., normal coherence\nconditions). And we accept and act on impressions when they reach the\nlevel of persuasiveness we find appropriate to the situation we are\nin. But, Clitomachus insisted, none of these procedures is sufficient\nto establish that an impression is true or “cognitive”,\nsince, as the Academics have argued, the representational features of\nany true impression can always be replicated by a false one. (See\nCicero Ac. 2.98–99.) And there is no reason to think\nthat in ordinary life we assume that the procedures are sufficient\n(see Plutarch Common Conceptions ch. 36). \nThis first stage gives the Academic a procedure that allows for\ndiscrimination between impressions while preserving the Academic\nthesis that nothing can be known. The second stage of\nClitomachus’ defense drew on Carneades’ criticisms of the\nStoic unitary notion of assent as simply a matter of taking an\nimpression (or its content) to be true. Carneades had argued that this\nfails to account for the complexity of our cognitive life: many of our\nactions are not the product of distinct acts of assent, but are rather\nunconscious, or habitual, like animal action; and we sometimes\ndeliberately act without assent, for instance, when we follow\nunendorsed hypotheses or act in conditions of uncertainty (see Bett\n1990). On the basis of considerations of this sort, Clitomachus argued\nthat we should distinguish “assenting” to an impression,\nin the Stoic sense of taking it to be true, from\n“approving” an impression, in the sense of acting on it or\naccepting it as if it were true. (See Cicero Ac.\n2.104.) \nThis second stage gives the Academics a way of accepting impressions\nand acting on them that preserves the thesis that rationality demands\nthat one should always suspend assent. Thus, by combining both stages,\nClitomachus was able to argue that the Academic is free to\n“follow” or “approve” persuasive impressions\nwithout assenting to them: the Academic has a “practical\ncriterion” that allows for action without presupposing the\ncognitive access to objective truth required for rational assent\n(Sextus M 7. 166; cf. Cicero Ac. 2.108).\nClitomachus, however, did not restrict the application of this\n“practical” criterion to cases of ordinary action\n(pace Görler 1994). He also explicitly claimed that it\ngave the radical skeptics a means to explain their philosophical\nactivities, i.e., their arguments and views (Cicero Ac.\n2.104; cf. 2.32). He was thus in a position to explain the\nAcademics’ apparent commitment to the theses that assent is\nirrational and knowledge is unattainable. These are views that the\nradical skeptic finds “persuasive”; but they are not\n“beliefs”, at least not in the Stoic sense, because the\nAcademic does not take them to be true. \nOne might plausibly question whether Carneades’ resistance to\n(straightforward Stoic) assent was the “heroic” defense of\nrationality against opinion and error Clitomachus took it to be\n(Cicero Ac. 2.108). It remains very controversial whether\nthere is a coherent distinction to be made between approving a view\nand assenting to its truth (see the wider discussion in Burnyeat &\nFrede [ed.] 1998). But a case can be made that acts of pretense,\nimagination, and supposition require taking on views in a manner\ndistinct from that of belief and that the rational activities of the\nradical skeptic are founded on supposition (see Striker 1980 [1996];\nBett 1990; Reinhardt 2018). Another way to support the distinction is\nto note that the process of arguing for and against a thesis, in the\nway Carneades did, can leave one stuck with a view one way or the\nother, but without being aware of any rational ground for preferring\nthis view. After constant repetition of this process, one can see how\nthe Academics might have come to have the view that their views or\n“beliefs” are all non-rational in the specific sense that\nthey were not actively formed in accordance with the explicit criteria\nof rationality advocated by the dogmatic philosophers. And if they\nremained committed—in the same attenuated or\n“non-rational” sense—to the Socratic ideal of\ninerrant knowledge, one can see why they might try to preserve their\nrationality by not giving their assent to the views they found\nthemselves holding. A case along these lines is made in Brittain 2005\n[2008]. Philo, at any rate, initially agreed with Clitomachus that\nCarneades’ ability to maintain something like these critical\nstances towards all beliefs—his own as well as the theories of\nhis philosophical opponents—represented a paradigm of\nself-conscious rationality (see Numenius fr. 28). \nClitomachus’ interpretation of Carneades’ skepticism was\nthe dominant view in the Academy in the period c. 130–100 BCE.\nBut it was always contested, initially by Metrodorus, and later by\nPhilo himself. The basis for the alternative interpretation was a\nsecond response Carneades had given to the Stoic inactivity objection\n(position [2] in\n section 3.1\n above), arguing that it is sometimes rational to assent to\nnon-cognitive impressions (see Cicero Ac. 2.78, cf. 2.53).\nClitomachus had taken this as just an ad hominem argument,\ndesigned to challenge the Stoic defense of the view that the\noverriding principle of rationality is avoidance of any possibility of\nerror (see Cicero Ac. 2.67–8). Metrodorus and his\nfollowers, however, thought that this was a statement of\nCarneades’ own view, and adopted it themselves. \nThere is no direct evidence to explain Philo’s shift from\nradical to mitigated skepticism. But we can learn something about the\ngeneral motivations he may have had for adopting his new position from\nthe ways in which some mitigated skeptics understood the Carneadean\nnotion of “persuasive impressions”. In the case of\nperceptual impressions, the difference between their view and the\nClitomachian position is clarified by a criticism from Philo’s\nformer student Antiochus that some Academics took persuasive\nimpressions to be a criterion of truth, rather than just of\naction and philosophical criticism (see Sextus\nM 7.435–8 and Cicero Ac. 2.32–6).\nThis shows that these Academics understood the mechanisms Carneades\nhad outlined for increasing the persuasiveness of impressions to\nprovide a means of confirming or disconfirming—in various\ndegrees, though never ones that warranted them\nconclusively—whether they were likely to be true or not. These\nmitigated skeptics thus believed that the persuasiveness of perceptual\nimpressions under the right perceptual and coherence conditions as\ndefeasible, but rational, evidence for their truth. We find a\nsimilar move in the case of non-perceptual impressions: some mitigated\nskeptics formed tentative beliefs as to which positions are more\nlikely to be true (see, e.g., Cicero Ac. 2.148), after using\nthe standard Academic practice of arguing on either side of\nphilosophical questions as a means of rationally evaluating arguments\n(see Cicero Ac. 2.7, 2.60 & On the Nature of the\nGods 1.11, Galen On the Best Method of Teaching ch. 1,\nand Plutarch Stoic Contradictions ch. 10). These mitigated\nskeptics thus changed the status of argument on either side from a\ncritical practice ending in suspension of assent into a positive\nmethod for rationally confirming and, indirectly, teaching\nphilosophical beliefs. \nIt is not difficult to see how this shift in the understanding of\npersuasive impressions might lead to a re-evaluation of the conception\nof rationality shared by Stoics and, at least in part, by the radical\nskeptics. Clitomachus had agreed with the Stoics that avoiding error\nis a necessary condition for rationality, and consequently, given the\napparent unavailability of knowledge, advocated suspending assent\nuniversally. But once Philo had begun to use persuasiveness as a\nrational method for evaluating impressions, the radically skeptical\nposition started to look more like an abdication of rationality than\nits paradigm. Granted that nothing can be known—a view the\nmitigated skeptics continued to find extremely persuasive (see Cicero\nAc. 2.148)—it still seems that we are rationally\nobliged to form the best beliefs we can, given the evidence available\nto us. And while this will involve the possibility of error, the\nrefusal to use the evidence we have seems absurd when it is\ngeneralized to every case—and immoral in the case of ethics,\nsince without some regulatory beliefs, it is unlikely that our lives\ncould be virtuous or happy (see\n section 4). \nThese reasons, then, or something like them, led Philo, along with\nother mitigated skeptics, to the formal position that, while nothing\ncould be known (as shown by the Academic arguments against the\npossibility of cognitive impressions), it is nevertheless rational to\nassent under certain conditions, i.e., to hold beliefs based on\nreasons (Cicero Ac. 2.78). The mitigated skeptics retained\nthe Stoic characterization of such beliefs as “opinions”\nto mark the fact that, despite the rational grounds they had for\nholding them, they were just rational beliefs—i.e.,\nthey did not amount to “cognitions” or knowledge (Cicero\nAc. 2.148). But they also distinguished rational\nopinions of this sort from the general Stoic category of opinion as\nany assent to a non-cognitive impression (and hence as always bad), by\nqualifying their assent to them as “measured”—that\nis, as provisional on their avowedly inconclusive evidence, rather\nthan as a straightforward commitment to their truth. (See the\nanonymous Introduction to Plato ch. 7 and Gellius Attic\nNights 11.5.8. Sextus mis-ascribes this view to Clitomachus in\nPH 1.226 & 1.229–30.) \nThe significant difference between this position and radical\nskepticism is clear from the principal example of a mitigatedly\nskeptical “opinion” that we have: the thesis that nothing\ncan be known (see, e.g., Cicero Ac. 2.148, Gellius Attic\nNights 11.5.8, Galen On the Best Method for Teaching ch.\n1). The mitigated skeptics evidently believed this thesis on the\nbasis of the Academic arguments considered in\n section 3.1\n above. But this means that, despite their rejection of the existence\nof cognitive impressions and their new principle of rationality, their\nskepticism was heavily parasitic on Stoic epistemology: they accepted\na dogmatic epistemological framework, such that they believed the\nStoic theory of impressions, Stoic empiricism, the Stoic conception of\nknowledge, and so on. One does not need to see this as a weakness to\nnotice that the ties between mitigated skepticism and its dogmatic\nframework render it liable to redundancy, in a way radical skepticism\nis not, if the philosophical conception of knowledge itself\nchanges. \nPhilo’s motivation for his final shift away from skepticism in\nthe Roman Books can be seen, at least in part, from the criticisms\ndirected at him by his ex-student Antiochus before their publication\nin 88/7 BCE. These criticisms point to a kind of instability inherent\nin mitigated skepticism: it seems to waver unhealthily between a\ndogmatic position allowing for something approaching certainty about\nsome questions and a radical skepticism about our ability to make any\nepistemic progress. More specifically, it suggests that we can take\npersuasive impressions as evidence for the truth that is firm enough\nto warrant assent—thus allowing for a life guided by reasoned\nbelief, and even ethical teaching—while simultaneously\nmaintaining that even the most perfect rational consideration of the\nevidence is compatible with wholesale error. (See the argument in\nCicero Ac. 2.111, addressed explicitly to Philo prior to his\nRoman view, and its elaboration in Ac. 2.34–6 &\n2.43–44. These Antiochian criticisms are echoed almost verbatim\nby Aenesidemus in Photius Library 212 170a 14–38.) \nThe outlines of Philo’s response to this problem in the Roman\nBooks are fairly clear from the direct evidence we have for their\nepistemological innovations (Cicero Ac. 2.18 and Sextus\nPH 1.235). He argued, first, that the Stoic definition of the\ncognitive impression ruled out the possibility of anything being\nknown—i.e., he restated the standard Academic arguments to this\neffect—and, secondly, that this definition was therefore\nmisconceived, since at least some things could be known. His\nelucidation of the second claim is unfortunately not explicit in the\nsurviving evidence. But its criticism by Antiochus (the context for\nCicero’s report) very strongly suggests that Philo offered an\nalternative and weaker definition of knowledge of single propositions.\nFor Antiochus both characterizes Philo’s innovations as an\nattempt to redefine “cognition” (Ac. 2.17 &\n2.18 fin.) and attempts to refute them by arguing that an impression\nthat does not meet the condition given in the third clause of the\nStoic definition (see\n section 3.1\n above) cannot be “cognitive”. Philo’s new\ndefinition thus amounted to something like the Stoic definition minus\nits third clause (the clause the Academics had always disputed). If\nso, Philo claimed that an impression is cognitive if it is both [a]\ntrue and [b] caused in the appropriate way for correctly representing\nits object—without adding the disputed Stoic rider [c], that its\ntruth is warranted by the inimitable richness and detail of\nrepresentation guaranteed by its causal history. \nThis bare outline of Philo’s final position is sufficient to\nshow its novelty, and thus explain its poor reception by Antiochus and\nthe Academics alike (see Ac. 2.11–12, 2.18). His new\nconception of knowledge was a radical innovation in three respects.\nFirst, given his acceptance of the standard Academic arguments against\nself-warranting cognitive impressions, it offered a fallibilist\ntheory, which allows for unqualified assent to knowledge claims on the\nbasis of impressions that might nonetheless be false. Antiochus’\ncriticism suggests that he defended this view by pointing out that the\ntheoretical or counterfactual possibility of error was epistemically\nirrelevant in cases where the impression is in fact true and our\npositive evidence for it is, in practice, conclusive (see Barnes\n1989). But however he justified it, Philo’s new conception of\nknowledge challenged the fundamental epistemological principle of the\nHellenistic period that knowledge must be certain. Secondly,\nPhilo’s new theory implied that there is in fact a good deal of\nknowledge. It thus constituted an apparently radical rejection of the\nbasic thesis that all the skeptical Academics had shared, that nothing\ncan be known. And, thirdly, Philo’s theory implied a revised\nprinciple of rationality. The mitigated skeptics had responded to the\nStoic inactivity objection by identifying rationality with forming\ndefeasible beliefs on the basis of the available evidence. But, by\nqualifying the assent of the rational agent as “measured”\nor provisional, they insulated rationality itself from practical\nerror: whether or not the belief is false, an agent who forms it on\nthe appropriate grounds is never mistaken in holding it provisionally.\nOn Philo’s new position, however, rationality is compatible with\noutright error because it is rational to give straightforward,\nunqualified assent to impressions that might nonetheless be false. The\nRoman Books thus marked Philo’s final rejection of the joint\nStoic and Academic thesis that the avoidance of error is an overriding\nprinciple of rationality. \nThis sketch of their implications explains why Philo’s\ninnovations were decisive enough to startle his contemporaries and,\neventually, to lead to the doxographical classification of his version\nof Academicism as a distinct “Fourth Academy” (see, e.g.,\nSextus PH 1.220 & 1.235). But two facts imply that his\nfurther elucidation in the Roman Books included some significant\nlimitations on the range of knowledge Philo came to accept, and hence\nthe sense in which he rejected the skepticism of his Academic\npredecessors. The first is just that his contemporaries (and later\nhistorians) continued to regard him, even at the end of his career, as\nan Academic, i.e., in some way a follower of Arcesilaus and Carneades,\nrather than a defector like Antiochus or Aenesidemus. The second is\nthat Philo asserted “the unity of the Academy” in the\nRoman Books (see Cicero Ac. 1.13), i.e., claimed that his new\nview was in fact the underlying view of all the Academics from\nSocrates and Plato to himself. Exactly what he meant by this claim is\ncontroversial, but the tenuous and complex evidence does not suggest\nthat it involved either accepting an anti-skeptical reading of Plato\nor denying that the skeptical Academics were skeptical about the\npossibility of achieving theoretical knowledge in philosophy (see\nBrittain 2001: chs. 4–5 and Tarrant 2018: 86–87). \nBy combining these external constraints on our understanding of the\nepistemological innovations of the Roman Books with their\nphilosophical context—Philo’s prior position of mitigated\nskepticism and the criticisms it faced—we can see, at least\nroughly, how Philo may have given flesh to the basic outline above.\nTaken together, these considerations suggest three constraints on the\nrange of the knowledge that Philo accepted. They suggest, first, that\nPhilo supplemented the externalist bones of his new definition of\ncognition with the internalist constraints on assent that the\nmitigated skeptics had already identified: assent to a Philonian\ncognitive impression would only be warranted when the representational\n“richness” guaranteed by its causal history (condition [b]\nabove) was confirmed by meeting the additional perceptual and\ncoherence conditions Carneades had identified for persuasive\nimpressions. Secondly, that Philo took Philonian cognition to apply\nprimarily to experiential knowledge, i.e., the kind that we ascribe to\nourselves in virtue of perception and to experts with practical\nskills, or something like “ordinary knowledge”. And\nthirdly, that Philo accordingly did not assume that the results of\nphilosophical inquiry would often, or even usually, or perhaps ever,\namount to knowledge when subjected to rational criticism through\nargument on either side. (The evidence that might support these three\nclaims is collected in Brittain 2001: ch. 3.) \nThe hypothesis that Philo’s fleshed-out final theory of\nknowledge was roughly along these lines makes sense of both the\ncontext and the reception of his innovations. It also allows us to\noffer a more philosophically satisfying explanation of his eventual\nacceptance of the possibility of knowledge than Antiochus’\nsuggestion that he was unable to endure the criticisms he and other\nAcademics had dealt with for thirty years (Cicero Ac. 2.18).\nBy allowing for the existence of ordinary, fallible knowledge, Philo\nchallenged the epistemological framework of his era; but by limiting\nknowledge so that it did not include most of the results of\nphilosophical inquiry, and by ascribing the acceptance of this view to\nthe entire Academic tradition, he sought to redefine the skeptical\nAcademy in terms of its original Socratic function as the non-dogmatic\ncritic of philosophical pretensions to theoretical knowledge. On this\nview, Academic philosophy is not defined by an epistemological\nposition (as even Clitomachus’ radical skepticism appears to\nhave been), but by the critical method of argument on either side. \nIn defining the Academy only by its critical method, rather than also\nby its acceptance of any epistemological positions, Philo recognized a\nvalue in argument on either side that was independent of the\nconclusions or acts of suspension it yielded: its ability to cultivate\nin others autonomy in dialectical reasoning. In the periods of both\nhis mitigated skepticism and his fallibilism, Philo argued on either\nside in order to judge whether some philosophical view merited his\nassent (see\n sections 3.3–3.4).\n To this end he accepted rational norms of criticism (cf. D. Frede\n1996), so that he was obliged to disregard illicit sources of\npersuasion: e.g., performative aspects of a speaker’s\npresentation of arguments, or a speaker’s reputation (unless\ntheir reputation is cited as a reason for belief). Thus we find in\nPhilonian sources an analysis of the sources of authority and\narguments against epistemic deference (see Cicero Ac. 2.9,\n2.115 and Topica 72–8; cf. Sextus PH\n2.37–46 & M 7.314–42). The evidence\nsuggests that Philo sought to protect auditors from his own authority,\nby concealing his judgments about arguments on either side. At any\nrate, Academics who are associated with Philo or the mitigated\nskepticism he popularized (e.g., Charmadas, Cicero, and Favorinus)\nconcealed their evaluations of arguments, on the grounds that their\nauditors would be better situated to follow the rational norms of\ncriticism (see Cicero On the Orator 1.84, Ac. 2.60,\nOn the Nature of the Gods 1.10–11, On\nDivination 2.150, Tusculan Disputations 5.11 & 5.83,\nOn Fate 1, and Galen On the Best Method of\nTeaching). \nPhilo’s interest in students’ autonomy in dialectical\ncriticism is most often related to his mitigated skepticism (Long\n& Sedley 1987, 1:449: Ioppolo 1993: 210; Brittain 2001:\n111–4; Tarrant 2018). As mentioned above, Philo’s\neducational interests are shared by the Academics Charmadas (Cicero\nOn the Orator 1.84) and Favorinus (Galen On the Best\nMethod of Teaching), whom some identify as mitigated skeptics\n(see Brittain 2001: 213–4; Tarrant 1985: ch. 2 & 2018: 83;\nBrittain 2007: 302; Ioppolo 1993). And since the same concerns about\nrational norms carry over from Philo’s mitigated skepticism to\nhis reconstructed fallibilism (see\n section 3.4),\n it is likely Philo retained this pedagogical view in his Roman Books\n(see also\n section 5). \nAlthough Philo’s philosophy of education is identified most\nclosely with mitigated skepticism, its origin may also be tied to\nClitomachean radical skepticism. Scholarship on Cicero, our best\nsource for the defense of argument on either side on educational\ngrounds, has increasingly defended radically skeptical interpretations\nof some of his dialogues (Brittain 2016: Cappello 2019; Wynne 2018\n& 2021), and Cicero himself associates it with Arcesilaus and\nCarneades (see On Divination 2.150, Tusculan\nDisputations 5.11 & 5.83). It may seem that radical skeptics\nwould not have justified argument on either side for educational\nreasons because they argue for purely destructive ends. But one may\nthink that radical skepticism can ground a Socratic interest in\nothers’ training in dialectic out of a hypothetical acceptance\nof rational norms (see Brittain 2005 [2008]). If this is right, then\nPhilo in the Roman Books had further cause for identifying its\ncritical method as the defining mark of the Academy. \nOur knowledge of Philo’s work in ethics comes almost entirely\nfrom an extended summary of an introductory book or lecture preserved\nwithout any context in an anthology (Stobaeus Anthology 2.7).\nThe summary is puzzling because it presents a picture of Philonian\nethics that seems too dogmatic, and too ordinary, for an Academic,\neven at the time of the Roman Books. The work presents a method for\nteaching ethics in terms of an analogy between philosophy and\nmedicine. This yields a division of ethical teaching into three parts:\na protreptic stage (showing the need for philosophical guidance), a\ntherapeutic stage (adjusting the student’s evaluative concepts),\nand a preservative stage (outlining the life-styles and political\narrangements that promote or maintain happiness by reinforcing these\nadjusted concepts). This is intriguing as an example of the way in\nwhich late Hellenistic philosophers approached the teaching of\npractical ethics (see Annas 1993: 95–96. But it does not look\ninnovative. The analogy between medicine and philosophy is a standard\none in Plato and in Hellenistic ethics. The focus on practical rules\nand the application of technical divisions and sub-divisions is\nderived from the Stoic tradition. And its theoretical claims—for\ninstance, that wisdom or knowledge is necessary for virtue, and that\nvirtue promotes the goal of happiness—do not identify it as an\nexception to the mainstream tradition of weaker or stronger\n“intellectualist” and “eudaemonist” virtue\nethics. In these respects, the summary suggests that Philo’s\nethics was largely unaffected by the wide-ranging and penetrating\ncriticisms of Hellenistic ethics by his Academic predecessors, and\nespecially by Carneades (examined in Algra 1997). \nBut there is reason to think that the summary—which was probably\nwritten five hundred years after Philo’s work—gives a\nmisleading picture of Philonian ethics by not informing us directly of\nthe methods it used to enable and secure the possession of happiness.\nIt is perhaps natural to assume that his methods were the standard\ndogmatic ones. Two aspects of the wider context omitted by the\nexcerptor, however, suggest that Philo’s ethics were in fact\nbased on the Academic method of argument on either side. First, we\nknow that the mitigated skeptics had already come to see their method\nof arguing for and against ethical theses as a way of\nteaching ethics that allowed students to evaluate which views\nwere more persuasive, i.e., had better rational grounds (see\n section 4).\n This is clearest in the case of Philo’s colleague Charmadas in\nCicero On the Orator 1.83–93. It is confirmed by the\ncriticisms of mitigated skepticism from Aenesidemus in Photius\nLibrary 212 170a and Sextus PH 1.226. Secondly, we\nknow that Philo had developed a way to popularize the Academic method\nby incorporating it into a technical system of rhetoric (see Cicero\nOn the Orator 3.110–118 and Tusculan\nDisputations 2.9). But since the function of this system was to\nprovide students with forensic techniques for arguing about moral\nissues, and given that teaching rhetoric in any form was a significant\ndeparture for an Academic philosopher, this development must have had\nsome connection to Philo’s ethical views (see Reinhardt 2000 and\nBrittain 2001). \nWhen the summary is read with this wider context in mind, three\napparently minor points stand out. First, the therapeutic stage,\ndealing with the students’ fundamental conceptions of value, is\ndescribed as the effort to replace “falsely acquired\nbeliefs” with ones “in a healthy state”, rather than\njust false with true beliefs (Stobaeus Anthology 2.7 p.\n40.18–20). Secondly, the preservative stage, concerned with the\nlifestyles that promote or secure happiness, is framed as an\ninvestigation of a set of questions that correspond precisely\nwith the questions dealt with by argument on either side in\nPhilo’s rhetoric (ibid. p. 41.7–14). And, thirdly, that\nkind of general investigation is explicitly distinguished from the\nprovision of straightforwardly prescriptive advice about how\nto behave, which is regarded as a temporary fix for busy people (ibid.\np. 41.16–25). These points can be explained in various ways. But\ngiven the wider context, they suggest that the summary has obscured\nthe central point about Philo’s ethics: its method of teaching\nwas not dogmatic, but the Academic one of argument on either side. \nIf this is right, the summary’s apparent ordinariness and\ndogmatic structure reflect only Philo’s systematic approach to\nethical topics, not its methods or results: Philo did not propose a\ndogmatic ethics, but rather a systematic technique for structuring\nstudents’ moral values into a coherent way of life through their\nrational evaluation of arguments on either side. A philosophical\napproach to ethics of this kind allows students to use their ethical\nintuitions—the knowledge provided by their own\nexperience—to revise and structure their conceptions of value,\nand, on that basis, critically evaluate their general social and\npolitical roles, and select the appropriate actions in a particular\nsituation. An approach of this sort perhaps no longer seems striking\nor innovative, but if Philo adopted it in the early 80s BCE, it\npresented no less a challenge to Hellenistic ethics than his Roman\nBooks did to epistemology. Two reasons to think that Philo did adopt\nthis approach are, first, that it yields a conception of ethical\nknowledge that fits the epistemology of the Roman Books—a\nPhilonian rational agent will have the sort of wisdom and happiness\nthat is available to ordinary people, i.e., something quite unlike the\nillusory promise of inerrant knowledge and moral perfection promised\nby the Stoics. And, secondly, Philo’s student Cicero may have\nadopted something like a mitigatedly skeptical version of this\napproach both in his personal life (see Griffin 1989) and in his\nphilosophical works on ethics (see Schofield 2002). \nOn this reconstruction of his work, Philo eventually abandoned both\nradical and mitigated skepticism for a form of fallibilism that he\ndescribed as the basis of the Academic tradition. His promotion of\nAcademic philosophy as open-ended critical inquiry had some impact on\nthe work of Cicero, Plutarch, Favorinus and Augustine, but his radical\ninnovations in epistemology and ethics sank almost without trace. The\nskeptical tradition survived in the form of Pyrrhonism, but the\nAcademy did not. Like any interpretation of Philo’s\nphilosophical development, this reconstruction is speculative in some\nrespects. But much of it can be confirmed or disconfirmed by further\nwork on ancient skepticism, and especially its Latin tradition, which\nremains an open field for research.","contact.mail":"cfb9@cornell.edu","contact.domain":"cornell.edu"},{"date.published":"2006-10-05","date.changed":"2021-03-25","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philo-larissa/","author1":"Charles Brittain","author2":"Peter Osorio","author1.info":"https://classics.cornell.edu/charles-francis-brittain/","entry":"philo-larissa","body.text":"\n\n\nPhilo (159/8–84/3 BCE) was the last known head of Plato’s\nAcademy during its skeptical phase. Under his leadership, the\nAcademics abandoned the radical skepticism of Arcesilaus and Carneades\n(who professed to live without rationally warranted beliefs) in favor\nof a form of mitigated skepticism allowing for provisional beliefs\nthat did not claim certainty. But Philo himself seems to have gone a\nstep further in his controversial “Roman Books”, where he\nrejected the Stoic definition of knowledge on which the\nAcademics’ mitigated skepticism relied. The evidence suggests\nthat he proposed instead a weaker, fallibilist theory that allowed for\nordinary knowledge but did not support the theoretical dogmatism of\nthe Academics’ philosophical rivals. By challenging the accepted\nepistemological framework of the Hellenistic period, Philo thus\ninadvertently helped to set the stage for the subsequent revival of\nPlatonism as a dogmatic tradition based on the interpretation of\nPlatonic doctrines. He is most widely known, however, as the teacher\nof Cicero, through whose work Academic skepticism became known in the\nLatin-reading world.\n\nThe external facts of Philo’s career are largely undisputed. He\nwas born in 159/8 BCE (but see Fleischer 2017b). After eight years of\nstudy with Callicles, a student of Carneades, in his native Larissa,\nPhilo moved to Athens in 134/3 BCE, where he spent fourteen years with\nClitomachus, another of Carneades’ students, who was the\nscholarch (or head) of the Academy from 129/8 (or perhaps 127/6) to\nhis death in 110/9 BCE. Philo was elected to replace Clitomachus in\nthat year, and remained the scholarch until his death in 84/3 BCE. \nPhilo’s tenure as head of the Academy was troubled by two\nevents. First, in the late 90s BCE his authority was challenged by the\nsecession of his student Antiochus of Ascalon, who set up a rival\nanti-skeptic “Old Academy”. (A second student,\nAenesidemus, also left the Academy to found or revive the radically\nskeptical Pyrrhonist school, probably in the 90s BCE; but the dating\nof this secession to Philo’s tenure as scholarch is insecure.)\nSecondly, civil unrest in Athens and the threat of the Mithridatic war\nled to an exodus of Academic philosophers to safer cities. Philo\nhimself moved to Rome in 89/8 BCE, where he continued to give lectures\nand published his “Roman Books”. It is unclear whether he\never returned to Athens after its “pacification” by the\nRomans in 86 BCE. The name of his successor as scholarch, who probably\noversaw the final demise of the Academy as an institution, is also\nunclear. (The section of Philodemus’ Catalogue of Academic\nPhilosophers—our main source for his\nbiography—dealing with Philo’s death, his students, and\nhis successor, is at several points illegible; see Fleischer 2017c.)\nNone of Philo’s written works survive, but we possess a summary\nof a work on ethics, some direct evidence for his Roman Books and\nearlier epistemological views, and indirect evidence for a work on\nrhetoric. \nSince the evidence for Philo’s various epistemological views is\nphilosophically rich but radically incomplete, their interpretation is\nunsurprisingly controversial. The primary sources agree that\nPhilo’s views evolved between his election as scholarch in 110/9\nBCE and the publication of the Roman Books in 88 BCE; but the precise\nstages of his epistemological evolution and the arguments that led\nPhilo to change his mind are not explicitly described in the texts we\nhave. \nOur evidence indicates (and no scholar disputes this) that Philo began\nas an adherent of the radical skepticism attributed to Carneades by\nClitomachus. The two central questions that the evidence appears to\nleave open are: \nIn order to understand these questions it is important to know\nsomething about the context in which Philo’s views evolved.\nSeveral sources make it clear that when Philo arrived in Athens in the\n130s BCE, the Academy was sharply divided over the legacy of\nCarneades. One side, led by Clitomachus, advocated radical skepticism\nas the authentic Carneadean position, while another, led by Metrodorus\nof Stratonicea, promoted some form of mitigated skepticism. We know,\nhowever, that Philo was elected scholarch in 110/9 BCE as a\nrepresentative of the Clitomachian, i.e., radically skeptical, wing of\nthe Academy (see Numenius fragment 28). We also know that the\nepistemological views in his Roman Books in 88 BCE were regarded as\nshocking innovations by Academics of all kinds (see Cicero\nAcademica [Ac.] 2.18). \nWith respect to the first question, this suggests that, if Philo\nabandoned radical skepticism prior to the Roman Books, then he adopted\nthe form of mitigated skepticism earlier attributed to Carneades by\nMetrodorus. Otherwise he held the same view from the 130s BCE until\nleaving Athens in 89/8 BCE. \nOn the second question, about the epistemological position of the\nRoman Books, the limited textual evidence has elicited from\ninterpreters three answers: some form of mitigated skepticism,\nfallibilism, or Platonism. The first answer implies that Philo’s\nview developed once, from radical to mitigated skepticism, whether\nprior to (Sedley 1981; Vezzoli 2011; Tarrant 2018) or in the Roman\nBooks (Glucker 1978; Lévy 1992, 2010). According to the second\nanswer, the Roman Books adopted a form of fallibilism. Philo’s\ninnovation in the Roman Books may then be understood either as his\nfirst departure from radical skepticism (Hankinson 1995; Thorsrud\n2009) or as a second change of view, now from mitigated skepticism (M.\nFrede 1987; Barnes 1989; Striker 1997; Brittain 2001). The third\nanswer, that the Roman Books advocated a form of Platonism, may\nsimilarly presume Philo’s views developed either once, from\nradical skepticism directly to Platonism (Glidden 1996), or twice,\nfirst from radical skepticism to mitigated skepticism and then to\nPlatonism (Tarrant 1985). \nGiven these two questions and the interpretive constraints on their\nanswers, we arrive at a schema of five accounts of Philo’s\nepistemological development: \nThe resolution of these questions depends primarily on an\ninterpretation of Cicero’s Academica, our principal,\nand only first-hand, philosophical source for Academic skepticism. But\nthis text strongly suggests Philo held three epistemological positions\nover his career, since Cicero identifies and distinguishes three\npositions held by different Academics in Philo’s lifetime: a\nradical skepticism associated with Clitomachus (e.g., in Ac.\n2.78, 2.108); a form of mitigated skepticism held by a group of\nAcademics who regarded it as incompatible with the Roman Books\n(Ac. 2.148, 2.11–12 & 2.18); and the Roman\nBook view (Ac. 2.18). So it is clear that the Roman\nBooks did represent a third distinct Academic position. It also seems\nclear that they represented Philo’s third\nepistemological view, because the interpretation of Carneades that\ngenerated the second view is explicitly tied to Philo and Metrodorus\n(Ac. 2.78, cf. 2.148), while we know that the Roman Books\noffered a novel interpretation of Arcesilaus and Carneades that was\ncontested by the proponents of the second view (Ac.\n2.11–12, 2.18). We can thus safely infer, in response to the\nfirst question above, that Philo advocated mitigated skepticism at\nsome point in the 90s BCE, prior to the Roman Books of 88 BCE and\nafter his election to the scholarchate as a Clitomachian radical\nskeptic in 110/9 BCE. That this is correct is confirmed by the\ncriticisms of mitigated skepticism aimed at Philo by his student\nAntiochus before the Roman Books (see\n section 3.4\n below), and by the fact that virtually all the generic references to\nAcademic skepticism in later writers assume that it was a form of\nmitigated skepticism (see, e.g., Gellius Attic Nights 11.5.8,\nPhotius Library 212.170a, Plutarch Stoic\nContradictions ch. 10, and Sextus Outlines of Skepticism\n[PH] 1.226–31). Since Metrodorus was regarded as\nunorthodox, the only plausible candidate for the creation of this\nreceived view of Academic skepticism is a work by Philo from the 90s\nBCE. \nThe second question above is much simpler to dispose of once the first\nhas been resolved. If Philo had previously been a mitigated skeptic\nand the Roman Books presented an epistemological innovation, his final\nposition was not mitigated skepticism. But we have excellent evidence\nthat it wasn’t a (recognizable) form of Platonism, since\nAntiochus and Numenius flatly rejected it, despite being avowed\nrevivers of Platonism. (The only evidence in favor of the Platonist\nhypothesis is an explicitly unsupported fantasy in Augustine, to the\neffect that Platonist doctrines were secretly taught in the Academy\nthroughout its skeptical phase [Against the Academics\n3.37–43].) The fallibilist interpretation of the Roman Books is\nthus at least prima facie the most plausible candidate\noffered to date. Whether it is in fact a satisfying candidate will\ndepend on its ability to present a coherent philosophical\ninterpretation of the development of Philo’s epistemological\nviews from the evidence we have. \nThe following sections thus offer an interpretation of Philo’s\nphilosophical development on the hypothesis that he held three\ndistinct epistemological views, as proposed by the Radical Skepticism\n→ Mitigated Skepticism → Fallibilism account above. It is\nworth stressing, however, that, given the uncertainties of our\nevidence, the exegetical and historical arguments above cannot be\nregarded as conclusive. The case is not closed (see, e.g., Glucker\n2004 and Tarrant 2018). \nPhilo’s distinct epistemological views share one fundamental\nfeature: all of them deny the possibility of knowledge according to\nthe dominant Stoic conception of it. The essential context for\nunderstanding Philo is thus the critique of Stoic epistemology offered\nby Academic philosophers, and especially by Arcesilaus and Carneades,\nover the preceding hundred and fifty years (c. 280–130 BCE). \nThe Stoics’ epistemology was designed to accommodate their\nbelief that it must be possible, in principle, to achieve the sort of\ninerrant wisdom Socrates had desired. The Stoic theory depends on\nthree innovations (see, e.g., Cicero Ac. 1.40–2.). (1)\nThey defined the formation of a belief as a matter of assenting to an\noccurrent thought or impression that something is, or is not, the\ncase. (2) They isolated a certain kind of perceptual (and perhaps also\nnon-perceptual) impression as “cognitive”\n(cataleptic), because it was self-warranting, such that\nassenting to these impressions constituted a “cognition”\n(catalepsis—lit. a “grasp”) of the state of\naffairs they represented. And (3) they took secure knowledge of the\nsort Socrates sought to be the state of an agent whose beliefs are\nconstituted entirely by perceptual and non-perceptual cognitions. As a\nresult, given their ethical doctrine that secure knowledge was\nnecessary and sufficient for happiness, and since, according to (3),\nsuch knowledge could be achieved by restricting one’s assent to\ncognitive impressions, the Stoics identified the avoidance of opinion\nand error—i.e., assent to non-cognitive impressions, whether\ninadequately warranted (opinion) or false (error)—as the\noverriding principle of rationality. \nThe Academics attacked every part of this Stoic theory—their\npractice was to argue against all philosophical positions—but\ntheir criticism focused, unsurprisingly, on the central notion of the\ncognitive impression. The Stoics standardly defined a cognitive\nimpression as one that came from what is, was stamped and impressed\nexactly in accordance with it, and was, accordingly, such that it\ncouldn’t be false (see, e.g., Sextus Adversus\nMathematicos [ M] 7.248 or Cicero\nAc. 2.77). They took this to mean, roughly, that an\nimpression is cognitive if and only if \nThe general Academic tactic against this view was to concede the\npossibility that an impression might meet conditions [a] and [b], but\nargue that condition [c] never obtained. They appealed to our\nexperience of twins etc. and in abnormal states such as dreams,\nillusions and episodes of madness to show that it was always possible\nto have a false impression with exactly the same richness and detail\nof representation as a true one; it follows that meeting condition [b]\ncould never suffice to show that condition [c] obtains, with the\nresult that the warrant claimed in [c] is never available to us. (See,\ne.g., Sextus M 7.402–10 & Cicero Ac.\n2.84–90). \nThe Academics used these arguments to point out that if our\nimpressions are never self-warranting in the way cognitive impressions\nare supposed to be, and if the Stoic definition of the cognitive\nimpression is correct, there is no cognition. Hence, if all knowledge\ndepends on cognitions, as the Stoics claim, nothing at all can be\nknown. The Academics also offered a corollary to this argument,\ndrawing on the Stoic principle of rationality mentioned above: \nThus, according to the Stoic theory, once it is shown that there are\nno cognitive impressions as they define them, if there are any wise\npeople, they will have no beliefs; and, whether there are any wise\npeople or not, it is never rational to assent to any impression. (See,\ne.g., Sextus M 7.150–7 & Cicero Ac.\n2.66–8 & 2.77–8). \nThe Stoics, of course, came up with plenty of sophisticated\ncounter-arguments to the criticisms of the cognitive impression, to\nwhich the Academics devised equally subtle responses. But one argument\nin particular seems to have seriously troubled the Academic students\nof Carneades: the Stoic “inactivity” objection. This was a\nvery simple practical reductio, connected to the corollary\nargument given above: if the Academics were right it would be\nimpossible to act at all (let alone well), since voluntary action\ndepends on beliefs and thus on assent (see, e.g., Cicero Ac.\n2.24–5 and 2.34–7). But since action (indeed, good action)\nis possible, the Academics must be mistaken. The later Academics saw\nthree ways in which they could respond to this counter-argument\nwithout giving up their arguments against cognitive impressions. They\ncould: \nThese three options turn out to define the three Academic positions\nPhilo held: position [1] was the core of Clitomachus’ defense of\nradical skepticism; position [2] was the basis of Philo’s\ndefense of mitigated skepticism; and position [3] was the one Philo\ndefended in the Roman Books. \nThe dialectic of Academic and Stoic argument and counter-argument\noutlined above may give the impression that Carneades, and the earlier\nAcademic skeptics more generally, were committed to the conclusions\nthat they argued for, i.e., that there are no cognitive impressions,\nthat nothing can be known, that the wise person will suspend assent\nuniversally, etc. But there are several reasons to doubt that\nCarneades straightforwardly believed on the basis of these arguments\nthat nothing can be known and that it is irrational to assent to any\nimpression (see M. Frede 1987). First, such a position is obviously\ninconsistent: since beliefs are assents on the Stoic view (and\nCarneades’ arguments rely on Stoic assumptions), the two\nconclusions cannot be consistently held at one time by a rational\nagent. Secondly, the arguments only work if one already accepts a\nbasically Stoic epistemological framework, i.e., their theory of\nimpressions, their empiricism, their conception of knowledge, their\npsychological doctrine etc. But Carneades had no reason to accept any\nof these highly contestable views rather than, e.g., the Platonic or\nEpicurean alternatives. And, thirdly, we know that the Academic method\nof argument was dialectical: Carneades made it his practice to argue\nfor and against any and all philosophical views. And, in this\nparticular case, there is good reason to think that his arguments were\ndesigned to show the inadequacies of the Stoic view and their\napparently skeptical consequences for the Stoics themselves. This is\nmore or less directly attested in some sources (Numenius fr. 27,\nSextus M 7.159–64, cf. 7.150), as well as evident\nfrom the fact that Carneades was happy to try several incompatible\nresponses to the Stoic reductio argument—viz. options\n[1] and [2] above—both of which can easily be read as further\ncriticisms of Stoic epistemological views (see Striker 1980 [1996] and\nAllen 1994). \nSo Carneades was not committed to the views that nothing can be known\nand that it is always irrational to assent on the basis of\nthese anti-Stoic arguments: the latter do not give him reasons to\nbelieve their conclusions. Nevertheless, it seems likely that he\nwas committed to them in some sense, since the Stoics and other\nphilosophers kept on arguing against these views as if they were his,\nor the Academic, position, and some of his students clearly agreed.\n(Carneades’ actual position remains controversial; see Bett 1989\nand Allen 2004 [2020].) Clitomachus, at any rate, advocated an\ninterpretation of Carneades’ skepticism that saw his method of\nargument on either side of all philosophical questions as motivated by\nsome sort of commitment to the view that it is irrational to assent to\nanything less than what one knows to be true, and as resulting in a\nsimilar kind of commitment to the view that nothing can be known. And\nit was this interpretation of Carneades that Philo held at the start\nof his Academic career (Numenius fr. 28). \nClitomachus defended the consistency of a radical skepticism of this\nsort by denying that assent is necessary for action or belief, as the\nStoics had claimed in their inactivity objection to the Academic\ncorollary argument\n (section 3.1\n above). His defense came in two stages, both appealing to arguments\nCarneades had used in response to the Stoic objection. The first stage\nidentified a way to discriminate between our thoughts without\nappealing to their objective status as true or as\n“cognitive” impressions (see Cicero Ac.\n2.98–99, cf. 2.32). Here Clitomachus drew on Carneades’\n“theory of probable [or, better, ‘persuasive’\n(pithanon)] impressions”—i.e., the description of\nordinary epistemic procedures that Carneades promoted as an\nalternative to the Stoic theory of cognitive impressions (see Sextus\nM 7. 166–89 and Allen 1994). In ordinary life,\nCarneades argued, we proceed without assuming that a set of what the\nStoics call impressions is “cognitive” or immediately\nwarranted to be true. Rather, some “impressions” leave us\nwith no immediate inclination to accept them, while some strike us as\nsubjectively “persuasive”, at least initially, owing to\ntheir internal characteristics (e.g., the richness of their\nrepresentation). We can increase or diminish the initial\npersuasiveness of our impressions by considering the perceptual\nconditions under which we experience them (e.g., normal perceptual\nconditions for perceiving the state of affairs they represent), and\ntheir fit with our other impressions (e.g., normal coherence\nconditions). And we accept and act on impressions when they reach the\nlevel of persuasiveness we find appropriate to the situation we are\nin. But, Clitomachus insisted, none of these procedures is sufficient\nto establish that an impression is true or “cognitive”,\nsince, as the Academics have argued, the representational features of\nany true impression can always be replicated by a false one. (See\nCicero Ac. 2.98–99.) And there is no reason to think\nthat in ordinary life we assume that the procedures are sufficient\n(see Plutarch Common Conceptions ch. 36). \nThis first stage gives the Academic a procedure that allows for\ndiscrimination between impressions while preserving the Academic\nthesis that nothing can be known. The second stage of\nClitomachus’ defense drew on Carneades’ criticisms of the\nStoic unitary notion of assent as simply a matter of taking an\nimpression (or its content) to be true. Carneades had argued that this\nfails to account for the complexity of our cognitive life: many of our\nactions are not the product of distinct acts of assent, but are rather\nunconscious, or habitual, like animal action; and we sometimes\ndeliberately act without assent, for instance, when we follow\nunendorsed hypotheses or act in conditions of uncertainty (see Bett\n1990). On the basis of considerations of this sort, Clitomachus argued\nthat we should distinguish “assenting” to an impression,\nin the Stoic sense of taking it to be true, from\n“approving” an impression, in the sense of acting on it or\naccepting it as if it were true. (See Cicero Ac.\n2.104.) \nThis second stage gives the Academics a way of accepting impressions\nand acting on them that preserves the thesis that rationality demands\nthat one should always suspend assent. Thus, by combining both stages,\nClitomachus was able to argue that the Academic is free to\n“follow” or “approve” persuasive impressions\nwithout assenting to them: the Academic has a “practical\ncriterion” that allows for action without presupposing the\ncognitive access to objective truth required for rational assent\n(Sextus M 7. 166; cf. Cicero Ac. 2.108).\nClitomachus, however, did not restrict the application of this\n“practical” criterion to cases of ordinary action\n(pace Görler 1994). He also explicitly claimed that it\ngave the radical skeptics a means to explain their philosophical\nactivities, i.e., their arguments and views (Cicero Ac.\n2.104; cf. 2.32). He was thus in a position to explain the\nAcademics’ apparent commitment to the theses that assent is\nirrational and knowledge is unattainable. These are views that the\nradical skeptic finds “persuasive”; but they are not\n“beliefs”, at least not in the Stoic sense, because the\nAcademic does not take them to be true. \nOne might plausibly question whether Carneades’ resistance to\n(straightforward Stoic) assent was the “heroic” defense of\nrationality against opinion and error Clitomachus took it to be\n(Cicero Ac. 2.108). It remains very controversial whether\nthere is a coherent distinction to be made between approving a view\nand assenting to its truth (see the wider discussion in Burnyeat &\nFrede [ed.] 1998). But a case can be made that acts of pretense,\nimagination, and supposition require taking on views in a manner\ndistinct from that of belief and that the rational activities of the\nradical skeptic are founded on supposition (see Striker 1980 [1996];\nBett 1990; Reinhardt 2018). Another way to support the distinction is\nto note that the process of arguing for and against a thesis, in the\nway Carneades did, can leave one stuck with a view one way or the\nother, but without being aware of any rational ground for preferring\nthis view. After constant repetition of this process, one can see how\nthe Academics might have come to have the view that their views or\n“beliefs” are all non-rational in the specific sense that\nthey were not actively formed in accordance with the explicit criteria\nof rationality advocated by the dogmatic philosophers. And if they\nremained committed—in the same attenuated or\n“non-rational” sense—to the Socratic ideal of\ninerrant knowledge, one can see why they might try to preserve their\nrationality by not giving their assent to the views they found\nthemselves holding. A case along these lines is made in Brittain 2005\n[2008]. Philo, at any rate, initially agreed with Clitomachus that\nCarneades’ ability to maintain something like these critical\nstances towards all beliefs—his own as well as the theories of\nhis philosophical opponents—represented a paradigm of\nself-conscious rationality (see Numenius fr. 28). \nClitomachus’ interpretation of Carneades’ skepticism was\nthe dominant view in the Academy in the period c. 130–100 BCE.\nBut it was always contested, initially by Metrodorus, and later by\nPhilo himself. The basis for the alternative interpretation was a\nsecond response Carneades had given to the Stoic inactivity objection\n(position [2] in\n section 3.1\n above), arguing that it is sometimes rational to assent to\nnon-cognitive impressions (see Cicero Ac. 2.78, cf. 2.53).\nClitomachus had taken this as just an ad hominem argument,\ndesigned to challenge the Stoic defense of the view that the\noverriding principle of rationality is avoidance of any possibility of\nerror (see Cicero Ac. 2.67–8). Metrodorus and his\nfollowers, however, thought that this was a statement of\nCarneades’ own view, and adopted it themselves. \nThere is no direct evidence to explain Philo’s shift from\nradical to mitigated skepticism. But we can learn something about the\ngeneral motivations he may have had for adopting his new position from\nthe ways in which some mitigated skeptics understood the Carneadean\nnotion of “persuasive impressions”. In the case of\nperceptual impressions, the difference between their view and the\nClitomachian position is clarified by a criticism from Philo’s\nformer student Antiochus that some Academics took persuasive\nimpressions to be a criterion of truth, rather than just of\naction and philosophical criticism (see Sextus\nM 7.435–8 and Cicero Ac. 2.32–6).\nThis shows that these Academics understood the mechanisms Carneades\nhad outlined for increasing the persuasiveness of impressions to\nprovide a means of confirming or disconfirming—in various\ndegrees, though never ones that warranted them\nconclusively—whether they were likely to be true or not. These\nmitigated skeptics thus believed that the persuasiveness of perceptual\nimpressions under the right perceptual and coherence conditions as\ndefeasible, but rational, evidence for their truth. We find a\nsimilar move in the case of non-perceptual impressions: some mitigated\nskeptics formed tentative beliefs as to which positions are more\nlikely to be true (see, e.g., Cicero Ac. 2.148), after using\nthe standard Academic practice of arguing on either side of\nphilosophical questions as a means of rationally evaluating arguments\n(see Cicero Ac. 2.7, 2.60 & On the Nature of the\nGods 1.11, Galen On the Best Method of Teaching ch. 1,\nand Plutarch Stoic Contradictions ch. 10). These mitigated\nskeptics thus changed the status of argument on either side from a\ncritical practice ending in suspension of assent into a positive\nmethod for rationally confirming and, indirectly, teaching\nphilosophical beliefs. \nIt is not difficult to see how this shift in the understanding of\npersuasive impressions might lead to a re-evaluation of the conception\nof rationality shared by Stoics and, at least in part, by the radical\nskeptics. Clitomachus had agreed with the Stoics that avoiding error\nis a necessary condition for rationality, and consequently, given the\napparent unavailability of knowledge, advocated suspending assent\nuniversally. But once Philo had begun to use persuasiveness as a\nrational method for evaluating impressions, the radically skeptical\nposition started to look more like an abdication of rationality than\nits paradigm. Granted that nothing can be known—a view the\nmitigated skeptics continued to find extremely persuasive (see Cicero\nAc. 2.148)—it still seems that we are rationally\nobliged to form the best beliefs we can, given the evidence available\nto us. And while this will involve the possibility of error, the\nrefusal to use the evidence we have seems absurd when it is\ngeneralized to every case—and immoral in the case of ethics,\nsince without some regulatory beliefs, it is unlikely that our lives\ncould be virtuous or happy (see\n section 4). \nThese reasons, then, or something like them, led Philo, along with\nother mitigated skeptics, to the formal position that, while nothing\ncould be known (as shown by the Academic arguments against the\npossibility of cognitive impressions), it is nevertheless rational to\nassent under certain conditions, i.e., to hold beliefs based on\nreasons (Cicero Ac. 2.78). The mitigated skeptics retained\nthe Stoic characterization of such beliefs as “opinions”\nto mark the fact that, despite the rational grounds they had for\nholding them, they were just rational beliefs—i.e.,\nthey did not amount to “cognitions” or knowledge (Cicero\nAc. 2.148). But they also distinguished rational\nopinions of this sort from the general Stoic category of opinion as\nany assent to a non-cognitive impression (and hence as always bad), by\nqualifying their assent to them as “measured”—that\nis, as provisional on their avowedly inconclusive evidence, rather\nthan as a straightforward commitment to their truth. (See the\nanonymous Introduction to Plato ch. 7 and Gellius Attic\nNights 11.5.8. Sextus mis-ascribes this view to Clitomachus in\nPH 1.226 & 1.229–30.) \nThe significant difference between this position and radical\nskepticism is clear from the principal example of a mitigatedly\nskeptical “opinion” that we have: the thesis that nothing\ncan be known (see, e.g., Cicero Ac. 2.148, Gellius Attic\nNights 11.5.8, Galen On the Best Method for Teaching ch.\n1). The mitigated skeptics evidently believed this thesis on the\nbasis of the Academic arguments considered in\n section 3.1\n above. But this means that, despite their rejection of the existence\nof cognitive impressions and their new principle of rationality, their\nskepticism was heavily parasitic on Stoic epistemology: they accepted\na dogmatic epistemological framework, such that they believed the\nStoic theory of impressions, Stoic empiricism, the Stoic conception of\nknowledge, and so on. One does not need to see this as a weakness to\nnotice that the ties between mitigated skepticism and its dogmatic\nframework render it liable to redundancy, in a way radical skepticism\nis not, if the philosophical conception of knowledge itself\nchanges. \nPhilo’s motivation for his final shift away from skepticism in\nthe Roman Books can be seen, at least in part, from the criticisms\ndirected at him by his ex-student Antiochus before their publication\nin 88/7 BCE. These criticisms point to a kind of instability inherent\nin mitigated skepticism: it seems to waver unhealthily between a\ndogmatic position allowing for something approaching certainty about\nsome questions and a radical skepticism about our ability to make any\nepistemic progress. More specifically, it suggests that we can take\npersuasive impressions as evidence for the truth that is firm enough\nto warrant assent—thus allowing for a life guided by reasoned\nbelief, and even ethical teaching—while simultaneously\nmaintaining that even the most perfect rational consideration of the\nevidence is compatible with wholesale error. (See the argument in\nCicero Ac. 2.111, addressed explicitly to Philo prior to his\nRoman view, and its elaboration in Ac. 2.34–6 &\n2.43–44. These Antiochian criticisms are echoed almost verbatim\nby Aenesidemus in Photius Library 212 170a 14–38.) \nThe outlines of Philo’s response to this problem in the Roman\nBooks are fairly clear from the direct evidence we have for their\nepistemological innovations (Cicero Ac. 2.18 and Sextus\nPH 1.235). He argued, first, that the Stoic definition of the\ncognitive impression ruled out the possibility of anything being\nknown—i.e., he restated the standard Academic arguments to this\neffect—and, secondly, that this definition was therefore\nmisconceived, since at least some things could be known. His\nelucidation of the second claim is unfortunately not explicit in the\nsurviving evidence. But its criticism by Antiochus (the context for\nCicero’s report) very strongly suggests that Philo offered an\nalternative and weaker definition of knowledge of single propositions.\nFor Antiochus both characterizes Philo’s innovations as an\nattempt to redefine “cognition” (Ac. 2.17 &\n2.18 fin.) and attempts to refute them by arguing that an impression\nthat does not meet the condition given in the third clause of the\nStoic definition (see\n section 3.1\n above) cannot be “cognitive”. Philo’s new\ndefinition thus amounted to something like the Stoic definition minus\nits third clause (the clause the Academics had always disputed). If\nso, Philo claimed that an impression is cognitive if it is both [a]\ntrue and [b] caused in the appropriate way for correctly representing\nits object—without adding the disputed Stoic rider [c], that its\ntruth is warranted by the inimitable richness and detail of\nrepresentation guaranteed by its causal history. \nThis bare outline of Philo’s final position is sufficient to\nshow its novelty, and thus explain its poor reception by Antiochus and\nthe Academics alike (see Ac. 2.11–12, 2.18). His new\nconception of knowledge was a radical innovation in three respects.\nFirst, given his acceptance of the standard Academic arguments against\nself-warranting cognitive impressions, it offered a fallibilist\ntheory, which allows for unqualified assent to knowledge claims on the\nbasis of impressions that might nonetheless be false. Antiochus’\ncriticism suggests that he defended this view by pointing out that the\ntheoretical or counterfactual possibility of error was epistemically\nirrelevant in cases where the impression is in fact true and our\npositive evidence for it is, in practice, conclusive (see Barnes\n1989). But however he justified it, Philo’s new conception of\nknowledge challenged the fundamental epistemological principle of the\nHellenistic period that knowledge must be certain. Secondly,\nPhilo’s new theory implied that there is in fact a good deal of\nknowledge. It thus constituted an apparently radical rejection of the\nbasic thesis that all the skeptical Academics had shared, that nothing\ncan be known. And, thirdly, Philo’s theory implied a revised\nprinciple of rationality. The mitigated skeptics had responded to the\nStoic inactivity objection by identifying rationality with forming\ndefeasible beliefs on the basis of the available evidence. But, by\nqualifying the assent of the rational agent as “measured”\nor provisional, they insulated rationality itself from practical\nerror: whether or not the belief is false, an agent who forms it on\nthe appropriate grounds is never mistaken in holding it provisionally.\nOn Philo’s new position, however, rationality is compatible with\noutright error because it is rational to give straightforward,\nunqualified assent to impressions that might nonetheless be false. The\nRoman Books thus marked Philo’s final rejection of the joint\nStoic and Academic thesis that the avoidance of error is an overriding\nprinciple of rationality. \nThis sketch of their implications explains why Philo’s\ninnovations were decisive enough to startle his contemporaries and,\neventually, to lead to the doxographical classification of his version\nof Academicism as a distinct “Fourth Academy” (see, e.g.,\nSextus PH 1.220 & 1.235). But two facts imply that his\nfurther elucidation in the Roman Books included some significant\nlimitations on the range of knowledge Philo came to accept, and hence\nthe sense in which he rejected the skepticism of his Academic\npredecessors. The first is just that his contemporaries (and later\nhistorians) continued to regard him, even at the end of his career, as\nan Academic, i.e., in some way a follower of Arcesilaus and Carneades,\nrather than a defector like Antiochus or Aenesidemus. The second is\nthat Philo asserted “the unity of the Academy” in the\nRoman Books (see Cicero Ac. 1.13), i.e., claimed that his new\nview was in fact the underlying view of all the Academics from\nSocrates and Plato to himself. Exactly what he meant by this claim is\ncontroversial, but the tenuous and complex evidence does not suggest\nthat it involved either accepting an anti-skeptical reading of Plato\nor denying that the skeptical Academics were skeptical about the\npossibility of achieving theoretical knowledge in philosophy (see\nBrittain 2001: chs. 4–5 and Tarrant 2018: 86–87). \nBy combining these external constraints on our understanding of the\nepistemological innovations of the Roman Books with their\nphilosophical context—Philo’s prior position of mitigated\nskepticism and the criticisms it faced—we can see, at least\nroughly, how Philo may have given flesh to the basic outline above.\nTaken together, these considerations suggest three constraints on the\nrange of the knowledge that Philo accepted. They suggest, first, that\nPhilo supplemented the externalist bones of his new definition of\ncognition with the internalist constraints on assent that the\nmitigated skeptics had already identified: assent to a Philonian\ncognitive impression would only be warranted when the representational\n“richness” guaranteed by its causal history (condition [b]\nabove) was confirmed by meeting the additional perceptual and\ncoherence conditions Carneades had identified for persuasive\nimpressions. Secondly, that Philo took Philonian cognition to apply\nprimarily to experiential knowledge, i.e., the kind that we ascribe to\nourselves in virtue of perception and to experts with practical\nskills, or something like “ordinary knowledge”. And\nthirdly, that Philo accordingly did not assume that the results of\nphilosophical inquiry would often, or even usually, or perhaps ever,\namount to knowledge when subjected to rational criticism through\nargument on either side. (The evidence that might support these three\nclaims is collected in Brittain 2001: ch. 3.) \nThe hypothesis that Philo’s fleshed-out final theory of\nknowledge was roughly along these lines makes sense of both the\ncontext and the reception of his innovations. It also allows us to\noffer a more philosophically satisfying explanation of his eventual\nacceptance of the possibility of knowledge than Antiochus’\nsuggestion that he was unable to endure the criticisms he and other\nAcademics had dealt with for thirty years (Cicero Ac. 2.18).\nBy allowing for the existence of ordinary, fallible knowledge, Philo\nchallenged the epistemological framework of his era; but by limiting\nknowledge so that it did not include most of the results of\nphilosophical inquiry, and by ascribing the acceptance of this view to\nthe entire Academic tradition, he sought to redefine the skeptical\nAcademy in terms of its original Socratic function as the non-dogmatic\ncritic of philosophical pretensions to theoretical knowledge. On this\nview, Academic philosophy is not defined by an epistemological\nposition (as even Clitomachus’ radical skepticism appears to\nhave been), but by the critical method of argument on either side. \nIn defining the Academy only by its critical method, rather than also\nby its acceptance of any epistemological positions, Philo recognized a\nvalue in argument on either side that was independent of the\nconclusions or acts of suspension it yielded: its ability to cultivate\nin others autonomy in dialectical reasoning. In the periods of both\nhis mitigated skepticism and his fallibilism, Philo argued on either\nside in order to judge whether some philosophical view merited his\nassent (see\n sections 3.3–3.4).\n To this end he accepted rational norms of criticism (cf. D. Frede\n1996), so that he was obliged to disregard illicit sources of\npersuasion: e.g., performative aspects of a speaker’s\npresentation of arguments, or a speaker’s reputation (unless\ntheir reputation is cited as a reason for belief). Thus we find in\nPhilonian sources an analysis of the sources of authority and\narguments against epistemic deference (see Cicero Ac. 2.9,\n2.115 and Topica 72–8; cf. Sextus PH\n2.37–46 & M 7.314–42). The evidence\nsuggests that Philo sought to protect auditors from his own authority,\nby concealing his judgments about arguments on either side. At any\nrate, Academics who are associated with Philo or the mitigated\nskepticism he popularized (e.g., Charmadas, Cicero, and Favorinus)\nconcealed their evaluations of arguments, on the grounds that their\nauditors would be better situated to follow the rational norms of\ncriticism (see Cicero On the Orator 1.84, Ac. 2.60,\nOn the Nature of the Gods 1.10–11, On\nDivination 2.150, Tusculan Disputations 5.11 & 5.83,\nOn Fate 1, and Galen On the Best Method of\nTeaching). \nPhilo’s interest in students’ autonomy in dialectical\ncriticism is most often related to his mitigated skepticism (Long\n& Sedley 1987, 1:449: Ioppolo 1993: 210; Brittain 2001:\n111–4; Tarrant 2018). As mentioned above, Philo’s\neducational interests are shared by the Academics Charmadas (Cicero\nOn the Orator 1.84) and Favorinus (Galen On the Best\nMethod of Teaching), whom some identify as mitigated skeptics\n(see Brittain 2001: 213–4; Tarrant 1985: ch. 2 & 2018: 83;\nBrittain 2007: 302; Ioppolo 1993). And since the same concerns about\nrational norms carry over from Philo’s mitigated skepticism to\nhis reconstructed fallibilism (see\n section 3.4),\n it is likely Philo retained this pedagogical view in his Roman Books\n(see also\n section 5). \nAlthough Philo’s philosophy of education is identified most\nclosely with mitigated skepticism, its origin may also be tied to\nClitomachean radical skepticism. Scholarship on Cicero, our best\nsource for the defense of argument on either side on educational\ngrounds, has increasingly defended radically skeptical interpretations\nof some of his dialogues (Brittain 2016: Cappello 2019; Wynne 2018\n& 2021), and Cicero himself associates it with Arcesilaus and\nCarneades (see On Divination 2.150, Tusculan\nDisputations 5.11 & 5.83). It may seem that radical skeptics\nwould not have justified argument on either side for educational\nreasons because they argue for purely destructive ends. But one may\nthink that radical skepticism can ground a Socratic interest in\nothers’ training in dialectic out of a hypothetical acceptance\nof rational norms (see Brittain 2005 [2008]). If this is right, then\nPhilo in the Roman Books had further cause for identifying its\ncritical method as the defining mark of the Academy. \nOur knowledge of Philo’s work in ethics comes almost entirely\nfrom an extended summary of an introductory book or lecture preserved\nwithout any context in an anthology (Stobaeus Anthology 2.7).\nThe summary is puzzling because it presents a picture of Philonian\nethics that seems too dogmatic, and too ordinary, for an Academic,\neven at the time of the Roman Books. The work presents a method for\nteaching ethics in terms of an analogy between philosophy and\nmedicine. This yields a division of ethical teaching into three parts:\na protreptic stage (showing the need for philosophical guidance), a\ntherapeutic stage (adjusting the student’s evaluative concepts),\nand a preservative stage (outlining the life-styles and political\narrangements that promote or maintain happiness by reinforcing these\nadjusted concepts). This is intriguing as an example of the way in\nwhich late Hellenistic philosophers approached the teaching of\npractical ethics (see Annas 1993: 95–96. But it does not look\ninnovative. The analogy between medicine and philosophy is a standard\none in Plato and in Hellenistic ethics. The focus on practical rules\nand the application of technical divisions and sub-divisions is\nderived from the Stoic tradition. And its theoretical claims—for\ninstance, that wisdom or knowledge is necessary for virtue, and that\nvirtue promotes the goal of happiness—do not identify it as an\nexception to the mainstream tradition of weaker or stronger\n“intellectualist” and “eudaemonist” virtue\nethics. In these respects, the summary suggests that Philo’s\nethics was largely unaffected by the wide-ranging and penetrating\ncriticisms of Hellenistic ethics by his Academic predecessors, and\nespecially by Carneades (examined in Algra 1997). \nBut there is reason to think that the summary—which was probably\nwritten five hundred years after Philo’s work—gives a\nmisleading picture of Philonian ethics by not informing us directly of\nthe methods it used to enable and secure the possession of happiness.\nIt is perhaps natural to assume that his methods were the standard\ndogmatic ones. Two aspects of the wider context omitted by the\nexcerptor, however, suggest that Philo’s ethics were in fact\nbased on the Academic method of argument on either side. First, we\nknow that the mitigated skeptics had already come to see their method\nof arguing for and against ethical theses as a way of\nteaching ethics that allowed students to evaluate which views\nwere more persuasive, i.e., had better rational grounds (see\n section 4).\n This is clearest in the case of Philo’s colleague Charmadas in\nCicero On the Orator 1.83–93. It is confirmed by the\ncriticisms of mitigated skepticism from Aenesidemus in Photius\nLibrary 212 170a and Sextus PH 1.226. Secondly, we\nknow that Philo had developed a way to popularize the Academic method\nby incorporating it into a technical system of rhetoric (see Cicero\nOn the Orator 3.110–118 and Tusculan\nDisputations 2.9). But since the function of this system was to\nprovide students with forensic techniques for arguing about moral\nissues, and given that teaching rhetoric in any form was a significant\ndeparture for an Academic philosopher, this development must have had\nsome connection to Philo’s ethical views (see Reinhardt 2000 and\nBrittain 2001). \nWhen the summary is read with this wider context in mind, three\napparently minor points stand out. First, the therapeutic stage,\ndealing with the students’ fundamental conceptions of value, is\ndescribed as the effort to replace “falsely acquired\nbeliefs” with ones “in a healthy state”, rather than\njust false with true beliefs (Stobaeus Anthology 2.7 p.\n40.18–20). Secondly, the preservative stage, concerned with the\nlifestyles that promote or secure happiness, is framed as an\ninvestigation of a set of questions that correspond precisely\nwith the questions dealt with by argument on either side in\nPhilo’s rhetoric (ibid. p. 41.7–14). And, thirdly, that\nkind of general investigation is explicitly distinguished from the\nprovision of straightforwardly prescriptive advice about how\nto behave, which is regarded as a temporary fix for busy people (ibid.\np. 41.16–25). These points can be explained in various ways. But\ngiven the wider context, they suggest that the summary has obscured\nthe central point about Philo’s ethics: its method of teaching\nwas not dogmatic, but the Academic one of argument on either side. \nIf this is right, the summary’s apparent ordinariness and\ndogmatic structure reflect only Philo’s systematic approach to\nethical topics, not its methods or results: Philo did not propose a\ndogmatic ethics, but rather a systematic technique for structuring\nstudents’ moral values into a coherent way of life through their\nrational evaluation of arguments on either side. A philosophical\napproach to ethics of this kind allows students to use their ethical\nintuitions—the knowledge provided by their own\nexperience—to revise and structure their conceptions of value,\nand, on that basis, critically evaluate their general social and\npolitical roles, and select the appropriate actions in a particular\nsituation. An approach of this sort perhaps no longer seems striking\nor innovative, but if Philo adopted it in the early 80s BCE, it\npresented no less a challenge to Hellenistic ethics than his Roman\nBooks did to epistemology. Two reasons to think that Philo did adopt\nthis approach are, first, that it yields a conception of ethical\nknowledge that fits the epistemology of the Roman Books—a\nPhilonian rational agent will have the sort of wisdom and happiness\nthat is available to ordinary people, i.e., something quite unlike the\nillusory promise of inerrant knowledge and moral perfection promised\nby the Stoics. And, secondly, Philo’s student Cicero may have\nadopted something like a mitigatedly skeptical version of this\napproach both in his personal life (see Griffin 1989) and in his\nphilosophical works on ethics (see Schofield 2002). \nOn this reconstruction of his work, Philo eventually abandoned both\nradical and mitigated skepticism for a form of fallibilism that he\ndescribed as the basis of the Academic tradition. His promotion of\nAcademic philosophy as open-ended critical inquiry had some impact on\nthe work of Cicero, Plutarch, Favorinus and Augustine, but his radical\ninnovations in epistemology and ethics sank almost without trace. The\nskeptical tradition survived in the form of Pyrrhonism, but the\nAcademy did not. Like any interpretation of Philo’s\nphilosophical development, this reconstruction is speculative in some\nrespects. But much of it can be confirmed or disconfirmed by further\nwork on ancient skepticism, and especially its Latin tradition, which\nremains an open field for research.","contact.mail":"pio3@cornell.edu","contact.domain":"cornell.edu"}]
