To this end, sitting\nmeditation called “za-zen” is employed as a\nfoundational method of prāxis across the different\nschools of this Buddha-Way—which is not an ideology, but a way\nof living. Through za-zen the Zen practitioner attempts to\nembody non-discriminatory wisdom vis-à-vis the\nmeditational experience known as “satori”\n(enlightenment). A process of discovering wisdom culminates, among other things, in the\nexperiential apprehension of the equality of all thing-events.\n\n\nThe most distinguishing feature of this school of the Buddha-Way is\nits contention that wisdom, accompanied by compassion, is expressed in\nthe everyday lifeworld when associating with one’s self, other\npeople, and nature. The everyday lifeworld for most\npeople is an evanescent transforming stage in which living is\nconsumed, philosophically speaking, by an either-or, ego-logical,\ndualistic paradigm of thinking with its attendant psychological states\nsuch as stress and anxiety. Zen demands an overcoming of this paradigm\nin practice by achieving a holistic and nondualistic perspective in\ncognition, so that the Zen practitioner can celebrate, with stillness\nof mind, a life directed toward the concrete thing-events of\neveryday life and nature. For this reason, the Zen practitioner is\nrequired to embody freedom expressive of the original human nature,\ncalled “buddha-nature.”\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, Zen cherishes simplicity and straightforwardness\nin grasping reality and acting on it “here and now,” for\nit believes that a thing-event that is immediately presencing\nbefore one’s eyes or under one’s foot is no other than an\nexpression of suchness. In other words the thing-event is disclosing\nits primordial mode of being such that it is as it is. It\nalso understands a specificity of the thing-event to be a recapitulation\nof the whole; parts and the whole are to be lived in an inseparable\nrelationship through an exercise of nondiscriminatory wisdom, without\nprioritizing the visible over the invisible, the explicit over the\nimplicit, or vice versa.\n\n\n\nAs such, Zen maintains a stance of “not one” and\n“not two,” that is “a positionless position,”\nwhere “not two” means negating the dualistic stance that\ndivides the whole into two parts, while “not one” means\nnegating the nondualistic stance occurring when the Zen practitioner\ndwells in the whole as one, while suspending judgment in\nmeditation. The free, bilateral movement between “not one” and\n“not two” characterizes Zen’s achievement of a\npersonhood with a\nthird perspective that cannot, however, be confined to either\ndualism or non-dualism, neither “not one” nor “not\ntwo”. \n\nThe designation of this school of the Buddha-Way as Zen, which means\nsitting meditation, is derived from a transliteration of the Chinese\nword Chán. Because the Chinese term is in turn a\ntransliteration of the Sanskrit term dhyāna, however,\nZen owes its historical origin to early Indian Buddhism, where a\ndeepened state of meditation, called samādhi, was\nsingled out as one of the three components of study a Buddhist was\nrequired to master, the other two being an observation of ethical\nprecepts (sīla) and an embodiment of nondiscriminatory\nwisdom (prajñā). Meditation was\npicked as the name for this school because\nthe historical Buddha achieved enlightenment\n(nirvāna) through the practice of meditation. In the\ncontext of Zen Buddhism, the perfection of nondiscriminatory wisdom\n(Jpn.: hannya haramitsu; Skrt.:\nprajñāpāramitā) designates\npractical, experiential knowledge. Only secondarily and\nderivatively does it mean theoretical, intellectual knowledge. This\nis, Zen explains, because theoretical knowledge is a form of\n“language game” (Jpn.: keron;\nSkrt.: prapañca), i.e., discrimination through the use\nof language, constructed as it is at least in part on\ndistinction-making. Zen believes that theoretical\nreference ultimately carries no existential meaning for\nemancipating a human being from his or her predicaments, for it\nmaintains that discriminatory knowledge of any kind is\ndelusory/illusory in nature. To this effect it holds that it is\nthrough a practical transformation of the psychophysiological\nconstitution of one’s being that one prepares for embodying\nnondiscriminatory wisdom. This preparation involves the training of\nthe whole person and is called “self-cultivation”\n(shugyō) in Japanese. It is a practical method of\ncorrecting the modality of one’s mind by correcting the modality\nof one’s body, in which practice (prāxis) is given\nprecedence over theory (theōria) (Yuasa, 1987). \nThere are basically two methods utilized in meditation practice in Zen\nBuddhism to assist the practitioner to reach the above-mentioned\ngoals, together with a simple breathing exercise known as\n“observation of breath count” (sūsokukan);\none is the kōan method and the other is called\n“just sitting” (shikan taza), a form of\n“single act samādhi.” For example, the\nformer is employed mainly by the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism, while\nthe latter by the Sōtō school; they are the two main schools\nof this form of the Buddha-Way still flourishing today in Japan. In\nthe Rinzai school, the kōan method is devised to assist\nthe practitioner to become a “Zen person” (Kasulis, 1981)\nwho fully embodies both wisdom and compassion. A kōan is\nformulated like a riddle or puzzle and is designed in such a way that\nintellectual reasoning alone cannot solve it without breaking through\nthe barrier of ego-consciousness by driving it to its limit. This is,\nZen believes, because ego-consciousness is fortified by the shield of\na dualistic conceptual paradigm with all its attendant presuppositions\nand conditions. The ego-consciousness of a given cultural and\nhistorical milieu accepts that paradigm to be true in order to live a\nlife anchored in the everyday standpoint.  \nAccording to Hakuin (1685–1768), who systematized\nkōans, there are formally seventeen hundred cases of\nkōans, and if sub-questions are added to them, a total\nnumber of cases comprising the system would be roughly three thousand.\nThe Zen practitioner of the Rinzai school is required to pass them all\nin a private consultation with a Zen master who checks the\npractitioner’s state of mind before he or she is granted a seal\nof transmission. This transmission is said to occur “only from a\nBuddha to a[nother] Buddha” (yuibutsu yobutsu). \nKōans are accordingly grouped into five categories in a\nmost fully developed system: the first group is designed for reaching\nli (suchness) (richi) or the body of truth\n(hosshin), i.e., an enlightenment experience; the second\ngroup for a linguistic articulation (gensen) of meditational\nexperiences in order to master the skillful use of language; the third\ngroup for those kōans truly difficult to pass\n(nantō); the fourth group for the practitioner to make\nan insight of kōan experiences pertinent to daily life\n(kikan) in order to embody a middle-way in which the\npractitioner won’t be steeped either in the state of meditation or the\nactivity of daily life; and the fifth group for going beyond the state\nof buddhahood by erasing all traces of enlightenment in order to\nachieve a traceless enlightenment (kōjō). \n\nThe Rinzai school summarizes this process of self-cultivation in four\nmottoes: “being a special transmission outside of the\nscriptures,” “having no dependence on words and letters,”\n“pointing directly into [one’s] human mind,” and\n“seeing into [one’s] nature to become a buddha.” (See,\nfor examples, The Gateless Gate and The Blue Cliff\nRecord.) While the first two phrases point to the fact of\ndiscovering an extra-linguistic reality that naturally opens up in\nmeditational experience and of articulating it linguistically in the\n“best” way according to the capacity of an individual\npractitioner, the last two phrases indicate a concretization of the\noriginal or inherent enlightenment (hongaku) in the Zen practitioner,\nwhere the original enlightenment means that human beings are innately\nendowed with a possibility of becoming a Buddha. \nOn the other hand, the Sōtō school, of which Dōgen\n(1200–54) is the founder, does not rely on an elaborate\nkōan system to learn to become a Zen person, but instead\nfollows a method called “just sitting” (shikan\ntaza). It refers to a single-minded, diligent practice where the\nqualifying term “just” means the practice of meditation\nwithout any intervention of ego-logical interest, concern, or desire,\nso that the practice remains undefiled. This is a method of meditation\npredicated on the belief that the Zen practitioner engages in the\npractice in the midst of the original enlightenment. Or to\ncharacterize it by using Dōgen’s phrase, it is a method of\n“practice-realization.” By hyphenating practice and\nrealization, the following implications are suggested: meditation is\nnot a means to an end, i.e., a means to realization, and thereby\nDōgen closes a dualistic gap, for example, between potentiality\nand actuality, between before and after. Accordingly, he collapses the\ndistinction between “acquired enlightenment”\n(shikaku) and “original enlightenment,”\n(hongaku) where the “acquired” enlightenment\nmeans an enlightenment that is realized through the practice of\nmeditation as a means. With this collapsing, the Sōtō School\nholds that practice and realization are non-dual in relation to each\nother; they are “not two.” \nAccording to the Sōtō school, the meditational practice,\nwhen it is seen as a process of discovery, is a deepening process of\nbecoming aware of the original enlightenment with an expansion of its\ncorresponding experiential correlates and horizons, and it is for this\nreason called the school of “gradual enlightenment” or\n“silent illumination.” On the other hand, the Rinzai\nschool is called the school of “sudden enlightenment,”\nbecause it does not recognize a process leading to enlightenment\n(satori) as something worthy of a special attention; what\ncounts is an experience of satori only. Even though there is\nthe above difference in approach between Rinzai and Sōtō\nschools, the outcome is the same for both insofar as the embodiment of\nwisdom and compassion is concerned. This is because they both follow\nthe same practice of sitting meditation. Whatever differences there\nare between the practitioners of the two schools in regard to the\nlinguistic articulation of their meditational experience, they arise\nfrom individual practitioners’ personalities, dispositions,\nintellectual capacities, and/or linguistic abilities. \nWhen one engages in Zen meditation, Zen recommends that its\npractitioner follow a three-step procedure: adjusting one’s body,\nbreathing and mind. The practitioner follows these adjustments in the\norder mentioned when he or she begins. When concluding a sitting\nsession, the procedure is reversed so that he or she can return to an\neveryday standpoint. We now briefly explain these three steps in\nthe order mentioned. \nGenerally speaking, the adjustment of the body means to prepare\noneself (one’s mind-body) in such a way that one can achieve an\noptimal state of being free. To do so, the practitioner needs to have\na proper diet, engage in appropriate physical exercise, and avoid\nforming habits contrary to nurturing a healthy mind-body condition.\nSpecifically, however, when Zen mentions the adjustment of the body,\nit has in mind seated meditation postures. There are two postures\nwhich Zen recognizes: the lotus-posture and the half-lotus posture. A\nlong Zen tradition takes them to be effective for stilling the mind\nand dissolving various psychological complexes and psychosomatic\ndisorders. However, if a lay practitioner cannot at first assume these\npostures, they can be substituted initially by sitting on a chair with\nthe spine straight, as it can bring about a similar effect. The\nadjustment of the body is necessary for the practitioner in order to\nexperience the practical benefits of doing meditation. \nThe benefits of Zen meditation are closely tied to the practice of\nbreathing. Generally speaking, Zen doesn’t recommend any\ncomplicated, strenuous breathing exercises as in Yoga. Zen’s\nbreathing exercise is called “observation of breath count”\n(sūsokukan). In this exercise, the practitioner counts\nan in-coming breath and an out-going breath. Before counting the\nbreath, the practitioner breathes in through the nostrils and breathes\nout through the mouth a couple of times. Then one starts counting\nbreaths, but this time breathing in through the nostrils and breathing\nout through the nostrils. The breath count is performed while\nperforming an abdominal breathing: one brings in air all the way down\nto the lower abdomen, and breathes out from there. This exercise has\nthe effect of infusing one’s mind-body with fresh life-energy\nand expelling a negative toxic energy out of the practitioner’s\nsystem. For this reason, it must be done in a place where there is\nample ventilation. A key to performing breathing exercises\nsuccessfully is just to observe the in-coming and out-going\nbreath. \nThough these are simple instructions, they are difficult to execute\nbecause the neophyte tends to become distracted. Present concerns,\nworries, fears, and past memories often surface. Zen calls them\n“wandering thoughts,” which refers to any mental object\nthat prevents the practitioner from concentrating. If one wants to\nmake progress in meditation, this is one of the first things that the\npractitioner must learn to overcome. \nWe now turn to the psycho-physiological meaning of the breathing\nexercise. Ordinarily, we breathe sixteen to seventeen times per\nminute, which we do unconsciously or involuntarily. This is because\nunder ordinary circumstances, breathing is controlled by the autonomic\nnervous system. Neurophysiologically, the center where breathing is\ncontrolled is found in the hypothalamus, in the mid-brain. The\nautonomic nervous system is so-called because it functions\nindependently of our will. Zen breathing is a shift from unconscious,\ninvoluntary breathing to conscious, voluntary breathing. This means\nthat Zen meditation is a way of regulating the unconscious-autonomic\norder of our being. Psychologically, counting the breath trains the\nunconscious mind and neurophysiologically, it trains the involuntary\nactivity of the nerves that control the function of the various\nvisceral organs. Here we find a reason why Zen recommends abdominal\nbreathing. Nerves are bundled in the upper part of the abdominal\ncavity, and the abdominal breathing exercise stimulates this\nbundle. As it does so, parasympathetic nerves still the mind. \nThis point is significant in learning to control emotion. Ordinarily,\nwe are told to control our emotion by exercising our will. This is,\nfor example, what Kant recommends. This method works to a certain\nextent, but we expend our energy unnecessarily in exercising our\nwill. Think of a situation where one tries to submerge a ball in\nwater. When the size of the ball is relatively small, this can be\naccomplished with little effort. But as the size of the ball becomes\nlarger, it becomes increasingly difficult. Analogously, a lot\nof psychic energy is required to suppress one’s deeper\nemotions. There comes a time then when one can no longer hold them\ndown. Consequently, one may end up exploding in various ways, ranging\nfrom personal fits to violent social crimes. If we observe a person in\nan angry state, we will notice that such a person’s breathing\npattern and rhythm is shallow, rough, and irregular. \nOn the other hand, if we observe a person in a peaceful state, the breathing is\ndeep, smooth, slow, and rhythmical. These examples show that there is a\nstrong correlation between the pattern and the rhythm of breathing and\na person’s emotional state, or more generally, state of mind.\nZen breathing has a way of naturally heightening the positive\ncorrelation between the activity of the autonomic nervous system and\nemotion. Neurophysiologically, it happens that the center\nwhere breathing is regulated and the region where emotion is generated\ncoincide. This means that the conscious breathing\npsychologically affects the pattern of how one generates emotion, and\nat the same time it also has a neurophysiological effect on how the\nautonomous activity of the unconscious is regulated. We will now move\non to the third step involved in meditation. \nOnce the bodily posture and the breathing are adjusted, the\npractitioner next learns to adjust the mind. This means that the\npractitioner consciously moves to enter a state of meditation. In so\ndoing, the practitioner learns to disengage him- or herself from the\nconcerns of daily life. That is to say, one tries to stop the\noperation of the conscious mind. However, if one tries to stop the mind by\nusing one’s mind, the mind which is trying to stop itself is\nstill operative. In other words, it is practically impossible to stop\nthe mind by using the mind. Instead, Zen tries to accomplish this by\nthe immobile bodily posture and the breathing exercise. In this\nconnection, it will be informative to know how the practitioner\nexperiences breathing as he or she deepens meditation. \nWe can identify three basic stages: initially\nthe practitioner can hear the audible sound of the in-coming and\nout-going breaths. This is rough and “gross” breathing.\nThis is followed by the second stage in which he or she can feel the\npathway of the in-coming and out-going breaths. Breathing at this\npoint becomes “subtle” in that there will no longer be\naudible sound of the breaths but simply a stream of life-energy. In\nthe third stage there is no more feeling of the in-coming and\nout-going breaths. When this occurs, the practitioner can settle into\na deeper meditational state. Also, it is significant to note that as\nthe practitioner enters a deeper state of meditation, the interval\nbetween inhalation and exhalation is prolonged, i.e., the retention of\nbreath is prolonged, as the reduction of breathing activities\noccurs. \nMeditation trains one to sit face-to-face with one’s self, while\ncreating a psychological isolation from the external world. With this,\none enters into an internal world of psychē. As the\npractitioner attempts to enter the world of psychē,\nvarious things start surfacing in the field of the\npractitioner’s meditative awareness. These are mostly things of\nconcern that have occupied the practitioner in the history of his or\nher life, or things the practitioner has consciously suppressed for\nvarious reasons. Initially, the practitioner experiences recent\ndesires, anxieties, concerns, ideas, and images that have surfaced in\nhis or her daily life. A psychological reason that the practitioner\nexperiences these various things is due in part to the fact the\npractitioner has lowered the level of conscious activity, by assuming\nthe meditation posture, and doing the breathing exercise. This\nmechanism is the same as when one has a dream at night. When the level\nof consciousness is lowered, the suppressive power of\nego-consciousness weakens, and consequently the autonomous\nactivity of the unconscious begins to surface. \nHowever, these desires, images and ideas are distractions insofar as\nmeditation is concerned. This is because in meditation you must learn\nto focus your awareness on one thing. One must learn just to observe\nwithout getting involved in them. That is, one must learn to\ndis-identify oneself with them. In the process of deepening\nmeditation, one can roughly identify three distinct stages: the stage\nof concentration, the stage of meditation, and the stage of\nabsorption. In the stage of concentration, the practitioner\nconcentrates, for example on the lower abdomen, establishing\na dualistic relationship between the practitioner who is\nconcentrating and the lower abdomen that is the focus of\nconcentration. This dualistic relationship is broken gradually as the\npractitioner moves into the stage of meditation. The activity of the\nego-consciousness is gradually lessened, and the barriers it sets up for\nitself are gradually removed. When the practitioner enters the stage\nof absorption (samādhi), the dualistic framing of the mind\nwill be removed such that the mind starts structuring itself\nnon-dualistically. There will be no separation or distancing between\nan object of the mind and the activity of the mind itself.  \nAs the practitioner repeats this process over a long period of time,\nhe or she will come to experience a state in which no-thing appears.\nZen uses the phrase “no-mind” to designate this state.\nNo-mind does not mean a mindless state. Nor does it mean that there is\nno mind. It means that there is no conscious activity of the mind that\nis associated with ego-consciousness in the everyday standpoint. In\nother word, no-mind is a free mind that is not delimited by ideas,\ndesires, and images. No-mind is a state of mind in which there is\nneither a superimposition of ideas nor a psychological projection.\nThat is, no-mind is a practical transcendence from the everyday mind,\nwithout departing from the everydayness of the world. \nAs may be surmised from the foregoing explanation on Zen’s\nmethodological stance, it is perhaps best to understand Zen as an\nanti-philosophy if the term “philosophy” is taken to mean\nthe establishment of “the kingdom of reason.” That\nenterprise has been launched as an intellectual effort of the most\nbrilliant minds in Europe since the modern period to find new ways to\nground our conception of human nature, something beyond the\ntraditional Christian dogmas that had incorporated classic\nAristotelian and Platonic views. Since then, various Western\nphilosophers have attempted to capture human nature with this goal in\nmind by using ego-consciousness as a starting point as well as a\ndestination in philosophy. For example, human nature has been\ncharacterized in terms of ego-consciousness (Descartes), Reason,\nPersonality, Transcendental Subjectivity (Kant and Husserl), Life\n(Dilthey), Existence (Existential philosophers such as Kierkegaard,\nJaspers and Sartre) and Dasein (Heidegger). (See Yuasa 2003,\n160–61.) \nBy contrast, Zen’s stance of “anti-philosophy”\nmaintains among other things that reason in its discursive use is\nincapable of knowing and understanding in toto what reality\nis, for example, what human beings are and what their relation to\nnature is. For this reason, Zen contends that physical nature and\nhuman nature must be sought in an experiential dimension\npractically trans-descending, and hence transcending, the\nstandpoint of ego-consciousness. That is to say, it must go beyond\n“the one” and “the two,” as both of these\nstances are prone to generate a one-sided stance, and hence incomplete\nworld-view. Instead, they must be sought in the depths of one’s\npsychē and beyond. For example, Zen Master Seigen\n(Chin; Qīngyuáng, 660–740) expresses the process of\nself-cultivation to the effect that: “Before the practice,\nmountains are mountains, during the practice, mountains are not\nmountains, and after the realization, mountains are [truly] mountains\n[again].” In the meditational process of discovery then, Zen\nmoves from an ordinary, commonsensical standpoint to an extraordinary\nstandpoint, and with this transformation returns to the everyday\nlifeworld, wherein no Aristotelian either-or logic is accepted as the\nstandard for knowing and understanding reality. As a result,\nparadoxes, contradictions, and even what appears to be utter nonsense\nabound in Zen literature. The kōan method mentioned\nabove exemplifies this point. To cite just one such example:\n“the river does not flow but the bridge does.” If one\nattempts to understand that by relying on an Aristotelian either-or logic\nas the standard for understanding, one will be under the\nimpression that this expression is nonsensical or meaningless. \nAs may be surmised, by relying on the above-mentioned methodological\nstance, Zen Buddhism has produced an understanding of\nreality—one’s own self, nature with life activities and\nhuman nature—quite different from those offered by Western\nphilosophy. Therefore, we can say that Zen is an anti-philosophy in\nthat it is not a systematization of knowledge built on the use of a\ndiscursive mode of reasoning anchored in the (alleged) certainty or\ntransparency of ego-consciousness, one that follows an epistemological\nparadigm built on an ego-logical, either-or, dualistic mode of\nknowing. Yet, it upholds something like a philosophy that\nsprings forth through a reflective restatement of the practice, though\nthis “upholding” must be understood with a proviso that it\nmaintains, as mentioned in the foregoing, a “positionless\nposition.” (Abe, 1989.) This is because Zen abhors\n“holding onto” anything, which Zen considers a case of\n“self-binding without a rope.” Such a self-binding would\ntrap the Zen practitioner into a mode of attachment that is the source\nof suffering and, consequently, would disrupt the sense of embodied\nfreedom it cherishes. \nAccordingly, Zen demands that the practitioner overcome the dualism\noperative in the everyday standpoint, which it speaks of by using the\nphrase “not two.” The use of the phrase “not\ntwo” expresses Zen’s proclivity to favor the simple and\nthe concrete, such that it is not expressed as a negation of\ndualism. This overcoming is an existential, practical\nproject, a goal for the Zen practitioner, although it is paradoxically\nstated as “if you face it, it goes away.” This is because\n“facing” presupposes a dualistic stance. “Two”\nin “not two” designates any “two” things\nappearing from within the everyday standpoint, especially when it is\ntaken to designate an absolute sense of reality. This standpoint, as\nmentioned in the foregoing, relies on the discursive mode of reasoning\nto understand reality, while presupposing an ego-consciousness as the\nstandard referential point. From this perspective for example, a\ndistinction between the outer and inner worlds emerges, using a\nsensory perception as the point of reference. One of the salient\ncharacteristics of this standpoint is that the world appears to be\ndualistic in nature, that is to say, it recognizes two (and\nby implication, many) things to be real. Zen questions this standpoint\nwhen it is used as the paradigm for daily living, including\nphilosophical thinking, for this standpoint accepts as its foundation\nan individual’s discrete “I” with a belief that\n“I” am self-contained and self-sufficient, and therefore\nam distinguished and isolated from other individuals and things of\nnature, “I” am “here” and things, including\nothers, are “over there,” creating both a psychological\nand physical distance between them. Epistemologically speaking, Zen\nobserves that this renders opaque, or at best translucent, the\nexperiential domains beyond the sensible world as well as\nego-consciousness, both either taken naturalistically or by means of\ntheoretical speculation. The inability to go beyond these experiential\ndomains occurs because ego-consciousness is physiologically rooted in\nthe body and psychologically in the unconscious. This points to a\nphilosophically important consequence. Namely, once the practitioner\naccepts this outer-inner dichotomy even provisionally, he or she is\nled to accept as true a host of other “two” things that\nare affirmed to be real, as is seen in pairs of opposites such as mind\nvs. body, I vs. others, love vs. hate, good\nvs. evil, and I vs. nature. \nLogically speaking, Zen explains that “two” things arise\nbecause the everyday standpoint stipulates the above-mention\nepistemological paradigm as the standard for cognizing the whole,\nhowever the whole may be construed (Nagatomo, 2000, 213–44).\nThis logic thinks it reasonable to divide the whole into two parts\nwhen knowing or understanding reality. That is, when this logic is\napplied to the whole, it compels the user of this logic to choose,\nreasonably in the mind of the user, one part, while disregarding the\nother part(s) as irrelevant or meaningless. It prioritizes one part\nat the expense of the other part(s), while celebrating the\nexclusion. In so doing, it looks to the explicit while\nbecoming oblivious to the fact that the implicit equally exists as a\nsupporting ground for the explicit, where the explicit is\nsomething “obvious” to the senses and the rational mind.\nIt champions one-sidedness in cognition and judgment as the supreme\nform of knowing and understanding reality. However, Zen thinks that\nthis prioritization, this exclusion, violates a cardinal principle of\nknowing, for knowledge of anything demands an understanding of the\nwhole. Either-or logic fails on this account. Moreover, it contends\nthat when this logic attempts to understand the whole, it\ntheoretically reduces the other to the one that is judged to\nbe true and/or real. For example, if one maintains that the mind is\nreal, one disregards the body as unreal, yielding an idealist\nposition. On the other hand, if one thinks the body is real, it\ndisposes of the mind in the same way, favoring materialism as true and\nreal, which is presupposed, for example, by natural science. Either\nposition commits itself to reductionism. Here, questioning this\npractice and the consequences it entails, Zen instead speaks of\nmind-body oneness, an holistic perspective, as it abhors\none-sidedness. However, it warns that as soon as “one” is\ncontrasted with “two” in a discourse, it is no longer\ngenuine and authentic, because once it is objectified linguistically\nor reflectively, it slips into being an idea, an abstraction. \nFrom the point of view of epistemology developed by modern European\nphilosophy, the “two things” are the subject who knows and\nthe object that is known. Zen finds that these two things impose on\nthe epistemological subject a structuring that is framed dualistically\nand either-or ego-logically, as mentioned in the foregoing.\nAccordingly, this structuring unknowingly frames things to appear\ndualistically and either-or ego-logically to the epistemological\nsubject, while extending the paradigm to itself for self-understanding\nas well as things other than itself in the same manner. Consequently,\nthe subject stands opposed either to the outer world (e.g.,\nnature) or to the inner world (the world of psychē), or\nboth, and hence it promotes an oppositional mode of thinking.\nMoreover, Zen notes that the subject cannot by definition become the\nobject or vice versa, for they are distanced from each other either\nreally or ideally. It depends on whether the “distance”\nand “opposition” occur in space-consciousness or in\ntime-consciousness; an object appears to be “out there”\nwith space-consciousness, while it appears to be “in here”\nas an immanent object in the field of consciousness in\ntime-consciousness. Suppose one applies this epistemological structure\nin knowing others, for example, one’s friend. When one attempts\nto know her from the everyday standpoint, one relies on the language\nshe speaks and her body language. Here one cannot know her in\ntoto, let alone the destiny of her life-history, because she is\nshielded from an observer by the spatial-temporal density of her\nbeing.  \nZen maintains that the situation created by assuming this\nepistemological paradigm is not ideal, or real, for that matter.\nHence, Zen says “not two.” “Not two” is in\npart a recommendation for experientially achieving oneness through the\npractice of meditation, informing the holder of the “two”\nof the narrow and limited scope of her/his understanding, where the\nidea of oneness may, for now, be conceived at many levels, starting\nwith the physical, the subtle, and the samādhic.\nGenerally speaking then, Zen takes “not two” to designate\na negation of any “two” things that are affirmed to be\nindividually real, in which the perspective that realizes the place or\ndomain where two things occur is ignored. The dualistic standpoint\nalso ignores the logical fact that any “two” things cannot\nbe individually one because for one to be, it must be\ndependent on, and interconnects with, the other one. An either-or\nlogic ignores this interdependence, in part because it operates within\na conceptual and linguistic space with the assumption that there is no\ntemporal change. This assumption enables a thinker to establish the\nlaw of identity, namely that A remains the same with itself, or\nidentical with itself. With this recommendation, Zen maintains that\nmind and body, I and others, I and nature ought to be\nexperienced as one by those who remain in the everyday standpoint. To\nexpress this idea, Zen states that “Heaven and Earth share the\nsame root, and I and the myriad things are one (-body).” It\ndemands an holistic perspective necessary to achieve\nknowledge that is genuine and authentic. Otherwise, Zen fears that the\npractitioner will fall into one-sidedness, in which the knowledge claim\nends up being partial, imbalanced, and even prejudiced. Dōgen\ncaptures this by stating: “When one side is illuminated, the\nother side remains in darkness.” To characterize the dualistic,\neither-or, ego-logical standpoint by borrowing Nietzsche’s\nphrase, Zen would say that it is “human, and all too\nhuman.”  \nCare must be exercised in understanding the meaning of\n“not” in the phrase “not two” however. Zen\ninsists that the “not” primarily refers to an existential,\npractical negation of the “I,” which the practitioner\nachieves by “up-rooting the ego-consciousness,” and in\nturn yields, by implication, a logical negation as well. This is\nbecause Zen thinks the practitioner cannot achieve this negation\nsimply by following either-or logic, or for that matter by following\nthe intellectual process of reasoning, because both logic and\nreasoning intrinsically involve two things, for example, the thinker\nand the thought. With either-or logic a mere logical negation involves\nan infinite regress in negating the “I”; one who negates\nthe “I” retains the affirmative act of holding\n“I” in the mind as that which negates. And when the\n“I” further attempts to negate this affirming act, there\nstill remains an “I” who negates it and the process goes\non ad infinitum. For this reason, Zen recommends the\npractitioner to “forget the ‘I” when engaging\noneself in any action, be it a mind-act, bodily-act, or speech-act, as\nis seen for example in both Dōgen and Takuan (1573–1645).\n \nTo recapitulate the idea of the Zen meaning of negation as expressed\nin “not two,” Zen sees its self-cultivation as involving a\nthoroughgoing negation of the “I” to the point that no\nproblem, either existential or psychological, entrenched in the\n“I” remains. Hence, we have Rinzai’s phrase:\n“if you becomes a master in any place, wherever you stand is\ntrue.” (Iriya, 1989, 70) Truth for Zen is not merely a matter of\nformulating or uttering a propositional statement, but rather\nembodying it by becoming, to use his phrase again, a\n“true person of no rank,” (ibid, 20) where\n“no rank” designates the freedom of standing beyond social\nor linguistic conventions such that a Zen person can use convention\nfreely. Equally important is Zen’s contention that both logical\nand intellectual methods are abstract, for they become\ndivorced from the actual reality of day-to-day existence. In other\nwords, in the eyes of Zen, these methods lack consideration for the\nconcreteness and immediacy of lived experience. This is because the\ntheoretical standpoint defines the human being who observes things of\nnature from the outside, which can be characterized, by using\nYuasa’s phrase, as a “being-outside-of-nature.”\nInstead, Zen maintains that the human being must be understood as a\nbeing rooted in nature. To use Yuasa’s phrase again, it is a\n“being-in-nature.” This point is well portrayed in\nZen’s landscape paintings wherein a human figure occupies the\nspace of a mere dot in a vast natural scenery (Yuasa, 2003,\n160–1). \nHow then does Zen articulate the experiential meaning of “not\ntwo”? Throughout its long history, which spans from the sixth\ncentury in China to the twenty-first century in Japan, Zen has\nproduced numerous ways of linguistically capturing a response to this\nquestion, depending on what “two” things are thematized in\nthe Zen dialogue (Zen mondō). As a textual study, these\ndialogues are a primary way for the non-practitioner to learn what\n“two” things are by studying a discourse that unfolds\nbetween a Zen master and his disciple. Moreover, this situation is\ncomplicated by the fact that a Zen master’s response is usually\ntailored to an individual disciple’s caliber. This is in keeping\nwith a general method of teaching in Buddhism, i.e., speaking\nto the caliber of a listener (taiki seppō). This\ncomplication is further compounded by the differences in the\npersonality of Zen masters. Hence, Zen’s responses to the above\nquestion are as varied and numerous as there are Zen masters. In spite\nof this situation, it is reasonably possible to provide a\nglimpse into the experiential meaning of “not\ntwo” by looking into a phrase that often appears in Zen\ndialogues. This phrase is “no-thought and no-image”\n(munen musō), whose experience points to practically\ngoing beyond “not one” and “not two.”  \nUpon hearing the phrase “no-thought and no-image,” one may\nwonder if there could be such a thing. To properly respond to this\nquestion, Zen thinks it important to determine whether it is posed\nwith a practical concern or a theoretical concern in mind. The\ndifference allows a Zen master to determine the ground out of which\nthis question is raised, for example, to determine if the inquirer is\nanchored in the everyday standpoint or in a meditational standpoint.\nIn the case of the former, for instance, Zen would respond by saying\nthat as long as the inquirer poses this question from within the\neveryday standpoint with a theoretical interest, relying on either-or\nlogic, the inquirer cannot understand the meaning of “no-thought\nand no-image,” as intended by Zen. This is because to formulate\nthe question, “Is there or is there not\nno-thought and no-image?” linguistically drives the inquiry into\na contradiction, for one cannot predicate “is” on\n“no-thought” or “no-image.” Only insofar as\n“no-thought” or “no-image” is treated as an\nidea in a linguistic space without consideration for its referent, can\none ask if “there is” or “there is not” such a\nthing as “no-thought.” In response, Zen maintains that\nwhen “there is” or “there is not” is\ntopicalized in its tradition, it is not the same as “there\nis” or “there is not” as understood from within the\neveryday standpoint. Zen claims that neither “no-thought”\nnor “no-image” can be linguistically or logically\napprehended from this standpoint.  \nWhy does Zen insist on this? Zen explains that both “there\nis” and “there is not” (or more generally\n“being” and “non-being”) are intellectually\nframed from within the everyday standpoint by accepting the\noppositional ontology where the meaning of “is”\nis predicated on the meaning of “is not,” and vice versa.\nTherefore, Zen maintains that to understand “no-thought”\nor “no-image” we need an experiential dimension that goes\nbeyond the oppositional thinking of the everyday standpoint.  \nZen condenses “no-thought and no-image” into a singular\nword “no” in keeping with its proclivity to favor the\nsimple, as this contraction allows Zen to expand the scope and the\nmeaning of “no-thought and no-image.” This\n“no,” for example, is made pivotal by Zen Master\nJoshū (Chin., Zhaozhōu; 778–897). It is usually\nrendered in English as “nothing” and has been presented to\nthe Western reader as if it is the central and cardinal\nconcept of Zen philosophy. At the risk of de-emphasizing other\nimportant aspects of Zen such as how it understands the living\nphenomena of nature, humanity‘s relation to them, and aesthetic\nsensitivity, we will here focus on the scope and meaning of this Zen\n“no” 無. \nThis “no” appears in a Zen dialogue between Joshū and\na monk, in which is thematized an issue of whether or not a dog has\nBuddha-nature. It reads as follows: A monk asks Joshū:\n“Does the dog have buddha-nature?” He replies:\n“No[thing].” The monk says: “All sentient beings\nhave buddha-nature. Why doesn’t the dog have it?”\nJoshū replies: “He has discrimination due to his\nkarma.” Joshū’s response of “no”\nto the monk’s question points to the latter’s inadequate,\nand hence also mistaken, understanding of being. However, as\narticulated in the Nirvānasūtra, Mahāyāna\nBuddhism, of which Zen is an offshoot, asserts that all sentient\nbeings have buddha-nature. With this understanding in mind, the monk\nasked the question, to which Joshū replied\n無 (“no”). His “no” points to the\nfact that the way the monk formulates his question regarding being is\npredicated on an either-or logical understanding or an\naffirmation-negation linguistic device. In so doing, the monk\nrelativizes Buddha-nature qua being, while contrasting and\nopposing it with non-being. Buddha-nature is not something that the\ndog can have or not have; Buddha-nature is not\nsomething contingent. Joshū’s “no” allows the\nmonk to return to the ground from which the idea of the\nBuddha-nature springs forth as an essential characterization of all\nbeings. As such, Joshū’s “no” points to a\ntranscendence of being and non-being. Insofar as Zen’s\n“no” is turned into an issue questioning the\nground of being, it is appropriate to understand it as\n“nothing,” and in fact as “absolutely\nnothing,” because the latter goes beyond the relative nothing\nthat is contrasted with being. \nAs Joshū’s “nothing” has been made a\nkōan, numerous Zen masters have used it to test a\nstudent’s progress in meditation. In such a case, a Zen master\nexpects a monk to come up with his or her original response by\nstipulating a condition: “I don’t expect you to answer\nthat the dog has buddha-nature nor that the dog does not have\nbuddha-nature.  Nor do I expect you to reply that the dog both has and\ndoes not have buddha-nature. Nor do I expect you to reply that the dog\nneither has nor does not have buddha-nature. How do you respond to\nthis?” This is a warning that a monk cannot rely on\nNāgārjuna’s tetralemma as an acceptable response,\nnamely the four possible ways of understanding thing-events insofar as\nlogic is concerned: “there is,” “there is\nnot,” “both ‘there is’ and ‘there is\nnot,’” and “neither ‘there is’ nor\n‘there is not.’” This master is admonishing that as\nlong as a monk’s response is framed from within the logic of the\neveryday use of language, no answer is forthcoming. Here the reader\ncan sense that the scope and the meaning of “no-thought and\nno-image” has been expanded to include the logical use of\nlanguage, not simply a rejection of oppositional thinking.  \nA further expansion of the scope and the meaning of “no”\ncan be found in an instruction Zen Master Daie (Chin.,\nDàhuì;1089–1163) gives to his students, though it\nis given via negativa—when they attempt to discover a\nresponse to Joshū’s “nothing” (Yanagita, 1974,\n181–2). Prefacing his remark that “this one word [i.e.,\n‘no(-thing)’] is a cane that shatters numerous [instances\nof] erroneous knowledge and perception,” Daie instructs the\nstudents not to take “no[thing]” in the context of being\nor nonbeing by applying either-or logic. An appeal to discriminatory\nthinking based on the standpoint of [ego-]consciousness is of no use\neither. It is also unacceptable to appeal to bodily action, let alone\nto engage in a mere verbal exchange. Not even a metaphysical response\nwill do either, for Daie states: “Do not throw it out into an\nempty-void where there is nothing. Do not swallow it where something\nis generated.” To seek an answer in a text is also out of the\nquestion. Daie demands that the practitioner come up with his/her own\noriginal answer. \nWhat is evident in the above instructions is that the Zen practitioner\nmust tackle this “no[thing]” by mobilizing the\nwhole of his or her person in order to delve into the\nground of his or her personhood, where the\n“whole” in question involves both the\nmind and the body, both the consciousness and the unconscious. This\nis, no doubt, an existential challenge to Zen practitioners, and so\nthey make an all-out effort, staking life and death, because it\nguarantees them an embodiment of truth and freedom. In this context,\nZen metaphorically speaks of reaching the whole as “kicking\nthrough the bottom of a bucket” to designate the ground of a\nperson, which Zen understands to be bottomless. That is, it\nunderstands this ground to have “no” bottom,\ni.e., it is a bottomless ground. To avoid the danger of interpreting\nthis ground nihilistically or relativisitically, the modern Japanese\nthinker, Nishida Kitarō (1870–1945) adds that it is\nabsolutely nothing, where “absolutely” means\ncutting off all pairs of polar opposites. (See the entry on\n Nishida Kitarō.) \nThe experiential dimension in which Zen’s “nothing”\nbecomes understandable refers to a quiescent state of meditation in\nwhich is arrested the activity of an individual practitioner’s\nego-consciousness that functions in a close correlation with his or\nher body. Upon reaching such a meditational state, the Zen\npractitioner comes to experience an event generally known as\n“seeing into one’s nature” (kenshō),\nan initial satori experience. Although this phrase may on the\nsurface suggest a dualistic state, namely that there is something that\nis called “nature,” which the Zen practitioner comes to\nsee as an object. This interpretation occurs because\n“seeing”is understood to be an intentional activity of the\npractitioner. However, this “seeing” has a sense of\nbecoming visible such that “one’s own nature” emerges in\nthe meditative awareness when the activity of ego-consciousness is\narrested. Once this experience occurs, the practitioner gradually\nturns the seeing into one’s nature (according to the interpretation\nvis-à-vis the acquired enlightenment), or the\npractitioner realizes that one’s nature is seeing (according to the\ninterpretation vis-à-vis the original enlightenment).\nThe Zen tradition interprets “nature” to be\n“buddha-nature,” i.e., the possibility to be awakened from\nfundamental ignorance. That is to say, to become a Buddha, and the way\nof its being is designated by the term tathatā, suchness\nor a thing-event’s being such that it is showing its\nprimordial mode of being. When this aspect of knowledge is emphasized,\nZen calls it “original” or “natural”\nknowledge. In this connection, it contends that the\n“seeing” is “not two,” i.e., it is\nnon-dualistic in nature.  \nTo illustrate an experiential basis for the above observation, we may\ncite another example, namely Dōgen’s enlightenment\nexperience. This will aid the reader to catch a glimpse of an\nexperiential meaning of “not two,” for it is descriptive\nof the experience itself. He expresses it as “dropping off the\nbody and the mind” (shinjin datsuraku). (In order to\nget an idea of this experience from a contemporary point-of-view, or\nfrom outside of Zen tradition, one may also consider out-of-body\nexperiences.) The experience of “dropping off the body and the\nmind” informs us that the dualistic relationship between the\nmind and the body has disappeared in meditational awareness\nand by implication “I” and others, and “I” and\nnature. Hence they are “not two.” If the distinction has\ndisappeared, it implies that the Zen practitioner is thrown into a\nnon-dualistic domain of experience. It points to a practical\ntranscendence from the everyday either-or, ego-logical, dualistic\nstandpoint.  \nIn light of the outer-inner distinction Zen interprets the\nnon-dualistic experience to mean that the distinction has been\nepistemologically collapsed, as it arises in such a way to respond to\nthe dualistic perspective from which the outer and the inner\nworlds appeared. It understands this collapsing of the distinction\nthen to be the meaning of “not two,” from which an\nholistic perspective emerges. Conceptually, Zen takes this\nholistic perspective to mean the de-substantialization and\nde-ontologization of any two polar concepts, such as one and many,\nbeing and non-being, universal and particular, absolute and relative,\ntranscendence and immanence, and birth and death. Zen’s\nobservation is that each of the polar terms is non-dualistically\nrelated to each of the other polar terms such that they are connected\nwith, interdependent on, and relative to, each other for their being\nand meaning. They are thrown into a holistic context of an\ninterdependent causal series. And for this series to be operative, Zen\nmaintains, following Nāgārjuna, that each of these terms\nthat enters the relationship is empty of self-nature, where\nself-nature means a power to generate itself on its own without\ndependence on anything. For if thing-events designated by these terms\nare endowed with self-nature, they cannot enter into the series; what\nenters such a series is only an accidental attribute or\nproperty. According to the substantialistic or essentialistic\nontology, nothing can really change. For example, criminals who want\nto correct their criminal behavior cannot change themselves if being a\ncriminal is the essential characterization of their being. This would\npose an insurmountable challenge, if not impossibility, to a\ncorrection officer at a prison. Or, for that matter, anyone who wants\nto correct one’s own psychological characteristic or tendency,\nparticularly if it happens to be pathological, cannot succeed in such\nself-correction if it is an essential characterization of one’s\nbeing.  \nIn order to give a still more concrete sense of what Zen-seeing is\nlike, we now return to the question of how Zen understands the\nexperiential meaning of “seeing into one’s nature.”\nZen’s contention is that the bottomless ground is that which\nnon-dualistically “sees” when the practitioner experiences\nthe state of nothing (or no-thought and no-image). How then does Zen\narticulate this “seeing”? This question points to an\nexamination of the epistemic structure of how knowledge operates in\nZen experience. For this purpose, the following Zen dialogue between\nJinne and Chōsetsu concerning “no-thought” is\nilluminating. Although it is lengthy, we quote it in full in order\nto provide a sense of how a Zen dialogue unfolds: \nThe disciple asks: Then what is it [i.e., no-thought]? \nThe master replies: It is nothing like “what is.”\nTherefore, we can not explain “no-thought.” The reason why\nI am speaking about it now is because you have asked about it. If you\nhadn’t asked about it, there would be no need to explain it. Suppose\nthat there is a clear, transparent mirror. If it does not face a\nthing, no image is reflected in it. To say that it mirrors an image\nmeans that because it faces something, it just mirrors its image. \nThe disciple asks: If it does not face any thing, is there or is there\nnot a reflection in the mirror? \nThe master replies: That the mirror reflects a thing means that it\nalways mirrors regardless of whether it is facing or not facing a\nthing. \nThe disciple asks: If there is no image and since you do not give an\nexplanation, how can all beings and nonbeings become an issue? Now\nwhen you say that it always mirrors, how does it mirror? \nThe master replies: When I say that the mirror always mirrors, it is\nbecause a clear, transparent mirror possesses an original nature as\nits essential activity of always mirroring things. Analogously,\npeople’s mind is originally undefiled, and naturally possesses a\nsuperb light of wisdom that illuminates the perfect world of\nnirvāna. \nThe disciple asks: Insofar as people’s minds are originally like\nthat, when do people get it? \nThe master replies: It just sees nothing. \nThe disciple asks: When it is nothing, what can it see? \nThe master replies: Seeing is not like something you can call a\nthing. \nThe disciple asks: If it is not like anything one can call a thing,\nwhat does it see? \nThe master replies: it sees no-thing. That is the true seeing. It\nalways sees.\n(Yanagita, 1974, 132–3.) \nUnlike most Zen dialogues that are often enigmatic and puzzling to\npeople outside the tradition, this dialogue provides an explanation\nthat indicates what “seeing” is like in Zen\nexperience. This “seeing” is said to be “seeing\nnothing or no-thing,” and Jinne speaks of it by appealing to the\nanalogy of a mirror, although he makes a disclaimer that it cannot\nadequately be explained in words. To get a glimpse of what he means by\n“seeing,” it is helpful to take note of the following\npoints regarding this analogy. Jinne conceives of a mirror in terms of\ntwo modalities: the mirror in and of itself and the mirror as it\nengages an object other than itself. It is important to keep in mind\nthat both are understood in light of their activity. He characterizes\nthe “original nature” of the mirror in and of itself as\nbeing “clear, transparent” (or “undefiled”),\nwherein it is said to always mirror.  “Original”\nmeans that it is not contingent on experience, while\n“always” refers to the mirror’s ceaseless activity\nof mirroring. Whether “there is” or “there is\nnot” a specific object to mirror is a contingent matter for the\nmirror in and of itself. What makes a mirror what it\nis is its activity of always mirroring, and when considered\nin and of itself, it possesses no specific image to mirror. There is\nno characteristic to it and hence no image appearing in it, i.e.,\n“no-thought” or “no-image.” This is the\nmeaning of “no-thing or nothing” in the phrase\n“seeing no-thing or nothing.” In other\nwords, the mirror is turned into nothing, or to use the earlier\nphrase, the bottomless ground is nothing except, epistemologically\nspeaking, its capacity to mirror, and even this capacity is rendered\n“nothing” when it is in no use.  \nZen explains the fact that the mirror “just sees\nno-thing or nothing” when its act of seeing is mobilized in\n“facing” a thing. The adverb “just” is\ncrucial. “Just” here means without discrimination, without\nsuperimposition, without projection, or in short, without positing an\nego-consciousness as that which sees. In phenomenological terms, there\nis no thetic positing in this kind of seeing. Zen maintains that these\ncharacterizations obtain because the Zen practitioner “kicked\nthrough the bottom of the bucket,” a practical transcendence. In\nother words, Zen’s contention is that there is no\ndetermination whatsoever in the mirror’s activity of\n“just seeing.” That there is no determination means to Zen\nthat because the bottomless ground is nothing, it does not impose form\non things that are mirrored. When these qualifications are taken\ntogether, Zen interprets “just seeing no-thing or nothing”\nto mean seeing or mirroring things without discrimination, that is,\nwith a sense of equality. When a mirror, for example,\nreflects an image of a beautiful object, it does not make any\ndiscriminatory value judgment that it is beautiful. And neither does\nit make any discriminatory value judgment when it mirrors an ugly\nobject. It mirrors thing-events as they are. That is, the mirror does\nnot take any stance of likes and dislikes; it does not take a stance\nof “for” or “against.” It is non-egological in\nmirroring each thing equally. \n\n Moreover, Zen observes that the nature\nof the mirror is such that it does not change due to the kind of\nobject it mirrors. For example, it does not increase or decrease in\nsize in virtue of the fact that it mirrors an object. (Bankei, for\nexample, expresses it as the “unborn.”) It remains as it\nis in its original nature of always mirroring, which highlights the\nfact that it is clear and transparent. Because equality is the\ncharacteristic of this seeing, Zen speaks of the activity of this\nseeing as nondiscriminatory. Yet, because an object is\nmirrored as object, whether beautiful or ugly, Zen considers the act\nof mirroring to be a “discernment.” Therefore, Zen\ncharacterizes the “seeing” in “seeing no-thing or\nnothing” in its act-aspect as a discernment\nvis-à-vis nondiscrimination (mubunbetsu\nno funbetsu). This, Jinne says, is “true seeing,”\nwhich is non-discriminatory wisdom (prajñā).\nThrough this mirror analogy, Zen wants to point out what the minds of\npeople are like in their original nature and activity. Zen\nsummarizes all of the above characteristics of seeing by employing a\nsimple phrase: “motion in stillness”\n(seichū no dō). However, an objection may\nbe raised against Zen’s holistic, non-dualistic\n“seeing” or “mirroring,” namely, the objection\nthat if there is something that is mirrored, does that not still imply\na dualistic epistemological structure? Zen would respond that this\nobjection ignores the fact that the ground of seeing is the bottomless\nground that is nothing. What appears against mirror\nqua nothing is just an object. In such a seeing, the object\nalone shines forth. Hence, it is characterized, to use\nNishida’s terminology, as “seeing without a seer.”\n(See the entry on \n The Kyoto School, Sect. 3.3.)\n Below, we will explore further the structure of how things appear in\nZen. \nAlthough it may sound paradoxical, Zen maintains that this ground is\nalso a fount of creativity. Because there is no determination\nin the ground, it is pregnant with many possibilities or meanings to\nbe realized. Zen maintains, via the influences from philosophical\nDaoism, that this creativity is in the same order as that of nature,\nfor the practitioner reaches the original source prior to the\ndistinction between the outer world and the inner world. (Hence, Zen\nunderstands, as was mentioned in the foregoing, the human being to be\n“a being-in-nature.”)  \nIt often uses the phrase “no-mind” (mushin) to\ngenerally designate the above experiential dimension. However, Zen\ndoes not mean it to be a mindless state, much less losing the\nmind. Nor does it mean a disappearance of the mind. Rather it\ndesignates a dimension of experience in which the\nego-logically discriminatory activity of the mind\ndisappears. This may be illustrated in terms of seeing things that\noccurs in a deep state of meditative absorption, where\n“seeing” means becoming visible as mentioned above. Zen\nadepts are said to acquire a power of meditation\n(Jpn.: jōriki), which is related to abilities like\nclairvoyance, clairaudience, and retrocognition. These abilities\ncoincide with those of two of the three night-watches on the night of\nhistorical Buddha’s enlightenment experience. Once such a power\nbecomes available to the meditators, they intentionally focus on\nseeing whatever they want to see. This is an activity of\nego-consciousness, but after settling into a deeper state of\nabsorption, the person’s ego-conscious activity ceases and an\nimage appears from the unconscious in response to the meditator’s\nintention. This is because the unconscious has an autonomous activity\nthat works independent of conscious will. This occurs once the\nmeditator eliminates or lessens the oppositional and conflicting\nrelationship between the consciousness and unconscious. If,\nhowever, the meditator tries to see an image by relying on his or her\nego-consciousness, the image which has surfaced in the field of\nmeditative awareness immediately disappears, because the meditator\nslips back into a dualistic state from the non-dualistic state. The\nmeditator must remain in a non-dualistic state in order to see what\nappears in the field of meditative awareness. \n\nPhilosophically speaking, we can characterize this experiential event\nthat the Zen practitioner trans-descends into, and hence transcends,\nthe ego-logically discriminatory activity of the mind. Zen\ncontends that this arises due to adhering to “name-form” (Jpn.:\nmyōshiki; Skrt.: nāmarūpa). This\ntranscendence results in a rejection of the belief that there is a\nreality corresponding to a name, or generally that there is a reality\ncorresponding to a linguistic activity. Through the state of no-mind,\nZen observes that each individual thing that is mirrored is recognized\nfor the first time to be individual qua the\nindividual with a sense of equality that is due to other individual\nthings.  \nGiven Zen’s seeing as articulated above, one may raise the next\nquestion: how does Zen understand time and space? Are they\nsignificantly different from time and space as conceived by many other\ntheories of time and space? In what follows, we will briefly provide\nhow Zen understands “here and now,” “zero-time and\nzero-space,” and “an integrated time and space.” \nIn spite of, or rather because of, the above-mentioned experiential\ndimension of Zen-seeing, Zen insists that the Zen practitioner plant\nhis or her feet in the everydayness of “here and now.” In\nthis respect, Zen philosophically advocates a position of “not\none,” where “one” here means remaining in the state\nof meditative absorption. Otherwise, it fears that if the practitioner\nremains in the stillness of meditation, while suspending judgment on\naction, it falls into one-sidedness, a source of prejudice and\nmisunderstanding of reality. How then does Zen understand “here\nand now”? In this connection, one may reasonably ask: “how\nfar and wide is ‘here’ and how long is\n‘now,’” when Zen speaks of “here and\nnow.” Are they each limited by a present perceptual experience?\nIn the case of “now,” for example, is it an internal\nphenomenon of consciousness that allows the practitioner to experience\ntime sometimes as a “memory” (or retention) and some other\ntimes as “anticipation” (or “protention”) in\nthe ever flowing stream of “present” (e.g., as described\nby St. Augustine, Husserl and Merleau-Ponty)? And in the case of\n“here,” is it delimited by the practitioner’s\nspatial range of perception within the sensory field, situating the\nZen practitioner as the point of reference? (There is in both cases a\nsuggestion of involvement of the autonomous activity of the\nunconscious, of which Zen demands we must stand outside.) Zen’s\nresponse to both of these questions is a resounding “Yes!”\nand “No!” however contradictory it may\nsound. “Yes,” because the practitioner, while living,\ncannot depart from the “here and now,” because he or she\nis incarnate, in which case time and space is always experienced as\n“here and now.” “No,” insofar as the\nperceptual model implies an ego-logical “human, all too\nhuman” stance (Nietzsche) with its attendant limitations, even\nthough Zen does not exclude this model as long as it is not delimited\nby the dualistic, either-or ego-logical perspective. In the everyday\nhuman world that is “here and now,” Zen maintains that\n“riddhi and [its] wondrous activity all shoulder water\nand carry firewood” where “riddhi” refers\nto a power that naturally becomes available to the practitioner\nthrough the practice of meditation.  \nZen however thinks that the preceding is still a partial understanding\nof “here and now.” To fully understand it, it is helpful\nto examine the following often-quoted phrase, as it is particularly\nillustrative. Zen demands that the practitioner “show\none’s original face before one’s parents were born.”\nThis demand points to an experiential dimension prior to the\nbifurcation between the subject and the object—and hence\n“not two”—where “prior” means negation\nof the spatial-temporal ordering principles such as in Kant’s\nunderstanding of time and space as a priori forms of\nintuition. It points to a non-dualistic experiential dimension that is\nzero-time and zero-space, by which Zen means that neither time nor\nspace is a delimiting condition for Zen-seeing. In zero-time there is\nno distinction between past, present, and future, or between\n“before” and “after”; in zero- space there is\nno distinction between the whole and its parts. One can also say that\nboth time and space, experienced from the point-of-view of the\neveryday standpoint, is relativized when zero-time temporizes\nand zero-space spatializes, where zero time and zero space\ncharacterize the bottomless ground. Accordingly, Zen contends that\nzero-time and zero-space are the natural and primordial being of all\nthings including human beings, for they are all grounded in it. Taking\nthese points together, the Zen enlightenment experience suggests a\nleap from a causal temporal series.  \nConsequently, Zen contends that “here and now” is enfolded\nin both zero-time and zero-space. This means that one time contains\nall times and one part contains the whole, as in the case of a\nholographic dry plate in which each part contains the whole. (See the \nentry on \n Japanese Philosophy, Section 2.2.)\nSeen in\nthis manner, “now” for the Zen person is a temporalization\nof zero-time, while “here” is equally a spatialization of\nzero-space, even though he or she may be anchored in the perceptual\nfield of “here and now” as understood above. In other\nwords, for the Zen person both “now” and\n“here” are experienced as an expression of thing-events in\ntheir suchness, because, as mentioned in the foregoing, Zen takes\nzero- time and zero-space to be the original abode of thing-events.\nCaution must be exercised here, however. Zen’s zero-time should\nnot be confounded with the idea of eternity standing outside a\ntemporal series (Thomas Aquinas’s or Newton’s\n“absolute time,” for example) by means of a logical or intellectual\ntranscendence, nor should the zero-space be identified with\na Newtonian-like “absolute space” wherein there is no\ncontent of experience. In other words, Zen does not understand time\nand space by imposing a formal category on them, by\npresupposing in advance a form-matter distinction, which\nindicates an operation of the discursive mode of reasoning by\nappealing to the either-or, dualistic, and ego-logical epistemological\nstructure.  \nJust as importantly, Zen maintains that time and space are lived as\nintegrated space-time in the interfusion of a concrete\ntemporalization and spatialization. For example, Dōgen speaks of\nit as “being-time” (u-ji) to indicate their\ninseparability; being cannot be apart from time, and time\ncannot be apart from being, where a being spatializes through\nthe process of temporalization, and where it temporalizes through the\nprocess of spatialization. This is a concrete\nspatialization-temporalization that is lived without any intellectual\nabstraction, reflecting the Buddhist position that everything,\nwithout exception, is impermanent. Zen abhors an intellectual\nabstraction that merely thinks time and space. This is\nbecause the Zen person rides on the rhythm of living nature. That is,\n“here and now” is one experience (and hence “not\ntwo”), and for this reason they should be designated as\n“here-now.”  \nIn living this integrated, living space-time, Zen does not understand\ntime to be a quantifiable (the move prepared by Aristotle’s\nunderstanding of time as the measurement between before and after) and\nhomogeneously punctuated unit (i.e., the clock time of natural\nscience). Nor does it conceive of it as a linear progression from past\nto future through the present, although it does not exclude them\ninsofar as they are useful for everyday life. The negation of the\nlinear idea of time also includes the negation of the idea of time as\nsymmetrical and reversible, because in the Zen experience of\nspace-time, a teleological intentionality, an “in order\nthat,” is absent. Yet Zen does not accept time as a\n“fleeting image of eternity” (as in Plato). Zen\nunderstands time to be living. According to Zen, theories of time\nbuilt through conceptual abstraction are distanced and separate from\nthe immediacy of “here-now.”  \nSpace, too, is neither a container (as with Newtown’s\n“absolute space”) nor an a priori limiting\ncondition (as in Kant), nor the place of displacement for the volume\nof an extended thing (as in Aristotle). Rather it is a living\nspace. Dōgen for example captures this sense of space as\n“the bird flies the sky and the sky flies the bird.” In\nthis statement Dōgen recognizes the independence of the sky and\nthe bird, but also recognizes that the sky and the bird each become\nthemselves only through their interdependence. In other words, what\nmakes this space a living space is the dynamic,\ninterdependent, bilateral play of both bird and sky, from which the\nliving space-time as the continuum of “here-now” emerges\nas an ambience, where each of the terms entering the relationship\nthrough the activity is granted a full recognition of their being.\nThis is because the Zen person lives the dynamic activity of\nnon-dualistic “coming-together” of “the two,”\nwhether this “two” happens to involve the\n“betweenness” of two individuals, individual and nature,\nor individual and trans-individual.  \nGiven Zen’s mode of seeing, which is non-dualistic in nature,\noccurring in zero-time and zero-space, one may ask how things appear\nto the Zen mind under these conditions. We can interpret Zen’s\nnondualistic experience epistemologically as that experience which\narises from a nondiscriminatory state of meditational awareness. To be\nmore specific, nondiscriminatory awareness signifies that it is the\nfoundational background, as articulated in the foregoing, that is\nbottomless or nothing, and as such does not participate in\ndiscriminatory activity. However, when a thing appears, a\ndiscrimination occurs on this foundational, though bottomless,\nbackground. Because it occurs on this foundation, it does not distort\nthe shape of things to appear along with its force. We have designated\nits activity as discernment vis-à-vis nondiscrimination. It may\nalso be characterized as nondiscriminatory discrimination, in order to\ncapture a sense of how things appear in meditational awareness. In\nsuch awareness no ego is posited either as an active or a passive\nagent in constituting the things of experience, as this awareness\nrenders useless the active-passive scheme as an explanatory\nmodel. This awareness lets a thing announce itself as a\nthing. Therefore, it avoids, on one hand, the idealist position,\nincluding Husserl’s intentionality model in which a thetic\nmeaning-bestowing activity is assigned to the act of consciousness. \nOn the other hand, it also rejects the British empiricist’s stance in which\nthe epistemological subject is considered a passive \ntabula rasa upon which attributes are impressed. These\nimplications are suggested because Zen’s\nnondiscriminatory/discriminatory awareness arises out of the state of\nno-ego in which no projection from the unconscious and no\nsuperimposition of intellectual ideas occur in the field of meditative\nawareness.  \nMoreover, because things are experientially “constituted”\nin this manner, we can interpret the epistemological structure of\nappearing to be such that things appear in the field of meditative\nawareness without presupposing Gestalt psychology’s distinction\nbetween foreground and background. This is because the ego is turned\ninto nothing in the state of nondiscriminatory discriminatory\nawareness, and hence no-ego, where this nothing is paradoxically a\nbackground that is not the background at all, because it is a\nbottomless background. To use Nishida’s terminology\nagain, the nondiscriminatory/discriminatory awareness is an act of\n“seeing without being a seer.” Or, to use the terminology\nof phenomenology, the bottomless background or the background of\nnothing is the stance in which the noetic act is rendered nothing.\nAccordingly, the noematic object is allowed to announce iteself\nwithout an intentional constitution by the latter. This is the meaning\nof “no projection” and “no superimposition”\nmentioned above. It consequently opens up a bottomless horizon, on\nwhich a noematic object announces itself in toto as a\nphenomenon. \nThis opening up simultaneously accompanies, as mentioned in the\nforegoing, a de-substantialization and de-ontologization of the things\nof experience, because there is no act of the ego that substantializes\nand ontologizes them; substantialization and ontologization both arise\nas a consequense of anthropomorphic activity that is intricately tied\nto the discursive mode of reasoning. Consequently, we are led to\nconclude that the things of experience announce themselves in\ntoto without concealing anything behind them. This is because\nthere is nothing in the bottomless background to determine or delimit\nhow things appear. Zen uses such terms as “suchness” or\n“thusness” to designate it. For example, Dōgen\ncaptures it by stating in “the Buddha Nature” fascicle\nthat “nothing is concealed in the universe.” \nIn order to see how the above-mentioned structure of appearing\noperates under the conditions of zero-time and zero-space, we must\ncapture a sense of a temporal-spatial awareness reflective of the\nnondualistic experience. We previously discussed zero-time\ntemporalizing and zero-space spatializing in which temporalization is\nspatialization and spatialization is temporalization, as in\nDōgens theory of “being-time,” wherein there is no\nformal separation between the two. Hence,\nneither time nor space is conceived to be a container. Rather, they\nare expressions of things “thing-ing” the primordial mode\nof their being. This thing-ing of things springs from zero-time and\nzero-space. One must stand on ground zero to see the\n“thing-ing” of things where there is no temporalization\nand no spatialization of things. \nIf we are to stop at sketching what Zen-seeing is together with its\nunderstanding of time and space as an integrated space-time, there is\nthe danger of fixing the stance thus “obtained.” (Although\nwe must keep in mind that Zen “obtains” the stance of\n“not two” in such a way that it cannot be obtained, for in\nthe non-dualistic dimension nothing can be “obtained.”)\nZen recognizes at the same time that any stance that is fixed is\none-sided and partial.  It will deprive Zen, for example, of an\nopportunity to utilize Zen-seeing in the actions of everyday life. For\nthis reason, Zen insists that the practitioner move to the stance of\n“not one.” What then is Zen’s stance of “not\none”?  This question affords the reader, for the purpose of the\npresent article, to get a glimpse into Zen’s movement from\n“not two” to “not one,” although in actuality\nthis movement operates in a dynamic bilateral movement between\nthem. This movement is symbolized in Zen by a circle, an image of the\nwhole, which is also an image of perfection. Insofar as\n“one” is a negation of “not two,” “not\none” then brings the Zen practitioner back to the everyday\nlifeworld, the world of multiplicity that is ordinarily constructed\nego-logically and dualistically.  \nFor the Zen person, the move from “not two” to “not\none” is an issue of concretely instantiating in the everyday\nlifeworld what is experienced through the stance of\n“not two.” This point, for example, is well illustrated in\nthe following Zen dialogue between Zen Master Ungen (Chin.\nYúnyán, 780–841) and a fellow practitioner,\nDōgo (Chin., Dàowú; 769–835). When Ungen is making\na cup of tea, the dialogue runs as \nfollows: \nDōgo: To whom are you going to serve the tea you are preparing?  \nUngen: There is the person who wants it. \nDōgo: Can’t the person who wants it make the tea\nhimself? \nUngen: Fortunately, I am here to do it for him. \n(Ueda, 1981, 165–66.) \nThis dialogue points to an activity of “trans-individual\nqua the individual,” where the\n“trans-individual” designates a Zen person with\nnondiscriminatory wisdom, while the “individual”\ndesignates those who remain in the everyday lifeworld.\n(In the above quote, the former is designated by the phrase “the\nperson,” while the latter by the pronoun “you.”)\nHowever, in the everyday human lifeworld, the\n“trans-individual” cannot “make the tea\nhimself,” because he is not incarnate like the individual who\nremains in the dualistic, either-or ego-logical, everyday standpoint.\nThis is because he or she is one who follows the non-dualistic,\nnon-ego-logical standpoint having practically transcended the former.\nThis creates the dilemma of how to be trans-individual while assuming\nthe form of an individual. If this is not properly dealt with, Zen\nwarns that it results in developing a pathological condition or a\nmana-personality. For this reason, Ungen says\n“fortunately ‘I’ am here to do it for him.”\nHere, Zen conceives of the relationship between the individual and the\ntrans-individual as one, i.e., “not two,” and yet they are\n“not one.” Insofar as both the trans-individual and the\nindividual refer to the same person (in the above quote,\n“I”), they are “not two,” but insofar as their\nstances operate differently, they are “not one”\n(“I” and “him” in the quote). “Both\nindividual and trans-individual” designates a harmonious\nassimilation of the two stances, a consequence of which is a person\nwho can avail him or herself of both of these perspectives, i.e., the\ndualistic world of the everyday life and the non-dualistic world of\n“not two.” On the other hand, “neither individual\nnor trans-individual” refers to a person who cannot be pinned\ndown or delimited by linguistic means. In spite of, or because of\nthis, such a person is a carrier of freedom who goes beyond these\nperspectives, i.e., a person in whom the trans-individual and\nindividual have disappeared in action, in which case the\nindividual qua trans-individual is no longer\nordinary, but extraordinary. Yet, he or she is quite ordinary\nin appearance. All of these points are synthesized into a Zen\nperson.  \nHow then does the Zen person, thus understood, live freedom? The term\nthat Zen uses to express the idea of “freedom” is\n“jiyū” and it consists of two characters:\n“ji” meaning “self on its own,” while\n“yū” means “out of.” When they\nare used together as a compound, the phrase as a whole designates an\naction arising out of self on its own. This action then\ncarries a sense of spontaneity, much like the spontaneous\ncreative act of living nature. This idea of freedom is foreign to the\nWestern intellectual tradition, however. For example, consider how\nfreedom is defined by British empiricists like John Locke. According\nto Locke, freedom (or to be specific, liberty) is defined as a lack or\nabsence of external constraint. According to this model, freedom is to\nexpress an ego-desire save in the name of will arising from an\nindividual in “the state of nature” where and when there\nis no external constraint. By contrast, because it arises out of the\nself on its own, where the self in Zen is a groundless ground that is\nnothing, Zen’s free action is not delimited by ego-desire,\nbecause it arises out of nothing. It “kicks through the bottom\nof the bucket,” that is, it purifies all the\n“defilements” interlaced with the activity of the\nego-consciousness, as well as the personal and collective unconscious.\nFor this reason, there is no issue involved in the Zen person’s\naction that addresses the will of ego-consciousness. For what\nmotivates the Zen person to action is a thrust he or she\nfeels, surging from the creative source in the bottomless ground.\nMoreover, the Zen person does not experience, as Nietzsche has it,\n“bad-faith” or “self-deception” when\nexplaining a motivation for action as a rationalist would, because a\nrationalist must rationalize an irrational desire rooted in the body\nand the unconscious. (See, for example, Nietzsche’s Beyond\nGood and Evil.) \nDoes this mean then that the Zen person has eliminated the demand of\ninstincts or desires? If they are eliminated, the Zen person\nwould turn into a living corpse. Such a person can perform no action,\nlet alone a free action. Obviously then, the Zen person does\nnot eliminate them, but rather transforms them into\n“non-defilements,” into a higher spiritual energy. We see\na heightened spirituality upheld by Zen master Baso (Chin.,\nMäzū; 709–788), which he insists to be concretely\nexpressed in the everyday lifeworld. He expresses it by\nphrasing it as “the mind as it is is the way.” (Yanagita,\n1974, 147.) This statement, “the mind as it is is the Way”\n(heijōshin kore michi) is sometimes rendered in English\nas “the everyday mind is the Way.” This rendition can be\nmisleading if we ignore Baso’s qualification that this\n“everyday mind” operates without defilements such that it\nis not “[entrenched in the samsāric cycle] of\nbirth and death,” and moreover that it is not dominated by a\nteleological intentionality, i.e., it negates the “in order\nthat.” Otherwise, there is a danger of interpreting Baso’s\nstatement as promoting an evil naturalism. That is, whatever a person\ndesires in the state of “nature,” i.e., “the\neveryday mind,” is the expression of the Way. There is no\nproblem of a misinterpretation then, as long as Baso’s\n“everyday mind” is understood to mean the mind which is\nfreed from “the samsāsric cycle of birth and\ndeath,” and yet it is the mind which is concretely instantiated\nin the everydayness of a human everyday lifeworld.  \nLet us see how Baso’s idea of “the mind as it is is the\nWay” is carried to a highly artistic action, whether it be a\nperformance technique of martial artist, dancer, actor/actress or\nmusician. Takuan’s reflection on this point is illuminating. He\nspeaks of a “nondiscriminatory knowledge” realized in\naction as “immovable wisdom”: “It [immovable wisdom]\nmoves as the mind is wont to move: forward or back, to the left, to\nthe right, in the ten directions and to the eight points; and the mind\nthat does not stop at all is called immovable wisdom.” (Takuan,\n1986.) Zen’s free action is predicated on the fact that the mind\n“does not stop at all,” what Takuan paradoxically calls\n“immovable wisdom.” Here one can discern an echo of\nJinne’s mirror analogy. Takuan calls it “immovable”\nbecause the mind remains absolutely still (i.e., not two) in the\nmidst of action, like the stationary shaft of a top. Such a\nmind does not fluctuate in its center, in the deep region of\npsyche. In this state, because the mind moves in such a way\nthat it does not dwell on anything, there is no obstruction for the\nmind to move freely.  \nGenerally Zen describes the freedom of bodily movement as\n“stillness in motion” (dōchū no\nsei) and is contrasted with “motion in stillness.” It\nis noteworthy that “stillness in motion” cannot accurately\nbe analyzed by appealing to the active-passive scheme, which\npresupposes a dichotomy as a proper method for understanding. However\ncontradictory it may seem, this is a description of how Zen\nunderstands its freedom as expressed through an integrated mind and\nbody. In order for this sense of freedom to be embodied, however, Zen\nemphasizes that a performer of any kind repeatedly undergoes mind-body\ntraining. Takuan calls this the “body’s\nlearning,”—that is the core meaning of\nself-cultivation—because in the “body’s\nlearning,” both the mind and the body are brought to action in\none integrated whole. (The “body’s learning,”\nneurophysiologically speaking, is closely related to an activity of\nthe cerebellum in conjunction with the hippocampus, although it is not\nonly that.) When a skill or performing technique is learned through\nthis method, one’s own body moves freely as it is habituated to\nmove without waiting for a command from the mind. This describes a\nfreedom of action in a Zen person for whom the mind is completely\nassimilated into the object-body, while the body is equally rendered\ninto the subject-body. They are one. At such a time, Takuan says, a\nspiritual life-energy of psychophysiological nature, called\n“ki,” permeates “one’s\nbody”—an energy that cannot be delineated by either the\nmind or the body (Yuasa, 1993). In this connection, Zen also speaks of\nZen’s free action as a purposeless purpose, as an actionless\naction, for neither the purpose nor the action arises from the\neveryday consciousness which sets up a purpose or a goal for action.\nZen calls it “samādhi-at-play,” where there\nis no individual qua the trans-individual, but what there is\nis just “play,” for the Zen person is absorbed in\nthe activity when engaging a thing of the everyday\nlifeworld. In short, Zen freedom designates a term of\nachievement. What Zen says about freedom of action has an\nimplication for every action people perform in daily life, from the\nsimple act of opening a door to the magnificent play of a great\nathlete or performer of any kind. In them, Zen contends however, the\nspirituality of a performer must be expressed. Zen extends an\ninvitation to all of us to act in this way, so that our quality of\nlife will be enhanced with a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment,\nfree from stress and anxiety. \nThis article has articulated a Zen Philosophy, though as\nanti-philosophy, by thematizing such topics as “overcoming\ndualism,” “Zen-seeing,” “Zen’s\nunderstanding of time and space,” “Zen person,” and\n“Zen freedom,” and in the process has noted a sense of the\nmovement from “not two” to “not one.” This was\nto indicate Zen’s sense of achieving personhood. Zen’s\nmethods of meditative practice are concrete ways for an individual to\nbecome a Zen person by awakening to the fundamental reality in the\neveryday human lifeworld. In so doing, it teaches us to\nparticipate in the whole, and to express freedom in daily action, by\nshowing one’s “original face” right here-now and\nright in front of one’s eyes.  \nIn closing this entry, a cautionary remark is in order, however: all\nof the preceding accounts are simply a heuristic way of\nconceptually articulating Zen philosophy. Or to use a Zen phrase, this\nconceptual articulation is only “a finger pointing to the\nmoon,” where Zen insists that there should not be a confounding\nof the moon with a finger. In Zen language, the moon metaphorically\ndesignates an experience of enlightenment and the finger a linguistic\nor reflective endeavor.","contact.mail":"snagatom@temple.edu","contact.domain":"temple.edu"}]
