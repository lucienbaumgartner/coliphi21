While she is directly aware only of her \nimmediate situation — her being seated in front of her \ncomputer, the music playing in the background, the sound of her \nhusband's voice on the phone in the next room, and so on — she \nis quite certain that this situation is only part of a series of \nincreasingly more inclusive, albeit less immediate, situations: the \nsituation in her house as a whole, the one in her neighborhood, the \ncity she lives in, the state, the North American continent, the \nEarth, the solar system, the galaxy, and so on. On the face of it, \nanyway, it seems quite reasonable to believe that this series has a \nlimit, that is, that there is a maximally inclusive \nsituation encompassing all others: things, as a whole or, \nmore succinctly, the actual world. \n\n\nMost of us also believe that things, as a whole, needn't have been \njust as they are. Rather, things might have been different in \ncountless ways, both trivial and profound. History, from the very \nbeginning, could have unfolded quite other than it did in fact: the \nmatter constituting a distant star might never have organized well \nenough to give light; species that survived might just as well have \ndied off; battles won might have been lost; children born might never\nhave been conceived and children never conceived might otherwise have\nbeen born. In any case, no matter how things had gone they would \nstill have been part of a single, maximally inclusive, \nall-encompassing situation, a single world. Intuitively, then, the \nactual world of which Anne's immediate situation is a part is only \none among many possible worlds. \n\n\nThe idea of possible worlds is evocative and appealing. However, \npossible worlds failed to gain any real traction among philosophers \nuntil the 1960s when they were invoked to provide the conceptual \nunderpinnings of some powerful developments in modal logic. Only then\ndid questions of their nature become a matter of the highest \nphilosophical importance. Accordingly, Part 1 of this article\nwill provide an overview of the role of possible worlds in the \ndevelopment of modal logic. Part 2 explores three prominent \nphilosophical approaches to the nature of possible \n worlds.[1] \nAlthough many of the finer philosophical points of Part 2\ndo presuppose the technical background of Part 1, the general\nphilosophical landscape laid out in Part 2 can be appreciated \nindependently of Part 1.\n\n\n\nAlthough ‘possible world’ has been part of the \nphilosophical lexicon at least since Leibniz, the notion became \nfirmly entrenched in contemporary philosophy with the development of \npossible world semantics for the languages of propositional and\nfirst-order modal logic. In addition to the usual sentence operators\nof\n classical logic such as\n‘and’ (‘∧’), ‘or’\n(‘∨’), ‘not’ (‘¬’),\n‘if...then’ (‘→’), and, in the\nfirst-order case, the quantifiers ‘all’\n(‘∀’) and ‘some’\n(‘∃’), these languages contain operators intended to\nrepresent the modal adverbs ‘necessarily’\n(‘□’) and ‘possibly’\n(‘◇’). Although a prominent aspect of logic in both\nAristotle's work and the work of many medieval philosophers, modal\nlogic was largely ignored from the modern period to the mid-20th\ncentury. And even though a variety of modal deductive systems had in\nfact been rigorously developed in the early 20th century, notably by\nLewis and Langford (1932), there was for the languages of those\nsystems nothing comparable to the elegant semantics that Tarski had\nprovided for the languages of classical first-order\nlogic. Consequently, there was no rigorous account of what it means\nfor a sentence in those languages to be true and, hence, no\naccount of the critical semantic notions of validity and logical\nconsequence to underwrite the corresponding deductive notions of\ntheoremhood and provability. A concomitant philosophical consequence of\nthis void in modal logic was a deep skepticism, voiced most\nprominently by Quine, toward any appeal to modal notions in\nmetaphysics generally, notably, the notion of an essential property.\n(See Quine 1953 and 1956, and the appendix to Plantinga 1974.) The\npurpose of the following two subsections is to provide a simple and\nlargely ahistorical overview of how possible world semantics fills\nthis void; the final subsection presents two important applications of\nthe semantics. (Readers familiar with basic possible world semantics\ncan skip to §2 with no significant loss of continuity.)  \n\nSince the middle ages at least, philosophers have recognized a \nsemantical distinction between extension and \nintension. The extension of a denoting expression, or \nterm, such as a name or a definite description is its \nreferent, the thing that it refers to; the extension of a predicate \nis the set of things it applies to; and the extension of a sentence \nis its truth value. By contrast, the intension of an expression is \nsomething rather less definite — its sense, or \nmeaning, the semantical aspect of the expression that \ndetermines its extension. For purposes here, let us say that a \nlogic is a formal language together with a semantic theory for\nthe language, that is, a theory that provides rigorous definitions of\ntruth, validity, and logical consequence for the \n language.[2]\n A logic is extensional if the truth value of every sentence \nof the logic is determined entirely by its form and the extensions of\nits component sentences, predicates, and terms. An extensional logic \nwill thus typically feature a variety of valid substitutivity \nprinciples. A substitutivity principle says that, if two \nexpressions are coextensional, that is, if they have the same \nextension, then (subject perhaps to some reasonable conditions) \neither can be substituted for the other in any sentence salva \nveritate, that is, without altering the original sentence's truth\nvalue. In an \n intensional logic,\n the truth values of some sentences are determined by something over \nand above their forms and the extensions of their components and, as \na consequence, at least one classical substitutivity principle is \ntypically rendered invalid.  \n\nExtensionality is a well known and generally cherished feature of \nclassical propositional and predicate logic. Modal logic, by \ncontrast, is intensional. To illustrate: the substitutivity principle\nfor sentences tells us that sentences with the same truth value can \nbe substituted for one another salva veritate. So suppose that\nJohn's only pets are two dogs, Algol and BASIC, say, and consider two\nsimple sentences and their formalizations (the predicates in question\nindicating the obvious English counterparts):  \n\nAs both sentences are true, they have the same extension. Hence, in \naccordance with the classical substitutivity principle for sentences,\nwe can replace the occurrence of (1) with (2) in the false sentence  \n\nand the result is the equally false sentence  \n\nHowever, when we make the same substitution in the true sentence  \n\nthe result is the sentence  \n\nwhich is intuitively false, as John surely could have had a \nnon-mammalian pet. In a modal logic that accurately represents the \nlogic of the necessity operator, therefore, the substitutivity \nprinciple for sentences will have to fail.  \n\nThe same example illustrates that the substitutivity principle for \npredicates will have to fail in modal logic as well. For, according \nto our example, the predicates ‘D’ and \n‘P’ that are true of John's dogs and of John's \npets, respectively, are coextensional, i.e., \n∀x(Dx ↔ Px). However, while \nsubstituting the latter predicate for the former in (3) results in a \nsentence with the same truth value, the same substitution in (5) does\nnot.  \n\nModal logic, therefore, is intensional: in general, the truth \nvalue of a sentence is determined by something over and above its \nform and the extensions of its components. Absent a rigorous semantic\ntheory to identify the source of its intensionality and to \nsystematize intuitions about modal truth, validity, and logical \nconsequence, there was little hope for the widespread acceptance of \nmodal logic.  \n\nThe idea of possible worlds raised the prospect of extensional \nrespectability for modal logic, not by rendering modal logic itself \nextensional, but by endowing it with an extensional semantic theory \n— one whose own logical foundation is that of classical \npredicate logic and, hence, one on which possibility and necessity \ncan ultimately be understood along classical Tarskian lines. \nSpecifically, in possible world semantics, the modal operators\nare interpreted as quantifiers over possible worlds, as \nexpressed informally in the following two general principles:  \n\nGiven this, the failures of the classical substitutivity principles \ncan be traced to the fact that modal operators, so interpreted, \nintroduce contexts that require subtler notions of meaning for\nsentences and their component parts than are \nprovided in classical logic; in particular, a subtler notion (to be \nclarified shortly) is required for predicates than that of the set of\nthings they happen to apply to.  \n\n \n Tarskian Semantics. Standard model theoretic semantics for the\nlanguages of predicate logic deriving from the work of Tarski (1933, \n1944) is the paradigmatic semantic theory for extensional logics. \nGiven a standard first-order language ℒ, a Tarskian \ninterpretation I for ℒ specifies a set D for the quantifiers of ℒ to range over (typically, some set of things that ℒ has been designed to describe) and\nassigns, to each \nterm (constant or variable) τ of ℒ, a referent \naτ ∈ D and, to each n-place \npredicate π of ℒ, an appropriate extension \nEπ — a truth value (TRUE or FALSE) if \nn = 0, a subset of D if n = 1, and a set of \nn-tuples of members of D if n > 1. Given these \nassignments, sentences are evaluated as true under the interpretation I — trueI, for short — according to a more or less familiar set of clauses. To facilitate the definition, let I[ν/a] be the interpretation that assigns the individual\na to the variable ν and is otherwise exactly like I.\nThen we have:  \n\nClauses for the other standard Boolean operators and the existential \nquantifier under their usual definitions follow straightaway from \nthese clauses. In particular, where  \n\nit follows that:  \n\nIt is easy to verify that, in each of the above cases, replacing one \ncoextensional term, predicate, or sentence for another has no effect \non the truth values rendered by the above clauses, thus guaranteeing \nthe validity of the classical substitutivity principles and, hence, \nthe extensionality of first-order logic with a Tarskian semantics.  \n\nFrom Tarskian to Possible World Semantics. The truth \nconditional clauses for the three logical operators directly reflect \nthe meanings of the natural language expressions they symbolize: \n‘¬’ means not; ‘→’ means \nif...then; ‘∀’ means all. It is \neasy to see, however, that we cannot expect to add an equally simple \nclause for sentences containing an operator that symbolizes \nnecessity. For a Tarskian interpretation fixes the domain of\nquantification and the extensions of all the predicates. Pretty \nclearly, however, to capture necessity and possibility, one must be \nable to consider alternative “possible” domains of \nquantification and alternative “possible” extensions for \npredicates as well. For, intuitively, under different circumstances, \nfewer, more, or other things might have existed and things that \nactually exist might, in those circumstances, have had very different\nproperties. (6), for example, is false because John could have had \nnon-mammalian pets: a canary, say, or a turtle, or, under \nvery different circumstances, a dragon. A bit more formally \nput: Both the domain of quantification and the extension of the \npredicate ‘P’ could, in some sense or other, have \nbeen different.  \n\nPossible world semantics, of course, uses the concept of a possible\nworld to give substance to the idea of alternative extensions and\nalternative domains of quantification. (Possible world semantics can\nbe traced most clearly back to the work of Carnap (1947), its basic\ndevelopment culminating in the work of Hintikka (1957, 1961), Bayart\n(1958, 1959), and Kripke (1959, 1963a, 1963b).[5]) Similar to Tarskian semantics, a possible world interpretation M of a modal language ℒ\nspecifies a nonempty set D, although thought of now as the set\nof “possible individuals” of M. Also as in Tarskian\nsemantics, M assigns each term τ of ℒ a referent\naτ in D.[6] Additionally however, M specifies a\nset W, the set of “possible worlds” of M,\none of which is designated its “actual world”, and each\nworld w in W is assigned its own domain of\nquantification, d(w) ⊆ D, intuitively, the\nset of individuals that exist in w.[7] To capture the idea of both the actual and\npossible extensions of a predicate, M assigns to each\nn-place predicate π a function Mπ\n— the intension of π — that, for each possible\nworld w, returns the extension\nMπ(w) of π at w: a\ntruth value, if n = 0; a set of individuals, if n = 1;\nand a set of n-tuples of individuals, if n > 1.[8] We can thus rigorously\ndefine a “possible extension” of a predicate π to be\nany of its w-extensions\nMπ(w), for any world w.  \n\nThe Tarskian truth conditions above are now generalized by \nrelativizing them to worlds as follows: for any possible world \nw (the world of evaluation):  \n\nAnd to these, of course, is added the critical modal case that \nexplicitly interprets the modal operator to be a quantifier over \nworlds, as we'd initially anticipated informally in our principle \n Nec:\n  \n\n      A sentence φ is falseM at w\n      just in case it is not trueM at w, and\n      φ is said to be trueM just in case\n      φ is trueM at the actual world of\n      M. \n\n      On the assumption that there is a (nonempty) set of all possible\n      worlds and a set of all possible individuals, we can define\n      “objective” notions of truth at a world and of truth\n      simpliciter, that is, notions that are not simply\n      relative to formal, mathematical interpretations but, rather,\n      correspond to objective reality in all its modal glory. Let\n      ℒ be a modal language whose names and predicates represent\n      those in some fragment of ordinary language (as in our examples\n      (5) and (6) above). Say that M is the \n      “intended” interpretation of ℒ if (i) its set\n      W of “possible worlds” is in fact the set of\n      all possible worlds, (ii) its designated “actual\n      world” is in fact the actual world, (iii) its set D\n      of “possible individuals” is in fact the set of all\n      possible individuals, and (iv) the referents assigned to the\n      names of ℒ and the intensions assigned to the predicates\n      of ℒ are the ones they in fact have. Then, where M \n      is the intended interpretation of ℒ, we can say that\n      a sentence φ of ℒ is \n      true at a possible world w just in case φ \n      is trueM at w, and\n      that φ is true just in case it is\n      trueM at the actual world. (Falsity at\n      w and falsity, simpliciter, are defined accordingly.) Under the\n      assumption in question, then, the modal clause above takes on pretty much the\n      exact form of our informal principle Nec. \n\n    Call the above basic possible world semantics.  Spelling\n    out the truth conditions for (6) (relative to the\n    intended interpretation of its language), basic\n    possible world semantics tells us that (6) is\n    true if and only if  \n\nAnd by unpacking (8) in terms of the quantificational, material conditional, \nand atomic clauses above we have that (6) is true if and only if  \n\nSince we are evaluating (6) with regard to the intended interpretation of its\nlanguage, the w-extension of ‘P’ that is returned by its intension, for any world w, is the (perhaps empty) set of John's pets\nin w and that of ‘M’ is the set of mammals in w. Hence, if w is a world where John has a pet\ncanary — COBOL, say — COBOL is in the w-extension\nof ‘P’ but not that of ‘M’ ,\ni.e., ‘∀x(Px → Mx)’ is\nfalse at w and, hence, by the truth condition (9), (6) is false at the actual world — that is, (6) is false simpliciter, as it should be.  \n\nNote that interpreting modal operators as quantifiers over possible \nworlds provides a nice theoretical justification for the usual \ndefinition of the possibility operator in terms of necessity, \nspecifically:  \n\nThat is, a sentence is possible just in case its negation isn't \nnecessary. Since, semantically speaking, the necessity \noperator is literally a universal quantifier, the definition\ncorresponds exactly to the definition \n (7)\n of the existential quantifier. For, unpacking the right side of \ndefinition (10) according to the negation and necessitation clauses\nabove (and invoking the definitions of truth and truth at a world\nsimpliciter), we have:  \n\nClearly, however, if it is not the case that φ fails to be true \nat all possible worlds, then it must be true at some world; hence:  \n\nAnd that corresponds exactly to our intuitive truth condition \n Poss\n above. Thus, spelling out the negation \n‘¬□∀x(Px → \nMx)’ of our false sentence \n (6)\n above in accordance with definition (10) (and the standard definition\nof conjunction ∧), we have:  \n\nfor which (12) and the possible world truth conditions for \nquantified, Boolean, and atomic sentences yield the correct truth condition:  \n\nthat is, less stuffily, there is a possible world in which, among \nJohn's pets, at least one is not a mammal.  \n\nSummary: Intensionality and Possible Worlds. Analyzed in terms\nof possible world semantics, then, the general failure of classical \nsubstitutivity principles in modal logic is due, not to an \nirreducibly intensional element in the meanings of the modal \noperators, but rather to a sort of mismatch between the surface \nsyntax of those operators and their semantics: syntactically, they \nare unary sentence operators like negation; but semantically, they \nare, quite literally, quantifiers. Their syntactic similarity to \nnegation suggests that, like negation, the truth values of \n⌈□φ⌉ and \n⌈◇φ⌉, insofar as they are\ndeterminable at all, must be determined by the truth value of φ. \nThat they are not (in general) so determined leads to the distinctive\nsubstitutivity failures noted above. The possible worlds analysis of \nthe modal operators as quantifiers over worlds reveals that the unary\nsyntactic form of the modal operators obscures a semantically \nrelevant parameter. When the modal operators are interpreted as \nquantifiers, this parameter becomes explicit and the reason \nunderlying the failure of extensionality in modal logic becomes \nclear: That the truth values of \n⌈□φ⌉ and \n⌈◇φ⌉ are not in general \ndetermined by the truth value of φ at the world of evaluation is,\nsemantically speaking, nothing more than the fact that the truth \nvalues of ‘∀xFx’ and \n‘∃xFx’ are not in general determined by the \ntruth value of ‘Fx’, for any particular value of \n‘x’. Possible world semantics, therefore, \nexplains the intensionality of modal logic by revealing that\nthe syntax of the modal operators prevents an adequate expression of \nthe meanings of the sentences in which they occur. Spelled out as \npossible world truth conditions, those meanings can be expressed in a\nwholly extensional fashion. \n (For\n a more formal exposition of this point, see the supplemental article \n The Extensionality of Possible World Semantics.)\n  \n\nAs noted, the focus of the present article is on the metaphysics of \npossible worlds rather than applications. Of course, the semantics of\nmodal languages is itself an application, but one that is of singular\nimportance, both for historical reasons and because most applications\nare in fact themselves applications of (often extended or modified \nversions of) the semantical apparatus. Two particularly important \nexamples are the analysis of intensions and a concomitant explication\nof the de re/de dicto \n distinction.[10] \n\nThe Analysis of Intensions. As much a barrier to the \nacceptance of modal logic as intensionality itself was the need to \nappeal to intensions per se — properties, relations, \npropositions, and the like — in semantical explanations. \nIntensional entities have of course featured prominently in the \nhistory of philosophy since Plato and, in particular, have played \nnatural explanatory roles in the analysis of \n intentional attitudes\n like \n belief\n and \n mental content.\n For all their prominence and importance, however, the nature of these\nentities has often been obscure and controversial and, indeed, as a \nconsequence, they were easily dismissed as ill-understood and \nmetaphysically suspect “creatures of darkness” (Quine \n1956, 180) by the naturalistically oriented philosophers of the \nearly- to mid-20th century. It is a virtue of possible world \nsemantics that it yields rigorous definitions for \nintensional entities. More specifically, as described above, possible\nworld semantics assigns to each n-place predicate π a \ncertain function Iπ — π's intension \n— that, for each possible world w, returns the extension\nIπ(w) of π at w. We can define \nan intension per se, independent of any language, to be any \nsuch function on worlds. More specifically:  \n\nThe adequacy of this analysis is a matter of lively debate that \nfocuses chiefly upon whether or not intensions, so defined, are too \n“coarse-grained” to serve their intended purposes. (See, \ne.g., Stalnaker 1987 and 2012 for a strong defense of the analysis.) \nHowever, Lewis (1986, §1.5) argues that, even if the above \nanalysis fails for certain purposes, it does not follow that \nintensions cannot be analyzed in terms of possible worlds, but only \nthat more subtle constructions might be required. This reply appears \nto side-step the objections from granularity while preserving the \ngreat advantage of the possible worlds analysis of intensions, viz., \nthe rigorous definability of these philosophically significant \nnotions.  \n\nThe De Re / De Dicto Distinction. A particularly\nrich application of the possible world analysis of intensions \nconcerns the analysis of the venerable distinction between de \nre and de dicto \n modality.[11]\n Among the strongest modal intuitions is that the possession of a \nproperty has a modal character — that things exemplify, or fail\nto exemplify, some properties necessarily, or \nessentially, and others only accidentally. Thus, for\nexample, intuitively, John's dog Algol is a pet accidentally; under\nless fortunate circumstances, she might have been, say, a stray that\nno one ever adopted. But she is a dog essentially; she couldn't have\nbeen a flower, a musical performance, a crocodile or any other kind of\nthing.  \n\nSpelling out this understanding in terms of worlds and the preceding \nanalysis of intensions, we can say that an individual a has a \nproperty F essentially if a has F in every world\nin which it exists, that is, if, for all worlds w in which \na exists, a ∈ F(w). Likewise, \na has F accidentally if a has F in the \nactual world @ but lacks it in some other world, that is, if a\n∈ F(@) but, for some world w in which a \nexists, a ∉ F(w). Thus, let \n‘G’ and ‘T’ symbolize ‘is\na dog’ and ‘is someone's pet’, respectively; then, \nwhere ‘E!x’ is short for \n‘∃y(x=y)’ (and, hence, \nexpresses that x exists), we have:  \n\nMore generally, sentences like (15) and (16) in which properties are \nascribed to a specific individual in a modal context — signaled\nformally by the occurrence of a name or the free occurrence of a \nvariable in the scope of a modal operator — are said to exhibit\nmodality de \n re[12]\n (modality of the thing). Modal sentences that do not, like  \n\nare said to exhibit modality de dicto (roughly, modality \nof the proposition). \nPossible world semantics provides an illuminating analysis of the key\ndifference between the two: The truth conditions for both modalities \ninvolve a commitment to possible worlds; however, the truth \nconditions for sentences exhibiting modality de re involve in \naddition a commitment to the meaningfulness of \n transworld identity,\n the thesis that, necessarily, every individual (typically, at any \nrate) exists and exemplifies (often very different) properties in \nmany different possible worlds. More specifically, basic possible \nworld semantics yields intuitively correct truth values for sentences\nof the latter sort by (i) permitting world domains to overlap and \n(ii) assigning intensions to predicates, thereby, in effect, \nrelativizing predicate extensions to worlds. In this way, one and the\nsame individual can be in the extension of a given predicate at all \nworlds in which they exist, at some such worlds only, or at none at \nall. (For further discussion, see the entry on\n essential vs. accidental properties.)\n  \n\nThe power and appeal of basic possible world semantics is undeniable.\nIn addition to providing a clear, extensional formal semantics for a \nformerly somewhat opaque, intensional notion, cashing possibility as \ntruth in some possible world and necessity as truth in every such \nworld seems to tap into very deep intuitions about the nature of \nmodality and the meaning of our modal discourse. Unfortunately, the \nsemantics leaves the most interesting — and difficult — \nphilosophical questions largely unanswered. Two arise with particular\nforce:  \n\nAnd, given QW:  \n\nIn this section we will concern ourselves with, broadly speaking, the\nthree most prominent philosophical approaches to these \n questions.[13] \n\nRecall the informal picture that we began with: a world is, so to \nsay, the “limit” of a series of increasingly more \ninclusive situations. Fleshed out philosophical accounts of this \ninformal idea generally spring from rather different intuitions about\nwhat one takes the “situations” in the informal picture \nto be. A particularly powerful intuition is that situations are \nsimply structured collections of physical objects: the \nimmediate situation of our initial example above, for instance, consists \nof, among other things, the objects in Anne's office \n— notably Anne herself, her desk and her computer, with her \nseated at the former and typing on the latter — and at least \nsome of the things in the next room — notably, her husband and \nthe phone he is talking on. On this view, for one situation s \nto include another r is simply for r to be a (perhaps \nrather complex and distributed) physical part of s. The actual\nworld, then, as the limit of a series of increasingly more inclusive \nsituations in this sense, is simply the entire physical universe: all\nthe things that are some spatiotemporal distance from the objects in \nsome arbitrary initial situation, structured as they in fact are; and\nother possible worlds are things of exactly the same sort. Call this \nthe concretist intuition, as possible worlds are understood to\nbe concrete physical situations of a special sort.  \n\nThe originator and, by far, the best known proponent of concretism is\n\n David Lewis.\n For Lewis and, as noted, concretists generally, the actual world is \nthe concrete physical universe as it is, stretched out in space-time.\nAs he rather poetically expresses it (1986, 1):  \n\nThe actual world provides us with our most salient example of what a \npossible world is. But, for the concretist, other possible worlds are\nno different in kind from the actual world (ibid., 2):  \n\nIt is clear that spatiotemporal relations play a critical role in\nLewis's conception. However, it is important to note that Lewis\nunderstands such relations in a very broad and flexible way so as to\nallow, in particular, for the possibility of spirits and other\nentities that are typically thought of as non-spatial; so long as they\nare located in time, Lewis writes, “that is good enough”\n(ibid., 73). So with this caveat, let us say that that an\nobject a is connected if any two of its parts bear\nsome spatiotemporal relation to each other,[14] and that a is\nmaximal if none of its parts is spatiotemporally related to\nanything that is not also one of its parts. Then we have the following\nconcretist answers to our questions:  \n\nAnd, hence, to exist in a world is simply to be a part of it:  \n\nIt follows from AW1 (and reasonable assumptions) that distinct\nworlds do not overlap, spatiotemporally; that no spatiotemporal part \nof one world is part of \n another.[16]\n Moreover, given \n Lewis's counterfactual analysis of causation,\n it follows from this that objects in distinct worlds bear no causal \nrelations to one another; nothing that occurs in one world has any \ncausal impact on anything that occurs in any other world.  \n\nCritically, for Lewis, worlds and their denizens do not differ in the\nmanner in which they exist. The actual world does not enjoy a\nkind of privileged existence that sets it apart from other worlds.\nRather, what makes the actual world actual is simply that it is\nour world, the world that we happen to inhabit. Other worlds\nand their inhabitants exist just as robustly as we do, and in\nprecisely the same sense; all worlds and all of their denizens are\nequally real.[17] A significant semantic corollary of this\nthesis for Lewis is that the word ‘actual’ in the phrase\n‘the actual world’ does not indicate any special\nproperty of the actual world that distinguishes it from all\nother worlds; likewise, an assertion of the form ‘a is\nactual’ does not indicate any special property of the individual\na that distinguishes it from the objects existing in other\nworlds. Rather, ‘actual’ is simply an indexical\nwhose extension is determined by the context of utterance. Thus, the\nreferent of ‘the actual world’ in a given utterance is\nsimply the world of the speaker, just as the referent of an utterance\nof ‘the present moment’ is the moment of the utterance;\nlikewise, an utterance of the form ‘a is actual’\nindicates only that a shares the same world as the speaker.\nThe speaker thereby ascribes no special property to a but,\nessentially, expresses no more than when she utters ‘a is\nhere’, understood in the broadest possible sense. By\nthe same token, when we speak of non-actual possibilia —\nLewis's preferred label for the denizens of possible worlds — we\nsimply pick out those objects that are not here in the\nbroadest sense. In the mouth of an other-worldly metaphysician, we\nhere are all among the non-actual possibilia of which she\nspeaks in her lectures on de re modality.  \n\nModal Reductionism and Counterparts. Lewis parted ways dramatically\n with his mentor\n W. V. O. Quine\n on modality. Quine (1960, §41) stands in a long line\n of philosophers dating back at least to\n David Hume\n who are skeptical, at best, of the idea that modality is an objective\nfeature of reality and, consequently, who question whether modal\nassertions in general can be objectively true or false, or even\ncoherent. Lewis, by contrast, wholly embraces the objectivity of\nmodality and the coherence of our modal discourse. What he denies,\nhowever, is that modality is a fundamentally irreducible\nfeature of the world. Lewis, that is, is a modal\nreductionist. For Lewis, modal notions are not primitive. Rather,\ntruth conditions for modal sentences can be given in terms of worlds\nand their parts; and worlds themselves, Lewis claims, are defined\nentirely in non-modal terms. The earliest presentation of Lewis's\ntheory of modality (Lewis 1968) — reflecting Quine's\n\n method of regimentation\n — offers, rather than a possible world semantics, a scheme for \ntranslating sentences in the language of modal predicate logic\ninto sentences of ordinary first-order logic in which the modal \noperators are replaced by explicit quantifiers over \n worlds.[18]\n The mature account of Lewis 1986 is much more semantic in orientation: it \navoids any talk of translation and offers instead a (somewhat \ninformal) account of concretist possible world truth conditions for a\nvariety of modal assertions. Nonetheless, it is useful to \nexpress the logical forms of these truth conditions explicitly in \nterms of worlds, existence in a world (in the sense of AE1, of\ncourse), and the counterpart relation, which will be \ndiscussed shortly:  \n\nFor sentences like \n (17)\n involving only de dicto modalities, Lewis's truth conditions \nare similar in form to the truth conditions generated by the modal \nclauses of basic possible world semantics; specifically, for (17):\n  \n\nAs in possible world semantics, the modal operators\n‘□’ and ‘◇’ “turn\ninto” quantifiers over worlds in concretist truth\nconditions (1986, 5). Also as in possible world semantics,\na quantifier (in effect) ranging over individuals that occurs \nin the scope of a quantifier (in effect) ranging over worlds\n— ‘∀x’ and\n‘∀w’, respectively, in (18) — is, for\neach value w of the bound world variable, restricted to the\nobjects existing in w. However, unlike possible world\nsemantics, predicates are not to be thought of as having different\nextensions at different worlds. Rather, for Lewis, each\n(n-place) predicate has a single extension that can contain\n(n-tuples of) objects across many different worlds —\nintuitively, all of the objects that have the property (or\nn-tuples of objects that stand in the relation) expressed by\nthe predicate across all possible worlds. Thus, in particular, the\npredicate ‘G’ picks out, not just this-worldly dogs\nbut other-worldly canines as well. Likewise, the pet predicate\n‘T’ picks out both actual and other-worldly\npets. Such a move is not feasible in basic possible world semantics,\nwhich is designed for a metaphysics in which one and the same\nindividual can exemplify a given property in some worlds in which they\nexist but not others. Hence, a typical predicate will be true of an\nindividual with respect to some worlds and false of it with respect to\nothers. But, for Lewis, as we've seen, distinct possible worlds do not\noverlap and, hence, objects are worldbound, thereby eliminating the\nneed to relativize predicate extensions to worlds.  \n\nHowever, this very feature of Lewis's account — \nworldboundedness — might appear to threaten its coherence. For \nexample, since Algol is in fact a pet, given worldboundedness and the\ndefinition \n AE1\n of existence in a world w, we have:  \n\nBut, according to Lewis's analysis, the modal operators\n‘□’ and ‘◇’, semantically, are\nquantifiers over worlds. Hence, (19) might appear to be exactly the\nconcretist truth condition for the denial of (the right conjunct of)\n(16), i.e., it might appear that, on Lewis's\nanalysis, Algol is not a pet accidentally but essentially; likewise,\nmore generally, any individual and any intuitively accidental property\nof that individual.  \n\nIn fact, Lewis whole-heartedly accepts that things have accidental \nproperties and, indeed, would accept that \n (16)\n is robustly true. His explanation involves one of the most \ninteresting and provocative elements of his theory: the doctrine of \ncounterparts. Roughly, an object y in a world \nw2 is a counterpart of an object x in \nw1 if y resembles x and nothing else \nin w2 resembles x more than \n y.[19] \n Each object is thus\nits own (not necessarily unique) counterpart in the world it inhabits\nbut will typically differ in important ways from its other-wordly \ncounterparts. A typical other-worldly counterpart of Algol, for \nexample, might resemble her very closely up to some point in her \nhistory — a point, say, after which she continued to live out \nher life as a stray instead of being brought home by our kindly \ndog-lover John. Hence, sentences making de re assertions about\nwhat Algol might have done or what she could or could \nnot have been are unpacked, semantically, as sentences about her \ncounterparts in other possible worlds. Thus, when we analyze \n(16) accordingly, we have the entirely unproblematic concretist truth\ncondition:  \n\nAscriptions of essential properties, as in \n (15),\n are likewise unpacked in terms of counterparts: to say that Algol is \na dog essentially is to say that  \n\nThe Analysis of Intensions. Lewis's possible world truth\nconditions are expressed in classical non-modal logic and, hence, they\nare to be interpreted by means of standard Tarskian semantics.  Thus,\nn-place predicates π are assigned extensions\nEπ — in particular, for 1-place predicates,\nsets of individuals — as their semantic values, as described in\nthe exposition in §1.2 above. However,\ngiven worldboundedness and the fact that predicate extensions are\ndrawn not simply from the actual world but from all possible worlds,\nthese extensions are able to serve as intensions in Lewis's\ntheory. As in basic possible world semantics, intensional entities in\ngeneral can be defined in terms of the basic ontology of the theory\nindependent of the linguistic roles they can play as the intensions of\npredicates. And because individuals are worldbound, Lewis is able to\nsimplify the definitions given in §1.3 by defining intensions as sets\nrather than functions:  \n\nThus, on this analysis, a proposition p is true in a\nworld w just in case w ∈ p and an individual\na has a property P just in case a ∈\nP. (Note that propositions are thus simply properties of worlds\non these definitions.)  a has P accidentally\njust in case a ∈ P but b ∉ P\nfor some other-worldly counterpart of b of a; and\na has P essentially if b ∈ P\nfor every counterpart b of a.  \n\nIn Lewis's theory of modality, then, modal operators are understood \nsemantically to be quantifiers over concrete worlds, predicates \ndenote intensions understood as sets of (n-tuples of) parts of\nthose worlds, and sentences involving de re modalities are \nunderstood in terms of counterparts. To the extent that these notions\nare free of modality, Lewis has arguably reduced modal notions to \nnon-modal.  \n\nThat Lewis's truth conditions for modal statements are themselves free\nof modality and, hence, that his theory counts as a genuine reduction\nof modal notions to non-modal is not terribly controversial (albeit\nnot undisputed — see Lycan 1991, 224–27; Divers and Melia\n2002, 22–24). Significantly more controversial, and perhaps far\nmore critical to the project, is whether or not his account is\ncomplete, that is, whether or not, for all modal statements\nφ, (i) if φ is intuitively true, then its Lewisian truth\ncondition holds (ii) if φ is intuitively false, then its Lewisian\ntruth condition fails.[21] \nThe challenge to Lewis, then, is that his\naccount can be considered successful only if it is complete\nin this sense.  \n\nThe chief question Lewis faces in this regard is whether there are \nenough worlds to do the job. The truth condition \n (20)\n for the intuitively true \n (16)\n says that there exists a possible world in which a counterpart of \nAlgol is no one's pet. By virtue of what in Lewis's theory does such \na world exist? The ideal answer for Lewis would be that some \nprinciple in his theory guarantees a plenitude of worlds, a \nmaximally abundant array of worlds that leaves “no gaps in \nlogical space; no vacancies where a world might have been, but \nisn't” (Lewis 1986, 86). From this it would follow that the \nworlds required by the concretist truth condition for any intuitive \nmodal truth exist. Toward this end, Lewis initially considers the \nevocative principle:  \n\nSince, in particular, a world satisfying (20)\nseems quite obviously to be a way a world could be, by Ways\nsuch a world exists. But there is a fatal flaw here: Lewis himself\n(1973, 84) identifies ways that a world could be with worlds\nthemselves. So understood, Ways collapses into the triviality\nthat every world is identical to some\n world.[22] \n\nLewis finds a replacement for Ways in a principle of \nrecombination whereby “patching together parts of \ndifferent possible worlds yields another possible world” (1986,\n87–88). The principle has two aspects. The first is the principle \nthat “anything can coexist with anything”. For “if \nthere could be a dragon, and there could be a unicorn,” Lewis \nwrites, “but there couldn't be a dragon and a unicorn side by \nside, that would be ... a failure of plenitude” (ibid., \n88). Given that individuals are worldbound, however, the principle is\nexpressed more rigorously (and more generally) in terms of \nother-worldly duplicates:  \n\nThe second aspect of the principle expresses “the Humean denial\nof necessary connections” (ibid., 87), that is, the idea\nthat anything can fail to coexist with anything else. For \n“if there could be a talking head contiguous to the rest of a \nliving human body, but there couldn't be a talking head separate from\nthe rest of a human body, that too would be a failure of \nplenitude” (ibid). To express this a bit more \nrigorously, say that objects a1, \na2, ..., are independent of objects \nb1, b2, ..., if no sum of any \nparts of the former are parts or duplicates of any sum of any parts \nof the latter and vice versa; then we have:  \n\nWorlds that satisfy the concretist truth conditions for workaday \npossibilities like \n (16)\n are easily conceived as consisting of duplicates of relevant parts of\nthe actual world — suitably organized to retain their actual \nproperties, or not, as needed. Hence, the existence of such worlds \ndoes indeed appear to follow from the existence of the actual world \nby recombination. Worlds containing talking donkeys, exotic species \nresulting from a wholly different evolutionary history, worlds with \nsilicon-based life forms, and so on present a bigger challenge to the\nview. Nonetheless, it is not entirely implausible to think such \nworlds exist given suitable duplication and reorganization of \nmicrophysical \n objects.[23] \n\nWhether recombination completely captures our modal intuitions\nregarding plenitude is still a matter of some dispute.[24] However, even if it\ndoesn't, it is less than clear whether this counts against the success\nof Lewis's reductionist project. For, as a realist about worlds, Lewis\ndoes not seem to be under any obligation to “derive”\nplenitude from more fundamental principles.  Hence, there is no\nobvious reason why he cannot respond to charges of incompleteness by\nsaying that it is simply a presupposition of his theory that logical\nspace has no gaps, that there are always enough worlds to satisfy the\nconcretist truth condition for any intuitive modal truth.[25] So understood, the\nrole of recombination for a realist about worlds like Lewis is\nsomething like the role of such axioms as powerset and replacement for\na realist about sets: given some sets, these principles provide us\nwith a detailed — but always less than complete —\ncharacterization of what further sets there are. Their role,\ntherefore, is to give us insight into the richness and diversity of\nset theoretic space, not a complete mechanism for proving which\nparticular sets do or do not exist. Likewise recombination\nvis-à-vis worlds and logical space.\n  \n\nLewis's theory is particularly commendable for its striking \noriginality and ingenuity and for the simple and straightforward \nanswers AW1 and AE1 that it provides to our two \nquestions QW and QE above. Furthermore, because worlds \nare (plausibly) defined entirely in nonmodal terms, the truth \nconditions provided by Lewis's translation scheme themselves appear \nto be free of any implicit modality. Hence, unlike many other popular\naccounts of possible worlds (notably, the abstractionist accounts \ndiscussed in the following section), Lewis's promises to provide a \ngenuine analysis of the modal operators.  \n\nPerhaps the biggest — if not the most philosophically \nsophisticated — challenge to Lewis's theory is “the \nincredulous stare”, i.e., less colorfully put, the fact that \nits ontology is wildly at variance with common sense. Lewis faces \nthis objection head on: His theory of worlds, he acknowledges, \n“does disagree, to an extreme extent, with firm common \nsense opinion about what there is” (1986, 133). However, Lewis \nargues that no other theory explains so much so economically. With \nworlds in one's philosophical toolkit, one is able to provide elegant\nexplanations of a wide variety of metaphysical, semantical, and \nintentional phenomena. As high as the intuitive cost is, Lewis (135) \nconcludes, the existence of worlds “ought to be accepted as \ntrue. The theoretical benefits are worth it.”  \n\nAdditional discussion of, and objections to, concretism can be found \nin the supplemental document \n Further Problems for Concretism.\n  \n\nA rather different set of intuitions about situations is that they \nare abstract entities of a certain sort: They are \nstates or conditions, of varying detail and \ncomplexity, that a concrete world could be in — they are \nways that things, as a whole, could \n be.[26]\n Thus, returning to our original example, one very simple way things \ncould be is for our philosopher Anne to be in her office. We can now \nimagine, as in our example, further detail being successively added \nto that description to yield more complex ways things could be: Anne \nworking at her desk in her office; music being in the background; her\nhusband being on the phone in the next room; her neighbor mowing the \nlawn next door; and so on. Roughly speaking, then, a possible world \nfor an abstractionist is the limit of such a \n“process” of consistently extending and adding detail to \nsome initial state of the world; it is a total way things \ncould be, a consistent state of the world that settles every \npossibility; a consistent state to which no further detail could be \nadded without rendering it inconsistent.  \n\nTo give the notion of a state, or condition, of the world a little \nmore metaphysical substance, abstractionists typically appeal to more\ntraditional ontological categories. Thus, for example, that things \ncould be in the simple state described above might be spelled out in \none of the following ways:  \n\nPossible worlds are then defined as special cases of the type of\nentity in question that are in some relevant sense total.\nAdams (1974), for example, defines possible worlds to be consistent\nsets of propositions that are total in the sense of containing, for\nevery proposition p, either p or its negation; Fine\n(1977), fleshing out ideas of Prior, defines a possible world to be a\nconsistent proposition w that is total in the sense that, for\nevery proposition p, w entails either p or its\nnegation. For purposes here, however, we will sketch the fundamentals\nof the abstractionist view in terms of states of affairs,\nfollowing the basic features of the account developed by Plantinga\n(1974, 1976), an account that, in the literature, frequently serves as\na particularly trenchant abstractionist counterpoint to Lewis's\nconcretism.[27] \n\nStates of affairs (SOAs) are abstract, intensional entities typically\nsignified by sentential gerundives like “Algol's being John's \npet” and “There being more than ten solar planets”.\nImportantly, SOAs constitute a primitive ontological category for the\nabstractionist; they are not defined in terms of possible worlds in \nthe manner that propositions are in \n §1.3.\n Just as some propositions are true and others are not, some SOAs are \nactual and others are \n not.[28] \n Note, then, that to\nsay an SOA is non-actual is not to say that it does not \nactually exist. It is simply to say that it is not, in fact,\na condition, or state, that the concrete world is actually in. \nHowever, because ‘____ is actual’ is often used simply to\nmean ‘____ exists’, there is considerable potential for \nconfusion here. So, henceforth, to express that an SOA is actual we \nwill usually say that it obtains.  \n\nAn SOA is said to be possible (necessary, \nimpossible) insofar as it is possible (necessary, impossible) \nthat it obtain. One SOA s is said to include another \nt if, necessarily, s obtains only if t does; \ns precludes t if, necessarily, s obtains \nonly if t doesn't. So, for example, Algol's being John's \npet includes Algol's being someone's pet and precludes \nthere being no pets. Thus, on the abstractionist's \nunderstanding of a situation as a state or condition of the physical \nworld rather than a concrete, structured piece of it, the inclusion \nof one situation in another is a purely logical relation, not \na \n mereological\n one. Finally, say that an SOA s is total if, for every \nSOA t, s either includes or precludes t. \n(Abstractionists often use ‘maximal’ instead of \n‘total’, but we have already introduced this term in the \ncontext of concretism.) Abstractionist possible worlds are now \ndefinable straightaway:  \n\nIt is easy to see that this definition covers the more intuitive \ncharacterizations of abstract possible worlds above: they are \nconsistent — i.e., possible — states of the world that \nsettle every possibility, consistent states to which no further \ndetail could be added without rendering them inconsistent. Note also \nthat, for the abstractionist, as for the concretist, the actual \nworld is no different in kind from any other possible world; all \npossible worlds exist, and in precisely the same sense as the actual \nworld. The actual world is simply the total possible SOA that, in \nfact, obtains. And non-actual worlds are simply those total possible \nSOAs that do not.  \n\nWhat of existence in such worlds? As we've seen, on Lewis's account, \nto exist in a concrete world w is literally to exist in \nw, that is, within the spatiotemporal boundaries of \nw. Clearly, because SOAs are abstract, individuals cannot \nexist in abstractionist worlds in anything like the same literal, \nmereological sense. Accordingly, the abstractionist defines existence\nin a world simply to be a special case of the inclusion relation:  \n\nUnlike concretism, then, abstractionism does not entail that \nindividuals are worldbound; there is no inconsistency whatever in the\nidea that many distinct worlds can include the existence of one and \nthe same individual. Indeed, typically, abstractionists are staunchly\ncommitted to transworld identity and hold that most any given \nindividual exists in many possible worlds and, moreover, that \ncontingent individuals, at least, can exemplify very different \nproperties from world to world. Abstractionists, therefore, have no\nneed to appeal to counterparts to understand de re modalities \nand can therefore accept the truth conditions for such modalities \ngiven by basic possible world semantics (spelled out, of course, in \nterms of their definitions AW2 and AE2). In particular, \nthey can take the standard possible world truth condition for, e.g., \nthe right conjunct of \n (16)\n at face value: ‘◇(E!a ∧ ¬Ta)’\nis true on the abstractionist's approach if and only if there is is a\nworld in which Algol herself, rather than some counterpart of hers, \nexists but fails to be anyone's pet.  \n\nIt is important to note that the possible worlds of abstractionism do\nnot yield a reductive analysis of modality. The reason for this is\nclear: abstract possible worlds are defined in irreducibly modal terms\n— a possible world is an SOA that (among other things)\npossibly obtains; or a set of propositions such that it is\npossible that all of its members are true; or a property that\nis possibly exemplified; and so on. Hence, unpacked in terms\nof the abstractionist's definitions, the possible world truth\nconditions for modal propositions are themselves irreducibly modal.\nFor example, when we unpack Plantinga's definition of a possible world\nin the semantic clause for sentences of the form\n⌈◻ψ⌉ in order to derive\nthe truth condition for (17),\n‘□∀x(Gx → Mx)’, we\nend up with this:  \nIf we now unpack the modal operators in (22) using the corresponding\ntruth conditional clauses of standard possible world semantics, the\nresult will contain further world quantifiers. And spelling out those\nworld quantifiers in turn using Plantinga’s definition will\nre-introduce those same modal operators yet again. \n\nMore generally, and a bit more exactly, put: As noted above, the \nlogical framework of basic possible world semantics is classical \npredicate logic. The logical framework of abstractionism is modal \npredicate logic. Hence, if possible world semantics is supplemented \nwith abstractionist definitions of possible worlds, then the logical \nframework of possible world semantics becomes modal predicate logic \nas well and, as a consequence, the extensionality of the semantics is\nlost once again. (This point is expressed somewhat more formally in \nthe supplemental document \n The Intensionality of Abstractionist Possible World Semantics.)\n Since, as noted above, the central motivation for possible world \nsemantics was to deliver an extensional semantics for modal \nlanguages, any motivation for abstractionism as a semantic theory is \narguably undermined.[30] \n\nHowever, it is not entirely clear that this observation constitutes an\nobjection to abstractionism. For abstractionists can argue that the\ngoal of their analysis is the converse of the reductionist's goal: The\nreductionist wants to understand modality in terms of worlds; the\nabstractionist, by contrast, wants to understand worlds in terms of\nmodality. That is, abstractionists can argue that we begin with a\nprimitive notion of modality and, typically upon a certain amount of\nphilosophical reflection, we subsequently discover an intimate\nconnection to the notion of a possible world, as revealed in the\nprinciples Nec\nand Poss. The analysis that\nabstractionists provide is designed to make this connection explicit,\nideally, in such a way that Nec and Poss fall out as\ntheorems of their theory (see, e.g., Plantinga 1985 and Menzel and Zalta\n2014).  \n\nHand in glove with the irreducible nature of modality is the nature \nof intensional entities. Concretists define intensional entities in \nterms of worlds, as described in \n §2.1.3.\n Abstractionists, by contrast, define worlds in terms of intensional \nentities. This divergence in their choice of ontological primitives \nreflects, not only their differing stances toward modality, but also \nan important methodological difference with regard to metaphysical \ninquiry. The concretist is far more pragmatic; notions of \nproperty, relation, proposition, and the \nlike play certain roles in our theorizing and are subject to a \n“jumble of conflicting desiderata” (Lewis 1986, \n54). Within a given theory, any entities that can play those roles \nfruitfully for the purposes at hand are justifiably identified with \nthose notions — regardless of how well they comport with \npre-theoretic intuitions. Thus, Lewis finds it to be a strength of \nhis position that he is able to adopt the set theoretic definitions \nin §2.1.3. By contrast, at least some abstractionists — \nPlantinga (1987) perhaps most notably — believe that we have \nintuitive, pre-theoretic knowledge of intensional entities that \nprecludes their being identified with set theoretic constructions of \nany \n sort.[31]\n (See Stalnaker 1976 for a particularly illuminating discussion of the\ncontrast between concretism and abstractionism with respect to the \ntreatment intensional entities.)  \n\nAs was noted in \n §2.1.2,\n for the concretist, there is no special property of the actual world \n— actuality — that distinguishes it, in any \nabsolute sense, from all of the others; it is simply the world that \nwe inhabit. For abstractionists, however, actuality \nis a special property that distinguishes exactly one \npossible world from all others — the actual world is the only \nworld that happens to obtain; it is the one and only way \nthings could be that is the way things as a whole, in fact, \nare. However, for most abstractionists, the distinctiveness \nof the actual world does not lie simply in its actuality but in its \nontological comprehensiveness: the actual world encompasses all that \nthere is. In a word: most abstractionists are actualists.  \n\n Actualism\n is the thesis that everything that there is, everything that has \nbeing in any sense, is actual. In terms of possible worlds: \nEverything that exists in any world exists in the actual \n world.[32]\n Possibilism, by contrast, is the denial of actualism; it is the \nthesis that there are mere possibilia, i.e., things that are \nnot actual, things that exist in other possible worlds but fail to \nexist in the actual world. Concretists are obviously not actualists \n(on their understanding of ‘actual’, at any \n rate).[33]\n Indeed, for the concretist, since individuals are worldbound, \neverything that exists in any nonactual possible world is distinct \nfrom everything in the actual world. However, although possibilism \nand abstractionism are entirely compatible — Zalta (1983), for \nexample, embraces both positions — abstractionists \ntend to be actualists. The reason for this is clear: Basic \npossible world semantics appears to be committed to possibilism and \nabstractionism promises a way of avoiding that commitment.  \n\nThe specter of possibilism first arises with regard to\nnon-actual possible worlds, which would seem by definition to\nbe prime examples of mere possibilia. However, we have just\nseen that the abstractionist can avoid this apparent commitment to\npossibilism by defining possible worlds to be SOAs of a certain sort.\nSo defined, non-actual worlds, i.e., worlds that fail to obtain, can\nstill actually exist. Hence, the commitment of basic possible world\nsemantics to non-actual worlds does not in itself threaten the\nactualist's ontological scruples.  \n\nHowever, the specter of possibilism is not so easily exorcised. For \nnon-actual worlds are not the only, or even the most compelling, \nexamples of mere possibilia that seem to emerge out of basic \npossible world semantics. For instance, it is quite reasonable to \nthink that evolution could have taken a very different course (or, if\nyou like, that God could have made very different creative choices) \nand that there could have been individuals — call them \nExotics — that are biologically very different from \nall actually existing individuals; so different, in fact, that no \nactually existing thing could possibly have been an Exotic. According\nto basic possible world semantics, the sentence ‘There could \nhave been Exotics’ or, more formally,  \n\nis true just in case there is a world in which \n‘∃xEx’ is true, i.e., when all is said and \ndone, just in case:  \n\nwhich, a bit less formally, is simply to say that  \n\nHowever, since no actually existing thing could have been an Exotic, \nanything that is an Exotic in some possible world cannot be among the\nthings that exist in the actual world. Thus, the truth conditions \nthat basic possible world semantics assigns to some of our intuitive \nmodal beliefs appear to entail that there are non-actual individuals \nas well as non-actual possible worlds. Defining possible worlds as \nSOAs provided a way for the actualist to embrace non-actual worlds \nwithout compromising her actualism. But how is the actualist to \nunderstand the apparent commitment to non-actual individuals\nin such truth conditions as (25)?  \n\nAnswers that have been given to this question represent a rather deep\ndivide between actualist abstractionists. On the one hand, \n“trace” actualists introduce actually existing entities \ninto their ontologies that can play the role of mere \npossibilia in (25) and its like. Trace actualists come in two \nvarieties: new actualists and haecceitists. New \nactualists like Linsky and Zalta (1996) and Williamson (1998, 2000, \n2013) argue that, in fact, all individuals are actually existing, \nnecessary beings but not all of them are necessarily \nconcrete. Some concrete individuals — those \ntraditionally (mis-)categorized as \ncontingent beings — are only contingently concrete. Likewise, \nsome non-concrete individuals — those, like possible Exotics, \ntraditionally (mis-)categorized as \ncontingently non-actual mere possibilia — are only \ncontingently \n non-concrete.[34] \n\nThis novel take on modal metaphysics allows the new actualist to \nreinterpret possible world semantics so as to avoid possibilism. \nNotably, the domain d(w) of a world w is \nunderstood not as the set of things that exist in w — \nfor all individuals exist in all worlds — but the set of things\nthat are concrete in \n w.[35]\n Hence, for the new actualist, the correct truth condition for \n (23)\n is:  \n\nOn the other hand, haecceitists like Plantinga introduce special \nproperties — haecceities — to similar ends. The haecceity\nof an individual a is the property of being that very \nindividual, the property being a. A property is a \nhaecceity, then, just in case it is possible that it is the \nhaecceity of some \n individual.[36]\n It is a necessary truth that everything has a haecceity. More \nimportantly, for haecceitists, haecceities are necessary beings. \nThus, not only is it the case that, had any particular individual \na failed to exist, its haecceity ha would \nstill have existed, it is also the case that, for any “merely \npossible” individual a, there is an actually existing \nhaecceity that would have been a's haecceity had a \nexisted. More generally (and more carefully) put: Necessarily, for \nany individual a, (i) a has a haecceity h and \n(ii) necessarily, h exists.  \n\nLike the new actualists, then, the metaphysics of the haecceitists enables \nthem to systematically reinterpret possible world semantics in such a \nway that the truth conditions of modal discourse are expressed solely\nin term of actually existing entities of some sort rather than actual\nand non-actual individuals. More specifically, for the haecceitist, \nthe domain d(w) of a world w is taken to be the \nset of haecceities that are exemplified in w, that \nis, the set of haecceities h such that w includes \nh's being exemplified. Likewise, the w-extension\nof a (1-place) predicate π is taken to be a set of \nhaecceities — intuitively, those haecceities that are \ncoexemplified in w with the property expressed by π. So \nreinterpreted, the truth condition for \n (23)\n is:  \n\nBy contrast, “no-trace”, or strict, actualists \nlike Prior (1957), Adams (1981), and Fitch (1996) hew closely to the \nintuition that, had a contingent individual a failed to exist,\nthere would have been absolutely no trace, no metaphysical vestige, \nof a — neither a itself in some non-concrete \nstate nor any abstract proxy for a. Hence, unlike trace \nactualism, there are no such vestiges in the actual world of objects \nthat are not actual but only could have been.\nThe logical consequences for no-trace actualists, however, appear to \nbe severe; at the least they cannot provide a standard \n compositional\n semantics for modal languages, according to which (roughly) the \nmeaning of a sentence is determined by its logical form and the \nmeanings of its semantically significant constituents. In particular,\nif there is nothing to play the role of a “possible \nExotic”, nothing that is, or represents, an Exotic in some \nother possible world — a mere possibile, a contingently \nnon-concrete individual, an unexemplified haecceity — then the \nstrict actualist cannot provide standard, compositional truth \nconditions for quantified propositions like \n (23)\n that yield the intuitively correct truth value. For, understood \ncompositionally, \n (23)\n is true if and only if ‘∃xEx’ is true at \nsome world w. And that, in turn, is true at w if and \nonly if ‘Ex’ is true at w for some value of\n‘x’. But, as just noted, for the strict actualist,\nthere is no such value of ‘x’. Hence, for the \nstrict actualist, ‘Ex’ is false at w for \nall values of ‘x’ and, hence, \n (23)\n is false as well. (These issues are explored in much greater detail \nin \n §4\n of the entry \n Actualism.)\n  \n\nLike concretism, abstractionism provides a reasonably clear and \nintuitive account of what worlds are and what it is to exist in them,\nalbeit from a decidedly different perspective. Although, as noted in \n §2.2.2,\n the fact that modality is a primitive in abstractionist definitions \nof possible worlds arguably compromises its ability to provide semantically \nilluminating truth conditions for the modal operators, those definitions\ncan be taken to illuminate the connection between our basic modality concepts\nand the evocative notion of a possible world that serves as such a\npowerful conceptual tool for \nconstructing philosophical arguments and for analyzing and developing\nsolutions to philosophical problems. In this regard, particularly \nnoteworthy are: Plantinga's (1974) influential work on \n the ontological argument\n and the free will defense against \n the problem of evil;\n Adams' (1974, 1981) work on \n actualism\n and actuality; and Stalnaker's (1968, 1987) work on \n counterfactual conditionals\n and \n mental content.\n  \n\nA number of important objections have been voiced in regard to \nabstractionism. Some of these are addressed in the document \n Problems with Abstractionism.\n  \n\nAs its name might suggest, our third approach —\ncombinatorialism — takes possible worlds to be\nrecombinations, or rearrangements, of certain metaphysical\nsimples. Both the nature of simples and the nature of recombination\nvary from theory to theory. Quine (1968) and Cresswell (1972), for\nexample, suggest taking simples to be space-time points (modeled,\nperhaps, as triples of real numbers) and worlds themselves to be\narbitrary sets of such points, each set thought of intuitively as a\nway that matter could be distributed throughout space-time. (A world\nw, so construed, then, is actual just in case a\nspace-time point p is a member of w if and only if\np is occupied by matter.) Alternatively, some philosophers\ndefine states a world could be in, and possible worlds themselves,\nsimply to be maximally consistent sets of\n sentences[37] \nin an expressively\nrich language — “recombinations”, certainly, of the\nsentences of the language. (Lewis refers to this view as\nlinguistic\n ersatzism.[38]) \nHowever, the predominant version of\ncombinatorialism finds its origins in Russell's (1918/1919) theory of\nlogical atomism and Wittgenstein's\n(1921, 1922, 1974) short but enormously influential\n Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.\nA suggestive paper by Skyrms (1981) spelling out some of the ideas in\nthe Tractatus, in turn, inspired a rich and sophisticated\naccount that is developed and defended in great detail in an important\nseries of books and articles by D. M. Armstrong (1978a, 1978b, 1986a,\n1989, 1997, 2004b, 2004c). In this section, we present a somewhat\nsimplified version of combinatorialism that draws primarily upon\nArmstrong's work. Unless otherwise noted, this is what we shall mean\nby ‘combinatorialism’ for the remainder.  \n\nWittgenstein famously asserted that the world is the totality of \nfacts, not of things (ibid., §1.1). The \ncombinatorialist spells out Wittgenstein's aphorism explicitly in \nterms of an ontology of objects (a.k.a., particulars), universals \n(a.k.a., properties and relations), and facts. Facts are either \natomic or molecular. Every atomic fact — Sachverhalt, in\nthe language of the Tractatus — is \n“constituted” by an n-place relation (= property, \nfor n=1) and n objects that stand in, or \nexemplify, that relation. Thus, for example, suppose that \nJohn is 1.8 meters tall. Then, in addition to John and the property \nbeing 1.8 meters tall, there is for the combinatorialist the \natomic fact of John's exemplifying that property. More generally, \natomic facts exist according to the following principle:  \n\nSay that the ai are the constituent \nobjects of the fact in question and R its constituent \nuniversal, and that R and the ai \nall exist in \n[R,a1,...,an].  \n\nA fact is monadic if its constituent universal is a \nproperty. A molecular fact f is a conjunction of \natomic facts. Its constituent objects and universals are exactly \nthose of its conjuncts and an entity exists in f just in case \nit exists in one of its conjuncts. (For simplicity, we stipulate that\nan atomic fact has (only) itself as a conjunct and, hence, is \n“trivially” molecular.) One fact f includes\nanother g if every conjunct of g is a conjunct of \nf. (Note, importantly, that inclusion, so defined, is quite \ndifferent from the homonymous notion defined in the discussion of \nabstractionism above — most notably, combinatorial inclusion is\nnot a modal notion.) For purposes below, say that an object \na is a bare particular in a molecular fact f \nif there is no monadic conjunct of f of which a is the \nconstituent object, no conjunct of the form a exemplifies F, \nfor some property F. a is a bare particular if\nit is bare in every molecular fact. Intuitively, of course, a bare \nparticular is an unpropertied object.  \n\nThere is no upper bound on the “size” of a molecular fact\nand no restriction on which atomic facts can form a conjunction; for \nany atomic facts at all, there is a molecular fact whose conjuncts \nare exactly those facts. As a first cut, then, we can spell out \nWittgenstein's characterization of the (actual) world as the totality\nof facts by defining the world to be the largest molecular fact, the \nmolecular fact that includes all of the atomic \n facts.[39] \n\nAlthough objects and universals are typically included along with \nfacts in the basic ontology of combinatorialism, facts are typically \nconsidered more fundamental. Indeed, taking his queue from the \nTractarian thesis that the world consists of facts, not things, \nArmstrong (1986a, 577) argues that facts alone are ontologically \nbasic and that objects and universals are simply “aspects of, \nabstractions from” facts. Accordingly, he calls the object \nconstituent of a fact of the form [P,a] a \n“thin” particular, an object “considered in \nabstraction from all its [intrinsic] properties” (1993, 433); \nand where N is the conjunction of “all the non-relational \nproperties of that particular (which would presumably include \nP), the atomic fact a's exemplifying N itself is the \ncorresponding “thick” particular ” (ibid., \n434 — we will occasionally use italics to distinguish a thin \nparticular a from the corresponding thick particular \na). Though not all combinatorialists of every stripe buy into \nArmstrong's “factualist” metaphysics (Bricker 2006), they\ndo generally agree that facts are more fundamental, at least to the \nextent that both the notion of a bare particular, i.e., an object \nexemplifying no properties, and that of an unexemplified property are\nconsidered incoherent; insofar as they exist at all, the existence of\nboth particulars and universals depends on their \n“occurring” in some fact or other. Whatever their exact \nontological status, it is an important combinatorialist thesis that \nexactly what objects and universals exist is ultimately a \nmatter for natural science, not metaphysics, to decide.  \n\nObjects can be either simple or complex. An object is simple \nif it has no proper parts, and complex otherwise. Like \nobjects, universals too divide into simple and complex. A universal \nis simple if it has no other universal as a constituent, and complex \notherwise. Complex universals accordingly come in two varieties: \nconjunctive — the constituents of which are simply its \nconjuncts — and structural. A structural universal U is \none that is exemplified by a complex object O, and its \nconstituents are universals (distinct from U) exemplified by \nsimple parts of O that are relevant to O's being an \ninstance of \n U.[40]\n It is important to note that, for Armstrong, the constituency \nrelation is not the mereological parthood relation. Rather, complex \nuniversals (hence also complex facts of which they are constituents) \nenjoy a “non-mereological mode of composition” (1997, \n119–123) that, in particular, allows for a richer conception of\ntheir \n structure.[41]\n (An assumption of our simplified account here will be that both the \nproper part of relation and the constituency relation are \nwell-founded. It follows that (i) there is no \n gunk,\n i.e., that every complex object is composed, ultimately, entirely of \nsimples and (ii) complex universals — hence the complex facts \nin which they are exemplified — are ultimately \n“grounded” in simple facts, i.e., that they cannot be \ninfinitely decomposed into further complex \n universals/facts.[42])\n  \n\nTo illustrate the basic idea: in Figure 1, the left-hand diagram \ndepicts a water molecule W comprising an oxygen atom o \nand two hydrogen atoms h1 and h2.\nFor the combinatorialist, “thick” particulars like the \nmolecule itself as well as its constituent atoms are themselves \nfacts: o is the fact [O,o] in which the \nuniversal oxygen (O) is exemplified by a thin \nparticular \n o;[43]\n likewise h1 and h2. W in \nturn comprises those monadic facts and the relational facts \n[B,o,h1], \n[B,o,h2] wherein the covalent bonding\nrelation B holds between the oxygen atom and the two hydrogen \natoms. The structural universal Water itself, then, shares \nthis structure — it is, so to say, an isomorph \nconsisting of the monadic universals O and H and the \nbinary relation B, structured as indicated in the right-hand \ndiagram of Figure \n 1.[44] \n\n  \n\nFigure 1: A Water Molecule W and the Structural Universal \nWater  \n\nIt should be clear from \n principle AF\n that all atomic facts hold; that is, all of them reflect \nactual exemplification relations. Obviously, however, possibility \nencompasses more than what is actual, that is, there are \npossible facts as well as actual facts; the world's \nuniversals might have been exemplified by its objects very \ndifferently. If they had — if the world's objects and \nuniversals had combined in a very different way — there would \nhave been a very different set of atomic facts and, hence, a very \ndifferent world.  \n\nTo spell out the idea of a possible fact, the combinatorialist \nintroduces the more general notion of an atomic (combinatorial) \nstate of affairs, that is, an entity that simply has the \nform of an atomic fact — n objects exemplifying\nan n-place relation — but without any requirement that \nthe exemplification relation in question actually holds between them.\nMore exactly:  \n\nThus, even if the two hydrogen atoms h1 and \nh2 in a water molecule do not in fact stand in the \ncovalent bonding relation B, there is nonetheless the \n(non-factual) state of affairs \n[B,h1,h2].  \n\nCombinatorialism takes facts to be literal, structured parts of the \nphysical world. This suggests that a non-factual state of affairs \n— a merely possible fact — must be part of a \nmerely possible physical world. This idea is at odds with the strong,\nscientifically-grounded form of actualism that typically motivates \ncombinatorialism. Two options are available: The combinatorialist can\nfollow the (actualist) abstractionists and define states of affairs \nto be philosophical or mathematical constructs consisting only of \nactual objects, properties, relations, and facts. For example, the \nstate of affairs \n[R,a1,...,an] can \nsimply be identified with the ordered n-tuple \n〈R,a1,...,an〉.\nSo long as the combinatorialist is willing to adopt the additional \nmetaphysical or set theoretic machinery, this sort of approach offers\na way of introducing non-factual states of affairs that does not \ninvolve any untoward ontological commitments to merely possible \nentities. Alternatively, following Armstrong (1989, 46–51; \n1997, 172–4), the combinatorialist can refuse to grant \nnon-factual states of affairs any genuine ontological status and \nadopt a form of \n  modal fictionalism\n that nonetheless permits one to speak as if such states of \naffairs exist. The exposition to follow will remain largely neutral \nbetween these options.  \n\nConstituency for states of affairs is understood as for facts. \nAdditionally, analogous to molecular facts, there are molecular \nstates of affairs — conjunctions of atomic states of affairs. \nInclusion between states of affairs is understood exactly as it is \nbetween facts and being a bare particular in a molecular \nstate of affairs s is understood as for facts: a is a \nbare particular in s if there is no monadic conjunct of \ns of the form a exemplifies F. The notion of \nrecombination is now definable straightaway:  \n\nVery roughly then, a possible world will be a certain sort of \nrecombination of (some portion of) the actual world, the \nmolecular fact that includes all of the atomic facts. This idea will \nbe refined in the following sections.  \n\nSay that a state of affairs is structural if it is atomic and \nits constituent universal is structural or it is molecular and \nincludes a structural state of affairs; and say that it is \nsimple otherwise. The difference between structural and simple\nuniversals and states of affairs is particularly significant with \nregard to the important concept of supervenience (Armstrong \n1989, Ch \n 8).[45]\n Entity or entities S supervene on entity or entities R \nif and only if the existence of R necessitates that of \nS (ibid., 103). (Necessitation here is, of course, \nultimately to be spelled out in terms of combinatorial possible \nworlds.) Non-structural states of affairs supervene directly on their\natomic \n conjuncts.[46]\n However, things are not in general quite so straightforward for \nstructural states of affairs. For, although structural states of \naffairs are ultimately constituted entirely by simple states of \naffairs, unlike non-structural states of affairs, structural states \nof affairs typically supervene on more than the totality of their \nconstituents. For, in many cases, whether or not a structural fact \nexists depends not only on the existence of its constituent facts but\nalso on the absence of certain others (Armstrong 1997, \n34ff). For example, as noted in our example above, our water molecule\nW comprises two further facts in which two hydrogen atoms \nh1 and h2 both stand in the \ncovalent binding relation with an oxygen atom o. However, if \no were to bind with a further hydrogen atom \nh3, then, despite the fact that the constituent \nfacts of W would still hold, W would not be water; \nthere would be no such fact as W's being \n water.[47]\n Rather, W would exist only as a complex part of a hydronium \nion; the new binding [B,o,h3] would, \nso to say, “spoil” the instantiation of Water. \nThus, more generally, whether or not a structural state of affairs \nS exists in a possible world typically requires something over\nand above its constituent states of affairs being “welded \ntogether” in the right sort of way (Armstrong, 1997, 36); it \nrequires also that there be no relevant “spoilers” for \n S.[48]\n Armstrong draws directly on the initial passages of the \n Tractatus[49]\n for the necessary apparatus: a structural state of affairs S \nin any possible world w, supervenes, not simply on its \nconstituent atomic states of affairs but on a certain \nhigher-order state of affairs Tw, \nnamely, the state of affairs that the (first-order) atomic states of \naffairs of w are all the (first-order) atomic states of \naffairs and, hence, that w includes no spoilers for \nS. Armstrong (ibid., 35, 134–5, 196–201) calls \nTw the totality state of affairs for the \natomic states of affairs of \n w.[50] \n\nThe idea of possibility being rooted in arbitrary recombinations of \nthe actual world, rearrangements of its objects and universals, is \nintuitively appealing. Clearly, however, not just any such \nrecombination can count as a possible world. Some states of affairs \nare intuitively impossible — [being an elephant, \ne], where e is an individual electron, say — and \nsome pairs of states of affairs, while individually possible, are not\ncompossible — the states of affairs [having 1kg \nmass, a] and [having 2kg mass, a] for a \ngiven object a, or, for a given mereological sum m of \nsimples, the states of affairs [being a baboon, m] and \n[being a hoolock, m]. But nothing that has been said \nrules out the existence of recombinations of the actual world —\nrearrangements of its objects and universals — that include \nsuch states of affairs. Obviously, however, such recombinations \ncannot be thought to represent genuinely possible worlds. Of course, \nlike the abstractionist, the combinatorialist could simply stipulate \nas part of the definition that all legitimate recombinations must be \ngenuinely possible states of affairs of a certain sort, \ngenuinely possible recombinations. But this will not do. \nFor, like concretism, combinatorialism purports to be a \nreductive account of modality, an account of possible worlds\nthat does not depend ultimately on modal notions (see Armstrong 1989,\n\n 33).[51] \n\nHere the distinction between simple and structural states of affairs \ntogether with the combinatorialist's strong notion of supervenience \ncome to the fore. For, given that structural facts supervene on \nsimple facts and the actual totality fact T@, the \nactual world can be defined more parsimoniously as the molecular fact\nthat includes all the simple atomic facts and the totality \nfact T@. And at the level of simples, there are no \nlimitations whatever on recombination (Wittgenstein 1921, \n2.062-2.063); hence, any recombination of simple objects and \nuniversals is by definition considered possible. Thus Armstrong \n(1986a, 579):  \n\nWorlds, in particular, can be defined as special cases of such \nrecombinations, together with appropriate totality facts. To state \nthis, we need a condition that ensures the existence of a unique \nactual world:  \n\nGiven this, we have:  \nArmstrong's ontological commitments are \nnotoriously rather slippery but, given AW3, a reasonably \ncomplete notion of existence in a world is forthcoming. First, let us\nnote that, for Armstrong, the “combinatorial idea” yields\na substantial metaphysical thesis, as well, viz., the ontological\nfree lunch (1986, 12ff), i.e., the thesis that “[w]hat \nsupervenes is no addition of being”; that “whatever \nsupervenes ... is not something ontologically additional to the \nsubvenient entity or entities.” Hence, for Armstrong, it \nappears that simple states of affairs and their constituents\nexist most fundamentally and that the existence of more complex \nentities is in a certain sense derivative. Thus:  \nGiven this, existence in a world \ngenerally — both fundamental and derivative — both for \nsimples and \n (first-order[53])\n non-simples alike, is definable as follows:  \n\nSemantics \nreceives rather short shrift in Armstrong's version of \ncombinatorialism — at least, semantics in the model theoretic \nsense of \n §1.2\n — but, as it has played an important role in our discussion of \nconcretism and abstractionism, we note briefly how the ontology of \ncombinatorialism might be taken to populate a possible world \ninterpretation of the language of modal predicate logic. \nSpecifically, we can take the range of the modal operators — \nunderstood, semantically, as quantifiers — to be all of the \ncombinatorial possible worlds in the sense of AW3. The domain \nd(w) of each world w is the set of all simple \nand complex objects that exist in w according to AE3 \nand the w-extension Iπ(w) of a \npredicate π expressing a simple or complex universal R is \nthe set of all n-tuples, 〈a1, ..., \nan〉 such that the atomic fact \n[R,a1,...,an] \nexists in w.  \n\n There are, then, for the combinatorialist no intrinsically modal \nphenomena; there are just all of the various worlds that exist on \nunrestricted combinatorial grounds alone. Ultimately, all genuine \npossibilities, simple or not, are just states of affairs that exist \nin these combinatorial worlds in the sense of AE3. However, it\nis not immediately as clear how to understand many intuitive \nnecessities/impossibilities involving complex \nstructural universals, for example, the impossibilities noted in the \nprevious section, viz., that something simultaneously have a mass of \nboth 1kg and 2kg or simultaneously be both a baboon and a hoolock. \nLikewise, it is not entirely clear how combinatorialism accounts for \nintuitive facts about essential properties, such as that our water \nmolecule W is essentially water or that Algol is essentially a\ndog. Combinatorialists argue that such modal facts can nevertheless \nbe explained in terms that require no appeal to primitive modal \nfeatures of the world (Armstrong 2004b, 15).  \n\nAnalytic Modalities.  Armstrong argues that many \nintuitive modal facts — notably, the impossibility of an object\nexemplifying more than one determinate of the same determinable \n— can be understood ultimately as logical, or analytic, \nmodalities that are grounded in meaning rather than any primitive \nmodal features of reality. For example, intuitively it is impossible \nthat an object simultaneously exemplify the structural properties \nhaving 2kg mass and having 1kg mass. The combinatorial \nreason for this (cf. Armstrong 1989, 79) is that, for an object \na to exemplify the former property is simply for there to be a\ndivision of a into two wholly distinct parts, both of which \nexemplify the latter property. Moreover, this division into parts is \nentirely arbitrary, that is, for any part a1\nof a exemplifying having 1kg mass, there is a (unique) \npart a2 of a wholly distinct from \na1 that also exemplifies that property. It follows \nthat, if our 2kg object a itself also exemplifies \nhaving 1kg mass, then, as a is a part of itself, there \nmust be a 1kg part of a that is wholly distinct from a.\nAnd that is analytically false, false “solely by virtue of the \nmeaning we attach to” the word ‘part’ \n(ibid., \n 80).[54] \n\n \n Emergent Modalities.   Combinatorialism purports to \nexplain a further class of intuitive modal facts as features that \nsimply “emerge” from facts about structural \n properties.[55]\n The discussion of structural states of affairs and supervenience \nabove provides an example. Let us suppose the actual world \nw1 includes our water molecule W from Figure\n1 plus a further hydrogen atom h3. In this world, \nonly h1 and h2 bind to o. \nHence, this world includes the state of affairs W's being \nwater but not the state of affairs I's being hydronium in \nwhich o, h1, h2, and \nh3 are so bonded as to constitute a hydronium ion \nI. Conversely, however, given the unrestricted nature of \nrecombination, there is a world w2 that includes \nW structured as it actually is in w1 but \nwhich also includes the spoiler \n[B,o,h3] — where o and \nh3 bond — and, hence, the structural state of\naffairs I's being hydronium. Thus, the absence of \n[B,o,h3] in w1 \nenables the emergence of W's being water and precludes I's \nbeing hydronium whilst its presence in w2 \nenables the emergence of the latter but precludes the former. As a \nconsequence, it is impossible that the states of affairs W's \nbeing water and I's being hydronium \n coexist.[56] \n\nFigure 2: W's being water and (given a bond between o \nand h3) I's being hydronium  \n\nAlthough more dramatic, large-scale examples of \nincompatible states of affairs — such as a thing's being \nsimultaneously both a baboon and a hoolock — might be vastly \nmore complex, there is no obvious reason why their impossibility \ncould not have the same sort of combinatorial explanation.  \n\nEssential Properties.   It follows from the \nunrestricted nature of recombination that, for any simple object \na and simple universal P, a recombines with \nP in some worlds and fails to recombine with P in \nothers. Generalizing from this fact, it follows that no simple or sum\nof simples has any simple universal or conjunction of simple \nuniversals essentially. It also follows that no such object has any \nstructural property essentially. For assume o is such an \nobject and that it exemplifies a structural property P. Since \nP is structural, it supervenes on some set of simple states of\naffairs. But by the nature of recombination, there are combinatorial \nworlds in which those states of affairs do not exist and, hence, in \nwhich P doesn't but o — being a simple or a sum \nof simples — does.  \n\n \n Thick particulars like our water molecule W don't fare much \nbetter because of the possibility of spoilers. For Armstrong (1997, \n35), W is simply the conjunction of its constituent states of \naffairs. As we've just seen, however, in the presence of spoilers, \nthat conjunction would exist — hence, W would exist \n— without being Water. Hence, it would seem that at \nleast some properties that, intuitively, are essential to their \nbearers turn out not to be for the combinatorialist. The problem is \ncompounded by the fact that some intuitively non-essential properties\nof some thick particulars are arguably essential for the \ncombinatorialist. The shape properties of a thick particular \nA, for example, would seem to be a function of its constituent\nstates of affairs. Moreover, the exemplification of such properties \nare not obviously subject to spoilers the way that natural kind \nproperties like Water are. Hence, as A is identical to \nthe conjunction of its constituent states of affairs, it would seem \nthat it will have the same shape in any world in which it exists, \ni.e., it will have that shape essentially.  \n\nThat said, combinatorialism can arguably provide a reasonably robust \nanalysis of intuitions about the essential properties of ordinary \nthick particulars like dogs or persons. Such objects can be taken to \nbe temporal successions of sums of simples and each sum in the \nsuccession as its temporal parts. Sums in the same rough temporal\nneighborhood are composed of roughly the same simples and are \nstructured in roughly the same way. Similarities between such objects\nacross worlds in turn determine counterpart relations. Following \nLewis, the essential properties of such objects can then be \nidentified with those properties exemplified by (all of the temporal \nparts of) all of its counterparts in every world in which it exists \n(Armstrong 1997, 99–103, \n 169).[57] \n \n Since a possible world is a recombination of the actual world and \nevery recombination includes states of affairs involving every simple\nindividual and every simple universal, by AE3, every simple \nentity exists in every world. Hence, there could not have been fewer \nof them; nor could there have been simples other than the ones there \nactually are. In this section, we address this issue and the issue of\ncontingent existence generally in combinatorialism.  \n\nFewer things.  Combinatorialism as it stands has no \nproblem accounting for the general intuition that there could have \nbeen fewer things. We have already noted in \n §2.3.3\n and again in \n §2.3.5\n how our water molecule W, as such, might not have existed. \nMore generally, given the unrestricted nature of recombination, for \nany a involving a structural fact S, there are \nrecombinations of the actual world wherein either (a) some of the \nrelations among a's constituents that are critical to \nS's structure fail to be exemplified by those constituents, or\n(b) there are further states of affairs included by those \nrecombinations that act as spoilers for S. Consequently, the \ncombinatorialist seems to have no difficulty explaining how there \nmight have been fewer water molecules, humans, etc.  \n\nIntuitively, however, there isn't anything in the idea of a simple \nthat suggests that simples are necessary beings — especially \nif, as combinatorialists generally agree, simples are physical things\nof some sort and simple universals are properties of, and relations \namong, those things. For there is nothing in the nature of a simple \nobject to suggest that any given simple had to have existed. \nLikewise, there is nothing in the nature of a simple universal to \nsuggest it had to have been exemplified and, hence, on the \ncombinatorialist's own conception of universals, that it had to \nexist. Otherwise put, as simples exist only insofar as they are \nconstituents of facts, there seems no reason why there couldn't have \nbeen a very small number of facts, indeed, just a single simple, \natomic, monadic fact and, hence, a lone simple object and a lone \nsimple universal.  \n\nIn fact, however, AW3 can be easily modified to accomodate \nthese intuitions without doing any serious violence to \ncombinatorialist intuitions. Specifically, the combinatorialist can \nadmit “contracted” worlds in which fewer simples exist by\nallowing any recombination of any simple fact — that \nis, equivalently, by allowing any state of affairs — to count \nas a possible world:  \n \nAE3 requires no modification, as it was defined with \nsufficient generality above. Under AW3′, however, \nAE3 entails that all entities alike — objects and \nuniversals, simple and structural — are contingent and, indeed,\nthat every simple object is the sole constituent of some \ncombinatorial possible world.  \n\nOther things.  Intuitively, not only could there \nhave been fewer things, there could have been more things or, more \ngenerally, things other than those that actually exist. As \nabove, combinatorialism as it stands seems able to account for many \ninstances of this intuition: Figure 2 illustrates how a non-actual \nhydronium ion I might exist in another world. Likewise, there \nseems no reason to deny, e.g., that there are rearrangements w\nof the actual world's simples wherein exist all of the human beings \nthat actually exist (at, say, 0000GMT 1 January 2013) and more \nbesides that are composed of simples that, in fact, constitute things\nother than human beings (Armstrong 1997, \n 165).[58]\n Combinatorialism also seems able to account for the possibility of \nconjunctive and structural universals that are simply rearrangements \nof actual simples. It is not implausible to think that such \nrecombinations can give rise to, say, exotic biological kinds that \nhave no actual instances (Armstrong 1989, 55–56). Thus, in \nparticular, combinatorialism seems quite able to provide the truth \ncondition \n (24)\n for \n (23)\n and, hence, can account for some possibilities involving \n“missing” universals that, intuitively, ought to be \npossible.  \n\nHowever, it is far from clear that such possibilities exhaust the \nmodal intuition that other things could have existed. Notably, \nintuitively, there could have been different simple \nuniversals distinct from any that actually exist — different \nfundamental properties of simples, for example. Likewise for simple \nobjects. Either way, there seems to be nothing in the idea of a \nsimple object or simple universal that suggests there couldn't have \nbeen simples other than, or in addition to, the simples there are in \nfact. But AW3′ does not allow for this; the simples of \nevery possible world are a subset of the actual simples and there is \nno obvious way of modifying the principle to accommodate the \nintuition. Nor is there any obvious way of modifying the principle to\naccomodate the intuition in \n question.[59] \n\nThe combinatorialist could of course abandon actualism and include \nmerely possible simples into her ontology. Again, she could follow \nthe new actualists and draw a division between actually concrete and \nnon-actual, possibly concrete simples; or she could introduce \nPlantinga-style haecceities to go proxy for merely possible simples. \nBut all of these options would be badly out of step with the strong, \nnaturalist motivations for combinatorialism: There is but the one \nphysical world comprising all of the facts; recombinations of (at \nleast some of) those facts — arbitrary rearrangements of \ntheir simple objects and universals — determine the possible \nworlds. Mere possibilia, merely possible non-concretia,\nand non-qualitative haecceities have no real place in that picture.  \n\nThe “purest” option for the combinatorialist is simply to\nbrazen it out and argue that the actual simples are, in fact, all the\nsimples there could be (Armstrong 1989, 54ff; Driggers 2011, 56–61). \nA more robust option suggested by Skyrms (1981) makes some headway \nagainst the problem by introducing an “outer”, or \n“second-grade” realm of possibility, but at the cost of \nmoving beyond the basic intuitions of combinatorialism (Armstrong \n1989, 60; 1997, 165–167). Finally, Sider (2005, 681) suggests that \ncombinatorialists who (like Armstrong) are modal fictionalists can \ndeal with the problem of missing entities simply by appealing to yet \nmore fictionalism: As the combinatorialist fiction already \nincludes non-actual states of affairs with actually existing \nconstituents, there seems no reason not to extend the fiction to \ninclude non-actual states of affairs whose constituents include \nnon-actual particulars and universals. Fictionalism itself, however, \nleaves the combinatorialist with the deep problems detailed by Kim \n(1986), Lycan (1993), and Rosen \n (1993).[60] \n As with concretism and abstractionism, combinatorialism provides \nreasonably clear definitions of possible worlds and existence in a \nworld and is noteworthy for its attempt to avoid what might be \nthought of as the metaphysical excesses of the two competing views. \nIn contrast to concretism, combinatorialism is staunchly actualist: \ninstead of an infinity of alternative physical universes, each with \nits own unique inhabitants existing as robustly as the inhabitants of\nthe actual world, the worlds of combinatorialism are simply \nrearrangements of the universals and particulars of the actual world;\nand commitment even to them might be avoided if some version \nof fictionalism is tenable. Likewise, in contrast to abstractionism's \nrather rich and unrestrained ontology of SOAs, combinatorialism's \nstates of affairs are comparatively modest. Moreover, in contrast to \nnearly all versions of abstractionism, combinatorialism shares with \nconcretism the virtue of a reductive theory of modality: Modal \nstatements, ultimately, are true or false in virtue of how things \nstand with respect to worlds that are themselves defined in non-modal\nterms.  \n\nCombinatorialism's ontological modesty, however, is also a weakness. \nFor, unlike, the two competing approaches, there are modal intuitions\nthat the combinatorialist is not easily able to account for, notably,\nthe intuition that there could have been other things. Additional \ndifficulties are discussed in the supplemental document \n Further Problems for Combinatorialism.\n ","contact.mail":"cmenzel@tamu.edu","contact.domain":"tamu.edu"}]
