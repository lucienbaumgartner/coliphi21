Is such access to health care a requirement of\nsocial justice, or is it simply a matter of social policy that some\ncountries adopt and others do not? If it is a requirement of social\njustice, we should be clear about what kinds of care we owe people and\nhow we determine what care is owed if we cannot possibly meet every\nhealth need, as arguably no society can. We should be clear about what\nconstitutes appropriate access to that care, given that there are\ndiverse barriers to access. We must also be able to say why we owe\nthese things as a matter of justice, and, of course, different\naccounts of social justice will bake and serve this cake in different\nways.\n\n\nIn what follows, we shall address these questions in the following\norder. In Section 1, we describe briefly what some societies actually\ndo to assure universal access to health care. Although health care is\nmore equally distributed in these societies than other social goods,\nnevertheless health inequalities persist across demographic groups.\nThis implies a question we shall have to address: if universal access\ncannot assure equality in health status, because there are other\nimportant social determinants of population health and its\ndistribution, then is universal access a requirement of justice after\nall? We shall also examine some of the consequences of unequal access\nto care, for these may compound the effects of inequitable\ndistributions of other determinants of health. In Section 2, we\nexamine more carefully the concept of access to care. How, for\nexample, do we actually tell if access to care is equal or equitable?\nThe problem of measuring access to care aside, we might think that the\nconcept of equal access is straightforwardly analyzed, and the concept\nof equitable access depends in a more complex way on what inequalities\nin access are permissible. We shall see, however, that considerations\nof justice bear on judgments about equal access as well as on those\nabout equitable access. In Section 3, we examine three different lines\nof argument for universal access. In Section 4, we consider what kinds\nof care these views, especially the opportunity-based account, imply\nthat we owe each other. In Section 5, we consider whether we have a\nright to health or health care, in light of those views of justice,\nand what entitlements follow from such a right if there is one.\n\nWe might seek guidance from how some societies assure access to care,\nkeeping in mind that what societies actually do may not coincide with\nwhat they should do as a matter of justice. If, however, there is\nwidespread belief that people owe each other access to certain kinds\nof care, and this belief is embodied in institutions that attempt to\ndo that, it may give us some evidence about what people think they owe\neach other. Of course, we find different institutional provisions of\naccess in different settings, and the differences may not reflect\ndifferences in belief as much as differences in resources or social\nhistory. \nNearly all developed countries provide all their residents with access\nto a broad set of public health and individual medical interventions.\nIn these countries access to care is assured despite income and wealth\ninequalities through universal coverage health systems. The method of\nfinancing these universal access systems, as well as their\norganizational structure, varies considerably. Some systems are funded\nthrough general tax revenues as in Canada; others through payroll\ntaxes, as in several European countries; and others through a mix of\npublic and private insurance schemes, as in Germany. Thus some systems\nare more progressively financed than others, since general tax\nrevenues are more progressive than social security or payroll taxes,\nand these in turn are more progressive than insurance premiums. (In a\nprogressive tax scheme, the rate increases as the amount that is\ntaxable increases.) Some systems have public ownership of hospitals,\nwith physicians and nurses as salaried employees of the public system,\nas in the United Kingdom or Norway. Others contain a mix of public and\nprivate institutions, though with extensive public regulation of the\nbenefit packages available to people, as in Germany. Some systems\nallow no insurance schemes except the universal coverage scheme, as in\nCanada and until recently Norway; others allow supplementary\ninsurance, as in the United Kingdom. \nThough all of these health care systems assure universal access to all\ncitizens, their benefit packages vary. Sometimes, the variations occur\nat the level of specific treatments. For example, one system might\ndecide a particular drug for Alzheimer’s is not cost-worthy,\nwhereas other systems might provide it. Sometimes the differences\ninvolve whole categories of service. For example, the Canadian\nnational law requires coverage only for inpatient drugs, not\noutpatient ones; different provinces provide different levels of\ncoverage for what is omitted from the national schemes. Similarly,\nlong-term care is not part of the national Canadian system, though\nsome Canadian provinces, but not all, provide long-term care. The U.S.\nMedicare system provides nearly universal coverage to the American\nelderly, but until 2006, when the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act\nbecame effective, it excluded drugs from its benefit package (Medicare\n2003). All universal coverage systems exclude certain categories of\nservice, such as cosmetic surgery (as opposed to reconstructive\nplastic surgery). In general, then, where systems provide universal\naccess, it is access for all to a specific set of benefits that varies\nfrom country to country, not to every service people may need or\nwant. \nIt is not only the wealthy, industrialized countries that assure\nuniversal access to a broad range of personal medical services.\nRecently, middle-income countries such as South Korea and Taiwan have\nadopted universal coverage insurance schemes. Thailand and Mexico have\nalso added insurance schemes aimed at covering the nearly half of\ntheir populations that had not been covered in the social security\nschemes and other insurance schemes that are used by civil servants or\nlarge employers. The benefit package in these different schemes is\noften not equal across these components of the health system, but the\navowed goal is to close gaps in access and incrementally to approach\nequality of access. \nThe WHO advocates universal coverage in low- and middle-income\ncountries as well as in richer countries (WHO 2010). A key issue in\nthese efforts is the comprehensiveness of the benefit package, which\nin some reforms is a “thin” benefit package that may not\ncover many needed services and that requires significant out-of-pocket\npayments even for covered services. An ongoing policy debate will have\nto address efforts to “thicken” the benefit package along\nthe three dimensions that define it: the number of people covered, the\ntypes of services covered, and the amount of co-pays or deductibles\nfor covered services. Disagreements with the ethical guidance WHO\n(Ottersen, Norheim, et al. 2014) has provided about how to\n“thicken” the benefit package will no doubt be part of\nthat policy debate. Reasonable people will disagree how to trade\nimprovements on each dimension against the others, and a process will\nbe needed to resolve these disagreements. A related issue is whether\nthe health system can sustainably deliver the benefit package the\ninsurance scheme is committed to deliver. \nFor many years, the United States stood alone among wealthy developed\ncountries in not providing universal coverage through some form of\nhealth-care insurance. Nearly 50 million people, mostly the employed\npoor and near poor (Selden and Sing 2008), were uninsured as of 2010\n(we note that he number is greater than the population of S. Korea,\nwhich has universal health care coverage). The uninsured are not shut\nout of health care altogether, since they obtain some care at public\nhospitals (EMTALA 1986) and neighborhood clinics, but, according to\nthe Institute of Medicine (IOM 2002), the medical care they receive is\n“too little, too late.” Being sicker when care is\nobtained, or getting inadequate continuity of care has a significant\nimpact on their health outcomes, leading to higher morbidity and\nmortality rates, to say nothing of the greater cost of care. \nIn 2010, however, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)\npassed into law through a reconciliation act. It contains an\nindividual mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health care\ninsurance on penalty of a having to pay a special tax, expands\nMedicaid (which is a means-tested health insurance program for the\npoor jointly funded by states and the Federal government) coverage to\nan intended 16 million people, establishes insurance exchanges to sell\ninsurance, much of it subsidized, to another intended 16 million\npeople, prohibits insurers from denying coverage because of prior\nmedical conditions, and allows children to be on their parents’\ninsurance until age 26. A U.S. Supreme Court decision (National\nFederation of Independent Business vs Sebelius, Secretary of Health\nand Human Services, 2012) upheld the individual mandate, but ruled\nthat states had the prerogative to expand Medicaid and that such\nexpansion could not be a requirement of the ACA. The failure to expand\nMedicaid in some states and their ongoing opposition to the ACA meant\nthat the expansion of coverage did not reach the 32 million estimated.\nThe increased coverage of the ACA never included the estimated 12\nmillion unauthorized immigrants (Daniels and Ladin 2014), who are also\nexcluded from universal coverage plans in most countries). Given that\nmany of the estimated 12 million long-term unauthorized immigrants in\nthe U.S. count as members of the society, even if they are not\ncitizens, coverage in the U.S., even if the PPACA is fully\nimplemented, will not be truly universal. Nevertheless, unauthorized\nimmigrants still have access to emergency care at all U.S. hospitals\nbecause of EMTALA. \nOne of the largest groups of people excluded from access to insurance\ncoverage under the ACA is the group comprised of unauthorized\nimmigrants (who are also excluded from universal coverage plans in\nmost countries). Given that many of the estimated 12 million long-term\nunauthorized immigrants in the U.S. count as members of the society,\neven if they are not citizens, coverage in the U.S., even if the ACA\nis fully implemented, will not be truly universal. To be sure,\nunauthorized immigrants still have access to emergency care at all\nU.S. hospitals because of EMTALA. \nAfter the Trump Administration took office in 2017, there was an\neffort by it and the Republican Congress to repeal and replace the\nACA. The House, with a significant Republican majority, narrowly\npassed the American Health Care Act of 2017. The Senate version of it\nfailed to receive a majority of votes, and the efforts to repeal the\nACA and replace it later with a plan to be worked out also failed to\npass. Because President Trump has continued to threaten the ACA and\nthe Republican leadership in both houses put replacing the ACA high on\ntheir list of goals, arguably the victory of the ACA and its goal of\nreducing significantly the number of uninsured is not secure as of the\nsummer of 2017. (We return in Section 2 to discuss further the\nRepublican model of universal access, resting as it does on the\n“choice” to be uninsured.)  \nAside from financial barriers to access, there are several important\nkinds of non-financial barriers to access. These include forms of\ndiscrimination and exclusion, such as racism and gender-bias;\ngeographical barriers; and language and cultural barriers, including\ncultural attitudes toward disease and medical care. In the United\nState, for example, we know that the prevalence of certain health\nconditions is much higher among African Americans than whites.\nControlling for insurance coverage, income, and educational\ndifferences, African-Americans are still less likely to receive\nimportant treatments for a range of serious illnesses, including heart\ndisease and certain kinds of organ failure (IOM 2002). Just how to\nexplain these utilization disparities is a matter of ongoing research,\nsome of which focuses on conscious and unconscious attitudes and\nracial stereotypes. Until advocacy groups for women, such as the\nNational Breast Cancer Coalition, lobbied successfully to alter\nresearch funding policy, some women’s diseases were\nsystematically under funded in the U.S. Similarly, there are\nsignificant differences in access to care that derive from the\ngeographical maldistribution of providers, including physicians, and\nservices. Thus physicians concentrate their practices in wealthier\nurban and suburban areas, leaving poor urban and rural areas\nunderserved. Many hospitals face the problem of overcoming language\nbarriers because of the large and diverse immigrant populations that\nthey serve, and striking examples abound of failures to meet health\nneeds because of cultural views about disease and medical care\n(Fadiman 1997). \nAll of these kinds of barriers to access act as obstacles to providing\nadequate health care both in the U.S and in many developing countries.\nIf justice requires providing universal access to health care, then\nthese barriers must be addressed as a matter of justice. Some of these\nbarriers to care, such as geographical and cultural barriers, remain\nas such even in systems that aim to provide universal access. All of\nthem would have to be specifically addressed by any effort to move the\nU.S. system toward the provision of universal access. \nIt might be thought that the provision of universal access to a range\nof public health and personal medical services would go a long way\ntoward reducing health inequalities among different social groups,\nwhether ethnic or divided by socio-economic status. But, careful\nstudies in many countries, most dramatically in the United Kingdom,\nhave shown that health inequalities by class have not been reduced by\nthe presence of universal coverage through the British National Health\nService (Marmot 2004). Two longitudinal studies of British civil\nservants, known as the Whitehall Studies, have shown a pronounced\nsocio-economic gradient of health across different categories of\nworkers: the higher a worker’s occupational status, the longer\nand healthier her life. In addition, this difference is not explained\nby risk factors associated with occupational status, such as smoking\nrates or lipid levels or other “lifestyle choices.” Nor is\nthe gradient simply a result of “deprivation”—for\nnone of the civil servants are poor, lack basic education, or medical\ncare—and the gradient is present across all occupational\nlevels. \nThe Whitehall results are very robust and reveal a strong gradient of\nhealth across a wide range of morbidity and mortality measures. They\nare also consistent with findings found in many countries, both with\nand without universal coverage. All these findings show a strong\nimpact of non-health care determinants of health: income and wealth,\neducation, inclusion and exclusion, including discrimination against\nwomen and L.G. B. T. groups, social cohesiveness, and others. An\nimportant focus of research is to explain the mechanisms that might be\nat work in creating these health inequalities. The WHO Commission on\nthe Social Determinants of Health issued a final report in 2008 that\ncalled for various policy measures that improve daily living\nconditions and distribute more equitably money, power, and resources,\nas well as research aimed at better measuring the influence of these\nfactors and evaluating the impact of measures to redistribute these\ndeterminants of health more fairly (CSDH 2008). \nFor our purposes, however, the lesson to be drawn from the literature\non the social determinants of population health is that we cannot\nexpect health inequalities to disappear solely as a result of\nproviding universal access to care. Health care is not the only\nsocially controllable factor affecting population health and its\ndistribution. This leaves us with a question we shall have to address:\nif other factors besides health care are important determinants of\nhealth, then is the focus on providing universal access to health care\nmisplaced? Even if justice requires us to promote or protect health,\ndoes it require us to do so through the provision of access to health\ncare, or should we now modify our view of the importance of health\ncare in light of what we have learned from social epidemiology? We\nreturn to address this issue in Sections 3 and 4. \nIt will help to summarize the key points that emerge from this sketch\nof what different societies do to provide access to care. \nArguably, the goal of universal access to health care, as embodied in\nhealth systems in nearly all developed countries, is to secure equal\nor at least equitable access to needed care. How can we tell whether\nor not access to care is equal? What should we count as equitable\naccess, if this involves departures from equal access? We might hope\nthat it is relatively unproblematic to determine when access to care\nis equal, as it is, for example, with income, and that equitable\naccess would then consist of allowable or justifiable inequalities in\naccess. As we shall see in this Section, giving an account of equal\naccess, let alone equitable access, is not so easy. \nConceptualizing and measuring access to care is more complex a task\nthan it might seem at first. In part, this is because health care is\nnon-homogeneous in its function, for it does quite different things\nfor us. In addition, there is disagreement about the nature of health\ncare as a social good: some think it is just a commodity, to be\npurchased in a market like other commodities; others claim it has a\nspecial moral importance that distinguishes it from some other market\ngoods. If we are to make sense out of claims that we owe each other\nequal or at least equitable access to care, and this means we must\novercome various barriers to access to care that create inequitable\naccess, then we need to be clear how to determine when access is\nunequal or unjustifiably unequal. \nIt is tempting to think that we can give a completely\nnon-controversial definition of equal access to health care—much\nas we can do for equality of income—and reserve all controversy\nfor debates about which departures from equality conform to acceptable\nprinciples of justice. If A earns $10,000 less than\nB, the inequality might be thought equitable by some if B\nworks longer or harder than A, by others if\nB’s skills have a higher market value than\nA’s, and by others if B needs more than\nA does. Here our moral disagreements about appropriate\ndistributive principles show up as disagreements about just or\nequitable income distribution, though there is no controversy about\nwhether incomes are equal. \nThe situation is arguably different for the notion of equal access to\nhealth care: to arrive at a notion of equal access, we must already\nhave made various decisions about what considerations ought to count\nin judging when access is equal. These decisions reflect our purpose\nor interest in making the judgment about equality, and some of these\ndiscriminations are themselves moral. So moral considerations are\nalready embedded in the specification of equal access and are not held\nat bay until we get to decisions about equity. \nTo see the point, consider what may seem to be a trivial example. Is\nthere equal access among department colleagues to the coffee in the\nlounge not far from Prof. A’s office? If there is no\nwheelchair access to the lounge, then a paraplegic colleague can\nreadily claim unequal access—and this claim has force even if\nshe drinks as much coffee as she wants because someone is willing to\nfetch it for her. What should we say about the fact that the coffee is\nonly ten feet from Prof. A’s office, but thirty from\nher junior colleague’s? Does it matter if one colleague hates\nthe color of the paint in the lounge but others do not? Does it matter\nthat one colleague has had negative experiences in the coffee lounge\non a previous job but other colleagues have not? If we view access to\ncoffee as meeting an important need, then we might worry about the\nunequal distances or the psychic burden of seeking the coffee, but if\nwe think coffee is only an amenity (leave aside addiction), then we\nmight not care about these other issues, even if they lead to\ndifferences in preferences for obtaining coffee and in coffee\nconsumption. How we think about the importance of drinking coffee\nmatters to us when we consider whether access to it is equal. \nThe same point applies to judgments about equal access to health care:\nsuch judgments presuppose some view about the moral importance of\nhealth care. Nevertheless, it is probably fair to say that all that\nmost people have in mind when they talk about equal access to health\ncare is a negative criterion, specifically that certain traditional\nconstraints on access, mainly financial, geographical, or\ndiscriminatory, should play a minimal role in determining whether\npeople who need health care get it. There may be implicit in this\nnegative characterization a positive ideal—for example,\n“any any two persons of comparable health status who want\nappropriate care have an equal chance of getting it.” But\nnothing so schematic may be in anyone’s mind at all; there may\nbe only a moral complaint against a particular inequality. Thus in\nmany cases there is agreement about what to call equal access only\nbecause there is agreement not to accept a particular kind of\ninequality. \nThe dominant conceptualization of equitable access to health care\namong health service researchers builds on the idea that the\nutilization of services should reflect actual needs for care (Aday and\nAnderson 1974, 1975, Aday 1975, Aday, Anderson and Fleming 1980, Aday\n2001, Aday et al. 2004). A prominent competing view, especially in the\nUnited States, is a modified market view that focuses on the\navailability in the market of a decent basic minimum of care (cf.\nEnthoven 1980). This modified market account is not to be confused\nwith a pure market view that allows all care to be determined by\nmarket forces, which might mean that some people do not even get a\ndecent basic minimum of care. However, even the modified market view\nallows for many inequalities of access to care that would be judged\ninequitable by the use-per-need view. A third model of equal,\nuniversal access can be derived from some things that have been said\nby Republicans determined to advance a model of universal access that\nrests on the “choice” to buy coverage (Bump 2017). Rather\nthan taking all to have insurance coverage as the model of universal\nand equal access to care, on this model the “choice” to\nbuy coverage is the key determinant of universality. It will be useful\nto examine the implications of these three prominent views of equity\nof access. \nConsider first the use-per-need view. On this view, use-per-need\nshould not be distorted by certain structural features of the health\nsystem, such as the distribution of providers or facilities or\nexclusionary attitudes they harbor, or by inappropriate disposing or\nenabling factors of individuals, such as their information about\nhealth care or their inability to communicate with providers, or their\nincome, or by such “process variables” as travel and\nwaiting time. The approach allows us to test whether or not a factor\npotentially affecting access, such as waiting time, actually does, for\nexample, if it produces an effect on actual utilization of the\nservices where need is held constant. Where distorting factors mean\nthat utilization of services is not determined by need, the\nuse-per-need view judges the access inequitable. In this way, the view\ncan be used analytically to test how important certain potential\naccess factors are, and it can be used normatively to make judgments\nabout equity of access. \nThe use-per-need approach is quite sensitive to what actual measures\nof both need and utilization are used. A process variable—for\nexample, time spent in a waiting room—may have a significant\neffect on measures of satisfaction with care (a subjective measure of\nactual access), but have relatively little effect on utilization rates\n(an objective measure of actual access). So the choice of objective or\nsubjective measures of realized access may yield different assessments\nof the importance of a process variable and, ultimately, of the equity\nof access to health-care services. Even if we are inclined to use an\nobjective measure, however, it matters which one. For example,\ncultural attitudes toward entering a sick role might have a greater\nimpact on disability days, as a measure of need, than they do on the\nmore serious level of need, bed-disability days. \nCritics of the use-per-need account argue that some process variables\nare important determinants of equity of access even if they do not\nhave a significant impact on utilization of services (Sloan and\nBentkover 1979). For example, even if waiting time does not interfere\nwith utilization, it may impose a significant burden on those seeking\ncare, and that burden may be inequitable. Another criticism of the\nuse-per-need account is the claim that uniformity in utilization rates\nis not even a necessary condition for equity of access. If some people\nare informed, yet averse to the utilization of medical services, then\ndifferences in their utilization rate from others should not count as\nan inequity of access. A further objection is that the approach\nabstracts from the effectiveness of care—it does not look at\nhealth status as an outcome, only the utilization of services. People\nwith different utilization rates may have the same health status as an\noutput simply because the care was ineffective, so measuring its rate\nof utilization does not tell us what really matters. \nThe rationale for the use-per-need view might appeal to an argument\nfrom function of the following sort: “The (main) function of\nhealth-care services is to prevent and cure illness, i.e., to meet\nhealth-care needs. A distribution of health-care services that is not\ndetermined by the distribution of health-care needs is therefore\nunreasonable in some important sense. One sense in which it is\nunreasonable is that it would defeat the purpose of meeting health\nneeds to provide access in ways not determined by the level or kinds\nof need people have. Another sense in which it is unreasonable is that\nit ignores similarities and differences—here in health\nstatus—between persons which, given the function of health care,\nought to be relevant to establishing its reasonable distribution.\nIgnoring such relevant similarities and differences is what it means\nfor a distribution to be inequitable.” A version of this\nargument is clearly foreshadowed in Bernard Williams’ (1971: 27)\nnow classic discussion of equality in which he concluded that,\n“leaving aside preventive medicine the proper ground of\ndistribution of medical care is health; this is a necessary\ntruth.” \nUnfortunately, this argument from function falls short of providing a\nbasis for the use-per-need view. The function of food processors is to\nmeet food processing needs, but no one believes that willingness to\npay for food processors is an inappropriate basis for distributing\nthem and that we must do so in proportion to the presence of\nvegetable-slicing needs in the population. The problem here is that\nmeeting some needs, but not others, matters as a concern of justice or\nequity. In the next section, we shall return to seek more persuasive\nfoundations for the use-per-need view. \nConsider next the modified market view, according to which we have\nequity of access to health care when a decent minimum is available to\nall in a market. Unlike the utilization rate approach, the market view\nis not really a position represented in the empirical literature on\naccess but rather a composite abstracted from views that are common in\nthe economics and health planning literature. Its interest lies in the\nquite different limits it places on the notion of equitable access and\nbecause of the quite different underlying view of health care and\ndistributive justice. \nI earlier noted that one objection to the utilization rate approach is\nthat similarity in intergroup use-per-need rates is not even a\nnecessary condition for equitable access (or distribution). One\nrationale for this claim is the view that health-care services are\ncommodities like any others. On this view, there is nothing so\n‘special’ about these services that cannot be accommodated\nby allowing a market for them to respond to people’s preferences\nfor them. On such a view, equity of access is assured if three main\nconditions obtain: (1) the commodity must be available at something\nlike “true social cost;” (2) individuals are capable of\nmaking rational (informed) decisions about using the system; (3)\nincome distribution must be (approximately) equitable. The second\ncondition requires that information about alternatives—for\nexample, therapies or insurance schemes—is available and that\npeople are competent and informed enough to make use of the\ninformation. Some access inequities arise when this condition is not\nmet and these must be addressed by public policy. (We shall see how\nthese conditions affect the philosophical arguments about prudential\ninsurance in the Section 3.) \nAside from the problem of subsidies to the poor to guarantee equitable\nincome distribution, the central problems of access are those brought\nabout by departures of the medical market from the ideal of a truly\ncompetitive market (Arrow 1963). In particular, there may be various\ndistortions on the supply side which amount to the market’s not\ndelivering services at their “true social cost.” For\nexample, rural populations or inner city minorities may not be able to\nget the care they want and can afford. They may not be able to get it\nin the desired quantities, or at the desired times with the\ncharacteristics they desire. \nViewed in this way, the problem is that the market is unresponsive to\nconsumer preferences on the supply side and interventions may be\nneeded to correct the problem, generally by addressing structural\nproblems in capital expenditure policy. A central problem here is the\nway in which the choice of a health insurance plan is tied to features\nof employment and the unavailability of an adequate range of\nplans—for example, ones that cover people between jobs. The\ncentral issues of access and equity of access are concerned with these\nsupply malfunctions of the market. (In Section 3, we shall see how\nDworkin (1994, 2000) attempts to avoid these market limitations.) \nThe third condition, about equitable income distribution, is rarely\naddressed in the literature. Obviously, if income redistribution\nbrings people only to the officially defined poverty level, it is\ninadequate to cover the costs of a decent basic minimum of care (this\nnotion is discussed further later in this section). If the transfer\nfalls short of this, we have an inequitable transfer. So the modified\nmarket view I am sketching is not that of the pure libertarian who\nmight reject all such transfers, but rather one in which there is\nimplicit acceptance of some important moral claims that might loosely\nbe characterized as “welfare rights.” \nAssuring equitable access in the ways defined by the market approach\nleaves extensive room for all sorts of departures from equitable\naccess as defined by the use-per-need approach. Surely, there may be\nvariations in the amenities that accompany healthcare services, if\nthat is how we want to look at (some) process variables such as\nwaiting time. Equal quality in these dimensions is surely not\nrequired, any more than everyone prefers equal quality in, say,\nautomobiles. Similarly, use-per-need rates may vary with suspect\nvariables like income or race and yet not indicate any inequity of\naccess, contrary to the use-per-need formulation. Rather, the unequal\ndistribution of health care in quantity and quality can be viewed\nmerely as the expression of different preference curves, just as food\nbudgets might vary among a welfare recipient, a factory worker, and a\nwealthy industrialist. If we take the underlying income distribution\nto be morally acceptable, its expression in terms of utilization of\nhealth services need indicate no inequity. \nPut succinctly, then, the market approach I am considering here comes\nto this: access to health care is equitable if and only if there are\nno information barriers, financial barriers, or supply anomalies that\nprevent access to a reasonable or decent basic minimum of health-care\nservices. How plausible such an account is depends on the\ncharacterization of such a decent minimum and the moral arguments\nmaintaining that provision of such a minimum is all that justice or\nequity demands. The problem facing the ‘market’ proponent\nthus appears to be the other side of the coin from the problem facing\nthe use-per-need account. If the market view suggests we owe each\nother on grounds of justice only a decent minimum, the use-per-need\nview suggests we owe much more—both require clear rationales.\nOne central problem with that account was its simplifying assumption\nthat health care is relatively homogeneous in function and that the\nproper basis for its distribution must be the realization of that\nfunction. A related problem for that account is its working assumption\nthat access can be equitable only if services of all kinds that happen\nto be offered in the system are distributed according to need. If,\nhowever, we want to treat health-care services as non-homogeneous in\nfunction, and we are willing to ground equity claims only by reference\nto some features of some of those services, we owe an account of how\nto draw the lines. \nThere are three ways to elucidate the notion of a decent basic\nminimum: (1) the provision of a general criterion by reference to\nwhich we can tell if services are within the minimum or are above it;\n(2) the simple listing the types of services included; or (3) the\ndescription of a fair procedure for determining the minimum. In the\nmarket literature—indeed in much of the literature—there\nis little attempt to give a general criterion or describe an\nappropriate, fair procedure. What attempts we get are far too vague.\nCharles Fried, in an early effort at characterization (1976:32),\nsuggests that the “decent minimum should reflect some conception\nof what constitutes tolerable life prospects in general. It should\nspeak quite strongly to things like maternal and child health which\nset the terms under which individuals will compete and develop.”\nThe characterization is not developed enough to tell when prospects\nare tolerable and for whom. \nEfforts to specify a decent basic minimum more commonly appeal to a\nlist of categories of services or to some “average” level\nof services in a particular health system. Neither of these approaches\nprovides a criterion that clarifies why these services are viewed as\ndecent and basic. Where there is appeal to a list, as in an early\nproposal by Enthoven (1980), the Consumer Choice Health Plan that\nsignificantly influenced the Clinton Administration efforts at health\nreform, it may derive from an earlier effort at regulation, such as\nthe 1973 HMO Act. It is typical of such appeals to lists that there is\nno rationale offered for why items are on the list. If mental health\nservices are included, we are often not told which ones; and there may\nbe categorical omissions, such as dental care, without\nexplanation. \nAppeals to an “average” insurance package similarly\nprovide no clear basis for deciding whether a set of benefits is truly\nappropriate to a decent minimum. For one thing, the average may\nreflect many features of a market that is not working well, capturing\nmuch that is wasteful, ineffective, or inappropriate in a system\nproviding care. It may also be the case that an average package omits\nsome crucial features of care, for example, certain mental health\nservices. Indeed, by focusing on services provided within a given\nsystem to “average” users, the concept of what we owe\npeople, that is, what counts as equitable treatment, is turned into a\ncompletely “interstitial” notion. We are told,\n“within the confines of this system, equity requires making this\npackage available, since it happens to be available on average”\nbut we are not in a more general way told that the system provides\npeople with what they should get, as a matter of justice. We are, in\neffect, told that a system that aims to meet certain needs should\ntreat people equitably in addressing those needs, but we are not told\nthat a system that is fair to people should perforce meet certain\nhealth needs. Nor are we given a process that might help us decide\nwhat to provide as a matter of justice where there may be disagreement\nabout equitable coverage. In short, neither lists nor averages\nsubstitute for an appeal to a defensible rationale or to a fair\nprocess for determining what should be covered. (We shall consider in\nSection 3 how the insurance approaches of Dworkin (1994) and Gibbard\n(1982) address these issues, since each approach is part of an\nargument to justify the appeal to equal access; the choice model takes\nequal access for granted and does not make an attempt to justify it,\nand so we do not discuss it in Section 3.) \nConsider now the third model of what we should count as equal access,\nwhich we refer to as the choice model. Actually, this model is couched\nas a version of universal access (as opposed to universal coverage),\nand we shall have to infer the notion of equality. So what is its\ncommitment to equality of access? The foundational intuition behind it\ncan be found in Paul Ryan’s words that no one should be forced\nto do what they don’t want to do. If the intuition focuses on\nwhat anyone wants to do, then there is a concern about equality after\nall. It cannot be an intuition that focuses only on what some people\nwant to do if they are rich enough to have certain choices. It rules\nout choice that is forced on individuals by their being unable to\nafford to do what they prefer to do. Such a forced choice was typical\nof what people faced on the individual insurance market before the ACA\nif they bought skimpy but affordable health insurance (e. g., high\ndeductible plans that are cheaper because they do not cover certain\nneeded services). For a choice to buy or not buy insurance coverage to\nbe a real choice on this view, both choices have to be ones people\ncould select, if they wanted to. This feature rules out a choice\nbetween a health care insurance scheme people cannot afford vs one\nthat they can afford. Subsidies must be available to those with\nlimited resources that make their choices real. This requirement makes\nthe model more expensive to implement than the Republican plans\nallowed. Real choice has costs given the income inequality that\nprevails in the U.S. The costs have a compensation that has a bearing\non “equality,” for everyone is equal in the choices that\nare possible for purchasing insurance, and individuals have more room\nto express other priorities than the purchase of health care.  \nThe real choices of some people to forego coverage actually make\nthings worse for those who need insurance and prefer to buy it, and\nthey create the need to fund subsidies for the foregone insurance\npurchase. We shall call “free riders” those who—for\nwhatever reason—do not share in the cost of the health system\nbut can share its benefits (needed health care) when ill. Suppose\nfurther that free riders can share the benefits of the health system\nby meeting some modest penalty for remaining uninsured. In short, free\nriders can pocket the cost of insurance minus the penalty, but still\nget care when they need it. Put another way, the health system must be\nready to treat all people, free riders or not, because that is the\nchoice of society. (We are assuming that few people would allow Free\nRiders to die in the streets, which would happen if they are not\nallowed to get care when they need it and have not purchased health\ncare insurance.) Free riders thus get a good bargain—some might say\nan incentive to free load—if they are given needed care when\nthey join a system they did not contribute to, except for facing a\nmodest punishment for not joining earlier. \nFree riders raise the costs of keeping the system ready for them, a\ncost that is paid by all who contribute to it by obtaining coverage in\nit. So the “real choice” of those who forego coverage (and\nbecome free riders) harms those who “choose” to pay for\ncoverage each year. These harms to others are encouraged whenever such\na choice is allowed. The replacement plans for the ACA in promoting\nsuch choices are premised on allowing these harms to third parties.\nThe price of encouraging some people to forego coverage is to\nencourage free riding and the resulting harms to third parties. \nTo conclude this section, we shall briefly consider what each of these\nthree approaches to access has to say about some race inequalities in\nhealth and health care that are found in the U.S. A first point to\nnote is that these accounts of access to health care do not inform us\nabout the origins of some important inequalities in health. For\nexample, certain health conditions, such as high blood pressure,\ndiabetes, and asthma are more prevalent among African Americans than\namong other racial groups in the U.S. However the differences are best\nexplained—by income differences, educational differences,\nlifestyle choices, some other environmental exposure to risks, or\nbiological differences in the susceptibility to those\nillnesses—if the difference is not the result of differences in\naccess to preventive services or treatments, then inequity in access\nto care is not the source of the health difference. A higher\nprevalence rate—or need—should lead to a higher\nutilization rate for relevant services, or else the use-per-need rates\nwould differ between African Americans and other groups. What the\nuse-per-need approach counsels us to do is to consider whether\ndifferences in the use-per-need rate are best accounted for by certain\nstructural features of the system (e.g. inadequate supplies of\nproviders in the areas where the population in need resides,\norganization of care that induces discontinuity of care,\ndiscriminatory attitudes of providers, including conscious or\nunconscious stereotyping), or by enabling or disposing features of the\nindividuals (income differences, insurance level differences,\neducational differences, age differences, attitudes toward disease and\ntreatment). If factors other than differences in need affect the\nuse-per-need rate, then we have strong grounds for thinking there is\nan unfair inequality in access to care. \nHow would the modified market view judge such differences? Differences\nacross types of insurance coverage (above the decent basic minimum\nlevel) that the use-per-need view would judge problematic might be\ndismissed as preference differences by the modified market view. Just\nas the household preferences and budget for food or clothing might\ndiffer across income and education levels, so too utilization of\nhealth services might differ—above the decent\nminimum—without the raised eyebrows evoked by unfair\ninequalities. If there is a quality difference—which might even\ntake the form of additional protection against health risk through\nbetter diagnosis or more continuous care—that might not be\nproblematic for the modified market view when it would be for the\nuse-per-need view. \nOn the third view that subsidizes all choices to buy insurance, the\nhigher prevalence of illness among some minorities in the U.S. would\npresumably lead them to make fewer choices to forego coverage and thus\nto purchase needed coverage more. That result might be explained, as\nit was on the market view, as a difference in preferences across\ngroups. In any case, it would not lead to the claim of unfairness. The\nopposition from the choice view is to the full range of subsidies that\nmake real choice possible.  \nIn this Section we shall examine three lines of argument that aim to\nshow that universal access to (at least some forms of) health care is\na requirement of justice. If one or more of these views establishes\nits claim, then the practice we have noted in many countries of\nfinancing institutions aimed at providing such access can be construed\nas an effort to meet, however imperfectly, a requirement of justice.\nWe shall not spend time, however, assessing views that deny such\nclaims altogether—noting only that some libertarian accounts of\njustice would reject redistributive efforts to promote health just as\nthey would redistributive efforts to promote other social\nobjectives. \nOne prominent line of argument in favor of universal access to some\nforms of health care builds on the contribution made by\nhealth—and derivatively by health care—to the\nopportunities people can exercise. The most explicit version of this\nargument extends Rawls’s appeal to a principle assuring fair\nequality of opportunity (Daniels 1981, 1985, 2008). Variants on that\nargument can be extrapolated from Sen’s (1980, 1992) work on\ncapabilities or from Arneson’s (1988) and Cohen’s (1989)\nversions of “equal opportunity for welfare or advantage,”\nthough there will be differences among these variants in what kinds of\ncare are covered and under what conditions. \nThe fair equality of opportunity argument for universal access can be\nsketched as follows: \nSome comments will clarify the main points in this sketch. First, the\nnarrow concept of health does not preclude the broad range of\ndeterminants of health noted in (3), yet the narrower notion is about\nwhat epidemiologists and public health planners measure and care. This\nnarrower concept of health avoids conflating health with well being\nmore generally, which the WHO definition of health arguably does\n(“Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social\nwell-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”)\n(WHO 1948). Obviously, though, normal functioning includes cognitive\nand emotional functioning and not just physical health, for we are\ncomplex social animals. Health remains a “limit” or\n“ceiling” concept, unlike income, for we cannot increase\nhealth indefinitely but must aim only for normal functioning for\nall. \nSecond, protecting and promoting normal functioning is not the only\nfactor affecting the range of opportunities open to people. Income,\neducation, and basic liberties, as well as other factors, do so as\nwell. Nevertheless, the loss of functioning or premature death that\nmay come with ill health clearly diminishes the range of plans of life\npeople can reasonably choose among in a given society. Accordingly,\nprotecting health protects opportunity, even if it is not the only\nthing that does so. A crucial feature of the argument is that we are\nconcerned about the health of all because we are concerned about\nprotecting the opportunity range of all. \nThird, we have learned much in the last several decades about the\nbroader social determinants of health (see entry by Sreenivasan on\nHealth Inequalities and Justice), especially that the presence of\nuniversal access in a society does not eliminate or significantly\nreduce health inequalities in it. Does the importance of other\nsocially controllable factors that affect population health and its\ndistribution mean that providing universal access to an appropriate\nset of public health and personal medical services is less important\n(see Sreenivasan 2007)? Suppose we learn that some expensive\nindividual interventions contribute less to protecting the opportunity\nrange of individuals than redistributing some other important goods\nthat are determinants of health. That might well mean that we should\nspend less on health care and redefine the benefit package we provide\nin a universal access system. But it should not mean that we abandon\nuniversal access to care, even if it means we ought to shrink the\nrange of medical services open to people in light of other ways to\nreduce risks of loss of functioning. No matter how justly we\ndistribute the broader determinants of health, some people will become\nill and others not. Universal access to reasonable care (given its\nrelative effectiveness compared to other things we may do) is still\nthe only way to assure people that certain health needs can be\nequitably met. \nFourth, the extension of Rawls’s theory introduces some\nmodification in the account of opportunity, but the modification is\nnot inconsistent with the thrust of justice as fairness. Justice as\nfairness abstracts from health status differences in its assumption\nthat agents are choosing principles to govern people who are fully\nfunctional over a normal lifespan. This simplification drew criticism\nfrom Arrow (1973) and later Sen (1980), for it means the method of\njudging inequality, the index of primary social goods, would fail to\naccount for the inability of people in some health states to convert\nthose goods into the same level of well-being as people functioning\nnormally. Rawls’s (1971) notion of opportunity is primarily\ngeared to the strategic importance of access to jobs and offices;\nhealth, viewed as normal functioning, clearly has a bearing on access\nto jobs and offices, but we also need a broader account of opportunity\nif we are to address the impact of health on other important aspects\nof life. In borrowing justification for a principle assuring fair\nequality of opportunity, then, and then using it to apply to a broader\nnotion of opportunity, the argument involves a modification of\nRawls’s own arguments. Nevertheless, he seems to have adopted\nthis view of how to extend his theory (Rawls 1995: 184, n.14; Rawls\n2001: 175, n.58). \nDespite this modification, the approach preserves a key feature of\nRawls’s original idealization away from consideration of health\nstates: in aiming to keep all in a population functioning normally\nover a normal lifespan, we aim to keep the real world as close to the\nidealization as possible. A crucial consequence of this is that we are\nnot simply focused on equalizing opportunity, but on promoting the\nbroadened range of opportunity that comes with normal functioning for\neveryone. The view aims at promoting population health and not simply\nequalizing it: equally bad health is not the goal of the argument. Put\nanother way, the ultimate goal of health policy is that all people\nfunction normally: but that means the ultimate goal is both\negalitarian and maximizing (though short of the ultimate goal, we face\nimportant trade-offs). \nFinally, we must consider how we can meet health needs fairly when we\ncannot meet them all. The question is especially difficult because we\nhave reasonable disagreements about what interventions to include in a\nuniversal access system, as we noted earlier when we noted how\nreasonable disagreements will arise about the tradeoff between\nimproved financial protection, say by reducing the co-pays or\ndeductibles a benefit involves, and coverage of more types of services\nduring deliberations about the comprehensiveness of a universal\ncoverage benefit package. This is true even if we accept the principle\nof fair equality of opportunity principle as the appropriate principle\nto govern health and health care. \nThe problem is that the fair equality of opportunity principle is too\ngeneral and indeterminate to address a family of “unsolved\nrationing problems” (Daniels 1993). For example, when we are\nthinking of investing in a new service or technology, we may agree\nthat we should give those who are worst off in their health some\npriority over those who are better off. But we may wonder how much\npriority we should give them if we can produce much bigger improvement\nin health for those who are somewhat better off. Similarly, we may\nagree not to allow many trivial benefits to outweigh significant ones,\nbut we may still disagree about when do modest benefits for larger\nnumbers of people outweigh significant benefits for fewer people. In\nthese and other problems, reasonable people—people seeking\nreasons that can form the basis for a mutual justification of\npolicy—will disagree about how to make the tradeoffs among the\ncompeting values at issue, even if they agree that the overall goal of\nhealth policy should be to protect opportunity. We lack prior\nagreement on more fine-grained principles that tell us how best to\nprotect opportunity in this context. Because we lack a consensus on\nsuch principles, we should engage a form of procedural justice or fair\nprocess to yield fair outcomes. \nOne version of such a process is called “accountability for\nreasonableness” (Daniels and Sabin 2008). It requires a search\nfor mutually justifiable reasons, publicity about the grounds for\ndecisions, revisability of decisions in light of new evidence and\narguments, and assurance that the process is adhered to. The specific\nfeatures of such a fair process would have to be adapted to the\ninstitutional level at which it is used to make decisions about what\nto cover. Specifically, decisions about the content of a universal\naccess benefit package should be specified through a fair,\ndeliberative process that conforms to these general conditions. In\nSection 5 we shall return to consider in more detail what kinds of\ninterventions are in general supported by this account. \nAccountability for reasonableness can arguably be thought of as a form\nof pure procedural justice (Rawls 1971) because we lack prior\nconsensus on the fine-grained principles needed to resolve disputes\nabout these resource allocation issues, though we may arrive at\nmutually acceptable justifications through deliberation about specific\ncases. It differs from gambling, Rawls’s example of a case of\npure procedural justice, in two ways. First, the appeal to process is\nconstrained by some prior moral principles. For example, an outcome\nshould not contradict what fair equality of opportunity requires by\ndiscriminating against some subgroup by race or gender. A local\ndecision-making body could not engage in gender or race bias and\nconsider that a fair outcome. One might claim that the same constraint\napplies to the gambling case: if only whites and no blacks were\nallowed to gamble, then the outcome of a spin of a fair roulette wheel\nwould also not be fair—though some might reply this is a\nconstraint on who plays the game, not on whether we view the outcome\nof the spin of a fairly balanced wheel as fair outcome. Second, we can\nimagine philosophical reasoning persuading us to adopt a principle\nthat renders the appeal to a fair process unnecessary, but we cannot\nimagine such a philosophical “proof” of the fairness of a\ngambling outcome that would lead us to think the spin of a fair\nroulette wheel or a throw of a properly balanced die can be rendered\nunnecessary in the same way. Though fair equality or opportunity,\nincluding non-discrimination, constrains acceptable outcomes of fair\nprocess, it is too general an idea to settle what counts as an\nacceptable outcome. That requires agreement, in general by a range of\nstakeholders, on reasons for thinking an allocation is an acceptable\nway to meet needs fairly and so protect opportunity for those\ninvolved. The point behind insisting on what we call the\n“relevance” condition is to search for mutually\njustifiable reasons for thinking that a particular resource allocation\nis an acceptable way to aim at fair equality of opportunity. The\ncondition takes us beyond mere consistency with fair equality of\nopportunity since that principle does not determine what to do in the\nface of disagreements about priorities, aggregation, and other\nproblems. \nThe argument for universal access sketched earlier specifically\nembraces Rawls’s fair equality of opportunity principle. It is\nworth remarking that the variations on this argument might retain\nsteps 1–3 but modify the principle that is appealed to in 4,\nprovided there is a reasonable connection between any substituted\nprinciple and the central observation in 3, that health affects the\nopportunity range open to people. For example, Sen has argued that the\nappropriate target of concerns about equality is a space of\ncapabilities, thought of as functionings we can choose to exercise. A\nprinciple requiring us to protect the range of capabilities for people\n(either equally or to some sufficient level) would also provide a\nbasis for keeping people functioning normally through universal access\nto interventions that reduce the health risks to them or that treat\nthem for departures from normal functioning. Though Sen has not\ndeveloped this account into a theory of justice that articulates a set\nof principles of justice, the central point here is that a concern to\nprotect a space of functionings we can choose to exercise is\nequivalent to the focus of the earlier argument on protecting\nopportunities that it is reasonable for people to exercise (Daniels\n2010). \nA third alternative version of the earlier argument might (in 4)\ninvoke a principle assuring equal opportunity for welfare or advantage\n(Arneson 1988; Cohen 1989), a view that later came to be called\n“luck egalitarianism.” Arguably, such a principle would\nalso support a universal access system that included a broad range of\npreventive and treatment services. This particular principle, however,\nwill differ in terms of what is covered from the opportunity-based\naccount described earlier for it more explicitly leaves room to\nexclude coverage for conditions for which an individual is\nsubstantively responsible. It says we do not owe each other assistance\nor compensation for bad “option” luck in the way we do for\nbad “brute” luck. At the same time, it might include\naccess to services that correct for some disadvantages (e.g. lower\nmanual dexterity or lower intelligence) that might be considered\nnormal functioning by the account sketched earlier. Still, this is a\nuniversal access system, even if it excludes coverage for conditions\nfor which society holds individuals responsible (see Daniels 2011).\nNevertheless, some luck egalitarians reject the appeal to opportunity\nproposed in the account sketched here (Segall 2010). \nA second general line of argument in favor of universal access to some\nforms of health care builds on the idea that prudent individuals would\ninsure themselves against the prospect of needing certain kinds of\nhealth care. We shall consider two versions of this argument,\nDworkin’s (1981, 1994, 2000) effort to spell out the\nimplications of treating people with equal respect, and\nGibbard’s (1982) appeal to an ex ante pareto optimality\nprinciple combined with an assumed right to a decent basic minimum of\nincome. As we shall see, though both arguments use different\nassumptions to support universal access to different health care\nbenefit packages, their main point is to counter certain implausible\nviews about what benefits should be included in a universal access\nsystem. \nDworkin’s argument can be sketched as follows: \nSome comments will clarify key aspects of this argument. First, the\nfirst two premises involve both a strong egalitarian assumption,\nthough one that is widely held (treating people as equals) and a very\nstrong (specific and detailed) way of achieving it (equality of\nresources). Discussion of the details of these claims would take us\nwell beyond the scope of this essay. Suffice it to say that this\nargument cannot proceed to an account of universal access to health\ncare without some more general assumptions for a view of justice. In\nthat regard, it shares with the fair equality of opportunity account\nthe need to borrow justification for universal access from more\ngeneral concerns of justice. \nSecond, the specific assumptions in (3) are very strong and arguably\ncannot be realized. The argument that presupposes them should thus be\nseen as an analytic tool and not an attempt to say anything very\nspecific about how real institutions could be designed. (We note that\nthis strong requirement is not needed by the model of universal and\nequal access that emphasizes real choice. Instead, the choice model\nallows for income inequalities and only needs subsidies to equalize\nthe affordability of buying insurance equal in scope to what the ACA\nrequires of insurance purchased on the exchanges it authorizes.)\nWithout, for example, knowing what level of resources would result\nfrom equalizing resources, we can say little about what levels of\ninsurance coverage for specific conditions are welfare enhancing for\nindividuals. Since there is no feasible way to meet the assumptions\nabout the distribution of medical knowledge or the exclusion of\nknowledge of individual risks, these assumptions make Dworkin’s\nargument completely hypothetical and theoretical rather than\npractical. Third, the assumption that there is an ideally competitive\ninsurance market postulated in the fourth step of the argument adds to\nthe hypothetical nature of the argument as a whole. \nFourth, the argument focuses primarily on personal medical services\nand not broader public health measures that reduce overall risk or\ndistribute that risk more fairly. There is no mention of interventions\nbeyond individual treatment or prevention measures, and the thrust of\n4 and 5 make it clear the argument is about an insurance market only\nfor those measures. The thrust of steps 5 and 6 make it clearer that\nthe point of the argument is to clarify what a defensible content of a\nuniversal access benefit package would include. Specifically, the\nargument aims to establish that we need a more plausible view of what\nwe owe each other by way of providing health care than the\nindefensible view that what rescues someone from death or disability\nmust be provided regardless of costs or opportunity costs. \nThe other version of a prudential insurance argument for universal\ncoverage rests on a weaker assumption that we have a right to a decent\nminimum of income. In Gibbard’s (1982) discussion, the\nassumption is invoked but not argued for. Like the other argument, the\nmain thrust of Gibbard’s argument lies in its implications for\nthe content of a universal access benefit package. \nSome comments will help clarify this argument sketch. First, Gibbard\nis concerned to show that this weak ethical principle has health\npolicy implications that are significant (and are noted in steps 4 and\n5). He defends the principle against anti-utilitarian arguments and\nagainst some intuitions that run counter to it but that may be\nirrational (on his view). Second, to arrive at the main conclusion in\n4—supporting universal access to a decent minimum of\ncare—Gibbard adopts an ethical precept that is sufficient to\nsupport provide a basis for a universal level of insurance purchasing.\nHe does not, as noted, argue for the specific right articulated here.\nHe might, however, try to derive some support for it from utilitarian\narguments about decreasing marginal utility of income and wealth, for\nit is weaker than the more egalitarian view that Brandt (1979) defends\non utility maximizing grounds and for which Gibbard expresses some\nsympathy. \nThird, the crux of the argument for the conclusion in step 4 is the\nidea that if everyone acts prudently at the decent minimum economic\nthreshold of welfare to buy some kinds of health care, what they buy,\nassuming they bear the inclusive social cost of the insurance\n(including any losses of efficiency), will constitute the decent\nminimum of care. To say it is prudent for a person to buy the\ninsurance (while bearing those costs) is (using the Ex Ante Pareto\nPrinciple) to say the person has better prospects with the insurance\nthan without and that no one is worse off as a result. Presumably,\nhowever, this requires that there be a competitive market for such\ninsurance (an assumption Dworkin had to make in his argument), and it\nis not obvious how to achieve that in light of the pervasive\nuncertainties that exist in medical markets (cf. Arrow 1963), a point\nGibbard notes. \nFourth, above the decent welfare minimum, it is unlikely that access\nto the some broader insurance package is prudent for all people to\nbuy. That is the reason Gibbard says it is not equitable to require\nequal access to all health care. Here equity is equated with ethically\nacceptable, and what counts as ethically acceptable is (among other\nthings) what is endorsed by the Ex Ante Pareto Principle. The same\nprinciple shows that some kinds of care are not prudent for anyone to\nbuy—prospects are better for all people if they do not buy\ninsurance for that care—and so a defense is made for some\nimplications of cost effectiveness analysis. \nFifth, unlike Dworkin, who admits there may be disagreements about\nwhat it is prudent to do, Gibbard does not make that concession.\nConsequently, he is not concerned, as is Dworkin (or the proponent of\naccountability for reasonableness, in the earlier argument), with\ndeveloping a way of resolving disputes about what counts as\nprudent. \nA different kind of argument in favor of universal access to a decent\nminimum of health care does not turn on support of general principles\nof justice (fair equality of opportunity, treating peoples as equals,\nor a right to a decent minimum of economic welfare), but rather on a\npluralism of moral considerations plus an argument for state\ncoordinated (coerced) beneficence (Buchanan 1984). In his discussion,\nBuchanan first dismisses various accounts that try to ground a\nuniversal right to a decent minimum of care, but here we shall\nconcentrate on the positive argument supporting the idea of universal\naccess through a legal entitlement to such care despite the absence of\nany moral right to it. \nThe argument can be sketched as follows: \nSome points of clarification are in order. First, it remains unclear\njust how the special rights argued for combine to produce a decent\nminimum for all. Only some people hold them, and it is not fully clear\nwhat these rights entitle their bearers to. Second, it is unclear that\nwhen we add the entitlements of these special rights bearers to the\ncontent of what follows from the Harm Prevention Principle or the\nprudential considerations, we end up with what people would call a\ndecent minimum of care. How the broader entitlements of the special\nrights bearers (if they are broad) get combined with the care that\nought to universally be provided according the Harm Prevention\nPrinciple and the prudential considerations? No clear account is\noffered. Put another way, these pluralist considerations might suffice\nto establish some legal entitlements by some people to some forms of\ncare, but it is not obvious that what emerges is a universal legal\nentitlement to a decent minimum of care. \nThird, the arguments for enforcing beneficence seems to imply that\nthere is a collective duty to engage in beneficent actions, whereas\nthe duty the argument explicitly mentions is an individual duty of\nbeneficence. The fact that individuals might fail to produce certain\npublic goods through individual (unenforced) beneficence is a\nlimitation that enforced coordination overcomes, but it is not a\nfailure that results from their not discharging their duty. To treat\nit as if it is seems to presuppose a collective responsibility to do\nas much good as possible. \nSeveral lessons can be learned from this review of lines of\njustification for universal access to care. One such lesson is that\nrationales for universal access derive from more general\nconsiderations of justice. As such, they borrow their justificatory\nforce from the arguments for those general considerations. They also\nbring with them from those general theories specific considerations\nthat may affect the content of the claim to universal access. Thus, a\nfamily of egalitarian theories that talk about equality of opportunity\nin different ways might thus all support universal access to health\ncare because of its impact on opportunity, but they justify different\nkinds of access because they view the obligation to promote\nopportunity in somewhat different ways. \nA second lesson is that some rationales depend on highly idealized\nassumptions and might provide less clarity about the design of benefit\npackages than might be hoped. For example, the arguments from\nprudential insurance—despite their different ethical\npresuppositions—give less guidance to institutional design and\ndesign of a benefit package than might have been hoped since they\npresuppose extrapolating from consumer behavior in a truly competitive\nand ideally informed insurance market. Similarly, both lines of\nargument make it impossible to be specific about what prudent\ninsurance would include because we do not know what level of\npurchasing is possible at either the “equal resources” or\n“decent economic minimum” that the two views posit. In\ncontrast, the deliberative fair process that supplements the fair\nequality of opportunity account does not require such a hypothetical\ncontext to yield results. \nA third lesson is that avoiding a unifying theoretical account of\nuniversal access to care may cost more than it gains. Specifically,\neschewing appeal to a background theory that justifies health care\nbecause it contributes to something else of importance to social\njustice (fair equality of opportunity, treating people as equals), and\nappealing instead to a pluralism of considerations, risks losing\nclarity about what care is part of the “decent minimum” it\npurports to provide legal entitlements to. \nIn the next two sections, we shall focus in more detail on what the\nfair equality of opportunity account says we owe each other and its\nimplications for a right to health care. We adopt this focus because\nin contrast to the other views surveyed, it is more explicit about the\ncontent of the health care we owe to each other. We shall note the\nimplications of other views where feasible. \nOn the fair equality of opportunity view, meeting the health needs of\nall persons, viewed as free and equal citizens, is of comparable and\nspecial moral importance. (If “citizens” is taken broadly\nto include all members of a community, then arguably long-term\nunauthorized immigrants should be included (Daniels and Ladin\nforthcoming). Specifically, since meeting health needs protects the\nrange of opportunities people can exercise, then any social\nobligations we have to protect opportunity imply obligations to\nprotect and promote health (normal functioning) for all people.\nVarious recent theories of justice, despite their differences, affirm\nthat we have such social obligations to protect opportunity, and so\nthey converge on the importance of protecting health. \nOn the opportunity-based view, justice requires that we protect\npeople’s shares of the normal opportunity range by treating\nillness when it occurs, by reducing the risk of disease and disability\nbefore they occur, and by distributing those risks equitably. Within\nthe medical system, this means we must give all people access to a\nreasonable array of services that promote and restore normal\nfunctioning and we must not neglect preventive measures in favor of\ncurative ones. It means we must look beyond the medical system to\ntraditional public health measures that profoundly affect risk levels\nand their distribution. We must also look beyond the health sector to\nthe broader social determinants of health and their distribution.\nSince we cannot meet all the health needs that arise inside or outside\nthe health sector, we must be accountable for the reasonableness of\nthe resource allocation decisions we make. \nThe alternative views noted in the previous section arguably have\nnarrower scope, though some may be more expandable than others.\nDworkin’s prudential insurance approach might have the same\nscope as the opportunity-based view if the insurance policy that\n(most?) prudent buyers purchase includes protections against health\nrisks that go beyond treatments for illness. Dworkin is not explicit\nabout how that broader policy might be designed. What can be purchased\nin any case is constrained by the level of resources available in the\nequality of resources approach, and Dworkin is sensitive to the fact\nthat some purchasers may disagree about what prudence requires.\nGibbard’s prudent insurance buyers presumably work with a\nsmaller premium unless a decent economic minimum is equal to what we\nget on the equal resources view. Gibbard is more explicitly talking\nonly about insurance for medical services, and it might be harder to\nexpand his account to one that meets health needs more broadly.\nBuchanan’s decent minimum quite deliberately meets fewer health\nneeds than the opportunity-based view. \nConsider more specifically what the opportunity-based account of\njustice and health care requires by way of preventive services. It\nrequires (1) reducing the risk of disease and (2) seeking an equitable\ndistribution of those risks. The first requirement is obvious. It is\noften more effective to prevent disease and disability than it is to\ncure them when they occur (or to compensate individuals for loss of\nfunction, where cure is not possible). Cost-effectiveness arguments\nwill have some bearing on claims about the appropriate distribution of\nacute vs. preventive measures (Russell 1986). Since it is better in\ngeneral to avoid the burdens of disease than to reduce them once they\noccur, many types of preventive measures will be given prominence in a\nsystem governed by the opportunity-based account. \nThe second requirement should also seem obvious, especially in light\nof what we know about the importance of the social determinants of\nhealth. Consider the point from the perspective of occupational\nhealth. Suppose a health-care system is heavily weighted toward acute\ncare and that it provides equal access to its services. Thus anyone\nwith severe respiratory ailments—black lung, brown lung,\nasbestosis, emphysema, and so on—is given adequate comprehensive\nmedical services as needed, but little is done to reduce exposures to\nrisk in the workplace. Does the system meet the demands of\njustice? \nSuch a system is incomplete and unjust, according to the fair equality\nof opportunity view. If some groups in the population are\ndifferentially at risk of getting ill, it is not sufficient merely to\nattend to their illnesses. Where risk of illness differs\nsystematically in ways that are avoidable, guaranteeing equal\nopportunity requires that we try to eliminate the differential risks\nand to prevent the excess illness experienced by those at avoidable,\ngreater risk (of course subject to resource limits and fair process in\nsetting limits). Otherwise the burdens and risks of illness will fall\ndifferently on different groups, and the risk of impaired opportunity\nfor those groups will remain, despite the efforts to provide acute\ncare. Care is not equivalent to prevention. Some disease will not be\ndetected in time for it to be cured. Some is not curable, even if it\nis preventable, and treatments will vary in efficacy. We protect equal\nopportunity best by reducing and equalizing the risk of these\nconditions arising. The fact that we get an equal chance of being\ncured once ill because of equitable access to care does not compensate\nus for our unequal chances of becoming ill. \nFor these reasons, the fair equality of opportunity account places\nspecial importance on measures aimed at the equitable distribution of\nthe risks of disease. Reduction in carbon emissions aimed at keeping\nthe global temperature increases within a reasonable limit could\nreduce the chances of climate change increasing the risk of disease\nfor all; even if the risk of disease to individuals is unequal from\nclimate change, health inequities makes reducing carbon emissions like\nother public health measures. For example, some public-health\nmeasures, such as water and waste treatment, have the general effect\nof reducing risk. But historically, they have also had the effect of\nequalizing risk between socioeconomic classes and between groups\nliving in different geographical areas. Similarly, many other\nenvironmental measures, such as recent clean air laws and pesticide\nregulations, have both general effects on risk reduction and specific\neffects on the distribution of risks. For example, pollutants emitted\nfrom smokestacks have a different effect on people who live downwind\nfrom those who live upwind. Gasoline lead emissions have greater\neffect on urban than rural populations. But other health-protection\nmeasures primarily have an effect on the distribution of risks: the\nregulation of workplace health hazards is perhaps the clearest\nexample. Only some groups of workers are at risk from workplace\nhazards, though many workers face some risk or other, especially in\nmanufacturing settings. Just health requires that stringent regulation\nin all of these ways must be part of the health-care system. \nWhat other sorts of social policies should governments pursue in order\nto reduce inequalities in health risks, especially in light of what we\nnow know about the social determinants of health? The menu of options\nshould include policies aimed at equalizing individual life\nopportunities, such as investment in basic education and other early\nchildhood interventions, affordable housing, income security, and\nother forms of antipoverty policy. We know, for example, that early\ninterventions aimed at child development, like the Perry High/Scope\nProject (Schweinhardt et al. 1993), have lasting effects on\neducational achievement, employment, marriage, and the reduction of\nmental illness. The War on Poverty Program Head Start produced lasting\neffects on educational achievement; educational achievement, in turn,\nhas a direct influence on health behavior in adulthood, including\ndiet, smoking, and physical activity (Acheson et al. 1998). Other\npolicies that might reduce differential risk could explore changes in\nthe degree of control and authority workers have in the workplace\n(Marmot et al. 1997). Even broader interventions, including addressing\ninequalities in the distribution of wealth, power, and resources, are\nrecommended by the WHO Commission on the Social Determinants of Health\n(2010). Though the connection between these broad, intersectoral\nsocial policies and health may seem somewhat remote, and they are\nrarely linked to issues of health in our public policy discussions,\ngrowing evidence suggests that they should be so linked. \nOne central implication of this view about health for all is that\nthere should be universal access, based on health needs, to whatever\narray of public health and personal medical services provides support\nfor fair equality of opportunity under reasonable resource\nconstraints. This implication must be unpacked since health needs are\nmet in various ways, through public health as well as personal medical\nservices. \nPublic health services promote the conditions that reduce certain\nrisks of disease or disability. They reduce risks by assuring a clean\nand safe living and working environment and by providing protection\nagainst infectious diseases. These services should attend to the risks\nfaced by the entire population and aim to reduce risks in an equitable\nfashion. \nHowever much we can reduce risks to population health and do so in an\nequitable fashion, some people will still become ill or disabled and\nrequire personal medical services or other forms of social support\nthat compensate for the effects of loss of function. Even if the\nproper arrangement of the social determinants of health and adequate\nattention to public health greatly reduce the burden of disease and\ndisability in a society, most people will still need medical care at\nvarious points in their lives, especially as they age. To protect the\nrange of opportunities for those whose loss of normal functioning we\ncannot prevent, we will have to devote some significant resources to\nsuch medical and social support services. Obviously, careful\ndeliberation in a fair process will be needed to determine the proper\nallocation of resources to prevention vs. cure and social support. \nPersonal medical services that are deemed essential to promoting fair\nopportunity for all must be accessible to all. Specifically, this will\ngenerally mean “universal coverage” through some form of\npublic or private insurance for services deemed to be a\n“decent” or “adequate” array, as required by\nthe appeal to the underlying concept of protecting fair equality of\nopportunity. There should be no obstacles—financial, racial,\ngeographical, and so on—to access to the basic tier of the\nsystem. Determining what is in that basic tier must be clarified in\nlight of arguments about how to protect fair equality of opportunity\nunder reasonable resource constraints, and these arguments require a\nfair process (accountability for reasonableness) in which appropriate\ndemocratic deliberation can take place. The theory rules out arbitrary\nexclusions of whole categories of kinds of services that meet needs of\nthe sort that should be met in the basic tier. Historically, for\nexample, preventive services, mental health care, rehabilitative, and\nlong-term care services have been excluded from both public and\nprivate insurance schemes, for various cultural and economic reasons.\nMost of these “categorical” exclusions are unjustifiable\nfrom the perspective of protecting normal functioning, but specific\nlimit-setting choices can only be made through a fair, deliberative\nprocess. \nJust what forms of organization—public or private administration\nand financing—are implied is not a question to which the\nopportunity-based account of justice and health provides a unique\nanswer. There is probably an array of “just-enough”\ninstitutional structures that can provide the needed protection of\nopportunity. Similarly, just what kinds of “tiering” or\ninequalities in services above the basic tier are compatible with\nprotecting opportunity for all may not get specific answers from the\ngeneral theory, though it will clearly supply constraints. Reasonable\ndisagreements about these questions should be addressed in a fair\ndeliberative process. \nIf health care were the only or most important determinant of\npopulation health, then an opportunity-based account of justice and\nhealth would be right to focus solely on a right to health care and to\nignore the more contentious and possibly misleading right claim to\nhealth. A right to health care would then be a special case of a right\nto fair equality of opportunity. Such a right to health care is\nproperly understood as system-relative. The entitlements it involves\nare contingent claims to an array of health care services that protect\nfair shares of the opportunity range under reasonable resource\nconstraints. \nThis simple picture of a right to health care must be modified in two\nways to accommodate points already made in our discussion. First,\nsince the category of socially controllable factors determining\npopulation health and its distribution is clearly broader than health\ncare alone (even if we include traditional public health measures\nwithin the domain of health care), the point of claiming a right to\nhealth cannot simply be to claim that others owe us certain kinds of\nhealth care. Does this give us more reason to talk about a right to\nhealth? Second, whatever sense we can make out of a right to health\n(or health care), the specific entitlements it involves cannot be\ndetermined except through a fair deliberative process. Consider these\nmodifications in turn. \nIf health needs are broader than needs for health care, should we try\nto make sense of a right to health? We face an immediate and serious\nobjection. The expression “right to health” appears to\nembody confusion about the kind of thing that can be the object of a\nright claim. Health is an inappropriate object, whereas health care\nis. If our poor health is not the result of anyone’s doing, or\nfailing to do, something for us or to us that might have prevented, or\nmight cure, our condition, then it is hard to see how any right of\nours is violated. \nPeople who claim a right to health may mean something less troubling.\nThey should be understood to be claiming that certain individuals or\ngroups or society as a whole are obliged to perform various actions,\nsuch as designing certain institutions and distributing important\ngoods in certain ways that promote or maintain or restore their\nhealth, and they are obliged to refrain from actions that interfere\nwith it. The reference to health should be construed as a\nhandy way to characterize functionally the relevant,\nsocially-controllable actions, namely those that affect population\nhealth and its distribution. This gloss on the meaning of a right to\nhealth broadens the range of actions from the provision of health care\nto the meeting of the broader set of health needs that arises when we\ngrasp the broader determinants of health. This gloss allows us to see\nwhy some advocates, for example of a human right to health, have\ninsisted on a “right to health” and not just on a\n“right to (certain) health care services.” They want, and\nreasonably so, the right to imply that there are obligations to\nperform a broad range of actions that affect health, even if these\nactions are not normally construed as health care services and even if\nthey involve factors outside the health sector, however broadly\nconstrued. The gloss makes it clear, however, that a right to health,\nso understood, is not violated when there has been a just distribution\nof the socially controllable factors affecting health, yet health\nfails anyway. Consequently, we do not have to denounce as confused\nthose who claim a right to have the full range of their health needs\nmet. \nJust what entitlements follow from a right to have a broad set of\nhealth needs met is system relative and depends on resource allocation\ndecisions that are made in a fair deliberative process. To see the\npoint, consider an objection sometimes made to the narrower claim to a\nright to health care, namely Fried’s (1978) objection that an\nindividual right to health care invites falling into a\n“bottomless pit.” Fried is worried that if we posit a\nfundamental individual right to have needs satisfied, no other social\ngoals will be able to override the right claims to all health-care\nneeds. \nNo such fundamental right to have specific needs met is directly\nposited on the view sketched here. Rather, the particular rights and\nentitlements of individuals to have certain needs met are specified\nonly as a result of a fair deliberative process aimed at meeting\npopulation health needs fairly. Typically, not all health needs can be\nmet under reasonable resource constraints. Deciding which needs should\nactually be met and what resources are to be devoted to doing\nso—both within and outside the health sector—requires\ncareful moral judgment and a wealth of empirical knowledge about the\neffects of alternative allocations. The right to health can yield\nentitlements only to those needs that it is reasonable to try to\nmeet. \nThis restriction on how we specify the content of the right to health\nmeans, for example, that we cannot directly infer from (a) the moral\nfact that Jack has a right to health care and (b) the empirical fact\nthat an experimental pancreas transplant offers him his only chance at\nsurvival that (c) Jack is entitled to that intervention. Jack’s\nmedical entitlements—given his right—depend both on his\ncondition and on the array of interventions it is reasonable to\nprovide the population of which he is a member. That reasonable array\nin turn depends on what we know is effective, what resources we have,\nand what priority should be given to meeting his need compared to that\nof others. If pancreas transplants are of unproven efficacy, or if\ntheir cost or cost-effectiveness makes including them in a benefit\npackage unreasonable, given what else it would be better to include,\nthen coverage for such transplants may be denied for Jack and others.\nAlthough a moral right to health is grounded in the general idea that\nwe have obligations to protect opportunity by promoting normal\nfunctioning, its specific content is in this fundamental way\nsystem-relative. \nWe noted earlier some dimensions of the limit setting that must go on.\nThe various institutions that affect opportunity must be weighed\nagainst each other. Similarly, the resources required to provide for\nfair equality of opportunity must be weighed against what is needed to\nprovide for other important social institutions. This is true even\nthough guaranteeing fair equality of opportunity has (lexical or\nstrict) priority over principles of justice promoting wellbeing in\nother ways, at least within Rawls’s theory of justice as\nfairness. The point is that institutions, including health care\ninstitutions, capable of protecting opportunity can be maintained only\nin societies whose productive capacities they do not undermine. The\nbugaboo of the bottomless pit is less threatening in the context of\nsuch a theory. The price paid is that we are less clear, in general\nand abstracting from the application of the theory to a particular\nsociety, just what the individual claim comes to. \nThe right to health must be system relative for another reason that is\nimplied by a deeper feature of the opportunity-based account. What is\nspecial about meeting health needs, for purposes of justice, is that\nit contributes to protecting individuals’ fair shares of the\nnormal opportunity range for their society. That range, to emphasize\nthe point, is society relative. This relativity, however, then also\ninfects claims about what we are entitled to when a health system is\ndesigned for a specific society. The relativization of the normal\nrange to a society captures an important requirement for a theory of\njust health care. It is not a feature we should lightly abandon. The\nimportance of meeting specific health needs will vary depending on\nfacts about a society, and a distributive principle must leave room\nfor such variation. Curing dyslexia might well be more important in\nsome societies than others, though it is an instance of pathology in\nall of them. (Suppose a disease is widespread, even universal, in a\nsociety. Say it is a form of anemia that affects all and is\ndebilitating across the board. One might think that impact on the\nnormal opportunity range will not tell us how important it is to treat\nthis disease, since it hurts all individuals equally. But the\nopportunity account still helps us here, for it is not only a\nprinciple governing competitive advantage. The anemia in this case is\na disease which keeps each individual from adequately carrying out any\nlife plan that otherwise would be reasonable in his society. Remember,\nthe reference point is normal species-functioning, not simply\nfunctioning in a certain society.) \nConsider the claim that it is a matter for the courts to decide what\nshould be included in a right to health or health care. In some\ncountries, such a right is embodied in the constitution of the\ncountry. In Colombia, for example, the public has been encouraged to\nfile law suits, called tutelas, some of which are aimed at compelling\ninsurance schemes to cover services that should be covered (by law) in\nthe benefit package and some of which aim to expand coverage for the\nplaintiff to include a service not part of the defined benefit\npackage. Further, all signatories to international treaties that\nrecognize a human right to health are legally bound to recognize that\nright, and arguably, their courts should play a role in doing so. We\nmight distinguish two roles of the courts. One uncontroversial role\nwould be to insist that the delegated authorities (the ministry of\nhealth) specify the criteria and the process used to define the\nbenefit package, and then exercise judicial review of whether specific\ndecisions are made through that process that use those criteria. A\nmore controversial role would be for the courts to try to determine\nmore directly what should be included in a right to health. To perform\nthe latter task, the courts would need to know many things about the\ncapability of the health system to sustainably deliver a particular\nservice in light of competing claims on services, that is on\nresources. If the courts are not in a position to play that role, then\nthey should restrict their task to making sure that the ministry of\nhealth performs that task according to an acceptable process. \nWe shall conclude by considering how equal must our rights to health\nor health care be? Specifically, must everyone receive exactly the\nsame kinds of health-care services and coverage, or is fairness in\nhealth care compatible with a ‘tiered’ system? Around the\nworld, even countries that offer universal health insurance differ in\ntheir answers to this question. In Canada, for example, no\nsupplementary insurance is permitted. Everyone is served solely by the\nnational health-insurance schemes, though people who seek additional\nservices or more rapid service may go elsewhere, as some Canadians do\nby crossing the border. In Britain, supplementary private insurance\nallows about 10 per cent of the population to gain quicker access to\nservices for which there is extensive queuing in the public system.\nBasing a right to health care on an obligation to protect equality of\nopportunity is compatible with the sort of tiering the British have,\nbut it does not require it, and it imposes some constraints on the\nkind of tiering allowed. \nThe primary social obligation is to assure everyone access to a tier\nof services that effectively promotes normal functioning and thus\nprotects equality of opportunity. Since health care is not the only\nimportant good, resources to be invested in the basic tier are\nappropriately and reasonably limited, for example, by democratic\ndecisions about how much to invest in education or job training as\nopposed to health care. Because of their very high “opportunity\ncosts,” there will be some beneficial medical services that it\nwill be reasonable not to provide in the basic tier, or to provide\nonly on a limited basis, for example, with queuing. To say that these\nservices have “high opportunity costs” means that\nproviding them consumes resources that would produce greater health\nbenefits and protect opportunity more if used in other ways. \nIn a society that permits significant income and wealth inequalities,\nsome people will want to buy coverage for these additional services.\nWhy not let them? After all, we allow people to use their after-tax\nincome and wealth as they see fit to pursue the quality of life and\nopportunities they prefer. The rich can buy special security systems\nfor their homes. They can buy safer cars. They can buy private\nschooling for their children. Why not allow them to buy supplementary\nhealth care for their families? \nOne objection to allowing a supplementary tier is that its existence\nmight undermine the basic tier either economically or politically. It\nmight attract better-quality providers away from the basic tier, or\nraise costs in the basic tier, reducing the ability of society to meet\nits social obligations. The supplementary tier might undermine\npolitical support for the basic tier, for example, by undercutting the\nsocial solidarity needed if people are to remain committed to\nprotecting opportunity for all. These objections are serious, and\nwhere a supplementary tier undermines the basic tier in either way,\neconomically or politically, priority must be given to protecting the\nbasic tier. In principle, however, it seems possible to design a\nsystem in which the supplementary tier does not undermine the basic\none. If that can be done, then a system that permits tiering avoids\nrestricting liberty in ways that some find seriously\nobjectionable. \nA second objection is not to tiering itself but to the structure of\ninequality that results. Compare two scenarios. In one, most people\nare adequately served by the basic tier and only the best-off groups\nin society have the means and see the need to purchase supplementary\ninsurance. That is the case in Great Britain. In the other, the basic\ntier serves only the poorest groups in society and most other people\nbuy supplementary insurance. The Oregon plan to expand Medicaid\neligibility partly through rationing the services it covers has\naspects of this structure of inequality, since most people are covered\nby plans that avoid these restrictions (Daniels, 1991). The first\nscenario seems preferable to the second on grounds of fairness. In the\nsecond, the poorest groups can complain that they are left behind by\nothers in society even in the protection of their health. In the\nfirst, the majority has fewer grounds for reasonable resentment or\nregret. \nIf the basic tier is not undermined by higher tiers, and if the\nstructure of the inequality that results is not objectionable, then it\nis difficult to see why some tiering should not be allowed. There is a\nbasic conflict here between concerns about equality and concerns about\nliberty, between wanting to make sure everyone is treated properly\nwith regard to health care and wanting to give people the liberty to\nuse their resources (after tax) to improve their lives as they see\nfit. In practice, the crucial constraint on the liberty we allow\npeople seems to depend on the magnitude of the benefit available in\nthe supplementary tier and unavailable in the basic tier. Highly\nvisible forms of saving lives and improving function would be\ndifficult to exclude from the basic tier while we make them available\nin a supplementary tier. In principle, however, some forms of tiering\nwill not be unfair even when they involve medical benefits not\navailable to everyone.","contact.mail":"ndaniels@hsph.harvard.edu","contact.domain":"hsph.harvard.edu"}]
