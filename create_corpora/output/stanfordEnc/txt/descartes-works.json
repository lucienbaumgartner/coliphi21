He is\nfamous for having made an important connection between geometry and\nalgebra, which allowed for the solving of geometrical problems by way\nof algebraic equations. He is also famous for having promoted a new\nconception of matter, which allowed for the accounting of physical\nphenomena by way of mechanical explanations. However, he is most famous\nfor having written a relatively short work, Meditationes de Prima\nPhilosophia (Meditations On First Philosophy), published\nin 1641, in which he provides a philosophical groundwork for the\npossibility of the sciences. \n\n\n\n\nDescartes was born in La Haye on March 31, 1596 of Joachim Descartes\nand Jeanne Brochard. He was one of a number of surviving children (two\nsiblings and two half-siblings). His father was a lawyer and\nmagistrate, which apparently left little time for family. Descartes’\nmother died in May of the year following his birth, and he, his full\nbrother and sister, Pierre and Jeanne, were left to be raised by their\ngrandmother in La Haye. At around ten years of age, in 1606, he was\nsent to the Jesuit college of La Flèche. He studied there until 1614,\nand in 1615 entered the University of Poitiers, where a year later he\nreceived his Baccalaureate and License in Canon & Civil Law. For\nthe history and the text of his thesis, see the following supplementary\ndocument: \n\nIn 1618, at the age of twenty-two, he enlisted in the army of Prince\nMaurice of Nassau. It is not known what his duties were exactly,\nthough Baillet suggests that he would have very likely been drawn to\nwhat would now be called the Corps of Engineers (Baillet, Livre 1,\nChapitre 9, p. 41). This division would have engaged in applied\nmathematics, designing a variety of structures and machines aimed at\nprotecting and assisting soldiers in battle. Sorell, on the other\nhand, notes that in Breda, where Descartes was stationed, the army\n“doubled as military academy for young noblemen on the Continent”\n(Sorell, p. 6). And, Gaukroger notes that the education of the young\nnoblemen was structured around the educational model of Lipsius\n(1547–1606), a highly respected Dutch political theorist who received\na Jesuit education at Cologne (Gaukroger, pp. 65–6). Although\nthe historical records point to there being a military presence in\nBreda, there is no definitive evidence that speaks for there being a\nfull-fledged “academy”. There are reasons for thinking that Descartes\nmay have been a soldier, but the majority of biographers suggest that\nit is more likely that his duties were oriented more toward\nengineering or education. \n\nWhile stationed at Breda, Descartes met Isaac\nBeeckman (1588–1637). Notes that Descartes kept related to his\ncorrespondence reveal that he and Beeckman had become more than simple\nacquaintances—their relationship was more one of teacher and student\n(Descartes being the latter). This relationship would rekindle in\nDescartes an intense interest in the sciences. In addition to\ndiscussions about a wide variety of topics in natural science, a direct\nresult of certain questions posed by Beeckman compelled Descartes to\nwrite the Compendium Musicae. Among other things, the\nCompendium attempted to work out a theory of harmony rooted\nin the concepts of proportion or ratio, which (along the lines of the\nancients) attempted to express the notion of harmony in mathematical\nterms. It would not be published during Descartes’ lifetime. As for\nBeeckman, Descartes would later downplay his influence. \n\nAfter Descartes left the army, in 1619, his whereabouts for the next\nfew years are unknown. Based on what he says in the Discours de la\nMethode (Discourse on the Method), published in 1637,\nthere is speculation that he spent time near Ulm (Descartes apparently\nattended the coronation of Ferdinand II in Frankfurt in 1619). There is\nsome evidence suggesting that he was in France in 1622, for it\nwas at this time that property he had inherited was sold—the proceeds\nof which would provide him a simple income for many years. There is\nsome speculation that between 1623 and 1625 he visited Italy. Descartes\nemerges in 1625 in Paris, his notes revealing that he was in contact\nwith Father Marin Mersenne (1588–1648), a member of the Order of\nMinims. This relationship would prompt Descartes to make public his\nthoughts on natural philosophy (science). It is by way of Mersenne that\nDescartes’ work would find its way into the hands of some of the best\nminds living in Paris--for instance, Antoine Arnauld (1612–1694), Pierre\nGassendi (1592–1655), and Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679). \n\nIn 1628 Descartes left Paris. At this time he seems to have been\nworking on the Regulae ad Directionem Ingenii (Rules for\nthe Direction of the Mind), a work that he would abandon, some\nspeculating around the time of the move from Paris. It is worth noting\nthat relatively recently a copy of the Rules was discovered\nin a library at Cambridge University. Scholars are unsure how it got\nthere. Currently, based on what it includes, it is thought that this\nmanuscript represents the work as it stood when Descartes had\nabandoned it in 1628. The later Amsterdam printing (1701) and a copy\nthat Leibniz acquired from Clerselier (c. 1670) make certain\nadvancements over what is found in the Cambridge manuscript. So, it\nappears that Descartes picked up the work again. Some have speculated\nthat this may have happened after a visit in 1635 from John Dury\n(1596–1680) and Samuel Hartlib (1600–1662), where Hartlib\nreports that Dury had returned to England with copies of some of\nDescartes’ works (Fallon, pp. 9f); the speculation being that\nthe recently discovered manuscript is related to something brought\nback by Dury. The meeting took place in The Hague. Dury and Hartlib\nwere friends of the Cambridge philosopher Henry More\n(1614–1687), with whom Descartes had corresponded, and of others\nin More’s circle, including John Milton\n(1608–1674). Perhaps the copy was made during the visit and\nbrought back to Cambridge. (In any event, this is a new and\ninteresting development in Descartes scholarship.) In 1630 Descartes\nmoved to Amsterdam. There he worked on drafts of\nthe Dioptrique (the\nOptics) and the Meteors (the Meteorology),\nwhich were very likely intended to be a part of a larger work, Le\nMonde (The World). In 1632 he moved again, this time to\nDeventer, to apparently teach Henry Reneri (1593–1639) his physics. It\nis also during his stay in Deventer that Descartes probably worked on a\nfinal draft of the Traite de l’homme (Treatise on\nMan), which in connection to the Optics and the\nMeteorology was probably originally intended to be a part of\nThe World. \n\nWhen The World had become ready for publication in 1633, upon\nhearing of the Church’s condemnation of Galileo (1564–1642) in the\nsame year, Descartes decided against its publication. For, the world\nsystem he had adopted in the book assumed, as did Galileo’s, the\nheliocentric Copernican model. In a letter to Mersenne, dated November\n1633, Descartes expresses his fear that were he to publish The\nWorld, the same fate that befell Galileo would befall him. And,\nalthough this is something that he understandably would want to avoid,\nsome scholars question Descartes’ expressed concern, for his living\nin the Netherlands would have kept him out of reach of Catholic\nauthorities. The World appears to have been constituted of\nseveral smaller, but related, works: a treatise on physics, a treatise\non mechanics (machines), a treatise on animals, and a treatise on\nman. Although much of The World has been lost, some of it\nseems to have survived in the form of essays attached to\nthe Discourse which, as was mentioned earlier, would be\npublished four years later, in 1637. And, some of it was published\nposthumously. Arguably, Constantijn Huygens (1596–1687) received what\nDescartes refers to as “three sheets” of\nThe World, along with a letter dated 5 October 1637. These\n“sheets” deal primarily with mechanics. \n\nAround 1635, at the University of Utrecht, Reneri began teaching\n“Cartesian” physics. Also during this year, a domestic\nservant by the name of Helene gave birth to a baby girl,\nFrancine. Genevieve Rodis-Lewis claims that Francine was born 19 June\n1635 (Rodis-Lewis, p. 40). According to a baptismal record, dated 28\nJuly 1635, Descartes is named the father (AT I 395n). However,\nGaukroger claims that the baptismal date was 7 August 1635 (Gaukroger,\np. 294). In 1636 Reneri acquired an official chair in Philosophy at\nthe University of Utrecht, and continued to build a following of\nstudents interested in Cartesian science. Around March of 1636, at the\nage of forty, Descartes moved to Leiden to work out the publishing of\nthe Discourse. And, in 1637 it is published.  With\nthe Discourse out and a following of students building in\nUtrecht, Descartes seems to have turned his attention from career to\nfamily. In a letter dated 30 August 1637 we find him apparently\nworking out an arrangement for Francine, but strangely refers to her\nas his “niece”—which suggests that he did not want\ncertain people to know that he was a father (or that Francine had been\nborn out of wedlock). Gaukroger suggests that despite this apparent\ndenial of paternity, Descartes not only corresponds with Francine, but\nin 1637 brings her and Helene to his new home at Santpoort or\nEgmond-Binnen (Gaukroger, pp. 294, 332). \n\nThe Discourse is the first published work of Descartes’,\ncoming some four years after he had abandoned\nThe World. The Discourse is important for many reasons. For\ninstance, it tells us what Descartes himself seems to have thought of\nhis early education, and in particular, his early exposure to\nmathematics. Roger Ariew suggests that these reflections are not so much\nthose of the historical Descartes, as much as they are those of a\npersona Descartes adopts in telling the story of the\nDiscourse (Ariew, pp. 58–63). Uncontested, however, is the\nview that the Discourse sketches out the metaphysical\nunderpinnings of the Cartesian system. And, as a bonus, it has three\nworks that are attached to it that are apparently added so as to\nexemplify the method of inquiry it develops (though admittedly it is\nunclear how the method is applied in these essays). The attached essays\nare the Optics, the Meteorology, and Le\nGeometrie (the Geometry). As was suggested earlier, the\nOptics and Meteorology were very likely versions of\nworks originally intended for The World. \n\nIt should be stressed that the three attached essays are important\nindependent of the Discourse, for they contain much worth\nstudying. In the Optics, for example, Descartes works out his\nlaws of refraction, and within this context, what would later be called\nSnell’s Law (which Descartes seems to have worked out as early as\n1632). Further, although the Geometry would seem to have come out of\nnowhere, there is evidence in Descartes’s notes to himself, from which\nClerselier reconstructed some of Descartes’s correspondence, that he\nhad been working on some version of it as early as 1619. In a letter to\nBeeckman, dated 26 March 1619, for example, Descartes discusses the\nsubject matter that is found in the Geometry, and in a letter\ndated 23 April 1619, he explicitly mentions the book’s title. It is in\nthis work that Descartes shows how certain geometrical problems can be\nsolved by way of algebraic equations. \n\nThe significance of the sort of connection that Descartes made between\ngeometry and algebra was great indeed, for without it the\nmathematization of the physics and the development of the calculus\nmight not have happened when they did—a generation later via Sir\nIsaac Newton (1642–1727) and Gottfried Leibniz\n(1646–1716). It should be noted, however, that as groundbreaking\nas this work may have been, contrary to the claims of many, nowhere in\nthe Geometry is a “Cartesian Coordinate System”\never developed (that is, the x-y coordinate system\ntaught to today’s students of algebra), nor is he the originator\nof other mathematical concepts that bear his name, for example, the\n“Cartesian Product”. Carl Boyer notes that various\nconcepts that lead to analytic geometry are found for the first time\nin the Geometry, and that the\nGeometry’s mathematical notation is still used today. But, he\nargues, although Cartesian geometry is taken by many to be synonymous\nwith analytic geometry, the fact is that the fundamental aim of\nDescartes’ system is quite different from that of contemporary\nanalytic geometry (Boyer, pp. 370–1). And so, the claim that Descartes\nis the originator of analytic geometry, at least as we understand it\ntoday, overstates the case. As Boyer rightly points out, however, this\ndoes not diminish the importance of the work in the history of\nmathematics. \n\nIn 1639 Descartes began writing the Meditations. And, in 1640\nhe returned to Leiden to help work out its publication. During the\nyear, Descartes’ daughter, Francine, died. There is evidence\nsuggesting that he was called away from Leiden around the time of her\ndeath, returning soon after. Some have speculated that he left Leiden\nto be at her side. Also during this year, Descartes’ father and\nsister died. Descartes’ relationship with his father (and\nbrother) was of the sort that Pierre, his brother, failed to even\nbother him with the news of their father’s death. Rather, it\nseems to have been in a letter from Mersenne that Descartes first\nlearns of it. In a follow up letter to Mersenne, dated 3 December\n1640, Descartes expresses regret in not having been able to see his\nfather before his death. But, he refuses to leave Leiden to attend his\nfather’s funeral, and instead stays to complete the publishing\nof the Meditations.  \n\nToday, the Meditations is by far Descartes’s most popular\nwork—though this would not have been the case in Descartes’\nday. This work is important to today’s scholar for many reasons, not the\nleast of which is its including as an attached text written objections\nfrom some of the best minds living in Paris. Mersenne sent the\nMeditations to philosophers and theologians for\ncriticism. The list of critics includes: Caterus, Hobbes, Arnauld,\nGassendi, and Mersenne himself, with several other unnamed readers who\nraised their objections through Mersenne. A later edition would\ninclude an objection from Bordin.  Descartes replied to each critic,\nand the result was an appended text referred to as “The Objections and\nReplies.” The second edition contains seven sets in all. \n\nThe Meditations opens by developing skeptical questions\nconcerning the possibility of knowledge. Through a series of several\ncarefully thought out meditations, the reader establishes (along with\nthe author) the groundwork for the possibility of knowledge\n(scientia).  Descartes is not a skeptic, as some have insisted, but\nuses skepticism as a vehicle to motivate his reader to\n“discover” by way of philosophical investigation what\nconstitutes this ground. In the Second Replies, Descartes refers to\nthis style of presentation as the “analytic” style. There\nwere two styles of presentation: analytic and synthetic. It is\nimportant not to confuse these terms with those, say, used by\nKant. For Descartes the analytic style of presentation (and inquiry)\nproceeds by beginning with what is commonly taken to be known and\ndiscovering what is necessary for such knowledge. Thus, the inquiry\nmoves from what is commonly known to first principles. The\n“discovery” moves in such a way that each discovery is\nbased on what was discovered before. By contrast, the synthetic style\nof presentation begins by asserting first principles and then to\ndetermining what follows.  Prompted by Mersenne, Descartes sketches\nout in the Second Replies a synthetic rendering of\nthe Meditations. \n\nIn establishing the ground for science, Descartes was at the same time\noverthrowing a system of natural philosophy that had been established\nfor centuries—a qualitative, Aristotelian physics. In a letter\nto Mersenne, dated 28 January 1641, Descartes says “these six\nmeditations contain all the foundations of my physics. But please do\nnot tell people, for that might make it harder for supporters of\nAristotle to approve them. I hope that readers will gradually get used\nto my principles, and recognize their truth, before they notice that\nthey destroy the principles of Aristotle.” Unlike his earlier\nwork, The World, the Meditations parts ways with the\n“old” science without explicitly forwarding controversial\nviews, like that of the Copernican heliocentric model of the solar\nsystem. Specifically, the Cartesian view denies that physics is\ngrounded in hot, cold, wet, and dry. It argues that contrary to\nAristotle’s view, such “qualities” are not\nproperties of bodies at all. Rather, the only properties of bodies\nwith which the physicist can concern him or herself are size, shape,\nmotion, position, and so on—those modifications that\nconceptually (or logically) entail extension in length, breadth, and\ndepth. In contrast to Aristotle’s “qualities,” the\nproperties (or modes) of bodies dealt with in Cartesian physics are\nmeasurable specifically on ratio scales (as opposed to intensive\nscales), and hence are subject in all the right ways to mathematics\n(Buroker, pp.  596–7). This conception of matter, conjoined with\nthe sort of mathematics found in the Geometry, allies itself\nwith the work of such Italian natural philosophers as Tartaglia,\nUbaldo, and Galileo, and helps further the movement of early thinkers\nin their attempts to establish a mathematical physics. \n\nDescartes’ letter to the “learned and distinguished\nmen” of the Sorbonne, which is appended to\nthe Meditations, suggests that he was trying to pitch\nthe Meditations as a textbook for the university. Though the\nendorsement of the Learned Men would not have guaranteed that\nthe Meditations would be accepted or used as a textbook, it\ncould certainly be viewed as an important step to getting it\naccepted. Unlike today’s notion of a textbook, in\nDescartes’ day “textbooks” were intended mostly for\nteachers, not students. Typically, at the close of a teacher’s\ncareer, his notes would be published for the benefit of those who\nwould go on to teach such course material. The awkwardness of\nDescartes’s seeking the acceptance and use of his\nMeditations by teachers is amplified by the fact that he was\nnot a teacher himself. Consequently, his seeking “textbook” status\nwould have very likely been viewed by those Learned Men as being a bit\npretentious. He was, it could be said, a freelancer with no academic or\npolitical ties to the university (outside of his connection to\nMersenne). And, he certainly lacked the credentials and reputation of\nsomeone like a Eustachius, whose widely used textbook of the period is\nof the sort the Meditations was in all likelihood aimed at\nreplacing. Although the Meditations seems to have been\nendorsed by the Sorbonne, it was never adopted as a text for the\nuniversity. \n\nSoon after his encounter with the Sorbonne, Descartes’ public life\nwas further complicated by the Dutch theologian, Gisbert Voetius\n(1588–1676). Voetius had attacked Regius, a Dutch physician who taught\nmedicine at the University of Utrecht, for his having taught certain\n“Cartesian” ideas that conflicted with traditional theological\ndoctrine. Regius was friend to both Reneri and Descartes, and was a\nstrong adherent to Descartes’s philosophical views. Voetius tried to\nhave Regius removed from his position as professor, and attacked not\nonly Descartes’ work but his character. In his defense Descartes\nentered into the debate. The controversy would leave Regius confined\nto teaching medicine, and his published defense of (his conception of)\nCartesian thought would be officially condemned by Voetius, who in\nfive years time would rise to the position of University rector. At\nthe end of the debate, which off and on lasted about five years, the\nsituation ultimately became desperate for Descartes. He feared being\nexpelled from the country and of seeing his books burned.  He would\neven seek protection by asking the Prince of Orange to intervene and\nquell Voetius’ attack. \n\nIn 1643, at the age of forty-seven, Descartes moved to Egmond du\nHoef. With the Voetius controversy seemingly behind him (though, as\nmentioned above, it would again raise its head and climax five years\ndown the road), Descartes and Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia began to\ncorrespond. In this exchange, Princess Elisabeth probed Descartes on\nthe implications of his commitment to mind-body dualism. During this\ntime, he completed a final draft of a new textbook, which he had begun\nthree years earlier, the Principia Philosophiae\n(Principles of Philosophy), and in 1644 it was published. He\ndedicated it to Princess Elisabeth. \n\nThe Principles is an important text. The work is divided into\nfour Parts, with five hundred and four articles. Part One develops\nDescartes’ metaphysics. Although it would appear to be a quick run\nthrough of the Meditations, there are a number of\ndissimilarities. For example, the order of presentation of the proofs\nfor God’s existence, which some have argued is significant, found in\nthe Third and Fifth Meditations, is reversed in the\nPrinciples. The principles introduced in Part Two are based\non the metaphysics of Part One. And, the subsequent physics developed\nin Parts Three and Four is based upon the principles of Part\nTwo. Although the physics turns out to be unsound, the\nPrinciples nevertheless inspired such great thinkers as\nRobert Boyle (1627–1691), Edmond Halley (1656–1742), and Isaac\nNewton. As an important side note, it must be stressed that even\nthough Descartes had throughout his career put a great deal of\nemphasis on mathematics, the physics developed in the\nPrinciples does not appear to be a mathematical\nphysics. Rather, it is traditionally taken to be a conceptual project\nwith only a hint of empirical overtones—a physics rooted entirely in\nmetaphysics. Arguably, however, Descartes’ work on enumeration, order,\nand measure in the Rules provides the conceptual machinery\nnecessary for establishing a ‘mathematical’\nphysics—a conceptual machinery that is carried over to the\nPrinciples (Smith 2003, 2010). Two parts, never completed, were\noriginally intended to deal with plants, animals, and man. In light of\nthis and what Descartes says in a 31 January 1642 letter to the\nmathematician Constantijn Huygens, it is plausible to think that the\nPrinciples would have looked something like The\nWorld had it been completed as planned. \n\nOne of the more controversial positions the Principles\nforwarded, at least according to Newton, was that a vacuum was\nimpossible. Descartes’ rejection of the possibility of a vacuum\nfollowed from his commitment to the view that the essence of body was\nextension. Given that extension is an attribute, and that nothing\ncannot possess any attributes (AT VIIIA 25; CSM I 210), it follows\nthat “nothingness cannot possess any extension” (AT VIIIA 50; CSM I\n231). So, any instance of extension would entail the presence of some\nsubstance (AT VIIIA 25; CSM I 210). In other words, vacuum, taken as\nan extended nothing, is a flat contradiction. The corporeal\nuniverse is thus a plenum, individual bodies separated only by their\nsurfaces. Newton argued in his De Gravitatione\nand Principia that the concept of motion becomes problematic\nif the universe is taken to be a plenum. Another controversial\nposition was Descartes’ insistence that matter is infinitely\ndivisible.  Gassendi, and later Cordemoy, argued that there must be a\nbottom, a ‘substance,’ to the physical universe upon which\nthe being of all corporeal things depend. In line with the ancient\natomist Epicurus, they argued that if matter was infinitely divisible,\nso dividing it would show that there was no bottom—and so,\ncorporeality would not be substantial. So, if corporeality is\nsubstantial, as Descartes himself had claimed, there must be a minimum\nmeasure of extension that could not be divided (by natural means,\nanyway). And so, there are atoms.  But, this conclusion is something\nthat Descartes explicitly rejects in the\nPrinciples. \n\nIn 1646, as a result of the probings of Princess Elisabeth, Descartes\ncompleted a working draft of Passions de l’ame (Passions\nof the Soul). During this year another prominent political figure\nbegan to correspond with Descartes, Queen Christina of Sweden. And,\nRegius published what he took to be a new and improved version of\nCartesian science, which as we now know would draw the wrath of\nVoetius. But Regius did not stop there, for he seemed to have found\nimportant differences between his “Cartesian” view and that of\nDescartes’, and attempted to separate the two, publishing a broadsheet\nthat listed twenty-one anti-Cartesian theses (which his version of\n“Cartesian” science rejected). In response to this, Descartes wrote a\nsingle-page printed defense that was posted on public kiosks for all to\nread. Published in 1648, the Notae in Programma Quoddam\n(Notes on a Program-also referred to as Comments on a\nCertain Broadsheet) is Descartes’ public defense. However, as\nmentioned earlier, tensions mounted as a result of the public exchange\nand Descartes felt his way of life in the Netherlands to be threatened.\nAs luck would have it, an admirer and friend of Descartes’—Chanut, who\nworked for Queen Christina’s court—and Queen Christina herself began\nprobing Descartes about the possibility of coming to Sweden. And, after\na not too lengthy correspondence, Queen Christina offered Descartes a\nposition in her court. For many reasons, which would certanily include\nthose related to his concerns about Voetius, Descartes accepted the\noffer. And, in 1649 he left for Sweden.  \n\nQueen Christina at first required very little from Descartes.\nHowever, according to Gaukroger, this would change. For, after he had\nsome time to settle in, she ordered him to do two things: first, to put\nall of his papers in order, and secondly, to put together designs for\nan academy (Gaukroger, p. 415). Arguably, Descartes had some idea of\nhow the latter might be done by way of his experience in Breda. In\nJanuary of 1650 Queen Christina began to require Descartes to give her\nlessons in philosophy. These apparently would begin at five in the\nmorning and would last for about five hours. They were given three days\na week (Gaukroger, p. 415). During this time Descartes published the\nPassions, the work having emerged primarily from his\ncorrespondence with Princess Elisabeth (to whom he had dedicated the\nPrinciples). One aim of the Passions was to explain\nhow the emotional (and thus moral) life of a human being was connected\nto the soul’s being essentially united to a body. Simply put, a\n’passion of the soul’ is a mental state (or thought) that\narises as a direct result of brain activity. Such passions can move us\nto action. Since this is so, Descartes suggests that one needs to learn\nto control one’s passions, for they can move one to perform vicious\nacts. Critics of Descartes, including Elisabeth, argued that\nDescartes’ metaphysical commitments put real pressure on the view\nexpounded in the Passions. For, according to Descartes’\nmetaphysics, the nature of mind is to think and the nature of body is\nto be extended in length, breadth, and depth. One view concerning\ncausation, a view that Descartes’s critics seemed to have attributed to\nhim, is that one thing causes another to move, for example, by way of\ncontact. Contact, in this context, seems to be possible only by way of\nsurfaces. Now, bodies, since they are extended and thus have surfaces,\ncan come into contact with one another and thus can cause one another\nto move. However, if minds are not extended, they lack surfaces. And,\nif they lack surfaces, there is no way in principle for bodies to come\ninto contact with them. Thus, there is no way in principle for bodies\nto move minds, and vice versa. That is, minds and bodies cannot in\nprinciple causally interact. And so, if the view expounded in the\nPassions requires that bodies and minds be capable of causal\ninteraction, and Descartes’ metaphysical commitments make such\ninteraction impossible, Descartes’ metaphysics puts a great deal of\npressure on the view expounded in the Passions. \n\nAlthough things seemed to be moving forward, they were not going as\nwell as one would have hoped. In a letter to Bregy, for instance, dated\n15 January 1650, Descartes expresses reservations about his decision to\ncome to Sweden. He sees himself to be “out of his element,” the winter\nso harsh that “men’s thoughts are frozen here, like the water” (AT V\n467; CSMK III 383). Given the sentiment expressed in the letter, this\nremark was probably intended to be as much Descartes’s take on the\nintellectual climate as it was about the weather. In early February,\nless than a month after writing Bregy, Descartes fell ill. His illness\nquickly turned into a serious respiratory infection. And, although at\nthe end of a week he appeared to have made some movement towards\nrecovery, things took a turn for the worse and he died in the early\nmorning of 11 February 1650. He was fifty-three years old.","contact.mail":"ksmit4@bloomu.edu","contact.domain":"bloomu.edu"}]
