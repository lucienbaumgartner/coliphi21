It is also a\nframework used in other areas of theoretical physics, such as\ncondensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. In a rather\ninformal sense QFT is the extension of quantum mechanics (QM), dealing\nwith particles, over to fields, i.e. systems with an infinite number\nof degrees of freedom. (See the entry on\n quantum mechanics.)\nIn the last decade QFT has become a more widely discussed\ntopic in philosophy of science, with questions ranging from\nmethodology and semantics to ontology. QFT taken seriously in its\nmetaphysical implications seems to give a picture of the world which\nis at variance with central classical conceptions of particles and\nfields, and even with some features of QM.\n\n\nThe following sketches how QFT describes fundamental physics and what\nthe status of QFT is among other theories of physics. Since there is a\nstrong emphasis on those aspects of the theory that are particularly\nimportant for interpretive inquiries, it does not replace an\nintroduction to QFT as such. One main group of target readers are\nphilosophers who want to get a first impression of some issues that\nmay be of interest for their own work, another target group are\nphysicists who are interested in a philosophical view upon QFT.\n\n\n In contrast to many other physical theories there is no canonical\ndefinition of what QFT is. Instead one can formulate a number of\ntotally different explications, all of which have their merits and\nlimits. One reason for this diversity is the fact that QFT has grown\nsuccessively in a very complex way. Another reason is that the\ninterpretation of QFT is particularly obscure, so that even the\nspectrum of options is not clear. Possibly the best and most\ncomprehensive understanding of QFT is gained by dwelling on its\nrelation to other physical theories, foremost with respect to QM, but\nalso with respect to classical electrodynamics, Special Relativity\nTheory (SRT) and Solid State Physics or more generally Statistical\nPhysics. However, the connection between QFT and these theories is\nalso complex and cannot be neatly described step by step. \nIf one thinks of QM as the modern theory of one particle (or, perhaps,\nvery few particles), one can then think of QFT as an extension of QM\nfor the analysis of systems with many particles—and therefore with a large number of degrees of freedom. In this respect going from QM to\nQFT is not inevitable but rather beneficial for pragmatic\nreasons. However, a general threshold is crossed when it comes to\nfields, like the electromagnetic field, which are not merely difficult\nbut impossible to deal with in the frame of QM. Thus the transition\nfrom QM to QFT allows treatment of both particles and fields within a\nuniform theoretical framework. (As an aside, focusing on the number of\nparticles, or degrees of freedom respectively, explains why the famous\nrenormalization group methods can be applied in QFT as well as in\nStatistical Physics. The reason is simply that both disciplines study\nsystems with a large or an infinite number of degrees of freedom,\neither because one deals with fields, as does QFT, or because one\nstudies the thermodynamic limit, a very useful artifice in Statistical\nPhysics.) Moreover, issues regarding the number of particles under\nconsideration yield yet another reason why we need to extend\nQM. Neither QM nor its immediate relativistic extension with the\nKlein-Gordon and Dirac equations can describe systems with a\nvariable number of particles. However, obviously this is essential for\na theory that is supposed to describe scattering processes, where\nparticles of one kind are destroyed while others are created. \nOne gets a very different kind of access to what QFT is when focusing\non its relation to QM and SRT. Historically, QFT resulted from the\nsuccessful reconciliation of QM and SRT. In order to understand the\ninitial problem one has to realize that QM is not only in\na potential conflict with SRT, more exactly: the locality\npostulate of SRT, because of the famous EPR correlations of entangled\nquantum systems. There is also a manifest contradiction between QM and\nSRT on the level of the dynamics. The Schrödinger equation,\ni.e. the fundamental law for the temporal evolution of the quantum\nmechanical state function, cannot possibly obey the relativistic\nrequirement that all physical laws of nature be invariant under\nLorentz transformations. The Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations,\nresulting from the search for relativistic analogues of the\nSchrödinger equation in the 1920s, do respect the requirement of\nLorentz invariance. Nevertheless, ultimately they are not satisfactory\nbecause they do not permit a description of fields in a principled\nquantum-mechanical way. \nFortunately, for various phenomena it is legitimate to neglect the\npostulates of SRT, namely when the relevant velocities are small in\nrelation to the speed of light and when the kinetic energies of the\nparticles are small compared to their mass energies\n\\(mc^2\\). And this is the reason why non-relativistic\nQM, although it cannot be the correct theory in the end, has its\nempirical successes. But it can never be the appropriate framework for\nelectromagnetic phenomena because electrodynamics, which prominently\nencompasses a description of the behavior of light, is already\nrelativistically invariant and therefore incompatible with\nnon-relativistic QM. Relativistic scattering experiments are another context in which QM\nfails. Since the involved particles often travel close to\nthe speed of light, relativistic effects can no longer be\nneglected. For that reason high-energy scattering experiments can only be\ncorrectly confronted by QFT. \n\nUnfortunately, the catchy characterization of QFT as the successful\nmerging of QM and SRT has its limits. On the one hand, as already\nmentioned above, there also is a relativistic QM, with the\nKlein-Gordon- and the Dirac-equation among their most famous\nresults. On the other hand, and this may come as a surprise, it is\npossible to formulate a non-relativistic version of QFT (see Bain\n2011). The nature of QFT thus cannot simply be that it reconciles QM\nwith the requirement of relativistic invariance. Consequently, for a\ndiscriminating criterion it is more appropriate to say that only QFT,\nand not QM, allows describing systems with an infinite number of\ndegrees of freedom, i.e. fields (and systems in the thermodynamic\nlimit). According to this line of reasoning, QM would be the modern\n(as opposed to classical) theory of particles and QFT the modern\ntheory of particles and fields. Unfortunately however, and\nthis shall be the last turn, even this gloss is not untarnished.\nThere is a widely discussed no-go theorem by Malament (1996) with the\nfollowing proposed interpretation: Even the quantum mechanics of one\nsingle particle can only be consonant with the locality principle of\nspecial relativity theory in the framework of a field theory, such as\nQFT. Hence ultimately, the characterization of QFT, on the one hand,\nas the quantum physical description of systems with an infinite number\nof degrees of freedom, and on the other hand, as the only way of\nreconciling QM with special relativity theory, are intimately\nconnected with one another. Figure 1. \nThe diagram depicts the relations between different theories, where\nNon-Relativistic Quantum Field Theory is not a historical theory but\nrather an ex post construction that is illuminating for conceptual\npurposes. Theoretically, [(i), (ii), (iii)], [(ii), (i), (iii)] and\n[(ii), (iii), (i)] are three possible ways to get from Classical\nMechanics to Relativistic Quantum Field Theory. But note that this is\nmeant as a conceptual decomposition; history didn’t go all these steps\nseparately. On the one hand, by good luck, so to say, Maxwell’s equations of classical\nelectrodynamics were relativistically covariant from inception. The\nsuccessful quantization of that theory lead directly to the early Relativistic Quantum Field Theories. On the other hand, some would argue (e.g. Malament 1996) that\nthe only way to reconcile QM and SRT is in terms of a field theory, so\nthat (ii) and (iii) would coincide. Note that the steps (i), (ii) and\n(iii), i.e. quantization, transition to an infinite number of degrees\nof freedom, and reconciliation with SRT, are all ontologically\nrelevant. In other words, by these steps the nature of the physical\nentities the theories talk about may change fundamentally. See Huggett\n2003 for an alternative three-dimensional “map of\ntheories”. \n\nFurther Reading on QFT and Philosophy of QFT. Mandl\nand Shaw (2010), Peskin and Schroeder (1995), Weinberg (1995) and\nWeinberg (1996) are standard textbooks on QFT. Teller (1995) and\nAuyang (1995) are the first systematic monographs on the philosophy of\nQFT. The anthologies Brown and Harré (1988), Cao (1999) and\nKuhlmann et al. (2002) are anthologies with contributions by\nphysicists and philosophers (of physics), the last of which\nfocuses on ontological issues. The literature on the philosophy of QFT\nhas increased significantly in the last decade. Besides several papers there are a few new monographs, Cao (2010), Kuhlmann (2010), Ruetsche (2011) and Duncan (2012) and a special issue (May 2011) of Studies in History\nand Philosophy of Modern Physics. Bain (2011), Huggett (2000), Ruetsche (2002) and Swanson (2017) provide article length discussions on a number of\nissues in the philosophy of QFT. See also the following supplementary document:  \n\nThe crucial step towards quantum field theory is in some\nrespects analogous to the corresponding quantization in quantum\nmechanics, namely by imposing commutation relations, which leads to\noperator valued quantum fields. The starting point is the classical\nLagrangian formulation of mechanics, which is a so-called analytical\nformulation as opposed to the standard version of Newtonian mechanics.\nA generalized notion of momentum (the\nconjugate or canonical momentum) is defined by\nsetting \\(p = \\partial L/\\partial\\dot{q}\\), where \\(L(q, \\dot{q})\\) is\nthe Lagrange function, or Lagrangian. Here \\(\\dot{q}\\equiv dq/dt\\).\nThe Lagrangian defines the theory, so it has no a-priori\ndefinition. The special case of the Newtonian theory is described by\n\\(L = T - V\\) (\\(T\\) is the Newtonian kinetic energy and \\(V\\) the\npotential).  This fact can be motivated by looking at the special case\nof a Lagrange function with a potential \\(V\\) which depends only on\nthe position so that (using Cartesian coordinates) \\(\\partial\nL/\\partial\\dot{x} = (\\partial/\\partial\\dot{x})(m\\dot{x}^2 /2) =\nm\\dot{x} = p_x\\).  Under these conditions the generalized momentum\ncoincides with the Newtonian mechanical momentum. In classical\nLagrangian field  theory one associates with the given field\n\\(\\phi\\) a second field, namely the conjugate field \nwhere \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is a Lagrangian density. The field \\(\\phi\\) and\nits conjugate field \\(\\pi\\) are the direct analogues of the canonical\ncoordinate \\(q\\) and the generalized (canonical or conjugate) momentum\n\\(p\\) in classical mechanics of point particles. \n\nIn both cases, QM and QFT, requiring that the canonical variables\nsatisfy certain commutation relations implies that the basic\nquantities become operator valued. From a physical point of view this\nshift implies a restriction of possible measurement values for\nphysical quantities some (but not all) of which can have their values\nonly in discrete steps now. In QFT the canonical commutation\nrelations for a field \\(\\phi\\) and the corresponding conjugate field \\(\\pi\\)\nare \n\nNote these are equal-time commutation relations, i.e., these commutators\nrefer to fields at the same time. It is not obvious that the\nequal-time commutation relations are Lorentz invariant but one can\nformulate a manifestly covariant form of the canonical commutation\nrelations. The relations above apply to a bosonic field, like\nthe Klein-Gordon field or the electromagnetic field. For a fermionic\nfield, like the Dirac field for electrons, one has to use\nanticommutation relations. \n\nWhile there are close analogies between quantization in QM and in QFT\nthere are also important differences. Whereas the commutation\nrelations in QM refer to a quantum object with three degrees of\nfreedom, so that one has a set of 15 equations, the commutation\nrelations in QFT do in fact comprise an infinite number of equations,\nnamely for each of the infinitely many space-time 4-tuples\n\\((\\mathbf{x},t)\\) there is a new set of commutation\nrelations. This infinite number of degrees of freedom embodies the\nfield character of QFT. \n\nIt is important to realize that the operator valued field\n\\(\\phi(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) in QFT is not analogous\nto the wavefunction \\(\\psi(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) in QM, i.e.,\nthe quantum mechanical state in its position representation. While the\nwavefunction in QM is acted upon by observables/operators, in QFT it\nis the (operator valued) field itself which acts on the space of\nstates. In a certain sense the single particle wave functions have\nbeen transformed, via their reinterpretation as operator valued\nquantum fields, into observables. This step is sometimes called\n‘second quantization’ because the single particle wave equations in relativistic QM already came about by a quantization\nprocedure, e.g., in the case of the Klein-Gordon equation by replacing\nposition and momentum by the corresponding quantum mechanical\noperators. Afterwards the solutions to these single particle wave\nequations, which are states in relativistic QM, are considered as\nclassical fields, which can be subjected to the canonical quantization\nprocedure of QFT. The term ‘second quantization’ has often\nbeen criticized partly because it blurs the important fact that the\nsingle particle wave function \\(\\phi\\) in relativistic QM and the\noperator valued quantum field \\(\\phi\\) are fundamentally different kinds\nof entities despite their connection in the context of discovery. \n\nIn conclusion, it must be emphasized that both in QM and QFT\nstates and observables are equally important. However, to\nsome extent their roles are switched. While states in QM can have a\nconcrete spatio-temporal meaning in terms of probabilities for\nposition measurements, in QFT states are abstract entities and it is\nthe quantum field operators that seem to allow for a spatio-temporal\ninterpretation. See the section on the field interpretation of QFT for\na critical discussion. \n\nUp to this point, the aim was to develop a free field theory. Doing\nso does not only neglect interaction with other particles (fields), it\nis even unrealistic for one free particle because it interacts with\nthe field that it generates itself. For the description of\ninteractions—such as scattering in particle colliders—we need certain extensions and modifications of the formalism. The\nimmediate contact between scattering experiments and QFT is given by\nthe scattering or S-matrix which contains all the relevant predictive\ninformation about, e.g., scattering cross sections. \nThere are many schemes to calculate the S-matrix, among which one introduces the\nHamiltonian formalism. The Hamiltonian density can be derived from the Lagrangian density by means of a Legendre transformation. \n\nTo discuss interactions it is convenient to introduce a new\nrepresentation, the interaction picture, which is an\nalternative to the Schrödinger and the Heisenberg picture. For\nthe interaction picture one splits up the Hamiltonian, which is the\ngenerator of time-translations, into two parts \\(H = H_0 +\nH_{\\textit{int}}\\), where \\(H_0\\) describes the free system, i.e.,\nwithout interaction. It is solved exactly, and gets absorbed in a\nre-definition of the fields. Then \\(H_{\\textit{int}}\\) is the\ninteraction part of the Hamiltonian, or short the ‘interaction\nHamiltonian.’ Using the interaction picture is advantageous\nbecause the equations of motion as well as, under certain conditions,\nthe commutation relations are the same for interacting fields as for\nfree fields. Therefore, various results that were established for free\nfields can still be used in the case of interacting fields. The\ncentral instrument for the description of scattering is again the\nS-matrix, which expresses the connection between in and out states by\nspecifying the transition amplitudes. In QED, for instance, a state\n\\(|\\textit{in}\\rangle\\) describes one particular configuration of electrons,\npositrons and photons, i.e., it describes how many of these particles\nthere are and which momenta, spins and polarizations they have before\nthe interaction. The S-matrix supplies the transition amplitude that\nthis state goes over to a particular \\(|\\textit{out}\\rangle\\) state,\ne.g., that a particular counter responds after the interaction. The\ntransition amplitude is squared to form a probability, and such\nprobabilities are checked in experiments. \n\nThe canonical formalism of QFT as introduced in the previous section\nis only applicable in the case of free fields since the inclusion of\ninteraction leads to infinities (see the historical part). Since\nlittle of realistic models can be solved exactly, perturbation theory\nmakes up a large part of most publications on QFT. The importance of\nperturbative methods is understandable realizing that they establish\nthe immediate contact between theory and experiment. Although the\ntechniques of perturbation theory have become ever more sophisticated\nit is somewhat disturbing that perturbative methods are difficult to\navoid. Some have argued this is a matter of principle. (And on the\nother hand, physicists have been astonishingly creative in developing\n“toy models— that can be solved exactly, precisely to\nescape perturbation theory.)  One reason for unease is that\nperturbation theory is felt to be rather a matter of (highly\nsophisticated) craftsmanship than of understanding\nnature. Accordingly, the corpus of perturbative methods plays a small\nrole in philosophical investigations of QFT. Two recent exceptions are\nFraser (2018) and Passon (2019). What does matter, however, is in\nwhich sense the consideration of realistic interactions affects the\ngeneral framework of QFT. An overview about perturbation theory is\ngiven in section 4.1 (“Perturbation Theory—Philosophy and\nExamples”) of Peskin & Schroeder (1995). \n\nSome theories, in particular those of current particle physics, are\ndistinguished by being gauge invariant, which means\nthat gauge transformations of certain terms do not change any\nobservable quantities. A gauge transformation is a local symmetry\ntransformation, with parameters that are smooth functions of the\nposition \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) and time \\(t\\). Requiring gauge invariance\nprovides an elegant and systematic way of introducing models for\ninteracting fields. Moreover, gauge invariance plays an important role\nin selecting theories. The prime example of an intrinsically gauge\ninvariant theory is electrodynamics. In the potential formulation of\nMaxwell’s equations one introduces the vector potential\n\\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and the scalar potential \\(\\phi\\), which are linked to\nthe magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) and the electric field\n\\(\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) by \n or covariantly \n\nwhere \\(F^{\\mu \\nu}\\) is the electromagnetic field\ntensor and \\(A^{\\mu} = (\\phi , \\mathbf{A})\\) the\n4-vector potential. The important point in the present context is\nthat given the identification (2.3), or (2.4), there remains a certain\nflexibility or freedom in the choice of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\phi\\),\nor \\(A^{\\mu}\\). In order to see that, consider the\nso-called gauge transformations \n or covariantly \n where \\(\\chi\\) is a scalar function (of space and time or of space-time)\nwhich can be chosen arbitrarily. Inserting the transformed\npotential(s) into equation(s) (2.3), or (2.4), one can see that the\nelectric field \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and the magnetic field\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\), or covariantly the electromagnetic field tensor\n\\(F^{\\mu \\nu}\\), are not affected by a gauge transformation of the potential(s). Since only the electric field\n\\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and the magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), and\nquantities constructed from them, are observable, whereas the vector\npotential itself is not, nothing physical seems to be changed by a\ngauge transformation because it leaves \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\) unaltered. Note that gauge invariance is a kind of\nsymmetry that does not come about by space-time transformations. \n\nIn order to link the notion of gauge invariance to the Lagrangian\nformulation of QFT one needs a more general form of gauge\ntransformations which applies to the field operator \\(\\phi\\) and which\nis supplied by \n where \\(\\Lambda\\) is an arbitrary real constant. Equations (2.7)\ndescribe a global gauge transformation whereas a\nlocal gauge transformation  \n\nvaries with \\(x\\). \n \nIt turned out that requiring invariance under local gauge\ntransformations supplies a systematic way for finding the equations\ndescribing fundamental interactions. For instance, starting with the\nLagrangian for a free electron, the requirement of local gauge\ninvariance can only be fulfilled by introducing additional terms,\nnamely those for the electromagnetic field. Gauge invariance can be\ncaptured by certain symmetry groups: \\(\\mathrm{U}(1)\\) for\nelectromagnetic, \\(\\mathrm{SU}(2)\\otimes\\mathrm{U}(1)\\) for\nelectroweak and \\(\\mathrm{SU}(3)\\) for strong interaction. This has\nbecome an important basis for unification programs, as is the analogy\nto general relativity where a local gauge symmetry (general\ncovariance) leads to the Einstein-Hilbert theory of the gravitational\nfield. Moreover, gauge invariant quantum field theories are\ngenerically renormalizable. (There are many renormalizable theories,\nbut finding theories with massive vector fields was stopped for\ndecades before gauge theories and the Higgs mechanism came into the\nfore.) All this can be taken to show that a mathematically rich\nframework, with surplus structures, can be very valuable in the\nconstruction of theories. \nAuyang (1995) emphasizes the general conceptual significance of\ninvariance principles; Redhead (2002) and Martin (2002) focus\nspecifically on gauge symmetries. Healey (2007) and Lyre (2004 and\n2012) discuss the ontological significance of gauge theories, among\nother things concerning the Aharanov-Bohm effect and ontic structural\nrealism. \n\nIn the 1970s a program emerged in which the theories of the standard\nmodel of elementary particle physics are considered as effective field\ntheories (EFTs) which have a common quantum field theoretical\nframework. EFTs describe relevant phenomena only in a certain domain\nsince the Lagrangian contains only those terms that describe particles\nwhich are relevant for the respective range of energy. EFTs are\ninherently approximative and change with the range of energy\nconsidered. EFTs are only applicable on a certain energy scale, i.e.,\nthey only describe phenomena in a certain range of energy. Influences\nfrom higher energy processes contribute to average values but they\ncannot be described in detail. This procedure has no severe\nconsequences since the details of low-energy theories are largely\ndecoupled from higher energy processes. Both domains are only\nconnected by altered coupling constants and the renormalization group\ndescribes how the coupling constants depend on the energy. \n\nThe main idea of EFTs is that theories, i.e., in particular the\nLagrangians, depend on the energy of the phenomena which are\nanalysed. The physics changes by switching to a different energy\nscale, e.g., new particles can be created if a certain energy\nthreshold is exceeded. The dependence of theories on the energy\nscale distinguishes QFT from, e.g., Newton’s theory of gravitation\nwhere the same law applies to an apple as well as to the moon.\nNevertheless, laws from different energy scales are not completely\nindependent of each other. A central aspect of considerations about\nthis dependence are the consequences of higher energy processes on the\nlow-energy scale. \n\nOn this background a new attitude towards renormalization developed in\nthe 1970s, which revitalizes earlier ideas that divergences result\nfrom neglecting unknown processes of higher energies. Low-energy\nbehavior is thus affected by higher energy processes. Since higher\nenergies correspond to smaller distances this dependence is to be\nexpected from an atomistic point of view. According to the\nreductionist program the dynamics of constituents on the microlevel\nshould determine processes on the macrolevel, i.e., here the\nlow-energy processes. However, as, for instance hydrodynamics shows,\nin practice theories from different levels are not quite as closely\nconnected because a law which is applicable on the macrolevel can be\nlargely independent of microlevel details. For this reason analogies\nwith statistical mechanics play an important role in the discussion\nabout EFTs. The basic idea of this new story about renormalization is\nthat the influences of higher energy processes are localizable in a\nfew structural properties which can be captured by an adjustment of\nparameters. “In this picture, the presence of infinities in\nquantum field theory is neither a disaster, nor an asset. It is simply\na reminder of a practical limitation—we do not know what happens\nat distances much smaller than those we can look at directly”\n(Georgi 1989: 456). This new attitude supports the view that\nrenormalization is the appropriate answer to the change of fundamental\ninteractions when the QFT is applied to processes on different energy\nscales. The price one has to pay is that EFTs are only valid in a\nlimited domain and should be considered as approximations to better\ntheories on higher energy scales. This prompts the important question\nwhether there is a last fundamental theory in this tower of EFTs which\nsupersede each other with rising energies. Some people conjecture\nthat this deeper theory could be a string theory, i.e., a theory which\nis not a field theory any more. Or should one ultimately expect from\nphysics theories that they are only valid as approximations and in a\nlimited domain? Hartmann (2001) and Castellani (2002) discuss the fate\nof reductionism vis-à-vis EFTs. Williams (2019) argues that EFTs by no means undermine a realist interpretation of QFT, provided one adopts a more refined notion of scientific realism. Wallace (2011) and Fraser\n(2011) discuss what the successful application of renormalization\nmethods in quantum statistical mechanics means for their role in QFT,\nreaching very different conclusions. Egg et al. (2017) review that debate by comparing it to Bohmian QFT. \nThe “standard model of elementary particle physics” is\nsometimes used almost synonymously with QFT. However, there is a\ncrucial difference. While the standard model is a theory with a fixed\nontology (understood in a prephilosophical sense), i.e. three\nfundamental forces and a certain number of elementary particles, QFT\nis rather a frame, the applicability of which is open. Thus while\nquantum chromodynamics (or ‘QED’) is a part of the standard\nmodel, it is an instance  of a quantum field theory, or short\n“a quantum field theory” and not a part of QFT. This\nsection deals with only some particularly important proposals that go\nbeyond the standard model, but which do not necessarily break up the\nbasic framework of QFT.\n \nThe standard model of particle physics covers the electromagnetic, the\nweak and the strong interaction. However, the fourth fundamental force\nin nature, gravitation, has defied quantization so far. Although\nnumerous attempts have been made in the last 80 years, and in\nparticular very recently, there is no commonly accepted solution up to\nthe present day. One basic problem is that the mass, length and time\nscales quantum gravity theories are dealing with are so extremely\nsmall that it is almost impossible to test the different\nproposals. \n\nThe most important extant versions of quantum gravity theories are canonical quantum\ngravity, loop theory and string theory. Canonical quantum gravity\napproaches leave the basic structure of QFT untouched\nand just extend the realm of QFT by quantizing gravity.\nOther approaches try to reconcile quantum theory and general\nrelativity theory not by supplementing the reach of QFT but rather by\nchanging QFT itself. String theory, for instance, proposes a\ncompletely new view concerning the most fundamental building blocks:\nIt does not merely incorporate gravitation but it formulates a new\ntheory that describes all four interactions in a unified way, namely\nin terms of strings (see next subsection). \n\nWhile quantum gravity theories are very complicated and even more\nremote from classical thinking than QM, SRT and GRT, it is not so\ndifficult to see why gravitation is far more difficult to deal with\nthan the other three forces. Electromagnetic, weak and strong force\nall act in a given space-time. In contrast, gravitation is, according\nto GRT, not an interaction that takes place in time, but\ngravitational forces are identified with the curvature of space-time\nitself. Thus quantizing gravitation could amount to quantizing\nspace-time, and it is not at all clear what that could mean. One\ncontroversial proposal is to deprive space-time of its fundamental\nstatus by showing how it “emerges ” in some\nnon-spatio-temporal theory. The “emergence” of space-time\nthen means that there are certain derived terms in the new theory that\nhave some formal features commonly associated with space-time. See\nKiefer (2007) for physical details, Rickles (2008) for an accessible\nand conceptually reflected introduction to quantum gravity and\nWüthrich (2005) for a philosophical evaluation of the alleged\nneed to quantize the gravitational field. Also, see the entry on\nquantum gravity.\n \n\nString theory is one of the most promising candidates for bridging\nthe gap between QFT and general relativity theory by supplying a\nunified theory of all natural forces, including gravitation. The\nbasic idea of string theory is not to take particles as fundamental\nobjects but strings that are very small but extended in one\ndimension. This assumption has the pivotal consequence that strings\ninteract on an extended distance and not at a point. This difference\nbetween string theory and standard QFT is essential because it is the\nreason why string theory also encompasses the gravitational force\nwhich is very difficult to deal with in the framework of QFT. \n\nIt is so hard to reconcile gravitation with QFT because the typical\nlength scale of the gravitational force is very small, namely at\nPlanck scale, so that the quantum field theoretical assumption of\npoint-like interaction leads to untreatable infinities. To put it\nanother way, gravitation becomes significant (in particular in\ncomparison to strong interaction) exactly where QFT is most severely\nendangered by infinite quantities. The extended interaction of\nstrings brings it about that such infinities can be avoided. In\ncontrast to the entities in standard quantum physics strings are not\ncharacterized by quantum numbers but only by their geometrical and\ndynamical properties. Nevertheless, “macroscopically”\nstrings look like quantum particles with quantum numbers. A basic\ngeometrical distinction is the one between open strings, i.e., strings\nwith two ends, and closed strings which are like bracelets. The\ncentral dynamical property of strings is their mode of excitation,\ni.e., how they vibrate. \n\nReservations about string theory are mostly due to the lack of\ntestability since it seems that there are no empirical consequences\nwhich could be tested by the methods which are, at least up to now,\navailable to us. The reason for this “problem” is that the\nlength scale of strings is in the average the same as the one of\nquantum gravity, namely the Planck length of approximately\n\\(10^{-33}\\) centimeters which lies far beyond the\naccessibility of feasible particle experiments. But there are also\nother peculiar features of string theory which might be hard to\nswallow. One of them is the fact that preferred models of string theory need\nspace-time with 10, 11 or even 26 dimensions. In order to explain the\nappearance of only four space-time dimensions string theory assumes\nthat the other dimensions are somehow folded away or\n“compactified” so that they are no longer visible. An\nintuitive idea can be gained by thinking of a macaroni which is a\ntube, i.e., a two-dimensional piece of pasta rolled together, but\nwhich looks from the distance like a one-dimensional string. \n\nDue to the problems of string theory, many physicists have abandoned it, but not all. Some\n think that, among the numerous alternative proposals for reconciling quantum physics and general relativity theory, string theory is still the best candidate, with\n“loop quantum gravity” as its strongest rival (see the\nentry on\n quantum gravity). \nCorrespondingly, string theory has also received some attention within\nthe philosophy of physics community in recent years. Probably the\nfirst philosophical investigation of string theory is Weingard (2001)\nin Callender & Huggett (2001), an anthology with further related\narticles. Dawid (2003) (see Other Internet Resources below) argues\nthat string theory has significant consequences for the philosophical\ndebate about realism, namely that it speaks against the plausibility\nof anti-realistic positions. Also see Dawid (2009). Johansson and\nMatsubara (2011) assess string theory from various different\nmethodological perspectives, reaching conclusions in disagreement with\nDawid (2009). Standard introductory monographs on string theory are\nPolchinski (2000) and Kaku (1999). Greene (1999) is a very successful\npopular introduction. An interactive website with a nice elementary\nintroduction is ‘Stringtheory.com’ (see the Other Internet\nResources section below). \nThere are three main motives for reformulating conventional QFT. The\nfirst motive is operationalism, the second one mathematical rigour and\nthe third one finding a way to deal with the availability of\ninequivalent Hilbert space representations for systems with an\ninfinite number of degrees of freedom, such as fields. While in\nprinciple the three motives are independent of one another there are\nmultiple interconnections in their actual implementation. One way in\nwhich the three motives are connected is the following: In QFT the\nquests for operationalism and mathematical rigour seem to go hand in\nhand, i.e. the best means to achieve one is also the best way to\nachieve the other. Moreover, it leads to an algebraic formulation that\navoids privileging one amoung various available inequivalent\nrepresentations, which tacitly happens in conventional QFT. \nThe first motive–operationalism–is not so higly valued any\nmore today, and for good reasons (see entry on Operationalism).\nNevertheless, it was, not only in physics, very strong in and around\nthe 1950s, when axiomatic reformulations of QFT entered the scene.\nAccordingly, the impact of operationalism must not by overlooked.\nAlready in the 1930s the problem of perturbative infinities (see\nSupplement “The History of QFT”) as well as the\npotentially heuristic status of the Lagrangian formulation of QFT\nstimulated the search for concise and ideally axiomatic\nreformulations. About a dacade later it became clear that\noperationalism and mathematical rigour may go hand in hand, because\nthe setting of conventional QFT—where quantum fields are basic,\nwith field values being assigned to points in spacetime—is both\nmathematically ill-defined and in conflict with the\n“operational” idea that the core elements of an empirical\ntheory should be observable quantities, which can be measured by means\nof certain physical operations. \nThe mathematical aspect of the problem is that a field at a point,\n\\(\\phi (x)\\), is not an operator on a Hilbert space. The physical\ncounterpart of the problem is that it would require an infinite amount\nof energy to measure a field at a point of space-time. One way to\nhandle this situation—and one of the starting points for\naxiomatic reformulations of QFT—is not to consider fields at a\npoint but instead fields which are smeared out in the vicinity of that\npoint using certain functions, so-called test functions. The result is\na smeared field \\(\\phi (f) = \\int \\phi (x) f(x) dx\\) with\nsupp\\((f)\\subset \\mathcal{O}\\), where supp(\\(f\\)) is the support of\nthe test function \\(f\\) and \\(\\mathcal{O}\\) is a bounded open region\nin Minkowski space-time. In Wightman’s field axiomatics from the\nearly 1950s, the basic entities are then polynomial algebras\n\\(P(\\mathcal{O})\\) of smeared fields, i.e., sums of products of\nsmeared fields in finite space-time regions \\(\\mathcal{O}\\).  Thus it\nreplaces the mapping \\(x \\rightarrow \\phi (x)\\) in the conventional\nformulation of QFT by \\(\\mathcal{O} \\rightarrow P(\\mathcal{O})\\). \nFrom an operationalist perspective equally troublesome as point-like\nquantities are global quantities, like total charge, total energy or\ntotal momentum of a field. They are unobservable since their\nmeasurement would have to take place in the whole universe.\nAccordingly, quantities which refer to infinitely extended regions of\nspace-time should not appear among the observables of the theory, as\nthey do in the standard formulation of QFT. In the discussion of such\n“parochial observables” below we will see that it is not\nso clear in the end whether this is really a good argument (see\nRuetsche 2011 and Feintzeig 2018). In any case, however, it has been\nimportant in the formation of axiomatic reformulations of QFT. \nAnother operationalist reason for favouring algebraic formulations\nderives from the fact that two quantum fields are physically\nequivalent when they generate the same algebras of local observables.\nSuch equivalent quantum field theories belong to the same so-called\nBorchers class which entails that they lead to the same \\(S\\)-matrix.\nAs Haag (1996) stresses,\nfields are only an instrument in order to “coordinatize”\nobservables, more precisely: sets of observables, with respect to\ndifferent finite space-time regions. The choice of a particular field\nsystem is to a certain degree conventional, namely as long as it\nbelongs to the same Borchers class. Thus it is more appropriate to\nconsider these algebras, rather than quantum fields, as the\nfundamental entities in QFT. The resulting operationalistic view of\nQFT is that it is a statistical theory about\nlocal measurement outcomes, expressed in terms\nof local algebras of observables. Thus, it is no surprise\nthat Haag’s (1996) famous textbook on “Algebraic\nQFT”, the most successful axiomatic reformulation, bears the\ntitle “Local Quantum Physics.” \nSo far, we focussed on the operationalist motives for reformulating\nQFT and some of its consequences. Now we will distinguish different,\npartly competing ways of implementing these general ideas. The second\nmotive—mathematical rigour—consists foremost in the quest\ntowards a concise axiomatic formulation, instead\nof the grab bag of conventional QFT, with its numerous mathematically\ndubious, even though successful, approximation techniques. This quest\ncomprises three parts, namely, first, the choice of those entities\nupon which the axioms are to be imposed, second, the choice of\nappropriate axioms, and, third, the proof that one has actually\nachieved an axiomatic reformulation of\nconventional QFT, which can reproduce all the established empirical\nand theoretical successes. While axiomatic approaches are clear and\nsharp on the first two counts, their success is more limited with\nrespect to the third. In general, one can say there are valuable\nsuccesses with respect to very general theoretical insights, such as\nthe connection of spin and statistics as well as non-localizability,\nwhile the weak point is the lack of realistic models for interacting\nquantum field theories. Since the fundamental entities in axiomatic\nreformulations of QFT are algebras (of smeared\nfield operators or of observables) instead of quantum\nfields, reformulating QFT in algebraic terms and\nin axiomatic terms are enterprises with a large factual overlap.\nHowever, only one attempt to reformulate QFT axiomatically bears the\nname “Algebraic Quantum Field\nTheory,” because it is here that the algebraic structure of the\nfundamental entities was first fully realized and is explicity at the\ncentre. However, trying to do this in a strictly axiomatic way, one\nonly gets ‘reformulations’ which are not as rich as\nstandard QFT. As Haag (1996) concedes, the “algebraic approach\n[…] has given us a frame and a language not a theory.” \nWightman’s “field axiomatics”,\nalready mentioned above, is–besides AQFT–one of the two\nmost prominent proposals, for an axiomatisation of QFT. Both\noriginated in the 1950s and influenced each other in their\nformation. In Wightman’s field axiomatics, the entities upon\nwhich the axioms are imposed are smeared field operators, in fact\npolynomial algebras \\(P(\\mathcal{O})\\) thereof. The crucial axioms are\ncovariance, microcausality\n(spacelike separated field operators required to either commute or\nanticommute), and spectrum condition (positive\nenergy in all Lorentz frames, so that the vacuum is a stable ground\nstate). One shortcoming of this approach is that field operators are\ngauge-dependent and thereby arguably not qualified as directly\nrepresenting physical quantities. Moreover, the use of unbounded\nfield operators makes Wightman’s approach mathematically\ncumbersome. \nIn contrast, Algebraic Quantum Field Theory\n(AQFT)—the most successful attempt to\nreformulate QFT axiomatically—employs only bounded operators. It\nbuilds upon work in the 1940s by Gelfand, Neumark, and in particular\nSegal, who tried to describe quantum physics in terms of \\(C\\)*-algebras\n[section 4.1. in the entry Quantum Theory and Mathematical\nRigour has a more detailed account]. The notion of a \\(C\\)*-algebra\ngeneralizes the notion of\nthe algebra \\(\\mathcal{B(H)}\\) of all\nbounded operators on a Hilbert space \\(\\mathcal{H}\\),\nwhich is also the most important\nexample for a \\(C\\)*-algebra. In\nfact, it can be shown that any \\(C\\)*-algebra\nis isomorphic to a (norm-closed,\nself-adjoint) algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space. The\nboundedness (and self-adjointness) of the operators is the reason why\n\\(C\\)*-algebras are considered as\nideal for representing physical observables. The ‘C’\nindicates that one is dealing with a complex vector space and the\n‘*’ refers to the operation that maps an element \\(A\\)\nof an algebra to its\ninvolution (or adjoint) \\(A\\)*,\nwhich generalizes the conjugate complex of\ncomplex numbers to operators. This involution is needed in order to\ndefine the crucial norm property of \\(C\\)*-algebras,\nwhich is of central importance for the\nproof of the above isomorphism claim. \nAQFT takes so-called nets of algebras as basic for the\nmathematical description of quantum systems, i.e. the mapping \\(\\mathcal{O}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{O})\\)\nfrom\nfinite space-time regions to algebras of local observables. The\ninsight behind this apporoach is that the net structure of algebras,\ni.e. the very way how algebras of local observables are linked to\nspace-time regions, supplies observables with physical significance.\nIn this rather abstract setting, physical states are identified as\npositive, linear, normalized functionals which map elements of local\nalgebras to real numbers. States can thus be understood as assignments\nof expectation values to observables. Via the so-called\nGelfand-Neumark-Segal construction, one can recover the concrete\nHilbert space representations in the conventional formalism. Thus,\n“all the Hilbert spaces we will ever need are hidden inside the\nalgebra itself” (Halvorson & Müger 2007, section\n7). \nAQFT then imposes a whole list of axioms on the abstract algebraic\nstructure, namely relativistic axioms (in particular locality and\ncovariance), general physical assumptions (e.g. the spectrum\ncondition), and finally some technical assumptions concerning the\nmathematical formulation. The principle of (Einstein)\ncausality is the main relativistic ingredient of AQFT: All\nobservables of a local algebra connected with a space-time region\n\\(\\mathcal{O}\\) are required to\ncommute with all observables of another algebra which is associated\nwith a space-time region \\(\\mathcal{O}'\\)\nthat is space-like separated from\n\\(\\mathcal{O}\\). As a\nreformulation of QFT, AQFT is expected to\nreproduce the main features of QFT, like the existence of\nantiparticles, internal quantum numbers, the relation of spin and\nstatistics, etc. That this aim could not be achieved on a purely\naxiomatic basis is partly due to the fact that the connection between\nthe respective key concepts of AQFT and QFT, i.e., algebras of\nobservables and quantum fields, is not sufficiently clear. One main\nlink are superselection rules, which put restrictions on the\nset of all observables and allow for classification schemes in terms\nof permanent or essential properties. \nToday, many philosophers of physics who work on QFT rest most of their\nconsiderations on AQFT. This predominance of AQFT for foundational\nstudies about QFT becomes problematic, however, when AQFT is seen as a\nphysical theory in competition to Conventional QFT (CQFT). Wallace\n(2006, 2011) even urges that, seen from today, CQFT succeeded, whereas\nAQFT failed, so that “to be lured away from the Standard Model\nby [AQFT] is sheer madness” (Wallace 2011:124). Contra Wallace,\nFraser (2011) questions Wallace’s crucial point in defense of\nCQFT, namely that the application of renormalization group techniques\nin QFT finally solved the problem of ultraviolet divergences that\ntroubled CQFT in the 1950s. The empirical success of renormalization\nin CQFT leaves the physical reasons for this success in the dark,\nargues Fraser, unlike in condensed matter physics, where its success\nis due to the fact that matter is discrete at atomic length\nscales. \nUltimately, the most reasonable position may be a liberal one,\naccording to which neither of the three, AQFT, Wightman’s field\naxiomatics and CQFT, should be regarded as rival research programs,\nonly one of which can and should survive (Kuhlmann 2010b, Swanson\n2017). Wightman’s Axiomatic QFT is fruitful in the construction\nof concrete models, AQFT is advantageous for ontological\nconsiderations because it clearly separates fundamental and derived\nentities, and CQFT is very good for actual calculations of the high\nenergy physicist. \nThe monographs Haag (1996) and Horuzhy (1990) and the articles Haag\n& Kastler (1964), Roberts (1990), Buchholz (1998) are\nintroductions to AQFT. Halvorson & Müger (2007), Ruetsche\n(2011) and Ruetsche (2012a,b) are tailored for philosophers of\nphysics, where the first emphasizes technical and the latter\ninterpretive issues. Streater & Wightman (1964) is an early\npioneering monograph on axiomatic QFT. Bratteli & Robinson (1997)\nis a classic on the mathematical theory of operator algebras,\nemphasising physical applications.  Philosophical studies on AQFT can\nbe found, among many others, in Baker (2009), Baker & Halvorson\n(2010), Earman & Fraser (2006), Fraser (2008, 2009, 2011),\nFeintzeig (2018), Feintzeig et al.  (2019), Feintzeig and Weatherall\n(2019), Kronz & Lupher (2005), Kuhlmann (2010a, 2010b), Lupher\n(2018), Miller (2018), Rédei & Valente (2010), and Ruetsche\n(2002, 2003, 2006, 2011). \nThe third important problem for standard QFT which prompted\nreformulations is the existence of inequivalent\nrepresentations. In the context of quantum mechanics,\nSchrödinger, Dirac, Jordan and von Neumann realized that\nHeisenberg’s matrix mechanics and Schrödinger’s wave\nmechanics are just two (unitarily) equivalent representations of the\nsame underlying abstract structure, i.e., an abstract Hilbert space\n\\(\\mathcal{H}\\) and linear operators\nacting on this space. We are merely dealing with two different ways\nfor representing the same physical reality, and it is possible to\nswitch between these different representations by means of a unitary\ntransformation, i.e. an operation that is analogous to an innocuous\nrotation of the frame of reference.\nRepresentations of some given algebra or group\nare sets of mathematical objects, like numbers, rotations or more\nabstract transformations (e.g. differential operators) together with a\nbinary operation (e.g. addition or multiplication) that combines any\ntwo elements of the algebra or group, such that the structure of the\nalgebra or group to be represented is preserved. This means that the\ncombination of any two elements in the representation space, say \\(a\\)\nand \\(b\\),\nleads to a third element which corresponds to\nthe element that results when you combine the elements corresponding\nto \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\nin the algebra or group that is represented. In\n1931 von Neumann gave a detailed proof (of a conjecture by Stone) that\nthe canonical commutation relations (CCRs) for position coordinates\nand their conjugate momentum coordinates in configuration space fix\nthe representation of these two sets of operators in Hilbert space up\nto unitary equivalence (von Neumann’s uniqueness theorem). This\nmeans that the specification of the purely algebraic CCRs suffices to\ndescribe a particular physical system. \nIn quantum field theory, however, von\nNeumann’s uniqueness theorem loses its validity since here one\nis dealing with an infinite number of degrees of freedom. Now one is\nconfronted with a multitude of unitarily inequivalent representations (UIRs)\n of the CCRs and it is not obvious what\nthis means physically and how one should cope with it. Since the\ntroublesome inequivalent representations of the CCRs that arise in QFT\nare all irreducible their inequivalence is not\ndue to the fact that some are reducible while others are not (a\nrepresentation is reducible if there is an\ninvariant subrepresentation, i.e. a subset which alone represent the\nCCRs already). Since unitarily inequivalent representations seem to describe different physical states of affairs it would no longer be legitimate to simply choose\nthe most convenient representation, just like choosing the most\nconvenient frame of reference. In principle all but one of the UIRs\ncould be physically irrelevant, i.e. mathematical artefacts of a\nredundant formalism. However, it seems that at least some irreducible\nrepresentations of the CCRs are inequivalent and\nphysically relevant. \nThese considerations motivate the algebraic point of view that\nalgebras of observables rather than observables\nthemselves in a particular representation should be taken as the basic\nentities in the mathematical description of QFT, so that the\nabove-mentioned problems are to some degree avoided from the outset.\nHowever, obviously this cannot just be the end of the story. Even if\nUIRs are not basic, it is still necessary to say what the availability\nof different UIRs means, physically and thereby ontologically. \nOne of the most fundamental interpretative obstacles concerning QFT is\nthe question which formalism to consider and to then identify which\nparts of the respective formalism carry the physical content, and\nwhich parts are surplus structure, from an ontological point of view.\nRoughly, one may distingush “Hilbert space conservatists”\nand “algebraic imperialists” (Arageorgis 1995 and Ruetsche\n2002 coined these terms).\nWhile Hilbert space conservativism seems to be the default position, often adopted without further justification, algebraic imperialism usually comes with an explicit\njustification. \nHilbert space conservatism dismisses the availability of a plethora of\nUIRs as a mathematical artifact with no physical relevance. \nIn contrast, algebraic imperialism argues that instead of choosing a particular\nHilbert space representation, one should stay on the abstract algebraic level.\nHaag & Kastler (1964) try to give an operationalist\njustification for their claim that no diverging physical content is\nencoded by the different unitarily inequivalent representations. The\ncore point of the argument is that the topology used to distinguish\nthese representations as different, namely the uniform operator\ntopology or “norm topology”, is inappropriately fine-grained (where a topology defines what is meant by the\nneighborhood of an element). Therefore, it classifies representations\nas inequivalent, which are in fact empirically and therefore\n“physically equivalent.” The whole argument depends decisively on a theorem by Fell (1960), according to which a finite\nnumber of measurements, performed with some inaccuracy, can never\ndistinguish unitarily inequivalent representations. They are\n“weakly equivalent,” a notion introduced by Fell (1960), using a weak operator topology. Invoking Fell’s theorem and equating weak equivalence and physical equivalence,\nHaag & Kastler (1964) reason that the “relevant object is the abstract algebra and not the representation. The selection of a particular (faithful) representation is a matter of convenience\nwithout physical implications. It may provide a more or less handy\nanalytical apparatus.” \nArageorgis (1995), Ruetsche (2003, 2011), Lupher & Kronz (2005),\nand most recently, Lupher (2018) attack algebraic imperialists for\nusing Fell’s theorem in order to denigrate UIRs.\nRuetsche’s most important point is that UIRs do real explanatory\nwork in physics, e.g. in quantum statistical mechanics (see Bratteli\n& Robinson 1997 and Ruetsche 2003) and in particular when it comes\nto spontaneous symmetry breaking. The coexistence of UIRs can be\nreadily understood by looking at ferromagnetism for infinite spin\nchains (see Ruetsche 2006). At high temperatures the atomic dipoles in\nferromagnetic substances fluctuate randomly. Below a certain\ntemperature the atomic dipoles tend to align to each other in some\ndirection. Since the basic laws governing this phenomenon are\nrotationally symmetrical, no direction is preferred. Thus once the\ndipoles have “chosen” one particular direction, the\nsymmetry is broken. Since there is a different ground state for each\ndirection of magnetization, one needs different Hilbert\nspace representations—each containing a unique ground state—in order to\ndescribe symmetry breaking systems. Correspondingly, one has to employ\ninequivalent representations. \nAlready Lupher & Kronz (2005) point out that an attractive\nalternative to the strict \\(C^{\\ast}\\)-algebraic\nimperialism is to extend the\nphysical content to von Neumann algebras, the elements of which are\ngenerated by representations of algebra \\(\\mathcal{A}\\).\nLupher (2018) analyzes the algebraic\nimperialists’ use of Fell’s theorem in detail and points\nout that there are important representations in the algebraic approach\nto which Fell’s theorem does not apply, in particular many \\(W^{\\ast}\\)-algebras,\nthe abstract\ncounterparts of von Neumann algebras. Moreover, he argues that it is a\n\\(W^{\\ast}\\)-algebra, namely the\nbidual \\(\\mathcal{A}^{\\ast \\ast}\\),\nwhich is the appropriate locus of physical content for the algebraic\nimperialist, to which Lupher subscribes in the form of what he dubs\n“bidualism.” One crucial advantage of taking the \\(W^{\\ast}\\)-algebra\n\\(\\mathcal{A}^{\\ast\n\\ast}\\) is that it is larger than\nthe \\(C^{\\ast}\\)-algebra \\(\\mathcal{A}\\).\nIn particular it also\ncontains what Ruetsche (2011) calls “parochial\nobservables” (or the abstract counterparts thereof), such as net\nmagnetization and particle number. Also against Ruetsche, Feintzeig\n(2018) argues that not only the universalist (or bidualist) but also\n\\(C^{\\ast}\\)-algebraic imperialism\nhas access to “parochial observables,” since it has\nadditional tools to represent such observables by means of\nidealizations from the observables in the abstract algebra. \nTo conclude, it is difficult to say how the availability of UIRs\nshould be interpreted in general. Clifton and Halvorson (2001b)\npropose seeing this as a form of complementarity. Ruetsche (2003)\nadvocates a “Swiss army approach”, according to which the\navailability of UIRs shows that physical possibilities in different\ndegrees must be included into our ontology. In addition, Ruetsche\n(2011: 119) argues that both Hilbert space conservatism and algebraic\nimperialism are extremist, or “pristine”, positions in the\nend. Accordingly, she advocates taking UIRs more seriously than in\nthese extremist approaches. As we have just seen, however, recent\nadherents of algebraic imperialism and universalism/bidualism have\naccepted the challenge. \nOne important interpretive issue where unitarily inequivalent\nrepresentations (UIRs) play a crucial role is the Unruh\neffect: a uniformly accelerated observer in a Minkowski\nvacuum should detect a thermal bath of particles, the so-called\nRindler quanta (Unruh 1976, Unruh & Wald 1984). \nThe Unruh effect constitutes a severe challenge to a particle interpretation of\nQFT, because it seems that the very existence of the basic entities of an ontology should not depend on the state of motion of the detectors. Teller (1995: 110–113) tries to dispel this problem by pointing out that while the Minkowski vacuum has the definite value zero for the Minkowski number operator, the particle number is indefinite for\nthe Rindler number operator, since one has a superposition of Rindler\nquanta states. This means that there are only propensities for\ndetecting different numbers of Rindler quanta but no actual quanta.\nHowever, this move is problematic since it seems to suggest that\nquantum physical propensities in general don’t need to be taken\nfully for real. \nClifton and Halvorson (2001b) argue, contra Teller, that it is\ninapproriate to give priority to either the Minkowski or the Rindler\nperspective. Both are needed for a complete picture. The Minkowski as\nwell as the Rindler representation are true descriptions of the world,\nnamely in terms of objective propensities. Arageorgis, Earman and\nRuetsche (2003) argue that Minkowski and Rindler (or Fulling)\nquantization do not constitute a satisfactory case of\nphysically relevant UIRs. First, there are good reasons to doubt that\nthe Rindler vacuum is a physically realizable state. Second, the\nauthors argue, the unitary inequivalence in question merely stems from\nthe fact that one representation is reducible and the other one\nirreducible: The restriction of the Minkowski vacuum to a Rindler\nwedge, i.e. what the Minkowski observer says about the Rindler wedge,\nleads to a mixed state (a thermodynamic KMS state) and therefore a\nreducible representation, whereas the Rindler vacuum is a pure state\nand thus corresponds to an irreducible representation. Therefore, the\nUnruh effect does not cause distress for the particle\ninterpretation—which the authors see to be fighting a losing\nbattle anyhow—because Rindler quanta are not real and the\nunitary inequivalence of the representations in question has nothing\nspecific to do with conflicting particle ascriptions. \nThe occurrence of UIRs is also at the core of an analysis by Fraser\n(2008). She restricts her analysis to inertial observers but compares\nthe particle notion for free and interacting systems. Fraser argues,\nfirst, that the representations for free and interacting systems are\nunavoidably unitarily inequivalent, and second, that the\nrepresentation for an interacting system does not have the minimal\nproperties that are needed for any particle interpretation—e.g.\nTeller’s (1995) quanta version—namely the countability\ncondition (quanta are aggregable) and a relativistic energy condition.\nNote that for Fraser’s negative conclusion about the tenability\nof the particle (or quanta) interpretation for QFT there is no need to\nassume localizability. \nBain (2000) has a diverging assessment of the fact that only\nasymptotically free states, i.e. states very long before or after a\nscattering interaction, have a Fock representation that allows for an\ninterpretation in terms of countable quanta. For Bain, the occurrence\nof UIRs without a particle (or quanta) interpretation for intervening\ntimes, i.e. close to scattering experiments, is irrelevant because the\ndata that are collected from those experiments always refer to systems\nwith negligible interactions. Bain concludes that although the\ninclusion of interactions does in fact lead to the break-down of the\nalleged duality of particles and fields it does not undermine the\nnotion of particles (or fields) as such. \nFraser (2008) rates this as an unsuccessful “last ditch”\nattempt to save a quanta interpretation of QFT because it is ad hoc\nand can’t even show that at least something similar to the free\nfield total number operator exists for finite times, i.e. between the\nasymptotically free states. Moreover, Fraser (2008) points out that,\ncontrary to what some authors suggest, the main source of the\nimpossibility to interpret interacting systems in terms of particles\nis not that many-particle states are inappropriately\ndescribed in the Fock representation if one deals with interacting\nfields but rather that QFT obeys special relativity theory (also see\nEarman and Fraser (2006) and Miller (2018) on Haag’s theorem). As Fraser\nconcludes, “[F]or a free system, special relativity and the\nlinear field equation conspire to produce a quanta\ninterpretation.” In his reply Bain (2011) points out that the\nreason why there is no total number operator in interacting\nrelativistic quantum field theories is that this would require an\nabsolute space-time structure, which in turn is not an appropriate\nrequirement. \nBaker (2009) points out that the main arguments against the particle\ninterpretation—concerning non-localizability (e.g. Malament\n1996) and failure for interacting systems (Fraser 2008)—may also\nbe directed against the wave functional version of the field\ninterpretation (see field interpretation (iii) above). Mathematically,\nBaker’s crucial point is that wave functional space is unitarily\nequivalent to Fock space, so that arguments against the particle\ninterpretation that attack the choice of the Fock representation may\ncarry over to the wave functional interpretation. First, a Minkowski\nand a Rindler observer may also detect different field configurations.\nSecond, if the Fock space representation is not apt to describe\ninteracting systems, then the unitarily equivalent wave functional\nrepresentation is in no better situation: Interacting fields are\nunitarily inequivalent to free fields, too. \n\nOntology is concerned with the most general features, entities and\nstructures of being. One can pursue ontology in a very general sense\nor with respect to a particular theory or a particular part or aspect\nof the world. With respect to the ontology of QFT one is tempted to\nmore or less dismiss ontological inquiries and to adopt the following\nstraightforward view. There are two groups of fundamental fermionic\nmatter constituents, two groups of bosonic force carriers and four\n(including gravitation) kinds of interactions. As satisfying as this\nanswer might first appear, the ontological questions are, in a sense,\nnot even touched. Saying that, for instance the down quark is a\nfundamental constituent of our material world is the starting point\nrather than the end of the (philosophical) search for an ontology of\nQFT. The main question is what kind of entity, e.g., the down quark\nis. The answer does not depend on whether we think of down quarks or\nmuon neutrinos since the sought features are much more general than\nthose ones which constitute the difference between down quarks or muon\nneutrinos. The relevant questions are of a different type. What are\nparticles at all? Can quantum particles be legitimately understood as\nparticles any more, even in the broadest sense, when we take, e.g.,\ntheir localization properties into account? How can one spell out\nwhat a field is and can “quantum fields” in fact be\nunderstood as fields? Could it be more appropriate not to think of,\ne.g., quarks, as the most fundamental entities at all, but rather of\nproperties or processes or events? \n\nMany of the creators of QFT can be found in one of the two camps\nregarding the question whether particles or fields should be given\npriority in understanding QFT. While Dirac, the later Heisenberg,\nFeynman, and Wheeler opted in favor of particles, Pauli, the early\nHeisenberg, Tomonaga and Schwinger put fields first (see Landsman\n1996). Today, there are a number of arguments which prepare the\nground for a proper discussion beyond mere preferences. \n\nIt seems almost impossible to talk about elementary particle\nphysics, or QFT more generally, without thinking of particles which\nare accelerated and scattered in colliders. Nevertheless, it is this\nvery interpretation which is confronted with the most fully developed\ncounter-arguments. There still is the option to say that our classical\nconcept of a particle is too narrow and that we have to loosen some of\nits constraints. After all, even in classical corpuscular theories of\nmatter the concept of an (elementary) particle is not as unproblematic\nas one might expect. For instance, if the whole charge of a particle\nwas contracted to a point, an infinite amount of energy would be\nstored in this particle since the repulsive forces become infinitely\nlarge when two charges with the same sign are brought together. The\nso-called self energy of a point particle is infinite. \n\nProbably the most immediate trait of particles is their\ndiscreteness. Particles are countable or ‘aggregable’\nentities in contrast to a liquid or a mass. Obviously this\ncharacteristic alone cannot constitute a sufficient condition for\nbeing a particle since there are other things which are countable as\nwell without being particles, e.g., money or maxima and minima of the\nstanding wave of a vibrating string. It seems that one also\nneeds individuality, i.e., it must be possible to say that it\nis this or that particle which has been counted in order to account\nfor the fundamental difference between ups and downs in a wave pattern\nand particles. Teller (1995) discusses a specific conception of\nindividuality, primitive thisness, as well as other possible\nfeatures of the particle concept in comparison to classical concepts\nof fields and waves, as well as in comparison to the concept of field\nquanta, which is the basis for the interpretation that Teller\nadvocates. A critical discussion of Teller’s reasoning can be found\nin Seibt (2002). Moreover, there is an extensive debate on\nindividuality of quantum objects in quantum mechanical systems of\n‘identical particles’. Since this discussion concerns QM\nin the first place, and not QFT, any further details shall be omitted\nhere. French and Krause (2006) offer a detailed analysis of the\nhistorical, philosophical and mathematical aspects of the connection\nbetween quantum statistics, identity and individuality. See Dieks and\nLubberdink (2011) for a critical assessment of the debate. Also\nconsult the entry on\n quantum theory: identity and individuality.\n \n\nThere is still another feature which is commonly taken to be pivotal\nfor the particle concept, namely that particles are localizable in\nspace. While it is clear from classical physics already that the\nrequirement of\nlocalizability need not refer to point-like localization, we\nwill see that even localizability in an arbitrarily large but still\nfinite region can be a strong condition for quantum particles. Bain\n(2011) argues that the classical notions of localizability and\ncountability are inappropriate requirements for particles if one is\nconsidering a relativistic theory such as QFT.\n \n\nEventually, there are some potential ingredients of the particle\nconcept which are explicitly opposed to the corresponding (and\ntherefore opposite) features of the field concept. Whereas it is a\ncore characteristic of a field that it is a system with an infinite\nnumber of degrees of freedom, the very opposite holds for\nparticles. A particle can for instance be referred to by the\nspecification of the coordinates \\(\\mathbf{x}(t)\\)\nthat pertain, e.g., to its center of mass—presupposing\nimpenetrability. A further feature of the particle concept is\nconnected to the last point and again explicitly in opposition to the\nfield concept. In a pure particle ontology the interaction between\nremote particles can only be understood as an action at a\ndistance. In contrast to that, in a field ontology, or a\ncombined ontology of particles and fields, local action is\nimplemented by mediating fields. Finally, classical particles are\nmassive and impenetrable, again in contrast to (classical) fields. \n\nThe easiest way to quantize the electromagnetic (or: radiation) field\nconsists of two steps. First, one Fourier analyses the vector\npotential of the classical field into normal modes (using periodic\nboundary conditions) corresponding to an infinite but denumerable\nnumber of degrees of freedom. Second, since each mode is described\nindependently by a harmonic oscillator equation, one can apply the\nharmonic oscillator treatment from non-relativistic quantum mechanics\nto each single mode. The result for the Hamiltonian of the radiation\nfield is \n\nwhere \\(a_{r}^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{k})\\)\nand \\(a_r (\\mathbf{k})\\) are operators which\nsatisfy the following commutation relations \n\nwith the index \\(r\\) labeling the polarisation. These\ncommutation relations imply that one is dealing with a bosonic field.\n \n\nThe operators \\(a_{r}^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{k})\\)\nand \\(a_r (\\mathbf{k})\\)\nhave interesting physical interpretations as so-called particle\ncreation and annihilation operators. In order to see this, one has to\nexamine the eigenvalues of the operators  \n\nwhich are the essential parts in \\(H_{rad}\\). Due to\nthe commutation relations (5.2) one finds that the eigenvalues of\n\\(N_r (\\mathbf{k})\\) are the integers\n\\(n_r (\\mathbf{k}) = 0, 1, 2,\\ldots\\) and the\ncorresponding eigenfunctions (up to a normalisation factor) are  \n \nwhere the right hand side means that \\(a_{r}^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{k})\\)\noperates \\(n_r (\\mathbf{k})\\) times on \\(|0\\rangle\\), the state vector\nof the vacuum with no photons present.  The interpretation of these\nresults is parallel to the one of the harmonic\noscillator. \\(a_{r}^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{k})\\) is interpreted as\nthe creation operator of a photon with momentum \\(\\hslash\n\\mathbf{k}\\) and energy \\(\\hslash \\omega_{\\mathbf{k}}\\) (and a\npolarisation which depends on \\(r\\) and \\(\\mathbf{k})\\).  That is,\nequation (5.4) can be understood in the following way. One gets a\nstate with \\(n_r (\\mathbf{k})\\) photons of momentum \\(\\hslash\n\\mathbf{k}\\) and energy \\(\\hslash \\omega_{\\mathbf{k}}\\) when the\ncreation operator \\(a_{r}^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{k})\\) operates \\(n_r\n(\\mathbf{k})\\) times on the vacuum state \\(|0\\rangle\\). Accordingly,\n\\(N_r (\\mathbf{k})\\) is called the number operator and \\(n_r\n(\\mathbf{k})\\) the ‘occupation number’ of the mode that is\nspecified by \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) and \\(r\\), i.e., this mode is occupied by\n\\(n_r (\\mathbf{k})\\) photons. Note that Pauli’s exclusion\nprinciple is not violated since it only applies to fermions and not to\nbosons like photons. The corresponding interpretation for\nthe annihilation operator \\(a_r (\\mathbf{k})\\) is parallel:\nWhen it operates on a state with a given number of photons this number\nis lowered by one. \n\nIt is a widespread view that these results complete “the\njustification for interpreting \\(N(k)\\) as the number\noperator, and hence for the particle interpretation of the quantized\ntheory” (Ryder 1996: 131). This is a rash judgement,\nhowever. For instance, the question of localizability is not even\ntouched while it is certain that this is a pivotal criterion for\nsomething to be a particle. All that is established so far is that\ncertain mathematical quantities in the formalism are\ndiscrete. However, countability is merely one feature of particles and\nnot at all conclusive evidence for a particle interpretation of\nQFT yet. It is not clear at this stage whether we are in fact\ndealing with particles or with fundamentally different objects which\nonly have this one feature of discreteness in common with\nparticles. \nTeller (1995) argues that the Fock space or “occupation number” representation does support a particle ontology in terms\nof field quanta since these can be counted or aggregated,\nalthough not numbered. The degree of excitation of a certain mode of\nthe underlying field determines the number of objects, i.e. the\nparticles in the sense of quanta. Labels for individual particles like\nin the Schrödinger many-particle formalism do not occur any more,\nwhich is the crucial deviation from the classical notion of\nparticles. However, despite of this deviation, says Teller, quanta\nshould be regarded as particles: Besides their countability another\nfact that supports seeing quanta as particles is that they have the\nsame energies as classical particles. Teller has been criticized for\ndrawing unduly far-reaching ontological conclusions from one\nparticular representation, in particular since the Fock space\nrepresentation cannot be appropriate in general because it is only\nvalid for free particles (see, e.g., Fraser 2008). In order to avoid\nthis problem Bain (2000) proposes an alternative quanta interpretation\nthat rests on the notion of asymptotically free states in scattering\ntheory. For a further discussion of the quanta interpretation see the\nsubsection on inequivalent representations below. \nThe vacuum state \\(|0\\rangle\\) is the energy ground state, i.e., the\neigenstate of the energy operator with the lowest eigenvalue. It is a\nremarkable result in ordinary non-relativistic QM that the ground\nstate energy of e.g., the harmonic oscillator is not zero in\ncontrast to its analogue in classical mechanics. In addition to this,\nthe relativistic vacuum of QFT has the even more striking\nfeature that the expectation values for various quantities do not\nvanish, which prompts the question what it is that has these values or\ngives rise to them if the vacuum is taken to be the state with no\nparticles present. If particles were the basic objects of QFT how can\nit be that there are physical phenomena even if nothing is there\naccording to this very ontology? Eventually, studies of QFT in curved\nspace-time indicate that the existence of a particle number operator\nmight be a contingent property of the flat Minkowski space-time,\nbecause Poincaré symmetry is used to pick out a preferred\nrepresentation of the canonical commutation relations which is\nequivalent to picking out a preferred vacuum state (see Wald\n1994). \nBefore exploring whether other (potentially) necessary requirements\nfor the applicability of the particle concept are fulfilled let us see\nwhat the alternatives are. Proceeding this way makes it easier to\nevaluate the force of the following arguments in a more balanced\nmanner.\n \nSince various arguments seem to speak against a particle\ninterpretation, the allegedly only alternative, namely a field\ninterpretation, is often taken to be the appropriate ontology of\nQFT. So let us see what a physical field is and why QFT may be\ninterpreted in this sense. A classical point particle can be\ndescribed by its position \\(\\mathbf{x}(t)\\) and its\nmomentum \\(\\mathbf{p}(t)\\), which change as the\ntime \\(t\\) progresses. So there are six degrees of freedom for\nthe motion of a point particle corresponding to the three coordinates\nof the particle’s position and three more coordinates for its\nmomentum. In the case of a classical field one has an independent\nvalue for each single point \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) in space, where this\nspecification changes as time progresses. The field value \\(\\phi\\) can be\na scalar quantity, like temperature, a vectorial one as for the\nelectromagnetic field, or a tensor, such as the stress tensor for a\ncrystal. A field is therefore specified by a time-dependent mapping\nfrom each point of space to a field value\n\\(\\phi(\\mathbf{x},t)\\). Thus a field is a system with\nan infinite number of degrees of freedom, which may be restrained by\nsome field equations. Whereas the intuitive notion of a field is that\nit is something transient and fundamentally different from matter, it\ncan be shown that it is possible to ascribe energy and momentum to a\npure field even in the absence of matter. This somewhat surprising\nfact shows how gradual the distinction between fields and matter\ncan be. \n\nThe transition from a classical field theory to a quantum field theory\nis characterized by the occurrence of operator-valued quantum\nfields \\(\\hat{\\phi}(\\mathbf{x},t)\\), and corresponding conjugate\nfields, for both of which certain canonical commutation relations\nhold. Thus there is an obvious formal analogy between classical and\nquantum fields: in both cases field values are attached to space-time\npoints, where these values are specified by real numbers in the case\nof classical fields and operators in the case of quantum fields. That\nis, the mapping \\(\\mathbf{x} \\mapsto \\hat{\\phi}(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) in QFT\nis analogous to the classical mapping \\(\\mathbf{x} \\mapsto\n\\phi(\\mathbf{x},t)\\).  Due to this formal analogy it appears to be\nbeyond any doubt that QFT is a field theory.\n \n\nBut is a systematic association of certain mathematical terms with all\npoints in space-time really enough to establish a field theory in a\nproper physical sense? Is it not essential for a physical field theory\nthat some kind of real physical properties are allocated to\nspace-time points? This requirement seems not fulfilled in QFT,\nhowever. Teller (1995: ch. 5) argues that the expression quantum\nfield is only justified on a “perverse reading” of\nthe notion of a field, since no definite physical values whatsoever\nare assigned to space-time points. Instead, quantum field operators\nrepresent the whole spectrum of possible values so that they rather\nhave the status of observables (Teller: “determinables”)\nor general solutions. Only a specific configuration, i.e. an\nascription of definite values to the field observables at all points\nin space, can count as a proper physical field.\n \nThere are at least four proposals for a field interpretation of QFT,\nall of which respect the fact that the operator-valuedness of quantum\nfields impedes their direct reading as physical fields. \n(i) Teller (1995) argues that definite physical quantities emerge when\nnot only the quantum field operators but also the state of the system\nis taken into account. More specifically, for a given state \\(|\\psi \\rangle\\)\none can calculate the expectation values\n\\(\\langle \\psi |\\phi(x)|\\psi \\rangle\\) which yields an ascription of\ndefinite physical values to all points x in space and thus\na configuration of the operator-valued quantum field that may\nbe seen as a proper physical field. The main problem with proposal\n(i), and possibly with (ii), too, is that an expectation value is the\naverage value of a whole sequence of measurements, so that it does not\nqualify as the physical property of any actual single field system, no\nmatter whether this property is a pre-existing (or categorical) value\nor a propensity (or disposition).\n \n(ii) The vacuum expectation value or VEV interpretation,\nadvocated by Wayne (2002), exploits a theorem by Wightman\n(1956). According to this reconstruction theorem all the information\nthat is encoded in quantum field operators can be equivalently\ndescribed by an infinite hierarchy of \\(n\\)-point vacuum\nexpectation values, namely the expectation values of all products of\nquantum field operators at \\(n\\) (in general different)\nspace-time points, calculated for the vacuum state. Since this\ncollection of vacuum expectation values comprises only definite\nphysical values it qualifies as a proper field configuration, and,\nWayne argues, due to Wightman’s theorem, so does the equivalent set of\nquantum field operators. Thus, and this is the upshot of Wayne’s\nargument, an ascription of quantum field operators to all space-time\npoints does by itself constitute a field configuration, namely for the\nvacuum state, even if this is not the actual state. \nBut this is also a problem for the VEV interpretation: While it shows\nnicely that much more information is encoded in the quantum field\noperators than just unspecifically what could be measured, it still\ndoes not yield anything like an actual field\nconfiguration. While this last requirement is likely to be too strong\nin a quantum theoretical context anyway, the next proposal may come at\nleast somewhat closer to it. \n(iii) In recent years the term wave functional interpretation\nhas been established as the name for the default field interpretation\nof QFT. Correspondingly, it is the most widely discussed extant\nproposal; see, e.g., Huggett (2003), Halvorson and Müger (2007),\nBaker (2009) and Lupher (2010). In effect, it is not very different\nfrom proposal (i), and with further assumptions for (i) even\nidentical. However, proposal (ii) phrases things differently and in a\nvery appealing way. The basic idea is that quantized fields should be\ninterpreted completely analogously to quantized one-particle states,\njust as both result analogously from imposing canonical commutation\nrelations on the non-operator-valued classical quantities. In the case\nof a quantum mechanical particle, its state can be described by a wave\nfunction \\(\\psi\\)(x), which maps positions to probability amplitudes,\nwhere \\(|\\psi(x)|^2\\) can be interpreted as the\nprobability for the particle to be measured at\nposition \\(x\\). For a field, the analogue of positions are\nclassical field configurations \\(\\phi(x)\\), i.e. assignments of\nfield values to points in space. And so, the analogy continues, just\nas a quantum particle is described by a wave function that maps\npositions to probabilities (or rather probability amplitudes) for the\nparticle to be measured at \\(x\\), quantum fields can be\nunderstood in terms of wave functionals\n\\(\\psi[\\phi(x)\\)] that map functions to numbers, namely\nclassical field configurations \\(\\phi(x)\\) to probability\namplitudes, where \\(|\\psi[\\phi(x)]|^2\\) can be\ninterpreted as the probability for a given quantum field system to be\nfound in configuration \\(\\phi(x)\\) when measured. Thus just as\na quantum state in ordinary single-particle QM can be interpreted as a\nsuperposition of classical localized particle states, the state of a\nquantum field system, so says the wave functional approach, can be\ninterpreted as a superposition of classical field configurations. And\nwhat superpositions mean depends on one’s general interpretation of\nquantum probabilities (collapse with propensities, Bohmian hidden\nvariables, branching Everettian many-worlds,…). In practice,\nhowever, QFT is hardly ever represented in wave functional space\nbecause usually there is little interest in measuring field\nconfigurations. Rather, one tries to measures ‘particle’ states and\ntherefore works in Fock space.\n \n(iv) For a modification of proposal (iii), indicated in Baker (2009:\nsec. 5) and explicitly formulated as an alternative interpretation by\nLupher (2010), see the end of the section “Non-Localizability\nTheorems” below.\n \nThe multitude of problems for particle as well as field\ninterpretations prompted a number of alternative ontological\napproaches to QFT. Auyang (1995) and Dieks (2002) propose different\nversions of event ontologies. Seibt (2002) and Hättich (2004)\ndefend process-ontological accounts of QFT, which are scrutinized in\nKuhlmann (2002, 2010a: ch. 10). In recent years, however, ontic\nstructural realism (OSR) has become the most fashionable ontological\nframework for modern physics. While so far the vast majority of\nstudies concentrates on ordinary QM and General Relativity Theory, it\nseems to be commonly believed among advocates of OSR that their case\nis even stronger regarding QFT, in light of the paramount significance\nof symmetry groups (also see below)—hence the name group\nstructural realism (Roberts 2010). Explicit arguments are few\nand far between, however.\n  \nOne of the rare arguments in favor of OSR that deal specifically\nwith QFT is due to Kantorovich (2003), who opts for a Platonic version\nof OSR; a position that is otherwise not very popular among\nOSRists. Kantorovich argues that directly after the big bang\n“the world was baryon-free, whereas the symmetry of grand\nunification existed as an abstract structure” (p. 673). Cao\n(1997b) points out that the best ontological access to QFT is gained\nby concentrating on structural properties rather than on any\nparticular category of entities. Cao (2010) advocates a\n“constructive structural realism” on the basis of a\ndetailed conceptual investigation of the formation of quantum\nchromodynamics. However, Kuhlmann (2011) shows that Cao’s position\nhas little to do with what is usually taken to be ontic structural\nrealism, and that it is not even clear whether it should at least be\nrated as an epistemic variant of structural realism.\n  The central significance of gauge theories in modern physics may\nsupport structural realism. Lyre (2004) offers a case study concerning\nthe \\(\\mathrm{U}(1)\\) gauge symmetry group, which characterizes\nQED. Recently Lyre (2012) has been advocating an intermediate form of\nOSR, which he calls “Extended OSR (ExtOSR)”, according to\nwhich there are not only relational structural properties but also\nstructurally derived intrinsic properties, namely the invariants of\nstructure: mass, spin, and charge. Lyre claims that only ExtOSR is in\na position to account for gauge theories. Moreover, it can make sense\nof zero-value properties, such as the zero mass of photons.\n \nCategory theory could be a promising framework for OSR in general and QFT in particular, because the main reservation against the radical but also seemingly incoherent idea of relations without relata may depend on the common set theoretic framework. Bain (2013) offers a category theoretic formulation of such a radical OSR, Lam and Wütrich (2015) a critique and Eva (2016) a defense. \nSee SEP entries on \n\nstructural realism \n\n(4.2 on OSR and QFT) and on \n\ncategory theory. \n\n\n \nKuhlmann (2010a) proposes a Dispositional Trope Ontology (DTO)\nas the most appropriate ontological reading of the basic structure of\nQFT, in particular in its algebraic formulation, AQFT. The term\n‘trope’ refers to a conception of properties that breaks\nwith tradition by regarding properties as particulars rather than\nrepeatables (or ‘universals’). This new conception of\nproperties permits analyzing objects as pure bundles of\nproperties/tropes without excluding the possibility of having\ndifferent objects with (qualitatively but not numerically) exactly the\nsame properties. One of Kuhlmann’s crucial points is that (A)QFT\nspeaks in favor of a bundle conception of objects because the net\nstructure of observable algebras alone (see section “Basic Ideas\nof AQFT” above) encodes the fundamental features of a given\nquantum field theory, e.g. its charge structure. \nIn the DTO approach, the essential properties/tropes of a trope bundle\nare then identified with the defining characteristics of a\nsuperselection sector, such as different kinds of charges, mass and\nspin. Since these properties cannot change by any state transition\nthey guarantee the object’s identity over time. Superselection\nsectors are inequivalent irreducible representations of the algebra of\nall quasi-local observables. While the essential properties/tropes of\nan object are permanent, its non-essential ones may change. Since we\nare dealing with quantum physical systems many properties are\ndispositions (or propensities); hence the name dispositional\ntrope ontology. \nA trope bundle is not individuated via spatio-temporal co-localization\nbut because of the particularity of its constitutive tropes. Morganti\n(2009) also advocates a trope-ontological reading of QFT, which refers\ndirectly to the classification scheme of the Standard Model.\n \n\nWigner’s (1939) famous analysis of the Poincaré group is often\nassumed to provide a definition of elementary particles. The main\nidea of Wigner’s approach is the supposition that each irreducible\n(projective) representation of the relevant space-time symmetry group\nyields the state space of one kind of elementary physical system,\nwhere the prime example is an elementary particle which has the more\nrestrictive property of being structureless. The physical\njustification for linking up irreducible representations with\nelementary systems is the requirement that “there must be no\nrelativistically invariant distinction between the various states of\nthe system” (Newton & Wigner 1949). In other words the\nstate space of an elementary system shall have no internal structure\nwith respect to relativistic transformations. Put more technically,\nthe state space of an elementary system must not contain any\nrelativistically invariant subspaces, i.e., it must be the state space\nof an irreducible representation of the relevant invariance group. If\nthe state space of an elementary system had relativistically invariant\nsubspaces then it would be appropriate to associate these subspaces\nwith elementary systems. The requirement that a state space has to be\nrelativistically invariant means that starting from any of its states\nit must be possible to get to all the other states by superposition of\nthose states which result from relativistic transformations of the\nstate one started with. The main part of Wigner’s analysis consists\nin finding and classifying all the irreducible representations of the\nPoincaré group. Doing that involves finding relativistically\ninvariant quantities that serve to classify the irreducible\nrepresentations. Wigner’s pioneering identification of types of\nparticles with irreducible unitary representations of the\nPoincaré group has been exemplary until the present, as it is\nemphasized, e.g., in Buchholz (1994). For an alternative perspective\nfocusing on “Wigner’s legacy” for ontic structural realism\nsee Roberts (2011). \n\nRegarding the question whether Wigner has supplied a definition of\nparticles, one must say that although Wigner has in fact found a\nhighly valuable and fruitful classification of particles, his\nanalysis does not contribute very much to the question what a particle\nis and whether a given theory can be interpreted in terms of\nparticles. What Wigner has given is rather a conditional\nanswer. If relativistic quantum mechanics can be interpreted\nin terms of particles then the possible types of particles\nand their invariant properties can be determined via an analysis of\nthe irreducible unitary representations of the Poincaré\ngroup. However, the question whether, and if yes in what sense, at\nleast relativistic quantum mechanics can be interpreted as a particle\ntheory at all is not addressed in Wigner’s analysis. For this reason\nthe discussion of the particle interpretation of QFT is not finished\nwith Wigner’s analysis as one might be tempted to say. For instance,\nthe pivotal question of the localizability of particle states, to be\ndiscussed below, is still open. Moreover, once interactions are\nincluded, Wigner’s classification is no longer applicable (see Bain\n2000). Kuhlmann (2010a: sec. 8.1.2) offers an accessible introduction\nto Wigner’s analysis and discusses its interpretive relevance. \nThe observed ‘particle traces’, e.g., on photographic\nplates of bubble chambers, seem to be a clear indication for the\nexistence of particles. However, the theory which has been built on\nthe basis of these scattering experiments, QFT, turns out to have\nconsiderable problems to account for the observed ‘particle\ntrajectories’. Not only are sharp trajectories excluded by\nHeisenberg’s uncertainty relations for position and momentum\ncoordinates, which hold for non-relativistic quantum mechanics\nalready. More advanced examinations in AQFT show that ‘quantum\nparticles’ which behave according to the principles of\nrelativity theory cannot be localized in any bounded region of\nspace-time, no matter how large, a result which excludes even\ntube-like trajectories. It thus appears to be impossible that our\nworld is composed of particles when we assume that localizability is a\nnecessary ingredient of the particle concept. So far there is no\nsingle unquestioned argument against the possibility of a particle\ninterpretation of QFT but the problems are piling up. Reeh &\nSchlieder, Hegerfeldt, Malament and Redhead all gained mathematical\nresults, or formalized their interpretation, which prove that certain\nsets of assumptions, which are taken to be essential for the particle\nconcept, lead to contradictions. \nThe Reeh-Schlieder theorem (1961) is a central result in\nAQFT. It asserts that acting on the vacuum state \\(\\Omega\\) with elements\nof the von Neumann observable algebra \\(R(O)\\) for open\nspace-time region \\(O\\), one can approximate as closely as one\nlikes any state in Hilbertspace\n\\(\\mathcal{H}\\), in particular one that is very\ndifferent from the vacuum in some space-like separated\nregion \\(O'\\). The Reeh-Schlieder theorem is thus\nexploiting long distance correlations of the vacuum. Or one can\nexpress the result by saying that local measurements do not allow for\na distinction between an N-particle state and the vacuum state.\nRedhead’s (1995a) take on the Reeh-Schlieder theorem is that local\nmeasurements can never decide whether one observes an N-particle\nstate, since a projection operator \\(P_{\\Psi}\\) which\ncorresponds to an N-particle state \\(\\Psi\\) can never be an element of a\nlocal algebra\n\\(R(O)\\). Clifton & Halvorson (2001) discuss what\nthis means for the issue of entanglement. Halvorson (2001) shows that\nan alternative “Newton-Wigner” localization scheme fails\nto evade the problem of localization posed by the Reeh-Schlieder\ntheorem.\n \nMalament (1996) formulates a no-go theorem to the effect\nthat a relativistic quantum theory of a fixed number of particles\npredicts a zero probability for finding a particle in any spatial set,\nprovided four conditions are satisfied, namely concerning translation\ncovariance, energy, localizability and locality.\nThe localizability condition is the essential ingredient of\nthe particle concept: A particle—in contrast to a\nfield—cannot be found in two disjoint spatial sets at the same\ntime. The locality condition is the main relativistic part\nof Malament’s assumptions. It requires that the statistics for\nmeasurements in one space-time region must not depend on whether or\nnot a measurement has been performed in a space-like related second\nspace-time region. Malament’s proof has the weight of a no-go theorem\nprovided that we accept his four conditions as natural assumptions for\na particle interpretation. A relativistic quantum theory of a fixed\nnumber of particles, satisfying in particular the localizability and\nthe locality condition, has to assume a world devoid of particles (or\nat least a world in which particles can never be detected) in order\nnot to contradict itself. Malament’s no-go theorem thus seems to show\nthat there is no middle ground between QM and QFT, i.e., no theory\nwhich deals with a fixed number of particles (like in QM) and which is\nrelativistic (like QFT) without running into the localizability\nproblem of the no-go theorem. One is forced towards QFT which, as\nMalament is convinced, can only be understood as a field\ntheory. Nevertheless, whether or not a particle interpretation of QFT\nis in fact ruled out by Malament’s result is a point of debate. At\nleast prima facie Malament’s no-go theorem alone cannot supply a final\nanswer since it assumes a fixed number of particles, an assumption\nthat is not valid in the case of QFT. \n\nThe results about non-localizability which have been explored above\nmay appear to be not very astonishing in the light of the following\nfacts about ordinary QM: Quantum mechanical wave functions (in\nposition representation) are usually smeared out over all\n \\(\\Re^3\\),\n so that everywhere in space there is a non-vanishing probability for\nfinding a particle. This is even the case arbitrarily close after a\nsharp position measurement due to the instantaneous spreading of wave\npackets over all space. Note, however, that ordinary QM is\nnon-relativistic. A conflict with SRT would thus not be very\nsurprising although it is not yet clear whether the above-mentioned\nquantum mechanical phenomena can actually be exploited to allow for\nsuperluminal signalling. QFT, on the other side, has been designed to\nbe in accordance with special relativity theory (SRT). The local\nbehavior of phenomena is one of the leading principles upon which the\ntheory was built. This makes non-localizability within the formalism\nof QFT a much severer problem for a particle interpretation. \n\nMalament’s reasoning has come under attack in Fleming &\nButterfield (1999) and Busch (1999). Both argue to the effect that\nthere are alternatives to Malament’s conclusion. The main line\nof thought in both criticisms is that Malament’s ‘mathematical\nresult’ might just as well be interpreted as evidence that the\nassumed concept of a sharp localization operator is flawed and has to\nbe modified either by allowing for unsharp localization (Busch 1999)\nor for so-called “hyperplane dependent localization”\n(Fleming & Butterfield 1999). In Saunders (1995) a different\nconclusion from Malament’s (as well as from similar) results is\ndrawn. Rather than granting Malament’s four conditions and deriving a\nproblem for a particle interpretation Saunders takes Malament’s proof\nas further evidence that one can not hold on to all four\nconditions. According to Saunders it is the localizability condition\nwhich might not be a natural and necessary requirement on second\nthought. Stressing that “relativity requires the language of\nevents, not of things” Saunders argues that the localizability\ncondition loses its plausibility when it is applied to events: It\nmakes no sense to postulate that the same event can not occur at two\ndisjoint spatial sets at the same time. One can only require for the\nsame kind of event not to occur at both places. For Saunders\nthe particle interpretation as such is not at stake in Malament’s\nargument. The question is rather whether QFT speaks about things at\nall. Saunders considers Malament’s result to give a negative answer to\nthis question. A kind of meta paper on Malament’s theorem is\nHalvorson & Clifton (2002). Various objections to the choice of\nMalament’s assumptions and his conclusion are considered and\nrebutted. Moreover, Halvorson and Clifton establish two further no-go\ntheorems which preserve Malament’s theorem by weakening tacit\nassumptions and showing that the general conclusion still holds. One\nthing seems to be clear. Since Malament’s ‘mathematical\nresult’ appears to allow for various different conclusions it\ncannot be taken as conclusive evidence against the tenability of a\nparticle interpretation of QFT and the same applies to Redhead’s\ninterpretation of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem. For a more detailed\nexposition and comparison of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem and Malament’s\ntheorem see Kuhlmann (2010a: sec. 8.3). \nDoes the field interpretation also suffer from problems\nconcerning non-localizability? In the section “Deficiencies of\nthe Conventional Formulation of QFT” we already saw that,\nstrictly speaking, field operators cannot be defined at points but\nneed to be smeared out in the (finite and arbitrarily small) vicinity\nof points, giving rise to smeared field\noperators \\(\\hat{\\phi}(f)\\),\nwhich represent the weighted average field value in the respective\nregion. This procedure leads to operator-valued distributions instead\nof operator-valued fields. The lack of field operators at points\nappears to be analogous to the lack of position operators in QFT,\nwhich troubles the particle interpretation. However, for position\noperators there is no remedy analogous to that for field operators:\nwhile even unsharply localized particle positions do not exist in QFT\n(see Halvorson and Clifton 2002, theorem 2), the existence of smeared\nfield operators demonstrates that there are at least point-like field\noperators. On this basis Lupher (2010) proposes a “modified\nfield ontology”. \n\nSymmetries play a central role in QFT. In order to characterize a\nspecial symmetry one has to specify transformations T and features\nthat remain unchanged during these transformations: invariants I.\nSymmetries are thus pairs \\(\\{\\)T, I\\(\\}\\). The basic idea is that the\ntransformations change elements of the mathematical description (the\nLagrangians for instance) whereas the empirical content of the theory\nis unchanged. There are space-time transformations and so-called\ninternal transformations. Whereas space-time symmetries are universal,\ni. e., they are valid for all interactions, internal symmetries\ncharacterize special sorts of interaction (electromagnetic, weak or\nstrong interaction). Symmetry transformations define properties of\nparticles/quantum fields that are conserved if the symmetry is not\nbroken. The invariance of a system defines a conservation law, e.g.,\nif a system is invariant under translations the linear momentum is\nconserved, if it is invariant under rotation the angular momentum is\nconserved. Inner transformations, such as gauge transformations, are\nconnected with more abstract properties. \n\nSymmetries are not only defined for Lagrangians but they can also be\nfound in empirical data and phenomenological descriptions. Symmetries\ncan thus bridge the gap between descriptions which are close to\nempirical results (‘phenomenology’) and the more abstract\ngeneral theory which is a most important reason for their heuristic\nforce. If a conservation law is found one has some knowledge about the\nsystem even if details of the dynamics are unknown. The analysis of\nmany high energy collision experiments led to the assumption of\nspecial conservation laws for abstract properties like baryon number\nor strangeness. Evaluating experiments in this way allowed for a\nclassification of particles. This phenomenological classification was\ngood enough to predict new particles which could be found in the\nexperiments. Free places in the classification could be filled even if\nthe dynamics of the theory (for example the Lagrangian of strong\ninteraction) was yet unknown. As the history of QFT for strong\ninteraction shows, symmetries found in the phenomenological\ndescription often lead to valuable constraints for the construction of the\ndynamical equations. Arguments from group theory played a decisive role\nin the unification of fundamental interactions. In addition,\nsymmetries bring about substantial technical advantages. For example,\nby using gauge transformations one can bring the Lagrangian into a\nform which makes it easy to prove the renormalizability of the theory.\nSee also the entry on\n symmetry and symmetry breaking. \nIn many cases symmetries are not only heuristically useful but supply\nsome sort of ‘justification’ by being used in the\nbeginning of a chain of explanation. To a remarkable degree the\npresent theories of elementary particle interactions can be understood\nby deduction from general principles. Under these principles symmetry\nrequirements play a crucial role in order to determine the\nLagrangian. For example, the only Lorentz invariant and gauge\ninvariant renormalizable Lagrangian for photons and electrons is\nprecisely the original Dirac Lagrangian. In this way symmetry\narguments acquire an explanatory power and help to minimize the\nunexplained basic assumptions of a theory. Heisenberg concludes that\nin order “to find the way to a real understanding of the\nspectrum of particles it will therefore be necessary to look for the\nfundamental symmetries and not for the fundamental particles.”\n(Blum et al. 1995: 507). \nSince symmetry operations change the perspective of an observer but\nnot the physics an analysis of the relevant symmetry group can yield\nvery general information about those entities which are unchanged by\ntransformations. Such an invariance under a symmetry group is a\nnecessary (but not sufficient) requirement for something to belong to\nthe ontology of the considered physical theory. Hermann Weyl\npropagated the idea that objectivity is associated with invariance\n(see, e.g., his authoritative work Weyl 1952: 132). Auyang (1995)\nstresses the connection between properties of physically relevant\nsymmetry groups and ontological questions. Kosso argues that\nsymmetries help to separate objective facts from the conventions of\ndescriptions; see his article in Brading & Castellani (2003), an\nanthology containing numerous further philosophical studies about\nsymmetries in physics. \nSymmetries are typical examples of structures that show more\ncontinuity in scientific change than assumptions about objects. For\nthat reason structural realists consider structures as “the best\ncandidate for what is ‘true’ about a physical\ntheory” (Redhead 1999: 34). Physical objects such as electrons\nare then taken to be similar to fiction that should not be taken\nseriously, in the end. In the epistemic variant of structural realism\nstructure is all we know about nature whereas the objects which are\nrelated by structures might exist but they are not accessible to\nus. For the extreme ontic structural realist there is nothing but\nstructures in the world (Ladyman 1998). \nA particle interpretation of QFT answers most intuitively what\nhappens in particle scattering experiments and why we seem to detect\nparticle trajectories. Moreover, it would explain most naturally why\nparticle talk appears almost unavoidable. However, the particle\ninterpretation in particular is troubled by numerous serious\nproblems. There are no-go theorems to the effect that, in a\nrelativistic setting, quantum “particle” states cannot be\nlocalized in any finite region of space-time no matter how large it\nis. Besides localizability, another hard core requirement for the\nparticle concept that seems to be violated in QFT is\ncountability. First, many take the Unruh effect to indicate that the\nparticle number is observer or context dependent. And second,\ninteracting quantum field theories cannot be interpreted in terms of\nparticles because their representations are unitarily inequivalent to\nFock space (Haag’s theorem), which is the only known way to represent\ncountable entities in systems with an infinite number of degrees of\nfreedom.\n \nAt first sight the field interpretation seems to be much better\noff, considering that a field is not a localized entity and that it\nmay vary continuously—so no requirements for localizability and\ncountability. Accordingly, the field interpretation is often taken to\nbe implied by the failure of the particle interpretation. However, on\ncloser scrutiny the field interpretation itself is not above reproach.\nTo begin with, since “quantum fields” are operator valued\nit is not clear in which sense QFT should be describing physical\nfields, i.e. as ascribing physical properties to points in space. In\norder to get determinate physical properties, or even just\nprobabilities, one needs a quantum state. However, since quantum\nstates as such are not spatio-temporally defined, it is questionable\nwhether field values calculated with their help can still be viewed as\nlocal properties. The second serious challenge is that the arguably\nstrongest field interpretation—the wave functional\nversion—may be hit by similar problems as the particle\ninterpretation, since wave functional space is unitarily equivalent to\nFock space.\n \nThe occurrence of unitarily inequivalent representations\n(UIRs), which first seemed to cause problems specifically for the\nparticle interpretation but which appears to carry over to the field\ninterpretation, may well be a severe obstacle for any ontological\ninterpretation of QFT. However, it is controversial whether the two\nmost prominent examples, namely the Unruh effect and Haag’s theorem,\nreally do cause the contended problems in the first place. Thus one of\nthe crucial tasks for the philosophy of QFT is further unmasking the\nontological significance of UIRs.\n \nThe two remaining contestants approach QFT in a way that breaks more\nradically with traditional ontologies than any of the proposed\nparticle and field interpretations. Ontic Structural Realism\n(OSR) takes the paramount significance of symmetry groups to\nindicate that symmetry structures as such have an ontological primacy\nover objects. However, since most OSRists are decidedly against\nPlatonism, it is not altogether clear how symmetry structures could be\nontologically prior to objects if they only exist in concrete\nrealizations, namely in those objects that exhibit these\nsymmetries. Dispositional Trope Ontology (DTO) deprives both particles\nand fields of their fundamental status, and proposes an ontology whose\nbasic elements are properties understood as particulars, called\n‘tropes’. One of the advantages of the DTO approach is its\ngreat generality concerning the nature of objects which it analyzes as\nbundles of (partly dispositional) properties/tropes: DTO is flexible\nenough to encompass both particle and field like features without\nbeing committed to either a particle or a field ontology.\n \nIn conclusion one has to recall that one reason why the ontological\ninterpretation of QFT is so difficult is the fact that it is\nexceptionally unclear which parts of the formalism should be taken to\nrepresent anything physical in the first place. And it looks as if\nthat problem will persist for quite some time.\n","contact.mail":"mkuhlmann@uni-mainz.de","contact.domain":"uni-mainz.de"}]
