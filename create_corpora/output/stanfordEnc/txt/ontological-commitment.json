The ontologist asks: What entities or kinds of entity\nexist? Are there abstract entities, such as sets or numbers, in\naddition to concrete entities, such as people and puddles and protons?\nAre there properties or universals in addition to (or instead of) the\nparticular entities that, as we say, instantiate them? Questions such\nas these have divided philosophers down the ages, and divide them no\nless to this day.\n\nMeta-ontology concerns itself with the nature and\nmethodology of ontology, with the interpretation and significance of\nontological questions such as those exhibited above. The problem\nof ontological commitment is a problem in meta-ontology rather\nthan ontology\n proper.[1] \nThe meta-ontologist asks (among other\nthings): What entities or kinds of entity exist according to a\ngiven theory or discourse, and thus are among\nits ontological commitments? Having a criterion of\nontological commitment for theories is needed, arguably, if one is to\nsystematically and rigorously attack the problem of ontology:\ntypically, we accept entities into our ontology via accepting\ntheories that are ontologically committed to those entities. A\ncriterion of ontological commitment, then, is a pre-requisite for\nontological inquiry.\n\nOn its face, the notion of ontological commitment for theories is a\nsimple matter. Theories have truth conditions. These truth conditions\ntell us how the world must be in order for the theory to be true; they\nmake demands on the world. Sometimes, perhaps always, they demand of\nthe world that certain entities or kinds of entity exist. The\nontological commitments of a theory, then, are just the entities or\nkinds of entity that must exist in order for the theory to be\ntrue. End of story (compare Rayo 2007: 428).\n\nBut complications arise as soon as one tries to specify a theory's\ntruth conditions: different accounts of truth conditions lead to\ndifferent accounts of ontological commitment.  Moreover, theories\ncouched in ordinary language do not wear their truth\nconditions—or their ontological commitments—on their\nsleeves. Thus, the need arises to find a criterion of\nontological commitment: a test or method that can be applied to\ntheories in a neutral way to determine the theory's ontological\ncommitments. For example, perhaps the theory should first be\ntranslated into a canonical formal language, such as the language of\nfirst-order predicate logic, where truth conditions, and thus\nontological commitments, are easier to specify. But whenever these\ntranslations are controversial, so will be the verdicts as to\nontological commitment. And, even when translated into a formal\nlanguage, such as the language of first-order predicate logic,\ndifferent ontological standpoints may disagree as to the existential\npresuppositions of the theory. The notion of ontological commitment,\nintroduced to help resolve disputes in ontology, becomes hostage to\nthose very disputes. Strife over the ontological commitments of\ntheories begins to appear inevitable.\n\nThe following article canvasses and evaluates the most prominent\napproaches to ontological commitment. It starts with Quinean\napproaches that focus on the existential quantifier and the values of\nthe variables. It then contrasts Quinean approaches with more general\nentailment approaches that drop the preoccupation with the\nquantifier. It then considers a strengthening of the entailment\napproach that requires that ontological commitments of a theory\nbe truthmakers for that theory. It then steps back to examine\nhow, and to what extent, the notion of ontological commitment can be\napplied to ordinary language. The article concludes by considering\nless orthodox views associated with Frege and with Carnap.\n\nQuine's criterion of ontological commitment has dominated\nontological discussion in analytic philosophy since the middle of the\n20th century; it deserves to be called the orthodox\nview. For Quine, such a criterion played two distinct roles. First,\nit allowed one to measure the ontological cost of theories, an\nimportant component in deciding which theories to accept; it thus\nprovided a partial foundation for theory choice.  Moreover, once one\nhad settled on a total theory, it allowed one to determine which\ncomponents of the theory were responsible for its ontological costs\n(see Quine (1960: 270) for the purported benefits of such ontological\nbookkeeping). Second, it played a polemical role. It could be used to\nargue that opponents' theories were more costly than the theorists\nadmitted (see Church (1958), who wields the criterion polemically\nagainst Ayer, Pap, and Ryle). And it could be used to advance a\ntraditional nominalist agenda because, as Quine saw it, ordinary\nsubject-predicate sentences carry no ontological commitment to\nproperties or universals. The locus classicus for Quine's criterion is “On\nWhat There Is”. Quine writes:  A theory is committed to those and only those entities to which the\nbound variables of the theory must be capable of referring in order\nthat the affirmations made in the theory be true.\n[2] \n(Quine 1948: 33) To illustrate: if a theory contains a quantified sentence\n‘∃x Electron(x)’, then the bound\nvariable ‘x’ must range over electrons in order\nfor the theory to be true; and so the theory is ontologically\ncommitted to electrons. (For an introduction to the logic of\nquantifiers and bound variables, the basics of which are presupposed\nin this article, see Shapiro (2013).) Talk of “commitment” has an unfortunate connotation: it\napplies more naturally to persons than to theories. But Quine's\ncriterion should be understood as applying to theories primarily, and\nto persons derivatively by way of the theories they accept (Quine\n1953: 103). It would be more perspicuous to speak simply of\nthe existential implications, or ontological\npresuppositions, of a theory. But ‘ontological\ncommitment’ is well entrenched, and it would be pointless to try\nto avoid it. It is important to note at the start that Quine's criterion\nis descriptive; it should not be confused with\nthe prescriptive account of ontological commitment that is\npart of his general method of ontology. That method, roughly, is this:\nfirst, regiment the competing theories in first-order predicate logic;\nsecond, determine which of these theories is epistemically best (where\nwhat counts as “epistemically best” depends in part on\npragmatic features such as simplicity and fruitfulness); third, choose\nthe epistemically best theory.  We can then say: one\nis ontologically committed to those entities that are needed\nas values of the bound variables for this chosen epistemically best\ntheory to be true. Put like this, the account may seem circular:\nontological commitment depends on what theories are best, which\ndepends in part on the simplicity, and so the ontological commitments,\nof those theories. But there is no circularity in Quine's ontological\nmethod. The above account of ontological commitment is prescriptive,\nand applies to persons, not to theories. What entities we ought to\ncommit ourselves to depends on a prior descriptive account of\nwhat entities theories are committed to. The prescriptive\naccount of ontological commitment serves as a crucial premise in the\nQuine-Putnam indispensability argument for the existence of abstract\nentities (the locus classicus is Putnam 1971). This article,\nhowever, will focus entirely on descriptive criteria of ontological\ncommitment. It is also important to distinguish at the outset\nthe ontological commitments of a theory from\nits ideological commitments (following Quine\n1951a). The ontological\ncommitments of a theory are, roughly, what the theory says exists; a\ntheory is ontologically committed to electrons, for example, if the\ntruth of the theory requires that there be electrons. The ideological\ncommitments of a theory are, roughly, those concepts, logical or\nnon-logical, that are expressible within the theory.  Ontological\ncommitment and ideological commitment are largely independent of one\nanother. For example, a theory may be ontologically committed to there\nbeing Ks, even if the concept of being a K is not\nexpressible in the theory.  In the other direction, a theory may be\nideologically committed to relational concepts that\nadd structure to the entities posited by the theory without\nadding new kinds of entity to the ontology.  There has been a trend in\nrecent metaphysics to take ideological commitment to be as\nimportant—if not more important—than ontological\ncommitment with respect to providing a criterion of theory choice, at\nleast for fundamental theories (see especially Sider 2011:\n12–15). In this article, however, only ontological commitment\nwill be discussed. Ontological commitment, on its face, is a relation between theories\nand entities, or kinds of entity. Before attempting to explicate and\nevaluate Quine's criterion of ontological commitment, it is important\nto specify more carefully the relata. A theory, for\nQuine, is just a set of sentences (or a single sentence) of some\nlanguage. But what language? Strictly speaking, Quine's criterion is\nonly to be applied to theories couched within the following\nespecially austere form of first-order predicate logic: there are\nfirst-order existential and universal quantifiers but no other\nvariable-binding operators; there are predicates, including identity,\nbut no function symbols or individual constants. Thus, all names and\ndefinite descriptions have been eliminated from the language;\nreference rests entirely with the variables. The elimination of\nsingular terms serves both to simplify the criterion and to avoid\nage-old confusions. Unlike bound variables, singular terms sometimes\ndo and sometimes do not carry ontological commitment: ‘Socrates\nis wise’ presumably does; but ‘Pegasus does not\nexist’ presumably does not. Whenever singular terms do carry\nontological commitment, it will be reflected in the assignment to the\nvariables of the regimented theory. Thus, whenever a sentence\ncontaining a definite description is ontologically committed to some\nentity satisfying the description, so will be the regimented sentence\nthat results from applying Russell's theory of descriptions (which\nwas endorsed by Quine). Whenever a sentence containing a name is\nontologically committed to some entity denoted by the name, so will\nbe a regimented sentence that contains a predicate applying\nexclusively to that entity. For example, if instead of using the name\n‘Socrates’ we use a predicate ‘Is-Socrates’\ninterpreted to mean is-identical-with-Socrates (sometimes\nabbreviated ‘Socratizes’), the ontological commitment\nincurred by the name is transferred without loss to the bound\nvariable in ‘∃x\nIs‑Socrates(x)’ (or ‘∃x\nSocratizes(x)’).[3] Unless noted otherwise, ‘theory’ will always mean\n‘interpreted theory’; uninterpreted theories say nothing\nand have no ontological commitments. When the theory is couched within\nfirst-order logic, the interpretation is given by standard Tarskian\nsemantics. In particular, each monadic predicate of the language of\nthe theory has been assigned a class as its interpretation;\neach n-ary predicate has been assigned a class\nof n-tuples; the quantifiers are interpreted objectually by\nway of assignments to the variables. On the other hand, it is not\nsupposed that the domain of the quantifiers has been fixed once and\nfor all. Sometimes, in applying the criteria, alternative domains are\nconsidered, and the theory is evaluated for truth under the various\nalternatives. The restriction to theories couched within first-order predicate\nlogic is severe. Philosophers have been no less interested in the\nontological commitments of theories couched within other logical\nframeworks, such as higher-order or intensional logics\n(see §1.7.2\nand §1.7.3). Worse, if the criterion is to\nhave application to the actual ontological debates among philosophers,\nit will have to apply to theories couched within ordinary language as\nwell. This led Quine—at least sometimes—to endorse\nan extended criterion of ontological commitment: a theory is\nontologically committed to an entity or kind of entity if and only if\nevery acceptable paraphrase of the theory into (austere) first-order\npredicate logic is ontologically committed to that entity or kind of\nentity. This provides philosophers with a method for avoiding\nontological commitment: find an acceptable paraphrase of the theory\ninto first-order predicate logic that is not ontologically\ncommitted to the questionable entities (Quine 1948: 32, 1953:\n103–104). (What counts as an “acceptable\nparaphrase”, and whether any sort of “paraphrase”\nshould be required, is discussed\nin §4.2.) What about the second relatum? What is it that theories\nare committed to? Sometimes we say that a theory is committed to a\nparticular entity. For example, we say that the sentence\n‘Socrates exists’ (or, in our austere language,\n‘∃x Socratizes(x)’) is committed\nto Socrates. But more often we speak of ontological commitment to some\nentities in the plural, or to some kind of entity.  For\nexample, we speak of theories being committed to universals, or\nnumbers, or electrons. But ontological commitment to some entities\nplurally, or some kind of entity, is clearly not the same as\nontological commitment to each of the entities singly. Consider a\ntheory that contains ‘∃x\nElephant(x)’. It is ontologically committed to\nelephants, or to the kind elephant, but not to any particular\nelephant: no particular elephant need be the value of the variable\n‘x’ in order for the sentence to be true. A\ntheory is committed to Ks, or a kind K, just in case\nthe values of the variables must include at least\none K in order for the theory to be true, in which case\nthe existence of Ks is in some sense entailed by the\ntheory. (More on different relevant senses of entailment\nin §1.5\nand §2 below.)  But there is a problem (Cartwright 1954; Scheffler and Chomsky\n1958; Jackson 1989; Michael 2008). Suppose first that ontological\ncommitment takes a plural argument in its second place, that a\ncommitment to Ks is a relation to the Ks\nthemselves. Then, on plausible assumptions, the meta-ontologist\ncannot assert that a theory is ontologically committed to Ks\nwithout being committed to Ks herself; for the\nmeta-ontologist's own domain of quantification must include at least\none K in order for ‘T is ontologically\ncommitted to Ks’ to be true. And that is wrong.\nSuppose instead, then, that ontological commitment is a relation, not\nto the Ks, but to the kind K. If a kind K\ncan exist without Ks existing, this may help. But, on\nplausible assumptions, it still has the untoward consequence that the\nmeta-ontologist cannot herself assert that a theory is ontologically\ncommitted to a kind K without being committed\nto kinds. And, whether kinds are construed as properties, or\nsets of possibilia, or taken to be sui generis,\nthat still seems wrong. This suggests that the logical form of\nstatements attributing ontological commitment is misleading, and that\nontological commitment is not a genuine relation at all; only then\nwill meta-ontological claims about ontological commitment themselves\nbe ontologically neutral, or as ontologically neutral as\npossible.[4] In\nthis article, the locutions ‘ontological commitment\nto Ks’ and ‘ontological commitment to the\nkind K’ will be used without presupposing that\nontological commitment is a relation to the Ks plurally, or\nto the kind K, or, indeed, that it is a relation at all. The\ndifferent accounts of ontological commitment will treat the matter\ndifferently. Finally, it will be useful in what follows to interpret\n‘K’ and ‘kind’ broadly. So, for\nexample, not-being-an-electron is a kind,\nand being-an-electron-or-a-chair is a kind, and so is being\none of some random collection of entities. We may not be interested in\nasking whether a theory is ontologically committed to negative, or\ndisjunctive, or gerrymandered kinds; but it is harmless to allow the\ncriterion to supply answers. Moreover, this allows us to assimilate\nontological commitment to single entities to ontological commitment to\nkinds of entity: to be ontologically committed to a single\nentity, a, is just to be ontologically committed to the\nkind, is-identical-with-a. We turn now to the task of providing a precise formulation of\nQuine's criterion. This task is none too easy: formulations that keep\nwithin the strictures of Quine's overall philosophy are woefully\ninadequate; the farther one is allowed to stray from Quinean\nstrictures, the better things look; but, by the time one gets to a\ndefensible criterion, one has left Quine far behind. I will consider\nin turn extensional, metalinguistic, and modal formulations. Quine's statement of his criterion (quoted above) appears to\nbe modal. It asks: what entities must be taken to\nbe values of the bound variables in order for the sentences of the\ntheory to be true? But given Quine's general hostility to modality\n(e.g., in Quine 1953: 139–159), it is all but certain that he\nthought the ‘must’ was eliminable. Moreover, Quine\nexplicitly claimed that his account of ontological commitment was\nwithin the theory of reference, not the theory of meaning (Quine\n1953: 130–131). This suggests that Quine had in mind a purely\nextensional criterion, and an extensional individuation of kinds.\nIndeed, Quine provides an extensional criterion for a special case:\nthe ontological commitments of an existential\nsentence.[5] He\nwrites: To say that a given existential quantification presupposes objects\nof a given kind is to say simply that the open sentence which follows\nthe quantifier is true of some objects of that kind and none not of\nthat kind. (Quine 1953: 131) This criterion seems to give reasonable results for true\nexistential sentences. Thus, ‘∃x\nElephant(x)’ is committed to\n(“presupposes”) elephants because the open sentence\n‘Elephant(x)’ applies to all and only elephants,\nand there are some. It is likewise committed to any kind that contains\nall the elephants: to mammals, to animals, to living things. (It has\nthese commitments whether or not these kinds are expressible in the\nobject language.) And it is not committed to any kind that leaves out\nany elephants, such as male elephant. The\nkind elephant is the smallest kind to which\n‘∃x Elephant(x)’ is committed. So\nfar, so good. But when the criterion is applied to false existential\nsentences, trouble immediately arises. For example, since there are no\ncentaurs, the open sentence ‘Centaur(x)’ is not\ntrue of any objects of any kind, and so ‘∃x\nCentaur(x)’ is not ontologically committed to any kind\nof entity. The same goes for ‘∃x\nUnicorn(x)’, and all other false existential\nsentences. But, then, all false existential sentences have the same\nontological commitment, namely, none. And that's wrong on two counts:\n‘∃x Centaur(x)’ and\n‘∃x Unicorn(x)’ are\nontologically committing; and their ontological commitments are not\nthe same. Let us return, then, to Quine's favored formulation of the\ncriterion involving the ‘must’ and explore whether it is\ncompatible with an extensionalist account. Indeed, ordinary uses of\n‘must’ and other modals are often used to signal\ngenerality without making the content of what is asserted modal.\nConsider the following example: “A set of five numbers between 1\nand 9, inclusive, must contain at least one odd number”. The\ncontent is simply that every set of five numbers between 1 and 9,\ninclusive contains at least one odd number. (Perhaps the\n‘must’ is also epistemic, but not in a way that affects\nthe content of what is asserted.)  Similarly, Quine's criterion can be\ninterpreted as innocent quantification:  Quine's Criterion, Extensional Version. A\ntheory T is ontologically committed to Ks\niff every domain of quantification that makes the theory true contains\nat least one K.  (In considering whether a domain makes the theory true, the\ninterpretation of the predicates occurring in the theory is\nrestricted to the domain if need be.) This account is purely\nextensional: if a theory is committed to a kind K,\nand K′ has exactly the same members as K,\nthen the theory is also committed to kind K′. And that\nwill be its downfall. For, as above, ‘∃x\nCentaur(x)’ and ‘∃x\nUnicorn(x)’ will have the same ontological\ncommitments. The only difference is that, because the condition is\nuniversal rather than existential, the criterion will have both of\nthese sentences be (vacuously) committed to every kind of entity.  No\nimprovement there.[6] What to do? Of course, this result could be avoided by populating\ndomains of quantification with centaurs, unicorns, and all manner of\nfictional being. That would allow one to charge a profligate opponent\nwith an ontological commitment to centaurs, and a distinct ontological\ncommitment to unicorns—but only by taking on these very same\nontological commitments in the metalanguage. For Quine, at least, the\ncure is as bad as the disease. Alternatively, one could restrict the criterion to true\ntheories. That would still allow the criterion to be used to allocate\nontological costs, to say which theories are responsible for which\ncosts. Polemical uses of the criterion would have to be foresworn; but\nperhaps they are problematic in any case. The primary role for the\ncriterion, however, would have to be given up: its role in providing a\nfoundation for theory choice.  For if the criterion of ontological\ncommitment is to be applied only to true theories, then one would have\nto determine which theories are true prior to applying the\ncriterion. One might as well have as one's criterion of theory choice:\n“Choose true theories!” So, the idea of restricting\nontological commitment to true theories is a non-starter. Could one\ninstead restrict the criterion to the theories one takes to be\ntrue? That wouldn't so much solve the problem of false\nexistentials as merely hide it from view. But, in any case, one would\nbe no better off with respect to theory choice. One would have to\ndetermine which theories one takes to be true prior to applying the\ncriterion. And so, again, ontological commitment could not serve as a\nfoundation for theory choice. One might as well have as one's\ncriterion of theory choice: “Choose theories you take to be\ntrue!” Restricting the application of the criterion of\nontological commitment is not the solution to the problem of false\nexistentials. If Quine is to avoid the problem of false existentials without\nexiting the theory of reference, he will need to resort to semantic\nascent. Ontological commitment to a kind K must somehow\ninvolve the predicate ‘K’. That will allow\nontological commitment to centaurs and ontological commitment to\nunicorns to be distinguished, even though ‘centaur’ and\n‘unicorn’ are co-extensional. Indeed, Quine does suggest\n“withdrawing to a semantical plane” when the ontological\ncommitments of the theory one is addressing outrun the ontological\ncommitments of one's own theory. He writes, referring to the\nontologically profligate philosopher McX:  So long as I adhere to my ontology, as opposed to McX's, I cannot\nallow my bound variables to refer to entities which belong to McX's\nontology and not to mine. I can, however, consistently describe our\ndisagreement by characterizing the statements which McX\naffirms. Provided merely that my ontology countenances linguistic\nforms, or at least concrete inscriptions and utterances, I can talk\nabout McX's sentences. (Quine 1948: 35) One way of implementing this retreat to a semantical plane would be\nto interpret Quine's criterion as the following schema (with\n‘K’ now a schematic letter ranging over\npredicates of the object language): Quine's Criterion, Metalinguistic Version.  A\ntheory T is ontologically committed to Ks\niff T logically entails ‘∃x\nKx’ iff, for every interpretation that\nmakes T true, there is some entity in the domain of the\ninterpretation that is in the extension of\n‘K’.[7] Indeed, this captures some sense in which the truth\nof T requires that there be Ks among the values of\nthe variables. For example, any interpretation that makes\n‘∃x Unicorn(x)’ true will have\nsome entity in its domain also be in the extension of\n‘Unicorn’. This entity needn't be a unicorn, of\ncourse. But that's all to the good. It is the price one pays, the\nnon-believer in unicorns might say, if one wants to be able to say\nthat a theory is ontologically committed to unicorns.  But note that\nthe notion of ontological commitment is now entirely formal. Because\ninterpretations are generalized over, the actual interpretation of\n‘K’ plays no role. Ontological commitment is\nessentially intra-linguistic, rather than a relation between language\nand the world.  Suppose, for the moment, that one could live with the world being\nwell lost. There are still objections to the adequacy of the\nmetalinguistic\n criterion.[8] \nFirst, there is the problem that, in\nmaking entailment purely formal, all interconnections between kinds\nhave been lost: ontological commitment to bachelors won't carry with\nit ontological commitment to males; ontological commitment to\nelephants won't carry with it ontological commitment to\nanimals. There are no constraints on the joint interpretation of\n‘bachelor’ and ‘male’, or of\n‘elephant’ and ‘animal’. One can get these\nconnections back, however, by adding additional postulates\nto T, such as ‘∀x(Bachelor(x)\n⊃ Male(x))’, or\n‘∀x(Elephant(x) ⊃\nAnimal(x))’. (These might or might not be taken to be\nmeaning postulates, or metaphysically necessary postulates; for Quine\nthey would just be more theory.) This has the awkward result that the\noriginal theory T is not ontologically committed to males if\nit just contains ‘∃x\nBachelor(x)’, or to animals if it just contains\n‘∃x Elephant(x)’; only T\nwith the postulates added is so committed. But perhaps one can live\nwith that. A second, more serious problem is that ontological commitment is\nentrapped in the object language: if ‘K’ is not\na predicate of the object language, we have no way of assigning\nontological commitment to Ks. Say that the explicit\nontological commitments of a theory are given by the existential\nsentences that the theory logically\nentails.[9] The\nmetalinguistic criterion above takes all ontological commitment to be\nexplicit ontological commitment. But ontological commitment can fail\nto be explicit—or so it appears—in one of two ways. A\ntheory may have implicit ontological commitments by\nentailing existential sentences or propositions according to some\nentailment relation more generous than logical entailment\n(see §1.5\nand §2). Or a theory may\nhave implicit ontological commitments by entailing\nexistential propositions that are not expressible in the language of\nthe theory. For example, a theory containing ‘∃x\nElephant(x)’, one might hold, is ontologically\ncommitted to animals, whether or not the language of the theory\ncontains the predicate ‘Animal’. A defender of the\nmetalinguistic criterion, however, should simply deny that there are\nimplicit ontological \ncommitments.[10] \nAs with the previous objection, we can\nenhance the theory by adding new predicates and new postulates\ninvolving the new predicates. Indeed, we can suppose that the object\nlanguage is as rich as the metalanguage with respect to\nnon-semantical predicates. Again, it is awkward to have to say that\nonly the enhanced theory in the enhanced language, not the original\ntheory in the original language, carries ontological commitment to\nanimals. But, again, perhaps we can live with that. (For more on the\nproblem of implicit commitment, see 1.7\nand §2.1) The real problem lies elsewhere. Although there is a sense in which\naccording to the criterion a theory that is ontologically committed\nto Ks must have Ks among the values of its\nvariables, it appears to be the wrong sense. If the\ninterpretation of ‘K’ is not held fixed, then the\nelements of the domain that are in the extension of\n‘K’ have nothing to do with whether Ks\nexist, as ‘K’ is actually interpreted. It may\nseem a good thing that ontological commitment to unicorns has nothing\nto do with unicorns—since there aren't any. But now ontological\ncommitment to elephants also has nothing to do with elephants, and\nthat's wrong. The ontological commitments of a theory should depend on\nthe meanings of its terms, not just on its logical form. Could one\ninstead go for a hybrid criterion, metalinguistic for empty kinds,\nextensional for non-empty kinds?  (This is suggested by Quine's talk\nof “retreating to a semantical plane”.) That would only\ncompound the problem. For then we could not know which criterion to\napply to a theory prior to knowing what exists, and the criterion\ncould not play a foundational role in ontology.  It is high time to take the ‘must’ seriously when\nconsidering what entities must be taken to be values of the bound\nvariables in order for the theory to be true. The resulting criteria\nwould not be endorsed by Quine. But, as long as they tie ontological\ncommitment to the values of the bound variables of theories couched\nwithin first-order logic, they are still Quinean in spirit; they are\nstill versions of the quantifier account of ontological\ncommitment. We begin by interpreting the ‘must’ as metaphysical\nnecessity, and interpreting metaphysical necessity as quantification\nover all metaphysically possible worlds. According to the simplest\nmodal account, a theory is (perhaps implicitly) committed\nto Ks whenever the existence of Ks is necessarily\nimplied by the theory. This account isn't even Quinean in\nspirit—it makes no mention of the values of the\nvariables—but it serves as a useful foil to Quinean accounts,\nand will come in for later discussion\n(§2.2). It is assumed that each possible\nworld has an associated domain of entities: roughly, all the entities\nthat exist in the world. (These entities, however, need not all be in\nthe range of the first-order quantifiers.) Moreover, it is assumed\nthat when sentences of first-order predicate logic are evaluated\nrelative to a possible world, the sentences' quantifiers range only\nover entities in the domain of the world in question. This leads to\nwhat will be called a modal entailment criterion (other\nentailment criteria make use of entailment relations other than\nmetaphysical necessitation):  Modal Entailment Criterion.  A theory T\nis ontologically committed to Ks iff, for every\nworld w, T is true at w only if the domain\nof w contains at least one K. In other words, a theory is ontologically committed to Ks\njust when it necessarily implies that Ks\nexist.[11] Unlike extensional criteria, the modal entailment criterion has no\nproblem with (contingently) false existentials. The sentence\n‘∃x Unicorn(x)’ is ontologically\ncommitted to unicorns because, at every world at which it is true,\nthe domain of that world contains at least one unicorn. In saying\nthis, the meta-ontologist may or may not herself be ontologically\ncommitted to unicorns depending on how the meta-ontologist construes\ntalk of possible worlds and possible individuals. A modal\nrealist—someone who takes possibilia to be\nconcrete—will be so committed. But an ersatz modal\nrealist—someone who takes possibilia to be in\nsome sense abstract—will interpret “the domain of that\nworld contains at least one unicorn” in a way that does not\ncommit the meta-ontologist to unicorns; abstract worlds\ncan represent unicorns as existing whether or not unicorns\nexist.[12] The modal entailment criterion, however, appears to be inadequate\nwith respect to the vast majority of philosophical applications, at\nleast as metaphysical necessity is standardly interpreted\n(but see §2.2 for possible lines of\ndefense). This is because many philosophically controversial kinds of\nentity are taken to exist necessarily if they exist at all, for\nexample, numbers, or universals. But necessarily existing kinds of\nentity make trouble for the criterion: for any theory T, any\nworld at which T is true is a world whose domain contains\nnumbers. So any theory T is ontologically committed to\nnumbers, whether or not the content of T, intuitively, has\nanything to do with numbers. This suggests that we return to a Quinean\ncriterion that ties ontological commitment directly to the values of\nthe variables; numbers need not be values of the variables for a\ntheory T that has nothing to do with numbers. To make the\nvariable assignments relevant, we can quantify doubly over worlds and\nsub-domains of worlds. This leads to the modal quantifier\ncriterion: Modal Quantifier Criterion.  A theory T\nis ontologically committed to Ks iff, for every\nworld w and every sub-domain of the domain\nat w, T is true at w with its variables\nranging over that sub-domain only if that sub-domain contains at least\none K. (This criterion requires, in effect, that whenever a theory is true\nof some part of a world, considered in isolation, the theory\nis ontologically committed to Ks only if that part contains\nat least one K.)  The modal quantifier criterion takes care\nof the problem of irrelevant necessary existents. In effect, it\nintroduces a narrower modal entailment relation that is more\nsensitive to the content of T.  Only if T entails\nthe existence of Ks according to this narrower entailment\nrelation is T ontologically committed\nto Ks.[13] But some less pressing objections remain that suggest that\nmetaphysical necessity is too blunt an instrument to capture the\nnotion of ontological commitment. Three will be mentioned here.\nFirst, just as extensional criteria could not distinguish between\nontological commitments to co-extensional kinds, the modal criteria\ncannot distinguish between ontological commitments to co-intensional\nkinds. A theory that is committed to triangular polygons will also be\ncommitted to trilateral polygons, and vice versa, because,\nnecessarily, a polygon is triangular if and only if it is\ntrilateral. A theory that is committed to round squares will also be\ncommitted to even prime numbers greater than two, and vice\nversa, because, necessarily, (it is vacuously true that)\nsomething is a round square if and only if it is an even prime number\ngreater than two. Second, metaphysically impossible theories, theories\nthat are true at no world, will be (vacuously) committed to every kind\nof entity. But that seems wrong: naïve set theory is committed to\nsets, but not to angels that dance on the head of a pin. Third, the\nmodal criteria may introduce spurious commitment if there are\nmetaphysically necessary connections between distinct kinds of\nentity. For example, if whales are necessarily mammals, then a theory\ncommitted to whales would automatically be committed to mammals, even\nif the theory explicitly claims that there are no mammals and that\nwhales are fish. A theory committed to Hesperus would automatically be\ncommitted to Phosphorus, assuming the necessity of identity, even if\nthe theory explicitly claims that Hesperus exists and that Phosphorus\ndoesn't. All of these objections to modal criteria for ontological\ncommitment have a common source: ontological commitment appears to be\nsensitive to distinctions that metaphysical necessity cannot\naccommodate. One solution, then, would be to seek a more\ndiscriminating entailment relation. Thus, the third objection\nsuggests that a priori entailment should replace\nmetaphysically modal entailment. In the modal quantifier criterion,\none could quantify over domains and sub-domains of worlds that\nare conceptually, rather than metaphysically,\npossible.[14]\nThat won't help with the first two objections, however, since the\nexistence of triangular polygons is a priori entailed by the\nexistence of trilateral polygons, and, assuming classical logic\nis a priori, the existence of angels (and everything else)\nis a priori entailed by naïve set theory (or any\ninconsistent theory). For these, we can retreat further to some sort\nof relevant entailment relation within a paraconsistent logic. The\nquantifier criterion could be expressed by quantifying over domains\nand sub-domains of worlds that are both conceptually and\nmetaphysically\n impossible.[15]\n Alternatively, one could revert to an\nentailment account, since relevant entailment by itself can handle\nthe problem of irrelevant necessary existents. It is not the case\nthat any theory relevantly entails that numbers exist.  Perhaps the retreat to a sufficiently weak entailment relation will\nresult in a workable criterion. Another response, however, holds the\nline at modal\n entailment.[16] \nIt claims that all the above objections\nare based on a confusion between the ontological commitments of a\ntheory and the ontological beliefs of someone who holds the theory.\nAlthough there needs to be some hyper-intensional notion of belief\naccording to which someone could believe that trilateral polygons\nexist without believing that triangular polygons exist, or believe\nthat naïve set theory is true without believing that angels exist, or\nbelieve that whales are fish, we should not identify the ontological\ncommitments of a theory with the ontological beliefs of those that\naccept the theory. On this account, even an ideally rational person\nmight accept a theory without being able to determine its ontological\ncommitments. More worrisome, if the ontological commitments of\ntheories do not parallel the ontological beliefs of a person who\naccepts the theory, then the foundational role of ontological\ncommitment in theory choice will be diminished. (For an extended\ndiscussion of entailment accounts,\nsee §2.) This section and the next provide an evaluation of quantifier\naccounts of ontological commitment. It is still assumed, following\nQuine, that the target theory is couched within first-order predicate\nlogic. (For discussion of ontological commitment in ordinary language,\nsee §4.) The critique is divided into\ntwo parts: in this section, it is asked whether the quantifier\ncriterion is sufficient for ontological commitment; in the\nnext section, it is asked whether it is necessary.\nObjections that were considered above in presenting specific versions\nof the quantifier criterion will not be repeated. A criterion fails to be sufficient for ontological\ncommitment if it overgenerates, if it sometimes holds that a\ntheory is committed to some kind of entity that the theory should not\nbe committed to. I suppose that any quantifier criterion introduces\nsome sort of entailment relation between theories and existence\nclaims, an entailment relation that depends upon the values of the\nbound variables of the sentences of the theory.  (That's what\ndistinguishes “quantifier accounts” from the broader\n“entailment accounts” to be discussed\nin §2.) Now ask: How could a theory\nentail that Ks exist without being ontologically committed\nto Ks? How could the sufficiency of the quantifier criterion\nfail to be entirely trivial? Is there room to deny that existential\nconsequences of a theory, as given by sentences of first-order logic\nwith the existential quantifier, do not amount to ontological\ncommitments of the theory? Four ways that one might challenge\nsufficiency will be considered. The first two require only\nclarifications or minor adjustments to a quantifier criterion. The\nthird and fourth, however, raise philosophically substantial\nissues.  The first objection to sufficiency is not so much a critique of\nthe criterion, but of the logic to which it is applied. For Quine\nfirst-order predicate logic excludes the empty domain: its valid\nformulas are those that come out true under all interpretations of the\nnon-logical symbols over all non-empty domains. It follows\nfrom this that, on the quantifier account, universal sentences carry\nthe exact same ontological commitments as their existential\ncounterparts. It follows because, in classical first-order predicate\nlogic, universal sentences have existential import:\n‘∀x φ(x)’ logically entails\n‘∃x φ(x)’. If we want to allow\n‘∀x φ(x)’ to be true even\nwhen there are no φs (because there is nothing at all), then\nwe do not want it to carry any ontological commitment. Ontological\ncommitments should reside entirely with the existential\nquantifier. Implementing this is easy. We simply do logic so as to\ninclude interpretations with an empty\ndomain—so-called, inclusive logic.  According to the\ntruth conditions for quantifiers in inclusive logic, all universal\nsentences are true in an empty domain, and all existential sentences\nare false. Once we have made the shift to inclusive logic, we can also\nsay, what seems right, that conditional existential\nsentences—such as, ‘∃x φ(x)\n⊃ ∃x y(x)’—carry no\nontological commitment. Consider now Quine's insight, on which the quantifier account is\nbased, that it is bound variables rather than singular terms that\ncarry ontological commitment. To implement this insight, Quine simply\neliminated singular terms from the language. But suppose one wanted\nto be able to apply the quantifier criterion to theories containing\nsingular terms. One could instead switch from standard first-order\npredicate logic to free logic. In free logics, because one\ncannot in general derive the existential generalization\n‘∃x φ(x)’ from\n‘φ(t)’, for singular term\n‘t’, singular terms fail to carry ontological\ncommitment. Arguably, then, an inclusive, free logic provides the\nideal logical environment for applying the quantifier\naccount.[17]  A second objection to the sufficiency of the quantifier account\nrelates to the interpretation of the quantifiers of first-order\nlogic. If the quantifiers are interpreted substitutionally,\ninstead of objectually, the criterion may\novergenerate. According to the objectual interpretation (due to\nTarski), an existentially quantified sentence ‘∃x\nφ(x)’ is true if and only if the open formula\n‘φ(x)’ is satisfied by some object in the\ndomain. According to the substitutional interpretation,\n‘∃x φ(x)’ is true if and only\nif ‘φ(t)’ is true, for some singular term\n‘t’ of the language. When the quantifiers are\ngiven a substitutional interpretation, Quine's criterion will\novergenerate if the language has empty singular terms. For example, a\ntheory that contains (a symbolic translation of) the sentence\n‘Sherlock Holmes is a fictional detective’ would be\nontologically committed to fictional objects, and that seems\nwrong. This objection might have force against the application of a\nquantifier criterion to ordinary language if it could be argued that\nthe quantifiers of ordinary language are sometimes (or always)\nsubstitutional.[18] \nBut it is not in any way an objection to\na quantifier criterion as Quine conceived of\nit. Quine stipulated that the quantifiers of the\nfirst-order language were to be interpreted objectually—indeed,\nthe substitutional interpretation cannot be applied to Quine's\naustere language with no singular terms—and he explicitly\nacknowledged that, if interpreted substitutionally, all questions of\nontological commitment are moot (Quine 1968: 106, 1974: 139). Thus,\nthis could only be a critique of a quantifier account of ontological\ncommitment if it could be argued that the objectual interpretation\nwere somehow incoherent, or somehow had to be reduced, ultimately, to\nthe substitutional interpretation. That would undermine the\nquantifier criterion, to be sure; it would reverse the Quinean order\nof things, requiring that names, not bound variables, be the primary\nlocus of reference.  But justifying such a position would be a tall\norder.  According to the third objection to sufficiency, the quantifiers\nof first-order logic, properly understood, do not carry existential\ncommitment; they are not “existentially loaded”. Indeed,\ncalling ‘∃x’ the “existential\nquantifier” is a misnomer; it would be better to call it the\n“particular quantifier” in contrast with the\n“universal quantifier”. Ordinary language, on its face,\nsupports the view that quantification need not be existentially loaded\n(see §4). For example, if we assert\n“some fictional detective is smarter than Sherlock\nHolmes”, we do not ordinarily take ourselves to be committed to\nthe existence of fictional entities. Similarly, the objection claims,\nthe straightforward translation of this into first-order logic using\n‘∃x’ for ‘some’ should carry no\nexistential import. One only gets existential import when one\nrestricts the quantifier, explicitly or implicitly, with an existence\npredicate. Thus, the correct translation into first-order logic of\n“dragons exist” is not ‘∃x\nDragon(x)’, but ‘∃x\n(Exists(x) and Dragon(x))’. The quantifier\n‘∃x’, by itself, is neutral with respect to\nexistence. (Pronounce ‘∃x’ “for\nsome x”, not “there exists\nan x”.) Distinguishing a restricted quantifier that has existential import\nfrom an unrestricted quantifier that does not only has a point if\nexistence is a substantial property that some things have and other\nthings lack. Barack Obama has it; Sherlock Holmes does not.  The\nplanet Venus has it; the postulated planet Vulcan does not.  This\nobjection to Quine's criterion, then, is based on the Meinongian view\nthat some things do not\n exist.[19] \nThese things that do not exist typically\nare taken to include fictional entities, postulated entities of\nscience, and all manner of intentional objects; sometimes\n(mere) possibilia, impossibilia, and various\nabstract entities are also included among the\nnon-existent. Non-existent entities can be quantified over, referred\nto, and truly attributed properties. Existence is not a prerequisite\nfor being talked about. Quine and his followers claim not to understand this substantial\nproperty of existence, a property that is conceptually independent of\nthe quantifiers (Quine 1948; van Inwagen 1998). For Quine, the\nexistence predicate, ‘Exists(x)’, should be\ndefined simply as ‘∃y y\n= x’. Thus, for Quine, to say that some thing doesn't\nexist is to say that some thing is such that no thing is identical\nwith it—a logical contradiction. But, Quine claimed, whether or\nnot to accept the Meinongian account of existence is a sideshow when\nit comes to the question of ontological commitment. In responding to\nthe fictional Meinongian Wyman, Quine offers “to give Wyman the\nword ‘exist’.  I'll try not to use it again; I still have\n‘is’” (Quine 1948: 23). That is to say, theories are\nontologically committed to Ks if they entail that there\nare Ks, whether or not they entail that Ks\nexist. Indeed, Quine could also have given the (radical)\nMeinongian the word ‘is’ and any other predicate that\npurports to impose an ontological restriction on the quantifier; for\nwhat is central to Quine's criterion is that one\ncannot quantify over entities without incurring ontological\ncommitment to those entities. To use quantifiers to refer to entities\nwhile denying that one is ontologically committed is to fail to own up\nto one's commitments, and thereby engage in a sort of intellectual\ndoublethink. Quantification is the basic mode of reference to objects,\nand reference to objects is always ontologically committing. A Meinongian need not quarrel with any of this; she could\naccept that the unrestricted quantifier is ontologically committing,\neven though it carries no existential import. In that case, the\nMeinongian view would not be a challenge to the sufficiency of Quine's\ncriterion. But some Meinongians (e.g., Routley 1982) explicitly deny\nthat they are ontologically committed to what they quantify over when\ntheir quantifiers are not existentially loaded; they explicitly reject\nthe orthodox Quinean doctrine of ontological commitment. In trying to\nunderstand this claim, the Quinean faces a problem of\ninterpretation. Since the Quinean rejects the distinction between\nexistentially loaded and existentially unloaded quantifiers, he has to\ndecide which of these to translate as his one and only\nquantifier. Routley assumes that his loaded quantifier should be\nidentified with Quine's one and only quantifier, because that\nquantifier is likewise loaded for Quine. If we take him at his word,\nthen we say that, when using his unloaded quantifier, he quantifies\nwithout incurring ontological commitment; but that is to make his\nstatements incoherent by Quinean lights, since for the Quinean it is\nconstitutive of the quantifier that it is bound up with ontology. (As\nLewis (1990: 27) says, he “quantifies without\nquantifying”.) It is better, then, to translate his\nexistentially unloaded quantifiers as unrestricted quantifiers, and\nhis existentially loaded quantifiers as quantifiers restricted by an\nexistence predicate. That does not eliminate the mystery in his view:\nthe Quinean still claims not to understand the property that the\nexistence predicate supposedly expresses. But this is preferable to\nattributing the outright incoherence that comes with saying he has a\nradically different understanding of the quantifier. On this second,\nbetter interpretation, the Meinongian has a radically expansive\nontology filled with fictional entities, possibilia, and\nperhaps impossibilia as well.  Although the Meinongian may\nclaim to be a “noneist”, the Quinean's best way of\nunderstanding him makes him an “allist”. On this way of\nunderstanding the Meinongian, the quantifier account of ontological\ncommitment emerges unscathed.  A fourth objection to sufficiency has to do with how the criterion\nrelates to issues of realism and reduction, to the distinction\nbetween kinds of entity that are fundamental and kinds that are\nderived. It might seem that in cases of ontological reduction the\nquantifier criterion sometimes imputes ontological commitments where\nthere should be none. Consider a view that identifies chairs with\nsums of particles, and takes only the particles, not their sums, to\nbe fundamental. Consider the sentence ‘∃x\nChair(x)’, and ask: is it ontologically committed to\nchairs? The answer, on the quantifier criterion, is\n“yes”: chairs must be among the values of the variable\n‘x’ in order for the sentence to be\ntrue.[20] But,\none might object, since chairs are not fundamental on the\nview in question, they should not be counted among the\nsentence's ontological commitments. One can hold that there\nare chairs without being ontologically committed to\nchairs. The objection is misguided if directed at the quantifier\ncriterion as it has standardly been interpreted (and was\ninterpreted by Quine). The quantifier criterion was not designed to be\nsensitive to whether the entities assumed by a theory are fundamental\nor derived (see §3.2 below). If the\nvalues of the bound variables must include Ks, then the\ntheory is ontologically committed to Ks, whether Ks\nare fundamental or derived. That is simply how the criterion is to be\nunderstood. If we want a way to distinguish between ontological\ncommitments to fundamental kinds and ontological commitments to\nderived kinds, we need to look elsewhere. Fine has argued, however, that qua ontologists we do need\nto look\n elsewhere.[21] \nSuppose, with Fine, that there is a\nprimitive distinction between those entities that are\n“fundamentally real”, and those that are not. Let\n‘Real(x)’ be a predicate that marks this\ndistinction. (Unlike the Meinongian existence predicate considered\nin §1.7.3, this predicate is not derived\nfrom a special quantifier.) The ontologist's task, then, is to\ndetermine which entities and kinds of entity are fundamentally\nreal. But the quantifier account, being insensitive to this\ndistinction, will be of no use in carrying out this task and should\ntherefore be rejected. The quantifier account provides at best a\ncriterion for ordinary or scientific commitment,\nbut not the specifically ontological commitment of interest\nto metaphysicians. Indeed, since ordinary and scientific theories do\nnot contain the predicate ‘Real(x)’, they do not\nby themselves carry any ontological commitment. Only philosophical\ntheories that make claims about what entities or kinds of entity are\nfundamentally real carry such commitment. Ontology is an autonomous\ndiscipline; it cannot (as Quine would have it) be subsumed by\nscience. Once one accepts that a “reality” predicate is needed\nto characterize ontological commitment, a puzzle about the logic of\nontological commitment admits of a natural solution. The puzzle is\nthis (from Fine 2009). Because the natural numbers are included within\nthe integers, an ontological commitment to the integers, it seems,\nshould be a stronger commitment than a commitment to the natural\nnumbers. But quantifier accounts of ontological commitment get this\nbackwards: since commitment to Ks is associated with\nthe existential claim,\n‘∃x Kx’, a commitment to\nnatural numbers entails, and is thus stronger than, a commitment to\nintegers.  This can be set right, Fine holds, by associating\nontological commitment to Ks with a universal claim:\n∀x (K(x) ⊃\nReal(x). Quantifier accounts, because they lack a\n“reality” predicate, are unable to capture the logic of\nontological commitment. A defender of the quantifier account, however, can respond by\nnoting that there is a distinction between ontological commitment\nto Ks and ontological commitment to the Ks; the\nquantifier account aims only to analyze the former. Indeed, it seems\nplausible to say (as noted in §1.3)\nthat an ontological commitment to elephants carries with it an\nontological commitment to mammals, just not an ontological commitment\nto the mammals. An ontological commitment to the Ks,\non the quantifier account, can be understood as an ontological\ncommitment to each and every particular K. A criterion fails to be necessary for ontological\ncommitment if it undergenerates, if it sometimes fails to\nhold that a theory is committed to some kind of entity that the theory\nshould be committed to. Quantifier criteria will undergenerate if they\nfail to account for all the implicit ontological commitments of\ntheories. Whereas the problems canvassed\nin §1.6 for the sufficiency of a\nquantifier account can all be addressed by a devoted Quinean, the\nproblems with necessity are more serious. Indeed, they suggest that\nQuinean approaches that focus on the values of the variables of\nquantification should be jettisoned for a more general entailment\napproach to ontological commitment\n(§2).  To play its appointed role, a criterion of ontological commitment\nshould be ontologically neutral: it lets the theory speak for itself,\nas it were, without imposing ontological assumptions from the\noutside. Quinean criteria, however, by focusing only on the values of\nthe (individual) variables, have been accused of being ontologically\nbiased against realism about properties or universals because they\nfail to attach ontological significance to the\npredicate.[22]\nConsider ‘∃x Swims(x)’. According\nto Quinean criteria, this sentence is committed to entities that\nswim, but not to a property of swimming; for no property of swimming\nneed be among the values of the bound variables in order for the\nsentence to be true. One way to ensure ontological neutrality is to\nswitch to an entailment criterion. An entailment criterion—such\nas the modal entailment criterion\nin §1.5—avoids bias by allowing\nany component of a sentence to contribute to its ontological\ncommitments, not just the (first-order) quantifiers and bound\nvariables. If universals must exist in order for a theory to be true,\nthen the theory is ontologically committed to universals; if not,\nnot. And the same goes for particulars, or any other ontological\ncategory. This neutrality, however, comes at a price. The ontological\ncommitments of a theory—indeed, of a simple subject-predicate\nsentence—cannot be determined prior to resolving the debate\nbetween nominalists and realists. Ontological commitments will not be\ntransparent. Even a professed nominalist may in fact be committed to\nuniversals, willy-nilly. (For more on entailment accounts,\nsee §2.) In response to the charge of ontological bias, the Quinean might\ntry to turn the tables on the objector: to take predicates to carry\nontological commitment would be to be biased against\nnominalism. If even ‘∃x Swims(x)’\nwere committed to properties or universals, no theory would be\ncompatible with nominalism. In any case, the Quinean will reject the\ncharge of ontological bias. Ontological commitment to universals is\nnot excluded by the quantifier criteria; a theory couched in a\nfirst-order language whose variables range over universals can be so\ncommitted. For example, the sentence\n‘∃x∃y (Universal(y)\n& y=Swim &\nInstantiates(x,y)’ is committed to universals,\nas is, more simply, ‘∃y\nUniversal(y)’. The Quinean, then, simply asks that the\ncommitment to universals be made explicit in the same way that the\ncommitment to particulars is made explicit: by quantifying. Another reason for refusing to allow predicates to carry\nontological commitment parallels Quine's reason for refusing\nontological commitment to names: just as there can be empty names,\nthere can be empty predicates. (An empty predicate is not a predicate\nwith the null set for its extension; it is a predicate with no\nextension.) If I introduce the name ‘Herman’ stipulating\nthat it refers to the one and only monster under my bed, I introduce\nan empty name; and sentences containing ‘Herman’ should\nnot thereby be ontologically committed to monsters.  Similarly, if I\nintroduce a predicate ‘whish’ stipulating that it\nexpresses a biological kind property that applies to whales and fish\nbut excludes rabbits and rhinoceri, I introduce an empty predicate;\nand sentences containing ‘whish’ should not thereby be\nontologically committed to any biological kinds.  Parallel problems\nadmit of parallel solutions: we can eliminate predicates in favor of\nsecond-order variables, and take ontological commitment, if any, to be\ncarried by the second-order variables rather than the predicates. (But\nwe cannot make our second-order language too austere: we need to have\nsome non-logical descriptive vocabulary to express the (non-logical)\ncontent of the theory.) The charge of ontological bias against Quinean\ncriteria is simply shifted: why allow first-order variables\nto carry ontological commitment, but not second-order\nvariables? For Quine, this question simply doesn't arise.  Second-order logic\nis illegitimate because it treats predicates as if they were\nnames: Predicates have attributes as their “intensions” or\nmeanings (or would if there were attributes), and they have sets as\ntheir extensions; but they are names of neither. Variables eligible\nfor quantification therefore do not belong in predicate\npositions. (Quine 1970: 67) Second-order logic is “set theory in sheep's clothing”:\nthe ontological commitments of set theory have been hidden under the\nguise of logic. To make ontological commitment transparent, Quine\nholds, second-order theories must be transformed into first-order\ntheories by replacing second-order variables with first-order\nvariables ranging over sets, and taking predication to be set\nmembership. For the proponent of second-order theories, no such transformation\nis needed: the quantifier criterion can be applied directly to the\nvalues of the second-order variables. The ontological commitments of\nsecond-order theories will then depend on how the second-order\nvariables are interpreted. If the second-order variables range over\nproperties (“attributes”), then second-order theories are\ncommitted to properties; if instead they range over sets, then\nsecond-order theories are committed to sets. On either interpretation,\nany world at which a second-order theory is true will have either\nproperties or sets in its domain, and so the modal quantifier\ncriterion (from §1.5) can be applied\nwithout amendment. Extending the quantifier criterion to second-order\ntheories, then, would seem to be within the spirit, if not the letter,\nof Quine's account of ontological commitment. If the (monadic[23]) \nsecond-order quantifiers are\ninterpreted as plural quantifiers, as recommended by Boolos\n(1984), then, arguably,\nthey carry no additional ontological commitments beyond those already\ncarried by the first-order quantifiers. Plural quantification\nis ontologically innocent according to Boolos: to refer to\nsome things plurally—some books, for example—is not to\nrefer to a plural entity—a set, or set-like entity, with books\nas members—but to refer to the things—the books\nthemselves—in an irreducibly plural way.\n[24] \nIndividual and plural quantifiers range over the same domain. Since\nquantifier criteria attribute ontological commitment based on the\ndomain of quantification, they reveal no hidden ontological cost to\ntheories couched in an extension of first-order logic that includes\nplural quantification.  To get this result, we simply extend\nquantifier criteria to apply to plural as well as individual\nvariables. In slogan form: “to be is to be the value of some\nvariable or the values of some variables” (Boolos 1984). A plural variable takes as\nits semantic value a plurality of entities, not a plural entity (such\nas a set or class). Plural entities are not needed to serve as\nsemantic values—not, in any case, if the language in which the\nsemantics is done is itself a plural language. Within the framework of plural logic, however, there are two\ndistinctively different ways that a theory can be ontologically\ncommitted to entities, or kinds of entity, corresponding to the\ndistinction between distributive and collective predication (see Rayo\n(2007: 435–7), who calls the latter “plethological\ncommitment”). Suppose that ‘K’ is a\npredicate that applies to plural terms. If ‘K’\napplies distributively, then a theory that affirms the plural\nquantification “there are some things such that they\nare Ks” introduces no commitment beyond that of the\nsingular quantification “there is something such that it\nis K”. But if ‘K’ is a predicate\nthat applies collectively, then the plural quantification “there\nare some things such they are Ks” is committed\nto Ks in a distinctively plural way that, in general, cannot\nbe captured in terms of its ontological commitments. For example, the\nmereological nihilist who holds that “there are simples arranged\nchairwise” is thereby ontologically committed only to simples,\nnot to any plural entity containing simples; but she is also\ncommitted, in an irreducibly plural way, to there being simples\narranged chairwise. Quine's criterion is silent on the ontological commitments of\ntheories couched within intensional languages—languages with\nintensional operators such as ‘it is possible that’ or\n‘it will be that’ or ‘it is believed that’. If\nit were directly applied to such languages, it would run the risk of\nundergenerating ontological commitments: perhaps there are commitments\nhidden by the intensional operators, as would be the case if they are\ndisguised quantifiers.  Quine's extended criterion involving\nparaphrase can be applied; but now there is a danger of\novergenerating. For paraphrases of theories couched within an\nintensional language into first-order predicate logic will almost\ninevitably have to treat the intensional operators as disguised\nquantifiers, and it may be that any adequate domain for those\nquantifiers will require controversial entities that do not correctly\nrepresent the ontological commitments of the original intensional\ntheory. For example, if modal theories are “translated”\ninto first-order logic in the standard way, where\n‘possibly’ means ‘at some possible world’ and\n‘necessarily’ means ‘at all possible worlds’,\nthey will be ontologically committed to possible worlds according to\nthe extended quantifier criterion. But this seems to just beg the\nquestion against the modalist who does not think she is so\ncommitted. (For problems with the extended\ncriterion, see §4.2.) Entailment accounts of ontological commitment\n(§2) get this right, but only by\ndodging the hard questions. Thus, if modal operators are\ndisguised quantifiers over possible worlds, then modal theories will\nbe ontologically committed to possible worlds according to an\nentailment account: possible worlds must exist in order for the\ntheories to be true. If modal operators are not disguised\nquantifiers over possible worlds, then modal theories need not be\nontologically committed to possible worlds according to an entailment\naccount. An entailment account will accurately reflect the ontological\ntruth; but it does nothing to help us discover that truth.   Consider the sentence ‘∃x\nParent(x)’. Any criterion that focuses on the\nquestion—what entities need to be among the values of the\nvariable ‘x’ in order for this sentence to be\ntrue?—appears to get the ontological commitments of the sentence\nwrong (see Rayo 2007: 431–2). For the sentence appears to be\nontologically committed to children no less than\nto parents; but children do not need to be taken to be values\nof the variable in order for the sentence to be true (assuming, that\nis, that it is possible for a parent not also to be a child). We have\nhere, it seems, a stark division between two approaches to ontological\ncommitment: the quantifier approach, which looks only to the values of\nthe variables of the sentences of a theory, and the entailment\napproach, which looks to the existential entailments of the theory,\nand ignores whether or not the entities whose existence is entailed\nare values of the theory's variables. In cases where predicates\nexpress extrinsic properties, the quantifier approach undergenerates;\nit misses ontological commitments. Before addressing the objection from extrinsic properties, it is\nimportant to note an ambiguity in the informal expression of the\nquantifier account. When we ask, following Quine, “what entities\nmust be values of the variables” in order for a\ntheory T to be true, we might mean: what entities must\nbe assigned to the variables of the sentences in T in order\nfor T to be true. Or we might mean: what entities must\nbe included in the domain of the interpretation of T in order\nfor T to be true, whether or not those entities must be\nassigned to the variables of the sentences in T. When\npredicates of the theory express extrinsic properties, this difference\nmatters. In this article, Quine's criterion—and quantifier\ncriteria more generally—have always been understood in the\nfirst, stronger way. But those philosophers who take Quine's criterion\nto be compatible with an entailment approach to ontological commitment\nare best understood as interpreting him in the second, weaker way. There are two ways that one might try to defend the quantifier\naccount, neither very satisfactory. First, one might simply restrict\nthe predicates of the language of the theory to those that express\nintrinsic properties (and relations). Perhaps one could argue that the\ntheories Quine had primarily in mind, theories of mathematics and\nnatural science, obey this restriction already with respect to their\nprimitive predicates (though this has been contested even for physics,\nand is not plausible for the special sciences).  But this would be a\nrather severe restriction; and there is no evidence that Quine had\nintended the criterion to be restricted in this way. Moreover, it\nwould needlessly inject controversies over which properties and\nrelations are intrinsic into the application of the criterion,\nthreatening both its foundational and polemical roles. Second, one might dig in one's heels and deny that\n‘∃x Parent(x)’ is committed to\nchildren. One familiar gloss on “the ontological commitments of\na theory” takes this to include only “what the theory\nsays there is”. If “says” is interpreted narrowly,\na theory that contained only ‘∃x\nParent(x)’ does not say that children exist,\neven though this follows analytically from the theory. In defense of\nthe view, one can point out that the intuitive judgment that\n‘∃x Parent(x)’ is ontologically\ncommitted to children comes from including the definitions of\n‘Parent(x)’ and ‘Child(x)’\nas an unspoken part of the theory. (Compare the defense of the\nmetalinguistic criterion in §1.4.)\nThus, if we suppose the language contains, in addition to the unary\npredicate ‘Parent(x)’, the unary predicate\n‘Child(x)’ and the binary predicate\n‘Parent(x,y)’; and we suppose the theory\ncontains, in addition to ‘∃x\nParent(x)’, the sentences ‘∀x\n(Parent(x) if and only if ∃y\nParent(x,y))’ and ‘∀x\n(Child(x) if and only if ∃y\nParent(y,x))’, then the modal quantifier account gets\nthe ontological commitments of the beefed-up theory right: for every\nworld and sub-domain of the domain of that world such that the theory\nis true at that world with its variables ranging over that\nsub-domain, children are in the sub-domain. Perhaps the existence of\nchildren is an implicit commitment of\n‘∃x Parent(x)’; but, on the view\nbeing considered, the quantifier account should not be required to\ncapture all the implicit commitments of the theory. One problem with this view, at least as a defense of\nthe modal quantifier account, is that it requires an\ninvidious distinction between different sorts of analytic entailment;\nfor, although ‘∃x Parent(x)’ is\nnot committed to children according to the modal quantifier criterion,\n‘∃x Bachelor(x)’ is\ncommitted to males. The chief problem, however, with accepting a\ncriterion that omits implicit ontological commitments is that it\nundermines the philosophical use of the criterion. Surely, the\nimplicit ontological commitments of the theory must be included in\ntabulating the ontological costs of a theory. Enjoining the theorist\nto “make all implicit ontological commitments explicit”\ndoes not solve the problem because the theorist may not know, and may\nbe in no position to know, the implicit commitments of her\ntheory. Such ignorance, however, does not make the theory less\ncostly. It seems, then, that the problem of extrinsic\nproperties—and, more generally, the problem of capturing\nimplicit ontological commitment—provides a genuine\ncounterexample to quantifier accounts of ontological commitment.  The problem of extrinsic properties arises because there are\nanalytic connections between one predicate holding of a thing and\nanother predicate holding of some other thing.  Similar problems arise\nfor quantifier criteria if there are metaphysically necessary\nconnections between non-identical things. Thus, if a set cannot exist\nwithout its members existing, then it appears that a theory that\ncontains ‘∃x x =\n{a, b}’ is ontologically committed to the\nexistence of a. But a need not be assigned as a\nvalue to the variable ‘x’ in order for the theory\nto be true.  Similarly, if a whole cannot exist without one of its\nparts existing, then there appears to be implicit commitment. Suppose,\nfor example, that a human cannot exist without his head. Then a theory\nthat contains ‘∃x x = Obama’ is\nontologically committed to Obama's head. But, again, Obama's head need\nnot be assigned as a value to the variable ‘x’ in\norder for the theory to be true. Responses can be given that parallel the responses to the problem\nof extrinsic properties. And a parallel conclusion applies: to capture\nthese cases of implicit ontological commitment, one must switch from a\nquantifier account to an entailment account. According to an entailment account of ontological commitment: A\ntheory T is ontologically committed to Ks\nif and only if T entails that Ks exist. One must\nspeak of an entailment account because different entailment\nrelations lead to different accounts of ontological commitment; the\nchallenge is to find the right entailment relation. But in\nany case, entailment accounts do not “look to the values of the\nvariables” for the ontological commitments of a theory.\nQuantifiers and variables have no privileged role; they figure into\nthe ontological commitments of a theory only to the extent that they\nfigure into the entailments of the theory, just as with other\ncomponents of the sentences of the theory. Entailment accounts, as understood here, have the feature that\nontological commitment depends only on the content of a\ntheory, not on its logical form. (Thus, the metalinguistic\naccount discussed in §1.4 is not\nincluded.)  Two theories that have the same content, then, have the\nsame ontological commitments. If we say that theories have the same\ncontent just when they mutually entail one another, then each\nentailment account comes with its own notion of content; the problem\nof finding the right entailment relation is just the problem of\nfinding the right notion of content, the notion that is relevant to\nontological commitment. It is convenient, though not obligatory, to hypostasize content and\nspeak of the propositions expressed by the sentences of the\ntheory. That allows us to neatly separate the problem of determining\nthe ontological commitments of a theory (set of sentences) into two\ncomponents: What propositions are expressed by the sentences of the\ntheory? And, what are the ontological commitments, that is, the\nexistential entailments, of those propositions? Indeed, we could then\nchoose to construe theories as sets of propositions and treat all talk\nof sentences as outside the bounds of an account of ontological\ncommitment proper. But propositions are controversial entities, not\naccepted by all parties to the debate. To maintain neutrality, we will\ncontinue to apply ontological commitment to theories construed as sets\nof sentences, but with the understanding that, for the friend of\npropositions, the ontological commitment of sentences is just the\nontological commitment of the propositions those sentences\nexpress. The principle advantage of entailment accounts over quantifier\naccounts is that they have no problem with implicit ontological\ncommitment. (Or, more exactly, since different entailment accounts\nwill differ as to what counts as implicit content, entailment accounts\nhave no problem with what counts as implicit ontological commitment by\nthat account's own standards.) If ‘∃x\nHuman(x)’ entails not only that humans exist, but that\nhumanity exists, then it is ontologically committed to properties or\nuniversals, even though no property or universal is the value of any\nquantified variable. If ‘∃x\nParent(x)’ entails that children exist, then\n‘∃x Parent(x)’ is ontologically\ncommitted to children, again, even though it need not “quantify\nover” any children. An entailment account, unlike the quantifier\naccount, gets these cases right—supposing, that is, we want our\naccount to capture implicit ontological commitment. For a stark illustration of the difference between entailment and\nquantifier accounts, consider a theory T that contains the\nsingle sentence ‘∃x K(x)’\nand the theory T* that contains the single sentence\n‘True(T)’ (see Peacock (2011: 81–2), who\ncalls T* a “meta-theory”). T\nand T* mutually entail one another (assuming\n‘K’ is not a semantical predicate); they thus\nhave the same ontological commitments on an entailment account. And\nthis seems right.  Surely, a philosopher cannot eliminate her\ncommitment to Ks by switching from T to T*;\nit matters not that T*'s commitment to Ks is only\nimplicit. But this implicit ontological commitment is invisible to the\nquantifier account because T* has no quantificational\nstructure. Once again, by missing implicit commitments, the quantifier\naccount fails to capture the ontological costs of a theory. The principle disadvantage of an entailment account as compared\nwith a quantifier account is that it fails to provide a neutral\nplatform for assessing the ontological costs of theories:\ndisagreements over ontology will often reappear as disagreements over\nthe existential entailments of a theory. Here it is important to\ndistinguish two things that might be meant by “criterion of\nontological commitment”. (This isn't always done; but Jackson\n(1989) and Rayo (2007) are clear on the distinction.) One might mean\na test by which ontological commitments can be discovered. Or\none might mean an analysis that says what ontological\ncommitment consists in. An adequate test would be a procedure\nthat could be applied by all parties in a neutral way, independently\nof those parties' prior ontological beliefs. Quine believed that the\nquantifier criterion provided such a test. He was aware, of course,\nthat there would be disputes over how best to regiment theories within\nfirst-order logic. But—or so he thought—once theories were\nregimented, the quantifier criterion would supply unequivocal\nverdicts. A correct analysis of ontological commitment, however\ntheoretically valuable, might do nothing towards providing an adequate\ntest. Such an analysis, unaccompanied by a test, would be of little\nhelp in determining the ontological costs of theories, or resolving\nontological disputes. Entailment accounts have good claim to providing\na correct analysis of ontological commitment; but they do not provide\na test. For one thing, the parties to an ontological dispute will\noften disagree as to what propositions are expressed by the sentences\nof a theory, that is, as to what the truth conditions of those\nsentences are. Quine's criterion bypasses this problematic step by\napplying the criterion only to already regimented theories. For a\nsecond thing, parties to an ontological dispute will often disagree\nover the existential entailments of a theory (see\n§2.2 below).  Quine's criterion (as he understood it) avoids\nthis problem by focusing on the formal relation of logical entailment\nbetween sentences, a relation that is well understood. The material\nrelations of entailment between the propositions, however—be\nthey modal, or conceptual, or a priori—are matters of\nmuch dispute. If the goal is to find an adequate test for ontological\ncommitment, entailment accounts fall short. Initially, one might have hoped to combine an entailment\naccount, qua analysis, with a quantifier\naccount, qua test. (Arguably, this is the best way to\nunderstand Quine's project.) But the problems with implicit commitment\nsuggest that the entailment analysis and the quantifier test do not\nmatch up, that the test will undergenerate with respect to the\nanalysis. One could dampen one's ambitions, and be content with a\none-sided test, a test that in general provides only a sufficient\ncondition. (This is suggested by Rayo (2007: 432) as a response to the\nproblem of extrinsic properties.) But a one-sided test won't be of\nmuch help in comparing the ontological costs of theories. Such\ncomparisons require that all costs be put on the table. The problem of applying an entailment account to ontological\ndisputes is especially acute if the entailment relation is taken to\nbe necessary implication. That choice results in the\nfollowing criterion (introduced above\nin §1.5): Modal Entailment Criterion. A theory T\nis ontologically committed to Ks iff T\nnecessarily implies that Ks exist iff, for every\n(metaphysically) possible world w, T is true\nat w only if the domain of w contains at least one\nK.[25] On this criterion, every theory is ontologically committed to every\nnecessarily existing kind of entity, what was called above\n(§1.5) the problem of irrelevant\nnecessary existents. The problem can be ignored when comparing\nthe ontological costs of theories that disagree only over contingently\nexisting kinds: the irrelevant commitments are the same for both\ntheories, and cancel one another out. But many traditional ontological\ndisputes are over the existence of necessarily existing kinds of\nentity, such as mathematical entities or intensional\nentities. Consider, for example two theories that disagree only over\nwhether numbers exist. On the modal entailment criterion, these\ntheories have the same ontological commitments; moreover, supposing\nnumbers do exist, the theory that explicitly denies the existence of\nnumbers is nonetheless committed to numbers. Clearly, the modal\nentailment criterion fails to capture the intuitive notion of\nontological commitment.  Applying the criterion in this case will do\nnothing to further the ontological enterprise. Jackson (1989) highlights the problem of irrelevant necessary\nexistents by comparing the following two arguments: Suppose, for the sake of argument, that non-actual possible worlds\nnecessarily exist. Then the second premises, B2 and C2, are both true\non the modal entailment account. Moreover, on the modal entailment\naccount, both of these arguments are necessarily truth preserving. It\nseems to follow that the conclusion that non-actual possible worlds\nexist can be supported either by arguing for B1, that modal\nrealism is true, or by arguing for C1, that materialism is true. But,\nsurely, an argument for materialism provides no support for the claim\nthat possible worlds exist. Or, to turn this around, an objection to\nthe claim that possible worlds exist does not cast doubt on\nmaterialism. Jackson defends the modal entailment account in the following\nway. Although the two arguments are on a par with respect to validity,\nand the truth of their premises,\n  there is an enormous epistemological difference\nbetween the arguments. … doubts about the existence of\nnon-actual possible worlds cannot cast doubt on B1, but can cast doubt\non C1. (Jackson 1989: 197–8)\n Thus, there is an epistemological relation between propositions,\n“casts doubt on”, which holds between CC and C1 but not\nbetween CC (=BC) and B1. Or, turning this around once again, there is\nan epistemological relation—presumably some sort of a\npriori entailment relation—according to which modal realism\nentails that non-actual possible worlds exist, but materialism does\nnot entail that non-actual possible worlds exist. Jackson says nothing\nto further characterize this relation, let alone provide a semantic\nanalysis. But, however the relation is precisely characterized, the\nnatural question to put to Jackson is: why not use that\nrelation, in place of modal entailment, to characterize ontological\ncommitment? For, clearly, this “epistemological”\nentailment relation better tracks our judgments as to the ontological\ncommitments of theories; and it is the “epistemological”\nrelation, not modal entailment, that will have to be brought to bear\nwhen comparing the ontological costs of theories positing necessary\nexistents. Peacock (2011) also defends the modal entailment account from the\nproblem of irrelevant necessary existents. In particular, he argues\nthat the ontological costs of theories positing necessary existents\ncan be compared by considering, not the theories' actual\ncommitments (which cannot be known prior to determining the truth of\nthe theories), but by considering “what ontology\nwe would regard a theory as implicitly committed to, were it\ntrue” (Peacock 2011: 93). This suggests that there is some\ncounterfactual relation between propositions according to\nwhich—to return to Jackson's example—non-actual possible\nworlds would have to exist if modal realism were true, but it is not\nthe case that non-actual possible worlds would have to exist if\nmaterialism were true. This counterfactual relation, of course, could\nnot be given a standard possible worlds analysis lest it apply\nvacuously to impossible antecedents. But even supposing a semantics\nfor such a counterfactual relation could be given, the natural\nquestion to put to Peacock is: why not use that relation, in\nplace of modal entailment, to characterize ontological commitment?\nFor it is this counterfactual relation, not modal entailment, that\nwill have to be brought to bear when comparing the ontological costs\nof theories positing necessary\nexistents.[26]\nIn sum: neither Jackson nor Peacock give any positive reason to hold\non to a modal entailment account, which is puzzling in light of the\nfact that each is committed to there being an entailment\nrelation—be it epistemological or counterfactual—that\nbetter fits the role that the notion of ontological commitment was\nintroduced to play. If the notion of ontological commitment is to play a role in theory\nchoice or clarifying ontological disputes, then the ontological\ncommitments of a theory must be rationally accessible;\nfailure to acknowledge the ontological commitments of one's theory\nmust be a rational failing (see Michael 2008). That puts the following\nepistemic constraint on the entailment relation that is invoked by an\nentailment account of ontological commitment: the entailments of a\ntheory must be knowable by any ideally rational agent, that is to say,\nmust be knowable a priori. Does modal entailment meet this\nconstraint? With respect to the examples considered thus\nfar—theories positing necessary existents—it may depend on\nhow “ideally rational” and “a priori”\nare understood; some philosophers would argue that entities that\nnecessarily exist can be known a priori to exist. But if\n(following Kripke 1980) we accept that there are necessary\npropositions that cannot be known a priori, then modal\nentailment will run afoul of the epistemic constraint. Suppose, for\nexample, that ‘Water is H2O’ is\n(metaphysically) necessary but not knowable a priori. Then\nthe theory containing the single sentence, ‘Water exists’,\nmodally entails that hydrogen exists. But, according to the epistemic\nconstraint, the existence of hydrogen should not be an entailment on\nan entailment account of ontological commitment. It appears that some\nsort of a priori entailment relation must take the place of\nmodal entailment in the analysis of ontological commitment: A Priori Entailment Criterion. A theory T\nis ontologically committed to Ks\niff T a priori entails that Ks exist iff,\nfor every conceptually possible world w, T is true\nat w only if the domain of w contains at least one\nK.[27] Switching to an a priori entailment relation goes partway\ntowards restoring the applicability of an entailment account to\nontological disputes. It allows that philosophers—if ideally\nrational—will be able to agree on the ontological commitments\nof propositions. But there is still the problem of\ndetermining what propositions are expressed by the sentences of a\ntheory, that is, what the truth conditions of those sentences are. If\nthe sentences are couched within ordinary or philosophical English, so\nthat their truth conditions are not just a matter of stipulation,\nthere may be no resolving the dispute, even among ideally rational\nphilosophers (see §4). Quantifier accounts of ontological commitment, we have seen, are\nliable to miss the implicit ontological commitments of\ntheories because they look exclusively to the values of the variables\nof quantification. Entailment accounts succeed in capturing implicit\ncommitments, but are liable to overgenerate if the entailment\nrelation fails to be sensitive to relevant ontological\ndistinctions. According to truthmaker accounts of ontological\ncommitment, being a truthmaker for a theory is just such a\nrelevant ontological distinction: to find the ontological commitments\nof a theory, we should look towards the truthmakers for that theory;\na theory is ontologically committed to Ks only\nif Ks are needed in order to make the theory true. According\nto truthmaker theorists, focusing on truthmakers will eliminate\nspurious ontological commitments of an entailment theory. The problem\nfor a truthmaker account, however, is how to do this without also\neliminating genuine ontological\ncommitments.[28] Truthmaker accounts, like entailment accounts, have the feature\nthat ontological commitment depends only on the content of a\ntheory, not on its logical form. That will be so if the\nprimary truthbearers are taken to be non-linguistic propositions\n(individuated by content) rather than sentences. In that case,\nontological commitment applies directly to the propositions, or to\ntheories construed as sets of propositions, and only indirectly to\nthe sentences, or sets of sentences, that express those propositions.\nThat has the benefit, as with the entailment account, of freeing the\nnotion of ontological commitment from language (see\n§2.1).  But taking propositions to be truthbearers will not\nbe to every truthmaker theorist's liking. Moreover, different views\non the nature of propositions—possible worlds accounts,\nRussellian accounts, Fregean accounts, to name a few—lead to\nsomewhat different truthmaker accounts. To remain neutral in what\nfollows with respect to the existence and nature of propositions,\nsentences will be taken to be the bearers of truth, and ontological\ncommitment will continue to be applied to theories construed as sets\nof sentences.[29] Say that an entity makes true (or is a truthmaker\nfor) a sentence or theory if the existence of that entity is, in\nsome sense, sufficient for the truth of the sentence or\ntheory. (It is left open for now just how to understand this notion of\nsufficiency.) In some cases, truthmakers are easy to come by. For\nexample, the sentence ‘Socrates exists’ has Socrates as a\ntruthmaker (assuming, at any rate, that Socrates has real\nexistence; see §3.2 below). The\nsentence ‘Elephants exist’ has multiple truthmakers: each\nand every particular elephant (assuming elephants are necessarily\nelephants; see §3.3 below). Other cases\nare more problematic. Consider the conjunction: ‘Socrates exists\nand Plato exists’. Neither Socrates nor Plato, by himself, is a\ntruthmaker for the conjunction; we need the pair of Socrates\nand Plato. But how should we understand ‘pair’ here? There\nare three options. If one is a universalist about mereological\ncomposition—for any things, there is a mereological sum composed\nof just those things—then perhaps the sum of Socrates and Plato\ncan serve as a truthmaker for the conjunction. If one is a realist\nabout sets—and sets exist “in the world” when their\nmembers do—then perhaps the set with Socrates and Plato as its\nmembers can serve as a truthmaker. But if we reject mereological\nuniversalism and set theoretic realism, then we will have to allow\nthat the truthmaker relation takes a plural argument: Socrates and\nPlato together are truthmakers for the conjunction, but there is no\nsingle entity that is a truthmaker. In what follows, it will be\nsimplest to speak as if, whenever a theory has truthmakers, it has a\nsingle entity as a truthmaker; but only minor emendations would be\nneeded to allow for plural truthmaking. Some sentences, it is natural to think, have neither singular nor\nplural truthmakers (see Lewis 2001). For example, a negative\nexistential sentence such as ‘There are no unicorns’ is\nmade true, it seems, not by what exists, but by what fails to exist:\nit is true for lack of any falsemakers. And whether a (contingent)\npredication such as ‘the ball is red” is made true by the\nball in question will depend on how the notion of sufficiency is\nunderstood (see  Supplement to\n§3.3).  Truthmaker maximalists hold\nthat every truth (or at least every contingent truth) has a\ntruthmaker. Typically, truthmaker maximalists will\nintroduce states of affairs or facts to serve as the\nrequired truthmakers: totality states of affairs can serve as\ntruthmakers for negative existentials (see Armstrong 2004:\n72–5); the state of affairs of the ball's being red, not the red\nball itself, is the truthmaker for ‘the ball is red’ (see\nArmstrong 1997: 115–6).  There is a danger here that truthmaking\ncould be trivialized: could any true sentence S be said to\nhave the state of affairs that S as its truthmaker?\nTypically, truthmaker maximalists avoid such trivialization by holding\nto a sparse theory of states of affairs. For example, a disjunctive\nsentence ‘S or T’ is not made true by a\ndisjunctive state of affairs: there are none. Rather, the truthmakers\nfor S (if any) and the truthmakers for T (if any)\nare separately truthmakers for the disjunction ‘S\nor T’. In any case, truthmaker maximalism is not\nrequired for the truthmaker approach to ontological commitment. What\nmatters, rather, is that the truthmakers and the ontological\ncommitments of a theory are aligned. How might a truthmaker criterion for ontological commitment be\nformulated? It will be useful to separately consider two versions, one\nfor ontological commitment to particular entities, the other for\nontological commitment to kinds: Truthmaker Criterion for Particulars: A theory T\nis ontologically committed to a particular a iff,\nnecessarily, if T is true, then a is a truthmaker\nfor T. Truthmaker Criterion for Kinds: A theory T\nis ontologically committed to Ks iff, necessarily,\nif T is true, then Ks are among the truthmakers\nfor T. Note that in the criterion for particulars the necessity is de\nre. The particular a itself must be a truthmaker\nfor T in any world where T is true. But in the\ncriterion for kinds the necessity must be taken to be de\ndicto (with respect to ‘K’) if the criterion\nis to give the desired results. For example, ‘there are\nelephants’ is ontologically committed to elephants according to\nthe criterion if some elephant or other is a truthmaker for\n‘there are elephants’ in any world in which it is true,\nwhether or not any actual elephant is a truthmaker in those\nworlds. How should we understand the truthmaking relation, and the way in\nwhich the existence of the truthmaker is sufficient for the\ntruth of the theory? On the orthodox necessitation approach to\ntruthmaking (Fox 1987; Bigelow 1988: 125; Armstrong 1997: 115; Lewis\n2001), this sufficiency is analyzed in modal terms as\nfollows: x is a truthmaker for T\niff T is true and, necessarily, if x exists,\nthen T is true. (A plural version replaces the singular\nvariable ‘x’ with a plural variable\n‘xx’ (read “the xs”).) This\nleads to a familiar problem when truthmakers are sought for necessary\ntheories: any entity (or plurality of entities) is a truthmaker for\nany necessary theory on the analysis. And there is the familiar fix:\nreplace modal entailment (in the analysis of truthmaking) with a more\ndiscriminating entailment relation, perhaps some sort of relevant\nentailment (Restall 1996). But for many truthmaker theorists, no\nentailment relation will be able to capture the idea that truthmakers\nmust be fundamental entities, and must ground the\ntheories they make true. This drives these truthmaker theorists to\nintroduce a primitive grounding or in-virtue-of relation to\ncharacterize the truthmaking relation: x is\na truthmaker for T iff T is true and,\nnecessarily, Ts truth is grounded in x\n(or T is true in virtue of the existence\nof x) (see Schaffer 2010 and Cameron forthcoming).  Call\nthis the grounding account of\ntruthmaking.[30] According to truthmaker necessitarianism, the existence of\nthe truthmaker necessitates the truth of the sentence: any\npossible world in which the truthmaker exists is a world in which the\nsentence is true. Truthmaker necessitarianism is automatic on the\nnecessitation analysis of truthmaking. On a grounding account,\ntruthmaker necessitarianism can be upheld by endorsing an axiomatic\nconstraint on the notion of grounding: if an entity grounds\nthe truth of a sentence, then, necessarily, if the entity exists,\nthen the sentence is true. The problems to be discussed\n(in §3.3\nand §3.4) apply to any truthmaker\naccount of ontological commitment that endorses truthmaker\nnecessitarianism.[31] The truthmaker criterion for ontological commitment to kinds, as\nformulated above, strengthens the modal entailment criterion\n(§2.2) since, necessarily,\nif Ks are among the truthmakers for T,\nthen Ks exist. Thus, on a truthmaker account, for a theory\nto be ontologically committed to Ks, it is required not only\nthat there exist Ks if the theory is true, but that there\nexist Ks that are truthmakers for the theory, if\nthe theory is true. The chief reason given for the strengthening\n(Cameron 2008, 2010) is this: if the Ks are\nnot fundamental entities, if they lack real\nexistence, then a theory can entail that Ks exist\nwithout thereby incurring ontological commitment to Ks. For\nexample, suppose one holds that, although it can truly be said that\nchairs exist, only (mereological) simples (or states of affairs\ninvolving those simples) are fundamental, or have real\nexistence. Moreover, suppose that only entities that are fundamental,\nor have real existence, can play the truthmaking role, in line with\nthe grounding account of truthmaking. Then, the (true) sentence\n‘chairs exist’ is made true, not by chairs, but only by\nsimples arranged chairwise. It then follows on the truthmaker account\nof ontological commitment that ‘chairs exist’ is\ncommitted only to simples arranged chairwise, not to chairs. And,\narguably, this is the right result: chairs should not be counted\namong the ontological commitments of ‘chairs exist’\nbecause, on the view being supposed, they do not add to the\nontological cost of accepting ‘chairs exist’. In\nArmstrong's memorable phrase: they are “an ontological free\nlunch” (Armstrong 1997: 12–3).  This result cannot be had\nby the quantifier account or the entailment account because these\naccounts are both insensitive to the crucial distinction between\nexistence and real existence. These accounts inevitably\novergenerate commitments, thus ruling out by fiat a minimal ontology\nthat accepts only simples. Much more would have to be said in a defense of the truthmaker\naccount about the distinction between existence and real\nexistence.[32]\nBut let us suppose for what follows that the distinction is\nlegitimate, and has the ontological significance attributed to\nit. Still, one might wonder whether we have just changed the\nsubject. On the traditional notion of ontological commitment, as\nintroduced by Quine, it is supposed to be trivially true that\n‘Ks exist’ is ontologically committed\nto Ks (see §1.6.4). Instead of\nproviding an account of a theory's ontological commitment as\ntraditionally understood, the truthmaker account is an account of a\ntheory's fundamental ontological commitments. Looked at in\nthis way, the quantifier account and the truthmaker account are not\nin competition, and can live side by side (see Schaffer 2008).  Even if the dispute is partly terminological, however, sometimes\nthe choice of terminology matters. It is important to be clear on what\nthe different notions of ontological commitment are, and how they fit\nin to the general project of ontology. Given a distinction between\nexistence and real existence, the notion of ontological commitment\nbifurcates into two distinct notions, one shallow and\none deep. On the shallow notion, entities that exist but do\nnot really exist are to be counted among the ontological commitments\nof a theory: it is trivial or analytic that ‘Socrates\nexists’ is committed to Socrates, and that ‘elephants\nexist’ is committed to elephants, whether or not Socrates or\nelephants have real existence. On the deep notion, only entities that\nreally exist count towards the theory's ontological\ncommitments. Ontological commitment, arguably, has traditionally been\ngiven the shallow interpretation; but that is because, within the\northodox Quinean setting, there simply is no ontologically relevant\ndistinction between existence and real existence. Once the distinction\nis accepted, however, and the project of ontology is construed to be\nthe project of discovering not what there is, but what\nthere really is, then it is only the deep notion of\nontological commitment that resonates with the ontological\n enterprise.[33] \nIt is an analysis of this deep notion, as given by the truthmaker \naccount, that matters for ontology. Just as there are shallow and deep notions of ontological\ncommitment, so there are shallow and deep notions of truthmaking.  On\nthe necessitation account of truthmaking, truthmaking is shallow:\nSocrates is a truthmaker for ‘Socrates exists’ and\nelephants are truthmakers for ‘elephants exist’, whether\nor not Socrates or elephants have real existence. On the grounding\naccount of truthmaking, truthmaking is deep: only real existents can\nserve as truthmakers.  Clearly, if we pair a shallow interpretation of\nontological commitment with a deep interpretation of truthmaking, then\na truthmaker account of ontological commitment is off the table: the\nontological commitments and the truthmakers of a theory will not be\naligned.  In evaluating a truthmaker account, then, it must be\nsupposed from the start that either both notions are taken to be\nshallow or both notions are taken to be deep. In what follows, both\nwill be taken to be deep in accord with the truthmaker theorist's\nintentions. Let us begin an evaluation of the truthmaker account with a problem\nfor the truthmaker criterion for ontological commitment to\nparticulars: the problem of inessential predication. Consider\nthe sentence ‘Socrates is wise’, and suppose that Socrates\nreally exists. (If not, switch to an inessential predication whose\nsubject is an entity that really exists.) Then it seems undeniable\nthat ‘Socrates is wise’ is ontologically committed to\nSocrates. But, given truthmaker necessitarianism and the orthodox\nunderstanding of essential properties, Socrates will not be a\ntruthmaker for ‘Socrates is wise’ on the truthmaker\naccount. Wisdom, presumably, is not an essential property of Socrates;\nand so Socrates' mere existence does not necessitate his being\nwise. But, then, the truthmaker account of ontological commitment for\nparticulars wrongly claims that ‘Socrates is wise’\nis not ontologically committed to Socrates. Note that this\nproblem doesn't arise for essential predications. Suppose,\nfor example, that Socrates is essentially human. Then Socrates' mere\nexistence necessitates his being human, and ‘Socrates is\nhuman’ has Socrates both as a truthmaker and as an ontological\ncommitment. But pointing this out only seems to make matters worse for\nthe truthmaker account: why should ‘Socrates is human’ but\nnot ‘Socrates is wise’ be ontologically committed to\nSocrates? Essential and inessential predications should be treated on\na par with respect to ontological commitment. An analog of the problem of inessential predication applies to the\ntruthmaker criterion of ontological commitment to kinds. Consider the\nsentence ‘philosophers exist’, and suppose that\nphilosophers really exist. Then it seems undeniable that\n‘philosophers exist’ is ontologically committed to\nphilosophers. Presumably, however, philosophers are not essentially\nphilosophers. And so, given truthmaker necessitarianism, no\nphilosopher is a truthmaker for ‘philosophers exist’: any\nphilosopher is such that he or she could have existed in a\nphilosopher-less world. The truthmaker criterion for kinds, then,\nwrongly claims that ‘philosophers exist’ is not\nontologically committed to philosophers. Call this the problem of\ninessential generalization. Different accounts of truthmaking—of which entities are\ntruthmakers, and what their essential properties are—will lead\nto different responses. Since adequate responses appear to be\navailable to the truthmaker theorist, these responses are relegated to\nthe supplementary document. The truthmaker account of ontological commitment—like the\nquantifier account, but for an entirely different reason—has a\nproblem with capturing implicit commitment. The problem arises\nbecause the truthmakers for a theory, but not the ontological\ncommitments of a theory, are entities whose existence\nis sufficient for the truth of the theory. The problem\nafflicts both the truthmaker criterion for particulars, and for\nkinds. Indeed, assuming truthmaker necessitarianism, it follows from\nthe former criterion that a theory is ontologically committed to a\nparticular only if the existence of the particular is both\nnecessary and sufficient for the truth of the theory; it follows from\nthe latter criterion that a theory is ontologically committed to a\nkind only if the existence of some members (or other) of the kind\nis both necessary and sufficient for the truth of the\ntheory. But the examples of implicit commitment considered\nin §1.7.4\nand §1.7.5 suggest that sufficiency\nis not required for ontological commitment. The truthmaker account,\nlike the quantifier account, undergenerates\ncommitments.[34] To illustrate the problem of sufficiency, consider the following\nexamples. Suppose, as is standard, that the existence of a set\nnecessitates the existence of any of its members. Then, intuitively,\nthe sentence ‘{a, b} exists’ is\nimplicitly committed to a, a result that is captured by\nentailment accounts of ontological commitment. But since the existence\nof a is not sufficient for the existence of\n{a, b}, a is not a truthmaker for\n‘{a, b} exists’, and the truthmaker\ncriterion for particulars fails to capture this commitment. For a\nsecond example, suppose that, necessarily, elephants have trunks, but\nthat any trunk could exist without there existing any elephants.\nThen, intuitively, the sentence ‘elephants exist’ is\nontologically committed, not only to elephants, but to elephants'\ntrunks, a result that is captured by entailment accounts. But since\ntrunks are not among the truthmakers for ‘elephants\nexist’, the truthmaker criterion for kinds fails to capture this\ncommitment. For a final example, consider the sentence\n‘bachelors exist’. Since it is analytic (suppose) that\nmales exist if bachelors exist, this sentence, intuitively, is\nontologically committed to males, a result that is captured by both\nquantifier and entailment accounts. But no male is a truthmaker for\n‘bachelors exist’, since any male could exist without\nthere existing any bachelors. So, again, the truthmaker criterion for\nkinds fails to capture an implicit commitment. How might a defender of the truthmaker account\nrespond?[35] It\nwon't do to claim that the notion of ontological commitment targeted\nby the truthmaker account doesn't include the missing implicit\ncommitments.  For one thing, the truthmaker criterion will let in\nthose implicit commitments that pass the sufficiency test, and there\nseems to be no principled reason for admitting these implicit\ncommitments, but not the others. More importantly, excluding implicit\ncommitments does not sit well with the chief motivation for a\ntruthmaker account, viz., that ontological commitments should reflect\nfundamental ontology; for commitments are no less fundamental for\nbeing implicit. The mismatch between the notions of ontological\ncommitment and truthmaking—that the ontological commitments of\na theory are entities whose existence is necessary, given the truth\nof the theory, whereas the truthmakers of a theory are entities whose\nexistence is sufficient for the truth of the theory—seems to be\na serious problem for a truthmaker account of ontological commitment,\nat least as presented above. Perhaps the best response to the problem of sufficiency for a\ntruthmaker theorist who wants to capture a deep notion of ontological\ncommitment is to omit the requirement that the ontological commitments\nof a theory be truthmakers for that theory. It is enough that\nthey are truthmakers for some theory or other, that is, that they are\nentities that really exist. This leads to the following criteria: Weakened Truthmaker Criterion for Particulars: A\ntheory T is ontologically committed to a\nparticular a iff T entails that a really\nexists. Weakened Truthmaker Criterion for Kinds: A\ntheory T is ontologically committed to Ks\niff T entails that Ks are among the entities that\nreally exist.[36] But it is doubtful that this is properly called a truthmaker\naccount of ontological commitment. The (deep) ontological\ncommitments of a theory are no longer being analyzed in terms of the\ntruthmaker commitments of the theory, but instead in terms of its\nfundamental commitments, its commitments to entities that really\nexist. And these, we have seen, are not the same. If a quantifier account of ontological commitment is to be applied\ndirectly to ordinary language, we need to know which ordinary language\nquantifiers or uses of quantifiers (if any) are ontologically\ncommitting. The same goes for entailment and truthmaker accounts,\nnotwithstanding our relaxed attitude in applying the accounts to\nordinary language examples. For on both accounts ontological\ncommitment depends on the entailment of existentially quantified\nsentences, and we need to know whether the quantifiers of the entailed\nsentences carry ontological commitment. Quine's considered view was that his criterion of ontological\ncommitment cannot be applied to theories couched in ordinary\nlanguage.  Before applying the criterion, the theory must be\nparaphrased into first-order predicate logic (without names); and\nthen, strictly speaking, it is only the first-order theory that\ncarries ontological commitment, not the ordinary language theory.\n[37] \n(The proponent of the theory can be convicted of holding the\nontological commitment if—and only if—she accepts the\nparaphrase.) For Quine, this view reflected his general approach to\nordinary language and ontology: the speakers of ordinary language,\ntypically, are not ontologically serious; it is the task of\nphilosophers, not ordinary folk, to determine which prima\nfacie commitments are genuine. There were also specific reasons\nwhy a direct application of his criterion to ordinary language might\nlead to erroneous results. For one thing, theories couched in ordinary\nlanguage containing non-extensional constructions might have\nontological commitments not revealed by quantificational structure (see §1.7.3). For another thing, quantification\nin ordinary language might fail to carry ontological commitment if it\nis not objectual, not amenable to the standard Tarskian\nmodel-theoretic semantics\n (see §1.6.2). Only the quantifiers\n of first-order logic, Quine\nheld, are guaranteed to be objectual (because we stipulate their\nsemantics); and only objectual quantification carries ontological\ncommitment.[38] On closer inspection, however, Quine is in no position to claim\nthat theories couched in ordinary language never carry\nontological commitment. In giving the truth conditions for the\nquantifiers of first-order logic, Quine explicitly makes use of\nordinary language quantifiers (see, for example, Quine 1970). Thus,\nhis claim that the first-order quantifiers are objectual, and carry\nontological commitment, can't help but carry over to the ordinary\nlanguage quantifiers from which they derive their meaning. There\nmust, then, be some portion of ordinary language that can do all the\nwork, vis-à-vis ontological commitment, that the first-order language\nwas introduced to \ndo.[39] \nThis doesn't eliminate the need to seek\nparaphrases of ordinary language theories\n(see §4.2 below). But such theories\nneed not be paraphrased into the language of first-order predicate\nlogic; it is enough if they are paraphrased into that regimented\nportion of ordinary language that can be counted on, in appropriate\ncontexts, to be ontologically serious. The problem that needs to be\naddressed by the Quinean is then: how to recognize which quantifiers,\nor which uses of quantifiers, make up this ontologically serious\nportion of ordinary language. Those who reject the Quinean approach\nto ontological commitment, on the other hand, need to argue that\nthere is no principled way to separate out those quantifiers, or uses\nof quantifiers, that carry ontological commitment in ordinary\nlanguage; or, more radically, that quantification in ordinary\nlanguage is never ontologically committing. There is a wide spectrum of views on whether ordinary language\nquantification is ontologically committing. On one end of the\nspectrum is the view that all ordinary assertive uses of the\nquantifiers ‘there is’ and ‘some’ are\nontologically committing, a view that may be dubbed\n“allism” (see Lewis 1990,\nand §1.6.4 above). On this view,\ndiscovering the ontological commitments of ordinary speakers is\neasy. In asserting that “some prime numbers are greater than\n100”, we commit ourselves to the existence of numbers; in\nasserting that “there are properties that all great leaders\nhave in common”, we commit ourselves to the existence of\nproperties. Ontological commitment cannot be avoided by paraphrasing\nthese sentences into the ontologically serious portion of our\nlanguage because these ordinary assertions are already ontologically\nserious.[40] Hofweber (2005) agrees that quantification in ordinary language is\nsometimes ontologically committing, but not always, and not when we\nquantify over abstract entities, such as numbers and properties, in\nordinary (i.e., non-philosophical) contexts. Hofweber claims that\nthere are two distinct readings of ordinary language quantifiers,\nreadings that make different contributions to truth conditions and\nperform different communicative functions. One reading, which he calls\nthe “domain conditions reading”, is tied to ontology: it\nplaces conditions on what exists in reality.  If I say\n“something fell on my head” (in a standard context), I am\nthereby committed to the existence of an object meeting the condition\n“fell on my head”. But, Hofweber argues, there is another\nreading of ordinary language quantifiers that is not tied to ontology,\nwhat he calls the “inferential role reading”. On this\nreading, the inference from F(t)\nto F(something) is trivially valid, even in cases\nwhere we do not take the term t to refer to anything in\nreality. On this reading, I can infer “there is someone whom I\nadmire” from “I admire Sherlock Holmes” without my\nquantified assertion conveying any ontological commitment. Yablo (1998) holds that the distinction between quantified\nstatements that are ontologically committing and those that are\nnot—if it can be made out at all—will rest not on\ndifferent readings of the quantifiers, but on the distinction between\nliteral and figurative uses of language. Indeed, all parties agree\nthat figurative language can fail to be ontologically committing; one\ncan assert, truly, that she has butterflies in her stomach without\nthereby being committed to the existence of butterflies. But\nfigurative language is very widespread, even in the sciences. A case\ncan be made, for example, that ordinary talk of numbers is merely a\npretense we engage in to more easily communicate facts about the\nconcrete world; and similarly for talk of other abstract entities. The\nproject of applying ontological commitment to ordinary language\ntheories, then, is none too easy: it depends upon being able to\ndemarcate language that is literal from language that is partly\nfigurative; and it depends on there being a stripped-down core of\nordinary language that, when interpreted literally, has the\nrepresentational capacity for fully describing the world. On the far end of the spectrum is the view that ordinary language\nquantifiers, by themselves, are never ontologically committing. A\nCarnapian might hold this view as a consequence of her general view\nthat ontological commitment, in a metaphysically loaded sense of the\nterm, is incoherent (see §5.1). A Meinongian\nmight hold this view on the grounds that it is only the existence\npredicate, not the quantifier, that conveys ontological\ncommitment. The Meinongian, however, is in a weak position when she\nclaims that quantification over non-existent objects fails to be\nontologically committing (see §1.6.3); for\nnon-existent objects don't differ from existent objects in their\ninstantiation of properties, or their having natures independent of\nour theorizing. Azzouni (2004), like the Meinongian, takes the\nexistence predicate to be what conveys ontological commitment; but,\nunlike the Meinongian, he denies that our talk of non-existent objects\nrequires that they have any sort of independent being. The\ntie between ontology and quantification is completely severed. All\nquantification—like Hofweber's “inference role”\nreading of the quantifier—is ontologically neutral. How do the various views along this spectrum impact the Quinean\nproject of using paraphrase to provide substitutes for ordinary\nlanguage theories that can be evaluated for ontological commitment?\nFor Quine, as already noted, there is no presumption that ordinary\nlanguage quantification is ontologically serious.  But it is crucial\nto Quine's project that some portion of ordinary language can be used\nfor ontologically serious discourse, and that when so used,\nquantification holds the key to ontological commitment. The allist\nview, although compatible with the Quinean project, will lead to\nattributions of ontological commitment wildly different from Quine's\nown. It makes ontological commitment hard to avoid, leading to\noverpopulated ontological slums; the desert landscape favored by Quine\nwill be hard to come by.  Hofweber's view is more congenial to the\nQuinean project, so long as the “domain conditions”\nreading of the quantifiers can be stipulated to be in effect. That can\nbe done, Quine seems to presuppose, merely by taking an appropriately\nserious attitude to the discourse in question. Inside the philosophy\nroom—or, better, the ontology room—that attitude is\npervasive. Outside the philosophy room, the philosopher is no less\nfree than other speakers to engage in ontologically frivolous\ndiscourse (see Quine 1960: 210). Yablo's view would be congenial to\nthe Quinean project if it were possible to make out the line between\nliteral and figurative discourse: Quine's ontologically serious\ndiscourse could then be identified with thoroughly literal discourse,\nassertively uttered. But Yablo is skeptical that any such project can\nsucceed, and sees that as dooming the Quinean approach to\nontology. Azzouni's view, of course, is outright incompatible with the\nQuinean project. It leads towards a substantially different account of\nontological commitment in which quantification plays no role (see\nAzzouni 2004: ch. 4). If criteria of ontological commitment cannot be applied directly to\nordinary language, then attributions of ontological commitment to\nphilosophers—or ordinary folk, but we will focus on\nphilosophers—cannot be made just by examining the statements or\ntheories that they accept. Those statements or theories may\nhave prima facie ontological commitments, to be sure, in\nvirtue of their quantificational or referential apparatus. But some\nmethod is needed to determine which prima facie commitments\ncount as genuine commitments. Enter here the method of\nparaphrase endorsed by Quine and his modern day\nfollowers. According to this method, we must first ask the philosopher\nto provide paraphrases of her statements into the regimented portion\nof our language, paraphrases that are acceptable by standards agreed\nto in advance. We then apply our criterion of ontological commitment\nto the regimented paraphrases. If the philosopher provides acceptable\nparaphrases that are not ontologically committed to Ks, then\nshe is acquitted of commitment to Ks. If the paraphrases she\nprovides are ontologically committed to Ks, then she is\nguilty of such commitment. If she opts out, refusing to provide\nparaphrases into the regimented portion of language, then attributions\nof ontological commitment are moot. The method of paraphrase dominated ontological discussion\nthroughout much of the twentieth century. For a detailed illustration\nof the method from its heyday, one can do no better than to turn to\nDavid and Stephanie Lewis's article “Holes” (Lewis and\nLewis 1970), a dialogue between two philosophers, a nominalist and a\nrealist about abstract objects. Suppose that the nominalist accepts\nstatements that are prima facie committed to\n(immaterial) holes, such as “there are holes in this\npiece of cheese”. To be acquitted of this prima facie\ncommitment, the nominalist seeks a paraphrase that avoids\nit—not just for this one sentence, but for ordinary discourse\nabout holes generally. To be acceptable, the paraphrases should\npreserve the truth of those statements about holes, and the validity\nof those arguments about holes, that are endorsed by ordinary\nspeakers. As a first stab, she might make use of the predicate\n‘perforated’ and paraphrase “there are holes in\nthis piece of cheese” as “the cheese is\nperforated”. This allows the nominalist to continue to\n“speak with the vulgar” without taking on a commitment to\nholes. But the predicate ‘perforated’ won't help in\nproviding paraphrases for statements that count holes, such as\n“there are seventeen holes in this piece of cheese”.\nHere the nominalist could introduce a separate predicate,\n‘n-perforated’, for each n. That,\nhowever, would violate strictures against infinitely many primitive\npredicates in the regimented language; and it wouldn't be of much\nhelp in paraphrasing numerical comparisons such as “there are\nas many holes in this piece of cheese as there are crackers on this\nplate”. In the case of discourse about holes, the nominalist\ndoes better to turn to a different strategy of paraphrase:\nontological reduction.[41] \nAn ontological reduction maintains the\nquantificational structure of the discourse, but restricts the\nunderlying domain to uncontroversial entities, in this case, material\nobjects. For example, “there are holes in this piece of\ncheese” can be taken to quantify, not over immaterial holes,\nbut over material hole-linings; talk of holes is interpreted as talk\nof the hole-linings that, intuitively, surround the holes. Problems\npersist: identity conditions for holes and hole-linings do not agree,\nmaking trouble for the paraphrasing of identity statements involving\nholes. But let us end the story here: enough has been said to\nillustrate how the method of paraphrase might used to avoid prima\nfacie ontological commitments. Avoiding ontological commitment, however, is not the only role that\nparaphrase plays in ontological disputes. The method of paraphrase has\nalso been used to bring hidden ontological commitments of ordinary\ndiscourse to the fore. One prominent example is Davidson's (1967)\nargument that action sentences are committed to an ontology of\nevents. For example, to explain the logical inference from “John\nwalked slowly” to “John walked”, we should treat the\nadverb ‘slowly’ as a description of an event over which\nthese sentences tacitly quantify. Paraphrases of action sentences into\nthe regimented portion of our language will thus be ontologically\ncommitted to events. A second well-known example is Lewis's argument\nfrom Counterfactuals that modal discourse, as he understands\nit, is committed to possible worlds:  It is uncontroversially true that things might be otherwise than\nthey are. … Ordinary language permits the paraphrase: there are\nmany ways things could have been besides the way they actually\nare. … I believe permissible paraphrases of what I believe;\ntaking the paraphrase at its face value, I therefore believe in the\nexistence of entities that might be called ‘ways things could\nhave been’. I prefer to call them ‘possible worlds’.\n(Lewis 1973: 84) In both of these cases, a version of the method of paraphrase is\nused to support, rather than avoid, commitment to controversial\nontology. The method of paraphrase provides a clear, well-defined\nstrategy—some would say the only such\nstrategy[42]—for\n determining the ontological\ncommitments of the two parties to an ontological dispute. But there\nhave been objections to the method, both early and late. Early on,\nAlston (1958) posed more or less the following dilemma (see also\nJackson 1980). Either the paraphrase and the sentence being\nparaphrased have the same truth conditions, or they do not. If they\ndo, then they cannot differ in their ontological commitments; for the\nrole of truth conditions, in part, is to specify what must exist in\norder for the sentence to be true. But then the method of paraphrase\ncannot be used to avoid ontological commitment. Suppose then that the\nparaphrase and the sentence being paraphrased do not have the same\ntruth conditions.  Then the paraphrase does nothing to support the\nclaim that the original sentence can be used without incurring\nontological commitment.  Indeed, whatever the precise relation\nbetween the paraphrase and the sentence being paraphrased, nothing\njustifies reading the ontological commitments of the original\nsentence off the paraphrase rather than the other way around (compare\nthe neo-Fregean account in §5.2). The best response on behalf of the defender of the method of\nparaphrase is to reject the assumption that the goal of paraphrase is\nto capture the truth conditions, or the ontological commitments, of\nthe original. For Quine, an acceptable paraphrase is just a sentence\nthat “serves any purposes [of the original] that seem worth\nserving” (Quine 1960: 214). A stronger notion of paraphrase is\nruled out because the truth conditions, and so the ontological\ncommitments, of sentences in ordinary language are, for the most\npart, semantically indeterminate. In applying the method of\nparaphrase, we ask the philosopher to make her ordinary language\ntheory precise through the process of regimentation, not to uncover\nthe hidden commitments of the original\ntheory.[43] If\nshe complies, then the ontological commitments of the regimented\ntheory can be attributed to her.  But there is no going back to\nassign ontological commitments to the original theory couched in\nordinary language.[44] More recent critics of the method of paraphrase see the search for\nparaphrase as fundamentally misguided. Sider (1999), for example,\nsuggests that the project of discovering the ontological commitments\nof ordinary language should proceed by searching, not for paraphrases,\nbut for underlying truths (see also Melia 1995 and Yablo 1999\nfor related critiques). Suppose some sentence in ordinary language\nthat we use in describing the world is prima facie committed\nto Ks. Nonetheless, the attitude that we take to the sentence\nmay be something weaker than believing the sentence true. In that\ncase, our use of that sentence need not commit us to Ks, even\nif all acceptable paraphrases are committed to Ks. To get at\nour commitments, we should look, not to paraphrases, but to the truths\nthat underlie the descriptive role of the sentence; our commitment is\nthe commitment of those underlying truths. Roughly, we can say that\nthe underlying truths are true propositions that would still have been\ntrue and would have been sufficient for the truth of the original\nsentence, if there had been Ks (see Sider 1999:\n332–3). To illustrate with a simple example, consider the\nsentence: “the number of moons of Jupiter is sixty-seven”.\nSuppose a philosopher uses this sentence to describe the world, but\ndoes not want to accept its prima facie commitment to\nnumbers. If, as seems plausible, the underlying truths for the\nsentence are just propositions stating what physical objects are in\nthe vicinity of Jupiter and what their motions are, then the sentence\nis ontologically committed only to those physical objects, not to\nnumbers. We may not know what these underlying truths are, or be able\nto express them in ordinary language. That matters not. For, unlike\nthe method of paraphrase, the philosopher is under no obligation to\nprovide the underlying truths in order to acquit herself of\nthe prima facie commitments. She can justify her use of\nsentences that are prima facie committed to numbers as long\nas she holds that there are underlying truths, and that the underlying\ntruths are not so committed. Although explicit discussion of ontological commitment postdates\nFrege's writings, an account of ontological commitment can be garnered\nfrom his defense of arithmetical platonism in The Foundations of\nArithmetic (Frege 1884). That account is embedded in the\nfollowing argument for the claim that numbers exist as\n“self-subsistent objects” (see Wright (1990), who calls\nthe argument “deceptively simple”). The semantic role of\nsingular terms (Frege's proper names) is to refer to\nobjects. When singular terms occur in true sentences of an appropriate\nkind­—extensional sentences generally, and identity\nsentences in particular—they cannot help but to refer; for that\nis their contribution to the truth of the sentence. Appropriate\nsentences involving numerical singular terms are sometimes true;\nwitness ‘the number of planets is nine’ and\n‘1+1=2’. Therefore, these singular terms refer to\nobjects. Moreover, the argument may be continued, since some of these\nsingular terms—those of the form ‘the number\nof Fs’—figure in the identity condition\ndefinitive of the concept of number (Hume's Principle, see below), the\nobjects referred to are properly called\n“numbers”. Therefore, numbers exist. This argument might be challenged in two different ways.  First,\none might deny that sentences containing numerical singular terms are\n(literally) true; one might, for example, endorse a fictionalist\naccount of mathematics (Field 1980). For our purposes, we can sidestep\nthis objection and focus on the other premise of the argument, that\nextensional sentences containing numerical singular terms, if true,\nrefer to numbers—which is to say, in other words, that such\nsentences, whether true or not, are ontologically committed\nto numbers. If this is to serve as a criterion of ontological\ncommitment, there must be some purely syntactic way of\ndetermining which expressions are genuine singular terms; if genuine\nsingular terms are characterized semantically—for\nexample, as expressions that refer to objects when they occur in true\nextensional sentences—then the account of ontological commitment\ngoes in a circle. Thus, Fregean accounts are committed to\na syntactic priority thesis: ontology depends on ontological\ncommitment plus truth; and ontological commitment in turn depends on\nsyntax (see Wright 1983 for extended discussion). In various scattered remarks, Frege appears to endorse the\nsyntactic priority thesis. For example, he writes (1884: §57):\n“we say ‘the [number] 1’, and by means of the\ndefinite article, set up 1 as an object”. And he notes that\nnumerals occur, not only attributively, for example, in ‘Jupiter\nhas four moons’, but also in identity statements, such as\n‘the number of Jupiter's moons is four’; and the sense of\nsuch an identity statement is just that “the expression\n‘the number of Jupiter's moons’ denotes the same object as\nthe word ‘four’”. The difficulty of identifying the\nappropriate use of the definite article, or when ‘is’\nsignals a genuine identity statement, was, perhaps, not sufficiently\nappreciated by Frege. But recent work (especially Dummett (1973) and\nHale (1996)) has given some reason to think that genuine singular\nterms in English can be recognized syntactically in terms of their\ninferential role. Suppose that the task of providing syntactic criteria for\nidentifying genuine singular terms can be accomplished. Suppose,\nmoreover, that there are syntactic criteria for saying when a genuine\nsingular term purports to refer to objects of kind K.  Then\nthe Fregean can put forth the following sufficient condition for\nontological commitment:  Fregean Account.  Suppose that t is a singular\nterm purporting to refer to objects of kind K.  Then, any\nextensional theory containing the term t is ontologically\ncommitted to Ks. Note that, unlike the criteria for ontological commitment\nconsidered heretofore, this is intended only as a sufficient\ncondition for ontological commitment. For one thing, just as Frege\ntook singular terms to be a vehicle for commitment\nto objects, he took incomplete expressions to be a vehicle of\ncommitment to concepts and (more\ngenerally) functions. Unlike Quine, Frege treated all\nmeaningful expressions on a par with respect to ontological\ncommitment. But even if we restrict our attention to ontological\ncommitment to objects, there is no reason to think that Frege's\ncriterion is necessary as well as sufficient. Frege could well have\nallowed existentially quantified sentences to be ontologically\ncommitted to objects, whether or not they were equivalent to\ndisjunctions of sentences containing singular terms. In one important respect, Frege's approach to ontological\ncommitment is in agreement with Quine's. Both hold that the smallest\nunit of ontological commitment is the complete sentence.  For Frege,\nthis can be seen as an uncontroversial application of his\nfamous Context Principle: “it is only in the context of\na proposition that words have any meaning” (Frege 1884:\n§62). It follows that attribution of ontological commitment to\npersons always goes by way of the theories (sentences) that they\naccept. This approach to ontological commitment is common to all\nmainstream views in contemporary analytic philosophy. It could be\ndenied, however, by a philosopher who holds that we stand in\nintentional relations, not only to propositions, but also to\nobjects. For such a philosopher, plausibly, a person is ontologically\ncommitted to the objects of her thought, and the kinds they exemplify,\nindependently of what propositions she takes to be true of those\nobjects, or even whether there are any such propositions. The Fregean approach to ontological commitment differs from\northodox Quinean approaches most obviously in its emphasis on singular\nterms as opposed to quantifiers and variables. But this may reflect\nmore a difference in their accounts of singular terms than a\nsubstantial difference in their accounts of ontological commitment;\nboth approaches, after all, focus on the referential\napparatus of the language. Quine eliminated all singular\nterms prior to assessing ontological commitment: definite\ndescriptions were eliminated via Russell's theory of descriptions;\nnames were eliminated in favor of predicates satisfied by at most one\nthing.  This allowed Quine to sidestep issues arising from ostensibly\nempty names (see §1.2 above). Frege, on\nthe other hand, took singular terms to be the locus of commitment to\nobjects. In Frege 1892, he writes: “when we say ‘the\nmoon’ … we presuppose a reference”. Singular terms,\nthen, are ontologically committing in this sense: they presuppose\nreference to objects. This applies no less to empty names that in fact\nfail to refer. Frege writes:\n  anyone who seriously took the sentence\n[“Odysseus …”] to be true or false would ascribe to\nthe name “Odysseus” a reference.\n This has a couple of awkward consequences. For one, it follows that\ndenials of existence cannot be made with empty names: “Odysseus\nnever existed” is neither true nor false. But perhaps these\ndenials won't much be missed, since we can always say instead that the\nname ‘Odysseus’ doesn't refer. For another, sentences with\nfictional names are always ontologically committing. But, ultimately,\nit is the ontological commitment of persons that we care about, not\nsentences. A person may use a sentence containing a singular\nterm—for example, an actor on the stage—without inheriting\nthe sentence's ontological commitments. Only when a person judges the\nsentence to be true is she committed to an object as referent of the\nsingular term, and to the kinds of entity to which the object\nbelongs. Another difference between Frege and Quine (but not all Quineans)\nis that Frege's account of ontological commitment applies directly to\nsentences of ordinary language. Quine's account applies only\nindirectly to sentences of ordinary language via the method of\nparaphrase, or, in what seems to be his “official” view,\nnot at all. This difference leads to different, and more onerous,\ndemands being placed on the Fregean. As already noted, the Fregean\nmust discover syntactic criteria for identifying genuine singular\nterms in ordinary language. Quine never engaged in the corresponding\nproject: finding syntactic criteria for identifying objectual\nquantifiers in ordinary language. As we saw\nin §4.2, that task is none too easy, and\nthere is substantial disagreement even over basic\ncases. But, contra Quine, it is a task that must be carried\nout if quantifier approaches to ontological commitment are to have\nphilosophical application.  Philosophers, after all, do not often\nspeak or write in Quine's target language: first-order predicate\nlogic. Quinean approaches—if they are to provide a\ntheory-neutral criterion of ontological commitment applicable to\nordinary language—are no less beholden to the syntactic priority\nthesis than Fregean approaches. Thus far, we have canvassed Frege's argument that, if sentences\ncontaining numerical singular terms are true, then those terms refer\nto numbers. The last step in the argument—that the objects\nreferred to by numerical singular terms satisfy the sortal concept of\nnumber—invoked the following identity criterion for numbers: Hume's Principle. The number of Fs is identical\nwith the number of Gs if and only if there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the Fs and the Gs.  Frege considered, but rejected, the idea that Hume's Principle, by\nitself, could be taken to define the concept of number. His rejection\nwas based on what has come to be known as the “Caesar\nProblem”: Hume's Principle allows one to decide whether the\nnumber of Fs is identical with q, when q is\ngiven in the form ‘the number of Gs’, but it\nfails to do so when q is not given in that form. Thus, Frege\n(1884: §56) requires that we be able to\n  decide by means of our definitions whether any\nconcept has the number Julius Caesar belonging to it, or whether that\nsame familiar conqueror of Gaul is a number or not.\n  Frege thus opted instead to define numbers explicitly in terms of\nextensions: the number of Fs = the extension of the concept\n‘equal to the concept F’ (where F is equal to\nG just in case the Fs are in one-to-one correspondence\nwith the Gs). These explicit definitions arguably allow Frege\nto maintain the logicist thesis that arithmetic is logic: they define\nnumbers as logical objects in the sense that their existence\ncan be justified on the basis of (Frege's) logic alone. But, as is\nwell known, these explicit definitions foundered on the inconsistency\nof Frege's underlying theory of extensions, in particular, the naïve\ncomprehension principle embodied in his Basic Law V. The Neo-Fregean seeks to defend arithmetical platonism and\nlogicism by taking a different tack: Hume's Principle by itself is\ntaken to provide a contextual definition of numbers.  The viability of\nthis approach is secured by the result now called Frege's\nTheorem: Hume's Principle, when added to a suitable system of\nsecond-order logic, suffices for the proof of the basic laws of\narithmetic, Peano's axioms (see Wright 1983:\n158–69). Arithmetical logicism is secured if Hume's Principle\ncan be shown to be analytic in an appropriate sense. Arithmetical\nplatonism, with numbers as logical objects, is secured because, when\nlogical truths are substituted for the right-hand side of Hume's\nPrinciple, the resulting instance on the left-hand side is also\nlogically true, and explicitly refers to numbers. For our purposes, the main interest of the Neo-Fregean approach is\nthat it leads to a conception of ontological commitment more liberal\nthan any yet considered. This conception arises from the\nNeo-Fregean's particular way of understanding Hume's\nPrinciple. First, since Hume's Principle is to define the\nconcept of number, the left- and right-hand sides of the principle\nmust at least have the same truth conditions.  Second, sentences with\nthe same truth conditions have the same ontological commitments. This\nsecond assumption amounts to a sense in which being supervenes on\ntruth: circumstances cannot differ with respect to what there is\nwithout differing with respect to what is true. It follows from these\ntwo assumptions that the left- and right-hand sides of Hume's\nPrinciple have the same ontological commitments. But that still\nleaves open three different ways that Hume's Principle can be viewed\n(Wright 1990). First, one might reject it on the grounds\nthat the left- and right-hand sides clearly do not have the same\nontological commitments: the numerical identity on the left-hand side\nis committed to numbers; the claim that two concepts are equal on the\nright-hand side is not. On this view, only a conditionalized version\nof Hume's Principle could be accepted: “if there are numbers,\nthen …” (Field 1984). In response, the neo-Fregean can\nsay that this confuses “having the same truth conditions”\nwith some more fine-grained equivalence such as “expressing the\nsame thought”. Only the latter requires that both sides refer\nto the same objects, where reference is a kind of explicit\nontological commitment.[45] A second response takes Hume's Principle to provide\nan ontological reduction of numbers to concepts, and\nrelations between concepts. On this view, Hume's Principle is true,\nbut ontological commitments should be read off of the right-hand\nside. Since the right-hand side, it is supposed, is not ontologically\ncommitted to numbers, the left-hand side—being\ntruth-conditionally equivalent—cannot be ontologically committed\nto numbers either; surface grammar is deceptive here. This response is\nin line with the standard Quinean approach to paraphrase as a means of\neliminating ontological commitment.  But, as noted\nin §4.2, it is unclear what justifies\nthe asymmetric attitude with respect to commitment. Granted, there is\nno explicit ontological commitment to numbers by the\nright-hand side; but once one allows that ontological commitment can\nbe implicit, it is unclear why one cannot say that it is the surface\ngrammar of the right-hand side that is deceptive with respect\nto ontological commitment. The third response, that of the Neo-Fregean, is to say that\nontological commitments should be read off of the left-hand side, and\nthat therefore both sides are ontologically committed to numbers.\nThis is no idle preference. It is backed up by the Fregean argument\nconsidered above that the left-hand side is ontologically committed to\nnumbers in virtue of containing numerical singular terms. The symmetry\nis broken. The neo-Fregean thus endorses a sufficient condition for\nontological commitment much weaker than the Fregean account: Neo-Fregean Account.  Suppose that t is a\nsingular term purporting to refer to objects of kind K.  Then\nany theory truth-conditionally equivalent to a theory containing the\nterm t is ontologically committed\nto Ks. To illustrate: “there are exactly as many forks as\nknives” is ontologically committed to numbers because it is\ntruth-conditionally equivalent to “the number of forks is\nidentical with the number of knives”, which contains a singular\nterm ‘the number of forks’ which purports to refer to\nnumbers. The liberality of the neo-Fregean account of ontological commitment\nis best appreciated by considering its application to abstraction\nprinciples for which, unlike Hume's Principle, the right-hand side\nappears to be entirely about concrete entities, and so appears to be\nacceptable to a nominalist. For example, consider the abstraction\nprinciple for directions: the direction of line a is\nidentical to the direction of line b if and only\nif a is parallel to b (where a\nand b are concrete). According to the neo-Fregean account,\nthe claim that concrete lines a and b are parallel\nis committed, by itself, to abstract objects,\ndirections.[46]\nMoreover, it has this commitment whether or not any mind ever grasps\nthe concept of direction, or formulates the corresponding abstraction\nprinciple. In general, commitments to abstracta are\nconcomitant with certain commitments to concreta, and\ninseparable from them, regardless of our ways of\nconceptualizing.[47] Carnap was a deflationist about traditional ontological disputes,\nsuch as whether numbers exist, or physical objects exist. He held that\nexistence questions could be interpreted in two different ways,\ninternally or externally. When interpreted internally, the question\nwas to be answered relative to a linguistic framework.  If the\nframework was mathematical, existence questions, such as whether there\nare prime numbers greater than 1000, were to be answered by means of\nproof, given the axioms and rules of logic introduced by the\nframework. If the framework was empirical, existence questions, such\nas whether electrons exist, were to be answered through observation\naccording to the rules of confirmation and disconfirmation introduced\nby the framework. When the existence questions involved the most\ngeneral kinds introduced by the framework, the answers were\ntrivial. In the framework of numbers, it is trivial that numbers\nexist; in the framework of physical objects, it is trivial that\nphysical objects exist. For it is stipulated in introducing these\nframeworks that the variables range over numbers, or physical\nobjects. When existence questions are interpreted externally, they purport\nto be about “reality” independent of any particular\nlinguistic framework. So interpreted, according to Carnap, these\nquestions—such as “do numbers exist?” or “do\nphysical objects exist?”—are pseudo-questions lacking any\ncognitive meaning. Since metaphysicians engaging in ontological\ndisputes over these questions evidently have the external\ninterpretation in mind—they do not take them to be\ntrivial—much of traditional metaphysics for Carnap was\ncognitively meaningless as well. The best one can do to make sense of\nexternal existence questions is to re-construe them as pragmatic\nquestions as to which frameworks to accept. The question, “do\nnumbers exist”, for example, could be re-construed as the\nquestion, “is it useful to introduce the number\nframework”. A framework could be deemed useful, for example, if\nit facilitated factual communication in ways that were\n“efficient, fruitful, and simple” (Carnap 1950). One might wonder whether it is coherent to interpret all meaningful\nexistence questions as internal: don't we need the concept of\nexistence to introduce and meaningfully discuss the frameworks\nthemselves, and their pragmatic virtues? Can it be frameworks\n“all the way down”? But, for purposes of this article, it\nsuffices to ask how the notion of ontological commitment fits in to\nCarnap's scheme. One might expect Carnap to tie talk of ontological\ncommitment to external questions, and reject it accordingly: if it is\ncognitively meaningless to say that Ks exist in\nreality, then it is cognitively meaningless to say that a theory\npresupposes or assumes that Ks exist in reality.  But that\nis not what Carnap did. Rather, he endorsed Quine's quantifier\naccount of ontological commitment, applying it internally; his only\nreservation had to do with Quine's use of the word\n‘ontological’.[48] \nFor Carnap, a theory always comes\npackaged with a linguistic framework for interpreting the theory. To\nsay that a theory is ontologically committed to Ks, then, is\njust to say that according to the rules of the framework-cum-theory,\nit is true that Ks exist. A philosopher can be said to\n“accept a kind of entities” when he introduces a\nlinguistic framework that, first, introduces a general term satisfied\nby all and only entities of that kind and, second, introduces\nvariables to range over all and only those entities (see Carnap 1950:\n213). How do Carnap's views relate to Quine's? First, it might well be\nasked, which of the quantifier accounts canvassed above is Carnap\nendorsing when he claims to be in agreement with Quine?  Since Carnap\nclearly allows a philosopher who has not accepted (for\npragmatic reasons) some kind of entity to attribute acceptance of that\nkind to another philosopher, Carnap's view would appear to be closest\nto the metalinguistic version of Quine's quantifier account. We are\nmaking claims about linguistic frameworks, and what follows from the\nrules of those frameworks; and these claims, at least for Carnap, do\nnot make problematic assertions about “reality”. Second, a\nconsequence of Carnap's view is that theories with different\nontological commitments should not be thought of as conflicting. This\ncontrasts sharply with Quine. Because Quine has a single, all-purpose\nlogico-linguistic framework—austere first-order predicate\nlogic—within which all theories are couched for purposes of\nexamining their ontological commitments, theories with differing\nexistential presuppositions genuinely conflict; a philosopher must\nchoose which theory to accept. For Carnap, theories with differing\nontological commitments are ipso facto couched within\ndifferent linguistic frameworks. If there is disagreement, it can only\nbe over the relative pragmatic virtues of the frameworks in\nquestion. In this way, Carnap's deflationary approach to ontology\ncarries with it a deflationary approach to ontological\ncommitment. Carnap is a pluralist; a philosopher can choose\nto accept multiple theories, with differing ontological commitments,\nwithout pain of contradiction. Let many flowers bloom (see Carnap\n1950: 221). According to Carnap, each linguistic framework comes with its own\nunrestricted existential quantifier, and thus its own notions of\nobject and existence. No one of these quantifiers is logically or\nmetaphysically privileged over any of the others; there is no neutral\nstandpoint from which one framework can be judged correct and another\nincorrect. When frameworks appear to disagree—as when one says\nthat arbitrary fusions exist, and another denies it—the dispute\nis merely verbal; they are using quantifiers with different\nmeanings. This is a form of the doctrine of quantifier\nvariance. One might well wonder: don't we get a single,\nprivileged quantifier by combining all linguistic frameworks, and\nconsidering a quantifier that ranges over the union of all the domains\nof these frameworks? But the question presupposes, in effect, that the\nnotion of “all linguistic frameworks” is meaningful, and\nthere is no reason why Carnap would accept that. Any attempt to\nintroduce a single all-inclusive quantifier that ranges over\nabsolutely everything would be rejected by Carnap. For what does\neverything mean here, if not “everything in reality?\nAnd that, for Carnap, is cognitively meaningless. Eli Hirsch (2002) is a neo-Carnapian proponent of the doctrine of\nquantifier variance, but he differs from Carnap in at least two\nrespects (see also Putnam 1987). First, Hirsch applies the doctrine of\nquantifier variance not just to the quantifiers in artificial\nlanguages, as was Carnap's way, but to ordinary language\nquantifiers. Instead of Carnap's many linguistic frameworks, we have\nmany possible languages including English and (Hirsch would say) the\nsomewhat bizarre variations on English spoken by some contemporary\nmetaphysicians. For example, Lewish, the language spoken by\nmereologists (and named after its defender, David Lewis) quantifies\nover arbitrary fusions, whereas English, Hirsch claims, does\nnot. Second, Hirsch's brand of quantifier variance is meant to be\ncompatible with realism, that there is a single reality in virtue of\nwhich our theories, with their various quantifiers, are made true or\nfalse. This reality cannot, in and of itself, be ontologically\nstructured; it cannot have a metaphysically privileged division into\nobjects, lest one quantifier be privileged over the others. Reality\nconsists rather of unstructured facts that we carve up differently\nwith our different quantifiers. Hirsch's realism contrasts sharply with Carnap's anti-realism. For\nCarnap, different linguistic frameworks are incommensurable. They\npeacefully coexist, logically isolated from one another. Apparent\nontological disputes are meaningless for lack of a common subject\nmatter, a single “reality” that is being disputed. For\nHirsch, on the other hand, each side in an ontological dispute is\nspeaking truly of the one and only reality. The appearance of a\ngenuine dispute arises because they are speaking different languages\nwhose quantifiers have different meanings. Each side of the dispute\ncan translate the others claims into his own language to see that both\nare speaking truly, and that the dispute is merely verbal. The\ndisagreement is over the meaning of words, not the nature of\nreality. This claim of intertranslatability is difficult to maintain (see\nHawthorne 2009). But suppose it can be made good: what would that say\nabout ontological commitment? Since theories that assert “there\nare Ks” and theories that assert “there are\nno Ks” need not conflict, one cannot simply look to the\nquantifiers for ontological commitment. Moreover, since no language,\nand no quantifier, is ontologically privileged, it would not help to\nfirst translate into a single language. We could relativize the notion\nof ontological commitment to languages; but given that reality itself,\nfor Hirsch, isn't ontologically structured, none of these relativized\nnotions of ontological commitment would be getting at something of\nontological significance (including the one that gave ontological\ncommitment relative to ordinary language, and ordinary language\nquantifiers). All theories, it appears, are ontologically committed to\nthe single reality, and the unstructured facts that comprise it; but\nthat commitment does not come from quantification. Where it comes from\nis not addressed.","contact.mail":"bricker@philos.umass.edu","contact.domain":"philos.umass.edu"}]
