Here evidentialism is the\ninitially plausible position that a belief is justified only if\n“it is proportioned to the evidence”. For example, suppose\na local weather forecaster has noticed that over the two hundred years\nsince records began a wetter than average Winter is followed in 85% of\ncases by a hotter than average Summer. Then, assuming for simplicity\nthat the records are reliable, the forecaster is justified in  believing\nwith less than full confidence that this Winter, which is wetter than\naverage, will be followed by a hotter than average Summer. But\nevidentialism implies that it would not be justified to have full\nbelief, that is belief with 100% confidence. Again, consider someone\nwho has a hunch that this Summer will be hotter than average\nbut cannot justify that hunch further. Hunches are not considered\nevidence, so the belief is not considered justified. If, however, the\nhuncher can cite a good track record of hunches about the weather that\nhave turned out correct then the belief would be considered\njustified. For although hunches are not considered evidence, memories\nabout past hunches are, as are the observations that corroborated the\npast hunches.\n\n Evidentialism implies that full religious belief is justified only\nif there is conclusive evidence for it. It follows that if the\narguments for there being a God, including any arguments from\nreligious experience, are at best probable ones, no one would be\njustified in having a full belief that there is a God. And the same\nholds for other religious beliefs, such as the belief that God is not\njust good in a utilitarian fashion but loving, or the belief that\nthere is an afterlife.  Likewise it would be unjustified to believe\neven with less than full confidence that, say, Krishna is divine or\nthat Mohammed is the last and most authoritative of the prophets,\nunless a good case can be made for these claims from the evidence.\n\n Evidentialism, then, sets rather high standards for justification,\nstandards that the majority do not, it would seem, meet when it comes\nto religious beliefs, where many rely on “faith”, which is\nmore like the forecaster’s hunch about the weather than the argument\nfrom past climate records. Many others take some body of scripture,\nsuch as the Bible or the Koran as of special authority, contrary to\nthe evidentialist treatment of these as just like any other\nbooks making various claims.  Are these standards too high?\n\n This century has seen a turn in the debate, with emphasis on the\nimplications of disagreement, “How can sincere intelligent\npeople disagree? Should not we all suspend judgement?”\n\n\n\nEpistemology is confusing because there are several sorts of items to\nbe evaluated and several sorts of evaluation. Since the topic of this\narticle is the epistemology of religion not general epistemology it\nwill be assumed that what is being evaluated is something related to\nfaith, namely individual religious beliefs, and that the way of\nevaluating religious beliefs is as justified or unjustified. This entry, therefore, concentrates on questions such as, “Is\nit justified for Fatima to believe in God?”, “Is it\njustified for Richard to believe in the Trinity?”, or “Is\nit justified for Ramanujan to believe that Krishna is a human\nincarnation of the divine?” It ignores such questions as whether\nthese beliefs count as knowledge or whether these beliefs are\nscientific. It also ignores disputes between coherence theorists and\nfoundationalists and disputes over whether belief is\nvoluntary. Although these have some implications for the epistemology\nof religion they are primarily topics in general epistemology. Although the topic is religious belief the same questions can be\nasked about faith in the absence of belief, where the standards might\nbe laxer. For example John Schellenberg (2009) has argued that it is\nnot justified to believe in a personal God, not justified to have\nfaith in a personal God , not justified even to believe in something\nultimate but it is justified to have a religious attitude of faith in\nsomething ultimate.  Finally, and more controversially, this entry\nconcentrates on Western epistemology of religion, which is not,\nhowever, the same as the epistemology of Western religion. Note,\nthough, that epistemological disputes between Hindu and Buddhist\nphilosophers over a thousand years ago are much the same as those here\nconsidered. \n\nMost contemporary epistemology of religion may be called post\nmodern in the sense of being a reaction to the Enlightenment, in\nparticular to the thesis of the hegemony of\nevidentialism. (Compare Vanhoozer 2003.)  Hegemony is discussed below,\nbut first consider evidentialism. This is the initially plausible\nposition that a belief is justified only if “it is proportioned\nto the evidence”. (Beliefs proportioned to the evidence include,\nas a special case, the evidence itself.) Here several sorts of\nevidence are allowed. One consists of beliefs in that which is\n“evident to the senses”, that is, beliefs directly due to\nsense-experience. Another sort of evidence is that which is\n“self-evident”, that is, obvious once you think about\nit. Evidence may also include the beliefs directly due to memory and\nintrospection. Again moral convictions might count as evidence, even\nif not treated as “self-evident”. But in order to state\nthe sort of evidentialism characteristic of Enlightenment thought, it\nis stipulated that no beliefs asserting the content of religious or\nmystical experiences count as evidence.  For example, if Fatima had an\nexperience that she would describe as of the presence of God she\nshould not treat God’s presence to her as a piece of evidence.  That\ndoes not prevent the claim that someone has had a religious experience\nwith a certain content from counting as evidence. For example, the\nfact that Fatima had an experience as if of God’s presence would be a\npiece of evidence.  Likewise the fact that various people report\nmiracles counts as evidence. \n\nEvidentialism implies that no full religious belief (i.e., a religious\nbelief held with full confidence) is justified unless there is\nconclusive evidence for it, or it is self-evident. The content of\nreligious experience has been stipulated not to count as\nevidence. Even if, as Descartes held, the existence of God is \nself-evident, beliefs such as Richard’s in the Trinity and Ramanujan’s\nin the divinity of Krishna are not. So the only available\nevidence for these beliefs would seem to be non-religious premises,\nfrom which the religious beliefs are inferred. Therefore, the only way\nof deciding whether the religious beliefs are justified would be to\nexamine various arguments with the non-religious beliefs as premises\nand the religious beliefs as conclusions. \n\nAccording to evidentialism it follows that if the arguments for there\nbeing a God, including any arguments from religious experience, are at\nbest probable ones, and if, as most hold, God’s existence is not\nself-evident then no one would be justified in having full belief that\nthere is a God. And the same holds for other religious\nbeliefs. Likewise, it would not be justified to believe even partially\n(i.e., with less than full confidence) if there is not a balance of\nevidence for belief. \n\nIn fact it seems that many religious believers combine full belief\nwith “doubts” in the sense of some reasons for doubting,\nor they combine partial belief with what they take to be weighty\nreasons for disbelief. According to evidentialism this is not\njustified. Other believers consider that, on reflection, they have\nlittle reason for doubting but that they have almost no positive\nevidence for their religious beliefs. According to evidentialism this\ntoo is unjustified.  This raises the question, how can we adjudicate\nbetween an epistemological thesis which might otherwise be believed\nand a religious belief which that thesis implies is unjustified?  The\nEnlightenment assumed two related, hegemony theses,  those of epistemology and of evidentialism. The hegemony of epistemology states that   (a) human beings can discover the correct epistemology in isolation from discovering actual human tendencies to form beliefs, and so (b) there is an overriding reason to use the correct epistemology (once discovered)  to correct the above-mentioned tendencies.  The hegemony of evidentialism adds to the hegemony of epistemology the further thesis that (c) evidentialism is the correct epistemology. If, according to evidentialism, full or even partial religious beliefs are unjustified, then, given the hegemony of\nevidentialism  there is an overriding reason to reject those beliefs.\nPerhaps the clearest exponent of this position is the comparatively\nrecent Clifford whose use of moral vocabulary conveys well the\noverriding character of the reasons epistemology is said to provide.\nHis position is summed up in the famous quotation: “It is wrong\nalways, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon\ninsufficient evidence” (Clifford 1879: 186). \n\nAt the other extreme from Clifford is the position of\nfideism, namely, that if an epistemological theory such as\nevidentialism conflicts with the holding of religious beliefs\nthen that is so much the worse for the epistemological theory. \n\nThe rejection of the hegemony of epistemology is quite compatible\nwith holding a hegemony thesis for a fragment of epistemology. Such a\nfragment might, for instance, contain the principle of\nself-referential consistency, relied upon by Plantinga (1983:\n60). This states that it is not justified to have a belief according\nto which that belief is itself not justified. Consider, for instance,\nthe extreme case of the person who believes that no belief is\njustified unless it can be proven from premises everyone agrees\nupon.  \n\nPostmodernism implies more than being post modern in the above sense.\nFor it is the rejection of the hegemony of even a fragment of\nepistemology. That might seem agreeable to fideists.  Postmodernism\ntends, however, to trivialize fideism by obliterating any contrast\nbetween faith in divine revelation and trust in human capacities to\ndiscover the truth. (For a discussion of fideism and postmodernism see\nStiver 2003.)  \n\nMuch contemporary epistemology of religion seeks to avoid the\nextremes both of the Enlightenment thesis of the hegemony of evidentialism and of fideism. It is\nthus post modern without necessarily being postmodernist. Call\nthe injunction to avoid these extremes the problematic of\ncontemporary epistemology of religion. \n\nOne response to the problematic is to separate evidentialism from the\nhegemony of epistemology. Evidentialism may then be defended by noting\nhow we implicitly rely upon evidentialist principles in many different\nareas of enquiry, or by noting which principles generalise various\nparticular examples of justified  and unjustified\nreasoning.  Such a defence of evidentialism is part of\nthe project of some contemporary philosophers who seek to attack\ntheism in favour of agnosticism and/or atheism. This defence may well\nbe implicit in Flew’s famous “The Presumption of Atheism”\n(1972). It is more explicit in Scriven’s\nPrimary Philosophy (1966, ch 4). Scriven and Flew are relying\non the Ockhamist principle that, in the absence of evidence for the\nexistence of things of kind X, belief in Xs is\nnot reasonable.  This they can defend by means of examples in which\nnon-Ockhamist thinking is judged not to be justified. So even if the\nwhole of evidentialism is not defended, the Ockhamist fragment of it\nmay be. \n\nNot surprisingly the reliance of non-theist philosophers on\nevidentialism has been criticised. First there is an ad hominem.\nShalkowski (1989) has pointed out that these defenders of\nevidentialism tend in fact to be atheists not agnostics, yet a careful\nexamination, he says, of the examples used to support Ockham’s Razor\nshow that either they are ones in which there is independent evidence\nfor denying the existence of Xs or ones in which suspense of\njudgement seems to be the appropriate response, not denial. Another\ncriticism is Plantinga’s claim that evidentialism is\nself-referentially inconsistent for there is no evidence for\nevidentialism (Plantinga 1983: 60). This might be met in either of two\nways. First, it could be said that all that is being defended is the\nOckhamist fragment of evidentialism and that this is not itself\nvulnerable to Ockham’s Razor. Or it could be argued that deriving an\nepistemology from a wide range of examples is evidence for it. To be\nsure this is far from conclusive evidence. But even a less than full\nbelief in an epistemological thesis which showed theism to be\nunjustified would be damaging. This may be illustrated using an\nexample with artificial numerical precision: 80% confidence in an\nepistemology which showed that no degree of belief in theism greater\nthan 60% was justified is incompatible with a degree of belief\nin theism greater than 68%.  The person in question could have a degree of belief of in the\nconjunction of theism and the (80% likely) epistemology of no greater\nthan 48% (80% of 60%) and a degree of belief in the conjunction of\ntheism and the denial of that epistemology of no greater than 20%\n(since that epistemology has a probability of 80%).\n \n\nTheistic philosophers may, of course, grant evidentialism and even\ngrant its hegemony, but defend theism by providing the case which\nevidentialists demand. Here the details of the arguments are not\nwithin the scope of an article on epistemology. What is of interest is\nthe kind of argument put forward. For a start there is the\nproject of demonstrating God’s existence, and this project is\nnot restricted to neo-Thomists. (See Craig 1979, Braine 1988, Miller\n1991.) To show the justifiability of full belief that there is a God\nit is sufficient (a) to have a deductively valid argument from\npremisses which are themselves justifiably held with full belief\nunless defeated by an objection and (b) to have considered and\ndefeated all available objections to either the premisses, the\nconclusion or any intermediate steps. Some of the premisses of these\narguments are said to be self-evident, that is, obvious once you think\nabout it. (E.g., the denial of the explanatory power of an infinite\ncausal regress, or the principle that the existence of any composite\nthing needs to be explained). And that raises a further\nepistemological problem. Does something’s being self-evident to you\njustify your full belief in it even if you know of those of equal or\ngreater intellectual ability to whom it is not self-evident? \n\nMany natural theologians have, however, abandoned the search for\ndemonstrative arguments, appealing instead to ones which are probable,\neither in the sense of having weight but being inconclusive or in the\nsense of having a mathematical probability assigned to them. Notable\nin this regard are Mitchell’s cumulative argument (Mitchell 1973) and\nSwinburne’s Bayesian reliance on probability (Swinburne 1979). In a\npopular exposition of his argument Swinburne appeals instead to an\ninference to the best explanation (Swinburne 1995; see also Forrest\n1996). While there are differences of approach, the common theme is\nthat there is evidence for theism but evidence of a probable rather\nthan a conclusive kind, justifying belief but not full belief. \n\nAlthough pre-dating the current debate, John Henry Newman’s rejection of Locke’s\nand Paley’s evidentialism is relevant to the problematic of\ncontemporary epistemology of religion. First he quite clearly rejected\nthe hegemony of epistemology. His procedure was to examine how in fact\npeople made up their minds on non-religious issues and argue that by\nthe same standards religious beliefs were justified. As a result he\nqualified evidentialism by insisting that an implicit and\ncumulative argument could lead to justified certainty. (See\nMitchell 1990.)  \n\nNewman’s position has two interpretations. One, which differs little\nfrom Swinburne’s probabilistic approach to natural theology, asserts\nthat the consilience of a number of independent pieces of probable\nreasoning can result in a probability so high as to be negligibly\ndifferent from certainty. If, to use an example Newman would not have\nliked, Aquinas’s five ways were independent and each had probability\n75% then taken together their probability is about 99.9%. One\ndifficulty with this interpretation is that even a highly probable\nargument differs from a demonstration in that the former is vulnerable\nto probabilistic counter-arguments. Thus a probabilistic version of\nthe Argument from Evil might subsequently reduce the probability from\n99.9% down to 75% again. \n\nThe other interpretation of Newman’s position is to say that\nevidentialism falsely presupposes that there are fine gradations on a\nscale from full belief through partial belief to partial disbelief to\nfull disbelief. Newman claims that human beings are not like that when\nit comes to those beliefs which form part of religious faith. In such\ncases the only available states are those of full belief and full\ndisbelief or, perhaps, full belief, and lack of full belief. Of course\nsomeone can believe that theism has a probability between 90% and 60%,\nsay, but that could be interpreted as believing that relative to the\nevidence theism has a probability between 90% and 60%, which, in turn,\nis a comment on the strength of the case for theism not the expression\nof a merely partial belief. \n\nIf Newman is right then evidentialism is slightly wrong. Instead of\nrequiring belief to be proportioned to the evidence, full belief is\njustified if the case for it holds “on the balance of\nprobabilities”.  Hence a natural theology consisting of merely\nprobable arguments, such as Swinburne’s, can still show full religious\nbelief to be justified. \n\nAnother reaction to the problematic is Wittgensteinian fideism, the\nthesis that there are various different “language games”,\nand that while it is appropriate to ask questions about justification\nwithin a language game it is a mistake to ask about the justification\nof “playing” the game in question. In this way\nepistemology is relativised to language games, themselves related to\nforms of life, and the one used for assessing religious claims is less\nstringent than evidentialism. Here there seems to be both an autonomy\nthesis and an incommensurability thesis. The autonomy thesis tells us\nthat religious utterances are only to be judged as justified or\notherwise by the standards implicit in the religious form of life, and\nthis may be further restricted to Christianity or Hinduism, or any\nother religion (Malcolm 1992). The incommensurability thesis tells us\nthat religious utterances are unlike scientific or metaphysical claims\nand so we are confusing different uses of language if we judge\nreligious utterances by the standards of science or metaphysics\n(Phillips 1992). Stress on the autonomy thesis brings Wittgensteinian\nfideism close to the fideism of many religious conservatives, but\nstress on the incommensurability thesis brings it close to the extreme\nliberal position of Braithwaite (1955), namely that religion is about\nattitudes not facts, which would, of course, be rejected by religious\nconservatives. \n\nPerhaps the most obvious criticism of Wittgensteinian fideism is that\neven if the underlying theory of forms of life and language games is\ngranted, it is an historical fact, itself justified by the criteria of\nthe “game” of history, that the tradition to which the\nmajority of Jews, Christians and Muslims belong to is a form of life\nwith heavy metaphysical commitments, and in which such utterances as\n“There is a God” are intended as much like “There is\na star ten times more massive than the Sun” as like “There\nis hope”. So Wittgensteinian fideism is only appropriate for\nsuch religions as Zen Buddhism and for some, relatively recent,\nliberal strands of Judaism and Christianity which have rejected the\ntraditional metaphysical commitment (as in Cupitt 1984). \nThe Wittgensteinian position could be modified to allow a metaphysical\n“language game” with its own criteria for justification\netc, and in which natural theology should be pursued. Then the\nJudeo-Christian-Islamic “language game” would be part of\nthis larger, autonomous metaphysical “language game”. That\nmodified account would cohere with the historical fact of the\nmetaphysical commitment of that religious tradition. In that case,\nthough, it would seem that, not just the Judeo-Christian-Islamic\n“language game”, but all serious intellectual enquiry\nshould also be treated as parts of the one “game”, with\none set of rules. Thus Wittgensteinian fideism would have been\nqualified out of existence. \n\nEven if you reject Wittgensteinian fideism you might still take a lesson\nfrom it. For it must surely be granted that religious utterances are\nnot made in a purely intellectual way. Their entanglement with\ncommitment to a way of life and their emotional charge might help to\nexplain the fact, if it is one, that those who take religion\nseriously, whether believers or not, do not in fact have a continuous\nrange of degrees of confidence but operate instead with full belief or\nfull disbelief. For, normally, emotionally charged beliefs are either\nfull on or full off, and in abnormal cases tend to be divided rather\nthan partial. Thus, confronted with conflicting evidence about whether\nyour affection is reciprocated you are far less likely to suspend\njudgement than to oscillate between full belief and full\ndisbelief. Likewise it seems more normal to oscillate between full\nbelief in God in moments of crisis and full disbelief when things go\nwell than to suspend judgement at all times. This ties in with the\nNewmanian modification of evidentialism, mentioned above. \n\nAn influential contemporary rejection of evidentialism is reformed\nepistemology, due to Wolterstorff (1976) and Plantinga (1983). As\nPlantinga develops it in his paper (1983), beliefs are warranted\nwithout Enlightenment-approved evidence provided they are (a)\ngrounded, and (b) defended against known objections. Such beliefs may\nthen themselves be used as evidence for other beliefs. But what\ngrounding amounts to could be debated. Later, Plantinga \nproposed an account of warrant as proper functioning. This account\nseems to entail that S’s belief that p is grounded\nin event E if (a) in the circumstances E\ncaused S to believe that p, and (b) S’s\ncoming to believe that p was a case of proper functioning\n(Plantinga 1993b). It should be noted that the term\n“warrant” used elsewhere in philosophy as a synonym for\n“justified” (as in “warranted assertibility”)\nis used by Plantinga to mean that which has to be adjoined to a true\nbelief for it to be knowledge. (See Plantinga 1993a). Accordingly the\nmost pressing criticism of Plantinga’s later position is that it\nlargely ignores the question of justification, or reasonableness\nwhich, as Swinburne explicates it (Swinburne 2001) amounts to whether\nthe religious beliefs are probable relative to total evidence. \n\nWhile the details of grounding might be controversial it may be assumed\nthat reformed epistemologists  assert that ordinary religious\nexperiences of awe, gratitude, contrition, etc., ground the beliefs\nimplied by the believer’s sincere reports of such experiences, provided\nthey can be said to cause those beliefs. Such grounded beliefs are\nwarranted provided they can be defended against known objections. They\ncan then be used as evidence for further religious beliefs. Thus if\nreligious experience grounds the belief that God has forgiven you for\ndoing what is wrong to other humans beings, then that is evidence for a\npersonal God who acts in a morally upright fashion. For, it can be\nargued, only such a God would find anything to forgive in the wrongs you\ndo to your fellow human beings. \n\nOne difference between reformed epistemology and fideism is that the\nformer requires defence against known objections, whereas the latter\nmight dismiss such objections as either irrelevant or, worse,\nintellectual temptations. Included in the objections are not only\nthose such as the Argument from Evil that seek to rebut, but arguments\nfrom sociology and, more recently, cognitive science that seek to\nundermine by proposing a naturalistic cause for basic religious\nbeliefs. For instance, Justin Barrett (2004) posits a HADD\n(hyperactive/hypersensitive agency detection device), suggesting that\na sensitive agency detection device functions properly if the goal is\nsurvival but is hypersensitive if the goal is truth. This\nhypersensitivity then explains the human tendency towards supernatural\nbeliefs, undermining the proper basicality of those beliefs. Clark and\nBarrett (2011) suggest that this hypersensitivity could itself be part\nof the divine plan. An alternative, Bayesian, theistic response would\nbe that HADD exaggerates a properly basic probability for theism that\nis neither high nor too low prior to further evidence. This justifies\na part evidentialist, part reformed, program of assessing the\nall-things-considered probability resulting from the effect of\nevidence on this basic probability. A difference between reformed epistemology and Wittgensteinian\nfideism is that the former proposes a universal relaxation of\nthe stringent conditions of evidentialism while the latter only\nproposes a relaxation for some“language games”, including religion. \n\nReformed epistemology could be correct and yet far less significant\nthan its proponents take it to be. That would occur if in fact rather\nfew religious beliefs are grounded in the sorts of ordinary religious\nexperiences most believers have. For it may well be that the beliefs\nare part of the cause of the experience rather than the other way round\n(Katz 1978). \nReformed epistemology might be thought of as a modification of\nevidentialism in which the permissible kinds of evidence are expanded.\nNotable in  this context is Alston’s work arguing that\ncertain kinds of religious experience can be assimilated to perception\n(Alston 1991). \n\nThe difference between reformed epistemology and Enlightenment-style\nevidentialism is also shown by a consideration of revelation and\ninspiration. An evidentialist will consider arguments from the premiss\nthat it is said such and such was revealed or the premiss that so and\nso claimed to be inspired by God, but a reformed epistemologist might\nallow as warranted those religious beliefs grounded in the event of\nrevelation or inspiration.  Thus Mavrodes has argued that any belief\ndue to a genuine revelation is warranted, and has discussed several\nmodes of revelation (Mavrodes 1988). Zagzebski argues that this would\nhave the unacceptable consequence that warrant, and hence knowledge,\nbecomes totally inaccessible either to the person concerned\nor the community (Zagzebski 1993a: 204–205). For instance, Mavrodes\nwould probably not consider Ramanujan’s belief that Krishna is divine\nas warranted, but even if Mavrodes is correct Ramanujan would have no\naccess to this truth about the unwarranted character of his own\nbeliefs.  A similar criticism could be made of beliefs grounded in\nreligious experience. In both cases, the question of whether a belief\nis genuinely grounded in religious experience or is genuinely grounded\nin inspiration is one that several religious traditions have paid\nattention to, with such theories as that of discernment of spirits\n(Murphy, 1990, ch 5). \n\nIn what might be called \"counter-reformed epistemology\"\nit could be allowed that a belief can be warranted if grounded in a\nreligious tradition. Such a belief would have to be caused in the right\nsort of way by the right sort of tradition. As in the previous cases we\nmight note that such grounding should be partially accessible to the\nbeliever. Rather little work has been done on this\nextension of reformed epistemology, but the social dimension of warrant\nhas been noted (Zagzebski 1993a). \n\nMore recently Plantinga (2000) has defended a rather different account of\ndivine inspiration, which he calls the Aquinas/Calvin model. This\nrelies upon the doctrine of ‘original sin’ claiming that\nmost humans suffer from a cognitive-affective disorder, but that as a\nresult of Redemption the Holy Spirit heals us so that we are able to\nfunction properly, and come to believe the Christian revelation in an\nimmediate, non-inferential manner. In this way the Aquinas/Calvin\nmodel supports the Christian metaphysics, which in turn supports the\nAquinas/Calvin model. Presumably it will be granted that the\nprobability, y, of the Aquinas/Calvin model given Christian\nmetaphysics is significantly less than 100%, because there are rival\nChristian models. As a consequence, the probability, z, of\nChristian metaphysics is less than x/(1−y)\nwhere x is the probability of Christian metaphysics given the\nfalsity of the Aquinas/Calvin model. Hence Plantinga’s proposal can\nsucceed only if either y is near 100% or x is not\ntoo small. \n\nReligious disagreement is a long-standing problem in philosophy of\nreligion, but in this century there has been great interest in\ndisagreements between theists and atheists as well as the\ndisagreements between followers of various religions. (See Kelly 2005,\nChristensen 2007, Feldman 2007, Kraft 2007, Feldman and Warfield\n2011, Christensen and Lackey 2013) The problem here is obvious: how can sincere intelligent people\ndisagree?  Should not both disputants suspend judgement? To be sure,\nsometimes those who disagree with you are your intellectual inferiors\nin some respect. Consider, for instance, someone who insisted that\nπ was precisely 22/7. Those who know of and can follow a proof that\nπ is an irrational number may justifiably dismiss that person as a\nmathematical ignoramus.  The case of interest, however, is that in\nwhich no such inferiority is on public display. This is referred to as\na situation of public epistemic parity.  Richard Feldman\ncriticizes the relativist solution to the problem, namely that there is not always a unique reasonable doxastic attitude  to a given proposition in  a given epistemic situation. He also rejects unargued\ndismissal, and reaches the conclusion that in situations of epistemic\nparity disputants should suspend judgement. Many, however, agree with\nPeter van Inwagen who, in his autobiographical ‘Quam\nDelicta’ (1994), implies that it is justified for both parties\nin a dispute to appeal to what is privately available to them. Such\nprivate assertions of epistemic superiority are often expressed by\nsaying that someone “just does not get the\npoint”. Typically, not getting the point requires a cognitive\nblind-spot. It is not that you know there is a point you cannot grasp,\nwhich reasonably requires some deference to those who claim to grasp\nit.  You fail to see there is a point. \n\nOne obvious complication concerning religious disagreements is the\nappeal to divine inspiration, as a source of private epistemic\nsuperiority, as in Plantinga’s “Aquinas/Calvin” model\n(Plantinga 2000).  It is hard to see, though, how this could apply to\ndisputes between two religions that both rely on the role of divine\ninspiration. Perhaps the only substitute for unargued dismissal is\nargued dismissal. ","contact.mail":"pforrest@une.edu.au","contact.domain":"une.edu.au"}]
