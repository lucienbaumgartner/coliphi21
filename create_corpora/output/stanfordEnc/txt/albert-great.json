Even more so than\nhis most famous student, St. Thomas of Aquinas, Albert’s\ninterests ranged from natural science all the way to theology. He made\ncontributions to logic, psychology, metaphysics, meteorology,\nmineralogy, and zoology. He was an avid commentator on nearly all the\ngreat authorities read during the 13th Century. He was\ndeeply involved in an attempt to understand the import of the thought\nof Aristotle in some orderly fashion that was distinct from the Arab\ncommentators who had incorporated their own ideas into the study of\nAristotle. Yet he was not averse to using some of the outstanding Arab\nphilosophers in developing his own ideas in philosophy. His superior\nunderstanding of a diversity of philosophical texts allowed him to\nconstruct one of the most remarkable syntheses in medieval\nculture.\n\n\n\nThe precise date of Albert’s birth is not known. It is generally\nconceded that he was born into a knightly family sometime around the\nyear 1200 in Lauingen an der Donau in Germany. He was apparently in\nItaly in the year 1222 where he was present when a rather terrible\nearthquake struck in Lombardy. A year later he was still in Italy and\nstudying at the University of Padua. The same year Jordan of Saxony\nreceived him into the Dominican order. He was sent to Cologne in order\nto complete his training for the order. He finished this training as\nwell as a course of studies in theology by 1228. He then began\nteaching as a lector at Cologne, Hildesheim, Freiburg im Breisgau,\nRegensburg, and Strassburg. During this period he published his first\nmajor work, De natura boni. \n\nTen years later he is recorded as having been present at the general\nchapter of the Dominican Order held in Bologna. Two years later he\nvisited Saxony where he observed the appearance of a comet. Some time\nbetween 1241 and 1242 he was sent to the University of Paris to\ncomplete his theological education. He followed the usual prescription\nof lecturing on the Sentences of Peter Lombard. In addition\nhe began writing his six part Summa parisiensis dealing with\nthe sacraments of the Church, the incarnation and resurrection of\nChrist, the four coevals, human nature, and the nature of the good. He\ntook his degree as master of theology in 1245 and began to teach\ntheology at the university under Gueric de Saint-Quentin. St. Thomas\nAquinas became his student at this time and remained under\nAlbert’s direction for the next three years. In 1248 Albert was\nappointed regent of studies at the studium generale that was\nnewly created by the Dominican order in Cologne. So Albert, along with\nThomas Aquinas, left Paris and went to Cologne. Thomas continued his\nstudies under Albert in Cologne and served as magister\nstudium in the school as well until 1252. Then Thomas returned to\nParis to take up his teaching duties while Albert remained in Cologne,\nwhere he began to work on the vast project he set himself of preparing\na paraphrase of each of the known works of Aristotle. \n\nIn 1254 the Dominican order again assigned Albert a difficult task.\nHe was elected the prior provincial for the German-speaking province\nof the order. This position mandated that Albert spend a great deal of\nhis time traveling throughout the province visiting Dominican\nconvents, priories, and even a Dominican mission in Riga. This task\noccupied Albert until 1256. That year he returned to Cologne, but left\nthe same year for Paris in order to attend a General Chapter of his\norder in which the allegations of William of St. Amour’s De\npericulis novissimorum temporum against mendicant orders were\nconsidered. A little later Pope Alexander IV asked Albert to go to\nAnagni in order to speak to a commission of Cardinals who were looking\ninto the claims of William. While engaged in this charge Albert\ncompleted his refutation of Averroistic psychology with his De\nunitate intellectus contra Averroistas. Afterwards Albert\ndeparted for another tour of the province of Germany. In 1257 he\nreturned to the papal court, which was now located in Viterbo. He was\nrelieved of his duties as prior provincial and returned again to\nCologne as regent of studies. He continued to teach until 1259 when he\ntraveled to Valenciennes in order to attend a General Chapter of his\norder. At that time, along with Thomas Aquinas, Peter of Tarentasia,\nBonhomme Brito, and Florent de Hesdin, he undertook on behalf of his\norder an extensive discussion of the curriculum of the scholastic\nprogram used by the order. \n\nThe next year of his life found Albert once again appointed to an\nonerous duty. In obedience to the wishes of the pope Albert was\nconsecrated a bishop of the Church and sent to Ratisbon (modern\nRegensburg) in order to undertake a reform of abuses in that diocese.\nAlbert worked at this task until 1263 when Pope Urban IV relieved him\nof his duties and asked Albert to preach the Crusade in the German\nspeaking countries. This duty occupied Albert until the year 1264. He\nthen went to the city of Würzburg where he stayed until 1267. \n\nAlbert spent the next eight years traveling around Germany conducting\nvarious ecclesiastical tasks. Then in 1274 while he was traveling to\nthe Council of Lyons Albert received the sad news of the untimely\ndeath of Thomas Aquinas, his friend and former student of many\nyears. After the close of the Council Albert returned to\nGermany. There is evidence that he traveled to Paris in the year 1277\nin order to defend Aquinas’ teaching, which was under attack at\nthe university. In 1279, anticipating his death he drew up his own\nlast will and testament. On November 15, 1280 he died and was buried\nin Cologne. On December 15, 1931 Pope Pius XI declared Albert both a\nsaint and a doctor of the Church. On the 16th of December\n1941 Pope Pius XII declared Albert the patron saint of the natural\nsciences. \n\nAn examination of Albert’s published writings reveals something\nof his understanding of philosophy in human culture. In effect he\nprepared a kind of philosophical encyclopedia that occupied him up to\nthe last ten years of his life. He produced paraphrases of most of the\nworks of Aristotle available to him. In some cases where he felt that\nAristotle should have produced a work, but it was missing, Albert\nproduced the work himself. If he had produced nothing else it would be\nnecessary to say that he adopted the Aristotelian\nphilosophical-scientific program and subordinated it to the Neoplatonic tradition. Albert’s\nintellectual vision, however, was very great. Not only did he\nparaphrase “The Philosopher” (as the medievals called\nAristotle) but Porphyry, Boethius, Peter Lombard, Gilbert de la\nPorrée, the Liber de causis, and Ps.-Dionysius. He\nalso wrote a number of commentaries on the Bible. In addition to all\nof this work of paraphrasing and commenting, in which Albert labored\nto prepare a kind of unified field theory of medieval Christian\nintellectual culture, he also wrote a number of works in which he\ndeveloped his own philosophical-scientific-theological vision. Here\none finds titles such as De unitate intellectus, \nProblemata determinate, De fato, \nDe XV problematibus, De natura boni, \nDe sacramentis, De incarnatione, \nDe bono, De quattuor coaequaevis, \nDe homine, and his unfinished \nSumma theologiae de mirabilis scientia Dei. \n\nAlbert’s labors resulted in the formation of what might be\ncalled a Christian reception of Aristotle in the Western Europe.\nAlbert himself had a strong bias in favor of Neo-Platonism,and his\nwork on Aristotle shows him to have had a deep understanding of the\nAristotelian program. Along with his student Thomas Aquinas he was of\nthe opinion that Aristotle and the kind of natural philosophy that he\nrepresented was no obstacle to the development of a Christian\nphilosophical vision of the natural order. In order to establish this\npoint Albert carefully dissected the method that Aristotle employed in\nundertaking the task of expounding natural philosophy. This method,\nAlbert decided, is experientially based and proceeds to draw\nconclusions by the use of both inductive and deductive\nlogic. Christian theology, as Albert found it taught in Europe rested\nfirmly upon the revelation of Sacred Scripture and the Church\nFathers. Therefore, he reasoned, the two domains of human culture are\ndistinct in their methodology and pose no threat to each other. Both\ncan be pursued for their own sake. Philosophy was not to be valued\nonly in terms of its ancillary relation to theology. As recent\nresearch has shown, Albert subordinated his use of Aristotle to his\nunderstanding of the Neoplatonic view of reality that he found in the\nwritings of Pseudo Dionysius and the Liber de causis. He saw\nall of reality in terms of the Neoplatonic categories of exit and\nreturn, which he referred to in his writings with the terms\nexitus, perfectio, and reductio. This\nschema gave him a framework into which he could develop the scientific\ninsights of Aristotle. \n\nAlbert carefully prepared a paraphrase of Aristotle’s\nOrganon (the logical treatises in the Aristotelian corpus). He\nthen used the results of this paraphrase to address the problem of\nuniversals as he found it discussed in the philosophical literature and\ndebates of the medieval philosophical culture. He defined the term\nuniversal as referring to “ … that which, although it\n exists in one, is apt by nature to exist in\n many.”[1]\n Because it is apt\nto be in many, it is predicable of them. (De praed., tract II,\nc. 1) He then distinguished three kinds of universals, those that\npre-exist the things that exemplify them \n(universale ante rem), \nthose that exist in individual things (universale in re), \nand those that exist in the mind when abstracted from individual things \n(universale post rem). \n\nAlbert attempted to formulate an answer to Porphyry’s famous problem\nof universals—namely, do the species according to which we\nclassify beings exist in themselves or are they merely constructions\nof the mind? Albert appealed to his three-fold distinction, noting\nthat a universal’s mode of being is differentiated according to which\nfunction is being considered. It may be considered in itself, or in\n respect to understanding, or as existing in one particular or\n another.[2]\n Both the nominalist and realist solutions to Porphyry’s problem are\nthus too simplistic and lack proper distinction. Albert’s distinction\nthus allowed him to harmonize Plato’s realism in which universals\nexisted as separate forms with Aristotle’s more nominalistic theory of\nimmanent forms. For universals when considered in themselves\n(secudum quod in seipso) truly exist and are free from\n generation, corruption, and\n change.[3]\n If, however, they are taken in reference to the mind (refertur ad\nintelligentiam) they exist in two modes, depending on whether\nthey are considered with respect to the intellect that is their cause\n or the intellect that knows them by\n abstraction.[4]\n But when they are considered in particulars (secundum quod est in\nisto vel in illo) their existence is exterior to as well as\n beyond the mind, yet existing in things as\n individuated.[5] \n\nAlbert’s metaphysics is an adaptation of Aristotelian\nmetaphysics as conditioned by a form of Neo-Platonism. His reading the\nLiber de causis as an authentic Aristotelian text influenced\nhis understanding of Aristotle. It seems that Albert never realized the\nNeo-Platonic origin of the work. As with the other works of Aristotle\nhe prepared a paraphrase of the work entitled De causis et processu\nuniversitatis, and used it as a guide to interpreting other works\nby Aristotle. However, he also used the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius to\ncorrect some of the doctrine found in the Liber de causis. \n\nAlbert blends these three main sources of his metaphysics into a\nhierarchical structure of reality in which there is an emanation of\nforms directed by what Albert calls “a summoning of the\ngood” (advocatio boni). The good operates metaphysically\nas the final cause of the order of forms in the universe of beings. But\nit is also the First Cause. And its operation in the created order of\nbeing is discovered as an attraction of all being back to itself.\n“We exist because God is good,” Albert explains, “and\n we are good insofar as we\n exist.”[6]\n Thus the balanced relations of the exit and return of all things\naccording to classical Neo-Platonism is skewed in favor of the\nrelationship of return. This is because Albert, as a Christian\nphilosopher, favors a creationist view of being over the doctrine of\npure emanation. Rejecting also the doctrine of universal hylomorphism\nAlbert argues that material beings are always composite in which the\nforms are inchoate until they are called forth by the ultimate\ngood. Spiritual creatures (excluding man) have no material\nelement. Their being summoned to the good is immediate and final. The\nsummoning of the inchoate forms of material beings, however, is not\ndirect. It depends upon the intervention of the celestial spheres. \n\nThe First Cause, which Albert understands as God, is an absolutely\ntranscendent reality. His uncreated light calls forth a hierarchically\nordered universe in which each order of being reflects this light.\nGod’s giving existence to creatures is understood by Albert as\n their procession from him as from a first\n cause.[7]\n At the top of this hierarchy of light are found the purely spiritual\nbeings, the angelic orders and the intelligences. Albert carefully\ndistinguishes these two kinds of beings. He basically accepts the\nanalysis of the angelic orders as found in Pseudo-Dionysius’ treatise\nof the celestial hierarchy. The intelligences move the cosmic spheres\nand illuminate the human soul. The intelligences, just as the order of\nangels, form a special hierarchy. The First Intelligence, as Albert\ncalls it, contemplates the entire universe and uses the human soul, as\nilluminated by the lower intelligences, to draw all creatures into a\nunity. \n\nBeneath the angels and intelligences are the souls that possess\nintellects. They are joined to bodies but do not depend on bodies for\ntheir existence. Although they are ordered to the First Intelligence\nso as to enjoin contemplative unity on the entire cosmos, Albert\nrejects the Averroistic theory of the unity of the intellect. Each\nhuman soul has its own intellect. But because the human soul uniquely\nstands on the horizon of both material and spiritual being it can\noperate as a microcosm and thus can serve the purpose of the First\nIntelligence, which is to bind all creatures into a universe. \n\nFinally there are the immersed forms. Under this heading Albert\nestablishes another hierarchy with the animal kingdom at the top,\nfollowed by the plant kingdom, then the world of minerals (in which\nAlbert had a deep interest), and finally the elements of material\ncreation. \n\nOne important aspect of Albert’s metaphysics appears in his\ncommentary on Aristotle’ Metaphysics. In this work\nAlbert relies heavily on both Averroes in his Long Commentary on\nthe Metaphysics and Avicenna’s Philosophia\nprima. While the commentary of Averroes is an almost literal\nanalysis of the text of Aristotle, Avicenna’s analysis often\ndeparts from this literal approach and incorporates ideas that\nAvicenna found in Aristotle’s Posterior\nAnalytics. Albert seems to be using Averroes when he is\nparaphrasing Aristotle’s text, but relies on Avicenna when he\ndeparts from the paraphrasing. As a result of this usage Albert\nproceeds to develop his own ideas of first philosophy as outlined\nabove. This can be seen for example in his analysis of the fifth book\nof the Metaphysics in his digression on unity found in\ntractate 1, chapter 8. Following Avicenna he argues that unity cannot\nbe an essential feature of any substance. \n\nAlbert’s interest in the human condition is dominated by his\nconcern with the relationship of the soul to the body on the one hand\nand the important role that the intellect plays in human psychology.\n According to Albert, man is identified with his\n intellect.[8]\n With regard to the relationship between the soul and the body Albert\nappears to be torn between the Platonic theory which sees the soul as\na form capable of existing independently of the body and the\nAristotelian hylomorphic theory which reduces the soul to a functional\nrelationship of the body. With respect to human knowing, for example,\nhe maintains the position that the human intellect is dependent upon\n the\n senses.[9]\n In order to resolve the conflict between the two views Albert availed\nhimself of Avicenna’s position that Aristotle’s analysis\nwas focused on the function and not the essence of the\nsoul. Functionally, Albert argues, the soul is the agent cause of the\nbody. “Just as we maintain that the soul is the cause of the\nanimated body and of its motions and passions insofar as it is\nanimated,” he reasons, “likewise we must maintain that the\nlowest intelligence is the cause of the cognitive soul insofar as it\nis cognitive because the cognition of the soul is a particular result\n of the light of the\n intelligence.”[10]\n Having been created in the image and likeness of God it not only\ngoverns the body, as God governs the universe, but it is responsible\nfor the very existence of the body, as God is the creator of the\nworld. And just as God transcends his creation, so does the human soul\ntranscend the body in its interests. It is capable of operating in\ncomplete independence of corporeal functions. This transcendental\nfunction of the soul allows Albert to focus on what he believes is the\nessence of the soul—the human intellect. \n\nViewed as essentially an intellect, the human soul is an incorporeal\nsubstance. Albert divides this spiritual substance into two\n powers—the agent intellect and the possible\n intellect.[11]\n Neither of these powers needs the body in order to function. Under\ncertain conditions concerning its powers the human intellect is\ncapable of transformation. While it is true that under the stimulus or\nillumination of the agent intellect the possible intellect can\nconsider the intelligible form of the phantasms of the mind which are\nderived from the senses, it can also operate under the sole influence\nof the agent intellect. Here, Albert argues, the possible intellect\nundergoes a complete transformation and becomes totally actualized, as\nthe agent intellect becomes its form. It emerges as what he calls the\n“adept intellect” (intellectus\n adeptus).[12]\n At this stage the human intellect is susceptible to illumination by\nhigher cosmic intellects called the “intelligences”. Such\nillumination brings the soul of man into complete harmony with the\nentire order of creation and constitutes man’s natural\nhappiness. Since the intellect is now totally assimilated to the order\nof things Albert calls the intellect in its final stage of development\nthe “assimilated intellect” (intellectus\nassimilativus). The condition of having attained an assimilated\nintellect constitutes natural human happiness, realizing all the\naspirations of the human condition and human culture. But Albert makes\nit clear that the human mind cannot attain this state of assimilation\non its own. Following the Augustinian tradition as set forth in the\nDe magistro Albert states that “because the divine\ntruth lies beyond our reason we are not able by ourselves to discover\nit, unless it condescends to infuse itself; for as Augustine says, it\nis an inner teacher, without whom an external teacher labors\n aimlessly.”[13]\n There is thus an infusion involved with divine illumination, but it\nis not a pouring forth of forms. Rather, it is an infusion of an inner\nteacher, who is identified with divine truth itself. In his commentary\non the Sentences Albert augments this doctrine when he argues\nthat this inner teacher strengthens the weakness of the human\nintellect, which by itself could not profit by external\nstimulation. He distinguishes the illumination of this interior\nteacher from the true and final object of the\n intellect.[14]\n Divine light is only a means by which the intellect can attain its\n object.[15]\n This is consistent with his emphasis upon the analogy of divine light\nand physical light, which pervades so much of his thinking. It\nfollows, then, that in the order of human knowing there are first of\nall the forms that are derived from external things. They cannot teach\nus anything in any useful way until the light of an inner teacher\nilluminates them. So light is the medium of this vision. But the inner\nteacher himself is identified with the divine truth, which is the\nfinal object and perfection of the human intellect. In his\nSumma, however, Albert makes further distinctions concerning\nthe object of human knowing. Natural things, he tells us, are received\nin a natural light, while the things that the intellect contemplates\nin the order of belief (ad credenda vero) are received in a\nlight that is gratuitous (gratuitum est), and the beatifying\nrealities are received in the light of\n glory.[16]\n It seems that Albert has abandoned the position that even\nnaturalia require divine illumination. Strictly speaking, he\nhas not abnegated his earlier position. Naturalia may very\nwell still require the work of a restorative inner teacher. In the\nSumma, however, Albert is anxious to stress the radical\ndifference natural knowing has from supernatural knowing. He has\nalready established this difference in his study of the human\nintellect (De intellectu) where he tells us, “Some\n[intelligibles] with their light overpower our intellect which is\ntemporal and has continuity. These are like the things that are most\nmanifest in nature which are related to our intellect as the light of\nthe sun or a strong scintillating color is to the eyes of the bat or\nthe owl. Other [intelligibles] are manifest only through the light of\nanother. These would be like the things which are received in faith\nfrom what is primary and\n true.”[17]\n But in both natural and supernatural knowing Albert is careful to\nstress the final object and perfection of the human intellect. This\nleads naturally to a consideration of Albert’s understanding of\nethics. \n\nIn the first section of his Commentary on Aristotle’s\nPhysics Albertus Magnus discusses the possibility of the study of\nnatural science. If science could only study particulars, Albert\nargues, then there would be no science in the sense of the\ndemonstration of necessary causes because there would be as many\nsciences as there are particulars. But particulars, Albert goes on to\npoint out, belong to definite kinds (species) and these can be studied\nbecause their causes can be demonstrated. Species have common\nattributes and a determined subject of which the attributes can be\ndetermined with necessity. Thus science is possible. \n\nAnd this conviction about science being possible, as opposed to the\nPlatonic and Neoplatonic tendency to discount the world of particular\nreality, and its presumed unaccountable changeableness, was not just a\ntheoretical position on Albert’s part. He devotes a great deal of\nhis time and attention to the actual empirical study of the\nrelationships between attributes and natural subjects. Furthermore, he\norders such study into what today would be called the “natural\nsciences”. Besides the study of the heavens and the earth and\ngeneration and corruption that he found in Aristotle, he adds the study\nof meteors, the mineral, animal, and vegetable kingdoms. \n\nAlbert inherited astronomy as part of the scholastic curriculum known\nas the quadrivium. But his interest in this science\nwas not merely conceptual; he was also interested in using mathematical\ncalculations and conferring with astronomical tables to study the\nnature of celestial bodies. He was concerned with the constellations,\nthe sizes of planets and stars and their positions and movements in the\nheavens. He seems to have known about astronomical instruments,\nparticularly the astrolabe, but gives no clue as to what method of\ninvestigation he used to carry out his studies. He did make it clear,\nhowever, that the principles of physics had to be applied to celestial\nbodies, which he regarded as natural physical bodies moving in real\nspace. \n\nBesides studying the properties of the celestial bodies themselves, he\nalso was concerned with their effects on terrestrial objects. For\nexample, he seems to have understood that the tides on earth were\nrelated to celestial bodies. \n\nAfter astronomy, Albert develops a particular order in which he\nproposes to study the other sciences. In his Meteora, he\nexplains that sublunary moveable bodies can be studied in three ways.\nFirst, in so far as they come into and pass out of being (generation\nand corruption). Then they must be investigated with respect to their\nmixture with other moveable bodies. And lastly, they need to be studied\nwith respect to their contraction to the mineral, vegetable, and animal\nspecies. This last phase of his plan, however, is where Albert made his\nown contribution to the development of modern science as it is known\ntoday. That is, he undertook his own empirical investigations into the\nmineral, plant, and animal kingdoms. \n\nAlbert’s Treatise on Minerals (De mineralibus)\nshows that he undertakes his own observations and did not merely\ncollate authorities on the topic. He studies different kinds of\nminerals and metals as well as rare stones. Beginning with the mineral\nkingdom, he notes the properties of each mineral specimen, including\nwhere it was found along with its cause or causes. Next, he deals with\nrare stones, investigating the powers of these specimens along with\ntheir causes. He then produces an alphabetical list of a large number\nof these more precious stones. Throughout the treatise, Albert is\ncareful always to proceed from the effects or properties of the mineral\nworld to hypotheses concerning their causes. It is clear from his text\nthat he himself made a number of studies (experiments) with different\nminerals. \n\nNext, Albert studies the plant kingdom. In his Treatise on\nPlants (De vegetabilibus), as in his Treatise on\nMinerals, he combines his own observations with those of other\nauthorities, providing an alphabetical list of plants as he did for\nstones in his Treatise on Minerals. But he adds a long section\non the cultivation of plants. He makes the interesting observation that\nthe properties of certain plants are caused by celestial bodies. He\nalso indicates the medicinal properties of certain plants, although he\nis careful to point out that his principal concern is in understanding\nthe nature of plants based on a study of their properties and\nvirtues. \n\nAlbert’s interest in the natural order concludes with his\ninvestigations of the final level of natural beings, the animal\nkingdom. His Treatise on Animals (De animalibus)\ninvolves Aristotle’s studies of animals as well as material taken\nfrom Thomas of Cantimpré’s encyclopedic On the Nature\nof Things (De natura rerum). But Albert inserts his own\nstudies of animals into the treatise. He investigates the causes of the\nproperties of different kinds of animals based on their operations and\npowers. Again, Albert organizes a kind of dictionary of animals based\non their various species, listed in alphabetical order as he had done\nin the other special sciences. \n\nIt seems to have been of considerable importance to Albert to do two\nthings in developing his scientific investigations. First, to review\nand organize the authorities in each of the branches of science and\nsecond to test by his own experience the claims made by these\nauthorities. In this way, he was careful to accommodate readers who\nwere used to consulting authorities instead of experience by providing\na context in which he could introduce his new findings. \n\nAlbert’s ethics rests on his understanding of human freedom. This\nfreedom is expressed through the human power to make unrestricted\ndecisions about their own actions. This power, the liberum\narbitrium, Albert believes is identified neither with the\nintellect nor the will. He holds this extraordinary position because\nof his analysis of the genesis of human action. In his treatise on man\n(Liber de homine) he accounts for human action as beginning\nwith the intellect considering the various options for action open to\na person at a given moment in time. This is coupled by the will\ndesiring the beneficial outcome of the proposed event. Then the\nliberum arbitrium chooses one of the options proposed by the\nintellect or the object of the will’s desire. The will then moves the\nperson to act on the basis of the choice of the liberum\narbitrium. Brutes do not have this ability, he argues, and must\nact solely on their initial desire. Hence they have no power of free\nchoice. In his later writings, however, Albert eliminates the first\nact of the will. But even so he distinguishes the liberum\narbitrium from both the will and the intellect, presumably so\nthat it can respond to the influences of both these faculties\nequally. Thus the way to ethics is open. \n\nAlbert’s concern with ethics as such is found in his two\ncommentaries on Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics. The\nprologues to both these works reveal Albert’s original thoughts\non some problems about the discipline of ethics. He wonders if ethics\ncan be considered as a theoretical deductive science. He concludes that\nit can be so considered because the underlying causes of moral action\n(rationes morum) involve both necessary and universal\nprinciples, the conditions needed for a science according to the\nanalysis of Aristotle that Albert\n accepted.[18]\n The rationes morum are contrasted by him to the mere\nappearance of moral\n behaviour.[19]\n Thus virtue can be discussed in abstraction from particular actions\nof individual human agents. The same is true of other ethical\nprinciples. However, Albert maintains that it is possible to refer to\nparticular human acts as exemplifying relevant virtues and as such to\ninclude them in a scientific discussion of\n ethics.[20]\n Therefore, ethics is theoretical, even though the object of its\ntheory is the practical. \n\nAnother concern that Albert expresses is how ethics as a theoretical\ndeductive science can be relevant to the practice of the\nvirtuous life. He addresses this problem by distinguishing ethics as a\ndoctrine (ethica docens) from ethics as a practical activity\nof individual human beings (ethica\n utens).[21]\n The outcomes of these two aspects of ethics are different he\nargues. Ethics as a doctrine is concerned with teaching. It proceeds\nby logical analysis concentrating on the goals of human action in\ngeneral. As such its proper end is knowledge. But as a practical and\nuseful art ethics is concerned with action as a means to a desired\n end.[22]\n Its mode of discourse is rhetorical—the persuasion of the\nhuman being to engage in the right actions that will lead to the\ndesired\n end.[23]\n Albert sees these two aspects of ethics as linked together by the\nvirtue of prudence. It is prudence that applies the results of the\ndoctrine of ethics to its\n practice.[24]\n Ethics considered as a doctrine operates through prudence as a remote\ncause of ethical action. Thus the two functions of ethics are related\nand ethics is considered by Albert as both a theoretical deductive\nscience and a practical applied science. \n\nAlbert goes beyond these methodological considerations. He addresses\nthe end of ethics, as he understands it. And here his psychology bears\nfruit. For he embraces the idea that the highest form of human\nhappiness is the contemplative life. This is the true and proper end\nof man, he claims. For the adept intellect, as noted above, is the\nhighest achievement to which the human condition can aspire. It\nrepresents the conjunction of the apex of the human mind to the\nseparated agent intellect. In this conjunction the separated agent\nintellect becomes the form of the soul. The soul experiences\nself-sufficiency and is capable of contemplative wisdom. This is as\nclose to beatitude as man can get in this life. Man is now capable of\ncontemplating separated beings as such and can live his life in almost\nstoical detachment from the concerns of sublunar existence. \n\nAlbert’s influence on the development of scholastic philosophy in the\nthirteenth century was enormous. He, along with his most famous\nstudent Thomas of Aquinas, succeeded in incorporating the philosophy\nof Aristotle into the Christian West. Besides Thomas, Albert was also\nthe teacher of Ulrich of Straßburg (1225 – 1277), who\ncarried forward Albert’s interest in natural science by writing a\ncommentary on Aristotle’s Meteors along with his metaphysical\nwork, the De summo bono; Hugh Ripelin of Straßburg\n(c.1200 – 1268) who wrote the famous Compendium theologicae\nveritatis; John of Freiburg (c.1250 – 1314) who wrote the\nLibellus de quaestionibus casualibus; and Giles of Lessines\n(c. 1230 – c. 1304) who wrote a treatise on the unity of\nsubstantial form, the De unitate formae. The influence of\nAlbert and his students was very pronounced in the generation of\nGerman scholars who came after these men. Dietrich of Freiberg, who\nmay have actually met Albert, is probably the best example of the\ninfluence of the spirit of Albert the Great. Dietrich (c. 1250 –\nc. 1310) wrote treatises on natural science, which give evidence of\nhis having carried out actual scientific investigation. His treatise\non the rainbow would be a good example. But he also wrote treatises on\nmetaphysical and theological topics in which the echoes of Albert can\nbe distinctly heard. Unlike Albert he did not write commentaries on\nAristotle, but preferred to apply Albertist principles to topics\naccording to his own understanding. On the other hand Berthold of\nMoosburg (+ c. 1361) wrote a very important commentary on Proclus’\nElements of Theology, introducing the major work of the great\nNeo-Platonist into German metaphysics. Berthold’s debt to Albert is\nfound throughout his commentary, especially with regard to\nmetaphysical topics. Many of these Albertist ideas and principles\npassed down to thinkers such as Meister Eckhart, John Tauler, and\nHeinrich Suso where they took on a unique mystical flavor. The\nAlbertist tradition continued down to Heymeric de Campo (1395 –\n1460) who passed it on to Nicholas of Cusa. From Nicholas the ideas\npass down to the Renaissance. The philosophers of the Renaissance seem\nto have been attracted to the Albert’s understanding of Neo-Platonism\nand his interest in natural science.","contact.mail":"fuehrer@augsburg.edu","contact.domain":"augsburg.edu"}]
