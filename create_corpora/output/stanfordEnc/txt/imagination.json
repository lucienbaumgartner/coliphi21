One\ncan use imagination to represent possibilities other than the actual,\nto represent times other than the present, and to represent\nperspectives other than one’s own. Unlike perceiving and\nbelieving, imagining something does not require one to consider that\nsomething to be the case. Unlike desiring or anticipating, imagining\nsomething does not require one to wish or expect that something to be\nthe case.\n\n\nImagination is involved in a wide variety of human activities, and has\nbeen explored from a wide range of philosophical perspectives.\nPhilosophers of mind have examined imagination’s role in\nmindreading and in pretense. Philosophical aestheticians have examined\nimagination’s role in creating and in engaging with different\ntypes of artworks. Epistemologists have examined imagination’s\nrole in theoretical thought experiments and in practical\ndecision-making. Philosophers of language have examined\nimagination’s role in irony and metaphor.\n\n\nBecause of the breadth of the topic, this entry focuses exclusively on\ncontemporary discussions of imagination in the Anglo-American\nphilosophical tradition. For an overview of historical discussions of\nimagination, see the sections on pre-twentieth century and early\ntwentieth century accounts of entry on\n mental imagery;\n for notable historical accounts of imagination, see corresponding\nentries on\n Aristotle,\n Thomas Hobbes,\n David Hume,\n Immanuel Kant, and\n Gilbert Ryle;\n for a more detailed and comprehensive historical survey, see Brann\n1991; and for a sophisticated and wide-ranging discussion of\nimagination in the phenomenological tradition, see Casey 2000.\n\nA variety of roles have been attributed to imagination across various\ndomains of human understanding and activity\n (section 3).\n Not surprisingly, it is doubtful that there is one component of the\nmind that can satisfy all the various roles attributed to imagination\n(Kind 2013). Nevertheless, perhaps guided by these roles, philosophers\nhave attempted to clarify the nature of imagination in three ways.\nFirst, philosophers have tried to disambiguate different senses of the\nterm “imagination” and, in some cases, point to some core\ncommonalities amongst the different disambiguations\n (section 1.1).\n Second, philosophers have given partial taxonomies to distinguish\ndifferent types of imaginings\n (section 1.2).\n Third, philosophers have located norms that govern paradigmatic\nimaginative episodes\n (section 1.3). \nThere is a general consensus among those who work on the topic that\nthe term “imagination” is used too broadly to\npermit simple taxonomy. Indeed, it is common for overviews to begin\nwith an invocation of P.F. Strawson’s remarks in\n“Imagination and Perception”, where he writes: \nThe uses, and applications, of the terms “image”,\n“imagine”, “imagination”, and so forth make up\na very diverse and scattered family. Even this image of a family seems\ntoo definite. It would be a matter of more than difficulty to identify\nand list the family’s members, let alone their relations of\nparenthood and cousinhood. (Strawson 1970: 31) \nThese taxonomic challenges carry over into attempts at\ncharacterization. In the opening chapter of Mimesis as\nMake-Believe—perhaps the most influential contemporary\nmonograph on imagination—Kendall Walton throws up his hands at\nthe prospect of delineating the notion precisely. After enumerating\nand distinguishing a number of paradigmatic instances of imagining, he\nasks: \nWhat is it to imagine? We have examined a number of dimensions along\nwhich imaginings can vary; shouldn’t we now spell out what they\nhave in common?—Yes, if we can. But I can’t. (Walton 1990:\n19) \nLeslie Stevenson (2003: 238) makes arguably the only recent attempt at\na somewhat comprehensive inventory of the term’s uses, covering\ntwelve of “the most influential conceptions of\nimagination” that can be found in recent discussions in\n“philosophy of mind, aesthetics, ethics, poetry and …\nreligion”. \nTo describe the varieties of imaginings, philosophers have given\npartial and overlapping taxonomies. \nSome taxonomies are merely descriptive, and they tend to be less\ncontroversial. For example, Kendall Walton (1990) distinguishes\nbetween spontaneous and deliberate imagining (acts\nof imagination that occur with or without the one’s conscious\ndirection); between occurrent and nonoccurrent\nimaginings (acts of imagination that do or do not occupy the\none’s explicit attention); and between social and\nsolitary imaginings (episodes of imagining that occur with or\nwithout the joint participation of several persons). \nOne notable descriptive taxonomy concerns imagining from the\ninside versus from the outside (Williams 1973; Wollheim\n1973; see Ninan 2016 for an overview). To imagine from the outside\nthat one is Napoleon involves imagining a scenario in which one is\nNapoleon. To imagine from the inside that one is Napoleon involves\nthat plus something else: namely, that one is occupying the\nperspective of Napoleon. Imagining from the inside is\nessentially first-personal, imagining from the outside is not. This\ndistinction between two modes of imagining is especially notable for\nits implications for thought experiments about the metaphysics of\npersonal identity (Nichols 2008; Ninan 2009; Williams 1973). \nSome taxonomies aim to be more systematic—to carve imaginings at\ntheir joints, so to speak—and they, as one might expect, tend to\nbe more controversial. \nGregory Currie and Ian Ravenscroft (2002) distinguishes creative\nimagination (combining ideas in unexpected and unconventional\nways); sensory imagination (perception-like experiences in\nthe absence of appropriate stimuli); and what they call recreative\nimagination (an ability to experience or think about the world\nfrom a perspective different from the one that experience presents).\nNeil Van Leeuwen (2013, 2014) takes a similar approach to delineate\nthree common uses of “imagination” and cognate terms.\nFirst, these terms can be used to refer to constructive\nimagining, which concerns the process of generating mental\nrepresentations. Second, these terms can be used to refer to\nattitude imagining, which concerns the propositional attitude\none takes toward mental representations. Third, these terms can be\nused to refer to imagistic imagining, which concerns the\nperception-like format of mental representations. \nAmy Kind and Peter Kung (2016b) pose the puzzle of imaginative\nuse—on the seeming irreconcilability between the\ntranscendent uses of imagination, which enables one to escape\nfrom or look beyond the world as it is, and the instructive\nuses of imagination, which enables one to learn about the world as it\nis. Kind and Kung ultimately resolve the puzzle by arguing that the\nsame attitude can be put to these seemingly disparate uses because the\ntwo uses differ not in kind, but in degree—specifically, the\ndegree of constraint on imaginings. \nFinally, varieties of imagination might be classified in terms of\ntheir structure and content. Consider the following three types of\nimaginings, each illustrated with an example. When one imagines\npropositionally, one represents to oneself that something is the\ncase. So, for example, Juliet might imagine that Romeo is by her\nside. To imagine in this sense is to stand in some mental\nrelation to a particular proposition (see the entry on\n propositional attitude reports).\n When one imagines objectually, one represents to oneself a\nreal or make-believe entity or situation (Yablo 1993; see also Martin\n2002; Noordhof 2002; O’Shaughnessy 2000). So, for example,\nProspero might imagine an acorn or a nymph or\nthe city of Naples or a wedding feast. To imagine in\nthis sense is to stand in some mental relation to a representation of\nan (imaginary or real) entity or state of affairs. When one\nimagines X-ing, one simulatively represents to oneself some\nsort of activity or experience (Walton 1990). So, for example, Ophelia\nmight imagine seeing Hamlet or getting herself to a\nnunnery. To imagine in this sense is to stand in a first-personal\nmental relation to some (imaginary or real) behavior or\nperception. \nThere are general norms that govern operations of imagination (Gendler\n2003). \nMirroring is manifest to the extent that features of the\nimaginary situation that have not been explicitly stipulated are\nderivable via features of their real-world analogues, or, more\ngenerally, to the extent that imaginative content is taken to be\ngoverned by the same sorts of restrictions that govern believed\ncontent. For example, in a widely-discussed experiment conducted by\nAlan Leslie (1994), children are asked to engage in an imaginary tea\nparty. When an experimenter tips and “spills” one of the\n(empty) teacups, children consider the non-tipped cup to be\n“full” (in the context of the pretense) and the tipped cup\nto be “empty” (both within and outside of the context of\nthe pretense). In fact, both make-believe games and more complicated\nengagements with the arts are governed by principles of\ngeneration, according to which prompts or props prescribe\nparticular imaginings (Walton 1990). \nQuarantining is manifest to the extent that events within the\nimagined or pretended episode are taken to have effects only within a\nrelevantly circumscribed domain. So, for example, the child engaging\nin the make-believe tea party does not expect that\n“spilling” (imaginary) “tea” will result in\nthe table really being wet, nor does a person who imagines\nwinning the lottery expect that when she visits the ATM, her bank\naccount will contain a million dollars. More generally, quarantining\nis manifest to the extent that proto-beliefs and proto-attitudes\nconcerning the imagined state of affairs are not treated as beliefs\nand attitudes relevant to guiding action in the actual world. \nAlthough imaginative episodes are generally governed by mirroring and\nquarantining, both may be violated in systematic ways. \nMirroring gives way to disparity as a result of the ways in\nwhich (the treatment of) imaginary content may differ from (that of)\nbelieved content. Imagined content may be incomplete (for\nexample, there may be no fact of the matter (in the pretense) just how\nmuch tea has spilled on the table) or incoherent (for\nexample, it might be that the toaster serves (in the pretense) as a\nlogical-truth inverter). And content that is imagined may give rise to\ndiscrepant responses, most strikingly in cases of discrepant\naffect—where, for example, the imminent destruction of all human\nlife is treated as amusing rather than terrifying. \nQuarantining gives way to contagion when imagined content\nends up playing a direct role in actual attitudes and behavior (see\nalso Gendler 2008a, 2008b). This is common in cases of affective\ntransmission, where an emotional response generated by an\nimagined situation may constrain subsequent behavior. For example,\nimagining something fearful (such as a tiger in the kitchen) may give\nrise to actual hesitation (such as reluctance to enter the room). And\nit also occurs in cases of cognitive transmission, where\nimagined content is thereby “primed” and rendered more\naccessible in ways that go on to shape subsequent perception and\nexperience. For example, imagining some object (such as a sheep) may\nmake one more likely to “perceive” such objects in\none’s environment (such as mistaking a rock for a ram). \nOne way to make sense of the nature of imagination is by drawing\ndistinctions, giving taxonomies, and elucidating governing norms\n (section 1).\n Another, arguably more prominent, way to make sense of the nature is\nby figuring out, in a broadly functionalist framework, how it fits in\nwith more well-understood mental entities from folk psychology and\nscientific psychology (see the entry on\n functionalism). \nThere are two related tasks involved. First, philosophers have used\nother mental entities to define imagination by contradistinction (but\nsee Wiltsher forthcoming for a critique of this approach). To give an\noversimplified example, many philosophers hold that imagining is like\nbelieving except that it does not directly motivate actions. Second,\nphilosophers have used other mental entities to understand the inputs\nand outputs of imagination. To give an oversimplified example, many\nphilosophers hold that imagination does not output to\naction-generating systems. \nAmongst the most widely-discussed mental entities in contemporary\ndiscussions of imagination are belief\n (section 2.1),\n desire\n (section 2.2),\n mental imagery\n (section 2.3),\n memory\n (section 2.4),\n and supposition\n (section 2.5).\n The resolution of these debates ultimately rest on the extent to\nwhich the imaginative attitude(s) posited can fulfill the roles\nascribed to imagination from various domains of human understanding\nand activity\n (section 3). \nTo believe is to take something to be the case or regard it\nas true (see the entry on\n belief).\n When one says something like “the liar believes that his pants\nare on fire”, one attributes to the subject (the liar) an\nattitude (belief) towards a proposition (his pants are on fire).\nLikewise, when one says something like “the liar imagines that\nhis pants are on fire”, one attributes to the subject (the liar)\nan attitude (imagination) towards a proposition (his pants are on\nfire). The similarities and differences between the belief attribution\nand the imagination attribution point to similarities and differences\nbetween imagining and believing.  \nImagining and believing are both cognitive attitudes that are\nrepresentational. They take on the same kind of content:\nrepresentations that stand in inferential relationship with one\nanother. On the single code hypothesis, it is the sameness of\nthe representational format that grounds functional similarities\nbetween imagining and believing (Nichols & Stich 2000, 2003;\nNichols 2004a). As for their differences, there are two main options\nfor distinguishing imagining and believing (Sinhababu 2016). \nThe first option characterizes their difference in normative terms.\nWhile belief aims at truth, imagination does not (Humberstone\n1992; Shah & Velleman 2005). If the liar did not regard it as true\nthat his pants are on fire, then it seems that he cannot really\nbelieve that his pants are on fire. By contrast, even if the liar did\nnot regard it as true that his pants are on fire, he can still imagine\nthat his pants are on fire. While the norm of truth is constitutive of\nthe attitude of belief, it is not constitutive of the attitude of\nimagination. In dissent, Neil Sinhababu (2013) argues that the norm of\ntruth is neither sufficient nor necessary for distinguishing imagining\nand believing. \nThe second option characterizes their difference in functional terms.\nOne purported functional difference between imagination and belief\nconcerns their characteristic connection to actions. If the liar truly\nbelieves that his pants are on fire, he will typically attempt to put\nout the fire by, say, pouring water on himself. By contrast, if the\nliar merely imagines that his pants are on fire, he will typically do\nno such thing. While belief outputs to action-generation system,\nimagination does not (Nichols & Stich 2000, 2003). David Velleman\n(2000) and Tyler Doggett and Andy Egan (2007) point to particular\npretense behaviors to challenge this way of distinguishing imagining\nand believing. Velleman argues that a belief-desire explanation of\nchildren’s pretense behaviors makes children “depressingly\nunchildlike”. Doggett and Egan argue that during immersive\nepisodes, pretense behaviors can be directly motivated by imagination.\nIn response to these challenges, philosophers typically accept that\nimagination can have a guidance or stage-setting role in motivating\nbehaviors, but reject that it directly outputs to action-generation\nsystem (Van Leeuwen 2009; O’Brien 2005; Funkhouser &\nSpaulding 2009; Everson 2007; Kind 2011; Currie & Ravenscroft\n2002). \nAnother purported functional difference between imagination and belief\nconcerns their characteristic connection to emotions. If the liar\ntruly believes that his pants are on fire, then he will be genuinely\nafraid of the fire; but not if he merely imagines so. While belief\nevokes genuine emotions toward real entities, imagination does not\n(Walton 1978, 1990, 1997; see also related discussion of the paradox\nof fictional emotions in\n Supplement on Puzzles and Paradoxes of Imagination and the Arts).\n This debate is entangled with the controversy concerning the nature\nof emotions (see the entry on\n emotion).\n In rejecting this purported functional difference, philosophers also\ntypically reject narrow cognitivism about emotions (Nichols 2004a;\nMeskin & Weinberg 2003; Weinberg & Meskin 2005, 2006; Kind\n2011; Spaulding 2015; Carruthers 2003, 2006). \nCurrently, the consensus is that there exists some important\ndifference between imagining and believing. Yet, there are two\ndistinct departures from this consensus. On the one hand, some\nphilosophers have pointed to novel psychological phenomena in which it\nis unclear whether imagination or belief is at work—such as\ndelusions (Egan 2008a) and immersed pretense (Schellenberg\n2013)—and argued that the best explanation for these phenomena\nsays that imagination and belief exists on a continuum. In responding\nto the argument from immersed pretense, Shen-yi Liao and Tyler Doggett\n(2014) argue that a cognitive architecture that collapses distinctive\nattitudes on the basis of borderline cases is unlikely to be fruitful\nin explaining psychological phenomena. On the other hand, some\nphilosophers have pointed to familiar psychological phenomena and\nargued that the best explanation for these phenomena says that\nimagination is ultimately reducible to belief. Peter Langland-Hassan\n(2012, 2014) argues that pretense can be explained with only reference\nto beliefs—specifically, beliefs about counterfactuals. Derek\nMatravers (2014) argues that engagements with fictions can be\nexplained without references to imaginings. \nTo desire is to want something to be the case (see the entry on\n desire).\n Standardly, the conative attitude of desire is contrasted\nwith the cognitive attitude of belief in terms of direction\nof fit: while belief aims to make one’s mental representations\nmatch the way the world is, desire aims to make the way the world is\nmatch one’s mental representations. Recall that on the\nsingle code hypothesis, there exists a cognitive imaginative\nattitude that is structurally similar to belief. Is there a conative\nimaginative attitude—call it desire-like imagination\n(Currie 1997, 2002a, 2002b, 2010; Currie & Ravenscroft 2002),\nmake-desire (Currie 1990; Goldman 2006), or i-desire\n(Doggett & Egan 2007, 2012)—that is structurally similar to\ndesire? \nThe debates on the relationship between imagination and desire is, not\nsurprisingly, thoroughly entangled with the debates on the\nrelationship between imagination and belief. One impetus for positing\na conative imaginative attitude comes from behavior motivation in\nimaginative contexts. Tyler Doggett and Andy Egan (2007) argue that\ncognitive and conative imagination jointly output to action-generation\nsystem, in the same way that belief and desire jointly do. Another\nimpetus for positing a conative imaginative attitude comes from\nemotions in imaginative contexts (see related discussions of the\nparadox of fictional emotions and the paradoxes of tragedy and horror\nin\n Supplement on Puzzles and Paradoxes of Imagination and the Arts).\n Gregory Currie and Ian Ravenscroft (2002) and Doggett and Egan (2012)\nargue the best explanation for people’s emotional responses\ntoward non-existent fictional characters call for positing conative\nimagination. Currie and Ravenscroft (2002), Currie (2010), and Doggett\nand Egan (2007) argue that the best explanation for people’s\napparently conflicting emotional responses toward tragedy and horror\ntoo call for positing conative imagination. \nGiven the entanglement between the debates, competing explanations of\nthe same phenomena also function as arguments against conative\nimagination (Nichols 2004a, 2006b; Meskin & Weinberg 2003;\nWeinberg & Meskin 2005, 2006; Spaulding 2015; Kind 2011;\nCarruthers 2003, 2006; Funkhouser & Spaulding 2009; Van Leeuwen\n2011). In addition, another argument against conative imagination is\nthat its different impetuses call for conflicting functional\nproperties. Amy Kind (2016b) notes a tension between the argument from\nbehavior motivation and the argument from fictional emotions: conative\nimagination must be connected to action-generation in order for it to\nexplain pretense behaviors, but it must be disconnected from\naction-generation in order for it to explain fictional emotions.\nSimilarly, Shaun Nichols (2004b) notes a tension between Currie and\nRavenscroft’s (2002) argument from paradox of fictional emotions\nand argument from paradoxes of tragedy and horror. \nTo have a (merely) mental image is to have a perception-like\nexperience triggered by something other than the appropriate external\nstimulus; so, for example, one might have “a picture in the\nmind’s eye or … a tune running through one’s\nhead” (Strawson 1970: 31) in the absence of any corresponding\nvisual or auditory object or event (see the entry on\n mental imagery).\n While it is propositional imagination that gets compared to\nbelief and desire, it is sensory or imagistic\nimagination that get compared to perception (Currie & Ravenscroft\n2002). Although it is possible to form mental images in any of the\nsensory modalities, the bulk of discussion in both philosophical and\npsychological contexts has focused on visual imagery. \nBroadly, there is agreement on the similarity between mental imagery\nand perception in phenomenology, which can be explicated as a\nsimilarity in content (Nanay 2016b; see, for example, Kind 2001; Nanay\n2015; Noordhof 2002). Potential candidates for distinguishing mental\nimagery and perception include intensity (Hume’s Treatise of\nHuman Nature; but see Kind 2017), voluntariness (McGinn 2004;\nIchikawa 2009), causal relationship with the relevant object (Noordhof\n2002); however, no consensus exists on features that clearly\ndistinguish the two, in part because of ongoing debates about\nperception (see the entries on\n contents of perception\n and\n epistemological problems of perception). \nWhat is the relationship between imaginings and mental imagery? \nHistorically, mental imagery is thought to be an essential component\nof imaginings. Aristotle’s phantasia, which is\nsometimes translated as imagination, is a faculty that produces images\n(De Anima; see entry on\n Aristotle’s conception of imagination;\n but see Caston 1996). René Descartes (Meditations on First\nPhilosophy) and David Hume (Treatise of Human Nature)\nboth thought that to imagine just is to hold a mental image, or an\nimpression of perception, in one’s mind. However, George\nBerkeley’s puzzle of visualizing the unseen (Three Dialogues\nbetween Hylas and Philonous) arguably suggests the existence of a\nnon-imagistic hypothetical attitude. \nAgainst the historical orthodoxy, the contemporary tendency is to\nrecognize that there is at least one species of\nimagination—propositional imagination—that does not\nrequire mental imagery. For example, Kendall Walton simply states,\n“imagining can occur without imagery” (1990: 13). In turn, against\nthis contemporary tendency, Amy Kind (2001) argues that an image-based account can\nexplain three crucial features of imagination—directedness,\nactive nature, and phenomenological character—better than its\nimageless counterpart. As a partial reconciliation of the two, Peter Langland-Hassan (2015) develops\na pluralist position on which there exists a variety of imaginative\nattitudes, including ones that can take on hybrid contents that are\npartly propositional and partly sensorily imagistic. (For a nuanced\noverview of this debate, see Gregory 2016: 103–106.) \nFinally, the relationship between mental imagery and perception has\npotential implications for the connection between imagination and\naction. The orthodoxy on propositional belief-like imagination holds\nthat imagination does not directly output to action-generation system;\nrather, the connection between the two is mediated by belief and\ndesire. In contrast, the enactivist program in the philosophy of\nperception holds that perception can directly output to\naction-generation system (see, for example, Nanay 2013). Working from\nthe starting point that imagistic imagination is similar to perception\nin its inclusion of mental imagery, some philosophers have argued for\na similar direct connection between imagistic imagination and\naction-generation system (Langland-Hassan 2015; Nanay 2016a; Van\nLeeuwen 2011, 2016b). That is, there exist imagery-oriented actions\nthat are analogous to perception-oriented actions. For example, Neil\nVan Leeuwen (2011) argues that an account of imagination that is\nimagistically-rich can better explain pretense behaviors than its\npropositional-imagination-only rivals. Furthermore, Robert Eamon Briscoe (2008, 2018) argues that representations that blend inputs from perception and mental imagery, which he calls “make-perceive”, guide many everyday actions. For example, a sculptor might use a blend of the visual perception of a stone and the mental imagery of different parts of the stone being subtracted to guide their physical manipulation of the stone. \nTo remember, roughly, is to represent\nsomething that is no longer the case. On the standard taxonomy, there\nare three types of memory. Nondeclarative memory involves mental\ncontent that is not consciously accessible, such as one’s memory\nof how to ride a bike. Semantic declarative memory involves mental\ncontent that are propositional and not first-personal, such as\none’s memory that Taipei is the capital of Taiwan. Episodic\ndeclarative memory involves mental content about one’s own past,\nsuch as one’s memory of the birth of one’s child. (See\nthe entry on\n memory\n for a detailed discussion of this taxonomy, and especially the\ncriterion of episodicity.) In situating imagination in cognitive\narchitecture, philosophers have typically focused on similarities and\ndifferences between imagination and episodic declarative memory. \nThere are obvious similarities between imagination and memory: both\ntypically involve imagery, both typically concern what is not\npresently the case, and both frequently involve perspectival\nrepresentations. Thomas Hobbes (Leviathan: 2.3) claims that\n“imagination and memory are but one thing, which for diverse\nconsideration has diverse names”. In making this bold statement,\nHobbes represents an extreme version of continuism, a view on which\nimagination and memory refer to the same psychological mechanisms. \nThe orthodoxy on imagination and memory in the history of philosophy,\nhowever, is discontinuism, a view on which there are significant\ndifferences between imagination and memory, even if there are overlaps\nin their psychological mechanisms. Some philosophers find the\ndistinction in internalist factors, such as the\nphenomenological difference between imagining and\nremembering. Most famously, David Hume sought to distinguish the two\nin terms of vivacity—“the ideas of the memory are\nmuch more lively and strong than those of the imagination”\n(Treatise of Human Nature: 1.3; but see Kind 2017). Others\nwho have adopted a phenomenological criterion include René\nDescartes, Bertrand Russell, and William James (De Brigard 2017).\nOther philosophers find the distinction in externalist factors, such\nas the causal connection that exists between memories and the\npast that is absent with imagination. Aristotle uses the causal\nconnection criterion to distinguish between imagination and memory\n(De Anima 451a2; 451a8–12; see De Brigard 2017).\nIndeed, nowadays the idea that a causal connection is essential to\nremembering is accepted as “philosophical common sense”\n(see the entry on\n memory;\n but see also De Brigard 2014 on memory traces). As such, it is\nunsurprising that discontinuism remains the orthodoxy. As J. O. Urmson\n(1967: 83) boldly claims, “One of these universally admitted\ndistinctions is that between memory and imagination”. \nIn recent years, two sets of findings from cognitive science has given\nphilosophers reasons to push back against discontinuism. \nThe first set of findings concern distortions and confabulations. The\ntraditional conception of memory is that it functions as an archive:\npast experiences are encapsulated and stored in the archive, and\nremembering is just passively retrieving the encapsulated mental\ncontent from the archive (Robins 2016). Behavioral psychology has\nfound numerous effects that challenge the empirical adequacy of the\narchival conception of memory. Perhaps the most well-known is the\nmisinformation effect, which occurs when a subject incorporates\ninaccurate information into their memory of an event—even\ninaccurate information that they received after the event (Loftus 1979\n[1996]). \nThe second set of findings concern the psychological underpinnings of\n“mental time travel”, or the similarities between\nremembering the past and imagining the future, which is also known as\nmental time travel (see Schacter et al. 2012 for a review). Using\nfMRI, neuroscientists have found a striking overlap in the brain\nactivities for remembering the past and imagining the future, which\nsuggest that the two psychological processes utilize the same neural\nnetwork (see, for example, Addis et al. 2007; Buckner & Carroll\n2007; Gilbert & Wilson 2007; Schacter et al. 2007; Suddendorf\n& Corballis 1997, 2007). The neuroscientific research is preceded\nby and corroborated by works from developmental psychology (Atance\n& O’Neill 2011) and on neurodivergent individuals: for\nexample, the severely amnesic patient KC exhibits deficits with\nremembering the past and imagining the future (Tulving 1985), and also\nexhibits deficits with the generation of non-personal fictional\nnarratives (Rosenbaum et al. 2009). Note that, despite the evocative\ncontrast between “remembering the past” and\n“imagining the future”, it is questionable whether\ntemporality is the central contrast. Indeed, some philosophers and\npsychologists contend that temporality is orthogonal to the comparison\nbetween imagination and memory (De Brigard & Gessell 2016;\nSchacter et al. 2012). \nThese two set of findings have given rise to an alternative conception\nthat sees memory as essentially constructive, in which remembering is\nactively generating mental content that more or less represent the\npast. The constructive conception of memory is in a better position to\nexplain why memories can contain distortions and confabulations (but\nsee Robins 2016 for complications), and why remembering makes use of\nthe same neural networks as imagining. \nIn turn, this constructive turn in the psychology and philosophy of\nmemory has revived philosophers’ interest in continuism\nconcerning imagination and memory. Kourken Michaelian (2016)\nexplicitly rejects the causal connection criterion and defends a\ntheory on which remembering, like imagining, centrally involves\nsimulation. Karen Shanton and Alvin Goldman (2010) characterizes\nremembering as mindreading one’s past self. Felipe De Brigard\n(2014) characterizes remembering as a special instance of hypothetical\nthinking. Robert Hopkins (2018) characterizes remembering as a kind of\nimagining that is controlled by the past. However, the philosophical\ninterpretation of empirical research remain contested; in dissent,\nDorothea Debus (2014, 2016) considers the same sets of findings but\nultimately concludes that remembering and imagining remain distinct\nmental kinds. \nTo suppose is to form a hypothetical mental representation.\nThere exists a highly contentious debate on whether supposition is\ncontinuous with imagination, which is also a hypothetical attitude, or\nwhether there are enough differences to make them discontinuous. There\nare two main options for distinguishing imagination and supposition,\nby phenomenology and by function. \nThe phenomenological distinction standardly turns on the notion of\nvivacity: whereas imaginings are vivid, suppositions are not. Indeed,\none often finds in this literature the contrast between “merely\nsupposing” and “vividly imagining”. Although\nvivacity has been frequently invoked in discussions of imagination,\nAmy Kind (2017) draws on empirical and theoretical considerations to\nargue that it is ultimately philosophically untenable. If that is\ncorrect, then the attempt to demarcate imagination and supposition by\ntheir vivacity is untenable too. More rarely, other phenomenological\ndifferences are invoked; for example, Brian Weatherson (2004) contends\nthat “supposing can be coarse in a way that imagining\ncannot”. \nTable 1. Architectural similarities and\ndifferences between imagination and supposition (Weinberg & Meskin\n2006). \nThere have been diverse functional distinctions attributed to the\ndiscontinuity between imagination and supposition, but none has gained\nuniversal acceptance. Richard Moran (1994) contends that imagination\ntends to give rise to a wide range of further mental states, including\naffective responses, whereas supposition does not (see also Arcangeli\n2014, 2017). Tamar Szabó Gendler (2000a) contends that while\nattempting to imagine something like that female infanticide is\nmorally right seems to generate imaginative resistance, supposing it\ndoes not (see the discussion on imaginative resistance in\n Supplement on Puzzles and Paradoxes of Imagination and the Arts).\n Gregory Currie and Ian Ravenscroft (2002) contend that supposition\ninvolves only cognitive imagination, but imagination involves both\ncognitive and conative imagination. Alvin Goldman contends that\nsuppositional imagination involves supposing that particular\ncontent obtains (for example, supposing that I am elated) but\nenactment imagination involves “enacting, or trying to\nenact, elation itself.” (2006: 47–48, italics omitted).\nTyler Doggett and Andy Egan (2007) contend that imagination tends to\nmotivate pretense actions, but supposition tends not to. On Jonathan\nWeinberg and Aaron Meskin (2006)’s synthesis, while there are a\nfew functional similarities, there are many more functional\ndifferences between imagination and supposition (Table 1). \nThere remain ongoing debates about specific alleged functional\ndistinctions, and about whether the functional distinctions are\nnumerous or fundamental enough to warrant discontinuism or not.\nIndeed, it remains contentious which philosophers count as continuists\nand which philosophers count as discontinuists (for a few sample\ntaxonomies, see Arcangeli 2017; Balcerak Jackson 2016; Kind 2013). \nMuch of the contemporary discussion of imagination has centered around\nparticular roles that imagination is purported to play in various\ndomains of human understanding and activity. Amongst the most\nwidely-discussed are the role of imagination in understanding other\nminds\n (section 3.1),\n in performing and recognizing pretense\n (section 3.2),\n in characterizing psychopathology\n (section 3.3),\n in engaging with the arts\n (section 3.4),\n in thinking creatively\n (section 3.5),\n in acquiring knowledge about possibilities\n (section 3.6),\n and in interpreting figurative language\n (section 3.7). \nThe variety of roles ascribed to imagination, in turn, provides a\nguide for discussions on the nature of imagination\n (section 1)\n and its place in cognitive architecture\n (section 2). \nMindreading is the activity of attributing mental states to\noneself and to others, and of predicting and explaining behavior on\nthe basis of those attributions. Discussions of mindreading in the\n1990s were often framed as debates between “theory\ntheory”—which holds that the attribution of mental states\nto others is guided by the application of some (tacit) folk\npsychological theory—and “simulation\ntheory”—which holds that the attribution of mental states\nis guided by a process of replicating or emulating the target’s\n(apparent) mental states, perhaps through mechanisms involving the\nimagination. (Influential collections of papers on this debate include\nCarruthers & Smith (eds.) 1996; Davies & Stone (eds.) 1995a,\n1995b.) In recent years, proponents of both sides have increasingly\nconverged on common ground, allowing that both theory and simulation\nplay some role in the attribution of mental states to others (see\nCarruthers 2003; Goldman 2006; Nichols & Stich 2003). Many such\nhybrid accounts include a role for imagination. \nOn theory theory views, mindreading involves the application\nof some (tacit) folk psychological theory that allows the subject to\nmake predictions and offer explanations of the target’s beliefs\nand behaviors. On pure versions of such accounts, imagination plays no\nspecial role in the attribution of mental states to others. (For an\noverview of theory theory, see entry on\n folk psychology as a theory). \nOn simulation theory views, mindreading involves simulating\nthe target’s mental states so as to exploit similarities between\nthe subject’s and target’s processing capacities. It is\nthis simulation that allows the subject to make predictions and offer\nexplanations of the target’s beliefs and behaviors. (For early\npapers, see Goldman 1989; Gordon 1986; Heal 1986; for recent dissent,\nsee, for example, Carruthers 2009; Gallagher 2007; Saxe 2005, 2009;\nfor an overview of simulation theory, see entry on\n folk psychology as mental simulation). \nTraditional versions of simulation theory typically describe\nsimulation using expressions such as “imaginatively putting\noneself in the other’s place”. How this metaphor is\nunderstood depends on the specific account. (A collection of papers\nexploring various versions of simulation theory can be found in Dokic\n& Proust (eds.) 2002.) On many accounts, the projection is assumed\nto involve the subject’s imaginatively running mental processes\n“off-line” that are directly analogous to those being run\n“on-line” by the target (for example Goldman 1989).\nWhereas the “on-line” mental processes are genuine, the\n“off-line” mental processes are merely imagined. For\nexample, a target that is deciding whether to eat sushi for lunch is\nrunning their decision-making processes “on-line”; and a\nsubject that is simulating the target’s decision-making is\nrunning the analogous processes “off-line”—in part,\nby imagining the relevant mental states of the target. Recent\nempirical work in psychology has explored the accuracy of such\nprojections (Markman, Klein, & Suhr (eds.) 2009, section V; Saxe\n2005, 2006, 2009.) \nThough classic simulationist accounts have tended to assume that the\nsimulation process is at least in-principle accessible to\nconsciousness, a number of recent simulation-style accounts appeal to\nneuroscientific evidence suggesting that at least some simulative\nprocesses take place completely unconsciously. On such accounts of\nmindreading, no special role is played by conscious imagination (see\nGoldman 2009; Saxe 2009.) \nMany contemporary views of mindreading are hybrid theory\nviews according to which both theorizing and simulation play a role in\nthe understanding of others’ mental states. Alvin Goldman\n(2006), for example, argues that while mindreading is primarily the\nproduct of simulation, theorizing plays a role in certain cases as\nwell. Many recent discussions have endorsed hybrid views of this sort,\nwith more or less weight given to each of the components in particular\ncases (see Carruthers 2003; Nichols & Stich 2003.) \nA number of philosophers have suggested that the mechanisms underlying\nsubjects’ capacity to engage in mindreading are those that\nenable engagement in pretense behavior (Currie & Ravenscroft 2002;\nGoldman 2006; Nichols & Stich 2003; for an overview of recent\ndiscussions, see Carruthers 2009.) According to such accounts,\nengaging in pretense involves imaginatively taking up perspectives\nother than one’s own, and the ability to do so skillfully may\nrely on—and contribute to—one’s ability to\nunderstand those alternate perspectives (see the entry on\n empathy).\n Partly in light of these considerations, the relative lack of\nspontaneous pretense in children with autistic spectrum disorders is\ntaken as evidence for a link between the skills of pretense and\nempathy. \nPretending is an activity that occurs during diverse\ncircumstances, such as when children make-believe, when criminals\ndeceive, and when thespians act (Langland-Hassan 2014). Although\n“imagination” and “pretense” have been used\ninterchangeably (Ryle 1949), in this section we will use “imagination” to\nrefer to one’s state of mind, and “pretense” to\nrefer to the one’s actions in the world. \nDifferent theories of pretense disagree fundamentally about what it is\nto pretend (see Liao & Gendler 2011 for an overview).\nConsequently, they also disagree about the mental states that enable\none to pretend. Metarepresentational theories hold that\nengaging in pretend play requires the innate mental-state concept\npretend (Baron-Cohen, Leslie, & Frith 1985; Friedman 2013;\nFriedman & Leslie 2007; Leslie 1987, 1994). To pretend is to\nrepresent one’s own representations under the concept pretend.\nBehaviorist theories hold that engaging in pretend play\nrequires a process of behaving-as-if (Harris 1994, 2000; Harris &\nKavanaugh 1993; Jarrold et al. 1994; Lillard & Flavell 1992;\nNichols & Stich 2003; Perner 1991; Rakoczy, Tomasello, &\nStriano 2004; Stich & Tarzia 2015). Different\nbehaviorist theories explicate behaving-as-if in different ways, but\nall aim to provide an account of pretense without recourse to the\ninnate mental-state concept pretend. \nPhilosophical and psychological theories have sought to explain both\nthe performance of pretense and the recognition of\npretense, especially concerning evidence from developmental psychology\n(see Lillard 2001 for an early overview). On the performance side,\nchildren on a standard developmental trajectory exhibit early\nindicators of pretend play around 15 months; engage in explicit\nprop-oriented play by 24 months; and engage in sophisticated joint\npretend play with props by 36 months (Harris 2000; Perner, Baker,\n& Hutton 1994; Piaget 1945 [1951]). On the recognition side,\nchildren on a standard developmental trajectory distinguish pretense\nand reality via instinctual behavioral cues around 15–18 months;\nand start to do so via conventional behavioral cues from 36 months on\n(Friedman et al. 2010; Lillard & Witherington 2004; Onishi &\nBaillargeon 2005; Onishi,\nBaillargeon, & Leslie 2007; Richert and Lillard 2004). \nNot surprisingly, the debate between theories of pretense often rest\non interpretations of such empirical evidence. For example, Ori\nFriedman and Alan Leslie (2007) argue that behavioral theories cannot\naccount for the fact that children as young as 15 months old can\nrecognize pretend play and its normativity (Baillargeon, Scott, &\nHe 2010). Specifically, they argue that behavioral theories do not\noffer straightforward explanations of this early development of\npretense recognition, and incorrectly predicts that children\nsystematically mistake other acts of behaving-as-if—such as\nthose that stem from false beliefs—for pretense activities. In\nresponse, Stephen Stich and Joshua Tarzia (2015) has acknowledged\nthese problems for earlier behaviorist theories, and developed a new\nbehaviorist theory that purportedly explains the totality of empirical\nevidence better than metarepresentational rivals. Importantly, Stich\nand Tarzia argue that their account can better explain Angeline\nLillard (1993)’s empirical finding that young children need not\nattribute a mental concept such as pretend to someone else in order to\nunderstand them as pretending. \nThe debate concerning theories of pretense has implications for the\nrole of imagination in pretense. Behaviorist theories tend to take\nimagination as essential to explaining pretense performance;\nmetarepresentational theories do not. (However, arguably the innate\nmental-state concept pretend posited by metarepresentational theories\nserve similar functions. See Nichols and Stich’s (2000) discussion\nof the decoupler mechanism, which explicitly draws from\nLeslie 1987. Currie and Ravenscroft (2002) give a broadly behaviorist\ntheory of pretense that does not require imagination.) Specifically,\non most behaviorist theories, imagination is essential for guiding\nelaborations of pretense episodes, especially via behaviors (Picciuto\n& Carruthers 2016; Stich & Tarzia 2015). \nMost recently, Peter Langland-Hassan (2012, 2014) has developed a\ntheory that aims to explain pretense behavior and pretense recognition\nwithout appeal to either metarepresentation or imagination.\nLangland-Hassan argues that pretense behaviors can be adequately\nexplained by beliefs, desires, and intentions—including beliefs\nin counterfactuals; and that the difference between pretense and\nsincerity more generally can be adequately characterized in terms of a\nperson’s beliefs, intentions, and desires. While Langland-Hassan\ndoes not deny that pretense is in some sense an imaginative activity,\nhe argues that we do not need to posit a sui generis component of the\nmind to account for it. \nAutism and delusions have been—with much\ncontroversy—characterized as disorders of imagination. That is,\nthe atypical patterns of cognition and behavior associated with each\npsychopathology have been argued to result from atypical functions of\nimagination. \nAutism can be characterized in terms of a trio of\natypicalities often referred to as “Wing’s triad”:\nproblems in typical social competence, communication, and imagination\n(Happé 1994; Wing & Gould 1979). The imaginative aspect of\nautism interacts with other prominent roles of imagination, namely\nmindreading, pretense, and engagement with the arts (Carruthers 2009).\nChildren with autism do not engage in spontaneous pretend play in the\nways that typically-developing children do, engaging instead in\nrepetitive and sometimes obsessional activities; and adults with\nautism often show little interest in fiction (Carpenter, Tomasello,\n& Striano 2005; Happé 1994; Rogers, Cook, & Meryl 2005;\nWing & Gould 1979). The degree to which an imaginative deficit is\nimplicated in autism remains a matter of considerable debate. Most\nradically, Gregory Currie and Ian Ravenscroft (2002) have argued that,\nwith respect to Wing’s triad, problems in typical social\ncompetence and communication are rooted in an inability to engage in\nimaginative activities. \nDelusions can be characterized as belief-like mental\nrepresentations that manifest an unusual degree of disconnectedness\nfrom reality (Bortolotti & Miyazono 2015). Particularly striking\nexamples would include Capgras and Cotard delusions. In the former,\nthe sufferer takes her friends and family to have been replaced by\nimposters; in the latter, the sufferer takes himself to be dead. More\nmundane examples might include ordinary cases of self-deception. \nOne approach to delusions characterize them as beliefs that are\ndysfunctional in their content or formation. (For a representative\ncollection of papers that present and criticize this perspective, see\nColtheart & Davies (eds.) 2000). However, another approach to\ndelusions characterize them as dysfunctions of imaginings. Currie and\nRavenscroft (2002: 170–175) argue that delusions are imaginings\nthat are misidentified by the subject as the result of an inability to\nkeep track of the sources of one’s thoughts. That is, a delusion\nis an imagined representation that is misidentified by the subject as\na belief. Tamar Szabó Gendler (2007) argues that in cases of\ndelusions and self-deceptions, imaginings come to play a role in\none’s cognitive architecture similar to that typically played by\nbeliefs. Andy Egan (2008a) likewise argues that the mental states\ninvolved in delusions are both belief-like (in their connection to\nbehaviors and inferences) and imagination-like (in their\ncircumscription); however, he argues that these functional\nsimilarities suggest the need to posit an in-between attitude called\n“bimagination”. \nThere is an entrenched historical connection between imagination and\nthe arts. David Hume and Immanuel Kant both invoke imagination\ncentrally in their exploration of aesthetic phenomena (albeit in\nradically different ways; see entries on\n Hume’s aesthetics\n and\n Kant’s aesthetics).\n R.G. Collingwood (1938) defines art as the imaginative expression of\nfeeling (Wiltsher 2018; see entry on\n Collingwood’s aesthetics).\n Roger Scruton (1974) develops a Wittgensteinian account of\nimagination and accords it a central role in aesthetic experience and\naesthetic judgment. \nIn contemporary philosophy, the most prominent theory of\nimagination’s role in engagement with the arts is presented in\nKendall Walton’s Mimesis as Make-Believe (1990).\n(Although Walton uses “fictions” as a technical term to\nrefer to artworks, his conception of the arts is broad enough to\ninclude both high-brow and low-brow; popular and obscure; a variety of\nspecific arts such as poetry and videogames; and—as Stacie\nFriend (2008) clarifies—both fictive and non-fictive works.)\nWalton’s core insight is that engagement with the arts is\nfundamentally similar to children’s games of make-believe. When\none engages with an artwork, one uses it as a prop in a make-believe\ngame. As props, artworks generate prescriptions for imaginings. These\nprescriptions also determine the representational contents of artworks\n(that is, “fictionality”, or what is true in a fictional\nworld). When one correctly engages with an artwork, then, one imagines\nthe representational contents as prescribed. \nOut of all the arts, it is the engagement with narratives that\nphilosophers have explored most closely in conjunction with\nimagination (see Stock 2013 for an overview). Gregory Currie (1990)\noffers an influential account of imagination and fiction, and Peter\nLamarque and Stein Haugom Olsen (1996) discuss literature\nspecifically. Indeed, this research program—despite many\ncriticisms of Walton’s specific theory—remains lively\ntoday (see, for example, papers in Nichols (ed.) 2006b). For example, Kathleen Stock (2017) argues that a specific kind of propositional imagination is essential for engagement with fictions. In dissent, Derek Matravers (2014) argues that, contra Walton, imagination is not essential for engagement with fictions.  \nPhilosophers have also done much to articulate the connection between\nimagination and engagement with music (see the entry on\n philosophy of music;\n see also Trivedi 2011). Some philosophers focus on commonalities\nbetween engagement with narratives and engagement with music. For\nexample, even though Walton (1990, 1994a, 1999) acknowledges that\nfictional worlds of music are much more indeterminate than fictional\nworlds of narratives, he maintains that the same kind of imagining\nused in experiencing narratives is also used in experiencing various\nelements of music, such as imagining continuity between movements and\nimagining feeling musical tension. Similarly, Andrew Kania (2015)\nargues that experiencing musical space and movement is imaginative\nlike our experience of fictional narratives. Other philosophers draw\nparallels between engagement with music and other imaginative\nactivities, namely as understanding other minds\n (section 3.1)\n and interpreting metaphor\n (section 3.7).\n As an example of the former, Jerrold Levinson (1996) argues that the\nbest explanation of musical expressiveness requires listeners to\nexperience music imaginatively—specifically, imagining a persona\nexpressing emotions through the music. As an example of the latter,\nScruton (1997) argues that musical experience is informed by spatial\nconcepts applied metaphorically, and so imaginative perception is\nnecessary for musical understanding (but see Budd 2003 for a\ncriticism; see also De Clercq 2007 and Kania 2015). Stephen Davies\n(2005, 2011) and Peter Kivy (2002) notably criticize the imaginative\naccounts of engagement with music on empirical and theoretical\ngrounds. \nOther imaginative accounts of engagement with the arts can be found in entries on\n philosophy of film\n and\n philosophy of dance. \nIndeed, imagination’s aesthetic significance extends beyond the\narts; philosophical aestheticians have recognized the role of\nimagination in appreciating nature (Brady 1998) and in appreciating\nmundane objects, events, and activities (see the entry\non aesthetics of the everyday). \nPhilosophers have sought to clarify the role of imagination in\nengagement with the arts by focusing on a number of puzzles and\nparadoxes in the vicinity. The puzzle of imaginative\nresistance explores apparent limitations on what can be imagined\nduring engagements with the arts and, relatedly, what can be made\nfictional in artworks. The paradox of emotional response to\nfictions (widely known as “paradox of fiction”)\nexamines psychological and normative similarities between affective\nresponses prompted by imaginings versus affective responses by\nreality-directed attitudes. The paradox of tragedy and the\nparadox of horror examine psychological and normative\ndifferences between affective responses prompted by imaginings versus\naffective responses by reality-directed attitudes. Finally, the\npuzzle of moral persuasion is concerned with real-world\noutputs of imaginative engagements with artworks; specifically,\nwhether and how artworks can morally educate or corrupt. For more\ndetail on each of these artistic phenomena, see the\n Supplement on Puzzles and Paradoxes of Imagination and the Arts.\n  \nThe idea that imagination plays a central role in creative processes\ncan be traced back to Immanuel Kant (Critique of Pure\nReason), who takes artistic geniuses as paradigmatic examples of\ncreativity. On Kant’s account, when imagination aims at the\naesthetic, it is allowed to engage in free play beyond the\nunderstanding available to oneself. The unconstrained imagination can\nthereby take raw materials and produce outputs that transcend concepts\nthat one possesses. \nWhile the precise characterization of creativity remains controversial\n(see Gaut & Kieran (eds.) 2018; Paul & Kaufman (eds.) 2014),\ncontemporary philosophers typically conceive of it more broadly than\nKant did. In addition to creative processes in the aesthetic realm,\nthey also consider creative processes in, for example, “science,\ncraft, business, technology, organizational life and everyday\nactivities” (Gaut 2010: 1034; see also Stokes 2011). As an\nexample, Michael Polanyi (1966) gives imagination a central role in\nthe creative endeavor of scientific discovery, by refining and\nnarrowing the solution space to open-ended scientific problems (see\nStokes 2016: 252–256). And, in addition to creative processes of\ngeniuses, contemporary philosophers also consider creative processes\nof ordinary people. \nWith this broadened scope, contemporary philosophers have followed\nKant’s lead in exploring the role of imagination in creativity\n(see Stokes 2016 for an overview). Berys Gaut (2003) and Dustin Stokes\n(2014) argue that two characteristic features of imagination—its\nlack of aim at truth and its dissociation from action—make it\nespecially suitable for creative processes. Peter Carruthers (2002)\nargues that the same cognitive resources, including imagination,\nunderlie children’s pretend play and adults’ creative\nthinking. Specifically, Carruthers hypothesizes that children’s\nplay evolutionarily developed as precursors to and practices for\nadults’ creative thinking. \nThere are two points of disagreement regarding the role of imagination\nin creative processes. First, philosophers disagree about the nature\nand the strength of the connection between imagination and creativity.\nKant takes imagination to be constitutive of creativity: what\nmakes a creative process creative is the involvement of imagination\naiming at the aesthetic (see also A. Hills & Bird forthcoming).\nGaut and Stokes, by contrast, thinks there is only an imperfect\ncausal connection between imagination and creativity: while\nimagination is useful for creative processes, there are creative\nprocesses that do not involve imagination and there are imaginings\nthat are uncreative (see also Beaney 2005). Second, philosophers\ndisagree about the type of imagination involved in creative processes.\nBy hypothesizing a common evolutionary cause, Carruthers suggests that\nthe same imaginative capacity is involved in pretense and in\ncreativity. By contrast, perhaps echoing Kant’s distinction of\nproductive versus reproductive imagination, Currie and Ravenscroft\n(2002) sharply distinguish recreative imagination, which is involved\nin pretense and mindreading, from creative imagination. \nImagination plays a role in the acquisition of knowledge. Many\nphilosophical arguments call on imagination when they appeal to\nmetaphysical modal knowledge (see the entry on\n epistemology of modality;\n the papers collected in Gendler & Hawthorne (eds.) 2002; and Kung\n2016 and Strohminger & Yli-Vakkuri 2017 for overviews). The kind\nof thought experiments that are regularly used in scientific\ntheorizing is also plausibly premised on imaginative capacities (see\nthe entry on\n thought experiments).\n As already discussed, people use imagination to understand the\nperspectives of others\n (section 3.1).\n Moreover, people often make decisions via thinking about\ncounterfactuals, or what would happen if things had been different\nfrom how they in fact are (see the entries on\n causation\n and\n counterfactual conditionals).\n However, the phenomenon of transformative experience has recently\ncalled into question which kind of imaginary scenarios are truly\nepistemically accessible. (For a representative collection of papers\nthat explore different epistemic roles of imagination, see Kind &\nKung (eds.) 2016a.) \nBroadly speaking, thought experiments use imaginary scenarios to\nelicit responses that (ideally) grant people knowledge of\npossibilities. A special, but prominent, type of thought experiment in\nphilosophy concerns the link between imagination, conceivability, and\nmetaphysical possibility. René Descartes famously offered a\nmodal argument in the Sixth Meditation, reasoning\nfrom the fact that he could clearly and distinctly conceive of his\nmind and body as distinct to the real distinctness between them. The\ncurrent prevalence of similar modal arguments can be verified by\nentries on\n zombies\n and\n dualism.\n These modal arguments all rely, in some way, on the idea that what\none can imagine functions as a fallible and defeasible guide to what\nis really possible in the broadest sense. \nPessimists, notably Peter Van Inwagen (1998: 70), doubt that\nimagination can give us an accurate understanding of scenarios that\nare “remote from the practical business of everyday life”,\nsuch as those called upon in philosophical modal arguments. Optimists\ntypically take it as a given that there is some connection between\nimagination and metaphysical modal knowledge, but focus on\nunderstanding where the connection is imperfect, such as when one\n(apparently) imagines the impossible. To just give a few examples,\nSaul Kripke (1972 [1980]), Stephen Yablo (1993), David Chalmers\n(2002), Dominic Gregory (2004), Timothy\nWilliamson (2007, 2016), Peter Kung (2010), and Magdalena Balcerak Jackson (2018) have each developed a distinctive approach to\nthis task. For example, Kripke adopts a redescription approach to\nmodeling (some) modal errors: in some cases where one is apparently\nimagining the impossible, one is in fact imagining a possible scenario\nbut misconstruing it as an impossible one. On this diagnosis, in such\ncases, the error resides not with imaginative capacities, but with the\ncapacity to describe one’s own imaginings. \nOther thought experiments are scoped more narrowly; for example,\nscientific thought experiments are intended to allow people to explore\nnomic possibilities. Galileo (On Motion) famously offered a\nthought experiment that disproved Aristotle’s theory of motion,\nwhich predicts that heavier objects fall more quickly. In this thought\nexperiment, Galileo asked people to imagine the falling of a composite\nof a light and heavy object versus the falling of the heavy object\nalone. When one runs the thought experiment—that is, when one\nelaborates on the starting point of this imaginary scenario—one\nnotices an incoherence in Aristotle’s theory: on the one hand,\nit should predict that the composite would fall more slowly because\nthe light object would slow down the heavy object; on the other hand,\nit should also predict that the composite would fall more quickly\nbecause the composite is heavier than the heavy object alone. While it\nis incontrovertible that imagination is central to thought\nexperiments, debates remain on whether imagination can be invoked in\nthe context of justification (Gendler 2000b; Williamson 2016) or only\nin the context of discovery (Norton 1991, 1996; Spaulding 2016). \nThe role of imagination in counterfactual reasoning—and, in\nparticular, the question of what tends to be held constant when one\ncontemplates counterfactual scenarios—has been explored in\ndetail in recent philosophical and psychological works (Byrne 2005;\nWilliamson 2005, 2007, 2016). Williamson suggests that  \nWhen we work out what would have happened if such-and-such had been\nthe case, we frequently cannot do it without imagining such-and-such\nto be the case and letting things run. (2005: 19)  \nIt is imagination that lets one move from counterfactuals’\nantecedents to their consequents. Williamson (2016) argues that our\nimaginings have evolved to be suitably constrained, such that such\ncounterfactual reasoning can confer knowledge. Indeed, he argues that\nif one were to be skeptical about gaining knowledge from such a\nhypothetical reasoning process, then one would be forced to be\n(implausibly) skeptical about much of ordinary reasoning about\nactuality. Developing an idea anticipated by Williamson (2007), Margot\nStrohminger and Juhani Yli-Vakkuri (forthcoming) argue that the same\nimaginative mechanisms that capable of producing metaphysical modal\nknowledge are also capable of producing knowledge of other restricted\nmodalities, such as nomic and practical modality. In parallel, Amy Kind (2016c, 2018) argues that imaginings can confer knowledge when they are guided by reality-sensitive constraints, in a manner akin to computer simulations. \nThinking about counterfactuals is just one way that imagination can\nfactor into mundane decision-making. Neil Van Leeuwen (2011, 2016a,\n2016b) and Bence Nanay (2016a) have recently started to elaborate on the connection\nbetween imagination and actions via decision-making. Although neither\nauthors focus on the epistemic status of imagination, their accounts\nof decision-making seem to suggest that imagination is used to gain\npractical knowledge about the probability and value of actions’\npossible outcomes. \nAt the same time, the recently prominent discussion of transformative\nexperiences calls into question the extent to which imagination can be\nepistemically useful for making life-altering decisions. L.A. Paul\n(2014, 2015, 2018; see also Jackson 1982, 1986; D. Lewis 1988) argues\nthat some types of knowledge—especially de se knowledge\nconcerning one’s values—are inaccessible by imaginings;\nonly actual experiences can confer these types of knowledge. For\nexample, one cannot really know whether one wants to become a parent\nwithout experiencing being a parent because parenthood itself can\ntransform one’s values. If one cannot reasonably imagine oneself\nwith radically different values, then plausibly one cannot\nappropriately imagine the values associated with the outcomes of\none’s actions. As such, despite their epistemic worth in\nordinary contexts, imaginings might not help in making life-altering\ndecisions. \nFinally, imagination might play a role in interpreting figurative\nlanguage. The exact role ascribed to imagination varies greatly from\ntheory to theory. In part, this variation arose from a longstanding\ndebate in philosophy of language concerning the divide between literal\nand figurative language: while some imaginative theories of figurative\nlanguage (such as Walton 1990) accept a strong divide, others (such as\nLepore & Stone 2015) reject it. Although this controversy cannot\nbe avoided entirely, it is worth reiterating that the present aim is\nonly to highlight the possible role(s) that imagination might play in\nthe psychology of irony, metaphor, and nearby linguistic\nphenomena. \nDespite immense differences between them, numerous theories of irony\nhave converged on the idea that interpreting irony involves\nimagination. Kendall Walton (1990) treats ironic and metaphoric speech\nas props in momentary games of make-believe. On Walton’s theory,\nimagination is central to understanding and interpreting such\nfigurative speech. Herbert Clark and Richard Gerrig (1984) and Gregory\nCurrie (2006) connect irony to pretense, but without further linking\nall cases of pretense to imaginative capacities. Elisabeth Camp (2012)\nsimilarly endorses a role for pretense in the interpretation of irony\nand the related case of sarcasm. Finally, this idea that interpreting\nirony involves imagination is corroborated by psychological research:\nirony recognition is difficult for neurodivergent individuals who lack\nimaginative capacities (Happé 1991)—specifically, in\nindividuals with Asperger’s syndrome, who have deficits with\nmeta-representation—and in individuals with schizophrenia, who\nhave deficits with theory-of-mind (Langdon et al. 2002). \nAgain, despite immense differences between them, numerous theories of\nmetaphor have also converged on the idea that interpreting metaphor\ninvolves imagination (see the entry on\n metaphor).\n The first family of theories focus on imagination’s role in\npretense. As mentioned earlier, Walton (1990) takes metaphors to be\nprops in momentary games of make-believe. Walton (1993, 2000) and\nDavid Hills (1997) further develop this idea. (Importantly, Walton\n(1993) notes that interpretation of a metaphor may not involve actual\nimaginings, but only the recognition of the type of imaginings\nprescribed.) Andy Egan (2008b) extends the idea to account for idioms.\nThese theories remain controversial: in particular, Camp (2009) and\nCatherine Wearing (2011) have offered forceful criticisms. The second\nfamily of theories focus on imagination’s role in providing\nnovel perspectives. While Camp (2009) criticizes the first family of\ntheories, she also acknowledges a role for imagination. On her\naccount, pretense and metaphor typically involve distinct types of\nimaginings: pretense-imaginings allow one to access counterfactual\ncontent, but metaphor-imaginings allow one to re-interpret actual\ncontent from a novel perspective. Indeed Camp (2007) argues that the\nkind of imagination involved in interpreting metaphors is also used to\ninterpret similes and juxtapositions. The third family of theories\nfocus on imagination’s role in providing mental images. Paul\nRicoeur (1978), Richard Moran (1989), and Robyn Carston (2010) all\npropose theories on which mental imagery plays an important role in\nprocessing metaphors. Outside of philosophy of language, James Grant\n(2011) argues that metaphors are prevalent in art criticism because\nthey prompt readers’ imaginings.","contact.mail":"liao.shen.yi@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"},{"date.published":"2011-03-14","date.changed":"2019-01-22","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/imagination/","author1":"Shen-yi Liao","author2":"Tamar Gendler","author1.info":"http://liao.shen-yi.org","entry":"imagination","body.text":"\n\nTo imagine is to represent without aiming at things as they actually, presently, and subjectively are. One\ncan use imagination to represent possibilities other than the actual,\nto represent times other than the present, and to represent\nperspectives other than one’s own. Unlike perceiving and\nbelieving, imagining something does not require one to consider that\nsomething to be the case. Unlike desiring or anticipating, imagining\nsomething does not require one to wish or expect that something to be\nthe case.\n\n\nImagination is involved in a wide variety of human activities, and has\nbeen explored from a wide range of philosophical perspectives.\nPhilosophers of mind have examined imagination’s role in\nmindreading and in pretense. Philosophical aestheticians have examined\nimagination’s role in creating and in engaging with different\ntypes of artworks. Epistemologists have examined imagination’s\nrole in theoretical thought experiments and in practical\ndecision-making. Philosophers of language have examined\nimagination’s role in irony and metaphor.\n\n\nBecause of the breadth of the topic, this entry focuses exclusively on\ncontemporary discussions of imagination in the Anglo-American\nphilosophical tradition. For an overview of historical discussions of\nimagination, see the sections on pre-twentieth century and early\ntwentieth century accounts of entry on\n mental imagery;\n for notable historical accounts of imagination, see corresponding\nentries on\n Aristotle,\n Thomas Hobbes,\n David Hume,\n Immanuel Kant, and\n Gilbert Ryle;\n for a more detailed and comprehensive historical survey, see Brann\n1991; and for a sophisticated and wide-ranging discussion of\nimagination in the phenomenological tradition, see Casey 2000.\n\nA variety of roles have been attributed to imagination across various\ndomains of human understanding and activity\n (section 3).\n Not surprisingly, it is doubtful that there is one component of the\nmind that can satisfy all the various roles attributed to imagination\n(Kind 2013). Nevertheless, perhaps guided by these roles, philosophers\nhave attempted to clarify the nature of imagination in three ways.\nFirst, philosophers have tried to disambiguate different senses of the\nterm “imagination” and, in some cases, point to some core\ncommonalities amongst the different disambiguations\n (section 1.1).\n Second, philosophers have given partial taxonomies to distinguish\ndifferent types of imaginings\n (section 1.2).\n Third, philosophers have located norms that govern paradigmatic\nimaginative episodes\n (section 1.3). \nThere is a general consensus among those who work on the topic that\nthe term “imagination” is used too broadly to\npermit simple taxonomy. Indeed, it is common for overviews to begin\nwith an invocation of P.F. Strawson’s remarks in\n“Imagination and Perception”, where he writes: \nThe uses, and applications, of the terms “image”,\n“imagine”, “imagination”, and so forth make up\na very diverse and scattered family. Even this image of a family seems\ntoo definite. It would be a matter of more than difficulty to identify\nand list the family’s members, let alone their relations of\nparenthood and cousinhood. (Strawson 1970: 31) \nThese taxonomic challenges carry over into attempts at\ncharacterization. In the opening chapter of Mimesis as\nMake-Believe—perhaps the most influential contemporary\nmonograph on imagination—Kendall Walton throws up his hands at\nthe prospect of delineating the notion precisely. After enumerating\nand distinguishing a number of paradigmatic instances of imagining, he\nasks: \nWhat is it to imagine? We have examined a number of dimensions along\nwhich imaginings can vary; shouldn’t we now spell out what they\nhave in common?—Yes, if we can. But I can’t. (Walton 1990:\n19) \nLeslie Stevenson (2003: 238) makes arguably the only recent attempt at\na somewhat comprehensive inventory of the term’s uses, covering\ntwelve of “the most influential conceptions of\nimagination” that can be found in recent discussions in\n“philosophy of mind, aesthetics, ethics, poetry and …\nreligion”. \nTo describe the varieties of imaginings, philosophers have given\npartial and overlapping taxonomies. \nSome taxonomies are merely descriptive, and they tend to be less\ncontroversial. For example, Kendall Walton (1990) distinguishes\nbetween spontaneous and deliberate imagining (acts\nof imagination that occur with or without the one’s conscious\ndirection); between occurrent and nonoccurrent\nimaginings (acts of imagination that do or do not occupy the\none’s explicit attention); and between social and\nsolitary imaginings (episodes of imagining that occur with or\nwithout the joint participation of several persons). \nOne notable descriptive taxonomy concerns imagining from the\ninside versus from the outside (Williams 1973; Wollheim\n1973; see Ninan 2016 for an overview). To imagine from the outside\nthat one is Napoleon involves imagining a scenario in which one is\nNapoleon. To imagine from the inside that one is Napoleon involves\nthat plus something else: namely, that one is occupying the\nperspective of Napoleon. Imagining from the inside is\nessentially first-personal, imagining from the outside is not. This\ndistinction between two modes of imagining is especially notable for\nits implications for thought experiments about the metaphysics of\npersonal identity (Nichols 2008; Ninan 2009; Williams 1973). \nSome taxonomies aim to be more systematic—to carve imaginings at\ntheir joints, so to speak—and they, as one might expect, tend to\nbe more controversial. \nGregory Currie and Ian Ravenscroft (2002) distinguishes creative\nimagination (combining ideas in unexpected and unconventional\nways); sensory imagination (perception-like experiences in\nthe absence of appropriate stimuli); and what they call recreative\nimagination (an ability to experience or think about the world\nfrom a perspective different from the one that experience presents).\nNeil Van Leeuwen (2013, 2014) takes a similar approach to delineate\nthree common uses of “imagination” and cognate terms.\nFirst, these terms can be used to refer to constructive\nimagining, which concerns the process of generating mental\nrepresentations. Second, these terms can be used to refer to\nattitude imagining, which concerns the propositional attitude\none takes toward mental representations. Third, these terms can be\nused to refer to imagistic imagining, which concerns the\nperception-like format of mental representations. \nAmy Kind and Peter Kung (2016b) pose the puzzle of imaginative\nuse—on the seeming irreconcilability between the\ntranscendent uses of imagination, which enables one to escape\nfrom or look beyond the world as it is, and the instructive\nuses of imagination, which enables one to learn about the world as it\nis. Kind and Kung ultimately resolve the puzzle by arguing that the\nsame attitude can be put to these seemingly disparate uses because the\ntwo uses differ not in kind, but in degree—specifically, the\ndegree of constraint on imaginings. \nFinally, varieties of imagination might be classified in terms of\ntheir structure and content. Consider the following three types of\nimaginings, each illustrated with an example. When one imagines\npropositionally, one represents to oneself that something is the\ncase. So, for example, Juliet might imagine that Romeo is by her\nside. To imagine in this sense is to stand in some mental\nrelation to a particular proposition (see the entry on\n propositional attitude reports).\n When one imagines objectually, one represents to oneself a\nreal or make-believe entity or situation (Yablo 1993; see also Martin\n2002; Noordhof 2002; O’Shaughnessy 2000). So, for example,\nProspero might imagine an acorn or a nymph or\nthe city of Naples or a wedding feast. To imagine in\nthis sense is to stand in some mental relation to a representation of\nan (imaginary or real) entity or state of affairs. When one\nimagines X-ing, one simulatively represents to oneself some\nsort of activity or experience (Walton 1990). So, for example, Ophelia\nmight imagine seeing Hamlet or getting herself to a\nnunnery. To imagine in this sense is to stand in a first-personal\nmental relation to some (imaginary or real) behavior or\nperception. \nThere are general norms that govern operations of imagination (Gendler\n2003). \nMirroring is manifest to the extent that features of the\nimaginary situation that have not been explicitly stipulated are\nderivable via features of their real-world analogues, or, more\ngenerally, to the extent that imaginative content is taken to be\ngoverned by the same sorts of restrictions that govern believed\ncontent. For example, in a widely-discussed experiment conducted by\nAlan Leslie (1994), children are asked to engage in an imaginary tea\nparty. When an experimenter tips and “spills” one of the\n(empty) teacups, children consider the non-tipped cup to be\n“full” (in the context of the pretense) and the tipped cup\nto be “empty” (both within and outside of the context of\nthe pretense). In fact, both make-believe games and more complicated\nengagements with the arts are governed by principles of\ngeneration, according to which prompts or props prescribe\nparticular imaginings (Walton 1990). \nQuarantining is manifest to the extent that events within the\nimagined or pretended episode are taken to have effects only within a\nrelevantly circumscribed domain. So, for example, the child engaging\nin the make-believe tea party does not expect that\n“spilling” (imaginary) “tea” will result in\nthe table really being wet, nor does a person who imagines\nwinning the lottery expect that when she visits the ATM, her bank\naccount will contain a million dollars. More generally, quarantining\nis manifest to the extent that proto-beliefs and proto-attitudes\nconcerning the imagined state of affairs are not treated as beliefs\nand attitudes relevant to guiding action in the actual world. \nAlthough imaginative episodes are generally governed by mirroring and\nquarantining, both may be violated in systematic ways. \nMirroring gives way to disparity as a result of the ways in\nwhich (the treatment of) imaginary content may differ from (that of)\nbelieved content. Imagined content may be incomplete (for\nexample, there may be no fact of the matter (in the pretense) just how\nmuch tea has spilled on the table) or incoherent (for\nexample, it might be that the toaster serves (in the pretense) as a\nlogical-truth inverter). And content that is imagined may give rise to\ndiscrepant responses, most strikingly in cases of discrepant\naffect—where, for example, the imminent destruction of all human\nlife is treated as amusing rather than terrifying. \nQuarantining gives way to contagion when imagined content\nends up playing a direct role in actual attitudes and behavior (see\nalso Gendler 2008a, 2008b). This is common in cases of affective\ntransmission, where an emotional response generated by an\nimagined situation may constrain subsequent behavior. For example,\nimagining something fearful (such as a tiger in the kitchen) may give\nrise to actual hesitation (such as reluctance to enter the room). And\nit also occurs in cases of cognitive transmission, where\nimagined content is thereby “primed” and rendered more\naccessible in ways that go on to shape subsequent perception and\nexperience. For example, imagining some object (such as a sheep) may\nmake one more likely to “perceive” such objects in\none’s environment (such as mistaking a rock for a ram). \nOne way to make sense of the nature of imagination is by drawing\ndistinctions, giving taxonomies, and elucidating governing norms\n (section 1).\n Another, arguably more prominent, way to make sense of the nature is\nby figuring out, in a broadly functionalist framework, how it fits in\nwith more well-understood mental entities from folk psychology and\nscientific psychology (see the entry on\n functionalism). \nThere are two related tasks involved. First, philosophers have used\nother mental entities to define imagination by contradistinction (but\nsee Wiltsher forthcoming for a critique of this approach). To give an\noversimplified example, many philosophers hold that imagining is like\nbelieving except that it does not directly motivate actions. Second,\nphilosophers have used other mental entities to understand the inputs\nand outputs of imagination. To give an oversimplified example, many\nphilosophers hold that imagination does not output to\naction-generating systems. \nAmongst the most widely-discussed mental entities in contemporary\ndiscussions of imagination are belief\n (section 2.1),\n desire\n (section 2.2),\n mental imagery\n (section 2.3),\n memory\n (section 2.4),\n and supposition\n (section 2.5).\n The resolution of these debates ultimately rest on the extent to\nwhich the imaginative attitude(s) posited can fulfill the roles\nascribed to imagination from various domains of human understanding\nand activity\n (section 3). \nTo believe is to take something to be the case or regard it\nas true (see the entry on\n belief).\n When one says something like “the liar believes that his pants\nare on fire”, one attributes to the subject (the liar) an\nattitude (belief) towards a proposition (his pants are on fire).\nLikewise, when one says something like “the liar imagines that\nhis pants are on fire”, one attributes to the subject (the liar)\nan attitude (imagination) towards a proposition (his pants are on\nfire). The similarities and differences between the belief attribution\nand the imagination attribution point to similarities and differences\nbetween imagining and believing.  \nImagining and believing are both cognitive attitudes that are\nrepresentational. They take on the same kind of content:\nrepresentations that stand in inferential relationship with one\nanother. On the single code hypothesis, it is the sameness of\nthe representational format that grounds functional similarities\nbetween imagining and believing (Nichols & Stich 2000, 2003;\nNichols 2004a). As for their differences, there are two main options\nfor distinguishing imagining and believing (Sinhababu 2016). \nThe first option characterizes their difference in normative terms.\nWhile belief aims at truth, imagination does not (Humberstone\n1992; Shah & Velleman 2005). If the liar did not regard it as true\nthat his pants are on fire, then it seems that he cannot really\nbelieve that his pants are on fire. By contrast, even if the liar did\nnot regard it as true that his pants are on fire, he can still imagine\nthat his pants are on fire. While the norm of truth is constitutive of\nthe attitude of belief, it is not constitutive of the attitude of\nimagination. In dissent, Neil Sinhababu (2013) argues that the norm of\ntruth is neither sufficient nor necessary for distinguishing imagining\nand believing. \nThe second option characterizes their difference in functional terms.\nOne purported functional difference between imagination and belief\nconcerns their characteristic connection to actions. If the liar truly\nbelieves that his pants are on fire, he will typically attempt to put\nout the fire by, say, pouring water on himself. By contrast, if the\nliar merely imagines that his pants are on fire, he will typically do\nno such thing. While belief outputs to action-generation system,\nimagination does not (Nichols & Stich 2000, 2003). David Velleman\n(2000) and Tyler Doggett and Andy Egan (2007) point to particular\npretense behaviors to challenge this way of distinguishing imagining\nand believing. Velleman argues that a belief-desire explanation of\nchildren’s pretense behaviors makes children “depressingly\nunchildlike”. Doggett and Egan argue that during immersive\nepisodes, pretense behaviors can be directly motivated by imagination.\nIn response to these challenges, philosophers typically accept that\nimagination can have a guidance or stage-setting role in motivating\nbehaviors, but reject that it directly outputs to action-generation\nsystem (Van Leeuwen 2009; O’Brien 2005; Funkhouser &\nSpaulding 2009; Everson 2007; Kind 2011; Currie & Ravenscroft\n2002). \nAnother purported functional difference between imagination and belief\nconcerns their characteristic connection to emotions. If the liar\ntruly believes that his pants are on fire, then he will be genuinely\nafraid of the fire; but not if he merely imagines so. While belief\nevokes genuine emotions toward real entities, imagination does not\n(Walton 1978, 1990, 1997; see also related discussion of the paradox\nof fictional emotions in\n Supplement on Puzzles and Paradoxes of Imagination and the Arts).\n This debate is entangled with the controversy concerning the nature\nof emotions (see the entry on\n emotion).\n In rejecting this purported functional difference, philosophers also\ntypically reject narrow cognitivism about emotions (Nichols 2004a;\nMeskin & Weinberg 2003; Weinberg & Meskin 2005, 2006; Kind\n2011; Spaulding 2015; Carruthers 2003, 2006). \nCurrently, the consensus is that there exists some important\ndifference between imagining and believing. Yet, there are two\ndistinct departures from this consensus. On the one hand, some\nphilosophers have pointed to novel psychological phenomena in which it\nis unclear whether imagination or belief is at work—such as\ndelusions (Egan 2008a) and immersed pretense (Schellenberg\n2013)—and argued that the best explanation for these phenomena\nsays that imagination and belief exists on a continuum. In responding\nto the argument from immersed pretense, Shen-yi Liao and Tyler Doggett\n(2014) argue that a cognitive architecture that collapses distinctive\nattitudes on the basis of borderline cases is unlikely to be fruitful\nin explaining psychological phenomena. On the other hand, some\nphilosophers have pointed to familiar psychological phenomena and\nargued that the best explanation for these phenomena says that\nimagination is ultimately reducible to belief. Peter Langland-Hassan\n(2012, 2014) argues that pretense can be explained with only reference\nto beliefs—specifically, beliefs about counterfactuals. Derek\nMatravers (2014) argues that engagements with fictions can be\nexplained without references to imaginings. \nTo desire is to want something to be the case (see the entry on\n desire).\n Standardly, the conative attitude of desire is contrasted\nwith the cognitive attitude of belief in terms of direction\nof fit: while belief aims to make one’s mental representations\nmatch the way the world is, desire aims to make the way the world is\nmatch one’s mental representations. Recall that on the\nsingle code hypothesis, there exists a cognitive imaginative\nattitude that is structurally similar to belief. Is there a conative\nimaginative attitude—call it desire-like imagination\n(Currie 1997, 2002a, 2002b, 2010; Currie & Ravenscroft 2002),\nmake-desire (Currie 1990; Goldman 2006), or i-desire\n(Doggett & Egan 2007, 2012)—that is structurally similar to\ndesire? \nThe debates on the relationship between imagination and desire is, not\nsurprisingly, thoroughly entangled with the debates on the\nrelationship between imagination and belief. One impetus for positing\na conative imaginative attitude comes from behavior motivation in\nimaginative contexts. Tyler Doggett and Andy Egan (2007) argue that\ncognitive and conative imagination jointly output to action-generation\nsystem, in the same way that belief and desire jointly do. Another\nimpetus for positing a conative imaginative attitude comes from\nemotions in imaginative contexts (see related discussions of the\nparadox of fictional emotions and the paradoxes of tragedy and horror\nin\n Supplement on Puzzles and Paradoxes of Imagination and the Arts).\n Gregory Currie and Ian Ravenscroft (2002) and Doggett and Egan (2012)\nargue the best explanation for people’s emotional responses\ntoward non-existent fictional characters call for positing conative\nimagination. Currie and Ravenscroft (2002), Currie (2010), and Doggett\nand Egan (2007) argue that the best explanation for people’s\napparently conflicting emotional responses toward tragedy and horror\ntoo call for positing conative imagination. \nGiven the entanglement between the debates, competing explanations of\nthe same phenomena also function as arguments against conative\nimagination (Nichols 2004a, 2006b; Meskin & Weinberg 2003;\nWeinberg & Meskin 2005, 2006; Spaulding 2015; Kind 2011;\nCarruthers 2003, 2006; Funkhouser & Spaulding 2009; Van Leeuwen\n2011). In addition, another argument against conative imagination is\nthat its different impetuses call for conflicting functional\nproperties. Amy Kind (2016b) notes a tension between the argument from\nbehavior motivation and the argument from fictional emotions: conative\nimagination must be connected to action-generation in order for it to\nexplain pretense behaviors, but it must be disconnected from\naction-generation in order for it to explain fictional emotions.\nSimilarly, Shaun Nichols (2004b) notes a tension between Currie and\nRavenscroft’s (2002) argument from paradox of fictional emotions\nand argument from paradoxes of tragedy and horror. \nTo have a (merely) mental image is to have a perception-like\nexperience triggered by something other than the appropriate external\nstimulus; so, for example, one might have “a picture in the\nmind’s eye or … a tune running through one’s\nhead” (Strawson 1970: 31) in the absence of any corresponding\nvisual or auditory object or event (see the entry on\n mental imagery).\n While it is propositional imagination that gets compared to\nbelief and desire, it is sensory or imagistic\nimagination that get compared to perception (Currie & Ravenscroft\n2002). Although it is possible to form mental images in any of the\nsensory modalities, the bulk of discussion in both philosophical and\npsychological contexts has focused on visual imagery. \nBroadly, there is agreement on the similarity between mental imagery\nand perception in phenomenology, which can be explicated as a\nsimilarity in content (Nanay 2016b; see, for example, Kind 2001; Nanay\n2015; Noordhof 2002). Potential candidates for distinguishing mental\nimagery and perception include intensity (Hume’s Treatise of\nHuman Nature; but see Kind 2017), voluntariness (McGinn 2004;\nIchikawa 2009), causal relationship with the relevant object (Noordhof\n2002); however, no consensus exists on features that clearly\ndistinguish the two, in part because of ongoing debates about\nperception (see the entries on\n contents of perception\n and\n epistemological problems of perception). \nWhat is the relationship between imaginings and mental imagery? \nHistorically, mental imagery is thought to be an essential component\nof imaginings. Aristotle’s phantasia, which is\nsometimes translated as imagination, is a faculty that produces images\n(De Anima; see entry on\n Aristotle’s conception of imagination;\n but see Caston 1996). René Descartes (Meditations on First\nPhilosophy) and David Hume (Treatise of Human Nature)\nboth thought that to imagine just is to hold a mental image, or an\nimpression of perception, in one’s mind. However, George\nBerkeley’s puzzle of visualizing the unseen (Three Dialogues\nbetween Hylas and Philonous) arguably suggests the existence of a\nnon-imagistic hypothetical attitude. \nAgainst the historical orthodoxy, the contemporary tendency is to\nrecognize that there is at least one species of\nimagination—propositional imagination—that does not\nrequire mental imagery. For example, Kendall Walton simply states,\n“imagining can occur without imagery” (1990: 13). In turn, against\nthis contemporary tendency, Amy Kind (2001) argues that an image-based account can\nexplain three crucial features of imagination—directedness,\nactive nature, and phenomenological character—better than its\nimageless counterpart. As a partial reconciliation of the two, Peter Langland-Hassan (2015) develops\na pluralist position on which there exists a variety of imaginative\nattitudes, including ones that can take on hybrid contents that are\npartly propositional and partly sensorily imagistic. (For a nuanced\noverview of this debate, see Gregory 2016: 103–106.) \nFinally, the relationship between mental imagery and perception has\npotential implications for the connection between imagination and\naction. The orthodoxy on propositional belief-like imagination holds\nthat imagination does not directly output to action-generation system;\nrather, the connection between the two is mediated by belief and\ndesire. In contrast, the enactivist program in the philosophy of\nperception holds that perception can directly output to\naction-generation system (see, for example, Nanay 2013). Working from\nthe starting point that imagistic imagination is similar to perception\nin its inclusion of mental imagery, some philosophers have argued for\na similar direct connection between imagistic imagination and\naction-generation system (Langland-Hassan 2015; Nanay 2016a; Van\nLeeuwen 2011, 2016b). That is, there exist imagery-oriented actions\nthat are analogous to perception-oriented actions. For example, Neil\nVan Leeuwen (2011) argues that an account of imagination that is\nimagistically-rich can better explain pretense behaviors than its\npropositional-imagination-only rivals. Furthermore, Robert Eamon Briscoe (2008, 2018) argues that representations that blend inputs from perception and mental imagery, which he calls “make-perceive”, guide many everyday actions. For example, a sculptor might use a blend of the visual perception of a stone and the mental imagery of different parts of the stone being subtracted to guide their physical manipulation of the stone. \nTo remember, roughly, is to represent\nsomething that is no longer the case. On the standard taxonomy, there\nare three types of memory. Nondeclarative memory involves mental\ncontent that is not consciously accessible, such as one’s memory\nof how to ride a bike. Semantic declarative memory involves mental\ncontent that are propositional and not first-personal, such as\none’s memory that Taipei is the capital of Taiwan. Episodic\ndeclarative memory involves mental content about one’s own past,\nsuch as one’s memory of the birth of one’s child. (See\nthe entry on\n memory\n for a detailed discussion of this taxonomy, and especially the\ncriterion of episodicity.) In situating imagination in cognitive\narchitecture, philosophers have typically focused on similarities and\ndifferences between imagination and episodic declarative memory. \nThere are obvious similarities between imagination and memory: both\ntypically involve imagery, both typically concern what is not\npresently the case, and both frequently involve perspectival\nrepresentations. Thomas Hobbes (Leviathan: 2.3) claims that\n“imagination and memory are but one thing, which for diverse\nconsideration has diverse names”. In making this bold statement,\nHobbes represents an extreme version of continuism, a view on which\nimagination and memory refer to the same psychological mechanisms. \nThe orthodoxy on imagination and memory in the history of philosophy,\nhowever, is discontinuism, a view on which there are significant\ndifferences between imagination and memory, even if there are overlaps\nin their psychological mechanisms. Some philosophers find the\ndistinction in internalist factors, such as the\nphenomenological difference between imagining and\nremembering. Most famously, David Hume sought to distinguish the two\nin terms of vivacity—“the ideas of the memory are\nmuch more lively and strong than those of the imagination”\n(Treatise of Human Nature: 1.3; but see Kind 2017). Others\nwho have adopted a phenomenological criterion include René\nDescartes, Bertrand Russell, and William James (De Brigard 2017).\nOther philosophers find the distinction in externalist factors, such\nas the causal connection that exists between memories and the\npast that is absent with imagination. Aristotle uses the causal\nconnection criterion to distinguish between imagination and memory\n(De Anima 451a2; 451a8–12; see De Brigard 2017).\nIndeed, nowadays the idea that a causal connection is essential to\nremembering is accepted as “philosophical common sense”\n(see the entry on\n memory;\n but see also De Brigard 2014 on memory traces). As such, it is\nunsurprising that discontinuism remains the orthodoxy. As J. O. Urmson\n(1967: 83) boldly claims, “One of these universally admitted\ndistinctions is that between memory and imagination”. \nIn recent years, two sets of findings from cognitive science has given\nphilosophers reasons to push back against discontinuism. \nThe first set of findings concern distortions and confabulations. The\ntraditional conception of memory is that it functions as an archive:\npast experiences are encapsulated and stored in the archive, and\nremembering is just passively retrieving the encapsulated mental\ncontent from the archive (Robins 2016). Behavioral psychology has\nfound numerous effects that challenge the empirical adequacy of the\narchival conception of memory. Perhaps the most well-known is the\nmisinformation effect, which occurs when a subject incorporates\ninaccurate information into their memory of an event—even\ninaccurate information that they received after the event (Loftus 1979\n[1996]). \nThe second set of findings concern the psychological underpinnings of\n“mental time travel”, or the similarities between\nremembering the past and imagining the future, which is also known as\nmental time travel (see Schacter et al. 2012 for a review). Using\nfMRI, neuroscientists have found a striking overlap in the brain\nactivities for remembering the past and imagining the future, which\nsuggest that the two psychological processes utilize the same neural\nnetwork (see, for example, Addis et al. 2007; Buckner & Carroll\n2007; Gilbert & Wilson 2007; Schacter et al. 2007; Suddendorf\n& Corballis 1997, 2007). The neuroscientific research is preceded\nby and corroborated by works from developmental psychology (Atance\n& O’Neill 2011) and on neurodivergent individuals: for\nexample, the severely amnesic patient KC exhibits deficits with\nremembering the past and imagining the future (Tulving 1985), and also\nexhibits deficits with the generation of non-personal fictional\nnarratives (Rosenbaum et al. 2009). Note that, despite the evocative\ncontrast between “remembering the past” and\n“imagining the future”, it is questionable whether\ntemporality is the central contrast. Indeed, some philosophers and\npsychologists contend that temporality is orthogonal to the comparison\nbetween imagination and memory (De Brigard & Gessell 2016;\nSchacter et al. 2012). \nThese two set of findings have given rise to an alternative conception\nthat sees memory as essentially constructive, in which remembering is\nactively generating mental content that more or less represent the\npast. The constructive conception of memory is in a better position to\nexplain why memories can contain distortions and confabulations (but\nsee Robins 2016 for complications), and why remembering makes use of\nthe same neural networks as imagining. \nIn turn, this constructive turn in the psychology and philosophy of\nmemory has revived philosophers’ interest in continuism\nconcerning imagination and memory. Kourken Michaelian (2016)\nexplicitly rejects the causal connection criterion and defends a\ntheory on which remembering, like imagining, centrally involves\nsimulation. Karen Shanton and Alvin Goldman (2010) characterizes\nremembering as mindreading one’s past self. Felipe De Brigard\n(2014) characterizes remembering as a special instance of hypothetical\nthinking. Robert Hopkins (2018) characterizes remembering as a kind of\nimagining that is controlled by the past. However, the philosophical\ninterpretation of empirical research remain contested; in dissent,\nDorothea Debus (2014, 2016) considers the same sets of findings but\nultimately concludes that remembering and imagining remain distinct\nmental kinds. \nTo suppose is to form a hypothetical mental representation.\nThere exists a highly contentious debate on whether supposition is\ncontinuous with imagination, which is also a hypothetical attitude, or\nwhether there are enough differences to make them discontinuous. There\nare two main options for distinguishing imagination and supposition,\nby phenomenology and by function. \nThe phenomenological distinction standardly turns on the notion of\nvivacity: whereas imaginings are vivid, suppositions are not. Indeed,\none often finds in this literature the contrast between “merely\nsupposing” and “vividly imagining”. Although\nvivacity has been frequently invoked in discussions of imagination,\nAmy Kind (2017) draws on empirical and theoretical considerations to\nargue that it is ultimately philosophically untenable. If that is\ncorrect, then the attempt to demarcate imagination and supposition by\ntheir vivacity is untenable too. More rarely, other phenomenological\ndifferences are invoked; for example, Brian Weatherson (2004) contends\nthat “supposing can be coarse in a way that imagining\ncannot”. \nTable 1. Architectural similarities and\ndifferences between imagination and supposition (Weinberg & Meskin\n2006). \nThere have been diverse functional distinctions attributed to the\ndiscontinuity between imagination and supposition, but none has gained\nuniversal acceptance. Richard Moran (1994) contends that imagination\ntends to give rise to a wide range of further mental states, including\naffective responses, whereas supposition does not (see also Arcangeli\n2014, 2017). Tamar Szabó Gendler (2000a) contends that while\nattempting to imagine something like that female infanticide is\nmorally right seems to generate imaginative resistance, supposing it\ndoes not (see the discussion on imaginative resistance in\n Supplement on Puzzles and Paradoxes of Imagination and the Arts).\n Gregory Currie and Ian Ravenscroft (2002) contend that supposition\ninvolves only cognitive imagination, but imagination involves both\ncognitive and conative imagination. Alvin Goldman contends that\nsuppositional imagination involves supposing that particular\ncontent obtains (for example, supposing that I am elated) but\nenactment imagination involves “enacting, or trying to\nenact, elation itself.” (2006: 47–48, italics omitted).\nTyler Doggett and Andy Egan (2007) contend that imagination tends to\nmotivate pretense actions, but supposition tends not to. On Jonathan\nWeinberg and Aaron Meskin (2006)’s synthesis, while there are a\nfew functional similarities, there are many more functional\ndifferences between imagination and supposition (Table 1). \nThere remain ongoing debates about specific alleged functional\ndistinctions, and about whether the functional distinctions are\nnumerous or fundamental enough to warrant discontinuism or not.\nIndeed, it remains contentious which philosophers count as continuists\nand which philosophers count as discontinuists (for a few sample\ntaxonomies, see Arcangeli 2017; Balcerak Jackson 2016; Kind 2013). \nMuch of the contemporary discussion of imagination has centered around\nparticular roles that imagination is purported to play in various\ndomains of human understanding and activity. Amongst the most\nwidely-discussed are the role of imagination in understanding other\nminds\n (section 3.1),\n in performing and recognizing pretense\n (section 3.2),\n in characterizing psychopathology\n (section 3.3),\n in engaging with the arts\n (section 3.4),\n in thinking creatively\n (section 3.5),\n in acquiring knowledge about possibilities\n (section 3.6),\n and in interpreting figurative language\n (section 3.7). \nThe variety of roles ascribed to imagination, in turn, provides a\nguide for discussions on the nature of imagination\n (section 1)\n and its place in cognitive architecture\n (section 2). \nMindreading is the activity of attributing mental states to\noneself and to others, and of predicting and explaining behavior on\nthe basis of those attributions. Discussions of mindreading in the\n1990s were often framed as debates between “theory\ntheory”—which holds that the attribution of mental states\nto others is guided by the application of some (tacit) folk\npsychological theory—and “simulation\ntheory”—which holds that the attribution of mental states\nis guided by a process of replicating or emulating the target’s\n(apparent) mental states, perhaps through mechanisms involving the\nimagination. (Influential collections of papers on this debate include\nCarruthers & Smith (eds.) 1996; Davies & Stone (eds.) 1995a,\n1995b.) In recent years, proponents of both sides have increasingly\nconverged on common ground, allowing that both theory and simulation\nplay some role in the attribution of mental states to others (see\nCarruthers 2003; Goldman 2006; Nichols & Stich 2003). Many such\nhybrid accounts include a role for imagination. \nOn theory theory views, mindreading involves the application\nof some (tacit) folk psychological theory that allows the subject to\nmake predictions and offer explanations of the target’s beliefs\nand behaviors. On pure versions of such accounts, imagination plays no\nspecial role in the attribution of mental states to others. (For an\noverview of theory theory, see entry on\n folk psychology as a theory). \nOn simulation theory views, mindreading involves simulating\nthe target’s mental states so as to exploit similarities between\nthe subject’s and target’s processing capacities. It is\nthis simulation that allows the subject to make predictions and offer\nexplanations of the target’s beliefs and behaviors. (For early\npapers, see Goldman 1989; Gordon 1986; Heal 1986; for recent dissent,\nsee, for example, Carruthers 2009; Gallagher 2007; Saxe 2005, 2009;\nfor an overview of simulation theory, see entry on\n folk psychology as mental simulation). \nTraditional versions of simulation theory typically describe\nsimulation using expressions such as “imaginatively putting\noneself in the other’s place”. How this metaphor is\nunderstood depends on the specific account. (A collection of papers\nexploring various versions of simulation theory can be found in Dokic\n& Proust (eds.) 2002.) On many accounts, the projection is assumed\nto involve the subject’s imaginatively running mental processes\n“off-line” that are directly analogous to those being run\n“on-line” by the target (for example Goldman 1989).\nWhereas the “on-line” mental processes are genuine, the\n“off-line” mental processes are merely imagined. For\nexample, a target that is deciding whether to eat sushi for lunch is\nrunning their decision-making processes “on-line”; and a\nsubject that is simulating the target’s decision-making is\nrunning the analogous processes “off-line”—in part,\nby imagining the relevant mental states of the target. Recent\nempirical work in psychology has explored the accuracy of such\nprojections (Markman, Klein, & Suhr (eds.) 2009, section V; Saxe\n2005, 2006, 2009.) \nThough classic simulationist accounts have tended to assume that the\nsimulation process is at least in-principle accessible to\nconsciousness, a number of recent simulation-style accounts appeal to\nneuroscientific evidence suggesting that at least some simulative\nprocesses take place completely unconsciously. On such accounts of\nmindreading, no special role is played by conscious imagination (see\nGoldman 2009; Saxe 2009.) \nMany contemporary views of mindreading are hybrid theory\nviews according to which both theorizing and simulation play a role in\nthe understanding of others’ mental states. Alvin Goldman\n(2006), for example, argues that while mindreading is primarily the\nproduct of simulation, theorizing plays a role in certain cases as\nwell. Many recent discussions have endorsed hybrid views of this sort,\nwith more or less weight given to each of the components in particular\ncases (see Carruthers 2003; Nichols & Stich 2003.) \nA number of philosophers have suggested that the mechanisms underlying\nsubjects’ capacity to engage in mindreading are those that\nenable engagement in pretense behavior (Currie & Ravenscroft 2002;\nGoldman 2006; Nichols & Stich 2003; for an overview of recent\ndiscussions, see Carruthers 2009.) According to such accounts,\nengaging in pretense involves imaginatively taking up perspectives\nother than one’s own, and the ability to do so skillfully may\nrely on—and contribute to—one’s ability to\nunderstand those alternate perspectives (see the entry on\n empathy).\n Partly in light of these considerations, the relative lack of\nspontaneous pretense in children with autistic spectrum disorders is\ntaken as evidence for a link between the skills of pretense and\nempathy. \nPretending is an activity that occurs during diverse\ncircumstances, such as when children make-believe, when criminals\ndeceive, and when thespians act (Langland-Hassan 2014). Although\n“imagination” and “pretense” have been used\ninterchangeably (Ryle 1949), in this section we will use “imagination” to\nrefer to one’s state of mind, and “pretense” to\nrefer to the one’s actions in the world. \nDifferent theories of pretense disagree fundamentally about what it is\nto pretend (see Liao & Gendler 2011 for an overview).\nConsequently, they also disagree about the mental states that enable\none to pretend. Metarepresentational theories hold that\nengaging in pretend play requires the innate mental-state concept\npretend (Baron-Cohen, Leslie, & Frith 1985; Friedman 2013;\nFriedman & Leslie 2007; Leslie 1987, 1994). To pretend is to\nrepresent one’s own representations under the concept pretend.\nBehaviorist theories hold that engaging in pretend play\nrequires a process of behaving-as-if (Harris 1994, 2000; Harris &\nKavanaugh 1993; Jarrold et al. 1994; Lillard & Flavell 1992;\nNichols & Stich 2003; Perner 1991; Rakoczy, Tomasello, &\nStriano 2004; Stich & Tarzia 2015). Different\nbehaviorist theories explicate behaving-as-if in different ways, but\nall aim to provide an account of pretense without recourse to the\ninnate mental-state concept pretend. \nPhilosophical and psychological theories have sought to explain both\nthe performance of pretense and the recognition of\npretense, especially concerning evidence from developmental psychology\n(see Lillard 2001 for an early overview). On the performance side,\nchildren on a standard developmental trajectory exhibit early\nindicators of pretend play around 15 months; engage in explicit\nprop-oriented play by 24 months; and engage in sophisticated joint\npretend play with props by 36 months (Harris 2000; Perner, Baker,\n& Hutton 1994; Piaget 1945 [1951]). On the recognition side,\nchildren on a standard developmental trajectory distinguish pretense\nand reality via instinctual behavioral cues around 15–18 months;\nand start to do so via conventional behavioral cues from 36 months on\n(Friedman et al. 2010; Lillard & Witherington 2004; Onishi &\nBaillargeon 2005; Onishi,\nBaillargeon, & Leslie 2007; Richert and Lillard 2004). \nNot surprisingly, the debate between theories of pretense often rest\non interpretations of such empirical evidence. For example, Ori\nFriedman and Alan Leslie (2007) argue that behavioral theories cannot\naccount for the fact that children as young as 15 months old can\nrecognize pretend play and its normativity (Baillargeon, Scott, &\nHe 2010). Specifically, they argue that behavioral theories do not\noffer straightforward explanations of this early development of\npretense recognition, and incorrectly predicts that children\nsystematically mistake other acts of behaving-as-if—such as\nthose that stem from false beliefs—for pretense activities. In\nresponse, Stephen Stich and Joshua Tarzia (2015) has acknowledged\nthese problems for earlier behaviorist theories, and developed a new\nbehaviorist theory that purportedly explains the totality of empirical\nevidence better than metarepresentational rivals. Importantly, Stich\nand Tarzia argue that their account can better explain Angeline\nLillard (1993)’s empirical finding that young children need not\nattribute a mental concept such as pretend to someone else in order to\nunderstand them as pretending. \nThe debate concerning theories of pretense has implications for the\nrole of imagination in pretense. Behaviorist theories tend to take\nimagination as essential to explaining pretense performance;\nmetarepresentational theories do not. (However, arguably the innate\nmental-state concept pretend posited by metarepresentational theories\nserve similar functions. See Nichols and Stich’s (2000) discussion\nof the decoupler mechanism, which explicitly draws from\nLeslie 1987. Currie and Ravenscroft (2002) give a broadly behaviorist\ntheory of pretense that does not require imagination.) Specifically,\non most behaviorist theories, imagination is essential for guiding\nelaborations of pretense episodes, especially via behaviors (Picciuto\n& Carruthers 2016; Stich & Tarzia 2015). \nMost recently, Peter Langland-Hassan (2012, 2014) has developed a\ntheory that aims to explain pretense behavior and pretense recognition\nwithout appeal to either metarepresentation or imagination.\nLangland-Hassan argues that pretense behaviors can be adequately\nexplained by beliefs, desires, and intentions—including beliefs\nin counterfactuals; and that the difference between pretense and\nsincerity more generally can be adequately characterized in terms of a\nperson’s beliefs, intentions, and desires. While Langland-Hassan\ndoes not deny that pretense is in some sense an imaginative activity,\nhe argues that we do not need to posit a sui generis component of the\nmind to account for it. \nAutism and delusions have been—with much\ncontroversy—characterized as disorders of imagination. That is,\nthe atypical patterns of cognition and behavior associated with each\npsychopathology have been argued to result from atypical functions of\nimagination. \nAutism can be characterized in terms of a trio of\natypicalities often referred to as “Wing’s triad”:\nproblems in typical social competence, communication, and imagination\n(Happé 1994; Wing & Gould 1979). The imaginative aspect of\nautism interacts with other prominent roles of imagination, namely\nmindreading, pretense, and engagement with the arts (Carruthers 2009).\nChildren with autism do not engage in spontaneous pretend play in the\nways that typically-developing children do, engaging instead in\nrepetitive and sometimes obsessional activities; and adults with\nautism often show little interest in fiction (Carpenter, Tomasello,\n& Striano 2005; Happé 1994; Rogers, Cook, & Meryl 2005;\nWing & Gould 1979). The degree to which an imaginative deficit is\nimplicated in autism remains a matter of considerable debate. Most\nradically, Gregory Currie and Ian Ravenscroft (2002) have argued that,\nwith respect to Wing’s triad, problems in typical social\ncompetence and communication are rooted in an inability to engage in\nimaginative activities. \nDelusions can be characterized as belief-like mental\nrepresentations that manifest an unusual degree of disconnectedness\nfrom reality (Bortolotti & Miyazono 2015). Particularly striking\nexamples would include Capgras and Cotard delusions. In the former,\nthe sufferer takes her friends and family to have been replaced by\nimposters; in the latter, the sufferer takes himself to be dead. More\nmundane examples might include ordinary cases of self-deception. \nOne approach to delusions characterize them as beliefs that are\ndysfunctional in their content or formation. (For a representative\ncollection of papers that present and criticize this perspective, see\nColtheart & Davies (eds.) 2000). However, another approach to\ndelusions characterize them as dysfunctions of imaginings. Currie and\nRavenscroft (2002: 170–175) argue that delusions are imaginings\nthat are misidentified by the subject as the result of an inability to\nkeep track of the sources of one’s thoughts. That is, a delusion\nis an imagined representation that is misidentified by the subject as\na belief. Tamar Szabó Gendler (2007) argues that in cases of\ndelusions and self-deceptions, imaginings come to play a role in\none’s cognitive architecture similar to that typically played by\nbeliefs. Andy Egan (2008a) likewise argues that the mental states\ninvolved in delusions are both belief-like (in their connection to\nbehaviors and inferences) and imagination-like (in their\ncircumscription); however, he argues that these functional\nsimilarities suggest the need to posit an in-between attitude called\n“bimagination”. \nThere is an entrenched historical connection between imagination and\nthe arts. David Hume and Immanuel Kant both invoke imagination\ncentrally in their exploration of aesthetic phenomena (albeit in\nradically different ways; see entries on\n Hume’s aesthetics\n and\n Kant’s aesthetics).\n R.G. Collingwood (1938) defines art as the imaginative expression of\nfeeling (Wiltsher 2018; see entry on\n Collingwood’s aesthetics).\n Roger Scruton (1974) develops a Wittgensteinian account of\nimagination and accords it a central role in aesthetic experience and\naesthetic judgment. \nIn contemporary philosophy, the most prominent theory of\nimagination’s role in engagement with the arts is presented in\nKendall Walton’s Mimesis as Make-Believe (1990).\n(Although Walton uses “fictions” as a technical term to\nrefer to artworks, his conception of the arts is broad enough to\ninclude both high-brow and low-brow; popular and obscure; a variety of\nspecific arts such as poetry and videogames; and—as Stacie\nFriend (2008) clarifies—both fictive and non-fictive works.)\nWalton’s core insight is that engagement with the arts is\nfundamentally similar to children’s games of make-believe. When\none engages with an artwork, one uses it as a prop in a make-believe\ngame. As props, artworks generate prescriptions for imaginings. These\nprescriptions also determine the representational contents of artworks\n(that is, “fictionality”, or what is true in a fictional\nworld). When one correctly engages with an artwork, then, one imagines\nthe representational contents as prescribed. \nOut of all the arts, it is the engagement with narratives that\nphilosophers have explored most closely in conjunction with\nimagination (see Stock 2013 for an overview). Gregory Currie (1990)\noffers an influential account of imagination and fiction, and Peter\nLamarque and Stein Haugom Olsen (1996) discuss literature\nspecifically. Indeed, this research program—despite many\ncriticisms of Walton’s specific theory—remains lively\ntoday (see, for example, papers in Nichols (ed.) 2006b). For example, Kathleen Stock (2017) argues that a specific kind of propositional imagination is essential for engagement with fictions. In dissent, Derek Matravers (2014) argues that, contra Walton, imagination is not essential for engagement with fictions.  \nPhilosophers have also done much to articulate the connection between\nimagination and engagement with music (see the entry on\n philosophy of music;\n see also Trivedi 2011). Some philosophers focus on commonalities\nbetween engagement with narratives and engagement with music. For\nexample, even though Walton (1990, 1994a, 1999) acknowledges that\nfictional worlds of music are much more indeterminate than fictional\nworlds of narratives, he maintains that the same kind of imagining\nused in experiencing narratives is also used in experiencing various\nelements of music, such as imagining continuity between movements and\nimagining feeling musical tension. Similarly, Andrew Kania (2015)\nargues that experiencing musical space and movement is imaginative\nlike our experience of fictional narratives. Other philosophers draw\nparallels between engagement with music and other imaginative\nactivities, namely as understanding other minds\n (section 3.1)\n and interpreting metaphor\n (section 3.7).\n As an example of the former, Jerrold Levinson (1996) argues that the\nbest explanation of musical expressiveness requires listeners to\nexperience music imaginatively—specifically, imagining a persona\nexpressing emotions through the music. As an example of the latter,\nScruton (1997) argues that musical experience is informed by spatial\nconcepts applied metaphorically, and so imaginative perception is\nnecessary for musical understanding (but see Budd 2003 for a\ncriticism; see also De Clercq 2007 and Kania 2015). Stephen Davies\n(2005, 2011) and Peter Kivy (2002) notably criticize the imaginative\naccounts of engagement with music on empirical and theoretical\ngrounds. \nOther imaginative accounts of engagement with the arts can be found in entries on\n philosophy of film\n and\n philosophy of dance. \nIndeed, imagination’s aesthetic significance extends beyond the\narts; philosophical aestheticians have recognized the role of\nimagination in appreciating nature (Brady 1998) and in appreciating\nmundane objects, events, and activities (see the entry\non aesthetics of the everyday). \nPhilosophers have sought to clarify the role of imagination in\nengagement with the arts by focusing on a number of puzzles and\nparadoxes in the vicinity. The puzzle of imaginative\nresistance explores apparent limitations on what can be imagined\nduring engagements with the arts and, relatedly, what can be made\nfictional in artworks. The paradox of emotional response to\nfictions (widely known as “paradox of fiction”)\nexamines psychological and normative similarities between affective\nresponses prompted by imaginings versus affective responses by\nreality-directed attitudes. The paradox of tragedy and the\nparadox of horror examine psychological and normative\ndifferences between affective responses prompted by imaginings versus\naffective responses by reality-directed attitudes. Finally, the\npuzzle of moral persuasion is concerned with real-world\noutputs of imaginative engagements with artworks; specifically,\nwhether and how artworks can morally educate or corrupt. For more\ndetail on each of these artistic phenomena, see the\n Supplement on Puzzles and Paradoxes of Imagination and the Arts.\n  \nThe idea that imagination plays a central role in creative processes\ncan be traced back to Immanuel Kant (Critique of Pure\nReason), who takes artistic geniuses as paradigmatic examples of\ncreativity. On Kant’s account, when imagination aims at the\naesthetic, it is allowed to engage in free play beyond the\nunderstanding available to oneself. The unconstrained imagination can\nthereby take raw materials and produce outputs that transcend concepts\nthat one possesses. \nWhile the precise characterization of creativity remains controversial\n(see Gaut & Kieran (eds.) 2018; Paul & Kaufman (eds.) 2014),\ncontemporary philosophers typically conceive of it more broadly than\nKant did. In addition to creative processes in the aesthetic realm,\nthey also consider creative processes in, for example, “science,\ncraft, business, technology, organizational life and everyday\nactivities” (Gaut 2010: 1034; see also Stokes 2011). As an\nexample, Michael Polanyi (1966) gives imagination a central role in\nthe creative endeavor of scientific discovery, by refining and\nnarrowing the solution space to open-ended scientific problems (see\nStokes 2016: 252–256). And, in addition to creative processes of\ngeniuses, contemporary philosophers also consider creative processes\nof ordinary people. \nWith this broadened scope, contemporary philosophers have followed\nKant’s lead in exploring the role of imagination in creativity\n(see Stokes 2016 for an overview). Berys Gaut (2003) and Dustin Stokes\n(2014) argue that two characteristic features of imagination—its\nlack of aim at truth and its dissociation from action—make it\nespecially suitable for creative processes. Peter Carruthers (2002)\nargues that the same cognitive resources, including imagination,\nunderlie children’s pretend play and adults’ creative\nthinking. Specifically, Carruthers hypothesizes that children’s\nplay evolutionarily developed as precursors to and practices for\nadults’ creative thinking. \nThere are two points of disagreement regarding the role of imagination\nin creative processes. First, philosophers disagree about the nature\nand the strength of the connection between imagination and creativity.\nKant takes imagination to be constitutive of creativity: what\nmakes a creative process creative is the involvement of imagination\naiming at the aesthetic (see also A. Hills & Bird forthcoming).\nGaut and Stokes, by contrast, thinks there is only an imperfect\ncausal connection between imagination and creativity: while\nimagination is useful for creative processes, there are creative\nprocesses that do not involve imagination and there are imaginings\nthat are uncreative (see also Beaney 2005). Second, philosophers\ndisagree about the type of imagination involved in creative processes.\nBy hypothesizing a common evolutionary cause, Carruthers suggests that\nthe same imaginative capacity is involved in pretense and in\ncreativity. By contrast, perhaps echoing Kant’s distinction of\nproductive versus reproductive imagination, Currie and Ravenscroft\n(2002) sharply distinguish recreative imagination, which is involved\nin pretense and mindreading, from creative imagination. \nImagination plays a role in the acquisition of knowledge. Many\nphilosophical arguments call on imagination when they appeal to\nmetaphysical modal knowledge (see the entry on\n epistemology of modality;\n the papers collected in Gendler & Hawthorne (eds.) 2002; and Kung\n2016 and Strohminger & Yli-Vakkuri 2017 for overviews). The kind\nof thought experiments that are regularly used in scientific\ntheorizing is also plausibly premised on imaginative capacities (see\nthe entry on\n thought experiments).\n As already discussed, people use imagination to understand the\nperspectives of others\n (section 3.1).\n Moreover, people often make decisions via thinking about\ncounterfactuals, or what would happen if things had been different\nfrom how they in fact are (see the entries on\n causation\n and\n counterfactual conditionals).\n However, the phenomenon of transformative experience has recently\ncalled into question which kind of imaginary scenarios are truly\nepistemically accessible. (For a representative collection of papers\nthat explore different epistemic roles of imagination, see Kind &\nKung (eds.) 2016a.) \nBroadly speaking, thought experiments use imaginary scenarios to\nelicit responses that (ideally) grant people knowledge of\npossibilities. A special, but prominent, type of thought experiment in\nphilosophy concerns the link between imagination, conceivability, and\nmetaphysical possibility. René Descartes famously offered a\nmodal argument in the Sixth Meditation, reasoning\nfrom the fact that he could clearly and distinctly conceive of his\nmind and body as distinct to the real distinctness between them. The\ncurrent prevalence of similar modal arguments can be verified by\nentries on\n zombies\n and\n dualism.\n These modal arguments all rely, in some way, on the idea that what\none can imagine functions as a fallible and defeasible guide to what\nis really possible in the broadest sense. \nPessimists, notably Peter Van Inwagen (1998: 70), doubt that\nimagination can give us an accurate understanding of scenarios that\nare “remote from the practical business of everyday life”,\nsuch as those called upon in philosophical modal arguments. Optimists\ntypically take it as a given that there is some connection between\nimagination and metaphysical modal knowledge, but focus on\nunderstanding where the connection is imperfect, such as when one\n(apparently) imagines the impossible. To just give a few examples,\nSaul Kripke (1972 [1980]), Stephen Yablo (1993), David Chalmers\n(2002), Dominic Gregory (2004), Timothy\nWilliamson (2007, 2016), Peter Kung (2010), and Magdalena Balcerak Jackson (2018) have each developed a distinctive approach to\nthis task. For example, Kripke adopts a redescription approach to\nmodeling (some) modal errors: in some cases where one is apparently\nimagining the impossible, one is in fact imagining a possible scenario\nbut misconstruing it as an impossible one. On this diagnosis, in such\ncases, the error resides not with imaginative capacities, but with the\ncapacity to describe one’s own imaginings. \nOther thought experiments are scoped more narrowly; for example,\nscientific thought experiments are intended to allow people to explore\nnomic possibilities. Galileo (On Motion) famously offered a\nthought experiment that disproved Aristotle’s theory of motion,\nwhich predicts that heavier objects fall more quickly. In this thought\nexperiment, Galileo asked people to imagine the falling of a composite\nof a light and heavy object versus the falling of the heavy object\nalone. When one runs the thought experiment—that is, when one\nelaborates on the starting point of this imaginary scenario—one\nnotices an incoherence in Aristotle’s theory: on the one hand,\nit should predict that the composite would fall more slowly because\nthe light object would slow down the heavy object; on the other hand,\nit should also predict that the composite would fall more quickly\nbecause the composite is heavier than the heavy object alone. While it\nis incontrovertible that imagination is central to thought\nexperiments, debates remain on whether imagination can be invoked in\nthe context of justification (Gendler 2000b; Williamson 2016) or only\nin the context of discovery (Norton 1991, 1996; Spaulding 2016). \nThe role of imagination in counterfactual reasoning—and, in\nparticular, the question of what tends to be held constant when one\ncontemplates counterfactual scenarios—has been explored in\ndetail in recent philosophical and psychological works (Byrne 2005;\nWilliamson 2005, 2007, 2016). Williamson suggests that  \nWhen we work out what would have happened if such-and-such had been\nthe case, we frequently cannot do it without imagining such-and-such\nto be the case and letting things run. (2005: 19)  \nIt is imagination that lets one move from counterfactuals’\nantecedents to their consequents. Williamson (2016) argues that our\nimaginings have evolved to be suitably constrained, such that such\ncounterfactual reasoning can confer knowledge. Indeed, he argues that\nif one were to be skeptical about gaining knowledge from such a\nhypothetical reasoning process, then one would be forced to be\n(implausibly) skeptical about much of ordinary reasoning about\nactuality. Developing an idea anticipated by Williamson (2007), Margot\nStrohminger and Juhani Yli-Vakkuri (forthcoming) argue that the same\nimaginative mechanisms that capable of producing metaphysical modal\nknowledge are also capable of producing knowledge of other restricted\nmodalities, such as nomic and practical modality. In parallel, Amy Kind (2016c, 2018) argues that imaginings can confer knowledge when they are guided by reality-sensitive constraints, in a manner akin to computer simulations. \nThinking about counterfactuals is just one way that imagination can\nfactor into mundane decision-making. Neil Van Leeuwen (2011, 2016a,\n2016b) and Bence Nanay (2016a) have recently started to elaborate on the connection\nbetween imagination and actions via decision-making. Although neither\nauthors focus on the epistemic status of imagination, their accounts\nof decision-making seem to suggest that imagination is used to gain\npractical knowledge about the probability and value of actions’\npossible outcomes. \nAt the same time, the recently prominent discussion of transformative\nexperiences calls into question the extent to which imagination can be\nepistemically useful for making life-altering decisions. L.A. Paul\n(2014, 2015, 2018; see also Jackson 1982, 1986; D. Lewis 1988) argues\nthat some types of knowledge—especially de se knowledge\nconcerning one’s values—are inaccessible by imaginings;\nonly actual experiences can confer these types of knowledge. For\nexample, one cannot really know whether one wants to become a parent\nwithout experiencing being a parent because parenthood itself can\ntransform one’s values. If one cannot reasonably imagine oneself\nwith radically different values, then plausibly one cannot\nappropriately imagine the values associated with the outcomes of\none’s actions. As such, despite their epistemic worth in\nordinary contexts, imaginings might not help in making life-altering\ndecisions. \nFinally, imagination might play a role in interpreting figurative\nlanguage. The exact role ascribed to imagination varies greatly from\ntheory to theory. In part, this variation arose from a longstanding\ndebate in philosophy of language concerning the divide between literal\nand figurative language: while some imaginative theories of figurative\nlanguage (such as Walton 1990) accept a strong divide, others (such as\nLepore & Stone 2015) reject it. Although this controversy cannot\nbe avoided entirely, it is worth reiterating that the present aim is\nonly to highlight the possible role(s) that imagination might play in\nthe psychology of irony, metaphor, and nearby linguistic\nphenomena. \nDespite immense differences between them, numerous theories of irony\nhave converged on the idea that interpreting irony involves\nimagination. Kendall Walton (1990) treats ironic and metaphoric speech\nas props in momentary games of make-believe. On Walton’s theory,\nimagination is central to understanding and interpreting such\nfigurative speech. Herbert Clark and Richard Gerrig (1984) and Gregory\nCurrie (2006) connect irony to pretense, but without further linking\nall cases of pretense to imaginative capacities. Elisabeth Camp (2012)\nsimilarly endorses a role for pretense in the interpretation of irony\nand the related case of sarcasm. Finally, this idea that interpreting\nirony involves imagination is corroborated by psychological research:\nirony recognition is difficult for neurodivergent individuals who lack\nimaginative capacities (Happé 1991)—specifically, in\nindividuals with Asperger’s syndrome, who have deficits with\nmeta-representation—and in individuals with schizophrenia, who\nhave deficits with theory-of-mind (Langdon et al. 2002). \nAgain, despite immense differences between them, numerous theories of\nmetaphor have also converged on the idea that interpreting metaphor\ninvolves imagination (see the entry on\n metaphor).\n The first family of theories focus on imagination’s role in\npretense. As mentioned earlier, Walton (1990) takes metaphors to be\nprops in momentary games of make-believe. Walton (1993, 2000) and\nDavid Hills (1997) further develop this idea. (Importantly, Walton\n(1993) notes that interpretation of a metaphor may not involve actual\nimaginings, but only the recognition of the type of imaginings\nprescribed.) Andy Egan (2008b) extends the idea to account for idioms.\nThese theories remain controversial: in particular, Camp (2009) and\nCatherine Wearing (2011) have offered forceful criticisms. The second\nfamily of theories focus on imagination’s role in providing\nnovel perspectives. While Camp (2009) criticizes the first family of\ntheories, she also acknowledges a role for imagination. On her\naccount, pretense and metaphor typically involve distinct types of\nimaginings: pretense-imaginings allow one to access counterfactual\ncontent, but metaphor-imaginings allow one to re-interpret actual\ncontent from a novel perspective. Indeed Camp (2007) argues that the\nkind of imagination involved in interpreting metaphors is also used to\ninterpret similes and juxtapositions. The third family of theories\nfocus on imagination’s role in providing mental images. Paul\nRicoeur (1978), Richard Moran (1989), and Robyn Carston (2010) all\npropose theories on which mental imagery plays an important role in\nprocessing metaphors. Outside of philosophy of language, James Grant\n(2011) argues that metaphors are prevalent in art criticism because\nthey prompt readers’ imaginings.","contact.mail":"tamar.gendler@yale.edu","contact.domain":"yale.edu"}]
