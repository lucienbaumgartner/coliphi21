By appealing to the role of conventions, it is\nthought, we can distinguish linguistic signs, the meaningful\nuse of words, from mere natural ‘signs’. During the last\ncentury the thesis that language is essentially conventional has played\na central role within philosophy of language, and has even been called\na platitude (Lewis 1969). More recently, the focus has been less on the\nconventional nature of language than on the claim that meaning is\nessentially normative in a wider sense, leaving it open whether the\nnormativity in question should be understood in terms of conventions or\nnot (Kripke 1982).\n\n\n\nNormativism is not limited to language, however – versions of\nit have also been defended in the case of mental content. It has been\nsuggested that a mental state has content only if there are certain\nnorms in force for it. According to many, the essentially normative\naspect of meaning and content reflects a deep-lying contrast between\nmind and nature.\n\n This essay discusses a number of central normativist theses with\nrespect to meaning as well as to content. We begin by identifying\ndifferent versions of meaning normativism, presenting the arguments\nthat have been put forth for and against them. We then continue by\ndiscussing content normativism, providing an overview of the\ncontemporary debate. Both debates are very much on-going and at this\npoint there is little consensus as to whether normativism holds for\neither meaning or content. Since the first publication of this essay\nmuch of the debate has focused on two of its central issues: First, it\nhas been debated whether meaning normativism can be derived from the\nfact that meaningful expressions necessarily have correctness\nconditions. This is the argument we labelled the ‘the simple\nargument’ and in section 2.1.1 we discuss recent contributions\nto the debate. Second, the nature of rule-guidance has been much\ndiscussed, in particular relating to content normativism, and new\nproposals have been made as to how it is to be understood. We discuss\nthis in sections 2.2 and 3.2. It has also been argued, however, that\nthe normativity essential to meaning (and content) is of a more\n‘primitive’ character than has so far been recognized in\nthe debate. We discuss this in section 2.1.1, 2.2.1, and specifically\nin section 2.2.4.\n\n\n\nNormativism in the theory of meaning and content is the view that\nlinguistic meaning and/or intentional content essentially is\nnormative. Both of its components, normativity and its\nessentiality to meaning/content, can be interpreted in a number of\ndifferent ways, however; as a result, there is a whole family of more\nor less closely related views laying claim to the slogan\n“meaning/content is normative”. \n\nTo say that meaning/content is essentially normative is\nmaking a claim about the nature of meaning/content, about what\nmeaning/content is. Consequently, it is at least a matter of\nmetaphysical necessity, possibly even of conceptual necessity, that\nthere is no meaning/content without\n norms.[1]\nBut which is prior?\nMetaphysically speaking, are certain norms valid, or in force,\nbecause certain things – such as linguistic\nexpressions/intentional states – have certain meanings/contents?\nOr do such things have (a certain) meaning/content because\ncertain norms are in force? Accordingly, for a given set of norms, the\nclaim that meaning/content is essentially normative can be read in\ndifferent ways: As a claim that remains neutral on the question of\nmetaphysical priority, as claiming priority for meaning/content, or as\nclaiming priority for norms. \n\nAssuming that one or the other is prior if the neutral claim is\n true,[2]\n we have distinguished between two forms of\nnormativity: meaning/content ‘engendered’ (ME/CE)\nnormativity and meaning/content determining (MD/CD)\nnormativity (cf. Glüer & Wikforss 2009). MD/CD norms are\nsuch that they metaphysically determine, or constitute,\nmeaning/content; here, the norms are prior. ME/CE normativity is\nnormativity ‘engendered by’, or consequent upon,\nmeaning/content. Given the actual shape of the debate where it is\noften argued that normative consequences can be more or less directly\nderived from something’s having meaning/content while remaining\nneutral on the issue of how this meaning/content is determined, we\nshall here interpret ME/CE normativism as any position according to which\nmeaning/content is essentially such that it has normative\nconsequences, regardless of how meaning/content is\n determined.[3] \n\nMD/CD normativism is an answer to the “foundational”\nquestion: What is it that determines meaning (and/or content)?\nIn the context of such “foundational semantics” (the term\nis Stalnaker’s), the relevant determination relations\naren’t merely mathematical, or functional, relations; rather,\nrelevant are those relations “in virtue of” which something\nhas meaning, i.e., relations “constitutive of”, or essential\nto, having meaning. Relations of metaphysical determination are often\ncalled “supervenience” relations. Such relations can be of\nmany kinds. For instance, they can be one-one (equivalence relations)\nor many-one (“mere” supervenience relations). Some of them\nallow for analytic or ontological reduction, others do\n not.[4]\nBut all of them involve three elements: a set of supervenient entities\nSE, a set of entities forming the supervenience\nbase SB, and a principle according to which what\nis in SB determines what is in\nSE (a function from SB to\n SE).[5]\n What is important is that a principle of determination is required in\nany foundational account. As long as only the supervenience base is\nspecified, its elements can be mapped onto meanings/contents in any\nold way, thus leaving meaning/content completely\nindeterminate. Arguably, this is one of the most important lessons of\nWittgenstein’s so-called rule-following considerations (Pagin\n2002). \n\nThere is a tradition of reading these considerations as ruling out\nrealism about meaning/content (for instance Dummett 1959; Kripke 1982;\nWright 1986; Travis 2006; see also Hattiangadi 2007), the view that\nhaving meaning/content consists in having, or determining, objective\njudgment-independent conditions of truth or correctness. In this\ntradition, an anti-realist, epistemic conception of truth is used as\nthe basic semantic concept, and it is often argued that this is\nrequired precisely because there is no set of facts, no supervenience\nbase capable of determining realist meanings/contents. Despite its\npartially revisionary character, semantic anti-realism does not rule\nout a substantive metaphysics of (anti-realist) meaning/content,\nhowever. It can be combined with both ME/CE and MD/CD normativism. \n\nThis is not true, however, of radically quietist readings of\nWittgenstein according to which substantive metaphysical claims about\nmeaning/content cannot (sensibly) be made at all (cf. Boghossian\n1989a). While normativism does not commit its proponents to the\npossibility of reducing meaning/content to the normative, or even to\nthe possibility of an account of meaning/content in terms of\nsubstantive necessary and sufficient conditions, it does require the\npossibility of stating substantive necessary conditions on\nmeaning/content (cf. McDowell 1991; 1992). \n\nTo say that meaning/content is essentially (ME/CE or MD/CD)\nnormative is to say that meaning/content is essentially such\nthat certain norms are valid, or in force, whenever something\nhas meaning/content. Being valid, or in force, however, can be\nunderstood along cognitivist or non-cognitivist lines. Cognitivists\nanalyze normative statements as factual, truth-conditional claims\nanswering to an independent normative reality of normative facts.\nNon-cognitivists claim that such statements are non-factual, and\ntypically analyze them in terms of the psychological states of their\nsubjects. Standardly, contemporary non-cognitivists (most prominently,\nSimon Blackburn and Alan Gibbard) nevertheless hold on to a\n“minimalist” realism about the normative. As the debate\nbetween cognitivists and non-cognitivists is of some, but not central,\nimportance for our topic, we shall therefore assume that\nnon-cognitivism can be combined with normativism\nabout\n meaning/content.[6] \n\nMore central will be the question: What kind of norm, what kind of\nnormativity, are we dealing with here? Prima facie there might seem to\nbe as many possible readings of both ME/CE and MD/CD normativism as\nthere are kinds of norms or normativity. We shall go through the most\nrelevant distinctions (most of which can be found in the\nclassifications provided by von Wright 1963, chap. I; Schnädelbach\n1990, 83ff). We shall see that there are at least some kinds of norms\nor normativity that cannot be combined with the idea that\nmeaning/content is essentially normative. \n\nThe most basic distinction relevant here is that between norms\n for action and norms of\n being.[7]\nNorms of being are often\nassociated with evaluations; they tell us that a certain state of\naffairs ought to obtain, i.e., is valuable or good in a certain\nsense. Norms for action, on the other hand, tell us what to\ndo. There is broad consensus that the normativity of\nmeaning/content involves norms for action, but there at least does not\nseem to be anything inconsistent about construing it in purely\naxiological terms. \n\nConcerning norms for action, there are at least four more dimensions\nalong which relevant distinctions can be drawn. First, we can\ndistinguish between instrumental and non-instrumental norms. An\ninstrumental norm tells us what to do in order to reach a certain\ngoal, what means to employ to a certain end, where the relation\nbetween means and end is contingent. An example von Wright gives\nis: \n(D)   If you want to make the hut habitable, you ought to heat it (von\nWright 1963, 10). \n\nThe normative force of instrumental norms characteristically is\ncontingent upon the agent’s having a certain goal, their\nintending, or desiring, to reach a certain end, while that of\nnon-instrumental norms is not so dependent. \n\nAmong non-instrumental norms for action, many distinguish between\nprescriptions and constitutive rules (cf. Rawls 1955; Midgley 1959; von\nWright 1963; Shwayder 1965; Searle 1969, chap. 2.5; Schnädelbach\n1990). For reasons that will become clear shortly, we prefer to\ndistinguish between prescriptions and other norms for action, and\nbetween constitutive and non-constitutive norms or rules. Thus, second,\nprescriptions are norms that can typically be formulated in deontic\nvocabulary, i.e., in terms of what an agent ought (not) to, or should\n(not) do, or in terms of what is prescribed, forbidden or allowed. The\nlaws of the state are prime examples, and so are those of morals and\netiquette. Prescriptions can be conditional, as for instance\n(P1), or unconditional, as for instance (P2): \n(P1)   At a formal dinner, you ought to wear a tie. \n(P2)   You ought to tell the truth. \n\nFor conditional prescriptions, we can, third, distinguish between\nthose where the deontic operator (‘ought’,\n‘should’) takes wide scope over the conditional and those\nwere it takes narrow scope: \n(CPw)   You ought to (if C then do\nX). \n(CPn)   If C, you ought to (do\nX). \n\nThe main difference between (CPw) and\n(CPn) is that on (CPw), there\nare two ways of discharging your obligation: by doing X or by\nmaking it the case that C is not fulfilled. On\n(CPn) there is only one way of discharge: once\nC is fulfilled, you must do X.  Only on\n(CPn), that is, can the consequent be\ndetached. \n\nFor prescriptions, two principles are usually taken to hold\nintuitively. First, the principle that ought implies\ncan, i.e., that to be prescribed, or allowed, actions have to\nbe such that it is at least in principle possible to perform them. And\nsecond, the principle that ought implies the possibility of\nviolation; there would seem to be no point to forbidding impossible\nthings. Both principles are, however, slightly controversial. \n\nFourth, we can distinguish between constitutive and non-constitutive\nnorms or rules. Non-constitutive rules or norms are rules or norms for\na type of action, or activity, that exists independently of the rules.\nThe prescriptions of dinner etiquette are prime examples; they regulate\nthe independently existing practice of eating. Rules of games, on the\nother hand, are prime examples of constitutive rules; in some sense,\nthey “create” the very actions, or activities, they\nregulate. It would, for instance, be impossible to play chess, ice\nhockey, or soccer, without the rules of chess, ice hockey, or soccer.\nAccording to Midgley (1959) and Searle (1963, 33ff), constitutive rules\ntypically, and naturally, can be put into the following form: \n(CR)   In C, doing X counts as doing Y.\n \n\nAccording to this suggestion, constitutive rules tell us that, in a\ncertain context (for instance, a game of soccer), an action of type\nY (for instance, scoring a goal) can be performed by means of\nperforming an action of a different type X (for instance,\nkicking the ball into the goal). Prescriptions do not naturally fit\nthis form. It has therefore been objected that this characterization of\nconstitutive norms is too narrow – there are prescriptions that\nare constitutive of certain games (for instance, it’s\nconstitutive of ice hockey that spearing is forbidden). A wider\ncharacterization of constitutive norms or rules thus counts rules or\nnorms as constitutive of a certain action, or activity, A iff\nA cannot be performed, or engaged in, unless these norms are\nin force (cf. Glüer & Pagin 1999). \n\nThen, there are three more relevant distinctions that apply both to\nnorms for action and to axiological norms. First, we can distinguish\nbetween prima facie and categorical norms (or obligations) (cf. Ross\n2002 [1930]). Prima facie norms are norms that can be overridden by other\nnorms. Thus, it might be that under very many circumstances, you ought\nto tell the truth, but not under all; under special circumstances this\nobligation may be overriden by other obligations, for instance, the\nobligation not to deliver your friend to the secret police. Categorical\nnorms are such that they cannot be thus overridden. \n\nSecond, we can distinguish between norms of different provenance.\nThere are the norms of morals, etiquette, and prudence, the laws of the\nstate, and the rules of games. Analogously, values of different kinds\ncan be distinguished. \n\nAnd third, there are questions about what it means for each of these\ndifferent kinds of rules and norms to be valid, or in force for an\nindividual subject.[8] \nDoes this force derive from the individual, from a\nwhole collective of individuals, or something else? If a norm or rule\nR is in force for an individual subject S, what kind\nof relation does S have to have to R? Is R\nin force for S iff S follows R, i.e., acts\nwith the intention of doing what R requires? Or iff S\naccepts R in some weaker sense such that R is in\nforce even for S‘s intentional violations of R?\nOr can R‘s being in force for S be conceived of\nin complete independence of S‘s intentional states\nregarding R? The answers to these questions might, of course,\nbe different for different kinds of norms or rules. \n\nThese distinctions will be helpful in the following explorations\nregarding the various ways in which meaning and content have been\nconsidered to be essentially normative. Already now, however, we can\nsomewhat limit the possible readings of this claim. We can, for\ninstance, exclude the possibility that the norms of meaning/content are\ninstrumental: This would not at all sit well with the idea that these\nnorms or rules are essential to meaning. By the same token, we can\nexclude the possibility that they are of any other provenance than the\nsemantic; their force must, in some way, derive from the possibility of\nmeaning/content itself. Moreover, if the claim is that the relevant\nnorms or rules are metaphysically prior to meaning/content, they have\nto be of the constitutive kind. \n\nWe have distinguished two ways in which normativism about meaning\ncan be understood: ME normativism and MD normativism. The difference\nbetween the two, again, is that the MD normativist is committed to the\nmetaphysical priority of norms, since the norms are said to determine\nmeaning, while the ME normativist remains neutral on the issue of\nmeaning determination. Both versions of meaning normativism, however,\nclaim that the following is both necessary, and essential to, an\nexpression e’s having meaning (for a speaker, or group\nof speakers, S at a time t): \n(M)   e means M for S at t\nonly if a norm for e is in force for S at\nt.\n  \n\nHistorically, MD normativism is associated with Wittgenstein (in\nparticular the ‘Middle Period’ writings) and the tradition\nof appealing to linguistic conventions, prominent in the 1950’s and\n1960’s (in the writings of Grice, Lewis, Searle and Strawson for\ninstance). A wider notion of the normativity of meaning, ME\nnormativism, appeared on the philosophical scene more recently, and is\nassociated with Saul Kripke’s book on Wittgenstein’s rule-following\nconsiderations (Kripke 1982). In the book Kripke presents us with a\nmeaning skeptic who challenges the very idea that there are facts in\nvirtue of which our terms have a meaning.  Kripke’s skeptic puts down\ncertain constraints on the range of facts that could serve to\ndetermine meaning, among these that the essentially normative\ncharacter of meaning has to be respected. The meaning determining\nfact, Kripke argues, must be such that it follows from it how the term\nought to be applied (ibid: 11). Equipped with this\nnormativity constraint the skeptic goes on to argue against all\ntheories that fail to accommodate the required normative dimension of\nmeaning, in particular dispositionalist theories according to which\nmeaning is determined by the speaker’s dispositions to apply her terms\n(ibid: 22–37). \n\nKripke’s discussion reignited interest in the question of\nmeaning and rules, and resulted in an enormous literature both on the\nskeptical argument and the very idea that meaning is essentially\nnormative. Much of that discussion has been carried out without\nreference to the earlier debate on meaning and conventions, but\nattempts have also been made to relate the two debates. In what follows\nwe shall first discuss ME normativism, where the discussion following\nKripke’s book plays a central role, and then MD normativism. \n\nIt is clear that the type of normativity Kripke has in mind is\nmeaning engendered normativity, or ME normativity; i.e., the claim is\nthat meaning statements such as ‘expression e means\nM for S’ have normative consequences, leaving\nit open whether the norms are prior to meaning or not. Moreover, it is\nclear that the relevant normativity is that of prescriptivity,\nconcerning what S ought to\n do.[9]\nAs noted above, arguments in support of the\nthesis that meaning is essentially normative need to be based on\nsemantic premises – the normativity in question cannot\nderive from external sources. In the case of ME normativity, the\narguments may be more or less direct, depending on more or less\nsubstantial assumptions about meaning. On one end of the spectrum are\narguments that turn on the idea that there are direct conceptual entailments\nfrom meaning statements to normative consequences; on the other end are\narguments that depend on substantial theoretical assumptions about\nmeaning. In the debate, direct arguments have played a prominent role\nsince these fit the idea, implicit in Kripke, that the claim that\nmeaning is normative provides a pre-theoretical constraint on any\nacceptable theory of meaning; one that has to be accepted independently\nof one’s specific semantic theory. However, the normativity\nthesis need not serve as a pre-theoretical constraint – as long\nas the thesis is that meaning is essentially normative it qualifies,\neven if indirect arguments will be more controversial. Let us begin\nwith the most well known direct argument in support of ME normativity,\nwhat we call ‘the simple argument’. \n\nThe classic defense of ME normativity can be found in Paul\nBoghossian (1989a). According to Boghossian the normativity of meaning\nderives from the fact that meaningful expressions have correctness\nconditions. If ‘green’ means green, Boghossian\nargues, it follows immediately that ‘green’ applies\ncorrectly only to green objects, and this, in turn, has immediate\nnormative consequences for how a speaker S should apply ‘green’:\n“The fact that the expression means something implies, that is, a\nwhole set of normative truths about my behavior with that\nexpression: namely, that my use is correct in application to certain\nobjects and not in application to others (513).” (See also\nBlackburn 1984: 281, Miller 1998:198, Whiting 2007 and 2009.) The strategy,\ntherefore, is to move from (CM), to a normative conclusion,\n(ME1): (CM)   For any speaker S, and any time t: if\n‘green’ means green for S at t,\nthen it is correct for S to apply ‘green’ to an\nobject x iff\nx is green at t. \n(ME1)   For any speaker S, and any time t:\nif ‘green’ means green for S\nat t, then S ought to apply ‘green’ to\nan object x iff\nx is green at t. \n\n(CM) can hardly be challenged: Meaningful expressions have semantic\ncorrectness conditions. Of course, there is some controversy as to how\nthese correctness conditions are to be construed, whether the basic\nnotion of semantic correctness is that of truth or warranted\nassertability, for instance. However, it cannot be questioned that some\nnotion of semantic correctness is required. This, indeed, seems to be\npart of the very concept of meaning. If, therefore, the notion of\nsemantic correctness is an essentially normative notion, we would have\na very direct argument in support of ME normativity, based simply on\nconceptual entailments. Before discussing the argument, let us make\nsome preliminarily remarks concerning (ME1). \n\nFirst, what is it to apply an expression? It should be clear that\nthe relevant notion of application is that of predication. For\ninstance, we apply a predicate such as ‘green’ when we use\nit in an assertion, to predicate a property of an object x. In\nthe case of singular terms, similarly, what is of relevance is\nreferential\n use.[10]\nThe notion of application, hence, is more narrow than that of\nuse, since we use our terms in a wide variety of ways that do\nnot include the expression of judgments, as when we ask a question or\nmake a hypothetical statement (see Millar 2004: 162). \n\nSecond, how should the deontic operator in (ME1) be\nconstrued? Since (ME1) involves an embedded conditional, we\nmay in fact distinguish between three readings, a narrow scope\nreading, an intermediate and a wide scope reading: \n(ME1′)    If ‘green’ means green\nfor S at t, then (S ought to (apply\n‘green’ to x) iff\nx is green). \n(ME1″)    If ‘green’ means green\nfor S at t, then (S ought to (apply\n‘green’ to x iff\nx is green)). \n(ME1′′′)    S ought to (if\n‘green’ means green for S at t,\napply ‘green’ to x iff x is green). \n\nIn the debate, all three construals can be found. Thus, it has been\nsuggested that the intermediate scope interpretation best captures the\nintuition that if S means green by\n‘green’ she is thereby obligated to use the term in certain\nways (under certain conditions), without (as on the narrow scope\nreading) implying that the obligation is conditional on x\nbeing green (Hattiangadi 2006: 225, fn 4). Another issue concerns the\npossibility of detaching. Some favor the narrow scope reading, since it\nallows one to detach the ‘ought’, and supports the\nintuition that the semantic obligation can only be discharged one way:\nin this case, by applying ‘green’ to green objects (Bykvist\n& Hattiangadi 2007: 283). Others prefer the wide scope reading,\nprecisely because it does not allow one to detach ‘ought’\nand hence implies a more disjunctive obligation: S ought\neither to apply ‘green’ to green objects, or not mean\ngreen by ‘green’ (Gampel 1995: 228, Millar 2004:\n168–169). \n\nA related question is whether (ME1) clashes with the widely\nendorsed principle that ought implies can. As it\nstands, (ME1) can be read as implying that S has\nan obligation to apply ‘green’ to all green objects, an\nobligation that cannot possibly be fulfilled (Hattiangadi\n2007: 180). One response to this is to endorse the wide scope reading,\n(ME1′′′), since it allows the subject to\ndischarge her obligation by not meaning green by\n‘green’ – something that does seem to be in her\npower. Another response consists in removing the biconditional in\n(ME1), replacing it with a weaker principle (Whiting 2007:\n137): \n(ME2)   For any speaker S, and any time t:\nif ‘green’ means green for S\nat t, then S ought to apply ‘green’ to\nan object x only if\nx is green at t.\n \n\nThe question has been raised, however, whether (ME2) is\nsufficiently strong to support ME normativity. The trouble is that\n(ME2) does not seem to place any normative constraints on\nthe subject’s behavior. If x is green, it no longer\nfollows that S ought to apply ‘green’ to\nx, whereas if x is not green it just follows that it\nis not the case that S ought to apply ‘green’ to\nx. The latter, it has been stressed, is distinct from the\nclaim that S ought not to apply ‘green’ to\nx – for instance, it is compatible with it being\npermissible to apply ‘green’ to x (Bykvist &\nHattiangadi 2007: 280). This means that (ME2) fails to\nsupport the claim that when S applies a term in a way that is\nsemantically incorrect, then she has done what she ought not do:\n‘semantically incorrect’ and ‘ought not’ thus\ncome apart.    \n\nIn response it has been suggested that ‘ought’ in (ME1) is\nreplaced by a ‘may’. This allows the normativist to retain\nthe biconditional and yet avoid the troubles caused by the principle\nthat ought implies can: That an action is correct\nimplies only that one may do it, not that one is\nobligated to do it, and there is no principle that\nought implies can. If ‘green’ is true of\ngreen objects only then S may apply ‘green’ to an\nobject if and only if it is green, and this is not in conflict with\nthe fact that the subject is not able to apply ‘green’ to\nevery green object there is (Whiting 2009: 544 and 2010: 216, Peregrin\n2012: 88).  There is therefore some initial unclarity as to precisely which\nprescription is supposed to follow directly from (CM). A more\nfundamental question is whether the strategy of the simple argument\ncan succeed in the first place. Opponents of ME normativity do not\nchallenge (CM) which, again, seems trivially true.  Rather, they deny\nthat (CM) has normative consequences just by itself. The crucial claim\nhere is that ‘correct’ can be used both normatively and\nnon-normatively (cf. Glüer 2001, Glüer & Wikforss 2009,\n36 and 2015a). If that is true, the simple argument won’t go through:\nRather, an additional premise will be required to the effect that\n‘correct’ in (CM) is used normatively. And whether or not\nthat premise can be supplied, the argument won’t be direct\nanymore. \n\nAnti-normativists usually go further and claim that the way\n‘correct’ is used in (CM) in fact is non-normative. What\nthe appeal to correctness conditions gives us, it is claimed, is only\na way of categorizing applications of ‘green’ into two\nbasic kinds (the true and the false, for instance), and this does not\nin itself entail that one ought to apply the term in any particular\nway. The notion of semantic correctness is non-normative in just this\nsense: That an application of e is correct, does not entail\nthat it ought to be made, and, conversely, incorrect applications do\nnot immediately imply that S has violated any semantic\nprescription. If ‘green’ means green then\nS applying it to a red object implies that her statement is\nfalse, but it does not thereby follow that she has failed to do what\nshe ought, semantically, to do (Fodor 1990, Horwich 1995, Glüer\n1999, 2001, Wikforss 2001, Dretske 2000, Hattiangadi 2006;\n2009a).[11] ,[12] \n\nProponents of the direct argument respond by insisting that the notion\nof semantic correctness is a normative notion. To many, this seems a\nsimple conceptual truth holding for the notion of correctness in\ngeneral, and therefore also for that of semantic correctness (Gibbard\n2005: 358, Whiting 2007: 135 and 2009: 538). Normativists also appeal\nto ordinary usage here, suggesting that ‘correct’ is\nnormally used normatively and should therefore be interpreted that way\nin semantics as well (Whiting 2009: 538, Peregrin 2012: 84). That\nhasn’t convinced anti-normativists who point out that\ndictionaries such as Merriam-Webster’s commonly list normative and\nnon-normative usages for the adjective ‘correct’ (Glüer\n&\n Wikforss 2015a).[13]  Normativists have also argued that even if the basic semantic\nconcept itself wasn’t normative, the notion of semantic\ncorrectness still would or could be. Semantic correctness, it is\nargued, is not simply the same as, for instance, truth. Normativists\nhere appeal to a distinction stressed by Rosen (2001: 620) between\ncorrectness and the ‘correctness making feature’, the\n(non-normative) property something must have in order to count as\ncorrect. According to Rosen, correctness is a higher-order\nproperty. To say that something is correct is not just to say that the\ncorrectness making features are in place (as when someone plays the\nnotes of the Moonlight Sonata) but to make the higher-order claim that\nthe action (the piano performance) possesses the feature that makes\nfor correctness in acts of that kind (the act of playing the Moonlight\nSonata).  Similarly, it is argued, to say that applying\n‘green’ to a green object is correct, is to say that the\napplication has a certain non-normative property (the expression\napplies truly) but it is also to make the higher-order statement that\nthe application possesses the feature that makes it correct in a\nnormative sense.  Even if the basic word-world relation is\nnon-normative, therefore, it does not follow that the property of\ncorrectness does not have a normative dimension (Speaks 2009: 408,\nWhiting 2009: 540, Fennell 2013: 58–59). It is difficult to see,\nhowever, how something like ‘the correctness making\nfeature’ could strictly speaking be a second-order property\n(i.e. a property of a property). It is one and the same object that\nboth has the correctness making feature and is correct, after\nall. Rather, Rosen-style correctness is a first-order, second-level\nproperty (to use the terminology of Russell’s ramified theory of\ntypes). More importantly, even if that is the best way to construe the\nintuitive general notion of correctness, all this means is that it\nmight be possible to provide arguments for the claim that the notion\nof semantic correctness is normative even if we agree that the basic\nsemantic concept itself is not normative. But the basic\nanti-normativist challenge applies to Rosen-style correctness just as\nto any other construal of the intuitive, general notion of\ncorrectness: Since ‘correct’ can be used normatively and\nnon-normatively, there is no simple, direct implication from\ncorrectness to normativity (cf. Glüer & Wikforss 2009, 37, fn. 10;\n2015). \n\nThis strand in the debate might seem to suggest that behind the\ndiscussion of the simple argument lies nothing but a basic clash of\nintuitions. The anti-normativist denies what the normativist asserts\n– that the concept of semantic correctness is an essentially\nnormative concept. A possible conclusion, therefore, is that the\nnormativist and the anti-normativist operate with different concepts\nof semantic correctness. This raises the question, however, whether\nthere is nevertheless co-extensionality between the two concepts. As\nlong as (CM) is the common starting point this would seem to be the\ncase; any sorting effected by the normative distinction between\ncorrectness and incorrectness will coincide with the sorting effected\nby the non-normative distinction. If so, it would seem that further\narguments are required to resolve the dispute, beyond the appeal to\nintuitions: The normativist would have to provide some reasons why the\nnon-normativist notion of correctness is not a notion of semantic\ncorrectness.  This poses a special challenge to normativists who\nappeal to Rosen’s distinction and grant that the basic semantic\nrelation is non-normative: If this relation is non-normative then the\nquestion is not whether the concept of semantic correctness\ncould be given a normative construal but whether semantics\nneeds such a construal (Glüer & Wikforss 2015a). \n\nAnother strand in the discussion of the simple argument concerns the\nstatus of the relevant semantic obligations. Here it is often\nemphasized that semantic obligations are merely prima facie and may be\noverridden by other obligations, such as the obligation (in a certain\ncontext) to tell a lie. It is therefore not an objection to ME\nnormativity that there are situations in which ‘green’ means\ngreen for S, without it being the case that\nS ought to apply ‘green’ to green objects only\n(Whiting 2007: 139 and 2009: 546).  \n\nThis appeal to prima facie obligations has been challenged. What is\ndistinctive of a prima facie obligation, as opposed to a mere\ninstrumental means-end imperative, is that it cannot be overridden by\nmere desires. However, it is argued, if S has no desire to\nspeak the truth, then S has no obligation to apply\n‘green’ to green objects. For instance, if neither\nS, nor her audience, care whether S tells the truth,\nthen there is no obligation to apply ‘green’ correctly.\nHence, (CM) does not even yield prima facie obligations (Hattiangadi\n2006: 232 and 2007:189). In response, the normativists suggest that in\nsuch a situation the speaker’s use would nevertheless be\nsemantically incorrect and involve a violation of her semantic\nobligations. The violation would not be very serious, but it would\nstill be a violation (Whiting 2007: 139). This has been challenged,\ntoo. Verheggen, for instance, argues that Whiting’s attempt to back\nthis up by the possibility of criticising a speaker who misapplies an\nexpression out of mere desire is not convincing. After all, the\nspeaker acts as she does precisely because of what she means by the\nexpression – therefore, there is no semantic reason to criticize\nher (Verheggen 2011, 562). \n\nNevertheless, it would be hasty to conclude that nothing but\ninstrumental norms can be derived from meaning facts in conjunction\nwith desires. As noted above, it is clear that an appeal to merely\ninstrumental norms, or means-ends norms, fails to support the idea\nthat meaning is essentially normative. Although facts about\ncorrectness conditions may play a role in the generation of\ninstrumental norms such as “If you wish to communicate with ease\nyou ought to apply ‘green’ to x if and only if\nx is green”, the ought in question derives from the\nagent’s desires and intentions (given certain empirical facts,\nregularities, or laws), not from the correctness conditions\nthemselves. Indeed, very many facts can play a role in the generation\nof instrumental norms without thereby being intrinsically normative\n– for instance, given the laws of nature, facts about the\nweather, taken together with facts about my desires, have implications\nfor how I should dress (Coates 1986, Bilgrami 1993, Glüer 2001,\nWikforss 2001, Hattiangadi 2006, 2009b). Not all hypothetical\nnorms are instrumental, or based on contingent means-ends relations,\nhowever. An example would be the following: If you want to castle in\nchess, you should (or indeed: must) move your king and one of your\nrooks in a certain way. Similarly, it has been suggested that there is\nan important difference between hypothetical norms involving ordinary\nnon-normative facts (such as facts about the weather) and norms\ninvolving meaning facts: Since meaning facts are constituted\nby correctness conditions, meaning facts always dictate how I\nshould behave when I intend to produce a meaningful utterance. Even\nthough what they dictate depends on my particular desires in\nthe situation, the fact that they dictate something does not\ndepend on any desire – in contrast to the dictates derivable\nfrom weather facts (Verheggen 2011: 563). One might wonder, though,\nwhether the cases ultimately really are disanalogous: Just as one\nmight not care whether one gets wet or stays dry, it might seem, one\nmight just not care whether what one says is semantically correct or\nnot – do correctness conditions really dictate anything if all I\nwant to do is say something\n meaningful?[14] \n\nBefore considering alternative arguments in support of ME normativity,\nlet us comment on the relation between Kripke’s normativity\nconstraint and the so called ‘problem of error’. As noted\nabove, Kripke takes his normativity constraint to rule out\ndispositionalist accounts of meaning. Kripke formulates his objection\nto dispositionalism in various ways: Dispositions only concern what\nthe agent will do, not what she should do (1982: 29;\n37); the dispositionalist cannot account for mistakes\n(ibid. 30–35); dispositionalist facts are not guiding\nand cannot justify the agent’s actions (ibid. 37). In\nthe debate, the main focus has been on the question whether the\ndispositionalist can account for the possibility of mistake or\nerror. For an expression meaning green, for instance, it is\njust as much a platitude that mistaken or erroneous application is (in\nprinciple) possible as that the expression has correctness\nconditions. Indeed, for such an expression the possibility of error or\nmistake is little more than a reflection of (CM): There must be a\ndistinction between correct and incorrect applications. The question,\nthen, is the following: If meaning is determined by how S is\ndisposed to use her term, then how could she use the term incorrectly?\nIt has been argued that she couldn’t – rather, every apparent\nerror would just indicate a difference in meaning. Hence, the\ndispositionalist would be in danger of undermining the distinction\nbetween what seems right to the speaker (in the sense of being\ndisposed to apply a particular expression) and what is right\n(Boghossian 1989a:\n 537–540).[15]  It is much disputed whether the dispositionalist can solve this\nproblem. It should be noted, however, that the problem of error does\nnot seem to have much to do with semantic normativity (Fodor 1990:\n135–136, Bilgrami 1992, Wikforss 2001: 208, Hattiangadi 2006:\n229, 2007: 186). The error objection does not turn on the fact that\nthe dispositionalist cannot allow for semantic oughts but, rather, on\nthe fact that we must not construe the relation between the meaning\ndetermining facts and meaning in such a way that mistake is ruled\nout.  \n\nOf course, even provided with a solution to the problem of error\ndispositionalism might come to grief with Kripke’s skeptic. Solving\nthe problem of error requires showing that there is a plausible\nprinciple P assigning meanings to expressions on the basis of\nthe speaker’s dispositions to use them, a principle underwriting\nplausible ascriptions of error. On a quite plausible interpretation of\nthe skeptic’s main strategy – i.e. that of\n“quussing” candidate facts – this strategy is as\napplicable here as elsewhere. If, for instance, P assigns\naddition to ‘plus‘ on the basis of disposition\nD, the skeptic will want to know why this is the right\nprinciple – as opposed to some other principle P’\nassigning quaddition to ‘plus’ on the basis of\nD. As the mere fact of the speaker’s having D does\nnothing to determine which of these principles is the right one,\ndispositional facts are as quussable as any of the other candidates\n– and this remains the case even if your dispositionalism comes\nwith a plausible principle of meaning determination (cf. Pagin 2002,\n160f). \n\nBut pointing to the possibility of quussing is not the same thing as\nraising a normativity objection. Raising a normativity objection to\ndispositionalism requires additional considerations. Ginsborg (2011a,\nb) and (2012) suggests some such additional considerations. Ginsborg\nargues that dispositionalism can be defended against both\nKripke’s error and finitude objections and, further, that\ndispositional facts cannot be quussed. According to her interpretation\nof Kripke, the quus-hypothesis undermines those, and only those,\ncandidates for the role of meaning determining fact that aspire to\nguide, instruct, or justify a\nspeaker’s use of their terms. Since dispositionalism has no such\naspirations, it is not vulnerable to quussing (2011b, 155; for\ncriticism, see Haddock 2012, Verheggen 2015). Nevertheless, Ginsborg\nmaintains, dispositionalism cannot be the full story; taken just by\nitself, it ultimately does fall prey to a normativity objection.  \n\nTo make this plausible, Ginsborg argues that there is a version of the\nnormativity objection that is more fundamental than those investigated\nin the debate so far. In this version, the relevant norms are\nnot supposed to provide guidance, justification, or reasons\nfor using expressions one way or another – according to her, it\nis precisely these requirements that generate vulnerability to\nquussing. Rather, sensitivity to the relevant norms is needed to\nsecure understanding. The pure dispositionalist, Ginsborg\nargues, cannot distinguish the intelligent use of language from mere\nparroting or other automatic behaviour. Intuitively, the parrot, or\nthe automaton, do not use expressions with\nunderstanding. Using an expression with understanding\nrequires grasping its meaning, and this involves not only being\ndisposed to use it in a certain way, but also being disposed to\n‘take it’ that the expression ought to be used\nthe way one is disposed to use it. The attitude required is one of\n“primitive appropriateness” – such\nappropriateness cannot be explicated in terms of truth (Ginsborg 2012,\n132), and taking something to be appropriate in this sense does not\nrequire any prior grasp of rules, concepts, or meaning\n(ibid. 137f). Primitive normativity thus is one of the central notions\nin Ginsborg’s partially reductive account of meaning\ndetermination, according to which “expressions have meaning only\nin virtue of there being ways in which they [primitively] ought to be\napplied” (ibid. 132). This is a (new) form of MD-normativism,\nand we shall return to it below (in section 2.2, esp. 2.2.1 and\n2.2.4). \n\nNext, let us consider alternative arguments in support of ME\nnormativity. \n\nAn alternative to the simple argument is to suggest that there is a\nfurther notion of semantic correctness, one that is not co-extensional\nwith that of (CM) but that is both essential to meaning and normative.\nThus, it has been claimed that there is a crucial ambiguity in the\nnotion of correct use (Millar 2004: 160). On the one hand, there is\nthe notion of semantic correctness as in (CM); on the other hand there\nis the notion of correct use as in ‘using an expression in\naccordance with its meaning’. That the two do not coincide is\nclear from the fact that one may use an expression in accordance with\nits meaning, and yet make a false statement, as when one has a false\nbelief about the world (McGinn 1984, Millar 2002, 2004: 160–175;\nMoore 1954/1955: 308; Sellars 1956: 166, Buleandra 2008: 180, Fennell\n2013: 69). We must distinguish empirical mistakes from\nlinguistic mistakes, it is argued, and it is essential that\nwe are able to allow for both. Moreover, it is said, this further\nnotion of semantic correctness is an essentially normative notion, one\nthat has implications for what S ought to do or is obligated\nto do: if ‘green’ means green for S,\nthen S ought to use ‘green’ in accordance with\nits meaning. (This idea, too, goes back to Kripke who, at points,\nspeaks of what I should do, if my use of the term is to be “in\naccordance with how it was meant” (1982: 30, 37).) \n\nHow is the notion of ‘using an expression in accordance with\nits meaning’ to be construed? According to one proposal, it\nconcerns which expressions are ‘appropriate’ or\n‘suitable’ for expressing a certain belief. The notion of\n‘suitability’, in turn, is derived from the ordinary\nsemantic correctness conditions taken together with what I intend to\nexpress by my expressions: If ‘green’ applies correctly\nonly to green objects, and I mean to express my belief that x\nis green, then I ought to use the term ‘green’ and not,\nsay, ‘red’. This allows for the possibility that my use is\ncorrect in the sense of (CM), and yet linguistically incorrect (if\nx is red and I use the term ‘red’ to express my\nbelief that x is green); and, vice versa, that my use is\nincorrect in the sense of (CM), but linguistically correct (if\nx is red and I use the term ‘green’ to express my\nbelief that x is green) (McGinn 1984: 60, Millar 2004:\n162–163). Hence, in the place of (CM) we have: \n(CM*)   For any speaker S, and any time t: if\n‘green’ means green for\nS at t, then it is correct for S at\nt to apply ‘green’ to an object x iff\nS intends to express the belief that x is green at\n t.[16] \n\nPossible misuses are said to include both performance errors (such\nas slips of the tongue) and so-called meaning errors (as when the\nspeaker thinks ‘arcane’ means ancient) (Millar\n2004: 163). \n\nThis raises the question of what motivates this further notion of\ncorrectness. While it is a platitude that meaningful expressions have\nsemantic correctness conditions, it is not a platitude that an\nexpression is meaningful only if there are these further correctness\nconditions, and this leaves it open to opponents of ME normativity to\nquestion the semantic relevance of (CM*). If ‘green’ means\ngreen for S, and S uses ‘red’\nto express her belief that x is green, she may fail in her\ncommunicative intentions (although not necessarily, consider the use\nof irony and metaphor), but does it follow that she has used her\nexpressions incorrectly in a semantically relevant sense? The added\nnotion of correctness, it may therefore be argued, simply does no\nsemantic work. In this respect there appears to be an important\ndifference between the notion of semantic correctness in (CM) and that\nof (CM*): While it is essential that we allow for the possibility of\nusing an expression incorrectly in the sense of (CM), making room for\nempirical error, it may not seem as important that we allow for the\npossibility of using an expression incorrectly in the sense of (CM*),\nmaking room for linguistic error. This concern has been raised by some\nnormativists as well. For instance, Whiting (2013) argues that it is a\nmistake to try to defend normativism on these grounds, and that the\nnormativist should stick to the orthodox interpretation that takes as\nits starting point (CM). \n\nIn the literature, the most common route to the conclusion that we\nneed some such further notion of semantic correctness goes via\nassumptions about the nature of understanding (Wright 1980:\n20, McDowell 1984, McGinn 1984:109, Kotatko 1998, Millar 2004,\nBuleandra 2008, Fennell 2012). Understanding the meaning of a term, it\nis argued, involves using it in accordance with its meaning and,\nmoreover, feeling obligated to thus using it. To learn the meaning of\nan expression, McDowell writes for instance, “is to acquire an\nunderstanding that obliges us subsequently … to judge and speak\nin certain determinate ways, on pain of failure to obey the dictates\nof the meaning we have grasped” (1984: 45). This motivates the\nappeal to further correctness conditions, it is held, since a speaker\nmay fully understand a term while using it in a false judgment and,\nconversely, use the term in a true judgment while failing to\nunderstand the term properly. \n\nThe idea that understanding puts constraints on use is often combined\nwith the claim that there are rationality constraints on meaning\nattributions. Thus, it has been suggested that the normativity of\nmeaning flows from the idea that when interpreting another speaker,\nthe interpretation is constrained by the principle that the other\nshould come out as being by and large rational and not wildly\nmistaken.  Using an expression in accordance with its meaning, is\nusing the expression in a way that ‘makes sense’, and does\nnot violate these rationality constraints. The normativity of meaning,\non this view, simply follows from something like the Davidsonian idea\nthat meaning and intentional content are determined by the principle\nof charity (McDowell & Pettit 1986, 11; Millar 2004; Zangwill\n1998; Kriegel 2010). According to the principle of charity, the best\ninterpretation of a speaker S is that which optimizes overall\ncoherence and truth across S’s utterances and beliefs, but also\ntheir desires and actions (e.g., Davidson 1991, 211; for more on the\nprinciple of charity, see Glüer 2011, ch. 3). \n\nThe route via understanding depends on assumptions about the nature\nof linguistic understanding that may be challenged. For instance, even\nif it is granted that understanding the meaning of an expression\ne involves using e in certain ways (something which\nmay also be questioned, see Williamson 2007), it is a further\nsupposition that this brings with it an additional notion of semantic\ncorrectness/incorrectness. It might simply be said that unless one uses\n‘green’ in certain ways one does not mean green by\n‘green’. That is, if one does not use the expression in\naccordance with the meaning green, then it does not follow\nthat one uses one’s expression incorrectly, but merely that one\nuses it with a different meaning. This ties understanding to use\nwithout appealing to the notions of correct and incorrect use. Thus,\nthe speaker who (regularly) uses ‘arcane’ in accordance with\nthe standard meaning of ‘ancient’, means ancient\nand not arcane by her expression (Davidson 1986). In fact, it\nhas been suggested that the appeal to rationality constraints mandates\nthis: It is precisely because the standard interpretation would imply\nattributing unacceptable error and irrationality that the term needs to\nbe reinterpreted (for a discussion of the principle of charity see\nsection 2.2). \n\nA related argument appeals not to the nature of understanding, but\nto the nature of intentions (Wright 1984, 1987, McDowell\n1991). Kripke, at one point, stresses that the relation of meaning and\nintention to future action is normative, not descriptive (1982: 37).\nWhat he seems to have in mind is the idea that there is an\ninternal relation between an intention and what fulfills it:\nif S intends to do A, only doing A will\nfulfil her intention (ibid: 25). Similarly, it is suggested, if\nS intends ‘green’ to mean green, then\nS has to do certain things in order for her intention to be\nfulfilled. Obviously, it cannot be that what she has to do is apply the\nterm correctly in the sense of (CM). That would have the disastrous\nconsequence that if she applies ‘green’ to a non-green\nobject, it immediately follows that S does not mean\ngreen by ‘green’, and hence all possibility of\nempirical error is ruled out. Rather, what S has to do to\nfulfil her intention is to use ‘green’ in accordance with\nits meaning. \n\nIt has been argued that this move fails to strengthen the\nnormativist case. If, indeed, the intention to mean green by\n‘green’ is fulfilled only if S uses\n‘green’ in accordance with its meaning, then there can be\nno such thing as meaning green by ‘green’ while\nnot using the expression in accordance with its meaning. It follows\nthat failing to use an expression in accordance with its meaning is not\nusing the expression linguistically incorrectly, but using it with a\ndifferent meaning. Thus it is argued that the claim that there is an\ninternal relation between an intention and its fulfilment, far from\nsupporting ME normativity, is in tension with it (Glüer &\nWikforss 2009: 48–51). It should be noted that this objection is\npremised on the principle, mentioned above, that ought implies\nthe possibility of violation: If the relation between intention and\nfuture action is internal there is no possibility of violation, the\nreasoning goes, hence the relation cannot be both internal and\nprescriptive. (The principle is stressed by Mulligan 1999, Railton\n1999, 3f; Williamson 2000, 241; Glüer 2001; Glüer &\nWikforss 2009.) \n\nQuestions can also be raised concerning the normative consequences\nof the notion of ‘using a word in accordance with its\nmeaning’. Assuming that this further notion of correctness is\nessential to meaning and that we need to be able to allow for meaning\nerrors, does it follow that speakers ought to use their terms\ncorrectly, in this sense? Do we have a semantic obligation to use our\nexpressions in accordance with their meaning? As in the case of the\nsimple argument, it might be argued that the appearance of an\nought here derives from added normative premises, such as\ninstrumental norms concerning the ease of communication, or pragmatic\nnorms regulating speech acts. \n\nIn response it has been suggested that the relevant normative\nconsequences should not be understood in terms of obligations but,\nrather, in terms of commitments. This is the line taken by Alan Millar\n(2002 and 2004). Meaning statements, such as “‘Green’\nmeans green”, Millar argues, are true in virtue of there\nbeing a rule-governed practice. If S uses ‘green’\nto mean green, therefore, she becomes a participant in this practice\nand incurs a commitment to use the term accordingly. To be properly\ncommitted, Millar suggests, S has to be disposed to adjust her\nuse if she discovers that it is not in keeping with the meaning of the\nexpression (as when S uses ‘arcane’ to mean\nancient). The commitment is not dependent on one’s\ndesire to communicate, or on the intention to speak the truth, but\nmerely on S participating in the practice of using\n‘green’ with a certain meaning. However, Millar stresses,\nit does not follow that she ought to use her expressions a certain way,\nsince it does not follow that she ought to participate in the practice\n– there may be reasons to withdraw from the practice instead.\nHence, one may participate in a practice without it following that one\nought to “carry out the performances associated with one’s\nrole” (Millar 2004:\n 173).[17] \n\nThis proposal illustrates how ME normativity might be derived from\nMD normativity: Meaning statements have normative consequences,\naccording to Millar, because meaning is determined by the speaker\nfollowing certain rules. Metaphysically the rules come first and make\nmeaning possible. Before turning to a discussion of MD normativity, let\nus briefly consider some other arguments put forth in support of ME\nnormativity. \n\nThe arguments above are all attempts to show that meaning statements\nhave normative implications. An alternative strategy is to suggest\nthat meaning statements simply are prescriptions. When we\nstate “‘Green’ means green” we may\nappear to be making a descriptive statement whereas, in fact, we are\nprescribing how ‘green’ ought to be used (Gauker\n2007, 2011, Lance & O’Leary Hawthorne 1997, Peregrin 2012: 96,\nGibbard 2012). This proposal can either be construed as a claim about\nthe semantic content of meaning statements, or as a claim\nabout the typical use of meaning statements. Thus, a\nstatement may be used prescriptively, while having a descriptive,\nfactual content (‘In this classroom we raise our hands before\nspeaking’). \n\nIf the suggestion is that meaning statements have a prescriptive\ncontent it would provide another very direct argument in support of ME\nnormativity, one that does not have to proceed via the controversial\nclaim that the notion of semantic correctness is an essentially\nnormative notion. This is an advantage over the simple argument.\nHowever, there are also disadvantages. For instance, the question\narises whether the claim that meaning statements lack descriptive\ncontent can accommodate the role of such statements in inferential\ncontexts. (See Gauker 2007: 194–195 for a discussion.) Another\nquestion concerns the implications from ‘ought’-statements\nto meaning statements. According to the simple argument,\n“‘Green’ ought to be applied to x if and\nonly if x is green” follows immediately from\n“‘Green’ means green”. According to\nthis argument the converse also holds: “‘Green’\nmeans green” follows directly from\n“‘Green’ ought to be applied to x if and\nonly if x is green” (c.f. Gibbard 2012: 12 and\n113–115). The latter has been questioned on the grounds that even if\nit is true that ‘green’ ought to be applied this way, the\n‘ought’ in question may not have anything to do with\nsemantics but, say, with religious practices (Byrne 2002: 207). \n\nThese difficulties are avoided if, instead, meaning statements are\nsimply construed as having a prescriptive use (while having a\ndescriptive content). On either construal, however, the question\narises why we should believe that meaning statements are\nprescriptive. One suggestion is that the prescriptive function of\nmeaning statements follows from their role in coordinating our\nlinguistic use (Gauker 2007 and 2012: 279). Meaning statements are\nproposals about how terms ought to be used, and as such they\nserve to determine meaning and remove an otherwise irresolvable\nindeterminacy (see also Gibbard 2012: 109–112. As a result, “we\nall think of meanings as standards that we are obliged to conform\nto” (2007: 185). This defense of the normativity thesis\ntherefore turns on controversial issues concerning\nindeterminacy. Another proposal shuns the metaphysical questions\nconcerning the nature of meaning and appeals to the function\nof meaning statements in our practices (Lance & O’Leary Hawthorne\n1997). Instead of asking for the facts that constitute meaning, it is\nargued, we should consider the role of meaning statements in our\nsocio-linguistic practices. It then emerges that such statements serve\nthe regulative function of licensing and censoring certain uses. It\nshould be noted that unless this proposal about the function of\nmeaning statements is said to have some metaphysical\nimplications concerning the nature of meaning, it will fall short of\nsupporting the claim that meaning is essentially\n normative.[18] ,[19] \n\nIn addition, there are a variety of other arguments in support of ME\nnormativity. One such argument grants that correctness conditions are\nnot themselves normative, but suggests that we derive the normativity\nof meaning from the idea that we ought to speak the truth (Ebbs 1997,\nHaugeland 1998, Soames 1997: 221, 224). As noted above, this only\nsucceeds if the obligation in question can be said to derive purely\nfrom semantic sources. The question, then, is whether there is any\nreason to suppose that we have a semantic obligation to speak the\ntruth. The impression that there is, it has been suggested, is a\nresult of a conflation of semantics and pragmatics. Thus, it is\ncommonly held that there are rules of assertion, and some of these are\nsuch that they are violated when the speaker makes a false\njudgment. For instance, it has been proposed that there is a\n‘knowledge rule’: “One must: assert p only\nif one knows p” (Williamson 2000: 242).  However,\nopponents of ME normativity stress, these are pragmatic rules,\nregulating the performance of speech acts, not semantic ones. If such\nrules are essential for the possibility of assertion, then assertion\nis essentially normative, but it does not follow that meaning is\n(Glüer & Wikforss 2009a: 37–38, Speaks 2009). For\ndiscussion of the claim that assertion is normative, see\nthe entry on assertion. \n\nAnother set of arguments reject the focus\non correctness conditions and appeal to other aspects of Kripke’s\nnormativity objection to dispositionalist theories. For instance, it\nhas been suggested that the claim that meaning is essentially normative\nis primarily a claim about the justificatory role of meaning. Facts\nabout meaning are, essentially, such that they are able to justify\nS‘s use of her terms, able to guide S‘s\nusage. In this sense, meaning facts are like prescriptive rules, such\nas the rules of etiquette – it is of their essence that they\nguide action or give directions. The reason dispositionalism fails,\nthen, is not that the dispositionalist cannot account for error, but\nthat facts about what I am disposed to do are not essentially capable\nof justifying (Gampel 1995: 225–231, Zalabardo 1997: 480–483, Kusch\n2006: 50–94). \n\nWhether this argument succeeds depends on whether it can be shown\nthat the role of meaning in motivating action is equivalent to that of\nprescriptions. Thus, the fact that ‘green’ means\ngreen may of course guide the speaker’s actions in the\nsense that any facts do so – i.e., if S believes that\n‘green’ means green. To show that meaning facts\nplay a normatively guiding role, therefore, it does not suffice to\nappeal to the idea that meaning facts play a role in motivating action;\nit also has to be shown that the motivating role is that of a\nprescription rather than a belief (see section 2.2 below). \n\nThis raises the general question of the extent to which Kripekan\nnormativity considerations can be isolated from the larger context\nwithin which they occur, i.e., the skeptical argument. It has been\nsuggested that the focus on semantic correctness deflates\nKripke’s arguments, leaving out his claims about justification\nand guidance, for instance (Kusch 2006: 62–64). Even if the skeptical\nconclusion can be avoided, it is held, the upshot of Kripke’s\ndiscussion is that traditional conceptions of meaning have to be\nrejected: Since there are no facts that serve to determine realist\ncorrectness conditions, we need to replace the realist construal of\nsemantic correctness conditions as being judgment independent, with an\nanti-realist account of correctness conditions in terms of\njustification conditions. The normative dimension of meaning,\nultimately, is to be found in the communal practice of relying on\nothers and standing corrected (Wright 1980: 20, Hale 1997, Kusch\n2006:\n 177–206).[20] \n\nHowever, arguments have also been made in the reverse direction,\nsuggesting that the dialectic in fact is quite different. Since\nproponents of the revisionary approach rely on the idea that meaning is\nnormative, it has been suggested, their arguments do not touch the\nphilosopher who denies that meaning is normative and rejects the move\nfrom correctness conditions to prescriptions. That is, if the\nnormativity constraint need not be met, and if it suffices that we\nappeal to facts that serve to determine semantic (realist) correctness\nconditions, the skeptical challenge may appear less formidable and, as\na result, the revisionary response less motivated (Hattiangadi\n2007: 207). \n\nIn the discussion of ME normativity so far it is assumed that the\nrelevant norms are norms for action, prescriptions for the\nspeaker’s use of her expressions. This, again, is how Kripke\ndiscusses the topic and how those writing on Kripke tend to construe\nthe relevant normativity. However, as far as ME normativity goes,\nnormative consequences might also be construed axiologically. Thus, it\nmight be argued that semantically correct applications, by themselves,\nare valuable. This, too, would show that meaning is an\nessentially normative notion, although in a different sense than the\nstandard one. And in this case too, the crucial question would be\nwhether the step from (CM) to normative consequences can be motivated.\nDoes sorting S’s applications into the semantically\ncorrect and the semantically incorrect ones, by itself imply that\nactions of one or the other of these kinds are valuable (Glüer\n2001:\n 60–61)?[21] \n\nAnother option would be to construe the rules or norms of meaning as\nconstitutive ones (cf. section 1.2 above). Rules of meaning, the idea\nwould be, are rules for the use of expressions that determine the\nmeaning of these expressions. Appealing to constitutive rules thus\nwould mean accepting what we call MD normativism: It would mean\naccepting that expressions have meaning because there are rules or\nnorms in force for their use. \n\nMeaning determining normativism (MD normativism) is the claim that\nmeaning is essentially such that it is (at least in part) determined\nby\n norms.[22]\nPrima\nfacie, this can either mean that the supervenience base for meaning,\nthe set of facts metaphysically determining meaning (see section 1.1\nabove) contains norms, or, more precisely, normative facts (cf.\nWedgwood 2007, Part II; 2009), or that the principle governing meaning\ndetermination is a “normative principle” (Jackman\n2004, Other Internet \n Resources).[23]\n In the end, this might not be a substantive difference, however. A\nnatural idea would be that a normative determination principle\ninvolves a mapping essentially mediated by norms, or normative\nfacts. But then, placing the relevant normative facts in the\nsupervenience base (and using one principle of determination), or\nconstruing them as part of another principle of determination (working\non a supervenience base not containing any normative facts) might\namount to no more than notational\n variation.[24] \n\nThe single most common form of MD normativism holds that the meaning\nof linguistic expressions is determined by rules for their\nuse. This idea was famously formulated by Ludwig Wittgenstein, and\nwe shall concentrate on it in this section. Drawing an analogy between\nthe rules of games and those of language, Wittgenstein wrote in his\nso-called ‘Middle Period’: \n\nAt a minimum, MD normativism claims that the following not only is\nessential for, but also metaphysically prior to, an expression\ne‘s having meaning M (for a speaker, or group\nof speakers, S at a time t): \n(MD)   e means M for S at t only if\nthere is a rule R for the use of e in force\nfor S at\n t.[25] \n\nBut why should we think that meaning is (essentially)\nrule-determined? And if it is, how exactly does this work? What kind of\nrule could do this job? What does it mean for such a rule to be in\nforce for a speaker, and where does this force come from? We shall take\nthese questions up in turn. \n\nSince ancient times, philosophers have observed the arbitrary,\ncontingent nature of the connection between linguistic expressions and\ntheir meanings. Moreover, this connection seems to be somehow\n‘made by us’; what could be more natural than to think that\nit is established by convention? \n\nBut even though conventions might be norms or rules somehow made by us,\nthe MD normativist cannot simply claim, for instance, that it is a\nconvention of English that ‘green’ means green.\nThe MD normativist wants to provide an account of what meaning is, and,\nto be informative, such an account needs to be formulated in\nnon-semantic terms (cf. Davidson 1982). Moreover, it does of course not\nfollow from a relation’s being ‘arbitrary’,\ncontingent, or even ‘made by us’, that it is conventional\nin any interesting sense.[26] \nThere are innumerable regularities in our\nbehavior (such as moving down hallways by putting one foot in front of\nthe other) that are neither necessities of any sort, nor due to\nconvention. An observation that might cast some doubt on the idea that\nthe regularities of linguistic usage are due to convention is the\nfollowing: People who follow rules, or conventions, when, for instance,\nplaying chess or driving cars on the right hand side of the road in\ncontinental Europe, can usually, upon reflection, both at least roughly\nformulate the relevant rule or convention and give it as their reason\nfor acting as they did. When it comes to the semantic rules of natural\nlanguage, this is strikingly far from being the case. There are various\nways in which the MD normativst could try to accommodate this\nobservation (see section 2.2.2 below), but some explanation clearly is\nneeded. \n\nOver and above its intuitive appeal, there are various more\ntheoretical reasons for MD normativism. It is, for instance, plausible\nto think that meaning, in some way or other, is determined by the\nuse speakers make of linguistic expressions. If meaning\ndetermining rules are rules governing the use of linguistic\nexpressions, MD normativism provides the beginnings of an answer to the question of just\nhow use does this. A natural thought here is that semantic rules effect\na distinction between (semantically) correct and incorrect use of an\nexpression. An expression governed by such a rule consequently is an\nexpression that has (semantic) correctness conditions and, thus,\nmeaning (cf. Glock 2000). If meaning determining rules moreover are\nprescriptions, MD normativism provides a metaphysics directly\nunderwriting the most common form of ME normativism: ME\nprescriptivism. \n\nMD normativism is often taken to provide solutions to certain\nclassical problems of meaning determination, most prominently the\n“problem of error”. As we noted above (section 2.1.1), the\nproblem of error, by itself, would seem to be a problem for\nnaturalistic accounts of meaning determination quite independently of\nnormativity. It might be argued, however, that it is precisely because\nmeaning is determined normatively that any naturalistic account is\nbound to misconstrue semantic correctness conditions. Or it might be\nargued that MD normativism’s superior capacity to deal with the\nproblem of error provides evidence for its being the right account of\nmeaning determination. \nAn argument of the first kind might draw inspiration from the writings\nof Donald Davidson. Davidson (1970) famously argued that meaning and\nintentional content are determined by a constitutive principle called\nthe “principle of charity”, while physical predicates and\nconcepts obey constitutive principles of a nature so radically\ndifferent as to prevent any reductive account of the former in terms\nof the latter. According to Davidson, speakers essentially are by and\nlarge rational creatures and beliefs are by their nature\n‘veridical’ (Davidson 1983), that is, by and large true in\nthe circumstances under which they are held.  According to the\nprinciple of charity, the best interpretation of a\nspeaker S therefore is that which optimises overall coherence, or\nrationality, and truth across S’s utterances, propositional attitudes,\nand intentional actions (e.g., Davidson 1973, 1974, 1991; for more on\nthe principle of charity, see Glüer 2011, ch. 3). Because of its appeal\nto rationality, the principle of charity has been interpreted as a\nnormative principle, and Davidson as a normativist (see for instance,\nMcDowell 1984; Hornsby 1997, 87; Gampel 1997; Hurley 1998, 5; Glock\n2000; Jackman 2004; Wedgwood 2007, 161ff; Kriegel 2010). \nThis is disputed, however; it has been argued that precisely because\nthe principle of charity is the principle constitutive of meaning and\ncontent in Davidson, it cannot play any normative role. It determines\nwhat meaningful utterances (contentful mental states) are, not how\nanything should be or what anyone should do (cf. Glüer 2001;\nWikforss 2001; Schroeder 2003; Engel 2008, 187ff; for a different\nargument to the conclusion that charity is not a normative principle,\nsee Bilgrami 1992, 102ff.). Quite independently, the claim that\nrationality is essentially normative might not appear any less\ncontroversial than the claim that meaning is (cf.  Schnädelbach\n1990; Kolodny 2005; Broome 2007; Glüer & Wikforss 2013a). \n\nThe MD normativist might also argue, as indicated above, that\nnormativism prevents the problem of error from arising. Such arguments\ncan take two forms. The normativist can argue that for instance the\nsupervenience base that non-normative dispositionalism works with needs\nto be restricted: It is not the whole of a speaker’s dispositions\nto use their terms that determines meanings, but only a certain kind of\ndisposition and this kind can only be specified by means of its\nnormative properties. In this vein, Wedgwood argues more generally that\nit is only “rational” dispositions that determine\nintentional content (where rationality is taken to be a normative\nproperty; cf. Wedgwood 2007, 167ff; 2009). Normative teleosemantics can\nbe construed as making a similar move: Here, it is those dispositions\nrealizing the biological function of the mechanism of using an\nexpression that determine meaning (where ‘biological\nfunction’ is taken to be something normative; cf. Millikan 1990,\nNeander 1995). \n\nMore radically, the MD normativist can take problems such as that of\nerror as indicating that dispositionalism misidentifies the very kind\nof entitities meaning supervenes on: It is not how you are disposed to\nuse an expression that determines its meaning, but how you are supposed\nto use it, i.e., the norms that are in force for the use of the\nexpression in question (cf. Glock 2000, Brandom 1994, 159). Their being\nin force then might, or might not, be further reducible or analyzable,\nbut not to dispositions for the use of expressions. \n\nAlternatively, the MD normativist might adopt an account according to\nwhich meaning determination has two components, a dispositionalist and\na normativist component. Ginsborg (2011a, b; 2012) argues that to mean\nsomething by a linguistic expression, the speaker must not only be\ndisposed to use it in a certain way but also be disposed to take the\nway she is disposed to use it to be “primitively\nappropriate” (see above, 2.1.1). Her idea is that while\ndispositions do suffice for determining meanings – in the\nsense in which meanings can be correlated with the\ndispositions of both the genuine speaker and the parrot or automaton\n– (primitive) norms are nevertheless required for\ngenuinely meaningful speech or understanding (cf. esp. Ginsborg 2012,\n138; Ginsborg 2011a, 244f). Such an account of meaning determination\nwould be “partially reductive” (Ginsborg 2011a, 230; 249):\nit would combine a naturalist component with a non-semantic but\nnormative (and minimally intentional) component. On Ginsborg’s\naccount, however, the (primitive) normative attitudes required for\ngenuinely meaningful use of linguistic expressions do not determine\nsemantic correctness conditions for these expressions –\nthat job is to be done by the speaker’s basic dispositions to use\nthem. \n\nThere is a widespread tendency to see naturalism and normativism as\nincompatible in the theory of meaning determination (see also section 4\nbelow), but from what we just said, their relation would seem to be\nmore complicated. Prima facie, both reductive naturalism (such as, for\ninstance, a version of teleosemantics) and non-reductive naturalism\n(such as, for instance, Davidsonian dispositionalism) would seem\ncompatible with (certain forms of) MD normativism. Normativism is\nincompatible with reductive naturalism only if meaning is determined by\nnormative facts or properties that are not themselves naturalistic\n(normative teleosemanticists, for instance, argue that the biological\nnotion of a function is normative). Normativism is incompatible with\nnon-reductive naturalism only if there are no non-normative facts\nmeaning supervenes\n upon.[27] \n\nOther influential ideas behind MD normativism include\nWittgenstein-inspired skepticism towards meanings as ‘Platonic\nentities’; in this tradition, meanings and concepts themselves\nare construed as products of our norms or conventions (cf. for\ninstance, Baker & Hacker 1985, 269ff). Another idea derives from\nmeaning’s psychological role: It has been argued that, since\ncompetent speakers are guided in their use of expressions by the\nknowledge of their meanings, a knowledge that is general in form, such\nguidance must be construed as guidance by rules (cf., for instance,\nBoghossian 2008, 489; see also section 2.1.2 above). The question here\nwould be whether guidance by some state with general content is\nsufficient for rule guidedness (cf. Glüer & Wikforss\n2010a). \n\nAssume that meaning is determined by rules. How exactly does this\nwork? What kind of rule could do this job? What does it mean for such a\nrule to be ‘in force’ for a speaker or group of\nspeakers? \n\nMeaning determining rules clearly would be constitutive\nrules (see section 1.2 above): Meaningful use of linguistic\nexpressions is metaphysically impossible without such rules. Moreover,\nmeaning determining rules (usually) are supposed to determine not only\nthat an expression has meaning, but also which\nmeaning it has. These ideas are drawn on by a great number of\nphilosophers, including Wittgenstein scholars such as Baker and Hacker\nor Glock, as well as philosophers such as von Wright, Sellars, and\nSearle. \n\nHowever, as we saw above there are different conceptions of\nconstitutive rules. On the traditional view, a constitutive rule is\nsuch that it ‘creates’ new kinds of action, i.e., kinds of\naction that could not be performed if the rule did not exist, or were\nnot in force. Such rules typically can be brought into the following\nform: \n(CR)   In C, doing X counts as doing Y.\n  \n\nSearle suggests that meaning is determined by such rules (1963,\n42ff). It is not obvious, however, how this would work. Rules like this\ncannot determine meaning by means of the line of thought sketched\nabove: By directly effecting a distinction between correct and\nincorrect uses of an expression – rules of the form (CR) do not\nmake any such distinction (cf. Glüer & Pagin 1999). Such rules\nmight, however, determine meaning more indirectly (cf. Glock 2000). The\nfollowing might be such a rule, for instance: \n(CR1)   In C, uttering s counts as saying\nthat p,\n  \n\nwhere s is a sentence. It has been argued, however, that\nsuch a rule is not truly constitutive; it does not ‘create’\nthe possibility of performing actions of the relevant kind, i.e., saying\nthat p. Rather, saying that p seems to be possible\nindependently of (CR1), and (CR1) only provides\none (among many possible) means of performing such an action (cf.\nGlüer & Pagin 1999, 218f). \n\nIt might be more promising to allow meaning determining rules to\nhave prescriptive force. In that case, it would be possible for them to\ndirectly effect a distinction between (semantically) correct\n(prescribed or allowed) and incorrect (forbidden) uses. They could\nnevertheless be constitutive of using an expression with the determined\nmeaning insofar as it would be impossible to so use the expression\nunless the prescription was in force for the speaker. \n\nWhat, then, does it mean for a meaning determining rule R\nto be in force for a speaker S’s use of an expression\ne (at a time\n t)?[28] \nBroadly, there are three main\noptions for the MD normativist (see section 1.2 above). According to\nthe first, using e (at t) has to be\nmotivated by R. For R to be in force for\nS’s use of e, S has to follow\nR in the sense of attempting to do what is in accordance with\nR. On the second construal, S has to accept\nR in some sense not requiring (all) particular uses of\ne to be motivated by R. Both of these would\nplausibly seem to require S to have certain intentional\nstate(s). But, third, R‘s being in force for S\ncould also be construed as independent of any of S’s\nintentional states (with respect to R). \n\nThe laws of the state, for instance, would seem to fall into the\nthird category; they are in force even for those individual citizens\nwho do not accept them. Analogously, meaning determining rules might be\nin force in a speech community independently of an individual\nspeaker’s acceptance of them. Many games are in the second\ncategory; they are such that even though participation requires players\nto accept their rules, participants nevertheless can intentionally\nviolate these very rules within the game. For instance, intentional\nspearing does occur in icehockey games, and will be punished precisely\nbecause the rule against spearing is in force even for players who\nspear intentionally. Again, in semantics the situation might seem\nanalogous: Speakers can intentionally say semantically incorrect things\nwithout their expressions losing or changing their meanings (cf.\nRailton 1999; Glüer & Pagin 1999; Glüer 1999; 2001; Wikforss\n2001). Nevertheless, it might not be possible for these rules to be in\nforce in complete independence of a whole speech community’s\nattitudes towards it, and even the individual speaker might need to at\nleast in general accept such rules. \n\nThe most common idea, however, is that expressions ‘get’\ntheir meanings by speakers’ following the rules for\ntheir use (see, for instance, Baker & Hacker 1985, 154ff, Glock\n1996, 323ff); speaking meaningfully is conceived of as a form of\nrule-guided action. Let’s call this form of MD\nnormativism ‘guidance normativism’. \n\nGuidance normativism by itself is neutral on the question of whether\nan individual speaker could adopt, and follow, rules for her own\nidiolect (as, for instance, Baker & Hacker 1985, 169ff, hold), or\nwhether it necessarily takes a community of speakers to put semantic\nrules into force. Many philosophers subscribe to\n‘communitarianism’, however; they hold that so-called\n‘solitary’ languages, i.e., languages spoken by only one\nspeaker, are impossible. When combined with MD normativism,\ncommunitarianism usually construes meaning determining rules as\nconventions adopted by whole speech communities. This is\noften motivated by an interpretation of Wittgenstein’s rule-following\nconsiderations and the so-called ‘private language\nargument’ according to which these show that the notion of a\nmistake does not have any application outside a whole community of\nspeakers (among others, Kripke 1982, Wright 1980: 218–220;\nPeacocke 1981, McDowell 1984, Williams 1999). Another motivation is\nprovided by, among others, Dummett. Dummett argues, first, that\nregular use by a whole community of speakers is a condition on an\nexpression’s having linguistic meaning, and, second, that therefore a\nnormative attitude towards the common language is required of each\nindividual speaker (Dummett 1991, 85). Davidson questioned both steps\nof Dummett’s argument; while regularity of use usually makes\ncommunication easier there is, according to him, no regularity such\nthat, on every particular occasion, accordance with it would be either\nnecessary or sufficient for successful communication (cf. Davidson\n1986). Moreover, even if regularity were required, Davidson argued, it\nwould not matter how it came about; communication would be possible\nwhether or not the required regularity was a product of normative\nattitudes (cf. Davidson 1994; Glüer 2013 provides a survey of\nthese discussions). \n\nEven more radically, it has been questioned whether it is even\npossible to draw any substantive distinction between rule guided and\nmerely regular behavior at this fundamental level. Yet such a\ndistinction is crucial for guidance normativism. As Quine classically\nnoted, on pain of vicious regress, meaning determining rules or\nconventions cannot be explicitly and deliberately adopted; they must\nsomehow be “implicit” in the behavior of speakers. But\nthen, Quine argued, we risk depriving the notion of a linguistic rule\n“of any explanatory force and reducing it to an idle label”\n(Quine 1935, 106). The crucial question thus is what the distinction\nbetween rule guided behavior and merely regular behavior amounts to\nwhen it comes to meaning determining rules. \n\nIntuitively, behavior guided by an (implicit or explicit) rule\nR is behavior that can be explained by means of R or,\nmore precisely, behavior that can be given a\nreasons-explanation involving R, an explanation in\nterms of the reason-providing intentional states of the agent. Examples\nof such an “intentional condition” on rule following would\nbe an intention to follow R (e.g. Baker & Hacker 1985,\n155; Glock 1996, 325), or some other state of accepting or\ninternalizing R (Boghossian 2008). \n\nApplying a traditional belief-desire model, Glüer and Pagin\n(1999) suggest understanding guidance by a rule R in general\nby means of the following practical syllogism: \n(PA1)   I want to do what R requires, \n(B)       R requires that I Φ, \n(PA2)   So, I want to Φ, \n\nwhere (PAi) is a pro-attitude (desire,\nintention, acceptance), and (B) a belief. They also argue that if a\nmeaning determining rule R for an expression e\nrequires e to be used correctly, there is no room for such\nrules in the explanation of speech acts: If a speaker wants to say that\np, a rule requiring them to use e correctly not only\nis of no help, there is no “slot” in the practical\nsyllogism into which it would coherently fit (Glüer & Pagin\n1999, 223f). It would thus seem that if an intentional condition on\nguidance by meaning determining rules can be integrated into a general\nmodel of reasons explanation, an alternative way of doing that is\nrequired. \n\nAnother question concerns the relation between thought (or\nintentional states in general) and language. On any account construing\nthought as dependent on language, as well as on any account construing\nthought and language as interdependent, and on any account according to\nwhich mental content itself is determined by rules governing mental\nexpressions, an intentional condition on rule guidance would inevitably\nlead guidance normativism back into vicious regress (cf. Boghossian\n1989a; 2008). For instance, if having an intentional state with a\ncertain content is itself a matter of being guided by a content\ndetermining rule, then another intentional state is required for having\nthe first one, and so on ad infinitum. It has therefore been argued\nthat according to Wittgenstein there must be a basic form of rule\nfollowing that is not subject to any intentional condition, but\n“blind” (Wright 2007). Alternatively, it has been argued\nthat therefore the late Wittgenstein did not conceive of meaningful use\nof language as rule guided anymore (Glüer & Wikforss\n2010a). \n\nAn independent, general argument against an intentional condition on\nrule guidance has been provided by Boghossian (2008, 493f): He argues\nthat the relevant intentional state would be a state with general\n(prescriptive) content, and that acting under particular circumstances\non an intentional state with general content always involves some sort\nof inference. Inference itself, however, essentially involves\nfollowing a rule, and thus a regress – reminiscent of that\nfamiliar from Lewis Caroll (1895) – ensues. However, this\nargument crucially depends on the assumption that inference is\nessentially rule guided, an assumption which is at least controversial\n(cf. Glüer & Wikforss 2010a). \n\nTogether with the observation recorded earlier – that speakers do\nnot usually seem to have the kind of privileged access to semantic\nrules that we would expect if these were action guiding in the\nintentional sense – considerations like these have driven some\nphilosophers to try to locate the explanatory power of meaning\ndetermining rules elsewhere. Thus, some draw an analogy between the\nexplanation of speech dispositions by means of systems of semantic\nrules and the evolutionary explanation of animal traits and behavior by\nnatural selection. In each case, there are regularities of behavior the\nexplanation of which is non-intentional, but which are nevertheless not\nmerely accidental. In contradistinction to truly evolutionary\nexplanations, explanations of speech dispositions by means of\n(institutionalized) systems of rules remain only quasi-evolutionary;\nthe crucial explanans is not natural selection, but the system of rules\nthat exists prior to the individual speaker’s acquisition of\nlanguage (cf. Sellars 1954, Searle 1995). While such explanation might\nwork well for the use an individual speaker learns to make of the\nexpressions of an existing language, whether any distinction between\nrule explained and merely regular behavior has been substantiated now\ndepends on substantiating a further distinction: that between a system\nof rules and one of mere regularities. To take Sellars’ example:\nWhy would the bee dance instantiate mere regularities that receive a\ntruly evolutionary explanation, while a human natural language\ninstantiates a system of rules? (Cf. Glüer 2002, 173f.) \n\nAnother idea might thus be to locate meaning determining normativity\nin the very idea of an evolutionary explanation, in the idea of a\nbiological function, for instance, the possession of which explains why\ncertain dispositions or mechanisms (for speech or mental\nrepresentation) are selected for, as in normative \nteleosemantics.[29] Yet\nanother possibility would be to combine computational and teleosemantic\nideas for rule following at the level of mental representation. Here, a\ndistinction between personal level rule following and sub-personal rule\nfollowing could be used. Thus, it has been proposed to construe\nsub-personal rule following as analogous to computational rule\nfollowing, and semantic rules as rules deriving from the biological\nfunctions of our cognitive apparatus (cf. Jacob 2005, 200f). Semantic\nrule following would then allow for truly evolutionary explanation. It\nhas been argued that this would amount to a highly problematic\ndispositionalism, not about meaning, but about sub-personal rule\nfollowing itself (cf. Boghossian 2008). However, if the notion of a\nbiological function helps solve the classical problems of meaning\ndispositionalism, it might solve those of dispositionalism about\nrule-following, too. Still, the basic question recurs: What it is that\ndistinguishes a sub-personal regularity from a performance governed by\na sub-personal rule? Since not everything with a biological function\nwould seem to be rule governed even in this sense, any account along\nthese lines will at least need to add further \nelements.[30] \n\nGinsborg (2011a, b; 2012) suggests that the normativity of meaning can\nbe defended by interpreting the relevant ‘ought’ in way\nquite radically different from that dominant in most of the\nnormativity debates: as a “primitive ought”. Interpreted\nas a primitive ought, it conveys the primitively normative attitudes\nspeakers must have towards their own uses of linguistic\nexpressions. Having primitively normative attitudes does not require\nprior grasp of rules, concepts, or meanings. Moreover, the norms\nspeakers need to be primitively conscious of do not guide or\njustify them in their use of expressions (Ginsborg 2011b,\n170).[31] \nAnd finally, the primitive ‘ought’ relevant to meaning\ncannot be explicated in terms of, or equated with, truth\n– to be primitively correct is more fundamental than\nbeing semantically correct: Primitive normativity is not required to\ndetermine what is semantically correct (and incorrect), but rather to\n“distinguish the production of a term from mere noise”\n(Ginsborg 2012, 132, quoting Blackburn 1984, 281), or, more generally,\nto determine which behaviour is “subject to normative evaluation\nat all” (2011a, 243, fn.\n 21).[32] \n\nPrimitive normativity thus is what distinguishes the behaviour of the\nspeaker who uses her terms with understanding from that of\nthe parrot, or automaton. Using a term with understanding requires\nmore than just being disposed to use it a certain way, Ginsborg\nargues; it requires understanding that it has a certain\nmeaning. If a speaker for instance uses ‘slab’ to mean\nslab, she needs to grasp or recognize that it means\nslab (2012, 135). Ginsborg’s ambition is precisely to provide\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for what it is to have this\nunderstanding. \n \nThe account of meaning determination she arrives at has two\ncomponents. Since one of them is a requirement of primitive\nnormativity, primitive normativity qualifies as a (new) kind of\nmeaning determining normativity. In rough outline, the account looks\nlike this: If e has meaning, the first disposition suffices to\ndetermine which meaning it has. But e has meaning only if the\nsecond disposition is in place. Moreover, if both conditions are\nfulfilled, having the primitively normative attitude of taking the use\none is disposed to make of e amounts to understanding that\ne means M. \n\nThese conditions are not only necessary, but sufficient for meaning,\nGinsborg argues, because they allow us “to make sense of a given\nresponse being correct or incorrect” (2011a, 245), where\ncorrectness now is semantic correctness. Once these\nconditions are fulfilled, a particular use of e might not\nonly be such that you “did not do what you were disposed to do,\nbut also did not do what you were disposed to regard as\nappropriate” (ibid.). This, Ginsborg submits, is enough to make\nsuch a use of e into a mistake. Once these conditions are\nfulfilled, that is, the uses you are disposed to make of e\n“can retrospectively be identified as the extension of\n[e]” (2012, 138). And then, your primitively normative\nattitude amounts to understanding that e means what it does. \n\nAt the time of this update, Ginsborg’s interpretation of the\nnormativity of meaning (and content) as primitive has not been widely\ndiscussed. As the proposal is very interesting, and indeed rather\ndifferent from more established interpretations of the normativity of\nmeaning, this no doubt will change soon. Among the questions to be\nasked, it seems to us, are at least the following: Is it really the\ncase that dispositional facts cannot be quussed (see above, 2.1.1;\nHaddock 2012; Verheggen 2015)? And if not, can Ginsborg’s\ntwo-component account be salvaged? If the account is extended to\nintentional content (as Ginsborg herself hints it can, for instance in\n2012, 127, fn.1) won’t that give rise to regress worries? Is it\nreally plausible to claim that a primitively normative attitude\ntowards the use one is disposed to make of an expression amounts to\nknowing (or grasping or recognizing) what the expression means? How\nare we precisely to understand the primitive notion of appropriateness\nor correctness? On the one hand, there seems to be a need for\nprimitive and semantic correctness to coincide – if it is\nto be plausible that awareness of primitive correctness amounts to\nknowledge of meaning. As Ginsborg explains, once her conditions are\nfulfilled, what is primitively correct can be identified with what is\nin e’s extension, i.e. with what is semantically\ncorrect. On the other hand, the two notions need to be distinct\n– if it is to be plausible that having a primitive\nnormative attitude does not require concepts like those of rule or\ntruth. So what precisely is the difference between the two\nnotions?[33] And\nif they are different, doesn’t that mean that an attitude of\nprimitively taking a use of an expression to be correct cannot amount\nto semantically taking it to be correct? Simply because these\nattitudes have different contents? \n\nIn the normativity debate the main focus has been on meaning: This\nis true of the Kripke discussion as well as of earlier discussions\nconcerning the rulishness of language. However, parallel claims have\nalso been made about mental content and recently the thesis that\ncontent is essentially normative has come into focus (McDowell &\nPettit 1986, Brandom 1994, Engel 2000, Boghossian 2003, Gibbard 2003,\nMillar\n 2004, Jarvis 2012).[34] \n\nContent normativism claims that the following is both necessary, and\nessential to, a mental state M‘s having a content\np: \n(C)   M has content p only if there is a rule, or\nsystem of rules, R in force for\n M.[35] \n\nThe relevant notion of content is that of propositional content,\nsomething that can be judged, and the norms in question govern the\n‘use’ of concepts. We intend the talk of propositions and\nconcepts in this context to be uncontentious, and not depend on any\nspecific construals of these notions. A proposition, simply, is\nanything that has truth conditions essentially; it is whatever the\npropositional attitudes are attitudes towards. And talking of\n“concepts” should not be understood as implying a\ncommitment to either structured contents or to a language-like,\nsyntactically structured medium of representation. In this sense, a\nconcept is ‘used’ whenever a subject has an intentional\nmental\n state.[36] \n\nAs in the case of meaning, we distinguish between CE normativity,\nwhich is neutral on the question how content is determined, and CD\nnormativity which takes the norms to be metaphysically primary. We\nshall begin by discussing CE normativity. \n\nAccording to CE normativity statements of the form ‘mental\nstate M has content p’ have normative\nconsequences. The norms are typically construed as norms of action,\nmost commonly as prescriptions, but could also be construed\naxiologically. That is, the claim need not be that the relevant norms\nguide our use of concepts, but could just be that it is a property\nessential to their having content that certain mental states (true\nbeliefs, for instance) are valuable. \n\nAs in the case of meaning, we may distinguish between more or less\ndirect arguments. One way to provide a direct argument for CE\nnormativity would be to proceed from the notion of correctness\nconditions, in analogy with the simple argument (Boghossian 2003: 85).\nJust as meaningful expressions have correctness conditions essentially,\nalong the lines of (CM), so do concepts: The concept green,\nfor instance, applies to an object x if and only if x\nis green. However, unlike in the case of (CM), the application relation\nhere is just that between a concept and the objects that ‘fall\nunder’ it. For normativity to enter some connection has to be\nmade with the subject who employs the concepts, with her mental\nstates. \n\nThe standard normativist strategy consists in appealing to the use\nof concepts in propositional attitudes, and to derive the normativity\nof content from that of the propositional attitudes. Thus, the relevant\nnotion of application is suggested to be that of using the concept in a\npropositional attitude, in particular that of belief. Arguments for CE\nnormativity, therefore, typically appeal to the connection between\ncontent and the propositional attitudes. We shall consider two such\ncommon arguments: one that goes via the nature of belief, and one that\ngoes via ideas about concept grasp. \n\nThe argument from belief proceeds in two steps: It is argued, first,\nthat belief is essentially normative, and second, that there is an\nessential connection between belief and content such that if belief is\nessentially normative it follows that content is, too. Our main concern\nhere is not with the normativity of belief, but some comments\nconcerning the first step are required. \n\nAccording to the most common proposal, the normativity of belief\nderives from the connection between belief and truth. It is in the\nnature of belief, it is held, that it aims for truth. The proposal is\nnot merely that beliefs, essentially, have contents that are true or\nfalse, but that beliefs, essentially, are correct or incorrect as a\nresult of the content being true or false. Belief is simply that state\nwhich derives its correctness conditions from the content (Velleman\n2000, Engel 2001, 2013, Nordhoof 2002, Wedgwood 2002, 2007, 2013,\nBoghossian 2003, Gibbard 2003, 2005, 2012, Shah 2003, Speaks\n2009). \n\nIn response, it has been argued that what is essential to belief is\nmerely that beliefs have contents that are true or false, not that one\nought to believe a content if and only if it is true. The appearance of\nnormativity, it is suggested, derives from other sources. For instance,\nas epistemic agents, we seek truth. And having true beliefs is\nessential to fulfilling our goals. This just shows that true beliefs\nhave an instrumental value, and fails to support the normativity of\nbelief thesis. Moreover, it is argued, even if it is claimed that truth\nhas a non-instrumental value, the value in question is derived from\nmoral or other values, not from the nature of belief as such (Papineau\n1999, 2013, Dretske 2000, Davidson 2001, Horwich 2013). \n\nQuestions have also been raised concerning how the norm of belief is\nto be understood. With respect to meaning the question arose whether\n(ME1) violates the principle that ought implies\ncan. In the case of belief, a similar worry arises if the norm\nof belief is formulated in a parallel fashion, by proceeding from the\ncorrectness conditions of beliefs to normative consequences: \n(CB)   The belief that p is correct if and only if p. \n(NB1)   S ought to believe that p if and\nonly if p. \n\nThe trouble is that (NB1) implies that S ought\nto believe everything that is true, an impossible task. This\ndifficulty, it has been argued, is not solved by appealing to a\nwide-scope reading of ‘ought’ since there are values of\np that are such that S could neither bring it about\nthat p is false, nor bring it about that she believes\np (Bykvist & Hattiangadi 2007:\n 284).[37]\nThe most common reaction,\ninstead, is to weaken the norm (Boghossian 2003: 37): \n(NB2)   S ought to believe that p only\nif p.\n  \n\nThis norm does not imply that S ought to believe everything\nthat is true, and hence does not put impossible demands on S.\nHowever, as noted in the discussion of (ME1) above, the\nquestion arises whether (NB2) suffices to provide any real\nconstraints on S‘s belief formation. If p is\ntrue it does not follow that S ought to believe p,\nand if p is false it merely follows that it is not the case\nthat S ought to believe p – not that\nS ought not to believe p (Bykvist & Hattiangadi\n2007: 280).[38]\nIn response, normativists have made the same move as in the case of\nmeaning, and suggested that the ‘ought’ in (NB1) is\nreplaced with a ‘may’ (Whiting 2010: 216–217, 2013b:\n125). It has been objected that this is too weak since it undermines\nthe fundamental role of the norm of truth when it comes to explaining\nother evidential and inferential norms (Bykvist & Hattiangadi\n2013: 113–114). \n\nIt has also been suggested that the normativity of belief should be\nconstrued in terms of ‘role oughts’, and that these are not\nsubject to the principle that ought implies can\n(Chrisman 2008, Feldman 2001). Each role comes with criteria of\nexcellence and these, in turn, imply obligations: Teachers ought to be\nclear, parents ought to be caregiving, etc. Norms for actions,\ntherefore, derive from norms of\n being.[39]\nSimilarly, as human beings we play the role\nof believers, of creatures with intentional states, and being engaged\nin this role we ought to do it well: We ought to believe that which is\ntrue (for instance). Hence, on this view, (NB1) is a norm of\nbelief even if it places impossible demands on ordinary\n subjects.[40] \nA related idea is that the relevant norms should be understood in\nterms of the ‘telos’ of belief: Just as a map is a map\n(giving a correct or incorrect picture of the world) only insofar as\nit is designed to represent the world, and in this sense\nought to represent the world correctly, so a belief can be\nsaid to be correct or incorrect only insofar as representing the world\nbelongs to its telos, to what it ought to do. Since this type of\n‘ought’ applies to the representing objects (such as maps\nor beliefs) and not to agents, it is argued, they are not\naction-guiding and the principle that ought implies\ncan does not apply (Jarvis \n2012).[41] \n\n Another set of questions concerns the fact\nthat (NB1) is an objective\n norm.[42]\nUnlike a subjective norm, such\nas ‘S ought to believe that p only if\nS has evidence for p’, (NB1) does\nnot engage with S‘s reasons, her beliefs and desires,\nand this raises the question how (NB1) can serve to guide\nour belief formation. In response, it has been suggested that many\nnorms are objective norms (‘Buy low and sell high!’) and\nthat the only consequence of (NB1) being an objective norm\nis that it may not be transparent to S how to obey\n(NB1) (Boghossian 2003: 38). However, it has been objected\nthat the main trouble with (NB1) is not a failure of\ntransparency. It is clear that objective norms can guide, but they do\nso via our beliefs, and it has been argued that this causes trouble in\nthe case of (NB1). The trouble is two-fold. In order to be\nguided by (NB1), S would have to have a belief about\nwhether p is true. This means, first, that in order to be\nguided by (NB1) the subject would already have had to from\na belief as to whether p and hence the guidance comes too\nlate; and, second, that whatever conclusion the subject comes to as to\nwhether p, the norm tells her to hold that very belief (if\nshe forms the belief that p the norm gives her a reason to\nbelieve p and if she forms the belief that not-p the\nnorm gives her a reason to believe not-p) (Glüer &\nWikforss 2009:\n 44).[43] \n\nIt is therefore disputed whether (NB1) can be said to be\na norm of belief, regulating our belief\n formation.[44] \nAssuming that belief is intrinsically normative, however, the\ndecisive question is whether this has any implications for\ncontent. Why should the fact that belief is normative imply that\ncontent is? Indeed, it has been suggested that the opposite is true\nsince if belief is normative the appearance of normativity of content\ncan simply be explained by appealing to the normativity of belief\n(Speaks 2009: 409). According to Boghossian, the normativity of\ncontent derives from the fact that there is a constitutive connection\nbetween the notion of content and the notion of belief (Boghossian\n2003). This is so, he argues, since we could not grasp the notion of\ncontent without first grasping the role contents play in\nbelief. Moreover, Boghossian argues, although contents play a role in\nother attitudes as well, there are reasons to think that the concept\nof belief is conceptually primary: For instance, S could not\nhave the concept of desire without first having the concept of belief\n(ibid: 42–43). If so, the normativity of belief supports CE\nnormativity. \n\nThe claim that the concept of belief is primary to that of desire\ncan be questioned. Thus, there is empirical evidence from developmental\npsychology that children acquire the concept of desire prior to\nacquiring that of belief (Wellman 1993). It has also been argued that\nbelief and desire are conceptually interdependent (Miller 2008). More\nimportantly, even if it can be shown that the concept of belief is\nprimary to that of desire, and of the other propositional attitudes,\nthe question arises whether indeed one could not grasp the concept of\ncontent without grasping that of belief. Prima facie, grasping the\nconcept of a propositional attitude such as belief is rather distinct\nfrom grasping the concept of content, since it involves the idea of\ntaking up an attitude towards content.\n [45]\nMoreover, Boghossian is committed to the\nstrong claim that opponents of content normativity fail to grasp the\nconcept of content (or, alternatively, that they operate with a\ndifferent concept). \n\n An alternative strategy would be to avoid\nthe appeal to conceptual entailments and argue that there is a\nmetaphysical connection between mental content and belief such that if\nbelief is essentially normative, content is. Such an argument may be\nmore or less direct, going via more or less contentious assumptions\nabout mental content. For instance, versions of conceptual role\nsemantics imply that there is an essential link between mental content\nand belief as do versions of informational theories of content (Dretske\n1981, Fodor 1990), although the latter are typically coupled with a\nnon-normativist account of belief. Another line of reasoning appeals to\nthe idea that there is a constitutive connection between grasping a\nconcept, understanding a content, and using it in the propositional\nattitudes. \n\nTo possess a concept, it is sometimes suggested, is to have the\ncapacity to use the concept in various propositional attitudes. Since\nit is essential to the propositional attitudes that they stand in\ncertain rational interconnections with one another, it is argued, this\nessential normativity transfers to concepts and contents. Possessing a\nconcept, grasping it, incurs a commitment to use the concept ‘in\nkeeping with its content’, in the various propositional\nattitudes. If the speaker fails to do so, she has misused the\nconcept in question (Millar 2004, McDowell & Pettit 1986, Gibbard\n2012: chapter 6). \n\nThis argument runs parallel to the argument provided by Millar in\nthe case of meaning. Even if that argument is accepted, however, the\nquestion arises whether it can be applied to concepts and content,\nsince the notion of failing to use a concept in ‘keeping with its\ncontent’ appears more problematic than the notion of failing to\nuse a word in accordance with its meaning (McGinn 1984: 146–147, Millar\n2004: 180–181). It is relatively unproblematic to speak of\nunderstanding the meaning of an expression (or misunderstanding it),\nbut in the case of concepts there is nothing corresponding to the\nexpression. To ‘understand’ a concept is simply to possess\nit, to use it in thoughts. Hence there seems to be little or no room for the idea\nthat S misunderstands a concept either. If S reasons\nas if she possesses the concept ancient rather than the\nconcept arcane, it would seem to follow not that there is any\nmisuse of concepts but that she has another concept. \n\nOne strategy is to distinguish between possession conditions and\nattribution conditions (Peacocke 1992: 27–33). This separates the\nconditions that determine S‘s concepts from conditions\nfor the attribution of the concept to S. As a consequence,\nthere is a potential gap between how S uses the concept, her\ngrasp of it, and how it should be used if she were to use it in keeping\nwith its content. To illustrate the distinction, it is common to appeal\nto Tyler Burge’s discussion of how social factors, under certain\nconditions, serve to determine content (Burge 1979, Peacocke 1992: 29,\nMillar 2004: 181–188). Burge gives an account of concept attribution\nthat goes via word meaning. To be attributed the concept\narcane, on this view, it suffices that S uses the\nexpression ‘arcane’ by and large correctly, ‘in\nkeeping with its content’ – if she is committed to her\ncommunity practice of using the corresponding expression\n‘arcane’, and this practice determines that\n‘arcane’ expresses arcane. What determines her\nconcept, thus, is not merely facts about her use and dispositions to\nstand corrected, but facts about the use of the term in the wider\npractice. It follows that speakers typically have an incomplete grasp\nof the concepts they think with and, as a result, tend to misuse these\nconcepts. \n\nLeaving aside the controversial question of whether we can separate\npossession conditions of concepts from attribution conditions, it might\nbe asked whether Burge’s social externalism can be employed to\nsupport CE normativity. Burge’s argument depends on the idea that\nthe individual is committed to the community practice (Burge 1979:\n94–95, 101–102, Millar 2004: 182). But if the normativity in question\nis made conditional on the individual’s commitment to the\ncommunity, it does not follow that content is essentially normative.\nAfter all, an individual who is not thus committed would still have\nconcepts. (Equally, in the case of the experts, the suggested normative\ndimension would seem to drop out.) What would seem to be required,\nrather, is an argument to the effect that the concept expressed is\nnecessarily determined by the community practice, independently of\nS‘s commitments. \n\nAnother argument for content normativity based on incompleteness of\nunderstanding derives from Burge (1986). Burge suggests that meaning or\ncontent characterizations, such as Sofas are artifacts to be sat\nupon, have a normative function in our practices: They set\nstandards that guide our thinking. However, Burge argues, such\ncharacterizations can be rationally doubted, even by the experts; they\nare objectively right or wrong, independently of our practices (ibid:\n704–707). It follows that content is ultimately not determined socially\nbut by the nature of the objects that we causally interact with, and\nthat there are “intellectual norms that govern thinking about\nobjective matters” (ibid:\n 697).[46]\nThis argument from externalism therefore does\nnot depend on the assumption that individuals are committed to the\ncommunity practice. Instead, it depends on a version of physical\ncontent externalism applied to all kind terms (not just the natural\nkind terms), combined with the assumption that metaphysical necessities\nshould be construed as norms (see Wikforss 2003). \n\nArguments from concept grasp, again, typically appeal to the idea\nthat there are rationality constraints on concept attributions. As\nnoted in the discussion of ME normativity, the question has been raised\nwhether the idea that there are such constraints coheres with\nnormativism. It has been suggested that this question is particularly\npressing in the case of content. When it comes to meaning, there is the\noption of attributing meaning errors and explaining the error by\nappealing to the subject’s mistaken conception of the\nmeaning of an expression, thereby rationalizing her reasoning and\nactions. In the case of concepts, this option is not available, since\nthe error is said to occur at the level of content. It would either\nhave to be argued that the error can be rationalized some other way,\nor the claim that there are rationality constraints on content\nattributions would have to be rejected (see Brown 2004, Wikforss\nforthcoming-b). \n\nLike MD normativism, CD normativism is a claim about the foundations\nof intentional content: Intentional content is metaphysically\ndetermined, or constituted, by rules or norms. Since the relevant norms\nor rules govern intentional mental states, the CD normativist needs to\nfind a kind of state plausibly subject to rules or norms that by the\nsame token determine its content. Because of its intimate connection\nwith truth, knowledge, and inference, belief is the natural candidate.\nBoth truth and inferential connections in turn are intimately connected\nwith content. \n\nThus, there are three main candidates for CD norms or rules, two\nobjective and one subjective: \n(NB1)   S ought to believe that p\niff p. \n(NB3)   S ought to believe that p\niff S knows that\n p.[47] \n(NB4)   S ought to believe that p iff it is\nrational for\nS to believe that p. \n\nNote, that (NB1), (NB3), and (NB4)\neach operate with a different underlying concept of correctness; if\nbelief is defined by its “aim”, it can therefore be defined\nby only one them. Moreover, these notions of correctness can differ\neven extensionally, i.e., give different verdicts regarding the\ncorrectness of individual beliefs. Nevertheless, if conceived of as\nprima facie norms, there is nothing incoherent in supposing them all to\nbe in force for belief simultaneously. \n\nThe idea is that beliefs have contents only if (one or more of)\nthese rules are in force and, moreover, that their being in force is\nconstitutive of the contents they have. And again, a rule\nR‘s being in force can roughly be interpreted in three\nways: As requiring the subject to follow R, to\naccept R in a sense not requiring (general)\nfollowing, or as independent of the subject’s attitudes and\nintentional states towards R (see above, 1.2; 2.2.2). \n\nAs in the case of meaning, the most common idea on the market is\nthat the rules constitutive of content are rules that subjects having\ncontentful mental states need to follow. Thinkers inspired by\ntraditions such as pragmatism and/or Wittgensteinian anti-platonism\nmight also require these rules to be, in some sense, of our own making\n(Baker & Hacker 1985, Brandom 1994). Let us, again, call the\nversion of CD normativism that requires rule following “guidance\nnormativism”. Since the idea of being guided by objective norms\nis problematic for norms like (NB1) and (NB3)\n(see above, 3.1), guidance normativists often conceive of the relation\nbetween their favorite objective norm and (NB4) in\nparticular ways: If the objective norm is given priority, one\nsuggestion is that it is followed by means of following the\nsubjective rules (Boghossian 2003). If the subjective rules are seen as\nbasic, objective ones can be explained by means of them in some way or\nother. For a normative inferentialist like Brandom, for instance, this\nis the question of the relation between normative inferential role and\ntruth conditional content, and he tries to show that the latter can be\nanalysed in terms of the former. Gibbard (2005) suggests that, in\ngeneral, objective oughts can be reduced to subjective\n ones.[48]\nOther options\nfor the guidance normativist are to conceive of (NB4) as the\nbasic norm for belief, or to construe the nature of belief as given by\nboth (NB4) and (NB1) (Wedgwood 2007, 162) or\n(NB3). \n\nCandidates typically given for CD rules are rules supposed to govern\n(rational) reasoning. These can be rules of theoretical, as well as of\npractical reasoning: Prime examples are inference rules such as modus\nponens or the law of non-contradiction, and the rule that, in the\nabsence of background belief to the effect that the senses are not to\nbe trusted in the given situation, a belief that p is to be\nformed on the basis of a perceptual experience as of p. The\nprinciples of rational decision making and those of epistemic\nrationality (as, for instance, formalized in decision theory or\nBayesian epistemology) are further\n examples.[49]\nPurely formal rules would\narguably not suffice for general content determination; normative\ninferentialists such as Brandom (1994; 2000) or Peregrin (2008)\ntherefore include norms governing material implication among the\ncontent determining rules. Brandom typically describes the relevant\nnorms as norms determining what a thinker is “committed”\nand “entitled” to in holding a particular attitude towards\na particular content. \n\nThe plausibility of guidance normativism, be it with respect to\nmeaning or content, depends on whether it can account for the\ndifference between rule following and mere accordance with the relevant\nrules. It has been argued by several authors that CD normativism, on\npain of vicious infinite regress, cannot put any intentional\ncondition on rule guidance (Boghossian 1989a; 2008; Glüer &\nWikforss 2009, see also above, 2.2): If another intentional state\nM2 is required to make the formation an intentional\nstate M1 into a rule-guided performance and,\nthereby, give it its content, yet another intentional state\nM3 will be required to give M2\nits content. And so on, ad infinitum. \n\nA pragmatic conception of rule guidance might therefore seem to be\nrequired. The single most elaborate such conception is Brandom’s\nnormative version of inferentialism (Brandom 1994). To avoid regresses,\nBrandom takes norms implicitly “instituted” by our\npractices to be basic and proposes a pragmatic phenomenalism\nabout such norms. Phenomenalism is the claim that objective\n“deontic statuses” are to be explained in terms of our\nnormative attitudes. Something’s being correct, that is,\nis to be explained in terms of the attitude of taking it to be\ncorrect. Therefore, the norms in question are “in some sense\ncreatures of ours” (1994, 626). Nevertheless, Brandom explicitly\naims at securing, and explaining, the “objectivity of\nconcepts” (1994, xvii). Commentators such as Rosen (1997) and\nGlüer and Wikforss (2009) therefore interpret Brandom as offering\na realist account of content, not some form of expressivism (as other\ncommentators, such as Gibbard (1996), attribute to Brandom). Brandom\naims at reducing the intentional to the normative, while holding the\nnormative itself to be irreducible. In this sense, it is “norms\nall the way down” (1994, 44; 625). Ultimately, being\ncorrect is to be explained in terms of being correctly taken\nto be correct. \n\nGeneral questions that have been raised about this project include\nthe question of whether it ultimately can secure the possibility of\nobjective concepts or contents, contents the truth of which is\nindependent of our attitudes. It has been argued that since normative\nstatuses are explained by means of further normative statuses,\npragmatic phenomenalism cannot tell us anything informative about how\nwe make or “institute” the basic norms implicit in our\npractices (cf. Rosen 2001, Hattiangadi 2003). In a similar vein, it has\nbeen questioned that pragmatic phenomenalism manages to account for the\ndifference between mere accordance with these rules and\n“instituting” them; if for any normative status to be\ninstituted by an implicit norm a further normative status already needs\nto be so instituted, an infinite regress of (implicit) norms might\nensue despite the pragmatist nature of the proposal (cf. Hattiangadi\n2007, 197; Glüer & Wikforss 2009, 60ff). This regress might\nnot be vicious if the project is interpreted as an expressivist one,\nhowever. \n\nEven if guidance normativism would ultimately not be able to sustain\na substantive difference between following a content determining rule\nand mere accordance with it, one might still hold on to the claim that\nthere are contentful intentional states only if the rules of\nrationality are in force for them. Such force might require acceptance,\nbut not (general) guidance, or it might be completely independent of\nthe attitudes of thinkers. Insofar as acceptance itself is intentional,\nhowever, CD normativism might prove viable only if the force of the\nrelevant rules or norms is construed as completely independent of the\nattitudes of the thinkers. Some relevant ideas as to how such rule\nfollowing might be understood were already discussed above, at the end\nof section 2.2. \n\nThe idea that the normative in some sense is not part of nature goes\nback at least to Kant (see, for instance, Critique of Pure\nReason (1781), A 547). Already Hume (in the Treatise\n(1739–1740)) argued against the metaethical naturalist that\nought cannot be derived from is – to try to do\nso would be to commit a so-called “naturalistic fallacy”.\nWith the “open question argument”, Moore (in Principia\nEthica (1903)) added a weapon to the anti-naturalist’s\narsenal also against giving naturalistic accounts of moral evaluations:\nAccording to the open question argument, there is no naturalistic (set\nof) concept(s) analytically equivalent to the moral concept of\ngoodness, since no matter what naturalistic definition is given, the\nquestion whether all and only things satisfying it are good still makes\nsense. Much of recent normativism about meaning/content continues in\nthis anti-naturalist tradition; many normativists about meaning/content\nhold that the essential normativity of meaning/content makes at least (fully)\nreductive naturalism untenable. \n\nThis is certainly how many have construed Kripke’s Wittgenstein; it is\npart of his skeptical campaign against semantic facts in general that\nsuch facts cannot be reduced to whatever precisely is allowed in a\nnaturalistic supervenience base for meaning/content. As we have seen\nabove (section 2.2), matters are rather more complicated here,\nthough. On the one hand, it is a matter of dispute among\nteleosemanticists, for instance, whether the biological concept of a\nfunction is a normative concept, or not. On the other, it is clearly\npossible to endorse the claim that meaning/content supervenes upon\nnon-semantic, non-normative facts without thereby being committed to\nreductive naturalism. In between, there is quite some room, for\ninstance for partially reductive accounts construing meaning/content\nas determined by a dispositional and a non-semantic, but normative\ncomponent.  Nevertheless, it seems clear that if there is an argument of the\ngeneral, a priori kind Kripke’s skeptic would need, it is\nsupposed to come from normativism (cf. Boghossian 1989a, 509; Wikforss\n2001, 203; Hattiangadi 2007, 64).  Such an argument could take a\nweaker, intensionalist, and a stronger, extensionalist, form\n(cf. Boghossian 1989a, 532ff): The stronger argument concludes that no\nreductive naturalist account of meaning/content will be extensionally\ncorrect: For any meaning/concept, such an account will either include\nobjects in its extension that, intuitively, do not belong there, or\nexclude objects from its extension that, intuitively, do belong there,\nor both. As we saw above (section 2.2.1), this “problem of\nerror” is a problem for many naturalistic accounts of\nmeaning/content, but as such it does not yet have anything to do with\nnormativity. The normativist could, however, argue that it is\nprecisely because of their essential normativity that no naturalistic\naccount of meaning/content can be extensionally correct. The weaker\nargument grants extensional correctness, but argues that no\nnaturalistic reduction will get the intension of the notion of\nmeaning/content right; it will inevitably miss the normative character\nof what is semantically correct, its deontic or axiologic\ncharacteristics. \n\nEither way, these are at most argument templates; it seems fair to say\nthat at this point in time, the case from normativism against\nreductive naturalism about meaning/content has not yet been fully\nmade.  It has been suggested that the semantic normativist look to\nmetaethics at this point; arguments in the tradition of Hume and Moore\nmight well be adaptable to their case (cf. Miller 1998, 188ff;\nHattiangadi 2007, 38ff; Gibbard 2012; Zalabardo 2012). As Hattiangadi\nargues, the semantic normativist’s case might then prove hostage to\nwhatever controversial assumptions these arguments rely on\n(motivational internalism, for instance, might be such an issue), thus\nremoving normativism further from being the pre-theoretical constraint\non acceptable accounts of meaning/content that Kripke’s skeptic meant\nit to be. \n\nNormativism about meaning/content might thus exclude (fully) reductive\nnaturalism about meaning/content, but it should be noted that adopting\nnormativism would not seem to be the only option for the\nanti-reductivist (cf. Mulligan 1999, 136f; Glüer & Wikforss\n2009, 63ff). What the normativist construes as norms or rules of\nmeaning/content, principles such as (CM) or inferential rules such as\nmodus ponens, might also be construed in a very different way: As, or\nin analogy with what Frege called “laws of truth” (Frege\n1918: 30). In the same vein, Husserl called the ‘laws of\nlogic’ “ideal” (Husserl 1913: 56)). These\n‘laws’ are neither prescriptions for thinking, nor\nnomological generalities of our psychology. Their\n‘validity’ or necessity is sui generis; if\nanything, it is what we might today call\n metaphysical.[50]","contact.mail":"kathrin.gluer@philosophy.su.se","contact.domain":"philosophy.su.se"},{"date.published":"2009-06-17","date.changed":"2018-01-12","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/meaning-normativity/","author1":"Kathrin Glüer","author1.info":"http://people.su.se/~kgl/kathrin.htm","author2.info":"https://www2.philosophy.su.se/wikforss/","entry":"meaning-normativity","body.text":"\n\n\n\nThere is a long tradition of thinking of language as conventional in\nits nature, dating back at least to Aristotle (De\nInterpretatione). By appealing to the role of conventions, it is\nthought, we can distinguish linguistic signs, the meaningful\nuse of words, from mere natural ‘signs’. During the last\ncentury the thesis that language is essentially conventional has played\na central role within philosophy of language, and has even been called\na platitude (Lewis 1969). More recently, the focus has been less on the\nconventional nature of language than on the claim that meaning is\nessentially normative in a wider sense, leaving it open whether the\nnormativity in question should be understood in terms of conventions or\nnot (Kripke 1982).\n\n\n\nNormativism is not limited to language, however – versions of\nit have also been defended in the case of mental content. It has been\nsuggested that a mental state has content only if there are certain\nnorms in force for it. According to many, the essentially normative\naspect of meaning and content reflects a deep-lying contrast between\nmind and nature.\n\n This essay discusses a number of central normativist theses with\nrespect to meaning as well as to content. We begin by identifying\ndifferent versions of meaning normativism, presenting the arguments\nthat have been put forth for and against them. We then continue by\ndiscussing content normativism, providing an overview of the\ncontemporary debate. Both debates are very much on-going and at this\npoint there is little consensus as to whether normativism holds for\neither meaning or content. Since the first publication of this essay\nmuch of the debate has focused on two of its central issues: First, it\nhas been debated whether meaning normativism can be derived from the\nfact that meaningful expressions necessarily have correctness\nconditions. This is the argument we labelled the ‘the simple\nargument’ and in section 2.1.1 we discuss recent contributions\nto the debate. Second, the nature of rule-guidance has been much\ndiscussed, in particular relating to content normativism, and new\nproposals have been made as to how it is to be understood. We discuss\nthis in sections 2.2 and 3.2. It has also been argued, however, that\nthe normativity essential to meaning (and content) is of a more\n‘primitive’ character than has so far been recognized in\nthe debate. We discuss this in section 2.1.1, 2.2.1, and specifically\nin section 2.2.4.\n\n\n\nNormativism in the theory of meaning and content is the view that\nlinguistic meaning and/or intentional content essentially is\nnormative. Both of its components, normativity and its\nessentiality to meaning/content, can be interpreted in a number of\ndifferent ways, however; as a result, there is a whole family of more\nor less closely related views laying claim to the slogan\n“meaning/content is normative”. \n\nTo say that meaning/content is essentially normative is\nmaking a claim about the nature of meaning/content, about what\nmeaning/content is. Consequently, it is at least a matter of\nmetaphysical necessity, possibly even of conceptual necessity, that\nthere is no meaning/content without\n norms.[1]\nBut which is prior?\nMetaphysically speaking, are certain norms valid, or in force,\nbecause certain things – such as linguistic\nexpressions/intentional states – have certain meanings/contents?\nOr do such things have (a certain) meaning/content because\ncertain norms are in force? Accordingly, for a given set of norms, the\nclaim that meaning/content is essentially normative can be read in\ndifferent ways: As a claim that remains neutral on the question of\nmetaphysical priority, as claiming priority for meaning/content, or as\nclaiming priority for norms. \n\nAssuming that one or the other is prior if the neutral claim is\n true,[2]\n we have distinguished between two forms of\nnormativity: meaning/content ‘engendered’ (ME/CE)\nnormativity and meaning/content determining (MD/CD)\nnormativity (cf. Glüer & Wikforss 2009). MD/CD norms are\nsuch that they metaphysically determine, or constitute,\nmeaning/content; here, the norms are prior. ME/CE normativity is\nnormativity ‘engendered by’, or consequent upon,\nmeaning/content. Given the actual shape of the debate where it is\noften argued that normative consequences can be more or less directly\nderived from something’s having meaning/content while remaining\nneutral on the issue of how this meaning/content is determined, we\nshall here interpret ME/CE normativism as any position according to which\nmeaning/content is essentially such that it has normative\nconsequences, regardless of how meaning/content is\n determined.[3] \n\nMD/CD normativism is an answer to the “foundational”\nquestion: What is it that determines meaning (and/or content)?\nIn the context of such “foundational semantics” (the term\nis Stalnaker’s), the relevant determination relations\naren’t merely mathematical, or functional, relations; rather,\nrelevant are those relations “in virtue of” which something\nhas meaning, i.e., relations “constitutive of”, or essential\nto, having meaning. Relations of metaphysical determination are often\ncalled “supervenience” relations. Such relations can be of\nmany kinds. For instance, they can be one-one (equivalence relations)\nor many-one (“mere” supervenience relations). Some of them\nallow for analytic or ontological reduction, others do\n not.[4]\nBut all of them involve three elements: a set of supervenient entities\nSE, a set of entities forming the supervenience\nbase SB, and a principle according to which what\nis in SB determines what is in\nSE (a function from SB to\n SE).[5]\n What is important is that a principle of determination is required in\nany foundational account. As long as only the supervenience base is\nspecified, its elements can be mapped onto meanings/contents in any\nold way, thus leaving meaning/content completely\nindeterminate. Arguably, this is one of the most important lessons of\nWittgenstein’s so-called rule-following considerations (Pagin\n2002). \n\nThere is a tradition of reading these considerations as ruling out\nrealism about meaning/content (for instance Dummett 1959; Kripke 1982;\nWright 1986; Travis 2006; see also Hattiangadi 2007), the view that\nhaving meaning/content consists in having, or determining, objective\njudgment-independent conditions of truth or correctness. In this\ntradition, an anti-realist, epistemic conception of truth is used as\nthe basic semantic concept, and it is often argued that this is\nrequired precisely because there is no set of facts, no supervenience\nbase capable of determining realist meanings/contents. Despite its\npartially revisionary character, semantic anti-realism does not rule\nout a substantive metaphysics of (anti-realist) meaning/content,\nhowever. It can be combined with both ME/CE and MD/CD normativism. \n\nThis is not true, however, of radically quietist readings of\nWittgenstein according to which substantive metaphysical claims about\nmeaning/content cannot (sensibly) be made at all (cf. Boghossian\n1989a). While normativism does not commit its proponents to the\npossibility of reducing meaning/content to the normative, or even to\nthe possibility of an account of meaning/content in terms of\nsubstantive necessary and sufficient conditions, it does require the\npossibility of stating substantive necessary conditions on\nmeaning/content (cf. McDowell 1991; 1992). \n\nTo say that meaning/content is essentially (ME/CE or MD/CD)\nnormative is to say that meaning/content is essentially such\nthat certain norms are valid, or in force, whenever something\nhas meaning/content. Being valid, or in force, however, can be\nunderstood along cognitivist or non-cognitivist lines. Cognitivists\nanalyze normative statements as factual, truth-conditional claims\nanswering to an independent normative reality of normative facts.\nNon-cognitivists claim that such statements are non-factual, and\ntypically analyze them in terms of the psychological states of their\nsubjects. Standardly, contemporary non-cognitivists (most prominently,\nSimon Blackburn and Alan Gibbard) nevertheless hold on to a\n“minimalist” realism about the normative. As the debate\nbetween cognitivists and non-cognitivists is of some, but not central,\nimportance for our topic, we shall therefore assume that\nnon-cognitivism can be combined with normativism\nabout\n meaning/content.[6] \n\nMore central will be the question: What kind of norm, what kind of\nnormativity, are we dealing with here? Prima facie there might seem to\nbe as many possible readings of both ME/CE and MD/CD normativism as\nthere are kinds of norms or normativity. We shall go through the most\nrelevant distinctions (most of which can be found in the\nclassifications provided by von Wright 1963, chap. I; Schnädelbach\n1990, 83ff). We shall see that there are at least some kinds of norms\nor normativity that cannot be combined with the idea that\nmeaning/content is essentially normative. \n\nThe most basic distinction relevant here is that between norms\n for action and norms of\n being.[7]\nNorms of being are often\nassociated with evaluations; they tell us that a certain state of\naffairs ought to obtain, i.e., is valuable or good in a certain\nsense. Norms for action, on the other hand, tell us what to\ndo. There is broad consensus that the normativity of\nmeaning/content involves norms for action, but there at least does not\nseem to be anything inconsistent about construing it in purely\naxiological terms. \n\nConcerning norms for action, there are at least four more dimensions\nalong which relevant distinctions can be drawn. First, we can\ndistinguish between instrumental and non-instrumental norms. An\ninstrumental norm tells us what to do in order to reach a certain\ngoal, what means to employ to a certain end, where the relation\nbetween means and end is contingent. An example von Wright gives\nis: \n(D)   If you want to make the hut habitable, you ought to heat it (von\nWright 1963, 10). \n\nThe normative force of instrumental norms characteristically is\ncontingent upon the agent’s having a certain goal, their\nintending, or desiring, to reach a certain end, while that of\nnon-instrumental norms is not so dependent. \n\nAmong non-instrumental norms for action, many distinguish between\nprescriptions and constitutive rules (cf. Rawls 1955; Midgley 1959; von\nWright 1963; Shwayder 1965; Searle 1969, chap. 2.5; Schnädelbach\n1990). For reasons that will become clear shortly, we prefer to\ndistinguish between prescriptions and other norms for action, and\nbetween constitutive and non-constitutive norms or rules. Thus, second,\nprescriptions are norms that can typically be formulated in deontic\nvocabulary, i.e., in terms of what an agent ought (not) to, or should\n(not) do, or in terms of what is prescribed, forbidden or allowed. The\nlaws of the state are prime examples, and so are those of morals and\netiquette. Prescriptions can be conditional, as for instance\n(P1), or unconditional, as for instance (P2): \n(P1)   At a formal dinner, you ought to wear a tie. \n(P2)   You ought to tell the truth. \n\nFor conditional prescriptions, we can, third, distinguish between\nthose where the deontic operator (‘ought’,\n‘should’) takes wide scope over the conditional and those\nwere it takes narrow scope: \n(CPw)   You ought to (if C then do\nX). \n(CPn)   If C, you ought to (do\nX). \n\nThe main difference between (CPw) and\n(CPn) is that on (CPw), there\nare two ways of discharging your obligation: by doing X or by\nmaking it the case that C is not fulfilled. On\n(CPn) there is only one way of discharge: once\nC is fulfilled, you must do X.  Only on\n(CPn), that is, can the consequent be\ndetached. \n\nFor prescriptions, two principles are usually taken to hold\nintuitively. First, the principle that ought implies\ncan, i.e., that to be prescribed, or allowed, actions have to\nbe such that it is at least in principle possible to perform them. And\nsecond, the principle that ought implies the possibility of\nviolation; there would seem to be no point to forbidding impossible\nthings. Both principles are, however, slightly controversial. \n\nFourth, we can distinguish between constitutive and non-constitutive\nnorms or rules. Non-constitutive rules or norms are rules or norms for\na type of action, or activity, that exists independently of the rules.\nThe prescriptions of dinner etiquette are prime examples; they regulate\nthe independently existing practice of eating. Rules of games, on the\nother hand, are prime examples of constitutive rules; in some sense,\nthey “create” the very actions, or activities, they\nregulate. It would, for instance, be impossible to play chess, ice\nhockey, or soccer, without the rules of chess, ice hockey, or soccer.\nAccording to Midgley (1959) and Searle (1963, 33ff), constitutive rules\ntypically, and naturally, can be put into the following form: \n(CR)   In C, doing X counts as doing Y.\n \n\nAccording to this suggestion, constitutive rules tell us that, in a\ncertain context (for instance, a game of soccer), an action of type\nY (for instance, scoring a goal) can be performed by means of\nperforming an action of a different type X (for instance,\nkicking the ball into the goal). Prescriptions do not naturally fit\nthis form. It has therefore been objected that this characterization of\nconstitutive norms is too narrow – there are prescriptions that\nare constitutive of certain games (for instance, it’s\nconstitutive of ice hockey that spearing is forbidden). A wider\ncharacterization of constitutive norms or rules thus counts rules or\nnorms as constitutive of a certain action, or activity, A iff\nA cannot be performed, or engaged in, unless these norms are\nin force (cf. Glüer & Pagin 1999). \n\nThen, there are three more relevant distinctions that apply both to\nnorms for action and to axiological norms. First, we can distinguish\nbetween prima facie and categorical norms (or obligations) (cf. Ross\n2002 [1930]). Prima facie norms are norms that can be overridden by other\nnorms. Thus, it might be that under very many circumstances, you ought\nto tell the truth, but not under all; under special circumstances this\nobligation may be overriden by other obligations, for instance, the\nobligation not to deliver your friend to the secret police. Categorical\nnorms are such that they cannot be thus overridden. \n\nSecond, we can distinguish between norms of different provenance.\nThere are the norms of morals, etiquette, and prudence, the laws of the\nstate, and the rules of games. Analogously, values of different kinds\ncan be distinguished. \n\nAnd third, there are questions about what it means for each of these\ndifferent kinds of rules and norms to be valid, or in force for an\nindividual subject.[8] \nDoes this force derive from the individual, from a\nwhole collective of individuals, or something else? If a norm or rule\nR is in force for an individual subject S, what kind\nof relation does S have to have to R? Is R\nin force for S iff S follows R, i.e., acts\nwith the intention of doing what R requires? Or iff S\naccepts R in some weaker sense such that R is in\nforce even for S‘s intentional violations of R?\nOr can R‘s being in force for S be conceived of\nin complete independence of S‘s intentional states\nregarding R? The answers to these questions might, of course,\nbe different for different kinds of norms or rules. \n\nThese distinctions will be helpful in the following explorations\nregarding the various ways in which meaning and content have been\nconsidered to be essentially normative. Already now, however, we can\nsomewhat limit the possible readings of this claim. We can, for\ninstance, exclude the possibility that the norms of meaning/content are\ninstrumental: This would not at all sit well with the idea that these\nnorms or rules are essential to meaning. By the same token, we can\nexclude the possibility that they are of any other provenance than the\nsemantic; their force must, in some way, derive from the possibility of\nmeaning/content itself. Moreover, if the claim is that the relevant\nnorms or rules are metaphysically prior to meaning/content, they have\nto be of the constitutive kind. \n\nWe have distinguished two ways in which normativism about meaning\ncan be understood: ME normativism and MD normativism. The difference\nbetween the two, again, is that the MD normativist is committed to the\nmetaphysical priority of norms, since the norms are said to determine\nmeaning, while the ME normativist remains neutral on the issue of\nmeaning determination. Both versions of meaning normativism, however,\nclaim that the following is both necessary, and essential to, an\nexpression e’s having meaning (for a speaker, or group\nof speakers, S at a time t): \n(M)   e means M for S at t\nonly if a norm for e is in force for S at\nt.\n  \n\nHistorically, MD normativism is associated with Wittgenstein (in\nparticular the ‘Middle Period’ writings) and the tradition\nof appealing to linguistic conventions, prominent in the 1950’s and\n1960’s (in the writings of Grice, Lewis, Searle and Strawson for\ninstance). A wider notion of the normativity of meaning, ME\nnormativism, appeared on the philosophical scene more recently, and is\nassociated with Saul Kripke’s book on Wittgenstein’s rule-following\nconsiderations (Kripke 1982). In the book Kripke presents us with a\nmeaning skeptic who challenges the very idea that there are facts in\nvirtue of which our terms have a meaning.  Kripke’s skeptic puts down\ncertain constraints on the range of facts that could serve to\ndetermine meaning, among these that the essentially normative\ncharacter of meaning has to be respected. The meaning determining\nfact, Kripke argues, must be such that it follows from it how the term\nought to be applied (ibid: 11). Equipped with this\nnormativity constraint the skeptic goes on to argue against all\ntheories that fail to accommodate the required normative dimension of\nmeaning, in particular dispositionalist theories according to which\nmeaning is determined by the speaker’s dispositions to apply her terms\n(ibid: 22–37). \n\nKripke’s discussion reignited interest in the question of\nmeaning and rules, and resulted in an enormous literature both on the\nskeptical argument and the very idea that meaning is essentially\nnormative. Much of that discussion has been carried out without\nreference to the earlier debate on meaning and conventions, but\nattempts have also been made to relate the two debates. In what follows\nwe shall first discuss ME normativism, where the discussion following\nKripke’s book plays a central role, and then MD normativism. \n\nIt is clear that the type of normativity Kripke has in mind is\nmeaning engendered normativity, or ME normativity; i.e., the claim is\nthat meaning statements such as ‘expression e means\nM for S’ have normative consequences, leaving\nit open whether the norms are prior to meaning or not. Moreover, it is\nclear that the relevant normativity is that of prescriptivity,\nconcerning what S ought to\n do.[9]\nAs noted above, arguments in support of the\nthesis that meaning is essentially normative need to be based on\nsemantic premises – the normativity in question cannot\nderive from external sources. In the case of ME normativity, the\narguments may be more or less direct, depending on more or less\nsubstantial assumptions about meaning. On one end of the spectrum are\narguments that turn on the idea that there are direct conceptual entailments\nfrom meaning statements to normative consequences; on the other end are\narguments that depend on substantial theoretical assumptions about\nmeaning. In the debate, direct arguments have played a prominent role\nsince these fit the idea, implicit in Kripke, that the claim that\nmeaning is normative provides a pre-theoretical constraint on any\nacceptable theory of meaning; one that has to be accepted independently\nof one’s specific semantic theory. However, the normativity\nthesis need not serve as a pre-theoretical constraint – as long\nas the thesis is that meaning is essentially normative it qualifies,\neven if indirect arguments will be more controversial. Let us begin\nwith the most well known direct argument in support of ME normativity,\nwhat we call ‘the simple argument’. \n\nThe classic defense of ME normativity can be found in Paul\nBoghossian (1989a). According to Boghossian the normativity of meaning\nderives from the fact that meaningful expressions have correctness\nconditions. If ‘green’ means green, Boghossian\nargues, it follows immediately that ‘green’ applies\ncorrectly only to green objects, and this, in turn, has immediate\nnormative consequences for how a speaker S should apply ‘green’:\n“The fact that the expression means something implies, that is, a\nwhole set of normative truths about my behavior with that\nexpression: namely, that my use is correct in application to certain\nobjects and not in application to others (513).” (See also\nBlackburn 1984: 281, Miller 1998:198, Whiting 2007 and 2009.) The strategy,\ntherefore, is to move from (CM), to a normative conclusion,\n(ME1): (CM)   For any speaker S, and any time t: if\n‘green’ means green for S at t,\nthen it is correct for S to apply ‘green’ to an\nobject x iff\nx is green at t. \n(ME1)   For any speaker S, and any time t:\nif ‘green’ means green for S\nat t, then S ought to apply ‘green’ to\nan object x iff\nx is green at t. \n\n(CM) can hardly be challenged: Meaningful expressions have semantic\ncorrectness conditions. Of course, there is some controversy as to how\nthese correctness conditions are to be construed, whether the basic\nnotion of semantic correctness is that of truth or warranted\nassertability, for instance. However, it cannot be questioned that some\nnotion of semantic correctness is required. This, indeed, seems to be\npart of the very concept of meaning. If, therefore, the notion of\nsemantic correctness is an essentially normative notion, we would have\na very direct argument in support of ME normativity, based simply on\nconceptual entailments. Before discussing the argument, let us make\nsome preliminarily remarks concerning (ME1). \n\nFirst, what is it to apply an expression? It should be clear that\nthe relevant notion of application is that of predication. For\ninstance, we apply a predicate such as ‘green’ when we use\nit in an assertion, to predicate a property of an object x. In\nthe case of singular terms, similarly, what is of relevance is\nreferential\n use.[10]\nThe notion of application, hence, is more narrow than that of\nuse, since we use our terms in a wide variety of ways that do\nnot include the expression of judgments, as when we ask a question or\nmake a hypothetical statement (see Millar 2004: 162). \n\nSecond, how should the deontic operator in (ME1) be\nconstrued? Since (ME1) involves an embedded conditional, we\nmay in fact distinguish between three readings, a narrow scope\nreading, an intermediate and a wide scope reading: \n(ME1′)    If ‘green’ means green\nfor S at t, then (S ought to (apply\n‘green’ to x) iff\nx is green). \n(ME1″)    If ‘green’ means green\nfor S at t, then (S ought to (apply\n‘green’ to x iff\nx is green)). \n(ME1′′′)    S ought to (if\n‘green’ means green for S at t,\napply ‘green’ to x iff x is green). \n\nIn the debate, all three construals can be found. Thus, it has been\nsuggested that the intermediate scope interpretation best captures the\nintuition that if S means green by\n‘green’ she is thereby obligated to use the term in certain\nways (under certain conditions), without (as on the narrow scope\nreading) implying that the obligation is conditional on x\nbeing green (Hattiangadi 2006: 225, fn 4). Another issue concerns the\npossibility of detaching. Some favor the narrow scope reading, since it\nallows one to detach the ‘ought’, and supports the\nintuition that the semantic obligation can only be discharged one way:\nin this case, by applying ‘green’ to green objects (Bykvist\n& Hattiangadi 2007: 283). Others prefer the wide scope reading,\nprecisely because it does not allow one to detach ‘ought’\nand hence implies a more disjunctive obligation: S ought\neither to apply ‘green’ to green objects, or not mean\ngreen by ‘green’ (Gampel 1995: 228, Millar 2004:\n168–169). \n\nA related question is whether (ME1) clashes with the widely\nendorsed principle that ought implies can. As it\nstands, (ME1) can be read as implying that S has\nan obligation to apply ‘green’ to all green objects, an\nobligation that cannot possibly be fulfilled (Hattiangadi\n2007: 180). One response to this is to endorse the wide scope reading,\n(ME1′′′), since it allows the subject to\ndischarge her obligation by not meaning green by\n‘green’ – something that does seem to be in her\npower. Another response consists in removing the biconditional in\n(ME1), replacing it with a weaker principle (Whiting 2007:\n137): \n(ME2)   For any speaker S, and any time t:\nif ‘green’ means green for S\nat t, then S ought to apply ‘green’ to\nan object x only if\nx is green at t.\n \n\nThe question has been raised, however, whether (ME2) is\nsufficiently strong to support ME normativity. The trouble is that\n(ME2) does not seem to place any normative constraints on\nthe subject’s behavior. If x is green, it no longer\nfollows that S ought to apply ‘green’ to\nx, whereas if x is not green it just follows that it\nis not the case that S ought to apply ‘green’ to\nx. The latter, it has been stressed, is distinct from the\nclaim that S ought not to apply ‘green’ to\nx – for instance, it is compatible with it being\npermissible to apply ‘green’ to x (Bykvist &\nHattiangadi 2007: 280). This means that (ME2) fails to\nsupport the claim that when S applies a term in a way that is\nsemantically incorrect, then she has done what she ought not do:\n‘semantically incorrect’ and ‘ought not’ thus\ncome apart.    \n\nIn response it has been suggested that ‘ought’ in (ME1) is\nreplaced by a ‘may’. This allows the normativist to retain\nthe biconditional and yet avoid the troubles caused by the principle\nthat ought implies can: That an action is correct\nimplies only that one may do it, not that one is\nobligated to do it, and there is no principle that\nought implies can. If ‘green’ is true of\ngreen objects only then S may apply ‘green’ to an\nobject if and only if it is green, and this is not in conflict with\nthe fact that the subject is not able to apply ‘green’ to\nevery green object there is (Whiting 2009: 544 and 2010: 216, Peregrin\n2012: 88).  There is therefore some initial unclarity as to precisely which\nprescription is supposed to follow directly from (CM). A more\nfundamental question is whether the strategy of the simple argument\ncan succeed in the first place. Opponents of ME normativity do not\nchallenge (CM) which, again, seems trivially true.  Rather, they deny\nthat (CM) has normative consequences just by itself. The crucial claim\nhere is that ‘correct’ can be used both normatively and\nnon-normatively (cf. Glüer 2001, Glüer & Wikforss 2009,\n36 and 2015a). If that is true, the simple argument won’t go through:\nRather, an additional premise will be required to the effect that\n‘correct’ in (CM) is used normatively. And whether or not\nthat premise can be supplied, the argument won’t be direct\nanymore. \n\nAnti-normativists usually go further and claim that the way\n‘correct’ is used in (CM) in fact is non-normative. What\nthe appeal to correctness conditions gives us, it is claimed, is only\na way of categorizing applications of ‘green’ into two\nbasic kinds (the true and the false, for instance), and this does not\nin itself entail that one ought to apply the term in any particular\nway. The notion of semantic correctness is non-normative in just this\nsense: That an application of e is correct, does not entail\nthat it ought to be made, and, conversely, incorrect applications do\nnot immediately imply that S has violated any semantic\nprescription. If ‘green’ means green then\nS applying it to a red object implies that her statement is\nfalse, but it does not thereby follow that she has failed to do what\nshe ought, semantically, to do (Fodor 1990, Horwich 1995, Glüer\n1999, 2001, Wikforss 2001, Dretske 2000, Hattiangadi 2006;\n2009a).[11] ,[12] \n\nProponents of the direct argument respond by insisting that the notion\nof semantic correctness is a normative notion. To many, this seems a\nsimple conceptual truth holding for the notion of correctness in\ngeneral, and therefore also for that of semantic correctness (Gibbard\n2005: 358, Whiting 2007: 135 and 2009: 538). Normativists also appeal\nto ordinary usage here, suggesting that ‘correct’ is\nnormally used normatively and should therefore be interpreted that way\nin semantics as well (Whiting 2009: 538, Peregrin 2012: 84). That\nhasn’t convinced anti-normativists who point out that\ndictionaries such as Merriam-Webster’s commonly list normative and\nnon-normative usages for the adjective ‘correct’ (Glüer\n&\n Wikforss 2015a).[13]  Normativists have also argued that even if the basic semantic\nconcept itself wasn’t normative, the notion of semantic\ncorrectness still would or could be. Semantic correctness, it is\nargued, is not simply the same as, for instance, truth. Normativists\nhere appeal to a distinction stressed by Rosen (2001: 620) between\ncorrectness and the ‘correctness making feature’, the\n(non-normative) property something must have in order to count as\ncorrect. According to Rosen, correctness is a higher-order\nproperty. To say that something is correct is not just to say that the\ncorrectness making features are in place (as when someone plays the\nnotes of the Moonlight Sonata) but to make the higher-order claim that\nthe action (the piano performance) possesses the feature that makes\nfor correctness in acts of that kind (the act of playing the Moonlight\nSonata).  Similarly, it is argued, to say that applying\n‘green’ to a green object is correct, is to say that the\napplication has a certain non-normative property (the expression\napplies truly) but it is also to make the higher-order statement that\nthe application possesses the feature that makes it correct in a\nnormative sense.  Even if the basic word-world relation is\nnon-normative, therefore, it does not follow that the property of\ncorrectness does not have a normative dimension (Speaks 2009: 408,\nWhiting 2009: 540, Fennell 2013: 58–59). It is difficult to see,\nhowever, how something like ‘the correctness making\nfeature’ could strictly speaking be a second-order property\n(i.e. a property of a property). It is one and the same object that\nboth has the correctness making feature and is correct, after\nall. Rather, Rosen-style correctness is a first-order, second-level\nproperty (to use the terminology of Russell’s ramified theory of\ntypes). More importantly, even if that is the best way to construe the\nintuitive general notion of correctness, all this means is that it\nmight be possible to provide arguments for the claim that the notion\nof semantic correctness is normative even if we agree that the basic\nsemantic concept itself is not normative. But the basic\nanti-normativist challenge applies to Rosen-style correctness just as\nto any other construal of the intuitive, general notion of\ncorrectness: Since ‘correct’ can be used normatively and\nnon-normatively, there is no simple, direct implication from\ncorrectness to normativity (cf. Glüer & Wikforss 2009, 37, fn. 10;\n2015). \n\nThis strand in the debate might seem to suggest that behind the\ndiscussion of the simple argument lies nothing but a basic clash of\nintuitions. The anti-normativist denies what the normativist asserts\n– that the concept of semantic correctness is an essentially\nnormative concept. A possible conclusion, therefore, is that the\nnormativist and the anti-normativist operate with different concepts\nof semantic correctness. This raises the question, however, whether\nthere is nevertheless co-extensionality between the two concepts. As\nlong as (CM) is the common starting point this would seem to be the\ncase; any sorting effected by the normative distinction between\ncorrectness and incorrectness will coincide with the sorting effected\nby the non-normative distinction. If so, it would seem that further\narguments are required to resolve the dispute, beyond the appeal to\nintuitions: The normativist would have to provide some reasons why the\nnon-normativist notion of correctness is not a notion of semantic\ncorrectness.  This poses a special challenge to normativists who\nappeal to Rosen’s distinction and grant that the basic semantic\nrelation is non-normative: If this relation is non-normative then the\nquestion is not whether the concept of semantic correctness\ncould be given a normative construal but whether semantics\nneeds such a construal (Glüer & Wikforss 2015a). \n\nAnother strand in the discussion of the simple argument concerns the\nstatus of the relevant semantic obligations. Here it is often\nemphasized that semantic obligations are merely prima facie and may be\noverridden by other obligations, such as the obligation (in a certain\ncontext) to tell a lie. It is therefore not an objection to ME\nnormativity that there are situations in which ‘green’ means\ngreen for S, without it being the case that\nS ought to apply ‘green’ to green objects only\n(Whiting 2007: 139 and 2009: 546).  \n\nThis appeal to prima facie obligations has been challenged. What is\ndistinctive of a prima facie obligation, as opposed to a mere\ninstrumental means-end imperative, is that it cannot be overridden by\nmere desires. However, it is argued, if S has no desire to\nspeak the truth, then S has no obligation to apply\n‘green’ to green objects. For instance, if neither\nS, nor her audience, care whether S tells the truth,\nthen there is no obligation to apply ‘green’ correctly.\nHence, (CM) does not even yield prima facie obligations (Hattiangadi\n2006: 232 and 2007:189). In response, the normativists suggest that in\nsuch a situation the speaker’s use would nevertheless be\nsemantically incorrect and involve a violation of her semantic\nobligations. The violation would not be very serious, but it would\nstill be a violation (Whiting 2007: 139). This has been challenged,\ntoo. Verheggen, for instance, argues that Whiting’s attempt to back\nthis up by the possibility of criticising a speaker who misapplies an\nexpression out of mere desire is not convincing. After all, the\nspeaker acts as she does precisely because of what she means by the\nexpression – therefore, there is no semantic reason to criticize\nher (Verheggen 2011, 562). \n\nNevertheless, it would be hasty to conclude that nothing but\ninstrumental norms can be derived from meaning facts in conjunction\nwith desires. As noted above, it is clear that an appeal to merely\ninstrumental norms, or means-ends norms, fails to support the idea\nthat meaning is essentially normative. Although facts about\ncorrectness conditions may play a role in the generation of\ninstrumental norms such as “If you wish to communicate with ease\nyou ought to apply ‘green’ to x if and only if\nx is green”, the ought in question derives from the\nagent’s desires and intentions (given certain empirical facts,\nregularities, or laws), not from the correctness conditions\nthemselves. Indeed, very many facts can play a role in the generation\nof instrumental norms without thereby being intrinsically normative\n– for instance, given the laws of nature, facts about the\nweather, taken together with facts about my desires, have implications\nfor how I should dress (Coates 1986, Bilgrami 1993, Glüer 2001,\nWikforss 2001, Hattiangadi 2006, 2009b). Not all hypothetical\nnorms are instrumental, or based on contingent means-ends relations,\nhowever. An example would be the following: If you want to castle in\nchess, you should (or indeed: must) move your king and one of your\nrooks in a certain way. Similarly, it has been suggested that there is\nan important difference between hypothetical norms involving ordinary\nnon-normative facts (such as facts about the weather) and norms\ninvolving meaning facts: Since meaning facts are constituted\nby correctness conditions, meaning facts always dictate how I\nshould behave when I intend to produce a meaningful utterance. Even\nthough what they dictate depends on my particular desires in\nthe situation, the fact that they dictate something does not\ndepend on any desire – in contrast to the dictates derivable\nfrom weather facts (Verheggen 2011: 563). One might wonder, though,\nwhether the cases ultimately really are disanalogous: Just as one\nmight not care whether one gets wet or stays dry, it might seem, one\nmight just not care whether what one says is semantically correct or\nnot – do correctness conditions really dictate anything if all I\nwant to do is say something\n meaningful?[14] \n\nBefore considering alternative arguments in support of ME normativity,\nlet us comment on the relation between Kripke’s normativity\nconstraint and the so called ‘problem of error’. As noted\nabove, Kripke takes his normativity constraint to rule out\ndispositionalist accounts of meaning. Kripke formulates his objection\nto dispositionalism in various ways: Dispositions only concern what\nthe agent will do, not what she should do (1982: 29;\n37); the dispositionalist cannot account for mistakes\n(ibid. 30–35); dispositionalist facts are not guiding\nand cannot justify the agent’s actions (ibid. 37). In\nthe debate, the main focus has been on the question whether the\ndispositionalist can account for the possibility of mistake or\nerror. For an expression meaning green, for instance, it is\njust as much a platitude that mistaken or erroneous application is (in\nprinciple) possible as that the expression has correctness\nconditions. Indeed, for such an expression the possibility of error or\nmistake is little more than a reflection of (CM): There must be a\ndistinction between correct and incorrect applications. The question,\nthen, is the following: If meaning is determined by how S is\ndisposed to use her term, then how could she use the term incorrectly?\nIt has been argued that she couldn’t – rather, every apparent\nerror would just indicate a difference in meaning. Hence, the\ndispositionalist would be in danger of undermining the distinction\nbetween what seems right to the speaker (in the sense of being\ndisposed to apply a particular expression) and what is right\n(Boghossian 1989a:\n 537–540).[15]  It is much disputed whether the dispositionalist can solve this\nproblem. It should be noted, however, that the problem of error does\nnot seem to have much to do with semantic normativity (Fodor 1990:\n135–136, Bilgrami 1992, Wikforss 2001: 208, Hattiangadi 2006:\n229, 2007: 186). The error objection does not turn on the fact that\nthe dispositionalist cannot allow for semantic oughts but, rather, on\nthe fact that we must not construe the relation between the meaning\ndetermining facts and meaning in such a way that mistake is ruled\nout.  \n\nOf course, even provided with a solution to the problem of error\ndispositionalism might come to grief with Kripke’s skeptic. Solving\nthe problem of error requires showing that there is a plausible\nprinciple P assigning meanings to expressions on the basis of\nthe speaker’s dispositions to use them, a principle underwriting\nplausible ascriptions of error. On a quite plausible interpretation of\nthe skeptic’s main strategy – i.e. that of\n“quussing” candidate facts – this strategy is as\napplicable here as elsewhere. If, for instance, P assigns\naddition to ‘plus‘ on the basis of disposition\nD, the skeptic will want to know why this is the right\nprinciple – as opposed to some other principle P’\nassigning quaddition to ‘plus’ on the basis of\nD. As the mere fact of the speaker’s having D does\nnothing to determine which of these principles is the right one,\ndispositional facts are as quussable as any of the other candidates\n– and this remains the case even if your dispositionalism comes\nwith a plausible principle of meaning determination (cf. Pagin 2002,\n160f). \n\nBut pointing to the possibility of quussing is not the same thing as\nraising a normativity objection. Raising a normativity objection to\ndispositionalism requires additional considerations. Ginsborg (2011a,\nb) and (2012) suggests some such additional considerations. Ginsborg\nargues that dispositionalism can be defended against both\nKripke’s error and finitude objections and, further, that\ndispositional facts cannot be quussed. According to her interpretation\nof Kripke, the quus-hypothesis undermines those, and only those,\ncandidates for the role of meaning determining fact that aspire to\nguide, instruct, or justify a\nspeaker’s use of their terms. Since dispositionalism has no such\naspirations, it is not vulnerable to quussing (2011b, 155; for\ncriticism, see Haddock 2012, Verheggen 2015). Nevertheless, Ginsborg\nmaintains, dispositionalism cannot be the full story; taken just by\nitself, it ultimately does fall prey to a normativity objection.  \n\nTo make this plausible, Ginsborg argues that there is a version of the\nnormativity objection that is more fundamental than those investigated\nin the debate so far. In this version, the relevant norms are\nnot supposed to provide guidance, justification, or reasons\nfor using expressions one way or another – according to her, it\nis precisely these requirements that generate vulnerability to\nquussing. Rather, sensitivity to the relevant norms is needed to\nsecure understanding. The pure dispositionalist, Ginsborg\nargues, cannot distinguish the intelligent use of language from mere\nparroting or other automatic behaviour. Intuitively, the parrot, or\nthe automaton, do not use expressions with\nunderstanding. Using an expression with understanding\nrequires grasping its meaning, and this involves not only being\ndisposed to use it in a certain way, but also being disposed to\n‘take it’ that the expression ought to be used\nthe way one is disposed to use it. The attitude required is one of\n“primitive appropriateness” – such\nappropriateness cannot be explicated in terms of truth (Ginsborg 2012,\n132), and taking something to be appropriate in this sense does not\nrequire any prior grasp of rules, concepts, or meaning\n(ibid. 137f). Primitive normativity thus is one of the central notions\nin Ginsborg’s partially reductive account of meaning\ndetermination, according to which “expressions have meaning only\nin virtue of there being ways in which they [primitively] ought to be\napplied” (ibid. 132). This is a (new) form of MD-normativism,\nand we shall return to it below (in section 2.2, esp. 2.2.1 and\n2.2.4). \n\nNext, let us consider alternative arguments in support of ME\nnormativity. \n\nAn alternative to the simple argument is to suggest that there is a\nfurther notion of semantic correctness, one that is not co-extensional\nwith that of (CM) but that is both essential to meaning and normative.\nThus, it has been claimed that there is a crucial ambiguity in the\nnotion of correct use (Millar 2004: 160). On the one hand, there is\nthe notion of semantic correctness as in (CM); on the other hand there\nis the notion of correct use as in ‘using an expression in\naccordance with its meaning’. That the two do not coincide is\nclear from the fact that one may use an expression in accordance with\nits meaning, and yet make a false statement, as when one has a false\nbelief about the world (McGinn 1984, Millar 2002, 2004: 160–175;\nMoore 1954/1955: 308; Sellars 1956: 166, Buleandra 2008: 180, Fennell\n2013: 69). We must distinguish empirical mistakes from\nlinguistic mistakes, it is argued, and it is essential that\nwe are able to allow for both. Moreover, it is said, this further\nnotion of semantic correctness is an essentially normative notion, one\nthat has implications for what S ought to do or is obligated\nto do: if ‘green’ means green for S,\nthen S ought to use ‘green’ in accordance with\nits meaning. (This idea, too, goes back to Kripke who, at points,\nspeaks of what I should do, if my use of the term is to be “in\naccordance with how it was meant” (1982: 30, 37).) \n\nHow is the notion of ‘using an expression in accordance with\nits meaning’ to be construed? According to one proposal, it\nconcerns which expressions are ‘appropriate’ or\n‘suitable’ for expressing a certain belief. The notion of\n‘suitability’, in turn, is derived from the ordinary\nsemantic correctness conditions taken together with what I intend to\nexpress by my expressions: If ‘green’ applies correctly\nonly to green objects, and I mean to express my belief that x\nis green, then I ought to use the term ‘green’ and not,\nsay, ‘red’. This allows for the possibility that my use is\ncorrect in the sense of (CM), and yet linguistically incorrect (if\nx is red and I use the term ‘red’ to express my\nbelief that x is green); and, vice versa, that my use is\nincorrect in the sense of (CM), but linguistically correct (if\nx is red and I use the term ‘green’ to express my\nbelief that x is green) (McGinn 1984: 60, Millar 2004:\n162–163). Hence, in the place of (CM) we have: \n(CM*)   For any speaker S, and any time t: if\n‘green’ means green for\nS at t, then it is correct for S at\nt to apply ‘green’ to an object x iff\nS intends to express the belief that x is green at\n t.[16] \n\nPossible misuses are said to include both performance errors (such\nas slips of the tongue) and so-called meaning errors (as when the\nspeaker thinks ‘arcane’ means ancient) (Millar\n2004: 163). \n\nThis raises the question of what motivates this further notion of\ncorrectness. While it is a platitude that meaningful expressions have\nsemantic correctness conditions, it is not a platitude that an\nexpression is meaningful only if there are these further correctness\nconditions, and this leaves it open to opponents of ME normativity to\nquestion the semantic relevance of (CM*). If ‘green’ means\ngreen for S, and S uses ‘red’\nto express her belief that x is green, she may fail in her\ncommunicative intentions (although not necessarily, consider the use\nof irony and metaphor), but does it follow that she has used her\nexpressions incorrectly in a semantically relevant sense? The added\nnotion of correctness, it may therefore be argued, simply does no\nsemantic work. In this respect there appears to be an important\ndifference between the notion of semantic correctness in (CM) and that\nof (CM*): While it is essential that we allow for the possibility of\nusing an expression incorrectly in the sense of (CM), making room for\nempirical error, it may not seem as important that we allow for the\npossibility of using an expression incorrectly in the sense of (CM*),\nmaking room for linguistic error. This concern has been raised by some\nnormativists as well. For instance, Whiting (2013) argues that it is a\nmistake to try to defend normativism on these grounds, and that the\nnormativist should stick to the orthodox interpretation that takes as\nits starting point (CM). \n\nIn the literature, the most common route to the conclusion that we\nneed some such further notion of semantic correctness goes via\nassumptions about the nature of understanding (Wright 1980:\n20, McDowell 1984, McGinn 1984:109, Kotatko 1998, Millar 2004,\nBuleandra 2008, Fennell 2012). Understanding the meaning of a term, it\nis argued, involves using it in accordance with its meaning and,\nmoreover, feeling obligated to thus using it. To learn the meaning of\nan expression, McDowell writes for instance, “is to acquire an\nunderstanding that obliges us subsequently … to judge and speak\nin certain determinate ways, on pain of failure to obey the dictates\nof the meaning we have grasped” (1984: 45). This motivates the\nappeal to further correctness conditions, it is held, since a speaker\nmay fully understand a term while using it in a false judgment and,\nconversely, use the term in a true judgment while failing to\nunderstand the term properly. \n\nThe idea that understanding puts constraints on use is often combined\nwith the claim that there are rationality constraints on meaning\nattributions. Thus, it has been suggested that the normativity of\nmeaning flows from the idea that when interpreting another speaker,\nthe interpretation is constrained by the principle that the other\nshould come out as being by and large rational and not wildly\nmistaken.  Using an expression in accordance with its meaning, is\nusing the expression in a way that ‘makes sense’, and does\nnot violate these rationality constraints. The normativity of meaning,\non this view, simply follows from something like the Davidsonian idea\nthat meaning and intentional content are determined by the principle\nof charity (McDowell & Pettit 1986, 11; Millar 2004; Zangwill\n1998; Kriegel 2010). According to the principle of charity, the best\ninterpretation of a speaker S is that which optimizes overall\ncoherence and truth across S’s utterances and beliefs, but also\ntheir desires and actions (e.g., Davidson 1991, 211; for more on the\nprinciple of charity, see Glüer 2011, ch. 3). \n\nThe route via understanding depends on assumptions about the nature\nof linguistic understanding that may be challenged. For instance, even\nif it is granted that understanding the meaning of an expression\ne involves using e in certain ways (something which\nmay also be questioned, see Williamson 2007), it is a further\nsupposition that this brings with it an additional notion of semantic\ncorrectness/incorrectness. It might simply be said that unless one uses\n‘green’ in certain ways one does not mean green by\n‘green’. That is, if one does not use the expression in\naccordance with the meaning green, then it does not follow\nthat one uses one’s expression incorrectly, but merely that one\nuses it with a different meaning. This ties understanding to use\nwithout appealing to the notions of correct and incorrect use. Thus,\nthe speaker who (regularly) uses ‘arcane’ in accordance with\nthe standard meaning of ‘ancient’, means ancient\nand not arcane by her expression (Davidson 1986). In fact, it\nhas been suggested that the appeal to rationality constraints mandates\nthis: It is precisely because the standard interpretation would imply\nattributing unacceptable error and irrationality that the term needs to\nbe reinterpreted (for a discussion of the principle of charity see\nsection 2.2). \n\nA related argument appeals not to the nature of understanding, but\nto the nature of intentions (Wright 1984, 1987, McDowell\n1991). Kripke, at one point, stresses that the relation of meaning and\nintention to future action is normative, not descriptive (1982: 37).\nWhat he seems to have in mind is the idea that there is an\ninternal relation between an intention and what fulfills it:\nif S intends to do A, only doing A will\nfulfil her intention (ibid: 25). Similarly, it is suggested, if\nS intends ‘green’ to mean green, then\nS has to do certain things in order for her intention to be\nfulfilled. Obviously, it cannot be that what she has to do is apply the\nterm correctly in the sense of (CM). That would have the disastrous\nconsequence that if she applies ‘green’ to a non-green\nobject, it immediately follows that S does not mean\ngreen by ‘green’, and hence all possibility of\nempirical error is ruled out. Rather, what S has to do to\nfulfil her intention is to use ‘green’ in accordance with\nits meaning. \n\nIt has been argued that this move fails to strengthen the\nnormativist case. If, indeed, the intention to mean green by\n‘green’ is fulfilled only if S uses\n‘green’ in accordance with its meaning, then there can be\nno such thing as meaning green by ‘green’ while\nnot using the expression in accordance with its meaning. It follows\nthat failing to use an expression in accordance with its meaning is not\nusing the expression linguistically incorrectly, but using it with a\ndifferent meaning. Thus it is argued that the claim that there is an\ninternal relation between an intention and its fulfilment, far from\nsupporting ME normativity, is in tension with it (Glüer &\nWikforss 2009: 48–51). It should be noted that this objection is\npremised on the principle, mentioned above, that ought implies\nthe possibility of violation: If the relation between intention and\nfuture action is internal there is no possibility of violation, the\nreasoning goes, hence the relation cannot be both internal and\nprescriptive. (The principle is stressed by Mulligan 1999, Railton\n1999, 3f; Williamson 2000, 241; Glüer 2001; Glüer &\nWikforss 2009.) \n\nQuestions can also be raised concerning the normative consequences\nof the notion of ‘using a word in accordance with its\nmeaning’. Assuming that this further notion of correctness is\nessential to meaning and that we need to be able to allow for meaning\nerrors, does it follow that speakers ought to use their terms\ncorrectly, in this sense? Do we have a semantic obligation to use our\nexpressions in accordance with their meaning? As in the case of the\nsimple argument, it might be argued that the appearance of an\nought here derives from added normative premises, such as\ninstrumental norms concerning the ease of communication, or pragmatic\nnorms regulating speech acts. \n\nIn response it has been suggested that the relevant normative\nconsequences should not be understood in terms of obligations but,\nrather, in terms of commitments. This is the line taken by Alan Millar\n(2002 and 2004). Meaning statements, such as “‘Green’\nmeans green”, Millar argues, are true in virtue of there\nbeing a rule-governed practice. If S uses ‘green’\nto mean green, therefore, she becomes a participant in this practice\nand incurs a commitment to use the term accordingly. To be properly\ncommitted, Millar suggests, S has to be disposed to adjust her\nuse if she discovers that it is not in keeping with the meaning of the\nexpression (as when S uses ‘arcane’ to mean\nancient). The commitment is not dependent on one’s\ndesire to communicate, or on the intention to speak the truth, but\nmerely on S participating in the practice of using\n‘green’ with a certain meaning. However, Millar stresses,\nit does not follow that she ought to use her expressions a certain way,\nsince it does not follow that she ought to participate in the practice\n– there may be reasons to withdraw from the practice instead.\nHence, one may participate in a practice without it following that one\nought to “carry out the performances associated with one’s\nrole” (Millar 2004:\n 173).[17] \n\nThis proposal illustrates how ME normativity might be derived from\nMD normativity: Meaning statements have normative consequences,\naccording to Millar, because meaning is determined by the speaker\nfollowing certain rules. Metaphysically the rules come first and make\nmeaning possible. Before turning to a discussion of MD normativity, let\nus briefly consider some other arguments put forth in support of ME\nnormativity. \n\nThe arguments above are all attempts to show that meaning statements\nhave normative implications. An alternative strategy is to suggest\nthat meaning statements simply are prescriptions. When we\nstate “‘Green’ means green” we may\nappear to be making a descriptive statement whereas, in fact, we are\nprescribing how ‘green’ ought to be used (Gauker\n2007, 2011, Lance & O’Leary Hawthorne 1997, Peregrin 2012: 96,\nGibbard 2012). This proposal can either be construed as a claim about\nthe semantic content of meaning statements, or as a claim\nabout the typical use of meaning statements. Thus, a\nstatement may be used prescriptively, while having a descriptive,\nfactual content (‘In this classroom we raise our hands before\nspeaking’). \n\nIf the suggestion is that meaning statements have a prescriptive\ncontent it would provide another very direct argument in support of ME\nnormativity, one that does not have to proceed via the controversial\nclaim that the notion of semantic correctness is an essentially\nnormative notion. This is an advantage over the simple argument.\nHowever, there are also disadvantages. For instance, the question\narises whether the claim that meaning statements lack descriptive\ncontent can accommodate the role of such statements in inferential\ncontexts. (See Gauker 2007: 194–195 for a discussion.) Another\nquestion concerns the implications from ‘ought’-statements\nto meaning statements. According to the simple argument,\n“‘Green’ ought to be applied to x if and\nonly if x is green” follows immediately from\n“‘Green’ means green”. According to\nthis argument the converse also holds: “‘Green’\nmeans green” follows directly from\n“‘Green’ ought to be applied to x if and\nonly if x is green” (c.f. Gibbard 2012: 12 and\n113–115). The latter has been questioned on the grounds that even if\nit is true that ‘green’ ought to be applied this way, the\n‘ought’ in question may not have anything to do with\nsemantics but, say, with religious practices (Byrne 2002: 207). \n\nThese difficulties are avoided if, instead, meaning statements are\nsimply construed as having a prescriptive use (while having a\ndescriptive content). On either construal, however, the question\narises why we should believe that meaning statements are\nprescriptive. One suggestion is that the prescriptive function of\nmeaning statements follows from their role in coordinating our\nlinguistic use (Gauker 2007 and 2012: 279). Meaning statements are\nproposals about how terms ought to be used, and as such they\nserve to determine meaning and remove an otherwise irresolvable\nindeterminacy (see also Gibbard 2012: 109–112. As a result, “we\nall think of meanings as standards that we are obliged to conform\nto” (2007: 185). This defense of the normativity thesis\ntherefore turns on controversial issues concerning\nindeterminacy. Another proposal shuns the metaphysical questions\nconcerning the nature of meaning and appeals to the function\nof meaning statements in our practices (Lance & O’Leary Hawthorne\n1997). Instead of asking for the facts that constitute meaning, it is\nargued, we should consider the role of meaning statements in our\nsocio-linguistic practices. It then emerges that such statements serve\nthe regulative function of licensing and censoring certain uses. It\nshould be noted that unless this proposal about the function of\nmeaning statements is said to have some metaphysical\nimplications concerning the nature of meaning, it will fall short of\nsupporting the claim that meaning is essentially\n normative.[18] ,[19] \n\nIn addition, there are a variety of other arguments in support of ME\nnormativity. One such argument grants that correctness conditions are\nnot themselves normative, but suggests that we derive the normativity\nof meaning from the idea that we ought to speak the truth (Ebbs 1997,\nHaugeland 1998, Soames 1997: 221, 224). As noted above, this only\nsucceeds if the obligation in question can be said to derive purely\nfrom semantic sources. The question, then, is whether there is any\nreason to suppose that we have a semantic obligation to speak the\ntruth. The impression that there is, it has been suggested, is a\nresult of a conflation of semantics and pragmatics. Thus, it is\ncommonly held that there are rules of assertion, and some of these are\nsuch that they are violated when the speaker makes a false\njudgment. For instance, it has been proposed that there is a\n‘knowledge rule’: “One must: assert p only\nif one knows p” (Williamson 2000: 242).  However,\nopponents of ME normativity stress, these are pragmatic rules,\nregulating the performance of speech acts, not semantic ones. If such\nrules are essential for the possibility of assertion, then assertion\nis essentially normative, but it does not follow that meaning is\n(Glüer & Wikforss 2009a: 37–38, Speaks 2009). For\ndiscussion of the claim that assertion is normative, see\nthe entry on assertion. \n\nAnother set of arguments reject the focus\non correctness conditions and appeal to other aspects of Kripke’s\nnormativity objection to dispositionalist theories. For instance, it\nhas been suggested that the claim that meaning is essentially normative\nis primarily a claim about the justificatory role of meaning. Facts\nabout meaning are, essentially, such that they are able to justify\nS‘s use of her terms, able to guide S‘s\nusage. In this sense, meaning facts are like prescriptive rules, such\nas the rules of etiquette – it is of their essence that they\nguide action or give directions. The reason dispositionalism fails,\nthen, is not that the dispositionalist cannot account for error, but\nthat facts about what I am disposed to do are not essentially capable\nof justifying (Gampel 1995: 225–231, Zalabardo 1997: 480–483, Kusch\n2006: 50–94). \n\nWhether this argument succeeds depends on whether it can be shown\nthat the role of meaning in motivating action is equivalent to that of\nprescriptions. Thus, the fact that ‘green’ means\ngreen may of course guide the speaker’s actions in the\nsense that any facts do so – i.e., if S believes that\n‘green’ means green. To show that meaning facts\nplay a normatively guiding role, therefore, it does not suffice to\nappeal to the idea that meaning facts play a role in motivating action;\nit also has to be shown that the motivating role is that of a\nprescription rather than a belief (see section 2.2 below). \n\nThis raises the general question of the extent to which Kripekan\nnormativity considerations can be isolated from the larger context\nwithin which they occur, i.e., the skeptical argument. It has been\nsuggested that the focus on semantic correctness deflates\nKripke’s arguments, leaving out his claims about justification\nand guidance, for instance (Kusch 2006: 62–64). Even if the skeptical\nconclusion can be avoided, it is held, the upshot of Kripke’s\ndiscussion is that traditional conceptions of meaning have to be\nrejected: Since there are no facts that serve to determine realist\ncorrectness conditions, we need to replace the realist construal of\nsemantic correctness conditions as being judgment independent, with an\nanti-realist account of correctness conditions in terms of\njustification conditions. The normative dimension of meaning,\nultimately, is to be found in the communal practice of relying on\nothers and standing corrected (Wright 1980: 20, Hale 1997, Kusch\n2006:\n 177–206).[20] \n\nHowever, arguments have also been made in the reverse direction,\nsuggesting that the dialectic in fact is quite different. Since\nproponents of the revisionary approach rely on the idea that meaning is\nnormative, it has been suggested, their arguments do not touch the\nphilosopher who denies that meaning is normative and rejects the move\nfrom correctness conditions to prescriptions. That is, if the\nnormativity constraint need not be met, and if it suffices that we\nappeal to facts that serve to determine semantic (realist) correctness\nconditions, the skeptical challenge may appear less formidable and, as\na result, the revisionary response less motivated (Hattiangadi\n2007: 207). \n\nIn the discussion of ME normativity so far it is assumed that the\nrelevant norms are norms for action, prescriptions for the\nspeaker’s use of her expressions. This, again, is how Kripke\ndiscusses the topic and how those writing on Kripke tend to construe\nthe relevant normativity. However, as far as ME normativity goes,\nnormative consequences might also be construed axiologically. Thus, it\nmight be argued that semantically correct applications, by themselves,\nare valuable. This, too, would show that meaning is an\nessentially normative notion, although in a different sense than the\nstandard one. And in this case too, the crucial question would be\nwhether the step from (CM) to normative consequences can be motivated.\nDoes sorting S’s applications into the semantically\ncorrect and the semantically incorrect ones, by itself imply that\nactions of one or the other of these kinds are valuable (Glüer\n2001:\n 60–61)?[21] \n\nAnother option would be to construe the rules or norms of meaning as\nconstitutive ones (cf. section 1.2 above). Rules of meaning, the idea\nwould be, are rules for the use of expressions that determine the\nmeaning of these expressions. Appealing to constitutive rules thus\nwould mean accepting what we call MD normativism: It would mean\naccepting that expressions have meaning because there are rules or\nnorms in force for their use. \n\nMeaning determining normativism (MD normativism) is the claim that\nmeaning is essentially such that it is (at least in part) determined\nby\n norms.[22]\nPrima\nfacie, this can either mean that the supervenience base for meaning,\nthe set of facts metaphysically determining meaning (see section 1.1\nabove) contains norms, or, more precisely, normative facts (cf.\nWedgwood 2007, Part II; 2009), or that the principle governing meaning\ndetermination is a “normative principle” (Jackman\n2004, Other Internet \n Resources).[23]\n In the end, this might not be a substantive difference, however. A\nnatural idea would be that a normative determination principle\ninvolves a mapping essentially mediated by norms, or normative\nfacts. But then, placing the relevant normative facts in the\nsupervenience base (and using one principle of determination), or\nconstruing them as part of another principle of determination (working\non a supervenience base not containing any normative facts) might\namount to no more than notational\n variation.[24] \n\nThe single most common form of MD normativism holds that the meaning\nof linguistic expressions is determined by rules for their\nuse. This idea was famously formulated by Ludwig Wittgenstein, and\nwe shall concentrate on it in this section. Drawing an analogy between\nthe rules of games and those of language, Wittgenstein wrote in his\nso-called ‘Middle Period’: \n\nAt a minimum, MD normativism claims that the following not only is\nessential for, but also metaphysically prior to, an expression\ne‘s having meaning M (for a speaker, or group\nof speakers, S at a time t): \n(MD)   e means M for S at t only if\nthere is a rule R for the use of e in force\nfor S at\n t.[25] \n\nBut why should we think that meaning is (essentially)\nrule-determined? And if it is, how exactly does this work? What kind of\nrule could do this job? What does it mean for such a rule to be in\nforce for a speaker, and where does this force come from? We shall take\nthese questions up in turn. \n\nSince ancient times, philosophers have observed the arbitrary,\ncontingent nature of the connection between linguistic expressions and\ntheir meanings. Moreover, this connection seems to be somehow\n‘made by us’; what could be more natural than to think that\nit is established by convention? \n\nBut even though conventions might be norms or rules somehow made by us,\nthe MD normativist cannot simply claim, for instance, that it is a\nconvention of English that ‘green’ means green.\nThe MD normativist wants to provide an account of what meaning is, and,\nto be informative, such an account needs to be formulated in\nnon-semantic terms (cf. Davidson 1982). Moreover, it does of course not\nfollow from a relation’s being ‘arbitrary’,\ncontingent, or even ‘made by us’, that it is conventional\nin any interesting sense.[26] \nThere are innumerable regularities in our\nbehavior (such as moving down hallways by putting one foot in front of\nthe other) that are neither necessities of any sort, nor due to\nconvention. An observation that might cast some doubt on the idea that\nthe regularities of linguistic usage are due to convention is the\nfollowing: People who follow rules, or conventions, when, for instance,\nplaying chess or driving cars on the right hand side of the road in\ncontinental Europe, can usually, upon reflection, both at least roughly\nformulate the relevant rule or convention and give it as their reason\nfor acting as they did. When it comes to the semantic rules of natural\nlanguage, this is strikingly far from being the case. There are various\nways in which the MD normativst could try to accommodate this\nobservation (see section 2.2.2 below), but some explanation clearly is\nneeded. \n\nOver and above its intuitive appeal, there are various more\ntheoretical reasons for MD normativism. It is, for instance, plausible\nto think that meaning, in some way or other, is determined by the\nuse speakers make of linguistic expressions. If meaning\ndetermining rules are rules governing the use of linguistic\nexpressions, MD normativism provides the beginnings of an answer to the question of just\nhow use does this. A natural thought here is that semantic rules effect\na distinction between (semantically) correct and incorrect use of an\nexpression. An expression governed by such a rule consequently is an\nexpression that has (semantic) correctness conditions and, thus,\nmeaning (cf. Glock 2000). If meaning determining rules moreover are\nprescriptions, MD normativism provides a metaphysics directly\nunderwriting the most common form of ME normativism: ME\nprescriptivism. \n\nMD normativism is often taken to provide solutions to certain\nclassical problems of meaning determination, most prominently the\n“problem of error”. As we noted above (section 2.1.1), the\nproblem of error, by itself, would seem to be a problem for\nnaturalistic accounts of meaning determination quite independently of\nnormativity. It might be argued, however, that it is precisely because\nmeaning is determined normatively that any naturalistic account is\nbound to misconstrue semantic correctness conditions. Or it might be\nargued that MD normativism’s superior capacity to deal with the\nproblem of error provides evidence for its being the right account of\nmeaning determination. \nAn argument of the first kind might draw inspiration from the writings\nof Donald Davidson. Davidson (1970) famously argued that meaning and\nintentional content are determined by a constitutive principle called\nthe “principle of charity”, while physical predicates and\nconcepts obey constitutive principles of a nature so radically\ndifferent as to prevent any reductive account of the former in terms\nof the latter. According to Davidson, speakers essentially are by and\nlarge rational creatures and beliefs are by their nature\n‘veridical’ (Davidson 1983), that is, by and large true in\nthe circumstances under which they are held.  According to the\nprinciple of charity, the best interpretation of a\nspeaker S therefore is that which optimises overall coherence, or\nrationality, and truth across S’s utterances, propositional attitudes,\nand intentional actions (e.g., Davidson 1973, 1974, 1991; for more on\nthe principle of charity, see Glüer 2011, ch. 3). Because of its appeal\nto rationality, the principle of charity has been interpreted as a\nnormative principle, and Davidson as a normativist (see for instance,\nMcDowell 1984; Hornsby 1997, 87; Gampel 1997; Hurley 1998, 5; Glock\n2000; Jackman 2004; Wedgwood 2007, 161ff; Kriegel 2010). \nThis is disputed, however; it has been argued that precisely because\nthe principle of charity is the principle constitutive of meaning and\ncontent in Davidson, it cannot play any normative role. It determines\nwhat meaningful utterances (contentful mental states) are, not how\nanything should be or what anyone should do (cf. Glüer 2001;\nWikforss 2001; Schroeder 2003; Engel 2008, 187ff; for a different\nargument to the conclusion that charity is not a normative principle,\nsee Bilgrami 1992, 102ff.). Quite independently, the claim that\nrationality is essentially normative might not appear any less\ncontroversial than the claim that meaning is (cf.  Schnädelbach\n1990; Kolodny 2005; Broome 2007; Glüer & Wikforss 2013a). \n\nThe MD normativist might also argue, as indicated above, that\nnormativism prevents the problem of error from arising. Such arguments\ncan take two forms. The normativist can argue that for instance the\nsupervenience base that non-normative dispositionalism works with needs\nto be restricted: It is not the whole of a speaker’s dispositions\nto use their terms that determines meanings, but only a certain kind of\ndisposition and this kind can only be specified by means of its\nnormative properties. In this vein, Wedgwood argues more generally that\nit is only “rational” dispositions that determine\nintentional content (where rationality is taken to be a normative\nproperty; cf. Wedgwood 2007, 167ff; 2009). Normative teleosemantics can\nbe construed as making a similar move: Here, it is those dispositions\nrealizing the biological function of the mechanism of using an\nexpression that determine meaning (where ‘biological\nfunction’ is taken to be something normative; cf. Millikan 1990,\nNeander 1995). \n\nMore radically, the MD normativist can take problems such as that of\nerror as indicating that dispositionalism misidentifies the very kind\nof entitities meaning supervenes on: It is not how you are disposed to\nuse an expression that determines its meaning, but how you are supposed\nto use it, i.e., the norms that are in force for the use of the\nexpression in question (cf. Glock 2000, Brandom 1994, 159). Their being\nin force then might, or might not, be further reducible or analyzable,\nbut not to dispositions for the use of expressions. \n\nAlternatively, the MD normativist might adopt an account according to\nwhich meaning determination has two components, a dispositionalist and\na normativist component. Ginsborg (2011a, b; 2012) argues that to mean\nsomething by a linguistic expression, the speaker must not only be\ndisposed to use it in a certain way but also be disposed to take the\nway she is disposed to use it to be “primitively\nappropriate” (see above, 2.1.1). Her idea is that while\ndispositions do suffice for determining meanings – in the\nsense in which meanings can be correlated with the\ndispositions of both the genuine speaker and the parrot or automaton\n– (primitive) norms are nevertheless required for\ngenuinely meaningful speech or understanding (cf. esp. Ginsborg 2012,\n138; Ginsborg 2011a, 244f). Such an account of meaning determination\nwould be “partially reductive” (Ginsborg 2011a, 230; 249):\nit would combine a naturalist component with a non-semantic but\nnormative (and minimally intentional) component. On Ginsborg’s\naccount, however, the (primitive) normative attitudes required for\ngenuinely meaningful use of linguistic expressions do not determine\nsemantic correctness conditions for these expressions –\nthat job is to be done by the speaker’s basic dispositions to use\nthem. \n\nThere is a widespread tendency to see naturalism and normativism as\nincompatible in the theory of meaning determination (see also section 4\nbelow), but from what we just said, their relation would seem to be\nmore complicated. Prima facie, both reductive naturalism (such as, for\ninstance, a version of teleosemantics) and non-reductive naturalism\n(such as, for instance, Davidsonian dispositionalism) would seem\ncompatible with (certain forms of) MD normativism. Normativism is\nincompatible with reductive naturalism only if meaning is determined by\nnormative facts or properties that are not themselves naturalistic\n(normative teleosemanticists, for instance, argue that the biological\nnotion of a function is normative). Normativism is incompatible with\nnon-reductive naturalism only if there are no non-normative facts\nmeaning supervenes\n upon.[27] \n\nOther influential ideas behind MD normativism include\nWittgenstein-inspired skepticism towards meanings as ‘Platonic\nentities’; in this tradition, meanings and concepts themselves\nare construed as products of our norms or conventions (cf. for\ninstance, Baker & Hacker 1985, 269ff). Another idea derives from\nmeaning’s psychological role: It has been argued that, since\ncompetent speakers are guided in their use of expressions by the\nknowledge of their meanings, a knowledge that is general in form, such\nguidance must be construed as guidance by rules (cf., for instance,\nBoghossian 2008, 489; see also section 2.1.2 above). The question here\nwould be whether guidance by some state with general content is\nsufficient for rule guidedness (cf. Glüer & Wikforss\n2010a). \n\nAssume that meaning is determined by rules. How exactly does this\nwork? What kind of rule could do this job? What does it mean for such a\nrule to be ‘in force’ for a speaker or group of\nspeakers? \n\nMeaning determining rules clearly would be constitutive\nrules (see section 1.2 above): Meaningful use of linguistic\nexpressions is metaphysically impossible without such rules. Moreover,\nmeaning determining rules (usually) are supposed to determine not only\nthat an expression has meaning, but also which\nmeaning it has. These ideas are drawn on by a great number of\nphilosophers, including Wittgenstein scholars such as Baker and Hacker\nor Glock, as well as philosophers such as von Wright, Sellars, and\nSearle. \n\nHowever, as we saw above there are different conceptions of\nconstitutive rules. On the traditional view, a constitutive rule is\nsuch that it ‘creates’ new kinds of action, i.e., kinds of\naction that could not be performed if the rule did not exist, or were\nnot in force. Such rules typically can be brought into the following\nform: \n(CR)   In C, doing X counts as doing Y.\n  \n\nSearle suggests that meaning is determined by such rules (1963,\n42ff). It is not obvious, however, how this would work. Rules like this\ncannot determine meaning by means of the line of thought sketched\nabove: By directly effecting a distinction between correct and\nincorrect uses of an expression – rules of the form (CR) do not\nmake any such distinction (cf. Glüer & Pagin 1999). Such rules\nmight, however, determine meaning more indirectly (cf. Glock 2000). The\nfollowing might be such a rule, for instance: \n(CR1)   In C, uttering s counts as saying\nthat p,\n  \n\nwhere s is a sentence. It has been argued, however, that\nsuch a rule is not truly constitutive; it does not ‘create’\nthe possibility of performing actions of the relevant kind, i.e., saying\nthat p. Rather, saying that p seems to be possible\nindependently of (CR1), and (CR1) only provides\none (among many possible) means of performing such an action (cf.\nGlüer & Pagin 1999, 218f). \n\nIt might be more promising to allow meaning determining rules to\nhave prescriptive force. In that case, it would be possible for them to\ndirectly effect a distinction between (semantically) correct\n(prescribed or allowed) and incorrect (forbidden) uses. They could\nnevertheless be constitutive of using an expression with the determined\nmeaning insofar as it would be impossible to so use the expression\nunless the prescription was in force for the speaker. \n\nWhat, then, does it mean for a meaning determining rule R\nto be in force for a speaker S’s use of an expression\ne (at a time\n t)?[28] \nBroadly, there are three main\noptions for the MD normativist (see section 1.2 above). According to\nthe first, using e (at t) has to be\nmotivated by R. For R to be in force for\nS’s use of e, S has to follow\nR in the sense of attempting to do what is in accordance with\nR. On the second construal, S has to accept\nR in some sense not requiring (all) particular uses of\ne to be motivated by R. Both of these would\nplausibly seem to require S to have certain intentional\nstate(s). But, third, R‘s being in force for S\ncould also be construed as independent of any of S’s\nintentional states (with respect to R). \n\nThe laws of the state, for instance, would seem to fall into the\nthird category; they are in force even for those individual citizens\nwho do not accept them. Analogously, meaning determining rules might be\nin force in a speech community independently of an individual\nspeaker’s acceptance of them. Many games are in the second\ncategory; they are such that even though participation requires players\nto accept their rules, participants nevertheless can intentionally\nviolate these very rules within the game. For instance, intentional\nspearing does occur in icehockey games, and will be punished precisely\nbecause the rule against spearing is in force even for players who\nspear intentionally. Again, in semantics the situation might seem\nanalogous: Speakers can intentionally say semantically incorrect things\nwithout their expressions losing or changing their meanings (cf.\nRailton 1999; Glüer & Pagin 1999; Glüer 1999; 2001; Wikforss\n2001). Nevertheless, it might not be possible for these rules to be in\nforce in complete independence of a whole speech community’s\nattitudes towards it, and even the individual speaker might need to at\nleast in general accept such rules. \n\nThe most common idea, however, is that expressions ‘get’\ntheir meanings by speakers’ following the rules for\ntheir use (see, for instance, Baker & Hacker 1985, 154ff, Glock\n1996, 323ff); speaking meaningfully is conceived of as a form of\nrule-guided action. Let’s call this form of MD\nnormativism ‘guidance normativism’. \n\nGuidance normativism by itself is neutral on the question of whether\nan individual speaker could adopt, and follow, rules for her own\nidiolect (as, for instance, Baker & Hacker 1985, 169ff, hold), or\nwhether it necessarily takes a community of speakers to put semantic\nrules into force. Many philosophers subscribe to\n‘communitarianism’, however; they hold that so-called\n‘solitary’ languages, i.e., languages spoken by only one\nspeaker, are impossible. When combined with MD normativism,\ncommunitarianism usually construes meaning determining rules as\nconventions adopted by whole speech communities. This is\noften motivated by an interpretation of Wittgenstein’s rule-following\nconsiderations and the so-called ‘private language\nargument’ according to which these show that the notion of a\nmistake does not have any application outside a whole community of\nspeakers (among others, Kripke 1982, Wright 1980: 218–220;\nPeacocke 1981, McDowell 1984, Williams 1999). Another motivation is\nprovided by, among others, Dummett. Dummett argues, first, that\nregular use by a whole community of speakers is a condition on an\nexpression’s having linguistic meaning, and, second, that therefore a\nnormative attitude towards the common language is required of each\nindividual speaker (Dummett 1991, 85). Davidson questioned both steps\nof Dummett’s argument; while regularity of use usually makes\ncommunication easier there is, according to him, no regularity such\nthat, on every particular occasion, accordance with it would be either\nnecessary or sufficient for successful communication (cf. Davidson\n1986). Moreover, even if regularity were required, Davidson argued, it\nwould not matter how it came about; communication would be possible\nwhether or not the required regularity was a product of normative\nattitudes (cf. Davidson 1994; Glüer 2013 provides a survey of\nthese discussions). \n\nEven more radically, it has been questioned whether it is even\npossible to draw any substantive distinction between rule guided and\nmerely regular behavior at this fundamental level. Yet such a\ndistinction is crucial for guidance normativism. As Quine classically\nnoted, on pain of vicious regress, meaning determining rules or\nconventions cannot be explicitly and deliberately adopted; they must\nsomehow be “implicit” in the behavior of speakers. But\nthen, Quine argued, we risk depriving the notion of a linguistic rule\n“of any explanatory force and reducing it to an idle label”\n(Quine 1935, 106). The crucial question thus is what the distinction\nbetween rule guided behavior and merely regular behavior amounts to\nwhen it comes to meaning determining rules. \n\nIntuitively, behavior guided by an (implicit or explicit) rule\nR is behavior that can be explained by means of R or,\nmore precisely, behavior that can be given a\nreasons-explanation involving R, an explanation in\nterms of the reason-providing intentional states of the agent. Examples\nof such an “intentional condition” on rule following would\nbe an intention to follow R (e.g. Baker & Hacker 1985,\n155; Glock 1996, 325), or some other state of accepting or\ninternalizing R (Boghossian 2008). \n\nApplying a traditional belief-desire model, Glüer and Pagin\n(1999) suggest understanding guidance by a rule R in general\nby means of the following practical syllogism: \n(PA1)   I want to do what R requires, \n(B)       R requires that I Φ, \n(PA2)   So, I want to Φ, \n\nwhere (PAi) is a pro-attitude (desire,\nintention, acceptance), and (B) a belief. They also argue that if a\nmeaning determining rule R for an expression e\nrequires e to be used correctly, there is no room for such\nrules in the explanation of speech acts: If a speaker wants to say that\np, a rule requiring them to use e correctly not only\nis of no help, there is no “slot” in the practical\nsyllogism into which it would coherently fit (Glüer & Pagin\n1999, 223f). It would thus seem that if an intentional condition on\nguidance by meaning determining rules can be integrated into a general\nmodel of reasons explanation, an alternative way of doing that is\nrequired. \n\nAnother question concerns the relation between thought (or\nintentional states in general) and language. On any account construing\nthought as dependent on language, as well as on any account construing\nthought and language as interdependent, and on any account according to\nwhich mental content itself is determined by rules governing mental\nexpressions, an intentional condition on rule guidance would inevitably\nlead guidance normativism back into vicious regress (cf. Boghossian\n1989a; 2008). For instance, if having an intentional state with a\ncertain content is itself a matter of being guided by a content\ndetermining rule, then another intentional state is required for having\nthe first one, and so on ad infinitum. It has therefore been argued\nthat according to Wittgenstein there must be a basic form of rule\nfollowing that is not subject to any intentional condition, but\n“blind” (Wright 2007). Alternatively, it has been argued\nthat therefore the late Wittgenstein did not conceive of meaningful use\nof language as rule guided anymore (Glüer & Wikforss\n2010a). \n\nAn independent, general argument against an intentional condition on\nrule guidance has been provided by Boghossian (2008, 493f): He argues\nthat the relevant intentional state would be a state with general\n(prescriptive) content, and that acting under particular circumstances\non an intentional state with general content always involves some sort\nof inference. Inference itself, however, essentially involves\nfollowing a rule, and thus a regress – reminiscent of that\nfamiliar from Lewis Caroll (1895) – ensues. However, this\nargument crucially depends on the assumption that inference is\nessentially rule guided, an assumption which is at least controversial\n(cf. Glüer & Wikforss 2010a). \n\nTogether with the observation recorded earlier – that speakers do\nnot usually seem to have the kind of privileged access to semantic\nrules that we would expect if these were action guiding in the\nintentional sense – considerations like these have driven some\nphilosophers to try to locate the explanatory power of meaning\ndetermining rules elsewhere. Thus, some draw an analogy between the\nexplanation of speech dispositions by means of systems of semantic\nrules and the evolutionary explanation of animal traits and behavior by\nnatural selection. In each case, there are regularities of behavior the\nexplanation of which is non-intentional, but which are nevertheless not\nmerely accidental. In contradistinction to truly evolutionary\nexplanations, explanations of speech dispositions by means of\n(institutionalized) systems of rules remain only quasi-evolutionary;\nthe crucial explanans is not natural selection, but the system of rules\nthat exists prior to the individual speaker’s acquisition of\nlanguage (cf. Sellars 1954, Searle 1995). While such explanation might\nwork well for the use an individual speaker learns to make of the\nexpressions of an existing language, whether any distinction between\nrule explained and merely regular behavior has been substantiated now\ndepends on substantiating a further distinction: that between a system\nof rules and one of mere regularities. To take Sellars’ example:\nWhy would the bee dance instantiate mere regularities that receive a\ntruly evolutionary explanation, while a human natural language\ninstantiates a system of rules? (Cf. Glüer 2002, 173f.) \n\nAnother idea might thus be to locate meaning determining normativity\nin the very idea of an evolutionary explanation, in the idea of a\nbiological function, for instance, the possession of which explains why\ncertain dispositions or mechanisms (for speech or mental\nrepresentation) are selected for, as in normative \nteleosemantics.[29] Yet\nanother possibility would be to combine computational and teleosemantic\nideas for rule following at the level of mental representation. Here, a\ndistinction between personal level rule following and sub-personal rule\nfollowing could be used. Thus, it has been proposed to construe\nsub-personal rule following as analogous to computational rule\nfollowing, and semantic rules as rules deriving from the biological\nfunctions of our cognitive apparatus (cf. Jacob 2005, 200f). Semantic\nrule following would then allow for truly evolutionary explanation. It\nhas been argued that this would amount to a highly problematic\ndispositionalism, not about meaning, but about sub-personal rule\nfollowing itself (cf. Boghossian 2008). However, if the notion of a\nbiological function helps solve the classical problems of meaning\ndispositionalism, it might solve those of dispositionalism about\nrule-following, too. Still, the basic question recurs: What it is that\ndistinguishes a sub-personal regularity from a performance governed by\na sub-personal rule? Since not everything with a biological function\nwould seem to be rule governed even in this sense, any account along\nthese lines will at least need to add further \nelements.[30] \n\nGinsborg (2011a, b; 2012) suggests that the normativity of meaning can\nbe defended by interpreting the relevant ‘ought’ in way\nquite radically different from that dominant in most of the\nnormativity debates: as a “primitive ought”. Interpreted\nas a primitive ought, it conveys the primitively normative attitudes\nspeakers must have towards their own uses of linguistic\nexpressions. Having primitively normative attitudes does not require\nprior grasp of rules, concepts, or meanings. Moreover, the norms\nspeakers need to be primitively conscious of do not guide or\njustify them in their use of expressions (Ginsborg 2011b,\n170).[31] \nAnd finally, the primitive ‘ought’ relevant to meaning\ncannot be explicated in terms of, or equated with, truth\n– to be primitively correct is more fundamental than\nbeing semantically correct: Primitive normativity is not required to\ndetermine what is semantically correct (and incorrect), but rather to\n“distinguish the production of a term from mere noise”\n(Ginsborg 2012, 132, quoting Blackburn 1984, 281), or, more generally,\nto determine which behaviour is “subject to normative evaluation\nat all” (2011a, 243, fn.\n 21).[32] \n\nPrimitive normativity thus is what distinguishes the behaviour of the\nspeaker who uses her terms with understanding from that of\nthe parrot, or automaton. Using a term with understanding requires\nmore than just being disposed to use it a certain way, Ginsborg\nargues; it requires understanding that it has a certain\nmeaning. If a speaker for instance uses ‘slab’ to mean\nslab, she needs to grasp or recognize that it means\nslab (2012, 135). Ginsborg’s ambition is precisely to provide\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for what it is to have this\nunderstanding. \n \nThe account of meaning determination she arrives at has two\ncomponents. Since one of them is a requirement of primitive\nnormativity, primitive normativity qualifies as a (new) kind of\nmeaning determining normativity. In rough outline, the account looks\nlike this: If e has meaning, the first disposition suffices to\ndetermine which meaning it has. But e has meaning only if the\nsecond disposition is in place. Moreover, if both conditions are\nfulfilled, having the primitively normative attitude of taking the use\none is disposed to make of e amounts to understanding that\ne means M. \n\nThese conditions are not only necessary, but sufficient for meaning,\nGinsborg argues, because they allow us “to make sense of a given\nresponse being correct or incorrect” (2011a, 245), where\ncorrectness now is semantic correctness. Once these\nconditions are fulfilled, a particular use of e might not\nonly be such that you “did not do what you were disposed to do,\nbut also did not do what you were disposed to regard as\nappropriate” (ibid.). This, Ginsborg submits, is enough to make\nsuch a use of e into a mistake. Once these conditions are\nfulfilled, that is, the uses you are disposed to make of e\n“can retrospectively be identified as the extension of\n[e]” (2012, 138). And then, your primitively normative\nattitude amounts to understanding that e means what it does. \n\nAt the time of this update, Ginsborg’s interpretation of the\nnormativity of meaning (and content) as primitive has not been widely\ndiscussed. As the proposal is very interesting, and indeed rather\ndifferent from more established interpretations of the normativity of\nmeaning, this no doubt will change soon. Among the questions to be\nasked, it seems to us, are at least the following: Is it really the\ncase that dispositional facts cannot be quussed (see above, 2.1.1;\nHaddock 2012; Verheggen 2015)? And if not, can Ginsborg’s\ntwo-component account be salvaged? If the account is extended to\nintentional content (as Ginsborg herself hints it can, for instance in\n2012, 127, fn.1) won’t that give rise to regress worries? Is it\nreally plausible to claim that a primitively normative attitude\ntowards the use one is disposed to make of an expression amounts to\nknowing (or grasping or recognizing) what the expression means? How\nare we precisely to understand the primitive notion of appropriateness\nor correctness? On the one hand, there seems to be a need for\nprimitive and semantic correctness to coincide – if it is\nto be plausible that awareness of primitive correctness amounts to\nknowledge of meaning. As Ginsborg explains, once her conditions are\nfulfilled, what is primitively correct can be identified with what is\nin e’s extension, i.e. with what is semantically\ncorrect. On the other hand, the two notions need to be distinct\n– if it is to be plausible that having a primitive\nnormative attitude does not require concepts like those of rule or\ntruth. So what precisely is the difference between the two\nnotions?[33] And\nif they are different, doesn’t that mean that an attitude of\nprimitively taking a use of an expression to be correct cannot amount\nto semantically taking it to be correct? Simply because these\nattitudes have different contents? \n\nIn the normativity debate the main focus has been on meaning: This\nis true of the Kripke discussion as well as of earlier discussions\nconcerning the rulishness of language. However, parallel claims have\nalso been made about mental content and recently the thesis that\ncontent is essentially normative has come into focus (McDowell &\nPettit 1986, Brandom 1994, Engel 2000, Boghossian 2003, Gibbard 2003,\nMillar\n 2004, Jarvis 2012).[34] \n\nContent normativism claims that the following is both necessary, and\nessential to, a mental state M‘s having a content\np: \n(C)   M has content p only if there is a rule, or\nsystem of rules, R in force for\n M.[35] \n\nThe relevant notion of content is that of propositional content,\nsomething that can be judged, and the norms in question govern the\n‘use’ of concepts. We intend the talk of propositions and\nconcepts in this context to be uncontentious, and not depend on any\nspecific construals of these notions. A proposition, simply, is\nanything that has truth conditions essentially; it is whatever the\npropositional attitudes are attitudes towards. And talking of\n“concepts” should not be understood as implying a\ncommitment to either structured contents or to a language-like,\nsyntactically structured medium of representation. In this sense, a\nconcept is ‘used’ whenever a subject has an intentional\nmental\n state.[36] \n\nAs in the case of meaning, we distinguish between CE normativity,\nwhich is neutral on the question how content is determined, and CD\nnormativity which takes the norms to be metaphysically primary. We\nshall begin by discussing CE normativity. \n\nAccording to CE normativity statements of the form ‘mental\nstate M has content p’ have normative\nconsequences. The norms are typically construed as norms of action,\nmost commonly as prescriptions, but could also be construed\naxiologically. That is, the claim need not be that the relevant norms\nguide our use of concepts, but could just be that it is a property\nessential to their having content that certain mental states (true\nbeliefs, for instance) are valuable. \n\nAs in the case of meaning, we may distinguish between more or less\ndirect arguments. One way to provide a direct argument for CE\nnormativity would be to proceed from the notion of correctness\nconditions, in analogy with the simple argument (Boghossian 2003: 85).\nJust as meaningful expressions have correctness conditions essentially,\nalong the lines of (CM), so do concepts: The concept green,\nfor instance, applies to an object x if and only if x\nis green. However, unlike in the case of (CM), the application relation\nhere is just that between a concept and the objects that ‘fall\nunder’ it. For normativity to enter some connection has to be\nmade with the subject who employs the concepts, with her mental\nstates. \n\nThe standard normativist strategy consists in appealing to the use\nof concepts in propositional attitudes, and to derive the normativity\nof content from that of the propositional attitudes. Thus, the relevant\nnotion of application is suggested to be that of using the concept in a\npropositional attitude, in particular that of belief. Arguments for CE\nnormativity, therefore, typically appeal to the connection between\ncontent and the propositional attitudes. We shall consider two such\ncommon arguments: one that goes via the nature of belief, and one that\ngoes via ideas about concept grasp. \n\nThe argument from belief proceeds in two steps: It is argued, first,\nthat belief is essentially normative, and second, that there is an\nessential connection between belief and content such that if belief is\nessentially normative it follows that content is, too. Our main concern\nhere is not with the normativity of belief, but some comments\nconcerning the first step are required. \n\nAccording to the most common proposal, the normativity of belief\nderives from the connection between belief and truth. It is in the\nnature of belief, it is held, that it aims for truth. The proposal is\nnot merely that beliefs, essentially, have contents that are true or\nfalse, but that beliefs, essentially, are correct or incorrect as a\nresult of the content being true or false. Belief is simply that state\nwhich derives its correctness conditions from the content (Velleman\n2000, Engel 2001, 2013, Nordhoof 2002, Wedgwood 2002, 2007, 2013,\nBoghossian 2003, Gibbard 2003, 2005, 2012, Shah 2003, Speaks\n2009). \n\nIn response, it has been argued that what is essential to belief is\nmerely that beliefs have contents that are true or false, not that one\nought to believe a content if and only if it is true. The appearance of\nnormativity, it is suggested, derives from other sources. For instance,\nas epistemic agents, we seek truth. And having true beliefs is\nessential to fulfilling our goals. This just shows that true beliefs\nhave an instrumental value, and fails to support the normativity of\nbelief thesis. Moreover, it is argued, even if it is claimed that truth\nhas a non-instrumental value, the value in question is derived from\nmoral or other values, not from the nature of belief as such (Papineau\n1999, 2013, Dretske 2000, Davidson 2001, Horwich 2013). \n\nQuestions have also been raised concerning how the norm of belief is\nto be understood. With respect to meaning the question arose whether\n(ME1) violates the principle that ought implies\ncan. In the case of belief, a similar worry arises if the norm\nof belief is formulated in a parallel fashion, by proceeding from the\ncorrectness conditions of beliefs to normative consequences: \n(CB)   The belief that p is correct if and only if p. \n(NB1)   S ought to believe that p if and\nonly if p. \n\nThe trouble is that (NB1) implies that S ought\nto believe everything that is true, an impossible task. This\ndifficulty, it has been argued, is not solved by appealing to a\nwide-scope reading of ‘ought’ since there are values of\np that are such that S could neither bring it about\nthat p is false, nor bring it about that she believes\np (Bykvist & Hattiangadi 2007:\n 284).[37]\nThe most common reaction,\ninstead, is to weaken the norm (Boghossian 2003: 37): \n(NB2)   S ought to believe that p only\nif p.\n  \n\nThis norm does not imply that S ought to believe everything\nthat is true, and hence does not put impossible demands on S.\nHowever, as noted in the discussion of (ME1) above, the\nquestion arises whether (NB2) suffices to provide any real\nconstraints on S‘s belief formation. If p is\ntrue it does not follow that S ought to believe p,\nand if p is false it merely follows that it is not the case\nthat S ought to believe p – not that\nS ought not to believe p (Bykvist & Hattiangadi\n2007: 280).[38]\nIn response, normativists have made the same move as in the case of\nmeaning, and suggested that the ‘ought’ in (NB1) is\nreplaced with a ‘may’ (Whiting 2010: 216–217, 2013b:\n125). It has been objected that this is too weak since it undermines\nthe fundamental role of the norm of truth when it comes to explaining\nother evidential and inferential norms (Bykvist & Hattiangadi\n2013: 113–114). \n\nIt has also been suggested that the normativity of belief should be\nconstrued in terms of ‘role oughts’, and that these are not\nsubject to the principle that ought implies can\n(Chrisman 2008, Feldman 2001). Each role comes with criteria of\nexcellence and these, in turn, imply obligations: Teachers ought to be\nclear, parents ought to be caregiving, etc. Norms for actions,\ntherefore, derive from norms of\n being.[39]\nSimilarly, as human beings we play the role\nof believers, of creatures with intentional states, and being engaged\nin this role we ought to do it well: We ought to believe that which is\ntrue (for instance). Hence, on this view, (NB1) is a norm of\nbelief even if it places impossible demands on ordinary\n subjects.[40] \nA related idea is that the relevant norms should be understood in\nterms of the ‘telos’ of belief: Just as a map is a map\n(giving a correct or incorrect picture of the world) only insofar as\nit is designed to represent the world, and in this sense\nought to represent the world correctly, so a belief can be\nsaid to be correct or incorrect only insofar as representing the world\nbelongs to its telos, to what it ought to do. Since this type of\n‘ought’ applies to the representing objects (such as maps\nor beliefs) and not to agents, it is argued, they are not\naction-guiding and the principle that ought implies\ncan does not apply (Jarvis \n2012).[41] \n\n Another set of questions concerns the fact\nthat (NB1) is an objective\n norm.[42]\nUnlike a subjective norm, such\nas ‘S ought to believe that p only if\nS has evidence for p’, (NB1) does\nnot engage with S‘s reasons, her beliefs and desires,\nand this raises the question how (NB1) can serve to guide\nour belief formation. In response, it has been suggested that many\nnorms are objective norms (‘Buy low and sell high!’) and\nthat the only consequence of (NB1) being an objective norm\nis that it may not be transparent to S how to obey\n(NB1) (Boghossian 2003: 38). However, it has been objected\nthat the main trouble with (NB1) is not a failure of\ntransparency. It is clear that objective norms can guide, but they do\nso via our beliefs, and it has been argued that this causes trouble in\nthe case of (NB1). The trouble is two-fold. In order to be\nguided by (NB1), S would have to have a belief about\nwhether p is true. This means, first, that in order to be\nguided by (NB1) the subject would already have had to from\na belief as to whether p and hence the guidance comes too\nlate; and, second, that whatever conclusion the subject comes to as to\nwhether p, the norm tells her to hold that very belief (if\nshe forms the belief that p the norm gives her a reason to\nbelieve p and if she forms the belief that not-p the\nnorm gives her a reason to believe not-p) (Glüer &\nWikforss 2009:\n 44).[43] \n\nIt is therefore disputed whether (NB1) can be said to be\na norm of belief, regulating our belief\n formation.[44] \nAssuming that belief is intrinsically normative, however, the\ndecisive question is whether this has any implications for\ncontent. Why should the fact that belief is normative imply that\ncontent is? Indeed, it has been suggested that the opposite is true\nsince if belief is normative the appearance of normativity of content\ncan simply be explained by appealing to the normativity of belief\n(Speaks 2009: 409). According to Boghossian, the normativity of\ncontent derives from the fact that there is a constitutive connection\nbetween the notion of content and the notion of belief (Boghossian\n2003). This is so, he argues, since we could not grasp the notion of\ncontent without first grasping the role contents play in\nbelief. Moreover, Boghossian argues, although contents play a role in\nother attitudes as well, there are reasons to think that the concept\nof belief is conceptually primary: For instance, S could not\nhave the concept of desire without first having the concept of belief\n(ibid: 42–43). If so, the normativity of belief supports CE\nnormativity. \n\nThe claim that the concept of belief is primary to that of desire\ncan be questioned. Thus, there is empirical evidence from developmental\npsychology that children acquire the concept of desire prior to\nacquiring that of belief (Wellman 1993). It has also been argued that\nbelief and desire are conceptually interdependent (Miller 2008). More\nimportantly, even if it can be shown that the concept of belief is\nprimary to that of desire, and of the other propositional attitudes,\nthe question arises whether indeed one could not grasp the concept of\ncontent without grasping that of belief. Prima facie, grasping the\nconcept of a propositional attitude such as belief is rather distinct\nfrom grasping the concept of content, since it involves the idea of\ntaking up an attitude towards content.\n [45]\nMoreover, Boghossian is committed to the\nstrong claim that opponents of content normativity fail to grasp the\nconcept of content (or, alternatively, that they operate with a\ndifferent concept). \n\n An alternative strategy would be to avoid\nthe appeal to conceptual entailments and argue that there is a\nmetaphysical connection between mental content and belief such that if\nbelief is essentially normative, content is. Such an argument may be\nmore or less direct, going via more or less contentious assumptions\nabout mental content. For instance, versions of conceptual role\nsemantics imply that there is an essential link between mental content\nand belief as do versions of informational theories of content (Dretske\n1981, Fodor 1990), although the latter are typically coupled with a\nnon-normativist account of belief. Another line of reasoning appeals to\nthe idea that there is a constitutive connection between grasping a\nconcept, understanding a content, and using it in the propositional\nattitudes. \n\nTo possess a concept, it is sometimes suggested, is to have the\ncapacity to use the concept in various propositional attitudes. Since\nit is essential to the propositional attitudes that they stand in\ncertain rational interconnections with one another, it is argued, this\nessential normativity transfers to concepts and contents. Possessing a\nconcept, grasping it, incurs a commitment to use the concept ‘in\nkeeping with its content’, in the various propositional\nattitudes. If the speaker fails to do so, she has misused the\nconcept in question (Millar 2004, McDowell & Pettit 1986, Gibbard\n2012: chapter 6). \n\nThis argument runs parallel to the argument provided by Millar in\nthe case of meaning. Even if that argument is accepted, however, the\nquestion arises whether it can be applied to concepts and content,\nsince the notion of failing to use a concept in ‘keeping with its\ncontent’ appears more problematic than the notion of failing to\nuse a word in accordance with its meaning (McGinn 1984: 146–147, Millar\n2004: 180–181). It is relatively unproblematic to speak of\nunderstanding the meaning of an expression (or misunderstanding it),\nbut in the case of concepts there is nothing corresponding to the\nexpression. To ‘understand’ a concept is simply to possess\nit, to use it in thoughts. Hence there seems to be little or no room for the idea\nthat S misunderstands a concept either. If S reasons\nas if she possesses the concept ancient rather than the\nconcept arcane, it would seem to follow not that there is any\nmisuse of concepts but that she has another concept. \n\nOne strategy is to distinguish between possession conditions and\nattribution conditions (Peacocke 1992: 27–33). This separates the\nconditions that determine S‘s concepts from conditions\nfor the attribution of the concept to S. As a consequence,\nthere is a potential gap between how S uses the concept, her\ngrasp of it, and how it should be used if she were to use it in keeping\nwith its content. To illustrate the distinction, it is common to appeal\nto Tyler Burge’s discussion of how social factors, under certain\nconditions, serve to determine content (Burge 1979, Peacocke 1992: 29,\nMillar 2004: 181–188). Burge gives an account of concept attribution\nthat goes via word meaning. To be attributed the concept\narcane, on this view, it suffices that S uses the\nexpression ‘arcane’ by and large correctly, ‘in\nkeeping with its content’ – if she is committed to her\ncommunity practice of using the corresponding expression\n‘arcane’, and this practice determines that\n‘arcane’ expresses arcane. What determines her\nconcept, thus, is not merely facts about her use and dispositions to\nstand corrected, but facts about the use of the term in the wider\npractice. It follows that speakers typically have an incomplete grasp\nof the concepts they think with and, as a result, tend to misuse these\nconcepts. \n\nLeaving aside the controversial question of whether we can separate\npossession conditions of concepts from attribution conditions, it might\nbe asked whether Burge’s social externalism can be employed to\nsupport CE normativity. Burge’s argument depends on the idea that\nthe individual is committed to the community practice (Burge 1979:\n94–95, 101–102, Millar 2004: 182). But if the normativity in question\nis made conditional on the individual’s commitment to the\ncommunity, it does not follow that content is essentially normative.\nAfter all, an individual who is not thus committed would still have\nconcepts. (Equally, in the case of the experts, the suggested normative\ndimension would seem to drop out.) What would seem to be required,\nrather, is an argument to the effect that the concept expressed is\nnecessarily determined by the community practice, independently of\nS‘s commitments. \n\nAnother argument for content normativity based on incompleteness of\nunderstanding derives from Burge (1986). Burge suggests that meaning or\ncontent characterizations, such as Sofas are artifacts to be sat\nupon, have a normative function in our practices: They set\nstandards that guide our thinking. However, Burge argues, such\ncharacterizations can be rationally doubted, even by the experts; they\nare objectively right or wrong, independently of our practices (ibid:\n704–707). It follows that content is ultimately not determined socially\nbut by the nature of the objects that we causally interact with, and\nthat there are “intellectual norms that govern thinking about\nobjective matters” (ibid:\n 697).[46]\nThis argument from externalism therefore does\nnot depend on the assumption that individuals are committed to the\ncommunity practice. Instead, it depends on a version of physical\ncontent externalism applied to all kind terms (not just the natural\nkind terms), combined with the assumption that metaphysical necessities\nshould be construed as norms (see Wikforss 2003). \n\nArguments from concept grasp, again, typically appeal to the idea\nthat there are rationality constraints on concept attributions. As\nnoted in the discussion of ME normativity, the question has been raised\nwhether the idea that there are such constraints coheres with\nnormativism. It has been suggested that this question is particularly\npressing in the case of content. When it comes to meaning, there is the\noption of attributing meaning errors and explaining the error by\nappealing to the subject’s mistaken conception of the\nmeaning of an expression, thereby rationalizing her reasoning and\nactions. In the case of concepts, this option is not available, since\nthe error is said to occur at the level of content. It would either\nhave to be argued that the error can be rationalized some other way,\nor the claim that there are rationality constraints on content\nattributions would have to be rejected (see Brown 2004, Wikforss\nforthcoming-b). \n\nLike MD normativism, CD normativism is a claim about the foundations\nof intentional content: Intentional content is metaphysically\ndetermined, or constituted, by rules or norms. Since the relevant norms\nor rules govern intentional mental states, the CD normativist needs to\nfind a kind of state plausibly subject to rules or norms that by the\nsame token determine its content. Because of its intimate connection\nwith truth, knowledge, and inference, belief is the natural candidate.\nBoth truth and inferential connections in turn are intimately connected\nwith content. \n\nThus, there are three main candidates for CD norms or rules, two\nobjective and one subjective: \n(NB1)   S ought to believe that p\niff p. \n(NB3)   S ought to believe that p\niff S knows that\n p.[47] \n(NB4)   S ought to believe that p iff it is\nrational for\nS to believe that p. \n\nNote, that (NB1), (NB3), and (NB4)\neach operate with a different underlying concept of correctness; if\nbelief is defined by its “aim”, it can therefore be defined\nby only one them. Moreover, these notions of correctness can differ\neven extensionally, i.e., give different verdicts regarding the\ncorrectness of individual beliefs. Nevertheless, if conceived of as\nprima facie norms, there is nothing incoherent in supposing them all to\nbe in force for belief simultaneously. \n\nThe idea is that beliefs have contents only if (one or more of)\nthese rules are in force and, moreover, that their being in force is\nconstitutive of the contents they have. And again, a rule\nR‘s being in force can roughly be interpreted in three\nways: As requiring the subject to follow R, to\naccept R in a sense not requiring (general)\nfollowing, or as independent of the subject’s attitudes and\nintentional states towards R (see above, 1.2; 2.2.2). \n\nAs in the case of meaning, the most common idea on the market is\nthat the rules constitutive of content are rules that subjects having\ncontentful mental states need to follow. Thinkers inspired by\ntraditions such as pragmatism and/or Wittgensteinian anti-platonism\nmight also require these rules to be, in some sense, of our own making\n(Baker & Hacker 1985, Brandom 1994). Let us, again, call the\nversion of CD normativism that requires rule following “guidance\nnormativism”. Since the idea of being guided by objective norms\nis problematic for norms like (NB1) and (NB3)\n(see above, 3.1), guidance normativists often conceive of the relation\nbetween their favorite objective norm and (NB4) in\nparticular ways: If the objective norm is given priority, one\nsuggestion is that it is followed by means of following the\nsubjective rules (Boghossian 2003). If the subjective rules are seen as\nbasic, objective ones can be explained by means of them in some way or\nother. For a normative inferentialist like Brandom, for instance, this\nis the question of the relation between normative inferential role and\ntruth conditional content, and he tries to show that the latter can be\nanalysed in terms of the former. Gibbard (2005) suggests that, in\ngeneral, objective oughts can be reduced to subjective\n ones.[48]\nOther options\nfor the guidance normativist are to conceive of (NB4) as the\nbasic norm for belief, or to construe the nature of belief as given by\nboth (NB4) and (NB1) (Wedgwood 2007, 162) or\n(NB3). \n\nCandidates typically given for CD rules are rules supposed to govern\n(rational) reasoning. These can be rules of theoretical, as well as of\npractical reasoning: Prime examples are inference rules such as modus\nponens or the law of non-contradiction, and the rule that, in the\nabsence of background belief to the effect that the senses are not to\nbe trusted in the given situation, a belief that p is to be\nformed on the basis of a perceptual experience as of p. The\nprinciples of rational decision making and those of epistemic\nrationality (as, for instance, formalized in decision theory or\nBayesian epistemology) are further\n examples.[49]\nPurely formal rules would\narguably not suffice for general content determination; normative\ninferentialists such as Brandom (1994; 2000) or Peregrin (2008)\ntherefore include norms governing material implication among the\ncontent determining rules. Brandom typically describes the relevant\nnorms as norms determining what a thinker is “committed”\nand “entitled” to in holding a particular attitude towards\na particular content. \n\nThe plausibility of guidance normativism, be it with respect to\nmeaning or content, depends on whether it can account for the\ndifference between rule following and mere accordance with the relevant\nrules. It has been argued by several authors that CD normativism, on\npain of vicious infinite regress, cannot put any intentional\ncondition on rule guidance (Boghossian 1989a; 2008; Glüer &\nWikforss 2009, see also above, 2.2): If another intentional state\nM2 is required to make the formation an intentional\nstate M1 into a rule-guided performance and,\nthereby, give it its content, yet another intentional state\nM3 will be required to give M2\nits content. And so on, ad infinitum. \n\nA pragmatic conception of rule guidance might therefore seem to be\nrequired. The single most elaborate such conception is Brandom’s\nnormative version of inferentialism (Brandom 1994). To avoid regresses,\nBrandom takes norms implicitly “instituted” by our\npractices to be basic and proposes a pragmatic phenomenalism\nabout such norms. Phenomenalism is the claim that objective\n“deontic statuses” are to be explained in terms of our\nnormative attitudes. Something’s being correct, that is,\nis to be explained in terms of the attitude of taking it to be\ncorrect. Therefore, the norms in question are “in some sense\ncreatures of ours” (1994, 626). Nevertheless, Brandom explicitly\naims at securing, and explaining, the “objectivity of\nconcepts” (1994, xvii). Commentators such as Rosen (1997) and\nGlüer and Wikforss (2009) therefore interpret Brandom as offering\na realist account of content, not some form of expressivism (as other\ncommentators, such as Gibbard (1996), attribute to Brandom). Brandom\naims at reducing the intentional to the normative, while holding the\nnormative itself to be irreducible. In this sense, it is “norms\nall the way down” (1994, 44; 625). Ultimately, being\ncorrect is to be explained in terms of being correctly taken\nto be correct. \n\nGeneral questions that have been raised about this project include\nthe question of whether it ultimately can secure the possibility of\nobjective concepts or contents, contents the truth of which is\nindependent of our attitudes. It has been argued that since normative\nstatuses are explained by means of further normative statuses,\npragmatic phenomenalism cannot tell us anything informative about how\nwe make or “institute” the basic norms implicit in our\npractices (cf. Rosen 2001, Hattiangadi 2003). In a similar vein, it has\nbeen questioned that pragmatic phenomenalism manages to account for the\ndifference between mere accordance with these rules and\n“instituting” them; if for any normative status to be\ninstituted by an implicit norm a further normative status already needs\nto be so instituted, an infinite regress of (implicit) norms might\nensue despite the pragmatist nature of the proposal (cf. Hattiangadi\n2007, 197; Glüer & Wikforss 2009, 60ff). This regress might\nnot be vicious if the project is interpreted as an expressivist one,\nhowever. \n\nEven if guidance normativism would ultimately not be able to sustain\na substantive difference between following a content determining rule\nand mere accordance with it, one might still hold on to the claim that\nthere are contentful intentional states only if the rules of\nrationality are in force for them. Such force might require acceptance,\nbut not (general) guidance, or it might be completely independent of\nthe attitudes of thinkers. Insofar as acceptance itself is intentional,\nhowever, CD normativism might prove viable only if the force of the\nrelevant rules or norms is construed as completely independent of the\nattitudes of the thinkers. Some relevant ideas as to how such rule\nfollowing might be understood were already discussed above, at the end\nof section 2.2. \n\nThe idea that the normative in some sense is not part of nature goes\nback at least to Kant (see, for instance, Critique of Pure\nReason (1781), A 547). Already Hume (in the Treatise\n(1739–1740)) argued against the metaethical naturalist that\nought cannot be derived from is – to try to do\nso would be to commit a so-called “naturalistic fallacy”.\nWith the “open question argument”, Moore (in Principia\nEthica (1903)) added a weapon to the anti-naturalist’s\narsenal also against giving naturalistic accounts of moral evaluations:\nAccording to the open question argument, there is no naturalistic (set\nof) concept(s) analytically equivalent to the moral concept of\ngoodness, since no matter what naturalistic definition is given, the\nquestion whether all and only things satisfying it are good still makes\nsense. Much of recent normativism about meaning/content continues in\nthis anti-naturalist tradition; many normativists about meaning/content\nhold that the essential normativity of meaning/content makes at least (fully)\nreductive naturalism untenable. \n\nThis is certainly how many have construed Kripke’s Wittgenstein; it is\npart of his skeptical campaign against semantic facts in general that\nsuch facts cannot be reduced to whatever precisely is allowed in a\nnaturalistic supervenience base for meaning/content. As we have seen\nabove (section 2.2), matters are rather more complicated here,\nthough. On the one hand, it is a matter of dispute among\nteleosemanticists, for instance, whether the biological concept of a\nfunction is a normative concept, or not. On the other, it is clearly\npossible to endorse the claim that meaning/content supervenes upon\nnon-semantic, non-normative facts without thereby being committed to\nreductive naturalism. In between, there is quite some room, for\ninstance for partially reductive accounts construing meaning/content\nas determined by a dispositional and a non-semantic, but normative\ncomponent.  Nevertheless, it seems clear that if there is an argument of the\ngeneral, a priori kind Kripke’s skeptic would need, it is\nsupposed to come from normativism (cf. Boghossian 1989a, 509; Wikforss\n2001, 203; Hattiangadi 2007, 64).  Such an argument could take a\nweaker, intensionalist, and a stronger, extensionalist, form\n(cf. Boghossian 1989a, 532ff): The stronger argument concludes that no\nreductive naturalist account of meaning/content will be extensionally\ncorrect: For any meaning/concept, such an account will either include\nobjects in its extension that, intuitively, do not belong there, or\nexclude objects from its extension that, intuitively, do belong there,\nor both. As we saw above (section 2.2.1), this “problem of\nerror” is a problem for many naturalistic accounts of\nmeaning/content, but as such it does not yet have anything to do with\nnormativity. The normativist could, however, argue that it is\nprecisely because of their essential normativity that no naturalistic\naccount of meaning/content can be extensionally correct. The weaker\nargument grants extensional correctness, but argues that no\nnaturalistic reduction will get the intension of the notion of\nmeaning/content right; it will inevitably miss the normative character\nof what is semantically correct, its deontic or axiologic\ncharacteristics. \n\nEither way, these are at most argument templates; it seems fair to say\nthat at this point in time, the case from normativism against\nreductive naturalism about meaning/content has not yet been fully\nmade.  It has been suggested that the semantic normativist look to\nmetaethics at this point; arguments in the tradition of Hume and Moore\nmight well be adaptable to their case (cf. Miller 1998, 188ff;\nHattiangadi 2007, 38ff; Gibbard 2012; Zalabardo 2012). As Hattiangadi\nargues, the semantic normativist’s case might then prove hostage to\nwhatever controversial assumptions these arguments rely on\n(motivational internalism, for instance, might be such an issue), thus\nremoving normativism further from being the pre-theoretical constraint\non acceptable accounts of meaning/content that Kripke’s skeptic meant\nit to be. \n\nNormativism about meaning/content might thus exclude (fully) reductive\nnaturalism about meaning/content, but it should be noted that adopting\nnormativism would not seem to be the only option for the\nanti-reductivist (cf. Mulligan 1999, 136f; Glüer & Wikforss\n2009, 63ff). What the normativist construes as norms or rules of\nmeaning/content, principles such as (CM) or inferential rules such as\nmodus ponens, might also be construed in a very different way: As, or\nin analogy with what Frege called “laws of truth” (Frege\n1918: 30). In the same vein, Husserl called the ‘laws of\nlogic’ “ideal” (Husserl 1913: 56)). These\n‘laws’ are neither prescriptions for thinking, nor\nnomological generalities of our psychology. Their\n‘validity’ or necessity is sui generis; if\nanything, it is what we might today call\n metaphysical.[50]","contact.mail":"asa.wikforss@philosophy.su.se","contact.domain":"philosophy.su.se"}]
