His principal writings are: ‘Essay on Christian\nDogma’ (CD), ‘The Conversion of Paul’ (CP),\n‘Different Senses of “Freedom” as Applied to Will\nand the Moral Progress of Man’ (DSF), ‘Faith’ (F),\n‘Lecture on Liberal Legislation and Freedom of Contract’\n(LF), ‘Incarnation’ (I), ‘Immortality’ (IM),\n‘Justification by Faith’ (JF), ‘Lectures on the\nPrinciples of Political Obligation’ (LPPO), ‘Metaphysic of\nEthics, Moral Psychology, Sociology or the Science of\nSittlichkeit’ (ME), Prolegomena to Ethics (PE),\n‘Witness of God’ (WG), and ‘Word is Nigh Thee’\n(WNT). The full references are given in the Bibliography.\n\n\n\n\nThomas Hill Green was born on April 7, 1836 in Birkin, a tiny village\nin the West Riding of Yorkshire, where his father was rector.\nTogether with his sisters and three brothers, Thomas was brought up by\na nanny following the death of his mother when he was only a year old.\nHe attended Rugby School between 1850 and 1855, having received his\nearliest education from his father. Green was a lazy student, and\ngained few academic or sporting distinctions. His fellow students,\nincluding Henry Sidgwick, thought him serious, a character trait which\nshowed itself in his piety and earnest endorsement of philosophical\nidealism (see Sidgwick's recollection of Green, in Tyler ed 2008,\npp.5–17).  In later life, Sidgwick and Green were forthright in\npublished criticisms of each other's work.  Sidgwick sought to clarify\nhis own reaction in the recollection that he sent to Charlotte Green\nfollowing Green's death:  Green, for his part, was reported to have confided to his close\nfriend and later brother-in-law that “I can never think of him\nbut as the chubby pot-bellied little Rugby boy” (Symonds,\n1968–69, vol. 2, p.774). \n\nGreen went up to Balliol College, Oxford in 1855 where he came under\nthe influence of Benjamin Jowett. Jowett had been one of the first to\nbring a set of Hegel's writings to England, and it was through him\nthat, probably towards the end of his undergraduate years, Green\nbecame enraptured by idealism. It will become clear that Green's\nmature philosophical system has many affinities with the thought of\nFichte.  Yet, we do not know which idealists were having the greatest\ninfluences on Green at this time. Nettleship records that Green read\nFichte as a young man: “The writers from whom he seems at this\ntime to have assimilated the most were Wordsworth, Carlyle, Maurice,\nand probably Fichte in his lectures on the ‘nature’ and\n‘vocation’ of ‘the scholar’ and of\n‘man’” (Nettleship, p.xxv). (Nettleship records that\nGreen read more Fichte towards the end of his life, yet implies that\nGreen did not study him in depth at that time; see Nettleship,\npp.cxxv-cxxvi.) These influences helped Green to escape the baleful\ninfluence of the British empiricist tradition of George Berkeley, John\nLocke, David Hume and John Stuart Mill. He found particularly in\nHegelianism a justification for his instinctive egalitarianism, and\nbecame firm friends with other students who were sympathetic to his\npolitical radicalism, such as AV Dicey, John Nichol, and Edward\nCaird. Soon Green was a leading member of the Old Mortality Club, a\nradical university society founded by Nichol. Green's failure to apply\nhimself brought him a second class in Classical Moderations in 1857,\nafter which time he buckled down and earned a first in Literae\nHumaniores in 1859 followed by a respectable third in law and\nmodern history six months later. He was made a college fellow towards\nthe end of 1860, having lectured in ancient and modern history earlier\nin that year. His search for a career direction led him to act as an\nassistant commissioner with the Schools Inquiry Commission in 1865 and\n1866, after which time he returned to academic life at Balliol. His\nfirst significant article appeared in 1866. ‘The Philosophy of\nAristotle’ marked the beginning of a number of Hegelian\ncontributions to many philosophical issues, in such works as the\n‘Essay on Christian Dogma’ and ‘Popular Philosophy\nin Its Relation to Life’ (both of which were later published in\nthe third volume of his Works). Green took charge of Balliol\nHall where reasonably priced accommodation was provided for poor and\nmature students. His personal influence spread throughout the college\nat this time and he taught many undergraduates who later achieved\nfame, including Bernard Bosanquet, F. H. Bradley, R.  L. Nettleship\nand Henry Scott Holland. In 1871, he married Charlotte Byron Symonds,\nsister of his close friend John Addington Symonds. His famous\n‘Introductions to Hume's Treatise of Human\nNature’ appeared in 1874. In 1866 he has been appointed to\na Balliol tutorship and in 1878 he was made Whyte's Professor of Moral\nPhilosophy. \n\nGreen had been involved in local politics for many years, through the\nUniversity (not least in the campaign to gain access for women to\ndegree-awarding programmes), temperance societies and the local Oxford\nLiberal association.  During the passage of the Second Reform Act, he\ncampaigned for the franchise to be extended to all men living in\nboroughs (all sane urban adult males not currently serving a jail\nterm).  In this sense, Green's position was more radical than that of\nmost other Advanced Liberals, including W.E. Gladstone and even John\nBright (nevertheless, one of Green's heroes).  He was also more\nradical on this issue than John Stuart Mill (then Member of Parliament\nfor Westminster) in that Green did not advocate a property\nqaulification for the vote.  (Green lagged behind Mill on the question\nof votes for women though.) (See Tyler, 2006, chapter 3).) \n It was in the context of his Liberal party activities that in 1881\nGreen gave what became one of his most famous statements of his\nliberal philosophy, the ‘Lecture on Liberal Legislation and\nFreedom of Contract.’ At this time he was also lecturing on\nreligion, epistemology, ethics, and political philosophy.  Then, at\nthe height of his intellectual powers and academic career, Green died\nfrom blood poisoning on March 15, 1882. Most of his major works were\npublished posthumously, including his lay sermons on Faith\nand The Witness of God, the essay ‘On the Different\nSenses of “Freedom” as Applied to Will and the Moral\nProgress of Man’, Prolegomena to Ethics, Lectures\non the Principles of Political Obligation, and the ‘Lecture\non Liberal Legislation and Freedom of Contract’. In\naddition to Green's friends from his academic life, approximately two\nthousand local people attended his funeral. \n\nDevelopments in geology and evolutionary theory, as well as the\nimpact of Higher Criticism, led many mid-nineteenth century Christians\nto question the doctrinal authority of the Church of England, and the\nmoral views and allegiances which it was purported to justify. Green's\npupil, Henry Scott Holland wrote of this crisis of faith and the\neffects of Green's religious thought upon it. \n\nEven though Scott Holland and many others such as W. T. Davison saw\nhim as a potential saviour of England's religious life, Green was too\nopen to the unorthodox religious theories of such as Hegel, Strauss,\nBaur, and Lotze, to accept the dogma of the Church of England. In fact\nhis own religious beliefs were so unorthodox that many people\nquestioned the propriety of calling him a Christian at all. One of the\nmain factors which antagonised believers was the depth of Green's\nimmanentism (Lidgett, 1897, pp. 325–348). Hence, Green's friend, Mrs.\nHumphry Ward had to defend his position against sustained attacks from\nWilliam Gladstone who objected that “in proposing a substitute\nfor [Christianity], reached by reduction and negation, I think (forgive\nme) you are dreaming the most visionary of all human dreams”\n(quoted in Ward, p.xvi). Nettleship identified the key point: “To\nthe question which is sure to be asked by those who hear or read of\nGreen, Was he a christian? the answer must depend on what ‘to be\na christian’ means” (Nettleship, p.c). \n\nOne can begin to understand Green's mature religious thought via an\nexamination of his analysis of the history of Christian dogma. In his\nvery important Essay on Christian Dogma, Green characterised\nthe formulation of the creeds as an attempt to arrive at an\nauthoritative expression of those doctrines by which all Christians —\nirrespective of time and place — should judge the varying\ninterpretations of their faith (CD 162). Yet Green objected that in\nreality the creeds were not eternal truths, but devices employed by\nhumans to solve particular, historically contingent problems. More\nspecifically the creeds arose out of the need to convey the essence of\nChrist's teaching once the life of Jesus passed from living memory. No\nmatter how pure the motives of their authors, the creeds actually did\nmore to legitimate the teachings of subsequent religious leaders than\nthey did to convey the timeless message of Jesus (CD 162–3). \n\nThe formalisation of Jesus' teaching transformed Christianity from a\nfluid, developing, personal faith into a static theology authorised by\nan ecclesiastical elite. Originally, Christianity had been\n“penetrated to its object, as was then said, by revelation, as we\nshould say, by intuition, without the intervention of any system of\nideas” (CD 164). It had excluded theology — “a connected\nsystem of ideas, each qualified by the other, each serving as a middle\nterm by which the rest are held together” (CD 164). Yet the\nmaintenance of the unity of a theological system necessitated the\ndogmatic entrenchment of definite and authoritative interpretations of\nJesus' words. Such a shift altered fundamentally the Christian's\nunderstanding of his relationships to other believers, to the church,\nand to God. For example, Green observed in his lay sermon on\nFaith that “[t]he death and resurrection of Christ\n… became past events by which certain blessings had been\nobtained for us, or divine testimony given to an authority claiming our\nobedience” (F 257). In this way the creation of a theology caused\nChristians to tend to look to church doctrine for spiritual guidance,\nrather than looking to the inner voice of conscience. This helped\ntransform Christianity into a faith whose adherents saw themselves as\nconstrained to conceptualise their spirituality within a static\nframework of authorised concepts and beliefs. This ensured that God\ncould only ever be conceived as external to the individual's highest\nbeing, meaning that Christian truth could be held only in word\nand not in power. It is for this reason that Green believed\nthat “[d]ogmatic theology is quite other than the Christian\nlife” (WG 238). He developed this line by arguing that the\ntransformation of the individual's spiritual intuition into the dogma\nof the (human) church is akin to idolatry (F 257–60). In following\nchurch dogma, the individual turns to the worship of a hypostatised\nrepresentation of God, rather than to his actual, dynamic presence in\nthe world. \n\nThe contrast between sight and faith is a crucial facet of Green's\nreligious thought. Whereas “sight” denotes the acceptance\nof the divinity of Christ and the existence of God as a result of\nphysical evidence, “faith” can be characterised as belief\nin Christ and God without the need for earthly signs: “the true\nor highest faith [is] represented as that which by a purely spiritual\nact takes Christ, as the manifestation of God, into the soul without\nwaiting for conviction by sensible signs” (F 253). Those who look\nfor miraculous signs of God's presence before they will believe can\nonly ever conceive of them as “mere wonders, not a medium for the\nspirit that quickeneth” (F 255). Green regarded miracles as\nunintelligible in the orthodox sense given to the idea of a miracle (CP\n189). His position is essentially the same as St. Paul's. Whereas John\nwrites of miracles strengthening the belief of those who already\npossess faith, Paul argues that miracles are the creation of\nfaith, rather than its cause or support. Indeed, “If we knew God\nas we know anything else, if his nature had been revealed to us by\nmiraculous evidence of a kind with that which convinces us of matters\nof fact, then would faith be no more faith” (F 268). Paul's\nvision on the road to Damascus, for example, was only significant as a\nrevelation to his inward consciousness, and not to his senses (CD\n165–7). Or again, “The resurrection of Christ is to [the\nbeliever] not evidence of a revelation, but the thing revealed”\n(F 256). The same holds true for knowledge of God's word. Studying the\nScriptures does not add totally new elements to the individual's\nspiritual knowledge so much as it brings to his consciousness that\nwhich had been present to him inchoately (CD 161). \n\nNevertheless, reason remains an essential element in human salvation\neven though faith “is a primary formative principle” (F\n263). Thus, Green argues that “this rational self-consciousness\n… is an element of identity between us and a perfect being, who\nis in full realisation what we only are in principle and\npossibility” (F 267–8). When properly exercised reason brings the\nindividual to a more developed and compelling understanding of the\nspiritualised world. Furthermore, it brings the believer to a clearer\nrecognition of his own true nature. Consequently, the individual\nbecomes more aware of his reliance on God for his knowledge and\nexistence, and his love for God grows as a result. When concerned with\nmoral objects, reason speaks to man in the form of conscience. God's\nlaw is only truly found within conscience — that is, within the\nconscience of every human being. Conscience is the presence of\nGod within man and thereby in the world: “we may say that we are\nreason of his reason and spirit of his spirit” (WNT 221). Indeed,\nas the voice of the divine in man, the individual should use conscience\nto question church orthodoxy. \n\nThis brings us to one of the most controversial elements of Green's\nreligious thought: his christology. Green rejected the orthodox\nChristian belief that, in Nettleship's words, Jesus “was born and\ndied under conditions [which are] impossible to other human\nbeings” (Nettleship, p.c). Hence he attacked the Nicene council\nfor seeking to repress the idea that Jesus was born a normal human\nbeing. By denying this aspect of the Scriptures, “[t]he orthodox\nrepresentative of the Nicene council … is no longer conscious of\na kingdom of God within him. … Jesus of Nazareth was not divine\nfrom his birth, but had attained to that moral perfection in which by\nGod's pleasure the attributes of the Son and the worship due to the Son\nhad been transferred to him” (CD 173, 174). In an important sense\nthen, Jesus became Christ because of the temporal circumstances in\nwhich he was born and raised: “the Christian life, in its primary\n[i.e. earliest] exhibition, was perhaps only possible under the\npeculiar circumstances of Galilee during the Roman dominion” (CD\n184). \n\nHence, the central message of the Scriptures is that everyone has\nthe potential to become Christ through the possession of faith and the\nguidance of conscience as the voice of reason. The hope brought by\nJesus is explicable only when one appreciates that he was essentially\nhuman in the same way that we all are. Jesus realised the highest human\npotential: salvation through conscientious action. It is only now that\nwe can appreciate this truth, for, \n\nJesus continues to bring hope to us all precisely because he\nattained salvation without standing in a unique relation to the\nindwelling spirit of God (WNT). Judaism fails to offer hope in the same\nway that Christianity does because the Jew believes God's will to be\nexpressed as an externally sanctioned commandment. The difference\nbetween the immanent and ‘external’ conceptions of God\nbecomes particularly significant over time. The despair felt by the\nnon-Christian becomes increasingly acute as obedience to the law brings\nhim closer to God. It gives him a more immediate and intense sense of\nhis true nature, and consequently, of the implications of his imperfect\ncondition (WG 236). For the Jew, the believer's relationship with God\nis a confused and frightening one. Firstly, having an awareness of\nGod's law, he sees what he should not do. Secondly, the Jew sees the\ndivine law as being imposed by another being who yet does not give the\nnecessary “strength to obey in those to whom it is\npresented” (JF 203). Moreover, the Jew faces the mystery of why\nfollowing the law allows him to become divine with God (CP 187–8). The\ntrue Christian, on the other hand, has no such difficulty as he\nrecognises that God is eternally with him. Man's divinity is always\npresent to the true Christian as his own potential. Like Paul, he is\nreborn within and by his new consciousness of his inward, essential\nhuman relationship to God. For him, the paradox disappears. \n\nGreen explores this need to internalise God in the Justification\nby Faith. Man can only attain salvation when he intuitively acts\nin accordance with God's will, rather than following it as a\ncommandment given by another. Thus, Green writes that in Christ\n“[all] live in freedom, as having the mind of God for an inward\nprinciple, not an outward restraint” (JF 196). This intuition of\nChrist is the necessary awareness of the rebirth of the believer in\nChrist — “the spiritual act by which the individual appropriates,\nis ‘clothed upon by,’ the being of the Son of God, who is\nthe new man” (CD 166). This is the true meaning of salvation (CD\n170). \n\nThe true Christian consults his conscience in order to discover how\nbest to honour and know God as an indwelling spirit (CP 188).\nNevertheless, the human predicament is that man's ability to satisfy\nhis innate drive to make explicit the spiritual aspect of his\nexistence — which is the moral goal of his being — is\nconstantly hindered by the physicality of human life. As Green puts\nit, “the conditions of human existence in this world are such\nthat [the truly divine life] can never be completely attained”\n(I 216). This deficiency has a number of manifestations. First, in\nrelation to our epistemic self, man possesses an “infirmity of\n[his] … discursive understanding” (CP 145). Thus,\nalthough he comes to recognise new facts and new relations between\nfacts, from studying the world, inevitably the individual\n“loses” (or forgets) others.  Consequently, “we\nnever reach the totality of apprehension through which alone we could\nknow the world as it is and God in it” (CP 145). Second, every\nindividual is concerned to gain some level of temporal good while\nstill feeling the need for spiritual fulfilment. Consequently,\neveryone feels torn between gaining earthly pleasure and living as an\nembodiment of God in the temporal world. The former, the life of the\nflesh, arises from “the animal element in man, sense and\nappetite” (I 207). Yet his “senses and appetites”\nare transformed by this self-awareness, thereby enabling him to live\nthe life of the spirit. In being self-aware in this sense, the\nindividual necessarily becomes self-referential, both in terms of\nlooking to one's own interests at the expense of other people who are\nmore deserving, and in seeking earthly glory (WG 233). \n\nThe essence of salvation is found in the life of “the\nspirit.” True salvation is only found in the rejection of the\nneed for earthly recognition of one's temporal power and even one's\nspiritual purity on the one hand, and the realisation that one must\nlook to one's own relationship with God as the only thing of ultimate\nvalue on the other. This is the true meaning of Christ's message that\none must die in order to live. Indeed, Green's lack of concern with the\nexistence or otherwise of a life after one's physical death is itself\nrevealing (IM). \n\nEven though the search for earthly glory is a result of sinful\npride, Green does not believe that the true Christian should withdraw\nfrom society. In fact there are many reasons why he should do quite the\nreverse (WNT 223). The most significant of these arises from the fact\nthat faith “works from within [itself] outwards … [Faith\nis] revealed in one man, awakening an answer from the same spirit,\nhitherto silent, in another” (F 255). Thus, the spirit of the\nLord communicates with itself to bring faith into the world, through\ncommunication between believers. This represents “the\ncommunication of God to himself”, as Green puts it in The\nWitness of God (WG 241). \n\nIn short, the true believer should test for himself his own beliefs\nagainst the beliefs of the fellow members of his spiritual community.\nIt is in this fraternal clash of consciences that God's word becomes\nclearer in the mind of men. Green's characterisation of this Christian\ncommunity is transformed into the social theory outlined below. \n\nIt should be clear by now that Nettleship was correct to ask in what\nsense Green was a Christian. Green rejects the authority of the creeds\nand questions the usefulness of miracles, he humanises the notion of\nimmortality and radically reinterprets the core article of orthodox\nfaith: the unique divinity of Jesus Christ. Yet, there is one area of\nGreen's religious thought that has not been touched on in any real\ndepth yet: his conception of God, or in his terms “the eternal\nconsciousness.” This is one of the most important and\ncontroversial aspects of both his religious thought and his\nphilosophical system. Indeed we shall see in the next section that this\nnotion marks the transition from religion to philosophy. \n\nOver the years, scholars have disagreed significantly about the\nrelation of Green's religious thought to his wider philosophical\nposition.  Some of the obscurity has resulted from the lack of a\nsustained discussion of the relation of substantive religious issues\nto substantive philosophical ones (as opposed to the more abstract\nmethodological discussions about the relations between these two modes\nof experience). Fortunately, this lacunae has been addressed to some\ndegree by the recent publication of a series of Green's lecture notes\nfrom the late 1860s and early 1870s.  (It appears under the title of\n“Metaphysic of Ethic, Moral Psychology and Sociology or the\nScience of Sittlichkeit” (ME).) Together, these lectures\nconstitute an early version of Green's greatest philosophical\nwork, Prolegomena to Ethics (1883).  In these earlier\nlectures, Green develops a theory of the creation of ethical subjects\nand objects, before turning to issues of motivation and\nresponsibility, freedom, duty, the moral development of the will, the\ndeficiencies of the leading eighteenth century British ethical\ntheories, and finally the universality of the moral law.  Throughout\nhis lectures of individual will and Sittlichkeit, Green returns to the\nquestion of the relation of God to the moral world.  To this extent,\nhe anticipates his mature writings, where he often equates the\nactualisation of ‘the eternal consciousness’ with both the\nunfolding of the individual's will, and the actualisation of the\nChristian God in the world. Turning now to this mature position,\ntypically, he refers to the eternal consciousness as “the law of\nnature or the will of God or its ‘idea’” (DSF 17),\nor “freedom in the conscious union with God, or harmony with the\ntrue law of one's being … freedom in devotion to self-imposed\nduties” (DSF 17). He argues that what changes when one moves\nbetween these different phrases are “the words, but not the\nmeaning” (DSF 17). The unfolding of the eternal consciousness is\nthe increasing manifestation of God in the world. That is, the growing\nunity of men's will and reason with the will and reason of God. Green\nargues in his lay sermon on\nFaith that although that ultimate reality of God never\nchanges, society is “always keeping before man in various\nguises, according to the degree of his development, an (unrealised)\nideal of a best which is his God, and giving divine authority to the\ncustoms and laws by which some likeness of this ideal is wrought into\nthe actuality of life” (F 269–70). In this sense, “The\nnotions of God, of duty of an ideal life have been constantly\nshifting. They have developed” (F 271). Thus, through his\nsociety the individual tends to reach an increasingly clear and\nsophisticated recognition of what is ultimately true and good (PE\n319). The imperatives of divine reason are communicated to the\nindividual through the assimilation and reformulation of the\naccumulated social wisdom by individual conscience (PE 318) (see the\nprevious section). In this way, God's earthly presence increases. \n\nThe thrust of Green's immanentism was clearly heretical in his day,\nand this heresy underlies many of his arguments regarding the nature\nand dynamics of the eternal consciousness. It appears that God has no\nexistence that is both complete in itself and independent of the\nindividual (except as the abstract idea of an unrealised potential).\nHence, Green argues that “the true lesson which [the Bible]\nteaches is that God is not to be sought in nature, nor in any beginning\nor end of nature, but in man himself” (F 265). “God's\nfulfilment of himself”(F 265) is then the growing explicitness of\nthe eternal consciousness in the life of man — a growth which is\nself-generating. Thus, Green argues that for God to truly exist He must\nbe actualised in this world. To the extent that individuals fail to be\nconscious of His nature and fail to act on that consciousness in their\nown lives, God does not properly exist. Hence not only is man dependent\nupon God, but God is dependent on man (F 271–2). This implies that in\nworshipping God, the individual is of necessity worshipping the best\nparts of himself (in their potential, developing and realised\nforms). \n\nThe spark of the eternal consciousness in every individual (that\naspect of the individual which is God) drives its manifestation in the\nindividual's consciousness and praxis. Remembering Hegel's contention\nthat “what is rational is actual, what is actual is\nrational,” this manifestation represents an increasing\nrationalisation and actualisation of God and the individual. As Olive\nAnderson puts it, “Green's constant aim was the separation of the\nspiritual and the supernatural … God must be sought in each\nperson's soul, and would be found through the life of Christian\nlove” (Anderson, 1991, 685). \n\nIt is beyond reasonable dispute that Green honestly felt his own\nreligious writings to contain a more accurate statement of the true\nChristian message than that found in the various theological systems of\northodox forms of Christianity. Yet the thrust of his argument is\nsufficiently radical to make one question whether or not he retained a\nserious belief in the existence of the omniscient, omnipotent supreme\nbeing such as stands at the heart of these more traditional forms. Even\nso, many commentators have claimed that the depth and sophistication of\nGreen's religious faith prevents his philosophy from being available to\natheists. There are good reasons for rejecting this claim. Green makes\nclear that although religious inspiration can uncover certain truths\nabout the nature of the individual, as well as the latter's ethics and\nrelationships to other persons (all aspects of Green's mature\nphilosophical system), a radical distinction remains between the\nanalysis of religious intuition on the one hand and the justification\nof philosophical truths on the other. \n\nNot only does the philosopher operate according to different criteria\nof meaning and truth than the religious believer, but the\nphilosopher's analysis and critique has precedence over religious\nintuition, in the sense that ultimately specific religious intuitions\nhave validity only if they can be restated in philosophical terms and\nthen justified on purely philosophical grounds. This claim informs\nGreen's own exposition and defence of the eternal consciousness in the\nfirst book of his major philosophical work, Prolegomena to\nEthics (1883). Often this book is taken as setting out an\nepistemological or metaphysical theory. Yet it is better read as a\ntranscendental deduction of the nature of consciousness\n(cf. ‘Kant’, e.g. 9–27, 70–84). Read in this way, the\nfirst book of the Prolegomena can avoid the endlessly\ndisputed question of the ontological status of the objects that appear\nto play a necessary role in the origination of sense data in the human\nmind. This explains why even though Green stated explicitly that it is\nridiculous to doubt the existence of a mind-independent world, he did\nnot waste time attempting to prove or analyse the nature of its\nexistence. The latter task was irrelevant to his proof of the\nexistence of the eternal consciousness.  Nevertheless we should not go\nthe extreme of holding that Green thought of the eternal consciousness\nas a mere presupposition of thought, a postulate to complete our\nworld-view and make it internally consistent (Dimova Cookson, 2002,\nchapter 1). In reality Green did not bracket off the question of the\nontological status of the eternal consciousness.  His religious\nthought and his conception of its relationship to the philosophy\nstrongly suggests that he believed the eternal consciousness did exist\nwithin every human being, whether or not its existence was recognised\nand irrespective of the apparent logic of the particular individual's\nparticular life-world. \n\nSo, how does Green justify his philosophical claim that every human\nbeing is to some degree a partial manifestation of the eternal\nconsciousness? He begins from the assertion that the mind of the\nindividual experiences sensations. This particular mind examines,\ncategorises and then groups these sensations in accordance with the\nqualities which it perceives them to share with its other perceived\nsensations. It conceives of these sensations within a framework of\nother categories and relations such as time and space. In this way the\nindividual mind understands these sensations to demonstrate the\npresence of a particular object in a particular temporal and spatial\nlocation. This object is in Green's sense a creation of the perceiving\nmind (irrespective of whether or not the initial sensations were\ncaused by, say, a mind-independent lump of matter). Following his\ngreat mentor Immanuel Kant, Green notes that the most basic categories\nemployed by the perceiver cannot be derived from experience because\nthey are the preconditions of there being any experiences at all. The\nbasic laws underlying the ways in which these basic categories can be\nrelated cannot be derived from experience for precisely the same\nreason.  Complex categories and relations on the other hand —\nsuch as ‘gothic arch’ — are constructed by the mind\nfrom these basic categories and laws of relation. In short again like\nKant, Green believes that the individual attempts to discover\n“an objective world, … [by which] is meant a world of\nascertainable laws, as distinguished from a world of unknowable\n‘things-in-themselves’” (PE 38). Green calls this\nworld ‘nature’. \n\nNotice that from Green's perspective every relation must be mental\nbecause he is concerned only with the logical structure of the\nindividual's ability to categorise and relate sensations that are\nperceived by his own mind and to draw implications from these\nperceptions. He goes on to argue that individuals feel a natural drive\nto understand their perceived world as being underlain by a system of\ncategories and relations that is complete and internally harmonious. He\ncalls this system ‘the eternal consciousness’. It is\n‘eternal’ in the rather unusual sense that it is the\nprecondition of temporal experiences, and it is a consciousness in the\nsense that it concerns only mental entities. This is Green's reason for\nholding it to be an “irrefragable truth involved in the [Kantian]\nproposition that ‘the understanding makes nature’”\nthat, \n\nEven more strongly, Green argues a little later that, “[a]part\nfrom the unifying principle the manifold world would be nothing at\nall” (PE 75). \n\nPossession of a partially explicit spark of the eternal consciousness\nis a prerequisite for the acquisition of any knowledge.  Green\ntheorises the progressive element of experience (involving the\nconstruction of complex mental objects) claiming that as more\nsensations are experienced the individual comes to recognise that the\nsystem of categories and relations ‘comprehended’ by the\neternal consciousness (‘nature’) is a unified entity. The\ntelos of every human is to know this system, yet this realisation can\nonly be achieved through the progressive development of humanity as a\nspecies of intelligent, self-conscious beings. The individual needs\nother persons to provide a basis — an inheritance of knowledge\n— from which to build as well as to provide a social setting in\nwhich there can be a rational division of labour and fruitful exchange\nof ideas when the scope of knowledge becomes significantly\ncomplex. The need for others to help us to foster the development of\nthe eternal consciousness within each of us as individuals is one\nconsequence of the fact that as individuals we are “a certain\nreproduction of itself on the part of the eternal self-conscious\nsubject of the world — a reproduction of itself to which it makes the\nprocesses of animal life organic, and which is qualified and limited\nby the nature of the nature of those processes” (PE 99). Another\nconsequence is that the concrete beliefs which we hold will depend to\na large degree on the experiences we have and the bodies of knowledge\ninto which we are born.  Nevertheless, the eternal consciousness is\nalways the ultimate critical principle that tests the adequacy of\nthese concrete beliefs.  Interpreted in this way, the eternal\nconsciousness is a heuristic ideal which must be posited by every\nindividual rational being who holds itself to be able to possess\nknowledge (rather than merely having beliefs). Its existence is, in\nthis sense, a logical presupposition of our respective individual\nconvictions that individually we can know things. Green holds that\nevery rational being is driven to give content to this ideal.  This\nhas two striking consequences.  Firstly, the eternal consciousness a\nconstruction of individual consciousnesses.  As Green writes in\nsection 149 of the Prolegomena to Ethics: “we only find unity in\nthe world because we have an idea that it is there, an idea which we\ndirect our powers to realise.” Secondly, this means the\njustification of the existence of the eternal consciousness relies\nlogically on positing the presupposition the existence of individual\nconsciousnesses.  Consequently, it is logically incoherent to deny the\nexistence of discrete individual consciousnesses while affirming the\nexistence of an eternal consciousness.  In other words, our individual\nconsciousnesses are not mere adjuncts of a single eternal\nconsciousness.  (This interpretation is defended at length in Tyler,\n2010, especially chapter 4).  \n\nGreen extends the world of the eternal consciousness to encompass\nthe world of values as well as the world of facts. One must examine his\ntheory of the will to understand how he achieves this. \n\nThis section examines the ways in which the eternal consciousness\ndevelops through the minds of individuals and the institutions of\nsociety. It begins by examining Green's conceptions of freedom, the\nwill and reason. It then sketches his theory of man's essential\nreliance on society, and the latter's possibilities for interpreting\nsocial forms at a higher level. The interlinking of social norms and\nlaws, individual freedom, and morality is a recurring theme of this\ndiscussion. \n\nTo understand Green's position on morality, one must first\nunderstand his analysis of the human will, for in many ways the most\nfundamental question is “what makes the will free?” This\nquestion can restated by asking, “what is the difference between\nthe good and bad will?”, because Green sees the truly\nfree will as being by definition the truly good will\n(PE 154). \n\nGreen argues that desires are emotional impulses felt by the\nindividual and recognised by him as forming an indispensable part of\nhis being. In desiring, one is necessarily acknowledging one's own\nexistence as a person, as one is necessarily self-conscious. Usually,\nindividuals will desire many objects at the same time. Often, holding\nthem simultaneously is impossible, and so one is forced to decide which\nobject to actively attempt to possess; that is, one will have to choose\nwhich object to will to possess. In this way, choice\nrepresents the adoption of a motive by the self as the determination of\naction — that is, as the will (PE 103). For example, I may desire to\nown a book and a statue. However, as I can afford one but not both (and\nbuying them is the only way to gain either), I must choose between\nthem. In choosing, say, the statue, it then becomes my will to possess\nthe statue — it is no longer merely a desire. My motivation is one on\nits own — whereas my desire can be one of many. In willing, firstly\none must desire (and by desiring acknowledge one's existence).\nSecondly, one must make the object part of oneself because, in the act\nof willing, one necessarily makes the chosen object impossible to\nunderstand without reference to one's act of choice. In Green's\nterminology, the nature of the object is in part created by the\nindividual's will to possess it. As he writes, such objects are\n“objects which only the intercourse of self-conscious agents can\nbring into existence” (PE 126). For this reason, my relationship\nto (and hence the nature of) the object is transformed by my choice of\nit; it is transformed by my act of willing, because obtaining the\nwilled object is then the source of my self-satisfaction (PE 154). \n\nTo understand what Green means here, one must bear in mind that he\nis talking not in metaphysical, but in epistemic terms. This argument\nechoes his claim that nature's ‘creation’ is an epistemic\nprocess, not a metaphysical one. Green uses terms such as\n‘creation’, ‘nature’ and ‘reality’\nin very different ways to their common usages. Hence, ‘the\nworld’ and ‘nature’ are the ‘creation’ of\nthe human mind. They exist only in the consciousness of the\nindividual perceiver. This contention becomes relatively\nuncontroversial when the way in which Green uses his terms is\nunderstood. In this instance he is arguing that one cannot know what\nthe chosen object is without recognising that possession of it is\nwilled by a person. \n\nGreen argues that a man's will must always be free in at least one\nsense: “since in all willing a man is his own object to himself,\nthe object by which the act is determined, the will is always free\n… [that is] willing constitutes freedom” (DSF 1).\nSelf-satisfaction is always free and is always the object of the will.\nThere are several things to notice here. Firstly, in willing something,\nthe individual must deliberate. When willing, the individual is\n“seeking to realise an idea of his own good which he is conscious\nof presenting to himself” (PE 106). Action which occurs without\ndeliberation — unthinking action — is not an act of will and hence is\nnot free. Secondly, Green argues that the “motive” for the\ndetermination of the will is part of the will itself. For this reason,\nit is wrong to ask whether a man is “being himself” when he\nis willing a particular course of action; for example, taking drugs for\nthe first time. Thus, “in being determined by a strongest motive,\nin the only sense in which he is really so determined, the man …\nis determined by himself — by an object of his own making” (DSF\n11). \n\nThis argument can be extended. For Green, desires are not something\nexternal to and acting on the individual — they are part of his\nvery essence. For example, Green warns against talking “of\nDesire moving us to act in such or such a way, misleading us, or\novercoming us, conflicting with Reason, &c. — then\n‘Desire’ is a logical abstraction which we are mistaking\nfor reality” (PE 129). By “Desire” (as opposed to\n“desires”) here, Green means “the man's self, as\nconscious of itself and consciously seeking in the satisfaction of\ndesires the satisfaction of itself” (PE 129). Desire is then\nunified in the self by its relation to intellect which ensures that no\nobject of understanding would be what it is without the presence of\nDesire, and vice versa (PE: 130). In that these elements of the\nself are unified, the will is always in a sense free. \n\nYet, Green also claims that, “[t]he question as to the freedom\nof the will we take to be a question as to the origin of [one's]\n… strongest motive” (PE 97). Bearing in mind that Green\nhas already said that “willing constitutes freedom”, this\nstatement seems prblematic. He appears to be arguing that to will is to\nbe free at the same time as arguing that the will is not always free.\nIn other words, Green seems to be arguing simultaneously that the will\nmust be and may not be free. However, the important point to grasp here\nis that up until this point Green's statements had been concerned only\nwith one sense of the term “freedom”. That the will\noriginates in the strongest motive (self-satisfaction), and that this\nin turn originates in the person's “circumstances and\ncharacter” has radical implications (PE 98). Examining the\ninability of one's character to determine the individual's will\nsufficiently for an action to be ‘truly’ free helps to\nexplain why “circumstances” (as Green uses the term) are so\nimportant to the exercise of a completely free will. Circumstances and\ncharacter determine acts of will by giving the individual his specific\nmotivations and by giving his motivations their relative strengths. \n\nBy “circumstances”, Green does not mean merely the\nimmediate situation in which the individual makes his particular\ndecision, together with its antecedent causes. He means in addition\n“the state of [the individual's] health, the outward manner of\nhis life (including his family arrangements and the mode in which he\nmaintains himself and his family), and the standard of social\nexpectations on the part of those whom he recognises as his\nequals” (PE 98). The individual's self-satisfaction is determined\nby his circumstances. Thus, circumstances are necessarily formative of\nhis particular free will. At the same time, human reason shapes these\ncircumstances so as to foster the increasingly explicit embodiment of\nthe external consciousness in the world. It may seem strange that Green\nis arguing that the individual's will (which is, by definition,\nfree) is determined at least in part by things which appear to\nbe external to him. However, the influence of circumstances is an\nessential part of man. Without influences such as his family structure\nand social expectations (and hence customs and society's values), the\nindividual would have to create his own character from pure thought,\nwhich he cannot do. This claim needs to be examined in greater\ndepth. \n\nBy “character”, Green means the eternal consciousness'\nat least partial “reproduction of itself” (PE 99) within a\nparticular person. (The complex question of deciding in more detail\nwhat the eternal consciousness is is discussed later.) By\nvirtue of this reproduction, the individual is, and recognises himself\nas being, a moral agent — as an agent who is able to act deliberately\nin ways that are either praiseworthy or blameworthy. Willing involves\nchoice, and so Green argues reason is central to freedom, for it is by\nemploying one's rationality that an agent makes choices. Green holds\nthat “by reason, in the practical sense, [is meant] the capacity\non the part of [the individual] to conceive of a better state of\n[himself] as an end to be attained by action” (PE 177). Reason\nand will are then connected in such a way as to allow the individual to\nseek to attain an “ideal”, understood as a state of affairs\nwhich the individual prefers to his present situation. For example,\nreason allows me to conceive of my present state as being improved by\ndeveloping my painting talents. More than this however, Green holds\nthat man's reason is in an underdeveloped state to the extent that it\nfails to recognise man's absolute goal as the attainment of that set of\ncircumstances and character which accords with the ultimate harmony of\nthe world; that which obtains when the eternal consciousness is fully\nexplicit in the world. Moreover, the individual's will is only truly\nfree when reason draws man to chose that state which is absolutely\npreferable in this way. This means that when the eternal consciousness\nis not fully explicit in the world, reason and will do not\nnecessarily recognise the same end as good. In other words,\nwhen the eternal consciousness is merely becoming,\n“[this] self-realising principle, … in the form which it\ntakes as will[,] at best only tends to reconciliation with itself in\nthe form which it takes as reason” (DSF 21). What does this\nrather obscure proposition actually mean? \n\nThe unimpeded action of the eternal consciousness via the\nindividual's free exercise of reason is a prerequisite for the action\nof his absolutely free will. The degree to which the eternal\nconsciousness is merely implicit in the individual's actions determines\nthe degree to which the individual is capable of exercising free will.\nIn other words, a human's will is not free if the objects willed are\ncounter to “the law of his being” (DSF 1). He is free to\nthe extent that he wills his embodiment of the eternal\nconsciousness. \n\nIn more specific terms, that which is ultimately (and hence truly)\nsought by the moral agent is the full realisation of his “moral\ncapabilities” (PE 172). This is his “permanent good”\n(DSF 5). Unfortunately, as these moral capabilities are at present only\npartially realised, man cannot fully understand what they are. They can\nonly be known “in negative” even at the civilised\nindividual's current stage of development (PE 172). By this, Green\nmeans that even though one cannot know which state is absolutely the\nbest for man, in practice, one will usually be able to recognise which\nof two options is better. \n\nYet, while reason remains underdeveloped, human judgement remains\nimperfect. One result of this is that the eternal consciousness itself\ncan be the source of both virtue and vice (PE 176). It is the source of\nvice when it pushes the individual to be self-seeking in a\ncounter-productive way, such as when he wills the attainment of\n“pleasure-in-itself” as their ultimate end. Importantly,\nGreen argues that as reason develops, the individual will come to\nrecognise that there is an associated growth of “institutions and\nhabits which tend to make the welfare of all the welfare of each”\n(PE 172). In this way, the development of reason in the world makes the\nrole and importance of “circumstances” in the determination\nof the individual's will more obvious. The individual's capacities need\nto be given content so that they can be realised, thereby making him\ntruly satisfied and complete as a person. \n\nThis process of self-realisation occurs only for and within\nindividuals.  Yet, it is not driven consciously by individuals.  In\nother words initially at least it is not the result of their own\nconscious choice.  The individual develops by sublimating desires and\ninstincts that initially he merely feels as emanations from his\nunconscious (Tyler 2010, chapter 5). \n\nIt is helpful to summarise the argument to this point. The\ndistinguishing characteristic of the truly free will is found in the\nobject towards which it is directed (PE 155). That object which is\n“best” will be “the end in which the effort of a\nmoral agent can really find rest” (PE 171). It is in attaining\nthis object (strictly, “state”) that the individual gains\nthe greatest self-satisfaction. In this sense the attainment of this\nobject is what the individual truly wills (PE 172). For this reason,\nself-satisfaction should not be confused with satisfying one's\nstrongest desire. Indeed, once the individual has reached a certain\nstage of development, the strongest desire cannot be followed if it is\ncounter to a man's character — “his strength of character\novercomes the strength of desire” (PE 105). The motive (which\ndetermines the will) is not a desire in this case; the former is the\nhabitual determination for that which the individual regards as his\npermanent good. The latter, when destructive, “is incompatible\nwith [the individual's] steady direction of himself towards certain\nobjects in which he habitually seeks satisfaction” (PE 105).\nConsequently, it is incompatible with his true freedom, even though at\none level it may be part of the individual's will. \n\nGreen holds that the individual's application of moral rules is\nitself a form of moral education. In many ways, therefore, each new\nexperience tends to push men forward, which entails in turn an at least\npartial development of social institutions. This development shapes the\nways in which the individual experiences the world. Thus, in the case\nof law the individual should find himself faced by an external\nexpression of his true will. By following such a law, one is following\none's own will, for the abstract nature of law reflects, firstly, the\nabstract idea of man as a “self-conscious and self-realising\nsubject” whose wayward tendencies (desires which do not push him\nto realise his telos) must be restrained to enable the will's\n“attainment of its own perfection” (DSF 21). When following\nthe law then, the individual acknowledges his ability to become that\nwhich he is not at present. Secondly, law helps to form the individual\nin the sense of reinforcing his values, views and the actions of the\neternal consciousness as it exists in his world at the time. In this\nway, the individual is increasingly brought into line with “the\nlaw of his being” (DSF 22). \n\nThis is the ideal. In reality, the currently existing laws (and the\nunderlying social institutions, values and so on) are imperfect in that\ntheir presuppositions contradict the logical structure of the eternal\nconsciousness. Recognition of these imperfections awakens an innate\ndrive in the individual to correct them. In fact actualising the idea\nof perfection found in reason increasingly becomes the source of\nself-satisfaction contained in the individual's will (DSF 23). \n\nHowever, Green argues that without recognition of a common good\nunderlying your relations with your fellow citizens, there could not\nbe “intelligent co-operating subjects of law and custom”\n(PE 203). Only where such a common good is present will a society hold\ntogether without the use of coercion (PE 202). There are two connected\nelements here. Firstly, the individual's reason allows him to conceive\nof a good towards which he should work as a person. Secondly, Green\nholds that a stable society can only rest on institutions which are\nbased on a conception of a common good. As Aristotle writes that\n“it is a characteristic of man that he alone has any sense of\ngood or evil, of just and unjust, and the like, and the association of\nliving beings who have this sense makes a family and a state”\n(Politics, 1253a15–18). In fact the development of a\nperson's practical morality requires him to recognise through his\nexercise of reason that he should pursue certain ends because they\nserve the common good of his society. The individual comes to realise\nthat no purely private object he wills and attains can ever make him\ntruly happy. It becomes more obvious to him as he lives and wills that\nonly attaining what is good for all will bring him complete\nsatisfaction. This very significant contention needs to be\nexplained. \n\nGreen argues that it is important to recognise that the individual's\nultimate good is only fully actualised following the movement of his\nsociety through the “lesser” ends embedded in different\nearlier imperfect societies. These various ends serve to determine the\ngoals of the individual members of the various societies. However, the\nultimate goal of individuals as human beings is to become totally\nrational, that is to perfectly embody the eternal consciousness.\nCrucially, this realisation requires the individual to possess a sense\nof self-worth, and recognise and understand what is of ultimate value\nwithin their society. In this way, the individual should come to\npossess “an idea of an absolute good, common to him with [all\nother members of society] — an idea indefinable indeed in imagination,\nbut gradually defining itself in act” (PE 202). This good exists\nin a sense independently of any particular impulse and is founded on\nthe absolute nature of man. As Kant expresses part of the idea Green\nnow reiterates, individuals come to recognise a “much more worthy\npurpose of existence [than private pleasure] … to which …\nas a supreme condition the private purposes of man must for the most\npart be subordinated” (G 64). For Green, this object will be\nsought because “its desirableness … is a fulfilment of the\ncapacities of which a man is conscious in being conscious of\nhimself” (PE 193). Thus, the good act will be performed because\nit brings the individual to a greater awareness of himself and his\nnature, and hence to a greater awareness of what it is that best serves\nhis most permanent interests as an embodiment of the eternal\nconsciousness. That object is truly good, therefore, which is internal\nto the individual, and which the individual seeks as a fully\nself-conscious person. Green contends that this good is pursued because\nit affirms man to himself as a rational, self-satisfiable human being\n(PE 279). \n\nWhat is the nature of such a “good for all”?\nUnfortunately, no one can truly answer this question until the good\nlife has been fully actualised. Until then, the life aimed at the\nperfection of one's personality must be sought. Hence, Nicholson\nargues that “Green … centres his moral philosophy not on\na system of all-encompassing substantive principles from which one can\ndeduce the acts which ought to be done, but on a type of character in\nmoral agents” (Nicholson, 1990, p.78). This type of character is\nbased on conscience in its truest sense that is, conscientious\njudgement which has not been perverted by short-sighted self-interest\n(PE 293).  It is in this move that the individual's liberty becomes an\nessential element of moral progress. \n\nThe type of character that Green wishes to promote is based on the\nindividual's rational but personal evaluation of moral situations,\nsocial norms and laws. The agent must question his motives —\nself-reflection is essential for a pure conscience. Such a conscience\nrequires the moral agent to pursue that course of action which he truly\nbelieves will most fully promote the embodiment of the eternal\nconsciousness in human life. Such self-examination should be rooted in\na real desire to act virtuously, not in self-seeking self-deception (PE\n297). \n\nConscience operates by studying existing social conventions, and\nabstracting that which is permanent in them from that which is\ncontingent and transient. But how does one recognise what is permanent\nand what is not? Green argues that usually this can be done accurately\nby the individual to the extent that he embodies the eternal\nconsciousness. The eternal consciousness shows men what are necessary\nparts of the moral ideal (PE 279). The degree to which the eternal\nconsciousness is already explicit in the mind of the conscientious\ncitizen determines the degree to which he is able to recognise the\ntrue permanency or transitoriness of specific customs and\ninstitutions.  Moreover it determines the extent to which the ideal\ncan be approached from its present basis given a limited life\nspan. (By this logic, therefore, the closer one is to the ideal the\nfaster one moves towards it.) \n\nBut is man's understanding of the eternal consciousness so vague\nthat Green's theory is useless as a practical guide to individuals?\nNicholson notes commentators' frequent accusations of vagueness, but\nargues such accusations are often based on misunderstandings of Green's\nthought (Nicholson, 1990, pp.71–80). This is something I wish to\nexamine now. \n\nThe true reformer seeks to actualise that state of affairs which he\nhonestly feels to be an improvement on the current state of the world.\nHe acts from a personal motive, which is a natural outgrowth\nof his possession of the eternal consciousness. As Green writes\n“he feels a personal responsibility for realising … [that\nwhich] is part and parcel of the practical idea itself, of the form of\nconsciousness which we so describe” (PE 299). Thus, in most\ncases the truly contentious man knows instinctively which rules and\npractices to follow in society and which to seek to change, because of\nthe partially developed eternal consciousness within himself (PE\n308). Just as the initial progress of man requires the spark of the\neternal consciousness, so the good man's actions grow out of the\nself-realising principle embodied in his nature (his character) and\nhis social background (his circumstances). \n\nThe accusation may be made that this merely gives each individual\nlicense to act as they happen to prefer at the time. Yet, Green need\nnot be drawn to this conclusion. As has been said, the eternal\nconsciousness is alive in everyone as a voice of guidance (although\nmuffled to varying degrees depending on the individual). Also, it is\npresent although imperfectly in the social institutions which make up\nsociety. The fact that the individual may resist the conclusions of his\nmoral sense, and so may follow his short-sighted\n“self-serving” egoism is an important point, but\nit is not an objection to Green's theory unless it is also an objection\nto nearly every other ethical theory as well. Indeed, Green argues that\nas humanity progresses individuals will naturally come to truly follow\ntheir consciences more easily (PE 328). \n\nNevertheless, the criticism of vagueness may persist. The argument\nthat the eternal consciousness is imperfect in everyone, but more\ndeveloped in some, has important consequences for such criticisms.\nFirstly, there will be some people who are able to “in a certain\nsense … [transcend] ‘the law of opinion’ of social\nexpectation, … [but they] only [do] so by interpreting it\naccording to its higher spirit” (PE 301). It is in this way that\nnew duties come to be recognised in the world and man progresses (PE\n301). These individuals are saints and reformers. Yet, depending on the\npast effects of the eternal consciousness on the mind of the\nindividual, different interpretations of this higher spirit will be\nmade by each particular reformer: “It speaks with different\nvoices” (PE 301). However, every interpretation when made by a\ncontentious individual tends to uncover aspects of the underlying\nrationality of these “social opinions”. Here Green echoes\nMill's contention that, “[i]n proportion to the development of\nhis individuality, each person becomes more valuable to himself, and is\ntherefore capable of being more valuable to others” (Mill, 1972\n131). \n\nSecondly, when living “their” good life most people will\nmerely follow the accepted social norms, feeling unable to find fault\nwith or improve upon them. The reformer and the saint are the\nexceptions in society. Hence, Green writes that “[i]n fulfilling\nthe duties which would be recognised as belonging to his station in\nlife by any one who considered the matter dispassionately … we\ncan seldom go wrong and when we have done this fully, there will seldom\nbe much more that we can do” (PE 313). On the rare occasions that\nthe individual suffers a “perplexity of conscience”, the\ndifficulties can be traced either to differing conceptions of the man's\ntelos, or differing ideas of the best means of actualising the\nindividual's socially endorsed telos (PE 314). \n\nYet, it is still the case that people frequently expect too much. To\nreiterate, “Moral philosophy as [Green] conceives it can take one\nonly so far: it cannot resolve every moral issue and practical\ndilemma” (Nicholson, 1990, p.79). As the eternal consciousness is\nvariously manifested in people, philosophy can provide no general rules\nfor guidance except that one should examine one's motives carefully in\neach particular instance. The ultimate goal must be the actualisation\nof one's conception of the moral end of man (PE 316). The individual's\nrules of conduct are then in a sense present within himself. \n\nIt is in this way that for Green, “[t]here is no such thing as\na conflict of duties” (PE 324). Given more than one possible\ncourse of action, the problem is in deciding which course of action it\nis truly one's duty to follow, and this problem is often one of\nchoosing between inconsistent “injunctions given by external\nauthorities” (PE 324). In a sense, the philosopher's task is to\nallow the individual to decide which “authority” is false\nand therefore external, and which is good and therefore internal, in\nthat it best serves the unfolding of the eternal consciousness (PE\n325). The philosopher performs this function by making the individual\naware of the ends served by the norms, customs, institutions and laws\nof his society (PE 326), and by helping him recognise that,\n“[r]ules are made for man, not man for rules” (PE 316).\nNevertheless, the philosopher must not merely attempt to knock down\nexisting institutions and replace them with “an improvised\n[purely personal] conscience” which sets up the individual as the\nonly practical source of law (PE 326). We should not forget that the\nindividual must have a society if he is to have a conscience at all (PE\n327). “No individual can make a conscience for himself. He always\nneeds a society to make it for him” (PE 321). Thus, in many ways,\nthe philosopher's task is to promote understanding and rational harmony\nin society by allowing individuals to come to their own recognition of\nthe rationality which is inherent in themselves and their society (PE\n327/8). They should encourage personal liberty, rather than personal\nlicense. \n\nYet there remains a fundamental tension between individual freedom\nand the necessity for political structures which must be faced by any\nphilosophical doctrine. It is to Green's statement of this problem and\nhis proposed solution to it that we should turn now. \n\nGreen holds that the state should foster and protect the social,\npolitical and economic environments in which individuals will have the\nbest chance of acting according to their consciences. Notice that in\nprinciple Green is not concerned to allow all actions, no matter what\ntheir origin. He himself was a temperance reform for example, and\nstated time and again that the state could legitimately curtail the\nindividual's freedom to accept the slavery of alcoholism (LFC). Yet,\nthe state must be careful when deciding which liberties to curtail and\nin which ways to curtail them. Over-enthusiastic or clumsy state\nintervention could easily close down opportunities for conscientious\naction thereby stiffling the moral development of the individual. The\nstate should intervene only where there was a clear, proven and strong\ntendency of a liberty to enslave the individual. Even when such a\nhazard had been identified, Green tended to favour action by the\naffected community itself rather than national state action itself\n— local councils and municipal authorities tended to produce\nmeasures that were more imaginative and better suited to the daily\nreality of a social problem. Hence he favoured the ‘local\noption’ where local people decided on the issuing of liquor\nlicences in their area, through their town councils (see Nicholson,\n1985). \n\nGreen stressed the need for specific solutions to be tailored to fit\nspecific problems. This is not to say that all problems would be dealt\nwith most effectively at the local or municipal levels. The national\nstate was the only political institution powerful enough to wage war\ninternationally for example. Moreover it was the institution most\nlikely to be able to resist vested interests such as those found in the\nmanufacturing sector, meaning that it was the national government that\nshould pass regulations on terms and conditions at work say, or on the\nsale and control of land. Yet, Green stressed that there are no eternal\nsolutions, no timeless division of responsibilities. The distribution\nof responsibilities should be guided by the imperative to enable as\nmany individuals as possible to exercise their conscientious wills in\nparticular contingent circumstances, as only in this way was it\npossible to foster individual self-realisation in the long-run. Hence\ndeciding on the distribution of responsibilities was more a matter for\npractical politics than for ethical or political philosophy. Experience\nmay show that the local and municipal levels are unable to control the\nharmful influences of, say, the brewery industry. When it did show\nthis, the national state should take responsibility for this area of\npublic policy. \n\nGreen held that the ultimate power to decide on the allocation of\nsuch tasks should rest with the national state (in Britain, embodied in\nParliament). The national state itself is legitimate for Green to the\nextent that it upholds a system of rights and obligations that is most\nlikely to foster individual self-realisation. Yet, the most appropriate\nstructure of this system is determined neither by purely political\ncalculation nor by philosophical speculation. As we shall see, it is\nmore accurate to say that it arose from the underlying conceptual and\nnormative structure of one's particular society. \n\nIf the individual is to follow his conscience, then he must be free\nfrom external interference. He needs “fences” to protect\nhis freedom of thought, action, and so on. In Western societies these\nfences are rights, and one of the most important parts of Green's\npolitical philosophy is his theory of rights. The sense of\n“rights” with which Green is fundamentally concerned in his\nLectures on the Principles of Political Obligation can be\nunderstood as Kant understood “ein Recht”; that\nis, “[to have] a title … to coerce others through [one's]\nmere will to do or omit something that is otherwise indifferent to\nfreedom” (Kant, quoted in Mulholland, 1990, 5). More\nspecifically, Green argues that, \n\nGreen is primarily concerned with what I shall call for the moment\n“moral rights”: that is, those rights which are justified\nand recognised on ethical and not purely legal grounds. Moral rights\nexist prior to the law. We shall see that even though moral\nrights are conceptually distinct from legal rights, they\nshould still find expression in law in order to make them effective\nregulators of human action. Therefore, the role of the state is to\nuphold the rights which originate in society as part of the unfolding\nof the eternal consciousness. \n\nGreen attacks the view that there are moral rights which people\npossess merely as individuals: that is, moral rights which they possess\nwithout reference to their existence as members of a society founded on\na common purpose. In this sense, moral rights are necessarily social.\nThe idea that men could possess (“natural”) rights in a\n“state of nature” is ridiculous for Green (LPPO 9).\nParticular rights are only “natural” in the sense that they\nare “necessary to the end which it is the vocation of human\nsociety to realise” (LPPO 9). Hence, “A law is not good\nbecause it enforces ‘natural rights’, but because it\ncontributes to the realisation of a certain end. We only discover what\nrights are natural by considering what powers must be secured to a man\nin order to the attainment of this end” (LPPO 20). Yet, rights\nonly truly exist when they are the basis of “the control of the\nconduct of men according to certain regular principles by a society\nrecognising common interests” (LPPO 103). Before the slave comes\nto see his life as part of a goal-determined, rationally-ordered\nco-operative scheme, he has no true rights then. His rights are\n“in suspense” (LPPO 103). Having said this, there does\nremain a sense in which certain rights have always existed where there\nwas any society, even though it may take many generations for these\nrights to be recognised by and granted to anyone — “just as one\nmay hold reason to be eternal, and yet hold that it takes time for this\nor that being to become rational” (LPPO 103). What does this\nmean? \n\nA shared conception of a collective end — a common good — is the\nbasis of society's existence, and is also the basis of the individual's\nexistence as a moral agent (LPPO 114). Hence, achieving the moral end\nof man is dependant on the recognition of one's self as a purposeful\nagent who can only progress within a society of other purposeful moral\nagents. This echoes the Kantian idea that a fundamental element of\nrights is adherence to the categorical imperative. A violation of my\nrights is “an infringement upon my freedom that can co-exist with\nthe freedom of everyone in accordance with a universal law”\n(Kant, 1991, p.5). Rights represent means of bringing about the correct\nregulation of human interaction by giving formal expression to this\nfundamental human equality. Thus, rights only extend as far as\nindividuals recognise the rights of others. The possession of a right\nhence marks an individual out as a person who is worthy of respect\n(because he is a developing entity), and who also respects the\n“personhood” of his fellows (LPPO 140). Green extends this\nargument to claim that, by virtue of his possession of rights within a\nparticular society, the individual has the right to non-interference\nfrom all members of all societies (to the extent that he recognises\ntheir rights to non-interference). He extends it in this manner because\nhe holds that all individuals should respect the moral agency of anyone\nwho is recognised as a moral agent by anyone else. Such actual\nrecognition implies and requires the possibility of recognition by\neveryone. As Green writes, “[m]embership of any community is so\nfar in principle membership of all communities as to constitute a right\nto be treated as a freeman by all other men, to be exempt from\nsubjection to force except for prevention of force” (LPPO\n140). \n\nFrom this, Green adopts the Hegelian line that a slave has a right\nto his freedom in that he is engaged in social relations founded on the\nmovement to attain a common good. The slave's partial recognition of\nequality within society comes from the influence of the “signs\nand effects of this system [of social interrelations] all about\nhim” (LPPO 114) which acquaint him with certain abstract\nconcepts, and which place him in certain relationships to other members\nof that society. He goes some way to conceiving of the abstract\npossibility of an agent's life based on the pursuit of a common good in\nsociety. He then comes to recognise himself and his fellow slaves (and\npossibly his masters) as potentially or actually sharing a common\npurpose in their lives. This necessarily creates the slave's right to\nequal freedom with all other persons. The slave's rights become real\nwhen they are embodied in social institutions; that is, when they are\nactualised in formalised social relations (LPPO 114). The slave-owner's\nright to the free use of his possession — that is, the slave — is,\nthus, nullified as it rests on the non-recognition of the slave's right\nto freedom (LPPO 146). \n\nMoral rights should be used to criticize legal rights. For a start,\n“[n]o one would seriously maintain that the system of rights and\nobligations, as it is enforced by law, … is all that it ought to\nbe” (LPPO 9). For this reason “actual states at best fulfil\nbut partially their ideal function” (LPPO 143). In fact Green\nargues that the individual has a duty to resist the law when\nhis conscience tells him that the law fails to foster the development\nof his fellow citizens. Green enters one qualification to this. The\nstate may, on balance, serve the eternal consciousness more than it\nhinders it. It should only be resisted where the effect on the state\nwould not be so severe as to seriously undermine the social development\nwhich it generally supports (LPPO 104). \n\nGreen argues that where there are severe conflicts between groups\nwhich were subject to the same political sovereign — such as in the\nformer Yugoslavia — no true rights exist. That is, in times of total\nsocial disharmony there are no true rights for there is no true control\nof society. In these cases, one should decide which of the possible\ncourses of action is better or worse by referring to attaining the\nideal of developing the eternal consciousness (LPPO 104). \n\nOne may question Green's consistency here. He appears to be arguing,\nfirstly, that societies are defined by the possession of a common end;\nand, secondly, that conflicts between social groups can lead to the\nbreak-up of society. However, he has defined these social groups as\ncollections of individuals united by a common purpose — at worst,\ntheir particular — but, in Green's eyes, temporary —\nself-advancement. Thus, they are, from Green's perspective, still\nsocieties. In a sense, what has happened is that the original society\nhas been destroyed and the former members have formed into other\nsmaller societies which are then in conflict. As they are still in\nsocieties, their members possess rights which no one should violate.\nAll that Green can consistently argue is that the political unit —\nsuch as the nation-state — has broken down without being replaced by\nanother political unit (but by social groupings). However, rights are\ndependant not on the existence of any political unit, but on the\nexistence of social units. \n\nSo far, Green has only been concerned with rights as they existed in\nEurope in the late nineteenth century (LPPO 5). However, the gradual\nunfolding of the eternal consciousness is evidenced in the historical\nmovement from family-, to tribe-, and then to state-centred ethics.\nGreen does not make it clear how significant this movement (in its\n“rights-aspect”) actually is (PE 206-217). That is what I\nwant to do now. \n\nFamilies and tribes begin to interact with one another giving rise\nto more complex forms of social interconnections (PE 207). Social\ninstability increases as social realities increasingly come into\nconflict with established moral values. Eventually, rights arise which\nare not based on the primacy of these earlier, less developed social\ninstitutions, but on the idea of persons as discrete and potentially\nrational individuals. Green believes that in this way the world tends\nto become more rational and more harmonious. This rational harmony must\nbe based on the correct treatment of all humans as equals, which in\nturn is founded on the correct understanding of the individual as a\nself-determining agent (PE 208). \n\nThere are several elements to such an understanding. First, each\nmoral agent should be recognised as an end in himself (PE 199). Kant\narticulates this fundamental idea as follows, “Act in such a\nway that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in\nthe person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the\nsame time as an end” (Kant, 1964, p.96 Prussian Academy),\nKant's italics). In willing his own good then, the individual should\nrecognise himself as a human being and therefore an end-in-himself. Yet\non grounds of consistency he should also recognise all other humans as\nends-in-themselves (PE 195). In this way it should be recognised that\nall of humanity is owed duties by virtue of its inherent rationality,\nirrespective of its members' particular gender, “race, religion\nor status” (PE 207). The understanding of who is one's\n“neighbour” gradually comes to be widened, and gradually\n“the exclusive dependence of moral claims on relations of family,\nstatus or citizenship disappears” (PE 208). Also, the widening of\nthe practical conception of a “neighbour” gives an extra\nspur to the explicit development of the eternal consciousness in that\nit leads to the extension to everyone of the same right to freedom.\nThus, “[f]aculties which social repression and separation prevent\nfrom development, take new life from the enlarged co-operation which\nrecognition of equal claims in all men brings with it” (PE 208).\nThus, the process is self-promoting. The inherent logic of treating\npeople as equals is the increasing recognition of the moral centrality\nof the species as a whole, rather than one of its sub-groups. \n\nThis last move gives some content to the end which should be\npromoted, even if only by excluding some options for moral action.\nThus, the interests which must be fulfilled are not, for example, the\nmaximisation of pleasure, because this would mean that some end other\nthan the inherent nature of man is being served (PE 194). Also,\nreal interests and self-satisfaction cannot be found in\n“animal impulses” as such, because these impulses are not\nfounded of necessity on respect for the person as an end in itself (PE\n200). It is only by helping individuals to actualise their telos that\none truly shows them respect, and thus, truly treats them as\nends-in-themselves. Consequently, as individuals come to be recognised\nas ends-in-themselves, larger groups such as the family and tribes tend\nto be seen as less worthy of respect in themselves. Ultimately,\n“it is human society as a whole that we must look upon as the\norganism in which the capacities of the human soul are unfolded”\n(PE 273). \n\nNow, this process of history is evidenced in the widening of the\nmoral community which must necessarily accompany the growing\nrecognition that it is ultimately the spark of humanity which requires\nrespect — not national or class allegiance. As Kant puts it, the\n“perfect political constitution” is perfect precisely\nbecause its existence is essential to the realisation of “all [of\nthe] natural capacities of mankind” (Kant, 1991a, p.50). For this\nreason, the individual comes to recognise more people as his moral\nequals by virtue of their sharing his (implicit and ultimate)\nconception of the common good. Green does not make totally clear how\nradical this line of argument actually is; indeed, he may not have\nrecognised it himself. \n\nThe form of the modern state and its laws is dependant on the stage\nof development reached by the society from which it springs. The state\nmakes explicit in legal terms then, the moral views and relations which\nare already present within society. (The laws may lag behind the social\nmores, but they are still ultimately brought closer to the full\nembodiment of the eternal consciousness by these values.) As history\nprogresses, rights and all other expressions of the current stage of\nsocial development tend to become universalised — that is, extended to\nmore and more groups. Hence, slavery is abolished and women come to\ngain the same rights as men. This also extends to members of other\nnation-states. A nation is defined by its members' possession of the\nperception of a common telos, and the basis of attaining rights becomes\nthe perceived potential for attaining this common telos. Hence, rights\ntend to be universalised (importantly, across nations) as the telos of\neach nation converges. Nations merge and nationhood declines as a\nmotivating force of human action. \n\nThe thrust of Green's argument is that it is historically inevitable\nthat the nation-state will disappear as a form of political\norganisation, as the eternal consciousness becomes more explicit in the\nworld. The ultimate reference is “universal Christian\ncitizenship” (PE 206). This is a human's truly rational\ncommunity, whose common goal is to live in full accord with the eternal\nconsciousness. It will be a community of free individuals, each\npossessing the same rights, the same duties, and the same\nallegiances. \n\nThis section has examined Green's claim that rights are necessarily\nsocial. It has been shown that moral rights only exist where they are\nrecognised as contributing to the common good; that is, where they are\nseen to push society to attain its telos. Legal rights may or may not\nembody moral rights, but the ideal is the empowering of all and only\nmoral rights through law. An essential part of rights is their rational\ncoherence — that is, they must conform to Kant's categorical\nimperative. The second part of this section examined the effect of this\nargument when combined with the growing explicitness of the eternal\nconsciousness in the world. The Kantian respect for persons, thus,\nspreads from families to tribes, and, finally, to individuals as\nmembers of the human species. Implicit in this, it has been argued, is\nthe supercession of the nation-state. \n\nGreen writes that “[a]ppropriation is an expression of\n… [the individual's] consciousness of a possible\nself-satisfaction as an object to be attained” (LPPO 213). The\nindividual is thus conscious of himself as a “permanent\nsubject” to be served by his own use of material things (LPPO\n214). In this way, man comes to recognise nature as a pool of raw\nmaterials and resources which he can use to express his own\npersonality, development, and moral value (LPPO 223). So, by labouring\non an object, the individual gains a greater sense of his own\npotentials, thereby becoming more likely to develop them and so to\nbecome a more complete being. This means many things in practice. It is\ninextricably linked to Green's understanding of the will. Green\nwrites: \n\nThis passage sets out Green's reasons for believing that private\nproperty is morally important in his society. Negatively, one cannot\nrationally claim a right for one's self on the strength of one's\nability to freely determine the course of one's own life while denying\nthe same right to anyone else who also possesses these qualities. This\nis an application of Kant's categorical imperative in exactly the same\nway that Kant and Hegel applied in their respective theories of\nproperty. The positive condition initially seems to echo the Lockeian\nargument that the individual's right to hold private property is\nestablished through the exercise of his labour. However, for Locke, the\nmixing of one's labour with an object is understood in far more\nphysical terms than either Green or Hegel understand it. For them, the\nfundamental point is that deliberately forming an object is a process\nof externalising one's will. \n\nIn part, Green is concerned to show that property is an expression\nof one's being and worth. In appropriating something, one is able to\nsay “this shall be mine to do as I like with, to satisfy\nmy wants and express my emotions as they arise” (LPPO\n213). Owning private property is a sign of the individual's power to\nwill and be self-creating. The individual becomes aware that the object\nhe owns and controls is present because of his labour and talents. This\nlabour and these talents are, in turn, understood as the outward\nexpression of his own will and capacities — in a sense, his power —\nand, hence, worth. This recognition enables the individual to conceive\nof future wants and desires which it is possible for him to satisfy,\nthereby representing a development of his will and reason. From this\nstage, the individual can conceive of himself as a being possessing\nself-satisfiable desires and needs as a generic category — that is, in\nabstraction from any particular need. It is in this sense that the\nindividual becomes increasingly conscious of himself as a being that is\nat least potentially self-actualising and so self-fulfilling. \n\nHowever, the development of the will necessarily entails the growing\ntendency to recognise “an idea of an absolute good, common to\n[the individual] … with [all other members of society]”\n(PE 202). It is with this mind that one can understand Green's\nassertion that holding private property tends to develop a man's\n“a sense of responsibility” (LPPO 221). In part Green is\narguing that through holding property privately, humans increasingly\ncome to recognise the value of Kant's maxim that people should never be\ntreated “simply as a means, but always at the same time as an\nend” (Kant, 1964, p.96, Prussian Academy). \n\nYet, Green argues that the way to reach this stage of rational\nrespect and personal development will vary between individuals.\nPartially for this reason, property should be held privately. Communal\nownership of resources necessarily inhibits individual choice and\nimposes certain allocations and uses, whilst restraining others (LPPO\n218). Private property relations allow the individual to choose which\nthings to labour on and with, and hence how to develop. As Green notes,\n“[t]his appropriation must vary in its effects according to\ntalent and opportunity, and from that variation again result\ndifferences in the form which personality takes in different\nmen” (PE 191). Here, firstly Green advocates a system of property\nbased on distribution according to the use of one's “talents and\nopportunity”, in line with the above argument. Secondly, he\nadopts Hegel's argument that different distributions of material goods\nto specific individuals tend to make explicit different personalities\nin these individuals. This is different from but does not contradict\nwhat was argued previously. Green is now also saying that property is\nimportant to human development in a non-neutral way. For example, an\nartist as an artist requires access to certain resources that a farmer\nas a farmer would find useless. Hence, if individuals wish to control\ntheir own development according to their will, they need to control the\ndistribution of resources through a system of private property\nrelations. \n\nIt is important to remember Green's argument that the truly moral\nlife must be self-imposed. A person who is forced to live in a certain\nway, for example, by communal property relations and communal rights of\nappropriation, cannot live a truly morally life. This is because\nwithout the experience of choosing bad ways to live, the individual\ncannot value or know what better living is (LPPO 219). This is the case\neven if the outward appearance is perfection, because even then the way\nof life has not been internalised, it has not been freely chosen (PE\n219). \n\nYet, in many ways the most significant benefit of a system of\nprivate property relations is the self-discipline it produces in the\nindividual (LFC 194–196). If the individual does not learn to act in\nsuch a way that he can achieve his long-term goals, then he will be\nunable to develop the strength of character needed to overcome the\nshort-sighted desires which he experiences but which if followed would\nprevent him from gaining true self-satisfaction (LFC 200). \n\nNotice that Green is not concerned merely with private\nownership, but with ownership resulting from the individual's own free\nlabour. Hence, Green writes of the individual taking part in “a\nprocess in which each, while working freely or for himself, i.e., as\ndetermined by a conception of his own good, at the same time\ncontributes to the social good” (LPPO 223). The state should not\nfreely distribute goods to people who are capable of working for it\nthemselves. The state should only distribute goods in this way when the\nindividual cannot gain the resources for himself, for example, because\nhe is disabled. Striving to attain private property is instrumentally\nvaluable. \n\nThe consequences of this freedom include the creation of different\nlevels of resource-holdings between individuals. That is, the resulting\nsociety is not egalitarian (LPPO 223). However, an unequal distribution\nof resources is morally defensible in Green's eyes, because it is in\nthis way that the different talents possessed by different people are\nactualised to the greatest possible extent (LPPO 220). Hence, both rich\nand poor are best served in this way. Green recognises the naivety of\nsupporting extreme inequality of wealth on the grounds that the system\nwhich has allowed it is essential for the poor's moral development\n(LPPO 221). His point is that these inequalities are necessary to raise\neveryone's standard of living to a level sufficient for moral\ndevelopment. \n\nWhy does Green believe this? It could be argued that the capitalist\nmarket necessarily operates in such a way that some people inevitably\nsuffer such extreme poverty that their lives will be meaningless. This\nis an argument that Green acknowledges and tries to explore (LPPO\n220–232). He recognises that there are many people who, while being\nformally able to appropriate, have no real power to do so. They are\nleft with no way of “providing means for a free moral life, of\ndeveloping and giving reality or expression to a good will, an interest\nin social well-being” (LPPO 228). Hence, Green refers to the\ngrowth “of an impoverished and reckless proletariate” (LPPO\n227). The workers are “too badly reared and fed to be efficient\nlabourers” (LPPO 220). For this reason, they cannot command a\nwage in the market which is sufficient to empower their formal ability\nto appropriate. They will not bother to save as they are so cynical\nabout their prospects for self-advancement and breed so quickly that\nthey merely perpetuate these evils (LPPO 228). Furthermore their\npoverty forces them to accept a state of near-slavery — enduring bad\nworking conditions, hours and housing which causes which cause\nill-health and even death. They are thereby forced to seek comfort in\nalcohol and shallow past-times, and to neglect their own education and\nthat of their children (LFC 201–204). In short, there is “a\nlowering of the moral forces of society” (LFC 201). This\nsituation is particularly important in that “[l]eft to itself, or\nto the operation of casual benevolence, a degraded population\nperpetuates and increases itself” (LFC 203). \n\nGreen's criterion for assessing the illegitimacy of any economic\npractice is whether “one set of men are secured in the power of\ngetting and keeping the means of realising their will, in such a way\nthat others are practically denied the power” (LPPO 221). Indeed,\nthis is the ground on which he analyses, for example, his contemporary\nfactory legislation (LFC 195–200) and licensing laws (LFC 209–212). \n\nHe argues that the fundamental cause of the conditions of the\nworking classes is the manner in which current land holdings were\nacquired. He notes that, for the most part, “[t]he original\nlandlords have been conquerors” (LPPO 228). This has had at least\ntwo effects. Firstly, it has meant that, “[l]andless countrymen,\nwhose ancestors were serfs, are the parents of the proletariate of\ngreat towns” (LPPO 229). The workers have been conditioned to\ntake orders and not to exercise their own judgement. They are forced to\naccept any work they can find and so to endure low wages and poor\nconditions. This leads to little incentive to either save or make\nlong-term plans. Thus, the proletariat have not come to see themselves\nas capable of or deserving of freedom, nor as having any real family\nresponsibilities. In this way, workers have been denied the power to\ndevelop. They cannot actualise their potential to become self-conscious\nand self-determining beings. \n\nSecondly, landlords have been given rights which they should not\npossess; that is, rights which are contrary to the development of the\nspecies. One example is the right to unlimited appropriation of the\nland. Thus, although things other than land can be legitimately\nappropriated without restraint, the acquisition of land must be\nregulated. Land is the precondition of all other forms of ownership,\nand so must be granted to everybody to some degree (LPPO 229). A\nfundamental difference between land and other things (particularly\ncapital) is that “one man cannot acquire more land without others\nhaving less” (LPPO 229). For example, everyone must occupy some\narea of land, even if it is merely the land under your feet. If all\nland was (privately) owned by landlords, everyone else could justly be\nexcluded from the world. This would be an incredible infringement of\nthe development of the eternal consciousness. \n\nIn more realistic terms, private control of land allows private\ncontrol of what happens on that land. The landlords would then have\nthe power to restrict the workers' free exercise of their consciences\nand the free execution of their life plans. These restrictions on the\nfree exercise and hence the development of their will include\n“building houses in unhealthy places or of unhealthy structure,\n… stopping up means of communication, or forbidding the\nerection of dissenting chapels” (LPPO 229). Also, Green draws\nattention to the infringement of workers' freedom under the system of\n“open” and “closed” villages. The basis of\nrights — the service of the eternal consciousness — is\ncontradicted.  Without real freedom, individuals are denied the chance\nto realise their personal conception of the good. They do not have the\nopportunity to implement long-term plans, nor the self-discipline\nwhich an autonomous life brings. This is yet another reason why rights\nto land cannot be absolute — “no man's land is his own for\npurposes incompatible with the public convenience” (LFC\n206). One interesting point is that landlords could and sometimes did\nserve the eternal consciousness by banning public houses from their\nland.  However, this furtherance of the eternal consciousness does not\naffect Green's basic and very valid point. \n\nThe common benefits which private control of land — interestingly,\n“if it is to be allowed at all” (LPPO 229) — have been\nlost, because of these illegitimate rights and bad customs which\nparadoxically restrict landlords' freedom to use the land (LPPO 229).\nYet, exactly how the state should regulate private property in land\nwill depend on national circumstances and history (LPPO 231). Given\nGreen's ambivalence to private ownership of land, systems of communal\nownership with private use may well have been acceptable to him They\nare at least broadly consistent with his wider moral theory. \n\nDoes this apply to wealth? As was shown, Green's presumption is for\nprivate ownership. Land was special because of its limited supply and\nits importance for all other property holdings. Hence, he argues that\nthe problem is not with having wealth as such, but is with producing\nand distributing it. In his discussion, he highlights two difficult\nareas — freedom of bequest and free trade (LPPO 222). The problem is\nthat they may both lead to great concentrations of wealth, and hence of\npower to restrict others' liberty (LPPO 224). \n\nGreen argues that a necessary part of planning one's future for\none's self is deciding the fate of one's wealth (LPPO 222). For\nexample, part of holding private property is being able to act\nbenevolently through giving to charity and other gifts. This includes\nthe right to determine the distribution of one's wealth immediately\nafter one's death. For example, Green argues that a man's children are\n“included in his forecast of his future” (LPPO 224). By\nthis, Green means that a man's actions are partially geared towards\ncertain goals which are based on the existence and life of his children\nand friends. The removal of the individual's ability to execute his\nWill is, thus, a restriction on his will. \n\nNow, Reeve argues that it is uncertain whether Green sees “the\nprimary right” as “inheritance or bequest”, for Green\ndoes also argue that children have a prima facie claim on\ntheir parents for a certain level of care and consideration (Reeve,\n1986; 160). In fact, Green is only really concerned with bequest. He is\nless sympathetic to inheritance for many reasons. For example, no child\nhas laboured for the wealth he inherits. This is important because, as\nwas shown, the positive condition for holding property is labour. Also,\nGreen states explicitly that a man is perfectly justified in not\nleaving his wealth to a child whose actions he disapproves of (LPPO\n225). The right of the child in this passage (LPPO 225) is couched far\nmore in terms of the right to being correctly brought up. Indeed, the\nright of bequest is vital here as it allows the possibility of\nnot letting one's children inherit equally or at all, and\nhence, exercising a man's mind in such a way as to create a sense of\n“family responsibility” in him — one of the main benefits\nof freedom of bequest is that it fosters his care and respect for\nothers and allows him to make long-term plans by which he can actualise\nhis true will. \n\nReeve is also wrong to argue that Green's theory of bequest says\nnothing “about the position of the childless” (Reeve, 1986\n160). Green explicitly says that a man should be free to distribute his\nwealth “as he likes among his children (or, if he has none,\namong others)” (LPPO 224, my italics). He must argue this to\nbe consistent. The important point about the right of bequest is that\nit enables a person to make a certain sort of plan which affects the\nmanner in which he lives his life, and in which he raises his children,\nand makes explicit judgements about those he believes will outlive\nhim. \n\nStill, there is a problem in that such freedom of bequest helps to\nmaintain the inequalities of wealth in society. The poor are apparently\ncondemned to remain in poverty, because wealth can be kept within the\nsame family, or, at best, class. Green argues that there are several\nreasons for believing that this concentration of wealth will be\navoided, reduced or offset in society. Firstly, natural family\naffection will counter customs and laws which support the giving of\nwealth to one child only — usually the eldest son (LPPO 225). Indeed,\na law of primogeniture is illegitimate as it inhibits a man's right to\ndistribute his wealth as he wishes (LPPO 224). Secondly, the inheritor\n“may yet by his labour contribute largely to the social good, and\na well-organised state will in various ways elicit such labour from\npossessors of inherited wealth” (LPPO 224). Presumably, this is a\nlarger contribution than he would have made if he had not inherited the\nwealth. \n\nThe third reason, and the most promising for Green, is that it is\nlegitimate for the state to tax the individual's income and wealth, on\nthe grounds that it provides security for his holdings and acquisitions\n(LPPO 224). This is an important and powerful argument. Yet,\ninterestingly, Green's benefit theory denies an individual's\nabsolute right to private property in capital. For taxation to\nbe consistent with purely private property, the individual\nmust in some sense give his consent for his money to be taken. However,\nfor Green, there need not be even tacit consent for taxation to be\nlegitimate. The state has a right to raise taxation from inheritance\nbecause of the benefits it gives, rather than the consent it receives.\nHe argues that redistributive taxation is legitimate, because\nthe state protects the individual's rights to inheritance and bequest.\nRights are only legitimate when they serve the development of the\neternal consciousness. Taxation can do this, and when it does, the\nstate has right to tax the individual which overrides the latter's\nright to private property. There is a call for a right to gain\nprivate property at the same time as it is partially denied. Yet,\nGreen's justification is always explicitly limited by the need to be of\nservice to the eternal consciousness. Thus, Green states that\n“[i]t is only through the guarantee which society gives him that\n[a man] … has property at all, or, strictly speaking, any right\nto his possessions” (LFC 200). Green's advocacy of redistributive\ntaxation is, thus, consistent with his wider teleological theory. \n\nGreen begins his discussion of free trade in the Lectures on the\nPrinciples of Political Obligation by arguing that it produces a\nredistribution of resources from “where they are of least use\n… [to] where they are of most use” (LPPO 224). I assume\nthat Green broadly equates “use” with personal need as\njudged by the particular individual. In this way, the\nself-interested activities of businessmen also serve the social good.\nHowever, this is an incredible oversimplification of what actually\nhappens in the market. For Green's assertion to be valid, he must\nassume that each individual has the same purchasing power. Only in this\nway will each pound which is spent represent the same level of need.\nThe problem is that given inequalities of wealth in the economy (which\nGreen sees as inevitable and often beneficial under capitalism), the\nvalue of each pound does not represent the same level of need\nirrespective of who spends it. For example, an extra hundred pounds is\nworth far more to a poor man than it is to a rich one. The distribution\nof goods within the capitalist market is, thus, far more concerned with\ndemand from blocks of wealth rather than genuine need. The\ninequalities of wealth which arise in capitalism are too great for his\npresent argument to be taken seriously. \n\nAlso, he argues that there is no formal block on workers setting up\ntheir own co-operative societies “for the investment of\nsavings”, and, so in England, “the better sort of labourers\ndo become capitalists” (LPPO 227). This is good, because in\nbecoming a successful capitalist, the worker must learn to plan and\nexecute his actions coherently. This requires rational thought and\nself-discipline. Green admits that in practice there may be blocks on\nthis “development”, but says that these are the result of\nnon-capitalist practices. For example, the poor are so\n“impoverished and reckless” (LPPO 227) that often they\ncannot form such societies. \n\nGreen's last justification of capitalism to be discussed here is his\nmost powerful. It must be remembered, Green argues, “that the\nincreased wealth of one man does not naturally mean the diminished\nwealth of another” (LPPO 226); and capitalism benefits everyone\nin the long-run. Even the poor are made better off because the wealth\nheld by the rich is used in such a way that is raises the standard of\nliving of everyone in society. The significant rise in the standard of\nliving of the British working classes since the Industrial Revolution\nhas been the result of free trade and government legislation to protect\nthe workers' from exploitation (LFC 201–204). This is Green's most\npowerful justification for private property. \n\nIt has been shown that Green's theory of property is — or, at\nleast, tries to be — based squarely on his teleology. Thus, he argues\nthat generally a system of private property is the best arrangement for\npromoting the eternal consciousness in society as a whole. Where it\ncontradicts this end, private property is illegitimate. This creates\nhis ambivalence about the private ownership of land and his call for\nthe taxation of bequests. Whilst his arguments for free trade are\ninteresting, they are also often limited by his economic naivety. For\nexample, he underestimates the power of the rich to exclude the poor\nfrom economic success. Bearing this in mind, one must question the\nconsistency of his attachment to private property. Although he\nargues, as Nicholson writes, that “private property is necessary\nto morality because it is necessary to will (which is necessary to\nmorality)” (Nicholson, 1990, p. 97), one should not forget the\ndevelopmental nature of the will. It may well be that communal property\n“is not available as a present resource”, as Mill puts it,\nmerely because the human will is not developed enough. Rights to\nproperty may have moved from the family to the individual, but that\ndoes not mean that they cannot move on to the species. Indeed, this\nwould seem to be the logical conclusion of Green's argument that the\nindividual must come to recognise that their truly common telos is in\nliving as members of the human race. \n\nDespite this, Green's discussions of property are always based on\nhis assessment of whether, in general, a given practice or property\nright serves the development of the eternal consciousness. In this way,\nhis argument is consistent. \n\nGreen's influence and philosophical reputation remained strong well\ninto the early years of the twentieth century. Followers such as\nEdward Caird, Bernard Bosanquet and Francis H Bradley did much refine\nGreen's thought and to extend his principles to the circumstances of a\nnew epoch. The resulting British Idealist movement was eventually\ntransformed into the ‘New Liberalism’ of L. T. Hobhouse\nand J. A. Hobson amidst growing dissatisfaction with Idealist\nmetaphysics and a general reaction in Britain against ‘all\nthings German’ that resulted from the First World War. The\nmid-twentieth century saw a number of influential attacks being\nlaunched against the movement, most notably from H. A. Prichard, John\nPlamenatz, Isaiah Berlin, and Melvin Richter. Interest in Green's\nthought has gradually revived not least due to the work of Alan Milne\nand Peter Nicholson. A number of new works on Green and Idealism have\nbeen produced in recent years (see the bibliographical entries for\nDavid Brink, Thom Brooks, Matt Carter, Alberto de Sanctis, Maria\nDimova-Cookson, Michael Freeden, Denys P. Leighton, Rex Martin, Avital\nSimhony, Geoffrey Thomas, Colin Tyler, David Weinstein, Ben Wempe, and\nAndrew Vincent, amongst many others).  An important collections of new\nessays appeared in 2006 (Dimova-Cookson and Mander, eds.). A new\nedition of Green's Works was published in 1997, which\nincludes over 500 pages of previously unpublished material edited by\nPeter Nicholson.  Alberto de Sanctis has edited Green's remaining\nundergraduate essays (de Sanctis, 2005, pp.175–196.) I have\nedited a number of previously-unavailable manuscripts, including the\nremaining parts of Green's lectures on the John's Gospel (‘The\nIncarnation’), Romans ('The Pauline conception of justification\nby faith') and Galatians ('The Incarnation') (Tyler, ed., 2005,\nvol. 1, pp.1–188). Clarendon reprinted the fifth edition of\nGreen's Prolegomena to Ethics in 2003, replacing Edward\nCaird's preface with an introductory essay by David Brink.\nConferences are held frequently on the thought of Green and the other\nIdealists in Britain, Canada and the USA, many of which are organised\nby the Centre for Idealism and the New Liberalism at the University of\nHull, the British Idealism Specialist Group of the Political Studies\nAssociation, and the British Idealism and Collingwood Centre, Cardiff\nUniversity."}]
