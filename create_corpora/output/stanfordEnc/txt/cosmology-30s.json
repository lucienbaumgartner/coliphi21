Cosmology between 1932–48\nprovides an excellent example how explicitly philosophical\nconsiderations directed the evolution of a modern science during a\ncrucial period of its development. The following article exhibits\nthese philosophical aspects of cosmological thinking in detail,\nbeginning with a brief sketch of the historical development of general\nrelativity cosmology until 1932. Following this, the historical\nparticipants in the philosophical debate are introduced, along with\nthe basic ideas of their competing positions. Then the critical stages\nof the debate — 1935–37 — are closely explored by\nfocussing directly upon the arguments of the participating scientists\nand philosophers. Finally, the concluding stage of the philosophical\ndebate, namely, the emergence of the steady-state theory of the\nUniverse, is presented in the context of its development from Popper’s\nphilosophy of science.\n\n\n\nOne of the most vigorous philosophical debates of the century broke\nout among cosmologists during the 1930s and 1940s. At the peak of the\ndebate, 1936–37, many of the most prominent scientists in Britain, as\nwell as several leading philosophers of science, had gotten themselves\npublically involved. Their arguments, attacks and rebuttals were\nchronicled in many of the leading scientific journals, including a\nspecial edition of the foremost general scientific journal,\nNature, devoted entirely to philosophical arguments and\ncounter-arguments. \n\nMethodology was the central issue of the debate, although\nmetaphysical questions also arose, particularly those concerning the\nactual reality of certain structures and forces imputed to the Universe\nby the new cosmological theories and observations. But in the end,\nmethodology was the real goad spurring on most of the participants. \n\nAt bottom, there were just two opposing positions in the debate,\neach of which comprised a two-point stance. On one side were those\nscientists who had their roots mostly in the experimental side of\nnatural science. To them, there was one and only one legitimate method\nfor science. Theory construction, they believed, involved two\nclosely-linked steps. First, one began from the empirical\nobservations, that is, from measurements, manipulations,\nexperiments, whose results were evident to the human senses; this is\nclassic empiricist epistemology. Observational results would\nthen suggest possible hypotheses to examine via further empirical\ntesting. When enough data concerning the hypothesis had been gathered,\nlogical generalization could be carried out, thereby producing\na theory; this is classic inductivist logic. \n\nOpposing these inductive-empiricist scientists were those whose\nroots were mostly in the theoretical side of natural science, most\nespecially mathematical physics. To them, there was another, more\nlogically sound, method to construct theories. First,\nhypotheses could be generated in any fashion, although most\nbelieved that imagining hypotheses which were based upon very general,\nvery reasonable concepts—that the Universe’s physical processes\nhad simple mathematical descriptions, for example—was the best\nplace to begin; this is classic rationalist epistemology. Once\nthe hypothesis had been generated, strict analytical reasoning could be\nused to make predictions about observations; this is classic\ndeductivist logic. Scientists who held this view came to be\ncalled hypothetico-deductivists; their views about both\nhypothesis generation and deductive predictions were each strongly\nopposed by the inductive-empiricists. \n\nPart of the controversy may be laid to the fact that cosmology was a\nnew science, and disputes about methodology in new sciences are not\nrare in the history of the sciences. What is rare about this case,\nhowever, is the vigor, sometimes even bitterness, with which the\nphilosophical controversy was waged. Another reason for the controversy\nlies in the fact that cosmology is a data-poor science: observations\nare hard-won and rare, and they frequently must be run through\nelaborate theoretical manipulations and corrections in order to make\nsense at all. With a paucity of data results, scientists must rely upon\nphilosophical argument to undergird their views about how the\nscientific work should be done. \n\nOne final feature of the debate must be noted. The participants are\nalmost universally scientists, and not philosophers. Yet this does not\nmuch affect the level of philosophical thinking going on; these\nscientists knew their philosophy well, and they wielded philosophy’s\nweapons and defenses with great skill. In the end, their debate shaped\ncosmology into the science we know today. \n\nIt will be useful to look briefly at the history of cosmology\nleading up to the debate. \n\nSince about 1700 theories about the nature and structure of the\nUniverse were derived from Newtonian theory, most especially his theory\nof gravitation, which was used to account for the behavior of heavenly\nbodies and their systems. Newton’s theory hypothesized a\nforce—gravitation—acting upon material bodies, free to move\nover time within the passive, inert ‘container’ of\nthree-dimensional space. Bodies, paths, and space itself exemplified\nthe classical geometry of Euclid. All these features changed with the\npublication of Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity, 1915–17. \n\nEinstein’s intended his theory to replace Newton’s theory of\ngravitation completely. In Einstein’s view, gravity was not a force\nexisting independently of the spatial ‘container’; rather,\ngravitation arises as a curvature of the space (and time, which is\nnecessarily connected to space in the new theory), which means that\ngeometry and gravity and astronomical behavior are all intimately\nconnected. For example, near the sun the geometrical structure, the\ncurvature, of spacetime changes radically, which expresses itself as an\nincreasing velocity of incoming orbiting bodies such as comets or\nsatellites. One immediate, and to some, puzzling, consequence of\nEinstein’s theory is that the geometry of the Universe is no longer\ntaken to be Euclidean. Although there are several different candidates\nfor the actual geometry of space, it was not known which is\ncorrect. \n\nIt was not recognized at first that the General Theory of Relativity\ncould be applied to the Universe as a single, whole, individual object,\nthereby producing a new cosmological theory, one completely different\nfrom its predecessors. Although the mathematics involved are extremely\ndifficult, two solutions, one by Einstein himself, the other by the\nDutch astronomer Willem de Sitter, were produced in just a short time\nin 1917. Unfortunately, the universes predicted by the two solutions\nwere extreme: Einstein’s universe would be densely packed with matter,\nwhereas de Sitter’s would be essentially empty. \n\nObviously, the universe as observed by astronomers did not conform\nat all to the description provided by either solution, a fact many\nfound troubling. Moreover, no additional solutions were forthcoming\n(even though both Friedmann and LeMaître had developed\nalternatives, they remained unknown and unnoticed). For nearly twelve\nyears, the new cosmology appeared to be going nowhere. Then Hubble at\nCalifornia’s Mt. Palomar made public his astonishing observations of a\ncosmic Doppler shift, a shift toward the red in the color of light\ncoming from the most distant star systems. \n\nMost cosmologists—with the interesting exception of Hubble\nhimself—came to the immediate conclusion that the red shift could\nonly mean that the universe was expanding. Immediately the relativity\ntheorists were able to interpret the expansion as a continuous change\nin the geometry of spacetime, which was thoroughly accounted for by the\nGeneral Theory of Relativity. After over a decade of stagnation in face\nof the meager choice between just two models of the cosmos, Hubble’s\nobservations spurred theorists on to the construction of a melange of\nnew models, each vying in competition with the other. \n\nIn the end, it was the Belgian astronomer Georges LeMaître’s\ntheory of an expanding universe that came to be accepted.\nLeMaître’s model was publically proclaimed as appropriate and\ngenerally correct during a special session of the British Association\nfor the Advancement of Science, 31 Oct 1931. Modern scientific\ncosmology had been officially born; because of its birth within the\ncontext of Einstein’s theory of relativity, the new cosmology became\nquickly and broadly known as Relativistic Cosmology. The model\nof this cosmology is most famously that of the blowing up of a balloon\npainted with dots to represent galaxies. Over time, the radius of the\nmodel’s spherical space (the balloon) increases, thereby decreasing the\ncurvature of the space (the balloon’s skin), and increasing the\ndistance between the dots. \n\nAlthough cosmologists came from Europe and America as well as\nBritain, most of the work in theoretical cosmology took place in\nLondon, Cambridge and Oxford. Americans Hubble, Tolman and Robertson\ndid their work at CalTech in Pasadena, but were frequently in England;\nand most of the European and British workers cycled through Pasadena at\none time or another. De Sitter, from Holland, and LeMaître, from\nBelgium, spent important periods in England, as did various of the\nGerman workers. Thus, even though cosmology was done throughout the\nWestern world, its major concentrating point was England; our focus in\nwhat follows will be the same. \n\nBecause it represented such a radical departure from previous\nscientific thinking about the Universe, relativistic cosmology needed\nto work out its philosophical underpinnings, most especially in regard\nto its methodology. ‘How is this new science to be\nconducted?’ was thus a compelling question. But method, of\ncourse, is always linked to metaphysics and epistemology. A full-blown\nphilosophical discussion was evidently required. It came soon enough:\nwithin a span of less than a year, a vigorous debate between two\nphilosophically opposed camps developed. The debate required nearly two\ndecades to reach its full resolution. But, with the resolution,\ncosmology had philosophically certified its methodology within the\ncontext of a concensus metaphysics and epistemology. Before going into\nthe details of the debate, however, several general points should be\nnoted. Let us turn to the details of the origin of the debate. \n\nTo begin with, the cosmological thinking of the majority of\nscientists—including Eddington, de Sitter, Robertson, Tolman, and\ntheir colleagues—had betrayed a relatively unexamined, and\napparently uncontroversial cluster of philosophical perspectives: on\nthe metaphysical side they held a modest sort of explanatory\nrealism—if an accepted theory referred to entity x,\nthen x was acceptable as a genuinely, physically real object;\nto this metaphysical stance was coupled a methodology exhibiting a\nclassic sort of inductive empiricism—scientific\nknowledge consisted of generalizations built up from individual\nempirical observations. But this cluster of views did not go long\nunchallenged. In early July 1932, just nine months after relativistic\ncosmology became the concensus during the British Association meeting,\nOxford astrophysicist E. A. Milne published a short article in\nNature which directly attacked the current philosophical\ntenets, proposing their replacement by a new cluster of views, one as\nradical as the new science it purported to undergird. \n\nMilne’s metaphysical views were based in positivism, most especially\nin operationalism: only those objects whose properties could\nbe directly revealed by some observational procedure, or operation,\nwere to be counted among the real. Thus, for Milne, reality did not\ncontain the usual relativistic cosmology referents “curved\nspace”, “expanding space” or even\n“four-dimensional spacetime”, simply because none of these\nentities were operationalizable. Milne held that ‘what you see\nis what you get’; since “curved space” of various\ngeometries couldn’t be observed, space was just as it\nlooked—Euclidean. In the same way, the expanding of the Universe\nwas a genuine expanding—each galaxy was retreating from each\nother—not just a change in the geometry of the curvature, as it\nwas for the relativists. Moreover, in place of relativistic cosmology’s\ninductive empiricism, Milne opted for a hypothetico-deductive\nrationalism. Cosmologists, Milne believed, were bound to dream up\nany and all possible models of a universe, and then deduce what, if\nany, observable consequences followed from their hypotheses.\nHypothesizing could be based upon just about anything, although Milne\nbelieved that certain very general rational principles derived from\naesthetic beliefs about universal order and regularity would be the\nmost fruitful. His ‘cosmological principle’,\nnamely, that every cosmologist in the universe should look out upon the\nsame cosmos, was the prime example of such thinking. Later, Bondi would\nfound Steady-state Cosmology on an even more general version of Milne’s\nprinciple, which he called the ‘perfect cosmological\nprinciple.’ \n\nMilne’s philosophy of cosmology came with a closely associated\ncosmological model, kinematic relativity, so-called because of\nits tight links to the kinematics of Einstein’s Special Theory of\nRelativity. Kinematics, in Einstein’s Special Theory, is especially\nconcerned with observers trying to make measurements of the behavior of\nobjects moving in systems relative to themselves. According to Milne’s\nunderstanding, these measurements could only be made by the observers\nsignalling among themselves using light or other electromagnetic\nradiation, using clocks to time the signals. In the end, all\nmeasurement—even space and velocity—reduced to timing the\nsignals as they went from one observer to another. This idea of\nmeasurement represented a revolutionary simplification of previous\nideas, and held philosophical interest for that reason alone. There\nwere practical consequences as well. As Bondi later remarked,\n“Milne’s idea led straightaway to the radar speed gun!” \n\nMilne’s kinematic relativity and its underlying philosophy both\nimmediately brought careful scrutiny, not to mention controversy. \n\nEddington was the first to attack Milne’s views. In a series of\nlectures given at Harvard in late 1932 and published early in the\nnew year as The Expanding Universe, Eddington denied the\nefficacy of both operationalism and hypothetico-deductivism, and not\nonly defended explanatory realism, but strengthened his ontological\nposition heroically: the theoretical entities of relativistic cosmology\nwere not just plausible, they were so necessary to understanding the\nuniverse, that cosmological knowledge was essentially impossible\nwithout them (Eddington 1933, p. 19). \n\nFew others would ever go so far as Eddington’s ontological heroism;\nyet epistemological and methodological heroism in the fight against\nMilne was not rare. Chief hero in this aspect of the attack on Milne\nwas Herbert Dingle, a highly respected astrophysicist, and\nthen-secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society. Dingle’s initial\nforay appeared as a response to Milne’s first detailed presentation of\nkinematic relativity (Milne 1933). After claiming that while kinematic\nrelativity did not differ appreciably from relativistic cosmology in\nits mathematical formalism or observable consequences, Dingle asserted\nthat, on the other hand, it invited special criticism because it\nrenounced “the fundamental principles of scientific\nmethod”, namely, “Newton’s principle of induction from\nphenomena” (Dingle 1933, p. 178). Dingle was never to relent in his\nattacks upon Milne’s hypothetico-deductivism, at all times rejecting\nthe methodology as even a possible candidate for acceptance by genuine\nscience. \n\nDingle’s article appeared back-to-back with an appraisal of\nkinematic relativity by the important American cosmologist H. P.\nRobertson (Robertson 1933a). Robertson focussed upon Milne’s\nhypothetico-deducivism as well, noting that the cosmological principle\nin kinematic relativity functions as an a priori rule, rather\nthan as an empirical generalization, its status in relativistic\ncosmology. Robertson otherwise is not especially taken with Milne’s\ntheory, limiting himself to remarks suggesting that, where they can be\ncompared, kinematic relativity and relativistic cosmology apparently\nare similar in physical content. As we shall shortly see, Robertson’s\nlater work strongly belied this earlier apparent indifference to\nMilne’s theory. \n\nRight from the start, cosmologists differed in their opinions about\nboth the physical content of Milne’s theory, and its underlying\nphilosophy. Dingle disliked Milne’s methods, but found the theory\nitself of not much interest. Robertson initially agreed with Dingle,\nbut within a short time had significant changes of heart. Eddington\ndisliked both the theory and its philosophy, finding them far too\ndeviant from what was typical, i.e., relativistic cosmology and its\nmainstream philosophy. Younger cosmologists such as McVittie and\nMcCrea, students, respectively, of Eddington and Whittaker, soon joined\nthe fray. McVittie initially found the physics of kinematic relativity\nquite interesting, and quite different from the physics of relativistic\ncosmology (McVittie 1933b). But Milne’s philosophy was something else;\nthe strict empiricism McVittie had earlier revealed (McVittie 1933a)\nmade him equally unhappy with both Milne’s rationalism and his\nhypothetico-deductivism. \n\nMcCrea’s remarks were among the most perceptive and favorable\n(Kermack and McCrea 1933). While he thought that Milne’s operationalist\ncriticisms of curved and expanding space were of little import, McCrea\nwas the first to notice the parsimony and elegance of Milne’s strictly\nkinematic solution to the problem of the origin of the universe’s\nexpansion. Since a search for such a solution had vexed relativistic\ncosmology for several years (McVittie 1931), McCrea suggested that\nMilne’s mechanism should be immdiately shown to be part of relativistic\ncosmology (Kermack and McCrea 1933 p. 529). \n\nClearly, the so-recently won consensus about relativistic cosmology\nand its philosophy had dissolved into confusion and controversy over\nMilne and his methods. \n\nOver the next year or so, Milne made strenuous efforts to elucidate\nboth kinematic relativity’s physics and its philosophy, beginning, as\nwould be his wont, with the philosophy. In October, Milne addressed the\nPhilosophical Association, giving an explicit and detailed analysis not\nonly of his philosophical views, but also of their history, which, he\nclaimed, extended back to Locke and Hume (Milne 1934a) His description\nof the two opposed methods—inductive empiricism vs.\nhypothetico-deductivism—is quite clear and useful: \n\nMilne’s commitment to axiomatization is notable here. It was based\nin his earlier admiration for the work of Whitehead and Russell\n(Crowther 1970); commitment to axiomatization in cosmology, once having\nbeen initiated by Milne, would be an enduring hallmark of the work of\nmany, including both Robertson and Walker. \n\nThree weeks after this address, Milne spoke on related topics at the\nmonthly meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society. His main point was\nthat theories differed only insofar as their concepts could be cashed\nout in observations deduced from them. Eddington took strong exception\nto Milne’s arguments, claiming in response that kinematic relativity\nand relativistic cosmology differed more importantly in their ontology\nthan in their consequences. Eddington was especially concerned with\ndifferences in the spacetime-geometry each theory ascribed to the\nworld. For Eddington and his colleagues, the equivalence of gravitation\nand spacetime geometry was a genuine reality, a feature of the physical\nworld, just as real as suns and moons and stars. \n\nMilne was having none of it. In the next month’s\nObservatory—the informal monthly publication of the\nRoyal Astronomical Society—he took Eddington and his\ntheoretical-realist colleagues to task, concluding that “theories\ndiffer simply and solely when their predictions as to phenomena\ndiffer”; most importantly, “this method of comparison\navoids all reference to distance-assignments, world-geometry, schemes\nof projection or the like” (Milne 1934b). In other words,\nmetaphysics was to be avoided in cosmology; space, spacetime, geometry\nand the like were to be rejected as scientific realities, replaced by\nreference simply and solely to observations. The only realities,\naccording to Milne, were what could be reported among observers about\nlight signals and clocks. \n\nDuring 1934 Milne worked together with his new student A.G. Walker.\nWalker never evinced much interest in the philosophical aspects of\nkinematic relativity, choosing instead to focus tightly upon working\nout the physical details of the theory itself. He had immediate\nsuccess (Walker 1934). One of his important conclusions was that other\nauthors, specifically McVittie and Robertson, were wrong to conclude\nthat the physics of Milne’s theory ultimately corresponded to\nrelativistic cosmology: “Milne’s system is fundamentally\ndifferent from that of general relativity.” (Walker 1934 p.\n489; emphasis in original) \n\nIn an important review of the entire confused situation between\nkinematic relativity and relativistic cosmology, McVittie confessed\nthat “experimentally it seems hopeless to discriminate between\nthem…at present the choice is almost entirely a matter of\npersonal taste” (McVittie 1934 p. 29). At almost the same time,\nde Sitter took on Milne in serious fashion (de Sitter 1934). Responding\nto Milne’s methodological challenge, he showed that, indeed, it is\npossible to formulate relativistic cosmology in axiomatic fashion, just\nas Milne had formulated kinematic relativity “from\nconcepts.” But de Sitter explicitly rejected Milne’s\nphilosophical use of the cosmological principle, “which asserts\nthat statistically the world pictures of two different observers must\nbe the same.” His objection is founded on the matter-of-fact that\n“we have, however, no means of communicating with other\nobservers, situated on faraway stars, or moving with excessive\nvelocities” (de Sitter 1934 p. 598). So much for rational\nprinciples as hypotheses! \n\nThe year in cosmology ended almost as confused as it had begun, with\none exception: Milne had gotten much clearer about his philosophical\nviews, and was applying them to an exhaustive presentation of his\ncosmology, theory and philosophy. His book Relativity, Gravitation\nand World Structure (Milne 1935) would be published in just a few\nmonths. \n\nThe new year marked a sudden change. In short order, McCrea, Walker\nand Robertson succumbed to Milne’s methodological recommendations:\nfirst, to carry out an operationalist paring of non-observational\nconcepts, then, secondly, to embed the resulting minimalist concept set\nin an axiomatic hypothetical-deductive structure. Thus was the famous\nRobertson-Walker spacetime metric born. \n\nMcCrea’s effort operationalized the concept of\n“distance”, principally and originally by comparison of\ncertain elements of Newtonian cosmology and de Sitter’s axiomatized\nversion of relativistic cosmology (McCrea 1935). Walker’s paper\nspecifically eschewed use of “any indefinable concepts”, in\nparticular, he did not assume that the “associated metric [of\nrelativistic cosmology] has any a priori physical\nsignificance” (Walker 1935). Robertson’s article, the first of\nthree, is the most important, both in its content, and in the signal it\nsends, namely, that one of the original mainstream relativistic\ncosmology proponents has adopted a major element of Milne’s new\nphilosophy for cosmology (Robertson 1935). Robertson’s conclusion\nexhibits this point clearly and explicitly: \n\nUnlike de Sitter, Robertson accepts the cosmological principle, replete\nwith its observers on far-separated particles. Moreover, as this\nstatement shows, Robertson is intimately familiar with Milne’s latest\noperationalist reduction: space is to be reduced to time measurements\ngiven by clock readings on signals exchanged between observers.\nRobertson gets this idea from Milne’s book, which he had earlier\nreviewed (but which was only subsequently published) for\nAstrophysical Journal (Robertson 1936).  \n\nEddington disparages these same methods. In his scathing\nNature review of Milne’s book, he rejects Milne’s\nhypothetico-deductivism, his cosmological principle, and, above all,\nhis operationalism: “When I visit the Cavendish Laboratory, I do\nnot find its occupants engaged in flashing light-signals at each other,\nbut I find practically everyone employing rigid scales or their\nequivalent” (Eddington 1935, p. 636). Whittaker’s review was not\nso negative as Eddington’s (Whittaker 1935). While the senior physicist\nrejects Milne’s operationalism and attacks upon the geometrical\ncommitments of relativistic proponents, he is considerably more\nforgiving about Milne’s hypothetico-deductivism, and even goes so far\nas to remark Milne’s “brilliant record in astrophysical\ndiscovery.” Nonetheless, Milne’s break with a tradition including\nat least “Einstein, de Sitter, Friedmann, LeMaître, Weyl,\nEddington, H.P. Robertson and others” is to be regretted\n(Whittaker 1935 p. 179). Perhaps, along with Eddington, Whittaker hopes\nthat soon “Professor Milne will return to orthodoxy”\n(Eddington 1935, p. 636). \n\nBut Whittaker’s view on Milne must be put into the perspective he\nheld on the whole ongoing debate. As he saw it \n\nBut lively debate is far too gentlemanly a description for what now\noccurred. After holding his ire somewhat in check for—as he saw\nit—already far too long, Dingle finally erupted.  \n\nControversy over Milne and his philosophy reached a crescendo in\nmid-1937. Dingle, his stew having finally boiled over, wrote privately\nto the editor of Nature, first castigating the rampant\ncosmological ‘mysticism’ passing itself off for science,\nand then offering to produce an article taking the sword to the mystics\nthemselves. His offer was immediately accepted. The result was Dingle’s\nnotorious “Modern Aristotelianism”, a polemical diatribe\nchiefly against Milne, but aimed as well at Eddington and Dirac on\naccount of their “betrayal” of the scientific method of\nNewton and his fellow members of the Royal Society (Dingle 1937). \n\nThe article is remarkable both for its style and for its content.\nDingle’s style in the article is vituperative. Thus, emotionally-loaded\nterms such as “paralysis of reason”, “intoxication of\nthe fancy”, “‘Universe’ mania”, and the\nlike frequently appear, these to be topped only by references to\n“delusions”, “traitors”, and, of course,\n“treachery”, each associated with one or more of the guilty\nparties (Dingle 1937, p. 786). \n\nAbove and beyond his extreme language, Dingle makes certain\nsubstantive claims bearing directly upon central philosophical\nquestions. The issue, as he sees it, is nothing more than the question\n“Whether the foundation of science shall be observation\nor invention” (Dingle 1937, p. 786). As always, talk about\n‘foundations’ is philosophical talk. The two opposing\npositions Dingle here calls “foundational” involve views on\nboth method and epistemology, suitably tangled together. Dingle\ndelineates the opposed alternatives as follows. The way of true\nscience, he claims, shows that “the first step in the study of\nNature should be sense observation, no general principles being\nadmitted which are not derived by induction therefrom” (Dingle\n1937, p. 784). Stated more explicitly, Dingle here argues that authentic\nscience is empiricist in epistemology (scientific\nknowledge is founded in sensory observation), and\ninductivist in method (general principles are reached\nvia inductive logic). Opposed to this view, he argues, is “the\ndoctrine that Nature is the visible working-out of general principles\nknown to the human mind apart from sense perception” (Dingle\n1937, p. 787). As representative of this latter view Dingle cites Milne,\nand refers in particular to Milne’s claim that “it is, in fact,\npossible to derive the laws of dynamics rationally…without\nrecourse to experience” (Milne 1937, p. 329). Obviously, Dingle\nis here arguing against the view, Milne’s view, that authentic science\nmay be rationalist in epistemology (scientific\nknowledge is founded in pure theoretical reasoning apart from sense\nperception), and hypothetico-deductive in method\n(general principles are justified by their deductively implying correct\nobservations). \n\nAlong with Milne, Dingle indicts Eddington, and, by implication,\nDirac, all three of whom, Dingle believes, are guilty of inventing\nscientific hypotheses by free mental imaginings rather than by strict\nimmersion in observations and observational data. \n\nWhat is going on here? Put bluntly, Dingle is an old-fashioned\nempiricist and inductivist. He believes that the only way to do true\nscience is to first collect data, then, and only then, to hypothesize\non the basis of that data. Observation, then hypothesis. As he sees it,\nEddington, Milne and Dirac have got it exactly backwards. They first\n(as he terms it) assume an hypothesis, then, and only then, go about\ncollecting data. Except, according to his lights, the data isn’t ever\ncollected: “to [the Aristotelians’] modern representatives it\nseems as though a fancy is no sooner in the head than it is on paper\nand sent for publication” (Dingle 1937, p. 785). Obviously Dingle\nis simply wrong; it never occurred to his opponents that hypotheses\nwould not be followed immediately by attempts at\ndeductive prediction of observational consequences. But it was enough,\nin Dingle’s mind, that they didn’t use induction, for them to come\nunder blame. \n\nBut there is something else at work here as well. Dingle doesn’t\nobject solely to his opponents’ lack of inductive logic. Of equal\nimportance is the fact that they find the source of their hypotheses in\nfairly general principles, wide-ranging rational proposals about the\nstructure of the universe at large. These principles Dingle takes to be\na priori, in the most pejorative sense of that term. They are\nphantasms, “chimeras” he calls them, which seduce the\nimaginations of his opponents, and lead them and their dumb-struck\nadmirers away from the genuine, authentic method of science.\nThis is what really sticks in Dingle’s craw. In turn,\nEddington, Milne and Dirac are chastised, each for something slightly\ndifferent, but at bottom the same, namely, they one and all\n“appear as a victim of the great ‘Universe’\nmania” (Dingle 1937, p. 786). In the end, Dingle believes, the\ndanger of this new ‘methodology’ is real, and serious. As\nhe notes in conclusion: \n\nHere Dingle obviously goes over the top. Yet overblown as it is,\nthere is no doubting his sincerity: Milne and the other cosmologists\nhave betrayed the true science bequeathed them by their ancestors in\nthe Royal Society. \n\nHow could Dingle be answered? \n\nThe response arrived three months later, on 12 June. On this\nparticular Saturday in June, Nature published a fifteen-page\nspecial supplement as No. 3528. Contained within were contributions\nfrom sixteen “representative investigators”, as the editor\nreferred to them, each responding to “Modern\nAristotelianism” Nature’s Editor, R.A. Gregory,\nintroduces the occasion by noting that “in Nature of May\n8, we published an article by Dr. Herbert Dingle entitled ‘Modern\nAristotelianism’”. Because the article, as Gregory goes on\nto say, “created considerable interest”, Nature\n“decided to invite further contributions on the subject from a\nnumber of representative investigators.” \n\n“Created considerable interest” is, to understate the\nissue, an understatement. Some of the contributors were quite obviously\nlivid with rage and other volatile emotions. Others, such as Milne\nhimself, who had come in for particularly scathing criticism in\nDingle’s article, were patient and careful in rebuttal. Each of the\nsixteen contributors to the special article chose a side in the\ncontroversy, either pro Dingle’s inductive empiricism, and con Milne et\nal.’s rationalist hypothetico-deductivism, or vice versa. Remarks made\nby the participants exhibit the full diversity of philosophy of science\nin their contemporary community. Dingle’s views, in particular, were\nnot without favor. \n\nHarold Jeffreys, F.R.S., noted geologist and astronomer, and author of\na well-regarded philosophy of science book Scientific\nInference (1957), led off with a nice ad hominem:\n“Without using induction, Milne and Eddington could not order\ntheir lives for a day, and what they are really asserting is that they\nare entitled to use special axioms in physics, for which no need has\nbeen shown.” Jeffreys’ criticism here of course ignores the role\nof deductive observations in justifying the “special”\naxioms. The problem, as Jeffreys sees it, originates in the\nperpetrators’ “belief that there is some special virtue in\nmathematics.” L.N.G. Filon, F.R.S., vice-chancellor of the\nUniversity of London agrees on this point, noting that “some men\nof science appear to think that they can solve the whole problem of\nNature by some all-inclusive mathematical intuition.”\nR.A. Sampson, the Astronomer Royal, focusses upon the rationalistic\naspects of the ‘modern Aristotelians’, to wit, for their\n“framing a theory independent of experience, such as is\ndenounced in Dr. Dingle’s article”, which produces work not\nunlike that “of a poet or other humanist, who gives us at most a\nnumber of illustrative cases.” \n\nBut Milne, Eddington, and Dirac had their supporters as well. N.R.\nCampbell, whose theory of science was already well-known, makes an\nuncontroversial interpretation of the affair. “Science” he\nbegins, “(or at least physics) has long consisted of two\ndistinct but complementary activities”, one of which is\nexperimental and empirical; “its procedure is induction.”\nThe other activity attempts to provide explanations of scientific\nlaws, which explanations have the “pecularity” that\n“they often (not always) predict new laws in addition to\nexplaining old ones.” Campbell cannot resist ending on an ad\nhominem of his own: “If he [Dingle] does not deem it\nimportant to observe the distinction between what is and what is not\ndemonstrable experiment, surely he should welcome a movement to\namalgamate the Royal with the Aristotelian Society.” Indeed. \n\nG.J. Whitrow, then a young lecturer at Christ Church, Oxford,\nreturns to the mathematical theme. Dingle, he argues, “not only\nattacks the particular methods adopted by contemporary mathematical\ninvestigators in relativistic cosmology, but even refuses to admit that\nthis subject is worthy of scientific investigation as it is based not\nonly on experience but also on reason.” Hypotheses, by this\nlight, may originate rationalistically as well as any other way,\ncertainly there is no problem with this. \n\nThe clearest, most temperate description of the issues at hand is\ngiven by young cosmologist William McCrea, then professor of\nmathematics at Queen’s, Belfast, and editor of the R.A.S.’s\nObservatory. Not to be outdone by Jeffreys, McCrea begins\nwith an ad hominem of his own: “Dr. H. Dingle’s objection to\n‘modern Aristotelianism’ seems to be itself what he would\ncall Aristotelian rather than Galilean.” In other words, Dingle\nraises a non-empirical objection about Milne et al.’s\nnon-empiricism!  But McCrea soon gets to the heart of the matter, the\nrole of hypothetico-deductivism in mathematical physics: \n\nThis is an absolutely standard interpretation of how the H-D method\nworks. Throughout his own writings, beginning right from his inaugural\nlecture in Oxford (Milne 1929), Milne had subscribed to precisely the\nsame interpretation of the Hypothetico-Deductive (H-D) method. Whatever\nthe controversy is about, the issue is not how to interpret\nhypothetico-deductivism. That much is evident. \n\nMoreover, it is quite clear that Dingle et al. are not mounting\nopposition to something we, today, would consider philosophically\nradical; rather, they are objecting to what, today, would be\nconsidered completely unobjectionable. Given today’s acceptance of the\nH-D method, yet its rejection by otherwise well-regarded scientists at\nthat time, it seems to follow that it was, at least in part, this\ndebate and its followup which settled the issue. In any case, Dingle\nand his supporters generally went silent, restricting their activities\nfor the most part to books, or relatively positive statements of their\nown positions (A.D.R. 1938, Dingle 1938). Things settled down, just in\ntime for the War. \n\nDuring the next several years, it became evident that Milne’s\nmethods, and kinematic relativity as well, had reached respectability.\nOne important sign of this progress was exhibited at an early 1939\njoint meeting between the Royal Astronomical Society and the Physical\nSociety of London, The meeting had as its goal a thorough review of the\nsituation in cosmology. McVittie was chosen to present the\nobservational situation; his report was soon published (McVittie,\n1939). Reviewing the theoretical situation was George Temple, one of the\nmost highly respected mathematicians of the time. Temple’s report saw\nprint almost immediately (Temple 1939). Within a short time, Temple’s\npaper took on the role of successor to Robertson’s definitive 1933\n“Relativistic Cosmology” (Robertson 1933b). \n\nBoth McVittie and Temple presented kinematic relativity and\nrelativistic cosmology as equal competitors in accounting for the\ncosmological observations. Unfortunately, as McVittie noted,\nobservations could not, at that time, discriminate between the two\ntheories. Temple’s analysis of Milne’s work praises its simplicity and\nelegance, and refers in particular to its operationalism and\naxiomatization, which “start from a completely novel discussion\nof the correlation of measurements made by different observers in terms\nof light signals only” (Temple 1939, p. 468). Throughout the rest\nof his discussion of the two theories, Temple utilizes Milne’s\nlight-signal correlation method, explicitly rejecting rigid-rod\ntransport for distance measurement. Milne’s methods have triumphed. \n\nLater that year McCrea published an important paper in\nPhilosophy of Science (McCrea 1939). Put most simply, the\npaper starts out to defend Milne’s methods, but ends up by presenting a\nfull-blown and interesting, although quite unhistorical, account of the\nevolution and structure of physical theories. \n\nMcCrea’s overall view is that theories are set up to be\nhypothetico-deductive in structure. His account is based on his view of\nthe evolution of theories of space-time and mechanics, beginning with\nNewton, through the General Theory of Relativity and ending in\nkinematic relativity. His argument reduces to the claim that, insofar\nas Milne and e.g., Newton, can be shown to follow the same procedure,\nany attack upon Milne is also an attack upon Newton. First, he states\nhis goals in the paper. \n\nThe first goal is to emphasise how each theory leaves us in a\nposition in which the succeeding one appears as a perfectly natural\nnext step in the development of ideas (McCrea 1939, p. 137). McCrea\nembeds this argument in an account of how analogue models (à la\nCampbell) are used to set up new theories—this is essentially an\naccount of how discovery might proceed in linking an older theory with\nits successor. The second goal is to show how, in spite of superficial\ndifferences in character, the theories in question all necessarily\npossess the same general structure constituted by the presence of\nhypotheses, from which certain general mathematical relations are\ndeduced, which in their turn are used to predict relations between\nobservable quantities. As McCrea notes, “this study may claim an\ninterest of its own, but it is presented also for a further\nreason” namely, that \n\nIn McCrea’s discussion of the theories he asserts that “the\nconsituents [of the theories themselves] which are of physical\nsignificance are sets of mathematical relations, coupled with sets of\nrules of interpretation” which yield, “after observational\ntest, descriptions rather than explanations of physical\nphenomena.” According to McCrea, one real advantage of his view\nis that it “leads to simple criteria for comparing the merits of\ndifferent theories.” Finally, on the metaphysics of the original\nhypotheses, McCrea claims that “the initial hypotheses from which\nthe mathematical relations are deduced do not ultimately have any\ndirect physical significance.” \n\nMcCrea’s paper, published in the leading philosophy of science\njournal of the time, is the final imprimateur on Milne’s views. \n\nThree years later, Milne was awarded the James Scott prize, the most\nprestigious award for ‘natural philosophy’ in the\nAnglophone world. Milne’s lecture title is telling: “Fundamental\nConcepts of Natural Philosophy” (Milne 1943). Although Milne does\nconcede to Dingle that he no longer believes that it is possible to\ndeduce physics completely in the absence of reference to phenomena, for\nthe most part his award lecture is a long reiteration of his previous\ntwelve years’ work in cosmology. \n\nOne year later, Milne received his ultimate accolade, election as\npresident of the Royal Astronomical Society. In his inaugural lecture,\nMilne again reviews his work, but adds two remarks of interest. First,\nhe modifies his earlier view that theories are acceptable solely on the\nbasis of their successful predictive power; to this, he now adds that a\ntheory cannot be accepted as satisfactory unless it is philosophically\nsatisfying (Milne 1943, p. 120). Secondly, on a personal note, he\nadmits that he is still amazed at the outcry that his theory and its\nphilosophy caused. Milne here is being a bit disingenuous. In many\nplaces in his letters he not only recognizes the outcry, he delights in\nit, and seeks to provoke it even more (Milne 1932–37, 12 May 35; 28\nJul 36). \n\nFrom this point onward, cosmology’s philosophy is no longer directly\ninfluenced by Milne himself. Moreover, kinematic relativity began to\nstagnate as a research programme; except for Whitrow, Milne had no new\nstudents, and failed to attract any new converts to the theory (Whitrow, 1996). His\npersonal philosophical work was done.  But although his personal philosophical work was done, and kinematic relativity seemed moribund as a research program, in the late 1990s it was rediscovered, and Milne’s model, as it was christened, came into renewed interest as a source of predictions for cosmological behaviour such as rates of cosmic expansion, and production of cosmological strings. (Moncy, 2016; Russo, 2003). But even though Milne himself retreated into the background, his philosophical influence didn’t end, in fact it wasn’t to crest until the end of the 40s in the work of another man, Hermann Bondi. Again, however, a storm was generated by Milne’s\nmethods, even though they were now in the hands of another. \n\nIn 1948, a young mathematician, Herman Bondi, in concert with two\nclose friends Thomas Gold and Fred Hoyle, proposed a radical new\ncosmological theory, the Steady State theory. This theory\ndiffers from the basic picture shared by both kinematic relativity and\nrelativistic cosmology, namely, that of a universe with a definite\norigin in a small, dense knot, followed by evolution into the universe\nwe have today. According to Bondi’s theory, the universe as far back\ninto the past as we might look would always look the same; there was no\nevolution, there could be no “fossils”, as Bondi called\nputative evidence of a universe different in the past from our present\none. What we observe today is the same state of a universe that has\nbeen and always will be steady. Bondi came to his notion of the steady\nstate primarily from his commitment to the philosophical components of\nMilne’s work, most especially the methodology of rationalism plus\nhypothetico-deductivism; additionally, Bondi coupled to these Milnean\nnotions some ideas taken directly from the philosophy of Karl\nPopper. \n\nBondi reveals his philosophical commitments in several ways. First, he\nargues against induction and extrapolation from small-scale\nexperiment, that is, against the inductive empiricism of Dingle et\nal.  Secondly, he argues in favor of hypothesis and deduction,\nthat is, in favor of Milne et al. Finally, he specifically\nremarks the excellence of Milne’s Methods, and the\ntheory—kinematic relativity—created therefrom, and remarks\nthe significance of these elements in the creation of his version of\nthe new steady-state cosmology. \n\nFrom the very beginning Bondi admits the validity of both positions\nin the methodological debate: \n\nThe extrapolating approach, which Bondi sometimes calls the\nempirical school, is represented by Dingle, McVittie, and\ntheir colleagues. Opposed to the extrapolative approach is the\ndeductive approach, which “is reached from\ninvestigations in the borderland between physics and philosophy.”\nMilne is obviously the major proponent of this view. Although Bondi\nfinds good points in both approaches, he also finds problems in both\napproaches. In the end, cosmology is the worse for excesses from\neither end of the spectrum:  \n\nIn this latter case, the deductive extremists, in their mathematical\nzeal, seem to forget that cosmology, after all, should\nhave some relation to observation: “To them all that is of\ninterest in a theory is its logical character, not its relevance to the\ninterpretation of observational data.” Obviously, this danger\nmust be avoided: according to Bondi, deductivism can be a\nscientific approach in cosmology only if its\npostulates (or axioms) are candidates for disproof.  \n\nClearly, with this reference to the connection between science and\ndisproof, Bondi has added a distinctly Poppererian element to the\ndeductivist methodology, one which had not previously appeared in the\nworks of any of the earlier members of the hypothetico-deductive\nschool. According to Popper’s philosophy of science, a theory can\nlegitimately be called “scientific” only if that theory\nmakes a prediction that, in principle, can be shown to be false, or\nfalsified, to use Popper’s own term. Thus astrology, for\nexample, fails to be a scientific theory because it cannot be\nfalsified: although astrology seems to make predictions, these\nstatements about the future are so vague, so general and abstract, that\nthey cannot be tied down to definite claims about observations to be\nmade at a definite time and place. Hence there is no explicit\nobservation to be made in falsification. Astronomy, in comparison,\nmakes explicit, specific predictions about what will occur in the sky\non such-and-such a date, in such-and-such a place. If the prediction\nfails, then we know that the element of astronomical theory which made\nthe prediction is deficient, maybe even false. \n\nCosmology is a borderline case: since observations of cosmological\nsignificance are so rare and hard-won—Hubble’s observation of the\nred shift was one of the first solid ones—it is very difficult,\nnot to mention brave, to tie one’s cosmological theory to Popper’s\nfalsificationist principle as a guarantee of scientific acceptability.\nBut this is exactly what Bondi did. \n\nMuch later Bondi was to make explicit his debt to Popper: \n\nYet Bondi’s major philosophical debt was to Milne. According to\nBondi, Milne’s theory was through and through deductive, which was\nreason enough for some of his colleagues to condemn it: \n\nIn addition to his admiration of Milne’s H-D methodology, Bondi has\nhigh praise as well for Milne’s operationalism, particularly its use in\ndefining distance:  \n\nIn the end, Bondi sums up Milne’s contributions with no uncertain\npraise:  \n\nHere Bondi speaks of Milne’s cosmological principle. According to\nMilne’s principle, every observer in the universe should get the same\nworld picture, that is, should make precisely the same observations of\nthe universe at the same moment as any other observer (Milne 1934b).\nUniformity over spatial slices is guaranteed by Milne’s invoking of the\nprinciple. Yet Milne’s universe evolves, it changes its form over time.\nHence it has no temporal uniformity. Bondi felt that this raised the\npossibility that physics itself might change over time. Because of this\nrisk, Bondi generalized Milne’s cosmological principle into what he\ncalled the perfect cosmological principle [= PCP]. According to\nthis principle, all observers at all places and at all\ntimes will look out upon the same unchanging, unevolving,\nuniverse. Such a universe is a universe in a steady-state—hence\nthe name. \n\nClearly, PCP is a daring, indeed heroic, interpretation of a\nmethodological necessity. Forty years after the fact, Bondi described\nthe “philosophical attitude” which underlay his\n“implausible” PCP: \n\nHence, or so Bondi’s argument goes, since there is reason\nnot to trust the laws of physics if the universe is\nevolving, let us presume that the universe is not\nevolving and changing; that is, let us presume PCP. Although the\nprinciple (and the theory which results from it—steady state\ncosmology) is, as McVittie remarked, “much more restrictive than\ngeneral relativity”; (McVittie 1990, p. 45) it is this very\nrestrictiveness which satisfies Bondi’s Popperian wishes:  \n\nIn another place, Bondi makes a similar point: “Comparison with\nobservation becomes then possible and renders the PCP liable to\nobservational disproof. This possibility of a clear-cut disproof\nestablishes the scientific status of PCP” (Bondi 1957, p. 198).\nComments such as this make clear Bondi’s committment to a Popperian\naddition to the basic deductive methodology he inherited from Milne.  \n\nIn the end, the philosophical purity of Bondi’s steady state theory\nserved him, and cosmology, well. Of course, the usual suspect, Dingle,\nand others of his ilk, such as McVittie in particular, were outraged,\nand loudly, at Bondi’s extension of Milne’s methods. A passage from\nDingle’s R.A.S. Presidential Address suffices to show the tenor of the\ndebate’s declining days: \n\nBut PCP and the theory which it engendered were exactly as\ndescribed: eminently falsifiable. No matter the extent of Dingle et\nal’s disdain, Steady State theory stayed right out in front, ready\nfor whatever empirical observations might be slung at it. As Bondi said\n“Show me some fossils from an evolving universe, and I’ll give it\nup.” In 1965, the fossils arrived, courtesy of the observations\nof the 3° K remnant microwave radiation. \n\nAnd Bondi, true to his philosophy, gave it up.","contact.mail":"galeg@umkc.edu","contact.domain":"umkc.edu"}]
