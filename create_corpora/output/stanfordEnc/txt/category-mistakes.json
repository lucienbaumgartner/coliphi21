Such\nsentences are striking in that they are highly odd or infelicitous,\nand moreover infelicitous in a distinctive sort of way. For example,\nthey seem to be infelicitous in a different way to merely trivially\nfalse sentences such as ‘\\(2 + 2 = 5\\)’ or obviously\nungrammatical strings such as ‘The ran this’.\n\n\n\nThe majority of contemporary discussions of the topic are devoted to\nexplaining what makes category mistakes infelicitous, and a wide\nvariety of accounts have been proposed including syntactic, semantic,\nand pragmatic explanations. Indeed, this is part of what makes\ncategory mistakes a particularly important topic: a theory of what\nmakes category mistakes unacceptable can potentially shape our\ntheories of syntax, semantics, or pragmatics and the boundaries\nbetween them. As Camp (2016, 611–612) explains: “Category\nmistakes … are theoretically interesting precisely because they\nare marginal: as by-products of our linguistic and conceptual systems\nlacking any obvious function, they reveal the limits of, and\ninteractions among, those systems. Do syntactic or semantic\nrestrictions block ‘is green’ from taking\n‘Two’ as a subject? Does the compositional machinery\nproceed smoothly, but fail to generate a coherent proposition or\ndelimit a coherent possibility? Or is the proposition it produces\nsimply one that our paltry minds cannot grasp, or that fails to arouse\nour interest? One’s answers to these questions depend on, and\nconstrain, one’s conceptions of syntax, semantics, and\npragmatics, of language and thought, and of the relations among them\nand between them and the world.”\n\n\n\nMoreover, the question of how to account for the infelicity of\ncategory mistakes has implications for a variety of other\nphilosophical questions. For example, in metaphysics, it is often\nargued that a statue must be distinct from the lump of clay from which\nit is made because ‘The statue is Romanesque’ is true,\nwhile ‘The lump of clay is Romanesque’ is\nnot—indeed, the latter ascription arguably constitutes a\ncategory mistake. Correspondingly, an assessment of this argument\ndepends on one’s account of category mistakes (see §4\nbelow).\n\n\n\nAfter a brief discussion of how to characterize category mistakes\n(§1) and of the history of the debate (§2), the majority of\nthis entry focuses on the question of how to account for the\ninfelicity of category mistakes (§3). We conclude with some of\nthe implications of the debate on category mistakes for other issues\nin both philosophy of language and metaphysics (§4).\n\n\nOne might have expected this entry to start with a definition of\n‘category mistake’. However, giving an explicit\ninformative definition of category mistakes is no easy task. A typical\ndictionary definition looks like this: “The error of assigning\nto something a quality or action which can only properly be assigned\nto things of another category, for example treating abstract concepts\nas though they had a physical location” (Stevenson 2010). But\nsuch definitions are at best too vague to be useful, and at worst\nsimply incorrect. For example, if ‘properly assigned’ is\ninterpreted as meaning\ntruly assigned, then the definition massively over-generates:\nthe sentence ‘Two is odd’ assigns to something (the number\ntwo) a quality (being odd) that can only be truly assigned to things of\nanother category (odd numbers), but the sentence clearly isn’t a\ncategory mistake. Alternatively, if ‘properly assigned’ is\nunderstood as ‘grammatically assigned’, then we risk\nclassifying obviously ungrammatical strings such as ‘the boys\neats’ as category mistakes. \n\nOther definitions suffer from not being sufficiently theoretically\nneutral, relying on specific controversial accounts of category\nmistakes. For example, one might try to define category mistakes as\nsentences that are syntactically well-formed but meaningless. But as\nwe shall see both parts of this proposed definition depend on\ncontroversial assumptions about the nature of category mistakes: that\nthey are syntactically well-formed (cf. §3.1) and that they are\nmeaningless (cf. §3.2.1). Moreover, even if we are willing to\neschew theoretical neutrality, note that most of the accounts\ndiscussed do not offer an obvious way to distinguish category mistakes\nfrom other linguistic phenomena. For example, according to the\ntruthvaluelessness view (§3.2.3) category mistakes are contentful\nbut truth-valueless but, at least according to many philosophers, so\nare some instances of vague sentences such as ‘John is\ntall’. And according to the presuppositional approach\n(§3.4), category mistakes suffer from a presupposition failure,\nbut then so do sentences that are not category mistakes such as\n‘The king of France is bald’. \n\nPerhaps the question of how to define category mistakes will receive a\nmore satisfactory answer in the future or perhaps (following a general\ntrend in analytic philosophy against conceptual analysis) we should\neschew the project of defining category mistakes altogether. At any\nrate, extant debates on the topic of category mistakes have focused\nlargely on the question of how to account for their infelicity rather\nthan on the question of how to define the concept or distinguish\ncategory mistakes from other phenomena. The remainder of this entry\nwill follow suit. \n\nEven without offering an explicit definition, there is a\nphenomenological way of characterizing category mistakes. As noted at\nthe outset, there seems to be a distinctive kind of infelicity which\nwe can recognize by example: the sort of infelicity present in\nparadigmatic category mistakes such as ‘The number two is\nblue’. We can thus characterize category mistakes as sentences\nthat are infelicitous in a similar manner to these paradigmatic\nexamples. While this kind of phenomenological characterization may not\nseem theoretically informative, on reflection it reveals several\ninteresting features of category mistakes. First, category mistakes\ncan be created using a wide range of syntactic types: for example,\nadjectives (‘Two is green’); adverbs (‘John sleeps\nfuriously’); or prepositional phrases (‘The theory of\nrelativity is under the table’). Second, the infelicity\ncharacteristic of category mistakes seems to occur in a range of\ncomplex constructions (for example, ‘The number two isn’t\nblue’ or ‘Either the number two is blue or it is\nprime’). Third, whether the sort of infelicity in question is\npresent can depend on context, in various different ways. For example,\nan utterance of ‘That is green’ seems infelicitous in a\ncontext where the demonstrative refers (or appears to refer) to the\nnumber two, but entirely innocuous in a context in which it refers to\na pen. And an utterance of ‘The priest is pregnant’ can be\ninfelicitous in a context where speakers assume that all priests are\nmale, but entirely innocuous in a context where it is assumed that\nthere are female priests. As we shall see, these features play a role\nin the ensuing debate. \n\nPhilosophers seem to have been interested in the phenomenon of\ncategory mistakes at least since Aristotle, even if the phenomenon was\nnot explicitly labelled. For example, In Metaphysics Zeta 5, Aristotle\nraises an interesting puzzle concerning the attribute\n‘snub’: on the one hand, ‘snub nose’ seems to\nmean exactly the same thing as ‘concave nose’ which\nsuggests that ‘snub’ simply means the same as\n‘concave’. On the other hand, this cannot be the entire\nstory because, unlike ‘concave’, ‘snub’ can\nonly be felicitously attributed to noses: ‘concave bowl’,\nfor example, is entirely felicitous while ‘snub bowl’ is a\n kind of category\n mistake.[1] \n\nHowever, it seems fair to trace the contemporary debate on category\nmistakes to the first half of the 20th century, and most\nnotably to the work of Gilbert Ryle (who also coined the term\n‘category mistake’). Influenced by the work of Edmund\nHusserl, Ryle argued that category mistakes were the key to delineating\nontological categories: the fact that ‘Saturday is in bed’\nis a category mistake while ‘Gilbert Ryle is in bed’ is\nnot, shows that Saturday and Ryle belong to different\n ontological\n categories.[2]\n Moreover, Ryle\nmaintained that distinguishing between categories was the\ncentral task of philosophy: “The matter is of some importance,\nfor not only is it the case that category-propositions (namely\nassertions that terms belong to certain categories or types), are\nalways philosopher’s propositions, but, I believe, the converse\nis also true. So we are in the dark about the nature of philosophical\nproblems and methods if we are in the dark about types and\ncategories.” (Ryle 1938, 189) \n\nTo see why category distinctions were so important to Ryle, we need\nto look at another major influence: Bertrand Russell. Russell argued\nthat a range of paradoxes (including his famous set-theoretic paradox\nand the Liar paradox) can be solved by restrictions of type. For\nexample, the famous set-theoretic paradox requires considering sets\nthat are (/ are not) members of themselves. However, if ‘is a\nmember of \\(s\\)’ is a predicate that can only meaningfully\nbe predicated of objects of a certain type which does not include\n\\(s\\) itself, then ‘\\(s\\) is (/ is not) a member of\n\\(s\\)’ is simply a meaningless sentence, and the paradox\ncannot even be properly expressed. This inspired two related ideas,\nwhich gained further support from the work of Wittgenstein and the\nlogical positivists: first, due to some kind of type confusion,\napparently grammatical sentences might nevertheless be meaningless;\nsecond, apparent philosophical puzzles might be resolved by exposing\ntype confusions and declaring the sentences allegedly stating the\npuzzle meaningless. \n\nRyle argued that these ideas should be applied much more widely than\nRussell’s discussion of the paradoxes suggested. The thought was\nthat by recognizing some philosophically puzzling assertions as\ncategory mistakes, one would expose them as meaningless, thus\ndissolving these puzzles altogether. This philosophical methodology saw\nits culmination in The Concept of Mind, in which Ryle declared\nthat the dualistic position and the mind-body problem that it gives\nrise to is “one big mistake and a mistake of a special kind. It\n is, namely, a category\n mistake”.[3]\n The exact relation between these philosophical\nproblems and more paradigmatic cases of category mistakes (sentences\nsuch as ‘Saturday is in bed’ which Ryle discussed in his\nearlier work) is not entirely clear, but even putting Ryle’s own\napplication of the concept aside, his work on category mistakes\ngenerated a lasting philosophical interest in the phenomenon. \n\nSome of the ensuing debates continued the project of attempting to\n demarcate ontological categories using category\n mistakes[4],\n while others focused more directly on\nthe semantic status of category mistakes. In the 1940s and 50s the\northodox view seems to have accepted Ryle’s claim that category\n mistakes are\n meaningless[5],\n so\nmuch so that in his 1954 paper ‘Entities’ Arthur Prior\ncomplained that anyone who takes category mistakes to be false rather\nthan meaningless “must nowadays count themselves among the\nheretics” (Prior 1954, 160). Even in that period, this\northodoxy had its dissenters (Prior 1954; Ewing 1937; and Quine\n1960). For example, in Word and Object, Quine criticized the\nview that took category mistakes to be meaningless as “just a\nspontaneous revulsion against silly sentences” (Quine 1960,\n229). These objectors were primarily focused on refuting the claim that\ncategory mistakes are meaningless and the alleged applications of this\nclaim to metaphysical debates, rather than in offering any positive\naccount of why category mistakes are nevertheless infelicitous. \n\nThe 1960s saw a more direct interest in category mistakes as an\nindependently interesting linguistic phenomenon. In 1966 Drange\npublished an entire monograph devoted to the topic (Drange 1966), and\na lively exchange in the Australasian Journal of Philosophy\nfocused on the question of whether category mistakes are truth-valued,\nwith Lambert and Haack supporting the view (labelled ‘no\ntype’ or ‘falsidal’) that category mistakes are\ntruth-valued and Brady, Goddard, and Routley arguing that they\n are\n not.[6]\n The period between the\nlate 1960s and the early 1980s saw a series of papers attempting to\naccount for category mistakes using a range of tools from formal logic,\nculminating with the publication of the second monograph devoted to\n category mistakes: Lappin\n (1981).[7] \n However, by the mid-1980s the topic of\ncategory mistakes seemed to have fallen out of fashion: for over twenty\nyears it was by and large neglected in the philosophical literature, at\nleast as a self-standing issue. \n\nAlmost entirely divorced from the philosophical debate, category\nmistakes were also extensively discussed in the linguistics literature\n(though almost never under that label—terms used in the\nlinguistic literature for various aspects of the phenomenon include\n‘selectional violations’, ‘selectional\nrestrictions’, ‘semantic anomaly’ ‘sortal\npresuppositions’). Here the driving figure of the debate was Noam\nChomsky. In his 1957 monograph Syntactic Structures, Chomsky\nmaintained that the now-famous category mistake ‘Colorless green\nideas sleep furiously’ is grammatical but meaningless, using this\nclaim to support his contention that syntax is an autonomous field from\nsemantics. The claim was further developed in Fodor & Katz’s\ninfluential paper ‘The structure of semantic theory’ (Fodor\n& Katz 1963), where they claimed that the ability to recognize\nwhich sentences are ‘semantically anomalous’ (their term\nfor category mistakes) was a crucial component of linguistic\ncompetence. Moreover, they developed a semantic framework which\npredicted that category mistakes are (grammatical but) meaningless.\nHowever, in his 1965 book Aspects of the Theory of Syntax\nChomsky revised his view of category mistakes, now arguing that they\nare ungrammatical, and offering a syntactic theory which\nrendered them syntactically ill-formed (cf. §3.1). The theory\nfollowed many of the technical details of Fodor and Katz’s\ntheory, but this time treating features they took to be semantic as\nsyntactic. \n\nIn the late 1960s category mistakes played a central role in the\nchasm between the followers of Chomsky (whose view was labelled\n‘Interpretative Semantics’), and proponents of a new\nmovement in linguistics labelled ‘Generative Semantics’,\nwhose key proponents were Lakoff, McCawley, Ross, and Postal.\nInterpretative semanticists claimed that sentences were assigned a\nsyntactic structure by an autonomous syntactic module, a structure\nwhich could then be provided as input for semantic interpretation. By\ncontrast, generative semanticists eschewed the sharp distinction\nbetween syntax and semantics, maintaining that the structure of a\nsentence was determined by a combination of so-called syntactic,\nsemantic, and pragmatic considerations. In particular, they labelled\ninfelicitous sentences such as category mistakes as simply\n‘ill-formed’, resisting the attempt to pin down the precise\n source of the\n ill-formedness.[8] \n\nAs in philosophy, by the 1980s dedicated discussions of the\nphenomenon of category mistakes seemed to have died out, although the\nconcept is still routinely mentioned in passing, especially in\nintroductory text-books. The standard view seems to be that category\nmistakes are ‘semantically anomalous’ or\n‘semantically ill-formed’. It is not entirely clear what\nthese labels amount to, but most likely they indicate the view, which\nseems to be accepted by the majority of linguists these days, that\ncategory mistakes are grammatical but meaningless. \n\nHowever, since the early 2000s, the topic of category mistakes has\nbeen experiencing a small revival in both philosophy and linguistics\n(with the division between those two fields no longer\n being\n sharp).[9] \n\nOne way to account for the infelicity of category mistakes is to\nmaintain that they are syntactically ill-formed. The most substantial\ndefense of this approach appeared in Chomsky’s 1965 monograph\nAspects of the Theory of\n Syntax.[10]\n Chomsky’s account proceeds roughly as\nfollows. In addition to assignments of general grammatical categories\nsuch as ‘noun’ and ‘verb’, lexical items also\nreceive what Chomsky calls ‘selectional features’. For\nexample, even though ‘boy’ and ‘sincerity’ are\nboth nouns, the former receives the selectional features\n‘+animate’, and ‘-abstract’, while the latter\nreceives the features ‘-animate’, and\n‘+abstract’. Verbs and adjectives are also marked with\nselectional features, representing, for each argument place, the kinds\nof argument they accept. For example, the verb ‘admire’\nexpects a ‘+animate’ for its subject argument, thus\npredicting that ‘The boy admires sincerity’ is grammatical,\nwhile the category mistake ‘Sincerity admires the boy’ is\nnot.\n  \n\nChomsky’s key argument in favor of the syntactic approach is\nthat the use of selectional features as part of syntax is independently\nmotivated (Chomsky 1965, §4.1). Thus consider the following\nstrings: \n\nAccording to Chomsky, while (1) and (3) are grammatical, (2) and\n(4) are not. But in order to account for this difference, it looks like\nwe need to incorporate something like the selectional features\n‘+/-animate’ into syntax. And, the argument goes, once such\nfeatures have already been incorporated into syntax, a natural account\nof the infelicity of category mistakes follows. \n\nHowever, even if Chomsky’s who/which argument succeeds in\nshowing that syntax should be sensitive to the animate/inanimate\ndistinction, it is not clear that this is sufficient to account for\n category mistakes in\n general.[11]\n For example, Hebrew has a special verb to\ndenote picking grapes (rather than other sorts of fruit), and a special\nverb to denote putting on socks (rather than other kinds of clothing).\nThe following are both category mistakes in Hebrew: \n\nThe problem is that in order to extend Chomsky’s syntactic\napproach to account for such category mistakes, one would need very\nspecific selectional features such as ‘+/-grape’ and\n‘+/-sock’. Of course, this is not a decisive argument\nagainst the syntactic approach—perhaps syntax really should be\nenriched with such a wide array of sectional features. However, it\ndoes undermine the claim that the syntactic approach can be executed\nusing independently motivated syntactic machinery, as clearly no\n(other) syntactic phenomenon requires sensitivity to whether an\nargument denotes a grape. \n\nThere are also some more direct objections to the syntactic\napproach. One issue concerns the fact that one can felicitously embed\ncategory mistakes in other environments. Thus consider the following\nexamples: \n\nWhile embedding the ungrammatical string ‘rides boy the\non’ in the context of propositional attitude reports results in\nungrammatical sentences ((7) and (9)), embedding the category mistake\n‘the number two is green’ in the same environment arguably\n results in felicitous, grammatical sentences ((8) and\n (10)).[12] \n\nAnother potential problem for the syntactic approach has to do with\nthe context sensitivity of category mistakes. Consider the following\nexamples: \n\nWhether or not these sentences exhibit the kind of infelicity\nassociated with category mistakes depends on context: (11) and (12)\nare perfectly felicitous in a context where it is clear that the thing\nI am thinking about/referring to is a pen, but not so in a context\nwhere it is the number two. Similarly, (13) is felicitous in a context\nwhere it is clear that the property I’ve just mentioned the\nproperty of being prime, but not so if it was the property of being\ngreen. This is a problem for the syntactic approach, because whether a\nsentence is syntactically well-formed or not is a context-invariant\nproperty: it cannot vary according to context in this manner. \n\nA second way of accounting for the infelicity of category mistakes is\nto maintain that they are syntactically well-formed but semantically\ndefective. This general approach encompasses several different views.\nTo see why, note that there are various kinds of semantic values that\nare assigned to a single sentence token. First, a sentence is assigned\na general meaning. Without going into too much theory, we can\nthink of the meaning of a sentence as the result of combining the\ndefinitions of each of the words it contains, and also as what the\nsentence shares with its translations into other languages. Thus the\nmeaning of the English sentence ‘I am tall’ is a property\nit shares with the French sentence ‘Je suis grande’.\nSecond, when a sentence is uttered in a particular context, it\nexpresses a particular content. For example, in a context\nwhere Sophie utters the sentence ‘I am tall’ it expresses\nthe proposition that Sophie is tall, and in a context where Jim utters\nthis sentence it expresses the proposition that Jim is tall. Third,\nparticular tokens of the sentence receive\na truth-value—for example, when Sophie utters ‘I\nam tall’, her (token) sentence is true if she is indeed tall,\nand false otherwise. \n\nCorresponding to these three kinds of semantic values are three\ndifferent semantic accounts of category mistakes: according to the\nfirst (‘the meaninglessness view’), category mistakes are\nsyntactically well-formed but meaningless; according to the second\n(‘the contentlessness view’) they are meaningful but lack\ncontent; according to the third (‘the truthvaluelessness\nview’), they are meaningful and have a content, but lack a\ntruth-value (or at least lack one of the two standard truth-values,\ntrue and false). \n\nThe meaninglessness view has been the most popular account of category\nmistakes throughout the history of the debate, and still receives\nconsiderable support from both linguists and philosophers. For\nexample, Beall and van Fraassen (2003, 125) say that “there are\ndifferent ways in which a (declarative) sentence might properly be\ncalled ‘meaningless’. Perhaps the best example involves\nso-called category mistakes” and Sauerland and von\nStechow (2001, 15413) describe sentences such as Chomsky’s\nfamous ‘Colorless green ideas sleep furiously’ as ones\n which “are syntactically well formed but do not make any\n sense”.[13] \n\nThe meaninglessness view is highly intuitive: category mistakes are\nextremely infelicitous and often generate the feeling that they simply\ndo not make any sense. Another advantage of the meaninglessness view is\nthat it arguably has the best chance of providing a clean answer to the\nquestion of how to characterize category mistakes (cf. §1). This\nis so because if category mistakes are grammatical but meaningless,\nthen plausibly, they also constitute the only kind of sentence\nthat have these two features. By contrast, the same does not seem to be\ntrue of any of the other accounts discussed: for example, even if\ncategory mistakes are syntactically ill-formed (§3.1) or suffer\nfrom presupposition failures (§3.4) they are clearly not the only\nkind of strings to have these features. The meaninglessness view might\nalso be motivated by a commitment to a particular favored theory of\nmeaning. For example, a proponent of conceptual role semantics might\nmaintain that category mistakes play no conceptual role, and thus are\n predicted by the theory to be\n meaningless.[14] \n\nHowever, the meaninglessness view also faces several serious\nchallenges. First, note that some of the observations raised against\nthe syntactic approach (§3.1) also pose a problem for the\nmeaninglessness view. For example, consider the context sensitivity of\ncategory mistakes. Since in some contexts ‘The thing I am\nthinking about is green’ is entirely innocuous the sentence is\nclearly meaningful. But as with being syntactically well-formed, being\nmeaningful is a context invariant property of a sentence so the\nsentence must be meaningful even in those contexts where the thing I\nam thinking of is the number two. \n\nSimilarly, the fact that category mistakes embed felicitously in\npropositional attitude reports presents at least a challenge to the\nmeaninglessness view: since ‘John said that the number two is\ngreen’, or ‘Jane dreamt that her toothbrush is\npregnant’ are themselves felicitous reports, these reports are\nnot (even by the lights of the meaninglessness view) meaningless. This\nleaves the question of whether it is possible that the report as a\nwhole is meaningful, even though the embedded category mistake is not.\nNote that in the case of the syntactic approach, we were able to test\nhow such embeddings behave using clear examples of syntactically\nill-formed strings, ones which are not themselves category mistakes\n(e.g. ‘John said that rides boy the on’). In this case,\nhowever, matters are much trickier as we do not have any clear examples\nof grammatical but meaningless sentences that are not category mistakes\nwhich we can use to test the behavior of such embeddings. Nevertheless,\nmore theoretical arguments concerning the semantics of attitude reports\nmight bear on the question. For example, if we accept that the meaning\nof a sentence is composed out of the meaning of its constituents and\nthat the relevant ‘that’-clause is a constituent of the\n attitude\n report,[15]\n it follows that the attitude report as a whole cannot be meaningful \nif its constituent category mistake is meaningless. \n\nConsiderations of compositionality (the principle that the meaning of\na sentence is composed of the meaning of its parts), can also be\nbrought to bear more directly on the question of whether category\nmistakes are meaningful. One might be tempted to think that the mere\nfact that a category mistake such as ‘Two is green’ is\ncomposed out of meaningful words arranged in a grammatical way is\nsufficient to trivially entail, given compositionality, that the\nsentence is meaningful. This temptation ought to be resisted, though:\nfor all we have said, the principle of compositionality merely shows\nthat when a sentence has a meaning then that meaning is\ncomposed out of the meaning of its parts. This is not the same as\nsaying that any (grammatical) combination of meaningful parts always\n successfully results in a sentence\n meaning.[16]\n It is thus open to defenders of the meaninglessness view to accept\nthat meaning is compositional, but deny that category mistakes are\nmeaningful. \n\nNevertheless, considerations of compositionality might still pose a\nsignificant challenge to the meaninglessness view. This is so because\ndefenders of the meaninglessness view need to provide a compositional\nsemantic theory that accounts for the meaning of those sentences that\nthey do deem to be meaningful. The problem is that once such a\ntheory provides a systematic recipe for how to assign meanings to\nbenign sentences, there is a risk that an assignment of meanings to\ncategorically mistaken combinations will automatically fall out. To\nillustrate the point, suppose that the semantic theory assigns objects\nto the names ‘Two’ and ‘Desky’ (the number two\nand a particular desk respectively), and the ordinary functions from\nobjects to truth-values to the predicates ‘is green’ and\n‘is prime’. Suppose further that the recursive\nspecification of the theory say that the meaning of any sentence of the\nform ‘\\(a\\) is \\(P\\)’ is the claim that\n\\(f(o)=\\)true, where \\(f\\) is the function denoted by\n‘\\(P\\)’ and \\(o\\) is the object denoted by\n‘\\(a\\)’. Note that even if this theory was only\ndesigned to account for the meaning of standard combinations such as\n‘Desky is green’ and ‘Two is prime’, it also\ninadvertently assigns a meaning to the category mistakes ‘Two is\ngreen’ and ‘Desky is prime’. Of course, one can try\nto amend the semantic theory so that it avoids this consequence, but\nthe question is whether a semantic theory can be constructed that\nsucceeds in assigning meanings to precisely all and only\nnon-categorically mistaken sentences. \n\nA completely different set of challenges to the meaninglessness view\nstems from the fact that while category mistakes are rarely used in\nliteral discourse, they are highly prevalent in figurative speech.\nConsider for example a metaphorical use of ‘The poem is\npregnant’ (by a critic, wanting to describe the richness of the\npoem); a metonymic use of ‘The ham sandwich left without\npaying’ (uttered by a waiter in reference the customer who\nordered the ham sandwich); or uses of category mistakes in fiction (a\nstory containing the sentence ‘The tree forgave the boy’\nor even ‘The number two was happy’). Indeed, the very fact\nthat the sentences in question are category mistakes often serves as\n in indication that the sentence is used figuratively rather than\n literally.[17] \n\nThe very fact that category mistakes have such figurative uses is\nnot in itself a problem for the meaninglessness view: prima facie,\nthere is no contradiction between the claims that, when taken\nliterally, category mistakes are meaningless while when used\nfiguratively, they can be meaningful. However, figurative uses of\nspeech clearly have some connection to their literal meanings,\nwith different theories offering different accounts of this connection.\nThe question then becomes, for each such account of figurative uses,\nwhether it requires the relevant sentence to also be literally\nmeaningful. \n\nConsider the case of metaphor. According to one central view of\nmetaphor, the metaphorical meaning of a sentence is communicated via the\nmechanism of conversational implicature: when one utters a metaphor,\nthe proposition literally expressed by the metaphor blatantly violates\none of Grice’s maxims of conversation (typically the maxims of\nquality or relevance) thus giving rise to an implicated content which\nconstitutes the metaphorical meaning. There is more to say about the\ndetails of the view, but the crucial point for our purposes is that on\nthe Gricean account of metaphor, metaphorical meanings are generated\nindirectly, using the literal content of the sentence. But then in\norder for a sentence to receive a metaphorical interpretation, it must\nalso have a literal meaning, and in particular successful metaphors\nthat are category mistakes are also literally meaningful, pace\nthe meaninglessness view. \n\nA better hope for the meaninglessness view are accounts of metaphor\non which the metaphorical meaning does not depend on the literal\nmeaning of the entire metaphorical sentence, but merely on the meaning\nof some sub-sentential phrases. For example according to Joseph\nStern’s account (Stern 2000), when a sentence is used\nmetaphorically, some of its sub-sentential phrases are embedded under a\nspecial operator called ‘Mthat’, which delivers as an\noutput a new (contextually determined) metaphorical meaning for that\nphrase. Thus on Stern’s view, when used metaphorically the\nsentence ‘The poem is pregnant’ has the deeper structure\n‘The poem is Mthat(pregnant)’, where\n‘Mthat(pregnant)’ can be interpreted in context as, for\nexample, the property of containing many ideas. When we consider such\nsyntactically simple metaphors, Stern’s view seems entirely\nconsistent with the meaninglessness view: at no stage in this\ninterpretation are we required to assign a (literal) meaning to the\nentire categorically mistaken sentence. However, things become more\ndifficult once we consider metaphors with a more complex structure.\nThus consider the following conversation, discussing Jane’s\nresearch: \n\nSally’s second sentence ‘She dropkicked the idea noisily\noff the cliff’ is a metaphor, so on Stern’s view, some\nsyntactic phrase within that sentence should be read as falling within\nthe scope of an ‘Mthat’ operator. Magidor (2017, 70) argues\nthat Mthat must apply here to the entire verb phase (‘dropkicked\nthe idea nosily off the nearest cliff’). But note that Stern\nrequires Mthat to apply to meaningful\n phrases,[18]\nso the entire verb phrase needs to be meaningful.\nInterestingly, however, once one has conceded that the verb phrase is\nliterally meaningful, there is no reason not to take the entire\nsentence to be meaningful as well: the introduction of the subject term\nis entirely innocuous, and if there were any problem arising from\ncategory mistakes being meaningless it should have already arisen at\n the stage where one talks of an idea being dropkicked off a\n cliff.[19] \n\nAnother more general problem for reconciling the meaninglessness view\nwith an account of metaphor is raised by Camp (2004, 225). Camp points\nout that not all metaphors are category mistakes, and indeed some are\nobviously literally meaningful and even true. (Consider for example a\nmetaphorical use of ‘Anchorage is a cold city’.)  This\nposits a dilemma for the meaninglessness view. Either even in such\ncases, the metaphorical meaning is accounted for without making use of\nthe literal meaning of the sentence in which case the account deprives\nitself of some helpful resources in interpreting the metaphor. Or\nelse, the account of metaphor becomes bifurcated—offering one\naccount for metaphors that are also category mistakes and another one\nfor those that are not. \n\nAccording to the contentlessness view, category mistakes are\nmeaningful but fail to express a proposition. An attractive feature of\nthe contentlessness view is that it addresses one of the most pressing\nobjections against the previous two accounts: namely, accommodating the\ncontext sensitivity of category mistakes. Unlike grammaticality and\nmeaningfulness, what content (if any) is assigned to a sentence is not\na context-invariant property. So one can coherently maintain that\n‘This is green’ is perfectly acceptable in contexts where\nthe demonstrative refers to a pen, while lacking content in contexts\nwhere the demonstrative refers to the number two. \n\nThe contentlessness view can be developed in two rather different\nways. The first way to develop the view is particularly attractive to\nthose who accept some kind of radical contextualism about natural\nlanguage: the view that every (or nearly every) expression of natural\nlanguage is context sensitive. Suppose one accepted, for example, that\nthe content of the predicate ‘is green’ is extremely\nsensitive to context (dimensions of sensitivity might include which set\nof shades are being picked by the predicate or which parts of the\nobject need to exhibit the color in order to satisfy it). One might\nthen maintain that in the case of category mistakes such as ‘Two\nis green’, the sentence is so artificial that there simply\nisn’t enough material in the context to determine which property\n‘is green’ denotes, and hence some words in the sentence\n (and ipso facto the sentence as a whole) cannot be assigned a\n content.[20]\n A second, very different way to develop the view assumes that in\ncategory mistakes such as ‘Two is green’, each word\nsucceeds in picking out a content but these contents fail to compose\ntogether to form a unified proposition. \n\nA way to put pressure on the contentlessness view on either of its\nversions is by constructing examples of apparent category mistakes (or\ncategory mistake-like utterances) that are designed specifically to\nensure there should be a content in place. With respect to the first,\ncontextualist proposal we can consider the following sequence, uttered\nin a particular context: \n\nThe first sentence in the sequence uses ‘is green’ in a\nperfectly ordinary context so it is assigned a content in the usual\nmanner (a particular color property). This property is then\nanaphorically referred to in the second sentence. This ensures that\nthe second sentence in the sequence doesn’t suffer from the kind\nof content failure due to insufficient contextual information, despite\nattempting to attribute a color to the number two. \n\nOf course (14) does not pose any problems for the second version of\nthe contentlessness view, which locates the problem with category\nmistakes in the composition of contents (presumably, according this\nversion, the number wouldn’t be able to compose with the color\nproperty referred to anaphorically). However, consider an utterance of\nthe following sentence, in a context where the thing I am thinking\nabout is a table (and where the description is interpreted as\nnon-rigid): \n\nAs uttered in this context the sentence is entirely innocuous, and\nhence clearly expresses a proposition (call this proposition\n‘\\(p\\)’). The problem, however, arises when we evaluate\n\\(p\\) relative to a possible world \\(w\\) in which the thing I am\nthinking about is the number two. (Crucially, note that we are\nevaluating the very same proposition \\(p\\), not the proposition that\nwould have been expressed by (15) had it been uttered in\n\\(w\\)). Relative to \\(w\\), \\(p\\) is a proposition which effectively\nascribes to the number two the property of being green. The example\ndoes not quite provide us with an example of a contentful category\nmistake (arguably, since (15) is actually uttered in the innocuous\ncontext, it is not itself a category mistake), but it does suggest\nthat some propositions succeed in ascribing colour properties to\nnumbers, and hence this kind of predication shouldn’t in general\nbe an obstacle to generating contents. \n\nIn addition to these worries, note that while the contentlessness view\nis well-equipped to address some of the objections against the\nmeaninglessness view (such as the context sensitivity objection), it\nnevertheless shares some of the problems that the meaninglessness view\nfaces. For example, successful embeddings under propositional attitude\nreports present a challenge for the contentlessness view if one\nmaintains that the report as a whole is contentful, and that the\ncontent of the embedded category mistake is a constituent of the\ncontent expressed by the report as a whole. And many views of the\nsemantics of figurative language conflict with the contentlessness\nview as well: for example, the Gricean view of metaphor discussed\nabove requires that category mistakes are not only meaningful but also\ncontentful. \n\nThe third semantic account of category mistakes is one according to\nwhich category mistakes are meaningful, contentful, but lack a\ntruth-value (‘the truthvaluelessness view’). This gets\naround many of the issues raised against previous semantic accounts.\nFor example, in the case of (14) or (15) defenders of the\ntruthvaluelessness view need not deny that there is a proposition\n\\(p\\) which predicates greenness to the number two. They can simply\nmaintain that in such cases the proposition is truth-valueless. The\ntruthvaluelessness view also seems to be better equipped to deal with\nthe embedding problem (there doesn’t seem any obvious issue with\na contentful or even true report that embeds a truth-valueless\nsentence) or the problems to do with figurative language (even if the\nfigurative meaning depends on a literal meaning or content, it does\nnot seem to depend on any literal truth-values). \n\nShaw (2015) proposes another interesting argument in favor of the\n truthvaluelessness\n view.[21]\n Shaw maintains that there is a special mechanism for restricting the\ndomain of quantifiers so as to avoid categorically mistaken statements\nin their scope. Suppose for example that Bob’s yard contains\nseveral planted trees and also a pile of wooden planks lying on the\nground. Now consider the contrast between the following two\nsentences: \n\nIn (16), we seem to be quantifying only over the trees in the yard,\nwhile in (17) we are quantifying over (at least) both the trees and\nthe planks. Shaw argues that this observation cannot be accounted for\nby typical mechanisms of contextual domain restriction, or by\npragmatic considerations such as providing a charitable\ninterpretation. Instead, he proposes, this kind of restriction can be\nexplained by the following two hypotheses: first, language users\nattempt to interpret statements so as to maximize truth-evaluability\n(namely, as having some truth value or other); second, category\nmistakes are truth-valueless. The thought is that if the quantifier\nin (16) is allowed to range over some of the planks, then the open\nsentence ‘Bob uprooted \\(x\\)’ will be a truth-valueless\ncategory mistake relative to assignments where the variable is\nassigned a plank and this will entail the universally quantified\nsentence as a whole is truth-valueless. In order to avoid this\nconsequence and maximize the truth-evaluability of the statement,\ninterpreters restrict the quantifier so as to range only over the\ntrees. \n\nShaw’s argument, however, is not decisive. One issue is that the\nrestriction data is not entirely systematic, in the sense that other\nexamples with exactly the same structure seem to elicit different\nintuitions. For example, consider a context involving a long column of\nletters and numbers randomly mixed together. Suppose John multiplied\nall the numbers in the column by three. The following seems at best\nfalse, possibly infelicitous: \n\nNote that Shaw’s analysis predicts that the quantifier in (18)\nwould be restricted to only the numbers on the page, and thus that the\nutterance should be felicitous and true. Second, even assuming that\nShaw is right that we do systematically restrict domains of\nquantification so to avoid categorically mistaken predications, it is\nnot clear that the claim that category mistakes are truth-valueless is\nessential for this mechanism of domain restriction. Consider any\ntheory that systematically tracks the status of category mistakes as\ninfelicitous (e.g., a presuppositional view, as discussed in\n§3.4). On the face of it, one could equally well explain\nShaw’s data using the alternative hypothesis that the\ncategorically mistaken status of sentences projects into quantified\nstatements in precisely the way that Shaw predicts, and that speakers\nhave a strategy of maximizing the\nfelicity (rather than truth-evaluability) of their\nutterances. \n\nThe truthvaluelessness view also faces some unique challenges. One\nsuch challenge arises from its commitment to the claim that there are\nsentences which express a proposition but are nevertheless\ntruth-valueless. Two widely accepted principles governing the notions\nof truth and falsity are Tarski’s truth-schemas, which can be\nstated thus: \n\nBut as Williamson (1994, 187–198) argues, these principles are\ninconsistent with the claim that there is a truth-valueless\nproposition: For suppose that the proposition that \\(p\\) is neither\ntrue nor false. From (T), since it is not true that \\(p\\), then\nnot \\(p\\). From (F), since it is not false that \\(p\\), then not\nnot \\(p\\). We have now arrived at a direct contradiction:\nnot-\\(p\\) and not-not-\\(p\\). \n\nNote that this is an objection that neither of the previous two\nsemantic accounts of category mistakes face: the Tarskian truth schema\ndo not apply to cases where ‘\\(p\\)’ does not express a\nproposition at all (either because it is meaningless or because it is\nmeaningful but contentless). \n\nOf course, a natural response for defenders of the\n truthvaluelessness view is to reject the Tarskian\n truth-schema.[22] \n Indeed, arguably, the semantic paradoxes such as the Liar already\nmotivate the rejection of the schema for reasons entirely independent\nof category mistakes. Against this, defenders of the schema have\nsuggested that the semantic paradoxes might be addressed in a way that\ndoes not require a commitment to truth-valueless propositions. One\npotential assessment of the dialectical situation is this: perhaps\naccounting for the infelicity of category mistakes is not on its own\nsufficient to ground a rejection of the truth schema, which is\noften thought to be fundamental to our concepts of truth and\nfalsity. However, if the schema ought to be rejected on independent\ngrounds, then applying the apparatus of truth-valueless propositions\nto the case of category mistakes looks attractive. If we accept this\nassessment, then the issue of whether one should accept the\ntruthvaluelessness view turns on the much wider issue of our response\nto the semantic paradoxes. \n\nAs noted at the outset of this subsection, one of the key advantages\nof the truthvaluelessness view over the previous two semantic views is\nthat it does not automatically deem any sentence in which a category\nmistake is embedded to be infelicitous. How does, then, the\ntruthvaluelessness view treat embeddings of category mistake in more\ncomplex sentences, and in particular those involving logical\nconnectives such as disjunction, conjunction, or conditionals? \n\nA range of logics have been developed for determining the truth-values\nof complex sentences in the presence of truth-value gaps. One option\nis to use Weak Kleene logic (WK), on which a complex sentence which\nhas a truth-valueless constituent will always be truth-valueless as\nwell. But assuming the truthvaluelessness view takes a sentence to be\ninfelicitous if and only if it is truth-valueless (at least where the\nlack of truth-value is due to the occurrence of some category\nmistake), this approach will over-predict infelicity. Consider for\nexample the following: \n\nWhile the sentence is perhaps surprising, it seems significantly more\nfelicitous than typical category mistakes, but on the WK treatment it\nwill be deemed truth-valueless and hence predicted to be\ninfelicitous. Other problems occur when we consider how WK treats\nquantified sentences. Consider for example the following: \n\nSuppose the domain contains several concrete objects (including some\ngreen ones), as well as some abstract objects. Intuitively, (20) is\nfelicitous and true (after all, there are some green objects in the\ndomain). However, according to the WK treatment of category mistakes\nthe sentence ought to be truth-valueless. This is so because the\nexistential quantifier scopes over the open formula ‘\\(x\\) is\ngreen’ which is truth-valueless relative to some assignments\n (e.g. ones where \\(x\\) is assigned a\n number).[23] \n\nBoth of these problems are avoided by using Strong Kleene logic (SK)\ninstead. According SK, a sentence with a truth-valueless constituent\nisn’t automatically deemed truth-valueless. Specifically, a\nsentence of the form ‘If \\(A\\) then \\(B\\)’ (with the\nconditional interpreted as material) is true if \\(A\\) is false and\n\\(B\\) is truth-valueless, and an existentially quantified sentence is\ntrue if it has one true instance (even if some other instances are\ntruth-valueless), and thus neither (19) nor (20) would be deemed\ntruth-valueless. However, the SK treatment of category mistakes\npossibly errs in the other direction, namely by under-predicting\ninfelicity. Consider for example the following: \n\nOn a SK treatment of category mistakes, the fact that (21) has one\ntrue disjunct (the second) is sufficient to render it true, and the\nfact that (22) has one false conjunct (the second) is sufficient to\nrender it false. Both sentences are thus predicted by the account to\nbe felicitous. The judgements might not be as clear in these cases,\nbut insofar as one judges these sentences to be infelicitous that is a\nchallenge for the SK approach. \n\nOne additional worry that has been raised against both the WK and the\nSK treatment of category mistakes (Thomason 1972, 231) is that not all\nclassical tautologies are deemed true on these logics. For example,\nboth logics render the following truth-valueless: \n\nWhile this is only to be expected on views which maintain that\n‘the number two is green’ is meaningless or at least\ncontentless, it is arguably a less palatable consequence for the\ntruthvaluelessness view. An alternative view which avoids this\nconsequence is an account of category mistakes using supervaluationist\nlogic. The view is developed in detail in Thomason (1972), but in\nbroad terms it proceeds as follows: a valuation is an assignment of\nthe values true/false to each atomic sentence, where unproblematic\ninstances receive truth values as usual and category mistakes are\nassigned an arbitrary truth value. Complex sentences receive a truth\nvalue relative to each valuation in the standard recursive manner, and\nfinally a sentence is considered true if it is true relative\nto every valuation; false if it is false relative to every\nvaluation; and truth-valueless if it is true relative to some\nvaluations and false relative to others. This ensures that (23) is\ndeemed true because it is true relative to every valuation (one can\nprove that the same holds for all other classical\ntautologies). Moreover, it also deems existential quantifications such\nas (20) true and hence correctly predicts that they are felicitous.\nHowever, as with the SK approach, the supervaluationist treatment of\ncategory mistakes renders both (21) and (22) to be truth-valued, and\nhence (incorrectly?) predicts that they are felicitous. \n\nIn §3.4 we will see yet another version of the truthvaluelessness\nview, which offers a different way of addressing the embedding of\ncategory mistakes in complex sentences. \n\nA third approach to accounting for the infelicity of category mistakes\nis to maintain that they are syntactically well-formed, meaningful,\nand truth-valued but pragmatically inappropriate. \n\nThe most natural way to develop a pragmatic account of category\nmistakes is to appeal to Grice’s maxims of conversation.\nAccording to Grice’s maxim of quality, one ought not to assert\nwhat one believes to be false. Since atomic category mistakes are\n arguably trivially\n false[24],\n it seems obvious to participants in the conversation that the speaker is\nuttering something that they do not believe, violating the maxim. Thus\nunless the speaker is interpreted as attempting to communicate\nsomething other than the literal content of the sentence (e.g. a\nmetaphorical meaning), the utterance would be infelicitous. \n\nOne problem for this approach is that while trivially false sentences\nsuch as \\(2 + 2 = 5\\) are conversationally inappropriate at some\nlevel, they don’t seem to suffer from the kind of severe\ninfelicity that we see with category mistakes. (Indeed, an indication\nof this difference is that, unlike the case of category mistakes,\nthere is no temptation to classify ‘\\(2 + 2 = 5\\)’ as\nmeaningless or even truth-valueless.) Another difficulty for the\naccount as we sketched it is that not all category mistakes are\ntrivially false. Consider the following: \n\nThis sentence seems just as infelicitous as its non-negated\ncounterpart, and yet it is not trivially false (if anything, it seems\ntrivially true). This is not yet a serious problem for the Gricean account\nof category mistakes. The account can be easily extended to address\nthis example as well: according to Grice’s maxim of quantity,\none should make their contribution as informative as required. But\ntrivially true sentences (such as, it is claimed, (24)) are clearly\nnot informative, thus violating the maxim of quantity. There are\ntrickier cases, however, ones of category mistakes that are neither\ntrivially true nor trivially false. Consider for example the\nfollowing: \n\nThis sentence is arguably also infelicitous in the way which is\ntypical of category mistakes, but (assuming category mistakes are\ntruth-valued, as per the pragmatic approach) whether (25) is true or\nfalse depends entirely on the truth value of the second\ndisjunct—which is itself neither trivially true nor trivially\nfalse. \n\nIn the next section (§3.4) we will see a different pragmatic (or\nat least semi-pragmatic) approach. \n\nThe fourth account of the infelicity of category mistakes is one\nthat places this in the context of a broader phenomenon—that of\npresupposition failures. This account comes in several\ndifferent versions, some more semantic and some more pragmatic in\nnature. While each version can be seen as an instance of one of the\naccounts discussed above, it is instructive to discuss these various\n presuppositional accounts in\n tandem.[25] \n\nA widely recognized phenomenon in the study of language is that of\npresupposition. Consider the following sentences: \n\nIt is standardly accepted that these sentences generate, respectively,\nthe presuppositions that France has a king; that George used to smoke;\nand that someone murdered Jack. What precisely this amounts to is a\nmatter of controversy in the theory of presupposition, but as a first\npass we can say that when these sentences are uttered in conversation,\nthe presupposed material is not the main point of the speaker’s\nassertion and that participants in the conversation are expected to\nalready have accepted it. Moreover, when such sentences are uttered in\ncontexts where speakers do not already accept the presupposition, the\nutterance suffers from presupposition failure, and is consequently\ninfelicitous. For example, in current context, an utterance of (26)\nseems infelicitous because we all know France does not have a king,\nand an utterance of (28) is infelicitous in a context where it was not\n already commonly believed that Jack was\n murdered.[26] \n\nA particularly notable feature of presuppositions is that they project\ninto embedded contexts in predictable patterns. For example, it is\nstandardly accepted that if \\(s\\) presupposes \\(p\\) then not-\\(s\\)\nalso presupposes \\(p\\). Thus (29) also generates the presupposition\nthat France has a king, and is therefore equally infelicitous in\ncurrent context: \n\nMore interestingly, it is standardly accepted that if \\(s\\)\npresupposes \\(p\\) (which itself is presupposition free) then both\n‘\\(p\\) and \\(s\\)’ and ‘If \\(p\\) then\n\\(s\\)’ are presupposition-free. This prediction accounts for\nwhy, even in contexts where participants in the conversations do not\naccept in advance that Jack was murdered, the following no longer\nsuffer from presupposition failure:  \n\nThe presuppositional account of category mistakes maintains that\ncategory mistakes are infelicitous because they suffer from\npresupposition failure. Suppose, for example, that the predicate\n‘is green’ triggers the presupposition that its subject has\na color. This means that ‘The number two is green’\ngenerates the presupposition that the number two has a color, a\npresupposition which is assumed to be false in nearly all contexts. A\nkey way to test this presuppositional hypothesis is to check it against\nthe various projection properties for presupposition, and indeed this\ntest seems to lend support to the hypothesis: \n\nNote that (32) is just as odd as the original category mistake. By\ncontrast, while (33) and (34) may be unusual or false assertions, they\ndo not seem infelicitous in a similar manner. These projection\nproperties point to a key advantage of presuppositional accounts: they\nseem to predict a range of data on how category mistakes behave when\nembedded in complex environments. Unlike the WK account (§3.2.3),\nthe presuppositional approach does not assume that every complex\nsentence with a category mistake as a constituent is infelicitous (for\nexample, it predicts that (34) is not infelicitous despite the\nembedded category mistake). On the other hand, unlike the SK and the\nsupervaluationist accounts (§3.2.3), it predicts that sentences\nsuch as the following are infelicitous. (This is so because according\nto the standard projection rules for presupposition, a conjunction\ninherits all the presuppositions of its first conjunct.): \n\nSo far, we have sketched the presuppositional account in very general\nterms. However, there are a variety of different ways to develop the\naccount. A first key question is how presupposition failure affects\nthe truth-value of a sentence. Category mistakes aside, the literature\non presupposition is split between views which maintain that sentences\nsuffering from presupposition failure are truth-valueless, and those\nthat maintain that while presupposition failure leads to infelicity,\nsuch sentences are nevertheless truth-valued. The former approach\nmaintains that ‘The king of France is bald’ is\ntruth-valueless, while the latter deems it to be infelicitous but\nfalse. \n\nAs applied to category mistakes, the former approach yields either a\nversion of the contentlessness view or of the truthvaluelessness\nview—depending on whether one takes presuppositional failure to\nlead to a failure to express content or merely a failure to have a\ntruth-value. (From now on we will assume that this presuppositional\naccount is understood as a version of the truthvaluelessness view.) An\nimportant advantage of this version of the truth-valueless approach\nover the ones discussed previously is that it seems to correctly\naccount for the behavior of category mistakes embedded in complex\nsentences. However, note that the view still predicts that contentful\nsentences can lack truth-value, and more specifically that contentful\ninstances of logical tautologies (e.g. ‘It’s not the case\nthat two is green and two isn’t green’) can fail to be\ntrue. \n\nWhen we apply the latter approach - the claim that presupposition\nfailures do not lead to truth-value gaps—to the case of\n category mistakes, we get a version of the pragmatic\n approach.[27]\n How does this account compare to the Gricean pragmatic account\ndiscussed above? As with other versions of the presuppositional view,\nthis account seems to fare better than the Gricean account in terms of\npredicting the behavior of category mistakes embedded in complex\nsentences. On the other hand, a significant disadvantage of the\npresuppositional account over the Gricean one is that, depending how\n the account is developed, it might require far more linguistic\n stipulations.[28] \n\nA second question which separates different versions of the\npresuppositional account is what kind of presuppositions are involved\nin the case of category mistakes. A natural hypothesis (endorsed by\nAsher (2011)) is that these are type presuppositions. For\nexample, we might suggest that ‘is green’ triggers the\npresupposition that its subject is a concrete object; that ‘is\nprime’ triggers the presupposition that its subject is a number;\nand that ‘is pregnant’ triggers the presupposition that\nits subject is a female. This has the advantage of supporting the\nintuition (borne in their name) that category mistakes have something\nto do with a misclassification of kinds or\ncategories. However, Magidor (2013, 139–146) argues that the\npresuppositions involved are more specific that this: for example,\nthat the subject has a color in the case of ‘is green’, or\nthat it is either prime or composite in the case of\n‘prime’. Her argument relies on discourses such as\nthese: \n\nThese discourses seem entirely felicitous even though the final\nsentence in each discourse violates the proposed type presupposition.\nIn response a proponent of the type-presuppositional hypothesis might\nsuggest reverting to a different type-based hypothesis. For example, in\nresponse to (36) they might suggest that the presupposition generated\nis that the subject-term is a mathematical object. However,\nthis new proposal might be too liberal and because it fails to account\nfor why ‘2.145 is prime’ is a category mistake and it might\nalso be too restrictive because it fails to account for other versions\nof the argument, where an expert suggests that a non-mathematical\n object can be prime as\n well.[29]\n So the question remains whether we can find a suitable kind to play the\nrelevant role here. \n\nA final question which separates different versions of the\npresuppositional account is the issue of what determines whether the\npresupposition is satisfied or not on a particular occasion. According\nto Asher (2011), the lexicon encodes the type that each lexical item\nbelongs to, and this in turn determines whether the relevant\npresupposition—a type presupposition on his view—is\nsatisfied. This lexical approach, however, faces similar problems to\nthose which we have seen with the meaninglessness view. The lexicon\ncannot predict that the following subject terms are of the wrong type\nin those contexts where the definite description or the demonstrative\npick out the number two: \n\nOne feature of the lexical approach which is worth highlighting is\nthat it sets apart the case of category mistakes from other instances\nof presupposition failures: clearly, it is not the lexicon that tells\nus whether John used to smoke, and hence whether ‘John stopped\nsmoking’ suffers from presupposition failure. This can be seen\neither as a disadvantage of the approach (because it does not\nassimilate category mistakes smoothly into the more general theory of\npresupposition) or as an advantage (because it might help explain what\nis distinctive about the infelicity associated with category\nmistakes). \n\nAn alternative approach, one that is applicable to presuppositions\nmore generally, is to maintain that it is worldly facts which\ndetermine whether the presupposition is satisfied or not. Thus for\nexample, ‘John stopped smoking’ suffers from\npresuppositional failure if and only if John in fact used not to smoke and\nsimilarly ‘The thing Jill is thinking about is green’\nsuffers from presupposition failure if Jill is thinking about the\nnumber two, but not if she is thinking about a table. According to a\nthird proposal, one in the spirit of Stalnaker (1973), what matters\naren’t the actual facts, but rather which propositions\nare taken for granted by the participants in conversation. To\nsee how this differs from the ‘worldly’ approach, note\nthat on this Stalnakerian approach to presupposition, ‘John\nstopped smoking’ would suffer from presupposition failure in a\ncontext where participants take it for granted that John never did\nsmoke, even if they are wrong and John in fact used to smoke. \n\nIn so far as our primary aim is to account for the infelicity of\ncategory mistakes, this might point to an advantage of using the\nStalnakerian approach to presupposition over the worldly one. Consider\nfor example, an utterance of: \n\nThis utterance would be infelicitous in a context where participants\ntake for granted that Jill is thinking about the number two (even if\nin fact she is thinking about a table), and felicitous in a context\nwhere it is taken for granted that Jill is thinking about a table (even if in fact she is thinking about a the number two), so the\nStalnakerian view predicts that presupposition failure patterns\nexactly with the infelicity characteristic of category\nmistakes. Moreover, the Stalnakerian approach seems to be particularly\nwell-suited for explaining why the infelicity of category mistakes\nvaries across a range of contextual settings. Consider, for example,\nthe following: \n\nIn contexts where it is taken for granted that priests are male, (41)\narguably functions as a category mistake. However, in other\ncontexts—ones where speakers are aware of churches that ordain\nfemale priests—the sentence can be entirely felicitous. And\nindeed, the Stalnakerian approach predicts that whether the sentence\nsuffers from the relevant presupposition failure depends precisely on\nwhat is taken for granted in conversation. \n\nIt is worth noting, however, that a presuppositional account of\ncategory mistakes which relies on the ‘worldly’ conception\ncan also account for these infelicity patterns, albeit in a more\nindirect way. The account can maintain that infelicity depends not on\nactual presupposition failure, but on being believed (perhaps falsely)\nto suffer from presupposition failure.  \n\nWe have seen that there are various choice points for how to develop a\npresuppositional account of category mistakes. It might be thought to\nbe an advantage of the presuppositional account of category mistakes\n(on any of its versions) that it utilizes an independently motivated\nlinguistic theory. However, a significant disadvantage of utilizing\nsuch a theory is that it makes it harder for the presuppositional\napproach to account for what is distinctive about the infelicity of\ncategory mistakes, i.e., what distinguishes their infelicity from other\ncases of presupposition failure and explains why category mistakes\n form a distinctive and unified phenomenon (cf.\n §1).[30] \n\nIn addition to the intrinsic interest in the phenomenon of category\nmistakes, which account of category mistakes is adopted also has a\nrange of implications for other debates. In this section we will\nsurvey a few of these (this survey is not intended to be\nexhaustive). \n\nDebates about category mistakes have substantial implications for some\nfoundational questions in philosophy of language and linguistics.\nConsider the question of how to formulate the principle of\ncompositionality. It is widely accepted that meaning is in some sense\ncompositional, but there are many non-equivalent ways to elaborate\nwhat precisely this amounts to. One hypothesis which originates in the\nwork of Richard Montague but has been substantially developed by\nPauline Jacobson (and others), is the idea of  direct\n compositionality[31]:\n “the hypothesis that the syntax and the semantics work \n‘in tandem’. The syntax builds expressions and the\nsemantics works to assign meanings to the representations as they are\nbuilt in the syntax” (Jacobson 2012, 109). As Jacobson argues,\nthe hypothesis of direct compositionality is attractive for a number\nof reasons: it is theoretically parsimonious, unifying the\ncompositional theories of syntax and semantics, and it explains why\nsemantic composition seem to proceed in a local fashion: the\nmeaning of each sub-sentential expression is computed using only the\nmeanings of its syntactic constituents rather than using material in\nother parts of the sentence. But as Jacobson remarks, “Direct\nCompositionality entails that there are no syntactic expressions of\nany sort, which do not have a meaning” (Jacobson 2012,\n110). Note that this entails that the direct compositionality\nhypothesis is inconsistent with the meaninglessness view of category\nmistakes and thus the question of how to account for the infelicity of\ncategory mistakes interacts with the question of which formulation of\nthe principle of compositionality ought to be adopted. \n\nOther accounts of category mistakes have implications for different\nfoundational issues. For example, we have seen that the\ntruthvaluelessness view is committed to the existence of\ntruth-valueless propositions, which in turn conflicts with the\nTarskian truth-schema. For another example, consider the\npresuppositional account of category mistakes (on any of its\nversions). If the presuppositional account is correct, then the set\nof presupposition triggers is much wider than has previously been\nassumed: presupposition triggers are not restricted to a small number\nof special words like ‘know’ or ‘the’, but\nrather encompass at least most adverbs and adjectives in natural\nlanguage. This in turn has a variety of implications for\nthe triggering problem: the question of why particular\nlexical items trigger their respective presuppositions, and the issue\nof whether this question can be answered based on general pragmatic\nprinciples, or rather by maintaining that presupposition triggers are\n simply a conventionally encoded aspect of\n language.[32] \n\nOne’s account of category mistakes also has implications for\nmore specific questions in the philosophy of language. We have seen\n(§3.2.1) that the meaninglessness view of category mistakes is\narguably incompatible with a range of accounts for the semantics of\nmetaphor. This means that one should either reject the meaninglessness\nview, or else offer a theory of metaphor that is compatible with the\nview. Another area where the debate on category mistakes is important\nis the semantics of fictional discourse. Consider a sentence such as\n‘A famous detective lives in 221b Baker Street’. There is\na sense in which the sentence seems true (contrast it with ‘The\nfamous detective was called ‘Watson’’ which seems\nfalse). However, the sentence isn’t true on its most\nstraightforward literal reading. One popular view on how a true\nreading of such sentences can be generated (see, e.g., Lewis 1978), is\nto assume that the fictional sentence is within the scope of an\n(unpronounced) operator, so the sentence is taken to express a claim\nof the form: ‘According to the Sherlock Homes stories, a famous\ndetective lives in 221b Baker Street’, a claim which is\nstraightforwardly true. Recall, however that fictions can often\ncontain categorically mistaken sentences; for example, “Once\nthere was a tree and she loved a little boy” (Silverstein\n1964).  But if the fictional sentence \\(s\\) is either meaningless or\neven contentless, then arguably, even after embedding it in the\npropositional operator ‘according to the story’, we will\nget a contentless ascription (cf. Friend 2007, 143). The upshot is\nthat the operator view of fictional discourse is incompatible with\nboth the meaninglessness view and the contentlessness view of category\nmistakes. \n\nEven if one accepts that category mistakes are contentful, uses of\ncategory mistakes in fiction have significant implications for the\nphilosophy of language. For example, Nolan (2015) argues that\nfictions involving personified abstract entities (e.g., fiction in\nwhich Death is a character) entail that fictions routinely feature\nsubstantive impossible contents. This observation is important because\nit presents a challenge for accounts of contents which take them to be\nas coarse grained as possible worlds, as on such accounts there is\n only one impossible\n proposition.[33] \n\nWe have seen (§2) that the interest in category mistakes in the\n1930s was fueled by the thought that category mistakes reveal some\ndeep facts about ontological categories. While the project of using\ncategory mistakes to define ontological categories is no longer being\nactively pursued, category mistakes still play an important role in\nother debates in metaphysics. \n\nConsider the debate about the relationship between a material thing\nand its matter. A lump of clay is molded into a statue. According to\nmonists, the lump is identical to the statue. According to pluralists,\nthey are two distinct objects which occupy the same space. A key\nargument in favor of pluralism proceeds as follows: \n\nTherefore, \n\nAn interesting feature of this argument is that (43) is, at least\narguably, a category mistake. This fact can be exploited by both\npluralist and monists in a variety of ways. \n\nFirst, assume that category mistakes are truth-valueless (either\nbecause they are meaningless, or because they are meaningful but\ntruth-valueless).  This poses a problem for the pluralist’s\nargument because if (43) is a truth-valueless category mistake, the\n argument is unsound (one of its premises isn’t\n true).[34]\n The pluralist might respond by arguing that the negation in (43)\nisn’t ordinary descriptive negation but rather an instance\nof meta-linguistic negation, that is the kind of negation\nthat is present in utterances like this: \n\nWhile this might account for why (43) is a felicitous utterance it is\nnot clear that it helps the pluralist: if the negation in (43)\nisn’t standard, then the premise isn’t sufficient to show\nthat the statue and lump genuinely have conflicting properties, and\nare thus distinct. Almotahari (2014) pushes this line even further,\narguing that the sequence ‘The lump is not Romanesque, but the\nstatue is’ indeed involves meta-linguistic negation, but also\nthat a necessary condition on the occurrence of meta-linguistic\nnegation in such contexts is precisely that, if read with ordinary\nnegation, the first clause (‘I am not happy’/‘The\nlump is not Romanesque’) is semantically incompatible with the\nsecond clause (‘I am elated’/’The statue is\nRomanesque’).  This conclusion, claims Almotahari, is\ndetrimental for the pluralist: in order to involve meta-linguistic\nnegation the two clauses must be (when taken literally) incompatible,\nbut they can only be incompatible if the statue is identical to the\nlump, which is precisely the monist’s contention. Interestingly,\nthe claim that category mistakes are truth-valueless offers the\npluralist a rejoinder to Almotahari’s argument: if we assume\nthat two statements are semantically incompatible just in case they\ncannot be simultaneously true, then the two clauses might be\nincompatible not because the statue is identical to the lump, but\nsimply because one of the two claims is a\n truth-valueless category mistake and hence in itself never\n true.[35] \n\nThe claim that (43) is a category mistake can play a role in this\ndebate even if one assumes that category mistakes are truth-valued but\npragmatically infelicitous. Consider a monist who accepts that the\nlump and the statue are identical and reads the negation in (43) as\nordinary descriptive negation. This would render the pluralist’s\nargument to be simply unsound: if the statue is Romanesque and lump is\nidentical to it, then the lump is Romanesque as well and (43) is\nfalse.  However, there is still a burden on the monist to explain why\n(43) seems to many to be true. This is where an account of category\nmistakes might come into play. Speakers often confuse pragmatic\ninfelicity with falsity. So if ‘The lump of clay is\nRomanesque’ is pragmatically infelicitous (because it is a\ncategory mistake), speakers might mistakenly take it to be false\n(rather than true and infelicitous) and hence assume its negation\n is\n true.[36] \n\nFinally, irrespective of the semantic status of category mistakes,\nthe pluralist can present a somewhat different challenge to monism: if,\nas the monist claims, the statue is identical to the lump, how can the\nmonist account for the fact that ‘The lump is Romanesque’\nis a category mistake, while ‘The statue is Romanesque’ is\nnot? Whether the monist can respond to this challenge depends on the\nprecise details of one’s account of category mistakes, and to\nwhat extent substituting co-referential terms preserves the relevant\nkind of infelicity. \n\nNext, consider a different debate at the intersection of philosophy of\nlanguage and metaphysics, one concerning the phenomenon of\ncopredication. Imagine a context where three copies of War and\nPeace are on the shelf. Each of the following seems to have a\ntrue reading: \n\nA natural way to account for these diverging readings is to posit\ntwo respective readings of ‘book’: one on which it is used\nto pick out physical books (of which we have three), and one on which\nit is used to pick out “informational” books (of which we\nhave one). However, on further reflection this still leaves a puzzle\nconcerning (47): if ‘book’ in this sentence picks out an\ninformational book (arguably a kind of abstract entity), how can this\nkind of object have the physical property of being on the shelf? These\nkind of apparently ‘mixed’ reading are referred to in the\nliterature as instances of copredication. \n\nSome solutions to this puzzle involve constructing non-standard\nsemantic and syntactic structures for copredicational sentences (e.g.,\nAsher 2011; Gotham 2017), but Liebesman and Magidor (2017) argue that\nsentences such as (47) should be taken at face-value: the sentence is\nabout informational books, but on their view, informational books can\nhave physical properties such as being on shelves. \n\nA central challenge for this view is that it requires us to\ndistinguish between (47) and clearly infelicitous category mistakes\nsuch as: \n\nTo sharpen the problem, consider any theory of category mistakes which\naccounts for the infelicity of (48) by maintaining that locational\nproperties such as ‘on the shelf’ are restricted so as to\nonly apply to physical objects (whether the nature of the restriction\nis syntactic, semantic, or pragmatic). This predicts that if (47) has\nthe structure Liebesman and Magidor attribute to it (namely, a\nstraightforward predication of the locational property to an\ninformational book), the sentence should have resulted in an\ninfelicitous category mistake. Liebesman and Magidor (2017,\n148–9) respond to this worry by arguing that the restriction\nplaced by ‘on the shelf’ is not a type restriction such as\n‘is a physical object’, but rather a more specific\nrestriction, such as ‘has a location’ (we have seen this\nidea in §3.4 in the context of the presuppositional approach,\nthough it could in principle be adopted by proponents of any of the\nsemantic accounts as well). This more specific restriction allows them\nto account for how (48) can be a category mistake even if (47) is not:\nwhile neither a number nor an informational book are physical objects,\nthe latter but not the former satisfies (so they claim) the property\nof having a location. Whether or not this account of copredication is\naccepted, we see once again how which theory of category mistakes is\nadopted has substantial implications for debates in metaphysics.","contact.mail":"ofra.magidor@philosophy.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"philosophy.ox.ac.uk"}]
