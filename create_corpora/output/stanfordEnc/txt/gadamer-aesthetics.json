His approach to art runs, in many ways,\nagainst conventional philosophical expectations. Aesthetic qualities\nare not debated in the manner of the analytic tradition of modern\nphilosophy, nor does he concern himself overtly with the problems of\naesthetic pleasure. Gadamer’s approach to aesthetic experience stands\nsquarely in the phenomenological tradition. He is primarily concerned\nwith the place of art in our experience of the world. Furthermore, his\napproach to aesthetic theory is one of those rare intellectual\nachievements which are simultaneously deconstructive and\nconstructive. He dismantles elements of the grand tradition of\nPlatonic, Kantian and Hegelian aesthetics and yet offers a\nphenomenological reconstruction of many of the central insights of\nthat tradition to demonstrate its continuing relevance to our\ncontemporary experience of art. Gadamer is primarily concerned with\nthe cognitive dimension of such experience, with what artworks\naddress and what they put at issue. This makes for a flexible\nphilosophical approach capable of ranging freely over a number of art\nforms and styles, discussing both the singularity of works and their\nbroader significance. The approach is clearly hermeneutical in that it\nendeavours to reacquaint us with those received meanings and\npreoccupations which underlie our experience of art. Openly\ninfluenced by Heidegger, the later essays on language and poetry in\nparticular, Gadamer’s aesthetics is far from traditional. His key\nclaims are: \n\nAesthetics is not the study of specific types of subjective\npleasures derived from art. It is a study of what objectively informs\nour subjective awareness of art.\n\nHermeneutical aesthetics seeks to break through the pleasurable\ndistractions of aesthetic consciousness in order to disclose the\ncultural and linguistic realities that manifest themselves within\nit.\n\nHermeneutical aesthetics presupposes phenomenological involvement\nwith the subject matters of art rather than disinterested\ndetachment.\n\nHermeneutical aesthetics regards aesthetic appearance not as a\ndistraction from the real but as the vehicle through which real\nsubject matters reveal themselves. It overturns the notion that\nartworks are at one remove from reality.\n\nHermeneutical aesthetics is dialogical in character. It recognises\nthat practitioner and theoretician share in bringing a subject matter\nto light and plays down any theory/practice division in the\narts. Interpretation is a means to a work’s realisation.\n\nHermeneutical aesthetics is not a theory of art per se,\nmore a set of practical contemplative notes for enhancing one’s\nencounter with art. The end of hermeneutical aesthetics is not to\narrive at a concept of art but to deepen our experience of art. In\nhermeneutical aesthetics, theory is deployed to deepen contemplation\nof artworks rather than to categorise their nature.\n\nGadamer’s aesthetics is deeply respectful of art’s ability to\ndisrupt and challenge customary expectations. It attributes an ethical\nsignificance to art as being able to reveal the limitations of fixed\ncultural expectancy and to open the spectator towards the other and\nthe different.\n\n\n\nIn this entry, we discuss the leading arguments which inform these\ncontentions.\n\n\nGadamer’s aesthetics fosters an attentiveness towards the mystery of\nthe given and its unexpected folds of meaningfulness. Gadamer’s\narguments are varied, ushering the reader towards an aesthetic\nattentiveness rather than making iconoclastic declarations about what\nthe aesthetic is. They embrace close readings of the poets Rilke and\nCelan as well as broad strategic manoeuvres which defend the cognitive\nstatus of aesthetic and hermeneutical judgements. Hermeneutics (the\nart and discipline of interpretation), of which Gadamer is one of the\ntwentieth century’s most formidable exponents, is deeply involved in\nphilosophical disputes over the legitimacy of claims to understanding\nin the visual and literary arts. It does not oppose\n“scientific” modes of knowledge but resists their cultural\nprivileging. For Gadamer aesthetics stands on experientially\naccumulative modes of learning (Bildung) which orientate and\nground sound judgement in the arts. Conversation and its unpredictable\nturns is, appropriately, a central thread within hermeneutical\naesthetics. A late exchange between Carsten Dutt and Gadamer (Dutt\n1993, 61–67) offers a gentle point of entry into how\nphilosophical hermeneutics approaches art and aesthetic\nexperience.  Gadamer insists that a picture or image that is worthy of being\ncalled a work of art, has the power to affect us immediately. (GW 8,\n374). Art addresses us. The claim that a work of art “says\nsomething to someone” (Palmer 2001, 70) alludes to the surprise,\nshock and, sometimes, dismay at being directly affected by what is in\na work and of being forced to reflect on its claim so that it becomes\nmore understandable to both oneself and others. Gadamer argues that\n“the experience of art is an experience of meaning, and as such\nthis experience is something that is brought about by\nunderstanding” (Palmer 2001, 70).  To this extent, then,\n“aesthetics is absorbed into hermeneutics” (Palmer 2001,\n76). This distances Gadamer from more conventional justifications of\nthe aesthetic as offering a special kind of pleasure. The\nessay The Relevance of the Beautiful suggests that “the\nmere onlooker who indulges in aesthetic or cultural enjoyment from a\nsafe distance, whether in the theatre, the concert hall, or the\nseclusion of solitary reading, simply does not exist” (RB\n130). A person who takes himself to be such an onlooker,\nmisunderstands himself. “Aesthetic self-understanding is\nindulging in escapism if it regards the encounter with the work of art\nas nothing but enchantment in the sense of liberation from the\npressures of reality, through the enjoyment of a spurious\nfreedom” (RB 130). These remarks divorce Gadamer’s thinking from\nDilthey’s Erlebniss-Ästhetik in which artworks are\nproclaimed the site of intense but momentary experience enjoyed for\ntheir own sake independent of their cognitive content. The hedonistic\npersonalisation of aesthetic response has two alienating\nconsequences. On the one hand, the judgement that aesthetic experience\nis purely subjective severs the individual from communal networks of\nmeaning capable of illuminating personal experience from the\nperspective of what is socially shared. On the other, attempts to\nrender subjective experience academically legitimate by presenting it\nas a social product further estrange the individual from his\nexperience, by translating it into third-person terms he or she may\nnot endorse or recognise: individual experiences of beauty can\nsuddenly become embodiments of class prejudice. In contrast to Dilthey\n(1833–1911), Gadamer defends\nan Erfahrungs-Ästhetik which claims that like\nsignificant life-experiences, our relationships with artworks are deep\nand ongoing: we revisit them and in doing so understanding is\ncontinually renegotiated. Gadamer speaks of the\n“interminability” of such experience (die\nUnabschliessbarkeit aller Erfahrung, Palmer 2001, 66). It is\nforever open because of its cognitive movement. The cumulative nature\nof such experience is an instance of Bildung (formation and\nlearning through experience) and is, as such, a living process of\nbecoming (Werden). \nGadamer’s aesthetics is strictly anti-Kantian. It abjures\nphenomenalist disinterestedness for the sake of phenomenological\ninvolvement. It is also anti-idealist. It refuses the idea that in\naesthetic experience we perceive “a pure integration of\nmeaning”. His aesthetics is consequently\nanti-representationalist. There is in the artwork something which\nGadamer describes as its resistance to integration, to being reduced\nto a concept (Palmer 2001, 25). He contends that Hegel’s definition of\nthe beautiful as the “sensuous appearing of the Idea”\npresumes that aesthetic experience is able to reach beyond the\nspecific type of appearance to its underlying idea. In this model,\naesthetic experience becomes the expectation of a semantic\nfulfilment. Once the idea behind the appearance is grasped, “the\nwhole of its meaning would have been understood once and for all and\nthus ‘brought in to our possession so to speak’”\n(Palmer 2001, 71). The work of art becomes a carrier of meaning, to be\nabandoned once the lead story has been grasped. But, Gadamer argues,\n“our understanding of artworks is manifestly not of this\ntype. Everyone knows this from his or her own encounters with art,\nfrom concerts, visits to museums, and from his or her reading”\n(Palmer 2001, 71).  This denial of idealist aesthetics is at the basis\nof his claim that an artwork is essentially enigmatic. \nGadamer’s opposition to aesthetic idealism is supported by the\nclaim that art “cannot be satisfactorily translated in terms of\nconceptual knowledge” (RB 69). A work does not simply refer to a\nmeaning which is independent of itself. Its meaning is not to be\ngrasped in such a way that that it can be simply transferred to\nanother idiom. Indeed, because it invites many interpretations, an\nartwork acquires an ideality of possible meanings which cannot be\nobviated by any possible realisation (RB 146). The work has,\ntherefore, an autonomy which cannot be substituted by anything else\nor, to put it another way, the work is always in excess of its\nreadings, its meanings are always more than its interpretations. This\nis congruent with Gadamer’s theses that Being exceeds knowing\nand, similarly,that linguistic Being transcends linguistic\nconsciousness.  \nAn important consequence arises from this, namely, Gadamer conceives\nart as presentational (darstellen) rather than\nrepresentational (vorstellen). In the essay “Word and\nPicture” (1992), he claims that he tries “to undermine the\nidea that the picture is a mere copy” (GW 8, 374). As a work\ndoes not represent anything other than itself, the meanings it carries\ncan only come to the fore in its self-presentation. Yet the emergent\nmeaning is never given in its entirety nor obviated by any\nrealisation. This is consistent with the eventual nature of\nart. “When a work of art truly takes hold of us, it is not an\nobject that stands opposite us which we look at in hope of seeing\nthrough it to an intended conceptual meaning … The work is\nan Ereigniss—an event that ”appropriates\nus“ to itself. It jolts us, it knocks us over and sets up a\nworld of its own, into which we are drawn” (Palmer 2001,\n71). What is revealed, however, remains but an aspect of the work\nwhich when it appears drives others into the background. Disclosure\nand hiddenness are not contraries in Gadamer’s aesthetics, but\nmutually dependent: the disclosed reveals the presence of the\nundisclosed in the disclosed. “It is in the sheer being there\n(Da-sein) of the work of art that our understanding\nexperiences the depths and the unfathomability of its meaning”\n(Palmer 2001, 72). The claim that a work’s meaning can never be\ncompletely fulfilled is supported by a linguistic analogy concerning\nthe speculative. Art has a language in that its signs and symbols\nfunction like semantic units. Gadamer comments on the living\nvirtuality of meaning contained in each word, an inner dimension of\nmultiplication. Accordingly, language is not the representation\n(mimesis) of a set of pre-given meanings but a “coming\nto language” of a constant reserve of meanings (Palmer 2001,\n67). The finitude of linguistic expression is such that no utterance\ncan be complete. Nothing comes forth in one meaning that is simply\noffered us (PH 103). “The only thing that constitutes language\n… is that one word leads to another, each word is, so to speak,\nsummoned, and on its side holds open the further progress of\nspeaking” (Palmer 2001, 67). No meaning can be completely\nrevealed. Because we can re-visit artworks repeatedly, the meaning\ndisclosed initially can be expanded or changed. The partial nature of\nany given meaning disclosure enhances rather than diminishes the\npossibility of meaning within a work. “The work of art consists\nin its being open in a limitless way to ever new integrations of\nmeaning” (PH 98) and furthermore, “the inexhaustibility\nthat distinguishes the language of art from all translation into\nconcepts rests on an excess of meaning” (PH 102). \n\nGadamer’s conversation on aesthetics paints its bolder themes: art is\ninterrogative by nature, artworks work through a disclosure\nof meaning, disclosures of meaning establish art’s cognitive status,\nthe cognitive content of art is partly intelligible and partly\nenigmatic, and artworks are always open to re-interpretation. These\nare, however, not free-standing arguments. Gadamer’s position is\nhermeneutical not because of an underlying thesis which goes\nunremarked but because it is informed by a constellation of various\narguments which shape the central position. To the broader arguments\nwe now turn. \n\nGadamer’s determination to reveal the cognitive content of aesthetic\nexperience requires him to expose the ontological grounding of\nsubjectivity. To approach artworks solely on the basis of subjective\nresponses to them or, to read them only in terms of an artist’s\nintentionality, is, for Gadamer, always to miss the\npoint. Hermeneutically speaking, the philosophical focus should be on\nwhat shapes subjectivity and guides its expectations. This initiates a\nspeculative refiguring of aesthetic subjectivity. In Truth and\nMethod he writes, \n\nIn The Relevance of the Beautiful Gadamer elucidates\nsubstance as follows: \n\nUncovering the ontological foundations of aesthetic experience does\nnot undermine the primacy Gadamer gives to art’s immediate\naddress. The aim is to demonstrate the cognitive legitimacy of\nsubjective experience by revealing how aesthetic experience is both\ninvolved in something larger than itself and, indeed, reflects\n(speculum) that larger actuality within itself. The ability\nof aesthetic experience to express trans-individual phenomenological\nstructures explains what is meant by substance and his speculative\nattitude towards it. Gadamer’s aesthetics is properly concerned with\nexperiencing what underlies its more abstract concepts. This\nis not a matter of naming or describing the reality which manifests\nitself in aesthetic experience but of trying to say something about\nthe experience an individual has of it. Gadamer’s reflections commence\nwith the immediacy of art’s claim, its contemporaneous nature, and\nthen explore what influences the experience of that claim. The aim is\nseemingly paradoxical: to understand that which shapes, lies beyond,\nbut only “shows” itself in aesthetic experience. \n\nOf all things that speak to us, it is the artwork that does so most\ndirectly (PH 95). The phenomenological immediacy of art which\ninitiates Gadamer’s hermeneutic enquiry into aesthetic experience may\nnot seem a promising starting point from a hermeneutic perspective. It\ndeclares an unconventional hermeneutical approach to art: “if we\ndefine the task of hermeneutics as the bridging of personal or\nhistorical distance between minds, then the experience of art would\nseem to fall entirely outside its [hermeneutics’] provenance”\n(PH 95/97). However, Gadamer does not define hermeneutics this way. It\nis not the reconstruction of artistic intention which forms the object\nof his enquiry, but the question of what informs the immediacy of an\nartwork’s claim. The artwork is an object of hermeneutical\ninvestigation not because of any provenance in psychological events\nbut because of the fact that it says something to us (PH\n98). Hermeneutic involvement is required because the meaning\ntransmitted can never be fully complete and  unambiguous. It demands\ninterpretive involvement. Hermeneutics is required wherever there is a\nrestricted transposition of thought. The historical finitude of\nmeaning and the fact that no meaning can be given completely\nnecessitates hermeneutical involvement in our experience of an\nartwork. The task of interpretation is to probe the possible meanings\nheld within the experience of a work, and by drawing on them to bring\nthat experience to greater completeness. \n\nIt should be noted that Gadamer’s talk of integrating the alien into\nwhat is understood as meaningful is not to be grasped as subsumption\nwithin the same. Assimilation is not the equivalent of translating the\nalien into a stable set of meanings which do not change as a\nconsequence of that subsumption. Integration implies a reciprocity:\nthe integrated changes its character as well as the character of the\nwhole within which integration occurs. Furthermore, whatever is given\nin subjective consciousness as contemporaneous has dimensions of\nmeaning that transcend what that consciousness initially\ngrasps. Gadamer is concerned to probe the ontic dimensions of\naesthetic experience. The thesis that experience of the\ncontemporaneousness of art involves us in more than what we are\npresently aware of (i.e., the “substance” of underlying\nand on-going trans-individual linguistic and cultural practices) is\nsupported by the three arguments from analogy concerning the character\nof play, the festival and the symbol. \n\nGadamer’s discussion of the relation between art and play should not\nbe equated with any argument that art is a trivial game or pastime. He\nfollows the precedent of Schiller’s Letters on Aesthetic\nEducation, which contend that artworks are dramatic in that\nthey place something in play. The underlying motif is that\naesthetic consciousness is far from self-contained but is rather drawn\ninto the play of something much larger than what is evident to\nsubjective consciousness. The analogy with drama and, indeed, sporting\nevents, implies that art is eventual, an occasion that consciousness\nsurrenders to and participates in. Spectatorial participation (like\nmuch art research) demands immersion in that which cannot be fully\nanticipated or controlled by individual consciousness. The game and\nthe artwork are both forms of self-movement which require that the\nspectator play along with what they bring into being (RB 23). Gadamer\nasserts the “primacy of the play” over consciousness:\n“the players are merely the way the play comes into\npresentation” (TM 92, 98). Participation takes the individual\nplayers out of themselves. The individual subject is that upon which\nsuccess, satisfaction or loss is imposed from within the game. By\nanalogy, the work of art is also “the playing of it”. An\nautonomous event comes into being, something comes to stand in its own\nright which “changes all that stand before it” (RB\n25). Like the ancient theoros, the spectator not only\nparticipates in the event which is the artwork, but is potentially\ntransformed by it (RB 24). \n\nThe game analogy also serves to undermine approaches to art which are\nexclusively intentional, material and conventional. First: the\nsubjectivity of an artist cannot be an appropriate interpretive\nstarting point. Grasping what transpires in a player’s consciousness\ndoes not reveal the nature of the game being played. Reconstructing\nthe conscious life of an artist, pace Dilthey’s hermeneutics\nof nacherleben (re-living), may reveal interesting aspects of\nan artist’s intentions but it does not uncover what informs that\nsubjectivity. Second: as with the game, art is not to be understood\nby reference to its tools and equipment alone. Art requires materials\ncertainly, and an appreciation of how a specific tool might be\nused. Yet neither game nor art is constituted by its equipment. Third:\ncomprehending a game or an artwork requires an appreciation of the\nappropriate rules or conventions. What constitutes fair or foul play\ndepends upon a set of pre-understood principles just as what is\nesteemed excellent in art requires normative expectancies of\nappraisal. Yet art’s vitality clearly does not reside in the following\nof conventions. \n\nThe overall argument is not that game or artwork cannot be reduced to\nintention, material or convention but rather that each of these\nelements comes into their own when taken up within the\nplaying of the game or in the practice which is\nart. It is the playing that draws spectator, player, intention,\nequipment and convention into the one event. This promotes an\ninteractive view of art as a communicative event. It lends a\ndialogical dimension to art. An artwork involves more than one voice\nas, indeed, the word inter-pretation implies. Furthermore,\nthe conception of art as an event requires a different ontological\nstructure to those standard accounts of aesthetic experience grounded\nin subjectivity alone. An artwork is not an object completely\nindependent of the spectator yet somehow given over to the spectator\nfor his or her personal enjoyment. To the contrary, the game analogy\nsuggests that the act of spectatorship contributes to enhancing the\nbeing of the artwork by bringing what is at play within it to fuller\nrealisation. The spectator just as much as the artist plays a crucial\nrole in developing the subject-matters that art activates. The\naesthetic spectator is swept up by her experience of art, absorbed in\nits play and potentially transformed by that which spectatorship helps\nconstitute. Though Gadamer’s argument distances itself from\ntraditional subject-object paradigms, it does retain certain features\nof Kant’s aesthetics. \n\nWhereas Kant attributes a non-purposive rationality to the aesthetic\nattitude, Gadamer attributes it to the playful process of art practice\nitself. Both art and the game share a to-and-fro movement not tied to\nany specific goal other than to fulfil themselves for their own sake\n(TM 103): no one knows how a game will end and no one knows to what\nend an artwork works (Lawn 2006, 91). However, what is clear is that\nit is what occurs when the artwork or the game is in-play that\nmatters. Often contrary to their own willing and doing, the spectator\nis taken over by a substantial and consequential event that transcends\nthe boundaries of everyday consciousness and which has no purpose\nother than to bring something forth. \n\nConventional accounts of aesthetic experience stress its intense and\nindividuating nature (Erlebniss). Yet despite its intimacy,\nGadamer emphasises that within experience (Erfahrung) one is\nalways participating, perhaps unwittingly, in something beyond\noneself. Aesthetic involvement is in some respects, therefore, a\ncommunal activity. The analogy between aesthetic experience and the\nfestive is telling. \n\nGadamer’s thinking here betrays a further Kantian inflection. The\nKantian conception of aesthetic pleasure, as a variety of experience\nwhich arises only where the egotistical interests that constitute the\ncommerce of everyday life are not in play, suggests the possibility of\na community forming around shared non-hostile pleasures. Gadamer’s\naccount of aesthetic experience is not concerned with a putative\nkingdom-to-come but with rediscovering and forging the communality\nthat we are. Despite this difference, aesthetic experience establishes\nfor both thinkers a meditative space in and through which something\ncan be occasioned. The underlying point remains. Whereas for Kant it\nis a change in the disposition of subjective consciousness (i.e., its\nadoption of an aesthetic attitude) which initiates a better\ndisposition towards the community, for Gadamer it is the participation\nin a trans-subjective event which effects a change in subjective\ndispositions towards the community.  When Gadamer argues that “the mystery of festive celebration\nlies in this suspension of time”, he refers to how festivity\nsuspends work-time. This initiates that “play-time” in\nwhich another order of events emerges. It is in such time that an\nartwork “comes to stand” irrespective of whether it is a\npainting, drama or symphony. The festive “represents a genuine\ncreation, [for] something drawn from within ourselves takes shape\nbefore our eyes in a form that we recognise and experience as a more\nprofound presentation of our own reality” (RB 60). This\ndistances Gadamer from the view that aesthetic experience is a\nsolitary subject’s personal response to an artwork. In the\nfestive—an analogy for the communal dimensions of aesthetic\nexperience—the individual subject comes to stand differently in\nits relationship to others. Just as the artwork comes to stand in the\nfestival, so too does the artwork bring its spectators to stand as a\ncommunity: “in the festive the communal spirit that supports us\nall and transcends each of us individually represents the real power\nof the festive and indeed the real power of the art work” (RB\n63). The festival occasions individuals surpassing their everyday view\nof themselves as potentially hostile competitors and coming to see\nthemselves as a community formed around a shared interest in what the\nartwork brings forth. This is an analogy for something more\nfundamental. \n\nInstrumentalist conceptions of language persuade us that the spoken\nand written word are but communicative tools, but for Gadamer\nparticipation in language acknowledges that an individual is located\nwithin a substantive horizon of meanings which transcends subjective\nconsciousness. Pragmatic concerns encourage the forgetting of such\ninterconnectedness but when such individualism is suspended by the\nfestival or, indeed, by the adoption of an aesthetic attitude, the\nre-discovery of oneself as belonging to an extensive community of\nshared meanings and involvements becomes possible. The artwork’s\ncommunicative capacity awakens the realisation that in as much as I\nunderstand myself as being addressed, I must acknowledge that I\nalready belong to something larger than myself. The artwork\nfestivises: it reveals our personal indebtedness to past and\nfuture communities of meaning. The thesis that we belong to a\nhermeneutic collective which is the effective underpinning of art’s\nability to communicate is further elaborated in Gadamer’s discussion\nof the symbol. \n\nA discussion of the symbol forms the third aspect of Gadamer’s case\nthat aesthetic experience involves an ex-stasis of the aesthetic\nsubject. It provides a further analogue for the speculative dimension\nof aesthetic experience. The word “symbol” is a Greek term\nfor a token of remembrance (tessera hospitalis) that could be\nbroken in two so that should a descendent of a former guest enter his\nhouse, the co-joined pieces would kindle into an act of\nrecognition. (RB 31). The symbol connotes (explicitly) what we\nrecognise implicitly (RB 31). It is associated with the fragmentary\nand a promise of completeness which “in turn alludes to beauty\nand the potentially whole and holy order of things”\n(RB 32). The symbol is associated, then, with notions of repetition\nand the hope for an abundance of meaning. Its connection with the\nspeculative is best appreciated by reference to the sign. \n\nIf the sign’s proper function is to refer to its referent, it is\nself-cancelling. The road sign that is so attractive that it distracts\nfrom the danger it refers to and causes a new one by prompting drivers\nto pull up and admire it, does not function properly. The symbol,\nhowever, does not refer to something outside itself. It presents its\nown meaning. The material symbol is, indeed, the place where that\nmeaning becomes present. Yet the symbolically delivered meaning is\nnever given completely. Its meaning is indeterminate. References to\nthe symbol as fragmentary nevertheless anticipate the possibility of\nwholeness. The speculative dimension of such reasoning resides in the\npremise that every stated meaning involves bringing forth more than is\nactually spoken. Resonance and depth depends upon animating the\nstatement’s hermeneutic Hintergrund, lighting up unstated\nmeanings or revealing anticipated ones. The “speculative”\ncapacity of an image or word concerns its ability to sound out or\ninsinuate the unstated nexus of meanings which sustain a given\nexpression but which are not directly given in it. The speculative\npower of an image or phrase has something in common with the sublime:\nit illuminates in the spoken or visual image a penumbra of unstated\nmeanings whose presence can be sensed but never fully grasped or\nconceptualised. Hence, an artwork can always mean more, that is,\ninsinuate a transcendent dimension of meaning which though never\nexhausted by the symbols which carry it do not exist apart from the\nsymbols that sustain it. The symbol is resonant with the suggestion of\nmeaning because it constantly invokes what is not immediately\ngiven. This not-given does not exist apart from the given but is\ninherent within it. Hence, the hermeneutical sublime, the excess of\nmeaning, the promise of meaning more and meaning something different\nwhich is made apparent by the symbol, is held within, is immanent in\nthe given. \n\nGadamer’s account of the symbol establishes that artworks are\npresentational rather than representational. Presentations occasion\nthe meanings they invoke and do not represent a meaning independent of\nthemselves. The argument effects a profound and significant change in\nthe meaning of aesthetic appearance. The representational view of art\nrelegates art to a secondary status: the artwork brings to mind\nsomething other than the artwork, an original state of affairs, a\nspecific meaning or reality. Art’s objective co-relative is,\naccordingly, positioned outside the work so that the work becomes the\nmere appearance of something else. The presentational account of art\nis consistent with Gadamer’s phenomenological orientation. If the\nmeaning invoked by a work is not independent of the work that summons\nit, the work is the occasion of the coming-into-appearance of that\nmeaning. Appearing becomes synonymous with original\ncreation. Aesthetic appearance is not secondary to reality or truth\nbut is the medium through which the work’s truth shows/presents\nitself. Even as presentation, appearance does retain a certain\nnegativity, though in Gadamer’s hands it has a positive\nquality. Appearance always hints at a semblance of something incomplete\nor not yet fully realised. Gadamer’s ontology openly reinforces if\nnot requires such negativity. The claim that each artwork has its own\ntemporality implies that each will never reveal itself completely. The\nclaim that the reception of all art is contemporaneous dictates that\nwhat appears to us as meaningful is not necessarily what appeared to a\nprevious generation as meaningful. Like the symbol, appearance is\nalways partial. However, appearance, when considered aesthetically,\nhas the cadence of the symbolic: it alludes to something beyond itself\nbut which nevertheless inheres within it as the\nyet-to-be-revealed. \n\nSuch arguments support Gadamer’s conception of the artwork as that\nwhich stands-in-itself. That which comes to stand is intelligible as\nthe presentation of a certain meaning, but because of the\nindeterminacy of that meaning it retains something of the\nenigmatic. This eminent quality—a genuine work can never be\nmeasured against the original way it was shown (RB 146)—Gadamer also\nrefers to as its hermeneutic identity. The truth of an artwork is not\nits simple manifestation of meaning but rather the unfathomableness\nand depth of its meaning (PH 226). Its truth embraces a tension\nbetween revelation (what appears) and what is concealed (what has yet\nto be shown). The artwork does not simply offer “a\nrecognisable surface contour” but has an inner depth of\nself-sufficiency which Gadamer calls after Heidegger a\n“standing-in-itself”. In short, the mark of a substantial\nwork is that it veils possibilities of meaning. Such resistance is a\nstimulus to further interpretation. Substantive works, like\nsignificant symbols, have an opaque aspect. \n\nThe symbol and its reticence about revealing the withheld aspects of\nits meaning do not connote something utterly alien to us. The\nyet-to-be revealed is a dimension of meaning overlooked, forgotten, or\nnot perceived within what has already been shown or grasped. In other\nwords, the power of the symbol resides in its ability to reveal that,\nunbeknown to ourselves, we are in communion with something much larger\nthan ourselves, that is, horizons of meaning which implicitly sustain\nreflection and which can, when made explicit, bring us to think quite\ndifferently of ourselves. The mystery of the symbol is its promise of\ntranscendence: an effective and affecting symbol reveals that we\nbelong to a hermeneutic community always larger than we envisage. The\nanalogy of the festival, once again, is telling. In the festival,\nindividuated work roles are renounced as we rediscover communal\nties. Gadamer’s arguments about play, festival and symbol serve, then,\nas the basis for his claim that aesthetic experience, our experience\nof art, is a demonstrable instance of how subjectivity is informed by\na substantiality that transcends an individual consciousness. \n\nGadamer’s aesthetics involve a variety of interlocking arguments, one\nof the most significant of which concerns the Sache\nselbst. The term is difficult to translate, but it refers,\nloosely speaking, to a work’s subject matter, to what it addresses or\nto what issue has been placed in question. Philosophical usage of the\nword evokes phenomenological notions of intentionality: what a work is\ndirected at or points toward. The Sache is not a determinate\nconcept but an area of significant meaningfulness, a constellation of\nconcerns which orbit the affective, conative and cognitive\ncomplexities of subject matters such as grief or love. The\nSache underpins Gadamer’s claim that aesthetic experience has\na significant cognitive content. Subject matters may transcend an\nindividual work in that no one work can exhaust their significance,\nbut as ideas Sachen are not independent of the body of works\nthat exemplify them. If they were ontologically distinct, the idealism\nGadamer rejects would be forced on him and he would be compelled to\nargue that art is representational, refers to a concept beyond itself\nand, indeed, disappears into that concept once evoked. Art becomes\nphilosophy once more. If, however, art is presentation, as Gadamer\ninsists, a work’s meaning is not independent of it. Art does not\ntherefore copy and thereby represent a subject-matter, but configures\na visual or literary space in which a subject-matter can be\nsummoned. Gadamer counters an ancient line of argument that regards\nart as secondary to, inferior to, and a corrupter of, the real. Contrary\nto the Platonic tradition, his argument implies that art adds\nto the reality of its subject-matters. Gadamer’s evaluation of the\naesthetic contrasts vividly with Kant’s in this respect. Kant\nconsiders aesthetic experience to be indifferent to whether or not its\nobject is real (cf. TM 89). A work’s credibility does not depend on\nits relationship to an original object or co-relative. Whether what is\nrepresented exists or not is inconsequential. What matters is the\naesthetic merit of the work, not the strength of its likeness. Should\nthe artwork be harmed, the being of the correlative is\nunaffected. Gadamer’s presentational aesthetics is, by contrast,\nprofoundly anti-Platonic: a work’s disappearance diminishes the\nreality of that which presents itself through it. \n\nAlthough subject matters transcend the individual works which embody\nthem, they do not exist apart from their historical embodiments but,\nunlike Platonic forms, they do not transcend history but mutate and\ndevelop ever new permutations. Any diminishment of art diminishes the\nhistorical effectiveness of a given subject-matter. Were John Donne’s\nlove poems all lost, our understanding of the exquisite joys and pains\nof human love would be irreparably diminished. A semi-Platonic\nargument about mimesis reinforces a discernibly non-Platonic\nargument concerning the historically fluid character of subject\nmatters. The argument that artworks direct us to a subject matter\nirrespective of whether they be realist or abstract constructions,\nsuggests a moment of return and repetition. An issue, question or\nsubject-matter is recognised. \n\nThis passage strengthens the presentational approach to art but its\nreference to essences requires clarification. \n\nIt is not suggested that we see repeatedly the same essence in a work\nof art. Were this to be suggested, works would become dull and\nuninformative and make no new contribution to a genre. Gadamer’s\ninsistence is that works should speak directly to and, indeed,\ntransform our self-understanding. Such transformative power implies\nrecognising in a work what was previously understood of a\nsubject-matter, but transformed, as if seen for the first time.  The\nlife of a subject matter is one of change and\ndevelopment. Gadamer’s mimesis argument claims that through\nrepeated re-working and re-interpretation a subject matter not only\naccrues more aspects but also, in so doing, they allow that\nsubject-matter to become more fully what it is. “A work of art\nbelongs so closely to what it is related to that it enriches the being\nof that as if through a new event of being” (TM 147). The\n“joy of recognition is rather the joy of knowing more than is\nalready familiar”. Artworks allow subject-matters to become more\nwhat they are. In conclusion, Gadamer’s phenomenological aesthetics\neffectively destroys the Platonic separation of art and\nreality. Artworks are the sites in which trans-individual both present\nand transform themselves. Whereas, as we have seen, for Kant the\ndestruction of an artwork has absolutely no bearing upon the\nobjectivities it represents, we can now understand why Gadamer is\ncommitted to the opposing view that the destruction of an artwork\ndiminishes the reality of the subject-matters that come forth through\nit. \n\nThe strategic centrality of language in Gadamer’s aesthetics is beyond\ndoubt. The ability of artworks to bring things to mind and to hint at\nunseen meanings is reason to claim that in its speculative capacities,\nart functions essentially like a language. Yet he acknowledges that\nlinguistic means of expression are inadequate to the task of conveying\nwhat occurs within an experience of art. \n\nTwo claims underwrite this scepticism: words do not readily capture\nthe sheer complexity of aesthetic experience, and the finitude of\nlanguage itself prevents it from capturing the totality of such\nexperience. In other words, the experience of art always just eludes\ntheoretical containment. These are not difficulties with language\nper se, but rather reflect the limited capacity of the human\nmind to grasp the totality of its involvements. Yet in Gadamer’s\nthought these negative aspects incentivise further hermeneutic\ninvolvement in aesthetic experience. The incompleteness of any\ninterpretation of an artwork opens us to the possibility that there is\nalways something more or something else that can be said. The temporal\nnature of experience and its interpretation prevent closure or, in\nother words, both are by nature always open to further ways of\nthinking and speaking about art. The argument reinforces the claim\nthat art and its interpretation extend the being of the\nsubject-matters addressed and, furthermore, that aesthetic experience\nitself has a temporal continuity which is linked to its cumulative\ncharacter as a mode of Bildung.  The issue about the relationship between art and language is not\none of linguistic capture but of finding the appropriate words to open\nthe content of aesthetic experience. What is meant by the notion that\nan artwork addresses us with a meaning? Although an agent of the\nlinguistic turn of the twentieth century, Gadamer’s reflections on\nlanguage run counter to many semiotic theories. According to\nWeinsheimer, “the dualism of signifier and signified has no\nphenomenological basis” for Gadamer “since in speaking we\nhave no awareness of the world as being distinct from the word”\n(Weinsheimer 1993, 162). Gadamer speaks of the perfection of the word\nas being the disappearance of any gap between sense and\nutterance. Poetry would be the “paradigm case” of an\nartwork with a clear and immediate presentation of meaning. Yet this\nis seemingly inconsistent with the notion of a work that\n“stands-in-itself”. If aspects of its meaning are\nwithheld, sense and utterance are once again separated. The word, it\nwould appear, signifies something beyond itself after all. There is,\nin other words, a tension between Gadamer wanting to hold that the\nwork of art and the world that comes forth within it are indivisible\nand saying that the world which a work invokes is larger than the work\nitself. The poetic word, insofar as it is poetic, stands-in-itself;\nand yet as word it invokes something beyond itself. Gadamer’s\nspeculative account of meaning collapses, it would seem, into a\nreferential account of signs. Speculatively charged words refer to\nother signs or patterns of meaning beyond themselves. This suggests\nthat words are self-negating signs: when they function as they should,\nthey disappear into what it is referred to. To conclude that words\noperate as representational signs seems quite contrary to the account\nof art functioning in the manner of a symbol. Closer inspection\nsuggests that Gadamer’s account of the speculative account of meaning\nis presentational after all. Let us restate the question. \n\nIf the artwork is an autonomous entity that stands-in-itself and does\nnot refer to anything outside itself, what of art’s speculative\ncapacity to refer to other complexes beyond its immediate horizon? The\ntheological notion of a host can dissolve the inconsistency. On the\none hand, for an artwork to have a speculative capacity, it must\ninvoke perimeters of meaning which transcend its own immediate\ncircumstance. Without this, an artwork cannot connect us with\nframeworks of otherness. Yet this argument threatens to turn Gadamer’s\naesthetics into an idealism referring specifically to the\nidea which the artwork was invoking. Art would once again be\nsubordinated to a vehicle of philosophy. On the other hand, there is\nsomething within the constitution of an artwork that makes it resist\ntheoretical reduction. Its invocation of an excess of meaning resists\nconceptual capture. This brings us to the crux of the matter. Does\nthe excess of meaning which a work can speculatively invoke exist\napart from the work that summons them? The speculative dimensions of\nart suggest that an artwork is indeed a host for that which lies\nbeyond it and yet, at the same time, the transcendent dimensions of\nmeaning (its excess of meaning), remain immanent within the work that\ninvokes them. The presence of the transcendental only manifests itself\nthrough the work that hosts it. To put it another way, it is in the\nwork that the transcendental set of meanings achieves its\npresence. The full resonance of a subject-matter which of course\nextends well beyond any one work is nevertheless only discernible in\nthe works that host them. Indeed, subject-matters do not exist apart\nfrom the works that manifest their presence. Ontologically speaking\nthey inhere within the work. The work is the occasion in which these\ndimensions of meaning appear and they command the attention of the\nviewer so long as the work holds them in play. In other words, with\nregard to the tension between representation and presentation in\nGadamer’s position, the speculative charge of artworks does indeed\nsuggest that they function as representational signs always referring\nbeyond the given meaning. Yet this is another way of saying that,\nontologically speaking, artworks function as symbols. Considered as\na referential sign, what the artwork refers to is not a world\nindependent of the sign but another set of signs. However, such other\nconfigurations of meaning may mean more than the signs that invoke\nthem but they are inherent within those very signs. In other words,\nthe very signs which refer speculatively to other dimensions of\nmeaning also function symbolically in that the other horizons of\nmeaning invoked are immanent within the work’s autonomy. As a symbolic\nhost, the artwork holds that which refers beyond itself within\nitself. \n\nWhat binds us to a tradition, according to Gadamer, is not a misplaced\nconservatism but the questions a canon or body of work asks of\nus. However, the question of tradition is one of the most\ncontroversial within Gadamer’s philosophy. It arises because of the\nway Gadamer establishes individual and collective learning on the\nacquisition of accrued experiences (Bildung) and practices,\nrather than upon any methodological norm. His argument exposes the\nEnlightenment prejudice against prejudice. The liberating and\nuniversalising aspects of reason tend to marginalise and chastise both\nthe culturally different and the historically particular as divisive\nand irrational. Gadamer contends, however, that such an unqualified\nhypostasisation of reason and its methods has the unfortunate\nconsequence of condemning as methodologically groundless the very\nvaluations that ordinary linguistic and experiential practices are\nbased on. Gadamer is not unsympathetic to Nietzsche, who rejects the\nclaim that humanity is shaped by external necessity. Our existence\nwithin the world and our place within it is, metaphysically speaking,\nutterly contingent. If there is no metaphysical necessity that governs\nhuman practices, why should we even ask for a methodological\ngrounding, when language has neither required nor functioned with such\na license? Like Wilhelm Dilthey before him, Gadamer insists that\nnothing justifies and gives meaning to life other than life\nitself. This is not the invocation of nihilism, for life does not\noccur in a vacuum. Creatures such as humans, which have no\npre-determined essence, only survive by both remembering what has\nworked well within a practice and by constantly testing it against\ncontemporary needs and circumstances. There is a constant tension\nbetween acquired experience and the need to stabilise its lessons and\nthe need to question and thereby destabilise the tried and the\ntested. All expressive practices depend upon an inheritance of insight\nand valuation. They are dependent upon accrued learning and\nexperience. Such observations agitate Gadamer’s critics, who see in\nthe unreflective acceptance of the given an irresponsibly conservative\nprivileging of the received, and a wilful blindness to possible repressive\nor exclusionary practices within inherited modes of operation. In\nresponse to such scepticism, it must be acknowledged that inherited\npractices can, logically speaking, have negative entailments. However,\na commitment to tradition, is not a commitment to remaining the same,\nand nor is it indicative of a wilful refusal to confront the negative\nentailments within what is transmitted historically. Traditions which\nare incapable of changing risk becoming outmoded. Traditions are not\nfounded upon core and fixed identities. As vibrant religious and\nartistic traditions demonstrate, those which are in constant debate\nover aim and direction often prove engaging and\ninfluential. Traditions capable of subjecting their self-understanding\nto critique constitute continuities of conflict. The importance of\nreceived understanding for Gadamer is not its historical provenance\nbut how it opens us towards and engages us with issues in a community\nof debate. The Cartesian project of subjecting all beliefs to\nsceptical examination until they can be methodologically affirmed is,\nin Gadamer’s view, nihilistic. The project is implausible since the\nrange and depth of pre-understanding is so extensive as to be\nuntheorisable. To condemn pre-understanding as unjustifiable because\nit cannot be methodologically grounded is highly dangerous as it\ndevalues those very insights upon which our initial world-orientation\ndepends. It is not that these insights are instrinsically valuable but\nthat they are essential staging posts in the journeys of understanding\nthey enable. It is the continuous debate and dialogue over practice\nthat enables participants to move on, widen and transform acquired\nexperience. Movement and development is intrinsic to the German word\nfor tradition: Überlieferung has the active connotation\nof both transmitting and handing something on. What a tradition\ntransmits from age to age are questions, problems and issues. The\nimportance of canonic works is not that they are peerless exemplars of\nan idiom or style but rather that they raise issues and difficulties\nin an exemplary way. Traditions can check their self-understanding\nagainst their own historical projections. A commitment to tradition is\nnot a commitment to an academic antiquarianism. It is, essentially, a\ncommitment to a field of debate. Tradition is presented as a resource\nand a provocation for thinking and creativity: whereas sameness is the\ncurrency of a conservative conception of tradition, instability,\nquestions and the challenge of otherness are the drivers of Gadamer’s\nmore dialogical concept of tradition. \n\nIt has been argued against Gadamer that his revaluation of tradition\ndoes not really bring its content to a point of critical\nreflection. He acknowledges that like any other temporal phenomenon,\nnot all of its vistas can be adequately thematised or\narticulated. This does not mean, however, that tradition is beyond\ncritical appraisal. Traditions can, as Pannenberg argues, check their\nnormative assumptions against their self-projections. Other critics\nsuggest that Gadamer’s approach to tradition and aesthetics is overtly\nClassical in its preoccupation with forms that maintain a continuity\nthrough time rather than radically alter themselves. It does not allow\nfor those radical intrusions or revolutionary interjections which\nalter the perceptual paradigm of an age. The counter-objection is not\nonly that the charge overlooks Gadamer’s embrace of Heidegger’s quite\nradical phenomenological reworking of the Classical tradition, but\nalso the fact that for one paradigm to replace another, there must be\na certain relation between them. One must address an absence, fulfil an\nunseen possibility or a lack, within the other. Cubism, for example,\nimplies a visual orientation quite different from realism, but both\nidioms belong to a common tradition in that they strive to show us\nsomething of the real. Without a degree of continuity with tradition,\nany radical emergence would have no bearing upon the received and\nthereby lack the ability to call into question received notions and\nunderstanding. It is, however, precisely the challenge of the\ndifferent and the other which is the driver of Gadamer’s dialogical\nconception of tradition. It is a conception which is in part\nmodernistic: tradition is presented as being in constant debate with\nitself. Its renewal demands change and transformation. Furthermore, a\nvirtue of this dialogical conception of tradition is that it is not culturally\nspecific. Because its main focus is on the subject-matters which\ndifferent cultural practices address, it offers a model of cognitive\nengagement that can operate between distinct traditions rather than in\njust any one. \n\nThere is a creative tension at play within Gadamer’s aesthetic\nthinking. On the one hand, Gadamer stalwartly defends the autonomy of\nthe artwork and, on the other, despite his resistance to any\nsubsumption of art within philosophy, he insists  that\naesthetics should be absorbed within hermeneutics, which is for the\nmost part understood as a theoretical enterprise. This tension\nreplicates aspects of the so-called hermeneutic\ncircle. Schleiermacher, for example, argues that it is only possible\nto grasp an individual’s personal utterances if one can understand the\ngeneral structure of the language which that individual operates\nwithin. Conversely, general structures are only intelligible in terms\nof particular exemplifying utterances. Wilhelm Dilthey operates within\na similar part-whole structure, namely, an individual’s personal\nexperiences will mean little to the reader unless they can be\ncontextualised within a historical context. A movement between part\nand whole also takes place in Gadamer’s thinking. The artwork is\ninitially presented in its singularity. But then, the particular is\nilluminated by being brought under a subject-matter. To engage with\nartworks discursively is to bring generalisations about a work to\nbear, placing it in a wider context of associations. The movement to\nthe wider level of generalisation also returns the spectator to the\nparticular, since generalisation enables an understanding of what is\nsingular about a work by locating it within a broader background. This\ndouble hermeneutic movement is highly characteristic of Gadamer’s\naesthetic. It recognises that the cognitive dimension of  aesthetic\nexperience is like all linguistic experience both centrifugal and\ncentripetal in nature. When a work addresses us its impact is\ncentrifugal: it upsets and transforms what we customarily\nrecognise. It awakens us to the hermeneutical sublime, to what lies\nbeyond but nevertheless shapes our normal range of\nunderstanding. Thus, Gadamer can argue that, “something is a\npoetic structure when everything pre-structured is taken up into a\nnew, unique form … as if it were being said for the first time\nto us in particular” (GW 8, 62). Yet this estranging moment initiates a\ncentripetal return, a homecoming. “The poem and the art of\nlanguage generally as a heard or written text is always …\nsomething like a recognition in every single word” (GW 8,\n62). Yet the question remains: is the passage from the immediacy of\nthe given artwork to theoretical contemplations about its subject\nmatter not an instance of moving from the particular givenness of a\nwork to a more abstract level of reflection about its subject-matter?\nDoes not the contemplative movement away from the work betray its\nparticularity and suggest that the sense of a work lies beyond it, in\nits concept? Were Gadamer to have fallen into this impasse,\nan idealist and representationalist account of art would be forced\nupon him. The vehemence of his resistance to these stances suggests\nthat something other than a simple shift from the particular immediacy\nof a work to a theoretical contemplation of its content must be at\nplay. \n\nThe accusation of inconsistency requires the assumption that the\naesthetic experience of a work on the one hand and its contemplation\non the other, are separable. However, it is in Gadamer’s mind part of\nan intense experience that it impels us towards seeking to bring it\ninto words. Experience endeavours to bring itself into words. These words\nwill by virtue of their semantic associations place the experience in\na wider context (the centrifugal) and at the same time these words\nwill because of their poetic capacity for singularity make the\nexperience clearer and more distinct. \n\nThis suggests that Gadamer is not applying a hermeneutic method to\naesthetic experience but seeking to expose the hermeneutical movement\nfrom part to whole within aesthetic experience. In other\nwords, the claim that aesthetics should be taken up within\nhermeneutics is not an attempt to reduce aesthetics to another\nidiom. It announces an endeavour to articulate the hermeneutic dynamic\nof aesthetic experience itself. Let us briefly recapitulate the\nargument. \n\nThe tension in Gadamer’s position arises from (1) asserting art’s\nautonomy and (2) demanding that aesthetics be subsumed within\nhermeneutics. Undoubtedly, the weight of argument is on the latter. He\nsystematically criticises Kantian aesthetics for its narrow-minded\nconcentration on the subjectivity of momentary pleasures and offers in\nits place a substantial reconstruction of the cognitive content of\nart’s address. In other words, Gadamer switches the status of autonomy\nfrom the sensible irreducibility of a work to its hermeneutic\nautonomy. This entails the argument that a work which challenges our\noutlook does so because it is enigmatic by nature: it gives rise to\ndifficulties of meaning and interpretation which cannot be explained\naway by a more fundamental level of understanding. The autonomous work\nthat stands in itself is a work that both presents a meaning\nand at the same time holds something back. It is in other words always\npointing beyond itself but within itself. This substantiates\nGadamer’s claim that the hermeneutical constitution of an autonomous\nwork resists theoretical reduction. In the essay “Word and\nPicture”, he expresses sympathy with Schleiermacher’s remark,\n“I hate all theory that does not grow out of practice” (GW\n8, 374). However, as has been argued, the transcendent dimensions of\nmeaning which a work speculatively invokes are not outside the work\nbut immanent within it. In other words, we do not need a special\nhermeneutic method to access the withheld but just a deeper, more\nattentive contemplative acquaintance. When Gadamer speaks of being\nattentive to what an artwork says, of discerning its enigmatic quality\nand of becoming aware of its speculative resonances, he is indeed\nspeaking in a hermeneutical idiom, but this is most clearly not a case\nof Gadamer submitting aesthetic experience to an externally derived\ntheory. To the contrary, Gadamer is trying to draw out the\nhermeneutical dynamics of aesthetic experience itself. Thus the\ntension between the immediacy of experience and reflection upon the\ncontent of that experience is not a tension between experience on the\none hand and theory on the other. It is a tension within aesthetic\nexperience between what an artwork invokes of its subject-matter and\nhow what is invoked changes the character of that which invokes\nit. What hermeneutical reflection reveals of aesthetic experience is\nnothing extraneous to such experience but a further disclosure of what\nis held within it. To conclude, if aesthetic experience is\nhermeneutical in that artworks speculatively illuminate meanings\nbeyond what is immediately disclosed, hermeneutical experience should\nequally be taken up by aesthetics in that subject-matters only\nmanifest their presence in the singular and particular.","contact.mail":"j.r.n.davey@dundee.ac.uk","contact.domain":"dundee.ac.uk"}]
