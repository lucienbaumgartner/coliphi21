This entry begins by identifying features of criminal law\nthat make this so (§1). It then asks what functions that body of\nlaw fulfills (§2), and what justifies its creation and continued\nexistence (§3). If criminal law should be retained, we must\nconsider its proper limits (§4). We must consider the conditions\nunder which agents should be criminally responsible for whatever falls\nwithin those limits (§5). And we must ask which rules of\nprocedure and evidence should govern efforts to establish criminal\nresponsibility (§6). The focus of this entry is Anglo-American\ncriminal law and scholarship thereon. Many of the questions raised,\nand many of the answers considered, are nonetheless of general\napplication.\n\n\n\nThe life of the criminal law begins with criminalization. To\ncriminalize an act-type—call it \\(\\phi\\)ing—is to make it a\ncrime to commit tokens of that type. Many claim that if it is a crime\nto \\(\\phi\\) then \\(\\phi\\)ing is legally wrongful—it is something that,\nin the eyes of the law, ought not to be done (Hart 1994, 27; Gardner\n2007, 239; Tadros 2016, 91). On this view, we are not invited to\ncommit crimes—like murder, or driving uninsured—just as\nlong as we willingly take the prescribed legal consequences. As far as\nthe law is concerned, criminal conduct is to be avoided. This is so\nwhether or not we are willing to take the consequences. \n\nIt is possible to imagine a world in which the law gets its\nway—in which people uniformly refrain from criminal conduct.\nObviously enough this is not the world in which we live. Imagine \\(D\\) is\nabout to \\(\\phi\\). If \\(\\phi\\)ing is a crime, reasonable force may\npermissibly be used to prevent \\(D\\) \\(\\phi\\)ing. Police officers and private\npersons alike have powers to arrest \\(D\\), and reasonable force may\npermissibly be used to make arrests effective. \n\nThese powers and permissions exist ex ante—prior, that\nis, to the commission of crime. We can add those that exist ex\npost—once crime has been committed. Imagine now that \\(D\\)\nhas \\(\\phi\\)ed. As well as the power to arrest \\(D\\), the criminal law\nconfers a set of investigative powers designed to help generate\nevidence of \\(D\\)’s criminality: these include powers to stop\nand search, to carry out surveillance, and to detain suspects for\nquestioning. If sufficient evidence is produced, and it is in the\npublic interest to do so, \\(D\\) may be charged with a crime. To\nexercise these powers is to impose new duties on \\(D\\)—\\(D\\)\nmust submit to the search, remain in detention, and turn up in court\nwhen required. For \\(D\\) to do otherwise—absent justification or\nexcuse—is itself criminal. So reasonable force can permissibly\nbe used against \\(D\\) if she refuses to co-operate. \n\nThe powers and permissions mentioned so far help \\(D\\)’s accusers\nput together their case against \\(D\\). By the time cases reach the courts\nthose accusers are typically state officials (or those to whom the\nstate has delegated official power). Some legal systems do make space\nfor private prosecutions. But such prosecutions can be discontinued or\ntaken over by state officials (and their delegates). Those officials\n(and delegates) can also continue proceedings in the face of private\nopposition, even when the opposition comes from those wronged by \\(D\\). In\nthis way, the state exercises a form of control over criminal\nproceedings that is absent from legal proceedings of other kinds\n(Marshall and Duff 1998). \n\nIt may seem from the above that criminal proceedings are tilted\nheavily in favour of the accusing side. But the criminal law also\nconfers rights on the accused that help protect \\(D\\) against her\naccusers (Ashworth and Zedner 2010, 82). These typically include the\nright to be informed of the accusations in question, the right to\nconfidential access to a lawyer, and the privilege against\nself-incrimination. Most important of all, perhaps, is the right to be\ntried before an independent court that respects the presumption of\ninnocence—that requires the prosecution to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt that \\(D\\) committed the crime. \n\nAt least on paper, the procedural protections on offer in criminal\nproceedings are more robust than those available to the accused in\nlegal proceedings of other kinds. This is explained in large part by\nthe consequences of criminal conviction. If \\(D\\) is found guilty in a\ncriminal court, \\(D\\) gains a criminal record. Depending on the crime,\n\\(D\\) may be disenfranchised, banned from certain professions, refused\nentry to other countries, and declined access to insurance, housing,\nand education (Hoskins 2014; 2016). This is to say nothing of criminal\nsentences themselves. Those sentences are typically punishments: the\nobject of the exercise is that \\(D\\) suffer some harm or deprivation;\n\\(D\\) is to be made worse off than she otherwise would have been. This\nis not to say that suffering or deprivation must be the ultimate end\nof those who punish. That \\(D\\) suffer or lose out may be a means to\nany number of ultimate ends, including deterrence, restoration, or\nrehabilitation. What it cannot be is a mere side-effect. This is one\nthing that distinguishes criminal sentences—at least of the\npunitive kind—from the reparative remedies that are standard\nfare in civil law. Those remedies are designed to benefit\n\\(P\\)—to wipe out losses the plaintiff suffered in virtue of the\ndefendant’s wrong. True, \\(D\\) often loses in the process of\nensuring that \\(P\\) gains. But we can imagine cases in which this is\nnot so: in which an award of damages leaves \\(D\\) no worse off than\n\\(D\\) was before. The award may remain a reparative success. It cannot\nbe anything other than a punitive failure (Boonin 2008, 12–17;\nGardner 2013). \n\nWe can now see that criminalizing \\(\\phi\\)ing does much more than make\n\\(\\phi\\)ing a legal wrong. It also makes it the case that \\(\\phi\\)ing\ntriggers a set of legal rights, duties, powers, and permissions, the\nexistence of which distinguishes criminal law from the rest of the\nlegal system. Those rights, duties, powers, and permissions are\nconstitutive of a criminal process via which suspected \\(\\phi\\)ing\nturns into arrest, charge, trial, conviction, and\npunishment. Obviously suspicions are sometimes misplaced. Innocent\npeople’s lives are sometimes ruined in consequence. So it is no\nsurprise that the most destructive powers and permissions are\njealously guarded by the criminal law. Trials held in a\nuniversity’s moot court might be meticulously fair to\ndefendants. But a moot court has no power to detain us in advance, to\nrequire us to appear before it, or to sentence us to\nimprisonment. Force used to achieve any of these things would itself\nbe criminal, however proportionate the resulting punishment might\nbe. As this example shows, criminal law is characterised by an\nasymmetry—it bestows powers and permissions on state officials\n(and delegates) which are withheld from private persons, such that the\nlatter are condemned as vigilantes for doing what the former lawfully\ndo (Thorburn 2011a, 92–93; Edwards forthcoming). This remains the\ncase—often to the great frustration of victims and their\nsupporters—even if the official response, assuming it comes at\nall, will be woefully inadequate. \n\nFew deny that one function of criminal law is to deliver justified\npunishment. Some go further and claim that this is the sole function\nof criminal law (Moore 1997, 28–29). Call this the punitive\nview. Rules of criminal procedure and evidence, on this view,\nhelp facilitate the imposition of justified punishment, while keeping\nthe risk of unjustified punishment within acceptable bounds. Rules of\nsubstantive criminal law help give potential offenders fair warning\nthat they may be punished. Both sets of rules combat objections we\nmight otherwise make to laws that authorize the intentional imposition\nof harm. To combat objections, of course, is not itself to make a\npositive case for such laws. That case, on the punitive view, is made\nby the justified punishments that criminal courts impose. This is not\nto say anything about what the justification of\npunishment is. It is merely to say that criminal law is to be\njustified in punitive terms. \n\nSome object that this focus on punishment is misplaced. The central\nfunction criminal law fulfills in responding to crime, some say, is\nthat of calling suspected offenders to account in criminal courts\n(Gardner 2007, 80; Duff 2010c, 16). This view puts the criminal trial\nat the centre, not just of criminal proceedings, but of criminal law\nas a whole (Duff 2013a, 196). Trials invite defendants to account for\nthemselves either by denying the accusation that they offended, or by\npleading a defence. The prospect of conviction and punishment puts\ndefendants under pressure to offer an adequate account. Call this\nthe curial view. It differs from the punitive view in two\nways. First, part of the positive case for criminal law is\nindependent of the imposition of punishment. Second, part of\nthe positive case for imposing criminal punishment is\ndependent on the punishment being part of a process of calling\nto account. The following two paragraphs expand on both these\nclaims. \n\nAs to the first, we often have reason to account for our actions to\nothers. We can leave open for now the precise conditions under which\nthis is so. But it is plausible to think that if Alisha steals from\nBintu she has reason for account for the theft, and that if Chika\nintentionally kills Dawn she has reason to account for the killing.\nDefenders of the curial view argue that criminal proceedings are of\nintrinsic value when defendants (are called to) offer accounts of\nthemselves that they have reason to offer in criminal courts (Gardner\n2007, 190–191; Duff 2010c, 15–17). Imagine Alisha stole\nfrom Bintu because she was under duress. Imagine Chika intentionally\nkilled Dawn to defend herself or others. Neither of these defendants,\nwe can assume, is justifiably punished. On the punitive view, criminal\nlaw’s function does not stand to be fulfilled. On the curial\nview, things are different. Alisha and Chika both have reason to\naccount for their behaviour—to explain what they did and why\nthey did it. Criminal proceedings invite each to provide that account\nand put each under pressure to do so. Assuming Alisha and Chika have\nreason to account in a criminal court, proceedings in which they (are\ncalled to) do so are of intrinsic value. One of criminal law’s\nfunctions is fulfilled even if no-one is, or should be, punished. \n\nTo endorse the curial view is not, of course, to say that we should do\naway with criminal punishment. But it is to say that the\nconnection between trial and punishment is not merely instrumental.\nSome think that the facts that make punishment fitting—say,\nculpable wrongdoing—obtain independently of criminal proceedings\nthemselves (Moore 1997, 33). We use those proceedings to ensure that\nsaid facts are highly likely to have obtained—that \\(D\\) is\nhighly likely to have culpably committed a wrong. On the curial view,\nthe fact that \\(D\\) has been tried and found guilty (or has entered a\nguilty plea) is itself part of what makes it fitting that\n\\(D\\) is punished. The fitting way to respond to criminal wrongdoing,\non this view, is to call the wrongdoer to account for her wrong. To\ncall \\(D\\) to account is to attempt to both (a) get \\(D\\) to answer\nfor wrongdoing (as occurs in court), and (b) get \\(D\\) to confront\nwrongdoing for which she has no satisfactory answer (as occurs when\n\\(D\\) is punished). So it is only\nbecause \\(D\\) has first been tried and found guilty (or has\nentered a guilty plea) that punishment counts as a fitting response to\n\\(D\\)’s wrong (Gardner 2007, 80; Duff 2013a, 205). We can see\nthe implications of this view by imagining a world in which trials are\nabolished, because some new-fangled machine allows us to identify\nculpable wrongdoers with perfect accuracy. Having no doubt that \\(D\\)\nis guilty, we simply impose punishment on \\(D\\). On the curial view,\nthe punishments we impose are inherently defective: they are not\nimposed as part of a process of calling to account. Though our\nnew-fangled machine might justify doing away with trials—once we\nfactor in how expensive they can be—we would lose something of\nvalue in doing away with them. \n\nIf criminal law does have a particular function, we can ask whether\nthat function is distinctive of criminal law. We can ask, in\nother words, whether it helps distinguish criminal law from the rest\nof the legal system. It has been claimed that criminal law is\ndistinctive in imposing punishment (Moore 1997, 18–30; Husak\n2008, 72). One might also claim that criminal law alone calls\ndefendants to account. But punishments are imposed in civil\nproceedings—exemplary damages are the obvious case. And it is\narguable that civil proceedings also call defendants to\naccount—that they too invite defendants to offer a denial or\nplead a defence; that they too use the prospect of legal liability to\nput defendants under pressure to account adequately (Duff 2014a). \n\nIn response, one might try to refine the function that is distinctive\nof criminal law. Perhaps criminal law’s function is to respond\nto public wrongs (whether by calling to account or punishing such\nwrongdoers), whereas the function of civil law is to respond to\nprivate wrongs. What we should make of this proposal depends on what a\npublic wrong is (Lamond 2007; Lee 2015; Edwards and Simester\n2017). To make progress, we can distinguish between primary\nduties—like duties not to rape or rob—and secondary\nduties—like duties to answer, or suffer punishment, for rape or\nrobbery. We incur duties of the latter kind by breaching duties of the\nformer. \n\nIf the public/private distinction is cashed out in terms of primary\nduties, then responding to public wrongs cannot be distinctive of\ncriminal law. Many wrongs are both crimes and torts. So the two bodies\nof law often respond to breaches of the same primary duty. A more\npromising proposal looks to secondary duties. Perhaps criminal\nlaw’s distinctive function is to respond to wrongs on behalf\nof us all—to discharge secondary duties owed to the\ncommunity as a whole (Duff 2011, 140). Perhaps the function of civil\nlaw is to respond to wrongs on behalf of some of us—to\ndischarge secondary duties owed to particular individuals. This might\nbe thought to explain why criminal proceedings, unlike civil\nproceedings, are controlled by state officials: why officials can\ninitiate proceedings that individual victims oppose, and discontinue\nproceedings that victims initiate. \n\nThe view described in the previous paragraph conceives of criminal law\nas an instrument of the community—a way of ensuring that the\ncommunity gets what it is owed from wrongdoers. Call it the\ncommunitarian view. If we combine this with the curial view, the\ndistinctive function of criminal law is to seek answers owed to the\ncommunity as a whole. One might doubt that the functions of criminal\nand civil law can be so neatly distinguished. It is arguable that\ncivil law sometimes responds to wrongs on behalf of all of\nus—civil proceedings can be brought against \\(D\\) on the\nbasis that her conduct is a nuisance to the public at large, or on the\nbasis that \\(D\\) is a public official whose conduct is an abuse of\npower. More importantly, one might claim that in the case of\nparadigmatic crimes—like robbery, rape, or\nbattery—criminal law responds to wrongs on behalf of particular\nindividuals—on behalf of those who have been robbed, raped, or\nbattered. On this view, a positive case for criminalization need not\nawait the finding that \\(D\\) owes something to the whole community. It\nis at least sometimes enough that \\(D\\) owes something to those \\(D\\)\nhas wronged, which \\(D\\) would fail to provide in the absence of\ncriminal proceedings. \n\nThose who reject the communitarian view might be thought to face the\nfollowing difficulty: they might be thought to lack an explanation of\nofficial control over how far criminal proceedings go. If criminal law\nseeks what is owed by wrongdoers to the wronged, doesn’t\nofficial control amount to theft of a conflict properly controlled by\nthe two parties (Christie 1977)? Not necessarily. First, we should not\nalways require the wronged to have to pursue those who have wronged\nthem. Second, we should not always support those who think themselves\nwronged in pursuing alleged wrongdoers. As to the first point, some\nare trapped in abusive relationships with those who wrong them. Others\nare susceptible to manipulation that serves to silence their\ncomplaints. Some wrongdoers can use wealth and social status to stop\naccusers in their tracks. As to the second point, the temptation to\nretaliate in the face of wrongdoing is often great. It is all too easy\nfor the pursuit of justice to become the pursuit of revenge, and for\nthe perceived urgency of the pursuit to generate false accusations.\nOfficial control can help vulnerable individuals—like those\ndescribed above—to get what they are owed. And it can mitigate\nthe damage done by those trying to exact vengeance and settle scores\n(Gardner 2007, 214–216). It can ensure that those in positions\nof power cannot wrong others with impunity, and reduce the likelihood\nthat vindictiveness begets retaliation, which begets violent conflict\nfrom which all lose out (Wellman 2005, 8–10). We can add that\ncriminal proceedings may help protect others against being wronged in\nfuture. Those wronged may have a duty to give up control of\nproceedings in order to provide this protection (Tadros 2011c,\n297–299). \n\nThese remarks suggest an alternative to the communitarian view.\nAccording to the alternative, the secondary duties of concern in civil\nand criminal proceedings are typically one and the same. The positive\ncase for criminal law’s involvement is not that it discharges\nduties of interest to the criminal law alone, but that it enables\nduties of general interest to be discharged less imperfectly than they\notherwise would be—than they would be if the criminal law took\nno interest in them. Call this the imperfectionist view. What\nis distinctive of criminal law, on this view, is not its function but\nits mode of functioning: the manner in which it fulfills functions\nshared with other bodies of law. \n\nSome writers seek criminal law’s distinctiveness in a different\nplace. What is distinctive about criminal law, they claim, is that it\npublicly censures or condemns. This expressive function is sometimes\nassociated with criminal punishment (Husak 2008, 92–95).\nBecause other bodies of law sometimes punish, and because punishment\ntypically—perhaps necessarily—expresses censure (Feinberg\n1970), the expressive function is at least partly shared. But the\nmessage sent by criminal law is not sent only at the sentencing stage.\nIt is sent the moment a guilty verdict is reached by a criminal\ncourt—by the declaration that \\(D\\) has been criminally\nconvicted (Simester 2005, 33–36). The social significance of\nconviction is very different to that of (say) the verdict that \\(D\\)\nis a tortfeasor: the former verdict conveys, in and of itself, that\n\\(D\\)’s conduct reflects badly on \\(D\\). Though additional\ndetail may generate the same conclusion in the case of a civil\nverdict, such detail is not required in the case of criminal\nconviction. If this is right, the distinctiveness of criminal law\nturns out not to consist in the fact that it provides for\npunishment. It turns out to consist (at least in part) in the\nprovision of a technique for condemning wrongdoers which does not\nrequire that we punish in order to condemn. \n\nSo far, we have focused on the functions criminal law fulfills in\nresponse to the commission of crime. It is plausible to think,\nhowever, that criminal law’s functions include preventing crime\nfrom occurring. We can see this by asking what success would look like\nfor the criminal law. Would criminal law have succeeded if all thieves\nand murderers were tried and punished? Or would it have succeeded if\nthere\nwas no theft or murder, because criminalization resulted in\nwould-be thieves and murderers refraining from such wrongs? Notice that\nto pose these two questions as alternatives is not to deny that\npunishment might be justified in preventive terms. It is\nrather to suggest that resorting to punishment to achieve prevention\nis already a partial failure for the criminal law. It is a failure to\ndeter those who, ex hypothesi, have already committed\ncriminal offences. Had the creation of those offences been an\nunqualified success, there would have been nothing for which to punish\nanyone. \n\nOne might hold that criminal law’s sole function is to\nprevent criminal wrongdoing. Call this the preventive view.\nDefenders of this view need not say that we should enact whatever laws\nwill achieve the most prevention. That \\(X\\) is the function of \\(Y\\)\ndoes not entail that we are justified in doing whatever will achieve\nmost of \\(X\\) with \\(Y\\). That cutting is the function of knives does\nnot entail that knife-holders are justified in cutting whatever they\nsee. Holders of the preventive view can, in other words, accept the\nexistence of constraints on prevention, that are not themselves\njustified in preventive terms (Hart 1968, 35–50). What they\ncannot accept is a positive case for criminal law that is not\npreventive. \n\nSome hold a mixed view that combines elements of those\nconsidered above (Alexander and Ferzan 2009, 3–19; Simester and\nvon Hirsch 2011, 3–18; Tadros 2016, 159–172). One way to\nconstruct such a view is by distinguishing between primary and\nsecondary functions. Primary functions are those that, when all else\nis equal, we have most reason to want the law to fulfil. Secondary\nfunctions are those we have reason to want the law to fulfil if it\nfails to fulfil its primary functions. Criminal law’s primary\nfunctions, it is plausible to think, are preventive. Ceteris\nparibus, we have most reason to want criminal law to bring about\na world in which wrongs like theft or murder do not occur. Failing\nthat, we have reason to want criminal law to call thieves and\nmurderers to account, and to punish those who have no adequate account\nto offer. \n\nThere is some scepticism about mixed views. For some, the worries are\nconceptual. Moore claims that justified punishment must be imposed for\nreasons of desert, and that for this reason the punitive and\npreventive functions cannot be combined. We are unable to ‘kill two\nbirds with the proverbial one stone, for by aiming at one of the birds\nwe will necessarily miss the other’ (Moore 1997, 28). Several\nreplies are available. First, even if this is a problem for a mixed\nview of punishment, it need not be for a mixed view of\ncriminal law. Grant that punishment must be imposed for\nreasons of desert. It does not follow that criminal offences cannot be\ncreated for reasons of prevention. Criminalization and punishment are\ndifferent acts, and can be performed for different reasons (Edwards\nand Simester 2014). Second, to claim that \\(X\\) is part of the\npositive case for criminal law—that it is one of criminal\nlaw’s\nfunctions—is not to claim that \\(X\\) should be part of the\nmission of every criminal justice official (Gardner 2007,\n202). Reasons that help make a positive case for our actions are often\nreasons for which we should not act. That one will be financially\nsecure is a reason to get married, but one should not get married in\norder to be financially secure. Similarly, to say that prevention\nhelps make a positive case for criminal law—and for\npunishment—is not to say that judges should punish for that\nreason. \n\nOther worries about mixed views are pragmatic (Duff 2010a). As\ncriminal wrongdoing will persist whatever we do, the preventive\nfunction sets criminal law an insatiable goal. There is a standing\nrisk that law-makers who pursue that goal will deprive us of a criminal law\nthat fulfills its other functions. Consider again the curial\nview. Plausibly, we have reason to account for wrongs like theft and\nfraud in criminal court, but no reason to account for every\ninteraction with property or all misleading statements from which we\nstand to gain. If defendants are to be called to account for the\nwrongs, it is these that must be criminalized. To criminalize\ntrivialities—in pursuit of preventive ends—is to drain\ncriminal proceedings of their intrinsic value (Duff 2010b). No doubt\nthese are important worries. But they do nothing to suggest that we\nshould reject a mixed view. At most, they show that\nlaw-makers also should not take prevention to be part of\ntheir mission. As we already saw, this conclusion does not show that\nprevention is not part of the positive case for criminal law.  And it\nmay anyway be too strong. Law-makers who exclude prevention from their\nmission may refuse to create crimes that would prevent a great deal of\nharm. The cost of refusing to create these crimes might be greater\nthan the cost of calling people to account for trivialities, and this\nmight be so even when alternative means of prevention are factored\nin. If it would, criminal law’s preventive function should be\npart of the law-making mission: it is a function law-makers should\nindeed aim to fulfil. \n\nIn light of the resources it consumes, and the damage it does to\npeople’s lives, it is far from clear that we are justified in\nhaving criminal law. If we should not be abolitionists, criminal law\nmust be capable of realizing some value that gives us sufficient\nreason to retain it. To offer an account of this value is to offer a\ngeneral justification of criminal law. Obviously enough, the\nfunctions of criminal law tell us something about what this might be.\nIf the punitive view is correct, criminal law’s value consists in\ndelivering justified punishment. If the curial view is correct, that\nvalue consists (in part) in people offering answers that they have\nreason to offer. If the preventive view is correct, it consists in\npreventing criminal wrongs. So stated, however, these views do not tell\nus what the value of fulfilling each function actually is. The punitive\nview tells us nothing about what justifies criminal punishment. The\ncurial view tells us nothing about the value of calling people to\naccount in criminal courts. The preventive view tells us nothing about\nthe value of preventing crime. A general justification of criminal law\nfills this explanatory gap. \n\nWe can make progress by distinguishing between value of different\nkinds. Some value is relational—it exists in virtue of\nrelationships in which people stand. That a relationship has such\nvalue is a reason to do what will bring it into existence. The value\nof friendship is a reason to make friends. The value of egalitarian\nsocial relations is a reason to break down barriers of status and\nrank. Some argue that we have sufficient reason to have criminal law\nbecause it helps us enter a valuable relationship: it helps transform\nour relations with one another from relations of mutual dependence, to\nrelations of independence from the power of others (Ripstein 2009,\n300–324; Thorburn 2011a, 2011b). \n\nThis argument can be developed as follows. Just as slaves are\ndependent on their masters, so we are dependent on one another in the\nabsence of a framework of legal rights: just as masters wrong their\nslaves, however well they treat them, so we are doomed to wrong one\nanother if no such framework exists. To avoid this, we need more than\njust rights that exist on paper. We need sufficient assurance that our\nrights will be respected, and we need a mechanism by which their\nsupremacy can be reasserted in the face of wilful violation. Criminal\nlaw’s value lies in giving us what we need. Criminal punishment\namounts to reassertion. Crime prevention provides reassurance. At the\nlevel of function, this is what the last section called a mixed view.\nBut the value of fulfilling both functions is one and the same: it is\nthe value of securing our independence from one another, so we cease\nto relate to one another as master and slave, and begin to do so as\nindependent beings. As it is often associated (rightly or wrongly)\nwith Kant’s political philosophy, we can call this the\nKantian view. \n\nIt is sometimes suggested that criminal law’s general\njustification is exhausted by its contribution to our independence. It\nis not clear why we should accept this claim. One source of doubt is\nthe fact that some agents are unavoidably\ndependent—they lack the capacities required to live as\nindependent beings. This is true of some non-human animals, and some\nof those with serious disabilities. Precisely because of the\ncapacities they lack, these agents are especially vulnerable to being\nabused or exploited. Part of criminal law’s general\njustification is that it protects the vulnerable against such\nwrongs. Ex hypothesi, this does nothing to secure\nindependence. So it is not something that can be accommodated by (the\nexhaustive form of) the Kantian view (Tadros 2011b). \n\nFor defenders of the Kantian view, criminal law’s value derives\nfrom a relationship it helps create. On another view, the value of\ncriminal law derives from a relationship that pre-exists it: the\nrelationship in which we stand as members of a political community\n(Duff 2011). Any such community has values in terms of which it is\nunderstood by its members. If this self-understanding is to be more\nthan a charade, the community must actually value its defining\nvalues—it must do what those values are reasons to do. Imagine\nthat life is one such value, and a member takes another’s life.\nPart of what it is for a community to value life is for it to respond\nto the taking: for the killer to be required to account to fellow\nmembers, thereby communicating the community’s judgment that the\nkilling was wrong. Criminal law is a body of law that requires the\naccounting. Functionally, this is a version of the curial view. But\nthe value of fulfilling that function is relational: it is the value\nof making the community one that is true to itself—one that does\nnot betray the values in terms of which members understand what it is\nand who they are (Duff and Marshall 2010, 83–84). This line of\nthought lends support to what I earlier called the communitarian\nview. On that view, criminal proceedings discharge secondary duties\nowed to the community as a whole. That such duties are part and parcel\nof a valuable form of relationship helps explains why we should think\nthat they exist. \n\nOne objection to the view described in the previous paragraph is that\nit is unduly conservative. What justifies criminalizing a\nwrong—on that view—is that the wrong has a pre-existing\nfoothold in the defining values of the community: it is because of\nthat foothold that failing to criminalize would be a form of\nself-betrayal.  Some communities, however, are characterised by\nsystematic\nneglect of important values—by patriarchy, or racism, or\ndistributive inequality. When this is so, part of the justification for\ncriminalization is not that it helps the community remain true to\nitself, but that it helps transform the community by\nreconstituting it in valuable ways (Dempsey 2009; 2011). One source of\ncriminal law’s value, on this alternative view, is its ability to help alter\nsocial morality, such that neglected values come to be taken seriously\nby community members (Green 2013a). Where this is successful, criminal\nlaw can largely disappear from members’ motivational horizons: we\ncome to refrain from conduct for the moral reasons that make it wrong,\nwithout reference to the fact that the conduct is criminal. \n\nBoth versions of the relational view—Kantian and\ncommunitarian—face another doubt. Imagine \\(D\\) robs \\(V\\). It\nis plausible to think that this wrong is of concern to the criminal\nlaw\nin its own right. It is plausible to think that whatever\nfurther effects it might have, preventing the wrong of murder\nitself helps justify criminalizing murder, and bringing\ncriminal proceedings against murderers. On both the Kantian and\ncommunitarian views this is not the case. What justifies criminalizing\nwrongs, and bringing criminal proceedings against wrongdoers, is that\nthis contributes to some larger social good—to the framework of\nlegal rules we need for independence, or to the community remaining\ntrue to itself. We may reasonably doubt that wrongs like murder matter\nto the criminal law only for these further reasons. In claiming that\nthis is why they matter, both versions of the relational view\ninstrumentalize criminal law’s concern with wrongdoing:\nboth hold that we have reason to prevent wrongs via the criminal law\nonly because this is a means of establishing healthy relations in which\nall share. \n\nThe above remarks concern the kind of value that justifies having\ncriminal law. We can also ask who is capable of realizing that value.\nOn both the views sketched above, criminal law’s value is\ngrounded in a relationship in which all stand. If that value is to be\nrealised, someone must act on behalf of those who stand in the\nrelationship. In most systems of criminal law, the job is done by the\nstate—agents of the state create, apply, and enforce criminal\nlaws. Some argue that in a legitimate system of criminal law this is\nthe only possibility. Criminal law’s value, it is claimed, is\nessentially public—it is value that can only be\nrealised, even in principle, by agents of the state. This view can be\ndeveloped in a number of ways. Consider again the Kantian view. Some\nclaim that coercion secures independence only if the coercer speaks for\nall those coerced. Otherwise it is just another independence violation.\nOnly state agents can speak for all of us. So the enforcement of the\ncriminal law must remain in their hands (Thorburn 2011a, 98–99).\nDefenders of the communitarian view tell a similar story. If the value\nof criminal proceedings is that they express the community’s\njudgment about wrongdoing, and if only state agents can convey our\ncollective judgment, trials must be carried out, and punishments\nimposed, by those agents (Duff 2013a, 206). On both views, it is\nimpossible for private persons to realise the values that justify\ncriminal law. If these arguments go through, they have obvious\nimplications for debates about the privatization of prison and police\nservices (Dorfman and Harel 2016). They also offer us a sense in which\ncriminal law theory must be political. It must face up to the question\nof whether there are essentially public goods, and ask what role they\nplay in justifying the existence of criminal law (Harel 2014,\n96–99). \n\nSome find criminal law’s general justification in value that is\nneither relational nor essentially public. Consider the prevention of\nharm, or the prevention of moral wrongdoing. A number of writers\nappeal to one or both values to justify the existence of criminal law\n(Feinberg 1987, 146–155; Alexander and Ferzan 2009, 17; Simester\nand von Hirsch 2011, 29–30). Because there are wrongless harms\n(think of sporting injures caused without foul play) and harmless\nwrongs (think of botched conspiracies or undiscovered attempts) the\naforementioned values do not always wax and wane together. One\npossibility is that criminal law’s concern with wrongs is\nderivative of its concern with harms: criminal law should prevent\nwrongs (e.g., conspiracy to injure) when and because harm is thereby\nprevented (e.g., injury itself). Another possibility is that criminal\nlaw’s concern with harms is derivative of its concern with\nwrongs: criminal law should prevent harms (e.g., physical injury) when\nand because those harms are wrongfully caused (e.g., by assault)\n(Feinberg 1987, 151–155; Moore 1997, 647–649). A third\npossibility is that harms and wrongs provide two independent sources\nof general justification (compare Tadros 2016,\n162–166). Whatever the answer, this preventive value is\nimpersonal in two ways: it is not grounded in any special\nrelationship; and it is value that might in principle be realised by\nany of us. \n\nAnyone who seeks criminal law’s justification in the coin of\nimpersonal value must also account for what the criminal law does when\nprevention fails. Imagine \\(D\\) assaults \\(V\\), thereby causing \\(V\\)\nphysical injury. Some claim that \\(D\\) thereby incurs secondary moral\nduties, not in virtue of any relationship in which \\(D\\) stands, but\nsimply in virtue of facts about the wrong \\(D\\) committed (Moore 1997,\n170–172; Tadros 2011c, 275–283). Criminal law’s\nresponses to crime discharge these duties, it is claimed, and this is\nwhat justifies those responses. \n\nIt is worth distinguishing between two versions of this view.\nAccording to Moore, all culpable wrongdoers incur a duty to allow\nthemselves to suffer. \n  Retributive justice\n is done when punishment\nimposes that suffering, and this is what justifies the imposition of\ncriminal punishment (Moore 1997, 70–71). Moore argues that the\nsuffering of culpable wrongdoers is intrinsically good. On a rival\nview, suffering is always intrinsically bad. We must accept, however,\nthat in some cases not all suffering can be avoided. Sometimes we must\nchoose between wrongdoers suffering now and others suffering at the\nhands of wrongdoers later. Only by imposing the former can we protect\nagainst the latter. It might look as though punishing wrongdoers for\nthese protective reasons amounts to treating them as mere means. But\nthis is not necessarily so. Tadros argues that some wrongdoers incur\nduties to protect others at the cost of some harm to themselves. We\ncan justify imposing punishments that come at this cost to these\nwrongdoers, when the punishments protect others by preventing future\nwrongs. As those punished are only doing their duty, we can reasonably\nclaim that they are not treated as mere means (Tadros 2011c; 2016).\nThough Moore and Tadros disagree on many things, their views also have\nsomething in common. Both claim that, as a matter of principle, anyone\nmight impose punishment that discharges wrongdoers’ secondary\nduties. The value to which both appeal to justify punishment is\nimpersonal: it is neither relational nor essentially public (Moore\n2009a, 42; Tadros 2011c, 293). \n\nGeneral justifications of criminal law like those sketched in the last\nfew paragraphs face a number of criticisms. One objection has it they\nare unduly expansive: much moral wrongdoing—even much\nthat generates secondary duties to suffer or protect—is no\nbusiness of the criminal law. Failing to help one’s friend move\nhouse because one is lazy is a culpable wrong. But as the failure is a\nprivate matter—to be resolved by the friends\nthemselves—there is no reason for law-makers to criminalize the\nwrong (Duff 2014b; Husak 2014, 215–216). There is certainly no\nreason for them to criminalize it when the friends are both citizens\nof another state, and the failure occurs in the other jurisdiction\n(Duff 2016). Reasons to criminalize exist, as it is often put, only\nwhere law-makers have standing. And the mere fact that a\nwrong generates the aforementioned secondary duties does not itself\ngive law-makers standing to criminalize it. \n\nAccording to a second objection, the focus on moral wrongdoing is\nunduly restrictive: much that is not morally wrong—and\nwhich generates no secondary duties—is the business of the\ncriminal law. According to one argument for this conclusion, the\nstable existence of (almost) any valuable social institution—be\nit financial, educational, familial, military, or\npolitical—depends on widespread compliance with its rules. Under\nrealistic conditions, criminal liability for violation is necessary\nfor stability. It is the value of stable institutions, not the moral\nwrongfulness of violating their rules, that justifies bringing\ncriminal law into existence (Chiao 2016). \n\nA third objection returns us to the asymmetry discussed at\nthe end of section 1. Many of the powers and permissions by means of\nwhich criminal justice is done are withheld from private persons. Most\nobviously, private persons are not typically permitted to use force to\npunish others for crime. Few think that this should be changed.\nVigilantism should remain criminal. If the values that justify having\ncriminal law are essentially public, we appear to have an easy\nexplanation of this fact: private persons cannot, even in principle,\nrealise the values that justify criminal punishment; so they should\nnot be permitted to punish. If those values are not essentially\npublic, things are more difficult. There will surely be cases in which\nprivate persons are best placed to discharge \\(D\\)’s secondary\nduties—in which the state will not punish \\(D\\), but our\nimagined moot court would fine \\(D\\) a proportionate amount. It is not\nimmediately clear that those who find criminal law’s general\njustification in impersonal values can explain why the moot court may\nnot extract the money (Thorburn 2011a, 92–93). \n\nLet us take the third objection first. If impersonal values justify\nhaving criminal law, we have reason to opt for whichever set of legal\nrules will realise those values most efficiently. If one set of powers\nand permissions will achieve more of the value in question at a lower\ncost, we should—all else being equal—opt for that set. Now\ncompare two sets of rules. One permits state officials and private\npersons alike to use force to punish criminals. Another withholds the\npermissions granted to the former from the latter. We have good reason\nto think that the first set of rules would bring with it significant\ncosts. Private persons are likely to make more mistakes about who\ncommitted crimes, and about how much punishment is appropriate for\ncriminality. Different private punishers are unlikely to punish\nsimilarly placed offenders in similar amounts. And as their actions\nare less easily subjected to public scrutiny, private persons are less\neasily compelled to punish for the right reasons—in order to do\njustice rather than settle scores, get revenge, or maximise their\nprofit margins (Moore 2009a, 42; Edwards forthcoming). Avoiding these costs\nis a strong reason to opt for the second set of rules. True, that set\nprevents proportionate punishment being imposed by our imagined moot\ncourt. But it is plausible to think that this benefit is outweighed by\nthe aforementioned costs. If it is, those who appeal to impersonal\nvalues to justify criminal law can explain why the moot court is not\npermitted to force us to give up our money. \n\nAccording to the second objection, what justifies having criminal law\nis its role in stabilizing valuable institutions. Notice, however,\nthat if violating the rules of a valuable institution contributes to\nits destabilization, we will often have a moral duty to conform to the\ninstitution’s rules. By preventing these wrongs, and holding\nwrongdoers responsible, we stabilize the institutions. The contrast\nbetween a general justification focused on moral wrongdoing, and one\nfocused on institutional stability, therefore turns out to be a false\ncontrast (Tadros 2016, 135). These observations help make a more\ngeneral point. We can accept that criminal law is a tool properly used\nto support financial, educational, familial, military, and political\ninstitutions. We can also accept that it is not any old\ntool—that criminal law is ‘a great moral machine, stamping\nstigmata on its products, painfully “rubbing in” moral\njudgments on the people who entered at one end as\n“suspects” and emerged from the other end as condemned\nprisoners’ (Feinberg 1987, 155).  It is precisely because\ncriminal law is a tool of this special kind—a ‘morally\nloaded sledgehammer’ (Simester and von Hirsch 2011,\n10)—that its general justification is plausibly found in\npreventing and responding to moral wrongs (cf. Tadros 2016,\n68–70). \n\nIf this kind of general justification is not too restrictive, is it\nnonetheless too expansive? This was the first of the three objections\nraised above. Let us grant that some moral wrongs are not the criminal\nlaw’s business. We need not infer that criminal law is\nunconcerned with moral wrongness. We need only accept that there are\nfacts about criminalization which give law-makers a duty not to\ncriminalize some moral wrongs. There are many such facts, and their\nforce varies depending on the wrong (Simester and von Hirsch 2011,\n189–211; Moore 2014). In some cases, criminalizing a wrong will\ninevitably result in selective enforcement, raising concerns about\nselection being made on discriminatory grounds. In others, enforcement\nwould necessitate gross invasions of privacy, and require the law to\ntake sides in conflicts better resolved by the parties themselves.\nThere is often value in freely choosing not to act wrongly, and in so\nchoosing for the right reasons, rather than because one was coerced:\ncriminalizing a wrong may result in this value disappearing from the\nworld. It will almost inevitably divert scarce resources from other\nvaluable priorities. And there is often reason to think that\ncriminalization will not result in there being less wrongdoing in the\nworld. Criminal conduct may be driven underground rather than made\nless common. Institutions of punishment may house unseen abuse and\nvictimization. Ex-offenders may be driven towards crime by their\nreduced prospects in life. Where reasons like these generate a duty\nnot to criminalize a wrong, the conduct in question is no business of\nthe criminal law. There is nothing here to cast doubt on the thought\nthat criminal law’s general justification consists in\npreventing, and holding people responsible for, moral wrongs. \n\nNo-one denies that some things should not be criminalized. What is\nless clear is how we are to work out what these things are. One\napproach is to seek constraints on permissible\ncriminalization. Even if the values that justify having criminal law\ncount in favour of criminalization, our reasons to do so may be\ndefeated by reasons that count against. A constraint identifies\nconditions under which the latter reasons always win. Consider, for\nexample, the wrongfulness constraint: \n\nPrinciples like (W) give us a line we can draw without reference to\n(at least some) morally salient particulars. Conduct that falls\noutside the line may not be criminalized come what may. Imagine we are\nconsidering whether to make it a crime to possess guns. Doing so will\nprevent a great deal of harmful wrongdoing that cannot be prevented\notherwise. This is a powerful moral reason to criminalize. But if (W)\nis sound, and gun possession is not morally wrongful, that powerful\nreason is irrelevant to the decision with which we are faced. We are\nnot permitted to criminalize, however much harm criminalization would\nprevent (Moore 1997, 72–73; Simester and von Hirsch 2011,\n22–23; Duff 2014b, 218–222). \n\nSome suspect that all purported constraints on criminalization fail\n(Duff et al 2014, 44–52; Tadros 2016, 91–107). This is not\nto say that anything goes. It is rather to say that we cannot use a\nline like that drawn by (W) to work out what is permissibly\ncriminalized. To trace the limits of the criminal law, we must engage\nin a more complex normative exercise: we must consider all morally\nsalient particulars of proposed criminal laws—giving those\nparticulars due weight in our deliberations—and thereby\ndetermine whether each proposal should be enacted. The limits of the\ncriminal law cannot be traced in advance of this exercise. Instead,\nthey are determined by it. \n\nThe constraint to which most attention has been paid is the so-called\nharm principle. It is nowadays widely recognised that there is no\nsingle such principle. Rather, there are many harm principles (Tadros\n2011a; Tomlin 2014b; Edwards 2014). One important distinction is\nbetween the harmful conduct principle (HCP) and the\nharm prevention principle (HPP): \n\nThese principles have very different implications. That conduct is\nharmful, or unreasonably risks harm, does not show that we will\nprevent a proportionate amount of harm by criminalizing\nit. Conversely, we may be able to prevent harm only by criminalizing\nconduct that is harmless, and that does not unreasonably risk\nharm. \n\nTo see the first point, consider the use of drugs. Criminalizing use\nmay turn a drug into forbidden fruit that is more attractive to\npotential consumers, and place production in the hands of criminal\ngangs who make consumption ever more harmful. Users may become less\nwilling to seek medical treatment for fear of exposing their\ncriminality, and may end up with criminal records that lead to social\nexclusion, and damage their employment prospects for years to come\n(United Nations 2015). Where criminalization does have these effects,\nthe harm it does is out of all proportion to any harm prevented. Even\nif (HCP) is satisfied, (HPP) is not. \n\nTo see the second point, consider the possession of guns. Possessing a\ngun is not itself harmful. And many possess guns without unreasonably\nrisking harm. If one endorses (HCP), one must either weaken\none’s chosen principle or accept that gun possession cannot be\ncriminalized.  If one endorses (HPP), things are different. What\nmatters is not the effect of each instance of gun possession, but the\neffect of criminalizing all of them: if criminalizing possession will\nprevent harm that would not otherwise be prevented—and do so at\na not disproportionate cost—the fact that some owners possess\nguns safely is beside the point. Whether or not (HCP) is satisfied,\n(HPP) is. \n\nConstraints like (W), (HCP), and (HPP) require clarification. To\napply (W) we need to know what makes something morally wrongful.\nPlausibly enough, it is morally wrongful to \\(\\phi\\) only if there is\ndecisive reason not to \\(\\phi\\). But while this is necessary, it may not\nbe sufficient. I have decisive reason not to go out in the rain without\nmy umbrella. But it does not seem morally wrongful to do so (Tadros\n2016, 11–46). Whatever the correct criterion, we must ask how\nlaw-makers are to apply it. Are law-makers to ask whether most members\nof society believe \\(\\phi\\)ing to be morally wrongful—a\nmatter of conventional morality—or are they to ask whether this\nis what members would ideally believe—a matter of critical\nmorality (Hart 1963; Devlin 1965)? We must also ask whether just any\nmorally wrongful act will do. Some wrongful acts also violate rights,\nsuch that those who commit them wrong others. On one view, it is only\nwhen \\(\\phi\\)ing meets this additional test that it is permissible to\ncriminalize \\(\\phi\\)ing (Feinberg 1984; Stewart 2010). \n\nSome crimes are mala in se—they criminalize conduct\nthat is morally wrongful independently of the law. Most crimes are\nmala prohibita—they criminalize conduct that, if morally\nwrongful at all, is morally wrongful partly in virtue of the fact that\nit is unlawful. Is (W) compatible with the existence of mala\nprohibita? That depends on the extent to which changes in the law\ncan produce changes in morality. The rules of the road are the classic\ncase. Apart from the law, it is morally wrongful to drive dangerously.\nSuch conduct is malum in se. What we should do to conform to\nthis moral norm is not always obvious. To help, the law puts in place\nrules that tell us which side of the road to drive on, when to stop,\nand how fast we may go. Imagine we obey these rules. In doing so, we\ndrive more safely than we otherwise would have: we better conform to\nthe moral norm that prohibits dangerous driving. One proposal is that\nit is morally wrongful to violate legal norms that have this effect:\nthat help us better conform to moral norms that exist independently of\nthe law (Gardner 2011, 19–21). Mala prohibita of this kind\nwould then be compatible with (W). Of course, things are not so\nstraightforward. Even if legal conformity generally improves\nour moral conformity, there may be exceptional cases in which it does\nnot—in which we can violate the rules of the road without putting\nanyone in danger, or in which violation helps keep everyone safe. And\nthere may be people for whom even the generalization is not\ntrue—whose expertise enables them to systematically violate legal\nnorms without creating risks any greater than those created by the rest\nof us. Can an explanation be given of why these violations are\nnonetheless morally wrongful? If not, (W) implies that even morally\nbeneficial mala prohibita—like the rules of the\nroad—must ultimately be removed from the criminal law (Husak\n2008, 103–119; Simester and von Hirsch 2011, 24–29; Wellman 2013).\n \n\nTo apply (HCP) and (HPP) we need a conception of harm. Most views\nare comparative: we are harmed by some event if and only if that event\nrenders us worse off in some way relative to some baseline. One\nchallenge is to identify the relevant baseline. Are we harmed by an\nevent if we are worse than we would have been if things had been\ndifferent? If so, different how? Are we harmed if we are worse off than\nwe were immediately beforehand? Or should we focus not on the position\nwe were or would have been in, but on the position we should have been\nin morally speaking (Holtug 2002; Tadros 2016, 187–200)? A second\nchallenge is to determine in what way we must be worse off. The wider\nour answer to this question, the more likely it is that harm principles\ncollapse into their supposed rivals. Some say we are harmed when our\ninterests are set back (Feinberg 1984, 31–64). But it is plausible to\nthink that we have interests in avoiding disgust, annoyance, and dismay.\nMany people are disgusted, annoyed, or dismayed by what they take to be\nmorally wrongful. On an interest-based view, they are also harmed. Any\nharm principle that uses this notion of harm thus threatens to permit\ncriminalization of much conventional immorality (Devlin 1965). A\nnarrower view has it that we are harmed only if our future prospects\nare reduced, because we are deprived of valuable abilities or\nopportunities (Raz 1986, 413–414; Gardner 2007, 3–4; Simester and von\nHirsch 2011, 36–37). Disgust, annoyance, and offence need not—and\noften do not—have this effect. So they need not be—and\noften are not—harmful. But as blinding pain also need not reduce\none’s prospects in life, it is arguable that this view avoids\ncollapse only at the cost of underinclusion (Tadros 2016, 179–180). \n\nWhatever view of harm we take, we must also decide whether all harms\ncount for the purposes of a given harm principle. People sometimes harm\nthemselves, they are sometimes harmed by natural events, and harm is\nsometimes done consensually. Recall that if we endorse (HPP), we must\ndecide whether the harm criminalization prevents is proportionate to\nthe harm it does. Can we include all the aforementioned harms in our\ncalculations? Or must we only include harm done to others without their\nconsent (Mill 1859; Dworkin 1972; Feinberg 1986; Coons and Weber 2013)?\nSome point out that whatever law-makers’ aims, most criminal laws\nwill prevent some non-consensual harm (Feinberg 1986, 138–142;\nTadros 2016, 103). Be that as it may, whether we take into account\nother harms remains important: where the scales would otherwise point\nagainst criminalization, giving weight to a wider range of harms may\ntip the balance decisively in its favour. \n\nAs well as asking how constraints might be clarified, we must ask how\nthey might be defended. One type of defence proceeds from within\nour theory of ideals. A theory of ideals includes an account\nof the values that bear upon how we should act, and of the priority\nrelations between those values (Hamlin and Stemplowska 2012). To see\nhow such a theory might generate constraints, consider (W). One\nargument for that principle is the argument from conviction\n(Simester and von Hirsch 2011, 19–20): \n\nA second argument is the argument from punishment (Husak\n2008, 92–103): \n\nOne response to these arguments is that criminal law does not always\ncensure or stigmatize. Another is that the arguments rely on priority\nclaims that cannot be sustained. The argument from conviction depends\non our accepting that moral defamation cannot be justified. The\nargument from punishment depends on our accepting that those who do\nnot act wrongly have an absolute right not to be punished. These\nclaims may be too strong. To test the second, think again about\npossession of guns. Imagine that we criminalize possession, and that\nwe have good reason to think that we can thereby save many\nlives. \\(D\\) possesses a gun safely because \\(D\\) likes how it looks\nhanging on the wall. We can grant that \\(D\\) would act wrongly if\n\\(D\\)’s conduct risked harm to others, or prevented the state\nfrom saving others’ lives. But as \\(D\\)’s possession is\nsafe, and the state has in fact criminalized possession, neither is\nthe case. Would the state violate \\(D\\)’s rights if it punished\n\\(D\\)? It is plausible to think not. \\(D\\) could very easily have\nrefrained from possessing the gun. And if the state were to refrain\nfrom punishing safe possessors like \\(D\\), more people would be likely\nto possess guns in the mistaken belief that this was safe. This would\nlikely result in some lives being lost. The fact that not punishing\nsafe possessors would probably have this effect is a good reason to\nthink that safe possessors lack a valid complaint if they are\npunished.  It is a good reason to think that it sometimes is\npermissible to punish the morally innocent. If it is, premise (3) of\nthe argument from punishment is false (Tadros 2016,\n329–333). \n\nNow consider (HPP). We can imagine a world in which we could flick a\nswitch, sending an electronic signal to \\(D\\)’s brain, the only\neffect of which would be that \\(D\\) would not act wrongly. Whatever one\nthinks of this means of prevention, it is not the means we utilize when\nwe make use of criminal law. Absent perfect compliance, criminal law\nprevents wrongs by publicly making accusations, condemning people as\nwrongdoers, and punishing them for their wrongs. Public accusations\noften stick even if nothing comes of them. Punishment is harmful by its\nvery nature. The lives of \\(D\\)’s family and friends are collateral\ndamage as \\(D\\)’s prospects are reduced. Some claim that we can\njustify causing such harm—at least when the state does the\nharming—only if this is a necessary and proportionate means of\npreventing people being harmed. So it is impermissible to criminalize\nwhen this condition is not satisfied. Hence (HPP) (Raz 1986, 418–420;\nEdwards 2014, 259–262). \n\nOne might reply that the harm internal to justified punishment is\nharm we lack reason not to impose. Leaving this aside, it is\nfar from obvious that harm has lexical priority over other values. The\nabove argument for (HPP) seems to depend on this claim. But there is\nwrongdoing that is both serious and harmless. Imagine \\(D\\) violates the\nbodily integrity or sexual autonomy of an unconscious \\(V\\), but this is\nnever discovered and has no further effects (Gardner and Shute 2000;\nRipstein 2006, 218–229). It is plausible to think that the value of\npreventing such wrongs, even when this does not prevent harm, is at\nleast sometimes capable of justifying the harm done by criminalization\n(Tadros 2016, 106–107). \n\nA second defence of constraints proceeds from within non-ideal\ntheory: from our account of what should be done when some people\nwill not act as they should. One might say that all criminal\nlaw theory is part of non-ideal theory—that we have reason to\nhave criminal law precisely because people will (otherwise) act\nwrongly. Be that as it may. As well as fallible agents who (would\notherwise) commit crimes, there are fallible agents who make, apply, and\nenforce criminal laws. Any non-ideal theory must also take account of\nthe errors the latter are disposed to make. Some are errors of\napplication and enforcement—errors made when police officers\narrest, prosecutors charge, and courts punish the innocent. More\nimportant for present purposes are the errors law-makers are disposed\nto make when creating crimes. These errors matter here for the\nfollowing reason. Prescriptive norms are often justified on the grounds\nthat they prevent/mitigate errors that would be made in their absence\n(Schauer 1991, 135–166). If followed, speed limits prevent some drivers\nfrom driving in ways that are impeccable in isolation. But the limits\nare justified if they prevent/mitigate errors that drivers would make\nif we did without speed limits, and if preventing/mitigating the errors\nis worth the cost of preventing some driving that is otherwise\nimpeccable. Let us grant that, when followed, constraints like (W) or\n(HPP) prevent some law-makers from criminalizing in ways that are\nimpeccable in isolation. The constraints may be justified if they\nprevent/mitigate errors law-makers would make if they did without them,\nand if preventing/mitigating the errors is worth the cost of preventing\ncriminalization that is otherwise impeccable. \n\nMany defenders of (HPP) offer defences that proceed in the manner\njust described. One error is that of underestimating the value in lives\nvery different from our own: of mistaking the virtues required to\nsucceed in those lives for vices, and of concluding that these supposed\nvices ought to be suppressed (Raz 1986, 401–407; Gardner 2007,\n118–120). A second error is that of underestimating the value of\ntoleration. That value includes making space for experiments in living,\nwhich both help combat prejudice by exposing people to the unfamiliar,\nand help people develop deliberative faculties by exposing them to that\nwith which they disagree (Mill 1859; Brink 2013). A third error is that\nof underestimating the harm one’s policies do to those who live\nin very different circumstances (Green 2013b, 202). If the main effects\nof criminalizing drug use are felt in communities the affluent shun, it\nis not hard to see how law-makers could be blind to the amount of\ndamage criminalization does. Law-makers who make each of these errors\nwill be tempted to create criminal laws that are anything but\nimpeccable—laws designed to suppress activities the value in\nwhich has been missed, which do much more harm than their designers\nanticipated. The case for (HPP) is that it stands in the way of this\ntemptation. Those who follow it must tolerate conduct—however\noffensive or immoral they deem it to be—unless they can show that\ncriminalization is a necessary and proportionate means of preventing\nharm. \n\nHarm-based arguments are nowadays ubiquitous when proposed criminal\nlaws are discussed. Some think this shows that (HPP) is no constraint\nat all (Harcourt 1999). But it is no surprise that those who merely pay\nlip service to a principle are not constrained by it. The argument of\nthe previous paragraph was an argument that (HPP) should be\nfollowed. To follow that principle is to take seriously the\nneed for an empirical showing—grounded in adequate\nevidence—that a given law is necessary to prevent a proportionate\namount of harm. A better objection is that the error-based argument is\nincomplete. How widespread would error be if law-makers took themselves\nto be free of (HPP)? When are the benefits of following (HPP)—in\nerrors prevented—worth the costs—in otherwise impeccable\ncriminal laws? Might there be some other rule that brings us those\nbenefits at a lower cost than (HPP)? We need answers to all these\nquestions, and more, to know if an argument from within non-ideal\ntheory can support (HPP) (Tadros 2016, 94–96). \n\nA number of other possible constraints on the criminal law have been\nproposed (Dan-Cohen 2002, 150–171; Ripstein 2006). As mentioned\nearlier, some are skeptical of all such principles. To determine the\nlimits of the criminal law, they think, we must refer to a ‘more\ndisorderly set of considerations’, none of which gives us\nanything as simple as a (set of) constraint(s): the resulting account\nof criminal law’s limits will be ‘messier’ than its\nrivals; but this is ‘what the messy worlds in which we live\nrequire’ (Duff et al 2014, 51–52). The correct response to\nthis skepticism remains unclear. One possibility is that a defensible\ngeneral line can indeed be found. The question is where the line is,\nand how it is to be defended against objections like those sketched\nabove. A second possibility is that we need the ‘messier’\ntheory. If so, we must ask what shape that theory ought to take, and\nhow lofty should be the ambitions of those who construct it. We need\nto know how much order can be imposed, at the theoretical level, on\nthe ‘disorderly set of considerations’ with which we are\nconfronted (for one answer, see Tadros 2016, 159–172). As the\ncriminal law’s scope in many jurisdictions continues to expand\nat a dizzying pace, these remain the most urgent questions facing\ntoday’s philosophers of criminal law. \n\nImagine that \\(D\\) takes \\(V\\)’s property without \\(V\\)’s consent.\nIs \\(D\\) criminally responsible for the taking? Not necessarily. In English\nlaw, \\(D\\) commits the offence of theft only if \\(D\\) acts dishonestly, and\nintends for \\(V\\) to be deprived of her property permanently. Theft\nis one of many offences commission of which depends on one’s\nstate of mind. Elements of offences that require particular mental\nstates are known as mens rea elements. Other elements are\nknown as actus reus elements. \n\nSome claim that if \\(D\\) satisfies all elements of an offence—if D\ncommits the actus reus with mens rea—this\nsuffices to make \\(D\\) criminally responsible, but not to make D\ncriminally liable. Responsibility is understood here as\nanswerability (Duff 2007, 19–36). While we are answerable to the courts\nfor committing offences, we may avoid liability by offering\nsatisfactory answers in the form of defences. This account of criminal\nresponsibility—call it the answerability\naccount—relies on a distinction between offence and defence\nto which we will return. One argument for the answerability account\ninvokes rules of criminal procedure and evidence. To obtain a\nconviction, the prosecution must prove that \\(D\\) committed the offence\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. \\(D\\) can safely remain silent in the absence of\nsuch proof. If the prosecution makes its case, \\(D\\) has strong prudential\nreasons to prove a defence: without one, \\(D\\) will be convicted and\npunished. The best explanation of these rules, so the argument goes, is\nthat offending acts generate a duty to answer that is otherwise absent.\nThis duty explains why, when we have strong reason to believe \\(D\\) to be\nan offender, we put \\(D\\) under extra rational pressure to explain herself\nin court. \n\nSome think that, on closer inspection, our rules of procedure and\nevidence fail to support the answerability account, and help to\nundermine it. Those rules tell prosecutors to consider evidence\nboth that \\(D\\) committed an offence and that \\(D\\) lacks a\ndefence. If there is strong evidence that \\(D\\) killed in self-defence, D\nshould not be prosecuted. This matters here for the following reason.\nWhen prosecutors decide whether to prosecute, they are deciding whether\nD should be called to answer for what \\(D\\) did. The fact that prosecutors\nshould not prosecute if \\(D\\) clearly killed in self-defence,\nsuggests that those who have defences are not answerable in court. It\nsuggests that we owe the criminal courts answers not for acts that are\noffences but for acts that are crimes—for\noffending acts which do not satisfy an available defence. Obviously\nenough, it is for crimes that we are criminally liable. If\nresponsibility is answerability, and we are answerable for crimes, the\nconditions of criminal responsibility and the conditions of criminal\nliability are one and the same. The answerability account, as described\nabove, then fails (Duarte d’Almeida 2015, 239–267). \nOn any view, the conditions under which \\(D\\) commits an offence are\nconditions of criminal responsibility. What should these conditions be?\nThere has been much discussion of the mens rea principle\n(MR): \n\nStandard mens rea requirements include intention and\nrecklessness. Paradigmatically, we intend \\(X\\) if, and only if, \\(X\\) is one\nof our reasons for acting: if, and only if, we act in order to bring \\(X\\)\nabout. We are reckless about \\(X\\) if, and only if, (i) we are aware there\nis a risk of \\(X\\), and (ii) running the risk of which we are aware is\nunjustified. \n\nWhether criminal responsibility should require mens rea,\nand what mens rea it should require, both depend on the\nreasons we have to accept (MR). Perhaps the most familiar defence\nappeals to the culpability principle (C): \n\nCulpability, as that term is used here, is a moral notion. It is\nsynonymous with moral fault or moral blameworthiness. Mens rea\nis not sufficient for culpability—even intentional killings are\nsometimes excused. But it may well be necessary—culpability may\npresuppose at least some element of mens rea (Simester 2013;\ncf. Gardner 2007, 227–232). If this is so, the debate shifts to whether\nwe should accept (C). One worry about this principle is its generality.\nThe consequences of criminal liability are not always especially\nburdensome. And the benefits of liability without culpability may be\nespecially significant. To take but one example, think of regulations\nthat govern the activities of corporations, and which protect the\nhealth and safety of the public at large. Making it a criminal offence\nto violate these regulations, and imposing hefty fines, need have none\nof the destructive effects of imprisoning individuals. Dispensing with\nculpability requirements may increase the deterrent effects of the law,\nby making it harder for violators to escape conviction. Whether (C) is\nsound depends on whether effects like these—which, ex\nhypothesi, protect the health and safety of many—can justify\nimposing criminal liability without culpability. \n\nThat (C) may admit of exceptions does not, of course, show that (C)\nis not generally sound. I suggested above that, where (C) does apply,\nit entails (MR). How much mens rea (C) requires is a further\nquestion. Take the offence of causing death by dangerous driving. The\nactus reus of the crime requires two things: \\(D\\)’s driving\nmust exhibit deficiencies that we reasonably expect a qualified driver\nto avoid, and those deficiencies must cause the death of another\nperson. Some think that (C) calls for two mens rea\nrequirements: \\(D\\) must have been aware of the deficiencies that made her\ndriving dangerous, and she must have been aware of a risk that they\nwould cause death. The idea that each actus reus element\nshould have a corresponding mens rea element is known as the\ncorrespondence principle (Ashworth 2008). Whether (C) in fact\nsupports that principle is a matter of debate. It is sometimes the case\nthat the risk of causing some harmful outcome (like death) helps make\nit the case that an act (like dangerous driving) is wrongful. There is\nan internal connection, in these cases, between our assessment of the\nact and the risk of the outcome. Some claim that where this internal\nconnection exists, \\(D\\)’s awareness that she was engaged in the\nwrongful act establishes that she is culpable for the harmful\noutcome. If this is right, \\(D\\) need not have any mens rea as to\nthat outcome in order to be culpable for it when it occurs: the\ncorrespondence principle cannot be derived from (C) (Simester 2005,\n44–46; Duff 2005, 143–147). \n\nA second defence of (MR) appeals to the rule of law (RL): \n\nConformity to (RL) is a matter of degree. But an especially high\ndegree of conformity is expected of the criminal law. One reason for\nthis is the special powers criminal law confers on \\(D\\)’s accusers.\nAnother is the damage a guilty verdict does to the life of the accused.\nThe connection between (RL) and (MR) is clearly stated by Gardner: \n\nIf \\(D\\) must be aware of those aspects of her actions that make them of\ninterest to the criminal law, she is less likely to be ambushed by\ncriminal offences that prohibit those actions. In this way, mens\nrea requirements contribute to personal autonomy by increasing our\nability to steer our lives away from criminal conviction and\npunishment. So (RL) supports (MR). Does it also support the\ncorrespondence principle? This is less clear. One view has it that\n\\(D\\)’s awareness of the facts that made her driving dangerous\ndisqualifies \\(D\\) from complaining that she was ambushed by liability for\n\\(V\\)’s death (at least as long as said liability was adequately\npublicized). On another view, \\(D\\)’s autonomy not only counts in\nfavour of helping \\(D\\) to anticipate criminal liability, it also\ncounts in favour of helping \\(D\\) to anticipate its legal consequences,\nsuch that \\(D\\) can decide if the price of those consequences is worth\npaying (Hart 1968, 47; Ashworth 2008). If it does not occur to \\(D\\) that\n\\(\\phi\\)ing might cause death, it also does not occur to \\(D\\) that \\(\\phi\\)ing\nmight result in her suffering the additional punishment prescribed for\ncausing it. \\(D\\) is more likely to factor this information into her\ndecision-making if the criminal law insists that \\(D\\) is aware of the\nrisk—if it insists on correspondence between actus reus\nand mens rea. \n\nA third argument for (MR) appeals to liberty (Simester and Chan\n2011, 393–395). Consider an offence that prohibits damaging other\npeople’s property. If the mens rea requirement is one of\nintent, \\(D\\) is free to knowingly take risks with \\(V\\)’s possessions.\nIf the mens rea requires awareness, \\(D\\) is free to put \\(V\\)’s\npossessions in harm’s way without giving thought to the risks. If\nthere is no mens rea at all, no amount of care will help \\(D\\) if\nshe causes property to be damaged. These examples help show that\nmens rea requirements affect the range of options legally\navailable to \\(D\\). Obviously enough, the degree to which we should care\nabout taking options off the table depends on how much value they have.\nThis makes the liberty-protecting role of mens rea especially\nimportant where criminal responsibility extends beyond paradigmatic\ncases of wrongdoing. Consider the law of complicity. Under what\nconditions should S be criminally responsible for participating in\nwrongs committed by P? Imagine it is sufficient that S realises P might\nact wrongly. Anyone who sells goods that are liable to misuse is then\nin danger of being turned into a criminal by their customers.\nShopkeepers must run the gauntlet or close their doors. Narrower\nmens rea requirements enable them to both stay in business and\nensure they remain on the right side of the law (Simester 2006,\n591–592). \n\nIt is worth concluding this section by returning to two questions\ndistinguished at its outset: (i) should criminal responsibility require\nmens rea? (ii) what mens rea should it require?\nQuestion (i) is often discussed under the heading of strict liability.\nThe literature distinguishes between various senses in which liability\ncan be strict (Duff 2005; Gardner 2005, 68–69; Simester 2005, 22–23).\nCriminal liability for \\(\\phi\\)ing is substantively strict if we\ncan \\(\\phi\\) without being culpable for \\(\\phi\\)ing. It is formally\nstrict if \\(\\phi\\)ing lacks elements of mens rea. This second category can\nitself be subdivided. Liability is formally strict in the strong\nsense when there is no mens rea element at all. Liability\nis formally strict in the weak sense when at least one\nactus reus element has no corresponding element of mens\nrea. If (C) is a sound principle, criminal liability should not be\nsubstantively strict. If (MR) is sound, there should be no criminal\nliability that is formally strict in the strong sense. If the\ncorrespondence principle is sound, liability that is formally strict in\nthe weak sense also should not exist. \n\nSo much for question (i). What about question (ii)? The above\ndiscussion assumed that mens rea at the very least requires\nawareness. But criminal liability sometimes turns not on what D\nnoticed, but on what \\(D\\) failed to notice—on circumstances that\nwould have caused a reasonable person to refrain from doing what \\(D\\) did.\nIt is where such circumstances exist that \\(D\\)’s actions are\nnegligent. Some writers claim that negligence has no place in criminal\nlaw. If (C) is sound, and culpability requires awareness, then criminal\nliability should require recklessness at the very least. Others take a\ndifferent view. They claim that when we are unaware of risks because of\nvices like arrogance or indifference, this makes us culpable\nfor running those risks. So (C) is compatible with at least some\ninstances of negligence liability in criminal law (Hart 1968, 136–157;\nSimester 2000, Alexander and Ferzan 2009, 69–85; Moore and Hurd\n2011). \n\nWhether or not mens rea should be necessary for criminal\nresponsibility, it is rarely claimed that it should be sufficient. The\nwidespread belief that we should not countenance thought crimes, leads\nmost writers to claim that there should be an actus reus\nelement to each criminal offence. Paradigmatically, this element is\nsatisfied only if \\(D\\) acts in a way that causes some outcome, such\nas death, or property damage, or fear of violence. This paradigm does,\nof course, admit of a number of exceptions. As well as inchoate\noffences—like attempts or conspiracies—most systems of\ncriminal law include liability for some omissions. Imagine \\(D\\) sees\n\\(V\\) drowning in a shallow pond and chooses to do nothing. There is\nno prior connection between \\(D\\) and \\(V\\). If the pond is in London,\n\\(D\\) commits no offence. Move the drama to Paris and we have\nourselves a crime. As this example suggests, both academics and legal\nsystems remain divided over the positive obligations that should be\nimposed by criminal law (Alexander 2002; Ashworth 2015). \n\nExceptions aside, the building blocks of our paradigm are each open\nto interpretation. Consider, for instance, the need for causation. Is\nthe conclusion that \\(D\\) caused \\(V\\)’s death a matter of physical\nfact—something that is, in Hume’s well-known phrase, part\nof the cement of the universe? Or do the rules of causation—at\nleast in criminal law—lie downstream of moral judgments about the\nfair attribution of responsibility? Does the truth, perhaps, lie\nsomewhere in between? (Hart and Honoré 1959; Moore 2009b;\nSimester 2017). The criminal liability of many—as well as the\npunishments they face—turns on the answer we give to such\nquestions. \n\nAcademic debate about causation and omissions largely takes our\nparadigm for granted. Some writers, however, take a more radical view:\nthey favour a paradigm shift in our thinking about criminal\nresponsibility. One group of radicals focuses on outcomes. Imagine D\nshoots at \\(V\\), intending to cause death. In any system of criminal law\nthis is an attempt. The radicals claim that what happens next should\nmake no difference: \\(D\\) should be convicted of the same crime whether or\nnot \\(V\\) is killed. Criminal responsibility, in short, should be\ninsensitive to the outcomes of what we do (Ashworth 1993; Alexander and\nFerzan 2009, 171–196). Consider again what I earlier called (C): \n\nIf this principle is sound, we can offer the following argument: \n\nThis argument relies on the following suppressed premise: \n\nIt is only if (2\\('\\)) is true that we never control outcomes.\nAlas, (2\\('\\)) has unpalatable implications. Uncontrolled factors do\nnot only bear on whether we succeed. They also bear on whether we try,\non the choices we make, and on the character traits that influence our\nchoices. (2\\('\\)) implies that we are never culpable for any of these\nthings—for our successes, our endeavours, our choices or our\ncharacter. Pursued to its logical conclusion, it implies that we are\nnever culpable for anything (Nagel 1979; Moore 1997, 233–246). If, as\nmost people believe, we sometimes are culpable for what we do,\n(2\\('\\)) must be false. We can add that (3) radically understates the\nconclusion of the argument offered above. When combined with (C), that\nargument does not imply that we should not be criminally responsible\nfor outcomes. It implies that no one should ever be criminally\nresponsible. \n\nWe might try to salvage the argument from (1)–(3) by revising our\naccount of control: \n\nThis revision avoids the unpalatable implications of (2\\('\\)). But\nit also renders the argument from (1)–(3) invalid. If (2\\(''\\))\nstates the correct account of control, we do sometimes have\ncontrol over outcomes. Imagine \\(D\\) holds a loaded gun to \\(V\\)’s head\nand pulls the trigger. \\(D\\) has a reasonable chance—indeed, an\nextremely high chance—of killing \\(V\\). On this account of control,\n(1) and (2) do not support (3): they give us no reason to accept that\nwe are never criminally responsible for outcomes (Moore 2009,\n24–26). \n\nWe have already seen that, for some, we are criminally responsible\nfor committing offences and criminally liable for committing\ncrimes. This distinction relies on a further distinction\nbetween offences and defences: crimes are committed by those who\nsatisfy all the elements of an offence, without satisfying all the\nelements of any available defence. \n\nOne account of the offence/defence distinction is\nprocedural. Offence elements must be proved if conviction is\nto be the legally correct verdict of the court. So if absence of\nconsent is an offence-element—as it is in the offences created,\nin England and Wales, by the Sexual Offences Act 2003—it must be\nproved that consent was absent or \\(D\\) must be acquitted. The same is not\ntrue of defence elements, like those that make up the defence of\nduress. For a conviction to be correctly entered, it need not be proved\nthat \\(D\\) did not act under duress. It is enough that there is no evidence\nthat \\(D\\) acted under duress. The same is true where consent is a\ndefence-element—as it is in the offences created, in England and\nWales, by the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. If \\(D\\) punches \\(V\\) and\nis charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the court need\nnot be convinced that \\(V\\) did not consent. If the issue of consent never\ncomes up, a conviction may still be the legally correct verdict of the\ncourt. Simply put, that \\(D\\) satisfied each offence element is something\nthat must be proved. Whether \\(D\\) satisfied each defence element can\nremain uncertain. It is in this procedural distinction, on the view\nunder consideration, that the offence/defence distinction consists\n(Duarte d’Almeida 2015). \n\nThis last claim is denied by those who believe that the\noffence/defence distinction is substantive. These writers\naccept that offences and defences are governed by different procedural\nrules. Their claim is that the distinction between offences and\ndefences explains why those rules differ. Perhaps the most\nwell-known version of this view runs as follows. Offence elements are\nindividually necessary, and jointly sufficient, to describe an act\nthat there is general reason not to perform. Defence elements block\nthe transition from the existence of that reason to the conclusion\nthat \\(D\\) ought to be convicted of a crime. On this view, whether we\nshould think of the absence of consent as an element of the offence of\nsexual assault, depends on whether we think that there is a general\nreason not to have consensual sex with others. If there is no such\nreason, the absence of consent is necessary to give us an act we have\ngeneral reason not to perform. So it is an element of the offence of\nsexual assault. If, on the other hand, there is a general\nreason not to have consensual sex, consent is properly thought of as a\ndefence to sexual assault (Campbell 1987; Gardner 2007,\n144–149). \n\nIn addition to distinguishing between offences and defences, many\nwriters distinguish between types of criminal defence. The most\nfamiliar distinction is between justifications and excuses. The most\nfamiliar account of the distinction has it that while justified actors\ndeny wrongdoing, excused actors deny either responsibility or\nculpability (Austin 1956; Fletcher 1978; Greenawalt 1984; Baron 2005).\nTwo questions are worth asking here. Is the familiar distinction worth\ndrawing? If so, is the familiar account of the distinction the right\nway to draw it? \n\nThere are two reasons to answer the first question in the\naffirmative. One invokes (C). If courts are to develop criminal\ndefences so that their contours track culpability, they need to know\nwhy each defence makes it the case that those who plead it are\nnot culpable. Is there a defence of necessity because we sometimes do\nthe right thing by choosing the lesser of two evils? Or does the\ndefence exist because actors sometimes make wrongful choices under\nenormous pressure, and because there is sometimes nothing culpable\nabout giving into the pressure? How courts should develop the defence\ndepends on how they answer these questions. It depends on whether they\nconceive of the defence as a justification or an excuse. \n\nA second reason to make the familiar distinction invokes the idea\nthat criminal trials call defendants to account. On this view, trials\nare in one way continuous with life outside the law—they\ninstitutionalize our ordinary moral practice of making and replying to\naccusations (Gardner 2007, 177–200; Duff, 2010c; 2011; 2013a). When\naccused of wrongdoing in our everyday lives, most of us do not only\ncare about whether we end up being blamed. Where we did nothing wrong,\nwe try to convince our accusers that this is the case: it matters to us\nthat others not add wrongs to the story of our lives, even if we know\nthat they will otherwise conclude that we acted blamelessly. There is\nno reason to think that things are different in criminal courts: that\nthose accused of crime should, or do, care only about getting off the\nhook. By retaining distinct justificatory and excusatory defences, the\ncriminal law gives effect to our interests in presenting\nourselves—to our accusers and to others—in the best\navailable rational light (Gardner 2007, 133). \n\nLet us turn, then, to the second of our questions. Is it true that\njustifications deny wrongdoing? Is it true that excuses deny\nresponsibility? Some think both questions should at least sometimes be\nanswered in the negative. True, those who act in self-defence\nplausibly benefit from an exception to the duty not to harm\nothers. Having placed \\(D\\) under attack, many think, \\(V\\) has no\nright that \\(D\\) not use necessary and proportionate force against\n\\(V\\) (McMahan 2005). But the same is not true when \\(D\\) harms an\ninnocent bystander, even if this is the only way to prevent even\ngreater harm to others. \\(V\\)’s right remains, it is often\nthought, but is sometimes overridden. So \\(D\\) still wrongs\n\\(V\\). That wrong is justified when and because \\(D\\) has undefeated\nreasons to commit it—reasons given by the greater harm prevented\nby \\(D\\). If this is right, those who plead a justification do not\nalways deny, but sometimes concede, wrongdoing. It is the wrong that\nthey then try to justify (Gardner 2007, 77–82). \n\nThe familiar account might be thought to be on firmer ground when it\ncomes to excuses. Grant that to plead an excuse is indeed to deny\nculpability. The same is true of a justification. So there is nothing\nhere to distinguish the two. Do excuses, then, deny responsibility? At\nleast sometimes, they do not. True, those who plead insanity deny that\nthey were capable of responding to reasons when they acted. But this\nis not true of other excusatory pleas. Imagine \\(T\\) bursts into\n\\(D\\)’s house and threatens to shoot \\(D\\) unless \\(D\\) shoots\n\\(V\\). If \\(D\\) pleads duress, \\(D\\) relies on the fact that her capacity\nto respond to reasons remained intact: her plea is that she\noffended in order to avoid the harm threatened by \\(T\\), and in\ndoing so lived up to our reasonable expectations. \\(D\\) thereby\nasserts rather than denies responsibility for an offending act\n(Gardner 2007, 82–87). This does not mean that duress is a\njustification. \\(V\\)’s right to life defeats the reasons \\(D\\)\nhas to save her own. \\(D\\) has a defence because we do not expect any\nmore from someone in \\(D\\)’s predicament—because we can\nunderstand why saving her own life seemed a good enough reason to\n\\(D\\) (Simester 2012, 105). \n\nTwo points emerge from these remarks. One is that the familiar account\nof the justification/excuse distinction should be rejected. The second\nis that a bipartite classification of criminal defences obscures\ndistinctions we have reason to make. Some respond by distinguishing\ndenials of responsibility (like insanity) from excuses (like duress),\nand distinguishing both from justifications (like self-defence and\nnecessity). Excuses and justifications, so understood, are\nboth assertions of responsibility and denials of\nculpability. Justified actors have undefeated reasons for their\nactions. Excused actors live up to reasonable expectations despite\nlacking such reasons (Gardner 2007, 91–139; Simester 2012, 99–108).\nThough this tripartite classification is an improvement, some maintain\nthat further distinctions should be drawn (Duff 2007, 263–298; Simester\n2012). Just how numerous the categories of criminal defence are (or\nought to be) is a topic for future work. \n\nImagine there are reasons to believe that \\(D\\) is criminally responsible\nfor having \\(\\phi\\)ed. What may officials of the criminal justice\nsystem do in response to those reasons? What should they do, and\nrefrain from doing? \n\nAs a matter of law, the answer depends on norms of criminal\nprocedure and evidence. Some of these norms confer powers and\npermissions that help officials build their case against \\(D\\). Think of\nstop and search, intrusive forms of surveillance, and pre-trial\ndetention. Other norms regulate the kinds of evidence that may be used\nagainst \\(D\\) in court. Think of hearsay, or statistical evidence, or\nevidence of \\(D\\)’s bad (or good) character (Ho 2008; Redmayne 2015).\nYet other norms govern the way in which one aspect of the criminal\njustice system should respond to the misconduct of others. Imagine\nevidence against \\(D\\) was gathered illegally, or that \\(D\\) was entrapped, or\nthat \\(D\\)’s case should have been discontinued according to the\nguidelines prosecutors set for themselves. Should the courts throw out\n\\(D\\)’s case, even where the evidence against \\(D\\) is strong? If so, on\nwhat grounds should they do so? (Ashworth 2000; Duff et al 2007,\n225–257). \n\nThe norms I have mentioned are somewhat neglected by philosophers of\ncriminal law. Things are different when it comes to the so-called\npresumption of innocence (PI). The most well-known judicial formulation\nof (PI) is found in Woolmington v. DPP [1935] UKHL 1: \n\nSo understood, (PI) allocates the burden of proof in criminal trials\nto those on the accusing side. Many add that \\(D\\)’s accusers must\nmeet an especially high standard of proof—they must eliminate all\nreasonable doubt to secure a conviction. Though these points are widely\naccepted, they leave open a range of further questions about the scope\nand basis of (PI). The following remarks touch on just some (for an\noverview, see Lippke 2016). \n\nOne question is whether (PI) has implications for criminal procedure\nthat extend beyond the criminal trial. On one view, (PI) just\nis a norm that governs the burden and standard of proof at trial.\nOn another, (PI) is something more expansive: it is a norm that tells\ncriminal justice officials—and, perhaps, the rest of us\ntoo—how to interact with others, including those suspected of\ncrime (Stewart 2014, Duff 2013b). That norm of course has implications\nfor the moment of trial. But its implications extend both backwards\nand forwards from that point in time. They extend backwards to\ndecisions about whether to arrest, prosecute, or detain those\nsuspected of criminality (Ashworth 2006, 249; Duff 2013b,\n180–185; Stewart 2014, 414). And they extend forwards to\ndecisions both about how much to punish (Tomlin 2014a), and about the\nappropriate collateral consequences of conviction and punishment (Duff\n2013b, 185–192). \n\nA second question is whether (PI) has implications for the\nsubstantive criminal law. Some writers—and most\ncourts—think not. They give (PI) a purely procedural\ninterpretation (Roberts 2005; Lippke 2016). It has been argued,\nhowever, that all such interpretations are implausibly narrow (Tadros\n2007; 2014; Tomlin 2013). Imagine it is an offence to possess\ninformation of a kind that might be useful to terrorists, with the\nintention of committing acts of terror. Intentions like this are often\ndifficult to prove. Legislators might respond by shifting the burden of\nproof to D: they might make it the case that, once the prosecution\nproves possession, it is for \\(D\\) to prove the absence of intention. The\nWoolmington formulation suggests that this move violates (PI).\nNow imagine a creative legislature simply eliminates the requirement of\nintention from the law: it becomes a crime to possess information of a\nkind that might be useful to terrorists, whatever the\npossessor’s intentions might be. Assuming that the\nprosecution must prove every element of the revised offence, this move\nbrings the law into conformity with a purely procedural (PI). Now most\nwriters—and most human rights treaties—consider (PI) to be\nan important right that protects criminal suspects against the state.\nExamples like the above show that the purely procedural interpretation\nhas the following implication: legislators who offer suspects\nless protection somehow better conform to the right.\nNot only is this counterintuitive, it renders the right toothless in\nthe face of legislative creativity (Tadros 2014). This is, some\nconclude, sufficient reason to reject the purely procedural (PI). \n\nImagine \\(D\\) is charged with a criminal offence and pleads not guilty.\nOn the purely procedural view, (PI) makes it a precondition of\nconviction and punishment that the prosecution prove \\(D\\) satisfied all\nelements of the offence. What those elements are is a separate\nquestion. Some endorse a revised view that makes (PI) more demanding.\nThese writers distinguish between elements of offences, and the wrongs\ntaken by offence-creators to justify convicting and punishing\noffenders. (PI), they claim, not only requires proof that \\(D\\) satisfied\nthe former; it also requires proof that \\(D\\) committed the latter (Tadros\n2007; 2014). \n\nTo see the difference this revision makes, imagine legislators make\nit an offence to possess information that might be useful to\nterrorists. An intention to commit acts of terror is no element of the\noffence as legislated. Our legislators do not, however, think that all\nthose who possess such information should be convicted and punished.\nThis, they know, would be ridiculous overkill. They think that\npossessors who intend to commit acts of terror should be convicted and\npunished. This element of intention is omitted from the offence,\nbecause omitting it makes securing convictions easier for prosecutors,\nthereby reducing the risk that those planning acts of terror will get\noff the hook. (PI), on the revised view, nonetheless requires proof of\nthe intent: ex hypothesi, it is possession with an intention\nto commit acts of terror that is taken by law-makers to justify\nconvicting and punishing offenders. To comply with (PI), criminal\ncourts must demand proof that \\(D\\) committed this wrong as a precondition\nof conviction and punishment. \n\nSo understood, (PI) is anything but toothless. It is often claimed,\nnowadays, that too few suspected wrongdoers are convicted of crimes,\nand that new criminal laws are needed to help secure more convictions.\nOn the revised view, legislators can create as many criminal laws as\nthey want in pursuit of this objective. But no-one who pleads not\nguilty may be convicted under them without proof that they are the\nwrongdoers they are suspected of being. That it provides anyone who\nfaces criminal charges with this kind of protection against the law,\nis what makes the case for the revised (PI).","contact.mail":"james.edwards@law.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"law.ox.ac.uk"}]
