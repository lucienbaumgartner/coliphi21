Rationalists claim that there are significant ways in which\nour concepts and knowledge are gained independently of sense\nexperience. Empiricists claim that sense experience is the ultimate\nsource of all our concepts and knowledge.\n\n\nRationalists generally develop their view in two ways. First, they\nargue that there are cases where the content of our concepts or\nknowledge outstrips the information that sense experience can provide.\nSecond, they construct accounts of how reason in some form or other\nprovides that additional information about the world. Empiricists\npresent complementary lines of thought. First, they develop accounts\nof how experience provides the information that rationalists cite,\ninsofar as we have it in the first place. (Empiricists will at times\nopt for skepticism as an alternative to rationalism: if experience\ncannot provide the concepts or knowledge the rationalists cite, then\nwe don’t have them.) Second, empiricists attack the\nrationalists’ accounts of how reason is a source of concepts or\nknowledge.\n\nThe dispute between rationalism and empiricism takes place within\nepistemology, the branch of philosophy devoted to studying the nature,\nsources and limits of knowledge. The defining questions of\nepistemology include the following. \nWhat is the nature of propositional knowledge, knowledge that a\nparticular proposition about the world is true? \nTo know a proposition, we must believe it and it must be true, but\nsomething more is required, something that distinguishes knowledge\nfrom a lucky guess. Let’s call this additional element\n‘warrant’. A good deal of philosophical work has been\ninvested in trying to determine the nature of warrant. \nHow can we gain knowledge? \nWe can form true beliefs just by making lucky guesses. How to gain\nwarranted beliefs is less clear. Moreover, to know the world, we must\nthink about it, and it is unclear how we gain the concepts we use in\nthought or what assurance, if any, we have that the ways in which we\ndivide up the world using our concepts correspond to divisions that\nactually exist. \nWhat are the limits of our knowledge? \nSome aspects of the world may be within the limits of our thought but\nbeyond the limits of our knowledge; faced with competing descriptions\nof them, we cannot know which description is true. Some aspects of the\nworld may even be beyond the limits of our thought, so that we cannot\nform intelligible descriptions of them, let alone know that a\nparticular description is true. \nThe disagreement between rationalists and empiricists primarily\nconcerns the second question, regarding the sources of our concepts\nand knowledge. In some instances, their disagreement on this topic\nleads them to give conflicting responses to the other questions as\nwell. They may disagree over the nature of warrant or about the limits\nof our thought and knowledge. Our focus here will be on the competing\nrationalist and empiricist responses to the second question. \nTo be a rationalist is to adopt at least one of three claims. The\nIntuition/Deduction thesis concerns how we become warranted in\nbelieving propositions in a particular subject area. \nIntuition is a form of rational insight. Intellectually grasping a\nproposition, we just “see” it to be true in such a way as\nto form a true, warranted belief in it. (As discussed in Section 2\nbelow, the nature of this intellectual “seeing” needs\nexplanation.) Deduction is a process in which we derive conclusions\nfrom intuited premises through valid arguments, ones in which the\nconclusion must be true if the premises are true. We intuit, for\nexample, that the number three is prime and that it is greater than\ntwo. We then deduce from this knowledge that there is a prime number\ngreater than two. Intuition and deduction thus provide us with\nknowledge a priori, which is to say knowledge gained\nindependently of sense experience. \nWe can generate different versions of the Intuition/Deduction thesis\nby substituting different subject areas for the variable\n‘S’. Some rationalists take mathematics to be knowable by\nintuition and deduction. Some place ethical truths in this category.\nSome include metaphysical claims, such as that God exists, we have\nfree will, and our mind and body are distinct substances. The more\npropositions rationalists include within the range of intuition and\ndeduction, and the more controversial the truth of those propositions\nor the claims to know them, the more radical their rationalism. \nRationalists also vary the strength of their view by adjusting their\nunderstanding of warrant. Some take warranted beliefs to be beyond\neven the slightest doubt and claim that intuition and deduction\nprovide beliefs of this high epistemic status. Others interpret\nwarrant more conservatively, say as belief beyond a reasonable doubt,\nand claim that intuition and deduction provide beliefs of that\ncaliber. Still another dimension of rationalism depends on how its\nproponents understand the connection between intuition, on the one\nhand, and truth, on the other. Some take intuition to be infallible,\nclaiming that whatever we intuit must be true. Others allow for the\npossibility of false intuited propositions. \nThe second thesis associated with rationalism is the Innate Knowledge\nthesis. \nLike the Intuition/Deduction thesis, the Innate Knowledge thesis\nasserts the existence of knowledge gained a priori,\nindependently of experience. The difference between them rests in the\naccompanying understanding of how this a priori knowledge is\ngained. The Intuition/Deduction thesis cites intuition and subsequent\ndeductive reasoning. The Innate Knowledge thesis offers our rational\nnature. Our innate knowledge is not learned through either sense\nexperience or intuition and deduction. It is just part of our nature.\nExperiences may trigger a process by which we bring this knowledge to\nconsciousness, but the experiences do not provide us with the\nknowledge itself. It has in some way been with us all along. According\nto some rationalists, we gained the knowledge in an earlier existence.\nAccording to others, God provided us with it at creation. Still others\nsay it is part of our nature through natural selection. \nWe get different versions of the Innate Knowledge thesis by\nsubstituting different subject areas for the variable ‘S’.\nOnce again, the more subjects included within the range of the thesis\nor the more controversial the claim to have knowledge in them, the\nmore radical the form of rationalism. Stronger and weaker\nunderstandings of warrant yield stronger and weaker versions of the\nthesis as well. \nThe third important thesis of rationalism is the Innate Concept\nthesis. \nAccording to the Innate Concept thesis, some of our concepts are not\ngained from experience. They are part of our rational nature in such a\nway that, while sense experiences may trigger a process by which they\nare brought to consciousness, experience does not provide the concepts\nor determine the information they contain. Some claim that the Innate\nConcept thesis is entailed by the Innate Knowledge Thesis; a\nparticular instance of knowledge can only be innate if the concepts\nthat are contained in the known proposition are also innate. This is\nLocke’s position (1690, Book I, Chapter IV, Section 1, p. 91).\nOthers, such as Carruthers, argue against this connection (1992, pp.\n53–54). The content and strength of the Innate Concept thesis\nvaries with the concepts claimed to be innate. The more a concept\nseems removed from experience and the mental operations we can perform\non experience the more plausibly it may be claimed to be innate. Since\nwe do not experience perfect triangles but do experience pains, our\nconcept of the former is a more promising candidate for being innate\nthan our concept of the latter. \nThe Intuition/Deduction thesis, the Innate Knowledge thesis, and the\nInnate Concept thesis are essential to rationalism: to be a\nrationalist is to adopt at least one of them. Two other closely\nrelated theses are generally adopted by rationalists, although one can\ncertainly be a rationalist without adopting either of them. The first\nis that experience cannot provide what we gain from reason. \nThe second is that reason is superior to experience as a source of\nknowledge. \nHow reason is superior needs explanation, and rationalists have\noffered different accounts. One view, generally associated with\nDescartes (1628, Rules II and III, pp. 1–4), is that what we\nknow a priori is certain, beyond even the slightest doubt,\nwhile what we believe, or even know, on the basis of sense experience\nis at least somewhat uncertain. Another view, generally associated\nwith Plato (Republic 479e-484c), locates the superiority of\na priori knowledge in the objects known. What we know by\nreason alone, a Platonic form, say, is superior in an important\nmetaphysical way, e.g. unchanging, eternal, perfect, a higher degree\nof being, to what we are aware of through sense experience. \nMost forms of rationalism involve notable commitments to other\nphilosophical positions. One is a commitment to the denial of\nscepticism for at least some area of knowledge. If we claim to know\nsome truths by intuition or deduction or to have some innate\nknowledge, we obviously reject scepticism with regard to those truths.\nRationalism in the form of the Intuition/Deduction thesis is also\ncommitted to epistemic foundationalism, the view that we know some\ntruths without basing our belief in them on any others and that we\nthen use this foundational knowledge to know more truths. \nEmpiricists endorse the following claim for some subject area. \nEmpiricism about a particular subject rejects the corresponding\nversion of the Intuition/Deduction thesis and Innate Knowledge thesis.\nInsofar as we have knowledge in the subject, our knowledge is a\nposteriori, dependent upon sense experience. Empiricists also\ndeny the implication of the corresponding Innate Concept thesis that\nwe have innate ideas in the subject area. Sense experience is our only\nsource of ideas. They reject the corresponding version of the\nSuperiority of Reason thesis. Since reason alone does not give us any\nknowledge, it certainly does not give us superior knowledge.\nEmpiricists generally reject the Indispensability of Reason thesis,\nthough they need not. The Empiricism thesis does not entail that we\nhave empirical knowledge. It entails that knowledge can only be\ngained, if at all, by experience. Empiricists may assert, as\nsome do for some subjects, that the rationalists are correct to claim\nthat experience cannot give us knowledge. The conclusion they draw\nfrom this rationalist lesson is that we do not know at all. \nI have stated the basic claims of rationalism and empiricism so that\neach is relative to a particular subject area. Rationalism and\nempiricism, so relativized, need not conflict. We can be rationalists\nin mathematics or a particular area of mathematics and empiricists in\nall or some of the physical sciences. Rationalism and empiricism only\nconflict when formulated to cover the same subject. Then the debate,\nRationalism vs. Empiricism, is joined. The fact that philosophers can\nbe both rationalists and empiricists has implications for the\nclassification schemes often employed in the history of philosophy,\nespecially the one traditionally used to describe the Early Modern\nPeriod of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries leading up to Kant.\nIt is standard practice to group the major philosophers of this period\nas either rationalists or empiricists and to suggest that those under\none heading share a common agenda in opposition to those under the\nother. Thus, Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz are the Continental\nRationalists in opposition to Locke, Berkeley and Hume, the British\nEmpiricists. We should adopt such general classification schemes with\ncaution. The views of the individual philosophers are more subtle and\ncomplex than the simple-minded classification suggests. (See Loeb\n(1981) and Kenny (1986) for important discussions of this point.)\nLocke rejects rationalism in the form of any version of the Innate\nKnowledge or Innate Concept theses, but he nonetheless adopts the\nIntuition/Deduction thesis with regard to our knowledge of God’s\nexistence. Descartes and Locke have remarkably similar views on the\nnature of our ideas, even though Descartes takes many to be innate,\nwhile Locke ties them all to experience. The rationalist/empiricist\nclassification also encourages us to expect the philosophers on each\nside of the divide to have common research programs in areas beyond\nepistemology. Thus, Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz are mistakenly seen\nas applying a reason-centered epistemology to a common metaphysical\nagenda, with each trying to improve on the efforts of the one before,\nwhile Locke, Berkeley and Hume are mistakenly seen as gradually\nrejecting those metaphysical claims, with each consciously trying to\nimprove on the efforts of his predecessors. It is also important to\nnote that the rationalist/empiricist distinction is not exhaustive of\nthe possible sources of knowledge. One might claim, for example, that\nwe can gain knowledge in a particular area by a form of Divine\nrevelation or insight that is a product of neither reason nor sense\nexperience. In short, when used carelessly, the labels\n‘rationalist’ and ‘empiricist,’ as well as the\nslogan that is the title of this essay, ‘Rationalism vs.\nEmpiricism,’ can retard rather than advance our\nunderstanding. \nNonetheless, an important debate properly described as\n‘Rationalism vs. Empiricism’ is joined whenever the claims\nfor each view are formulated to cover the same subject. What is\nperhaps the most interesting form of the debate occurs when we take\nthe relevant subject to be truths about the external world, the world\nbeyond our own minds. A full-fledged rationalist with regard to our\nknowledge of the external world holds that some external world truths\ncan and must be known a priori, that some of the ideas\nrequired for that knowledge are and must be innate, and that this\nknowledge is superior to any that experience could ever provide. The\nfull-fledged empiricist about our knowledge of the external world\nreplies that, when it comes to the nature of the world beyond our own\nminds, experience is our sole source of information. Reason might\ninform us of the relations among our ideas, but those ideas themselves\ncan only be gained, and any truths about the external reality they\nrepresent can only be known, on the basis of sense experience. This\ndebate concerning our knowledge of the external world will generally\nbe our main focus in what follows. \nHistorically, the rationalist/empiricist dispute in epistemology has\nextended into the area of metaphysics, where philosophers are\nconcerned with the basic nature of reality, including the existence of\nGod and such aspects of our nature as freewill and the relation\nbetween the mind and body. Major rationalists (e.g., Descartes 1641)\nhave presented metaphysical theories, which they have claimed to know\nby reason alone. Major empiricists (e.g., Hume 1739–40) have\nrejected the theories as either speculation, beyond what we can learn\nfrom experience, or nonsensical attempts to describe aspects of the\nworld beyond the concepts experience can provide. The debate raises\nthe issue of metaphysics as an area of knowledge. Kant puts the\ndriving assumption clearly: \nThe possibility then of metaphysics so understood, as an area of human\nknowledge, hinges on how we resolve the rationalist/empiricist debate.\nThe debate also extends into ethics. Some moral objectivists (e.g.,\nRoss 1930 and Huemer 2005) take us to know some fundamental objective\nmoral truths by intuition, while some moral skeptics, who reject such\nknowledge, (e.g., Mackie 1977) find the appeal to a faculty of moral\nintuition utterly implausible. More recently, the\nrationalist/empiricist debate has extended to discussions (e.g.,\nBealer 1999 and Alexander & Weinberg 2007) of the very nature of\nphilosophical inquiry: to what extent are philosophical questions to\nbe answered by appeals to reason or experience? \nThe Intuition/Deduction thesis claims that we can know some\npropositions by intuition and still more by deduction. Many\nempiricists (e.g., Hume 1748) have been willing to accept the thesis\nso long as it is restricted to propositions solely about the relations\namong our own concepts. We can, they agree, know by intuition that our\nconcept of God includes our concept of omniscience. Just by examining\nthe concepts, we can intellectually grasp that the one includes the\nother. The debate between rationalists and empiricists is joined when\nthe former assert, and the latter deny, the Intuition/Deduction thesis\nwith regard to propositions that contain substantive information about\nthe external world. Rationalists, such as Descartes, have claimed that\nwe can know by intuition and deduction that God exists and created the\nworld, that our mind and body are distinct substances, and that the\nangles of a triangle equal two right angles, where all of these claims\nare truths about an external reality independent of our thought. Such\nsubstantive versions of the Intuition/Deduction thesis are our concern\nin this section. \nOne defense of the Intuition/Deduction thesis assumes that we know\nsome substantive external world truths, adds an analysis of what\nknowledge requires, and concludes that our knowledge must result from\nintuition and deduction. Descartes claims that knowledge requires\ncertainty and that certainty about the external world is beyond what\nempirical evidence can provide. We can never be sure our sensory\nimpressions are not part of a dream or a massive, demon orchestrated,\ndeception. Only intuition and deduction can provide the certainty\nneeded for knowledge, and, given that we have some substantive\nknowledge of the external world, the Intuition/Deduction thesis is\ntrue. As Descartes tells us, “all knowledge is certain and\nevident cognition” (1628, Rule II, p. 1) and when we\n“review all the actions of the intellect by means of which we\nare able to arrive at a knowledge of things with no fear of being\nmistaken,” we “recognize only two: intuition and\ndeduction” (1628, Rule III, p. 3). \nThis line of argument is one of the least compelling in the\nrationalist arsenal. First, the assumption that knowledge requires\ncertainty comes at a heavy cost, as it rules out so much of what we\ncommonly take ourselves to know. Second, as many contemporary\nrationalists accept, intuition is not always a source of certain\nknowledge. The possibility of a deceiver gives us a reason to doubt\nour intuitions as well as our empirical beliefs. For all we know, a\ndeceiver might cause us to intuit false propositions, just as one\nmight cause us to have perceptions of nonexistent objects.\nDescartes’s classic way of meeting this challenge in the\nMeditations is to argue that we can know with certainty that\nno such deceiver interferes with our intuitions and deductions. They\nare infallible, as God guarantees their truth. The problem, known as\nthe Cartesian Circle, is that Descartes’s account of how we gain\nthis knowledge begs the question, by attempting to deduce the\nconclusion that all our intuitions are true from intuited premises.\nMoreover, his account does not touch a remaining problem that he\nhimself notes (1628, Rule VII, p. 7): Deductions of any appreciable\nlength rely on our fallible memory. \nA more plausible argument for the Intuition/Deduction thesis again\nassumes that we know some particular, external world truths, and then\nappeals to the nature of what we know, rather than to the nature of\nknowledge itself, to argue that our knowledge must result from\nintuition and deduction. Leibniz (1704) tells us the following. \nLeibniz goes on to describe our mathematical knowledge as\n“innate,” and his argument may be directed to support the\nInnate Knowledge thesis rather than the Intuition/Deduction thesis.\nFor our purposes here, we can relate it to the latter, however: We\nhave substantive knowledge about the external world in mathematics,\nand what we know in that area, we know to be necessarily true.\nExperience cannot warrant beliefs about what is necessarily the case.\nHence, experience cannot be the source of our knowledge. The best\nexplanation of our knowledge is that we gain it by intuition and\ndeduction. Leibniz mentions logic, metaphysics and morals as other\nareas in which our knowledge similarly outstrips what experience can\nprovide. Judgments in logic and metaphysics involve forms of necessity\nbeyond what experience can support. Judgments in morals involve a form\nof obligation or value that lies beyond experience, which only informs\nus about what is the case rather than about what ought to be. \nThe strength of this argument varies with its examples of purported\nknowledge. Insofar as we focus on controversial claims in metaphysics,\ne.g., that God exists, that our mind is a distinct substance from our\nbody, the initial premise that we know the claims is less than\ncompelling. Taken with regard to other areas, however, the argument\nclearly has legs. We know a great deal of mathematics, and what we\nknow, we know to be necessarily true. None of our experiences warrants\na belief in such necessity, and we do not seem to base our knowledge\non any experiences. The warrant that provides us with knowledge arises\nfrom an intellectual grasp of the propositions which is clearly part\nof our learning. Similarly, we seem to have such moral knowledge as\nthat, all other things being equal, it is wrong to break a promise and\nthat pleasure is intrinsically good. No empirical lesson about how\nthings are can warrant such knowledge of how they ought to be. \nThis argument for the Intuition/Deduction thesis raises additional\nquestions which rationalists must answer. Insofar as they maintain\nthat our knowledge of necessary truths in mathematics or elsewhere by\nintuition and deduction is substantive knowledge of the external\nworld, they owe us an account of this form of necessity. Many\nempiricists stand ready to argue that “necessity resides in the\nway we talk about things, not in the things we talk about”\n(Quine 1966, p. 174). Similarly, if rationalists claim that our\nknowledge in morals is knowledge of an objective form of obligation,\nthey owe us an account of how objective values are part of a world of\napparently valueless facts. \nPerhaps most of all, rationalist defenders of the Intuition/Deduction\nthesis owe us an account of what intuition is and how it provides\nwarranted true beliefs about the external world. What is it to intuit\na proposition and how does that act of intuition support a warranted\nbelief? Their argument presents intuition and deduction as an\nexplanation of assumed knowledge that can’t—they\nsay—be explained by experience, but such an explanation by\nintuition and deduction requires that we have a clear understanding of\nintuition and how it supports warranted beliefs. Metaphorical\ncharacterizations of intuition as intellectual “grasping”\nor “seeing” are not enough, and if intuition is some form\nof intellectual “grasping,” it appears that all that is\ngrasped is relations among our concepts, rather than facts about the\nexternal world. One current approach to the issue involves an appeal\nto Phenomenal Conservatism (Huemer 2001), the principle that if it\nseems to one as if something is the case, then one is prima facie\njustified in believing that it is so. Intuitions are then taken to be\na particular sort of seeming or appearance: “[A]n intuition that\np is a state of its seeming to one that p that is not dependent on\ninference from other beliefs and that results from thinking about p,\nas opposed to perceiving, remembering, or introspecting” (Hummer\n2005, p. 102). Just as it can visually seem or appear to one as if\nthere’s a tree outside the window, it can intellectually seem or\nappear to one as if nothing can be both entirely red and entirely\ngreen. This approach aims to demystify intuitions; they are but one\nmore form of seeming-state along with ones we gain from sense\nperception, memory and introspection. It does not, however, tell us\nall we need to know. Any intellectual faculty, whether it be sense\nperception, memory, introspection or intuition, provides us with\nwarranted beliefs only if it is generally reliable. The reliability of\nsense perception stems from the causal connection between how external\nobjects are and how we experience them. What accounts for the\nreliability of our intuitions regarding the external world? Is our\nintuition of a particular true proposition the outcome of some causal\ninteraction between ourselves and some aspect of the world? What\naspect? What is the nature of this causal interaction? That the number\nthree is prime does not appear to cause anything, let alone our\nintuition that it is prime. As Michael Huemer (2005, p. 123) points\nout in mounting his own defense of moral intuitionism, “The\nchallenge for the moral realist, then, is to explain how it would be\nanything more than chance if my moral beliefs were true, given that I\ndo not interact with moral properties.” \nThese issues are made all the more pressing by the classic empiricist\nresponse to the argument. The reply is generally credited to Hume and\nbegins with a division of all true propositions into two\ncategories. \nIntuition and deduction can provide us with knowledge of necessary\ntruths such as those found in mathematics and logic, but such\nknowledge is not substantive knowledge of the external world. It is\nonly knowledge of the relations of our own ideas. If the rationalist\nshifts the argument so it appeals to knowledge in morals, Hume’s\nreply is to offer an analysis of our moral concepts by which such\nknowledge is empirically gained knowledge of matters of fact. \nIf the rationalist appeals to our knowledge in metaphysics to support\nthe argument, Hume denies that we have such knowledge. \nAn updated version of this general empiricist reply, with an increased\nemphasis on language and the nature of meaning, is given in the\ntwentieth-century by A. J. Ayer’s version of logical positivism.\nAdopting positivism’s verification theory of meaning, Ayer\nassigns every cognitively meaningful sentence to one of two\ncategories: either it is a tautology, and so true solely by virtue of\nthe meaning of its terms and provides no substantive information about\nthe world, or it is open to empirical verification. There is, then, no\nroom for knowledge about the external world by intuition or\ndeduction. \nThe rationalists’ argument for the Intuition/Deduction thesis\ngoes wrong at the start, according to empiricists, by assuming that we\ncan have substantive knowledge of the external world that outstrips\nwhat experience can warrant. We cannot. \nThis empiricist reply faces challenges of its own. Our knowledge of\nmathematics seems to be about something more than our own concepts.\nOur knowledge of moral judgments seems to concern not just how we feel\nor act but how we ought to behave. The general principles that provide\na basis for the empiricist view, e.g. Hume’s overall account of\nour ideas, the Verification Principle of Meaning, are problematic in\ntheir own right. In various formulations, the Verification Principle\nfails its own test for having cognitive meaning. A careful analysis of\nHume’s Inquiry, relative to its own principles, may\nrequire us to consign large sections of it to the flames. \nIn all, rationalists have a strong argument for the\nIntuition/Deduction thesis relative to our substantive knowledge of\nthe external world, but its success rests on how well they can answer\nquestions about the nature and epistemic force of intuition made all\nthe more pressing by the classic empiricist reply. \nThe Innate Knowledge thesis joins the Intuition/Deduction thesis in\nasserting that we have a priori knowledge, but it does not\noffer intuition and deduction as the source of that knowledge. It\ntakes our a priori knowledge to be part of our rational\nnature. Experience may trigger our awareness of this knowledge, but it\ndoes not provide us with it. The knowledge is already there. \nPlato presents an early version of the Innate Knowledge thesis in the\nMeno as the doctrine of knowledge by recollection. The\ndoctrine is motivated in part by a paradox that arises when we attempt\nto explain the nature of inquiry. How do we gain knowledge of a\ntheorem in geometry? We inquire into the matter. Yet, knowledge by\ninquiry seems impossible (Meno, 80d-e). We either already\nknow the theorem at the start of our investigation or we do not. If we\nalready have the knowledge, there is no place for inquiry. If we lack\nthe knowledge, we don’t know what we are seeking and cannot\nrecognize it when we find it. Either way we cannot gain knowledge of\nthe theorem by inquiry. Yet, we do know some theorems. \nThe doctrine of knowledge by recollection offers a solution. When we\ninquire into the truth of a theorem, we both do and do not already\nknow it. We have knowledge in the form of a memory gained from our\nsoul’s knowledge of the theorem prior to its union with our\nbody. We lack knowledge in that, in our soul’s unification with\nthe body, it has forgotten the knowledge and now needs to recollect\nit. In learning the theorem, we are, in effect, recalling what we\nalready know. \nPlato famously illustrates the doctrine with an exchange between\nSocrates and a young slave, in which Socrates guides the slave from\nignorance to mathematical knowledge. The slave’s experiences, in\nthe form of Socrates’ questions and illustrations, are the\noccasion for his recollection of what he learned previously.\nPlato’s metaphysics provides additional support for the Innate\nKnowledge Thesis. Since our knowledge is of abstract, eternal Forms\nwhich clearly lie beyond our sensory experience, it is a\npriori. \nContemporary supporters of Plato’s position are scarce. The\ninitial paradox, which Plato describes as a “trick\nargument” (Meno, 80e), rings sophistical. The\nmetaphysical assumptions in the solution need justification. The\nsolution does not answer the basic question: Just how did the\nslave’s soul learn the theorem? The Intuition/Deduction thesis\noffers an equally, if not more, plausible account of how the slave\ngains knowledge a priori. Nonetheless, Plato’s position\nillustrates the kind of reasoning that has caused many philosophers to\nadopt some form of the Innate Knowledge thesis. We are confident that\nwe know certain propositions about the external world, but there seems\nto be no adequate explanation of how we gained this knowledge short of\nsaying that it is innate. Its content is beyond what we directly gain\nin experience, as well as what we can gain by performing mental\noperations on what experience provides. It does not seem to be based\non an intuition or deduction. That it is innate in us appears to be\nthe best explanation. \nNoam Chomsky argues along similar lines in presenting what he\ndescribes as a “rationalist conception of the nature of\nlanguage” (1975, p. 129). Chomsky argues that the experiences\navailable to language learners are far too sparse to account for their\nknowledge of their language. To explain language acquisition, we must\nassume that learners have an innate knowledge of a universal grammar\ncapturing the common deep structure of natural languages. It is\nimportant to note that Chomsky’s language learners do not know\nparticular propositions describing a universal grammar. They have a\nset of innate capacities or dispositions which enable and determine\ntheir language development. Chomsky gives us a theory of innate\nlearning capacities or structures rather than a theory of innate\nknowledge. His view does not support the Innate Knowledge thesis as\nrationalists have traditionally understood it. As one commentator puts\nit, “Chomsky’s principles … are innate neither in\nthe sense that we are explicitly aware of them, nor in the sense that\nwe have a disposition to recognize their truth as obvious under\nappropriate circumstances. And hence it is by no means clear that\nChomsky is correct in seeing his theory as following the traditional\nrationalist account of the acquisition of knowledge” (Cottingham\n1984, p. 124). \nPeter Carruthers (1992) argues that we have innate knowledge of the\nprinciples of folk-psychology. Folk-psychology is a network of\ncommon-sense generalizations that hold independently of context or\nculture and concern the relationships of mental states to one another,\nto the environment and states of the body and to behavior (1992, p.\n115). It includes such beliefs as that pains tend to be caused by\ninjury, that pains tend to prevent us from concentrating on tasks, and\nthat perceptions are generally caused by the appropriate state of the\nenvironment. Carruthers notes the complexity of folk-psychology, along\nwith its success in explaining our behavior and the fact that its\nexplanations appeal to such unobservables as beliefs, desires,\nfeelings and thoughts. He argues that the complexity, universality and\ndepth of folk-psychological principles outstrips what experience can\nprovide, especially to young children who by their fifth year already\nknow a great many of them. This knowledge is also not the result of\nintuition or deduction; folk-psychological generalizations are not\nseen to be true in an act of intellectual insight. Carruthers\nconcludes, “[The problem] concerning the child’s\nacquisition of psychological generalizations cannot be solved, unless\nwe suppose that much of folk-psychology is already innate, triggered\nlocally by the child’s experience of itself and others, rather\nthan learned” (1992, p. 121). \nEmpiricists, and some rationalists, attack the Innate Knowledge thesis\nin two main ways. First, they offer accounts of how sense experience\nor intuition and deduction provide the knowledge that is claimed to be\ninnate. Second, they directly criticize the Innate Knowledge thesis\nitself. The classic statement of this second line of attack is\npresented in Locke 1690. Locke raises the issue of just what innate\nknowledge is. Particular instances of knowledge are supposed to be in\nour minds as part of our rational make-up, but how are they “in\nour minds”? If the implication is that we all consciously have\nthis knowledge, it is plainly false. Propositions often given as\nexamples of innate knowledge, even such plausible candidates as the\nprinciple that the same thing cannot both be and not be, are not\nconsciously accepted by children and those with severe cognitive\nlimitations. If the point of calling such principles\n“innate” is not to imply that they are or have been\nconsciously accepted by all rational beings, then it is hard to see\nwhat the point is. “No proposition can be said to be in the\nmind, which it never yet knew, which it never yet was conscious\nof” (1690, Book I, Chapter II, Section 5, p. 61). Proponents of\ninnate knowledge might respond that some knowledge is innate in that\nwe have the capacity to have it. That claim, while true, is of little\ninterest, however. “If the capacity of knowing, be the natural\nimpression contended for, all the truths a man ever comes to know,\nwill, by this account, be every one of them, innate; and this great\npoint will amount to no more, but only an improper way of speaking;\nwhich whilst it pretends to assert the contrary, says nothing\ndifferent from those, who deny innate principles. For nobody, I think,\never denied, that the mind was capable of knowing several\ntruths” (1690, Book I, Chapter II, Section 5, p. 61). Locke thus\nchallenges defenders of the Innate Knowledge thesis to present an\naccount of innate knowledge that allows their position to be both true\nand interesting. A narrow interpretation of innateness faces\ncounterexamples of rational individuals who do not meet its\nconditions. A generous interpretation implies that all our knowledge,\neven that clearly provided by experience, is innate. \nDefenders of innate knowledge take up Locke’s challenge. Leibniz\nresponds (1704) by appealing to an account of innateness in terms of\nnatural potential to avoid Locke’s dilemma. Consider Peter\nCarruthers’ similar reply. \nCarruthers claims that our innate knowledge is determined through\nevolutionary selection (p. 111). Evolution has resulted in our being\ndetermined to know certain things (e.g. principles of folk-psychology)\nat particular stages of our life, as part of our natural development.\nExperiences provide the occasion for our consciously believing the\nknown propositions but not the basis for our knowledge of them (p.\n52). Carruthers thus has a ready reply to Locke’s\ncounterexamples of children and cognitively limited persons who do not\nbelieve propositions claimed to be instances of innate knowledge. The\nformer have not yet reached the proper stage of development; the\nlatter are persons in whom natural development has broken down (pp.\n49–50). \nA serious problem for the Innate Knowledge thesis remains, however. We\nknow a proposition only if it is true, we believe it and our belief is\nwarranted. Rationalists who assert the existence of innate knowledge\nare not just claiming that, as a matter of human evolution,\nGod’s design or some other factor, at a particular point in our\ndevelopment, certain sorts of experiences trigger our belief in\nparticular propositions in a way that does not involve our learning\nthem from the experiences. Their claim is even bolder: In at least\nsome of these cases, our empirically triggered, but not empirically\nwarranted, belief is nonetheless warranted and so known. How can these\nbeliefs be warranted if they do not gain their warrant from the\nexperiences that cause us to have them or from intuition and\ndeduction? \nSome rationalists think that a reliabilist account of warrant provides\nthe answer. According to Reliabilism, beliefs are warranted if they\nare formed by a process that generally produces true beliefs rather\nthan false ones. The true beliefs that constitute our innate knowledge\nare warranted, then, because they are formed as the result of a\nreliable belief-forming process. Carruthers maintains that\n“Innate beliefs will count as known provided that the process\nthrough which they come to be innate is a reliable one (provided, that\nis, that the process tends to generate beliefs that are true)”\n(1992, p. 77). He argues that natural selection results in the\nformation of some beliefs and is a truth-reliable process. \nAn appeal to Reliabilism, or a similar causal theory of warrant, may\nwell be the best way for rationalists to develop the Innate Knowledge\nthesis. They have a difficult row to hoe, however. First, such\naccounts of warrant are themselves quite controversial. Second,\nrationalists must give an account of innate knowledge that maintains\nand explains the distinction between innate knowledge and a\nposteriori knowledge, and it is not clear that they will be able\nto do so within such an account of warrant. Suppose for the sake of\nargument that we have innate knowledge of some proposition, P.\nWhat makes our knowledge that P innate? To sharpen the\nquestion, what difference between our knowledge that P and a\nclear case of a posteriori knowledge, say our knowledge that\nsomething is red based on our current visual experience of a red\ntable, makes the former innate and the latter not innate? In each\ncase, we have a true, warranted belief. In each case, presumably, our\nbelief gains its warrant from the fact that it meets a particular\ncausal condition, e.g., it is produced by a reliable process. In each\ncase, the causal process is one in which an experience causes us to\nbelieve the proposition at hand (that P; that something is\nred), for, as defenders of innate knowledge admit, our belief that\nP is “triggered” by an experience, as is our belief\nthat something is red. The insight behind the Innate Knowledge thesis\nseems to be that the difference between our innate and a\nposteriori knowledge lies in the relation between our experience\nand our belief in each case. The experience that causes our belief\nthat P does not “contain” the information that\nP, while our visual experience of a red table does\n“contain” the information that something is red. Yet,\nexactly what is the nature of this containment relation between our\nexperiences, on the one hand, and what we believe, on the other, that\nis missing in the one case but present in the other? The nature of the\nexperience-belief relation seems quite similar in each. The causal\nrelation between the experience that triggers our belief that P\nand our belief that P is contingent, as is the fact that the\nbelief-forming process is reliable. The same is true of our experience\nof a red table and our belief that something is red. The causal\nrelation between the experience and our belief is again contingent. We\nmight have been so constructed that the experience we describe as\n“being appeared to redly” caused us to believe, not that\nsomething is red, but that something is hot. The process that takes us\nfrom the experince to our belief is also only contingently reliable.\nMoreover, if our experience of a red table “contains” the\ninformation that something is red, then that fact, not the existence\nof a reliable belief-forming process between the two, should be the\nreason why the experience warrants our belief. By appealing to\nReliablism, or some other causal theory of warrant, rationalists may\nobtain a way to explain how innate knowledge can be warranted. They\nstill need to show how their explanation supports an account of the\ndifference between innate knowledge and a posteriori\nknowledge. \nAccording to the Innate Concept thesis, some of our concepts have not\nbeen gained from experience. They are instead part of our rational\nmake-up, and experience simply triggers a process by which we\nconsciously grasp them. The main concern motivating the rationalist\nshould be familiar by now: the content of some concepts seems to\noutstrip anything we could have gained from experience. An example of\nthis reasoning is presented by Descartes in the Meditations.\nAlthough he sometimes seems committed to the view that all our ideas\nare innate (Adams 1975 and Gotham 2002), he there classifies our ideas\nas adventitious, invented by us, and innate. Adventitious ideas, such\nas a sensation of heat, are gained directly through sense experience.\nIdeas invented by us, such as our idea of a hippogriff, are created by\nus from other ideas we possess. Innate ideas, such as our ideas of\nGod, of extended matter, of substance and of a perfect triangle, are\nplaced in our minds by God at creation. Consider Descartes’s\nargument that our concept of God, as an infinitely perfect being, is\ninnate. Our concept of God is not directly gained in experience, as\nparticular tastes, sensations and mental images might be. Its content\nis beyond what we could ever construct by applying available mental\noperations to what experience directly provides. From experience, we\ncan gain the concept of a being with finite amounts of various\nperfections, one, for example, that is finitely knowledgeable,\npowerful and good. We cannot however move from these empirical\nconcepts to the concept of a being of infinite perfection. (“I\nmust not think that, just as my conceptions of rest and darkness are\narrived at by negating movement and light, so my perception of the\ninfinite is arrived at not by means of a true idea but by merely\nnegating the finite,” Third Meditation, p. 94.) Descartes\nsupplements this argument by another. Not only is the content of our\nconcept of God beyond what experience can provide, the concept is a\nprerequisite for our employment of the concept of finite perfection\ngained from experience. (“My perception of the infinite, that is\nGod, is in some way prior to my perception of the finite, that is\nmyself. For how could I understand that I doubted or\ndesired—that is lacked something—and that I was not wholly\nperfect, unless there were in me some idea of a more perfect being\nwhich enabled me to recognize my own defects by comparison,”\nThird Meditation, p. 94). \nAn empiricist response to this general line of argument is given by\nLocke (1690, Book I, Chapter IV, Sections 1–25, pp.\n91–107). First, there is the problem of explaining what it is\nfor someone to have an innate concept. If having an innate concept\nentails consciously entertaining it at present or in the past, then\nDescartes’s position is open to obvious counterexamples. Young\nchildren and people from other cultures do not consciously entertain\nthe concept of God and have not done so. Second, there is the\nobjection that we have no need to appeal to innate concepts in the\nfirst place. Contrary to Descartes’ argument, we can explain how\nexperience provides all our ideas, including those the rationalists\ntake to be innate, and with just the content that the rationalists\nattribute to them. \nLeibniz (1704) offers a rationalist reply to the first concern. Where\nLocke puts forth the image of the mind as a blank tablet on which\nexperience writes, Leibniz offers us the image of a block of marble,\nthe veins of which determine what sculpted figures it will accept. \nLeibniz’s metaphor contains an insight that Locke misses. The\nmind plays a role in determining the nature of its contents. This\npoint does not, however, require the adoption of the Innate Concept\nthesis. \nRationalists have responded to the second part of the empiricist\nattack on the Innate Concept thesis—the empricists’ claim\nthat the thesis is without basis, as all our ideas can be explained as\nderived from experience—by focusing on difficulties in the\nempiricists’ attempts to give such an explanation. The\ndifficulties are illustrated by Locke’s account. According to\nLocke, experience consists in external sensation and inner reflection.\nAll our ideas are either simple or complex, with the former being\nreceived by us passively in sensation or reflection and the latter\nbeing built by the mind from simple materials through various mental\noperations. Right at the start, the account of how simple ideas are\ngained is open to an obvious counterexample acknowledged, but then set\naside, by Hume in presenting his own empiricist theory. Consider the\nmental image of a particular shade of blue. If Locke is right, the\nidea is a simple one and should be passively received by the mind\nthrough experience. Hume points out otherwise. \nEven when it comes to such simple ideas as the image of a particular\nshade of blue, the mind is more than a blank slate on which experience\nwrites. \nConsider too our concept of a particular color, say red. Critics of\nLocke’s account have pointed out the weaknesses in his\nexplanation of how we gain such a concept by the mental operation of\nabstraction on individual cases. For one thing, it makes the incorrect\nassumption that various instances of a particular concept share a\ncommon feature. Carruthers puts the objection as follows. \nFor another thing, Locke’s account of concept acquisition from\nparticular experiences seems circular. \nConsider in this regard Locke’s account of how we gain our\nconcept of causation. \nWe get our concept of causation from our observation that some things\nreceive their existence from the application and operation of some\nother things. Yet, we cannot make this observation unless we already\nhave the concept of causation. Locke’s account of how we gain\nour idea of power displays a similar circularity. \nWe come by the idea of power though considering the possibility of\nchanges in our ideas made by experiences and our own choices. Yet, to\nconsider this possibility—of some things making a\nchange in others—we must already have a concept of power. \nOne way to meet at least some of these challenges to an empiricist\naccount of the origin of our concepts is to revise our understanding\nof the content of our concepts so as to bring them more in line with\nwhat experience will clearly provide. Hume famously takes this\napproach. Beginning in a way reminiscent of Locke, he distinguishes\nbetween two forms of mental contents or “perceptions,” as\nhe calls them: impressions and ideas. Impressions are the contents of\nour current experiences: our sensations, feelings, emotions, desires,\nand so on. Ideas are mental contents derived from impressions. Simple\nideas are copies of impressions; complex ideas are derived from\nimpressions by “compounding, transposing, augmenting or\ndiminishing” them. Given that all our ideas are thus gained from\nexperience, Hume offers us the following method for determining the\ncontent of any idea and thereby the meaning of any term taken to\nexpress it. \nUsing this test, Hume draws out one of the most important implications\nof the empiricists’ denial of the Innate Concept thesis. If\nexperience is indeed the source of all ideas, then our experiences\nalso determine the content of our ideas. Our ideas of causation, of\nsubstance, of right and wrong have their content determined by the\nexperiences that provide them. Those experiences, Hume argues, are\nunable to support the content that many rationalists and some\nempiricists, such as Locke, attribute to the corresponding ideas. Our\ninability to explain how some concepts, with the contents the\nrationalists attribute to them, are gained from experience should not\nlead us to adopt the Innate Concept thesis. It should lead us to\naccept a more limited view of the contents for those concepts, and\nthereby a more limited view of our ability to describe and understand\nthe world. \nConsider, for example, our idea of causation. Descartes takes it to be\ninnate. Locke offers an apparently circular account of how it is\ngained from experience. Hume’s empiricist account severely\nlimits its content. Our idea of causation is derived from a feeling of\nexpectation rooted in our experiences of the constant conjunction of\nsimilar causes and effects. \nThe source of our idea in experience determines its content. \nOur claims, and any knowledge we may have, about causal connections in\nthe world turn out, given the limited content of our empirically based\nconcept of causation, to be claims and knowledge about the constant\nconjunction of events and our own feelings of expectation. Thus, the\ninitial disagreement between rationalists and empiricists about the\nsource of our ideas leads to one about their content and thereby the\ncontent of our descriptions and knowledge of the world. \nLike philosophical debates generally, the rationalist/empiricist\ndebate ultimately concerns our position in the world, in this case our\nposition as rational inquirers. To what extent do our faculties of\nreason and experience support our attempts to know and understand our\nsituation?","contact.mail":"MarkieP@missouri.edu","contact.domain":"missouri.edu"}]
