Known primarily for his\ncommentaries on Aristotle, which were said to be of greater benefit\nthan anyone else’s, he was also distinguished in geometry and\nastronomy. Himself a pupil of Proclus at Athens, at Alexandria\nAmmonius taught most of the important Platonists of the late\n5th and early 6th centuries: Asclepius,\nDamascius and Simplicius, Eutocius, and Olympiodorus; Elias and David\nare considered indirect pupils of his. Damascius, who went on to head\nthe school at Athens, heard Ammonius lecture, but attached himself\nrather to the mentorship of Isidore and followed him to Athens. While\nalmost all of Ammonius’ Aristotle commentaries were published by\nstudents from his lectures, the large commentary on De\nInterpretatione was written up by Ammonius himself for\npublication. These commentaries are largely dependent on the lectures\nof Proclus and, to a lesser extent, Syrianus and thus indebted to\ntheir style of Iamblichean Neoplatonism. Ammonius is known for several\ncontributions, especially for the introduction of an Alexandrian\ntradition of commentary on Aristotle, but also for the first preserved\nversion of the set of questions to be answered preliminary to the\nstudy of Aristotle, the thesis that for Aristotle God is the efficient\nas well as final cause of the world, and the treatment of the sea\nbattle of De Interpretatione 9 as one of three determinist\narguments, along with the ‘Reaper’ and the argument from\ndivine foreknowledge.\n\nAmmonius’ father Hermeias, after studying in Athens under\nSyrianus (Head of School in Athens 431/2–437), returned to Alexandria,\nwhere he established the teaching of Platonism as an additional\nsubject in the school of Horapollo (see below), alongside the\nprincipal curriculum in rhetoric. Ammonius’ mother Aedesia had\nbeen chosen as a young girl by Syrianus, a relative of hers, to marry\nProclus, who would succeed their teacher Syrianus as head on the\nlatter’s death in 437. When Proclus was kept from marrying her\nby ‘some god’, Aedesia was then married to Proclus’\nfellow student Hermeias. From these details, it is clear that\nAmmonius, second of three sons of Hermeias and Aedesia (the eldest died in childhood), must have been born\nafter about 435, presumably not long before 445. He seems to have been\ndead when Damascius (ca. 460-after 532) was writing his Life of\nIsidore or Philosophical History in 526, but alive in\n517, when his course on Aristotle’s Physics was first\npublished by Philoponus. \nDamascius, whose Life of Isidore is the source of most\ndetails about Ammonius’ life, greatly admired Aedesia for her\npiety and charity, and while still a young student of rhetoric he gave\nher eulogy at Horapollo’s school. Although the municipal stipend\nwhich had been paid to Hermeias (presumably as a teacher) continued to\nbe given her after Hermeias’ death, from the time Ammonius and\nhis younger brother Heliodorus were small until their maturity,\nDamascius says that Aedesia’s charitable giving left her sons in\ndebt on her death in old age (ca. 475, since Damascius, still a boy\nand a student of rhetoric, was honored to give her eulogy, ornamented\nwith heroic hexameters). These financial straits may have something to\ndo with Damascius’ opinion that Ammonius was viciously greedy:\nwith this debt, he would certainly have striven to keep teaching and\ncollecting salary and fees; however, the preserved excerpts of\nDamascius do not make this connection, perhaps in order to portray\nAmmonius as simply greedy (see below, on Ammonius’ alleged\n‘deal’ with the Christian Bishop of Alexandria). For\nDamascius the true offspring of this union of this exceptionally moral\nand holy couple was Aedesia and Hermeias’ eldest child, blessed\nwith divine gifts, who died at age seven and receives a rather\nhagiographic description. Aedesia accompanied her two surviving sons\nto Athens, where, at her suggestion, both studied with Proclus. \nAedesia and her sons must have returned before 475 from their study in\nAthens under Proclus to Alexandria, where Ammonius began lecturing on\nphilosophy at the school of Horapollon. We have reports of lectures on\nPlato by Ammonius from the beginning and end of his career. Sometime\nbetween 475 and 485 Damascius, who studied under Ammonius and his\nbrother Heliodorus, heard Ammonius lecture on Platonic philosophy;\nabout 515 Olympiodorus heard him lecture on the Gorgias\n(Olympiodorus, in Gorg. 199,8–10). Asclepius mentions\nlectures (or seminars: sunousiai, in Met. 77,4) on\nPlato and refers to an ‘exegesis’ (in Met. 70,31)\nof the Theaetetus. Nonetheless, Damascius reports that\nAmmonius was better versed in Aristotle, and it is his lectures on\nAristotle which, for the most part, have been transmitted to us. \nIn Ammonius’ day, Alexandria, unlike Athens, was an important\ncenter of Christian cult and culture, the third See of Christendom.\nThe school founded by Horapollo, where after Hermeias joined it the\ntwo main courses of study were rhetoric and philosophy, was a hub of\nthe ‘Hellenic’ pagan learning, religion and culture.\nApparently, Christian professors taught there as well, however, though\nthe latter tended to lecture in their homes on Fridays, leaving the\nschool largely to the pagans on that day (Zacharias, Life of\nSeverus p. 23 Kugener); certainly, there were Christian students\nin the classes of both their co-religionists and the Hellenes. The\natmosphere in Ammonius’ classroom is (too?) vividly portrayed in\nAmmonius or On the Creation of the World, written by one such\nChristian student, Zacharias of Maiuma (Gaza’s port-city), the\nlater Bishop of Mytilene, who studied with Ammonius in Alexandria\nbetween 485 and 487. Zacharias’ book recounts discussions\nbetween ‘The Christian’, presumably Zacharias himself, and\n‘Ammonius’ in front of the classroom; there is also\n(perhaps added later, after Ammonius’ death: Watts 2005) a\ndiscussion with the medical philosopher (iatrosophistēs)\nGesius, said to have been Ammonius’ best student at the time.\nThis recounting of the ‘dialogues in the Platonic manner’\n(1. 7–8) should not be taken as historical: it is embellished by\nZacharias with various references to Platonic dialogues and their digs\nat sophists; the arguments themselves largely depend upon another\ncontemporary work, the Theophrastus by Aeneas of Gaza, which\nhas no express connection with Ammonius. But Zacharias portrays\nAmmonius’ classroom as a battle over the souls of a mixture of\ncommitted pagans and Christians, and some students leaning one way or\nthe other. Zacharias’ contempt for Ammonius and for Platonic\nphilosophy is evident, and their discussion ends with Ammonius’\nembarrassed silence. That the school could be a focus of hostile\nChristian attention had been made abundantly clear by the lynching of\nHypatia at the hands of an Alexandrian mob in 415. Questions thus\narise about the relation of the school to what Damascius in his\nLife of Isidore calls ‘the dominant doctrine’.\nHow did the school manage to keep going as a largely pagan institution\nin a strongly Christian city? Did the philosophers in the school make\nany concessions, doctrinal or otherwise, to the Christian authorities?\nWas the school enabled to continue teaching Platonic philosophy with\nsome pagan professors into the 530’s by a concession of\nAmmonius’ to the Christian authorities? \nIt has been speculated that Ammonius may actually have converted to\nChristianity. A remark in Philoponus’ edition of Ammonius’\nlectures on De Anima (104,21–23) to the effect that the\nsoul could be forced to profess tyrants’ impious dogma, but\ncould not be forced to assent to it and believe it, might perhaps go\nback to Ammonius and has been taken as possible evidence that he was\ncoerced to pay lip service to Christianity, as has the dialectically\ncoerced admission (2.1094–1121) of Zacharias’ character\n‘Ammonius’ that the Trinity really is\n“three in hypostasis and being, but one in number”\n(Westerink 1962, XI–XII and Cameron 1969,14–15). But there\nis no convincing evidence of a conversion (cf. Blumenthal 1986,\n322–323), nor of any change in the real Ammonius’\nteaching.  \nAmmonius’ tenure at the school saw a large-scale attack on the\npagan community of Alexandria in the wake of the revolt of Illus\n(484–488) against the Emperor Zeno, during which harsh measures\nwere taken against the pagans by the Patriarch Peter III Mongus\n(482–489), since Illus had allied himself with the corrupt pagan\nPamprepius and may have promised him that pagan practice would be\ntolerated. It was probably during this crisis that Ammonius is\nrepresented by Damascius as making an agreement or deal:\n“Ammonius, who was wickedly greedy and saw everything in terms\nof any profit he could make, concluded an agreement\n(sunthēkas) with the overseer (episkopounta,\ni.e., bishop) of the dominant doctrine” (Photius, Bibl.\ncod. 242.352a 11–14=Damascius 118B Athanassiadi; cf. her Intro.\n30–1 and n. 37). Scholarly attention has focused on the nature\nof Ammonius’ ‘deal’ with the Bishop (presumed, by\nconnecting this persecution with the end of Illus’ revolt, to\nhave been Peter Mongus; the appearance of the name of his successor,\nAthanasius II [490–497] in a doublet of the same passage from\nDamascius [Photius, Bibl. cod. 242.347a 20] is apparently an\nintrusive, mistaken gloss). The suggestions have been put forward that\nhe agreed to continue the alleged Alexandrian Neoplatonic practice of\nmaking the gods into one by collapsing the One into the Intellect (a\nview congenial to Christianity); or that he agreed to lecture only on\nAristotle, avoiding Plato, or not to mention in his teaching the\nAristotelian doctrine of the eternity and divinity of the world; or\nthat he betrayed the hiding places of colleagues and pupils. Scholars\nhave adduced counterevidence against the first three suggestions,\nconcerning the school’s doctrine. That Ammonius betrayed his\nfellow Hellenes is a speculation based on his ability—alone\namong the major figures of the school—to resume his teaching\nunscathed after the turmoil of 489, on Damascius’ association of\nAmmonius’ deal with a profit motive, and also on\nDamascius’ hints that Ammonius was unprincipled and given to\nintrigue, as evidenced by an earlier power-struggle against Erythrius\n(a three-time praetorian prefect) in Constantinople (Damascius 78E;\nAthanassiadi 1999, 30–2). Indeed, the excerpts from Damascius\nseem to indicate that Ammonius was a prime target of the investigation\nand persecution led by the imperial envoy Nicomedes, who in an attempt\nto get information on “the Ammonius affair” (Damascius\n117A) ordered the arrest of Ammonius’ friend Harpocras, a\nprofessor of literature; he fled, but the order led to the arrest and\ntorture of Horapollo and Heraïscus, whom they tried to make\ninform on Harpocras and Isidore (Damascius 117B). Thus, Damascius\nperhaps implies that Ammonius set the investigators on Harpocras to\ndraw them away from himself.  \nRichard Sorabji (1990b, 12; see also 2005; 2016b, xiii–xiv;\n2016c, 46–47) suggested that Ammonius might have agreed not to\nallow the school to be a center of pagan and theurgic ritual, which he\nwould also de-emphasize in his teaching, or simply not to make trouble\nwith Christians, as the practice of theurgy or any attempt to convert\nChristian students to it would do. On Sorabji’s thesis, instead\nof agreeing with Iamblichus’ insistence on theurgy as\nindispensable to reaching spiritual union with God, a doctrine largely\ntaken over by Proclus (on Proclus’ theurgy and its three types,\nsee Sheppard 1982), Ammonius sided\nwith Porphyry’s refusal to accept the efficacy of theurgy in\npurifying the intellect and hence leading us to God. This\ninterpretation puts Ammonius in an altogether better light than does\nDamascius’, which is approved by Athanassiadi. For Sorabji his\nfinancial gain was the continuation of his municipal salary, so that\nhe could keep his school open, rather than a craven payment for\nservices rendered to the Christian authorities; he did not betray his\nfriends; he did not betray philosophy, since he merely preferred the\nnoncommittal attitude of Porphyry in the matter of divine names and\ntheurgy to that of Iamblichus and Proclus; on the contrary, he saved\nphilosophy in Alexandria. \nSorabji’s conjecture has attained something like a consensus\namong scholars (e.g., Hadot 2015, 29) and is quite possibly correct.\nThere is still room for doubt, however. It is not clear that Ammonius\nand his school rejected or downplayed theurgy; Olympiodorus (in\nPhd., Lect. 8, sec. 2) puts theurgy on the highest level of\nvirtue: philosophy can make us Intellect, while theurgy can unite us\nwith the intelligibles, so that we act paradeigmatically (cf. Blank\n2010, 659–660). Still, as Sorabji says (2016c, 47), he\napparently addressed his students as if they were all Christians, and\nwithout the volatile mix of pagans, Christians, and those who were\nwavering, the danger of Ammonius’ day was absent; Ammonius would\nhave had much more reason to agree to keep theurgy out of his\nclassroom after the riots of 486 and persecution of 489. If on the\nbasis of its absence from his commentaries on Aristotle we say that\nAmmonius de-emphasized theurgy or kept it to himself, he appears to\nhave done so consistently throughout his career, so that this cannot\nbe used as evidence of any forced change in his teaching. Did he,\nthen, agree to continue doing what he had been doing all along?\nPerhaps the mere fact of Ammonius’ willingness to approach and\nmake an agreement with Peter was enough to justify the disdain of\nDamascius. \nCan we ascertain Ammonius’ attitude to theurgy and\n‘Egyptian’ or ‘Hellenic’ rites? Beyond the\ncommentaries we have three quasi-historical sources for Ammonius:\nDamascius’ Life of Isidore and Zacharias’\nLife of Severus and Ammonius. In narrating the early\nlife of Severus (Bishop of Antioch 512–518, though he was a\npagan during his student days at Alexandria in the 480’s),\nZacharias recounts the story of Paralius, a student in\nHorapollo’s school undecided between paganism and Christianity\n(see Watts 2005). In 486 after taunting the philosopher Asclepiodotus\nfor his claim to have got his hitherto infertile wife pregnant by\nEgyptian magic, Paralius was set upon and beaten by the Hellenic\nstudents of the school on a Friday, when the Christians were largely\nabsent. This incident resulted in complaints to Entrechius the Prefect\nand to the Bishop, Peter Mongus, leading to the ransacking of the\nsanctuary of Isis at Menouthis and the burning of many hieratic cult\nobjects. The professors of the school accused in this incident were\nHorapollon himself, along with the ‘philosophers’\nAsclepiodotus, Heraïscus, Ammonius, and Isidore. Nothing further\nis said about Heraïscus or Ammonius; Zacharias had already\nridiculed Asclepiodotus, who subsequently repaired to Aphrodisias, and\nhe remarks that Isidore was later revealed as a magician and\ntroublemaker. Thus, Zacharias associates Ammonius with colleagues whom\nhe generally labels philosophers and adherents of the Egyptian\nmysteries, but gives us no particulars about him. In his Life of\nSeverus, Zacharias focused on the conflicts between Alexandrian\npagans and Christians, showing the winning and salvific force of\nChristianity. In the Ammonius he portrayed the superiority of\nChristian doctrine, especially that the world was created, and the\ndialectical victories of a Christian student over the more\nphilosophically experienced pagans Ammonius and Gesios. Therefore,\nthat book avoids the cultic conflict altogether and tells us nothing\nabout Ammonius relating to theurgic belief or ritual.  \nDamascius and his hero Isidore, on the other hand, were fervent\nadherents of theurgy and practitioners of hieratic ritual, and\nDamascius’ cast of characters are divided into those who\npracticed such ritual (good), those who were especially divinely\ngifted (better), and those whose participation was nil or is passed\nover in silence (bad guys); Ammonius is among the latter. The same was\nnot true of his family, however, as Damascius saw them. Hadot (2015,\n1–14) argues for the importance of religiosity and theurgy in the\nAlexandrian, as well as in the Athenian, school. Plutarch, who\nintroduced Iamblichean Platonism into Athens, had three famous\nstudents: Hierocles, Syrianus, and Proclus. Of the first two,\nAlexandrians by birth, Hierocles, author of a book on the Pythagorean\nGolden Verses, returned to teach in his native city, while\nSyrianus was chosen by Plutarch to succeed him. Proclus was younger\nthan these. Born in Byzantium and raised in Lycian Xanthos, convinced\nthat his Alexandrian teachers did not read Plato in the true spirit of\nthe philosopher and mindful of the divine vision and calling he had\nreceived in Xanthos (Marinus, Life of Proclus 10)—not\nthe last gift he would receive from the gods—he left Alexandria\nfor Athens. Hermeias studied with Syrianus; his commentary on the\nPhaedrus cites the Chaldaean Oracles and Orphic\nHymns frequently. Hermeias’ wife Aedesia not only\nshared her husband’s virtuous character, she was “so pious\ntoward God and holy and, to tell the whole of it, beloved of the gods\nthat she was accorded many epiphanies” (Damascius, Life of\nIsidore 56). Indeed, the first child born to the couple was a boy\nof such wondrous qualities and virtue that he departed this life at\nage seven, “unable to bear his embodied existence”\n(Life of Isidore 57A). As for Ammonius himself, we have seen\nhim listed (Zacharias, Life of Severus 16 and 22) as one of\nthe four philosophy teachers associated with the philologist\n(grammatikos) Horapollon and mocked for their adherence to\nthe pagan gods. Of these, Asclepiodotus and Isidore were explicitly\nconnected by Zacharias with Egyptian religion and magic. Damascius\n(Life of Isidore 81) describes how Asclepiodotus was saved\nfrom drowning by divine intervention, “such was his divine\npower, even while he was still embodied”. Heraïscus he\ndescribes as having a divine nature and living in such a way that his\nsoul dwelt as much as possible among shrines and places of initiation\n(Life of Isidore 72A, B). Of the four, then, only about\nAmmonius does Damascius report nothing regarding theurgy, mysteries,\nor holiness. Is this an accurate picture, or is Damascius’\nsilence as malicious as his words?  \nAmmonius’ ‘deal’ with the Bishop is attested only by\nDamascius, who despises Ammonius. Although he could have connected\nAmmonius’ agreement with his debts, Damascius chose instead to\nemphasize his greed, blackening his character with a trait\n(aischrokerdēs) which Plato had said (Republic\n408c3–4) would be incompatible with the demigod Asclepius’\ndivinity, if shown in his medical practice; it must be equally bad for\nAmmonius in his profession. As Photius already reports, Damascius\nalways mixed praise for some traits with blame for others in each\nperson he reports on. He also plays characters one against the other\n(cf. O’Meara 2006). Damascius prepared his claim about\nAmmonius’ greed by his idealization of Hermeias, who even told\nmerchants that their wares were priced too low (Damascius 54), and of\nAedesia, whose continuation of her husband’s charitable giving\nput the family into debt, and of the couple’s saintly eldest son\n(Damascius 56). The respect and love which Ammonius’ parents\nearned from both philosophers and the masses form an implicit contrast\nto the conflict surrounding Ammonius and his greed. The rhetorical\nstructure of Damascius’ narrative thus casts doubt on any\n‘deal’ between Ammonius and the Bishop, which may have\nbeen the result of pure speculation on Damascius’ part, combined\nwith his animus toward Ammonius (see Blank 2010, 657–660).\nDamascius actually admits (120B) making such an inference in the case\nof Horapollon, who he says deserted to ‘the others’, a\nconversion that “he apparently chose on his own, not compelled\nby any misfortune, perhaps too from the demands of an insatiable\ngreed; for it is not easy to propose any other reason to excuse his\nconversion”.  \nIs a deal with the Bishop necessary to explain Ammonius’\ncontinued ability to teach in Alexandria? The other professors of\nphilosophy appear to have fled or died during Nicomedes’\ninvestigation in 489, while Ammonius, initially a focus of that\ninvestigation, remained in Alexandria. We are not told that it became\nimpossible for pagans other than Ammonius to teach after 489, and\nthere were evidently Christian students in Ammonius’ school\nafter that date, just as there were earlier. Since Damascius connects\nAmmonius’ deal with his avarice, we should like to know more\nabout his income. In major cities, the role of teacher was associated\nwith payment by the city, and in Constantinople there were chairs paid\nby the Emperor; a law of Justinian in 529, the extension of an order\nof his father (Justin I, 518–527), decrees (Codex Justinianus\n1.5.18.4) that only those of orthodox faith may teach and receive a\npublic stipend (sitēsis dēmosia). Damascius reports\nthat Hermeias had received a municipal stipend, presumably for\nteaching, which his widow managed to have continued until her sons\ncould do philosophy (h&omacr;s ephilosoph&emacr;san, where h&omacr;s is used in the sense of he&omacr;s).\nScholars mostly think this makes it likely that Ammonius took up his\nfather’s position on his return from Athens, or even that his\nfather’s position in the school was held vacant for him and was\npaid in the meanwhile. But there were at least four philosophers\nteaching together with Horapollon in the 480s, so it is difficult to\nassert that Ammonius held ‘the chair’ of philosophy;\nperhaps there were a number of ‘chairs’—difficult,\nbut not impossible, since Ammonius was undoubtedly the most important\nand influential of the four. How long did Aedesia continue to receive\nher dead husband’s salary for her sons, “until they began\nto do philosophy” (h&omacr;s ephilosoph&emacr;san): was\nit until they could receive it in their own right? Damascius uses the\naorist tense of philosophe&omacr; to mean ‘studied\nphilosophy’ (54 Hermeias studied philosophy under Syrianus; 57B\nAmmonius and Heliodorus studied philosophy under Proclus; 71B Isidore\nstudied philosophy under the brothers Heraïscus and Asclepiades;\ncf. 63B while Hierios was studying [philosophounta]\nphilosophy). On that likely reading, Aedesia will have arranged for\nher sons to be supported by the city until she could take them to\nAthens to study philosophy, where they would, as members of the\nAcademy community, have been supported. When they returned to\nAlexandria, they will have made their own way, with the support of\ntheir mother and of family friends; whether with financial support\nfrom students, from the city, or both, is unclear.  \nHadot (2015, 23–25) thinks that Zacharias’ account proves that\nHorapollon’s school was a private institution when Ammonius\ntaught there and that it is highly unlikely that a pagan philosopher\ncould have received a municipal salary in Alexandria in\nAmmonius’ day, due to Christian hostility. She argues Ammonius\nand his colleagues will have relied on students’ fees for their\nincome and therefore been more vulnerable than their Athenian\ncolleagues, who lived communally, supported by the wealth of the\nAcademy, which stemmed from bequests of the pious and learned\n(Life of Isidore 102). Support for this may come from\nOlympiodorus, who says (in Gorg. 43.2, 224.20–24; 43.4,\n225.19–21; 43.6, 226.24–26) that philosophers will receive the merited\nthanks of their students for their help and must therefore not ask\nthem for fees (misthous); but this is a hoary philosophical\ncliché (cf. Xenophon, Mem. 1.2.6–8). In his\narticle on the complex of lecture rooms excavated in Alexandria,\nSorabji (2014, 36–37) points to the size of the establishment and its\nrebuilding and expansion after the earthquake of 535 as indications of\ngenerous municipal support. It may well be that Christian Alexandria\ncontinued to support the teaching of pagan philosophers because they\nhad an audience of students. There were still pagan students and those\nleaning toward paganism in the city. But Christians too will have been\ndrawn to the high reputation of pagan Greek literature and philosophy.\nChristian students will also have sought the kind of dialectical\nskills taught by pagan philosophers and rhetoricians, along with their\nadvanced logical and metaphysical teachings, the better to argue\nagainst them and the better to understand the philosophical basis of\ntheir own Christian faith (cf. Wildberg 2005, 234–236). After all,\nZacharias stayed in Alexandria a year after Severus left to study law\nat Berytus because he needed further study of the rhetoricians and\nphilosophers, so as to fight the pagans, who were so proud of them,\nwith their own weapons (Life of Severus 46; cf. Champion\n2014, 31–32).  \nOne work of Ammonius clearly survives in the written form he gave it,\nhis ‘commentary’ (hupomn&emacr;ma) on\nAristotle’s De Interpretatione. His commentary on\nPorphyry’s Introduction (in Isag.), is\ndescribed in the manuscripts variously as ‘Ammonius the\nPhilosopher’s Exegesis (or Prolegomena or Commentary) of the\nFive Sayings’ and is perhaps another work given its final form\nby Ammonius; but its present Prooemium is, in any case, considered\ninauthentic, and other passages are also interpolations (Busse,\nCAG IV.3 p. vi). \nWe hear of other works published by Ammonius, but these are mostly\nsingle book-rolls, monographs on particular points: \nIn addition, the commentary by an Ammonius on Aristotle’s\nTopics mentioned in Syriac and Arabic authors was perhaps\nwritten by our Ammonius (cf. Stump 1978, 212 and Militello 2014, 92).\n \nThe other works of Ammonius which survive are all derived, directly or\nindirectly, from his lectures, taken down by his students and hence\nmostly described as being ‘from the voice (apo t&emacr;s\nphōnēs, or: the lectures [skholōn]) of\nAmmonius’. Two of these are transmitted under the name of\nAmmonius himself, but are thought to come from the notes of anonymous\nstudents from Ammonius’ lectures: \nTwo courses bear the name of Asclepius (ca. 465- ?): \nFour courses are transmitted under the name of John Philoponus (ca.\n490-ca. 570): \nThe titles of three of Philoponus’ Aristotle courses do not\nmention Ammonius, and these were probably perceived as representing\nrather the lectures of Philoponus than those of Ammonius. These are:\n \nHowever, On Nicomachus’ Introduction to Arithmetic\n(in Nicomachi Intro. Arith.) is thought to be lectures by\nPhiloponus based on Asclepius’ publication (see above) of his\nown notes on Ammonius’ lectures (cf. Tarán 1969,\n10–13). \nAmmonius established the tradition of Aristotelian commentary in\nAlexandria. He was followed in this by his students Asclepius,\nPhiloponus (ca. 490–570), Simplicius (writing after 529 after\nmoving to the Athenian school and moving with it from Athens to Persia\nafter the school’s closure under Justinian), and Olympiodorus\n(495/505-after 565). The tradition continues through the Christian\ncommentators Elias (probably a pupil of Olympiodorus), David,\nPs.-Elias and Stephanus (fl. ca. 610). \nDamascius commented that Ammonius, who explicated works of both Plato\nand Aristotle, was more practiced in the latter (Life of\nIsidore 57C). The Christian character in Zacharias’\ndialogue (562–565) accuses Ammonius’ star pupil Gesius and his\ncomrades, presumably including Ammonius, of being accustomed to refute\nPlato’s doctrines, while claiming to be his pupils and wanting\nto be called ‘Platonists’; he also uses a literal\ninterpretation of the cosmogony in Plato’s Timaeus to\ncounter the Aristotelian doctrine of the world’s co-eternity\nwith God espoused by the dialogue’s ‘Ammonius’\ncharacter. Still, Ammonius did lecture on Platonic texts. He is cited\nby name nine times in his student Olympiodorus’ commentary on\nthe Gorgias, three times on the Phaedo, and not at\nall on Alcibiades I; the differences probably reflect the\nfact that for the Gorgias Olympiodorus could rely less on a\nprevious tradition of Neoplatonic interpretation. In all cases, he is\ncited with the greatest respect.  \nThe most substantive comment cited by Olympiodorus from\nAmmonius’ lectures on the Gorgias (§32,2–3)\nis a defense of the four democratic politicians Socrates declines to\ncall statesmen (499b–503c); Ammonius says they are practitioners\nof the ‘intermediate’ rhetoric, rather than of the false\nkind. He draws his explanation from the Republic (425c-427a),\nwhere he distinguishes three kinds of physician: the false kind that\ngives prescriptions aimed at flattery and pleasing the patient, the\ntrue kind that insists the patient do what is best for him, and the\nintermediate kind that gives the patient a true prescription but does\nnot insist that he follow it. In this explanation, Ammonius follows\nthe lead of his father Hermeias, who cited (in Phdr. p.\n231,26–232,14 Lucarini-Moreschini) this passage of the\nGorgias in his explanation of Phaedrus 260d as\nreferring to true, popular, and intermediate rhetoric and the\ndifferent kinds of therapy of the masses they apply. Ammonius’\nlectures on Plato seem to have been enlivened by wit and personal\nremarks, some apparently cited as apophthegms from the great teacher.\nSocrates (Gorgias 513a) warns Callicles against assimilating\nhimself to the current Athenian d&emacr;mos, thereby\nattaining power but perhaps losing all he holds dear. Such\nassimilation, Olympiodorus says, destroys one’s soul utterly;\nthe proper object to which one should assimilate one’s soul is\nthe cosmos, that is, God. Like the Thessalian witches mentioned by\nSocrates, nowadays too the Egyptian magicians claim to have the power\nto ‘draw down the moon’ and run such risk of destruction,\nif they fail. Olympiodorus notes that we must not believe these\nmythical stories, though most people are deceived by them: this is\nsimply an eclipse; similarly, even now they say that there are\nmagicians in Egypt who can change men into crocodiles, asses, or any\nshape they like—but one must not believe it. Indeed, Ammonius\ntold them, in his exegesis, “this experience overpowered me too,\nand when I was a boy I used to believe these things were true”\n(in Gorg. §39,2). Known for astronomical expertise,\nAmmonius was chiding his credulous audience. Another remark of\nAmmonius’ is cited in Olympiodorus’ argument that the myth\nat the end of the Gorgias that emphasizes the judgement of\nour souls in the underworld over that of judges in our present life\nshows that our actions derive from our own souls’ autonomy.\nOlympiodorus notes (§48,5) that it is up to us to choose virtue\nor vice and that there is no place for astrology, which would nullify\nforesight, law, and justice: “Ammonius the philosopher says\n‘I know some men who have the astrological horoscope of\nadulterers, yet are temperate, since the self-moving nature of the\nsoul dominates’”. Again, Ammonius does not deny the\ninfluence of the stars in our lives, but insists that our individual\nchoice plays an overriding role. Explaining that aristocracy is the\nbest government, Olympiodorus (§42,1–2) likens the city to\nthe cosmos, ruled best by God, citing the Homeric line so favored by\nAristotle (Metaphysics 12.10, 1076a4) and his Neoplatonic\nexegetes: “Rule of many is not good: let there be one\nchief!”. If someone objects that this is rather monarchy than\naristocracy, respond with Ammonius: “Keep silent; let him have\nyour fist”!  \nIn his lectures on Aristotle, Ammonius was heavily indebted to his\nteacher Proclus, even if he disagreed with him on some important\npoints. The introduction to his in Int. makes Ammonius’\ngreat debt to Proclus clear: “Now, we have recorded the\ninterpretations of our divine teacher Proclus, successor to the chair\nof Plato and a man who attained the limits of human capacity both in\nthe ability to interpret the opinions of the ancients and in the\nscientific judgment of the nature of reality. If, having done that, we\ntoo are able to add anything to the clarification of the book, we owe\ngreat thanks to the god of eloquence” (1,6–11; cf. in\nAn. Pr. 43,30, with a citation of Proclus’ School\nCommentary [skholikon hupomn&emacr;ma]). Proclus, in\nturn, often used Iamblichus (see, e.g., in An. Pr. 40,16). In\naddition, Ammonius used other commentators. For example in his in\nInt., most of his material comes from Proclus’ lectures,\nbut Ammonius has polished up what he had in his notes of those\nlectures, then added material of his own or from other sources. In\nthis case, Ammonius’ main source for supplementing\nProclus’ lectures was apparently the now lost voluminous\ncommentary (see Stephanus in Int. 63,9) of Porphyry, which\nwas also the major source of Boethius’ commentary on De\nInt. and probably also of Ammonius’ citations of earlier\nauthors, such as Alexander of Aphrodisias (active late 2nd\nto early 3rd century), Aspasius (first half of\n2nd century), Herminus’ (2nd C.), and the\nStoics. Both Porphyry and Proclus held Int. c. 14 to be\nspurious (252,10 ff.). Although Ammonius agreed, unlike them he\ndecided to include commentary on the chapter, which he repeats\n‘verbatim’ from Syrianus, having nothing of his own to add\n(254,22–31; cf. 253,12). \nThe sources on which Ammonius drew and his mode of using them will\nlikely have varied according to the nature of the previous\ncommentaries he could work with for each text. In Asclepius’\npublished version of Ammonius’ lectures, for example, we see a\nvery different procedure from the one Ammonius followed in writing out\nhis own commentary on De Interpretatione and basing it on\nProclus’ lectures. It is difficult to say to what extent\nAsclepius’ commentary on Metaphysics A–Z is\neither a reflection or a more thorough reworking of Ammonius’\nlectures. Still, this work is reasonably thought to give the best\nrepresentation we have of the lectures themselves, copied down by\nAmmonius’ student ‘from the voice’ of the master.\nIndications of the commentary’s origin in the lectures abound\n(cf. Luna 2001, 100–103): the explanation of a passage often\nbegins by referring to “what was said yesterday” (e.g.,\n3,13; 433,18–19); we are told that “the teacher of\nmedicine Asclepius, who studied with us at these lessons” raised\na question, and “our professor of philosophy” answered him\n(143,31 ff.). That faithful transcription of lectures was practiced\nand thus could have formed the basis of a later reworking for\npublication is implied by Damascius’ story (45A) about\nTheosebius, who compared his own transcripts of lectures on the\nGorgias given at two different times by his master Hierocles\nand found nothing repeated between the two versions, “each of\nwhich, however improbable it is to hear, hewed as much as possible to\nthe intention of Plato”.  \nIn Asclepius of Tralles’ commentary on Metaphysics A-Z\nthere are two voices: the Peripatetic voice of Aristotle and Alexander\nof Aphrodisias and the Neoplatonic voice of Syrianus and Ammonius.\nAsclepius begins with a lemma taken from Aristotle, sometimes\nparaphrases it, and explains its philosophical significance; then, if\nnecessary, he explains why Aristotle was wrong, saying that “we,\non the other hand, say” or “against this we say” or\n“our teacher of philosophy Ammonius says”, or else why\nAristotle appears wrong but really agrees with Plato. Next, he\nexplains the Aristotelian text itself, usually taking the explanation\nfrom Alexander, either word-for-word or in paraphrase; occasionally,\nhe appears to have drawn his paraphrase of Alexander from Syrianus.\nAsclepius’ commentary and, presumably, Ammonius’ lectures,\nthen, combine the inheritance of Alexander and of Syrianus, a move in\nkeeping with the opinion of Syrianus himself, who introduced his\ncommentary on Metaphysics Γ saying (54,11–15):\n“[Aristotle] will attempt to teach [these things] in this book,\nwhich, since it has been made sufficiently clear by the very\nhardworking Alexander, we will not interpret in its entirety. But if\nhe seems to us to say something that is troublesome [and requiring]\nscrutiny, that part we will try to examine, summarizing all the rest\nfor the sake of the treatise’s coherence.” The commentary\non Metaphysics A, closely studied by Cardullo (2012),\nprovides numerous clear examples of Asclepius’—i.e.,\nAmmonius’—procedures. Thus, in explaining the famous\ndeclaration of all men’s desire for knowledge in the opening\nsentence of the Metaphysics, Ammonius goes through a number\nof different types of knowledge, following Aristotle, ending with art,\nwhich is superior to experience, since it knows the\n‘why’ and not just the\n‘that’: “Hence Plato says of the divine\nmind ‘I do not call art that which is an irrational\nthing’”. With this reference to Gorgias 465a6,\nAsclepius-Ammonius cites (28,3–6 on Metaph. 984b1) a\nPlatonic argument in explanation of an Aristotelian one to show their\nclose relation. Later, Asclepius attributes Aristotle’s argument\nthat wisdom is chosen for itself, not for the sake of something else,\nto Plato (20,15–16; cf. Cardullo 2012, 266 n. 391). In another\ninstance of this kind of association, Asclepius comments that\n“it is good that sensible things exist: even pitch is necessary\nfor the perfection of the cosmos, and ‘it is unjust to leave\nsuch a great matter to chance or luck’, but only to God, who has\ncreated everything because of his own goodness”. That the\nreference is to the Demiurge of the Timaeus (29e) is evident\nfrom the emphasis on the creator’s goodness, and the producing\ncause is here connected with the Unmoved Mover, which is a final cause\ndue to its goodness (Cardullo 2012, 294 n. 488).  \nFrom Ammonius’ version of the list of ten preliminary topics\nrecommended by Proclus for those beginning to study Aristotle (cf.\nElias, in Cat. 107,24–27), we know that the study of\nAristotle in Ammonius’ school began with logic, then moved on to\nethics, physics, mathematics, and theology (Ammonius, in Cat.\n5,31–6,8). Ammonius also introduced as a new set a sequence of\nlessons introductory to the study of Aristotle consisting of: an\nintroduction to philosophy; an introduction to Porphyry’s\nEisag&omacr;g&emacr; or Introduction to Aristotle’s\nlogic; a commentary on Porphyry’s Introduction; the\nreading of Porphyry’s Introduction itself; an\nintroduction to the philosophy of Aristotle; an introduction to the\nCategories (cf. Sorabji 2016c, 48–50; Hadot, 1988,\n44–45). The introduction to philosophy was particularly\ncongenial and influential, giving a number of definitions of\nphilosophy and, particularly, two definitions ‘from the\ngoal’: Plato’s ‘assimilation to God as far as\npossible’ (Theaetetus 176b) and ‘practice of\ndeath’ (Phaedo 64a; Ammonius, in Isag. 3,7 ff.\nand 4,15 ff.). Lectures on the works of Plato and Aristotle presumably\nlasted about an hour. In Proclus we see signs of such hour-long\ndivisions, as well as a division of the lecture on an individual\npassage into discussion of its doctrine (the&omacr;ria),\nsometimes quite wide-ranging, followed by its wording\n(lexis); signs of this division are still present in\nAmmonius’ in Int. Students evidently took copious\nnotes, which they might then publish, under their own names or that of\nAmmonius himself. \nThe lectures of Ammonius and his students gave a very detailed\nexegesis of their text and an indication of its philosophical\nimportance, including how it related to other texts of Aristotle and\nPlato. These two philosophers were each taken to be substantially\nself-consistent and uniform in opinion throughout his own writings,\nand in agreement with one another and with the truth (see, e.g.,\nSimplicius, in DA 1,3–21). According to Elias (in\nCat. 107,24–7), Proclus put together a list of ten\nquestions to be answered preliminary to the study of Aristotle, and it\nis Ammonius who gives us the first preserved version of these. One of\nthe preliminary questions concerns the role of the interpreter. Elias\n(in Cat. 122,25–123,5) says that the exegete is also a\nknower, in the one capacity explaining what is unclear in his text and\nin the other judging its truth and falsity. He ought not to insist\nthat his author is always correct, but he ought rather to value the\ntruth more than the man; he ought not to become an exclusive partisan\nof his philosopher, as Iamblichus was for Plato. Further, he ought to\nknow all of Aristotle, so that he can show on the basis of\nAristotle’s works that he agrees with himself; he ought to know\nall of Plato, so that he can show that Plato agrees with himself,\nwhile making the works of Aristotle an introduction to those of Plato.\nThese requirements are associated with Ammonius by Olympiodorus in his\ncommentary on the Gorgias (cf. Tarrant in Jackson et al.\n1998, 11 and notes on 32.1 and 42.2), and one can see the insistence\non knowing and judging the truth over loyalty to Aristotle in\nAmmonius’ own introductory precepts (in Cat. 7,34\nff.). \nThe later Alexandrian commentators tend to emphasize that it is the\ncommentator’s duty not to interpret apparent disagreements of\nAristotle with Plato literally, but to look to the sense and discover\nthe fundamental agreement or ‘harmony’\n(sumph&omacr;nia) of the two philosophers (e.g., Simplicius,\nin Cat. 7,31). Ammonius’ own statement of the qualities\nof an exegete (in Cat. 7,34 ff.) does not say this, but in\npractice he does point out the agreement of Plato and Aristotle\n(in Int. 39,11). Syrianus and Proclus criticized, at times\nharshly, Aristotle’s disagreement with Plato’s views on,\ne.g., the existence of Forms and the demiurgic role of God as crafting\nand creating the physical world. In contrast, Ammonius points out\n(Asclepius, in Metaph. 69,17–27; cf. Sorabji 2005, vol.\n3 sect. 5(d), and Cardullo 2012, 78–81) that, while Aristotle\n‘seems’ to be attacking Plato on the Forms in\nMetaph. 990b3, he actually agrees with Plato, since he\npraises (De An. 429a28) those who say that the soul is the\nplace of Forms. Ammonius also makes God the efficient cause of all\nthings, in addition to being the final cause (see below, sect. 3.2).\nThis appears to be a characteristic difference of approach between\nSyrianus-Proclus and Ammonius and his pupils: the latter outdo the\nformer in their concern to ‘harmonize’ Aristotle’s\nand Plato’s views and their willingness to interpret Aristotle\nas not disagreeing with Plato in any fundamental way.  \nFor four reasons it is difficult to pinpoint Ammonius’ own\nphilosophical positions and contributions to philosophy or to the\ninterpretation of Aristotle: (1) Our evidence is confined to\ncommentaries on Aristotle, whose interpretation did not leave as much\nscope for expounding Neoplatonic ideas as did that of Plato. (2) He\ndepends in these works on Proclus, whose Aristotle lectures or\ncommentaries do not survive, so that we cannot be sure what in them is\nreally his own. (3) Some of Ammonius’ works failed to reach us.\n(4) We have to depend to a significant degree on his pupils’\nwritings for our information about him and his contributions, and\ntheir own stance may be difficult to separate from that of Ammonius\nhimself. The best approach at present attempts to piece together\nAmmonius’ views from his commentary on De\nInterpretatione, from statements attributed to him by later\ncommentators, and from those lectures of Ammonius which were either\npublished by students under Ammonius’ name or which, while\npublished under students’ names, seem to show little sign of\nhaving altered his teachings—namely, Asclepius on the\nMetaphysics and the early commentaries of Philoponus (or\ntheir early versions, in the case of commentaries, such as that on the\nPhysics, which were revised). The use of Philoponus to\nrecover Ammonius’ positions was much advanced by Verrycken\n1990a; his chronology of the commentaries by Philoponus—and\nhence, the degree to which they may represent the thought of Ammonius,\nbefore Philoponus departed from it in important ways—has\nrecently been revisited by Golitsis 2008 and Sorabji 2016d. (see\nabove, sect. 1.2). \nIt was claimed by K. Praechter (1910) that the Alexandrian Neoplatonic\nschool of Ammonius and his followers differed substantially from that\nof Athens both before and after Ammonius’ time, particularly by\ndownplaying the Iamblichean theurgic or magical and religious elements\nand the complex Iamblichean and Proclan hierarchies and triadic\ngroupings at the different levels of reality recognized in\nNeoplatonist metaphysics (on these, see, e.g., Wallis 1972,\n100–110, 123–34, 146–54). In contrast to these wild\nand woolly Athenian doctrines and practices, Praechter saw the\nAlexandrian school, in whose commentaries such doctrines do not figure\nprominently, as more restrained, rational, respectable; they were\nsober interpreters of Aristotle and had a doctrine much more easily\nreconcilable with the strong Christian cult of Alexandria. Scholars\nlike P. Merlan (1968) went further, making Ammonius the purveyor of a\nstrongly Christianized philosophy which featured a creative, personal\nGod. \nRecent studies of the Alexandrians (especially Hadot 1978 on Hierocles\nand Simplicius, Verrycken 1990a on Ammonius, Tempelis 1999, Luna 2001,\nCardullo 2009 and 2012, Hadot 2015, Sorabji 2016a and c) have largely\nresulted in the abandonment of Praechter’s claims. Overlapping\npersonal histories already cast doubt on the hypothesis of a gulf\nbetween the two schools. As noted above, Plutarch’s chosen\nsuccessor Syrianus came from Alexandria together with Hermeias, who\nbrought Plutarch’s and Syrianus’ teachings back from\nAthens to his native city Alexandria. Ammonius studied with and was\nevidently greatly influenced by Proclus in Athens. Furthermore,\nreferences and allusions to various important pieces of Proclan\ndoctrine can be adduced from various places in the commentaries of\nAmmonius and his students. The relative paucity, however, of such\nreferences and their lack of centrality to the works in which they are\nfound makes it difficult to assess their significance in this regard.\nThe interpretation of certain statements which might be interpreted as\ntelling against Ammonius’ espousal of, say, the transcendent\nOne, is also a complex matter. Ammonius’ interpreters now\nrightly rely to a great extent on context in understanding his works.\nThey ask, for example, whenever Ammonius does not mention a particular\nNeoplatonic doctrine or mentions it in a simplified form, whether the\ndoctrine was necessary to an understanding of the passage on which\nAmmonius was commenting. As noted above, Ammonius comments mostly on\nAristotle, especially his logical works. This was the first part of\nthe Neoplatonic curriculum: Marinus (Life of Proclus 13) says\nthat Syrianus taught Proclus all of Aristotle’s works in less\nthan two years and “having led him through these, as it were,\npreliminary initiatory rites and little mysteries, brought him to the\nmystagogy of Plato”. Ammonius apparently held a similar view of\nthe Aristotelian portion of the Neoplatonic curriculum, and in\ncommentary on such works may have felt no need to go into many of the\ndetails of a complex Neoplatonic theology and metaphysics;, even if he\nheld such views. Even the Metaphysics, which according to\nAmmonius dealt with things ‘entirely unmoved’, that is,\n‘theology’ (Asclepius, in Metaph. 1,3 and\n17–18) may not have been thought to require an explanation of\nthe highest levels of reality. In a second statement, explaining the\nfirst line of the book, Asclepius says Aristotle aimed to speak about\n“beings and how they are beings and, to reason about absolutely\nall beings, insofar as they are beings” (2,9–11), which\nHadot (2015, 27) takes to exclude “the entire divine hierarchy\nbeyond being”. The second statement, however, probably derives\nfrom Alexander, who thinks that the Metaphysics is\ntheological in the sense that God is one of the causes of reality and\nthus a subject of ‘first philosophy’ (cf. Cardullo 2012,\n225 n. 230). Ammonius here elides the reasoning needed to get from the\nstudy of being qua being to theology, and there is some\nambiguity as to the extent to which he thinks the role of theology in\nAristotle is the same as in Plato (Hadot 2015, 27 n. 83). In some\ncontexts a discussion of certain metaphysical doctrines might even\nhave been inappropriate, especially if the work under discussion was\nmeant to be studied by less advanced students. Thus, the fact that\nAmmonius does not avail himself of certain opportunities to discuss\ncertain tenets of Neoplatonic metaphysics does not mean that he would\nnot espouse such tenets in other circumstances. Still, the very fact\nthat Ammonius was, as emphasized above, especially known for his\ncommentaries on Aristotle, could reflect a tendency on his part not to\nhave taught a full-blown Neoplatonic metaphysical system. Hadot 2015\ngives a lengthy account of the similarities and differences in the\nways Aristotle and Plato were ‘harmonized’ by various\nPlatonists since Porphyry (cf. the account of various issues on which\nharmonization was needed, as seen in Themistius and then in Ammonius,\nin Sorabji 2016c, 18–20 and 53–55). In agreement with Cardullo\n(e.g., 2009, 245) that one finds in Ammonius an “absolute\nallegiance to Neoplatonism”, Hadot interprets differences\nbetween, say, Syrianus-Proclus and Ammonius as resulting from the\ngreater determination of the latter to minimize their possible\ndisagreements and Ammonius’ consequently greater willingness to\nbend Aristotle in Plato’s direction. There may be debate over\nwhether this involved more ‘Aristotelizing Plato’ or\n‘Platonizing Aristotle’ (cf. Sorabji 2016a,\nxxvii–xxxi for a discussion of Hadot’s objections to\nVerrycken’s [1990] view of Ammonius’ simplification of the\nmetaphysics of the Athenian Neoplatonists). One may also wonder\nwhether Ammonius would have thought that his philosophy differed in\nany important way from that of his Athenian teacher.  \nOn the most general level, Ammonius says that the purpose and utility\nof studying Aristotle’s philosophy is “to ascend to the\ncommon principle (arkh&emacr;) of all things and to be aware\nthat this is the one goodness itself, incorporeal, indivisible,\nuncircumscribed, unbounded and of infinite potentiality” (in\nCat. 6,9–12). Thus, his stance, in this early work, is that\nof a Neoplatonist, as has been clearly shown by Verrycken (1990a,\n212–15). Thus he says that Aristotle’s distinction of\nspoken sound, affection of the soul, and thing in the world (De\nInt. 16a3–8) corresponds to the Neoplatonic hypostases of\nSoul, Intellect and God (in Int. 24,24–9). He also\nplaces ‘not-being’ above the Intellect at the highest\nplane of reality and occasionally writes in a manner reminiscent of\nProclus’ divine henads. So there seems no doubt of his genuine\ncommitment to a Neoplatonic stance in metaphysics, even if, as\nVerrycken would hold, he may not have espoused a system as complex as\nthat of Proclus. \nPerhaps, though, Ammonius set different emphases and cited different\nultimate authorities than the Athenians. Following Iamblichus,\nSyrianus and Proclus held that Plato taught the true philosophy that\noriginated with Pythagoras and various of his followers, including\nParmenides. They also thought the highest expression of this ancient\nwisdom was found in the Orphic Hymns and in the Chaldaean Oracles, and\nthese two works were the final course Syrianus was willing to teach,\nbut only to Proclus and Domninus, though disagreement over which one\nto study caused the two students to be taught separately, and\nProclus’ study of the Oracles was interrupted by\nSyrianus’ death (Marinus, Life of Proclus 26). Proclus\nlater worked intensively on both texts, along with those of Porphyry\nand Iamblichus, and taught them. In fact, “he attained the\nhighest degree of theurgic virtue” (Life of Proclus\n27–28). Ammonius was certainly concerned, in Asclepius’\ncommentary on Metaphysics A, to point out on numerous\noccasions that Aristotle—who criticized the Pythagoreans and,\naccording to Ammonius, also the line of reasoning that led from them\nto Plato—had got them wrong, since he did not understand that\nthey expressed themselves ‘symbolically’ (cf. Cardullo\n2009, 258–259). Again, some argue that Ammonius and his students\ndid not see the importance of the ‘divine poetry’ of\nOrpheus and the Chaldaean Oracles. Hadot 2015, 13–14 counters\nthat citation of these poetic works is also infrequent in Aristotelian\ncommentaries of the Athenian school, while both Olympiodorus and\nDamascius cite the Oracles in their commentaries on Plato’s\nPhaedo. In any event, it is important to note that we have no\nrecord that Ammonius or his pupils lectured or commented on the four\ngreat ‘theological’ dialogues in the Neoplatonic\ncurriculum: Phaedrus, Symposium, Philebus, Parmenides (cf.\nTarrant, in Jackson, et al. 1998, 3).  \nAristotle’s intellectual God seems not to be a good fit for the\nrole of craftsman and creator which God plays in Plato’s\nTimaeus. Proclus (in Tim. 1.266.28–268.24)\nsays as much: while “the Peripatetics say there is something\nseparate [from the physical world], it is not creative\n(poi&emacr;tik&emacr;), but final (telikon); hence they\nboth removed the exemplars (paradeigmata) and set a\nnon-plural intelligence over all things.” Indeed, Proclus says,\nAristotle’s own principles ought to have made him admit that God\nwas a creator. According to Simplicius, Peripatetic interpreters,\nincluding Alexander of Aphrodisias, accepted that God was a final\ncause of the entire world, that God’s moving the heavens made\nhim indirectly the efficient cause of sublunar motion, and that he was\nalso the efficient cause of the heavens’ motion, but not of\ntheir existence as a substance (in Cael. 271,13–21;\nin Phys. 1360,24–1363,24). Simplicius goes on to say\nthat Ammonius devoted an entire book to arguing that, contrary to\nthese Peripatetics, God was both final and efficient cause of both the\nmovement and existence of the whole world, sublunar and supralunar.\nThis interpretation, according to Simplicius, allowed Ammonius to\nharmonize Aristotle with Plato; it should not, therefore, be taken as\na concession to Christian doctrine. Instead of criticizing Aristotle,\nas Proclus had done, Ammonius took five Aristotelian passages and\ninterpreted them as indicating that Aristotle did in fact reason along\nthe lines Proclus had indicated in his criticism. Thus, for example,\nAmmonius argued, according to Simplicius, that in Physics\n2.3, 194b29–32, that from which comes the origin of motion\n(i.e., God, the unmoved mover) is itself a productive cause.\nAmmonius also argued that “if, according to Aristotle, the power\nof any finite body is itself finite, clearly whether it be a power of\nmoving or a power that produces being, then, just as it gets its\neternal motion from the unmoved cause, so it must receive its\neternal being as a body from the non-bodily cause”\n(trs. of this and other relevant texts in Sorabji 2005, vol. 2, sect.\n8(c)1). Ammonius’ harmonization of Aristotle with Plato on this\npoint would prove essential to both Arabic Aristotelians and,\neventually, to Aquinas’ ability to enlist Aristotle’s God\nfor Christianity. Verrycken (1990, 218) interprets Ammonius’\nconception of the relation of God and the world as based on the\nNeoplatonic ‘procession’ (God’s production of the\nworld) and ‘reversion’ (its direction toward God as final\ncause), with God conceived as the divine Intellect. Verrycken (1990,\n222) argues further that Ammonius and his school also conceived of\nAristotle’s God as consisting of two Neoplatonic hypostases, the\nGood and the Intellect, and that he/it could be viewed as either one,\ndepending on one’s point of view: in metaphysics, as we see in\nAsclepius’ commentary, Aristotle’s God is mostly\nunderstood as the Good, “the first origin and final cause of all\nreality”; in natural philosophy, as we see in Simplicius, God is\nprimarily the demiurgic Intellect, which is itself the final cause of\nthe world’s movement. \nIn his commentary on On Interpretation chapter 9, Ammonius\nadded two other determinist arguments to the famous ‘there will\nbe a sea-battle tomorrow’ argument, making his commentary into a\nsmall treatise on determinism. The first of these was the\n‘Reaper’ (131,20 ff.), an argument which Ammonius\nconsidered more ‘verbal’, which perhaps goes back to\nDiodorus Cronus and which greatly interested Zeno the Stoic: “if\nyou will [that is, you are going to] reap, it is not the case that\nperhaps (takha) you will reap and perhaps you will not reap,\nbut you will reap, whatever happens (pant&omacr;s); and if\nyou will not reap, in the same way it is not that perhaps you will\nreap and perhaps you will not reap, but, whatever happens, you will\nnot reap. But in fact, of necessity, either you will reap or you will\nnot reap.” In consequence, Ammonius says, “the\n‘perhaps’ is destroyed,” and with it the contingent.\nAgainst this, Ammonius argues that if the determinist intends\n‘you will reap’ to be contingent, he has already lost his\npoint, but if he intends it as necessary, he is taking for granted\nwhat he intends to prove; further, in that case, ‘will reap,\nwhatever happens’ will be true, but the determinist cannot say\n‘but in fact either you will reap or you will not reap’,\nsince if one of these is necessary, the other is impossible. Sorabji\n(1998, 4–5) argues that ‘perhaps’ is ambiguous,\nmarking either a hesitant statement about the future or a statement\nabout present possibilities, and that the determinist argument plays\non this ambiguity, something which he thinks Ammonius did not see. \nThe second determinist argument, said by Ammonius to be ‘more\nrelated to the nature of things’, is from divine knowledge\n(132,8 ff.): “the gods either know in a definite manner the\noutcome of contingent things or they have absolutely no notion of them\nor they have an indefinite knowledge of them, just as we do.”\nAmmonius shows that the gods must have definite knowledge of their\ncreations. Is the future definite, then, and not contingent, since the\ngods know future facts in a definite manner? Ammonius’ reply to\nthis question is based on the idea (from Iamblichus, originally) that\nthe type of knowledge depends on the type of knower, not on the type\nof thing known. Therefore (136,1–17), due to their own nature,\nthe gods, and only they, can have definite\n(h&omacr;rismen&emacr;) knowledge of future contingent facts,\nthough those facts are indefinite, in themselves, and not determined.\nIndeed, with the gods nothing is past or future (133,20), for they are\noutside of time. \nOnly after discussing these two additional arguments for the abolition\nof contingency does Ammonius consider the sea-battle argument from\nAristotle’s discussion (De Int.18b17–25,\n19a30–32): if every affirmation must be true or false and if\nthere is a sea-battle today, it was always true to say that there\nwould be a sea-battle on this day and, hence, it was not possible for\nthis not to happen or not to be going to happen, so that it is\nnecessary for it to happen. Ultimately, all things which are going to\nhappen happen necessarily and none by chance. There has been, since\nthe Stoics, controversy over Aristotle’s answers to this\nargument. What has been called the ‘standard\ninterpretation’ holds that Aristotle thought that, unlike such\nsentences about the past or present, sentences asserting future\nsingular contingent facts are neither true nor false, exempting them\nfrom the principle of bivalence and avoiding the alleged deterministic\nconsequence that contingency and chance are destroyed. There has\nlikewise been a substantial debate over whether Ammonius was an\nadherent of the ‘standard interpretation’ of\nAristotle’s answer (cf. Sorabji 1998, Kretzmann 1998, Mignucci\n1998, Seel 2000ab). \nAmmonius, like Boethius, whose answer is somewhat more complicated,\nattacks the problem by means of his interpretation of\nAristotle’s opening remark in the chapter (18a28 ff.) that,\nwhile the rule that, of every contradictory pair of sentences, one is\ntrue and one false holds among sentences about what is or has\nhappened, as well as sentences about universals taken universally and\nfor singulars in the present or past tense, for universals not said\nuniversally it is not necessary, as he has explained in the preceding;\n“but in the case of future singulars it is not the same.”\nAmmonius interprets “it is not the same” as indicating a\ndoctrine that sentences about future singular contingent events\n‘divide the true and false’ (i.e., obey the principle of\nbivalence) but do so in an indefinite, ‘not in a definite\nmanner’ (ouk aph&omacr;rismen&omacr;s): either there\nwill be a sea-battle tomorrow or there will not be one, and certainly\nthere will not both be one and not, but whichever of these two will\nturn out to be the case, the sentence correctly predicting that\noutcome is true (and the other false) only in an indefinite, not a\ndefinite way. Thus it is not “possible in a definite manner to\nsay which of them will be true and which will be false, since the\nthing has not already occurred but can both occur and not occur”\n(130,23 ff.). \nThe idea of being true ‘in a definite’ or ‘in an\nindefinite manner’ does not occur in De Int. The\ninterpretation of Aristotle’s response to the sea-battle\nargument by this distinction probably goes back to Alexander of\nAphrodisias (cf. Alexander, Quaestiones 1.4 with Sharples\n1992, esp. 32–6). The distinction itself is probably taken over\nfrom the discussion of one of two contrary properties belonging to a\nsubject ‘in a definite manner’ in Cat. 10,\n12b38–40, which may have been suggested to the commentators by\nAristotle’s remark at De Int. 19a33 that\n“sentences are true in the way things are.” What precisely\nis meant by the distinction between being true in a definite or in an\nindefinite manner is obscure, controversial and much debated in the\nliterature: is it the distinction between necessary or causally\ndeterministic truth and mere truth, or that between being already true\nand going to be, while not yet being, true (cf. Nicostratus’\ncharacterization of ‘the Peripatetics’ in Simplicius,\nin Cat. 406,13–407,15)? \nAt the end of his discussion (154,3 ff., interpreting 19a23 ff.),\nAmmonius brings together necessary and definite truth, but not clearly\nenough to resolve all questions about the latter. He uses\nAristotle’s idea that sentences can be necessarily true in two\nways, either absolutely, no matter whether they are said of\nperishable, existing or non-existent things, or for as long as the\npredicate holds of the subject. The whole of a disjunction of\ncontradictory assertions, such as ‘either there will be a\nsea-battle tomorrow or there will not be a sea-battle tomorrow’\nor ‘either Socrates is walking or Socrates is not\nwalking’, is necessarily true in the absolute sense. Ammonius\nsays that this is still the case when, due to the nature of the thing\nin question, one of the disjuncts is true in a definite manner, as in\n‘either fire is hot or fire is not hot’ (154,11). It\nappears, then, that Ammonius treats only the contradictory\ndisjunctions as necessarily true in the absolute sense, while their\ndisjoined parts may be necessarily true in the other sense, that is,\nonly as long as the predicate holds of the subject. In the case of\ncertain facts, such as fire being hot, this is always the case, and of\ntwo contradictory disjuncts the one which asserts this fact is always\ntrue in a definite manner. In the case of contingent facts, then, one\ndisjunct will only be true in a definite manner when the subject\nexists and the predicate is true of it. For Ammonius, when Aristotle\nrestricts the discussion to future contingent facts, this\nmakes it necessary that neither member of a contradiction said about\nthem be true in a definite manner, ‘whatever happens’,\nsince each, being contingent, must be susceptible of both truth and\nfalsity ‘however it chances’ or ‘for the most\npart’ or ‘for the lesser part’. Thus,\nAmmonius’ explanation of Aristotle’s reply to the\ndeterminist has an affinity with his answers to the\ndeterminist’s claims about the ‘Reaper’ (there, the\ndeterminist is said to have illegitimately assumed that ‘you\nwill reap’ is necessary, not contingent; here, to have ignored\nAristotle’s assumption that the disjuncts are contingent) and\nabout divine foreknowledge (there, the gods are said to know things\ndefinitely, because these things are not future for the gods, although\nthey are both future and indefinite for us; here, the future disjuncts\nare each contingent and, thus, not definitely true, it being open for\neach to be true or false in the event). Ammonius’ approach may\nnot be very satisfying to us, in that it does not answer the question\nof what kind of truth-value Aristotle or Ammonius assigned to future\ncontingent propositions, but it keeps to the project of De\nInt., exploring the application of and the exceptions to the rule\nthat every contradictory pair of sentences has one member true and one\nmember false (cf. Whitaker 1996). Boethius (in De Int. II\n106,30–107,16, 208,1–18) also uses the distinction between\nbeing true in a definite and in an indefinite manner, but there is\ndebate among scholars as to whether he understands this distinction\nand its role in Aristotle’s argument in just the same way as\nAmmonius (cf. Sorabji 1998, Kretzmann 1998, Mignucci 1998).  \nAmmonius was chiefly influential as the founder of the school of\nAristotle-interpretation in Alexandria. Nearly all the principal\ncommentators who came after him were his pupils or his pupils’\npupils. He gave a model for the method of exegesis of Aristotle and\nPlato and his lecturing style made an impression on students. His\ncommentary on De Interpretatione was particularly important\nand served as a source for Stephanus and other commentators. In its\ntranslation by William of Moerbeke, this work was influential on\nAquinas and thus on medieval and later Aristotelian philosopy and\nsemantics (cf., e.g., Fortier 2012). Ammonius’ new set of\nintroductions to philosophy and the study of Aristotle, once adopted\nand adapted by his Alexandrian students—Olympiodorus, Elias,\nDavid, Pseudo-Elias, and Philoponus, were also transferred to other\nlanguages and cultures. Importantly, a number of his and his\nstudents’ works were studied and translated into Persian, Arabic\nand Syriac, where Ammonius’ influence was carried forward (cf.\nthe brief overview of the diffusion of Ammonius’ new curriculum\nand its introductions in Sorabji 2016c, 49–53, also with further\nliterature on the translations of works from Ammonius’ school).\nAs an example of this diffusion, take the larger commentary on the\nCategories by Sergius of Reshaina (d. 536), who studied with\nAmmonius at Alexandria and later became a physician in his home city\n(see Hugonnard-Roche 2004 and Watt 2010, both with further\nliterature).","contact.mail":"blank@ucla.edu","contact.domain":"ucla.edu"}]
