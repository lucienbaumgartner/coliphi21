Though decidedly influenced by the work\nand outlook of St. Augustine, James was very much an independent\nthinker, whose originality was fuelled by his attentive reading of the\nGreek and Arabic commentators on Aristotle. On several issues, such as\ncognition, the love of self over God, the relation between the\nspiritual and temporal powers, James held strikingly original and\noften controversial positions.\n\nJames was born in Viterbo around 1255. Nothing is known about the\nearly years of his life. It is presumed that he joined the order of\nthe Hermits of St. Augustine somewhere around 1272. He is first\nmentioned in 1283 in the capitular acts of the Roman province of his\norder as a recently appointed lecturer (lector) in the\nAugustinian Convent of Viterbo. This means that he must have spent the\nprevious five years (i.e., 1278–83) in Paris, as the Augustinian\norder required its lecturers to be trained in theology in that city\nfor a period not exceeding five years. James returned to Paris not\nlong after his appointment in Viterbo, for he is mentioned again in\nthe capitular acts in 1288, this time as baccalaureus\nparisiensis, i.e., as holding a bachelor of theology degree from\nthe University of Paris. After completing his course of studies, James\nwas appointed Master of Theology in 1292 (Wippel 1974) or 1293 (Ypma\n1974), teaching in Paris for the next seven years. His output during\nthat time was considerable. All of his works in speculative theology\nand metaphysics date from the Parisian period. In 1299–1300, he\nwas named definitor (i.e., member of the governing council)\nof the Roman province by the general chapter of his order, and in May\nof 1300 he became regent master of the order’s studium\ngenerale in Naples.  These would be the last two years of\nhis academic career, however, for in September 1302 he was named\nArchbishop of Benevento by Pope Boniface VIII, possibly in gratitude\nfor the support James had shown for the papal cause in his great\ntreatise, De regimine christiano (On Christian\nRulership). In December of the same year, at the request of the\nAngevin King, Charles II, he was transferred to the Archbishopric of\nNaples. He remained in Naples until his death, in 1307 or 1308. \nJames wrote the bulk of his philosophically relevant work while in\nParis. Nothing remains of his early production in that city. His\ncommentary on Peter Lombard’s Sentences has been lost,\nalthough still extant is a so-called Abbreviatio in I Sententiarum\nAegidii Romani (Summary of the First Book of the Sentences of\nGiles of Rome), which recent scholarship suggests might be\nJames’ preparatory notes for lectures on the Sentences rather\nthan a summary of Giles’ commentary to the same (Tavolaro 2018),\nalthough it is unclear whether these notes were prepared during\nJames’ student years in Paris or whether they date from his\nlater teaching in Naples. Also lost are a treatise on the animation of\nthe heavens (De animatione caelorum), as well as a commentary\non Aristotle’s Metaphysics (Expositio primae\nphilosophiae), two works to which James refers explicitly in his\nQuodlibets and which Ypma surmises must have been written during\nJames’ four-year residency as a “formed bachelor”,\ni.e., between 1288 and 1292 (Ypma 1975). \nJames’ most significant works written while in Paris are his\nfour quodlibetal questions and thirty-four disputed questions on the\ncategories as they pertain to divine matters (Quaestiones de\npraedicamentis in divinis), although five of them have actually\nnothing to do with theology or the categories, as they deal with the\nhuman will and the habits (see Ypma 1975 for a possible explanation\nregarding their inclusion in the Quaestiones). These two\nworks constitute the most important sources for our knowledge of\nJames’ philosophical thought. \nIn Naples, James wrote the work for which he is arguably best known\n(Gutiérrez 1939: 61–2), the De regimine\nchristiano, an important work in the history of late medieval\npolitical thought, and the only philosophical work he wrote in the\nlast eight or so years of his life. \nJames is not the author of two works that have been regularly\nattributed to him by scholars, the De perfectione specierum\n(Ypma 1974, Tavolaro 2014), and the Quaestiones septem de\nverbo (Seven Disputed Questions on the Divine Word)\n(Guttiérez 1939, Scanzillo 1972, Ypma 1975). The author of the\nDe perfectione specierum is James of Saint Martin (Maier\n1943), or James of Naples, as he is referred to in the manuscripts, an\nAugustinian Hermit who was active in the late fourteenth century; and\nthe author of the Quaestiones septem de verbo, as Stephen\nDumont has recently shown (Dumont 2018b), was James’\nconfrère and near-successor at the head of the Augustinian\nschool in Paris, Henry of Friemar.  \nThe following table provides the list of James’ authentic works\nwith approximate dates of composition. Single asterisks mark those\nwhich have been fully edited; double asterisks indicate those for\nwhich there exist only partial editions: \nLike many of his contemporaries, James devotes serious attention to\ndetermining the status of theology as a science and to specifying its\nobject, or rather, as the scholastics say, its subject. In\nQuodlibet III, q. 1, he asks whether theology is principally\na practical or a speculative science. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, for an\nAugustinian, James responds that the end of theology resides\nprincipally not in the knowledge but in the love of God. The love of\nGod, informed by grace, is what distinguishes the way in which\nChristians worship God from the way in which pagans worship their\ndeities. For philosophers—James has Cicero in\nmind—religion is a species of justice; worship is owed to God as\na sign of submission. For the Christian, by contrast, there can be no\nworship without an internal affection of the soul, i.e., without love.\nJames allows that there is some recognition of this fact in Book X of\nthe Nicomachean Ethics, for the happy man would not be\n“most beloved of God,” as Aristotle claims he is, if he\ndid not love God by making him the object of his theorizing. In this\nsense, it can be said that philosophy as well sees its end as the love\nof God as its principal subject. But there is a difference, James\ncontends, in the manner in which a science based on natural reason\naims for the love of God and the manner in which sacred science does\nso: sacred science tends to the love of God more perfectly. One way in\nwhich James illustrates the difference between both approaches is by\ncontrasting the ways in which God is the “highest” object\nfor metaphysics and for theology. The proper subject of metaphysics is\nbeing, not God, although God is the highest being. Theology, on the\nother hand, views God as its subject and considers being in relation\nto God. Thus, James concludes, “theology is called divine or of\nGod in a much more excellent and principal way than metaphysics, for\nmetaphysics considers God only in relation to common being, whereas\ntheology considers common being in relation to God”\n(Quodl. III, q. 1, p. 20, 370–374). Another way in\nwhich James illustrates the difference between natural theology and\nsacred science is by means of the distinction between the love of\ndesire (amor concupiscientiae) and the love of friendship\n(amor amicitiae) to which I will return in section 7.3. James\ndefines the love of desire as “the love of some good which we\nwant for ourselves or for others,” and the love of friendship as\n“the love of someone for their own sake.” The love of God\nphilosophers have in mind, James contends, is the love of desire; it\ncannot, by the philosophers’ own admission, be the love of\nfriendship, for according to the Magna Moralia, friendship\ninvolves a form of community or sharing between the friends that\ncannot possibly obtain between mere mortals and the gods. Now although\nJames concedes that a “community of life” between God and\nman cannot be achieved by natural means, it is attainable through the\ngift of grace. The particular friendship grace affords is called\ncharity and it is to the conferring of charity that sacred scripture\nis principally ordered. \nLike all scholastics since the early thirteenth century, James\nsubscribes to the distinction between God’s ordained power,\naccording to which “God can only do what he preordained he would\ndo according to wisdom and will” (Quodl. I, q. 2, p.\n17, 35–37) and his absolute power, according to which he can do\nwhatever is “doable,” i.e., whatever does not imply a\ncontradiction. Problems concerning what God can or cannot do arise\nonly in the latter case. James considers several questions: can God\nadd an infinite number of created species to the species already in\nexistence (Quodl. I, q. 2)? Can he make matter exist without\nform (Quodl. IV, q. 1)? Can he make an accident subsist\nwithout a substrate (Quodl. II, q. 1)? Can he create the\nseminal reason of a rational soul in matter (Quodl. III, q.\n10)? In response to the first question, James explains, following\nGiles of Rome but against the opinion of Godfrey of Fontaines and\nHenry of Ghent, that God can by his absolute power add an infinite\nnumber of created species ad superius, in the ascending order\nof perfection, if not in actuality, then at least in potency. God\ncannot, however, add even one additional species of reality ad\ninferius, between prime matter and pure nothingness, not because\nthis exceeds his power but because prime matter is contiguous to\nnothingness and leaves, so to speak, no room for God to exercise his\npower (Côté 2009). James is more hesitant about the\nsecond question. He is sympathetic both to the arguments of those who\ndeny that God can make matter subsist independently of form and to the\narguments of those who claim he can. Both positions can reasonably be\nheld, because each argues from a different (and valid) perspective.\nProponents of the first position argue from the point of view of\nreason: because they rightly believe that God cannot make what implies\na contradiction, and because they believe (rightly or wrongly) that\nmaking matter exist without form does involve a contradiction, they\nconclude that God cannot make matter exist without form. Proponents of\nthe second group argue from the perspective of God’s omnipotence\nwhich transcends human reason: because they rightly assume that\nGod’s power exceeds human comprehension, they conclude (rightly\nor wrongly) that making matter exist without form is among those\nthings exceeding human comprehension that God can make come to\npass. \nAnother question James considers is whether God can make an accident\nsubsist without a subject or substrate. The question arises only with\nrespect to what he calls “absolute accidents,” namely\nquantity and quality, as opposed to relational accidents—the\nremaining categories of accident. God clearly cannot make relational\naccidents exist without a subject in which they inhere, for this would\nentail a contradiction. This is so because relations for James, as we\nwill see in\n section 3.3\n below, are modes, not things. What about absolute accidents? As a\nCatholic theologian, James is committed to the view that some\nquantities and qualities can subsist without a subject, for instance\nextension and color, a view for which he attempts to provide a\nphilosophical justification. His position, in a nutshell, is that\naccidents are capable of existing independently if they are thing-like\n(dicunt rem). Numbers, place (locus), and time are\nnot thing-like and are thus not capable of independent existence;\nextension, however, is and so can be made to exist without a subject.\nThe same reasoning applies to quality. This is somewhat surprising,\nfor according to the traditional account of the Eucharist, whereas\nextension may exist without a subject, the qualities, color, odor,\ntexture, necessarily cannot; they inhere in the extension. James,\nhowever, holds that just as God can make thing-like quantities to\nexist without a subject, so too must he be able to make a thing-like\nquality exist without the subject in which it inheres. Just which\nqualities are capable of existing without a subject is determined by\nwhether or not they are “modes of being,” i.e., by whether\nor not they are relational. This seems to be the case with health and\nshape: health is a proportion of the humors, and so, relational;\nlikewise, shape is related to parts of quantity, without which,\ntherefore, it cannot exist. Colors and weight, by contrast, are\nnon-relational, according to James, and are thus in principle capable\nof being made to exist without a subject. \nThe fourth question James considers in relation to God’s\nomnipotence raises the interesting problem of whether the rational\nsoul can come from matter. James proceeds carefully, claiming not to\nprovide a definitive solution but merely to investigate the issue\n(non determinando sed investigando). The upshot of the\ninvestigation is that although there are many good reasons (the\nsoul’s immortality, its spirituality and its per se\nexistence) to say that God cannot produce the seminal reason of the\nrational soul in matter, in the end, James decides, with the help of\nAugustine, that such a possibility must be open to God. Thus, it is\ntrue in the order which God has de facto instituted, that the\nsoul’s incorruptibility is repugnant to matter, but this is not\nso in absolute terms: if God can miraculously cause something to come\nto existence through generation and confer immortality upon it (James\nis presumably thinking of Christ), then he can make it come to pass\nthat souls are produced through generation without being subject to\ncorruption. Likewise, although it appears inconceivable that something\nmaterial could generate something endowed with per se\nexistence, it is not impossible absolutely speaking: if God can confer\nseparate existence upon an accident—despite the fact that\naccidents naturally inhere in their substrates—then, in like\nmanner, he can confer separate existence upon a soul, although it has\na seminal reason in matter. \nThe scholastics held that because God is the creative cause of all\nnatural beings, he must possess the ideas corresponding to each of his\ncreatures. But because God is eternal and is not subject to change,\nthe ideas must be eternally present in him, although creatures exist\nfor only a finite period of time. This doctrine of course raised many\ndifficulties, which each author addressed with varying degrees of\nsuccess. One difficulty had to do with reconciling the multiplicity of\nideas with God’s unity: since there are many species of being,\nthere must be a corresponding number of ideas; but God is one and,\nhence, cannot contain any multiplicity. Another, directly related,\ndifficulty had to do with the ontological status of ideas: do ideas\nhave any reality apart from God? If one denied them any kind of\nreality, it was hard to see how they could function as exemplar causes\nof things; but to assign too much reality to them was to run the risk\nof introducing multiplicity in God and undermining the ex\nnihilo character of creation.  \nOne influential solution to these difficulties was provided by Thomas\nAquinas, who argued that divine ideas are nothing else but the diverse\nways in which God’s essence is capable of being imitated, so\nthat God knows the ideas of things by knowing his essence. Ideas are\nnot distinct from God’s essence, though they are distinct from\nthe essences of the things God creates (De veritate, q. 2, a.\n3). \nOne can discern two answers to the problem of divine ideas in the\nworks of James of Viterbo. At an early stage of his career, in the\nAbbreviatio in Sententiarum Aegidii\nRomani­—assuming one accepts, as seems reasonable, the\nearly dating suggested by Ypma (1975)—James defends a position\nthat is almost identical to that of Thomas Aquinas (Giustiniani 1979).\nIn his Quodlibeta, however, he defends a position that is\ncloser to that of Henry of Ghent. In the following I will sketch\nJames’ position in the Quodlibeta as it provides the\nmost mature statement of his views. For detailed discussions, see\nGossiaux (2007) and Côté (2018).  \nAlthough James agreed with the notion that ideas are to be viewed as\nthe differing ways in which God can be imitated, he did not think that\none could make sense of the claim that God knows other things by\ncognizing his own essence unless one supposed that the essences of\nthose things preexist in some way (aliquo modo) in God.\nJames’ solution is to distinguish two ways in which ideas are in\nGod’s intellect. They are in God’s intellect, firstly, as\nidentical with it, and, secondly, as distinct from it. The first mode\nof being is necessary as a means of acknowledging God’s unity;\nbut the second mode of being is just as necessary, for, as James puts\nit (Quodl. I, q. 5, p. 64, 65–67), “if God knows\ncreatures before they exist, even insofar as they are other than him\nand distinct (from him), that which he knows is a cognized object,\nwhich must needs be something; for that which nowise exists and is\nabsolutely nothing cannot be understood.”  But James also\nthinks that the necessity of positing distinct ideas in God follows\nfrom a consideration of God’s essence. God enjoys the highest\ndegree of nobility and goodness. His mode of knowledge must be\ncommensurate with his nature. But according to Proclus, an author\nJames is quite fond of quoting, the highest form of knowledge is\nknowledge through a thing’s cause. That means that God knows\nthings through his own essence. More precisely, he knows things by\nknowing his essence as the cause of those things, knowledge that is\ndistinct in James’s view from God’s mere knowledge of\nhimself. \nAlthough James’ insistence on the distinctness of ideas with\nrespect to God’s essence is reminiscent of Henry of\nGhent’s teaching, it is important to note, as has been stressed\nby M. Gossiaux (2007), that James does not conceive of this\ndistinctness as Henry does. For Henry, ideas possess “being of\nessence” (esse essentiae); James, by contrast, while\nreferring to divine ideas as things (res), is careful to add\nthat they are not things “in the absolute sense but only in a\nqualified sense,” viz., as cognized objects (Quodl. I,\nq. 5, p. 63, 60). Thus, divine ideas for James possess a lesser degree\nof distinction from God’s essence than do Henry of\nGhent’s. Nevertheless, because James did consider ideas to be\ndistinct in some sense from God, his position would be viewed by some\nlater authors—e.g., William of Alnwick—as compromising\ndivine unity. (See Côté 2016)  \nThe concept of being, all the medievals agreed, is common. What was\ndebated was the nature of this commonness. According to James of\nViterbo, all commonness is founded on some agreement, and this\nagreement can be either merely nominal or grounded in reality.\nAgreement is nominal when the same name is predicated of wholly\ndifferent things, without there being any objective basis for the\napplication of the common name; such is the case of equivocal names.\nAgreement is real in the following two cases: (1) if it is based on\nsome essential resemblance between the many things to which a\nparticular concept applies, in which case the concept applies to these\nmany things by virtue of the self-same ratio and is said of\nthem univocally; or (2) if that concept is truly common to the many\nthings of which it is said, although it is not said of them in\nrelation to the same nature (ratio), but rather it is said in\na prior sense of one and in a posterior sense of others, insofar as\nthey are related in a certain way to the first. A concept that is\npredicated of things in this way is said to be analogous, and the\nagreement displayed by the things to which it applies is said to be an\nagreement of attribution (convenientia attributionis). James\nbelieves that it is according to this sense of analogy that being is\nsaid of God and creatures, and of substance and accident\n(Quaestiones de divinis praedicamentis I, q. 1, p. 25,\n674–80). For being is said in a prior sense of God and in a\nposterior sense of creatures by virtue of a certain relation between\nthe two; likewise, being is said first of substance and secondarily of\naccidents, on account of the relation of posteriority accidents have\nto substance. The reason why being is said in a prior sense of God and\nin a secondary sense of creatures and, hence, the reason why the\n‘ratio’ or nature of being is different in the\ntwo cases is that being, in God, is “the very thing which God\nis” (Quaestiones de divinis praedicamentis, q. 1, p.\n16, 412), whereas created being is only being through something added\nto it. From this first difference follows a second, namely, that\ncreated being is being by virtue of being related to an agent, whereas\nuncreated being has no relation. These two differences can be\nsummarized by saying that divine being is being through itself\n(per se), whereas created being is being through another\n(per aliud) (Quaestiones de divinis praedicamentis,\nq. 1, p. 16, 425–6). In sum, being is said of God and creature,\nbut according to a different ratio: it is said of God\naccording to the proper and perfect nature of being, but of creatures\nin a derivative or secondary way. \nThe question of how being and essence are related to each other, and\nin particular whether they are really identical or not, attracted\nconsiderable interest in the last quarter of the thirteenth century,\nwith all major masters devoting some discussion to it. James of\nViterbo is no exception. Drawing his inspiration from Anselm’s\nsemantics, he attempts to articulate a compromise solution (Gossiaux\n2018) between the main competing solutions on offer in his day. \nJames’ most detailed discussion of the distinction between being\nand essence occurs in the context of a question that asks whether\ncreation could be saved if being (esse) and essence were not\ndifferent (Quodl. I, q. 4). His answer is that although he\nfinds it difficult to see how one could account for creation if being\nand essence were not really different, he does not believe it is\nnecessary to conceive of the real distinction in the way in which\n“certain Doctors” do. Which Doctors does he have in mind?\nIn Quodl. I, q. 4, he summarizes the views of three authors:\nGodfrey of Fontaines, according to whom the distinction is only\nconceptual (secundum rationem); Henry of Ghent, for whom\nesse is only intentionally different from essence, a\ndistinction that is less than a real distinction but greater than a\nverbal distinction; and finally, Giles of Rome, for whom esse\nis one thing (res), and essence another. Thus, James agrees\nwith Giles, and disagrees with Henry and Godfrey, that the distinction\nbetween being and essence is real; however, he disagrees with Giles\nabout the proper way of understanding the real distinction. \nThe starting point of his analysis is Anselm’s statement in the\nMonologion that the substantive lux (light), the\ninfinitive lucere (to-emit-light), and the present participle\nlucens (emitting light) are related to each other in the same\nway as essentia (essence), esse (to be), and\nens (being). The relation of lucere to lux,\nJames tells us, is the relation of a concrete term to an abstract one;\nbut this is just the relation that obtains between being and essence.\nNow, a concrete term signifies more things than the corresponding\nabstract term; for an abstract term signifies only a form, whereas the\nconcrete term signifies the form and the “subject”, i.e.,\nthe bearer of the form; it is said to signify the former principally,\nand the latter secondarily. So it is in the case of being and essence:\nesse signifies the form (principally) and the subject\n(secondarily), while essence signifies the form only. What is taken\nfor granted in this analysis is that the distinction between a form\nand its bearer is a real one, at least in creatures. This is how James\nachieves his compromise solution: pace Godfrey of Fontaines\nand Henry of Ghent there is a real distinction (that between the\nsubject and the form) but pace Giles, it is real only in\nqualified sense, since being principally signifies the same thing as\nessence.  \nJames devotes five of his Quaestiones de divinis\npraedicamentis (qq. 11–15), representing some 270 pages of\nedited text, to the question of relations. It is with a view to\nproviding a proper account of divine relations, he explains, that it\nis “necessary to examine the nature of relation with such\ndiligence” (Quaestiones de divinis praedicamentis, q.\n11, p. 12, 300–301). But before turning to Trinitarian\nrelations, James devotes the whole of q.11 to the status of relations\nin general. The following account focuses exclusively on q. 11. James\nin essence adopts Henry of Ghent’s “modalist”\nsolution, which was to exercise considerable influence among late\nthirteenth-century thinkers (Henninger 1989), although he disagrees\nwith Henry about the proper way of understanding what a mode is. \nThe question boils down to whether relations exist in some manner in\nextra-mental reality or solely through the operation of the intellect,\nlike second intentions (species and genera). Many arguments can be\nadduced in support of each position, as Simplicius had already shown\nin his commentary on Aristotle’s Categories—a\nwork that would have a decisive influence on James’ thought. For\ninstance, in support of the view that relations are not real, one may\npoint out that the intellect is able to apprehend relations between\nexistents and non-existents, e.g., the relation between a father and\nhis deceased son; yet, there cannot be anything real in the relation\ngiven that one of the two relata is a non-existent. But if so, then\nthe same must be true of all relations, as the intellectual operation\ninvolved is the same in all cases. Another argument concerns the way\nin which relations come to be and cease to be. This appears to happen\nwithout any change taking place in the subject which the relation is\nsaid to affect. For instance, a child who has lost his mother is said\nto be an orphan until the age of eighteen, at which point it ceases to\nbe one, although no change has occurred: “the relation recedes\nor ceases by reason of the mere passage of time.” \nBut good reasons can also be found in support of the opposing view.\nFor one, Aristotle clearly considers relations to be real, as they\nconstitute one of the ten categories that apply to things outside the\nsoul. Furthermore, according to a view commonly held by the\nscholastics, the perfection of the universe cannot consist solely of\nthe perfection of the individual things of which it is made; it is\nalso determined by the relations those things have to each other;\nhence, those relations must be real. \nThe correct solution to the question of whether relations are real or\nnot, James contends, depends on assigning to a given relation no more\nbut no less reality than is fitting to it. Those who rely on arguments\nsuch as the first two above to infer that relations are entirely\ndevoid of reality are guilty of assigning relations too little\nreality; those who appeal to arguments such as the last two, showing\nthat relations are distinct from their subjects in the way in which\nthings are distinct from each other, assign too great a degree of\nreality to relations. The correct view must lie somewhere in between:\nrelations are real, but are not distinct from their subjects in the\nway one thing is distinct from another. \nThat they must be real is sufficiently shown by the first Simplician\narguments mentioned above, to which James adds some others of his own.\nHowever, showing that they are not things is slightly more\ncomplicated. James’ position, in fact, is that relations are not\nthings “properly and absolutely speaking,” but only\n“in a certain way according to a less proper way of\nspeaking.” A relation is not a thing in an absolute sense\nbecause of the “meekness” of its being, for which reason\n“it is like a middle point between being and non-being”\n(Quaestiones de divinis praedicamentis, q. 11, p. 30,\n668–9). The reasoning behind this last statement is as follows:\nthe more intrinsic some principle is to a thing, the more that thing\nis said to be through it; what is maximally intrinsic to a thing is\nits substance; a thing is therefore maximally said to be on account of\nits substance. Now a thing’s being related to another is, in the\nconstellation of accidents that qualify that thing, what is minimally\nintrinsic to it and thus farthest from its being, and so closest to\nnon-being. But if relations are not things, at least in the absolute\nsense, what are they? James answers that they are modes of\nbeing of their foundations. “The mode of being of a thing does\nnot differ from the thing in such a way as to constitute another\nessence or thing. The relation, therefore, is not different from its\nfoundation” (Quaestiones de divinis praedicamentis, q.\n11, p. 33, 745–7). Speaking of relations as modes allows us to\nacknowledge their reality, as attested by experience, without\nhypostasizing them. A certain number’s being equal to another is\nclearly something distinct from the number itself. The number and its\nbeing equal are two “somethings” (aliqua), says\nJames; they are not, however, two things; they are two in the\nsense that one is a thing (the number) and the other is a mode of\nbeing of the number. \nIn making relations modes of being of the foundation, James\nwas clearly taking his cue from Henry of Ghent, “the chief\nrepresentative of the modalist theory of relation” (Henninger\n1989). For Henry and James, relations are real in the sense that they\nare distinct from their foundations and belong to extra mental\nreality. However, James’ understanding of the way in which a\nrelation is a mode differs from Henry’s. For Henry, a\nthing’s mode is the same thing as its ratio or nature;\nit is the particular type of being that thing has, what\n“specifies” it. But according to James’\nunderstanding of the term, a mode lies beyond the\nratio of a thing, like an accident of that thing\n(Quaestiones de divinis praedicamentis, p. 34,\n767–8). \nIn conclusion, one could say that in his discussion of relations,\nJames was guided by the same motivation as many of his contemporaries,\nnamely securing the objectivity of relations without conferring\nfull-blooded existence upon them. Relations do exhibit some form of\nbeing, James believed, but it is a most faint one\n(debilissimum), the existence of a mode qua accident. \nJames discusses individuation in two places: Quodl. I, q. 21\nand Quodl. II, q. 1. I will focus on the first treatment,\nbecause it is the lengthier of the two and because the tenor of\nJames’ brief remarks on individuation in Quodl. II, q.\n1, despite certain similarities with his earlier discussion (Wippel\n1994), make it hard to see how they fit into an overall theory of\nindividuation. \nThe question James faces in Quodl. I, q. 21 is a markedly\ntheological one, namely whether, if the soul were to take on the ashes\nor the matter of another man at resurrection, the resulting individual\nwould be the same as before resurrection. In order to answer that\nquestion, James tells us, it is first necessary to determine what the\ncause of numerical unity is in the case of composite beings. There\nhave been numerous answers to that question and James provides a short\naccount of each. Some philosophers have appealed to quantity as the\nprinciple of numerical unity; others to matter; others yet to matter\nas subtending indeterminate dimensions; finally, others have turned to\nform as the cause of individuation. According to James, each of these\nanswers is part of the correct explanation though each is insufficient\nif taken on its own. The correct view, according to him, is that form\nand matter taken together are the principal causes of numerical\nidentity in the composite, with quantity contributing something\n“in a certain manner.” Form and matter, however, are\nprincipal causes in different ways; more precisely, each accounts for\na different kind of numerical unity. For by ‘singularity’\nwe can really mean two distinct things: we can mean the mere fact of\nsomething’s being this or that singular thing, or we can point\nto a thing qua “something complete and perfect within a certain\nspecies” (Quodl. I, 21, 227, 134–35). It is\nmatter that accounts for the first kind of singularity, and form for\nthe second. Put otherwise, the kind of unity that accrues to a thing\non account of its being a mere singular results from the concurrence\nof the “substantial” unity provided by matter and the\n“accidental” unity provided by quantity. By contrast, the\nunity that characterizes a thing by virtue of the perfection or\ncompleteness it displays is conferred to it by the form, which is the\nprinciple of perfection and actuality in composites. \nAlthough James thinks he can quite legitimately enlist the support of\nsuch prestigious authorities as Aristotle and Averroes in favor of the\nview that matter and form together are constitutive of a thing’s\nnumerical unity, his solution has struck commentators as a somewhat\ncontrived and ad hoc attempt to reach a compromise solution at all\ncosts (Pickavé 2007; Wippel 1994). James, it has been\nsuggested, “seems to be driven by the desire to offer a\ncompromise position with which everyone can to some extent\nagree” (Pickavé 2007: 55). Such a suggestion does accord\nwith James’ oft-expressed preference for solutions that present\na “middle way” (media via) among competing\ntheories (Quaestiones de divinis praedicamentis, q. 11, p.\n23, 513; Quodl. II, q. 7, p. 108, 118; De regimine\nchristiano, 210; see also Quodl. II, q. 5, p. 65,\n208–209), although these professions of moderation must\nsometimes be taken with a grain of salt, as we will see in\n Section 8\n below. \nThe belief that matter contains the ‘seeds’ of all the\nforms that can possibly accrue to it is one of the hallmarks of James\nof Viterbo’s thought, as is the belief that the soul\npre-contains, in the shape of “fitnesses”\n(idoneitates), all the sensitive, intellective, and\nvolitional forms it is able to take on, though, as we will see, there\nis an important difference between both cases. I will present\nJames’ doctrine of “fitnesses” in the intellect in\n Section 6,\n and his doctrine of fitnesses in the will in\n Section 6.\n In this section, I review James’ arguments in favor of seminal\nreasons (For a full account see Pickavé and Côté\n2018).  \nJames takes as the point of departure of his analysis of change the\nview commonly attributed to Aristotle by the medievals according to\nwhich substantial change involves a natural agent educing a form from\nthe potency of matter. His contention is that for the form to be\neduced from prime matter it has to preexist in prime matter in an\n“incipient or inchoate” state. Otherwise the forms would\nhave to be put into matter by an external cause. That cause could only\nbe a natural agent or a supernatural one. It cannot be the latter, for\nthen change would no longer be natural; but nor can it be the former\nbecause James holds that forms do not “migrate” from one\nsubstance to another. Hence the forms must preexist in matter.  \nJames holds that the inchoate form present in matter is the same as\nthe full-fledged, actualized form, differing from it only modally\n(Quodl. II, q. 5, p. 70, 386–388). To the objection\nthat if this were true nothing “new” would result from the\nprocess of change, he responded by pointing out that the assumption\nthat natural change results in the emergence of new things is rejected\nby no less an authority than Averroes himself, who denies that natural\nagents “induce something extrinsic in matter”\n(Quodl. II, q. 5, p. 77, 621). What newness does result from\nnatural change is accounted for by the modal difference between the\npotential and the actualized form. \nJames holds that natural change requires two active principles: that\nof the potential form existing in potency in matter, i.e., the seminal\nreason, and that of the extrinsic natural agent acting on the matter.\nHe explicitly denies that the potential form on its own is a\nsufficient cause of change (Quodl. II, q. 5, p. 89,\n1012–1014). The first active principle is that of the inchoate\nform itself: it is active “by means of inclination”, that\nis, it is active inasmuch as it naturally tends to its actualization.\nThe second active principle is the extrinsic agent that educes the\nform from matter; it is active by means of transmutation,\ni.e., by efficiently causing the change by virtue of the power of\nacting (virtus agendi) conferred upon it by God. Both causes\ncooperate in the production of the effect. \nAlthough James teaches that there are preexisting ideas and volitions\nin the soul similarly to the way in which seminal reasons preexist in\nmatter, there is an important difference between the two cases. For\nthe “inclining principles” in matter, he explains in\nQuodl. III, q. 4 (p. 70, 416–424), stand farther from\ntheir actualization than do the inclining principles in the soul. They\nthus require more on the part of the extrinsic transmutative cause\nthan do the soul’s inclining principles. So much so, James\nexplains, that it sometimes appears that all the work is being done by\nthe extrinsic agent. This is not so, of course, as the\n“intrinsic inclining principle” also plays a role. Because\nJames assigns such an important role to external agent causes in his\naccount of natural change, one of the common complaints directed\nagainst theories of seminal reasons, namely that they deny the reality\nof secondary causes, clearly does not apply to his version of the\ntheory.  \nJames’ doctrine of seminal reasons would elicit considerable\ncriticism in the early fourteenth century and beyond (Phelps 1980).\nThe initial reaction came from Dominicans. Bernard of Auvergne wrote a\nseries of Impugnationes (i.e., refutations) contra\nJacobum de Viterbio (see Pattin 1962 and Côté 2016),\nattacking various aspects of James’ metaphysics, including his\ntheory of seminal reasons; and John of Naples later argued against\nJames’ distinction between the potency of matter and matter \ntout court.  James’ theory also encountered resistance from\nwithin the Augustinian Order, e.g., from Alphonsus Vargas of Toledo.\nEven arts masters entered the fray. The Milanese arts master Maino de\nMaineri devoted a lengthy section of one of his questions in his\nquestion-commentary on Averroes’ De substantia orbis\ndating from 1315–1317 to a presentation and rebuttal of James’\ntheory of natural change (see Côté 2019).  \nAccording to Aristotle in the De anima,“ the soul is in\na sense all things.” James wants to infer from this that all\nthings must somehow preexist in the soul “by a certain\nconformity and resemblance.” (Quodl. I, q. 7, p. 91,\n403). James distinguished between three sorts of conformity: the\nconformity between the sense and the sensibles, that between the\nintellect and intelligibles, and that between the will and appetibles.\nHe thus believed that all sensibles must preexist in the sense-power,\nall intelligibles in the intellective power, and all\n“appetibles” in the appetitive power, i.e., the will. They\ndo not preexist in their fully actualized state, of course; but nor do\nthey preexist as purely indeterminate capacities: James holds that\nthey preexist as “incomplete actualities,” innate and\npermanent qualities of the soul tending toward their actualization.\nBorrowing from Simplicius’ commentary on Aristotle’s\nCategories, James described a power of the soul as a\n“general (communis) aptitude (aptitudo) or a\nfitness (idoneitas) with respect to the complete act”\n(Quodl. I, q. 7, p. 92, 421) that is divided into further\nspecific “fitnesses” (speciales idoneitates),\n“following the diversity of objects” of that power. For\ninstance, intellect is a general idoneitas that is subdivided\nin specific idoneitates “following the diversity”\nof intelligibles. Despite what the phrase “following the\ndiversity” would have us believe, James did not assert that the\ndivision of fitnesses in the soul exactly mapped the division of kinds\nof objects. Though he was clearly committed to some correspondence\nbetween the two, he believed it was not possible in this life to know\nhow far the division into specific “fitnesses” proceeded,\nand hence how many “fitnesses” there are in the soul.  \nIn addition to explaining how the soul’s powers relate to\nintelligibles, sensibles and appetibles, James also described their\nrelation to occurrent acts of understanding, sensing, and\nwilling. As with seminal reasons, an aptitude in potency in the soul\nand the corresponding actualized aptitude were not viewed as really\nbut only as modally distinct (Quodl. III, q. 5, p. 84,\n62–63). James also held that each power was both passive and\nactive in relation to its actualization: passive inasmuch as a power\nqua power is not yet actualized, active insofar as it tends toward its\nactualization (Quodl. I, q. 12, p. 165, 281–285). To\nthe argument that nothing could be both active and passive in the same\nrespect, James responded that this was true only of transeunt\nactions, such as fire heating a pot, which require the active cause of\nchange to be distinct from the passive recipient of change, not of\nimmanent actions, as are the operations of the soul. \nAlthough James held that all the soul’s powers were active, they\nwere not so to the same degree: the will and its aptitudes were\nconsidered to be more active and thus “closer” to their\nactualization than those of the intellect; and the intellect and its\naptitudes, in turn, were viewed as more active and closer to their\nactualization than those of the senses. Accordingly, James considered\nthat the more active an aptitude or “inclining principle”\nwas, the more causal power it had and the less causal input it\nrequired from other sources. \nFrom the foregoing it is easy to see what position James would take in\nwhat was a commonly discussed topic in the thirteenth century, namely\nthe problem whether or not the “essence” of the soul was\nreally different from its powers. The position espoused by the\nscholastics whose teachings James studies most carefully, namely\nThomas Aquinas, Giles of Rome, and Godfrey of Fontaines was the soul\nwas indeed really distinct from its powers. There was, however, a\ncommonly discussed minority position, one that eschewed both real\ndistinction and strict identity (which had few followers): that of\nHenry of Ghent. Henry believed that the powers of the soul were\n“intentionally,” not really distinct from its essence.\nJames, however, sided with Thomas, Giles, and Godfrey, against Henry\n(Quodl. II, q. 14, p. 160, 70–71; Quodl. III,\nq. 5, 56–84,63). His reasoning was as follows. Given that\neveryone agreed that there was a real distinction between the essence\nof the soul and one of its powers in act, that is, between\nthe soul and, e.g., an occurrent act of willing, then if one denied\nthat there was a real distinction between the soul and its powers, as\nHenry had, one would be committed to the existence of a real\ndistinction between the power in act (the occurrent act of willing)\nand that same power in potency (the will qua capable of produce that\nact). But as we have already seen, James believed that something in\npotency is not really distinct from that same thing in act. Hence the\nsoul’s essence must be distinct from its powers. \nJames’ longest discussion of cognition occurs in question 12 of\nhis first Quodlibet, which asks whether it is necessary to posit an\nagent intellect in the human soul that is distinct from the possible\nintellect (for discussion see Côté 2013, and\nSolère 2018a and 2018b). Since the view that there is such a\ndistinction was an important component of abstraction theories of\nknowledge, what was really at stake was whether abstraction theory\nprovided the correct account of knowledge acquisition. According to\nabstraction theory, of which Aquinas was one of the most famous\nexponents, the mind derives its content from an engagement with\nsense-images (phantasms). The agent intellect, a “part” of\nthe intellectual soul, was held to abstract intelligible species from\nthe sense-images, and these species were then “received”\nby the possible intellect. Since the same power could not be both\nactive and passive, the two intellects had to be distinct. As can be\ngathered from the preceding section, James would not be favorably\ndisposed to such a theory. Since intelligibles, for him, preexisted in\nthe soul in the form of “aptitudes” or\n“fitnesses,” there was no need for them to be abstracted;\nand since the main reason for positing an agent intellect was to\nperform abstraction, there was no reason to suppose that such a\nfaculty existed — which is exactly the position he defended in\nquestion 12. James’ theory of innate  idoneitates in\nthe soul thus entailed a wholesale rejection of abstraction theories\nof knowledge and of the model of the soul on which they rested\n(Côté 2013).  \nJames was well aware that by denying the distinction between the two\nintellects, he was opposing the consensus view of Aristotle\ncommentators. Indeed, his views seem to run counter to the De\nanima itself, though, as he would mischievously point out, it was\ndifficult to determine just what Aristotle’s doctrine was, so\nobscure was its formulation (Quodl. I, q. 12, p. 169,\n426—170, 439). He explained that what he was denying was not\nthat there was a “difference” in the intellect—the\nsoul’s powers did exhibit such a difference since they were both\nactive and passive—rather, what he was denying was that’s the\nexistence of a difference implied a real distinction of powers\n(Quodl. I, q. 12, p. 170, 440–45). \nAs far as James was concerned the relevant question was not how\nintelligibles are abstracted so as to produce occurrent acts of\ncognition, but rather how innate intellectual aptitudes can develop\ninto occurrent acts of cognition. The key to his solution lay in his\nview that aptitudes actively tend toward their completion. James\ndescribed such active inclination as a kind of\nself-motion—formal self-motion–which he viewed as\nthe main created causal contributor to a power’s actualization.\nBut of course “main causal contributor” does not mean\n“sole causal contributor.;” Although the soul’s\npowers stand closer to their actualization and exercise greater formal\nself-motion than do the seminal reasons in matter, and although the\nintellect and its aptitudes likewise stand closer to their\nactualization and exercise greater self-motion than do the senses and\ntheir aptitudes, no “fitness” on its own is sufficient to\nbring about its actualization (Quodl. I, q. 7, p. 102,\n777–778; something further is required. In the case of the\nsenses, what is required is the “excitative” causality\n(excitatio) exercised by the physical change in the organ of\nsense; in the case of the intellect, it is the excitative causality\nsupplied by the phantasm. In both cases, James held that the\npower’s formal self-motion together with the\n“rousing” action stemming from the organ or the phantasm\nnecessarily entailed their effect. \nJames of Viterbo is thus part of a group of thinkers in the history of\nphilosophy for whom the intellect itself, as opposed to extra-mental\nobjects or their proxies in the soul, is the main causal factor not\nonly of the production of acts of knowledge but of their conceptual\ncontent as well. Indeed, for James, that content is already present in\nthe soul in the form of general and specific “fitnesses”\nor “aptitudes.” The aptitudes are innate (naturaliter\ninditae, “always present in [the soul]”\n(Quodl. I, q. 7, p. 92, 422–423), ready to be\nactualized in the presence of the appropriate triggering factors. Few\nother scholastics were ready to espouse such an extreme form of\ninnatism, which some scholars have likened to the theory innate ideas\nof the Early Moderns (Solère 2018a). \nThe scholastics all agreed that the human will is free. They also\nagreed that the will and the intellect both played a role in the\ngenesis of the voluntary act. What they disagreed about was which of\nthe two faculties had the decisive role. For Henry of Ghent, the will\nwas the sole cause of its free acts (Quodl. I, q. 17), so\nmuch so that he tended to relegate the intellect’s role to that\nof a “sine qua non” cause. At the other end of the\nspectrum of opinions, Godfrey of Fontaines held that the will is\nalways passive in regard to the intellect and that it is the intellect\nthat exercises the decisive motion in producing the voluntary act\n(Quodl. III, q. 16). Although James of Viterbo used language\napt to suggest that he wanted to steer a middle course between Henry\nand Godfrey (Quodl. II, q. 7), his preferences clearly lay\nwith a position like that of Henry’s, as can be gathered from\nhis most detailed treatment of the question in Quodl. I, q. 7\n(see Dumont 2018a for a complete treatment of the issue in James). \nJames’ thesis in Quodl. I, q. 7 was that the will both\nmoves itself and is moved by another. An agent that is moved by\nanother can be said to be free as long as it also moves itself in some\nway. The human will is just such an agent: it is moved by itself; but\nit is also moved by another, namely by the object of willing outside\nthe soul, and it is moved by that same object insofar as it is\napprehended by the intellect. To explain how this was so, James used\nAquinas’ distinction between the specification of an act of will\n(the will’s willing this as opposed to that) and the exercise of\nthe act (the will’s actually willing this). The will formally\nmoves itself in regard to the exercise of its act; it is moved by the\nobject outside the soul in regard to the specification of its act; and\nit is moved by the intellect, or more precisely by the object as\napprehended by the intellect, both in regard to the specification and\nthe exercise of its act. James called the motion by which the will was\nspecified by the object as apprehended by the intellect\n“metaphorical” motion, as distinct from\n“proper” motion. Final causes were metaphorical movers in\nthis sense. James called the motion by which the will is moved to its\nexercise by the object as apprehended by the intellect\nefficient motion. This is prima facie a surprising\nmove given what we know about James’ theory of the soul as a\nself-mover. For even though James was keen to show that the will\ncannot, so to speak, “go it alone,” did not making the\nobject as understood by the intellect the efficient cause of the\nwill’s exercise to act risk tilting the causal balance too far\nin the direction of the intellect? But in fact if the intellect was an\nefficient cause, it wasn’t so in the usual sense of the word\n“efficient.” James claimed to follow Aristotle in\nMetaphysics in distinguishing two ways in which something\ncould be moved efficiently. The first was through direct efficient\ncausation; in this sense, only God was the efficient cause of the\nwill’s motion. The second sense was through “a certain\nconnection” that obtains between two things that are rooted in\nthe same subject. It is this second sense that is relevant for\nunderstanding how the intellect moves the will. As James understood\nthe matter, “because the will and the intellect are rooted and\nconnected in the same essence of the soul, it follows that when the\nsoul is in actuality in relation to the intellect, there arises\n(fit) in the soul a certain inclination such that it becomes\nin actuality in relation to the will, with the result that (the will)\nmoves itself.” It is, he concluded, “on account of that\ninclination that the intellect moves the will;” and the motion\nby which it does so can be termed a “rousing up”\n(excitatio) ( Quodl. I, q. 7, p. 104,\n849–855).  \nThus, despite what the language of “efficiency” might\nsuggest, James’ account of how the intellect moves the will is\nsimilar to his account of how the sense organ moves the power of sense\nand how the imagination moves the intellect: in all three cases the\nmotion is of the “excitatory” variety; the power itself as\nthe formal cause of its acts supplies the lion’s share of the\nvoluntary act’s causality. If anything, the will itself can be\nconsidered to be an efficient cause (in the first sense of the word),\nif only per accidens. This is because the will, like heavy\nobjects but unlike the intellect and the senses, belongs to the class\nof things that both move themselves formally and move others\nefficiently. Thus, just as a heavy object is formally self-moved as a\nresult of its heaviness but moves another efficiently inasmuch as it\ndivides the medium it traverses, so too the will is a self-mover that\nefficiently moves the intellect and the other faculties, and hence can\nbe said to move itself  per accidens (Quodl. I, q.\n7, p. 98, 633–640).  \nWhat is unclear is how any of the above makes the will’s\nvolitions free. After all, by James’ own admission, the senses\nand the intellect are also formal self-movers, and yet they are not\nfree. The difference is that whereas acts of sensation and\nintellection, given the self-motion of the senses and the intellect,\nwill necessarily follow upon the motions of the organs of sense and\nthe motion of the imagination, no act of willing according to James is\nnecessitated by the efficient causality (in James’ sense of the\nword) of the intellect. Thus, although any act of willing must be\npreceded by an act of the intellect, no act of the intellect\nnecessarily entails a particular act of willing. This makes the will\nthe only power of the soul that is essentially free, though some other\npowers may be called free “by participation,” insofar as\nthey are apt to be moved by the will. (Quodl. I, q. 7, p.\n107, 935–944)  \nLike Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas, James of Viterbo holds that\nthe moral virtues, considered as habits, i.e., virtuous dispositions\nor acts, are “connected.” In other words, he believes that\none cannot have one of the virtues without having the others as well.\nThe virtues he has in mind are what he calls the “purely”\nmoral virtues, that is, courage, justice, and temperance, which he\ndistinguishes from prudence, which is a partly moral, partly\nintellectual virtue. In his discussion in Quodl. II, q. 17\nJames begins by granting that the question is difficult and proceeds\nto expound Aristotle’s solution to it, which he will ultimately\nadopt. As James sees it, Aristotle proves in Nicomachean\nEthics VI the connection of the purely moral virtues by showing\ntheir necessary relation to prudence, and this is to show that just as\nmoral virtue cannot be had without prudence, prudence cannot be had\nwithout moral virtue. The connection of the purely moral virtues\nfollows from this: they are necessarily connected because (1) each is\nconnected to prudence and (2) prudence is connected to the virtues\n(Quodl. II, q. 17, p. 187, 436 – p. 188, 441). \nAlthough there has never been any doubt among medieval theologians\nthat man ought to love God more than he loves himself, medieval\ntheologians did disagree about whether man can fulfill this obligation\nby purely natural means or whether he requires grace in order to do\nso. The consensus in the thirteenth century, shared, among other\nauthors, by Thomas Aquinas, Giles of Rome, and Godfrey of Fontaines,\nwas that although perfect love of God is possible only through grace,\nman does have the natural capacity to love God more than himself (See\nOsborne 2005 for discussion of the topic in the thirteenth century,\nincluding in James of Viterbo). Many of these authors believed that\ngranting man such a capacity was necessary in order to safeguard the\nuniversally accepted principle that “grace perfects, not\ndestroys, nature”. For if man is naturally inclined to love\nhimself more than God and is made to love God more than himself only\nthrough grace, then that natural inclination is not so much perfected\nas replaced by a different one. Against these authors, James of\nViterbo in his Quodlibet II, question 20 famously defended\nthe view that man naturally loves himself more than God. Before\nstating James’ argument in support of this position, it is\nimportant to be attentive to the precise way in which he formulated\nthe question, as well as to how he understands the term\n“love” (diligere).  \nFirst, the question James raised in Quodl. II, q. 20, was not\n(a): “Does man naturally love God more than he loves\nhimself?” or (b): “Does man naturally love himself more\nthan God,” but rather (c): “Does man naturally love God\nmore than himself, or the converse (vel econverso)?”\nWhat (c), but not (a) or (b), rules out is that man can love himself\nand God equally. James did not think that this was so. He compared the\ncase of self-love vs. love of God to the distinction between natural\nand supernatural knowledge: “Natural knowledge starts from\ncreatures and proceeds thence to God; contrariwise, supernatural\nknowledge begins with God and proceeds thence to creatures.”\nSince the distinction between natural and supernatural knowledge is\nexhaustive and mutually exclusive, there is no other kind of\nknowledge, and hence none that would proceed “equally”\nfrom creatures and God. But for the comparison between knowledge and\nlove to hold, the conclusion that applies to the former must apply to\nthe latter, and that conclusion is that if man does not love God more\nthan himself, then he loves himself more than God; and conversely. \nSecond, following the practice of many scholastics, James\ndistinguished between two forms of love: the “love of\ndesire” or “love of covetousness” (amor\nconcupiscentiae), which he defined as the “love of some\ngood which we want for ourselves or for others,” and the love of\nfriendship (amor amicitiae), or the love of someone for their\nown sake. Although James believed that rational creatures love God in\nboth these ways, he was clear that the debate about whether or not man\nloves himself more than God or the converse concerned only the love of\nfriendship; the debate, then, was about whether man naturally loves\nhimself for his own sake more than he loves God for his own\nsake—which was the view James defended—or the converse.\n \nJames offered two arguments to support his position. The first was\nbased on the principle that the mode of natural love must be\ncommensurate with the mode of being and, hence, of the mode of being\none—since everything that is is one. Now a thing is one with\nitself by virtue of numerical identity, but it is one with something\nelse by virtue of a certain conformity. For instance, Socrates is one\nwith himself by virtue of his being Socrates, but he is one with Plato\nby virtue of the fact that both share the same form. But the being\nsomething has by virtue of numerical identity is “greater”\nthan the being it has by reason of something it shares with another.\nAnd given that the species of natural love follows the mode of being,\nit follows that it is more perfect to love oneself than to love\nanother (Quodl. II, q. 20, p. 206, 148 – p. 149, 165).\nThe second argument attempted to derive the same conclusion from the\nprinciple that “God’s love of charity elevates [human]\nnature’s” love of God ( Quodl. II, q. 20, p. 207,\n166–167). James reasoned that there was only one way in which\ncharity could elevate nature, namely by making it love God above all\nelse. But if this was so, it had to follow “that nature in\nitself cannot love God in this way (...). For if it could, it would\nnot need to be elevated by charity.” (Quodl. II, q. 20,\np. 207, 181–184). And for James to say that nature itself cannot\nlove God above all else was just to say that man naturally loves\nhimself above all else. QED. \nBut if charity elevated nature in this way, did it not\n“destroy” nature after all, by substituting for the\ninclination to love the self above all else the entirely different\ninclination to love God above all else? James’ answer was that\nit did not, since “through charity man loves himself no less\nthan before; he simply loves God more.” (Quodl. II, q.\n20, p. 210, 280–282). \nJames’ opposition to the consensus position on the issue of the\nlove of self vs. love of God did not go unnoticed. It elicited\nconsiderable criticism in the years following his death, from such\nauthors as Durand of Saint-Pourçain, Peter of Palude, and John\nof Naples (Jeschke 2009). \nAlthough James touches briefly on political issues in Quodl.\nI, q. 17 (see Kempshall, 1999, and Côté, 2012), his most\nextensive discussions occur in his celebrated De regimine\nchristiano (On Christian Government), written in 1302\nduring the conflict pitting Boniface VIII against the king of France\nPhilip IV (the Fair). De regimine christiano is often\ncompared in aim and content with Giles of Rome’s De\necclesiastica potestate (On Ecclesiastical Power), which\noffers one of the most extreme statements of pontifical supremacy in\nthe thirteenth century; indeed, in the words of De\nregimine’s editor, James’ goal is “to formulate\na theory of papal monarchy that is every bit as imposing and ambitious\nas that of [Giles]” (De regimine christiano: xxxiv).\nHowever, as scholars have also recognized, James shows a greater\nsensitivity to the distinction between nature and grace than Giles did\n(Arquillière 1926).  \nDe regimine christiano is divided into two parts. The first,\ndealing with the theory of the Church, is of little philosophical\ninterest, save for James’ enlisting of Aristotle to show that\nall human communities, including the Church, are rooted in the\n“natural inclination of mankind.” The second and longest\npart is devoted to defining the nature and extent of Christ’s\nand the pope’s power. One of James’ most characteristic\ndoctrines is found in Book II, chapter 7, where he turns to the\nquestion of whether temporal power must be “instituted” by\nspiritual power, in other words, whether it derives its legitimacy\nfrom the spiritual, or possesses a legitimacy of its own. James states\noutright that spiritual power does institute temporal power, but notes\nthat there have been two views in this regard. Some, e. g., the\nproponents of the so-called “dualist” position such as\nJohn Quidort of Paris, hold that the temporal power derives directly\nfrom God and thus in no way needs to be instituted by the spiritual,\nwhile others, such as Giles of Rome in De ecclesiastica\npotestate, contend that the temporal derives wholly from the\nspiritual and is devoid of any legitimacy whatsoever “unless it\nis united with spiritual power in the same person or instituted by the\nspiritual power” (De regimine christiano: 211). \nJames is dissatisfied with both positions and, as he so often does,\nendeavors to find a “middle way” between them. His\nsolution is to say that the “being” of the temporal\npower’s institution comes both from God—by way of\nman’s natural inclination—in “a material and\nincomplete sense,” and from the spiritual power by which it is\n“perfected and formed.” This is a very clever solution. On\nthe one hand, by rooting the temporal power in man’s natural\ninclination, albeit in the imperfect sense just mentioned, James was\nacknowledging the legitimacy of temporal rule independently of its\nconnection to the spiritual, thus “avoid[ing] the extreme and\nimplausible view of [Giles of Rome]” (Dyson 2009: xxix). On the\nother hand, making the natural origins of temporal power merely the\nincomplete matter of its being was a way of stressing its\nsubordination and inferiority to the spiritual order, in keeping with\nhis papalist convictions. Still, James’ very choice of analogies\nto illustrate the relationship between the spiritual and temporal\nrealms showed that his solution lay much closer to the theocratic\nposition espoused by Giles of Rome than his efforts to find a\n“middle way” would have us believe. Thus, comparing the\nspiritual power’s relation to the temporal in terms of the\nrelation of light to color, he explains that although “color has\nsomething of the nature of light, (…) it has such a feeble\nlight that, unless there is present a more excellent light by which it\nmay be formed, not in its own nature but in its power, it cannot move\nthe vision” (De regimine christiano: 211). In other\nwords, James is telling us that although temporal power does originate\nin man’s natural inclinations, it is ineffectual qua power\nunless it is informed by the spiritual.","contact.mail":"coteaj@uottawa.ca","contact.domain":"uottawa.ca"}]
