Feeling pain or dizziness,\nappearances of color or shape, and episodic thought are some widely\naccepted examples. Intentionality, on the other hand, has to do with\nthe directedness, aboutness, or reference of mental states—the\nfact that, for example, you think of or about\nsomething. Intentionality includes, and is sometimes seen as\nequivalent to, what is called “mental representation”.\n\n\nConsciousness and intentionality can seem to pervade much or all of\nmental life—perhaps they somehow account for what it is to have\na mind; at any rate they seem to be important, broad aspects of it.\nBut achieving a general understanding of either is an enormous\nchallenge. Part of this lies in figuring out how they are related. Are\nthey independent? Is one (or each) to be understood in terms of the\nother? How we address the issues to which these questions give rise\ncan have major implications for our views about mind, knowledge, and\nvalue.\n\n\nSections (1) and (2) offer introductory accounts of what is meant by\n“consciousness” and “intentionality”\nrespectively, highlighting relevant difficulties of interpretation.\nThen influential perspectives that have emerged in phenomenological\n(Section 3) and analytic (Section 4) philosophy are sketched so as to\nfacilitate recognition of some common, recurrent themes. These\nconcern, first: the question of whether either consciousness or\nintentionality is “internal to the subject” or instead\nessentially tied to environment—the theme of\ndetachability. The second concerns the issue of how (or\nwhether) to distinguish basic kinds of intentionality—e.g.,\nintellectual and sensory; conceptual and non-conceptual—and\nwhere to place consciousness with respect to such divisions: this is\nthe theme of basic forms. Third, there are questions\nabout how consciousness is related to self-consciousness—the\ntheme of reflexivity. Section (5) describes diverse\nperspectives on the consciousness-intentionality relationship engaging\nwith the themes of detachability and basic forms. Here separatist\nviews that divorce consciousness from intentionality are contrasted\nwith various intentionalist views that bind them together: externalist\nand non-externalist; reductive and non-reductive; restrictive and\ninclusive; reflexivist and non-reflexivist. This section links to two\nsupplementary discussions: one summarizes recent ways of arguing for\nintentionalism; the other considers how intentionalism figures in\nclassic phenomenological writings. Section (6) focuses on the\nrestrictive/inclusive contrast, and on issues regarding\n“cognitive phenomenology”. Section (7) returns to the\nreflexivist theme, and higher-order representationalist and\nself-representationalist accounts of consciousness—linking to a\nsupplementary discussion of consciousness of self. Section (8)\nconsiders how one’s view of the relationship of consciousness to\nintentionality might figure in one’s understanding of its place\nin the mind generally. Finally, Section (9) suggests some ways in\nwhich the issues of previous sections impinge on four broad areas of\nphilosophical interest: the nature and boundaries of mind and self;\nthe place of consciousness and intentionality in explanation; forms of\nknowledge and justification; and kinds and instances of value.\n\nThis entry includes the following supplementary documents linked into\nthe text, as described above. \nOn an understanding fairly common among philosophers, consciousness is\nthe feature that makes states count as experiences in a\ncertain sense: to be a conscious state is to be an experience. Widely\n(but not universally) accepted examples would include sensory states,\nimagery, episodic thought, and emotions of the sort we commonly enjoy.\nFor instance, when you see something red, it looks somehow to\nyou; when you hear a crash, it sounds somehow to you. Its\nlooking to you as it does, and its sounding to you as it does are\nexperiences in this sense. Likewise, when you close your eyes and\nvisualize a triangle, or when you feel pain, the visualizing and the\nfeeling are experiences. Similarly, you typically have experiences in\nthinking about how to answer a math problem, or what to say in an\nemail, in recalling where you parked the car, and in feeling anger,\nshame, relief, or elation. Experiences in this sense are said to have\nvarying “phenomenal character” for one who has them. Where\nfeelings are concerned, these would be the varying ways they feel to\nyou. However, not all experiences are classifiable as feelings. So\nmore broadly we might say that how you experience your own\nexperience—how it is “subjectively\nexperienced”—is its phenomenal (or its\n“subjective”) character. \nThe relevant notion is also often introduced by saying that there is,\nin a certain sense, always “something it is like” to be in\na given conscious state—something it’s like for\none who is in that state—and what it’s like for you to be\nin a state is what makes it a conscious state of the kind it is. The\nphenomenal character of an experience is what someone would inquire\nabout by asking, e.g., “What is it like to experience\norgasm?”—and it is what we speak of when we say that we\nknow what that is like, even if we cannot convey this to one\nwho doesn’t know. Coordinating this with previous\nremarks: how you experience your experiences (e.g., how your feelings\nfeel to you) is what it is like for you to have them. \nOur understanding of what is meant by “conscious” might\nalso be sharpened by contrasting conscious states with what we can\nreadily conceive of keeping from their company. A leaf’s fall\nfrom a tree branch, we will likely suppose, is not a conscious state\nof the leaf—an experience in the desired sense. Nor, for that\nmatter, is a person’s fall off a branch a conscious\nstate of that person. Rather, it is the feeling of falling\nthat is paradigmatically conscious, if anything is. Dreaming\nof falling would also be a conscious state in this sense. By contrast:\nwe can be said to sense (and so adjust) the position of our limbs when\ndreamlessly asleep. But this proprioception, we may suppose, is not\nconscious—provided it does not feel anyhow to us sleepers, as it\ncommonly does when we are awake. And in general we may understand a\ncontrast between the familiar sensory experience we have of stimuli\n(when, say, these smell or sound somehow to us), and other\ndiscriminatory responses to the same stimuli in the absence of any\nsuch experience—which we may still intelligibly describe as\nsensing or perceiving. (We can readily think of the sensing or\nperceiving attributed to plants and simple artifacts in this way.) \nThough the terms “experience” and “something\nit”s like for…’ are commonly used more or less in\nthe way just suggested to identify the notion of consciousness, it\nmust be said right off that their interpretation is subject to doubt\nand controversy that can affect one’s fundamental ideas about\nthe topics treated here. Anyone wanting to think carefully about\nconsciousness must face the fact that the basic terms of discussion\nare infused with complex disagreements from the start. \nTo see how the notion of experience might occasion such\ndisputes, consider: Christopher Hill (2009) acknowledges that you may\nsay that both being struck by a thought (e.g., that the email you just\nreceived is a scam), and feeling a sensation (say, a tingling in your\nfoot) are “experiences”. But he maintains this is\nambiguous: only the second is properly an experience, hence conscious,\nin the phenomenal sense. On this view, it seems episodic\nthought and sensation would count as univocally experiential, hence\nconscious, only if the former is identified with imagery. By contrast,\nCharles Siewert (2012a, 2014) holds thinking and sensing are indeed\nunivocally experiences, though we should take care to distinguish the\nrelevant sense from others (such as we might find, for example, in\nsaying “sea slugs learn from experience” and\n“Hurricane Sandy was quite an experience”). Meanwhile,\nAlex Byrne 2009 voices skepticism about the very idea of experience in\nthe “special philosophical” sense. \nWhen it comes to the “what it’s like” locution, Hill\nand Siewert would agree that we can speak of there being something\nit’s like to be in a state whose status as\nconscious, in the target sense, can hardly be taken for\ngranted. (As Jaegwon Kim 2011 points out, we can meaningfully ask\nsomeone what it was like for her to meet the President.) However,\nSiewert (2014) argues that we can surmount this difficulty, provided\nwe think of conscious states as ones there is\nnon-derivatively something it’s like for one to be in.\nBut Kim and Hill conclude that the locution is simply ill-suited to\ngive us a grip on the notion of consciousness, preferring terminology\nthat Siewert, in turn, finds suspicious; for them, conscious states\nare states with “qualia”, or “qualitative\ncharacter”. (After C.I. Lewis 1929 introduced the term\n“qualia” for what is given sensorily to the mind prior to\nconceptualization, it became common to use it to speak of\nconsciousness generally. See Crane (forthcoming) and Keely (2009) for\nilluminating histories.) \nOther problems of interpretation complicate recent discussion in ways\nvery germane to the present topic. As suggested above, the\nexperiential/what it’s like conception of consciousness is\nsometimes marked by the term “phenomenal”. The qualifier\nsuggests that there are other kinds of consciousness (or perhaps,\nother senses of “consciousness”). Indeed there\nare, at least, other ways of introducing notions of\nconsciousness. And these may appear to pick out features or senses\naltogether distinct from that just presented. But their relationship\nis controversial. For example, it is said that some (but not all) that\ngoes on in the mind is “accessible to consciousness”. This\nmay encourage the thought that consciousness itself is nothing but a\ncertain kind of access to or accessibility of information—for\ninstance, to a “speech center” responsible for generating\n“direct verbal reports” of the contents of one’s\nstates of mind—as in Daniel Dennett’s early (1969)\ntheorizing about consciousness. And Ned Block (1995, 2001, 2002) has\nproposed that, on one understanding of “conscious”, (which\nhe finds at work in psychological theories) a conscious state is just\na “representation poised” (or as he later put it,\n“broadcast”) “for free use in reasoning and other\ndirect ‘rational’ control of action (including\nreporting)”. Block labels consciousness in this sense access\nconsciousness. (Examples of theories he sees as employing this\nnotion include Baars 1997 and Dennett 1978, 1991.) \nBut what is the relationship between various kinds of information\naccess and consciousness in the phenomenal, experiential sense? Block\ndistinguishes the notions of phenomenal and access consciousness,\narguing that a mental representation’s being poised or broadcast\nfor use in reasoning and rational control of action is neither\nconceptually necessary nor sufficient for the state’s being\nphenomenally conscious. Similarly he distinguishes phenomenal\nconsciousness from what he calls “monitoring\nconsciousness”—where this has to do with one’s\ncapacity to represent one’s mind’s to oneself; to have,\nfor example, thoughts about one’s own thoughts, feelings, or\ndesires. One need not take Block’s notions of phenomenal,\naccess, and monitoring consciousness to reflect clear, definite\ndistinctions already contained in our pre-theoretical use of the term\n“conscious”. Block himself suggests that (on the contrary)\nour initial, ordinary concept of consciousness is too confused (too\n“mongrel”) even to count as ambiguous. Thus in\narticulating an interpretation of the term adequate to frame\ntheoretical issues, we cannot simply describe how it is currently\nemployed (Block 1995, 2002). \nThough Block’s proposed threefold distinction has proven\ninfluential, some would balk at proceeding on its basis. John Searle,\nfor example, would recognize phenomenal consciousness, but deny\nBlock’s other two candidates are proper senses of\n“conscious” at all (Searle 1992). The dispute here may\nseem no more than terminological. However, Hill 2009 doubts there is a\nclear sense in which the information in all the states theorists want\nto count as conscious actually is continually being broadcast to some\ncontrol faculty. And this is to doubt the reality of access\nconsciousness, as often understood. The reality of the forms of\nmonitoring consciousness that figure in contemporary theories (such as\n“inner sense”) may also be doubted (Dretske 1995; Siewert\n1998, 2012b). Finally, some raise doubts that there is a properly\nphenomenal sense we can rightly apply to ourselves and\ndistinguish from the other two (see Dennett 1988, 1991 and Rey 1997).\nSo it seems the issues here are not trivially terminological. This is\nevident also when we consider the idea that while phenomenal\nconsciousness is real, and our notion of this may be distinguishable\nfrom those of access or monitoring, a proper theory of these latter\ntwo explains what consciousness is—what it consists in.\nSo, what it is for one to have a phenomenally conscious visual\nexperience of a color or shape, for example, is just for one to have a\nvisual representation of a certain (potentially unconscious) type that\nis poised to affect belief (Tye 1995, 2002), or that furnishes\ninformation to a short term memory store with a special role in\nbehavioral control (Prinz 2012). Or it is to have the right sort of\n“higher-order representation” of a visual state (Armstrong\n1968; Rosenthal 2002b; Carruthers 2000, 2004; Lycan 1995, 2004).\nHowever, for some (Siewert 1998, 2010) recognizing nothing but access\nor monitoring in the manner of such theories amounts to denying the\nreality of phenomenal consciousness. These are evidently not just\ndisputes about words; they concern what there is to talk about. \nFor the purposes of this survey we will assume there is a reasonable\ninterpretation of the remarks in the first three paragraphs of this\nsection under which they pick out something real for us to call\n“consciousness”, even if this term may be legitimately\ninterpreted in other ways. But we should acknowledge it is open to\nquestion whether, when the philosophers here under discussion use the\nterm “conscious”, its cognates and their standard\ntranslations, they are all talking about consciousness in that sense.\nAnd we will leave open as much as possible how precisely to relate it\nto notions such as rational control, higher-order\nrepresentation, and conceptual activity—disputed\nissues important to determining its relationship to intentionality, to\nbe encountered below in various guises. \nThe term “conscious” is not esoteric. But, as we’ve\nseen, its use is not readily characterized in a manner that provides\nsome coherent, impartial framework for disciplined investigation. This\nis part of why theorizing about consciousness is so hard. Where the\nterm “intentionality” is concerned, we also face confusing\nand contentious usage. But here the problem lies partly in the fact\nthat the relevant use is definitely not that found in common\nspeech employing cognate terms (as when we speak of doing something\nintentionally). In any case, here too we must recognize basic problems\nof interpretation that affect substantive issues, highly pertinent to\nthe present discussion. \nOne way philosophers have often explained what they mean by\n“intentionality” is this: it is that aspect of mental\nstates or events that consists in their being of or\nabout things, as pertains to the questions, “What are\nyou thinking of?” and “What are you thinking about?”\nIntentionality is the aboutness or directedness or\nreference of mind (or states of mind) to things, objects,\nstates of affairs, events. So if you are thinking about San Francisco,\nor about the cost of living there, or about your meeting someone at\nUnion Square—your mind, your thinking, is directed toward San\nFrancisco, or the cost of living, or the meeting in Union Square. This\n“directedness” conception of intentionality plays a\nprominent role in the philosophy of Franz Brentano and those whose\nviews developed, directly or indirectly, in response to his (to be\ndiscussed in Section 3). \nBut what positive features distinguish the relevant\nintentionality-marking senses of these words (“about”,\n“of”, “directed”) from those found in:\n“the cat is wandering about the room”; “she\nis a person of integrity”; “the river”s\ncourse was directed towards the fields’? As for talk of\nintentionality as reference, just how are we to distinguish\nthe way thoughts refer from the way names and\ndescriptions do? And how does this notion of intentionality\napply to the senses? When we see or touch something, does our mind\nalso “refer” to what we see or touch, in the same way as\ndoes thought? What unifies the notion of intentionality and governs\nits range of application? \nOne way of bringing the senses under the “intentionality”\numbrella, while suggesting what’s special about mental\ndirectedness, focuses on phenomena of perceptual constancy. This plays\nan important role in the conception of intentionality in Edmund\nHusserl’s phenomenology. It also figures, in a rather different\nway, in Tyler Burge’s 2010 conception of what it is for the\nsenses to represent objects. We perceive things as constant\nwith respect to some determinable (such as shape, color, or size),\nthrough fluctuation in (a) the subjective experience of them\nwith respect to this determinable, and (b) the corresponding pattern\nof proximal (e.g., retinal) stimulation from them.\nHusserl takes the (a) type constancy-though-flux to show perceptual\nexperience is directed at or refers to objects that go beyond (or\n“transcend”) it, while Burge takes the (b) sort of\nconstancy to show perceptual states are representations of an\nobjective realm. \nHowever, these approaches seem tailored to the senses, and one will\nwonder how to apply “intentionality” univocally to both\nsense perception and thought. One peculiarity that may\nencompass the directedness/aboutness/of-ness/reference of both sense\nexperience and thought (while covering desire and imagination as\nwell): they all may seemingly relate (“purport to point”)\nto objects that do not exist. Thoughts, unlike roads, can\ndirect you to a city that is not there. One can think about a meeting\nthat has not occurred and never will; one can think of Shangri La, or\nEl Dorado, or the New Jerusalem; one may imagine their shining\nstreets, their total lack of poverty, or their citizens’\npeculiar garb; one may long to live in them. Likewise, when one\nhallucinates, one can experience what is not there to be seen. Maybe\nthis suggests a unifying way to identify the relevant sort of\ndirectedness. \nBut this invites new perplexities. Are we to say (with apparent\nincoherence) that there are objects we think of that\ndon’t exist? And what does it mean to say that, when a\nstate of mind is in fact directed toward something that does\nexist, that state nevertheless could be directed toward\nsomething that does not exist? For instance, should we agree\nthat there is some experiential “common factor” in\nperception and hallucination? This has been much disputed by\n“disjunctivist” philosophers of perception, who would\ninsist that perceptual experience, in the non-hallucinatory\n“good” case, is fundamentally\nrelational. When there is a snake you see, your experience is\na relation between you and that snake, and could not occur at\nall without it—any more than could stepping on it. This\nis not so if you experience a hallucination of a snake, even\nwhen you cannot subjectively discriminate such experience from the\n“good” kind. If this is right, then it is hard to see how\nwe could get a notion of intentionality to cover both cases, as long\nas this is understood as some kind of reference to what might not\nexist. It can well be fundamental to the nature of mind that its\nstates can be of or about things or “point beyond\nthemselves”. But getting a satisfactory grasp of such mental\npointing in all its generality presents theoretical challenges. \nA second approach to intentionality may start from the idea that the\npotential reference to the non-existent just discussed is closely\nassociated with the potential for falsehood, error, inaccuracy,\nillusion, hallucination, and dissatisfaction. What makes it possible\nto believe (or even just suppose) something about Shangri La is that\none can falsely believe (or suppose) that something exists. What makes\nit possible to seem to see or hear what is not there is that\none’s experience may in various ways be inaccurate, or\nnonveridical. What makes it possible for one’s desires and\nintentions to be directed toward what does not and never will exist is\nthat one’s desires and intentions can be unfulfilled. And each\nof these negative assessments contrasts with a positive one: truth,\naccuracy, veridicality, and fulfillment. This suggests another general\nstrategy for gaining a theoretical hold on intentionality, employing a\nnotion of satisfaction, stretched to encompass susceptibility\nto each of these forms of assessment. On John Searle’s (1983)\nconception, intentional states are states having “conditions of\nsatisfaction”. For a belief, they are the conditions\nunder which it is true; for sense-experience, they the\nconditions under which it is veridical; for an\nintention the conditions under which it is fulfilled or\ncarried out. \nA “conditions of satisfaction” approach to intentionality\nmay seem to furnish an alternative to talk of directedness to objects.\nBut it is not clear that it can get us around its problems. For\ninstance, what are we to say where thoughts are expressed using names\nof nonexistent deities or fictional characters? Will we do away with a\ntroublesome directedness to the nonexistent by saying that the\nthoughts that Zeus is Poseidon’s brother, and that Hamlet is a\nprince, are just false? This is problematic. Moreover, how will we\nstate the conditions of satisfaction of such thoughts? Will this not\nalso involve an apparent reference to the nonexistent? (For\ndiscussion of these issues, see Thomasson 1999 and Crane 2013.) And\nquestions about the proper understanding of the relationship among\nperception, illusion and hallucination remain. \nA third important way to conceive of intentionality, one particularly\ncentral to the analytic tradition derived from the study of Frege and\nRussell (see Section 4), is based on the notion of mental (or\nintentional) content. Often it is assumed: to have\nintentionality is to have content. But what is content? Here appeal is\nsometimes made to the idea of representation: a state has\ncontent insofar as it “represents something to be a certain\nway”, or else “tells” or “says” to one\nsomething about how the world is—where the notion of\nrepresenting and the saying/telling metaphor are assumed to be\nintuitively clear enough to get things started. \nAnother way to see what is meant by “content” is to think\nof this as what is reported when answering the question, “What\ndoes she think?” by something of the form, “She thinks\nthat p”. And one might regard the content of thought as\nwhat two people share, when what they think is the\nsame (and they think the same thought)—and it’s what\ndiffers when what they think is different. Analogous remarks\napply to belief and intention. (Though it is not quite as clear that\nwhen we speak of what one perceives, this is to be understood\nin just the same way.) Content is also what may vary independently of\nthe “psychological modes” of states of mind in ways\nillustrated by saying: Believing that I’ll soon be bald\nand fearing that I’ll soon be bald differ in\nmode, but share the content: that I’ll soon be\nbald, while each differ in content from believing and\nfearing that I’ll soon be dead. (One may also wish to\ntreat perception as a “mode” alongside believing,\nfearing, etc.) \nDifferences in the content of mental states are also commonly thought\nto be revealed by certain logical features of sentences we use to\nreport them. Reports of thoughts or beliefs and other intentional\nstates (like intention, hope, fear) often do not seem to retain their\ntruth value when co-extensive expressions are substituted in\n“that-clauses”. For example: “Barack Obama”\nand “the 44th president of the United States”\nare co-extensive or co-referential. And if it’s true that Barack\nObama was born in Hawai‘i, it’s true that the 44th U.S\nPresident was. Even so, Sam can think that Barack Obama was\nborn in Hawai‘i without thinking that the 44th U.S\nPresident was. It seems plausible that this “failure of\nsubstitutivity” reflects the fact that just what Sam\nmight be said to think—the “contents” of his\nthoughts—differ in such a case. Or, as it is sometimes said,\nintentional states relate to the conditions that would satisfy them,\nor to what they are about, only “under some aspects” and\nnot others—and differences in the “aspect under\nwhich” are differences in content. (Searle speaks here\nof the “aspectual shape” of intentional states.) \nThis raises the question of just how a “possession of\ncontent” conception of intentionality may be coordinated with\nthe conditions of satisfaction conception. It is sometimes assumed\nthat if states of mind contrast in respect of their\nsatisfaction (say, one is true and the other false), they\ndiffer in content. And if one says what the intentional\ncontent of a state of mind is, one says much or perhaps all\nof what conditions must be met if it is to be\nsatisfied—what its conditions of truth, or veridicality, or\nfulfillment, are. But one might also hold that content only determines\nsatisfaction conditions relative to context. This seems especially\nplausible when we consider thoughts expressed with indexicals or\ndemonstratives. (When I think, on multiple occasions, of multiple\nobjects, this is F, what makes what I think true may differ\nwith context, but what I think of each this (and how\nI think of it) on each such occasion may be just the same.) And we may\nallow that states differing “aspectually” can in some\nsense have the same conditions of satisfaction. This, and related\nissues, have given rise to diverse interpretations of the notion of\ncontent, and the term has often been alleged to be ambiguous or in\nneed of subtle theoretical refinement. Consider, inter alia:\nEdward Zalta’s 1988 distinction between cognitive and objective\ncontent; Jerry Fodor’s (1991) defense of a distinction between\nnarrow and wide content; John Perry’s (2001) distinction between\nreflexive and subject-matter content); and David Chalmers’\n(1996, 2010) two-dimensional conception of content. \nTalk of content clearly has some intuitive basis. We can talk about\nwhat someone thinks (believes, intends, doubts, etc.) and\nregard this “what” as remaining the same on multiple\ncases, with multiple subjects: this we may call the content of thought\n(belief, intention, doubt). But once we raise questions about just\nwhat this repeatable “what is thought” amounts to, and\nwhat makes it the same or different, “content” becomes a\nhighly contentious theoretical term. It can be unclear what\nassumptions lie behind its use by various philosophers, and whether\nthey have the same sort of thing in mind. \nEach of the gates of entry into the topic of intentionality identified\nabove—directedness; conditions of satisfaction;\ncontent—arguably opens onto a unitary phenomenon. And some of\nthe connections among them have been hinted at. But there is a fair\namount of fragmentation in the conceptions of intentionality in the\nfield, and the complexities just mentioned cannot be ignored. Perhaps\nthe term “intentionality” only roughly indicates an area\nof inquiry, covering a variety of interestingly (but uncertainly)\ninterrelated phenomena of thought, belief, desire, imagination,\nperception, and symbol use. Here, in any case, we leave much open\nabout how to interpret the notion, in the interests of conducting a\nbroadly inclusive survey that aims to illuminate different ways in\nwhich what “intentionality” is used to pick out has been\nrelated to consciousness. In the interests of such ecumenical breadth,\nit will be useful to conduct an overview of the near history of\nthinking about intentionality, covering important ideas arising both\nin the phenomenological tradition from the late 19th to\nmid-20th century, and in the area of research that in the\nlast half century or so has come to be known as philosophy of\nmind. \nIn telling this story, we have to acknowledge (and traverse) the\ndivide in twentieth century western philosophy between so-called\n“analytic” and “continental” traditions. This\ndistinction is misleading however, partly because the tendency to\ncategorize phenomenologists en masse as “continental”\nwrongly suggests they are all somehow more like all others placed in\nthat class than they are like anyone in the (also wildly\nheterogeneous) group of “analytic philosophers”.\nNevertheless, the history of influence and dialogue linking figures in\nthe phenomenological movement with one another, and that unifying the\nanalytic tradition, yield largely distinct narratives. This, together\nwith the differences in approach, vocabulary, and background\nassumptions, make some disjoint treatment of the two inevitable.\nHowever, it seems fitting to try to encompass both in a single\narticle. For, as will be seen, there are significant thematic\ncommonalities across the two histories, and the differences and\nsimilarities in how these themes are treated in each may be revealing\nand intellectually stimulating.  \nA history of ideas about consciousness and intentionality could easily\ntake us further into the past than this article can cover. A\nconvenient, relatively recent starting point would be in the\nphilosophy of Franz Brentano. He more than any other single thinker is\nresponsible for keeping the term “intentional” alive in\nphilosophical discussions of the last century and a half or so, with\nsomething like its current use, and was much concerned with its\nrelationship to consciousness (Brentano [1874] 1973). Brentano himself\nwas quite aware of the deep historical background to his notion of\nintentionality: he looked back through scholastic discussions (crucial\nto the development of Descartes’ immensely influential theory of\nideas), and ultimately to Aristotle for his theme of intentionality\n(Brentano [1867] 1977). One may well go further back, to Plato’s\ndiscussion (in the Sophist, and the Theaetetus) of\ndifficulties in making sense of false belief, and yet further still,\nto the dawn of Western Philosophy, and Parmenides’ attempt to\ndraw enormous consequences from allegedly finding that it is not\npossible to think or speak of what is not. In this section, we will\nreview how Brentano conceived of intentionality and consciousness, and\ntheir relationship, and how that conception was transformed in the\nthought of his student Husserl—whose name is that most strongly\nassociated with the phenomenological movement—and in the\nwritings of some of those he strongly influenced. This will allow us\nto introduce the three themes mentioned in the\nintroduction—detachability, basic forms, and\nreflexivity—by which one might unify the disparate discussions\nof consciousness and intentionality arising over roughly the last\ncentury. \nFor Brentano, initially at least, what seems crucial to intentionality\nis the mind’s capacity to refer or be directed to objects that\nmay exist only in mind—what he called “mental or\nintentional inexistence”. In a famous passage, he introduces the\nnotion this way. \nEvery mental phenomenon is characterized by what the Scholastics of\nthe Middle Ages called the intentional (or mental) inexistence of an\nobject, and what we might call, though not wholly unambiguously,\nreference [or relation] to a content, direction toward an object\n(which is not to be understood as a reality), or immanent objectivity.\nEvery mental phenomenon includes something as object within itself,\nalthough they do not all do so in the same way. In presentation\nsomething is presented, in judgment something is affirmed or denied,\nin love loved, in hate hated, in desire desired and so on. (Brentano\n[1874] 1973: 88) \nIt is not straightforward just what Brentano meant by saying mental\nphenomena include objects within themselves, or that an immanent\nobject of mentation is not assumed to be “a reality”. He\ncomplained of being misunderstood by his students, and he revised his\nposition as his thought developed. Experts continue to differ\nconsiderably over how to interpret his view. But clearly his\nconception of intentionality, and arguably that of the whole\nphenomenological tradition he influenced, is dominated by the first\nstrand of thought mentioned in Section 2—intentionality as\ndirectedness towards or reference to an object—and\nwhatever difficulties that brings in train. \nMore clearly worked out than Brentano’s early, general notion of\nintentionality are his views about what he took to be its most basic\nforms (alluded to in the quote above). Brentano’s philosophical\nproject of giving a typology of intentional states, their constituents\nand interdependencies—what he called “descriptive\npsychology”—was ambitiously aimed at providing a framework\nfor experimental inquiries into causal psychological laws, as well as\nfor logic (including theory of knowledge), aesthetics, and ethics. \nAll intentionality, he holds, involves a presentation\n(Vorstellung) (in some sense, an appearance) of an\nobject (including mere imaginings or conceivings of objects). To this\nneutral mere appearance of an object one may then add a committal\nattitude towards it—of either judgment or “emotion”\n(Gemüt)—each of which takes positive and negative\nforms. In judgment: one either affirms (accepts) or denies (rejects)\nthe presented object. In Gemüt, one either\nlikes (loves or values) or dislikes (hates or\ndisvalues) it. The mere affirmation (or liking) of an object presented\ndoes not require categorizing it under a general concept, grouping it\ntogether with like instances, or anything on the order of Kantian\n“synthesis”. \nHow did Brentano relate consciousness to intentionality? He did so by\nholding first, that every mental phenomenon is “of an\nobject” in the intentional sense. Secondly, he held that every\nmental act is, in fact, conscious, which he took to imply there is an\nintentional consciousness of it, which in turn he construed\nas a kind of “inner perception”—every conscious\nmental act is itself presented, and judged (accepted) as presented.\nBrentano did not consider it absurd to suppose there are\nunconscious (for him, unperceived) mental acts. But\nhe found inadequate such reasons as had been offered in his time to\nposit their occurrence. On his view, wherever this is proposed on the\ngrounds of explanatory usefulness, nonmentalistic (e.g.,\nphysiological) explanations would do as well. In this connection, he\nalso took seriously the worry that if we hold (as he does) that all\nmental acts are conscious, and all conscious acts are objects of\nconsciousness, an infinite regress would erupt. But he thought his\ntheory could handle the problem: the key was to see that, since inner\nperception is not separate from the object it makes conscious, no\nregress gets started. \nBrentano’s lectures in Vienna attracted and inspired an\nimpressive, diverse group of central European intellectuals in the\n1870s. Of these, it was Husserl who was to have the widest\nphilosophical impact on the European Continent in the twentieth\ncentury, largely because of his influence on thinkers inspired by his\nphenomenology to explore existentialist themes—Martin Heidegger,\nJean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Though these are the\nheirs of Brentano and Husserl on which we will focus here, a full\ntreatment of phenomenological ideas about intentionality and\nconsciousness would need to cast its net much more broadly, covering\nfigures such as: Aron Gurwitsch, Roman Ingarden, Anton Marty, Alexius\nMeinong, Adolph Reinach, Max Scheler, Edith Stein, Carl Stumpf and\nKasimir Twardowski. \nHusserl ([1900] 1970) adopted Brentano’s concern with\nunderstanding, “descriptively”, from the subject’s\npoint of view, how experience is object-directed, reinterpreting\nBrentano’s “descriptive psychology” as\n“phenomenology”, and giving this a similar foundational\nrole in philosophy. However, Husserl’s basic conceptions of both\nintentionality and of consciousness were significantly shaped by his\ncriticisms of Brentano’s. First, consider his response to\nBrentano on intentionality. One of Husserl’s principal points of\ndeparture in his early treatment of intentionality (in the Logical\nInvestigations [1900] 1970, V §§ 9–11, 14) was\ncriticism of what he—controversially—took to be\nBrentano’s notion of the “mental inexistence” of the\nobjects of thought and perception. Husserl thought it a fundamental\nerror to suppose that the object (the intentional object) of a\nthought, judgment, desire, etc. is something with a special kind of\nbeing in the mind of the thinker, judger, or desirer. For we should\nrecognize that objects of one’s mental acts of thinking,\njudging, etc. often are or can be ordinary objects that\n“transcend”, and enjoy some sort of independence from the\nacts (states of mind) that are directed towards them (that\n“intend” them, in Husserl’s terms). At least if I am\nnot hallucinating, the object of my visual experience is not something\nimmanent to my mind, whose existence comes and goes with the\nexperience—but something (a box, for example) that goes beyond\nor transcends any (necessarily perspectival) experience I may have of\nit, as relative position, lighting, or attention alters. This\nconception of the “objective reference” of sense\nexperience is grounded in a phenomenology of perceptual constancy,\nmentioned earlier in comparison with Burge. \nBut how about a case in which there is no transcendent object targeted\nby one’s experience, and it merely seems as if there is one, as\npresumably can occur in hallucination? Here we should say, on\nHusserl’s view, not that there is an object of reference\nexisting in one’s mind, but that the object intended simply does\nnot exist. This does not do away with the directedness of such\nexperience, since it is still true to say one’s experience is\nof something (a snake, a dagger), even though there exists no\nsnake or dagger one then sees—much as it may be true to say one\nis thinking of a golden mountain, or Zeus, though there\nexists no such mountain or god to think of. For (according to the\nLogical Investigations V §§ 16–17,\n20) it is sufficient to make such “conscious of”\nstatements true that the experience have some\n“matter”—where the matter of a mental act\ncorresponds to what, through it, something is interpreted as.\nThis factor—matter as “interpretive sense”—may\nvary among acts with the same object (in Husserl’s example, one\nmay think of one and the same object (the Kaiser) either as the\ngrandson of Queen Victoria or as the son of Friedrich III). It also\nmay vary independently of what he called\n“act-quality”—of whether, e.g., one judges,\nor doubts, or wonders, or hopes, or imagines, or perceives. Husserl\nheld that every intentional act must have both matter and quality.\nPost-Investigations, he came to re-interpret these notions in\nterms of what he called (in Ideas [1913] 1983) the\n“noema” that can be common to distinct particular acts.\nBut this much of the basic picture seems to have survived: intentional\ndirectedness is understood not as a directedness to special (“in\nmind”) objects, but rather as the possession by mental acts of\nmatter/quality (or later, noematic) structure. This can be considered\na version of the content conception of intentionality described in\nSection 2, insofar as Husserl would accept that, in some sense, the\nmatter of an act (later, its “noematic sense”) is the same\nas its content, that content goes with differences in\n“aspect”, and that acts can have content even when there\nexists no object to which they refer. \nHowever, to say only this much leaves basic questions about\nHusserl’s view unsettled. One concerns whether or in what sense\nperceptual experience ever constitutes a relation to the\nobject experienced. Here we encounter the first of the three big\nthemes announced at the outset: the question of the\n“detachability” of either consciousness or intentionality\nfrom “external” “worldly” objects. In what\nway, if any, is the conscious subject with its intentionality in\nessence intelligible apart from objects in the world it inhabits? \nClearly Husserl thought that a hallucination would still be\nintentional, though there exists no object of the experience (mentally\nimmanent or otherwise) to which it relates the subject. Still, this\nleaves open whether, for Husserl, in non-hallucinatory\ncases—when there really is a snake you see—the\nmatter/noematic sense (thus content) of the experience properly\ncontains the experience-transcending object the experience is of, so\nthat the experience is essentially a relation to (e.g.,) this very\nwrithing, flesh-and-blood creature that can strike and bite you. On\nthis interpretation, if instead you have a subjectively\nindistinguishable snake-hallucination, you may have what is in\nother respects the same noema, minus the snake constituent.\nAlternatively, we may interpret Husserl to hold that the experience\nitself, along with its entire matter or noematic sense, is always\nessentially detachable from whatever “external object” it\nis of. (For discussion, see Crowell 2013; Drummond 1990; A.D.\nSmith 2008; D.W. Smith 2007; Zahavi 2003.) \nInterpretations of Husserl diverge, partly due to difficulties in\nbeing clear about how to interpret his shift from the\n“quality/matter” to the “noema” terminology,\nhis immanent/transcendent contrast, and a closely associated aspect of\nhis philosophy—one to which he attached great\nimportance—his method of “transcendental-phenomenological\nreduction”. Husserl claimed it is possible (and, indeed,\nessential to the practice of phenomenology as an a priori\ndiscipline, distinct from psychology) that one investigate\nconsciousness in a way that withholds certain commitments concerning\nspatio-temporal particulars. Husserl held that what makes the relevant\nsuspension of commitment possible is that, given the essentially\nperspectival (in his terms, the evidentially incomplete or\n“inadequate”) nature of perceptual experience of an\nobject, in no case does anything subjectively evident about the actual\ncourse of your experience of an F as such completely rule out\nthe possibility that there was in fact no transcendent object, then\nexperienced as an F. (Ideas [1913] 1983 §§\n42–50.) On one interpretation of his methodological\n“bracketing”, Husserl infers that intentional experience\nis always in essence detachable from any such worldly\n(“external”) objects to which it is in fact directed.  \nHowever, on other, “externalist” –or perhaps better,\n“relationalist”—interpretations, Husserl\ndidn’t deny experience is (sometimes) essentially a relation to\nexperience-transcending objects, or that its contents include these as\nconstituents. The methodological aim is just to restrict the scope of\nconcern with these objects (and hence the relevant evidence) proper to\nphenomenology: one considers them specifically only as\nintended (i.e., as interpreted) in whatever kind of experience is\nunder investigation. To this end it is unnecessary to embrace an\nontology of experiences that says they could always remain essentially\nthe same, even when detached from such objects altogether. \nAnother complication concerns just how Husserl would view the general\nrelationship between content in his sense (either act-matter or\nnoematic sense) and such semantic correlates of ordinary language\nsentences—“propositions”—that some would\nidentify with the contents of states of mind reported in them.\nRelevant here are Husserl’s discussions in Logical\nInvestigation VI of the relationship between the intentionality\nof perception and judgment. Husserl maintains that perception allows\nus to express judgments with demonstratives like “this”\n(what he called “essentially occasional” terms) via\nnon-conceptual, “non-attributive” senses, and that\nexperiencing features in things perceived (e.g., experiencing\nthe color or form in an object), is distinct from and underlies our\ncapacity to predicate the relevant features to them. (See\nMulligan 1995 and Hopp 2011 for discussion of relevant issues.)\nImportant here too is Husserl’s discussion in Experience and\nJudgment [1939] 1973 of what he called\n“pre-predicative” experience. Husserl holds that the sort\nof judgments we express in ordinary and scientific language are\nfounded on the intentionality of pre-predicative experience, and that\nit is crucial to clarify the way in which such experience underlies\njudgment. While Husserl rejected Brentano’s general conception\nof judgment as the non-predicative affirmation of objects presented,\nhe endorsed the related idea that there is a form of intentionality,\nfound in perception, distinct from—and making\npossible—that in which we bring objects under general concepts.\nHere we encounter in Husserl the second of the initially announced\nthemes—that of basic forms of consciousness or\nintentionality. \nIt is disputed how significantly the most well-known philosophers\nstrongly influenced by their study of Husserl—Heidegger, Sartre,\nand Merleau-Ponty—depart from him in their views. Partly this is\ndue to interpretive difficulties just mentioned (regarding the\ndetachability of experience from experience-transcending objects, and\nthe basic forms of intentionality or content). First, regarding\nrelationality and reduction: on the views of Heidegger ([1927] 1962,\n1982, 1985) and Merleau-Ponty ([1945] 2012) at least, intentionality\n(or as Heidegger prefers,\nVerhaltung—“comportment”) essentially\ninvolves an engagement with the world that cannot be cancelled by any\nabstention from judgment. If Husserl’s reduction denies this,\nthen their responses to Husserl involve a significant break with him.\nBut as we’ve seen, interpretation of the reduction is\ncontroversial. An additional complication comes when we try to\nconsider exactly how attitudes towards consciousness figure\ninto all this. If, as one interpretive approach suggests, Husserl\nholds consciousness (or rather, experience of the sort ordinarily\ninvolved in perceptual constancy) is intrinsically both relational and\nintentional, then the sort of consciousness we enjoy will be\nno more detachable in nature from its transcendent objects than is our\nintentionality. What Heidegger would have to say to this will\ndepend partly on what exactly we make of his abandoning the\nterminology of consciousness for his distinctive vocabulary of\n“showing” and “unconcealment/discovery”. Might\nwe regard him as still speaking of consciousness, but only by other,\nallegedly less theory-burdened names? Or should we interpret Heidegger\n(in line with Crowell 2013) as maintaining (against Husserl) that\nconsciousness by itself (even of the ordinary sort we enjoy) is\ninsufficient for comportment/intentionality? How we decide to view\nthis will undoubtedly be entangled with how we ourselves understand\n“consciousness”. \nSartre’s ([1943] 1956) conception of consciousness as nothing\napart from its objects can also be interpreted as a relationalist view\n(see McCollough 1994). And in Merleau-Ponty at least, we clearly have\na version of what has since come to be known as\n“disjunctivism” regarding perceptual experience: for him\nthe visual consciousness of an ashtray (his example) is either\ngenuinely seeing the ashtray—or else (in illusory and\nhallucinatory cases) merely like seeing an ashtray. In the\nfirst case there is no concrete experience that would remain once the\nashtray is subtracted in thought, so as to constitute an ashtray\nhallucination. On Merleau-Ponty’s account, ordinarily, when you\nsee an ashtray (a chair, a tree, etc.), your visual experience is both\nintentional and object-dependent. Our understanding of defective,\nillusory and hallucinatory cases rests on an analogy with ordinary\ncases of visual consciousness understood in an essentially relational\nmanner. This does not keep him from agreeing with Husserl that, given\nthe perspectivalness of perception, there’s a sense in which one\ncan never, in a particular case, rule out the possibility that\none’s experience wasn’t relational after all. But this\ndoesn’t make it intelligible that all one’s\nexperience is non-relational, or make rational a global Cartesian\ndoubt that it ever reveals the world. (Merleau-Ponty [1945] 2012:\n308–311, 359–360, 393–396) \nWhen it comes to the question of whether ordinary perception and\naction involve a kind of intentionality distinct from that of\nconceptual judgment, it seems fair to say this about Heidegger and\nMerleau-Ponty. They took up the theme of an intentionality that is\ndistinct from and makes possible the kind involved in judgments that\nposit and predicate properties of objects, and they gave this, each in\nhis own way, a strongly pragmatic cast. Heidegger describes a\ntype of understanding of entities in which they “show\nthemselves” or are “discovered” as\n“ready-to-hand” or “available”\n(zuhanden)—in which they are understood in their\nfunctionality (as hammers, as doors, as pens, etc.) relative to our\naims: we understand them in using them for\nsomething. This is a kind of directedness that belongs to our everyday\npractical engagement with our surroundings. He sees this as distinct\nfrom, and making possible an understanding of entities in which they\nshow themselves as “present-at-hand” or (merely)\n“occurrent” (vorhanden)—as they do when we\nunderstand them in a more detached or theoretical way, merely as\nobjects that possess certain properties (Heidegger [1927] 1962, 1982).\n(For a general account of Heidegger’s taxonomy of understanding,\nsensitive to recent interpretive controversies, see Wrathall 2013a.)\nMerleau-Ponty [1945] 2012 developed a related view, influenced not\nonly by both Husserl and Heidegger, but by his study of Gestalt\npsychologists (who were themselves influenced by the Brentano school\nand by Husserl), in which he defends a conception of perceptual\nconsciousness as a kind of bodily understanding. Partly on\nthe basis of contrasts drawn with case studies of pathologies of\nperception and action due to brain damage, he argues that, in normal\nsensory perception, our exploratory and goal-directed movement itself\nconstitutes a way of being conscious of things—and a form of\nunderstanding what is perceived—not derived from activities of\nconceptual categorization and inference (which belong properly to the\nintellect). Relatedly for Merleau-Ponty: the organization and\nadjustment of movements involved in bodily understanding, though\nnorm-guided, and experienced, must not be regarded as always\nchosen— your moves are objects of personal choice only\nwhen specifically endorsed for reasons. \nThis may convey some central aspects of phenomenological conceptions\nof intentionality and its relation to consciousness. But what can be\nsaid about the general nature of consciousness? How did conceptions of\nthis develop in the wake of Brentano? Here too it is useful to see how\nHusserl’s views emerged from criticism of\nBrentano’s—in particular from rejection of the\nlatter’s inner perception account of consciousness. And here we\ncan see how the third of the initially identified themes—that of\nreflexivity, the relation of consciousness and\nself-consciousness—became elaborated in phenomenology. \nHusserl held that for a mental state to be conscious is for it to be\nan experience (Erlebnis), a part of some “stream of\nconsciousness”. Experiences in this stream of consciousness\nsense include, for Husserl, “perceptions, imaginative and\npictorial representations, acts of conceptual thinking, surmises and\ndoubts, joys and griefs, hopes and fears, wishes and acts of\nwill”. (For the clarification of his concept of consciousness\nfrom which this is quoted, see Husserl [1900] 1970, V\n§§1–6.) An experience in this sense is necessarily\nexperienced (erlebt). But, contra Brentano, this\ndoes not mean that experiences continually appear as objects of some\ninner perception. (When, for example, a sensation is felt, the\nsensation is not some object of which the feeling is an appearance;\nthe sensation simply coincides with feeling it.) Husserl did,\nhowever, affirm that some kind of reflexivity is essential to\nconsciousness. Crucial to this view was a certain conception of\ntime-consciousness (Husserl 1991). Husserl argues that, distinct from\nany capacity for memory directed on an object in the past, in which\nyou recall what experience you just had, there is a sort of\n“retention” of what has just happened in your\nexperience (e.g., what you just heard in a melody or in a phrase) that\nenables you to perceive temporally extended wholes. Likewise, more\nbasic than any predictions about what lies in the future is\nan anticipation or “protention” of what you are\nabout to experience. You are thus in a sense primitively conscious of\nyour own experience in retaining and anticipating it, even though you\ndo not thereby make it into an intentional object, as you do\nwhen, in reflection, you think and make judgments about your\nexperience. Consciousness is, for Husserl, in this way necessarily\nreflexive without necessarily being reflective. A\nsimilar view, influenced by Husserl, is prominent in Sartre’s\ndoctrine that “every consciousness is a non-positional\nconsciousness of itself”. Though Sartre defends this idea on the\nsomewhat different grounds that denying it would involve the\n(allegedly) absurd notion of a consciousness totally “ignorant\nof itself” (Sartre [1937] 1957, [1942] 1956). \nOne might, as Sartre did, distinguish the question of whether\nconsciousness is somehow necessarily consciousness “of\nitself” without becoming “an object for\nitself” from another reflexivity question: is all\nconsciousness essentially, in part, a consciousness of\noneself—not “as object”, but “as\nsubject”? Sartre answered this question in the negative. All\nconsciousness (even “pre-reflective”) is self-conscious,\nbut only when reflection occurs, and consciousness becomes (as\ncommonly it is not) itself an intentional object, is there any\nconsciousness of an ego. Husserl earlier, in the first edition of\nLogical Investigations, affirmed a similar view. However, he\ndid not claim, as Sartre sometimes seems to, that pre-reflective\nexperience is “non-egological” in the sense of being\nno one’s, or literally selfless, only that,\nphenomenologically, there are no grounds for regarding an ego as some\nunifying “center” of intentional relations. On this view,\nwhen I correctly say that (even pre-reflectively) an experience\nbelongs to me, I have no phenomenological\njustification to think this means anything more than that this\nexperience is a constituent in a certain unified complex—a\ncertain stream of consciousness; I have no warrant to posit that the\nego, the “me” to whom experience belongs, constitutes a\npersisting “unifier”. However, Husserl (as he announces in\nthe second edition of the Logical Investigations)\nsignificantly revised his views, and held there to be a\nphenomenological case for the “transcendental ego”.\nFiguring centrally in this shift was his desire to recognize an aspect\nto experience through which one is active in making\ncommitments (e.g., in judging something to be a certain way)\nthat—qua personal commitments—necessarily involve\na persisting “I”. There is a kind of consciousness of self\nin experience, which, while evident to phenomenological reflection,\ndoes not itself consist in reflectively attributing to oneself some\nproperty. (Husserl [1929] 1960 §§ 31–33) \nWe may now identify three distinct ideas found in phenomenological\nthinking about the alleged reflexivity of consciousness. First, there\nis the idea that necessarily, whenever there is a conscious state,\nthere is, in some sense, consciousness of it. Second, one\nfinds the notion that it is, however, only occasionally, and\nonly in reflection, that a conscious state is simultaneously\nan intentional object for the one whose state it is. Third,\nthere is the claim that one’s conscious states ordinarily somehow\ninclude a non-reflective consciousness of\noneself—though not as intentional object, but “as\nsubject”. \nWith these distinctions in mind, we can see that to speak of\nthe phenomenological view of these matters risks eliding\nsignificant differences. For philosophers in this tradition differed\ninterestingly with respect to the three theses just named. Brentano\nwould maintain the first, deny the second, and seems to have been\nsilent on the third. Husserl, however, (eventually) affirmed all\nthree—with the first two importantly grounded in a view of\ntime-consciousness, and the third in the idea that we experience\nourselves as active understanding subjects. Sartre, meanwhile, affirms\nonly the first two theses, and embraces the second on different\ngrounds from Husserl. One may attribute some version of the second and\nthird ideas to Heidegger, since he says that when things in our\nsurroundings show themselves to us (or are “uncovered”)\nthrough our dealings with them, we are also thereby non-reflectively\n“disclosed” to ourselves: what we are is\ndisclosed to us through our use of things as we engage in our everyday\nprojects (Heidegger 1982 §15b). This may be taken to\ncommit Heidegger also to the idea that consciousness involves some\nkind of reflexive, but non-reflective, consciousness of self\nas subject. But it does so only on the assumption that, when something\nis uncovered to me in my use of it, I experience it or am somehow\nconscious of it, and that, in being disclosed to myself though my\nactivity, I am somehow self-conscious. But that interpretation would\nbe resisted by those who regard it as crucial to seeing what makes\nHeidegger differ from Husserl that we take him to deny we are\nordinarily conscious of things in dealing with them (see Dreyfus 1991;\nKaüfer and Chemero 2015). Again, these interpretive matters seem\nclosely tied to one’s own assumptions about the notion of\nconsciousness. At least we might say Heidegger’s view’s\nabout uncoveredness and self-disclosure gives him something strongly\nanalogous to the third idea about consciousness. In any case,\nit is crucial to recognize this peculiarity of his account: unlike\nHusserl, Heidegger links such basic reflexivity (self-disclosure) to\nthe notion of an inescapable, everyday “inauthentic” or\nconventional self-understanding, to be contrasted with an authentic\nform that can emerge from this in a kind of\n(“Angst”-triggered) crisis of meaningfulness. As\nfor the first of the three reflexivity ideas (all consciousness is\n“of itself”), it is unclear Heidegger endorses (or even\nmentions) it at all. However, notably, Sartre bases his own\nquasi-Heideggerean interpretation of authenticity in Being and\nNothingness on his way of combining this with the second\nnotion. \nAll three notions are endorsed in Merleau-Ponty. But in his account\n(perhaps somewhat like Heidegger’s) the second\n(non-reflectiveness) and third (experienced self-as-subject) seem to\ncarry far more weight. For Merleau-Ponty understanding oneself as\nsubject connects importantly with his notion of consciousness as\nembodied understanding: in perceiving, one experiences one’s own\nbody as subject of a distinctively sensorimotor form of understanding,\nmanifest in normatively guided responses that are not analyzable as\npersonal choices made for reasons. (For discussion of\nphenomenologists’ views about consciousness and its relation to\nself-consciousness that assimilates them much more than does the\npresent one, see Zahavi 1998, 2005, 2014. For further discussion\nspecifically of Brentano’s views on this topic: Kriegel\nforthcoming, Textor 2012, and Thomasson 2000. For Heidegger, see\nBlattner 2013 and Crowell 2013. For Merleau-Ponty: Siewert 2013a.) \nThis overview of consciousness and intentionality in the\nBrentano-Husserl tradition brings to light several broad areas of\ndiscussion. Closely related to general concerns about how to interpret\neither of these two notions, three interrelated themes have emerged.\nOne concerns whether intentionality or consciousness are\ndetachable from one’s relation to the world and things\nwithin it. A second concerns how to distinguish basic forms\nof consciousness and intentionality—and in particular whether,\ndistinct from the activity of the intellect or of a properly\nconceptual understanding, we should recognize something equally\nintentional on which it based, manifest in perception and action.\nFinally, there is the theme of the reflexivity of\nconsciousness: is consciousness somehow essentially bound up with a\nkind of self-consciousness—either consciousness of\nitself, or of the self (as subject)? As we shall see,\nthese themes have become important—somewhat later, and largely\nindependently—in analytic philosophy.  \nThe late nineteenth/early twentieth century heritage of most analytic\ntreatments of intentionality (or mental representation or content)\nlies most significantly not in the writings of Brentano, Husserl and\ntheir direct intellectual descendants, but in the seminal discussions\nof logico-linguistic concerns in Gottlob Frege’s ([1892] 1952)\n“On Sense and Reference”, and Bertrand Russell’s\n(1905) “On Denoting”, widely considered defining documents\nof the analytic tradition. But Frege’s and Russell’s work\ncomes from much the same era and intellectual milieu as\nBrentano’s and the early Husserl’s. And certain points of\ncontact have long been recognized: Russell’s discussion of\nMeinong’s theory of objects; Chisholm’s and Quine’s\ndiscussion of what they took to be “Brentano’s\nthesis”; and the similarities between Husserl’s\nmeaning/object distinction (in Logical Investigation I) and\nFrege’s (prior) sense/reference distinction. Indeed the case has\nbeen influentially (though controversially) made (by Føllesdal\n1969, 1990) that Husserl’s meaning/object distinction is\nborrowed from Frege (though with a change in terminology) and that\nHusserl’s “noema” is properly interpreted as having\nthe characteristics of Fregean sense. \nHowever, in comparing phenomenological treatments of intentionality to\nthose found in the analytic tradition the following should be kept in\nmind. What Husserl (like Brentano) sought was to characterize general\nfeatures of intentional experience from the subject’s point of\nview. Accordingly, his conception of intentionality is fundamentally\nrooted in reflections on: object-constancy in perceptual experience;\ncontrasts between the ostensible objects of paradigm intentional\nexperiences with these objects “as intended” (i.e., how\nand “as what” they are intended); and the idea that\nexperience (whether perceptual, imaginative, or conceptual) can\nsomehow continue to be “of” something, even when it is\nwithout genuine relation to an object. Thus, in the phenomenological\ntradition, the discussion of intentionality is thoroughly enmeshed\nwith that of experience or consciousness from the start. On the other\nhand, those of Frege’s and Russell’s writings most\ninfluential for discussions of intentionality concentrate on issues\nthat grow from their achievements in logic, and gave rise to ways of\nunderstanding mental states largely through questions about the\nlanguage used to report them. Moreover, for other reasons, during much\nof the twentieth century, analytic philosophy often dissociated\nconsciousness (understood largely or entirely in sensory terms) from\naspects of the mind connected with intentionality. Thus our treatment\nof intentionality in this section will leave the concept of\nconsciousness largely in the background. It will, nonetheless,\nreemerge explicitly in Section 5, when we see discuss how\nconsciousness and intentionality were separated, and then reunited in\nanalytic philosophy. \nCentral to Frege’s legacy for discussions of mental or\nintentional content has been his distinction between sense\n(Sinn) and reference (Bedeutung), and his use of\nthis distinction to cope with the apparent failures of substitutivity\nof (ordinarily) co-referential expressions in contexts created by\npsychological verbs, of the sort mentioned in Section 2. In\nFrege’s famous example: you may understand the expressions\n“The Morning Star” and “The Evening Star” and\nuse them to refer to what is one and the same object—the planet\nVenus. But this is not sufficient for you to know that the Morning\nStar is identical with the Evening Star. For the ways in which an\nobject (the “reference”) is “given” to your\nmind when you employ these expressions (the senses or Sinne\nyou grasp when you use them) may differ in such a manner that\nignorance of astronomy would prevent your realizing that they are but\ntwo ways in which the same object can be given. \nWhile Frege did not himself elaborate a general account of\nintentionality, what he says suggests the following picture.\nIntentional states of mind—thinking about Venus, wishing to\nvisit it—involve some special relation (such as\n“grasping”)—not to a Venus “in one’s\nmind”, nor to an image of Venus, but to an abstract entity, a\nthought, which also constitutes the sense of a linguistic expression\nthat can be used to report one’s state of mind, a sense that is\ngrasped or understood by speakers who use it. \nThis style of account, together with the Fregean thesis that\n“sense determines reference”, and the history of\ncriticisms both have elicited, provide a significant part of the\nbackground of contemporary discussions of mental content. It is often\nassumed, with Frege, that we must recognize that thoughts or contents\ncannot consist in images or essentially private “ideas”.\nBut philosophers have frequently criticized Frege’s view of\nthought as some abstract entity “grasped” or\n“present to” the mind, and have wanted to replace\nFrege’s unanalyzed grasping of abstract entities with something\nmore “naturalistic”, or at any rate more\nexplanatory of what is involved in thinking. \nReaction to the Fregean picture has determined the character of\nanalytic discussions of intentionality or content in another major\nway. It may be granted that the content of the thought reported is to\nbe identified with the sense of the expression with which we report\nit. But then, it is argued, the identity of this content will not be\ndetermined individualistically, and may in some respects lie beyond\nthe grasp (or not be fully “present to” the mind) of the\npsychological subject. For what determines the reference of an\nexpression may be a natural causal relation to the world—as Saul\nKripke (1972) and Hilary Putnam (1975) have argued is true for proper\nnames, like “Nixon” and “Cicero”, and\n“natural kind” terms like “gold” and\n“water”. And (as Tyler Burge (1979) has argued) a speaker\nwho, considered individually, remains qualitatively the same, may\nnevertheless assert something different simply because of a variation\nin the linguistic community to which she belongs. (For example, what\nher utterance of “arthritis” means is determined not by\nwhat is “in her head”, but by the medical experts in her\ncommunity. If their usage were to shift, so would the meaning of her\nassertions, independently of any internal change in her.) Now if\nreference and truth conditions of expressions by which one’s\nthought is reported or expressed are not determined by what is in\none’s head, and the content of one’s thought determines\ntheir reference and truth conditions, then the content of one’s\nthought is also not determined individualistically. Rather it is\nnecessarily bound up with one’s causal relations to certain\nnatural substances, and one’s membership in a certain linguistic\ncommunity. Both linguistic meaning and mental contents are\n“externally” determined. \nThe development of externalist conceptions of intentionality informs\nthe reception of Russell’s legacy in contemporary philosophy of\nmind as well. Russell also helped to put in play a conception of the\nintentionality of mental states, according to which each such state is\nseen as involving the individual’s “acquaintance with a\nproposition” (counterpart to Fregean\n“grasping”)—which proposition is at once both what\nis understood in understanding expressions by which the state of mind\nis reported, and the content of the individual’s state of mind.\nThus for many philosophers influenced by the Russellian heritage,\nintentional states are conceived of as attitudes towards\npropositions—propositional attitudes. Also importantly,\nRussell’s famous analysis of definite descriptions into phrases\nemploying existential quantifiers and predicates underlay many\nsubsequent philosophers’ rejection of any conception of\nintentionality (like Meinong’s) that sees in it a relation to\nnon-existent objects. And, Russell’s treatment drew attention to\ncases of what he called “logically proper names” that\napparently defy such analysis in descriptive terms (paradigmatically,\nthe terms “this” and “that”), and which (he\nthought) thus must refer directly to objects. Reflection on such\n“demonstrative” and “indexical” (e.g.,\n“I”, “here”, “now”) reference led\nsome (Kaplan 1979; Perry 1977) to maintain that the content of our\nstates of mind cannot always be constituted by Fregean senses but must\nbe seen as consisting partly of public objects in the world outside\nour heads to which we refer, demonstratively,\nindexically—another source of support for an externalist view of\nmental content, hence, of intentionality. \nYet another important source of externalist proclivities in twentieth\ncentury philosophy lies in the thought that the meaningfulness of a\nspeaker’s utterances depends on its potential intelligibility to\nhearers: language must be public—an idea that has found\nvarying and influential expression in the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein,\nW.V.O. Quine, and Donald Davidson. This, coupled with the assumption\nthat intentionality (or “thought” in the broad (Cartesian)\nsense) must be expressible in language, has led some to conclude that\nwhat determines the content of one’s mind must lie in the\nexternal conditions that enable others to attribute that content. \nIt would be appropriate here to note the emergence of another sort of\nexternalism in philosophy of mind and cognitive science since the\n1990s, distinct from the “content externalism” made\nprominent by Putnam and Burge, as strains of “embodied”,\n“embedded”, or “enactive”, theorizing about\nperception, cognition and action gained prominence. For instance, on\nthe “extended mind” view advocated in Clark and Chalmers\n1998, mental processes are not confined to representational activity\ninside one’s head—they encompass an embodied interaction\nwith one’s environment—cognition (broadly construed) is\nnot limited to the manipulations of internal representations, but\nextends to the use of things out in the world. \nIt should be noted here too that the movement from Frege and Russell\ntoward externalist views of intentional content has been, and\ncontinues to be subject to serious detailed challenges, and has\nprompted development of alternative (sometimes avowedly internalist)\naccounts. (Consider, for example: Crane 1991, Farkas 2008, Ludwig\n1996b, and Searle 1983.) And it is no easy matter even getting clear\nabout the fundamental theses at issue—partly insofar as what it\nmeans to talk about what is “internal” to the subject, and\njust what is assumed about the notion of content, are often unclear.\nIn fact, Brie Gertler (2012b) argues that the\n“internalism/externalism debate” is something of a mess,\nand there is ultimately no satisfactory univocal understanding of just\nwhat is under dispute. \nOne other aspect of the Frege-Russell tradition of theorizing about\ncontent that impinges on the consciousness/intentionality connection\nis this. If content is identified with the sense or the\ntruth-condition determiners of the expressions used in the\nobject-clause reporting intentional states of mind, it will seem\nnatural (even if it’s not inevitable) to suppose that possession\nof mental content requires the possession of conceptual capacities of\nthe sort involved in linguistic understanding—“grasping\nsenses”. Here, however, another issue rears its head: is there\nnot perhaps a form of sensory intentionality that does not\nrequire anything as distinctively intellectual or conceptual as is\nneeded for the grasping of linguistic senses or propositions? (This\nwould be a kind of intentionality that could be had by the\npre-linguistic (e.g., babies) or by non-linguistic creatures (e.g.,\ndogs).) Advocates of varying versions of the idea that there is a\ndistinctively “non-conceptual” kind of content include\nBermúdez (1998), Crane (1992), Evans (1982), Kelly (2001),\nPeacocke (1992), and Tye (1995). For “conceptualist”\nvoices of opposition to this trend, see Brewer (2005), McDowell\n(1994), and Speaks (2005). A deep difficulty in assessing these debates\nlies in getting an acceptable conception of concepts (and of\nconcept possession) to work with (see Wright 2015). \nWe can now see, in the analytic tradition, the emergence of themes\nsimilar to the “detachability” and “basic\nforms” themes identified in the connection with the\nphenomenological movement. Later we will discuss these parallels. For\nnow, to round out the present historical sketch so as to inform such\ncomparisons, we may note some of the factors seemingly important to\nthe course discussion took in analytic philosophy. Though its approach\nto intentionality is historically rooted in Fregean and Russellian\ntreatments of logic and language, developments during the twentieth\ncentury sketched above—various forms of externalism, along with\nopposition to allegedly over-intellectualized views of perceptual\nintentionality—came in conflict with this heritage to some\nextent. Among the sources of this shift, one might plausibly find: a\ndisenchantment with early twentieth century conceptions of\nphilosophy’s distinctive role (of, e.g., providing conceptual\nanalyses, and solutions to logico-linguistic puzzles); aligned with\nthis, an increasingly perceived need to support claims in philosophy\nwith experimental science, especially as systematic, academic\npsychology grew more sophisticated and successful; and\nfinally—relatedly—the belief that defending a scientific\nworldview requires defending an ontology typically described as\n“physicalist” against objections deemed to have\nunacceptably dualist implications. Such factors (and others) helped\nencourage philosophers in the analytic tradition to tie consciousness\nmore closely to intentionality in ways that raised issues similar to\nthose canvassed above in connection with phenomenology—though\noften from rather different motives. \nOne evidently fundamental division in views about the relationship of\nconsciousness and intentionality separates those who think that\nconsciousness—more specifically, the phenomenal character of the\nsort of experience we actually have—necessarily carries with it\nsome kind of intentionality, and those who do not. We might call the\nformer (as will be seen, quite varied group)\n“intentionalists” and the latter (following Horgan and\nTienson 2002) “separatists”. Intentionalism, so\ncharacterized, can cover a wide variety of positions, partly because\nof potential variety in just how intentionality is conceived. Exactly\nwhat contrast is marked by “intentionalism vs. separatism”\nwill depend heavily on one’s conception of intentionality. \nStill, operating at first only with a broad and open notion of this\ncontrast, perspectives reasonably regarded as separatist occupied the\nmainstream of much twentieth century analytic philosophy. According to\nan important (once predominant) view, consciousness is exhausted by\nnon-intentional “qualia” or “raw feels”.\nPlausibly, the acceptance of this view owes much to the profound\ninfluence of Gilbert Ryle’s Concept of Mind (1949) in\nthe development of analytic philosophy. As part of his argument\nagainst a Cartesian notion of mind as the site of hidden\n(“occult”) “ghostly” occurrences, Ryle\ncontends that the stream of consciousness has nothing to do with\nwhat’s central to mind, since it contains only sensations and\nimagery that provide “no possibility of deciding whether the\ncreature that had these was an animal or a human being; an idiot, a\nlunatic, or a sane man”—nothing of which it is appropriate\nto ask whether it is correct or incorrect, veridical or nonveridical.\nAlso powerfully influential, in the same era and intellectual milieu,\nwas Wittgenstein’s (1953) attack on the idea of understanding as\nan “inner process”, and his criticism of the notion that\nthere could be a private language. Popularity of Wittgensteinian\ninsistence on the need for public criteria of meaning could—and\nplausibly did—reinforce a Rylean belittlement of consciousness,\non the assumption that consciousness, being something hidden\nor “inner”, could bring with it distinctions in\nunderstanding and intelligence only if meaning were something\npurely private—as it cannot be. At any rate, partly\nthrough the reception of Ryle and Wittgenstein in U.T. Place’s\n(1956) and J.J.C Smart’s (1959) influential brain-based\nmaterialist view about consciousness, the reduction of consciousness\nto sensation and sensory imagery became firmly implanted in philosophy\nof mind, since these writings did so much to set the terms of its\ndebates. \nAlso influential, to similar effect, was the conception expressed in\nWilfrid Sellars’ (1956) distinction between sentience\n(sensation) and sapience. Whereas the qualities of feelings\ninvolved in the former—mere sensations—require no\ncognitive sophistication and are readily attributable to brutes, the\nlatter—involving awareness of, awareness\nthat—requires that one have the right concepts, which\ncannot be guaranteed just by having sensations, but needs learning and\ninferential capacities (which Sellars believed come only with\nlanguage). Richard Rorty (1979) was not alone in taking Sellars’\nviews to support a strict separation of the phenomenal and the\nintentional (see also Brandom 1994). Rorty’s appropriation of\nSellars (blended with Quinean eliminativism) leads him to deny not\njust the importance, but even the reality of consciousness. \nExternalist arguments (of the sort mentioned in Section 4) have also\nbeen taken to support the separation of the “qualitative”\nfrom meaning and content (hence the separation of consciousness from\nintentionality). For it has been sometimes assumed that the phenomenal\ncharacter of one’s experience is “fixed\ninternally”—i.e., it has no necessary relation to the\nnature of particular substances in one’s external environment or\nto one’s linguistic community. Thus if externalist arguments\n(like those of Putnam and Burge) show that neither meaning nor content\nis “in the head”, phenomenal consciousness cannot imply\nany intentionality or content. Putnam (1981) himself drew such a\nconclusion, and much like Ryle, took the stream of consciousness to\ncomprise nothing more than sensations and images, which (recalling\nFrege) are to be set apart from thought and meaning. Without denying\nimportant differences in the views just mentioned, it seems reasonable\nto suppose that together they helped entrench in analytic philosophy a\nconception (sometimes welded to the term “qualia”) that\nconfines consciousness, in the experiential/what it’s like\nsense, to sensations and sensory images—and thus segregates it\nfrom thought, concepts, and “propositional\nattitudes”—hence from intentionality. \nObjections to this conception of sense-experience became increasingly\ncommon towards the end of the twentieth century, from diverse angles\nand motivations, in writings affirming a variety of intentionalist\npositions. But even before that, separatism was neither unambiguously\nembraced nor universal in analytic philosophy (consider Anscombe\n1965). And an important explicit statement of broadly intentionalist\nviews of perceptual experience can be found even in the early nineteen\neighties (Searle’s 1983 Intentionality). One\nsignificant strain of intentionalism (quite unlike Searle’s)\narising in the 1990s, combines acceptance of externalism about content\nwith a rejection of internalism about phenomenal character. Thus\nMartin Davies (1997), Fred Dretske (1995), and Michael Tye (1995,\n2002) argue that the phenomenal character of experience is also\nessentially determined by causal environmental connections.\nPace Putnam, externalism about intentionality should\nnot be taken to support separatism. Philosophers working from\nthis perspective also characteristically limit what kind of\nintentionality they took to be inseparable from phenomenal\ncharacter—to some extent preserving the Rylean, purely sensory\nstream of consciousness—but giving this a crucial intentionalist\ntwist. One draws a distinction between two sorts of intentionality or\nmental representation, one of which is found in sensory states, the\nother in non-sensory cognition. One then maintains that only the\nformer is entailed by or constitutive of phenomenal character. As\nalluded to earlier, Tye identifies phenomenal character with the\nnon-conceptual, picture- or map-like representational content he\nattributes to perceptual states which are poised to affect belief.\n \nTye’s account also exemplifies two other features common to a\nnumber of externalist intentionalist views of consciousness that arose\nin the shadow of separatism. First, his view is, as we might put it,\nthoroughly “non-reflexivist” (in the sense introduced in\nSection 3): it finds essential to one’s conscious state neither\na representation of that state (i.e., no higher-order or\nself-representation), nor any directedness/reference to that state,\nnor any self-consciousness (whether this be construed as consciousness\nof the state itself, or of the self whose state it is). Secondly,\nTye’s intentionalism is of what we might call a\nreductive sort. That is to say, the claim is not merely that\nit follows from an experience’s having certain kinds of\nphenomenal character that it is intentional or has intentionality of\nsome sort. The claim is that its being phenomenal, and having the\ncharacter it does, comes as a necessary consequence of what kind of\nintentionality it has (or what kind of mental representation it is),\nwhere this type of intentionality/representation can be explained in\nterms that involve no primitive appeal to phenomenal character. Thus\nthe idea is not just the minimal intentionalist one that some kinds of\nphenomenality entail some kinds of intentionality. The idea is that\nphenomenal character can be explained as nothing but—it can be\nexplanatorily reduced to—a certain kind of intentionality or\nrepresentation. \nSuch reductive intentionalism is significantly motivated by a\nmetaphysical aim that has animated much analytic philosophy of mind:\nto say what mental states are in non-mentalistic, physical terms. Part\nof what inspires this goal is the thought that, if mind is real and\nefficacious, it must somehow be necessitated by the facts of nature\nthat science reveals—a nature in itself fundamentally mindless.\nBut how could there be such necessitation of the mental by the\nnon-mental? Reductive intentionalism about consciousness offers the\noutline of an answer. Like the separatist, one starts from a general\nconception of intentionality (or mental representation) that does not\nassume consciousness, along with some idea about how such\nintentionality must arise in a world governed by the operation of\ncertain non-intentional, natural-causal processes. Then, still without\nappeal to consciousness, one purports to identify a certain\nspecies of intentionality (in terms of its use, its sources,\nits content), whose presence purportedly guarantees the occurrence of\nexperience with a certain phenomenal character. On such a reductive\nintentionalist perspective, separatist philosophers do no more than\ncontain the problematic “inner”, “private”,\n“subjective” mind of the Cartesian legacy and mitigate its\nharm, by sequestering it in a zone—consciousness—from\nwhich understanding, intelligence, meaning, intentionality have been\nsafely evacuated (as in the view suggested by Kim 2011). The problem\nwill be fully resolved, only if, instead of merely shrinking and\nisolating consciousness, we find a way of entirely subsuming it in a\nconception of mental representation that owes nothing to it. \nWe have just focused on the emergence of a kind of intentionalism\nabout consciousness that is not only reductive, but\nexternalist, strongly restrictivist, and completely\nnon-reflexivist. But we now need to make it clearer how\nintentionalist views can be advanced that depart significantly from\nthat position along one or more of each of these dimensions. Consider\nfirst how an intentionalist might oppose both separatism and\nexternalism. One might begin with a Cartesian thought experiment in\nwhich one conceives of one’s consciousness with all its\nsubjective riches intact, though the spatial realm of nature is\nsupposed a fiction. Or less radically, one may start with the science\nfiction scenario of a “brain in a vat”, whose artificially\ninduced activity generates an extended history of sense experience\nthat is indistinguishable—in its subjective, phenomenal\ncharacter—from that of a subject with a human body moving about\nin the environment, as we believe ourselves to do. Again, if you\nassume an externalist view of intentionality, you may conclude that\nphenomenal character, being thus detachable from the external world,\nis also separable from (and insufficient for) intentionality. However,\nyou might instead turn your guns in the opposite\ndirection—against externalism. It may seem to you that\nthe most intuitively plausible reading of the vat scenario would take\nthe brain’s experience to be a global hallucination,\nsomething like a vivid, massively coherent dream, and so a\nsystematically incorrect experience of where the subject of\nexperience is and what is happening around it. And so, we should think\nthe intentionality or representational character of\nsuch experience would survive its estrangement from the world, along\nwith its phenomenal character. One may then infer that for at least\nsome contents/kinds of intentionality or representation, the kind of\ncausal tie between mind and world that, according to some\nexternalisms, we need for fixing its intentional content, is not\nstrictly necessary after all. This route to a non-externalist\nintentionalism about consciousness finds varying expression in, for\nexample, Kriegel 2011, Horgan and Tienson 2002, Loar 2003, and Ludwig\n1996b.) \nSuch a challenge to externalist intentionalism would clearly also\nchallenge its strategy of reductionism. There are other ways to be an\nintentionalist and reject both. One approach (albeit still using\nradical thought experiments) would draw on the sort of\n“zombie” scenario whose metaphysical significance is\nexplored in such sophisticated detail by Chalmers 1996: one conceives\nof a world type identical to our own in terms of basic physics (laws,\ndistribution of particles and forces), but with consciousness left\nout. One might take the conceivability of such a world to give one\nreason to reject the externalist-intentionalist assumption that the\nright combination of natural, non-intentional, non-phenomenal facts\nmetaphysically guarantees the presence of consciousness. And one might\nstill combine this with the claim that certain forms of consciousness\ndo guarantee some sort of intentionality. This sort of non-reductive\nintentionalist view would actually go beyond challenging externalist\nintentionalism about consciousness, to upset the metaphysical picture\ncommonly motivating it. For this would be to reject the assumption\nthat mind (conscious mind at least) is non-basic, in the sense of\nbeing a necessary upshot of certain non-mental facts. \nThere are yet other routes to a non-reductive intentionalism, less\nmetaphysically bold. One might question the adequacy of various\nreductionist strategies that have been employed for specifying a kind\nof intentionality (or mental representation) that non-circularly\nguarantees phenomenality—as in Tye’s theory. One way\ndoubts can get a grip is by considering variations on the phenomenon\nof “blindsight”—which may be reasonably interpreted\nas involving limited visual discriminatory abilities regarding stimuli\nthat (on account of cortical damage) don’t\nlook—don’t visually appear—anyhow to the\ndiscriminating subject. Can we coherently conceive of some such\nblindsight—a kind of “seeing” without\nvisual consciousness (experience) of the visual stimuli—that\nnonetheless would meet the conditions this or that reductive\nintentionalist is committed to thinking guarantee phenomenal\nvision? Various kinds of enhanced blindsight have been envisaged\n(Block’s superblindsight 1995, 2002; Siewert’s spontaneous\namblyopic blindsight 1998, 2010). We are invited to consider the\nprospect of visually mediated responses, in action and report, to\nstimuli of which the subject lacks visual experience—responses\nthat correspond, in their spontaneity and acuity, to what is afforded\nby very low-grade visual experience. Suppose we can find no\nnon-phenomenal intentional/representational difference, necessarily\ndistinguishing such low-grade visual consciousness from its closest\nblindsight analogue, to which we can reduce the difference between the\ntwo. Then certain prominent versions of reductionism are threatened.\nBut opposition or skepticism regarding all such accounts can coexist\nwith intentionalism in the broadest sense. However, this sort of\nchallenge to reductive intentionalism would leave open questions about\nwhat, if anything, to say about brains in vats, zombies, physicalism,\nand metaphysical basic-ness—and it would even be compatible with\nsome forms of externalism. \nThe possibility of non-reductive intentionalism may be evident in\nanother important way, particularly relevant to sense experience.\nReductive intentionalism may seem to require that phenomenal character\nnecessarily supervenes on intentional content—or on this plus\n“intentional mode” (where that encompasses sensory\nmodality). Or, as one might put it, for any phenomenal difference\nthere must be a difference in what properties something is represented\nto have, or a difference in the cognitive mode (or in sensory\nmodality—e.g., visual or tactile) through which it is\nrepresented to have them. But a nonreductive intentionalism is not\ncommitted to such a strong thesis. For one may allow that various\ndifferences in phenomenal character are sufficient for differences in\nintentional features, while holding that there can be differences in\ncharacter without differences in what something is represented to be,\nor in mode/modality of representation. Such would be the case, for\nexample, if one argued (like Block 1990) that two visual experiences\ncould represent the same objective color property on account of\nsharing appropriate causal linkages to the physical environment, even\nthough subjectively the experience of color differed—there was a\ndifference in “mental paint”—in virtue of some\ninternally contrived inversion of what it was like for one to\nexperience color on the two occasions. Independently of such views\nabout the metaphysics of color and visual representation, one might\nmaintain (like Siewert 2005) that the subtle but ubiquitous\ndifferences in the subjective character of experience that come with\nshifts between what is less and what is more “attended-to”\nin the visual field often cannot be justifiably matched to represented\ndifferences in “what properties look to be where”. Both\nviews appear incompatible with reductive intentionalism. But both are\nconsistent with the idea that the phenomenal character of visual\nexperience brings intentionality with it—for example, in making\nthings in your environment look to you shaped, sized, or positioned\neither accurately or inaccurately. \nPart of what this section aims to make clear is the variety of views\nthat might be seen as intentionalist. Intentionalism may be either\nexternalist or not, reductive or not. Further, intentionalisms may be,\nas already suggested, either more or less restrictive or inclusive\n(and this in various ways). And they may be either completely\nnon-reflexivist, or in some respect reflexivist—where the latter\ncategory is very heterogeneous, and can encompass deeply divergent\nviews. And both of these latter contrasts admit of being developed in\ndiverse, and either reductive or non-reductive ways. Section 6 will\nexplore the inclusive/restrictive contrast and some of the positions\nthat have appeared along this dimension, and Section 7 some varieties\nof reflexivist notions. Before delving into these complications, the\nreader may wonder what is supposed to justify intentionalism, and how\nthe issues of this section might appear from the phenomenological\nperspectives canvassed in Section 3. Discussion of the first question\ncan be found in the supplement,\n Arguments for Intentionalism.\n The second question is discussed in the supplement,\n Phenomenology and Intentionalism.\n  \nWe have met with a contrast between views that are relatively\ninclusive, and those that are relatively restrictive in what they\ncount as properly experiential. Specifically: non-separatists’\npositions diverge with respect to what differences in\nintentionality they regard as brought along with differences in the\nphenomenal or subjective character of experience. If we think of\n“phenomenal intentionality” as whatever intentionality\ncomes along with certain varieties of phenomenal consciousness, we can\ndistinguish those views that recognize more phenomenal\nintentionality from those that recognize less. Philosophers\ndisagree then over how richly intentional (and thus, as we might also\nsay, how cognitively rich) phenomenal character is. In this section we\nwill set separatism aside, and focus on how intentionalist\nperspectives differ along this dimension. \nWe have noted how distinguishing basic forms of intentionality or\ncontent (such as “conceptual” and\n“non-conceptual”) may be allied (as in Tye) with a broad\nrestriction on phenomenal intentionality: phenomenal character is\nconfined to a non-conceptual sort of intentionality (or\ncontent or representation) that is found in sensory states\n(where these would encompass, e.g., both visual perception and\nimagery). Similarly, one may draw a general limit to the kind of\nproperties that can be represented in the phenomenal character of\none’s experience. This is illustrated in Prinz’s (2012)\nrepresentationalist theory: he limits phenomenal character to\n“intermediate level” “viewpoint dependent”\nproperties that one may perceive something to have (such as\n“2½-D” shapes); “higher-level”\nproperties (such as being a chair) are excluded. \nHowever, to think of such theories as admitting relatively less\nrichness to phenomenal intentionality could mislead us. An aspect of\nthis: one may limit richness in the manner just suggested, while\nexpanding it in other ways. In the case of vision one indication of\nrichness might lie in how finely discriminatory the\nintentional/representational differences in phenomenal character are:\na richer view would recognize more differences in\ncolors or shapes figure in experience in this way, a sparser\nview fewer. The question here would be roughly: how much can\nyou visually experience of space, of color, in a given amount of time?\nOn such matters, both Tye’s and Prinz’s accounts would\ncome out as rich relative to others—since they would say that a\nhigher level of spatial detail is experienced even in relatively brief\nvisual presentations (such as letter arrays) than would\nothers—like Dennett, who advocates a professedly\n“sparse” view of consciousness. Controversies of\nthis sort about richness versus sparseness have recently\nplayed out in complex ways that combine phenomenological\nconsiderations with detailed interpretation of experimental work on\nvision (concerned, e.g, with “change blindness”,\n“inattentional blindness”, “masking”, and\n“Sperling paradigm” cuing effects). (See, for example,\nBlock 2012 for discussion of such issues, in support of a relatively\nrich view.) And such questions about the “fineness of\ngrain” or “detail” in visual experience have often\nbeen discussed in connection with questions about the conflict or\nharmony between what first-person reflective judgment\n(“introspection”) seems to tell us about experience and\nwhat experimental data reveal (see Noë 2002 on the “grand\nillusion hypothesis”). \nAt issue in these latter sort of “richness” controversies\nis, roughly speaking, the amount of “richness at a\nlevel”—e.g., how finely differentiated is spatial\nexperience of an array of objects? These contrast with the earlier\nindicated issues concerning what we might call “richness of\nlevels” in experience. For example, does subjective\nexperience not only distinguish (“at a level”) differences\nin (e.g.) how far a surface bulges out, but differences of\nadditional levels—say, whether an object is\nspherical or cubical, and not just these, but whether it is a\nball or a chair? It seems clear one can have a rich view with\nrespect to one sort of issue, while maintaining sparseness at the\nother. If the question is richness “at a level” Dennett\nwould seem to hold a sparse view relative to Prinz. But if we are\nasking about richness “of levels”, the comparison comes\nout differently: Dennett’s view of consciousness, as Prinz\n(disapprovingly) notes, puts no limits on what sort of properties\nmight figure in its content. \nAnother complicating factor here has to do with how one situates a\ntaxonomy of views with respect to a distinction between sensory or\nperceptual phenomena on the on hand, and thought or\ncognition, on the other. Susanna Siegel has argued for the view\nthat so-called “high-level” features, like being a\npine tree, are “represented in visual experience”.\nTim Bayne (2009) has argued for a position similar to Siegel’s,\npartly by appeal to consideration of the kind of deficits in visual\nrecognition found in associative agnosia. Such views of visual\nconsciousness contrast with Tye’s and Prinz’s. Yet other\nalternatives are possible here—one might maintain experience\nencompasses a greater richness of levels than do either Tye or Prinz,\nthough without (like Siegel) putting visual experience in the business\nof representing objects to have high-level properties. One might argue\nfor the experiential reality of spatial object constancy, and of\nvisual recognition of kinds, without committing to Siegel’s\nversion of representationalism: something might subjectively look\nrecognizable to you as a pine tree or a glove, say—but this\nisn’t necessarily to say that your visual experience (like your\nthought) represents it to have a property that would be missing in a\ngenetically different plant, or in a differently purposed artifact\n(Siewert 2013a, 2015) The issues raised here turn partly on what sort\nof description of experience yields the best understanding of visual\nrecognition in the light of what is made evident by Gestalt phenomena\nand selective deficits in vision, and they seem to call for careful\ninterpretation of relevant experimental work (see Block 2014). \nAnother species of “richness” controversy that arises with\na distinction between thought and sensory states is this. Again, we\nmay distinguish thinking (cognition of the sort involved in\nconceptual, rational understanding) from both perceiving with the\nsenses and forming sensory images. We may thus think of\nthings when we neither perceive them by the senses, nor\nform sensory images of them (by e.g., visualizing), and even\nwhere such images as we may then form (say, such as an utterance in\ninner speech) do not suffice for the thoughts we then have.\nEven if Siegel’s view is in doubt, it may seem at least that\nconceptual thinking in this sense can, in virtue of its subjective\ncharacter, be about pines (and not merely “pine-ish”\nthings), and about gloves (and not merely “glove-ish”\nthings). That is, one might affirm a phenomenal-intentional richness\nof levels, not by having sensory experience attribute to objects a\nricher class of properties, but by holding that thinking and\nunderstanding possess phenomenal character that yields richer\ncognitive differences than can be delivered by the sort of sensory\nexperience one can have without full-blown conceptual abilities. \nIs there something it’s like for us to think that is not\nexhausted by what it’s like for us to have merely sensory\nstates? Here we come upon the issue that has lately emerged under the\nheading “cognitive phenomenology”. Or rather, we come upon\none way of articulating an aspect of issues so labeled. Much of the\nchallenge of this debate lies in properly framing it; different\nparties have done so in significantly different ways. As a start, and\nvery roughly, we might distinguish views that include in\nphenomenal character the sorts of differences in thinking and\nunderstanding that go beyond the “purely sensory” and\nthose that restrict phenomenal character in a way that\nexcludes these. The latter philosophers hold that phenomenal\ncharacter is exhausted by or reducible to purely sensory differences,\nwhile the former say there is more to it than this—the\n“something more” found in thought. The articles in Bayne\nand Montague 2011 provide an array of perspectives on this issue.\nChudnoff 2015 furnishes a detailed overview and assessment of the\ndebate. \nA prominent defender of an inclusive view—David Pitt—takes\nthe question to concern, crucially, whether thought has its own\n“proprietary and distinctive” phenomenal character (Pitt\n2004). His affirmative answer to this has been glossed by saying there\nis a special sort of “non-sensory phenomenology”, and this\nhas been taken to imply the phenomenal character of thought can be\nseparated from that of sensory states in certain ways critics have\nfound highly dubious. Tye and Wright 2011, for instance, assume that\nif there is indeed “cognitive phenomenology”, then there\nis an aspect to the phenomenal character of verbally expressed thought\nthat would remain the same if all imagery and sense perception\n(including the verbal imagery involved in its expression) were removed\nfrom it—which they find incredible. Prinz 2011 assumes that if\ninclusive (what he calls “expansionist”) views were right,\nwe should be able to engage in experiential thought independently of\nall sensory activity, much as we can enjoy experience in one sensory\nmodality in the absence of another (as when we see without hearing).\nBut, he observes, we do not. Related criticisms appear in Pautz\n2013. \nSome proponents of inclusivity do embrace a quite radical in-principle\nseparability of thought and sensory experience. Kriegel 2015, for\nexample, invites us to consider the cognitive experience of a subject\nengaged in “pure” mathematical reasoning, unaccompanied by\nimagery or sensed symbolic expression of any sort. However, neither\nthis sort of radical separability, nor the kinds criticized in Pautz,\nPrinz, and Tye, are essential to all inclusive views. For Siewert\n1998, 2011 the issue does not turn on whether linguistic expression or\nsensory vehicles are merely incidental to our conscious thinking, or\non whether there’s a cognitive component to its subjective\ncharacter that would remain identifiably the same, were everything\nsensory is stripped away from it. Rather, the question is whether the\nsubjective character of your experience when you read, speak, or\nlisten to others, would remain unchanged if all understanding\nwere stripped away, or if differences in how you understood the words\nwere radically switched around. Chudnoff 2015 also takes pains to\nseparate the question of cognitive phenomenology from the claims\ncritics have associated with it. \nClearly then, no small part of justifying a position on this aspect of\nthe “cognitive richness of levels” issue consists in\narguing for a certain way of framing the issues. Additionally, and in\nconnection with this, arguments proceed by asking us to consider what\nsort of differences (or contrasts) in phenomenal character we\nrecognize in reflection. For instance: is there a difference in what\nit’s like for you to take an ambiguous phrase in one sense, and\nthen another? Is there such an experiential difference between reading\nor hearing something without following it, and then again,\nwith understanding? Are we justified in thinking such\ndifferences as we find always coincide with merely sensory\ndifferences? Would what it’s like for us when we understand\nsomething differently be just the same if understanding were absent?\nArguments here also focus on the idea that differences in what\nit’s like for one to have experience make for differences in\nself-knowledge for which we cannot adequately account, if we assume\nthe relevant phenomenal differences to be independent of conceptual\nthought and understanding. (For a sampling of arguments appealing in a\nvariety of ways to experiential contrasts, see Chudnoff 2015, Horgan\nand Tienson 2002, Pitt 2004, Siewert 1998, 2011, and Strawson 1994.\nFor representative arguments that all relevant contrasts are exhausted\nby purely sensory differences, see Tye and Wright 2011, Prinz 2011,\n2013, Robinson 2011. For arguments that appeal, in different ways, to\nconnections between experiential and epistemic differences, see Pitt\n2004 and Siewert 2011. For discussion of Pitt’s epistemic\nargument, see Chudnoff 2015.) \nAnother aspect to these issues concerns what conception of thought\ncontent one employs, and how this is introduced. Some ways of defining\nthe issues invoke at the very outset a notion of content (or of\nrepresentation). Pitt sees the basic question as whether the\nphenomenology of thought “individuates its content”. One\nmay, however, also approach the issue initially by asking about the\nrelation of phenomenal differences to differences in how we understand\nour words, or how we think of what we are thinking about—where\n“understanding” and “thinking” are taken to\nimply the possession of relevant conceptual abilities. Only after\nthis, does one pose questions about content, on consideration of\nvarious ways of construing that notion (see Siewert 2011 and Chudnoff\n2015). But when questions about the subjective experience of thinking\ndo join with questions about differences in what is\nthought—differences in content—assessment of the\nexternalist arguments about content (mentioned in Section 3) again\nbecome relevant. Somewhat as in the case of sense perception, thorny\nquestions arise about how to interpret envisaged scenarios in which\nthe subjective character of experience apparently remains\nconstant, while certain facts about one’s\nenvironment are varied in imagination (facts such\nas: which of a pair of “twin” objects is found there, what\ntype of hidden microstructure its natural kinds have, what linguistic\npractices are followed locally). Should we accept that subjective\ncharacter would be invariant across scenarios described in terms of\nsuch variations? If we do, should we take this, together with an\ninclusive attitude, to indicate that some differences in content\nare, and some are not, set with phenomenal\ncharacter? Or should we instead adopt an unqualified externalism that\nconcludes no sort of thought content supervenes on subjective\nexperience? Or, on the contrary, should we regard no fully\nextra-phenomenal differences as constituting genuine differences in\nwhat is thought? To thoroughly address questions about the phenomenal\ncharacter of thought and understanding, one needs to examine various\nnotions of thought content, and what theoretical role they are\nsupposed to serve.  \nFurther issues that seem to call for treatment in connection with the\nphenomenal character of thought include the following. How should we\nalign a view of this with an understanding of what concepts\nare (and what it is to possess them)? And, as part of this—how,\nif at all, could subjects’ concepts vary, even if the\ntotality of facts (including dispositional facts) regarding\nthe subjective character of their experience is held constant? How\nshould a sense of agency (and thought\n“authorship”), and differences among mental actions (e.g.,\njudging, doubting, merely considering) figure in our understanding of\nthe experience of thinking? And how is that experience related to the\nidea of a “fringe of consciousness”? \nFinally, we may note that this section’s issues raise important\nmethodological questions for the philosophy of consciousness\nespecially acutely. What role should reflection on one’s own\nexperience play in argument? And what role should interpretation\nof recent intellectual history have here? Regarding the first\nquestion: it has been suggested that if this sort of\nreflection—“introspection”—did have a\nlegitimate role to play, it should have easily resolved questions of\ncognitive phenomenology—as it evidently has not (Schwitzgebel\n2011). Against this, it has been argued that reflection on experience\nhas indeed a crucial place here, but its value depends on how well one\nhas framed the questions one puts to it and how good are the\nassumptions that guide one’s reflection—controversial\nmatters of philosophical quality we have no right to expect to be\neasily assessed (Siewert 2011). Regarding the place of historical\nunderstanding: one may wonder why (as noted earlier) separatist and\nrestrictive conceptions of consciousness—of the sorts that now\nmake inclusive views controversial—are so little in evidence in\nphenomenology, or even in early twentieth century analytic philosophy\nor psychology. How and why did the framework in which philosophers\nthink about consciousness shift? What can this tell us about the\ndialectical situation in which we currently find ourselves? (See\nCrane forthcoming.) \nOne could see the question of how consciousness relates to\nself-consciousness as opening up a further dimension of potential\ncognitive richness to investigate: here again one may contrast those\nwho find more and those who find less in\nexperience—the former finding in it this or that form of\nself-consciousness where the latter do not. But these issues\nexhibit a unity and complexity of their own, and an importance that\ncalls for separate treatment. To prepare to survey some ways they have\nfound expression in recent philosophy, we may recall three questions\nabout the alleged reflexivity of consciousness that were earlier\nidentified in phenomenological writings. The first asks in what sense\nif any, when there is a conscious state, there must be consciousness\nof it. The second asks whether it is only\noccasionally, in reflection, that a conscious state\nis simultaneously an intentional object for the one whose\nstate it is. Third, there is the question of whether consciousness\nordinarily somehow involves a non-reflective consciousness of\noneself—as subject. These questions may be seen in the\ncontext of understanding the consciousness-intentionality\nrelationship, insofar as self-consciousness may be considered a kind\nof intentional directedness either to one’s own states of mind,\nor one’s self, or perhaps, an aspect of conscious intentionality\ndirected at other things. \nIn recent analytic philosophy of mind, higher-order and\nself-representationalist theorists of consciousness (of the sort\nmentioned in Section 1) combine an affirmative answer to the first of\nthe three questions above with a negative answer to the second. Their\ntheories typically work from the idea it is a necessary to any\nconscious state that one who is in that state be conscious of\nit—where to say one is conscious of something implies it is\nsomehow an intentional, or represented object. In this respect they\nresemble Brentano, and are unlike Husserl and other phenomenologists\nin how they view the consciousness/self-consciousness relationship.\nBut unlike Brentano, they use this stance as the springboard for a\nreductive intentionalist theory of consciousness, ultimately to be put\nat the service of a physicalist conception of mind. What it is for a\nstate to be conscious can be fully explained by specifying the right\nsorts of representation and mental target—where what these are\ncan be ultimately cashed out in non-mental, non-intentional terms. If\none form of self-consciousness consists in being conscious of\none’s own states of mind—these reductive\nreflexivist theories could be said to claim that state consciousness\ngenerally is explained by being reduced to what we might call\n“state self-consciousness”.  \nThe advent of such theories accounts for much recent attention to the\nrelationship between one’s manner of being conscious of\none’s own conscious states and the fact that they are conscious.\nBut there are other reasons for interest. One may well think it is in\nthe nature of conscious states to be available for a distinctively\nfirst-person reflective self-consciousness—when they occur in\nbeings capable of reflection—and that this involves a form of\nthought that cannot arise in the absence of its object. This way of\ndrawing a close connection between consciousness and\nself-consciousness can be found, for example, in\n“acquaintance” theories of self-knowledge (Gertler 2012a)\nand certain interpretations of the notion of “phenomenal\nconcepts” (Chalmers 2010), as well as other accounts of how we\nknow our own minds (Smithies 2012a, Siewert 2012b, 2014). But these\nideas involve no commitment to claiming that what makes a state\nconscious is its being represented in a special way in the very mind\nto which it belongs. Their positive philosophical significance lies\nnot in supporting a reductive intentionalism, but in their efforts to\nelucidate the distinctive way we understand ourselves, grounded in an\ninterpretation of consciousness. \nHowever, it is suitable here to focus on theories that do hold that\nwhat makes a state conscious is being an object of the right sort of\nrepresentation, since these lie close to the concerns that have most\ndominated philosophy of mind over the last fifty years or so. And, in\nany case, they raise issues about the relationship of consciousness\nand self-consciousness whose interest goes beyond their immediate\nconnection with these theories. It will first be useful to note some\nof the different forms these theories may take. They differ, for\ninstance, on the question of whether the conscious-making\nrepresentation and its target are distinct states, or collapse into\none. The latter option identifies consciousness with a certain sort of\nmental self-representation (Kriegel 2009), while the\n“higher-order theory” label is sometimes reserved for\naccounts of the former type. Another important fork in the road for\nsuch accounts: whether they propose that the targeting representation\naims at its target in a “thought-like” manner, or in a\n“perception-like” manner. To take the first option is to\nendorse (like Rosenthal 1986, 1991, 1993, 2002b, and Weisberg 2011) a\n“higher-order thought” theory of consciousness; to take\nthe second, a “higher-order perception” (or an\n“inner sense”) theory (as is found in Armstrong 1968,\nCarruthers 2004, and Lycan 1995, 2004). Kriegel, for his part,\nentertains the idea that the right sort of targeting representation is\nproperly regarded as neither thought-like or sensory, but sui\ngeneris. Here it becomes clear how some distinction between what\nproperly belongs to thought, and what to the senses\n(in the last section seen to figure centrally in disputes about\ncognitive richness), also figures crucially in articulating and\nassessing different metacognitive theories of consciousness. \nSuch theories can also differ with respect to what they regard as a\nsuitable candidate state. Is any type of mental state fair game for\nbeing made conscious by being represented, or only sensory\n“qualitative” states? Here we see how higher-order and\nself-representationalist theories might make consciousness cognitively\nrich in one way (by including metacognition in it\nconstitutively), while making it cognitively sparse in\nanother (only sensory states need apply). \nProponents of such accounts sometimes explicitly deny that they aim to\nexplain the “qualitative character” of experience in terms\nof higher-order or self-representations. This might lead one to think\nthat they are not trying to give a theory of phenomenal\nconsciousness at all—on the assumption that a theory of that\nwould be a theory of “qualia”. However, they do\npurport to explain generally, in metarepresentational terms, what\nit’s like for one to be in a state of mind. And they\ndon’t appear to treat the phenomenal separately, under the\n“qualitative” label. This is especially clear when (as in\nRosenthal) qualitative states are illustrated by examples\ncommonly regarded as paradigmatically non-phenomenal: unfelt\npains, for example, and “blindsight” vision. Thus it seems\nfair to regard these accounts as proposing a reductive intentionalism\nabout phenomenal character—pursuing a reflexivist strategy\nanalogous to that noted in the non-reflexivist accounts of\nTye and Prinz. One starts with some way of classifying mental states\nthat is understood as applying to states of mind regardless of whether\nthere is anything it’s like for one to have\nthem—regardless of whether they have phenomenal character. Then,\nconsciousness (phenomenal character, subjective “what it’s\nlikeness”) is supplied by adding in further representational\nfactors—though in the reflexivist story, the extra ingredient\ncomes in having the states themselves be represented in the right way.\nSo, for example, in Rosenthal’s higher-order thought theory,\nwhat it is for a pain to feel to you as it does (and for it to feel to\nyou any way at all) is for you to have pain (of a type that can occur\nunfelt), when (seemingly without inference) the thought occurs to you\nthat you do. \nAn important inspiration for such theories lies in the idea that,\npre-theoretically or commonsensically, we are inclined to endorse the\nidea that conscious states are states we are conscious of. One takes\nthis to have the status of a necessary truth pertaining to all\nconscious states, and gives it a representationalist construal. This\nyields the starting point: some sort of higher-order or\nself-representation is necessary for a state to be conscious\nin a pre-theoretically recognized sense. We also have reason to\nbelieve mental states can occur unconsciously. So maybe: targeting\npotentially unconscious mental states with the right sort of\nrepresentation necessary for them to be conscious will also yield a\ncondition sufficient for them to be so, and reveal what it is\nto be a conscious state. \nSuch theories’ advocates also draw on interpretation of the idea\nthat conscious states are ones there is something it’s like for\nyou to be in—arguing that what it’s like for you to be in\na state is best construed in terms of how you represent that\nstate. (Carruthers 2004; Lycan 1995, 2004; Rosenthal 2002a,b).\nRosenthal argues his higher-order thought variant version of the view\nhas a particular advantage in this regard, since it can account for\nhow what it’s like for you to have sensory states can be\ntransformed, when you learn to classify sensory states via new\nconcepts (as, for example, when you learn to discriminate how wine\ntastes to you in a connoisseur’s terms). This transformation is\nbest explained, he argues, on the assumption that what you\nthink about your gustatory state just constitutes\nwhat it’s like for you to have it. \nAdditional arguments for metacognitive accounts of consciousness\nappeal to their alleged explanatory value. For example, Rosenthal\nargues that the fact that our conscious states comprise the part of\nthe our minds available for our first-person report is best explained\nby supposing they are always objects of thoughts of the kind such\nreports would express. And advocates of higher-order perception or\ninner sense versions of the metacognitive approach argue that such\nviews best explain our capacity to attend to our own experience\nintrospectively (Lycan 2004), and to form “recognitional\nconcepts” of our own sensory states (Carruthers 2004). \nThese strategies of argument have all occasioned criticism. One may\ndoubt whether commonsense really does support the requisite\ninterpretation of the idea on which the theories ground their appeal\n(i.e., the idea that conscious states are states we are conscious of)\n(Siewert 1998, 2013b; Prinz 2012). One may even doubt whether that\nidea should be endorsed on any construal; according to\nDretske 1995, conscious states are not states we are conscious\nof, but states we are conscious with. The\nmetacognitive interpretation of “what it’s like”\nlocution has also been criticized (see Byrne 2004 and Siewert 2013b),\nas have some of the above appeals to explanatory value (Siewert 1998,\n2012). And one may doubt whether reflection supports the sorts of\nself-attributions posited by the theory. With respect to the\nhigher-order thought theory: whenever I feel pain, does it in fact\noccur to me that I am in pain in Rosenthal’s sense (a sense in\nwhich one can be in pain without feeling anything)? With respect to\nthe inner sense view: when I feel nauseated, do I find there is some\nway the feeling is sensed, distinguishable both from how I\nfeel, and from what I think about it (Siewert 1998, 2012b)? \nOne venerable concern about metacognitive theories of consciousness\nfocuses on the prospect of an infinite regress. We have seen how\nBrentano addresses this concern, recently renewed in connection with\ncontemporary theories (see Kriegel 2009 and Siewert 2013b). The worry\nis roughly this. The theories assume we cannot be in a conscious state\nwithout being representationally or intentionally conscious\nof it. But it seems at least as compelling that an\nunconscious state cannot make one conscious of something. Putting both\nassumptions together appear to lead to the idea that every conscious\nstate must be represented by a conscious state that makes it\nconscious. But does this not generate a vicious infinite regress of\nrepresentations? Kriegel’s favored response resembles\nBrentano’s: we cut off the regress by means of the notion of\nself-representation: conscious states necessarily point at themselves,\nand the self-pointing is conscious—not by being the object of a\nfurther act of pointing—but by being one with what it points at.\nOther defenders of metacognitive approaches (Carruthers, Lycan,\nRosenthal) respond to the regress problem differently: they reject the\nintuition that you can’t be conscious of things by unconsciously\nperceiving them or thinking of them. So on Rosenthal’s view,\ntypically we are conscious of our vision (and it is conscious)\nbecause, as it occurs, we unconsciously think it does. \nAnother traditional line of criticism (also addressed by Brentano),\nspecifically targets the idea that all consciousness involves\n“thought-like” metacognition. Does such thought not\nrequire the ability to classify one’s own states of\nmind—to bring them under concepts? Such conceptualization seems\nto imply a level of cognitive sophistication one may doubt belongs to\nneonate human beings and many nonhuman animals. But in harboring such\ndoubts, we shouldn’t take ourselves to question whether these\ncreatures have any sensory consciousness at all—e.g., whether\ncolors look somehow to them, or whether they feel pain (Seager 2004;\nSiewert 1998). So we shouldn’t think consciousness requires\nhigher-order thought. In response, some would not flinch at simply\nkeeping the cognitive bar high for thought, and embrace doubts about\nanimals and babies feeling pain (Carruthers 1989). The other option is\nto set the metacognitive bar low. Brentano ([1874] 1973:\n141–142) took that route: again, for him judgment is the mere\naffirmation of a presented object. This requires nothing so fancy as\npredicating of the object affirmed something one takes it to share\nwith others. So there really is no cognitive ability involved in\njudgments aimed at one’s own sensory states that we can\nreasonably doubt young children possess. Rosenthal offers a different\nversion of the “low bar” response, proposing that it is\nenough to have lowgrade concepts of one’s own sensory states\nthat one can make certain fairly primitive nonverbal discriminatory\nresponses to them; the idea is that creatures apply such concepts to\nthemselves whenever they feel something. A question facing “low\nbar ” views is to explain why, if thought of sensation comes so\neasily, we should take it to be absent in cases of unconscious\nperception (such as blindsight, and unfelt pain). \nA final important source of challenges to metacognitive theories of\nconsciousness concerns the fallibility of the posited representations.\nWhat should we say when your higher-order or self-representation\nmisfires? If it misrepresents what sort of sensory state you\nare in, will the theory claim this makes you feel just as you do when\nactually in that sort of state? Will it say, for instance, that when\none falsely thinks one is in pain what this is like for one\nis the same as what it’s like to actually feel pain?\nSome critics—Block 2011, Neander 1998—regard the problems\nraised by misrepresentation as profound. From a Brentanian\nperspective, however, the envisaged problem simply cannot arise. The\ninevitable affirmation of one’s conscious sensation infallibly\naffirms it as presented, and it cannot be presented as other than it\nis—and, since such judgment does not really categorize\nthe sensation at all, it cannot miscategorize it. By\ncontrast, contemporary accounts tend to allow that the relevant form\nof metacognition can represent you to be in a sensory state you\naren’t actually in. They then seek to make acceptable what the\ntheories imply—for instance, that the way one feels can be\nconstituted out of false self-attributions of sensation, and that one\ncan feel pain by being conscious of pain, though there is in fact no\nstate of which one is thus conscious (see Rosenthal 2011; Weisberg\n2011). \nIn this section the issue of how consciousness is related to\nself-consciousness has been seen as a question of how it is related to\n“state self-consciousness”. But we may also see this issue\nas encompassing the question of how consciousness is related to\nconsciousness of self “as subject”—what we might\ncall “subject self-consciousness”—a question earlier\nbroached in the survey of prominent phenomenologists. Views on this\ntopic are discussed in the supplement\n Consciousness of Self. \nHow do views about consciousness, intentionality, and their\nrelationship impinge on the question of what it is to have a mind?\nGiven a thin enough conception of intentionality, we might readily\naccept that having intentionality hardly suffices for having a mind.\nAfter all, street signs, books, and computer files could be said to\nrepresent or refer to things, and whatever we want from a distinction\nbetween the minded and the mindless (or between what has and lacks\ngenuine understanding) we intend it to be more restrictive\nthan that. We may say that the intentionality of true minds\nis obviously a rather different matter than the intentionality of the\nsymbols that minded beings use. But still we may wonder\nexactly what makes for that difference. \nCould consciousness perhaps be what confers\n“minded” status? Given a paltry enough conception of\nconsciousness, it’s hard to see how it could—or even how\nit could be necessary to mind at all. If one thinks of consciousness\nas brute, non-intentional sensation, for instance, it may seem not to\nhave much to do with mind in any robust sense. But maybe if the right\nforms of consciousness are recognized, then these, rightly related to\nintentionality, will be enough to make a mind. If one sees\nconsciousness as sufficient for fairly rich and important forms of\nintentionality, one has some prospect for arguing that, since it alone\ncan endow what has it with intentionality of the right sort, only what\nhas it, has a mind. \nSuch a proposal requires we recognize some significant, “in\nkind” difference between the minded and the mindless, between\nthose capable of understanding and those devoid of comprehension. Such\nrecognition is not universal. On Dennett’s (1981) view, there is\nfundamentally nothing more to your being, as he puts it, “a true\nbeliever”—and thus nothing more ultimately to mind and\nunderstanding—than being interpretable by observers in the right\nway, via “the intentional stance”, so as to facilitate\nsuccessful predictions of your behavior. Dennett points out that even\nthe behavior of simple mechanisms like thermostats and natural\nphenomena like lightning can be regarded in this way. He of course\nrecognizes a significant psychological difference between human beings\nand such marginal case “intentional systems”. This is,\nhowever, conceived of as a (considerable) difference of degree. Given\nyour patterns of behavior, observers will be able to use much more\ncomplex intentional state attributions to predict what you\nwill do, so as to get a much bigger pay-off in predictive value, than\nthey will in other cases. But there is no more profound\ndivision among “intentional systems” than this, to be\nmarked by talking about what is conscious and what isn’t. For\nconsciousness is either just some mythical raw feel of\natomic, non-intentional, ineffable “qualia”, or else it\nhas to do with the fact that a predictive advantage accrues from\nregarding systems as possessed of some assortment of capacities, the\nexercise of at least some of which one is inclined to call\n“conscious”. But such differences are again a matter of\ndegree, and the capacities in question exhibit no deep unity (Dennett\n1991). \nHowever, many will think there is more to mind (and to consciousness)\nthan Dennett allows. In offering an alternative to his perspective,\none might try to locate a significant difference in kind between\nminded and mindless beings in something other than consciousness. Here\nhowever, we will briefly consider how one might put consciousness to\nwork. \nWays of making consciousness integral to mind are potentially very\ndiverse. The issue will look rather different, for example, depending\non whether one adopts this or that reductive intentionalist view.\nSuppose you hold that consciousness is reducible to states generated\nby sensory mechanisms, feeding the information they bear to certain\nother cognitive faculties. Then, to maintain consciousness is\nessential to mind, you would presumably need to maintain a broadly\nempiricist view that required such sensory input for mind. And a\nquestion would then arise about the sufficiency of\nconsciousness for mind—at least for mind at a human\nlevel—as one may doubt that such perception by itself brings\nwith it the requisite kind of understanding. On the other hand, if\none’s reductive representationalism appeals to some sort of\nhigher-order or self-representational account, one would need a\nconception of mind that explained why some such self-monitoring is\nnecessary to—and how it could be enough\nfor—mindedness. \nGenerally, recent views that (explicitly or implicitly) make\nconsciousness central to mind have tended not to base their arguments\non reductive intentionalism. Some relevant strategies of argument\nunreliant on reductivist accounts can be found under the rubric of\n“Phenomenal Intentionality Theory”. Such views aim to show\nhow all intentionality may be traced to phenomenal\nintentionality.  This approach trades on the idea that there is a difference\nbetween what comes by intentionality in some secondary or derivative\nway (as when an image or inscription is interpreted as referring to\nsomething), and what has intentionality in an original or more\nfundamental way. The proposal would be: consciousness, and only\nconsciousness, brings with it original intentionality. It\nwould be natural to assume further that only beings that have original\nintentionality truly have minds. \nConsider how this works in the case of Searle (1990, 1992). He\ndistinguishes between what he calls “intrinsic”\nintentionality on the one hand, and merely “as if” and\n“interpreter relative” intentionality, on the other. We\nsometimes may speak as if artifacts (like thermostats) had\nthoughts and wants (“Mr. Thermostat thinks it’s too warm\nin here”)—but this isn’t to be taken literally. And\nwe may impose conditions of satisfaction on our acts and creations\n(words, pictures, diagrams, etc.) by our interpretation of\nthem—but they have no intentionality independent of our\ninterpretive practices. The intentionality of mental states, on the\nother hand, is neither a mere manner of speech, nor is our possession\nof it derived from others’ interpretive stance towards us. But\nthen: what accounts for the fact that some states of affairs in the\nworld have intrinsic intentionality—that they are directed at\nobjects under aspects—and why they are directed under the\naspects they are (why they have the content they do)? With\nconscious states of mind, Searle says, their phenomenal or\nsubjective character determines their aspectual shape. Where\nnon-conscious states of mind are concerned, there is nothing to do the\njob but their relationship to consciousness. The right relationship,\nhe holds, is this: non-conscious states of mind must be potentially\nconscious. If some psychological theories (of language, of vision)\npostulate an unconscious so deeply buried that its mental\nrepresentations cannot even potentially become conscious, so much the\nworse for those theories. \nSearle’s views have aroused a number of criticisms. (See the\npeer commentary in response to Searle 1990.) Among the problem areas\nare these. First, how are we to spell out the requirement that\nintrinsically intentional states be potentially conscious, without\nmaking it either too easy or to difficult to satisfy? Second, just why\nis it that the intrinsic intentionality of non-conscious states needs\naccounting for, while that of conscious states is somehow\nunproblematic? Third, it appears Searle’s argument does not\noffer some general reason to rule out all efforts to give\n“naturalistic” accounts of conditions sufficient to\nimpose—without the help of consciousness—genuine and not\nmerely interpreter relative intentionality. \nKriegel’s 2011 version of Phenomenal Intentionality Theory\npursues a line of thought significantly like Searle’s. Drawing a\ndistinction between original and interpreter-relative intentionality,\nhe argues consciousness is the sole locus of the former: consciousness\n“injects intentionality into the world”. However, unlike\nSearle, Kriegel has consciousness confer intentionality both on\notherwise meaningless symbols and on unconscious mental or cognitive\nlife in much the same way. What has nonexperiential intentionality\ngets its aboutness by being such as would be seen to have it in the\nexperience of an “ideal interpreter”. Kriegel, in effect,\ntakes the sort of “interpretivist” view of intentionality\nadvocated by Dennett, while (unlike Dennett) confining it to cases\nwhere consciousness is missing. Thus it seems he should want to reject\ntheories like Dennett’s that purport to account for\nconsciousness in terms of intentional or representational notions that\ndo not presuppose it. This creates a difficulty, inasmuch as Kriegel\nalso proposes a self-representationalist account of consciousness that\nseems to follow that general reductive representationalist strategy.\nHe responds to this problem by distinguishing the sort of natural (or\nobjective) “tracking” mental representation that figures\nas a posit in psychological theorizing from the sort of mental\nrepresentation we are familiar with from reflection on our own minds,\nwith its susceptibility to the appearance/reality distinction.\nConsciousness, Kriegel argues, is what accounts for the latter. \nThere are a number of other ways in which one might account for\nmindedness in terms of consciousness that invoke some contrast between\na kind of intentionality that is original or basic, and kinds that are\neither derived or merely “as if”.  But there are also\nconsciousness-based accounts of mind that do not depend on a\nderived/underived intentionality distinction. Consider, for example,\nthe argument proposed by Kirk Ludwig (1996a). He argues that\nconsciousness is needed to rightly draw the boundaries of an\nindividual’s mind—for there is nothing to determine\nwhose state of mind a given non-conscious state of mind is,\nunless that state consists in a disposition to produce a conscious\nmental state of the right sort. Alleged mental processes that did not\ntend to produce someone’s conscious states of mind appropriately\nwould be no one’s, which is to say that they would not be mental\nstates at all. Roughly: consciousness provides the unity of mind\nwithout which there would be no mind. Only with consciousness do we\nhave a suitable boundary between what’s in a mind, and\nwhat’s outside of it. And Ludwig argues that it is therefore a\nmistake to attribute to our minds many of the unconscious\ninferences with which psychological theorists have long been wont to\npopulate the brain’s visual system. \nAnother approach that find consciousness at the root of mind is\nsuggested by Declan Smithies (2012b). Smithies picks up on the sort of\ndistinction highlighted by Kriegel, between the kind of mental\nintentionality we attribute to ourselves, and the kind that figures in\ncognitivist theorizing about vision and language processing. Smithies,\nhowever, focuses on this as a distinction between personal and\nsubpersonal levels, and makes no use of the derived/underived\nintentionality contrast. He argues that, intuitively, vision without\nconsciousness (specifically, blindsight) fails to furnish a subject\nwith the understanding of demonstrative reference, hence thought about\nperceptual particulars, that is provided when one consciously\nsees what is spoken of/thought about. Partly on this basis, he\nconcludes that the sort of mental states—like belief—that\nare attributable to whole persons depend on consciousness. If we\nindulge the notion of beings behaviorally similar to us, but,\nlike Chalmersian zombies, utterly bereft of subjective\nexperience—we should not suppose they would literally have\npersonal-level psychology: they would have no genuine beliefs, but at\nmost act as if they did. \nA partly similar perspective is found in Siewert 2014 who uses\nconsideration of blindsight scenarios to argue that the only\nperception that will supply the mind with an understanding of\ntype demonstratives (e.g., “this shape”) and so\nbe capable of functioning in empirical concept acquisition, is the\nexperiential, conscious kind. (If this shape looks no way to\nyou at all, you will not understand by vision just which\nshape this shape is, and thus won’t be in a position to\nlearn visually, e.g., this shape is a circle.) Partly on\nthese grounds it is argued that mind requires consciousness. And given\na cognitively rich view of experience, we can see how consciousness\n(of the right sort) will be sufficient for mind as well. Both\nSmithies’ and Siewert’s views (like Searle’s) rely\ncrucially on the idea that the difference between the presence and\nabsence of understanding should be discernible from the first-person\npoint of view. Doubts about them are likely to challenge the\nlegitimacy of that reliance (see, e.g., Shoemaker’s 1994\ncriticism of Searle).  \nConsciousness and intentionality are inherently fascinating. But no\ndoubt part of their interest lies in the sense that understanding them\nis crucial to understanding much else. And an adequate grasp of what\nis at stake in views about them may be lost in the abstract matrix of\npositions generated in this survey (“reductive restrictive\nreflexivist” etc.). Perhaps these views will themselves also\nbecome a little clearer if we summarize and make explicit a few of\ntheir connections with the following four broad areas of philosophical\nconcern. \nLet’s take each of these briefly in turn. First: “the\nnature and boundaries of mind and self”. Here we may be\ninterested in questions about: (a) what distinguishes minded from\nmindless beings; (b) what unifies the domain of the mental; (c) how\nfar beyond the brain of a minded organism its mind (its\nmental content, or its mental states or processes) properly speaking\nextend, and what are their constituents; (d) what\nsorts of non-mental constraints (in constitution or organization)\nlimit the range of minded beings; and finally (e) what constitutes a\nself (e.g., what is required for its existence and continuity, how\nthis relates to the organism, and to its social and natural\nenvironment). \nTopics (a) and (c)—what makes a minded being differ from a\nminded one, and what its properly mental content and activity extend\nto encompass—have evident connections with topic (b): the unity\nof the mental. For presumably a minded being will be one whose states\nhave “mental content” and whose activities are properly\nmental or psychological in character; to decide what those contents\nand activities include will be to decide not only what is part of its\nmind, but also what puts something in the domain of the mental at all.\nFurther, insofar as such boundaries of mind also mark\nboundaries of self (or person or psychological\nsubject—however these categories are to be related)—we\nwill find topics (a-c) closely related to topic (e)—regarding\nthe constitution, continuity and situatedness of self. \nAs we have seen, disputes over the consciousness-intentionality\nrelationship are strongly tied to all these “boundary\ndrawing” questions. As some rough indication (and reminder) of\nthe connections, we may note, first, that it is difficult to see how a\nunified conception of mind (or of its extent) can be had on strongly\nnon-intentionalist, separatist views, which suggest a deeply\nbifurcated conception of the domain of the mental. Even if one does\nnot embrace separatism, one may wish to draw the boundaries of the\nconscious mind much further “in” than those of\nthe extended mind. Whichever way one goes, questions emerge\nabout where this leaves the self. And turning back to the\nminded vs. mindless question—a rejection of separatism still\nleaves one with the prospect of a division between two rather\ndifferent kinds of mind (conscious and “zombie”). Views on\nwhich no being totally lacking in consciousness would have a mind will\navoid such disunity. \nQuestions about (d)—the potential constitution and range of\nrealizations of mind—seem to depend partly on one’s\nattitude towards reductive intentionalism. This is readily joined with\nbroadly functionalist or computationalist perspectives friendly to the\nidea that mind is realizable in physically very diverse entities. If\nindeed it is, then a confidence in reductive intentionalism should\ninspire confidence in the wide diversity of constitutions that\nartificial conscious beings can have, and similarly confident of the\npotential to extend our own conscious existence in artifacts\ntranscending our biological limitations. On the other hand, if we\nreject or are skeptical about reductive intentionalism, reason for\nsuch confidence diminishes. And if we combine this with the idea that\nthe right kind of subjective experience is necessary and sufficient\nfor mind, a corresponding biological conservatism about the\nphysical diversity of mind realizations, and about our own prospects\nfor indefinitely artificially extended futures, will likely seem\nreasonable. \nBut these statements need qualification. For one thing, once the\ndetails of an acceptable reductive intentionalism about consciousness\nemerge, it could turn out that—as a matter of natural\nfact—something very like the biological organization found in\nourselves and other animals is needed for its realization, so it could\nturn out that consciousness is not as independent of neurophysiology\nas functionalist theories often suggest (consider Prinz’s 2012\n“neurofunctionalism”). On the other hand, one could reject\nreductionism of any sort about consciousness, while still arguing on\nindependent grounds (like Chalmers 1996) that, as a matter of natural\n(though not metaphysical) necessity, the realization of consciousness\nis very loosely physically constrained. And then there are panpsychist\nviews to consider (Strawson 2006). If there is no genuinely non-mental\nor at least non-phenomenal reality to be found even in particle\nphysics, then the whole “diversity of realization”\nquestion will have to reconfigured. Perhaps the question then will be\nsomething like: which mental or experiential properties can emerge\nfrom which others, and how? \nFrom this sketch, we can see something of how “nature and\nboundaries of mind and self” questions associated with earlier\ncanvassed issues about consciousness and intentionality gain\nsignificant interest from concerns about what (if anything)\nunifies the field of study that we label “the\nmind”—the domain of the “mental” or\n“psychological”—and about how we should regard the\nprospects for engineering new minds or radical\nextensions of our own. \nBut to limit ourselves to these remarks may be to neglect another\n(albeit related) dimension to the interest of these “nature and\nboundaries of mind and self” questions, one perhaps more evident\nin the phenomenological tradition—an inherent interest in\nunderstanding what sort of beings we are. If being minded (or\nbeing capable of understanding) is essential to what we are, the\nquestion of how consciousness figures in mind (or understanding) is\nalso a question of how it figures in our nature. And, if a\nsatisfactory philosophical conception of what sort of beings we are\ninvolves a grasp of how our consciousness reveals to us ourselves and\nthe world, “boundary” questions about its detachability\nfrom our natural and social environments take on an additional\ndimension of interest. To answer them, we need also to address the\nthemes of basic forms and reflexivity. If (as some\nphenomenologists’ views suggest) a pre-predicative,\npre-reflective, practical understanding undetachable from the world is\npart of what makes us what we are, we may need to recognize the\nundetachability of our intentional consciousness. And if the right\nconception of basic forms and reflexivity sees us as essentially\nembodied understanders (as in Merleau-Ponty’s view), we should\nperhaps be suspicious of hopes or plans to keep our minds and leave\nour bodies behind. Further, we need to see—against this\nbackground—what kind of distinctive self-understanding\nreflective self-consciousness makes possible, if this is also\npart of what we are. We need to ask how much this sort of\nself-consciousness can do to detach us from social roles and\npractices, and what room this allows for authenticity, autonomy and\nself-constitution. (This brings us to issues prominent in Heidegger\nand Sartre—but also, in Korsgaard, and in Kantian moral\npsychology generally.) \nLet’s now consider the second of the four areas labeled above,\nthe “place of consciousness and intentionality in\nexplanation.” This is intended to cover questions about\nwhat should be taken (or sought) to explain each of them, as well as\nabout what they should be used to explain. It should be clear now\nroughly how a reductive intentionalist would configure these issues.\nConsciousness is to be explained as a form of intentionality (or\nmental representation) that can be characterized without primitive\nappeal to experiential notions (like “looking” or\n“appearing”)—and the facts about representation can\nin turn be explained without primitive appeal to intentional or\nrepresentational notions. But it would be too simple to think that\nreductive intentionalists in no sense explain intentionality in terms\nof consciousness, or that non-reductive intentionalists in no sense\nexplain consciousness in terms of intentionality. As we have seen, it\nis open to both to say (albeit in very different ways) that what makes\nfor the intentionality of mind is the special kind of representation\nthat consciousness is. And both can say (in a very different ways)\nthat to understand how consciousness figures in mindedness, one must\nunderstand in what ways it is intentional. \nWhat we think consciousness can account for would seem to vary with\nhow cognitively rich we think experience is, and whether it figures in\nunderstanding generally, or in grounding a substantial “in\nkind” distinction between the minded and the mindless. (For\ninstance, it is hard to see how a strongly separatist\nposition would allow us to explain very much in terms of\nconsciousness.) And our answers to questions about richness affect our\nview of how consciousness is to be explained. For example, certain\ninclusions and restrictions on what’s in consciousness are\npresupposed in reductive intentionalist theories—to question\ntheir views of how consciousness is limited is to question the\nexplanations of it they offer. \nThe second “explanation” category also encompasses\nquestions about how to see non-mental nature explaining mind.\nPhysicalism generally seems committed to saying the former strongly\nnecessitates the latter—and does not merely guarantee it in\nvirtue of contingent laws. Typically this claim has been motivated by\nthe worry that anything less than strong (“metaphysical”)\nnecessities would leave mind a superfluous add-on, disturbingly\nineffectual or epiphenomenal; our minds would not really explain our\nactions and their results. And that it seems would leave us with no\ncoherent conception of our place in the world that we can live with.\nIt is often thought that consciousness is the real sticking point\nhere: that is what makes it hard to secure the strong form of\nnecessitation desired, or to put to explanatory use such necessity as\nwe have grounds to think is there. These difficulties are articulated\nin modal conceivability arguments (Kripke 1972; Chalmers 1996); in\n“knowledge” arguments (Nagel 1976; Jackson 1982); in\narguments for the “explanatory gap” (Levine 2001); and in\nthe case for a “mysterianism” about how consciousness\narises (McGinn 1991). Controversies about whether we can justify the\nclaim that the right combination of non-mental facts or properties\nmakes it the case that mind must occur, and about whether\nthis affords us explanations of the facts of mind, will take\ndifferent forms, depending on how one conceives of the\nconsciousness-intentionality relationship. \nHere again, a separatist position would seem to accord concerns about\nconsciousness the least general import—though one may\n(like Kim 2011) argue that by closing off the prospect of reductive\nintentionalism, separatism would have us resign ourselves to an\nirreducible, epiphenomenal “mental residue” of qualia. But\nif one is an intentionalist, then the problems of consciousness will\nspread to the intentionality of our minds, and will apparently cut\nmore deeply, the richer one takes experience to be in intentionality.\nAnd if one accounts for the minded/mindless difference in terms of\nconsciousness, then whatever metaphysical problem consciousness raises\nwill affect the mind quite generally. Thus the stakes will evidently\nbe higher in deciding whether we can secure the controversial\n“bottom-up” necessitation of consciousness, and whether\nsecuring this could secure, or is needed to secure,\na place for consciousness in nature—either as explanans\nor explanandum. To deny that it is needed is not\nnecessarily to foreswear the goal of scientifically explaining facts\nabout consciousness, or to embrace the supernatural. It is just to\nallow that such principles as we can appeal to in explaining what sort\nof consciousness arises, in what circumstances, are ones we must\nconfess might have been otherwise than they are. (But—why these\nprinciples aren’t in fact otherwise ultimately has no\nexplanation.) The epiphenomenalist worry may then still rear its head:\naren’t physicalist necessities required if experience is itself\nto explain anything that happens in the physical world? One’s\nanswer will depend on just what one thinks generally needs to be the\ncase for what happens in the physical world to receive legitimate\nexplanations that don’t belong to physics. \nTurning now to the third category, “forms of knowledge and\njustification”: our questions here concern the epistemic\nsignificance of consciousness. What role does consciousness have\nin knowledge acquisition, in understanding, and in warranting\njudgments? One might argue that it has none (Lee 2014). If we cannot\nrule out the possibility of beings functionally like us (but\nphysically different) that lack consciousness (this kind of\n“zombie”), we should arguably admit that such zombie\ncounterparts would have minds, and then: that the consciousness-free\nepistemology accounting for their knowledge would have all that\nany epistemology really needs. In response to this, one could\nargue (as in Section 8) that nothing that utterly lacked consciousness\nwould really understand anything or have a mind—so there is no\n“zombie epistemology”. Alternatively (or in addition) one\ncould argue that we shouldn’t assume the epistemology of\nconscious beings like ourselves would be no different than the\nepistemology (assuming there is one) applicable to such hypothetical\nbeings. \nIf pre-emptive challenges to the epistemic significance of\nconsciousness can be met, other issues arise to which the\nconsciousness-intentionality relationship appear relevant. To take\nfirst the question of our knowledge of our surroundings: we want to\nsay sense perception plays a role in this. But what role is played by\nsensory consciousness in our account would seem to depend on\nhow we see that as related to intentionality. As in the other cases,\nthe potential importance of consciousness seems diminished by\nseparatism. Thus we have the Davidsonian view that suggests subjective\nexperience, consisting just in sensations, can play only a causal, and\nno justificatory role in support of perceptual judgments (Davidson\n1982, 1986). Against this, we have the McDowellian argument in favor\nof conceptual content for sensory experience: only if it is this\nrichly cognitive can it play the epistemic role we rightly assume it\ndoes (McDowell 1994). But this suggests difficult questions (of the\nsort canvassed in Section 5) about how to justify an assessment of the\nrichness of phenomenal character. \nDifferent views on the theme of basic forms of intentionality will\nface different challenges in accounting for the sources of our\nknowledge, or of warrant for our mundane beliefs about the things we\nfind around us. Roughly, it might seem that in certain respects, the\nstory of justification will be easier, the more the intentionality of\nsensory experience is assimilated to that of full-blown\nconcept-applying judgment or belief—inasmuch as it seems\nunmysterious how beliefs justify beliefs. On the other hand, going\nvery far in that direction can bring puzzles of its own. It seems that\nsense experience should be of the right sort to enable us to\nacquire concepts (which assumes we don’t\nalready have them), and to support our\napplying concepts to things (which assumes we haven’t\nalready done so). But it may seem harder to maintain these\nassumptions, if we make sensory experience itself a kind of judgment\nor belief (see the discussion in Siegel and Silins 2015). \nTreatments of detachability may also have epistemic\nimplications. Some (e.g., John Campbell 2002) have argued that we\ncan’t do justice to the role of sense experience in providing\nknowledge of the particulars in our surroundings, unless we regard the\nexperience (and even its subjective character) as essentially\n“object-dependent”. On the other hand, one may wonder if\none can do justice to the subjectivity of experience, its perspectival\nand error-prone nature, while maintaining some form of\nobject-dependence. Consideration of Husserl’s and\nMerleau-Ponty’s views on perceptual experience, and discussion\nof contemporary disjunctivism’s treatment of illusion and\nhallucination, engages with this aspect of the epistemic significance\nof consciousness. \nHow one sees the relationship of consciousness to intentionality will\nalso shape what account one can give of “introspective”\nself-knowledge. That is, it will bear on our accounts of how we know\nor have warrant for judgments about our own states of mind. One will\nlikely think the difference between what is conscious and what\nisn’t makes some difference to what one can know of one’s\nown mind in a distinctively first-person way. Roughly, what’s\nconscious would seem to be more directly knowable introspectively. But\nholding either a separatist or strongly restrictivist view would\nappear to limit the role consciousness can play in one’s account\nof self-knowledge. For example, Carruthers’ view of\nconsciousness restricts it almost entirely to nonconceptual sensory\nstates and patterns of imagery, and correspondingly limits\ndistinctively first-personal self-knowledge: beyond these confines of\nconsciousness, your epistemic relation to your mental life—to\nhow and what you are thinking, for example—is held to be\nbasically the same as it is to another’s (Carruthers 2011).\nAlternatively, one might think that your knowledge of your own\nthoughts is also fundamentally and distinctively\nfirst-personal—but in a very different (perhaps\n“rationalist”) way than knowledge of your own sense\nexperience and imagery: knowing one’s own mind comes in two\nquite different varieties (Moran 2001; Boyle 2009). However, assuming\nan inclusive conception of experience, it will be more open to\nmaintain that consciousness accounts in a partly similar way for\nself-knowledge, regardless of whether it is one’s own\nsensing or thinking that is known. \nClearly too, understanding the relationship of consciousness to\nself-consciousness with respect to the reflexivity theme will play an\nimportant role in determining what to say about self-knowledge. For\ninstance, proponents of higher-order thought or inner sense theories\nof consciousness will have different strategies available in\naccounting for the special self-knowledge consciousness affords (and\nface different challenges) than those who reject these accounts. For\nexample, obviously, one cannot offer an inner sense account of\nself-knowledge if one thinks there is no inner sense. And if one does\nbelieve in inner sense, special questions arise about how to account\nfor the possibility of introspective error and self-correction. Also,\neven if one distinguishes consciousness from state self-consciousness,\none may think that consciousness makes possible a form of\nself-consciousness—a first-person form of reflection—with\ndistinctive epistemic properties (as, e.g., in Gertler 2012a; Siewert\n2012). We might note further that having a rich conception of\nconsciousness, and putting this to work in a unified and comprehensive\naccount of introspective self-knowledge fits naturally into an\n“internalist” view of justification: if, as an\ninternalist, you think that what justifies your judgments needs to be\nappropriately available to you, a consciousness-based conception of\nself-knowledge may seem tailor-made to tell us what “appropriate\navailability” comes to here. (See Smithies 2014.) \nFinally, a few words about the fourth topic mentioned above: how our\nviews of consciousness and intentionality might affect the kind of\nvalue we recognize. What kind of value do we see in\nexperience? It will not be unusual to think it has for us a\nnon-instrumental (and in that sense “intrinsic”) value.\nOne way to make this explicit: consider what goods you think your own\nexperience brings you, which you could conceive of getting without\nit—in an experience-less, “zombified” state. Would\nyou still much rather have experience than not, even on the condition\nthat without it, all the goods you think it provides that\ncould be had without it, were in fact available? An answer\n“yes” seems to indicate you accord conscious experiences\nsome kind of non-instrumental value. Another question: do you think\nsomething very bad has happened if your own or another person’s\nexistence is terminated, even if you (or they) are replaced with an\nexact duplicate? If you say yes, does the badness of such an\nextinction-plus-replacement scenario remain, presuming that prior to\nit, the person’s consciousness has already been\ntotally and permanently extinguished? Suppose you say\nno—the truly terrible part to this story comes at the stage\nwhere one is utterly and forever “zombified”; after\nthat, nothing of significant non-instrumental value remains\nto be destroyed by the envisaged replacement. This suggests that for\nyou the kind of irreplaceable value you accord particular\npersons is essentially tied to the non-instrumental value experience\nhas for you (Siewert 1998, 2014). Intuitive responses to such\nscenarios appear to bring to the surface convictions about the kind of\nnon-instrumental value consciousness has (and conscious beings have)\nfor us. But how should we relate this to our views about consciousness\nand intentionality? \nIt seems open still to hold to the value-revealing responses just\nimagined, even if one divorces consciousness from intentionality, or\nmaintains that experience lacks the kind of cognitive richness\ninvolved in conceptual understanding. However, it would then appear\nthat the value you accord consciousness would be importantly detached\nfrom whatever non-instrumental value you accord the exercise of\nunderstanding. And questions would arise about how, on such a view,\nthere could be a valuable pleasure in that exercise, and\nabout how one could continue to tie the irreplaceable value of\npersons to consciousness. In general, giving high intrinsic\nvalue to consciousness and reserving the irreplaceable value of\npersons for conscious beings will likely seem easier, the richer one\ntakes experience to be. \nBut even then we may wonder whether, if consciousness—no matter\nhow rich—is strictly inessential to mindedness, we\nshould really care about it so much. On the view proposed by Neil Levy\n(2014), it is assumed that zombies could have minds possessed of\nrational understanding, desires and interests—and so their\nwell-being would count in considerations of value no less or\ndifferently than that of conscious beings. Thus he maintains (by a\nreasoning that parallels Lee’s epistemological deflation of\nconsciousness): even in our own case (phenomenal) consciousness is\nincidental to value. But again, one may contest the assumption of\nzombie minds. And even if one does not, it may well seem that, when it\ncomes to entities that can have no subjective experience of\nfrustration or satisfaction, it should not much matter to us whether\nthey get what they are alleged to want, except insofar as we happen\nindependently to want it ourselves. \nThere is surely much more to say about how views of the\nconsciousness-intentionality relationship bear on large questions\nabout mind, self, explanation, knowledge and value. But what has just\nbeen said hopefully brings out some prominent features of the\nphilosophical landscape.","contact.mail":"charles.siewert@rice.edu","contact.domain":"rice.edu"}]
