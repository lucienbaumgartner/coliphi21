The aim of that struggle was to secure the\nstatus of equal citizenship in a liberal democratic state. Civil\nrights are the basic legal rights a person must possess in order to\nhave such a status. They are the rights that constitute free and equal\ncitizenship and include personal, political, and economic rights. No\ncontemporary thinker of significance holds that such rights can be\nlegitimately denied to a person on the basis of race, color, sex,\nreligion, national origin, or disability. By contrast, among the\nissues contested at present are those concerning whether the\nlaw-enforcement practice of racial profiling is justifiable, how to\nprotect the equal right to vote of racial minorities, and whether the\nright to marry should be extended to same-sex partners. In addition,\nthere is an extensive literature debating the philosophical and\npractical issues raised by the right of the disabled to equal\ncitizenship.\n\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, civil rights were\nusually distinguished from ‘political rights’. The former\nincluded the rights to own property, make and enforce contracts,\nreceive due process of law, and worship one’s religion. Civil\nrights also covered freedom of speech and the press (Amar 1998:\n216–17). But they did not include the right to vote or to hold\npublic office. The latter were political rights, reserved to adult\nmales. Accordingly, the woman’s emancipation movement of the\n19th century, which aimed at full sex equality under the law, pressed\nfor equal “civil and political equality” (Taylor\n1851/1984: 397 emphasis added) \nThe civil-political distinction was conceptually and morally unstable\ninsofar as it was used to sort citizens into different categories. It\nwas part of an ideology that classified women as citizens entitled to\ncertain rights but not to the full panoply to which men were entitled.\nAs that ideology broke down, the civil-political distinction began to\nunravel. The idea that a certain segment of the adult citizenry could\nlegitimately possess one bundle of rights, while another segment would\nhave to make do with an inferior bundle, became increasingly\nimplausible. In the end, the civil-political distinction could not\nsurvive the cogency of the principle that all citizens of a liberal\ndemocracy were entitled, in Rawls’s words, to “a fully\nadequate scheme of equal basic liberties” (2001: 42). \nIt may be possible to retain the distinction strictly as one for\nsorting rights, rather than sorting citizens (Marshall, 1965; Waldron\n1993). But it is difficult to give a convincing account of the\nprinciples by which this sorting is done. It seems neater and cleaner\nsimply to think of civil rights as the general category of basic\nrights needed for free and equal citizenship. Yet, it remains a matter\nof contention which claims are properly conceived as belonging to the\ncategory of civil rights (Wellman 1999). Analysts have distinguished\namong “three generations” of civil rights claims and have\nargued over which claims ought to be treated as true matters of civil\nrights. \nThe claims for which the American civil rights movement initially\nfought belong to the first generation of civil rights claims. Those\nclaims included the pre-20th century set of civil rights\n— such as the rights to receive due process and to make and\nenforce contracts — but covered political rights as well.\nHowever, many thinkers and activists argued that these\nfirst-generation claims were too narrow to define the scope of free\nand equal citizenship. They contended that such citizenship could be\nrealized only by honoring an additional set of claims, including\nrights to food, shelter, medical care, and employment. This second\ngeneration of economic “welfare rights,” the argument\nwent, helped to ensure that the political, economic, and legal rights\nbelonging to the first generation could be made effective and that the\nvital interests of all citizens were protected. Accordingly, Martin\nLuther King, Jr. wrote, “With Selma and the Voting Rights Act\none phase of development in the civil rights revolution came to an\nend,” and “[a] new phase opened” which would seek a\nmassive national investment in “programs to fight poverty,\nignorance and slums.(1967: 3 and 6). \nYet, some scholars have argued that these second-generation rights\nshould not be subsumed under the category of civil rights. Thus,\nCranston writes, ”The traditional ‘political and civil\nrights’ can…be readily secured by legislation. Since the\nrights are for the most part rights against government\ninterference…the legislation needed had to do no more than\nrestrain the executive’s own arm. This is no longer the case\nwhen we turn to the ‘right to work’, the ‘right to\nsocial security’ and so forth“ (1967: 50–51). \nHowever, Cranston fails to recognize that such first-generation rights\nas due process and the right to vote also require substantial\ngovernment action and the investment of considerable public resources.\nHolmes and Sunstein (1999) have made the case that all of the\nfirst-generation civil rights require government to do more than\nsimply ”restrain the executive’s own arm.“ It seems\nproblematic to think that a significant distinction can be drawn\nbetween first and second-generation rights on the ground that the\nformer, but not the latter, simply require that government refrain\nfrom interfering with the actions of persons. Moreover, even if some\nviable distinction could be drawn along those lines, it would not\nfollow that second-generation rights should be excluded from the\ncategory of civil rights. The reason is that the relevant standard for\ninclusion as a civil right is whether a claim is part of the package\nof rights constitutive of free and equal citizenship. There is no\nreason to think that only those claims that can be ”readily\nsecured by legislation“ belong to that package. And the\nincreasingly dominant view is that welfare rights are essential to\nadequately satisfying the conditions of free and equal citizenship\n(Marshall 1965; Waldron 1993; Sunstein 2001). \nIn the United States, however, the law does not treat issues of\neconomic well-being per se as civil rights matters. Only insofar as\neconomic disadvantage is linked to race, gender or some other\ntraditional category of antidiscrimination law is it considered to be\na question of civil rights. In legal terms, poverty is not a\n”suspect classification.“ By contrast, welfare rights are\nprotected as a matter of constitutional principle in other\ndemocracies. For example, section 75 of the\n Danish Constitution\n provides that ”any person unable to support himself or his\ndependents shall, where no other person is responsible for his or\ntheir maintenance, be entitled to receive public assistance.“\n \nA third generation of claims has received considerable attention in\nrecent years, what may be broadly termed ”rights of cultural\nmembership.“ These include language rights for members of\ncultural minorities and the rights of indigenous peoples to preserve\ntheir cultural institutions and practices and to exercise some measure\nof political autonomy. There is some overlap with the first-generation\nrights, such as that of religious liberty, but rights of cultural\nmembership are broader and more controversial. \nArticle 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\n(see Other Internet Resources) declares that third-generation rights\nought to be protected: \nSimilarly, the\n Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\n protects the language rights of minorities, and section 27 provides\nthat ”This Charter shall be interpreted in a manner consistent\nwith the preservation and enhancement of the multicultural heritage of\nCanadians.“ In the United States, there is no analogous\nprotection of language rights or multiculturalism, although\nconstitutional doctrine does recognize native Indian tribes as\n”domestic dependent nations“ with some attributes of\npolitical self-rule, such as sovereign immunity\n (Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe).\n  \nThere is substantial philosophical controversy over the legitimacy and\nscope of rights of cultural membership. Kymlicka has argued that the\nliberal commitment to protect the equal rights of individuals requires\nsociety to protect such rights, suitably defined (1989; 1994; 1995).\nHe distinguishes among three sorts of rights that have been claimed as\npart of this third generation by various groups whose culture differs\nfrom the dominant culture of a country: (1) rights of self-government,\ninvolving a claim to a degree of political autonomy to be exercised\nthrough the minority culture’s own of institutions, (2)\npolyethnic rights, involving special claims by members of the minority\nculture to facilitate their integration into mainstream institutions\nand practices, and (3) representational rights, involving a special\nclaim of the minority culture to have its members serve in\nlegislatures and other political bodies of the broader society (1995:\n27–33). Kymlicka argues that these three sorts of group rights\ncan, in principle, be justified for those populations that he\ndesignates as ”national minorities,“ such as native\nAmericans in the United States and the Québécois and\nAboriginals in Canada. A national minority is ”an\nintergenerational community, more or less institutionally complete,\noccupying a given territory or homeland, [and] sharing a distinct\nlanguage and history“(18). Kymlicka contends that\n”granting special representational rights, land claims, or\nlanguage rights to a [national] minority … can be seen as\nputting … [it] on a more equal footing [with the majority], by\nreducing the extent to which the smaller group is vulnerable to the\nlarger“ (36–37). Such special rights do not involve\ngranting to the national minority the authority to take away any of\nthe civil rights of its members. Rather, the rights are\n”external protections,“ providing the group with powers\nand immunities with which it can protect its culture against the\npotentially harmful decisions of the broader society (35). \nAccording to Kymlicka, In contrast to national minorities (and\nrefugees), most immigrants have left their original cultures\nvoluntarily and so are entitled only to a much more limited set of\ngroup rights. These ”polyethnic rights“are claims to have\ncertain adjustments or accommodations made in the prevailing laws and\nregulations so as give individuals access to the social mainstream.\nThus, Kymlicka thinks that Orthodox Jews in the U.S. Armed Forces\nshould have the legal right to wear a yarmulke while on duty and\nCanadian Sikhs have a legitimate claim to be exempt from motorcycle\nhelmet laws (31). \nWaldron (1995) criticizes Kymlicka for exaggerating the importance to\nthe individual of membership in her particular culture and for\nunderestimating the mutability and interpenetration of cultures.\nKymlicka emphasizes that individual freedom requires some cultural\ncontext that constitutes the meaningful options from which the\nindividual can choose her path in life. However, Waldron responds that\nsuch freedom does not require the preservation of the particular\ncontext in which the individual finds herself. Liberal individuals\nmust be prepared to evaluate their culture and to distance themselves\nfrom it. \nKukathas criticizes Kymlicka for implying that the liberal commitment\nto the protection of individual rights is insufficient to treat the\ninterests of minorities with equal consideration. Kukathas contends\nthat ”we need to reassert the importance of individual liberty\nor individual rights and question the idea that cultural minorities\nhave collective rights“ (1995: 230). But the system of uniform\nlegal rules that he endorses would keep the state from intervening\neven when a minority culture inflicts significant harm on its more\nvulnerable members, e.g., when cultural norms strongly discourage\nfemales from seeking the same educational and career opportunities as\nmales. \nPerhaps the most criticized part of Kymlicka’s account is his\ndistinction between national minorities and immigrants. Many critics\nagree with Choudhry that ”in the majority of cases the decision\nto immigrate is not free“ (64) due entrenched features of the\nglobal economy and other factors beyond the control of immigrants. But\nPatten defends a qualified form of Kymlicka’s distinction, arguing\nthat, in light of the benefits received by immigrants and a moral\nprerogative that states enjoy to pursue their own national\nprojects,“a modest prioritizing of the claims of national minorities\nover those of immigrants is reasonable and permissible”\n(295-96). \nHowever, Patten holds that Kymlicka’s approach is deficient when it\ncomes to cultural minorities — including immigrants —who\nare geographically-dispersed and lack institutions that could serve as\nthe basis for their collective self-government. Contra\nKymlicka, Patten argues that, as a matter of justice, such persons\nhave a right that their cultural practices enjoy a level of\nrecognition and accommodation from the state that is equal to what the\nmajority culture enjoys. This right derives from a liberal state’s\n“obligation to extend a fair opportunity for self-determination to\nall its citizens,” (29) an obligation entailing that the state\n“has the responsibility to be neutral toward the various conceptions\nof the good that are affirmed by its citizens” (27). The appropriate\nform of neutrality (what Patten calls “neutrality of treatment”)\nis achieved when the state provides comparable facilities, resources,\nand opportunities to the members of cultural minority groups so that\nthey are neither disadvantaged nor advantaged, relative to those in\nthe cultural majority, when it comes to pursuing identity-related\naspects of their conceptions of the good. Patten explains\nidentity-related features as ones that are not simply preferences but\nhelp to define a person’s sense of who she is and hold a place of\ncentral importance in a person’s system of ends. \nAccording to Patten, among the areas in which a state might be called\nupon to extend special rights to cultural minorities are language,\nholidays, and the arrangement of substate political divisions. For\nexample, neutrality of treatment might require the state to supply its\nservices, such as assistance with tax preparations or information\nregarding health matters, in the languages of cultural minorities.\nAlthough such accommodations would go well beyond what Kymlicka has\nendorsed, Patten agrees with Kymlicka that the underlying aim of\ncultural rights is not to ensure the survival of a culture. As Patten\nputs it, such rights “are not rights to cultural preservation”\n(29). Once a framework of fair opportunity is established, whatever\ncultural outcome that emerges is just, even if some cultures\n“struggle or . . . disappear altogether” (29).  \nNotwithstanding the differences, the positions of Patten and Kymlicka\noccupy a middle ground between views that are largely antagonistic to\nthe idea of cultural rights and views that embrace such rights on the\nground that the survival of cultures has an intrisic importance,\nirreducible to the interests of individuals. Barry takes the former,\nantagonistic view, while Taylor takes the latter.  \nBarry (2001) asserts that ”there are certain rights against\noppression, exploitation, and injury, to which every single human\nbeing is entitled to lay claim, and…appeals to cultural\ndiversity and pluralism under no circumstances trump the value of\nbasic liberal rights“ (132–33). The legal system should\nprotect those rights by impartially imposing the same rules on all\npersons, regardless of their cultural or religious membership. Barry\nallows for a few exceptions, such as the accommodation of a Sikh boy\nwhose turban violated school dress regulations, but thinks that the\nconditions under which such exceptions will be justified ”are\nrarely satisfied“ (2001: 62). \nAt the other end of the spectrum, Taylor (1994) argues for a form of\ncommunitarianism that attaches intrinsic importance to the survival of\ncultures. In his view, differential treatment under the law for\ncertain practices is sometimes justifiable on the ground that such\ntreatment is important for keeping a culture alive. Taylor goes as far\nas to claim that cultural survival can sometimes trump basic\nindividual rights, such as freedom of speech. Accordingly, he defends\nlegal restrictions on the use of English in Quebec, invoking the\nsurvival of Quebec’s French culture. \nHowever, it is unclear why intrinsic value should attach to cultural\nsurvival as such. Following John Dewey (1939), Kymlicka (1995) rightly\nemphasizes that liberty would have little or no value to the\nindividual apart from the life-options and meaningful choices provided\nby culture. But both of them, as well as Barry and Patten, reasonably\ncontend that human interests are ultimately the interests of\nindividual human beings. In light of that contention, it would seem\nthat a culture that could not gain the uncoerced and undeceived\nadherence of enough individuals to survive would have no moral claim\nto its continuation. Legal restrictions on basic liberties that are\ndesigned to perpetuate a given culture have the cart before the horse:\npersons should have their basic liberties protected first, as those\nprotections serve the most important human interests. Only when those\ninterests are protected can we then say that a culture should survive,\nnot because the culture is intrinsically valuable, but rather because\nit has the uncoerced adherence of a sufficient number of persons. \nThe treatment of blacks under slavery and Jim Crow presents a history\nof injustice and cultural annihilation that is similar in some\nrespects to the treatment of Native Americans. However, civil rights\nprinciples played very different roles in the struggle of these two\noppressed groups. \nCivil rights principles demand that individuals from a disadvantaged\ngroup have an opportunity for inclusion in the mainstream institutions\nof society on an equal basis with the individuals who are already\ntreated as full citizens. However, in certain situations, such\nprinciples might require that the disadvantaged group be given a right\nto govern its own affairs, as Kymlicka’s account shows. This\nright of political self-determination has a separatist aspect, even\nthough something less than complete sovereignty is involved. In\ngeneral, the guiding aim of the civil rights movement of American\nblacks was equal inclusion, while Native American activists sought\npolitical self-determination. \nThe fact that American blacks lacked any territory of their own on\nwhich they could rule themselves favored the inclusion strategy,\nalthough arguments were made that there was sufficient geographical\nconcentration of blacks in certain parts of the South (the so-called\n”Black Belt“) for the African-Americans there to form\ntheir own self-governing nation. Thus, shortly after World War II,\nHarry Haywood advocated black political self-determination on the\nground that the only way to solve ”the issue of Negro\nequality“ was through their ”full development as a\nnation“ (1948: 143). But there was stronger support among\nAmerican blacks for a strategy that focused on the demand for\ninclusion on equal terms with whites in the body politic of the United\nStates. The civil war amendments, and the civil rights laws that\naccompanied them, promised such inclusion, and, in their struggle to\ndefeat Jim Crow, blacks repeatedly called upon white Americans live up\nto the promise. Integration into the mainstream institutions of\nsociety, rather than separate nationhood, was the goal of most\nAmerican blacks, as shown by the widespread support among blacks for\ntheir civil rights movement. \nFor America’s blacks during the 1950s and 60s, the only\nattractive alternative to the movement’s guiding goal of\ninclusion was a form of black nationalism, the main aim of which was\nobtaining increased resources from the broader society for black\ninstitutions and communities. Black self-government along the lines\nsuggested by Haywood did not seem politically possible to most blacks\nduring the civil rights era, but resources for strengthening black\nbusinesses and schools and improving black housing was a quite\nreasonable demand to make on whites. And so many black nationalists\nargued that, unless and until black communities and their institutions\nwere strengthened, the promise of racial justice through integration\nand equal opportunity would prove hollow (Ture and Hamilton\n1967/1992). Accordingly, black nationalists criticized civil rights\nleaders for pursuing a strategy to achieve racial equality that was\nbound to fail.  \nValls has recently developed a ”liberal black nationalism“\n(2010: 479) by adapting Kymlicka’s account of group rights and\narguing that, because American blacks are kind of national minority\nvictimized by historical injustice at the hands of the white\npopulation, ”justice demands the support of black institutions\nand communities by the broader society“ (474). After this\nsupport is forthcoming, Valls contends, individual blacks will be in\nposition to make a free and fair choice as whether, and to what\ndegree, to participate in black institutions and to live in black\ncommunities or to become integrated into racially-mixed areas of\nsociety. But Elizabeth Anderson has argued, against black nationalism,\nthat segregation is a ”fundamental cause of social inequality\nand undemocratic practices,“ (2010: 2) and\n”[c]omprehensive racial integration is a necessary condition for\na racially just future“ (189). Anderson’s argument entails\nthat Vall’s form of black nationalism is self-defeating:\nsegregation itself works to prevent the white support for black\ncommunities and institutions for which such nationalism calls. \nHowever, Shelby argues that Anderson has failed to appreciate the key\nreasons why blacks prefer to live in mainly black neighborhoods:\n“the main concern is to elude interpersonal discrimination, racist\ntreatment, and hostile attitudes,” supplemented by a desire “to\navoid interracial conflict” (269). Seen in this light, black\nresidential self-segregation is a form of “black solidarity” and\n“a component of an ethic of resistance to injustice” (271).\nAdditionally, Shelby contends that Anderson “gives too little\nweight” to the value of the neighborhood-based social networks that\neconomically disadvantaged blacks have in their segregated\nneighborhoods; those networks often provide “child care,\ntransportation, and employment information and referral” (275), and\nit is unclear that giving up the networks and moving to more affluent,\nwhite areas would be sensible, especially because, by Anderson’s own\nassessment, anti-black prejudice is pervasive among whites (Shelby:\n276). Shelby agrees with Anderson “that justice requires that\nobstacles to integration be removed so that individuals have the\noption to integrate,” but he does question the view “that\njustice requires that individuals actually integrate” (277\nemphasis in original). \nAt the same time, one should keep in mind that Shelby’s disagreement\nwith Anderson is focused on residential integration and does not\nextend to her insistence that justice requires integration in\nworkplaces and political institutions. Additionally, one should take\nnote of Miller’s argument that, in an ethnically and racially\ndiverse society, integration appears to be the best way of fostering\ngeneralized trust across groups and that such trust is an important\nvariable determining the level of support that persons give to\ntreating out-group members in accordance with principle of social\njustice (2013: 87-91). \nIn contrast to the civil rights movement of American blacks, Native\nAmericans sought to mitigate the injustices perpetrated against them\nmainly by pursuing political self-determination, in the form of tribal\nself-rule. Even after the brutal tribal removals of the early 19th\ncentury and the efforts at the end of that century to destroy tribal\ncontrol of lands through individual allotments, tribes still retained\nsome territorial basis on which a measure of self-rule was possible.\nAnd during the black civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s, there\nwas tension between Native Americans and blacks due to their different\nattitudes toward self-determination and civil rights. Some Native\nAmericans looked askance at the desire of blacks for inclusion and\nintegration into white society, and they thought that the desire was\nhopelessly naïve (Deloria, 1988: 169–70). Such Native\nAmericans were more in tune with radical black nationalists who\nfavored Haywood’s call for blacks to govern themselves\npolitically in those jurisdictions where they were concentrated. \nIn 1968, Congress enacted an Indian Civil Rights Act (ICRA). The act\nextended the reach of certain individual constitutional rights against\ngovernment to intratribal affairs. Tribal governments would for the\nfirst time be bound by constitutional principles concerning free\nspeech, due process, cruel and unusual punishment, and equal\nprotection, among others. Freedom of religion was omitted from the law\nas a result of the protests of the Pueblo, whose political\narrangements were theocratic, but the law was a major incursion on\ntribal self-determination, nonetheless (Norgren and Shattuck, 1993:\n169). \nA married pueblo woman brought suit in federal court, claiming that\nthe tribe’s marriage ordinances constituted sex discrimination\nagainst her and other women of the tribe, thus violating the ICRA.\n(Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez) The ordinances excluded from tribal\nmembership the children of a Pueblo woman who married outside of the\ntribe, while the children of men who married outsiders were counted as\nmembers. Martinez had initially sought relief in tribal forums, to no\navail, before turning to the federal courts. The Supreme Court held\nthat federal courts did not have jurisdiction to hear the case: the\nsubstantive provisions of the ICRA did apply to the Pueblo, but the\ninherent sovereign powers of the tribe meant that the tribal\ngovernment had exclusive jurisdiction in the case. The ruling has been\nboth questioned and defended by feminist legal scholars (MacKinnon,\n1987; Valencia-Weber 2004). \nUnlike U.S. law, the Canadian Indian Act provides that men and women\nare to be treated equally when it comes to the band membership of\ntheir children (Johnston, 1995: 190). This law and the Santa Clara\ncase raise the general issue of whether and when it is justifiable for\na liberal state to impose liberal principles on illiberal (or not\nfully liberal) political communities that had been involuntary\nincorporated into the larger state. Addressing this issue, Kymlicka\n(1995) argues that “there is relatively little scope for\nlegitimate coercive interference” because efforts to impose\nliberal principles tend to be counterproductive, provoking the charge\nthat they amount to “paternalistic colonialism.” Moreover,\n“liberal institutions can only really work if liberal beliefs\nhave been internalized.” Kymlicka concludes, then, that liberals\non the outside of an illiberal culture should support the efforts of\nthose insiders who seek reform but should generally stop short of\ncoercively imposing liberal principles (1995: 167). At the same time,\nKymlicka acknowledges that there are cases in which a liberal state is\nclearly permitted to impose its laws, citing with approval the\ndecision in a case that involved the application of Canadian law to a\ntribe that had kidnapped a member and forced him to undergo an\ninitiation ceremony (44).  \nApplying Kymlicka’s general line of thinking might prove\ncontentious in many cases. Consider Santa Clara. His arguments could\nbe used to support the decision in that case: the exercise of\njurisdiction might be deemed “paternalistic colonialism.”\nBut one might argue, instead, that jurisdiction is needed to vindicate\nthe basic liberal right of gender equality. However, it does seem\nthat, if a wrong akin to kidnapping or worse is required before\nfederal courts can legitimately step in, then the Santa Clara case\nfalls short of meeting such a requirement. The argument might then\nshift to whether the requirement imposes an excessively high hurdle\nfor the exercise of federal jurisdiction. Accordingly,\nKymlicka’s approach might not settle the disagreement over Santa\nClara, but it does provide a very reasonable normative framework in\nterms of which liberal thought can address the difficult issues\npresented by the case and, more generally, by the problem of extending\nliberal principles to Native American tribes.  \nCivil rights are those rights that constitute free and equal\ncitizenship in a liberal democracy. Such citizenship has two main\ndimensions, both tied to the idea of autonomy. Accordingly, civil\nrights are essentially connected to securing the autonomy of the\ncitizen.  \nTo be a free and equal citizen is, in part, to have those legal\nguarantees that are essential to fully adequate participation in\npublic discussion and decisionmaking. A citizen has a right to an\nequal voice and an equal vote. In addition, she has the rights needed\nto protect her “moral independence,” that is, her ability\nto decide for herself what gives meaning and value to her life and to\ntake responsibility for living in conformity with her values (Dworkin,\n1995: 25). Accordingly, equal citizenship has two main dimensions:\n“public autonomy,” i.e., the individual’s freedom to\nparticipate in the formation of public opinion and society’s\ncollective decisions; and “private autonomy,” i.e., the\nindividual’s freedom to decide what way of life is most worth\npursuing (Habermas: 1996). The importance of these two dimensions of\ncitizenship stem from what Rawls calls the “two moral\npowers” of personhood: the capacity for a sense of justice and\nthe capacity for a conception of the good (1995: 164; 2001: 18). A\nperson stands as an equal citizen when society and its political\nsystem give equal and due weight to the interest each citizen has in\nthe development and exercise of those capacities. \nThe idea of equal citizenship can be traced back to Aristotle’s\npolitical philosophy and his claim that true citizens take turns\nruling and being ruled (1984: 1252a16). In modern society, the idea\nhas been transformed, in part by the development of representative\ngovernment and its system of elections (Manin 1997). For modern\nliberal thought, citizenship is no longer a matter of having a direct\nand equal share in governance, but rather consists in a legal status\nthat confers a certain package of rights that guarantee to an\nindividual a voice, a vote, and a zone of private autonomy. The other\ncrucial differences between modern liberalism and earlier political\ntheories concern the range of human beings who are regarded as having\nthe capacity for citizenship and the scope of private autonomy to\nwhich each citizen is entitled as a matter of basic right. Modern\nliberal theory is more expansive on both counts than its ancient and\nmedieval forerunners. \nIt is true that racist and sexist ideas plagued liberal theory for\nmuch of its modern history (e.g., see Eze 1997 and Mills 2005 on\nKant’s racism). However, two crucial liberal ideas have made\npossible an internal critique of racism, sexism, and other\nillegitimate forms of hierarchy. The first is that society is\nconstructed by humans, a product of human will, and is not some\npreordained natural or God-given order. The second is that social\narrangements need to be justified before the court of reason to each\nindividual who lives under them and who is capable of reasoning. The\nconjunction of these ideas made possible an egalitarianism that was\nnot available to ancient and medieval political thought, although this\nliberal egalitarianism emerged haltingly out of the racist and sexist\npresuppositions that infused much liberal theorizing and that, even if\nin modified forms, still shape the mentality of substantial portions\nof the population in liberal democratic states. \nMany contemporary theorists have argued that taking liberal\negalitarianism to its logical conclusion requires the liberal state to\npursue a program of deliberately reconstructing informal social norms\nand cultural meanings. They contend that social stigma and denigration\nstill operate powerfully to deny equal citizenship to groups such as\nblacks, women, and gays. Accordingly, Kernohan has argued that\n“the egalitarian liberal state should play an activist role in\ncultural reform” (1998: xi), and Koppelman has taken a similar\nposition: “the antidiscrimination project seeks to reconstruct\nsocial reality to eliminate or marginalize the shared meanings,\npractices and institutions that unjustifiably single out certain\ngroups of citizens for stigma and disadvantage” (1996: 8). This\nposition is deeply at odds with at least some of the ideas that lie\nbehind the advocacy of third-generation civil rights. Those rights\nground claims of cultural survival, whether or not a culture’s\nmeanings, practices and institutions stigmatize and disadvantage the\nmembers of some ascriptively-defined group. The egalitarian proponents\nof cultural reconstruction can be understood as advocating a different\nkind of “third-generation” for the civil rights movement:\none in which the state, having attacked legal, political and economic\nbarriers to equal citizenship, now takes on cultural obstacles. \nA cultural-reconstruction phase of the civil rights movement would run\ncontrary to Kukathas’s argument that it is too dangerous to\nlicense the state to intervene against cultures that engage in social\ntyranny (2001). It also raises questions about whether state-supported\ncultural reconstruction would violate basic liberties, such as freedom\nof private association. The efforts of New Jersey to apply\nantidiscrimination law to the Boy Scouts, a group whose national\norganization discriminated against gays until 2015 (Boy Scouts: 2015),\nillustrates the potential problems. The Supreme Court invalidated the\nstate’s efforts on grounds of free association\n (Boys Scouts v. Dale).\n Nonetheless, it may be necessary to reconceive the scope and limits\nof some basic liberties if the principle of free and equal citizenship\nis followed through to its logical conclusions. \nAmong the most effective and important pieces of legislation to come\nout of the civil rights movement was the Voting Rights Act of 1965\n(VRA). The act effected a “quiet revolution” (Davidson and\nGrofman) in the political systems of southern states by greatly\nreducing the legal power those states had traditionally possessed to\ndetermine the rules by which their electoral systems operated. The\nrules had been designed to ensure that whites maintained a monopoly on\npolitical power by disenfranchising African Americans, notwithstanding\nthe demand of the Fifteenth Amendment that the right to vote not be\ndenied or abridged on the basis of race or color. Using a variety of\ndevices, southern jurisdictions had succeeded in denying the ballot to\nthe vast majority of African Americans. Those devices included\nliteracy and other knowledge tests, which were administered by local\nregistrars in a discriminatory manner. And in Giles v. Harris (1903),\nthe Supreme Court had effectively declared that the federal judiciary\nwas not the place to go for blacks who sought to dismantle the system\nof disenfranchisement, with Justice Holmes writing for the Court that\n“relief from a great political wrong, if done, as alleged, by\nthe people of a state and the state itself must be given by them or by\nthe legislative and political department of the government of the\nUnited States” (488). \nThe VRA took a series of unprecedented steps in shifting the power to\nregulate elections from the states to the national government. The\ntraditional understanding had been that, under the Constitution,\nstates had the exclusive and final power to determine the rules by\nwhich their elections were held. The VRA overturned that\nunderstanding, inserting federal power into the sovereign domain of\nthe states. Previous federal statutes addressing racial discrimination\nin voting had respected that domain and had required the right to\nvote, regardless of race or color, be vindicated on a case-by-case\nbasis by lawsuits brought by individual complainants. But by the\nmid-1960’s Congress had determined that such an approach had proved\nineffective in addressing systemic violations of the Fifteenth\nAmendment. \nSection 2 of the VRA contained a nationwide ban on any voting\nqualification or procedure that denied or abridged a citizen’s right\nto vote on account of race or color. The act went on to provide\nremedies to make the ban effective in jurisdictions that had been\nparticularly egregious in their violations of the Fifteenth Amendment.\nThe remedies applied to jurisdictions that met two conditions (the\n“coverage formula”): 1) as of November 1964, the jurisdiction was\nusing a literacy test or some similar device to determine eligibility\nto register, and 2) the proportion of eligible voters in the\njurisdiction who were actually registered on that date was below 50% ,\nor the voter turnout there for that year’s presidential election was\nbelow 50%. The remedies authorized for use against jurisdictions that\nmet the coverage formula included the invalidation of literacy tests\nand other such devices, the appointment of federal examiners to\nreplace local registrars and to prepare and maintain the voting rolls,\nand, under Section 5, the requirement to gain federal approval\n(typically from the Attorney General) for any changes in rules\ngoverning elections (“the preclearance requirement”). Seven\nsouthern states fell under the coverage formula. Section 4 also\nprovided that otherwise covered jurisdictions could “bailout” of\nfederal oversight by showing that, in the previous five years, they\nhad not used the suspect devices with the purpose or effect of denying\nthe right to vote on racial grounds.“ \nThe constitutionality of the key provisions of the VRA was challenged\nby the states that fell under the coverage formula, but the Supreme\nCourt upheld the law in South Carolina v. Katzenbach (1966). The act\nwas then reauthorized several times, most recently in 2006. The\nalterations sought to strengthen protections against what were called\n“second- generation” barriers to racial equality in the electoral\nprocess. The first generation had been the literacy tests and other\ndevices that were applied in discriminatory fashion to block blacks\nfrom registering. The second generation consisted of various ways that\nthe political power of registered minority voters was diluted by\nmaking it more difficult for them than for the white majority to elect\ntheir favored candidates. \nConsider the following example of vote dilution. In many counties in\nthe South, whites were in the overall majority but blacks were a\nmajority in certain parts of the county. The counties were divided\ninto districts, with each district electing a member of the county\nboard. First-generation discrimination ensured all-white boards by\nblocking black registration in majority-black districts. When\nfirst-generation devices were invalidated as a result of the VRA, many\nsouthern counties switched from a district-based system to at-large\nvoting, so that the white majority in the county could continue to\nelect an all-white board. The Supreme Court held that such changes\nwere subject to a preclearance review by federal authorities, who were\nempowered to prohibit the changes. (Allen v. State Board of Elections\n1969). However, in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Supreme Court\neffectively struck down the coverage formula of Section 4, thereby\nrendering impotent Section 5’s preclearance provision: with no\ncoverage formula, no jurisdictions could be picked out as ones needing\nto receive federal approval for changing their electoral rules. The\nformula had been last updated in the early 1970’s, and, writing for\nthe Court, Chief Justice Roberts found that the use of the formula had\nbecome “irrational” in light of the “dramatic [racial]\nprogress” that had been made in the intervening decades (Slip\nOpinion at 23-24). He pointed out that the jurisdictions covered by\nthe formula had rates of black voter registration and turnout as high,\nand in some cases higher, than the rates for whites, and that\nminorities now hold office “at unprecedented levels” (14) in those\nstates. \nJustice Roberts did not deny the existence of second-generation\nbarriers, but he argued that Congress had failed to reshape the\ncoverage formula to track the parts of the country in which such\nbarriers were most prevalent at present. Accordingly, he did not see a\nrational relationship between the formula and any remaining obstacles\nto racial discrimination in voting. Moreover, he contended that\nSection 5 constituted a “dramatic departure from the principle that\nall states enjoy equal sovereignty” (1). In light of such a\ndeparture from a principle that he regarded as “fundamental” (11),\nRoberts concluded that Congress lacked the constitutional power to\nimpose the old coverage formula. \nIn her dissent, Justice Ginsburg emphasized the evidential record that\nCongress had compiled prior to its 2006 reauthorization of the law.\nThat record led Congress to the conclusion that the old coverage\nformula was adequate to capture those jurisdictions where\nsecond-generation barriers were most prevalent. For example, the\nrecord contained a study showing that covered areas were much more\nlikely to be successfully sued in Section 2 litigation than\njurisdictions that were not covered. Accordingly, Ginsburg judged that\n“Congress had reasonably concluded that the coverage formula\ncontinues to identify the jurisdictions of greatest concern”\n(Ginsburg, J., dissenting, Slip Opinion at 20). She also construed the\n“equal sovereignty” principle as applying only to the very limited\ncircumstances in which a new state was being admitted to the union:\nthe new state must not be accorded a lesser, or greater, degree of\nsovereignty than the existing states. \nMuch of the critical discussion of Shelby County has focused on the\nequal sovereignty principle, with many commentators rejecting\nRoberts’s characterization of the principle as legally fundamental.\nAnd it is true that his broad understanding of the principle does not\nfind much explicit legal precedent. However, the principle, understood\nas he does, seems to be such a clear operating premise of American\nfederalism that it could be reasonably expected to go unformulated for\nso long. Additionally, Roberts is correct to see section 5 of the VRA\nas a “dramatic departure” (1) from the principle. As Bruce\nAckerman stresses, the VRA was a radical piece of legislation, akin to\na constitutional amendment in the way that it overturned long-settled\nlegal understandings. Nonetheless, Roberts’s argument remains\nproblematic due to his insistence that Congress reshape the coverage\nformula in light of current realities regarding racial discrimination\nin voting. Congress did examine the current situation and found that\nno reformulation was needed because, notwithstanding the formula’s\nreferences to registration and turnout from decades ago, it still\ncaptured the jurisdictions with the most serious problems. This\nfinding is not prima facie implausible, and Roberts’s\nsecond-guessing Congress’s judgment in the matter is difficult to\ndefend. \nIn arguing that the coverage formula needed reformulation, Roberts\npointed to the levels of black registration, turnout, and office\nholding in recent years. Turnout and registration were at least as\nhigh as for whites in covered jurisdictions, and office holding had\nincreased dramatically over the decades. However, the turnout and\nregistration figures do not speak to second-generation barriers, nor\ndoes the comparison between black office holding now and forty-five\nyears ago. Whether or not those barriers have been largely taken down\ncannot be determined from a baseline of 1970: the admittedly great\nprogress in office holding since then might only show how bad things\nwere in the covered jurisdictions in 1970 and not how close they are\nnow to having eliminated the effects of racial discrimination in their\nelectoral processes. \nIn recent years, the criminal justice system has become a focal point\nin the discussion of civil rights in the United States. A number of\ncommentators have argued that the system amounts to a “new Jim\nCrow,” reducing blacks to an inferior, caste-like status (Alexander\n2012; for criticism of the Jim Crow analogy, see Forman 2012). Yet,\neven apart from such arguments, civil rights concerns have been raised\nabout every dimension of criminal justice in the U.S., from the\ninvestigation and arrest of suspects to the imposition of the death\npenalty. And issues of racial equality with respect to criminal\njustice are hardly limited to the U.S. (Clarke: 9-10). In France, for\nexample, race-based abuse perpetrated by the police is a matter of\nserious public concern, and the office of Defender of Rights has found\nthat persons perceived as black or Arab are 20 times as likely to be\nstopped by police as members of the general population (Bredeen and\nMorenne).  \nAmong the most controversial tactics used by police in determining who\nhas committed a crime is racial (and ethnic) profiling. The tactic has\ngiven rise to the charge that the use of the tactic violates the civil\nrights of those whom it targets, and, in some cases, the courts have\nagreed with the charge. In State v. Soto, for example, a New Jersey\ncourt found that police traffic stops targeted blacks and amounted to\na “selective enforcement” (351) of the law and a violation of the\nEqual Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Nonetheless, debate\ncontinues over when, if ever, it is justifiable for police to use race\nin deciding whom to stop and question.  \nRisse and Zeckhauser formulate a philosophically sophisticated defense\nof racial profiling. They argue that, even in a racist society like\nthe United State, such profiling is justifiable under conditions\nplausibly thought to exist in a range of cases. Their argument\ncombines utilitarian and deontological considerations: the utilitarian\nstrand regards profiling as contributing to the public good of crime\ncontrol, while the deontological line of argument aims to rebut claims\nthat profiling is objectionably discriminatory and unfair to persons\nwhom it harms.  \nRisse and Zeckhauser acknowledge that police abuse can be coupled with\nprofiling, but they insist that “abuse and profiling . . . are\ndifferent problems that must be assessed independently” (139;\nemphasis in original). Profiling is “any police initiated-action\nthat relies on the race, ethnicity, or national origin and not merely\non the behavior of an individual” (136). Such action need not\ninvolve any abusive police behavior, such as “rude words, demeaning\ndemands, physical force, or physical injury” (138). Abuse “must be\nrectified independently” (139) of profiling.  \nSome critics of profiling contend that it is wholly ineffective as a\ncrime control measure. Risse and Zeckhauser point out that if this\ncontention is true, then there is no issue: profiling is unjustifiable\non that premise. But they reason that, even if some forms of profiling\nmake no net contribution to crime control, it seems unlikely that all\nforms fit that description, given “a significant correlation between\nmembership in certain racial groups and the tendency to commit certain\ncrimes” (132).  \nRacial minorities feel aggrieved by profiling, and Risse and\nZeckhauser do not disregard that fact. However, they claim that the\ngrievance rests largely on “the underlying systematic racism”\n(145) of society and that the harm done to minorities by profiling is\n“small” (169) in comparison to that harm done by that underlying\nracism. For example, African Americans would be “only slightly”\nbetter off if profiling were eliminated, “keeping everything\nelse fixed” (149; emphasis in original). “[T]he harm attached\nto profiling per se,” they explain, “is expressive”\n(146; emphasis in original). Profiling is “a symbol of structural\ndisadvantage” (147) but “not the primary cause of . . . the sense\nof hurt among minorities” (149). In the utilitarian calculus of\nRisse and Zeckhauser, the harms that count against the benefits\nflowing from more effective crime control are “comparatively\nmodest” (149), viz., symbolic harms plus the temporary\ninconveniences of being stopped and questioned by the police. These\nmodest harms are, in their view, likely to be outweighed in a range of\ncases by the benefits. \nAdditionally, Risse and Zeckhauser argue that racial profiling per se\nis not objectionably discriminatory, because it has neither “the\nintention or the effect of maintaining or establishing an\noppressive relationship” between the races (153; emphasis\nin original). When it does not involve abuse, profiling has the\nintention of crime control, and, because profiling “is itself\nparasitic on an underlying oppressive relationship” (154) and does\n(mainly) symbolic harm, it “does not contribute to [an] oppressive\nrelationship” (155).  \nCritics of Risse and Zeckhauser argue that profiling is not only a\nsymbol of society’s underlying racism but that it contributes\nmaterially to such racism as well. Thus, Lever contends that profiling\n“encourages us to see black people as perpetrators” and that it\nlikely “discourages black people from living, traveling and working\nin white neighborhoods” (2007: 23). Lever also challenges the idea\nthat police abuse is independent of profiling; she suggests that\n“racial profiling exacerbates problems of police abuse” because\nsuch profiling “conveys a message that black people are . . .\ndangerous” (24). And one could also argue against Risse and\nZeckhauser that it is reasonable to hold that abuse is a predictable\nconsequence of the combination of profiling and society’s underlying\nracism, because the racist belief that blacks in general are\nespecially likely to be lawbreakers is hardly foreign to police and\ncan be reasonably expected to prime police to resort to excessive\nforce and other forms of abuse when dealing with blacks.  \nLippert-Rasmussen criticizes Risse and Zeckhauser for failing to take\naccount of the fact that patterns and rates of crime among blacks are\nnot independent of the wrongful behavior of whites in society at large\ntoward blacks. If racial profiling is an effective law-enforcement\npractice because blacks disproportionately commit crimes of a certain\nsort, that fact might be the product of the unjustified,\ndiscriminatory conduct of whites, and if blacks reject profiling, it\nwould seem that whites could not then justify the practice by\nappealing to its efficacy. Instead, whites could and should forego\nprofiling and, instead, cease engaging in their wrongful behavior.\n \nIn replying to Lever and Lippert-Rasmussen, Risse notes that “[i]t\nmay be true that, given current conditions, it is impossible to use\nrace [in criminal profiling] . . . without encountering massive\nproblems of police abuse” (2007: 4). But critics of profiling will\nsay that even this point understates the matter: profiling predictably\ngenerates racist abuses by providing an opportunity for racist beliefs\nto operate in law enforcement and by encouraging such beliefs to\noperate there. And this situation is not simply a matter of “current\nconditions,” as though in the next few years the matter could well\nbe different. As Risse writes in responding to Lippert-Rasmussen, the\nbehavioral patterns of “people [who] have been socialized in a\nracist society . . . will be hard to change” (2007: 8).  \nRisse emphasizes that his view would justify racial profiling only\nwhen such profiling contributes to the provision of the important\npublic good of personal safety. In his estimation, at least some of\nthe forms that profiling has taken fail to meet that conditions, e.g.,\nrandom traffic stops of blacks driving in white neighborhoods. His\npoint is that it is a mistake to think that all forms of racial\nprofiling are like such traffic stops and to categorically reject\nprofiling on the assumption that the traffic-stop example can stand in\nfor every form of racial profiling.  \nReiman agrees that some forms of racial profiling can make a\nsignificant contribution to overall safety, but he also supports\nLever’s view that racial profiling in a racist society is likely to\nexacerbate racism and increase the violation of the rights of those\nvictimized by racism. While he holds that “profiling is not\nintrinsically racist” (17), Reiman argues that Risse and Zeckhauser\nhave not set the bar sufficiently high for profiling to be justified.\nHe contends that, in light of its likely exacerbation of existing\nracism, “racial profiling [must] be used only for grave crimes and\nonly where there is abundant evidence of its likelihood of\nsignificantly increasing apprehension of perpetrators of such\ncrimes” (17). This view is in conformity with Lever’s position\nthat profiling should only be “an exceptional measure” (2005: 109)\nin the work of police.  \nThe Risse- Zeckhauser argument is consistent with the idea,\nundoubtedly accepted by many critics of profiling, that racial\ninjustice is severe and widespread in a society like the U.S.\nDisagreement arises, however, over the extent of the harms brought\nabout by those forms of racial profiling that have value in catching\noffenders and reducing crime. But the deeper disagreement is over how\nthe harms in question are to be factored into the determination of\nwhen profiling is acceptable. Risse and Zeckhauser hold that the harms\nare to be balanced against, and so can be outweighed by, the benefits\nof more effective law enforcement. Critics, on the other hand, do not\nregard the benefits of profiling as morally innocent gains, to be\nimpersonally weighed in a utilitarian calculus. Rather, the critics\nsee whatever law-enforcement benefits there may be as tainted by the\nway in which profiling, even when non-abusive, is linked to racism:\nthe benefits should be morally discounted, or put another way, they\nshould not simply outweigh the harms but should do so by an especially\nlarge margin if a given form of profiling is to be justifiable.  \nAmong the most highly contested civil rights issues of recent years\nhas been the question of whether marriage laws should be extended to\ninclude same-sex couples. Over the past two decades, a number of\ncountries have liberalized their laws to enable such couples to become\nmarried, despite the opposition of those who think that it is morally\nor theologically unjustified to alter the traditional understanding of\nmarriage as the union of a man and a woman. The countries that\ncurrently recognize same-sex marriages include the Netherlands,\nBelgium, Canada, South Africa, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Mexico,\nPortugal, Iceland, Argentina, Denmark, Brazil, France, England, New\nZealand, and the United States. In most of these countries, nationwide\nsame-sex marriage was brought about by legislation. But in the United\nStates, the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges extended\nsame-sex marriage from ten states to all fifty. \nMost scholars working in the areas of philosophy and legal theory\nendorse a principle of equal treatment for same-sex and heterosexual\ncouples and argue that equal treatment requires that same-sex\nmarriages be legalized (Wardle 1996 and Eskridge 1996). However, there\nare dissenting voices in the literature, rejecting marriage equality.\nThese voices do not argue in favor the traditional practice of\ncriminalizing same-sex relations, although some contend that such\nrelations are “manifestly unworthy of the human being and immoral”\n(Finnis 1996: 14). But they all argue that extending marriage to\nsame-sex couples flouts important values and principles.  \nMany advocates of a right to same-sex marriage argue that abridging a\nperson’s right to marry on the basis of sexual orientation is\nobjectionable for the same reasons that abridging that right on the\nbasis of race cannot be justified: both forms of restriction are\narbitrary deprivations of a fundamental civil right (Koh et al.: 18-19\nand 42). However, such an argument proceeds too quickly. In the eyes\nof opponents, the analogy between race and sexual orientation is\ninapt: the considerations they invoke against same-sex marriage, such\nas the interests of children or the distinctive nature of heterosexual\nintercourse, do not apply to interracial marriages. Accordingly,\narguments about same-sex marriage must engage with those\nconsiderations. \nFinnis (1996), Lee (1997) and George (1997) make their case against\nsame-sex marriage by invoking natural law. However, unlike traditional\nversions of natural law theory, their version does not rest on any\nexplicit theological or metaphysical claims. Rather, it invokes\nindependent principles of practical reasoning that articulate the\nbasic reasons for action. Such reasons are the fundamental goods that\naction is capable of realizing and, for Finnis, Lee and George,\ninclude “marriage, the conjuntio of man and woman” (Finnis 1996:\n4). Homosexual conduct, masturbation, and all extra-marital sex aim\nstrictly at “individual gratification” and can be no part of any\n“common good.” Such actions “harm the character” of those\nvoluntarily choosing them (Lee and George, 1997: 135), and, in taking\nthe actions, the individual becomes a slave to his passions, allowing\nhis reason to be overridden by his raw desire for sensuous pleasure.\n \nOn Finnis’s account, when consensual sexual conduct is private,\ngovernment may not outlaw it, but government “can rightly judge that\nit has a compelling interest in denying that ‘gay lifestyles’ are\na valid and humanly acceptable choice and form of life” (1996: 17).\nAnd for Finnis, Lee and George, equal treatment of same-sex and\nheterosexual relations is out of the question due to the morally\ndefective character of same-sex relations.  \nMacedo responds to Finnis by arguing that “all of the goods that can\nbe shared by sterile heterosexual couples can also be shared by\ncommitted homosexual couples” (1996: 39). Macedo points out that\nFinnis does not condemn sexual intercourse by sterile heterosexual\ncouples. But Finnis replies that there is a relevant difference\nbetween homosexual couples and sterile heterosexual ones: the latter\nbut not the former are united “biologically” when they have\nintercourse. Lee and George make essentially the same point: only\nheterosexual couples can “truly become one body, one organism”\n(1997: 150). But Macedo points out that, biologically, it is not the\nman and woman who unite but the sperm and the egg (1996: 37). It can\nbe added that the “biological unity” argument seems to run\ncontrary to Finnis’s claim that his position “does not seek to\ninfer normative conclusions from non-normative (natural-fact)\npremises” (1997: 16). More importantly, Macedo and Koppelman make\nthe key point that the human good realized in intimate relations is a\nfunction of “mutual commitment and stable engagement” (Macedo,\n1996: 40) and that same-sex couples can achieve “the precise kind of\nhuman good” that is available to heterosexual ones (Koppelman, 1997:\n1649). Accordingly, equal treatment under the law for same-sex\ncouples, including the recognition of same-sex marriage, would remove\nunjustifiable obstacles faced by same-sex couples to the achievement\nof that human good.  \nCorvino explains one of the central human goods provided by marriage\nin this way: marriage involves two individuals mutually and publicly\ncommitting to be the “Number One Person” for the other in sharing\nthe benefits and alleviating the burdens that life brings (Corvino and\nGallagher: 15). Sterile heterosexual couples and those unable to have\nsexual relations for physical reasons are rightly permitted to marry\nto secure that good, and Corvino argues that “once the state\nprovides marriage as an option for different-sex partners, even if\nthey cannot or choose not to have children; . . . [and] even if they\nare incapable of coitus, . . . but then denies [marriage] to same-sex\ncouples, it is treating citizens unequally” (89–90).  \nGallagher rejects Corvino’s view, contending that “[t]he critical\npublic or ‘civil’ task of marriage is to regulate sexual\nrelationships between men and women in order to reduce the likelihood\nthat children . . . will face the burdens of fatherlessness, and\nincrease the likelihood that there will be a next generation that will\nbe raised by their mothers and fathers in one family, where both\nparents are committed to each other and to their children” (Corvino\nand Gallagher: 96). She argues that “gay marriage is a profound\nchange to the meaning of the word ‘marriage’. . . . [b]ecause] it\ndisconnects marriage from its grounding in the human reality that\nmale-female sexual relationships are different from other kinds of\nrelationships” (101).  \nHowever, Gallagher is not correct to claim that Corvino’s view rests\non the premise that “a union of two men or two women is just the\nsame as a union of husband and wife” (132). The question is whether\nthe two sorts of union are relevantly similar with respect to values\nthat marriage serves. Corvino claims that, with respect to at least\none important value, viz., providing support for couples who want to\nundertake a mutual and public commitment to be each other’s\n“Number One Person,” there is no relevant difference. Gallagher\nweakens her own view when she writes that “gay marriage is wrong\nfirst and foremost not because of its consequences but because it is a\nlie” (178), specifically, the lie that same-sex couples “are like\nman and wife” (177). Rather, in light of her emphasis on how\nmarriage protects children (109-115), she should argue that regulating\nsexual relations between men and women in the interest of children is\nthe most important social purpose of marriage and that marriage\nequality threatens the capacity of marriage to serve that function;\nshe should not deny that marriage has other, socially valuable\nfunctions.  \nCorvino affirms that marriage has an important child-protection\nfunction, while rejecting the idea that it is the sole function (192).\nHis key disagreements with Gallagher are over the importance of those\nother functions and whether there is adequate reason to think that\nmarriage equality threatens the child-protection function. Corvino\nargues that denying same-sex couples access to the human goods that\nmarriage can provide to them is no small matter for those couples and\nthat Gallagher vastly underestimates what such access means to them\n(198). Given how persistently and vigorously same-sex couples have\nfought for marriage equality, it is difficult to disagree with Corvino\non the matter.  \nCiting studies suggesting that male same-sex couples have a relatively\nweak commitment to sexual fidelity and are relatively unconcerned\nabout their partner having sex outside of the relationship, Gallagher\nargues that same-sex marriage would dilute the commitment to fidelity\namong heterosexual couples, thereby undermining an essential marital\nnorm. And, with the fidelity norm seriously weakened, heterosexual\nmarriages would become more unstable and the interests of children\nwould be harmed. \nIn Corvino’s judgment, however, Gallagher’s argument rests\non an ”implausible empirical claim about same-sex couples’\npower to topple majority norms“ (195). Gay marriages would be\nonly a tiny fraction of all marriages, and gay marriages between men\nwho are indifferent to fidelity would be an even smaller fraction. One\ncould add to Corvino’s criticism that, even if Gallagher’s\nclaim is not implausible, it does seem to be little more than\nspeculation, and it is problematic to deny a civil right on such\nspeculative grounds to a portion of the adult population that has made\nit clear that, contra Gallagher, the right is very important\nto them. Gallagher might respond that the stakes for society are high,\nclaiming that the well-being of future generations hang in the\nbalance. But essentially the same claims have been made by defenders\nof traditional marriage about every liberalization of the law of\nmarriage, from the dismantling of coverture (which had placed a\nmarried woman almost entirely under the legal power of her husband) to\nthe present controversy over same-sex marriage. \nGirgis, Anderson, and George argue that the defense of same-sex\nmarriage rests on a faulty understanding of marriage, what they call\n“the revisionist view” (4). Such a view derives from the sexual\nrevolution of the 1960’s and rejects the understanding that had\nprevailed in almost every society until then, “the conjugal view”\n(3). \nOn the conjugal view, marriage is a permanent commitment, “ordered\nto procreation and family life” (7) and constituting a\n“comprehensive union” of a man and a woman. The union joins\nspouses “in body as well as in mind” and is “sealed by sexual\nintercourse” (3). Such a union is “a basic human good, a\ndistinctive way of thriving” (35). And “there is something\nspecial” about a marital couple’s sexual intercourse, because it\nconstitutes the “highest kind of bodily unity” (26), a unity not\navailable in any other relationship. In having intercourse, the\nmarital partners “do not merely touch or interlock” but unite in a\nway that “has generative significance” and “physically embodies\ntheir specific, marital commitment” (36). \nBy contrast, the revisionist view regards marriage as essentially a\nmatter of “emotional union and cohabitation” (8). Sex can enhance\nthe emotional connections but is not essential to the marital union,\nand when the emotions cool, the partners might reasonably seek to end\nthe union. \nGirgis et al. claim that the revisionist view warps our grasp of what\nmarriage is. They dismiss Corvino’s idea that marriage is a matter\nof having a “Number One Person,” arguing that it “cannot\ndistinguish marriage from simple companionship” (15). Nor can the\nrevisionist view explain why the state should be involved in\nregulating marriage or account for the central marital norms of\npermanence and sexual exclusivity. \nCorvino can respond that his defense of marriage equality does not\nrest on the revisionist view, even though he does reject the conjugal\nview. Rather, Corvino is suggesting a way of understanding marriage\nthat gives same-sex partners access to those substantial goods of\nmarriage that are not tied to heterosexual intercourse. Security in a\nstable relationship that is publicly and legally ratified as lasting\nand exclusive is among those goods. The liberty to break off a\nrelationship when emotions “cool” is no part of Corvino’s\nunderstanding of marriage. And although it is true that companionship\nand friendship can provide a “Number One Person,” they cannot do\nso with the same level of assurance that a legally ratified marriage\ncan do so. \nGirgis et al. might reject Corvino’s view on the ground that it\nrests on mere psychological considerations related to such matters as\nhow secure people feel and how likely they are to end a relationship\nif it is sexually open, whereas their view rests on a priori\nprinciples concerning objective human goods. However, Corvino can\nrespond that his understanding of marriage invokes human goods that\nare no less objective than Girgis’s “comprehensive union.”\nAdditionally, Corvino might note that, even assuming that heterosexual\nintercourse unites male and female partners, his argument proceeds\nwithout recourse to such contestable claims as the quasi-metaphysical\nthesis that such intercourse between married partners is “the\nhighest” form of bodily unity and that other sorts of sexual\nactivity are a “mere” touching or interlocking of bodily\nparts. \nGirgis et al. think that the conjugal account of marriage reflects its\ntrue nature, but this position appears to have been rejected by most\ndemocratic societies since the liberalization of marriage laws and\nnorms that began with nineteenth-century criticisms of the law of\ncoverture. Blackstone summarized the law as it had been through the\n18th century: “By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in\nlaw: that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is\nsuspended during the marriage, or at least is incorporated and\nconsolidated into that of the husband” (441). Over the course of a\ncentury and more, coverture was limited and eventually eliminated in\nfavor of marriage equality between husband and wife, though\ntraditionalists repeatedly argued that such changes violated the\nessence of marriage as “a union of person in husband and wife”\n(441). Subsequent changes in the social understanding of marriage were\nreflected in the rejection of the requirement of sexual intercourse\nfor the consummation of marriage and in the spread of no-fault divorce\nlaws. Given that such radical changes in the understanding of marriage\nhave already taken place and been inscribed in law, it is unclear how\nlaw and society can now consistently or justly exclude same-sex\ncouples from forming a marital bond. \nDuring the 1970s and 80s, persons with disabilities increasingly\nargued that they were treated as second-class citizens by law and\nsociety. They organized into a civil rights movement that pressed for\nlegislation that would help secure for them the status of equal\ncitizens. Protection against discrimination based on disability was\nwritten into the\n Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\n and\n The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\n The disability rights movement in the U.S. culminated with the\npassage of the\n Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990\n (ADA). The ADA has served as a model for legislation in countries\nsuch as Australia, India and Israel \nThe disability rights movement began with the idea that discrimination\non the basis of disability was not different in any morally important\nway from discrimination based on race. The aim of the movement was to\nenshrine in law the same kind of antidiscrimination principle that\nprotected persons based on their race. But some theorists have\nquestioned how well the analogy holds. They point out that applying\nthe antidiscrimination norm to disability, for example, by installing\nramps for access to buildings or offering special education programs,\nrequires taking account of physical or mental differences among\npeople. This seems to be treatment based on a person’s physical\nor mental features, apparently the exact opposite of the ideal of\n”colorblindness“ behind the traditional antidiscrimination\nprinciple. \nEven race-based affirmative action does not really seem to be parallel\nto antidiscrimination policies that take account of disability.\nAdvocates of affirmative action assert that the social ideal is for\npersons not to be treated on the basis of their race or color at all.\nRace-conscious policies are seen as instruments that will move society\ntoward that ideal (Wasserstrom, 2001). \nIn contrast, policies designed to counter discrimination based on\ndisability are not sensibly understood as temporary measures or steps\ntoward a goal in which people are not treated based on their\ndisabilities. The policies permanently enshrine the idea that in\ndesigning buildings or buses or constructing some other aspect of our\nphysical-social environment, we must be responsive to the disabilities\npeople have in order for the disabled to have ”fair equality of\nopportunity“ (Rawls, 2001: 43–44). The need for a\npermanent ”accommodation“ of persons with disabilities\nseems to mark an important difference in how the antidiscrimination\nnorm should be understood in the context of disability, as opposed to\nthe context of race. \nHowever, it is important to recognize that, at the level of\nfundamental principle, the reasons why disability-based discrimination\nis morally objectionable and even unjust are essentially the same as\nthe reasons why racial discrimination is so. At the individual level,\ndisadvantageous treatment of the disabled is often rooted in ill-will,\ndisregard, and moral arbitrariness. At the systemic level, such\ntreatment creates a social pattern of disadvantage that reduces the\ndisabled to second-class status. In those two respects, the grounds of\ncivil rights law are no different when it comes to the disabled. \nAnother way in which disability is thought to be fundamentally\ndifferent from race concerns the special needs that the disabled often\nhave that make life more costly for them. These extra costs would\nexist even if the socially-constructed physical environment were built\nto provide the disabled with fair equality of opportunity and their\nbasic civil and political liberties were secured. In order to function\neffectively, disabled persons may need to buy medications or therapies\nor other forms of assistance that the able-bodied do not need for\ntheir functioning. And there does not seem to be any parallel in\nmatters of race to the special needs of some of those who are\ndisabled. The driving idea of the civil rights movement was that\nblacks did not have any special needs: all they needed was to have the\nburdens of racism lifted from them and, once that was accomplished,\nthey would flourish or fail like everyone else in society. \nHowever, Silvers (1998) argues that the parallel between race and\ndisability still holds: all the disabled may claim from society as a\nmatter of justice is that they have fair equality of opportunity and\nthe same basic civil rights as everyone else. Any special needs that\nthe disabled may have do not provide the grounds of any legitimate\nclaims of justice. On the other hand, Kittay (2000) argues that the\nspecial needs of the disabled are a matter of basic justice. She\nfocuses on the severely mentally disabled, for whom fair opportunity\nin the labor markets and political rights in the public sphere will\nhave no significance, and on the families that have the responsibility\nof caring for the severely disabled. Pogge (2000) also questions\nSilvers’ view, suggesting that it is implausible to deny that\njustice requires that society provide resources for meeting the needs\nof the severely disabled. Still, it may be the case that some version\nof Silvers’ approach may be justifiable when it comes to\ndisabled persons who have the capacity ”to participate fully in\nthe political and civic institutions of the society and, more broadly,\nin its public life“ (Pogge, 2000: 45). In the case of such\npersons, the basic civil right to equal citizenship would require that\nthey have the equal opportunity to participate in such institutions,\nregardless of their disability. Although there may be some aspects of\nthe racial model that cannot be applied to persons with severe forms\nof mental disability, the principles behind the American civil rights\nstruggles of the 1950s and 60s remain crucial normative resources for\nunderstanding and combating forms of unjust discrimination that have\nonly more recently been addressed by philosophers and by society more\nbroadly.","contact.mail":"aaltman@gsu.edu","contact.domain":"gsu.edu"}]
