This characterization is\nclearly circular (“no other thing”) and paradoxical too,\nunless the notion of “each thing” is qualified. More satisfactory\n(though partial) characterizations are available and the idea that such\na relation of absolute identity exists is commonplace. Some, however,\ndeny that a relation of absolute identity exists. Identity, they say,\nis relative: It is possible for objects \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to be\nthe same \\(F\\) and yet not the same \\(G\\), (where\n\\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are predicates representing kinds of things\n(apples, ships, passengers) rather than merely properties of things\n(colors, shapes)). In such a case ‘same’ cannot mean\nabsolute identity. For example, the same person might be two different\npassengers, since one person may be counted twice as a passenger. If to\nsay that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same person is to say that\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are persons and are (absolutely) identical,\nand to say that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are different passengers is\nto say that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are passengers and are\n(absolutely) distinct, we have a contradiction. Others maintain that\nwhile there are such cases of “relative identity,” there is also such a\nthing as absolute identity. According to this view, identity comes in\ntwo forms: trivial or absolute and nontrivial or relative (Gupta\n1980). These maverick views present a serious challenge to the\nreceived, absolutist doctrine of identity. In the first place, cases\nsuch as the passenger/person case are more difficult to dismiss than\nmight be supposed (but see below, §3). Secondly, the standard view\nof identity is troubled by many persistent puzzles and problems, some\nof recent and some of ancient origin. The relative identity alternative\nsheds considerable light on these problems even if it does not promise\na resolution of them all. \n\n\n\n\nA word about notation. In what follows, lower case italic letters\n‘\\(x\\)’, ‘\\(y\\)’, etc., are used\ninformally either as variables (bound or free) or as (place-holders\nfor) individual constants. The context should make clear which usage is\nin play. Occasionally, for emphasis or in deference to logical\ntradition, other expressions for individual constants are employed.\nAlso, the use/mention distinction is not strictly observed; but again\nthe context should resolve any ambiguity.\n\n\n\n[Note: The following material is somewhat technical. The reader may\nwish to casually review it now and return to it as needed, especially\nin connection with §5. The propositions \\(\\mathbf{Ref},\n\\mathbf{LL}, \\mathbf{Ref}', \\mathbf{LL}', \\mathbf{NI}\\), and\n\\(\\mathbf{ND}\\) are identified in the present section and are referred\nto as such in the rest of the entry.]  \n\nIdentity may be formalized in the language \\(L\\) of classical\nfirst-order logic (FOL) by selecting a two place predicate of\n\\(L\\), rewriting it as ‘=’, and adopting the universal\nclosures of the following two postulates: \n\nwhere the formula \\(\\phi(x)\\) is like the formula\n\\(\\phi(y)\\) except for having occurrences of \\(x\\) at some\nor all of the places \\(\\phi(y)\\) has occurrences of \\(y\\)\n(see Enderton 2000, for a precise definition). Ref is the principle of\nthe reflexivity of identity and LL (Leibniz’ Law) is\nthe principle of the indiscernibility of identicals. It says\nin effect that identical objects cannot differ in any respect. The\nother characteristic properties of identity, symmetry\n\\((x = y \\rightarrow y = x)\\), and\ntransitivity \\((x = y \\amp y = z \\rightarrow x = z)\\), may be deduced from Ref and\nLL. Any relation that is reflexive, transitive, and symmetric is called\nan ‘equivalence relation’. Thus, identity is an equivalence\nrelation satisfying LL. But not all equivalence relations satisfy LL.\nFor example, the relation x and y are the same size is an\nequivalence relation that does not satisfy LL (with respect to a rich\nlanguage such as English). \n\nLet \\(E\\) be an equivalence relation defined on a set \\(A\\). For \\(x\\)\nin \\(A\\), \\([x]\\) is the set of all \\(y\\) in \\(A\\) such that \\(E(x,\ny)\\); this is the equivalence class of x determined by E. The\nequivalence relation \\(E\\) divides the set \\(A\\) into mutually\nexclusive equivalence classes whose union is \\(A\\).  The family of\nsuch equivalence classes is called ‘the partition of \\(A\\)\ninduced by \\(E\\)’. \n\nNow let \\(A\\) be a set and define the relation \\(I(A,x,y)\\) as\nfollows: For \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in \\(A\\), \\(I(A,x,y)\\) if and only if for\neach subset \\(X\\) of \\(A\\), either \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are both elements\nof \\(X\\) or neither is an element of \\(X\\).  This definition is\nequivalent to the more usual one identifying the identity relation on\na set \\(A\\) with the set of ordered pairs of the form \\(\\langle x,x\\rangle\\)\nfor \\(x\\) in \\(A\\).  The present definition proves more helpful in\nwhat follows. \n\nSuppose for the moment that we do not assign any special\ninterpretation to the identity symbol. We treat it like any other two\nplace predicate. Let \\(M\\) be a structure for \\(L\\) and assume that\nRef and LL are true in \\(M\\). Call the relation defined in \\(M\\) by\nthe conjunction of Ref and LL ‘indiscernibility’ (see\nEnderton 2000, for the definition of definability in a\nstructure). There are three important points to note about the\nrelationship between indiscernibility, and the relation\n\\(I(A,x,y)\\). First, indiscernibility need not be the relation\n\\(I(A,x,y)\\) (where \\(A\\) is the domain of the structure). It might be\nan equivalence relation \\(E\\) having the property that for some\nelements \\(u,v\\), of the domain, \\(E(u,v)\\) holds, although\n\\(I(A,u,v)\\) fails. Secondly, there is no way to “correct\nfor” this possibility. There is no sentence or set of sentences\nthat could be added to the list beginning with Ref and LL that would\nguarantee that indiscernibility coincides with \\(I(A,x,y)\\). This fact\nis usually expressed by saying that identity is not a first-order or\n“elementary” relation. (For a proof, see Hodges 1983.)\nHowever, in a language such as set theory (as usually interpreted) or\nsecond-order logic, in which there is a quantifier ‘all\n\\(X\\)’ permitting quantification over all subsets of a given\nset, \\(I(A,x,y)\\) is definable. \n\nThird, given any structure \\(M\\) for \\(L\\) in which Ref and LL are\ntrue, there is a corresponding structure \\(QM\\), the ‘quotient\nstructure’ determined by \\(M\\), in which\nindiscernibility does coincide with \\(I(A,x,y)\\). \\(QM\\) is\nobtained in roughly the following way: Let the elements of \\(QM\\) be\nthe equivalence classes \\([x]\\), for elements \\(x\\) of \\(M\\)\ndetermined by indiscernibility in \\(M\\). If \\(F\\) is a one-place\npredicate true in \\(M\\) of some object \\(x\\) in \\(M\\), then define\n\\(F\\) to be true of \\([x]\\) in \\(QM\\), and similarly for many-place\npredicates and constants. It can then be shown that any sentence true\nin \\(M\\) is true in \\(QM\\), and vice versa. The existence of quotient\nstructures makes it possible to treat the identity symbol as a logical\nconstant interpreted in terms of \\(I(A,x,y)\\).  There is in fact in\ngeneral no other way to guarantee that Ref and LL will hold\nin every structure. (As Quine (1970) points out, however,\na finite language will always contain a predicate satisfying\nRef and LL in any structure; cf. Hodges 1983.) The alternative,\nhowever, is to view FOL with Ref and LL (FOL\\(^=)\\) as a proper theory\nin whose models (structures in which Ref and LL hold) there will be an\nequivalence relation \\(E\\) such that if \\(E(x,y)\\) holds, then \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) will be indiscernible with respect to the defined\nsubsets of the domain. But we cannot in general assume that every\nsubset of the domain is definable. If the domain is infinite, \\(L\\)\nruns out of defining formulas long before the domain runs out of\nsubsets. Nonetheless, a strong metatheorem asserts that any set of\nformulas that has a model, has a countable (finite or denumerable)\nmodel. This means that the difference between indiscernibility and\n\\(I(A,x,y)\\) is minimized at least to the extent that, for a\nsufficiently rich language such as \\(L\\), the valid formulas\nconcerning indiscernibility (i.e., the formulas true in every model of\nwhat is termed below ‘the pure \\(L\\)-theory with\nidentity’) coincide with the valid formulas concerning\n\\(I(A,x,y)\\). (See Epstein 2001 for a sketch of a proof of this fact.)\nThis is not to say, however, that there isn’t a significant\ndifference between identity qua indiscernibility and\nidentity qua \\(I(A,x,y)\\) (see below). Both points of view\n— that FOL\\(^=\\) is a proper theory and that it is a logic\n— may be found in the literature (Quine 1970). The latter is the\nmore usual view and it will count here as part of the standard account\nof identity. \n\nAssume that \\(L'\\) is some fragment of \\(L\\)\ncontaining a subset of the predicate symbols of \\(L\\) and the\nidentity symbol. Let \\(M\\) be a structure for \\(L'\\)\nand suppose that some identity statement \\(a = b\\) (where\n\\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are individual constants) is true in\n\\(M\\), and that Ref and LL are true in \\(M\\). Now expand\n\\(M\\) to a structure \\(M'\\) for a richer language\n— perhaps \\(L\\) itself. That is, assume we add some\npredicates to \\(L'\\) and interpret them as usual in\n\\(M\\) to obtain an expansion \\(M'\\) of\n\\(M\\). Assume that Ref and LL are true in \\(M'\\) and\nthat the interpretation of the terms \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remains\nthe same. Is \\(a = b\\) true in \\(M'\\)? That\ndepends. If the identity symbol is treated as a logical constant, the\nanswer is “yes.” But if it is treated as a non-logical symbol, then it\ncan happen that \\(a = b\\) is false in \\(M'\\). The\nindiscernibility relation defined by the identity symbol in \\(M\\)\nmay differ from the one it defines in \\(M'\\); and in\nparticular, the latter may be more “fine-grained” than the former. In\nthis sense, if identity is treated as a logical constant, identity is\nnot “language relative;” whereas if identity is treated as a\nnon-logical notion, it \\(is\\) language relative. For this reason\nwe can say that, treated as a logical constant, identity is\n‘unrestricted’. For example, let \\(L'\\) be a\nfragment of \\(L\\) containing only the identity symbol and a\nsingle one-place predicate symbol; and suppose that the identity\nsymbol is treated as non-logical. The formula \n\nis then true in any structure for \\(L'\\) in which Ref and\nLL are true. The reason is that the unique one-place predicate of\n\\(L'\\) divides the domain of a structure into those objects\nit satisfies and those it does not. Hence, at least two of any group of\nthree objects will be indiscernible. On the other hand, if the identity\nsymbol is interpreted as \\(I(A,x,y)\\),\nthis formula is false in any structure for \\(L'\\) with three\nor more elements. \n\nIf we do wish to view identity as a non-logical notion, then the\nphenomenon of language relativity suggests that it is best not to\nformalize identity using a single identity predicate ‘=’.\nInstead, we have the following picture: We begin with a language\n\\(L\\) and define an L-theory with identity to be a\ntheory whose logical axioms are those of FOL and which is such that\n\\(L\\) contains a two-place predicate\n\\(E_L\\) satisfying the non-logical axiom\nRef’ and the non-logical axiom schema LL\\('\\): \n\nThe pure \\(L\\)-theory with identity is the\n\\(L\\)-theory whose sole non-logical axiom is Ref’ and whose sole\nnon-logical axiom schema is LL\\('\\). \n\nNow the phenomenon of language relativity can be described more\naccurately as follows. Let \\(L_1\\) be a sublanguage of \\(L_2\\) and\nassume that \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) are, respectively, the pure\n\\(L_1\\)-theory with identity and the pure \\(L_2\\)-theory with\nidentity. Let \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_2\\) be models of \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\),\nrespectively, having the same domain. Assume that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are\nindividual constants having the same interpretation in \\(M_1\\) and\n\\(M_2\\).  Let \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) be the identity symbols of \\(L_1\\)\nand \\(L_2\\). It can happen that \\(E_1 (a,b)\\) is true in \\(M_1\\) but\n\\(E_2 (a,b)\\) is false in \\(M_2\\). We can then say, with Geach (1967;\nsee §4) and others, that the self-same objects indiscernible\naccording to one theory may be discernible according to another. \n\nThere are two further philosophically significant features of the\nstandard account of identity. First, identity is a necessary\nrelation: If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are rigid terms (terms whose\nreference does not vary with respect to parameters such as time or\npossible world) then \n\nAssuming certain modal principles, the necessity of distinctness (ND)\nfollows from NI.  \n\nNote that the necessary truth of \\(a = b\\) does not imply the\nnecessary existence of objects \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). We may assume\nthat what a rigid term \\(a\\) denotes at a possible world (or\nmoment of time) \\(w\\) need not exist in \\(w\\). Secondly, we\ndo not ordinarily say things of the form “\\(x\\) is the same as\n\\(y\\)”. Instead, we say “\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same\nperson” or “\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same book”. The standard\nview is that the identity component of such statements is just\n‘\\(x\\) is the same as \\(y\\)’. For example,\naccording to the standard view, ‘\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are\nthe same person’ reduces to ‘\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are\npersons and \\(x\\) is the same as \\(y\\)’, where the\nsecond conjunct may be formalized as in FOL\\(^=\\).  \n\nThe concept of identity, simple and settled though it may seem (as\ncharacterized by the standard account), gives rise to a great deal of\nphilosophical perplexity. A few (by no means all) of the salient\nproblems are outlined below. These are presented in the form of\nparadoxes — arguments from apparently undeniable premises to\nobviously unacceptable conclusions. The aim here is to make clear just\nwhat options are available to one who would stick close to the\nstandard account. Often (but not always) little or no defense or\ncritique of any particular option is offered. In the next section, we\nshall see what the relative identity alternative offers by comparison. \n\nThe most fundamental puzzle about identity is the problem of change.\nSuppose we have two photographs of a dog, Oscar. In one, \\(A\\),\nOscar is a puppy, in the other, \\(B\\), he is old and gray muzzled.\nYet we hold that he is the same dog, in, it appears, direct violation\nof LL. More explicitly, \\(B\\) is a photograph of an old dog with a\ngray muzzle; \\(A\\) is a photograph of a young dog without a gray\nmuzzle. \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are photographs of the same dog. But\naccording to LL, if the dog in \\(B\\) has a property (e.g., having\na gray muzzle) that the dog in \\(A\\) lacks, then \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) are not photographs of the same dog. Contradiction. \n\nVarious solutions have been proposed. The most popular are the\nfollowing two: (1) Simple properties such as having or lacking a gray\nmuzzle are actually relations to times. Oscar has the property of\nlacking a gray muzzle at time t and the property of having a\ngray muzzle at (a later) \\(t'\\); but there is no\nincompatibility, since being thus and so related to time \\(t\\) and\nnot being thus and so related to time \\(t'\\) are compatible\nconditions, and hence change involves no violation of LL. (2) Oscar is\nan object that is extended in time as well as space. The puppy Oscar\nand old gray muzzled Oscar are distinct temporal parts or stages of the\nwhole temporally extended Oscar. The photograph of Oscar as a puppy is\ntherefore not a photograph of Oscar at all. There cannot be still\nphotographs of Oscar. \n\nThese proposals may seem plausible, and indeed most philosophers\nsubscribe to one or other of them. The most common objections —\nthat on the temporal parts account, objects are not “wholly present”\nat any given time, and that on the relations-to-times account,\nseemingly simply properties of objects, such as Oscar having a gray\nmuzzle, are complicated relations — do little more than affirm\nwhat their targets deny. Yet the objections are an attempt to give\nvoice to a strong intuition concerning our experience as creatures\nexisting in time. Both (1) and (2) treat time and change from a “God’s\neye” point of view. (1) presupposes time laid out “all at once”, so to\nspeak, and similarly for (2). But we experience no such\nthing. Instead, while we are prepared to wait to see the whole of a\nbaseball game we are watching, we are not prepared to wait to see the\nwhole of painting we are viewing.. \n\nThe following paradox — a variation of the paradox of change\n— raises some new questions. It is due to the Stoic philosopher\nChrysippus (c.280 B.C.-c.206 B.C.) and has been resurrected\nby Michael Burke (Burke 1994). Suppose that at some point\n\\(t'\\) in the future poor Oscar loses his tail. Consider\nthe proper part of Oscar, as he is now (at \\(t)\\), consisting of\nthe whole of Oscar minus his tail. Call this object\n‘ Oscar-minus ‘. Chrysippus wished to know\nwhich of these objects — Oscar or Oscar-minus — survives\nat \\(t'\\). According to the standard account of identity,\nOscar and Oscar-minus are distinct at \\(t\\). and hence, by ND,\nthey are distinct at \\(t'\\). (Intuitively, Oscar and\nOscar-minus are distinct at \\(t'\\) since Oscar has a\nproperty at \\(t'\\) that Oscar-minus lacks, namely, the\nproperty of having had a tail at \\(t\\). Notice that this argument\ninvolves a tacit appeal to ND — or NI, depending on how you look\nat it). Hence, if both survive, we have a case of two distinct\nphysical objects occupying exactly the same space at the same\ntime. Assuming that is impossible, and assuming, as commonsense\ndemands, that Oscar survives the loss of his tail, it follows that\nOscar-minus does not survive. This conclusion is paradoxical because\nit appears that nothing happens to Oscar-minus in the\ninterval between \\(t\\) and \\(t'\\) that would cause it\nto perish. \n\nOne extreme option is to deny that there are such things as\nOscar-minus. Undetached proper parts of objects don’t exist (van\nInwagen 1981). Another is to claim that the parts of an object are\nessential to it (Chisholm 1973). A third, less extreme, option is to\ninsist that objects of different kinds, e.g., a clay statue\nand the piece of clay it is composed of, can occupy the same\nspace at the same time, but objects of the same kind, e.g., two\nstatues, cannot (Wiggins 1968; for refinements, see Oderberg\n1996). A fourth option is to claim that Oscar and Oscar-minus are two\ndistinct, temporally extended objects — a dog part, Oscar-minus,\nand a dog, Oscar — that overlap at \\(t'\\). Temporal\nparts of distinct objects can occupy the same space at the same\ntime. \n\n(This paradox is also known as the paradox of 1001 cats; Geach 1980,\nLewis 1993): Focus on Oscar and Oscar-minus at t —\nbefore Oscar loses his tail. Is Oscar-minus a dog? When Oscar loses\nhis tail the resulting creature is certainly a dog. Why then should we\ndeny that Oscar-minus is a dog? We saw above that one possible\nresponse to Chrysippus’ paradox was to claim that Oscar-minus does not\nexist at \\(t'\\). But even if we adopt this view, how does\nit follow that Oscar-minus, existing as it does at \\(t\\), is not\na dog? Yet if Oscar-minus is a dog, then, given the standard account\nof identity, there are two dogs where we would normally count only\none. In fact, for each of Oscar’s hairs, of which there are at least\n101, there is a proper part of Oscar — Oscar minus a hair\n— which is just as much a dog as Oscar-minus. There are then at\nleast 101 dogs (and in fact many more) where we would count only\none. Some claim that things such as dogs are “maximal.” No proper part\nof a dog is a dog (Burke 1993). One might conclude as much simply to\navoid multiplying the number of dogs populating the space reserved for\nOscar alone. But the maximality principle may seem to be independently\njustified as well. When Oscar barks, do all these different dogs bark\nin unison? If a thing is a dog, shouldn’t it be capable of independent\naction? Yet Oscar-minus cannot act independently of\nOscar. Nevertheless, David Lewis (1993) has suggested a reason for\ncounting Oscar-minus and all the 101 dog parts that differ (in various\ndifferent ways) from one another and Oscar by a hair, as dogs, and in\nfact as Dalmatians (Oscar is a Dalmatian). Lewis invokes Unger’s\n(1980) “problem of the many.” Oscar sheds continuously but\ngradually. His hairs loosen and then dislodge, some such remaining\nstill in place. Hence, within Oscar’s compass at any given time there\nare congeries of Dalmatian parts sooner or later to become definitely\nDalmatians; some in a day, some in a second, or a split second. It\nseems arbitrary to proclaim a Dalmatian part that is a split second\naway from becoming definitely a Dalmatian, a Dalmatian, while denying\nthat one a day away is a Dalmatian. As Lewis puts it, we must either\ndeny that the “many” are Dalmatians, or we must deny that the\nDalmatians are many. Lewis endorses proposals of both types but seems\nto favor one of the latter type according to which the Dalmatians are\nnot many but rather “almost one” In any case, the standard account of\nidentity seems unable on its own to handle the paradox of 101\nDalmatians. It requires that we either deny that Oscar minus a hair is\na dog — and a Dalmatian — or else that we must affirm that\nthere is a multiplicity of Dalmatians, all but one of which is\nincapable of independent action and all of which bark in unison no\nmore loudly than Oscar barks alone. \n\nSuppose that on day 1 Jones purchases a piece of clay \\(c\\) and\nfashions it into a statue \\(s_1\\). On day 2, Jones destroys \\(s_1\\),\nbut not \\(c\\), by squeezing \\(s_1\\) into a ball and fashions a new\nstatue \\(s_2\\) out of \\(c\\). On day 3, Jones removes a part of\n\\(s_2\\), discards it, and replaces it using a new piece of clay,\nthereby destroying \\(c\\) and replacing it by a new piece of clay,\n\\(c'\\). Presumably, \\(s_2\\) survives this change. Now what is the\nrelationship between the pieces of clay and the statues they\n“constitute?” A natural answer is: identity. On day \\(1,\nc\\) is identical to \\(s_1\\) and on day \\(2, c\\) is identical to\n\\(s_2\\). On day \\(3, s_2\\) is identical to \\(c'\\). But this conclusion\ndirectly contradicts NI. If, on day \\(1, c\\) is (identical to)\n\\(s_1\\), then it follows, given NI, that on day \\(2, s_1\\) is \\(s_2\\)\n(since \\(c\\) is identical to \\(s_2\\) on day 2) and hence that \\(s_1\\)\nexists on day 2, which it does not. By a similar argument, on day \\(3,\nc\\) is \\(c'\\) (since \\(s_2\\) is identical to both) and so \\(c\\) exists\non day 3, which it does not. We might conclude, then, that either\nconstitution is not identity or that NI is false. Neither conclusion\nis wholly welcome. Once we adopt the standard account less NI, the\nlatter principle follows directly from the assumption that individual\nvariables and constants in quantified modal logic are to be handled\nexactly as they are in first-order logic. And if constitution is not\nidentity, and yet statues, as well as pieces of clay, are physical\nobjects (and what else would they be?), then we are again forced to\naffirm that distinct physical objects may occupy (exactly) the same\nspace at the same time. The statue \\(s_1\\) and the piece of clay \\(c\\)\noccupy the same space on day 1. Even if this is deemed possible\n(Wiggins 1980), it is unparsimonious. The standard account is\nthus prima facie incompatible with the natural idea that\nconstitution is identity.  \n\nPhilosophers have not argued by direct appeal to NI or ND.\nTypically, (e.g., Gibbard 1975, Noonan 1993, Johnston 1992),\narguments that \\(c\\) and \\(s_1\\) are not identical\nrun as follows: \\(c\\) exists prior to the existence of\n\\(s_1\\) and hence the two are not identical. Again,\n\\(s_1\\) possesses the property of being such that it\nwill be destroyed by being squeezed into a ball, but \\(c\\) does\nnot possess this property \\((c\\) will be squeezed into a ball but\nit will not thereby be destroyed). So again the two are not identical.\nFurther, whatever the future in fact brings, c might have been\nsqueezed into a ball and not destroyed. Since that is not true of\n\\(s_1\\), the two are not identical. On a careful\nanalysis, however, each of these arguments can be seen to rely on NI or\nND, provided one adopts the standard account of modal/temporal\npredicates. This last proviso suggests an interesting way out for\none who adheres to the standard account of identity but who also holds\nthat constitution is identity (see below). \n\nSome philosophers find it important or at least expedient to frame\nthe issue in terms of the case of a statue \\(s\\) and piece of clay\n\\(c\\) that coincide throughout their entire existence. We bring\nboth \\(c\\) and \\(s\\) into existence by joining two other\npieces of clay together, or we do something else that guarantees total\ncoincidence. It seems that total coincidence is supposed to lend\nplausibility to the claim that, in such a case at least, constitution\nis identity (and hence NI is false — Gibbard 1975). It may do so,\npsychologically, but not logically. The same sorts of arguments against\nthe thesis that constitution is identity apply in such a case. For\nexample, \\(s\\) may be admired for its aesthetic traits, even long\nafter it ceases to exist, but this need not be true of \\(c\\). And\n\\(s\\) has the property, which \\(c\\) lacks, of being destroyed\nif squeezed into a ball. Those who defend the thesis that constitution\nis identity need to defend it in the general case of partial\ncoincidence; and those who attack the thesis do so with arguments that\nwork equal well against both total and partial coincidence. The\nassumption that \\(s\\) and \\(c\\) are totally coincident is\ntherefore inessential. \n\nThe doctrine of temporal parts offers only limited help. The\nstatement that \\(c\\) is identical to \\(s_1\\)on day\n1 but identical to \\(s_2\\) on day 2 can be construed to\nmean that \\(c\\) is a temporally extended object whose day 1 stage\nis identical to \\(s_1\\) and whose day 2 stage is\nidentical to \\(s_2\\). Since the two stages are not\nidentical, NI does not apply. Similarly, we can regard\n\\(s_2\\) as a temporally extended object that overlaps\n\\(c\\) on day 2 and \\(c'\\) on day 3. But unless temporal\nparts theorists are prepared to defend a doctrine of modally extended\nobjects — objects extended through possible worlds analogous to\nobjects extended in time, there remains a problem. \\(s_2\\)\nmight have been made of a different piece of clay, as is in\nfact the case on day 3. That is, it is logically possible for\n\\(s_2\\) to fail to coincide with the day 2 stage of\n\\(c\\). But it is not logically possible for the day 2 stage of\n\\(c\\) to fail to coincide with itself. \n\nLewis recognizes this difficulty and proposes to deal with it by\nappealing to his counterpart theory (Lewis 1971, 1986, and 1993).\nDifferent concepts, e.g., statue and piece of clay\nare associated with different counterpart relations and hence with\ndifferent criteria of trans-world identity. This has the effect of\nrendering modal predicates “Abelardian” (Noonan 1991, 1993). The\nproperty determined by a modal predicate may be affected by the subject\nterm of a sentence containing the predicate. The subject term denotes\nan object belonging to this or that kind or sort. But different kinds\nor sorts may determine different properties (or different counterpart\nrelations). In particular, the properties determined by the predicate\n‘might not have coincided with \\(c_2\\)’\n(where \\(c_2\\) names the day 2 stage of \\(c)\\) in\nthe following sentences, \n\nare different, and hence (a) and (b) are compatible, even\nassuming that \\(s_2\\) and \\(c_2\\) are\nidentical. (It should be emphasized that counterpart theory is not the\nonly means of obtaining Abelardian predicates. See Noonan 1991.) \n\nThe upshot seems to be that that the advocate of the standard\naccount of identity must maintain either that constitution is not\nidentity or that modal predicates are Abelardian. The latter option may\nbe the fruitful one, since for one thing it seems to have applications\nthat go beyond the issue of constitution. \n\n(See Plutarch, Life of Theseus.) Imagine a wooden ship\nrestored by replacing all its planks and beams (and other parts) by new\nones. Plutarch reports that such a ship was “… a model for the\nphilosophers with respect to the disputed arguments … some of them\nsaying it remained the same, some of them saying it did not remain the\nsame” (cf. Rea 1995). Hobbes added the catch that the old parts are\nreassembled to create another ship exactly like the original. Both the\nrestored ship and the reassembled one appear to qualify equally to be\nthe original. In the one case, the original is “remodeled”, in the\nother, it is reassembled. Yet the two resulting ships are clearly not\nthe same ship.  \n\nSome have proposed that in a case like this our ordinary “criteria\nof identity” fail us. The process of dismantling and reassembling\nusually preserves identity, as does the process of part replacement\n(otherwise no soldier could be issued just one rifle and body shops\nwould function as manufacturers). But in this case the two processes\nproduce conflicting results: We get two ships, one of which is the same\nship as the original, by one set of criteria, and the other is the\noriginal ship by another set of criteria. There is a similar conflict\nof criteria in the case of personal identity: Brain duplication\nscenarios (Wiggins 1967, Parfit 1984) suggest that it is logically\npossible for one person to split into two competitors, each with equal\nclaim to be the original person. We take it for granted that brain\nduplication will preserve the psychological properties normally\nrelevant to reidentifying persons and we also take it for granted that\nthe original brain continues to embody these properties even after it\nis duplicated. In this sense there is a conflict of criteria. Such a\ncase of “fission” gives us two distinct embodiments of these\nproperties. \n\nPerhaps we should conclude that identity is not what matters.\nInstead, what matters is some other relation, but one that\naccounts as readily as identity for such facts as that the owner of the\noriginal ship would be entitled to both the restored version and the\nreassembled one. For the case of personal identity, Parfit (1984)\ndevelops such a response in detail. A related reaction would be to\nclaim that if both competitors have equal claim to be the original,\nthen neither is the original. If, however, one competitor is\ninferior, then the other wins the day and counts as the original. It\nseems that on this view certain contingencies can establish or falsify\nidentity claims. That conflicts with NI. Suppose that \\(w\\) is a\npossible world in which no ship is assembled from the discarded parts\nof the remodeled ship. In this world, then, the remodeled ship is the\noriginal. By NI, the restored ship and the original are identical in\nthe actual world, contrary to the claim of the “best candidate”\ndoctrine (which says that neither the remodeled nor the reassembled\nship is the original). There are, however, more sophisticated “best\ncandidate” theories that are not vulnerable to this objection (Nozick\n1982). \n\nSome are convinced that the remodeled ship has the best claim to be\nthe original, since it exhibits a greater degree of spatio-temporal\ncontinuity with the original (Wiggins 1967). But it is unclear why the\nintuition that identity is preserved by spatio-temporal continuity\nshould take precedence over the intuition that identity is preserved in\nthe process of dismantlement and reassembly. Furthermore, certain\nversions of the ship of Theseus problem do not involve the feature that\none of the ships competing to be the original possesses a greater\ndegree of spatio-temporal continuity with the original than does the\nother (see below). Others are equally convinced that identity is\nnot preserved by total part replacement. This view is often\nsuggested blindly, as a stab in the dark, but there is in fact an\ninteresting argument in its favor. Kripke (1980) argues that a table\nmade out of a particular hunk of wood could not have been\nmade out of a (totally) different hunk of wood. His reasoning is this:\nSuppose that in the actual world a table \\(T\\) is made out of a hunk\nof wood \\(H\\); and suppose that there is a possible world \\(w\\) in\nwhich this very table, \\(T\\), is made out of a different hunk of wood,\n\\(H'\\). Then assuming that \\(H\\) and \\(H'\\) are completely unrelated\n(for example, they do not overlap), so that making a table out of the\none is not somehow dependent upon making a table out of the other,\nthere is another possible world \\(w'\\) in which \\(T\\), as in the\nactual world, is made out of \\(H\\), and another table \\(T'\\), exactly\nsimilar to \\(T\\), is made out of \\(H'\\). Since \\(T\\) and \\(T'\\) are\nnot identical in \\(w'\\), it follows by ND that the table made out of\n\\(H'\\) in \\(w\\) is not \\(T\\). Note, however, that the argument assumes\nthat the table made out of \\(H'\\) in \\(w'\\) is the same table as the\ntable made out of \\(H'\\) in \\(w\\). \n\nKripke’s reasoning can be applied to the present case (Kripke and\nothers might dispute this claim; see below). Let \\(w\\) be a\npossible world just like the actual world in that \\(O\\), the\noriginal ship, is manufactured exactly as it is in the actual world. In\n\\(w\\), however, another ship, \\(S'\\), exactly similar\nto \\(O\\), is simultaneously built out of precisely the same parts\nthat \\(S\\), the remodeled ship, is built out of in the actual\nworld. Since \\(S'\\) and \\(O\\) are clearly different\nships in \\(w\\), it follows by ND that \\(O\\) and \\(S\\)\nare not the same ship in the actual world. Note again that the argument\nassumes that \\(S\\) and \\(S'\\) are the same ship, but it\nseems quite a stretch to deny that. Nevertheless, some have done so.\nCarter,1987 claims (in effect) that \\(S\\) and \\(S'\\)\nare not identical, but his argument simply assumes that\n\\(O\\) and \\(S\\) are the same ship. Alternatively, one might\nview the (Kripkean) argument as showing only that while \\(S\\) is\nthe same ship as \\(O\\) in the actual world, \\(S\\) (that is,\n\\(S')\\) is not the same ship as \\(O\\) in \\(w\\).\nBut this is not an option for one who adheres to the standard account\nand hence adheres to ND. In defending this view, however, Gallois,\n(1986, 1988) suggests a weakened notion of rigid designation and a\ncorresponding weakened formulation of ND. (See Carter 1987 for\ncriticism of Gallois’ proposals. See also Chandler 1975 for a\nprecursor of Gallois’ argument.) \n\nIf we grant that \\(O\\) and \\(S\\) cannot be the same ship,\nwe seem to have a solution to the ship of Theseus paradox. By the\nKripkean argument, only the reassembled ship has any claim to being the\noriginal ship, \\(O\\). But this success is short lived. For we are\nleft with the following additional paradox: Suppose that \\(S\\)\neventuates from \\(O\\) by replacing one part of \\(O\\) one day\nat a time. There seems to be widespread agreement that replacing just\none part of a thing by a new exactly similar part preserves the\nidentity of the thing. If so, then, by the transitivity of identity,\n\\(O\\) and \\(S\\) must be the same ship. It follows that either\nthe Kripkean argument is incorrect, or replacement of even a single\npart (or small portion) does not preserve identity (a view known as\n“mereological essentialism;” Chisholm 1973). \n\nAs indicated, Kripke denies that his argument (for the necessity of\norigin) applies to the case of change over time: “The question whether\nthe table could have changed into ice is irrelevant here”\n(1972, 1980). So the question whether \\(O\\) could change into\n\\(S\\) is supposedly “irrelevant.” But Kripke does not give a\nreason for this claim, and if cases of trans-temporal identity and\ntrans-world identity differ markedly in relevant respects — respects\nrelevant to Kripke’s argument for the necessity of origin, it is not\nobvious what they are. (But see Forbes 1985, and Lewis 1986, for\ndiscussion.) The argument above was simply that \\(O\\) and\n\\(S\\) cannot be the same ship since there is a possible world in\nwhich they differ. If this argument is incorrect it is no doubt because\nthere are conclusive reasons showing that \\(S\\) and\n\\(S'\\) differ. Even so, such reasons are clearly not\n“irrelevant.” One may suspect that, if applied to the trans-temporal\ncase, Kripke’s reasoning will yield an argument for mereological\nessentialism. Indeed, a trans-world counterpart of such an argument has\nbeen tried (Chandler 1976, though Chandler views his argument somewhat\ndifferently). In its effect, this argument does not differ essentially\nfrom the “paradox” sketched in the previous paragraph (which may well\nbe viewed as an argument for mereological essentialism). Subsequent\ncommentators, e.g., Salmon, (1979) and Chandler (1975, 1976), do not\nseem to take Kripke’s admonition of irrelevance seriously. \n\nIn any case, there \\(is\\) a close connection between the two issues\n(the ship of Theseus problem and the question of the necessity of\norigin). This can be seen (though it may already be clear) by\nconsidering a modified version of the ship of Theseus problem. Suppose\nthat when \\(O\\) is built, another ship \\(O'\\), exactly like \\(O\\), is\nalso built. Suppose that \\(O'\\) never sets sail, but instead is used\nas a kind of graphic repair manual and parts repository for\n\\(O\\). Over time, planks are removed from \\(O'\\) and used to replace\ncorresponding planks of \\(O\\). The result is a ship \\(S\\) made wholly\nof planks from \\(O'\\) and standing (in the end), we may suppose, in\nexactly the place \\(O'\\) has always stood. Now do \\(O\\) and \\(O'\\)\nhave equal claim to be \\(S\\)? And can we then declare that neither is\n\\(S\\)? Not according to the Kripkean line of thought. It looks for all\nthe world as though the process of “remodeling” \\(O\\) is\nreally just an elaborate means of dismantling and reassembling\n\\(O'\\). And if \\(O'\\) and \\(S\\) are the same ship, then since \\(O\\)\nand \\(O'\\) are distinct, \\(O\\) and \\(S\\) cannot be the same ship. \n\nThis argument is vulnerable to the following two important\ncriticisms: First, it conflicts with the common sense principle that\n(1) the material of an object can be totally replenished or replaced\nwithout affecting its identity (Salmon 1979); and secondly, as\nmentioned, it conflicts with the additional common sense principle that\n(2) replacement by a single part or small portion preserves identity.\nThese objections may seem to provide sufficient grounds for rejecting\nthe Kripkean argument and perhaps restricting the application of\nKripke’s original argument for the necessity of origin (Noonan 1983).\nThere is, however, a rather striking problem with (2), and it is\nunclear whether the conflict between (1) and the Kripkean argument\nshould be resolved in favor of the former. \n\nThe problem with (2) is this. Pick a simple sort of objects, say,\nshoes, or better, sandals. Suppose \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two exactly\nsimilar sandals, one of which \\((A)\\) is brand new and the other\n\\((B)\\) is worn out. Each consists of a top strap and a sole, nothing\nmore. If \\(B\\)’s worn strap is replaced by \\(A\\)’s new\none, (2) dictates that the resulting sandal is \\(B\\)\n“refurbished.” In fact, if the parts of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nare simply exchanged, (2) dictates that that the sandal with the new\nparts, \\(A'\\), is \\(B\\) and the sandal with the old parts, \\(B'\\), is\n\\(A\\). It follows by ND that \\(A\\) and \\(A'\\) and \\(B\\) and \\(B'\\) are\ndistinct. This is surely the wrong result. The intuition that \\(A\\)\nand \\(A'\\) are the same sandal is very strong; and the process of\nexchanging the parts of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) seems to amount to nothing\nmore than the dismantling and reassembling of each. This example is no\ndifferent in principle than the more elaborate trans-world cases\ndiscussed by Chisholm (1967), Chandler (1976), Salmon (1979), or Gupta\n(1980). (One who claims that \\(A\\) and \\(A'\\) differ in that \\(A'\\)\ncomes into existence after \\(A\\), does not have much to go on.  \\(A\\)\ncannot be supposed to persist after \\(A'\\) comes into existence. We do\nnot end up with two new sandals and one old one. Why then\ncouldn’t it be \\(A\\) itself that reappears at the later\ntime?) \n\nThe following paradox — perhaps the ultimate paradox of identity\n— derives from an argument of Church (1982). Suppose Pierre\nthinks that London and Londres are different cities, but of course\ndoesn’t think that London is different from London, or that Londres is\ndifferent from Londres. Assuming that proper names lack Fregean\nsenses, we can apply LL to get the result that London and Londres\nare distinct. We have here an argument that, given the\nstandard account of identity, merely thinking that \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) are distinct is enough to make them so. There are, of\ncourse, a number of ways around this conclusion without abandoning the\nstandard account of identity. Church himself saw the argument (his\nversion of it) as demonstrating the inadequacy of Russellian\nintensional logic — in which variables and constants operate as\nthey do in extensional logic, i.e., unequipped with senses. (For\nanother reaction, see Salmon 1986.) But there are strong arguments\nagainst the view that names (or variables) have senses (Kripke\n1980). In light of these arguments, Church’s argument may be viewed as\nposing yet another paradox of identity. \n\nThe general form of Church’s argument has been exploited by others\nto reach further puzzling conclusions. For example, it has been used to\nshow that there can be no such thing as vague or “indeterminate”\nidentity (Evans 1978; and for discussion, Parsons 2000). For\n\\(x\\) is not vaguely identical to \\(x\\); hence, if \\(x\\)\nis assumed to be vaguely identical to \\(y\\), then by LL,\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are (absolutely) distinct. As it stands,\nEvans’ argument shows at best that vaguely identical objects must be\nabsolutely distinct, not that there is no such thing as vague identity.\nBut some have tried to amend the argument to get Evans’ conclusion\n(Parsons 2000; and see the entry on vagueness). In any case, it is\nuseful to see the connection between Evans’ argument and Church’s. If,\nfor example, ‘vaguely identical’ is taken to mean\n‘thought to be identical’, then the two arguments collapse\ninto one another. Church’s line of argument would seem to lead\nultimately to the extreme antirealist position that any perceived\ndifference among objects is a real difference. If one resolves not to\nattempt to escape the clutches of LL by some clever dodge — by\ndisallowing straightforward quantifying-in, for example, as with the\ndoctrine of Abelardian predicates — one comes quickly to the absurd\nconclusion that no statement of the form \\(x = y\\), where\nthe terms are different, or are just different tokens of the same type,\ncan be true. Yet it might just be that the fault lies not in ourselves,\nbut in LL. \n\nThe Christian doctrine of Trinity is sometimes construed as a paradox\nthat involves incongruent identity statements. For example, the\nAthanasian Creed puts it like this: “[…] we worship one God in\nTrinity. […] the Father is God; the Son is God; and the Holy Ghost\nis God. And yet they are not three Gods; but one God.” One may\nconceptually unbundle these statements into the the following set of\nclaims: \nIt is easy to see that this set is logically inconsistent and\nconsequently one may claim that the doctrine itself is conceptually\nincongruent. \n\nThe fundamental claim of relative identity-the claim the various\nversions of the idea have in common-is that, as it seems in the\npassenger/person case, it can and does happen that \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\) and (yet) \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\nare not the same G. Now it is usually supposed that if \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\) (G etc.), then that implies that\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are \\(F\\)s \\((G\\)s, etc.) If so,\nthen the above schema is trivially satisfied by the case in which\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same person but \\(x\n(y)\\) is not a passenger at all. But let us resolve to use the\nphrase ‘\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are different\n\\(G\\)s’ to mean ‘\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are\n\\(G\\)s and \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are not the same\n\\(G\\)’. Then the nontrivial core claim about relative\nidentity is that the following may well be true:  \n\nRI is a very interesting thesis. It seems to yield dramatically\nsimple solutions to (at least some of) the puzzles about identity. We\nappear to be in a position to assert that young Oscar and old Oscar are\nthe same dog but nonetheless distinct “temporary” objects; that Oscar\nand Oscar-minus are the same dog but different dog parts; that the same\npiece of clay can be now (identical to) one statue and now another;\nthat London and Londres are the same city but different “objects of\nthought,” and so forth. Doubts develop quickly, however. Either the\nsame dog relation satisfies LL or it does not. If it does not,\nit is unclear why it should be taken to be a relation of\nidentity. But if it satisfies LL, then it follows, given that\nOscar and Oscar-minus are different dog parts, that Oscar-minus is not\nthe same dog part as Oscar-minus. Furthermore, assuming that the\nsame dog part relation is reflexive, it follows from\nthe assumption that Oscar-minus and Oscar-minus are the same dog (and\nthat LL is in force), that Oscar and Oscar-minus are indeed the same\ndog part, which in fact they are not. \n\nIt may seem, then, that RI is simply incoherent. These arguments,\nhowever, are a bit too quick. On analysis, they show only that the\nfollowing three conditions form an inconsistent triad: (1) RI is true\n(for some fixed predicates \\(F\\) and \\(G)\\). (2) Identity\nrelations are equivalence relations. (3) The relation x and y are\nthe same F figuring in (1) satisfies LL. For suppose that the\nrelation x and y are the same G, figuring in (1), is reflexive\nand that \\(x\\) is a \\(G\\). Then \\(x\\) is the same\n\\(G\\) as \\(x\\). But according to (1), \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) are not the same \\(G\\)s; hence, according to (3), it is\nnot the case that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\);\nyet (1) asserts otherwise. Now, most relative identity theorists\nmaintain that while identity relations are equivalence relations, they\ndo not in general satisfy LL. However, according to at least one\nanalysis of the passenger/person case (and others), the same\nperson relation satisfies LL but the same passenger\nrelation is not straightforwardly an equivalence relation (Gupta\n1980). It should be clear though that this view is incompatible with\nthe principle of the identity of indiscernibles: If \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) are different passengers, there must be, by the latter\nprinciple, some property \\(x\\) possesses that \\(y\\) does not.\nHence if the same person relation satisfies LL, it follows\nthat \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are not the same person. For\nthe remainder we will assume that identity relations are equivalence\nrelations. Given this assumption, (and assuming that the underlying\npropositional logic is classical — cf. Parsons 2000) RI and LL are\nincompatible in the sense that within the framework of a single fixed\nlanguage for which LL is defined, RI and LL are incompatible. \n\nYet the advocate of relative identity cannot simply reject any form\nof LL. There are true and indispensable instances of LL: If \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) are the same dog, then, surely, if \\(x\\) is a\nDalmatian, so is \\(y\\). The problem is that of formulating and\nmotivating restricted forms of LL that are nonetheless strong\nenough to bear the burden of identity claims. There has been little\nsystematic work done in this direction, crucial though it is to the\nrelative identity project. (See Deutsch 1997 for discussion of this\nissue.) There are, however, equivalence relations that do satisfy\nrestricted forms of LL. These are sometimes called ‘congruence\nrelations’ and they turn up frequently in mathematics. For\nexample, say that integers \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) are congruent if\ntheir difference \\(n - m\\) is a multiple of 3. This\nrelation preserves multiplication and addition, but not every property.\nThe numbers 2 and 11 are thus congruent but 2 is even and 11 is not.\nThere are also non-mathematical congruencies. For example, the relation\nx and y are traveling at the same speed preserves certain\nproperties and not others. If objects \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are\ntraveling at the same speed and \\(x\\) is traveling faster than\n\\(z\\), the same is true of \\(y\\). Such similarity relations\nsatisfy restricted forms of LL. In fact, any equivalence relation\nsatisfies a certain minimal form of LL (see below). \n\nThere are strong and weak versions of RI. The weak version says that\nRI has some (in fact, many) true instances but also that there are\npredicates \\(F\\) such that if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the\nsame \\(F\\), then, for any equivalence relation, \\(E\\),\nwhatsoever (whether or not an identity relation),\n\\(E(x,y)\\). This last condition implies that the\nrelation x and y are the same F satisfies LL. The relation\n\\(P\\) defined so that \\(P(x,y)\\) if and\nonly if \\(H(x)\\) and \\(H(y)\\), where\n\\(H\\) is some predicate, is an equivalence relation. Hence, if\n\\(H\\) holds of \\(x\\) but not of \\(y\\), there is an\nequivalence relation (namely, \\(P(x,y))\\) that\nfails to hold of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). If we add that in this\ninstance ‘\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same\n\\(F\\)’ is to be interpreted in terms of the relation\n\\(I(A,x,y)\\), then the weak version of\nRI says that there is such a thing as relative identity and such a\nthing as absolute identity as well. The strong version, by contrast,\nsays that there are (many) true instances of RI but there is no such\nthing as absolute identity. It is difficult to know what to make of the\nlatter claim. Taken literally, it is false. The notion of unrestricted\nidentity (in the sense of ‘unrestricted’ explained in\n§1) is demonstrably coherent. We return to this matter in §5\n. \n\nThe puzzles about identity outlined in §2 (and there are many\nothers, as well as many variants of these) put considerable pressure on\nthe standard account. A theory of identity that allows for instances of\nRI is an attractive alternative (see below §4). But there is a\ncertain kind of example of RI, frequently discussed in the literature,\nthat has given relative identity something of a bad name. The\npassenger/person example is a case in point. The noun\n‘passenger’ is derived from the corresponding relational\nexpression ‘passenger in (on) …’. A passenger is\nsomeone who is a passenger in some vehicle (on some flight, etc.).\nSimilarly, a father is man who fathers someone or who is the father of\nsomeone. This way of defining a kind of things from a relation between\nthings is perfectly legitimate and altogether open-ended. Given any\nrelation \\(R\\), we can define ‘an R’ to apply to\nanything \\(x\\) that stands in \\(R\\) to something \\(y\\).\nFor example, we can define a ‘schmapple’ to be an apple in\na barrel. All this is fine. But we can’t infer from such a\ndefinition that the same apple might be two different schmapples. From\nthe fact that someone is the father of two different children, we don’t\njudge that he is two different fathers. The fact that airlines choose\nto count passengers as they do, rather than track persons, is their\nbusiness, not logic’s. \n\nHowever, when \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation, we are entitled\nto such an inference. Consider the notorious case of “surmen” (Geach\n1967). A pair of men are the “same surman” if they have the same\nsurname; and a surman is a man who bears this relation to someone. So\nnow it appears that that two different men can be the same surman,\nsince two different men can have the same surname. As Geach (1967)\ninsists (also Geach 1973), surmen are defined to be men, so\nthey are not merely classes of men. Hence we seem to have an instance\nof RI, and obviously any similarity relation (e.g., \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) have the same shape) will give rise to a similar case. Yet\nsuch instances of RI are not very interesting. It is granted all around\nthat when ‘\\(F\\)’ is adjectival, different \\(G\\)s\nmay be the same \\(F\\). Different men may have the same surname,\ndifferent objects, the same color, etc. Turning an adjectival\nsimilarity relation into a substantival one having the form of an\nidentity statement yields an identity statement in name only. \n\nA word about the point of view of those who subscribe to the weak\nversion of RI. The view (call it the ‘weak view’) is that\nordinary identity relations concerning (largely) the world of\ncontingency and change are equivalence relations answering to\nrestricted forms of LL. The exact nature of the restriction depends on\nthe equivalence relation itself, though there is an element of\ngenerality. The kinds of properties preserved by the same dog\nrelation are intuitively the same kinds of properties as are\npreserved by the same cat relation. From a logical point of\nview the best that can be said is that any identity relation, like any\nequivalence relation, preserves a certain minimal set of properties.\nFor suppose \\(E\\) is some equivalence relation. Let \\(S\\) be\nthe set containing all formulas of the form\n\\(E(x,y)\\), and closed under the formation of\nnegations, conjunctions, and quantification. Then \\(E\\) preserves\nany property expressed by a formula in \\(S\\). Furthermore, on this\nview, although absolutely distinct objects may be the same \\(F\\),\nabsolutely identical objects cannot differ at all. Any instance of RI\nimplies that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are absolutely distinct. \n\nLet us look back at the paradoxes of identity outlined in §2\nfrom the perspective of the weak view regarding relative identity. That\nview allows that absolutely distinct objects may be the same\n\\(F\\), but denies that absolutely identical objects can be\ndifferent \\(G\\)’s. This implies that if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\nare relatively different objects, then \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are\nabsolutely distinct, and hence only pairs of absolutely distinct\nobjects can satisfy RI. If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are absolutely\ndistinct, we shall say that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are distinct\n‘logical objects’; and similarly, if \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) are absolutely identical objects, then \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) are identical logical objects. The term ‘logical\nobject’ does not stand for some new and special kind of thing.\nAbsolutely distinct apples, for example, are distinct logical\nobjects. \n\nThe following is the barest sketch of relativist solutions to the\nparadoxes of identity discussed in §2. No attempt is made to fully\njustify any proposed solution, though a modicum of justification\nemerges in the course of §6. It should be kept in mind that some\nof the strength of the relativist solutions derives from the weaknesses\nof the absolutist alternatives, some of which are discussed in\n§2. \n\nYoung Oscar and old Oscar are the same dog but absolutely different\nthings, i.e. different logical objects. The material conditions\nrendering young Oscar and old Oscar the same dog (and the same\nDalmatian) are precisely the same as the material conditions under\nwhich young Oscar and old Oscar would qualify as temporal parts of the\nsame dog. The only difference is logical. The identity\nrelation between young Oscar and old Oscar can be formalized in an\nextensional logic (Deutsch 1997), but a theory of temporal parts\nrequires a modal/temporal apparatus. Young Oscar is wholly present\nduring his youth and possesses the simple, non-relational, property of\nnot having a gray muzzle.  \n\nOscar and Oscar-minus both survive Oscar’s loss of a tail. At both\n\\(t\\) and \\(t'\\) Oscar and Oscar-minus are the same\ndog, but at \\(t\\), Oscar and Oscar-minus are distinct logical\nobjects. This implies (by ND) that Oscar and Oscar-minus are distinct\nlogical objects even at \\(t'\\) Hence, we must allow that\ndistinct logical objects may occupy the same space at the same time.\nThis is not a problem, however. For although Oscar and Oscar-minus are\ndistinct logical objects at \\(t'\\), they are physically\ncoincident.  \n\nThe relativist denies that dogs are “maximal.” It is not true that no\nproper part of a dog is dog. All the 101 (and more) proper parts of\nOscar differing from him and from one another by a hair are dogs. In\nfact, many (though of course not all) identity preserving changes Oscar\nmight undergo correspond directly to proper parts of (an unchanged)\nOscar. But there is no problem about barking in unison, and no problem\nabout acting independently. All 101 are the same dog, despite their\ndifferences, just as young Oscar and old Oscar are the same dog, . The\nrelativist denies that the dogs are many rather than deny that the many\nare dogs (Lewis 1993).  \n\nConstitution is identity, absolute identity. The relation\nbetween the piece of clay \\(c\\) and the statue \\(s_1\\) on day 1 is one\nof absolute identity. So we have that \\(c = s_1\\) on day 1, and for\nthe same reason, \\(c = s_2\\) on day 2. Furthermore, since \\(s_1\\) and\n\\(s_2\\) are different statues, it follows (on the weak view) that\n\\(s_1\\ne s_2\\). In addition, the piece of clay \\(c\\) constituting\n\\(s_1\\) on day 1 is (relatively) the same piece of clay as the piece\nof clay constituting \\(s_2\\) on day 2. (The identity is relative\nbecause we have distinct objects — the two statues — that\nare the same piece of clay.) It follows that no name of the piece\nof clay c can be a rigid designator in the standard sense. That\nis, no name of \\(c\\) denotes absolutely the same thing on day 1 and on\nday 2. For on day 1, a name of the piece of clay \\(c\\) would denote\n\\(s_1\\) and on day 2, it would denote \\(s_2\\), and \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\)\nare absolutely distinct. Nevertheless, a name of the piece of clay may\nbe\nrelatively rigid: it may denote at each time the\nsame piece of clay. Although no name of the piece of\nclay \\(c\\) is absolutely rigid, that does not prevent the\nintroduction of a name of \\(c\\) that denotes \\(c\\) at any\ntime (or possible world). (Kraut 1980 discusses a related notion of\nrelative rigidity.) \n\nThere is, however, a certain ambiguity in the notion of a name of\nthe piece of clay, inasmuch as the piece of clay may be any number of\nabsolutely distinct objects. The notion of relative rigidity\npresupposes that a name for the piece of clay refers, with respect to\nsome parameter \\(p\\), to whatever object counts as the piece of\nclay relative to that parameter. This may be sufficient in the case of\nthe piece of clay, but in other cases it is not. With respect to a\nfixed parameter \\(p\\) there may be no unique object to serve as\nthe referent of the name. For example, if any number of dog parts\ncount, at a fixed time, as the same dog, then which of these objects\nserves as the referent of ‘Oscar’? We shall leave this\nquestion open for the time being but suggest that it may be worthwhile\nto view names such as ‘Oscar’ as instantial terms\n— terms introduced into discourse by means of existential\ninstantiation. The name ‘Oscar’ might be taken as denoting\na representative member of the equivalence class of distinct objects\nqualifiying as the same dog as Oscar. It would follow, then, that most\nordinary names are instantial terms. (An alternative is that of Geach\n1980, who draws a distinction between a name of and a name\nfor an object; see Noonan 1997 for discussion of Geach’s\ndistinction.) \n\nIn this case, the relativist, as so far understood, may seem to enjoy\nno advantage over the absolutist. The problem is not clearly one of\nreconciling LL with ordinary judgments of identity, and the advantage\nafforded by RI does not seem applicable. Griffin (1977), for example,\nrelying on RI, claims that the original and remodeled ship are the\nsame ship but not the same collection of planks, whereas the\nreassembled ship is the same collection of planks as the original but\nnot the same ship. This simply doesn’t resolve the problem. The\nproblem is that the reassembled and remodeled ships have, prima\nfacie, equal claim to be the original and so the bald claims that\nthe reassembled ship is not—and the remodeled ship is—the\noriginal are unsupported. The problem is that of reconciling the\nintuition that certain small changes (replacement of a single part or\nsmall portion) preserve identity, with the problem illustrated by the\nsandals example of §2.5. It turns out, nevertheless, that the\nproblem \\(is\\) one of dealing with the excesses of LL. To resolve\nthe problem, we need an additional level of relativity. To motivate\nthis development, consider the following abstract counterpart of the\nsandals example: \n\nOn the left there is an object \\(P\\) composed of three parts,\n\\(P_1, P_2\\), and\n\\(P_3\\). On the right is an exactly similar but\nnon-identical object, \\(Q\\), composed of exactly similar parts,\n\\(Q_1, Q_2\\), and\n\\(Q_3\\), in exactly the same arrangement. For the sake\nof illustration, we adopt the rule that only replacement of (at most) a\nsingle part by an exactly similar part preserves identity.\nSuppose we now interchange the parts of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\). We begin by\nreplacing \\(P_1\\) by \\(Q_1\\) in \\(P\\) and replacing \\(Q_1\\) by \\(P_1\\)\nin \\(Q\\), to obtain objects \\(P^1\\) and \\(Q^1\\). So \\(P^1\\) is\ncomposed of parts \\(Q_1, P_2\\), and \\(P_3\\), and Q\\(^1\\) is composed\nof parts \\(P_1, Q_2\\), and \\(Q_3\\). We then replace \\(P_2\\) in \\(P^1\\)\nby \\(Q_2\\), to obtain \\(P^2\\), and so on. Given our sample criterion\nof identity, and assuming the transitivity of identity, \\(P\\) and\n\\(P^3\\) are counted the same, as are \\(Q\\) and \\(Q^3\\). But this\nappears to be entirely the wrong result. Intuitively, \\(P\\) and\n\\(Q^3\\) are the same, as are \\(Q\\) and \\(P^3\\). For \\(P\\) and \\(Q^3\\)\nare composed of exactly the same parts put together in exactly the\nsame way, and similarly for \\(Q\\) and \\(P^3\\). Futhermore, \\(Q_3\n(P_3)\\) can be viewed as simply the result of taking \\(P (Q)\\) apart\nand putting it back together in a slightly different location. And\nthis last difference can be eliminated by switching the locations of\n\\(P^3\\) and \\(Q^3\\) as a last step in the process. \n\nSuppose, however, that we replace our criterion of identity by the\nfollowing more complicated rule: \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same\nrelative to z, if both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) differ from \\(z\\) at\nmost by a single part. (This relation is transitive, and is in fact an\nequivalence relation.) For example, relative to \\(P\\), \\(P, P^1,\nQ^2\\), and \\(Q^3\\) are the same, but \\(Q, Q^1, P^2\\) and \\(P^3\\), are\nnot. Of course, replacement by a single part is an artificial\ncriterion of identity. In actual cases, it will be a matter of the\ndegree or kind of deviation from the original (represented by\nthe third parameter, \\(z)\\). The basic idea is that identity through\nchange is not a matter of identity through successive, accumulated\nchanges — that notion conflicts with both intuition (e.g., the\nsandals example) and the Kripkean argument: Through successive changes\nobjects can evolve into other objects. The three-place\nrelation of idenitity does not satisfy LL and is consistent with the\noutlook of the relativist. Gupta (1980) develops a somewhat similar\nidea in detail. Williamson (1990) suggests a rather different\napproach, but one that, like the above, treats identity through change\nas an equivalence relation that does not satisfy LL. \n\nChurch’s argument implies that if Pierre’s doxastic position is as\ndescribed (in §2.6), then London and Londres are distinct objects.\nAssuming the standard account of identity, the result is that either\nPierre’s doxastic position cannot be as described or else\nLondon and Londres are different cities (or else we must\npunt). Since London and Londres are not different cities, the standard\naccount entails that Pierre’s doxastic position cannot be as described\n(or else we must punt). This was Church’s own position as regards\ncertain puzzles about synonymy, such as Mates’ puzzle (Mates 1952).\nChurch held that one who believes that lawyers are lawyers, must indeed\nbelieve that lawyers are attorneys, despite any refusal to assent to\n(or desire to dissent from) ‘Lawyers are attorneys’\n(Church 1954). Kripke later argued (Kripke 1979) that assent and\nfailure to assent must be taken at face value (at least in the case of\nPierre) and Pierre’s doxastic position is as described. Kripke chose to\npunt — concluding that the problem is a problem for any “logic” of\nbelief. The relativist concludes instead that (a) Pierre’s doxastic\nposition is as described, (b) if so, London and Londres are distinct\nobjects, and (c) London and Londres are nonetheless the same city.\nWhether this resolution of Church’s paradox can be exploited to yield\nsolutions to Frege’s puzzle (Salmon 1986) or Kripke’s puzzle (1979)\nremains to be seen. Crimmins (1998) has suggested that the\nanalysis of propositional attitudes requires a notion of “semantic\npretense.” In reporting Pierre’s doxastic position we engage in a\npretense to the effect that London and Londres are different cities\nassociated with different Fregean senses. Crimmins’ goal is to\nreconcile (a), (c) and the following, (d): that the pure semantics of\nproper names (’London’, ‘Londres’) is Millian\nor directly referential (Kripke 1979). The relativist proposes just\nsuch a reconciliation but suggests that the pretense can be dropped.  \n\nThe solution provided by RI is straightforward: we need to state the\ndoctrine not in terms of absolute identity, but in terms of relative\nidentity. So instead of one predicate of absolute identity the\ntrinitarian creed may need two predicates of relative identity, e.g.,\nbeing the same person and being the same being (cf. van Inwagen 1988,\n2003), or, as suggested by (Anscombe and Geach 1961), being the same\nperson and being the same God. Then we may reformulate the creed as\nfollows: \nVan Inwagen produced a model (in the sense of formal semantics) where\nall these statements are satisfied, so under this interpretation the\ndoctrine of Trinity comes out consistent. Incidentally let me note\nthat he also gave an analogous interpretation for the doctrine of\nIncarnation – see (van Inwagen 1994). For an extended discussion of\nthe coherence of this solution\nsee the section on relative identity theories in the\n entry on trinity. \n\nThe philosopher P.T. Geach first broached the subject of relative\nidentity and introduced the phrase ‘relative identity’.\nOver the years, Geach suggested specific instances of RI (a variant of\nthe case of Oscar and his tail is due to Geach (Geach 1980)) and in\nthis way he contributed to the development of the weak view concerning\nrelative identity, i.e. the view that while ordinary identity\nrelations are often relative, some are not. But Geach maintains that\nabsolute identity does not exist. What is his argument?  \n\nThat is hard to say. Geach sets up two strawman candidates for\nabsolute identity, one at the beginning of his discussion and one at\nthe end, and he easily disposes of both. In between he develops an\ninteresting and influential argument to the effect that identity,\neven as formalized in the system FOL\\(^=\\), is relative\nidentity. However, Geach takes himself to have shown, by this argument,\nthat absolute identity does not exist. At the end of his initial\npresentation of the argument in his 1967 paper, Geach remarks: \n\nIt turns out, as we’ll see, that all that comes apart is the false\nnotion that in FOL\\(^=\\) the identity symbol defines the\nrelation \\(I(A,x,y)\\). Let us examine\nGeach’s line of reasoning in detail, focusing on the presentation in\nhis 1967 article, the locus classicus of the notion of\nrelative identity.  \n\nGeach begins by urging that a plain identity statement\n‘\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same’ is in need of a\ncompleting predicate: ‘\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same\n\\(F\\)’. Frege had argued that statements of number such as\n‘this is one’ require a completing predicate: ‘this\nis one \\(F\\)’, and so it is, Geach claims, with identity\nstatements. This is a natural view for one who subscribes to RI. The\nlatter cannot even be stated without the completing predicates.\nNevertheless, both the claim itself and the analogy with Frege have\nbeen questioned. Some argue that the analogy with Frege is\nincorrect. For example, Carrara and Sacchi (2007) maintain that\nFrege’s position that any ascription of a number to something is\nalways relative to a concept boils down to the claim that concepts are\nessential in cardinality statements because without them there is no\nspecification of what is to be counted. Once this is settled,\nFrege would count by means of absolute identity. Others argued that\nwhile the analogy is correct, both Frege and Geach are wrong (Perry\n1978 and Alston and Bennett 1984). These matters do not bear directly\non the question of the coherence and truth of RI or the question of\nabsolute identity. One who adopts the weak view would not want to\nfollow Geach on this score. And one could maintain the “completing\nthesis” without being committed to RI. Furthermore, the completing\nthesis occupies a puzzling role in Geach’s dialectic. Immediately\nfollowing his statement of the thesis, Geach formalizes\nFOL\\(^=\\) on the basis of the single formula: \n\n(The ‘W’ is for Hao Wang, who first suggested it. The\nreader is invited to prove Ref and LL from W.) But we hear no complaint\nabout the syntax of W despite its involving a seemingly unrelativized\nidentity symbol. It turns out, however, that Geach apparently thinks of\nthe completing predicate as being given by the whole descriptive\napparatus of \\(L\\) or a fragment thereof. \n\nGeach now observes \n Here an ‘I-predicable’ is a binary relation symbol\n‘=’ satisfying (W). Geach’s focus at this point is\non the need to relativize an \\(I\\)-predicable to a theory \\(T\\).\nGeach then immediately saddles the friend of absolute identity with\nthe view that for “real identity” we need not bring in the\nideology of a definite theory. This is Geach’s first\nstrawman. When logicians, in discussing FOL\\(^=\\), speak of\n“real identity” — and they often do (see Enderton\n2000 or Silver 1994, for example) — they do not mean a relation\nof universal identity, since the universal set does not\nexist. Nor do they intend, in formulating LL, to use ‘true\nof’ in a completely unrestrained way which gives rise to\nsemantic paradox. It is no argument against those who wish to\ndistinguish mere indiscernibility from real identity to say that they\n“will soon fall into contradictions,” e.g.,\nGrelling’s or Russell’s. The relation \\(I(A,x,y)\\) is\nsufficiently relativized. (It is relativized to a set A.) \n\nWe come next to the main point: \n\nThe warrant for this claim can only be the language relativity of\nidentity when treated as a non-logical notion (see §1). That this\nis what Geach has in mind is clear from some approving remarks he\nmakes in his 1973 article about Quine’s (1970) proposal to treat\nidentity as a non-logical notion. But how does it follow that absolute\nidentity does not exist? Geach seems to think that the defender of\nabsolute identity will look to Ref and LL (or W) — and not\nbeyond — for a full account of “strict, absolute, unqualified”\nidentity. That is not so. The fact that these formulas in themselves\ndefine only indiscernibility relations is a logical commonplace. So\nthis is Geach’s second strawman. \n\nIs Geach’s argument at least an argument that identity is relative?\nDoes language relativity support the conclusion that RI is true even of\nidentity as formalized in FOL\\(^=\\)? The general idea appears to\nbe that language relativity suggests that we take identity to\nbe indiscernibility, and conclude that objects identical relative\nto one ideology \\(F\\) may be different relative to another\nideology \\(G\\), and that this confirms RI. Notice first of all\nthat this argument relies on the identity of indiscernibles: that\nindiscernibility implies identity. This principle is not valid in\nFOL\\(^=\\) even when the latter is treated as a proper theory.\nLanguage relativity does not imply that the distinctness of distinct\nobjects cannot go unnoticed. \n\nSecondly, the interesting cases of RI do not involve a shift from an\nimpoverished point of view to an improved one — whether this is\nseen in epistemic terms (which Geach disputes — Geach, (1973))\nor in purely logical terms. We do not affirm that old Oscar and young\nOscar, for example, are the same dog on the grounds that there is an\nideology with respect to which old Oscar and young Oscar are\nindistinguishable. Such an ideology would be incapable of describing\nany change in Oscar. It is true that the same dog relation\ndetermines a set of predicates that do not discriminate between the\nmembers of certain pairs of dogs — the dogs in the photographs\nmentioned earlier, for example. And it is true that these\npredicates determine a sublanguage in which the same dog\nrelation is a congruence, i.e. no predicate of the sublanguage\ndistinguishes \\(x\\) from \\(y\\), if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\nare the same dog. But the very sense of such statements as\nthat old Oscar and young Oscar are the same dog requires a language in\nwhich a change in Oscar is expressible. We are talking, after all,\nabout old Oscar and young Oscar. If we take\nseriously the idea that change involves the application of\nincompatible predicates, then the sublanguage cannot express the\ncontrast between old Oscar and young Oscar. \n\nThird, the phenomenon of language relativity (in the technical sense\ndiscussed in §1) has led many philosophers, including Geach, to\nthe view that ideology creates ontology. There is no antecedently given\ndomain of objects, already individuated, and waiting to be described.\nInstead, theories carve up the world in various ways, rendering some\nthings noticeably distinct and others indiscernible, depending on a\ntheory’s descriptive resources. The very notion of object is\ntheory-bound (Kraut 1980). This sort of anti-realism may seem to go\nhand in hand with relative identity. Model theory, however, is realist\nto its core and language relativity is a model-theoretic phenomenon. It\nis a matter of definability (in a structure). Referring back to\n§1, in order to make sense of language relativity we have to start\nwith a pair of distinct objects, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\),\n(distinct from the standpoint of the metalanguage), and hence a pair of\nobjects we assume are already individuated. These objects, however, are\nindistinguishable in \\(M\\), since no formula of \\(L'\\)\ndefines a subset of \\(M\\) containing the one object and not the\nother. When we move to \\(M'\\), we find that there is a\nformula of the enriched language that defines such a subset in\n\\(M'\\). Thus, language relativity is not really any sort\nrelativity of identity at all. We must assume that the objects\n\\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are distinct in order to describe\nthe phenomenon. If we are living in \\(M\\), and suspect that\nMartians living in \\(M'\\) can distinguish \\(a\\) from\n\\(b\\), our suspicion is not merely to the effect that Martians\ncarve things up differently than we do. Our own model theory tells us\nthat there is more to it than that. Our suspicion must be to the effect\nthat \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are absolutely distinct. If we\nare blind to the difference between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the\nMartians are not, then there must be a difference; and even if we are\nliving in \\(M\\), we know there’s a difference, or at least we can\nsuspect there is, since model theory tells us that such suspicion is\nwell founded. \n\nLet us go back to Geach’s remark that we “need not”\ninterpret identity absolutely. While this is true, we need not\ninterpret it as indiscernibility either. There are always the quotient\nstructures (Quine 1963) . Instead of taking our “reality” to be\n\\(M\\), and our “identity” to be indiscernibility in \\(M\\), we\ncan move to the quotient structure, \\(QM\\), whose elements are the\nequivalence classes, \\([x]\\), for \\(x\\) in \\(M\\). If\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are indiscernible in \\(M\\), then in\n\\(QM\\), \\([x]\\) and [\\(y\\)] are absolutely identical. We\ncan do this even if we wish to treat FOL\\(^=\\) as a proper\ntheory. For example, suppose \\(L'\\) is a language in which\npeople having the same income are indiscernible. The domain of\n\\(M\\) now consists of people. \\(QM\\), however, consists of\nincome groups, equivalence classes of people having the same income,\nand identity in \\(QM\\) is absolute. Geach objects to such\nreinterpretation in terms of the quotient structures on the grounds\nthat it increases the ontological commitments not only of\n\\(L'\\) but of any language of which \\(L'\\) is a\nsublanguage. \n\nLet’s focus on \\(L'\\) first. From a purely model-theoretic\npoint of view the question is moot. We cannot deny that \\(QM\\) is\na structure for \\(L'\\). Thus, \\(L'\\) is\ncommitted to people vis à vis one structure and to\nincome groups vis à vis the corresponding quotient\nstructure. But let’s pretend that the structures are “representations\nof reality,” and so the question now becomes: Which representation is\npreferable? Is there then any reason to prefer the ontology of\n\\(M\\) to that of \\(QM\\)? \\(M\\) contains people but no\nsets of people, whereas \\(QM\\) contains sets of people but no\npeople. By Quine’s criterion of ontological commitment — that to\nbe is to be the value of a variable — commitment to a set of\nobjects does not carry a commitment to its elements. That is one of\nthe odd consequences of Quine’s criterion. Unless there is some\nontological reason to prefer people to sets of people (perhaps because\nsets are never to be preferred), the ontologies of \\(M\\) and\n\\(QM\\) seem pretty much on a par. Both commit \\(L'\\)\nto one kind of thing. \n\nGeach makes the additional claim that the ontological commitments of a\nsublanguage \\(L'\\) of a language \\(L\\) are inherited by \\(L\\) (Geach\n1973). Suppose then that \\(L\\) is a language containing expressions\nfor several equivalence relations defined on people: say, same\nincome, same surname, and same job. Geach\nargues that \\(L\\) need only be committed to the existence of\npeople. Things such as income groups, job groups (equivalence classes\nof people with the same job), and surmen can all be counted using the\nequivalencies, without bringing surmen, job groups, and income groups\ninto the picture. Consider any sublanguage for which any one of these\nequivalence relations is a congruence, i.e. for which LL\\('\\)\nholds. Pick the language, \\(L_1\\), for example, in which people having\nthe same job are indiscernible. More precisely, we assume that \\(T_1\\)\nis the pure theory with identity whose ideology is confined to the\nlanguage \\(L_1\\). Let \\(M_1\\) be a model of \\(T_1\\). We may imagine\nthe domain of \\(M_1\\) to consist of people, and we can interpret\nindiscernibility in \\(M_1\\) to be the relation x and y have the\nsame job. Geach would argue that if \\(L_1\\) is committed to the\nelements of \\(QM_1\\) — the job groups — then so is\n\\(L\\). But that is not true. If \\(T\\) is a theory of the three\ndistinct equivalence relations formulated in \\(L\\), the most \\(T\\) (or\n\\(L)\\) would be committed to are the partitions determined by the\nequivalence relations; and in any case, it would be perfectly\nconsistent to insist that, whatever the ontological commitments of\n\\(L_1\\), reality, as described by \\(L\\), consists of people. \n\nThe foregoing considerations are rather abstract. To see more clearly\nwhat is at stake, let us focus on a specific example. Geach (1967)\nmentions that rational numbers are defined set-theoretically to be\nequivalence classes of integers determined by a certain equivalence\nrelation defined on “fractions,” i.e. ordered pairs of\nintegers (1/2 is \\(\\langle 1,2\\rangle\\), 2/4 is \\(\\langle\n2,4\\rangle\\), etc.). He suggests that we can instead construe our\ntheory of rational numbers to be about the fractions themselves,\ntaking the \\(I\\)-predicable of our theory to be the following\nequivalence relation, \\(E\\): \n\nThis approach, Geach says, would have “the advantage of lightening a\ntheory’s set-theoretical burdens. (In our present example, we need not\nbring in infinite sets of ordered pairs of integers into the\ntheory of rationals.).” \n\nThe first thing to notice about this example is that E cannot\nbe the I-predicable of such a theory, since \\(E\\) is\ndefined in terms of identity (look at the right side of\nR). It is ‘=’ that must serve as the\n\\(I\\)-predicable, and it renders distinct ordered pairs of\nintegers discernible. The moral is that not all equivalence relations\ncan be drafted to do the job of identity, even given a limited\nideology. There is, indeed, a plausible argument that any\nequivalence relation presupposes identity — not necessarily in\nthe direct way illustrated by (R), but indirectly, nonetheless (see\n§6). Moreover, from the standpoint of general mathematics, once\nwe have (R), we have the (infinite) equivalence classes it determines\nand the partition it induces. These are inescapable. Even from a more\nlimited viewpoint, it seems that once we have enough set theory to\ngive us ordered pairs of integers and the ability to define (R), we\nget the partition it induces as well. \n\nGeach perceives an ontological advantage in relative identity; but\nhis argument is unconvincing. Shifting to the quotient structures, as\nQuine suggested, does not induce a “baroque, Meinongian ontology”\n(Geach 1967). In particular, the “home language” \\((L)\\) does not\ninherit the commitment of the fragment \\((L_1)\\), and\nthe ontology of an arbitrary model of the pure theory of identity based\non the latter language is at least no more various than that of the\ncorresponding quotient model. There are, however, a number of ways in\nwhich relative identity does succeed in avoiding commitment to certain\nentities required by its absolute rival. These are discussed in the\nreplies to objections 4 and 5 in the next section. \n\nThe following constitute a “start up” set of objections and replies\nconcerning relative identity and/or aspects of the foregoing account of\nrelative identity and its rival. Time and space constraints prevent a\nmore extended initial discussion. In addition, there is no presumption\nthat the objections discussed below are the most important or that the\ninitial replies to them are without fault. It is hoped that the present\ndiscussion will evolve into a more full blown one, involving\ncontributions by the author and readers alike. Should the discussion\nbecome lengthy, old or unchallenged objections and/or replies can be\nplaced in the archives.  \n\nObjection 1: “Relativist theories of identity, all\nof which are inconsistent with Leibniz’s principle [LL], currently\nenjoy little support. The doubts about them are (a) whether they really\nare theories of numerical identity, (b) whether they can be made\ninternally consistent, and (c) whether they are sufficiently\nmotivated.” (Burke 1994.) \n\nReply: In reverse order: (c) The issues discussed\nin §2 and §4 surely provide sufficient motivation. (b) No\nproof of inconsistency has ever been forthcoming from opponents of\nrelative identity, and in fact the weak view is consistent inasmuch as\nit has a model in the theory of similarity relations. The arguments\noutlined in the second paragraph of §3 are frequently cited as\nshowing that relative identity is incoherent; but they show only that\nRI is incompatible with (unrestricted) LL. (a) See the replies to\nobjections 2 and 3 below. \n\nObjection 2: If an identity relation obeys only a\nrestricted form of LL — if it preserves only some\nproperties and not all — then how do we tell\nwhich properties serve to individuate a pair of distinct objects? \n\nReply: Similarity relations satisfy only restricted\nforms of LL. How then do we tell which properties are\npreserved by the same shape relation and which are not? It is\nno objection to the thesis that identity relations in general preserve\nsome properties and not others to demand to know which are which. At\nbest the objection points to a problem we must face anyway (for the\ncase of similarity). In general, a property is preserved by an\nequivalence relation if it “spreads” in an equivalence class determined\nby the relation: If one member of the class has the property, then\nevery member does. Every property spreads in a singleton, as absolute\nidentity demands. \n\nObjection 3: If identity statements are mere\nequivalencies, what distinguishes identity from mere similarity? \n\nReply: The distinction between identity and\nsimilarity statements (or sentences) is usually drawn in\nterms of the distinction between substantival and adjectival common\nnouns. If \\(F\\) is a common noun standing for a kind of\nthings e.g., ‘horse’, then ‘\\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\)’ is a statement of identity,\nwhereas if \\(F\\) is an a common noun standing for a kind of\nproperties of things, then ‘\\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\nare the same \\(F\\)’ is a statement of similarity. (It’s\ninteresting to note that when the noun is proper, i.e. a proper name,\nthe result is a statement of similarity, not identity — as in\n‘He’s not the same Bill we knew before’.) This distinction\nrests ultimately on the metaphysical distinction between substance and\nattribute, object and property. While the distinction no doubt\npresupposes the concept of individuation (the bundle theory, for\nexample, presupposes that we have the means to individuate\nproperties), there is no obvious reason to suppose that it entails the\ndenial of RI, i.e. the claim that no instance of RI is true. For a\nbeginner’s review — from an historical perspective — of\nthe issues concerning substance and attribute, see O’Connor, (1967);\nand for more recent and advanced discussion and bibliography, see the\nentry on\n properties. \n\nObjection 4: Consider the following alleged\ninstance of RI: \n\n“If ‘\\(A\\)’ and ‘\\(B\\)’ refer to\nthe same objects throughout (1), the first conjunct of (1) is not an\nidentity statement, and the counterexample (to the thesis that no\ninstance of RI is true) fails. If both conjuncts are identity\nstatements in the required sense, ‘\\(A\\)’ and\n‘\\(B\\)’ must refer to word types in the first conjunct\nand word tokens in the second, and the counterexample fails” (Perry\n1970). \n\nReply: First, if “in the required sense” means\n“satisfies LL,” then the objection buys correctness only at the price\nof begging the question. Advocates of relative identity will maintain\nthat the relation A is the same word type as \\(B\\) is an\nidentity relation, defined on tokens, that does not satisfy LL. \n\nSecondly, even if one insists that in this case intuition dictates\nthat if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) refer to tokens in both conjuncts of\n(1), then ‘\\(A\\) is the same word type as \\(B\\)’\nexpresses only the similarity relation: A and B are tokens of the\nsame type, there are other cases where, intuitively, both\nconjuncts of RI involve identity relations and yet the relevant terms\nall refer to the same kind of things; for example, \n\nas said of young Oscar and old Oscar. Here there is no temptation to\nsuppose that the relation A and B are the same dog is\nnot an identity relation. One may invoke a theory — a theory\nof temporal parts, for example — that construes the relation as a\ncertain kind of similarity, but that is theory, not pretheoretical\nintuition. It is no objection to the relativist’s theory,\nwhich holds in part that ‘\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the same\ndog’ expresses a relation of primitive identity, that there is an\nalternative theory according to which it expresses a similarity\nrelation obtaining between two temporal parts of the same object.\nFurthermore, in the case of (2), \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) refer, again\nintuitively, to the same things in both conjuncts. \n\nThird, there are cases in which the relative identity view does\npossess an ontological advantage. Consider \n\nSuppose \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are understood to refer to one sort\nof thing — pieces of clay — in the first conjunct and\nanother — statues — in the second conjunct. Assume that\nthe piece of clay \\(c\\) denoted by \\(A\\) in the first\nconjunct constitutes, at time \\(t\\), the statue \\(s.\\) Then\nassuming that statues are physical objects, there are two distinct\nphysical objects belonging to different kinds occupying the same space\nat \\(t\\). Some, notably Wiggins (1980), hold that this is\nentirely possible: Distinct physical objects may occupy the same space\nat the same time, provided they belong to different kinds. The\ntemporal parts doctrine supports and encourages this view. A statue\nmay be a temporal part of a temporally extended piece of clay. But one\nstatue, it seems, cannot be a temporal part of another. Even so,\nhowever, the duality of constituter and thing constituted is\nunparsimonious (cf. Lewis 1993), and the relativist is not committed\nto it. \n\nAgain, consider \n\nOne can say that in the first conjunct, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nrefer to books (absolutely the same book), whereas in the second\nconjunct, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) refer to (absolutely distinct)\ncopies. But the alleged duality of books and copies of books is\nunparsimonious and the relativist is not committed to it. There is no\nreason to concede to the philosopher that we do not actually purchase\nor read books; instead we purchase and read only\ncopies of books. Any copy of a book is just as much the “book\nitself” as is any other copy. Any copy of a book is the same\nbook as any other copy. Nelson Goodman once remarked that “Any\naccurate copy of a poem is as much the original work as any other”\n(Goodman 1968). Goodman was not suggesting that the distinction\nbetween poem and copy collapses. If it does collapse, however, we have\nan explanation of why any accurate copy is as much the original work as\nany other: any such copy is the same work as any other. \n\nObjection 5: Geach remarks that “As for our\nrecognizing relative identity predicables: any equivalence\nrelation…can be used to specify a criterion of relative identity.”\nBut §3 above contains a counterexample. Some equivalence relations\nare defined in terms of the I-predicable of a theory and hence cannot\nserve as such. (Any pair of I-predicables for a fixed theory are\nequivalent.) In fact it seems that any equivalence relation presupposes\nidentity (cf. McGinn 2000). For example, the relation x and\ny are the same color presupposes identity of colors, since it\nmeans that there are colors \\(C\\) and \\(C'\\) such that\n\\(x\\) has \\(C\\) and \\(y\\) has \\(C'\\), and\n\\(C = C'\\). Identity, therefore, is logically prior\nto equivalence. \n\nReply: This is a good objection. It does seem to\nshow, as the objector says, that identity is logically prior to\nordinary similarity relations. However, the difference between\nfirst-order and higher-order relations is relevant here. Traditionally,\nsimilarity relations such as x and y are the same color have\nbeen represented, in the way indicated in the objection, as\nhigher-order relations involving identities between higher order\nobjects (properties). Yet this treatment may not be inevitable. In\nDeutsch (1997), an attempt is made to treat similarity relations of the\nform ‘\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\)’\n(where \\(F\\) is adjectival) as primitive, first-order, purely\nlogical relations (see also Williamson 1988). If successful, a\nfirst-order treatment of similarity would show that the impression that\nidentity is prior to equivalence is merely a misimpression — due to\nthe assumption that the usual higher-order account of similarity\nrelations is the only option. \n\nObjection 6: If on day 3, \\(c' = s_2\\), as the text asserts, then by NI, the same is\ntrue on day 2. But the text also asserts that on day 2, \\(c = s_2\\); yet \\(c \\ne c'\\). This is\nincoherent. \n\nReply: The term \\(s_2\\) is not an\nabsolutely rigid designator and so NI does not apply. \n\nObjection 7: The notion of relative identity is\nincoherent: “If a cat and one of its proper parts are one and the same\ncat, what is the mass of that one cat?” (Burke 1994) \n\nReply: Young Oscar and Old Oscar are the same dog,\nbut it makes no sense to ask: “What is the mass of that one dog.” Given\nthe possibility of change, identical objects may differ in mass. On the\nrelative identity account, that means that distinct logical objects\nthat are the same \\(F\\) may differ in mass — and may differ with\nrespect to a host of other properties as well. Oscar and Oscar-minus\nare distinct physical objects, and therefore distinct logical objects.\nDistinct physical objects may differ in mass. \n\nObjection 8: We can solve the paradox of 101\nDalmatians by appeal to a notion of “almost identity” (Lewis 1993). We\ncan admit, in light of the “problem of the many” (Unger 1980), that\nthe 101 dog parts are dogs, but we can also affirm that the 101 dogs\nare not many; for they are “almost one.” Almost-identity is not a\nrelation of indiscernibility, since it is not transitive, and so it\ndiffers from relative identity. It is a matter of negligible\ndifference. A series of negligible differences can add up to one that\nis not negligible. \n\nReply: The difference between Oscar and Oscar-minus\nis not negligible and the two are not almost-identical. Lewis concedes\nthis point but proposes to combine almost-identity with supervaluations\nto give a mixed solution to the paradox. The supervaluation solution\nstarts from the assumption that one and only one of the dog parts is a\ndog (and a Dalmatian, and Oscar), but it doesn’t matter which. It\ndoesn’t matter which because we haven’t decided as much, and we aren’t\ngoing to. Since it is true that any such decision renders one and only\none dog part a dog, it is plain-true, i.e. supertrue, that there is one\nand only one dog in the picture. But it is not clear that this approach\nenjoys any advantage over that of relative identity; in fact, it seems\nto produce instances of RI. Compare: Fred’s bicycle has a basket\nattached to it. Ordinarily, our discourse slides over the difference\nbetween Fred’s bicycle with its basket attached and Fred’s bicycle\nminus the basket. (In this respect, the case of Fred’s bicycle differs\nsomewhat from that of Oscar and Oscar-minus. We tend not to ignore\nthat difference.) In particular, we don’t say that Fred has\ntwo bicycles even if we allow that Fred’s bicycle-minus is a bicycle.\nBoth relative identity and supervaluations validate this intuition.\nHowever, both relative identity and supervaluations also affirm that\nFred’s bicycle and Fred’s bicycle-minus are absolutely distinct\nobjects. That is, the statement that Fred’s bicycle and Fred’s\nbicycle-minus are distinct is supertrue. So the supervaluation\ntechnique affirms both that Fred’s bicycle and Fred’s bicycle-minus are\ndistinct objects and that there is one and only one (relevant)\nbicycle. That is RI, or close enough. The supervaluation approach is\nnot so much an alternative to relative identity as a form of it. \n\nObjection 9: \nOne may argue that the plausibility of RI rests to a large degree on\ncertain linguistic phenomena and that we do not need it after all\nbecause these phenomena are in fact apparent and the notion of\nrelative identity can be explained away. For example, (Moltmann 2013)\nhas recently argued that some apparent statements of sortal-relative\nidentity can be analysed on the linguistic grounds as statements of\nabsolute identity. Consider an example of such statements: “This is\nthe same lump of clay but not the same statue as that”, which is\nuttered in front of, say, two photographs: one presenting the clay and\nthe other showing the statue made out of the clay. Moltmann starts her\nanalysis focussing on the two pronouns at stake: this\nand that, the so-called bare demonstratives. The analysis\nreveals two different functions thereof: referential and\npresentational. Due to the referential function a bare demonstrative\npicks up a unique feature, or a trope as Moltmann claims. Secondly,\nthis feature (trope) is used to recognise its bearer (in any possible\nworld that is accessible from the world where the pronoun is\nuttered). Now in the example above this refers to a complex\ntrope, say the complex composed of this particular brownness and this\nroundness, and “with the help of” this trope maps to a lump of clay as\na bearer of this trope. Similarly, that refers to another\ncomplex trope, say this particular brownness and this angularity and\nmaps to a bearer of this trope. The crucial assumption here is that the\ntropes in question may have multiple bearers, e.g., the brownness and\nroundness is a trope borne both by the clay and the statue. Moltmann’s\nsemantics of the (apparent) statements of sortal-relative identity of\nthe form “This is the same … as that” has it that such statements\nare true if this refers to a trope such that at least one,\nbut not all, of its bearers is identical (in the sense of absolute\nidentity) to a bearer of the trope to which that refers. So\nour sentence “This is the same lump of clay but not the same statue as\nthat” is true when (i) one bearer of the this trope is the\nsame as a bearer of the that trope and (ii) another bearer of\nthat first trope is not the same as a bearer of the other trope.","contact.mail":"garbacz@kul.lublin.pl","contact.domain":"kul.lublin.pl"}]
