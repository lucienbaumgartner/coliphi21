But while he\nis in important respects a devotee of that new science, there are also\nsignificant tensions in his thought.  He stands behind its\nexperimental methods as he targets the earlier, speculative or\nrationalist philosophies, for methodologies and epistemological\nexpectations unsuited to natural philosophy.  He also frequently\nappears to embrace the new science’s corpuscular hypothesis, whose\npowers and minute particles figure prominently in his attempt to\nunderstand why we cannot hope for demonstrative certainty about\nnatural phenomena.  Yet the new science’s methodology was evolving.\nJust how far did Locke travel with that evolution, and what aspects of\nhis thought prevented him from going further?  As for the corpuscular\nhypothesis, what exactly was his stance toward it?  He frequently\nspeaks of particles and powers as if they belonged to established\nknowledge, and yet in explaining the hypothesis’ flaws, he seems to\nconsider them fatal.  This article will mainly emphasize the second of\nthose related questions, though both have spurred scholarly\ninvestigation and debate.\n\n\n\nTwo features of Locke’s intellectual landscape are most salient\nfor understanding his philosophy of science, one concerning the new\nscience’s methodology, and the other concerning its\ncontent. First, then, is the new methodological approach to\nunderstanding the natural world, accompanied by profound shifts in\nconceptions of induction and scientific knowledge, and in disciplinary\nboundaries. Locke’s reaction is for the most part progressive.\nImpressed by experimental methods and cognizant of their poor fit with\nthe Aristotelian ideal, he defines a distinct kind of knowledge, one\ninferior to genuine scientific knowledge but appropriate to human\nsensory capacities.  In so doing, he develops an epistemological basis\nfor the new, experimental philosophy. Yet his reaction also has its\nconservative aspect, one that some see as having limited him in the\nface of the new science’s evolving methodology. He retains as an\nideal the notion that scientific knowledge is demonstrative and\ncertain, an ideal he shares with the two main targets of\nhis Essay, the speculative systems of the Aristotelians and\nthe Cartesians.  \n\nThe second salient feature is the dominant scientific theory of his\nday, the new science’s corpuscular hypothesis. As defined for the purposes of this\narticle, the corpuscular hypothesis (i) takes observable bodies to be\ncomposed of material particles or corpuscles, (ii) takes impulse\n(action by surface impact) to be the primary if not the sole means of\ncommunicating motion, and (iii) attempts to reduce qualities at the\nlevel of observable bodies, such as color, to the primary, that is,\ninherent properties of the particles composing those observable\nbodies. In what may be called its orthodox version (“pure\nmechanism”, as Ayers (1981, p. 212) calls it) the corpuscular\nhypothesis restricts those inherent properties to size, shape, number,\nand motion, and holds that all other qualities and operations are\nexplicable in terms of that restricted set of properties.  The orthodox version thus \nimplies a proviso of contact action—that bodies\ncausally interact only locally, by impact, such that unmediated action at a\ndistance is denied. (Although a number of commentators use the terms\n‘corpuscular hypothesis’ and ‘mechanism’\ninterchangeably, distinguishing them has certain benefits. For\ninstance, it permits us to classify Newton as a corpuscularian\ntheorist of some stripe, and to do so without engaging the debate\nabout whether he adhered to the contact action proviso. The\ndefinitions given here also agree largely with those in\nthe entry on \n John Locke.) Plenist and atomist\nversions of the corpuscular hypothesis may be distinguished. Plenist\ntheorists deny the void and assert a plenum of matter, as Descartes\ndoes by identifying matter with extension. Such theorists may speak of\nparticles, but their particles are not atoms, being infinitely or at\nleast indefinitely divisible. Atomist theorists, by contrast, accept\nthe void and take the particles or corpuscles comprising compound\nbodies to be indivisible, or at least probably so. Since Locke’s\nsympathies are clearly with the atomist version, the term\n‘corpuscular hypothesis’ shall refer to that version\nthroughout this article, unless indication is given otherwise. Central\ntheses of the Essay are developed in close conjunction with\nthe corpuscular hypothesis—most notably, the distinction between\nreal and nominal essences, which is developed in connection with the\ndistinction between primary and secondary qualities associated with\ncorpuscular theorists, including Locke’s mentor, Robert Boyle. Yet\nsince Locke often treats the hypothesis with skepticism, its status\nand purpose are a source of controversy. \n\nThis article examines questions connected with the two salient\nfeatures noted, and in connection with the first, it also examines\nLocke’s relationship to Newton, a figure instrumental to the changing\nconceptions of scientific knowledge. Section 2 addresses questions\nconnected to those changing conceptions. What does Locke take science\n(scientia) or scientific knowledge to be generally, why does\nhe think that\nscientia in natural philosophy is beyond the reach of human\nbeings, and what characterizes the conception of human knowledge in\nnatural philosophy that he develops? Section 3 addresses the\nquestion provoked by Locke’s apparently conflicting treatments of\nthe corpuscular hypothesis. Does he accept or defend the\ncorpuscular hypothesis? If not, what is its role in his thought,\nand what explains its close connection to key theses of the\nEssay? Since a scholarly debate has arisen about the\nstatus of the corpuscular hypothesis for Locke, Section 3 reviews some\nmain positions in that debate. Section 4 considers the\nrelationship between Locke’s thought and Newton’s.\nAll citations of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding are\nindicated by ‘E’, followed by the book and section\nnumbers. Page numbers referring to the Nidditch edition are also\nprovided. \n\nLocke’s great epistemological contribution to philosophy is a\nconception of human knowledge suitable for the experimental science of\nhis day, one that in natural philosophy at least will replace the old,\nAristotelian conception. According to the Aristotelian conception,\nscientific knowledge—scientia—is certain\nknowledge of necessary truths, which can in principle be expressed in\nsyllogistic form, the conclusion following from self-evident\npremises. In the domain of natural philosophy, it is certain knowledge\nof real essences. Although Locke does not seriously entertain a\nradical skepticism—finding “a very manifest difference\nbetween dreaming of being in the Fire, and being actually in it”\n(E IV.ii.14, pp.537–538)—he recognizes that the demands\nof scientia are too stringent for the new, experimental\nscience.  Nevertheless, the concept of scientia plays an\nimportant role as he develops his conception of the probabilistic sort\nof knowledge that is possible for humans in the domain of natural\nphilosophy: he uses it as a foil when explaining why humans must\nsettle for probabilistic knowledge there, scientia remaining\nalways out of reach. Scientia can serve as that foil because\nit is attainable for human beings in certain domains; however Locke\nthinks that for nobler spirits, such as angels, it is also attainable\nwithin natural philosophy. \nThis section begins by reviewing the history of the concept\nof scientia and the factors that, by undermining it, provide\nthe impetus for Locke’s conception of human knowledge in natural\nphilosophy. This section also explains what Locke\nthinks scientia in natural philosophy would amount to, the\nobstacles that prevent human beings from achieving it, and the lesser\nhuman knowledge that must serve us in its place. \n\nThe conception of genuine scientific knowledge that Locke inherits\nand in some manner retains, scientia, has its roots in\nAristotle, as set out at the beginning of Book I, §2 of the\nPosterior Analytics. For Aristotle, only necessary\ntruths are the objects of scientific knowledge, and since scientific\nknowledge requires knowledge of causes, it also requires knowing that\nthe fact is necessary by knowing its necessary relations to its\ncauses. Among Aristotle’s manifold causes, the main one in\nquestion here is the formal cause—the nature or essence—as\nAristotle indicates\n elsewhere.[2] \n\nThe knower’s epistemic stance toward the necessary truth and\nits relation to causes is one of certainty, and the certain fact is\ndemonstrable via a syllogism, specifically, one in which the premises\nare self-evident, requiring no demonstration themselves. \n\nThe stipulation that the premises of a scientific demonstration must\nbe indemonstrable, that is, self-evident, leads to a prima\nfacie difficulty. This conception of scientific knowledge is\nintended to encompass not only conceptual propositions, but also\npropositions about the real natures or essences of substances, which is\nto say propositions about the world. As with any other\ndemonstration, a demonstration in natural philosophy must have premises\nthat are self-evident, since otherwise a regress would ensue.\nYet it is not clear, at least from a contemporary perspective, how the\npremises can be self-evident, since they must be\nexperience-based. \n\nNow, it would be overstating matters to say that this problem\nappears only from a contemporary perspective; there was some\nrecognition of it in the ancient and medieval\n periods.[3]\nStill, before the advent of\nthe experimental science, the problem was not strongly felt because\nexperience was understood in a different way. For one thing, the notion\nof an experiment—an artificially constructed, single event or\nseries of events designed to test for a predicted outcome—did not\nexist. Moreover, among the scholastic Aristotelians, a single,\nnaturally occurring event could not by itself be regarded as revealing\nof natural processes, because it might be a\n“monster”—it might be an event that went against\nnature rather than being produced by and thus revealing of\n nature.[4]\nEvents\nas generally experienced, however, were regarded as being revealing of\nnature, and so they could provide the universal truths needed as\npremises in the\n syllogism.[5]\nHow was the gap between events as usually\nexperienced—which still amounts to a limited sample of\nevidence—and the universal claim derived from them bridged?\nIt is only from the modern and contemporary perspectives that such a\ngap exists to be bridged. For Aristotle and the medievals, human\nfaculties are so constituted as to be able to apprehend nature, that\nis, to discern the essences of\n substances.[6]\nIn short, then, because the\ninternal essences that form the content of natural philosophy are real,\nand because our faculties are so constituted as to apprehend those real\nessences, natural philosophy can be a science, a domain in which\ncertain, demonstrative knowledge can be had, despite its dependence\nupon experience. \n\nThe exemplars of scientific knowledge, to be sure, are conceptual\ndisciplines, not only geometry, but also rational theology, the latter\nbeing the quintessential science for the\n medievals.[7]\nYet for the most part,\nnatural philosophy stands side by side with conceptual disciplines,\neven into the modern period. Bacon, though associated with\ninduction, accepts the demonstrative conception of scientific\nknowledge, and so does Galileo, who uses experiments to reveal fundamental\nprinciples (though also using them in other\n ways).[8]\nAs empirical methods are refined and more\nwidely applied, the belief that natural philosophy can stand under the\numbrella of scientia comes under increasing\n pressure.[9]\nSome thinkers\nresist the pressure, most notably Descartes, who derives his laws of\nnature by an a priori reflection upon God’s nature, and, placing\nconfidence in these rationalist methods, denies that his third law of\nnature is undermined by conflicting observations of colliding\n bodies.[10]\nYet for the experimentalists themselves, including Locke’s\nmentor, Boyle, observations and experiments are the primary vehicle to\nknowledge.  (It should be noted, however, that most advocates of\nexperimentalism did not consider speculation wholly illegitimate,\ninstead insisting that it be delayed until considerable experimental\nand observational evidence had been amassed; see Anstey (2011,\npp. 4,5).) It is this approach that puts natural philosophy on the\npath to Hume’s problem of induction, and that most influences\nLocke.[11] \n\nAs indicated earlier, scientia serves as the backdrop\nagainst which Locke develops the conception of the knowledge that is\npossible in natural philosophy for human beings. Having retained\nthe ideal of scientia, as exemplified by geometry, yet having\nalso absorbed the import of Boyle’s experimental method, Locke is\ndriven to his characteristic pessimism about the kind and extent of\nknowledge possible for us in natural philosophy. “The meanest,\nand most obvious Things that come in our way, have dark sides, that the\nquickest Sight cannot penetrate into” (E IV.iii.22, p.\n553). Due to the weakness of our faculties, Locke suspects,\n“natural Philosophy is not capable of being made a\nScience.” (E IV.xii.10, p. 645). This section considers\nLocke’s general notion of scientia, what would be\nrequired for scientia in natural philosophy, and the obstacles\nthat prevent human beings from attaining scientia in natural\nphilosophy. \n\nLocke takes knowledge generally to consist in “the perception\nof the connexion and agreement, or disagreement and repugnancy of any\nof our Ideas” (E IV.i.1–2, p. 525), and among the three kinds of\nknowledge that he distinguishes, intuitive, demonstrative, and\nsensitive, the former two are kinds of certain knowledge.\nIntuitive and demonstrative knowledge differ in the number of\nintuitions involved, and consequently, differ in their degree of\ncertainty (E IV.ii.14, pp.537–538). Intuitive knowledge is the\nmost certain because the truth is grasped immediately. There are no\nintermediate steps, and doubt is impossible because the mind can no\nmore avoid recognizing the truth than the open, functioning eye could\navoid seeing light when turned toward the sun (E See IV.ii.1, p. 531).\nDemonstrative knowledge, though also qualifying as certain, is less so\nbecause it involves intermediate steps. We cannot grasp\nimmediately that the three angles of any triangle are equal to two\nright triangles, and must instead construct the steps of a proof.\nUpon doing so, and upon grasping the connections between the steps of\nthe proof, we have demonstrative knowledge (E IV.ii.2–3,\np.531–532). Intuitive and demonstrative knowledge are forms of\nscientia, then. Locke defines that as “certain\nuniversal Knowledge”(E IV.iii.29, p. 559), and mere\n“particular matters of fact” (E IV.iii.25, pp. 555–56) do\nnot qualify. \n\nTo understand Locke’s notion of scientia, we must\nconsider its objects: real essences and the necessary connections that\nflow from them. Denying the Aristotelian view that a single\nessence both grounds the properties of a thing, making it what it is,\nand provides the basis for classifying it, Locke draws a distinction\nbetween real and nominal\n essences.[12]\nWhereas the nominal essence consists in\nthe set of observable qualities we use to classify a thing (which\nimplies that the nominal essence could vary across time or\ncommunities), the real essence (or real or internal constitution,\nas Locke sometimes writes) is that which makes a thing what it is. \n\nDiscussion of real essence often focuses upon the real essences of\nmaterial substances, and in that case we say that the real essence is\nthe causal ground of the substance’s perceivable\nproperties. As will be discussed in a subsequent section, many\ncommentators interpret Locke as identifying a material\nsubstance’s real essence with some subset of its constituent\ncorpuscles’ primary qualities, an identification presuming that\nLocke accepts the corpuscular hypothesis (e.g., Osler 1970, p. 12;\nMandelbaum 1964, p.1). According to another interpretation, the\nreal-nominal essence distinction is metaphysical, and thus more\nfundamental than the primary-secondary quality distinction, which is a\nphysical distinction, belonging as it does to a particular physical\ntheory, the corpuscular hypothesis. Yet leaving that debate aside\nfor the moment, we may note from the first sentence of the above-quoted\npassage that Locke does not restrict the notion of real essence to\nsubstances. This means that we can speak of, say, the real essence of a\ntriangle, understanding it as that which grounds the triangle’s\nqualities, making it what it is. \n\nWe have scientific knowledge of something when we know its real\nessence and, since its qualities flow from that real essence, when we\nknow the necessary connections between the essence and its other\nqualities. Geometry serves as an exemplar, as it did for so many\nof Locke’s predecessors. In knowing what a triangle is, we\ncannot conceive things being otherwise than that the sum of its three\nangles equal the sum of two right angles. \n\nScientia is possible in another conceptual domain also:\nmorality. Morality is characterized by discernible necessary\nconnections, and Locke is adamant that we can have the same level of\ncertainty there as in geometry. \n\nWhat would be required for scientia in natural\nphilosophy? Since scientia generally concerns real\nessences, and since natural philosophy for Locke concerns material\nsubstances and their powers, scientia in natural philosophy\nwould be knowledge of material substances’ real essences and\ntheir necessary connections to qualities flowing from them. \n\nIf we could have scientia in natural philosophy, we could\nknow a substance’s qualities without making observations or\nexperiments. To take one of Locke’s frequent examples, if\nwe could know gold’s real essence, we would then know its\nqualities, even if not a single sample of gold existed. \n\nWhich qualities exactly would we be able to deduce? We would\nbe able to deduce a substance’s tertiary qualities, that is, its\npowers to produce certain effects in other\n substances.[13]\nIf we knew the real\nessences of opium, and of hemlock, then just as though we were\nperforming a geometric deduction, or just as a locksmith understands\nwhy a given key will open one lock but not another, we could deduce\nthat opium produces sleep, that hemlock causes death, and we would\nunderstand why each substance produces its effects. \n\nKnowing real essences would enable us to deduce tertiary qualities,\nthen, but what about secondary qualities?  Here matters are initially\nless clear, since Locke seems to be saying both that more acute senses\nwould not do away with the secondary quality of sound, but might do\naway with the secondary quality of color. In one passage, Locke\nimagines our having very acute senses, including “microscopical\neyes”, and he clearly assumes that we would still experience the\nsecondary quality of sound: “If our Sense of Hearing were but\n1000 times quicker than it is, how would a perpetual noise distract\nus” (E II.xxiii.12, pp. 302–303). Yet in a preceding\npassage, he had suggested that if our faculties were designed for\ndetecting real essences, we would not experience color at all: \n\nReflecting upon these examples, however, suggests that he is not, or\nnot always, imagining that microscopical eyes would do away with color\naltogether; rather, it might in some cases enable us to view tinier\nparticles having different colors than that we perceive for the\naggregate object.  For in the example he gives, blood as an aggregate\nbody appears uniformly red, but under a microscope, some parts of it\nappear translucent while only the globules appear red.  Once the\nmicroscope is used, color is not eliminated from the experience of\nseeing blood, but is instead seen as being differently distributed.  A\npixilated painting provides a rough analogy; a shape seen from afar\nmay appear uniformly green, but up close is seen as comprising tiny\nblue and yellow dots. \n\nScientia in natural philosophy would require knowledge both\nof real essences and of their necessary connections among qualities,\nyet neither is possible for human beings, Locke concludes. One\nobstacle to scientia, then, is that real essences escape\nus. God has given us sensory capacities that are suitable for finding our way\nto the “market and exchange” and other practical needs,\nbut are not suitable, as the “microscopical eyes” passage indicates,\nfor detecting the minute parts of bodies. \n\nAnother obstacle is that we are almost entirely unable to discern the\nnecessary causal connections among the qualities of substances. (And\nLocke does take those connections to be necessary--but does he\nconstrue them in terms of nomological or logical necessity?  Given his\nview that demonstrative knowledge in natural philosophy is possible\nfor immortals and serves as an ideal for mortals, he seems to be\nthinking in terms of logical necessity, much like the Aristotelians he\nwas reacting against, a point made by Ott (2009, p. 13).) Locke does\nfind two instances in which we can discern necessary connections\nbetween qualities of bodies: “Some few of the primary Qualities\nhave a necessary dependence, and visible connexion one with another,\nas Figure necessarily presupposes Extension, receiving or\ncommunicating Motion by impulse, supposes Solidity.” (E\nIV.iii.14, p. 546) Apart from these two exceptions, however, necessary\nconnections escape us. In part, this is due to the first obstacle, our\ninability to discover real essences, due to the minuteness of\nparticles. It is also due, however, to the remoteness of so many\nbodies, those which lie “beyond this our Earth and\nAtmosphere…even beyond the Sun, or remotest Star our Eyes have\nyet discovered” (E IV.vi.11, p.586–87, and IV.vi.12,\np.587). For according to Locke’s speculations, all things might be\ncausally interconnected in complex ways, such that we could not know\none without knowing all of the others with which it is causally\nconnected. \n\nBut while human beings cannot attain scientia in natural\nphilosophy, there are other epistemic agents who can. One is, of\ncourse, God, who certainly knows real essences (E III.vi.3, p.\n440), and “’tis possible Angels have” ideas of real\nessences as well (E III.vi.3, p. 440). \n\nThat Locke finds it natural to speak in the same breath of matter\nand spirits marks him as belonging to the age of natural philosophy\nrather than of science. It is because knowledge of necessary\nconnections can be referred to these higher epistemic agents that\nscientia persists so strongly as an ideal, even while he\nrecognizes the need for a quite different conception of knowledge. \n\nThe conclusion that no intuitive or demonstrative knowledge of\nsubstances is possible for us, their real essences and necessary\nconnections being out of reach, places Locke at a crossroads. One path\nis skepticism, the view that without certainty, no knowledge of\nsubstances is possible at all. He rejects that path, denying that\nhyperbolic doubt could be genuine for either the self (E IV.ix.2,\npp. 619–20) or for external objects (E IV.xi.3, p. 631). The\nother path, the one he follows, involves lowering the bar by admitting\na third kind of knowledge, one that lacks certainty: sensitive\nknowledge. (A recent, in-depth examination of how justified Locke is,\nboth in avoiding skepticism and in his position on sensitive\nknowledge, may be found in Priselac 2016.) \n\nSensitive knowledge is knowledge of the “effects [that] come\nevery day within the notice of our Senses”, without an\nunderstanding of their causes; “we must be content to be ignorant\nof” those causes (E IV.iii.29, pp. 559–560). Instead\nof knowing real essences, the causal basis of the properties we\nperceive, we know only those perceived properties, from which we\nconstruct nominal essences. Instead of employing deduction, we\nare forced to rely upon “trials”—observations and\ninduction. Instead of knowing the necessary connections holding\nbetween a substance’s real essence and its other qualities,\nincluding its tertiary qualities (which might include, recall, causal\nconnections with substances beyond the remotest star), we know only the\nco-existences of properties. And from the mere, regular\nco-existence of properties found in observed cases, Locke observes, we\ncould not know with certainty that the same set will be found\nco-existing in the next case. \n\nYet our discoveries about co-existences of properties—though\nthey are merely contingent particulars, or, insofar as they are applied\nbeyond the particular cases we have actually observed, are mere\nprobability—can yet qualify as real knowledge. To do so,\nour ideas must meet certain conditions. The complex idea that we\nrefer to a substance must comprise all and only those simple ideas that\nwe have found to co-exist in nature. Here Locke is concerned to\nshow that sensitive knowledge deserves its appellation, since it can be\ndistinguished from arbitrary or otherwise poorly grounded claims (e.g.,\nthat fluidity has been found to co-exist with brittleness, in a single\nsubstance and at a single given\n temperature.[14])\nSensitive knowledge is\nfar less than scientia, but far more than ungrounded\nopinion. \n\nAs for general claims about substances based upon observed\nparticular matters of fact, these too can qualify as real\nknowledge. Admittedly, it is only probable that, when four of the\nfive properties previously found co-existing together occur again, the\nfifth will be present too. Yet we can still form an abstract idea\nof gold, as a substance having all five properties, and call this\ngeneral claim knowledge, on the grounds that “whatever have once\nhad an union in Nature, may be united again” (E IV.iv.12, p.\n568). \n\nHas contemporary science enabled us to go beyond sensitive\nknowledge—have discoveries about compounds, elements, and\nsubatomic particles provided us with knowledge of real essences?\nMuch of the force of this question derives, to paraphrase Nicholas\nJolley, from the fact that many of those discoveries about\nmatter’s structure were not conceived empirically, but only\nconfirmed empirically; they were initially conceived as possibilities\nby employing the hypothetico-deductive model, and the predictions\ndeduced from the models were then compared to empirical data (Jolley\n2002, p. 69). Yet as Jolley also points out, these commentators may have\nmissed the full import of Locke’s geometric model; in a passage\nquoted earlier, Locke tells us explicitly that if we knew the real\nessence of gold, we could deduce its qualities even if gold did\nnot\n exist.[15]\nSo while the predictions of any model developed via the\nhypothetico-deductive model must survive the test of observations,\nobservations in Locke’s scientia are wholly\nunnecessary. To put the point another way, Locke takes\nnatural philosophy to be an empirical domain only for human beings,\nwith their impoverished faculties. For nobler spirits, it would\nmore resemble geometry. \n\nThe last few decades have seen a lively debate about the role of the\ncorpuscular hypothesis in Locke’s Essay. This\nsection examines the sources of that debate and reviews some of the\nmain positions figuring in it. \n\nAs we have seen, Locke develops some central theses of his\nEssay in connection with the corpuscular hypothesis. In\nhis theory of ideas, corpuscles provide at least a structural basis for\nsimple ideas, and depending upon one’s interpretation, there may\nbe a causal relationship as well. Further, and of particular\ninterest here, Locke often appears to identify a material\nsubstance’s real essence with the set or some subset of its\ncomponent particles’ primary qualities. In the following\nwell-known passage, for instance, he points to the primary qualities of\na body’s parts—their bulk or solidity, motion, and\nshape—as the causal ground of the qualities we\nperceive. \n\nHe similarly seems to identify the real essence of bodies with primary\nqualities when he suggests, just prior to the “microscopical\neyes” passage, that instead of seeing colors (or instead of\nseeing them as we currently do), we could discover bodies’ internal\nconstitutions, if only we knew the ”texture and motion of the\nminute Parts of corporeal things“ (E II.xxiii.12,\npp. 302–303). And a commitment to the corpuscular hypothesis is\nagain suggested when he despairs of understanding the production of\nsecondary qualities: even if “we could discover the size,\nfigure, or motion of those invisible parts, which immediately produce\nthem [secondary qualities],” we still cannot discover any\n“undoubted Rules” concerning their production or\nconnection, nor “conceive how any\nsize, figure, or motion of any Particles, can possibly produce\nin us the Idea of any Colour, Taste, or\nSound” (E IV.iii.13, p. 545). Here he appears to\ndespair of understanding how secondary qualities are produced by\nprimary ones; he appears to take the corpuscular hypothesis’\nreductionist claim to be true, but he despairs of our understanding\nhow the reduction works. \n\nHis discussion of tertiary qualities is similar. If we knew\nthe “Figure, Size, Texture, and Motion of the minute Constituent\nparts of any two Bodies”, we would then be able to derive\ntertiary qualities; we would be able to deduce that opium causes sleep,\nand we would understand why (E IV.iii.25, pp. 555–56; see also E\nIV.iii.13, p. 545). In all of these passages, then, and in many\nsimilar ones, Locke at least appears to accept at least some components\nof the corpuscular hypothesis—that material bodies are compounded\nfrom minute particles, and that certain observable qualities are\nreducible to the particles’ primary qualities of size, shape, and\nmotion. This tendency to speak as though the corpuscular\nhypothesis is true, either in whole or in part, has been termed\nLocke’s “dogmatic” side (Downing 2007). \n\nIn apparent tension with this so-called dogmatic side is what has\nbeen termed his “agnostic” or “skeptical”\nside. The following features of his discussion seem to suggest\nthat he has reasons either for remaining agnostic about whether the\ncorpuscular hypothesis is true, or more seriously, for believing that\nit is wholly unable to explain the phenomena it purports to explain and\ntherefore cannot be true. \n\nFirst, he refers to the\ncorpuscular hypothesis as such, a hypothesis, one that falls well short\nof providing us with scientific knowledge; and further, he remarks that\nit is not his aim to adjudicate among competing hypotheses. \n\nThe hypothetical status of all physical theories is underscored also\nin Some Thoughts Concerning Education: “The systems\nof natural philosophy…are to be read, more to know\nthe hypotheses…than with hopes to gain thereby a\ncomprehensive, scientifical, and satisfactory knowledge of the works\nof nature.”(Locke, quoted in Rogers 1982, p. 230.) But even\nthough all physical theories ultimately be hypotheses, it is useful to\nbear in mind Peter Anstey’s remarks about the genesis of the\ncorpuscular hypothesis.  Although the hypothesis originated among\ntheorists championing an experimental method over a purely speculative\none, that should not seem so ironic in light of the following.\nInstead of excluding speculation entirely, these theorists allowed it,\nso long as it played a limited and secondary role, by waiting to begin\nuntil observation and experiment had already established a solid\nfoundation.  Furthermore, the corpuscular hypothesis had credibility\namong hypotheses, insofar as it adhered to their prohibition against\nquestions they thought could never be answered experimentally, by\navoiding the question about matter’s infinite divisibility.(See\nAnstey, 2011, pp. 4–5.)   \n\nSecond, if Locke indeed identifies material bodies’ real\nessences with the primary qualities of their constituent corpuscles,\nthen that view of real essence, together with his pessimism about the\npossibility of ever discovering real essences, implies pessimism about the\ncorpuscular hypothesis—specifically, about the claims that bodies\nare made of corpuscles and that their observable qualities are\nreducible to the corpuscles’ qualities. In the same\npassages in which Locke seems to accept or assume these central tenets\nof the corpuscular hypothesis—that observable bodies are made up\nof corpuscles and that those corpuscles have a restricted set of\ninherent properties—he simultaneously appears very skeptical\nabout the hypothesis’ promise to reduce observable properties\nsuch as color and taste to that restricted set of primary\nproperties. \n\nThird, Locke arguably takes the corpuscular hypothesis to have\nlimitations or shortcomings so serious that they amount to fatal flaws,\nan interpretation that Margaret Wilson (1979) was perhaps the first to\ndefend. Wilson develops her line of argument mainly in connection\nwith difficulties Locke raises about the corpuscular hypothesis’\npurported ability to explain sensation and more generally, the relation\nbetween thought and\n matter,[16]\nbut some other phenomena are\ntroublesome as well. Locke appears to consider such phenomena to\nbe so obscure that we can attempt to understand them only by\nattributing them to God’s direct action. \n\nElsewhere, Locke will use the term ‘superaddition’ to\nrefer to God’s role. Roughly speaking, superadded\nproperties are those properties specifically added by God. \n\nThis section examines the phenomena that Locke seems to consider too\nobscure for the corpuscular hypothesis to illuminate. These are\nthe three phenomena mentioned in the above-quoted passage, the\nproduction of sensation, the communication of motion,\n cohesion,[17]\nand a fourth,\ngravity, which Locke discusses directly only outside the\nEssay. A subsequent section reviews some of the main\npositions that have been taken in the debate about the status of the\ncorpuscular hypothesis for Locke, and that same section considers\nvarious interpretations of superaddition, since any interpretation of\nthat concept is logically tied to one’s view about Locke’s\nstance toward the corpuscular hypothesis. \n\nAs we saw in passages discussed earlier, in connection with the\nimpossibility of scientia, Locke finds the production of\nsensation to be utterly obscure. One side of the difficulty is,\nof course, the nature of the mind. In all probability, it is\nimmaterial. However, Locke allows, it is possible that God has\nsuperadded the power of thought directly to matter. The other\nside of the difficulty concerns the nature of secondary qualities as\npowers to produce sensations. The appeal of\nthe corpuscular hypothesis lay largely in its reductive promise.\nSecondary qualities in particular, such as colors and sounds, but also\nideas of macrolevel primary qualities, including visual sensations of\nshapes and sizes, and tertiary qualities were to be reduced to the\nprimary qualities of corpuscles, interacting with one another and/or\nwith perceptual systems. \n\nOne part of the corpuscular hypothesis’ purported explanation\nis conceivable, namely, the interactions among the primary\nqualities of bodies, which are supposed to be part of the causal basis\nof our sensations: \n\nIndeed, we are able to discern necessary connections in two\ninstances, as noted earlier. (One case involves only primary\nqualities— “Figure necessarily presupposes Extension”\n(E IV.iii.14, p. 546)—and the other involves tertiary and primary\nqualities—“receiving or communicating Motion by impulse,\nsupposes Solidity” (E IV.iii.14, p. 546).) If we knew more\nabout the primary qualities of bodies, we might multiply such\ninstances: “And if we knew these primary Qualities of\nBodies…we might be able to know a great deal more of these\nOperations of them one upon another.” That is, if we\nknew real essences, we could derive more necessary connections,\nknowing, for instance, the causal relation between opium and sleep, and\nas certainly as we now know that impulse requires solidity. \n\nYet knowing real essences would not give us any genuine knowledge of\nhow sensations are produced by primary qualities.\nWhile corpuscular theorists such as Galileo (The Assayer)\nsketched a reductive account of our sensations of taste in terms of\nparticles striking our tongues, Locke suggests that any attempt to\ndiscover the process’s details will be foiled. For as far\nas we can imagine, a body, by striking other bodies, is able to produce\n“nothing but Motion”\n [18]\n(E IV.iii.6, pp. 540–541), and motion\nmay itself be hopelessly obscure, as indicated below. As for\nshape and size, we can no more imagine how they could figure in the\nproduction of sensations than we can imagine how motion could. \n\nAlthough Locke mentions only secondary qualities here, his point\npresumably applies to all sensations, including our sensations of\nmacrolevel primary qualities, such as the shape and size of a snowball\nor lump of gold. For again, genuine knowledge is knowledge of\nnecessary connections, with the conceptual relations in geometry being\nthe model, and it does not seem possible to discover such connections\nbetween any sensation and the sizes, shapes, and textures that are\nsupposed to cause them. Despite the resemblance of macrolevel\nprimary qualities to microlevel ones, both being of the same\n type,[19]\nthe idea\nof a quality is nonetheless a very different thing than the quality\nitself. \n\nLocke finds that our only way of understanding the production of\nsensation is to attribute the process to God. If we try to understand\nhow motion could produce a color, sound, or taste, “we are fain\nto quit our Reason, go beyond our Ideas, and attribute it\nwholly to the good pleasure of our Maker.” (E IV.iii.6, p.\n540–541; see also IV.iii.28, p. 559.) \n\nWith the publication of Newton’s Principia, implying\nas it did the possibility of unmediated action at a distance, gravity becomes the\nmost nettlesome phenomenon for the orthodox version of the corpuscular\nhypothesis, which includes a proviso of contact action. Locke\nis initially sympathetic to the proviso, writing in the first\nthree editions of his Essay, “How bodies operate one\nupon another…is manifestly by impulse and nothing else. It\nbeing impossible to conceive that body should operate on what it\ndoes not touch.” (E II.viii.11, editions\n1–3) Yet for the fourth edition, he replaces that claim about how\nbodies do operate with one about how we can conceive of them operating:\n“How Bodies produce ideas in us is manifestly by\nimpulse, [this being] the only way which we can conceive Bodies\n[to] operate.”(E II.viii.11, edition 4). He also omits a\nclause appearing in II.viii.12 of previous editions that denied unmediated action\nat a\n distance.[20]\nThese subtle emendations reflect\na dramatic shift, one expressed directly in his correspondence with\nStillingfleet. \n\nThe phenomenon of gravity—as explained by\n“Mr. Newton’s incomparable\nbook”(ibid.)—has apparently led Locke to abandon\nthe contact action proviso and to attribute to matter the power of\nacting distantly, even though the process by which such interactions\ncould occur is so obscure that he is driven to invoking\nsuperaddition. This is the prevailing interpretation of Locke (given\nby Leibniz for one, who targeted Locke for it in Against Barbaric\nPhysics), though not all commentators agree, as indicated in a\nsubsequent section. \n\nLocke takes the notion of impulse, in which bodies communicate\nmotion to one another by surface impact, to be, along with extension\nand cohesion, fundamental to our concept of\n body.[21]\nIndeed, regardless of\nhow motion may in fact be communicated, impulse is the only means by\nwhich we can conceive of its being communicated, a view of our\nconceptual abilities that Locke maintains, as we saw, despite his\nchanging thoughts about gravity. Impulse is also fundamental to the\ncorpuscular hypothesis’ explanation of phenomena, being either\nthe exclusive means of interaction among bodies, as adherents of the\ncontact action proviso hold, or the means of at least many\ninteractions. Yet how exactly does a moving body communicate motion to\na resting one simply by impacting it? When we attempt to discover the\nprecise nature of the process, Locke suggests, we find that it is just\nas mysterious as the process by which the mind moves the body. \n\nSince the corpuscular hypothesis holds impulse to be the primary if\nnot the sole means by which bodies causally interact, then any\nphenomenon that the corpuscular hypothesis purports to explain by\nimpulse is obscure if impulse itself is obscure. All of the\nhypothesis’ reductions of observable primary qualities, of\nsecondary qualities, and of tertiary qualities, would inherit\nimpulse’s obscurity; thus Locke appears to be suggesting here\nthat the corpuscular hypothesis cannot fulfill its promise of\nexplaining and reducing those properties and powers. \n\nSince the claim that observable bodies are made up of particles is\ncentral to the corpuscular hypothesis, an immediate question for its\nproponents asks how the particles cohere into compound bodies.\nPlenists have some resources for answering that question, though those\nresources may introduce worse difficulties. Descartes, for instance,\nthough he speaks in terms of particles, understands an individual body\nas an area of extension moving as one with respect to surrounding\nareas. It is not possible for any particle to move away into empty\nspace, there being no such thing as empty space once matter is\nidentified with extension; with every bit of matter pressed from all\nsides by other matter, there is no problem about cohesion per se,\nthough there is certainly a problem about individuating bodies from\none another. In the same vein, Malebranche can invoke the pressure of\nthe air to explain the coherence of bodies, and then invoke the\npressure of an aether to explain the coherence of air particles. Locke\nobjects that this explanation fails because it leaves us with the\nquestion of what causes the particles of the aether to cohere (E\nII.xxiii.23, p, 308). The objection reveals Locke’s atomist\nsympathies, drawing its power from the presumption that there is such\na thing as empty space into which the aether particles could move. The\nproblem for atomist versions of the corpuscular hypothesis is that the\nrestricted set of properties that they allow the particles\n—size, shape, and motion—provides no obvious resources for\nexplaining how the particles cohere with one another to form compound\nbodies. In various forms, the problem about cohesion has dogged\natomists since ancient times. \n\nThe problem arises in two forms, which, to borrow James Hill’s\nterminology (Hill 2004), may be called the limited and the\nfoundational problems. The limited problem, arising for those who\ntake corpuscles to be genuine atoms, that is, to be indivisible, is the\nproblem of explaining how those indivisible corpuscles cohere with one\nanother. This is the problem one finds in Newton’s\nwritings. Although Rule 3 of the Principia allows the\npossibility that the least parts of matter could turn out to be\ndivisible, his atomist sympathies are evident throughout his\nwritings. He speculates in Query 31 that in all probability,\nbodies are made up of hard particles that only God could divide, and in\nthe body of the Opticks (Book II, Part III, Proposition VII)\nhe suggests that more powerful microscopes might permit us to see the\nlarger particles. In answer to the problem of how those naturally\nindivisible particles cohere, he rejects the ancient solution of hooked\nparticles as begging the question, proposing instead some short-range\nforces modeled on the gravitational force (Query 31).\nNewton’s speculations about such forces are driven by an absence\nof any resolution to the problem about cohesion within the corpuscular\ntheory itself. \n\nThe foundational problem pushes the question about cohesion into the\ncorpuscles themselves. The problem was raised by Joseph Glanvill:\n“If it be pretended…that the parts of solid bodies are\nheld together by hooks, and angulous involutions; I\nsay, this comes not home: For the coherence of the parts of\nthese hooks…will be of as difficult a conception, as\nthe former.”(Glanvill, The Vanity of Dogmatizing, p. 18,\nquoted in Hill 2004, p. 616) Without any grounds for asserting\nthat the divisibility of matter bottoms out in indivisible corpuscles,\nthen, the question arises of how the parts of a corpuscle could cohere,\nhow the parts of those parts could cohere, and so on, ending in the\nquestion of how extended bodies are possible at all. \n\nWhatever his ultimate view of the corpuscular hypothesis, Locke\ninevitably faces the atomist’s problem about cohesion, accepting\nas he does void space (see II.xiii.11, 12–14, 21–23), and holding that\nour ideas of body depend fundamentally upon cohesion. One of the\nideas “proper and peculiar” to body, he writes, is\n“the cohesion of solid, and consequently separable\nparts” (E II.xxiii.17, p. 306), and the extension of\nbody, as opposed to the extension of space, is “nothing, but the\ncohesion or continuity of solid, separable, moveable Parts”(E\nII.iv.5, p. 126). Yet we have no understanding of cohesion, and\nso our idea of body does not rest on any genuine understanding of\nit. In trying to understand how bodies are extended, we are as\nmuch in the dark as when we try to understand how the soul thinks. \n\nOne scholarly debate about cohesion concerns the question of whether\nLocke acknowledged only the limited problem, as one would expect from\ncommentators who read him as accepting atomism (e.g. Mandelbaum 1964,\np. 1), or whether he looked further, to the more serious, foundational\nproblem, as Hill argues (2004). A related controversy, to\nbe discussed in the next section, concerns the questions of whether\nLocke concludes that the corpuscular hypothesis simply cannot resolve\nthe problem (e.g., Hill 2004; Downing 2007, p. 408), or whether he\nremains agnostic on the issue (e.g., McCann in Chappell 1998, p.\n244). \n\nThe four problematic phenomena winnow away the components of the\ncorpuscular hypothesis, as defined at the outset of this article.  The\nproblem about sensation threatens the corpuscular hypothesis’ promise\nof reducing secondary, tertiary, and macrolevel primary qualities to\nmicrolevel primary qualities. Newton’s results about gravitational\nphenomena cast grave doubts upon the contact action proviso, and\naccording to some commentators, those results lead Locke to abandon\nthe belief that impulse is the only means of causal interaction. A\ncorpuscular theorist might hope to preserve some part of the theory by\ninsisting that impulse is still the means by which most other causal\ninteractions are effected; but this runs up against the problem about\nimpulse, in that the process by which motion is communicated seems\nutterly obscure. Finally, even the core claim that observable bodies\nare composed of tiny corpuscles is threatened by the problem of\ncohesion. This last problem threatens to be the most serious of four\nphenomena, for as James Hill has pointed out (2004, p. 628), the\nproblems about gravity, sensation, and motion arise subsequent to our\nhaving conceived of body, whereas the problem about cohesion may\nthwart our very ability to conceive clearly of body. \n\nThis section considers some main responses to the tension between\nLocke’s seeming acceptance of the corpuscular hypothesis, most\nnotable in his apparent identification of a material substance’s\nreal essence with the size, shape, and texture of its insensible parts,\nand his pessimism about the hypothesis’ explanatory power, most\nnotable in his remarks about the four phenomena discussed\nabove. \n\nOne approach to the tension is to understand it as a genuine\ninconsistency. Margaret Wilson has defended such an\ninterpretation, though in the 1979 paper that launched the debate, her\nintent is to show how acutely Locke understood the explanatory\nlimitations of “Boylean mechanism”. Specifically,\nWilson argues, the inconsistency reveals Locke’s recognition\n“that some presumed properties of matter cannot be\nconceived as ‘natural’ consequences of Boylean primary\nqualities” (Wilson 1979, p. 197). Thus our ignorance about\nbodies has more profound causes than our ignorance about the primary\nqualities of a body’s constituent corpuscles. In accordance\nwith her view that Locke’s agnostic tendencies (just like his\ndogmatic ones) are genuine, Wilson interprets Locke’s concept of\nsuperaddition robustly, as a sort of divine action that goes beyond the\ncorpuscular hypothesis. According to this\n“non-essentialist” or “divine annexation”\nreading, Locke understands superadded properties as properties that God\nhas annexed to matter by fiat, and that bear no intrinsic connection to\nmatter’s real essence. This reading implies a distinction\nin etiology for superadded qualities. Whereas the other qualities\nof matter are either given initially, as those qualities constituting\nthe real essence, or else flow from the real essence, superadded\nqualities are added on after the fact, such that the substance could\nhave been complete without them. \n\nSome other interpretations absolve Locke of inconsistency, either by\nemphasizing his so-called dogmatic side while downplaying or\nreinterpreting his agnostic tendencies, or emphasizing his agnosticism\nwhile downplaying his dogmatism. One line of interpretation, then,\nreads Locke as in some manner accepting the corpuscular\nhypothesis (Mandelbaum 1964, chapter 1; Osler 1970, p. 12; Ayers\n1975; McCann 1994, §1 and p. 85; McCann 2002, pp. 354–355).\nAccording to weaker versions of this reading, Locke’s project is the\nnaturalistic one of pursuing the philosophical implications of the\nbest available scientific theory, and developing an epistemological\nbasis for it. McCann, for example, reads Locke as defending the\natomist version of the corpuscular philosophy over its Cartesian\ncompetitor by providing an epistemology for it. While Descartes had\nprovided an epistemology for his plenist version, there was nothing\ncomparable for the atomist version associated with Gassendi and Boyle\nuntil Locke supplied it (McCann 2002, pp. 354–355). According to\nAyers’ stronger interpretation, Locke accepts “pure\nmechanism”, that is, the orthodox version of the corpuscular\nhypothesis, which includes the contact action proviso.  According\nto this view, all of matter’s qualities flow from its real essence\n(Ayers 1981). \n\nSince this line of interpretation seeks to downplay Locke’s\nagnostic tendencies, one challenge is to account for Locke’s\npessimism about the possibility of our knowing real essences.\nMandelbaum meets the challenge by confining Locke’s pessimism to\nthe real essences of particular material substances; we are able to\nknow “the general properties possessed by all material\nsubstances”, and are ignorant only of the “particular\nsizes, shapes, number, or motions of the particles which go to make up\nany specific object”(Mandelbaum 1964, p. 54). A related\nchallenge is to account for Locke’s appeals to superaddition,\nsince prima facie, Locke’s reason for invoking God is\nthat he thinks the corpuscular hypothesis has no resources for\nexplaining the four problematic phenomena. Ayers responds by\nrejecting Wilson’s divine annexation interpretation of\nsuperaddition in favor of a deflationary one. According to\nAyers’ “divine architect” interpretation, Locke makes\nno distinction in etiology by calling a property superadded; he means\nonly that God selected the property with particular care when first\ncreating matter. To diffuse the effect of Locke’s remarks\nto Stillingfleet, in which Locke appears to embrace action at a\ndistance, Ayers points to Locke’s late manuscript, “The\nElements of Natural Philosophy”, interpreting certain passages as\nreferring gravitational effects to an undetectable medium (Ayers 1981,\npp. 212–214). This move has been challenged by Stuart.\nClaiming that the manuscript was probably written for the education of\na child, Stuart denies that it could trump Locke’s remarks to\nStillingfleet (see Stuart 1998, pp. 378–379). \n\nAnother way to absolve Locke of inconsistency is to emphasize his\nagnosticism or skepticism, while downplaying or reinterpreting\npassages that appear to commit him to the corpuscular hypothesis.\nInterpretations in this vein tend to emphasize Locke’s pessimism about\nour ability to know real essences, to discern necessary connections,\nand consequently, to have scientia in natural\nphilosophy. Commentators pursuing this line include Jolley and Downing\n(and more recently Connolly (2015), who argues for an even greater\nepistemic humility, one extending to real essences, along with\nsuperaddition, mentioned briefly below).  \n\nThe central challenge facing such interpretations is to account for\nthe passages in which Locke speaks as though he accepts the corpuscular\nhypothesis, most notably those in which he appears to identify the real\nessences of material substances with the corpuscles’ primary\nqualities. Jolley (2002) accounts for Locke’s so-called\ndogmatic tendency in strategic terms. Locke’s\nEssay targets both Aristotelians and Cartesians, and though\nagnosticism, which targets the Cartesians, is ultimately the dominant\ntendency in his thought, Locke emphasizes the explanatory power of the\ncorpuscular hypothesis whenever he has the Aristotelians in his\nsights. Downing (1998, 2007), meanwhile, interprets Locke’s\nEssay as developing metaphysical distinctions that constrain\nphysical theory, and then downplays his dogmatic side by taking the\ncorpuscular hypothesis to be truly only a hypothesis for him, and\ndenying that real essence can be identified with primary\nqualities. Properly understood, Downing argues, the distinction\nbetween real and nominal essence is a metaphysical distinction.\nIt is thus more fundamental than the distinction between primary and\nsecondary qualities, which belongs to a particular physical theory, the\ncorpuscular hypothesis. To be worth its salt, a physical\ntheory must meet the metaphysical constraint provided by the\nreal-nominal essence distinction. That is, the physical theory\nmust provide some way of making sense of the notion that material\nbodies have an internal constitution that is inaccessible to us but\nthat produces those qualities that are accessible. Locke explains\nhis metaphysical distinction using one physical theory, the corpuscular\nhypothesis, as an illustration, and he often appears to accept or even\ndefend that hypothesis. Still, this is only an appearance, an\nappearance due to a certain advantage that the corpuscular hypothesis\nhas over other physical hypotheses: it is the theory best suited to our\nsensory capacities and understanding. Despite its unique status,\nLocke sees it as only a hypothesis, one crippled by the explanatory\nlimitations evidenced by the problematic phenomena discussed\nearlier. For Downing, then, Locke’s dogmatic tendencies\ndisappear, leaving only his agnostic side. \nTaking a different approach to the situation, Jacovides (2017) has\nrecently treated Locke’s descriptions of what we perceive,\nintuit, and are capable of conceiving as providing a case for testing\nsome Kuhnian theses; as the normal science of his day, the\ncorpuscularian hypothesis sets limits upon what Locke can\nconceive. \nLocke and Newton probably first met in 1689 (though the exact date is\nnot known; Westfall 1980, p. 488; Rogers 1982, p. 219), and their main\nworks were written independently of one another;\nLocke’s Essay,though published subsequently, was\nessentially complete by the time he read the Principia.  A\nnoticeable intellectual affinity may nevertheless be seen in those\nworks, and the opportunity for mutual influence followed as they\nestablished a friendship, exchanging views on a wide variety of\nsubjects, not least certain unorthodox theological convictions (see\nWestfall 1980, 490–91).  The influence did not run in one\ndirection alone; in a draft passage probably penned shortly after\nthe Principia’s second edition, for example, Newton\nadopts a Lockean tone as he denies that any ideas are\ninnate.[22] As\nfor Newton’s influence upon Locke, the best known example\nconcerns action at a distance, as noted below, though there are deeper\nquestions about methodology. \nA good deal of resemblance to Locke’s epistemological approach\ncan be seen in Newton, who holds that, revelation apart, we must\ngather what knowledge we can from our perceptions, and anything like a\nreal essence eludes us.  In the early manuscript, De\nGravitatione, for instance, Newton denies knowing the\n“essential and metaphysical constitution” of matter\n(Newton, 2004, p. 27). He reiterates this position in later texts,\nincluding the 1713 General Scholium: “We certainly do not know\nwhat is the substance of any thing. We see only the shapes and colors\nof bodies, we hear only their sounds, we touch only their external\nsurfaces….But there is no direct sense and there are no\nindirect reflected actions by which we know innermost\nsubstances”(Principia, 942). \nLocke and Newton also share the problem of an evidentiary deficit,\ninsofar as they subscribe to corpuscularianism. Thinkers who did\nsubscribe tended to rely on transduction (also called\ntransdiction)--an inductive inference that is empirical insofar as it\nrelies upon observed cases, but which generalizes not only to\nunobserved cases but to ones that are\nunobservable.[23])\n Newton’s Rule 3 licensed such\ninferences, from the Principia’s second edition onward,\nfor qualities of invariable intensity, i.e., extension,\nimpenetrability, hardness, mobility, and the vis\ninertiae. The rule is explicit in permitting inferences to the\nrealm of the unobservable: “Because the hardness of the whole\narises from the hardness of the parts, we justly infer from this not\nonly the hardness of the undivided particles of bodies that are\naccessible to our senses, but also of all other\nbodies.”(Principia, Book 3,\np. 795.[24] ) As\nfor Locke and the problem of transduction, how serious it is for him\ndepends largely upon the status of the corpuscular hypothesis. If he\ntakes an agnostic or skeptical stance toward it, then he owes no\nsolution to the problem.\n \nAlthough the endeavors of Locke and Newton are often considered\ncomplementary, there are questions about how Locke responded to\nthe Principia, both in terms of its methodology and its\nepistemological implications.  With regard to the former, how far did\nLocke go in absorbing or incorporating the methodology that Newton had\nforged?  As a number of commentators have emphasized, the new science\nwas itself in flux at this time, with natural history being gradually\nsidelined by Newton’s approach, an experimentalism that was\ntheoretical and mathematical (see, e.g., Anstey 2011; Roux, 2013).\nGiven that Locke had had Boyle as his mentor, but was greatly\nimpressed by Newton’s Principia, it is natural to ask\nwhether a similar shift was occurring in Locke’s own\nthought. Although Locke was clearly influenced by Newton, his\nallegiances to certain older ideas ran deep. Graciela De Pierris\n(2006) explains Locke’s failure to adopt the method of inductive\nproof in terms of his devotion to the ideal of demonstrative\nknowledge, as combined with a belief in hidden primary qualities.  \n\nWith regard to its epistemological implications, what\nprecisely did Locke take the Principia to have achieved?  \nTo pose the question in the starkest possible terms, might\nNewton’s Principia have tempted Locke to retreat from his\nbelief that natural philosophy cannot be made a science (much as it\nled him to retreat from the contact action proviso)? Perhaps Locke\ncategorized Newton’s epistemological achievement in natural philosophy\nas a contribution to sensitive knowledge alone.  That is, perhaps he\nsaw Newton’s “mighty Designs in advancing the Sciences”\n(Essay, Epistle to the Reader, pp. 9–10) as confined to\nproviding a firm basis for natural philosophy through his experimental\nmethod. But did he perhaps instead take Newton’s mathematical methods\nas offering the demonstrations needed to push natural philosophy into\nthe domain of demonstrative knowledge and hence scientia? \n\nCommentators interpreting Locke as seeing Newton’s contribution in\nterms of sensitive knowledge alone include Yolton (1969); Woolhouse\n(1994); and Downing (1997, see especially pp. 292–93).  Kenneth\nWinkler (2008), however, reads Locke’s correspondence with\nStillingfleet and other writings from the 1690’s as a defense of\nNewton’s mathematical physics, and one that draws from his\nmathematical demonstrations a greater optimism about the possibility\nof certain knowledge in natural philosophy. This move has been\ncontested by Domski (2012), who argues that Locke advocated Newton’s\nmathematical methods only in connection with astronomy, whose objects\nare unavailable for experimentation; and that Locke maintained his\nemphasis upon natural historical methods for questions about\nterrestrial bodies. \n\nLocke and Newton accept similar ontologies. Although both (quite\nindependently of one another) are characteristically circumspect about\nthe nature of mind, they may be considered substance dualists. Newton,\nthough indicating in the early manuscript\nDe Gravitatione that he does not pretend to know the\nsubstantial foundation of minds, consistently presents God and minds\nas immaterial, lacking certain characteristics of body, namely,\nhardness, impenetrability and resistance. Similarly, Locke, though he\nexplicitly allows the possibility of thinking matter in his\nEssay and discusses it at length with Stillingfleet,\nemphasizes that in all probability, the soul is immaterial (E\nIV.iii.6, pp. 540–541). But while Newton takes even immaterial spirits\nto be spatially extended, such that a mind can co-occupy place with a\nbody and God with all bodies, it is not clear that Locke agrees.\nAgreement might be claimed on the basis of the several passages in the\nEssay. At E II xxvii.2 (p. 329 ), he locates spirits\nspatially: “Finite spirits having had each its determinate time\nand place of beginning to exist, the relation to that time and place\nwill always determine to each of them its identity, as long as it\nexists.” And as the passage continues, he seems to echo\nNewton’s suggestion that substances of different kinds might\nshare place; although substances of the same kind exclude one another\nout of the same place, he writes, “these three sorts of\nsubstances, as we term them, do not exclude one another out of the\nsame place”. Yet a Cartesian interpretation does not seem\nimpossible here, especially in light of remarks elsewhere; in\ndiscussing the possibility of thinking matter, the immaterial soul\nagainst which he contrasts it is\n unextended.[25] \n\nAs for the concept of body, their views are again similar, without\nbeing identical. Both confront the problem of a substratum or\nsubstance in general, one that Locke notoriously finds\n vexing.[26]\nNewton\ndispenses with the problem more easily. In De\nGravitatione, he eliminates the unintelligible notion of prime matter\nby associating perceived properties with determined regions\nof\n extension.[27]\nBoth also attack Descartes’\nidentification of matter with extension, instead defending the void and\nshowing strong sympathy for atomism. As indicated just above,\nNewton does not confine the quality of extension to body and space, whereas Locke\nmay do so. Further, Newton’s list in Rule 3 of body’s universal qualities \nincludes not only extension, hardness, impenetrability, and mobility,\nbut also the vis inertiae—the inherent force or power of\nresisting (Principia, Definition 3), which some commentators\ntake Newton to identify with\n mass.[28]\nLocke’s concept, however, emphasizes\nextension, mobility, and solidity, without mentioning mass.\nStill, since Locke explicates solidity in terms of impenetrability,\nwhich arises from resistance (E II.iv.1) there may be grounds for\nholding that his concept does after all include mass, a position\ndefended by Woolhouse\n (2005).[29]\nAt the least, Locke’s discussion\nof action by impulse presupposes mass, as Stein has noted. And\nyet presupposing the concept may not amount to including it in the\nconcept of body, since as Stein points out, mass for Locke\n“cannot be construed to correspond to a simple idea, but can only\nbe understood as a power ‘mediately perceivable.’”\n(Stein 1990, p. 36) \n\nThere is also the question about gravity’s relation to body, for\nboth thinkers a persistent source of\ncontroversy.[30]\nOne point of clarity and consensus is that neither Locke nor Newton\nconsiders the power of gravitational attraction to be essential to\nmatter.  Newton consistently denies that it is essential (for instance\nin his explanatory remarks following Rule 3 of the Principia)\nand Locke refers to it only as power superadded or endowed by God.\nLocke’s concept of superaddition is controversial of course, as\nnoted earlier, but he does appear to embrace action at a distance in\nhis letter to Stillingfleet. Newton’s writings contain no such\ndramatic pronouncements. So while a few commentators interpret Newton\nas accepting action at a distance, grounded either in a superadded\nproperty (Henry 1994) or in a relational quality of matter (Schliesser\n2011), his more favorable remarks are at best indirect. Most\ncommentators interpret him as at least having very grave misgivings\nabout distant action, so perhaps Locke was wise to credit his change\nof heart about gravity to “Mr. Newton’s incomparable\nbook”, rather than to Newton himself.","contact.mail":"hkochiras@phs.uoa.gr","contact.domain":"phs.uoa.gr"}]
