Robinson","entry":"tibbon","body.text":"\n\n\n\nSamuel Ibn Tibbon (c. 1165–1232) was a translator, philosopher,\nand philosophical commentator on the Bible. He is most famous for his\ntranslation of Maimonides’ Guide of the Perplexed from\nArabic into Hebrew, but he translated other works by Maimonides, and\nproduced the first Hebrew versions of Aristotle and Averroes. In\naddition to his work as translator, Ibn Tibbon was an original\nauthor in his own right. He wrote the first full Aristotelian/Maimonidean\nexplication of the biblical book Ecclesiastes, a\nphilosophical-exegetical monograph entitled Ma’amar Yiqqawu\nha-Mayim, and several smaller philosophical-exegetical treatises\nand epistles. His work was especially important in his native southern\nFrance (“Provence”), but he had significant influence also\non Jewish philosophy and exegesis in Italy, Byzantium, and Spain, through the\nthirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries. He is rightfully\nconsidered the founder of Maimonideanism, a philosophical-exegetical\nmovement in medieval Judaism.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, southern France (the Midi,\nOccitania, what the Jews called “Provence”) was the most\nactive center of Jewish philosophy. There, in the communities of\nBéziers, Carcassonne, Narbonne, Lunel, Montpellier, Arles, and\nMarseilles, Jewish scholars devoted themselves to the translation and\ndissemination of philosophical texts and ideas. During the period\n1148–1306 in particular—from the Almohad persecutions in Islamic\nSpain to the expulsion of the Jews from France—much of the\nclassical tradition, as translated into Arabic and developed in the\nIslamic world, was made available in Hebrew. This included works of\nphilosophy and theology, logic and grammar, mathematics, astronomy,\nastrology, and medicine. \n\nThe main translators during this period were members of a single\nfamily. Judah Ibn Tibbon (c. 1120–1190), a native of Granada,\nresettled in Lunel, where he devoted himself to the translation of\nJudaeo-Arabic works, including texts by Saadia Gaon, Jonah Ibn Janah,\nSolomon Ibn Gabirol, Bahya Ibn Paquda, and Judah Halevi. His son\nSamuel (c. 1165–1232) translated Maimonides, and produced the first\nHebrew versions of Aristotle (the Meteorology) and Averroes\n(“Three Treatises on Conjunction,” two by Averroes and one\nby Averroes’ son ‘Abd Allah). Most prolific was the next\ngeneration of translators. Thus Jacob Anatoli (c. 1194–1256), the\nson-in-law and chief disciple of Samuel, translated Ptolemy,\nAverroes’ abridgement of Ptolemy, al-Farghani, and\nAverroes’ middle commentaries on Aristotle’s Organon;\nwhile Samuel’s son Moses (fl. 1244–1283) translated dozens of\nworks by Euclid, Geminus, Theodosius, Themistius, Hunayn b. Ishaq, Abu\nBakr al-Razi, Ibn al-Haytham, al-Hassar, Ibn al-Jazzar, al-Farabi,\nAvicenna, Ibn al-Sid al-Batalyawsi, Averroes, Jabir Ibn Aflah,\nal-Bitruji, and Maimonides. The last major figure of the family was\nJacob b. Makhir (c.  1236–1306), who translated additional works from\nArabic, by Euclid, Menelaus, Autolycus, Theodosius, Qusta b. Luqa, Ibn\nal-Haytham, Ibn al-Saffar, Azarquel, Jabir ibn Aflah, and Averroes. He\nalso seems to have rendered a work from the Latin: a medical text by\nhis contemporary Arnold of Villanova. \n\nThe Ibn Tibbon dynasty of translators was instrumental in creating a\nphilosophical library in Hebrew. They also developed a technical\nterminology, which was used by translators, philosophers, and\ncommentators throughout the Middle Ages. Perhaps more significant,\nhowever, were their contributions as original authors. Thus Samuel and\nMoses wrote philosophical commentaries on the Bible and rabbinic\nliterature and philosophical-exegetical monographs, while Jacob\nAnatoli wrote a collection of philosophical sermons. These writings,\ninspired by the work of Maimonides and saturated with the philosophy\nof al-Farabi and Averroes, laid the foundations for a whole\nmovement of Jewish philosophy and exegesis: Maimonideanism. This\nmovement attracted enthusiasts in Provence, as well as in Italy,\nByzantium, and to a lesser extent Spain. It exercised influence and\ncaused controversy throughout the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries\nand even into the fifteenth, when Jewish philosophy gradually turned\nto Christian-Latin rather than Graeco-Arabic and Arabic sources for\ninspiration. \n\nSamuel Ibn Tibbon—the second generation of the Ibn Tibbon\ndynasty—was born in Lunel, a small but very active rabbinic\ncenter in southern France. There\nhis father raised him and educated him according to the ideals of\nIslamic Spain. Thus, in addition to classical Jewish\nsubjects—Hebrew language, Hebrew Bible, and Rabbinic\nliterature—Samuel studied Arabic, philosophy and\nmedicine. Samuel was also introduced to the literary arts, including\ncalligraphy, poetry, and epistolary. But the world of belles lettres\ndid not find favor with the younger Ibn Tibbon; he was far more\ninterested in philosophy than poetry. \n\nAlthough Samuel was raised in Lunel, he traveled extensively for\nbusiness and in pursuit of knowledge. During his youth, he visited\nMarseilles with his father in order to engage in commerce. He\ncompleted his translation of the Guide of the Perplexed in\nArles in 1204, consulted manuscripts of the Meteorology in\nToledo and Barcelona (between 1204–1210), and traveled twice to\nAlexandria, returning in 1210 and 1213 (while in Egypt he seems to\nhave acquired Maimonides’ “Letter to Yemen” and an\nautograph copy of the Mishneh Torah). By 1211, Samuel\nseems to have moved his primary residence to Marseilles. There Jewish\nsages, on their way to the holy land, visited him in order to consult\nhis translation of the Guide. It was in Marseilles, moreover,\nwhere he taught his son-in-law and most famous disciple Jacob\nAnatoli. \n\nDuring his early years, Samuel was influenced primarily by his\nfather. His mature work, in contrast, was built largely upon the\nfoundations of Maimonides. Samuel translated the Guide and\nother writings by Maimonides, and corresponded with the “True\nSage” regarding problems of translation and interpretation. In\nfact, much of Ibn Tibbon’s life work was devoted to the explanation\nand dissemination of the teachings of Maimonides. But promoting\nMaimonides meant engaging philosophy more generally as well. Thus he\nacquired extensive knowledge of al-Farabi, cited and discussed\nAvicenna, and was one of the first scholars to make use of Averroes\nand al-Bitruji. There is some evidence that Samuel had contact with\nearly Christian scholasticism as well. This is suggested by the\nsurprising similarity between the interests of Ibn Tibbon and those of\nhis contemporaries, such as Michael Scot and Alfred of Sarashel. \n\nOf all the members of the Ibn Tibbon family, Samuel was the most\ninfluential. He was already quoted and eulogized by his contemporary,\nDavid Kimhi, and had decisive impact on the work of his son Moses and\nson-in-law Jacob Anatoli. But his influence is felt elsewhere as well.\nFor example, in thirteenth-century Provence, he was plagiarized by\nGershom b. Solomon, cited and discussed by Levi b. Abraham, and\ndefended by Menahem ha-Meiri. In Italy, his writings were consulted\nand commented upon by Moses of Salerno, Zerahyah b. Isaac b. Shealtiel\nHen, Judah Romano, and especially Immanuel of Rome, who excerpted\nlarge sections from Ibn Tibbon’s writings and incorporated them into\nhis commentaries on the Bible. So important was Ibn Tibbon’s work that\nhe was singled out by the opponents of philosophy. Thus Jacob b.\nSheshet wrote a full-length critique of Ibn Tibbon’s Ma’amar\nYiqqawu ha-Mayim, while Solomon b. Abraham of Montpellier —\nthe main anti-Maimonidean activist during the Maimonidean controversy\nof the 1230s — accused him of revealing the secrets of\nthe Guide to the uninitiated.  In the thirteenth and\nfourteenth centuries, Ibn Tibbon was second to none as Maimonidean\nauthority in philosophy and philosophical exegesis. \n\nThe primary occupation of Samuel Ibn Tibbon was translator. This is\nwhat he was trained to be by his father. His most famous translation\nis the Guide of the Perplexed.  But he also translated other\nworks by Maimonides, and produced the first Hebrew versions of\nAristotle and Averroes. A brief description of each of the\ntranslations will be given here. \n\n1. Maimonides, Commentary on the Mishnah, Avot\n\nThe first major translation of Maimonides by Ibn Tibbon was the\ncommentary on Avot, which was completed, according to the manuscript,\nin 1202. Ibn Tibbon translated the commentary proper together with\nMaimonides’ introduction, entitled “Eight Chapters.”\nThe preface in particular, consisting of an introduction to and\nadaptation of Aristotelian ethics, would become the standard\nintroduction to philosophical ethics in Hebrew throughout the later\nMiddle Ages. \n\n2. Maimonides, “Treatise on Resurrection”\n\nIt seems that the “Treatise on Resurrection” was\ntranslated into Hebrew during the resurrection controversy\n(1202–1204), when Maimonides was accused of denying this religious\ndogma. Ibn Tibbon translated it, and, it seems, sent it to Toledo,\nwhere it was retranslated into Arabic and translated afresh by Judah\nal-Harizi into a more fluid and readable Hebrew style. \n\n3. Maimonides, Guide of the Perplexed\n\nIbn Tibbon began to work on this translation already in the 1190s,\ncorresponded with Maimonides regarding problems of translation and\ninterpretation, produced a first edition in 1204, and a revised version,\nwith glossary (Perush ha-Millot ha-Zarot), in 1213. The\ntranslation itself generally circulated with the glossary, together\nwith Ibn Tibbon’s marginal annotations, an introduction on\ntranslation, and other study aids and ad hoc discussions. \n\n4. Maimonides, “Letter on Translation”\n\nWhile working on the translation of the Guide, Ibn Tibbon\ncorresponded with Maimonides, but only one letter by Maimonides\nsurvives. This letter is a complex text, which includes a brief\nintroduction, discussion of problems in translation, a description of\nhis busy life in Fustat, and recommendations for philosophical\nreading.  The letter was originally written in Arabic, but survives\nonly in several Hebrew translations, one of which was rendered by Ibn\nTibbon himself. This translation also includes Ibn Tibbon’s own\n(often critical) remarks on Maimonides’ suggested renderings of\ndifficult Arabic terms. \n\n5. Aristotle, Meteorology\n\nIbn Tibbon’s translation of the Meteorology was completed,\naccording to a manuscript colophon, in 1210, while returning by boat\nfrom Alexandria. In the preface, he discusses the problems of\ntranslating this work: the subject was difficult, the Arabic\ntranslation obscure, and the manuscripts corrupt. Thus he consulted\nmanuscripts in Barcelona and Toledo in order to help reconstruct the\noriginal. He also examined the commentaries on it by Alexander of\nAphrodisias, Avicenna, and Averroes—for textual witnesses and to\nhelp understand the text. In some cases, he incorporated translations\nfrom the commentators into the translation itself. Ibn Tibbon’s\npreface to the translation includes the beginnings of a lexicon,\nperhaps part of a larger project, which was never completed or was\nincorporated into his larger glossary (to be discussed below). \n\nWhy did Ibn Tibbon translate the Meteorology before any other\nwork by Aristotle? It seems that he did this in response to a remark made\nby Maimonides in Guide 2:30—that Meteorology\nis the key to understanding the “account of the beginning”\nin Genesis, chapter 1. \n\n6. Averroes and ‘Abd Allah, “Three Treatises on\nConjunction”\n\nThe translation of three short treatises on conjunction with the\nactive intellect by Averroes and Averroes’ son ‘Abd Allah\nwas also a pioneering project. They were the first works of Averroes\nrendered into Hebrew, before any of the commentaries on Aristotle. Ibn\nTibbon translated them and attached them to his commentary on\nEcclesiastes. He did this, he maintained, because Averroes and Solomon\nwere aiming to do precisely the same thing: to defend the doctrine of\nconjunction against skeptics who denied that it was possible. \n\nThese translations, therefore, like the Meteorology, had\nstrong exegetical significance. But they were read in their own right\nas well. They circulated independently of the commentary on\nEcclesiastes, and became standard textbooks in the discussion of\nimmortality. Thus, for example, they were included in Gershom b.\nSolomon’s encyclopedic work Sha‘ar ha-Shamayim,\nwere commented on by Gersonides, and were incorporated into Hanokh b.\nSolomon al-Konstantini’s Marot Elohim. A composite\nLatin version, based on the Hebrew, circulated under the title De\nanimae beatitudine. \n\n7. Maimonides, “Letter to Yemen” \n\nThe last known translation by Ibn Tibbon is Maimonides’\n“Letter to Yemen.” This text he seems to have acquired\nwhile in Egypt; and he translated it into Hebrew circa 1214. Why he\ntranslated this text is not known. But it seems that it did not\ncirculate widely. Thus already in the 1230s Abraham ibn Hasdai found\nit necessary to produce a fresh translation of the work, since he\ncould not find a copy of the rendering by his predecessor. \n\n8. Other translations\n\nIbn Tibbon incorporated translations and summaries of Arabic texts\ninto his original writings as well. This is true in the glossary\nattached to the Guide (Perush ha-Millot ha-Zarot),\nhis commentary on Ecclesiastes, and Ma’amar Yiqqawu\nha-Mayim. Three of the most important examples are the\nfollowing: \n\n8.1 Al-Farabi, Short Summary of Porphyry’s Isagoge and\nAristotle’s Categories\n\nThe first entry in Ibn Tibbon’s glossary is the definition of\nthe ten categories and five predicables. Most of the text presented\nthere is a word-for-word translation from al-Farabi. \n\n8.2 Al-Bitruji, Principles of Astronomy\n\nIn the glossary, commentary on Ecclesiastes, and Ma’amar\nYiqqawu ha-Mayim, Ibn Tibbon presents a brief summary of\nal-Bitruji’s astronomy; these were the first appearances of\nBitruji’s novel theories in Hebrew. In the following generation,\nthe entire text of al-Bitruji was translated by Samuel’s son\nMoses. \n\n8.3 Avicenna, Kitab al-Shifa’, Meteorology\n\nIn the third chapter of Ma’amar Yiqqawu ha-Mayim, Ibn\nTibbon presents a partial translation of a section from Avicenna’s\nShifa’ on mountain formation. The theory of\nAvicenna—that erosion is prevented by the mixture of mud with\nfatty oils—contributed to Ibn Tibbon’s discussion there of\neternity of the world and the possibility of spontaneous\ngeneration. \n\n9. Spurious and doubtful translations\n\nMany other translations are attributed to Ibn Tibbon in manuscripts,\nmanuscript catalogues, and later sources. Most are clearly spurious;\nbut two are worth mentioning. Isaac Abarbanel refers to a translation\nby Ibn Tibbon of Maimonides’ introduction to chapter ten of\nMishnah Sanhedrin, but this translation does not survive. An anonymous\ntranslation of the text, published by Kupfer, is clearly not his work.\nThe second is a translation of ‘Ali b. Ridwan’s commentary on\nGalen’s Ars parva. According to the colophon, this\ntranslation was completed by Ibn Tibbon in Béziers in 1199. If\nthis attribution were correct, it would contribute important\ninformation to Ibn Tibbon’s biography. It would also establish the\nvery early existence of an Arabic medical text in Hebrew. The\ntranslation itself, however, uses terms such as nirdaf for\nsynonym that were not part of Ibn Tibbon’s translation lexicon. If it\nis his work it was done much later or revised by a later hand\n(cf. Freudenthal and Fontaine). \n\nIbn Tibbon’s translations are generally literal. Unlike Judah\nal-Harizi, his rival translator, he was not concerned with felicity of\nstyle or purity of language but accuracy in meaning. Thus he uses\nrabbinic as well as biblical expressions, follows the syntax of the\nArabic, and coins new terms, based on the model of the Arabic. He was\ncriticized for this method—by al-Harizi and others—but it\nwas his method and terminology that ultimately won out and became\nauthoritative throughout the later middle ages. \n\nIbn Tibbon discusses the problems and difficulties of translation in\nseveral texts: The preface to the translation of the Guide,\nthe prologue to his “Letter on Providence,” the preface to\nthe glossary and the glossary itself, the preface to\nMeteorology, and the commentary on Ecclesiastes. What I would\nlike to do here is present a brief synthetic characterization of Ibn\nTibbon’s method of translation based on these sources. This subject is\nimportant for understanding the work of Ibn Tibbon and the process of\ncreating a philosophical culture in Hebrew.  Translating philosophy,\nmoreover, is a philosophical subject in its own right. \n\n1. Editing the text, comparing manuscripts \n\nThe first order of business in translating a text is the preparation\nof a reliable edition. Thus Ibn Tibbon, as critical scholar, made\nevery effort to collect and compare manuscripts of the texts on which\nhe worked. For example, in a brief introduction to his “Letter\non Providence,” he describes his efforts to eliminate\ncorruptions in his manuscript of the Guide by acquiring\nadditional copies and comparing them to his Vorlage. In the preface to\nthe Meteorology, similarly, he indicates that he had\nconsulted manuscripts of Aristotle’s work in Toledo and Barcelona, and\nhad studied the commentaries by Alexander, Avicenna, and Averroes, in\norder to help construct a more reliable text closer to the\noriginal. \n\n2. Consulting Arabic dictionaries \n\nIn the preface to the translation of the Guide, Ibn Tibbon\nexplains that, when confronted with difficult terms, he would consult\nArabic dictionaries. He does not say which dictionaries he consulted,\nbut a report by Todros Todrosi, in the preface to his\nfourteenth-century translation of Averroes’ Middle Commentary on\nAristotle’s Rhetoric (ed. J. Goldenthal, Leipzig, 1842,\np. 3), provides an exact reference: al-Khalil b. Ahmad’s\nKitab al-‘ayn. Todrosi’s report reads as\nfollows: \n\n3. Consulting previous translations \n\nIn the preface to the translation of the Guide, Ibn Tibbon\nexplains that, in his translation of Maimonides, he had consulted\nprevious translations, rendered by his father and by others. Moreover,\nhe explains that, when a term already exists, he will follow\nestablished convention, even when he disagrees. One example of this\nambivalent deference to tradition is his definition of\n“logic” in the glossary. The text (from Perush\nha-Millot ha-Zarot, ed. Even-Shemuel, pp. 43-4; corrected by\nHebrew MS London 904, 164b) reads as follows: \n\n4. The use of Saadia’s Tafsir \n\nAnother important source of Ibn Tibbon’s translations is the\nArabic translation of the Bible by Saadia Gaon. This presented a ready\nlexicon of sorts for the translator: he could identify the Arabic term\nin Saadia’s Tafsir and replace it with the biblical term it\ntranslated. One example of Ibn Tibbon doing exactly this is found in\nhis glossary, in his discussion of the terms “definition”\nand “description.” His discussion, as found in the\nmanuscript versions (see Perush ha-Millot ha-Zarot, ed.\nEven-Shemuel, pp. 24-5, corrected by Hebrew MS London 904, 161b), is\nas follows: \n\n5. Consultations with the author \n\nWhen all else failed—after consulting dictionaries and previous\ntranslations—Ibn Tibbon addressed his queries to the author\nhimself.  In fact, there is evidence that Ibn Tibbon wrote at least\nthree letters to Maimonides regarding translation and interpretation,\nand that he received at least two letters in response. But only Ibn\nTibbon’s “Letter on Providence” (which was mentioned\nbriefly above), and Maimonides’ “Letter on\nTranslation” survive.  Notable about the latter is that, despite\nIbn Tibbon’s efforts to consult with Maimonides, he generally\nignored the latter’s advice, and continued to follow the\ntranslation terminology and traditions of his father. \n\n6. Coining new terms \n\nOne of Ibn Tibbon’s most interesting discussions of translation\nis found in his preface to the glossary. There he lists and discusses\nsix types of “strange” or “foreign” terms used\nin his translation of the Guide: neologisms, rare words or\nphrases, derived terms, homonyms, terms created through calque, and\nnew compound expressions. In the preface to the commentary on\nEcclesiastes, he then provides a rare description of how he actually\ncoined a new term through calque. This description reads as\nfollows: \n\n7. Defense of translation \n\nAfter completing the first version of the Guide, Judah\nal-Harizi produced a rival translation, apparently at the request of\nsome sages from southern France. al-Harizi’s translation was\nwritten elegantly and in Biblical Hebrew; its goal was to be readable\nand accessible. Ibn Tibbon issued his revised translation, with\nglossary, in response to this challenge. Thus in the preface to the\nglossary he focuses on defending his own work and undermining the work\nof his rival. He exposes al-Harizi’s ignorance of philosophy and\nhighlights his own mastery of the subject matter of the Guide\nand sensitivity to the difficulties of translation. \n\nIn the preface to the commentary on Ecclesiastes, Ibn Tibbon also\nseems to provide explanation why the literal translation of\nphilosophical texts is superior. There he emphasizes the importance of\nword order in the construction of meaning. Drawing from the rhetorical\ntradition of “delivery,” he likens a written text to a\nspeech: it uses certain literary devices to imitate gesture, voice,\nand facial expression. The text, describing the method of transmitting\nwisdom through “chapter headings,” reads as follows: \n\nIbn Tibbon proceeds to discuss the ways to do this in a written\ntext, using rhetorical and poetic devices. The implication for\ntranslation is as follows: any change in the form of a text will have\nserious impact on its meaning. \n\nAl-Harizi was right about one thing: that Ibn Tibbon’s literal\ntranslations are difficult to read. But even if they were elegant and\naccessible, reading the Guide, and other translated texts,\nwould require background in philosophy. This Ibn Tibbon recognized.\nThus he did far more than simply producing literal translations; he\nalso initiated the creation of a cognate literature in Hebrew:\nphilosophical reference works and study aids. He produced the first\nmajor lexicon of philosophical Hebrew; and he included explanatory\nglosses in the margins of his translation of the Guide, which\nestablished the foundation for a proper commentary tradition. A brief\ndiscussion of the glossary will be given here. \n\nThe philosophical glossary or lexicon is, in fact, a very old genre.\nThe tradition of defining key terms was developed already in late\nantiquity, and continued into the Middle Ages. For example, al-Kindi,\nAvicenna, and Isaac Israeli all wrote books of definitions. \n\nIbn Tibbon’s Perush ha-Millot ha-Zarot was the first\nmajor philosophical lexicon written in Hebrew. It was written not as a\ngeneral introduction to philosophy, like the work of his predecessors,\nbut as a glossary to one translated text: Maimonides’ Guide\nof the Perplexed. In fact, however, it is much more. It includes\nextended discussions of key terms, and works as both glossary and\nlexicon, introduction and primer. Many philosophical ideas appear in\nHebrew for the first time in the glossary; and there is evidence that\nthe text itself was studied independently, as a general reference work\nor study aid. \n\nIn order to illustrate its character, I’ll present here four\nentries from the glossary: rhetorical statement, natural science (or\nphysics), divine science (or metaphysics), and mathematics. With these\nfour entries, Ibn Tibbon introduced his Hebrew reader to the entire\nAristotelian curriculum as it had developed in the Arabic world\n(including pseudo-Aristotelian works). \n\n1. Rhetorical Statement [Ma’amar Haggadi]: \n\n2. Natural Science (Physics): \n\n3. Divine Science (Metaphysics): \n\n4. Mathematics: \n\nIbn Tibbon wrote two main original works: A commentary on Ecclesiastes\nand a philosophical-exegetical monograph entitled Ma’amar\nYiqqawu ha-Mayim. He also wrote introductions to his\ntranslations, letters to Maimonides, and a short treatise on the\n“Reason for the Table and Shewbread.” In addition to these\nworks, which are extant, he planned two other commentaries as well,\nwhich were never completed: A commentary on the internal meanings of\nProverbs and an esoteric commentary on Genesis, entitled Ner\nha-Hofes (see Prov 20:27). \n\nWhat is the character of these writings? Although they are diverse\nin form and content, they all share two main characteristics: they\ndiscuss philosophical ideas in the form of biblical exegesis; and they\nbuild upon discussions of verses and rabbinic dicta found in the\nGuide and borrow and apply methods developed by the\nGuide. Any discussion of Ibn Tibbon, therefore, needs to work\nthrough a complex philosophical-exegetical process: from the Bible,\nto rabbinic literature, to Maimonides; and from Maimonides, through\nrabbinic literature, to the Bible. \n\nWhy did Ibn Tibbon write his philosophy in this way? Why didn’t he\nwrite straightforward philosophical or theological summas or\ncommentaries on philosophical works by Aristotle or Averroes?  In the\nthirteenth century, much of the philosophical activity in the Jewish\ncommunities was focused not on general synthesis but on translation,\ntransmission, defense, and propagation; and teaching philosophy within\nthe framework of traditional literature was a very effective way of\nspreading the ideas of philosophy. In particular, teaching philosophy\nthrough Bible (or rabbinic literature) helped make foreign ideas more\nfamiliar and helped justify the study of philosophy by connecting it\nwith authoritative exemplars. Most important, it created a safe place\nfor the doing of philosophy itself; for through a peculiar process of\ncanonization, beginning with Maimonides and continuing with his\ndisciples, specific biblical verses or stories became the standard\nloci for the discussion of philosophical ideas or problems. The\nbiblical texts would stay the same, but the philosophical ideas would\nchange, in light of the novel ideas of a particular exegete or school\nof thought. \n\nIn order to give a sense of Ibn Tibbon’s philosophical exegesis,\nI’ll briefly describe his original writings, then single out a\nfew specific examples relating to a single problem: the final aim of\nhuman existence. \n\n1. The Preface to the translation of Maimonides, Commentary on\nAvot\n\nIn the preface to this translation, Ibn Tibbon presents a full and\ndetailed explication of Jeremiah 9:22–23. He explains and criticizes\nMaimonides’ explanation of these verses in Guide 3:54\nand offers his own novel interpretation, according to which the final\naim of man is knowledge and understanding of God, and nothing more\n(see further discussion below). \n\n2. The Commentary on Ecclesiastes\n\nIt seems that this was Ibn Tibbon’s first major exegetical work;\nit was likely completed sometime between 1213 and 1221. The commentary\nis a large and digressive work, including a long preface, a\nverse-by-verse commentary, and several digressions, in which Ibn\nTibbon introduces a philosophical subject or explains a related verse\nin Genesis, Jeremiah, Psalms, Proverbs, or the Song of Songs. The\nphilosophical digressions are mainly related to logic, astronomy,\nmeteorology, generation and corruption, celestial influence on the\nsublunar world, and the soul and its faculties. \n\nIbn Tibbon’s understanding of Ecclesiastes as a whole is as follows:\nSolomon wrote the book in his youth in order to refute ancient\nskeptics who denied the possibility of immortality (“conjunction\nwith the active intellect”). This he did by carefully examining\nthe arguments against immortality in order to show that they are not\n“complete” or “cogent” or\n“decisive.” The three arguments he refutes are the\nfollowing: that human intellect is intellect in matter, and therefore\ncannot become separate from matter or contemplate separate substances;\nthat the intellect, even though it derives from an incorporeal giver\nof forms, still requires a corporeal substrate; that ethics is a first\nrather than final perfection, and cannot save the human being from\ndeath and destruction. \n\n3. Ma’amar Yiqqawu ha-Mayim\n\nThe title of this work might be translated as: “Treatise on [the\nVerse]: Let the waters be gathered (Gen 1:9)” or: “The\n[Divine] Saying: Let the waters be gathered (Gen 1:9)”. It was\ncompleted after the commentary on Ecclesiastes, possibly in 1221 or\n1231. Like the commentary on Ecclesiastes, it is digressive and\nexegetical, although in general it follows the order of Guide of\nthe Perplexed, part III. Ibn Tibbon begins this work with a\ncosmological question—why is the earth not covered entirely by\nwater—and then proceeds to answer this and related questions in\nrelation to verses from Genesis, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Job, and especially\nthe Book of Psalms. \n\n4. “The Reason for the Table and Shewbread”\n\nThis short treatise was occasioned by a statement in Guide of the\nPerplexed 3:45. There Maimonides says that, although he can\nexplain most aspects of the sacrificial cult, he cannot explain the\nreason for the table and shewbread. Ibn Tibbon thus takes up this\nchallenge from the Master. He explains that the table and shewbread,\nand the very sensuous sacrificial cult in general, serves as a lesson\nin theology. In particular, the gross anthropomorphic representations,\nin Ibn Tibbon’s opinion, expose the absurdity of conceiving God as a\nbody, with all the body’s concomitant needs and relations. In other\nwords, the temple and tabernacle, working as a reductio ad absurdum of\nsorts, helped to spread the true belief in monotheism. \n\n5. Commentary on the Internal Meanings of Proverbs\n\nIn the commentary on Ecclesiastes, Ibn Tibbon says that he planned a\ncommentary on the internal meanings of Proverbs. Although this\ncommentary was never written, it is possible that preliminary\ndiscussions were incorporated into his other writings. Thus in the\ncommentary on Ecclesiastes, Ibn Tibbon presents a full and detailed\nverse-by-verse explication of Prov 1:1-7 and 8:22-36. The former he\nexplains as a prooemium, following the philosophical tradition of\nwriting prefaces: Solomon introduces the title of the work, the name\nof the author, the method of presentation, etc. The latter verses he\nexplains in relation to the possibility of repentance: of sinning,\nrepenting, and returning to the Garden of Eden. \n\n6. Ner ha-Hofes: An Esoteric Commentary on Genesis\n\nIn Ma’amar Yiqqawu ha-Mayim, Ibn Tibbon refers several\ntimes to this book, which he says is a work in progress. It was never\ncompleted, but as with the commentary on Proverbs, it is possible that\npreliminary notes and explanations can be found in his other writings.\nThus, for example, the commentary on Ecclesiastes includes several\ndetailed explications of verses from Genesis, including 1:11, 1:14,\n1:20, 1:26, 3:22–24, 8:21–22. Ma’amar Yiqqawu\nha-Mayim, moreover, includes one chapter devoted to Gen 28\n(Jacob’s ladder), one to Gen 11 (the tower of Babel), and discussion\nthroughout regarding Gen 1 and the “account of the\nbeginning.” \n\nThroughout Ibn Tibbon’s writings, he returns time and again to a\nfew key problems: divine providence, the possibility of immortality,\nand the final aim of human existence. These subjects were particularly\nvexing: Maimonides had discussed them, but did not provide a consistent\ndoctrine; al-Farabi had famously denied that conjunction is possible;\nwhile Averroes took up the question of immortality in several works\nwith differing results. Ibn Tibbon, for his part, worked with the\nbiblical texts singled out by Maimonides, but developed ideas drawn\nfrom al-Farabi and Averroes. His discussion of three biblical texts,\nall relating to the final aim of human existence, are especially\nimportant. His interpretations will be presented here in relation to\nthose of Maimonides. \n\n1. Genesis 28:12–13 \n\nIn the preface to the Guide of the Perplexed, Maimonides\nsingles out Jacob’s vision of the ladder in Gen 28 as a paradigmatic\nexample of the biblical allegory; he isolates seven key terms in the\nstory, which he decodes, in two different ways, in later chapters of\nthe Guide. Thus the angels ascending and descending the\nladder are explained in Guide 1:15 as prophets; they ascend\nthrough study and descend, with divine wisdom in hand, to govern the\npeople. In Guide 2:10, in contrast, the vision is explained\nin relation to cosmology rather than politics and prophecy. The ladder\nis set up on the earth and extends into the celestial realm, the rungs\non the ladder are the four elements or seven celestial bodies, and the\nangels ascending and descending are the celestial intelligences. The\nLord, standing firmly at the top of the ladder, is God as first cause\nor prime mover. \n\nIbn Tibbon was the first philosopher-exegete to build upon Maimonides’\napproach and to move it in new directions, which were more consistent\nwith his own particular interests. Thus in Ma’amar Yiqqawu\nha-Mayim, chapter 11, he emphasized the epistemological and\ncosmological and eliminated the political.  According to his\ninterpretation, the angels ascending are the philosophers, who ascend\nthe ladder of wisdom toward metaphysics, the final subject of the\ncurriculum. Who then are the angels that descend?  They are not the\nprophets, descending with wisdom to rule the people, but separate\nintelligences, which descend to help the human intellect reach its\nfinal perfection: knowledge of and conjunction with God. \n2. Jeremiah 9:22–23 \n\nIn Guide 3:54, Maimonides presents a brief discussion of the\npurpose of human existence. Building upon Aristotelian treatments of\nthis problem, he presents four possible human ends: perfection in\nwealth, health, ethics, and intellect. He then introduces a biblical\ntext, Jeremiah 9:22–23, which he says presents the same ideas of the\nphilosophers, but with one important addition. Namely, like the\nphilosophers, Jeremiah also singles out four possible\nperfections—“might,” “riches,” ethical\n“wisdom,” and “understanding and\nknowledge”—but he adds something more as well:\n“exercising lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the\nearth.” Thus knowledge of God, Maimonides seems to suggest,\nshould lead to action; the contemplative should serve a practical\nend. \n\nIn the preface to the translation of Maimonides on Avot, as well as in\nthe commentary on Ecclesiastes, Ibn Tibbon discusses these same verses\nfrom Jeremiah in detail, explains and criticizes Maimonides’\ninterpretation of them, then presents his own novel\nexplication. According to Ibn Tibbon, the final human perfection is\nknowledge and understanding of God, without qualification. Thus the\nverse should be understood differently, with the final clause relating\nto God rather than man; man should understand and know God, full\nstop. \n\n3. Song of Songs 5:2 \n\nIn Guide 3:51, Maimonides cites Song of Songs 5:2 in the\ncourse of his discussion of the patriarchs and Moses. These figures,\nhe says, reached the highest level of human perfection, for they were\nin constant communion with God and also fully involved in the creation\nand governance of a religious community. They were like the\nprotagonist of Song of Songs, with heart awake even while asleep. \n\nWhat was Ibn Tibbon’s understanding of the same subject? How did he\nbuild on and respond to Maimonides’ use of the verse? As in the\nprevious two examples, Ibn Tibbon cites and discusses Guide\n3:51, but suggests a different approach. As he explains in the\ncommentary on Ecclesiastes, the patriarchs and Moses did achieve this\nstate of philosophy and politics, precisely as Maimonides had\ndescribed it; they were asleep (in the world of matter) with heart\nawake (toward the world of God). But in Ibn Tibbon’s opinion, although\nthis state is worthy of praise, they could have reached a higher state\nstill: they could have been completely awake, engaged in a life of\npure contemplation, free from the hindrances of the physical and\npolitical world. \n\nIn all three of these examples, Ibn Tibbon emphasizes the\ncontemplative over the practical. He works with the same biblical\ntexts singled out by Maimonides, but arrives at a different\nphilosophical position. It is precisely this interesting\nphilosophical-exegetical give and take, the free discussion of ideas\nwithin a fixed biblical framework, that characterized the Maimonidean\ntradition of philosophy and exegesis, which was founded by Ibn Tibbon\nand continued by his descendents, disciples, and admirers.","contact.mail":"jtr@uchicago.edu","contact.domain":"uchicago.edu"}]
