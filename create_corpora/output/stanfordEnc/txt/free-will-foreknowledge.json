Theological fatalism is the thesis that infallible\nforeknowledge of a human act makes the act necessary and hence unfree.\nIf there is a being who knows the entire future infallibly, then no\nhuman act is free.\n\n\n\nFatalism seems to be entailed by infallible foreknowledge by the\nfollowing informal line of reasoning:\n\nFor any future act you will perform, if some being\ninfallibly believed in the past that the act would occur, there is\nnothing you can do now about the fact that he believed what he\nbelieved since nobody has any control over past events; nor can you\nmake him mistaken in his belief, given that he is\ninfallible. Therefore, there is nothing you can do now about the fact\nthat he believed in a way that cannot be mistaken that you would do\nwhat you will do. But if so, you cannot do otherwise than what he\nbelieved you would do. And if you cannot do otherwise, you will not\nperform the act freely.\n\n\n\nThe same argument can be applied to any infallibly foreknown act of\nany human being. If there is a being who infallibly knows everything\nthat will happen in the future, no human being has any control over\nthe future.\n\n\n\nThis theological fatalist argument creates a dilemma because\nmany people have thought it important to maintain both (1) there is a\ndeity who infallibly knows the entire future, and (2) human beings\nhave free will in the strong sense usually called libertarian.  But\nthe theological fatalist argument seems to show that (1) and (2) are\nincompatible; the only way consistently to accept (2) is to deny\n(1). Those philosophers who think there is a way to consistently\nmaintain both (1) and (2) are called compatibilists about infallible\nforeknowledge and human free will. Compatibilists must either identify\na false premise in the argument for theological fatalism or show that\nthe conclusion does not follow from the premises. Incompatibilists\naccept the incompatibility of infallible foreknowledge and human free\nwill and deny either infallible foreknowledge or free will in the\nsense targeted by the argument.\n\n\n\nThere is a long history of debate over the soundness of the argument\nfor theological fatalism, so its soundness must not be obvious. Nelson\nPike (1965) gets the credit for clearly and forcefully presenting the\ndilemma in a way that produced an enormous body of work by both\ncompatibilists and incompatibilists, leading to more careful\nformulations of the argument. \nA precise version of the argument can be formulated as follows: Choose\nsome proposition about a future act that you think you will do freely,\nif any act is free. Suppose, for example, that the telephone will ring\nat 9 am tomorrow and you will either answer it or you will not. So it\nis either true that you will answer the phone at 9 am tomorrow or it\nis true that you will not answer the phone at 9 am tomorrow. The Law\nof Excluded Middle rules out any other alternative. Let T\nabbreviate the proposition that you will answer the phone tomorrow at\n9, and let us suppose that\nT is true. (If not-T is true instead, simply\nsubstitute not-T in the argument below). \n\nLet “now-necessary” designate temporal necessity, the type of\nnecessity that the past is supposed to have just because it is\npast. We will discuss this type of necessity in sections\n 2.3\nand\n 2.6,\n but we can begin with the intuitive idea that there is a kind of\nnecessity that a proposition has now when the content of the\nproposition is about something that occurred in the past. To say that\nit is now-necessary that milk has been spilled is to say nobody can do\nanything now about the fact that the milk has been spilled. \n\nLet “God” designate a being who has infallible beliefs about the\nfuture, where to say that God believes p infallibly is to say\nthat God believes p and it is not possible that God believes\np and p is false. It is not important for the logic\nof the argument that God is the being worshiped by any particular\nreligion, but the motive to maintain that there is a being with\ninfallible beliefs is usually a religious one. \n\nOne more preliminary point is in order. The dilemma of infallible\nforeknowledge and human free will does not rest on the particular\nassumption of foreknowledge and does not require an analysis\nof knowledge. Most contemporary accounts of knowledge are fallibilist,\nwhich means they do not require that a person believe in a way that\ncannot be mistaken in order to have knowledge. She has knowledge just\nin case what she believes is true and she satisfies the other\nconditions for knowledge, such as having sufficiently strong evidence.\nOrdinary knowledge does not require that the belief cannot be\nfalse. For example, if I believe on strong evidence that classes begin\nat my university on a certain date, and when the day arrives, classes\ndo begin, we would normally say I knew in advance that classes would\nbegin on that date. I had foreknowledge about the date classes begin.\nBut there is nothing problematic about that kind of foreknowledge\nbecause events could have proven me wrong even though as\nevents actually turned out, they didn’t prove me wrong.\nOrdinary foreknowledge does not threaten to necessitate the future\nbecause it does not require that when I know p it is not possible that\nmy belief is false. The key problem, then, is the infallibility of the\nbelief about the future, and this is a problem whether or not the\nepistemic agent with an infallible belief satisfies the other\nconditions required by some account of knowledge, such as sufficient\nevidence. As long as an agent has an infallible belief about the\nfuture, the problem arises. \n\nUsing the example of the proposition T, the argument that\ninfallible foreknowledge of T entails that you do not answer\nthe telephone freely can be formulated as follows: \n\nThis argument is formulated in a way that makes its logical form as\nperspicuous as possible, and there is a consensus that this argument\nor something close to it is valid. That is, if the premises are all\ntrue, the conclusion follows. The compatibilist about infallible\nforeknowledge and free will must therefore find a false premise. There\nare four premises that are not straightforward substitutions in\ndefinitions: (1), (2), (5), and (9). Premises (1) and (2) have been\nattacked in influential ways in the history of discussion of\ntheological fatalism. Boethius and Aquinas denied premise (1) on the\ngrounds that God and his beliefs are not in time, a solution that has\nalways had some adherents. William of Ockham denied premise (2) on the\ngrounds that the necessity of the past does not apply to the entire\npast, and God’s past beliefs are in the part of the past to\nwhich the necessity of the past does not apply. This solution also has\nsome contemporary adherents. Premise (9) has been attacked by a few\ncontemporary philosophers who argue that the denial of (9) is\nconsistent with maintaining that human beings have libertarian free\nwill, the kind of free will that is incompatible with causal\ndeterminism (Zagzebski, 1991). It has been proposed that Augustine had\na form of this solution (Hunt 1999), although it was not attributed to\nhim historically. The denial of (9) is mostly due to contemporary\ndiscussions of the relation between free will and the ability to do\notherwise. Premise (5) has rarely been disputed and is an analogue of\nan axiom of modal logic. However, it might have been denied by Luis de\nMolina (Freddoso 1988, 57–58), and it has been denied in some of\nthe recent literature. Finally, we will consider the possibility that\npremise (2) can be rejected in a more radical way than the Ockhamist\nposition. In addition to the foregoing compatibilist solutions, there\nare two incompatibilist responses to the problem of theological\nfatalism. One is to deny that God (or any being) has infallible\nforeknowledge. The other is to deny that human beings have free will\nin the libertarian sense of free will. These responses will be\ndiscussed in section\n 3.\n The relationship between theological fatalism and logical fatalism will be discussed in section\n 4.\n In section\n 5\n we will look at the problem of fatalism as a special case of a more\ngeneral problem in the metaphysics of time that has nothing to do with\nfree will. \n\nOne response to the dilemma of infallible foreknowledge and free will\nis to deny that the proposition T has a truth value because\nno proposition about the contingent future has a truth value. This\nresponse rejects the terms in which the problem is set up. The idea\nbehind this response is usually that propositions about the contingent\nfuture become true when and only when the event occurs that the\nproposition is about. If the event does not occur at that time, then\nthe proposition becomes false. This seems to have been the position of\nAristotle in the famous Sea Battle argument of De\nInterpretatione IX, where Aristotle is concerned with the\nimplications of the truth of a proposition about the future, not the\nproblem of infallible knowledge of the future. But some philosophers\nhave used Aristotle’s move to solve the dilemma we are\naddressing here.  In the recent literature this position has been\ndefended by J.R. Lucas (1989), Richard Purtill (1988), and Joseph\nRunzo (1981).  More recently D.K. Johnson (2009) has taken up this\nsolution to both logical and theological fatalism, relating this\nsolution to presentism, the position that only the present exists. The\nconnection between this solution and “open theism” will be\ndiscussed in section 3.  \n\nThis solution collapses truth into necessity and falsehood into\nimpossibility, at least for propositions about the future. That may be\nsufficient to make it implausible to some logicians, but it is not\nclear that this move avoids the problem of theological fatalism\nanyway.  According to the definition of infallibility used in the\nbasic argument, if God is infallible in all his beliefs, then it is\nnot possible that God believes T and T is false. But\nthere is a natural extension of the definition of infallibility to\nallow for the case in which T lacks a truth value but will\nacquire one in the future: If God is infallible in all his beliefs,\nthen it is not possible that God believes T and T is\neither false or becomes false. If so, and if God believes T,\nwe get an argument for theological fatalism that parallels our basic\nargument. Premise (4) would need to be modified as follows: \n(6) becomes: \nThe modifications in the rest of the argument are\nstraightforward. \nIt is open to the defender of this solution to maintain that God has\nno beliefs about the contingent future because he does not infallibly\nknow how it will turn out, and this is compatible with God’s being\ninfallible in everything he does believe. It is also compatible with\nGod’s omniscience if omniscience is the property of knowing the truth\nvalue of every proposition that has a truth value. But clearly, this\nmove restricts the range of God’s knowledge, so it has religious\ndisadvantages in addition to its disadvantages in logic. \n\nThis solution denies the first premise of the basic argument: (1)\nYesterday God infallibly believed T. What is denied according\nto this solution is not that God believes infallibly, and not that God\nbelieves the content of proposition T, but that God believed\nT yesterday. This solution probably originated with\nthe 6th century philosopher Boethius, who maintained that\nGod is not in time and has no temporal properties, so God does not\nhave beliefs at a time. It is therefore a mistake to say God had\nbeliefs yesterday, or has beliefs today, or will have beliefs\ntomorrow. It is also a mistake to say God had a belief on a certain\ndate, such as June 1, 2004. The way Boethius describes God’s cognitive\ngrasp of temporal reality, all temporal events are before the mind of\nGod at once. To say “at once” or\n“simultaneously” is to use a temporal metaphor, but\nBoethius is clear that it does not make sense to think of the whole of\ntemporal reality as being before God’s mind in a\nsingle temporal present. It is an atemporal present in which God has a single\ncomplete grasp of all events in the entire span of time. \n\nAquinas adopted the Boethian solution as one of his ways out of\ntheological fatalism, using some of the same metaphors as\nBoethius. One is the circle analogy, in which the way a timeless God\nis present to each and every moment of time is compared to the way in\nwhich the center of a circle is present to each and every point on its\ncircumference (SCG I, 66). In contemporary philosophy an important\ndefense of the Boethian idea that God is timeless was given by\nEleonore Stump and Norman Kretzmann (1981), who applied it explicitly\nto the foreknowledge dilemma (1991). Recently it has been defended by\nKatherin Rogers (2007a) (2007b), Kevin Timpe (2007) Michael Rota\n(2010), Joseph Diekemper (2013), and Ciro De Florio (2015). \n\nMost objections to the timelessness solution to the dilemma of\nforeknowledge and freedom focus on the idea of timelessness itself,\narguing either that it does not make sense or that it is incompatible\nwith other properties of God that are religiously more compelling,\nsuch as personhood (e.g., Pike 1970, 121–129; Wolterstorff 1975;\nSwinburne 1977, 221). Zagzebski has argued (1991, chap. 2 and 2011)\nthat the timelessness move does not avoid the problem of theological\nfatalism since an argument structurally parallel to the basic argument\ncan be formulated for timeless knowledge. If God is not in time, the\nkey issue would not be the necessity of the past, but the necessity of\nthe timeless realm. So the first three steps of the argument would be\nreformulated as follows: \n\nPerhaps it is inappropriate to say that timeless events such as God’s\ntimeless knowing are now-necessary, yet we have no more\nreason to think we can do anything about God’s timeless knowing than\nabout God’s past knowing. The timeless realm is as much out of our\nreach as the past. So the point of (3t) is that we cannot now do\nanything about the fact that God timelessly knows T. The rest\nof the steps in the timeless dilemma argument are parallel to the\nbasic argument. Step (5t) says that if there is nothing we can do\nabout a timeless state, there is nothing we can do about what such a\nstate entails. It follows that we cannot do anything about the\nfuture. \n\nThe Boethian solution does not solve the problem of theological\nfatalism by itself, but since the nature of the timeless realm is\nelusive, the intuition of the necessity of the timeless realm is\nprobably weaker than the intuition of the necessity of the past. The\nnecessity of the past is deeply embedded in our ordinary intuitions\nabout time; there are no ordinary intuitions about the realm of\ntimelessness. One possible way out of this problem is given by\nK.A. Rogers, who argues (2007a, 2007b) that the eternal realm is like\nthe present rather than the past, and so it does not have the\nnecessity we attribute to the past.  \nAn interesting puzzle for Christian defenders of the Boethian solution\nis the problem of whether the knowledge of Jesus Christ during his\ntime on earth was infallible. The problem here is that the incarnate\nChrist was in time even if God is timeless. A particular problem\ndiscussed by Timothy Pawl (2014a, 2014b) is whether Christ had\ninfallible foreknowledge of his own future choices, and if so, whether\nhis created will was free. Pawl defends the compatibility of\nChrist’s infallible foreknowledge and the freedom of his created\nwill. \n\nThe next solution is due to the thirteenth century philosopher William\nof Ockham, and was revived in the contemporary literature by Marilyn\nAdams (1967). \n\nThis solution rejects premise (2) of the basic argument in its full\ngenerality. Following Ockham, Adams argues that premise (2) applies\nonly to the past strictly speaking, or the “hard” past. A\n“soft” fact about the past is one that is in part about\nthe future. An example of a soft fact about the past would be the fact\nthat it was true yesterday that a certain event would occur a year\nlater. Adams argues that God’s existence in the past and God’s past\nbeliefs about the future are not strictly past because they are facts\nthat are in part about the future. \n\nAdams’s argument was unsuccessful since, among other things, her\ncriterion for being a hard fact had the consequence that no fact is a\nhard fact (Fischer 1989, introduction), but it led to a series of\nattempts to bolster it by giving more refined definitions of a\n“hard fact” and the type of necessity such facts are said\nto have—what Ockham called “accidental necessity”\n(necessity per accidens). Recent discussions of the hard\nfact/soft fact distinction appear in Todd (2013) and Pendergraft and\nCoates (2014). \nOne of the best-known Ockhamist\nproposals after Adams was made by Alvin Plantinga (1986), who defined\nthe accidentally necessary in terms of lack of counterfactual power.\nFor someone, Jones, to have counterfactual power over God’s past\nbeliefs, the following must be true: \n\nPlantinga argued that counterfactual power over God’s past beliefs\nabout human free choices is coherent and if it occurs, these beliefs\nare not accidentally necessary; they do not have the kind of necessity\nthe past is alleged to have in premise (2) of the basic argument. \n\nNotice that counterfactual power over the past is not the same thing\nas changing the past. Under the assumption that there is only one time\nline, changing the past is incoherent since it amounts to there being\none past prior to t2 in which God has a certain\nbelief at t1, and then Jones does something to\nmake a different past. That requires two pasts prior to\nt2, and that presumably makes no sense. What (CPP)\naffirms instead is that there is only one actual past, but there would\nhave been a different past if Jones acted differently at\nt2. (CPP) also does not require the assumption\nthat what Jones does at t2 causes God to have the\nbelief he has at t1. There is much debate about\nthe way to analyze the causal relation, but it is generally thought\nthat causation does not reduce to a counterfactual dependency of an\neffect on its cause. The dependency of God’s belief on\nJones’ act need not be a causal dependency. (CPP) is therefore\nweaker than the claim that Jones’ act at\nt2 causes God’s belief\nat t1. A discussion of the counterfactual\ndependence of God’s past belief on human future acts is given in\nZagzebski (1991, chap 4).  \n\nThere was considerable debate over Ockhamism in the eighties and\nnineties. Some of the defenses in this period appear in Freddoso\n(1983), Kvanvig (1986), Zemach and Widerker (1987), Wierenga (1989),\nand Craig (1990).  Some of the criticisms appear in Fischer (1983b,\n1985b), Hasker (1989), Zagzebski (1991), Pike (1993), and Brant\n(1997). \nRecently the idea that God’s past beliefs depend upon our future\nfree acts was enlivened by Trenton Merricks (2009), who argues that\nthe idea appears in Molina (see section 2.4). Fischer and Todd (2011)\nargue that Merricks’ solution is a form of Ockhamism, and\nMerricks (2011) replies that the dependency relation between\nGod’s past beliefs and human acts is not the same as\nOckham’s strategy. The Ockhamist solution is intertwined with\nwork on the reality of the past and future. Finch and Rea (2008) have\nargued that the Ockhamist solution requires the rejection of\npresentism, the view that only the present is real.  \nIt seems to me that it is very difficult to give an account of the\nnecessity of the past that preserves the intuition that the past has a\nspecial kind of necessity in virtue of being past, but which has the\nconsequence that God’s past beliefs do not have that kind of\nnecessity.  The problem is that God’s past beliefs seem to be as good\na candidate for something that is strictly past as almost anything we\ncan think of, such as an explosion that occurred last week. If we have\ncounterfactual power over God’s past beliefs, but not the past\nexplosion, that must be because of something special about God’s past\nbeliefs that is intuitively plausible apart from the attempt to avoid\ntheological fatalism. If it is not independently plausible, it is hard\nto avoid the conclusion that the Ockhamist solution is ad\nhoc. \n\nThe doctrine of Middle Knowledge was vehemently debated in the\n16th century, with the version of Luis de Molina getting\nthe most attention in the contemporary literature. Recently the\ndoctrine has received strong support by Thomas Flint (1998) and Eef\nDekker (2000). Unlike the other compatibilist solutions we are\nconsidering, which aim only at showing that infallible foreknowledge\nand human freedom are compatible, Molinism provides an account of\nhow God knows the contingent future, along with a strong\ndoctrine of divine providence. Middle knowledge is called “middle”\nbecause it is said to stand between God’s knowledge of necessary\ntruths and his knowledge of his own creative will. The objects of\nMiddle Knowledge are so-called counterfactuals of freedom: \nIf person S were in circumstances C,\nS would freely do X. \n\nMiddle knowledge requires that there are true counterfactuals of this\nform corresponding to every possible free creature and every possible\ncircumstance in which that creature can act freely. These propositions\nare intended to be contingent (a claim that has been disputed by some\nobjectors), but they are prior to God’s creative will.  God uses them\nin deciding what to create. By combining his Middle Knowledge with\nwhat he decides to create, God knows the entire history of the\nworld. \n\nThere are a number of objections to Middle Knowledge in the\ncontemporary literature. Robert Adams (1991) argues that Molinism is\ncommitted to the position that the truth of a counterfactual of\nfreedom is explanatorily prior to God’s decision to create us. But the\ntruth of a counterfactual to the effect that if I were in circumstance\nC I would do A is strictly inconsistent with my\nrefraining from A in C, and so my refraining from\nA in C is precluded by something prior in the order\nof explanation to my act in C. And that is inconsistent with\nmy acting freely in C. \n\nThere are a number of other objections to Middle Knowledge in the\nliterature, as well as replies by its defenders. William Hasker (1989,\n1995, 1997, 2000) has offered a series of objections and replies to\nWilliam Craig, who defends Middle Knowledge (1994, 1998). Other\nobjections have been proposed by Walls (1990) and Gaskin (1993).\nRecent critical discussions of Molinism appear in Fischer (2008),\nGuleserian (2008), and False (2010). Defenses of Molinism appears in\nKanzian (2011) and Kosciuk (2010) and a critique in Shieber\n(2009). Perszyk (2011) is a collection of essays examining Molinism\nand its future direction. Perszyk (2013) is a survey of the recent\nliterature.  \n\nLet us assume that the doctrine of Middle Knowledge is defensible.\nHow does that avoid the conclusion of the argument for theological\nfatalism? Middle Knowledge does not entail the falsehood of any\npremise of the basic argument. Flint (1998) rejects some of the steps\nof the fatalist argument in addition to defending Middle Knowledge,\nand more recently blends of Ockhamism and Molinism have been defended\n(Kosciuk 2010), which suggests that even though the theory of Middle\nKnowledge is a powerful theory of divine knowledge and providence, it\nis neither necessary nor sufficient to avoid theological fatalism by\nitself. \n\nLet us now look at premise (9). This is a form of the Principle of\nAlternate Possibilities (PAP), a principle that has become well-known\nin the literature on free will ever since it was attacked by Harry\nFrankfurt (1969) in some interesting thought experiments. The point of\nFrankfurt’s paper was to drive a wedge between responsibility\nand alternate possibilities, and to thereby drive a wedge between\nresponsibility and libertarian freedom. In general, those defending\nlibertarian freedom also defend PAP, and those attacking PAP, like\nFrankfurt, defend determinism, but some philosophers have argued that\nPAP is false even if we have libertarian free will. Such arguments\nhave been given by Zagzebski (1991) and Hunt (1999). Hunt (1996b,\n1999) argues that the rejection of PAP from the perspective of a\ndefender of libertarian freedom can be found in Augustine, although it\nis not a position historically associated with Augustine. The\nliterature that clearly distinguishes the claim that free will\nrequires alternate possibilities from the claim that free will\nrequires the falsehood of determinism is contemporary. The former is a\nthesis about events in counterfactual circumstances, whereas the\nlatter is a thesis about the locus of causal control in the actual\ncircumstances. Aside from the foreknowledge literature, support for\nthe rejection of PAP from the perspective of an incompatibilist about\nfree will and determinism can be found in Stump (1990, 1996),\nZagzebski (2000), and Pereboom (2000). This view was originally called\nhyper-incompatibilism by John Martin Fischer, but has recently been\ncalled source incompatibilism. For a recent critique of this version\nof incompatibilism for solving the foreknowledge problem, see Werther\n(2005) and Talsma (2013). \n\nHere is an example of a typical Frankfurt case intended to show that\nan agent can act freely even when she lacks alternate\npossibilities: \n\nBlack, an evil neurosurgeon, wishes to see White dead but is\nunwilling to do the deed himself. Knowing that Mary Jones also\ndespises White and will have a single good opportunity to kill him,\nBlack inserts a mechanism into Jones’s brain that enables Black to\nmonitor and to control Jones’s neurological activity. If the activity\nin Jones’s brain suggests that she is on the verge of deciding not to\nkill White when the opportunity arises, Black’s mechanism will\nintervene and cause Jones to decide to commit the murder. On the other\nhand, if Jones decides to murder White on her own, the mechanism will\nnot intervene. It will merely monitor but will not affect her\nneurological function. Now suppose that when the occasion arises,\nJones decides to kill White without any “help” from\nBlack’s mechanism. In the judgment of Frankfurt and most others, Jones\nis morally responsible for her act. Nonetheless, it appears that she\nis unable to do otherwise since if she had attempted to do so, she\nwould have been thwarted by Black’s device. (Adapted from an example\nby John Fischer, 1982). \n\nMost commentators on examples like this agree that the agent is both\nmorally responsible for her act and acts freely in whatever sense of\nfreedom they endorse. They differ on whether she can do otherwise at\nthe time of her act. Determinists generally interpret the case as one\nin which she exercises compatibilist free will and has no alternate\npossibilities. Most libertarians interpret it as one in which she\nexercises libertarian free will and has alternate possibilities,\ncontrary to appearances. As mentioned above, some philosophers have\ninterpreted it as a case in which she exercises libertarian free will\nbut does not have alternate possibilities. If Frankfurt cases can be\nsuccessfully interpreted in this third way, then they can be used to\nshow the compatibility of infallible foreknowledge and libertarian\nfreedom. \n\nBut there is another way Frankfurt cases can be used to argue for the\ncompatibility of foreknowledge and freedom. There is an important\ndisanalogy between a Frankfurt case and infallible foreknowledge that\nsupports the intuition that an agent retains alternate possibilities\neven when her act is infallibly foreknown. A crucial component of the\nstandard Frankfurt case is that the agent is prevented from acting\nfreely in close possible worlds. That aspect of the case is not in\ndispute. Black’s device is counterfactually manipulative even if it is\nnot actually manipulative. In contrast, infallible foreknowledge is\nnot even counterfactually manipulative. There is no close possible\nworld in which foreknowledge prevents the agent from acting freely. Of\ncourse, if theological fatalism is true, nobody ever acts freely, but\nthe point is that there is no manipulation going on in other possible\nworlds in the foreknowledge scenario. The relation between\nforeknowledge and human acts is no different in one world than in any\nother. But it is precisely the fact that the relation between the\nFrankfurt machine and Mary’s act differs in the actual world than in\nother close worlds that is supposed to make the Frankfurt example work\nin showing the falsity of PAP. \n\nTo make this point clear, let us look at how the standard Frankfurt\ncase would have to be amended to make it a close analogy to the\nsituation of infallible foreknowledge. As Zagzebski has argued (1991,\nchap. 6, sec. 2.1), the device implanted in Mary’s brain would have to\nbe set in such a way that no matter what Mary did, it never\nintervened. It is not even true that it might have\nintervened.  Any world in which Mary decides to commit the murder is a\nworld in which the device is set to make her commit the murder should\nshe not decide to do it, and any world in which she does not decide to\ncommit the murder is a world in which the device is set to prevent her\nfrom deciding to do it if she is about to decide to do it. Now of\ncourse this might be an impossible device, but it would have to be as\ndescribed to be a close analogy to the foreknowledge scenario. And our\nreactions to this amended Frankfurt case are very different from\ntypical reactions to the standard Frankfurt case. In the standard case\nit at least appears to be true that the agent cannot do otherwise,\nwhereas in the case amended to be parallel to the foreknowledge case\nthere is a very straightforward sense in which the agent can do\notherwise because her will is not thwarted by Black in any reasonably\nclose possible world. The machine is ready to manipulate her, but it\ndoes not manipulate her, nor might it have manipulated her since it\ndoes not even manipulate her in counterfactual circumstances. We might\nthink of the machine as a metaphysical accident—an extraneous\naddition to the story that plays no part in the sequence of events in\nany possible world. Possibly it is not clear in the amended story\nwhether or not Mary has alternate possibilities. What the story shows,\nthen, is that alternate possibilities are not always relevant to the\npossession of libertarian freedom. \n\nA crucial premise of the basic argument for theological fatalism is\npremise (2), the principle of the necessity of the past. We have\nalready discussed the Ockhamist response to this premise, which\naccepts (2) as applied to what is strictly past, but rejects it as\napplied to that part of the past that is not wholly or strictly\npast. It is worth asking, however, whether there is any such thing as\nthe necessity of the past at all. What do we mean when we say that the\npast, the strict past, is necessary? When people say “There\nis no use crying over spilled milk,” they presumably mean that there\nis nothing anybody can do now about the spilled milk; the spilling of\nthe milk is outside the realm of our causal control. But it is not at\nall clear that pastness per se puts something outside the\nrealm of our causal control. Rather, it is pastness in conjunction\nwith the metaphysical law that causes must precede their effects. If\nwe decided that effects can precede their causes, it is likely that we would no\nlonger speak of the necessity of the past. \n\nSo the necessity of the past may simply be the principle that past events are\noutside the class of causable events. There is a temporal asymmetry in\ncausability because everything causable is in the future. But some of\nthe future is non-causable as well. Whether or not determinism is\ntrue, there are some events in the future that are causally\nnecessary. If a future event E is necessary, it is causable,\nand not E is not causable. But if the necessity of the past is\nthe non-causability of the past, it would be odd to pick out the\nclass of propositions about the past as possessing an allegedly distinct\nkind of necessity since some of the future has that same kind of\nnecessity. \n\nThis leads to a deeper problem in the idea of the necessity of the\npast. Zagzebski (2014) argues that the interpretation of the necessity\nof the past as a purely temporal modality is confused. What people\ngenerally mean by the necessity of the past is that the past is\ncausally closed, meaning the past is neither causable nor\npreventable. Understood that way, the necessity of the past is not a\npurely temporal modality, and it is not a form of necessity. The\ncategories of causability and non-causability do not correspond to the\nstandard modal categories of the necessary, possible, and\nimpossible. The attempt to assimilate the causal categories to modal\ncategories is a mistake.   \n\nLet us see what happens to the argument for theological fatalism if\nthe necessity of the past is understood as the causal closure of the\npast. \n\nLet us begin with a definition of causal closure: \nE is causally closed =df There is nothing now that\ncan cause E, and there is nothing now that can cause not\nE. \n\nTo use this principle in an argument for fatalism, the principle of\nthe necessity of the past will need to be replaced with the following\nprinciple: \nPrinciple of the Causal Closure of the Past:\nIf E is an event in the past, E is causally \nclosed. \n\nWe will then need to replace the transfer of necessity principle by\nthe following: \n\n Transfer of Causal Closure Principle:\n If E occurs and is causally closed, and necessarily\n (if E occurs then F occurs), then F is causally\n closed. \n\nTo recast the argument for theological fatalism, let us again consider\nthe proposition that you will answer the telephone tomorrow at 9am and\ncall it T: \nBut (6) denies that there are causes of the future. Certainly we\nbelieve that something now, whether agents or events, can cause future\nevents, and the fatalist does not deny that. What the fatalist denies\nis that we can cause something other than what we cause. So\nthe relevant half of the principle of the causal closure of the past is\nas follows: \nPrinciple of the Unpreventability of the Past:\nIf E is an event in the past, nothing now can cause\nnot E. \n\nTo use this principle in a fatalist argument, we need the following:\n \nTransfer of Unpreventability Principle:\nIf E occurs and it is not now causable that E does not\noccur, and necessarily (if E occurs, then F occurs),\nthen it is not now causable that F does not occur. \n\nThis principle is virtually identical to the transfer of\nunpreventability principle proposed by Hugh Rice (2005), and is\nsimilar to a strengthened form of the well-known principle Beta first\nproposed by Peter van Inwagen (1983). \n\nUsing this principle, we get the following argument for theological\nfatalism: \nFrom the Principle of the unpreventability of the past we get: \nFrom the definition of divine infallibility we get: \nFrom 2,3, and the transfer of unpreventability principle we get: \n\nFrom a variation of the Principle of Alternate Possibilities, we\nget: \nFrom (4) and (5), we get: \n\nThis argument for theological fatalism is better than the standard\nargument if a purely temporal necessity is problematic. The second\npremise of the above argument is only the principle that the past is\nunpreventable, not a questionable premise that the past has a special\nkind of necessity distinct from the causal structure of the universe\nsimply in virtue of being past. But since the unpreventability of the\npast is not a form of necessity in the formal sense, then the transfer\nprinciple licensing the crucial inference to (4) is not a transfer of\nnecessity. Unlike the transfer of temporal necessity principle in our\noriginal argument, it is not a variation of an axiom of logic, and is\nfar from indisputable. It appears that the idea of the necessity of\nthe past is confused. On the one hand, we have inherited from Ockham\nthe idea that the past has a kind of necessity for which we can\nformulate an analogue of the formal principles of logical\nnecessity. But the intuitions supporting such a form of necessity are\nintuitions about causability, and the modalities of\ncausability/non-causability do not parallel necessity, possibility,\nand impossibility. If there is a true transfer of causability or\nnon-causability principle, it is not because it is like logical\nnecessity in its formal structure. The problem, then, is that the\nfatalist argument needs a kind of necessity that the past has and\nwhich is also transferred to the future via a valid transfer of\nnecessity principle. In section 5 we will look at how this is a\ngeneral problem that extends beyond the issue of fatalism. \n\nEver since the dilemma of this article was identified, there have\nbeen philosophers who thought that something like our basic argument\nsucceeds in demonstrating that infallible foreknowledge is incompatible\nwith human free will. If they are incompatible, one of them must be\ngiven up. One might give up both, of course, but the dilemma has\nattracted so much attention in the history of philosophy because both\nthe belief in a being with infallible foreknowledge and belief in the\nexistence of libertarian free will are strongly entrenched in the world\nview of many philosophers. To give up one of these beliefs is difficult\nand often has many ramifications for one’s other beliefs.  \n\nThe denial of libertarian freedom has always had many supporters.\nThe idea of making causal determinism the focal point of discussions of\nfree will is modern in origin, and some philosophers think that the\nmodern framing of the issue is confused. Philosophers who deny\nlibertarian freedom may affirm a type of free will compatible with\ndeterminism, or they may instead simply accept the consequence that\nhuman beings lack free will. \n\nThe other incompatibilist position is to affirm libertarian free will\nalong with the principle of alternate possibilities (premise 9), and\nto deny the possibility of infallible foreknowledge. This position has\nrecently become well-known in the view called “open\ntheism.” (Pinnock et al. 1994). These theorists reject\ndivine timelessness and immutability, along with infallible\nforeknowledge, arguing that not only should foreknowledge be rejected\nbecause of its fatalist consequences, but the view of a God who takes\nrisks is more faithful to Scripture than the classical notion of an\nessentially omniscient and foreknowing deity. See Rhoda et al (2006)\nfor an argument that the key issue in the open theism debate is the\nnature of the future. For a review of arguments for open theism, see\nTuggy (2007). Craig and Hunt (2013) give a reply to Rhoda et al and\nTuggy. For an argument that open theism necessitates the view that\npropositions about the future lack truth value, see Arbour\n(2013). Todd (2016a) defends the mutability of the future and argues\nthat future contingents are all false (2016b). The true futurist\ntheory (“the thin red line”) is defended by\nØhrstrøm (2009) and by Malpass and Wawer (2012).\n \n\nOne influential argument that open theists use against defenders of\nforeknowledge who do not also accept Molinism is that foreknowledge\nwithout middle knowledge is useless for divine providence. In a number\nof papers, David Hunt has defended the providential utility of\nforeknowledge without middle knowledge. See Robinson (2004a) for a\nchallenge to Hunt’s defense of the providential usefulness of\nsimple foreknowledge, Hunt’s rebuttal (2004), and\nRobinson’s rejoinder (2004b), all in the same journal. See also\nHasker (2009) for another attack on the usefulness of foreknowledge\nwithout middle knowledge and Hunt’s rebuttal (2009) in the same\njournal. See also Zimmerman (2012) and a rejoinder by Smith (2012).  A\nrelated objection to foreknowledge without middle knowledge is that\nprophecy requires middle knowledge. See Pruss (2007) for a defense of\na foreknowledge-only account of prophecy. \nAnother issue related to divine providence is the\nefficacy of past-directed prayers. Kevin Timpe (2005) argues that\nadherents of simple foreknowledge or timeless knowledge and Molinists\nhave the resources to explain the efficacy of prayers about the past,\nbut open theism does not. \n\nA form of fatalism that is even older than theological fatalism is\nlogical fatalism, the thesis that the past truth of a proposition about\nthe future entails fatalism. Aristotle discusses this form of fatalism\nin his famous Sea Battle Argument, mentioned in section\n 2.1\n above. A clearer and more sophisticated form of the\nargument was proposed by Diodorus Cronus, whose argument is remarkably\nsimilar in form to our basic argument for theological fatalism. The\nlogical fatalist argument parallel to our basic argument is as\nfollows: Argument for logical fatalism Let S = the proposition that there will be a sea battle tomorrow. \n\nUnlike the argument for theological fatalism, the argument for logical\nfatalism has few defenders. One reason is that (2L) is less plausible\nthan (2). But recently Warfield (1997) has argued for the equivalence\nof the two forms of fatalism if God is necessarily existent and\nessentially omniscient. Responses have been given by Hasker (1998) and\nBrueckner (2000), and there is a rejoinder to both by Warfield\n(2000). Peter Graham (2008) argues that Warfield’s argument is\nquestion-begging because the consensus to which Warfield appeals\nemerged against the backdrop of an assumption that there is no\nnecessarily existent being. \n\nZagzebski has argued that the dilemma of theological fatalism is\nbroader than a problem about free will. The modal or causal asymmetry\nof time, a transfer of necessity principle, and the supposition of\ninfallible foreknowledge are mutually inconsistent. (1991,\nappendix). If there is a distinct kind of necessity that the past\nhas qua past, and which is not an implicit reference to the\nlack of causability of the past, then it is temporally\nasymmetrical. The past has it and the future does not. The necessity\nof the past and the contingency of the future are two sides of the\nsame coin. To say that the future is contingent in the sense of\ntemporal modality does not imply that we have causal control over the\nentire future, of course. We lack control over part of the future\nbecause part (or even all) of it is causally necessary. But if the\nnecessity of the past is distinct from the lack of causability, and is\na type of necessity the past has just because it is past, the future\nmust lack that particular kind of necessity. \n\nThe idea that there is temporally asymmetrical modality is\ninconsistent with the transfer of necessity principle and the\nsupposition of infallible foreknowledge of an essentially omniscient\ndeity. The inconsistency can be demonstrated as follows: Dilemma of Foreknowledge and Modal Temporal Asymmetry Again, let T = the proposition that you will answer the\ntelephone tomorrow at 9 am. \n\n(1f) and the Principle of the Necessity of the Past tells us\nthat \n\nFrom (1f) and the definition of an EOF it follows that \n\nBy the Transfer of Necessity Principle (TNP), (2f) and (3f) entail \n\n(4f) is logically equivalent to \n\nFrom the Principle of the Contingency of the Future we get \n\nBut (6f) contradicts (5f). \n\nThe inconsistency shown in this argument has nothing to do with free\nwill or fatalism.  \n\nIn fact, the problem is even more general than this\nargument illustrates. The reason essential omniscience conflicts with\ntemporal modality and the transfer principle is that the existence of\nan EOF requires that a proposition about the past entails a proposition\nabout the future. But it straightforwardly follows from TNP that a\nproposition that is now-necessary cannot entail a proposition that is\nnot now-necessary. So if the past is now-necessary and the future is\nnot, a proposition about the past cannot entail a proposition about the\nfuture. The conclusion is that if asymmetrical temporal modality is\ncoherent, it can obey TNP, or it can permit a proposition about the\npast to entail a proposition about the future, but not both. \n\nThe root of the problem, then, is that it is impossible for there to\nbe a type of modality that has the following features: \n\nSo the problem of the alleged incompatibility of infallible\nforeknowledge and free will is a special case of a more\ngeneral problem about time and necessity. It was suggested in section\n 2.6\nthat the problem may be (a) above. There is no temporally asymmetrical\nnecessity.  But regardless of what one thinks of fatalist arguments,\nthe general problem in the logic of time and causation needs to be\naddressed. Both the alleged modal asymmetry of time and the causal\nasymmetry should be examined in more detail.  \nAs this entry shows, the literature on foreknowledge and fatalism is\nenormous, and it continues to grow. Some of the papers mentioned here\nare collected in a recent book edited by Fischer and Todd (2015). Todd\n(2014) reviews the main debates concerning logical and theological\nfatalism and the truth of future contingents.","contact.mail":"lzagzebski@ou.edu","contact.domain":"ou.edu"}]
