They were notorious for logic-chopping,\npurportedly idle conceptual puzzles, and paradoxes such as\n“Today go to Yue but arrive yesterday” and “A white\nhorse is not a horse.” Because reflection on language in ancient\nChina centered on “names” (ming, words) and their\nrelation to “stuff” (shi, objects, events,\nsituations), 2nd-century B.C.E. Han dynasty archivists dubbed these\nthinkers the “School of Names,” one of six recognized\nphilosophical movements. The “school” is a taxonomical\nfiction, however. The varied figures assigned to it—Deng Xi, Yin\nWen, Hui Shi, and Gongsun Long, among others—never formed a\ndistinct circle or movement devoted to any particular doctrine or way\nof life, and their intellectual interests overlapped extensively with\nthose of the later\n Mohists,\n Zhuangzi, and\n Xunzi.\n Several of these men were active politically: Hui Shi was a\ngovernment minister, Yin Wen and Gongsun Long political advisors and\npeace activists. Still, in the eyes of Han historians, they devoted\nthemselves to no signature ethical or political doctrines. Hence they\nbecame known primarily for their interest in language and disputation\nand on that basis were deemed a “school.” \n\n\nBefore the Han dynasty, the social group of which these thinkers were\na part was known as the bian\nzhe—“disputers” or\n“dialecticians”—because they spent much of their\ntime in “disputation” (bian, also\n“discrimination” or “distinction drawing”), a\nform of dialectical persuasion and inquiry aimed fundamentally at\n“distinguishing” the proper semantic relations between\nnames and the things or kinds of things to which they refer.\n“Disputers” is thus probably a more appropriate English\nlabel for Hui Shi, Gongsun Long, and the others than is the\n“School of Names,” though it refers not specifically to\nthese figures but to the broader class of scholars to which they\nbelonged. (“Name-distinguishers” or\n“distinction-disputers” would be even more accurate,\nthough these terms are too clumsy to adopt as English equivalents.)\nThe disputers flourished for about a century and a half as wandering\npolitical advisors, counseling rulers throughout pre-unification\nChina. They disappeared with the onset of the Qin dynasty (221\nB.C.E.), partly because the political and intellectual climate of the\nnew empire was hostile to their purely theoretical, occasionally\nflippant inquiries, and partly because with unification their\npolitical services became obsolete. \n\nHan dynasty archivists associated seven figures with the “School\nof Names”: Deng Xi, Yin Wen, Hui Shi, Gongsun Long, Cheng-gong\nSheng, Huang Gong, and Mao Gong (Han History 30,\n“Bibliographical Treatise”). To these we can add one\nfurther figure, Huan Tuan, whom China’s earliest history of\nthought, “Under Heaven,” Book 33 of the Zhuangzi,\npairs with Gongsun Long. About the last four of these men virtually\nnothing is\n known.[1]\n About the first four, we know more, but not much. There is little\nfirst-hand evidence about what they thought, since nearly none of the\nwritings attributed to them by Han bibliographers survive. With the\nexception of a few brief texts attributed to Gongsun Long, everything\nwe know comes from quotations or anecdotes in other texts, including\nthe Zhuangzi, Xunzi, Annals of Lü Buwei, Hanfeizi, and\nseveral Han dynasty anthologies. These second-hand accounts typically\ndate from long after the lifetime of the figures they describe, and\nthey may be embellished or dramatized, warped to fit their\nwriters’ agenda, or even fictional.  \nContemporary studies sometimes treat these disputers together with the\n later Mohists.\n Topics associated with them are addressed in Mohist texts, and\n“Under Heaven” depicts sects of Mohists engaged in\n“disputes about the hard and white and the same and\ndifferent,” two central themes of the disputers. The later\nMohists probably respected the individuals identified with the School\nof Names but were critical of them. Numerous passages in the Mohist\nDialectics appear to be either rebuttals of their ideas or\ndefenses of Mohist doctrines against their arguments. On the other\nhand, insofar as ‘the School of Names’ is simply a label\nfor early thinkers interested in language and dialectics, the later\nMohists themselves largely fit under this label.  \nHui Shi, Gongsun Long, and the others have been described as Chinese\n“sophists,” and there are indeed superficial similarities\nbetween them and the Greek sophists, at least as the two groups were\ncharacterized by their respective enemies. Their social role and the\nsubject matter of their inquiries were generally quite\n different.[2]\n But both were interested in language and philosophical issues\ninspired by reflection on language. Both taught rhetoric and argued\nlawsuits. Both were attacked for arguing purely to win, for being\nwilling to argue either side of any issue, and for propounding\nparadoxes, all without regard for the facts. Their inquiries led a few\nthinkers in each tradition toward relativism. At least some members of\nboth groups were itinerant, the Greeks moving from place to place\ngiving public exhibitions and offering instruction, the Chinese\ntypically seeking to win the ear of rulers and influence political\npolicy.  \nThe disputers’ focal activity appears to have been a form of\npublic debate or persuasion called “disputation” or\n“distinction drawing” (bian), which often took\nplace in the court of a regional lord or a state sovereign.\nDisputation appears to have been rooted partly in the practice of\nlitigation, partly in the rhetoric used by court advisors in the\n“explanations” (shuo, also\n“persuasions”) through which they tried to influence\npolitical policy. Primarily a type of analogical argumentation,\ndisputation, like much legal rhetoric, often took the form of citing a\nprecedent, analogy, or model (fa, also “law”) and\nexplaining why the case at hand should be treated similarly or\n not.[3] \nDisputation could be pursued for a variety of ends, some extolled by\nancient writers, some condemned. Constructively, it could be a means\nof clarifying and defending the right way (dao). Through it,\none could lead others to distinguish shi/fei (this/not-this,\nright/wrong) correctly and thus obtain knowledge. Of disputation in\nthis sense, Xunzi says that “the gentleman must engage in\ndisputation” and The Annals of Lü Buwei remarks\nthat in the course of study, one must occasionally engage in\n“disputation and persuasion” (bian shuo) in order\nto expound the Way\n (dao).[4]\n This would also be the sense in which\n Mencius\n explains that he has no choice but to engage in disputation, since as\na follower of the sages he must attempt to rectify people’s\nhearts and refute the pernicious sayings of Yang Zhu and\n Mo Di\n (Mencius,\n 3B:9).[5] \nBut disputation could also degenerate into a superficial game of\ntrying to outtalk the opponent, an idle contest of wits aimed at\ndefending sophistries, or even a simple quarrel. This side of\ndisputation explains Mencius’s chagrined response when told he\nhas a reputation for being “fond of disputation” (3B:9).\nEarly texts are uniformly disparaging about such empty or flippant\ndisputation. The Annals of Lü Buwei complains that\n“Those in the world who study engage in much disputation. Their\nsayings are facile and expressions are upside-down. They don’t\nseek the facts (shi, the actual things, what is real). They\nstrive to demolish each other, with victory as their [sole]\npurpose” (15.8/368). “Under Heaven” says that\ndisputers “exaggerate others’ hearts and change\nothers’ intentions. They can defeat others’ mouths, but\ncannot persuade their hearts.” As to Hui Shi, “He took\nopposing others as the substance of his activity and desired to make a\nname for himself by defeating others; that’s why he\ncouldn’t get along with people” (cf. Graham 1981:\n284–85). Sima Qian, the Han historian who may have coined the\nlabel “School of Names,” says in his account of the six\nschools that the disputers “determine things only by names and\nneglect people’s feelings.” They twist words so\n“people cannot get back to the thought” they were trying\nto express (Shi Ji, Book 130). Practitioners of this sort of\nantagonistic or frivolous disputation cared only for victory, even at\nthe cost of distorting the opponent’s point, and they defended\nbizarre claims without regard for the facts.  \nFor further discussion of disputation in the context of early Chinese\nphilosophy, see the supplementary document. \nThe next section will briefly explore the general themes that early\ntexts associate with the disputers. We will then look more closely at\nthe doctrines of the four known figures the Han History\nassigns to the School of Names.  \nEarly texts regularly associate the disputers with four themes.\n“The same and different” (tong yi) and\n“hard and white” (jian bai) are mentioned almost\ninvariably. “Deeming so the not-so, admissible the\ninadmissible” (ran bu ran, ke bu ke) and “the\ndimensionless” (wu hou) appear slightly less often. A\ngood example is this excerpt from “Autumn Waters,” Book 17\nof the Daoist anthology Zhuangzi, in which Gongsun Long\nhimself is depicted mentioning three of these themes:  \nWhat are “uniting the same and different,”\n“separating hard from white,” and “making so the\nnot-so and admissible the inadmissible”? Given the limited\nevidence, we cannot be completely sure what these phrases—along\nwith “the dimensionless”—allude to. But most likely\nthey denote types of sophisms or paradoxes, not specific\nstatements or\n doctrines.[6]\n And early texts, especially the Mohist Dialectics, do give\nus enough information to make reasonable conjectures about the general\nissues they involve. (See the entry on the\n Mohist Canons.) \nAs we saw above, “same” (tong) and\n“different” (yi) are central concepts in ancient\nChinese theories of language, knowledge, and disputation, as\nrepresented by the Mohists and Xunzi. According to the Mohists,\n“sameness” can refer to at least four types of relations:\nidentity; part-whole relations; being grouped together or co-located;\nand having some intrinsic similarity and thus being part of the same\n“kind”. This last variety of “sameness” is\nprobably most important for our purposes here. Names names for\n“kinds” (lei)—one type of general\nterm— are regarded as denoting all things or stuff\n(shi) that is “the same” in one or more respects,\nsuch as all horses, which share the same shape (xing) and appearance\n(mao). Speakers can use language to communicate because they are\nfamiliar with the kinds of similar things that words refer to, and\nthus upon hearing a word know what the thing referred to “is\nlike.” The relations of “same” and\n“different” determine what counts as correct matching of\nnames and stuff and thus what knowledge is. Disputation is\nfundamentally a process of debating whether the thing in question is\n“this” (shi) or “not-this”\n(fei), the same as or different from some model, paradigm, or\nanalogy. The issue of how to distinguish “same” from\n“different” is thus pivotal to Chinese philosophy of\nlanguage, epistemology, and disputation.  \nSome references to the disputers’ interest in “the same\nand different,” then, may allude to legitimate, if widely\nmisunderstood, inquiries into the foundations of language and\nknowledge. Gongsun Long’s “uniting the same and\ndifferent,” on the other hand, probably refers to manipulating\nstandards for distinguishing different kinds in order to produce\nsophisms. The disputer could cite features of different kinds of\nthings by which they could be treated as the same or features of\nthings of the same kind by which they could be treated as different.\n(This strategy is suggested by the fifth thesis of Hui Shi, to be\ndiscussed below.) Such shifting of criteria for distinguishing\nsameness from difference is illustrated by many of the\ndisputers’ sophisms. Among other examples, Hui Shi’s\n“The sky is as low as earth, mountains are level with\nmarshes” deems different things similar; some of the arguments\nfor Gongsun Long’s “A white horse is not a horse”\ntreat things of the same kind—horses and white horses—as\ndifferent, playing largely on the ambiguity between “same”\nin the sense of being of the same kind and “same” in the\nsense of identity.  \nManipulating the same and the different alters the distinctions that\nground our use of words and thus our standards of knowledge. (In the\nmost extreme case, uniting everything into a “Great One”\nwould leave us unable to communicate linguistically and eliminate all\nconceptual or propositional knowledge.) The notion that we can realign\nthe boundaries of the same and different without limit signals a\nradical skepticism about the existence of natural kinds. Indeed, it\nthreatens to leave us without any knowledge at all, since the\nstandards by which to judge whether one knows something are never\nfixed. It also provides an approach to winning any disputation:\ninstead of seeking objective criteria that fix the correct\ndistinctions between things, disputers just redraw the distinctions\nbetween things or kinds in whatever way needed to establish their\nclaim.  \nIn later Mohist thought, “hard-white” or “as hard to\nwhite” (jian bai) is a technical term for the relation\nbetween two things or two features of a thing that are inseparable and\n“mutually pervasive”—that is, they completely\ncoincide throughout the same spatial\n location.[7]\n The paradigm of such features is the hardness and whiteness of a\ncompletely white stone. Another example is the length and breadth of\nan object (B4). Features that are “as hard to white”\n“fill” or “pervade” each other (B15). Thus\nthey are in a sense “two,” but unlike a pair of shoes, one\ncannot be taken away from the other (B4). The relation of “as\nhard to white” contrasts with that between two measured lengths,\nwhich cannot everywhere overlap without merging to form only a single\nlength, instead of the original two, and with that between any two\nmutually exclusive features, such as being an ox and being a horse. No\nsingle object can be both an ox and a horse, but an object can be both\nhard and white.  \n“Separating hard and white,” then, is treating mutually\npervasive features as if they were separable or detachable, like two\nspatially distinct objects or two removable physical parts of a whole.\n(As Graham points out (2003: 173), in contexts where “hard and\nwhite” is mentioned alone, with no reference to\n“separating” the two, the phrase may simply be a metaphor\nfor logic-chopping or hair-splitting debate in general.) A plausible\nexample of “separating hard and white” is Gongsun\nLong’s treating the color of a white horse as a thing separable\nfrom the shape, as when the text reads, “The white is not the\nhorse. A white horse is a horse together with white”\n(“White Horse Discourse”).  \n“So” (ran) is frequently used to indicate that a\npredicate is true of a thing. It can also mean “the case”\nor “how things are.” According to Mohist Canon A71,\nsomething is “so” when its features are similar to a model\nfor a certain kind of thing. “Admissible” (ke)\nrefers to statements that are semantically or logically\n“possible”—that is, free of logical or pragmatic\ncontradiction. In contexts concerning action, “admissible”\nrefers to what is permissible by moral, social, prudential, or other\nstandards. So “making so the not-so, admissible the\ninadmissible” refers to collapsing or reversing conventional\ndistinctions governing language use, judgment, morality, and courtesy.\nThe practical upshot is roughly the same as that of “uniting\nsame and different,” but the latter refers to kind relations\nbetween objects, “making so the not-so” to speech and\naction. “Making admissible the inadmissible” was the\ntrademark of Deng Xi, the earliest figure associated with the School\nof Names, who became famous for his doctrine of “both sides\nadmissible” (liang ke).  \nPreventing the “not-so” from being treated as\n“so” is precisely the point of “correcting\nnames”: \nCollapsing the distinction between so and not-so, admissible and\ninadmissible is a prominent topic in the famous “Discourse on\nEqualizing Things,” Book 2 of the\n Zhuangzi.\n Though generally critical of the disputers (among whom its author may\nnevertheless once have numbered), the text agrees that such\ndistinctions can be collapsed or reversed, depending on what standards\nof judgment we choose to adopt. It is thus firmly opposed to the\northodoxy, represented by Analects (see the entry on the\n Confucius),\n the Mohists,\n Xunzi,\n and Lü Buwei, that clear, fixed public standards must be set for\nthe use of names, since without them, patterns of use will vary and\nsocial chaos is likely to ensue. The Zhuangzi suggests that\ndisorder does not invariably follow from “linguistic\nliberalism,” and indeed that fixed standards are unattainable\nand unnecessary for communication.  \nThe fourth theme, the dimensionless (wu hou, literally\n“lacking thickness”), is more obscure, mentioned only once\nin the Xunzi and once in the Annals of Lü\nBuwei. The dimensionless probably refers to a geometric point.\nAccording to the Mohists, the dimensionless does not\n“fill” anything (A65). A starting point (duan) is\nthe dimensionless tip of a solid object (A61). Allusions to the\ndisputers sometimes contrast the dimensionless with “the\ndimensioned” (you hou, “having thickness”),\nwhich the Mohists explain as having something it is bigger than (A55).\nThe dimensionless is probably associated with the disputers because of\nHui Shi’s paradox that “The dimensionless cannot be\naccumulated, yet its size is a thousand miles.” (Points cannot\nbe accumulated, yet a great girth or length is the sum of the points\nthat constitute it.) In passages referring to the disputers and their\nsophistries, “the dimensionless” probably alludes to any\nparadox arising from the concept of a geometric point or an\ninfinitesimal.  \nDeng Xi (d. 501 B.C.E.) was China’s earliest renowned lawyer and\nrhetorician. He has been called the “founding father of the\nChinese logical tradition” (Harbsmeier 1998: 286), though this\nis probably an overstatement, since we lack evidence that he undertook\nany explicit study of argumentation or that he influenced the theories\nof the Mohists or Xunzi. As Harbsmeier (287) rightly points out,\nhowever, Deng Xi epitomizes the roots of Chinese disputation in legal\nrhetoric. He establishes a link between disputation and litigation\nthat continues throughout the classical period. Indeed, his reputation\nas a legal and political gadfly may have contributed to later\nauthoritarian thinkers’ attitude that litigators disrupt social\norder and should be banned.  \nAll of our very limited information about Deng Xi is second-hand,\ncomprising a one-line entry in the Zuo Commentary, curt\nattacks on him in the Xunzi, three anecdotes in The\nAnnals of Lü Buwei, and a few stories in texts of later\n date.[8]\n According to the Han History, he was the author of two\nscrolls (pian) of writings, neither of which survives. The\nZuo Commentary (Duke Ding, Year 9), the earliest and most\nreliable of our sources, reports that he composed a penal code on\nbamboo strips, perhaps drawn up as an alternative to the official code\nof his home state of Zheng. By the time of the Han dynasty, however,\nthe code had been lost.  \nXunzi alludes to Deng Xi’s thought in three places, each time\npairing him with\n Hui Shi,\n though the men were from different states and lived about 200 years\napart. This incongruity suggests that the pair are being used\niconically to represent a certain general intellectual style or\norientation. Thus the sophistries Xunzi ascribes to them may not be\ntheir invention, or at least not Deng Xi’s. Xunzi describes them\nas “fond of dealing with strange doctrines and playing with\nbizarre expressions” (6.6), of which he gives these examples\n(3.1): \nThe first two of these are similar to paradoxes attributed to Hui Shi\nin “Under Heaven” (Zhuangzi, Book 33); we will\ndiscuss them in the section on\n Hui Shi.\n The seventh is also listed in “Under Heaven,” but not\nattributed to Hui Shi there. This suggests that the list of paradoxes\nassociated with him was still fluid at the time of Xunzi’s\nwriting. The third is similar to the spatial paradoxes of Hui Shi,\nalso to be discussed below. The sixth is obscure; some commentators\nemend “hooks” to a similar graph for “old\nwomen.” The fourth and fifth are puzzling, since they are not\nobviously paradoxes or sophisms. Commentators often combine them into\na single sentence, but in the text all seven seem to be independent,\nthree-word sentences.  \nXunzi’s fundamental complaint about Hui Shi and Deng Xi is that\ntheir “frivolous investigations” do not conform to\ntraditional ritual propriety and righteousness (3.1), an unsurprising\ncriticism given the Confucian’s commitment to ritual\ntraining—and thus conventional standards for the correct use of\nnames—along with his general disdain for science and\nintellectual curiosity (12.3). They are “incisive” and\n“clever,” but their ideas are “useless,” yield\nfew concrete results, and have no application to government (6.6).\nThey have “no regard for the facts about right and wrong, so and\nnot-so” (8.3). In the eyes of a 3rd-century B.C.E. Confucian\ntraditionalist, then, the 6th-century Deng Xi was emblematic of a\nbright, talented person who wastes his energy on pointless\nintellectual games and sophistry, perhaps with a deliberate disregard\nfor the truth, instead of earnestly committing himself to moral\ntraining and political administration. \nFor an account of Deng Xi’s legal and political career, see this\nsupplementary document: \nLittle is known of Yin Wen (fl. late 4th century B.C.E.), and it is\nunclear why the Han History classifies him with the\n“School of Names.” Perhaps the one scroll of writings by\nhim mentioned in the “Bibliographical Treatise” was about\nlanguage. What little information we have about him comes mainly from\ntwo sources, the “Under Heaven” essay and The Annals\nof Lü Buwei, both of which are considerably later than his\nlifetime and thus must be taken mainly to be reporting legend. Neither\ntext attributes to him views on language or disputation. “Under\nHeaven” links him to Song Xing, his teacher or colleague, and\nthe pair were among the many scholars who gathered at Jixia in Qi\nunder the patronage of King Xuan (r. 319–301\n B.C.E.).[9]\n Xunzi rebuts several of Song Xing’s doctrines at length but\ndoes not mention Yin Wen. \n“Under Heaven” portrays Yin Wen and Song Xing as tireless\ncrusaders devoted to saving the world by advocating non-aggression, a\nlife of few, easily satisfied desires, and a tolerant, unbiased frame\nof mind. To promote these doctrines, they “traveled the world,\npersuading the high and instructing the low.” In relations with\nothers, to save people from fighting they taught that “to be\ninsulted is no disgrace,” and to save the world from war, they\ntaught “forbid aggression and put troops to rest.” (As the\nname suggests, the Warring States era was marked by frequent,\ncatastrophic wars.) Concerning the self, they held that the inherent\ndesires are few and shallow, a doctrine that, if true, would remove\nmany potential reasons for conflict. “Their starting point in\ndealing with things was avoiding enclosures,” or psychological\nbarriers due to prejudice or dogmatic commitment which tend to result\nin biased or one-sided judgments. Such “enclosures” are\nfrequently also a source of conflict, since they may prevent one from\nappreciating all relevant features of a situation or understanding\nothers’ point of view. Yin Wen and Song Xing emphasized that the\nheart itself has a kind of “conduct,” independent of\nexternal conduct. In their anti-war stance and emphasis on benefit,\nthey display affinities with Mohist thought: “If something was\nof no advantage to the world, understanding it was not as good as\nabandoning it.” But the doctrines of tolerance and avoiding bias\nare genuinely novel, and are probably the reason Song Xing is singled\nout for praise in the Zhuangzi (Book 1).  \nThe Annals of Lü Buwei depicts Yin Wen in an audience\nwith King Min of Qi (r. 300–284 B.C.E.), defending the doctrine\nthat to be insulted is not disgraceful. (Again, we should keep in mind\nthat the details of the story may be mostly later invention.) The\nanecdote vividly illustrates several of the main techniques by which\nthe disputers conducted their craft. Yin Wen identifies distinguishing\nfeatures for calling things by a certain name and employs models and\nanalogies to persuade the king. The context of the passage is a\ndiscussion of “correcting names.” Because he failed to\ncorrect his own use of names, King Min knew enough to be fond of\n“officers” but not how to distinguish the sort of people\nproperly referred to as “officers.” (Shi,\n“officer,” was a social rank similar to\n“knight,” but by this era it had lost most of its martial\nconnotation.) Yin Wen proposes that “officers” are\ndistinguished by four types of conduct: they are filial in serving\ntheir parents, loyal in serving their ruler, trustworthy toward\nfriends, and brotherly toward neighbors. The king agrees, indicating\nalso that this is just the sort of person he would appoint as a\ngovernment official. Yin Wen asks whether the king would still appoint\nsuch a person supposing that, on being insulted in public, he did not\nfight. The king replies that to be insulted is a disgrace; he would\nnot appoint a disgraced person.  \nThe King had no response. \nYin Wen said, “Suppose there is a man here, when governing his\nstate, if people do wrong he condemns them, if people do no wrong he\ncondemns them; if people commit a crime he punishes them, if people\ncommit no crime he punishes them. Then would it be admissible for him\nto despise the people for being hard to govern?” \nThe King said, “Not admissible.”  \nYin Wen said, “…The King’s command says: ‘One\nwho kills another dies, one who injures another is maimed.’ The\npeople, fearing the King’s command, dare not fight even when\ndeeply insulted; this is fulfilling the King’s command. Yet the\nKing says, ‘Not daring to fight when insulted, this is a\ndisgrace.’ Now to call it a disgrace, it’s this\nthat’s called ‘condemning it’. In the one case to\nappoint a person as an official, in the other not, this is deeming it\na crime. This is the King punishing someone when he has committed no\ncrime.” \nThe King had no response. (16.8/402) \nKing Min is presented as an example of someone whose use of names,\nsuch as ‘officer’, is incorrect: name and form do not\n“fit.” As a result, “those he calls worthy are\nunworthy, what he calls good is depraved, and what he calls admissible\nis perverse.” Interestingly, the text employs terminology that\ndovetails with later Mohist semantic theory and epistemology. It\nexplains that the King did not know the “reason” or\n“basis” for deeming people “officers,” using\nthe same term as the Mohists—gu—and alludes to\nhis poor ability to classify or “sort” (lun)\nthings into kinds, which in later Mohist epistemology is the mark of\nunderstanding. Though the Annals story does not make this point\nexplicitly, we can link the King’s erroneous\n“sorting” to Yin Wen’s doctrine of “avoiding\nenclosures.” The King’s judgments about officers are\n“enclosed” by his dogmatic conviction that to be insulted\nis a disgrace and that an officer must answer challenges to his honor\nwith violence. \nHui Shi (fl. 313 B.C.E.) is a complex figure, familiar and indistinct\nby turns. He is mentioned in at least eight early texts. Only two, the\nXunzi and the Zhuangzi “Under Heaven”\nessay, give any information about his philosophical views, and they\nmerely attribute a series of theses to him without recording his\narguments. For a review of biographical information about him, see the\nsupplementary document. \nWe have no direct evidence of Hui Shi’s views on language and\nmeaning. But as Graham points out (1989: 81), a story preserved in a\nHan dynasty text suggests that he may have held a view similar to that\nof the Mohists (Canon B70) (see the entries on\n Mohism\n and the\n Mohist Canons).\n Language enables us to communicate by indicating that the objects\nreferred to are similar to things we already know, the kinds of\nobjects conventionally denoted by those words. \nAs we would expect from mainstream Chinese theories of language and\ndisputation, Hui Shi is accustomed to explaining things by appeal to\nanalogies. Indeed, his answer to the king is itself an analogy, or at\nleast an illustrative example (the Chinese word for\n“analogy,” pi, refers to both). We can also\nnotice from the story that in seeking to learn about something\nunknown, one does not ask for a definition of the object, but\nfor a description of what its features “are like.” The\nstandard response is to cite a familiar analogue and then point out\nthe differences between the unknown object and the familiar one.\nCommunication proceeds not by knowing “meanings,” but by\nknowing how to distinguish similar from different kinds of\n things.[10] \n“Under Heaven” is overwhelmingly critical of Hui Shi: \nThe text concludes that he wasted his talents “chasing after the\nmyriad things,” in his many directions of inquiry, instead of\nconcentrating on a single path. As a result, he only “ended with\na name for being good at disputation.” This dismissal is less an\nobjective evaluation of Hui Shi’s inquiries than an expression\nof the intellectual orientation of the essay’s Han dynasty\nauthor, who values only moral cultivation and commitment to an ethical\nand political dao (way), not inquiry for inquiry’s\nsake. It seems likely that we would have considered Hui Shi’s\nexplanations of “the myriad things” to be of great\ninterest.  \nOur only detailed information about Hui Shi’s doctrines comes\nfrom two sources: the seven statements attributed jointly to him and\n Deng Xi\n in the Xunzi (3.1), which we looked at briefly above, and\nthe “Under Heaven” essay, which attributes ten theses to\nhim, some paradoxical. “Under Heaven” was probably written\nlong after Hui Shi’s death, and only one of its ten theses\nappears in the much earlier Xunzi list. Hence we cannot be\nsure the ten theses were indeed Hui Shi’s; some or all may have\nbeen the work of anonymous followers who adopted him as their\nfigurehead. Fortunately, this historical issue is irrelevant to their\nphilosophical interest. Either way, the theses are intriguing ideas\nformulated by one or more Chinese thinkers probably sometime during\nthe late 4th or the 3rd century B.C.E. The arguments for the theses\nhave been lost, and as a result some are extremely obscure. But others\nare reasonably clear or at least open to educated conjecture.  \nThe ten theses revolve around the theme that distinctions are not\ninherently fixed, but relative to a perspective, and thus can be\nredrawn or collapsed as we like simply by shifting perspectives.\nSeveral of the paradoxes focus on negating commonsense distinctions,\nin particular spatial and temporal ones, partly by appeal to the\nrelativity of comparisons and partly by appeal to indexicals (Hansen\n1992: 262). (A high mountain is not high when seen from space; if I\nwalk southward, a spot that is south of me now will in seconds be\nnorth of me.) The fifth thesis, on “the same” and\n“different,” seems to provide a key to several, perhaps\nall of the others. It indicates that on some scale or another,\nanything can be deemed “the same” or\n“different.”  \nThe theses are presented in “Under Heaven” as follows: \nHui Shi took these to be of great significance. He displayed them to\nthe world to let the disputers know of them, and the disputers of the\nworld enjoyed them with him. \nIt is unclear whether the order of the sequence is deliberate, but\nthis seems unlikely, since the temporal paradoxes are not placed\ntogether, and it is hard to see how thesis 8, about the rings, fits\ninto a deliberate, argumentative sequence. On the other hand, the last\nthesis, the only one with ethical import, reads like a grand\nconclusion and so probably belongs in the final position. The first\nforms a natural opening, with the “Great One” portending\nthe “one unit” of the tenth, and the second may about one\nof the notions introduced in the first, the “Small One” or\ninfinitesimal. The fifth is among the clearest and is probably the\nbasis for several of the others. Some scholars have suggested that the\nlist breaks into two parts, with the fifth thesis summarizing the\nfirst half, but this interpretation seems forced. The first, fifth,\nand tenth are of course neither paradoxes nor sophistries, but\nrelatively straightforward philosophical theses. Thesis 3 is a variant\nof the first two paradoxes attributed to Hui Shi and Deng Xi in\nXunzi (3.1), listed above in the section on\n Deng Xi.\n With those two exceptions, the paradoxes attributed to Hui Shi here\nare considerably more interesting philosophically than those Xunzi\nmentions.  \nThe theses are obscure enough that, especially without knowing Hui\nShi’s original arguments, any close interpretation must be\npartly speculative. Different readers are bound to arrive at different\nconclusions. With the possible exception of theses 1, 5, and 10, there\nis simply not enough contextual information to offer an authoritative\nargument for any interpretation, though at least some readings can be\nruled out for failing to cohere with any recognized issues or theories\nin early Chinese philosophical discourse. Here we will offer a\ntentative explanation of each thesis grounded in the philosophical\ncontext sketched in\n “Background and Overview”\n above.[11] The theses divide fairly naturally\ninto four groups, which we will discuss one by one. \nThe first group comprises theses 1, 5, and 10, which state\nphilosophical doctrines about ontology and ethics, not paradoxes, and\nwhich are relatively easy to understand. All three deal with the\nplurality of possible ways to distinguish things, either as “the\nsame” or “different” or as parts of a whole, ranging\nfrom the smallest possible part—the infinitesimal—to the\nlargest possible whole, the “Great One,” which includes\neverything in the cosmos. How we distinguish things is relative to the\nscale or perspective we adopt. Thesis 5 is slightly obscure, but it\nseems to describe the relative or perspectival nature of relations of\nsimilarity and difference. Two things can be the same on a large\nscale, or in some general respect, while at the same time being\ndifferent on a smaller scale, or in some more specific respect. For\nexample, two animals can be the same in being of the kind\nhorse, yet be different in color. Anything can be similar or\ndifferent on some scale or other. If we distinguish finely, every\nindividual horse is different, while if we distinguish coarsely,\nhorses are no different from other animals, or even from all other\nthings. There seems to be an unlimited range of levels on which we can\ndistinguish relations of sameness and difference, including deeming\nevery individual different or the myriad kinds of things the same.\n \nBecause the same/different relation comprises both kind relations and\npart-whole relations, Thesis 5 can also be taken to include part-whole\nrelations. Deeming all things “the same” is deeming them\nall parts of the same whole. Deeming them “different” can\nbe understood as separating them off as individual parts of that\nwhole. To the extent that the other theses are based on relations of\nsameness versus difference and part versus whole, then, thesis 5 may\nexplain them all.  \nThesis 1 is nearly self-explanatory. How we distinguish\nthings—in this case, how we even count “1”—is\nrelative to some standard of division. The thesis concerns summing and\ndividing. The whole cosmos can be summed into a whole to form the\nGreat One. Or it can be divided down to the smallest possible unit,\nthe Small One, probably a geometric point.  \nThesis 10 presents an ethical principle tied together with an\nontological one, which presumably is meant to justify it. Since\neverything can be summed into a whole—the Great One—heaven\nand earth and the myriad things contained therein can be considered a\nsingle “body” or\n “unit.”[12]\n (In classical texts, the expression ‘heaven and earth’\nrefers to the cosmos, including not only the sky and earth but the\nentire natural world.) The ethical principle follows intuitively. If\neverything is one unit, then any care (ai, also\n“love”) we have for ourselves should also be directed at\nall of the other myriad things (wu, “things,” or,\nperhaps more specifically, “creatures”), since\nfundamentally we are all parts of the same vast “unit” or\n“body.” This ethical stance takes the ideal of\nimpartiality even farther than the Mohists. Their position is that we\nmust care inclusively for every person in the world. Thesis 10\nadvocates caring for every thing as well.  \nThe second group concerns infinitesimals and part-whole relations.\nLike all seven of the remaining theses, these are paradoxes. Thesis 2\nis fairly clear. Geometrical points are dimensionless. The sum of two\npoints is still a point; hence points cannot be added one to another\nto form an object with thickness or length. Yet anything with\ndimensions is somehow constituted by points and divisible into\n them.[13] \nIn this group we can also include thesis 8, though with much less\nconfidence, as it is the most obscure of the ten. We will tentatively\nsuppose—following Harbsmeier (1998: 296) and Graham (1989:\n79)—that this thesis too is based on infinitesimals. The paradox\nmight then be explained in one of two ways. First, if the linked rings\nare thought of as circles, formed by points on a plane, then they have\nno thickness. They appear linked when viewed from above, but on the\nsurface of the plane nothing blocks them from being pulled apart. The\nsecond explanation extends the same idea to three dimensions. If, as\nthesis 2 suggests, two three-dimensional rings are constituted by\ndimensionless points, then they can be pulled apart: since each point\ntakes up no space, there is nothing preventing the rings from passing\nthrough each other. These interpretations are highly speculative,\nhowever. Without further contextual information, even if this sort of\nexplanation makes sense of the paradox, we have no particular reason\nto believe it is correct.  \nThe third group are based on spatial relations, including comparisons\nof size. Thesis 3, the only one also attributed to Hui Shi in the\nXunzi, can be taken to illustrate the idea that things deemed\ndifferent on one scale can be deemed the same on another. By some\nperspective or standard, such as that of the infinitely vast Great\nOne, the difference between the height of the sky and the earth or\nmountains and marshes may be insignificant. From that perspective, the\ndifferences between mountains and marshes may be only what thesis 5\ncalls “differences on a small scale,” while the two count\nas “the same” on a large scale. Thesis 6 is especially\nobscure. Thematically, we can point out that like several of the other\ntheses, it attempts to collapse a distinction, in this case between\nthe finite and infinite. As Hansen (1992: 262) points out, thesis 6,\nalong with 7 and 9, all focus on indexicals. Since the referents of\nindexicals shift from context to context, they are a vivid example of\nthe fluidity of the language-world relation and the distinction\nbetween “this” (shi) and “not”\n(fei). This suggests at least two ways to understand the\nthesis, both too speculative to be considered justified, but perhaps\nat least roughly indicative of its point. One is that if a particular\ndirection is to be south, it must have a limit, or else the\nfour directions all merge into one and south is no longer south, since\nit is not distinguished from the other three. Another possibility is\nthat since the directions of the compass are all indexical, relative\nto our point of reference, south always has a limit: the point at\nwhich we stand.  \nThesis 9 is another of those involving indexicals, in this case\n“center,” and is also very obscure. The thesis claims that\nthe center of the world is north of the northernmost state and south\nof the southernmost. Possibly the thesis is a variant of thesis 3,\nthat the sky is as low as the earth. The point there was that from the\nperspective of the infinitely vast whole, the difference between the\nheight of the sky and earth may be insignificant. Thesis 9 could be\nmaking the analogous point that the distance between Yan and Yue is\ninsignificant. Another possibility is that if space is infinitely\nlarge, then every standpoint can count as the center (Graham 1989: 79,\nafter the 3rd-century Sima Biao). Possibly this thesis is a variant of\nthe same idea as the third thesis in the Xunzi list, which\nwas that the far west and far east are “adjacent.”  \nThe fourth group deal with temporal relations. Thesis 4 is paradoxical\nbut easily intelligible. Just as from one perspective the sun is at\nits highest, from another perspective it is beginning to set. Just as\nthings are living and growing, they are also coming closer to death.\nAgain, the plurality of perspectives threatens to collapse the\ndistinction between two apparent opposites, living and dying. In\ncomparison with thesis 4, thesis 7 is extremely obscure. Clearly, it\nattempts to collapse the difference between today and yesterday or\npresent and past. Interestingly, this paradox combines spatial and\ntemporal relations, since in addition to the distinction between today\nand yesterday, there is the spatial movement from here to Yue (a state\nin the south). Hence Harbsmeier (298) and Graham (79) both propose to\ninterpret the paradox in terms of the infinite divisibility of space\nand time, suggesting that if I cross the border into Yue precisely at\nthe instant when today turns into tomorrow, the result is that I am\nsimultaneously leaving one state today and arriving in the other\ntomorrow. Another possibility is to point out that xi, the\nword rendered “yesterday,” is also commonly used to mean\nsimply “the past” or “previously.” So thesis 7\ncan be restated, “Today I go to Yue, but I arrive in the\npast.” The import of the paradox could be that all\n“arriving” is always in the past: whenever we arrive\nsomewhere, our journey is completed, or “past.”  \nAre the ten theses merely a loose collection, or are they intended to\nsupport a particular conclusion? Clearly, several of them can be taken\nto follow from thesis 5, about the relativity of sameness and\ndifference. Thesis 5 can thus be treated as a premise or guiding\nprinciple and might be the main theme. Another possibility is that the\nten are intended to culminate in the final thesis, the only one with\nmoral import, which is not relativistic. It states that heaven and\nearth—all of the natural world—form a monistic unit, and\nso our moral caring should extend to all things. The question of the\noverall significance of the set in effect boils down to the question\nof whether, given the overall context, thesis 10 has a privileged\nstatus over thesis 5 and the others. From Hu Shih (1922) on, many\ninterpreters have suggested it\n does.[14]\n Clearly, the textual evidence is so sparse that there is no question\nof deciding the issue conclusively. However, there are at least three\ngood reasons for favoring the monistic interpretation. First, the\nplacement of thesis 10 at the end makes it natural to read it as the\nconclusion or main theme. Second, not only is thesis 10 placed last,\nit is the only thesis with ethical significance. A plausible\nexplanation is that whoever arranged the ten theses saw the ethical\nview as emerging out of the others. Third, and most important, unlike\ntheses 1 and 5, thesis 10 seems to make an absolutist claim. If it\nwere parallel to theses 1 and 5, we might expect it to present a\nperspectival claim, such as that heaven and earth are in one respect\none body and in another respect many. But instead it simply asserts\nthat they are one. \nTentatively adopting the monistic interpretation, then, we can\nreconstruct the basic “Hui Shi view” roughly as\nfollows: \nSeveral comments about this view are in order. First, the thrust of\nthe view is not that distinctions are “unreal,” in the\nsense of being illusory, false, or merely an aspect of appearance, not\nunderlying reality. It is just the opposite: countless different\nschemes of distinctions are all real, with the result that\nnone are privileged. Since no scheme is privileged, the\n“neutral” or “default” view—that of the\nworld in itself—is monistic, drawing no distinctions at all. On\nthe other hand, another way of understanding “real” is as\nmeaning “fixed by nature itself.” If we take\n“real” this way, we can agree with Hansen (262) that the\nHui Shi position adopts a “non-realist” attitude toward\ndistinctions: it holds that no single scheme of distinctions is fixed\nby the world. However, if the monistic interpretation is correct, then\nthe Hui Shi position is realist in this sense with respect to\nthe “one unit” or “Great One,” the “null\nscheme” consisting of the absence of any distinctions. That\nscheme is fixed by nature itself.  \nSecond, the Hui Shi view does not hold that, as Graham proposes,\n“Since division leads to contradiction don’t divide at\nall” (1989: 79). Far from regarding contradictions as a problem,\nit embraces them. It explains them by appeal to constantly shifting\nperspectives or standards for distinguishing same and different.  \nSince Hui Shi’s monism might recall that of the Eleatics (cf. Hu\n1922, Graham 1989), it is worth clarifying the similarities and\ndifferences between the two. The similarities are superficial: both\ndevelop a form of absolute monism grounded in reflection about\nlanguage or thought and its relation to reality. But the arguments for\nand consequences of the two views are fundamentally different. The\nstarting point for Parmenides’s monism is reflection on the\nconcept of ‘being’ or ‘the real’, specifically\nthe claim that what is real must necessarily be. From this he draws\nthe conclusion that what is real must be ungenerable, imperishable,\nindivisible, and unchanging. Thus, in contrast to the eternal,\nunchanging world intelligible through reason, the inconstant, changing\nworld of everyday perceptual experience is in some sense not\n“real.” By contrast, the Hui Shi view starts from a kind\nof radical perspectivalism about distinctions. It argues that since no\nstandard for drawing distinctions has a privileged, absolute status,\nthe only way to draw distinctions given by reality itself is not to\ndraw any at all. Reality is not regarded as indivisible and\nunchanging, nor is the changing world of sense experience in any sense\n“unreal.” Rather, reality is divisible in indefinitely\nmany ways. All of the resulting distinctions are “real” in\nthe sense that the features of things on which they are based indeed\nexist. The distinctions are not delusory. The problem is that neither\nare they privileged or fixed: they can be replaced by alternative\nschemes of distinctions. The only privileged scheme is monism, drawing\nno distinctions at\n all.[15] \nIs this move from perspectivalism about distinctions to a kind of\nmonism justified? Hansen argues that it is not. His interpretation of\nthe argument is that it moves from the claim that we cannot know what\ndistinctions are ultimately real to the conclusion that no\ndistinctions are real (262). The move is via the hidden,\nverificationist premise that a distinction exists only if we can know\nthat it does. Hence Hansen suggests that the Hui Shi view is based on\na form of “verification fallacy,” which confuses what we\ncan know with what is real (263).  \nHansen is probably right to hold that monism does not follow validly\nfrom Hui Shi’s premises. All that follows is that no one scheme\nfor drawing distinctions can be justified absolutely: Justification\nmust always be contextual. But it seems unlikely that the text commits\nthe fallacy he describes. The ten theses do not mention epistemic\nissues. Certainly there is no explicit skeptical claim that we cannot\nknow which distinctions are ultimately real. Rather, there is only the\nsuggestion, in thesis 5, that there may be uncountably many ways of\ndrawing distinctions, set alongside a series of examples that collapse\nconventional distinctions. So, rather than committing a\nverificationist fallacy, it may be that the Hui Shi view is simply\ninconsistent. On the basis of thesis 5, Hui Shi should hold any scheme\nof distinctions may be deemed “admissible” or\n“inadmissible,” by reference to some standard or other,\nyet no scheme is privileged, including the scheme that\nconsists in drawing no distinctions at all. Instead, if the monistic\ninterpretation is correct, he mistakenly takes the “Great\nOne” or “one unit” view to be an exception to this\n rule.[16]\n The mistake is understandable, since drawing no distinctions at all\nmight seem to be a way of circumventing the perspectival nature of\ndistinctions. It is not, however, since strictly speaking it remains\none among other ways of drawing distinctions.  \n“Under Heaven” lists 21 more paradoxes, which “the\ndisputers used to respond to Hui Shi without end for their whole\nlives.” All lack explanations, making some impenetrably obscure.\nFor interpretations of a handful of the relatively tractable ones,\nalong with speculations about a few of the others, see the following\nsupplementary document:  \nDespite their obscurity, at least some of the theses attributed to Hui\nShi and a few of the other paradoxes and sophistries collected in\n“Under Heaven” probably grow out of legitimate theoretical\nissues and are of genuine philosophical interest. By contrast, when we\nturn to Gongsun Long, we encounter a disputer who may have been\ndevoted to sophistry purely for sophistry’s sake. We cannot be\nsure of this, of course, but what we can say is that Gongsun Long won\nfame by advocating a claim that any competent speaker of his language\nwould have judged obviously false, namely that “a white horse is\nnot a horse.”  \nGongsun Long (c. 320–250 B.C.E.) was a retainer to the Lord of\nPingyuan (d. 252 B.C.E.) in the northern state of Zhao. Anecdotes\nabout him are found in the Zhuangzi and The Annals of\nLü Buwei, in which he is depicted advising King Hui of Zhao\n(r. 298–266 B.C.E.) against war (18.1, 18.7) and in disputation\nwith Kong Chuan, a descendent of Confucius, at the home of the Lord of\nPingyuan (18.5). He is mentioned in “Under Heaven” as a\nleading disputer and in the Han dynasty Records of the Grand\nHistorian (Book 74) as undertaking disputation about the hard and\nwhite and the same and different. Intriguingly, the Annals\ndepicts him citing the Mohist principle of “all-inclusive\ncare” (jian ai) to King Hui. Together with his anti-war\nstance, this suggests that he was influenced by and may once have\nnumbered among the Mohists. The Xunzi does not criticize him\nby name but does cite a version of his white horse sophism in a list\nof incorrect uses of names (22.3).  \nIn one anecdote, Gongsun Long is shown applying his cleverness to help\nrescue a state from attack. Zhao, his state, had formed a treaty with\nQin to assist each other in anything either wished to do. Qin\nproceeded to attack Wei, Zhao’s neighbor. Zhao wished to rescue\nWei, but Qin sent an envoy to the king of Zhao to complain.  \nAnother anecdote is valuable for what it suggests about the nature of\nGongsun Long’s disputations. Gongsun Long debates with an\nopponent, Kong Chuan, at the residence of the Lord of Pingyuan. With\ngreat cleverness, he argues for the claim that “John Doe has\nthree ears.” (In Chinese, plurals are unmarked, so the sophist\ncan assert of any normal two-eared person, such as John Doe, that he\n“has ear(s),” and also that he has a left ear and a right\near. Therefore he has “three ears.”) Eventually, Kong\nChuan is unable to reply.  \nGongsun Long’s disputation is perceived as plainly not fitting\n“reality” (shi, also the “stuff”\nspoken of). It is an exercise in cleverness, a kind of trick\nperformance in which the disputer attempts to make a case for a claim\nthat everyone knows does not fit its object. Harbsmeier has rightly\nemphasized this point in arguing that further attention to Gongsun\nLong’s social and historical context is needed if we are to\nunderstand the white horse sophism properly (1998: 300–301). He\nsuggests that Gongsun Long probably belonged to a class of\nentertainers at Chinese courts who performed various skills or tricks.\nHis was to prove, over any and all objections, that a white horse is\nnot a horse. His sophistries may have been intended primarily as a\nkind of light entertainment, not as expressions of a principled\nphilosophical position. They touch on philosophical issues, such as\ndiscriminating the same and different, but there is no reason to\nexpect them to demonstrate cogent reasoning based on a coherent\nsemantic or logical theory. The truth may be just the opposite: They\ncould have been intended to be whimsical and amusing, even comical.\nThe “White Horse” dialogue may be a record of the sort of\narguments Gongsun Long would offer in his performances.  \nThe Han History lists Gongsun Long as the author of fourteen\nscrolls of writings. The extant text called Gongsun Longzi\ncomprises only five short dialogues and an introduction, which is\nobviously of relatively late date. A. C. Graham argued persuasively\nthat three of the dialogues are not Warring States texts, but much\nlater forgeries pieced together partly from misunderstood bits of the\nMohist Dialectics. Probably only the “White\nHorse,” the essay “Indicating Things,” and a bit of\nanother dialogue are genuine pre-Han\n texts.[17]\n We will look at the first of these below (the second is treated in a\nsupplement at the end of this section).  \nThe Gongsun Longzi has inspired a vast exegetical literature\nin both Asian and European languages, with no consensus in sight as to\nthe significance and theoretical basis of its arguments. The\ninterpretation proposed here must be considered only one of several\npotentially defensible approaches (others are noted below). In the\ncase of the “White Horse” dialogue, the text is generally\nclear enough. (“Indicating Things,” on the other hand,\nappears to be intentionally obscure.) The scholarly controversy\nconcerns what theory and implicit premises to ascribe to the text so\nthat the arguments come out as cogent defenses of a reasonable\nposition. As Graham says, the interpretive obstacle is “the\ndifficulty of finding an angle of approach from which the arguments\nwill make sense.…The arguments are clear, yet the first seems\nan obvious non sequitur…and the rest seem to assume an\nelementary confusion of identity and class membership” (1989:\n82). Introducing his own interpretation, he says, “No one has\nyet proposed a reading of the dialogue as a consecutive demonstration\nwhich does not turn it into an improbable medley of gross fallacies\nand logical subtleties” (1990: 193). Building on\nHarbsmeier’s insight that the historical context of Gongsun\nLong’s disputations has been insufficiently appreciated, we may\nsuspect Graham’s remarks signal interpretive charity gone too\nfar. Given what information we have about Gongsun\nLong—Harbsmeier’s considerations, the general reputation\nof the disputers for flippant wordplay, the denunciation of Gongsun\nLong in the “Under Heaven” essay, and most important, the\nfact that his contemporaries took his most famous claim to be patently\nfalse—we should expect the text to be a “medley\nof gross fallacies and logical subtleties,” roughly a Chinese\nanalogue to the subtle, fallacious, and deeply amusing arguments of\nLewis Carroll.  \nNone of this means that interpreting “White Horse” is\npointless. We can learn about the serious practice of disputation by\nstudying what is in effect a spoof of disputation, just as an\nanthropologist can learn about a culture by studying its humor. But we\nshould not expect the Gongsun Longzi to present rigorous\narguments or defend well-developed theses of philosophical substance.\nIn this case, interpretive charity may direct us to look not for true\nclaims supported by sound reasoning, but for whimsical claims defended\nby bewildering, even madcap arguments.  \nThe “White Horse Discourse” has spawned nearly as many\ninterpretations as there are interpreters. One early, influential\ninterpretation took its theme to be denying the identity of the\nuniversals ‘horse’ and ‘white horse’ (Fung\n1958, Cheng 1983). There is now a fairly broad consensus, at least\namong European and American scholars, that the text is unlikely to\nconcern universals, since no ancient Chinese philosopher held a\nrealist doctrine of universals. Other interpretations have taken it to\ndeal with kind and identity relations (Cikoski 1975, Harbsmeier 1998),\npart-whole relations (Hansen 1983, Graham 1989), how the extensions of\nphrases vary from those of their constituent terms (Hansen 1992), and\neven the use/mention distinction (Thompson 1995). For examples of\nother recent approaches, see Indraccolo (2017), Fung (2020b), Jiang\n(2020), and Zhou (2020). \nA satisfactory interpretation must fit into the discursive context\nestablished by the Mohists, Xunzi, and The Annals of Lü\nBuwei, cohere with the concerns we identified in discussing the\nbackground\n (Section 1)\n and main themes\n (Section 2)\n of the disputers’ inquiries, and take into account what other\nearly texts tell us about Gongsun Long. Since we know he was an\nintellectual prankster, we cannot assume the texts will present cogent\narguments for a well-reasoned philosophical position. If we find them\npresenting plainly intelligible but specious arguments, we should take\nthese at face value, rather than seek esoteric explanations. Given the\ncontext of pre-Han thought, we should expect the text to toy with the\nproblem of distinguishing “same” from\n“different,” potentially touching on identity, part-whole,\nand kind relations. And given the disputers’ association with\nthe theme of “hard and white,” we should expect that the\ntext might attempt to treat inseparable features of things as if they\nwere separable parts. A number of interpretations have the potential\nto meet these requirements, including interpretations involving\npart-whole relations, scope ambiguity, kind relations, and identity\nrelations. To decide between them, then, we need to look at the\ndetails of the text. “White Horse” contains five arguments\nfor its thesis that “White horse is not horse.” We may\nfind that some interpretive approaches work better for some of the\nfive, some for others.  \nOne further anecdote about Gongsun Long—found in two texts from\nlater eras, the introductory chapter of the Gongsun Longzi\nand the Kong Congzi—provides useful context for the\ndialogue. In response to a request from Kong Chuan that he abandon his\nthesis that a white horse is not a horse, Gongsun Long defends it by\nclaiming that Confucius himself accepted the same thesis. He cites a\nversion of a story also found in the The Annals of Lü\nBuwei (1.4), in which the King of Chu loses his bow. \nIn one version of the story, Kong Chuan replies that when Confucius\nomits the ‘Chu’, he is broadening the scope of the\nreferent, not claiming that Chu people are not people.  \nAs Harbsmeier points out (302), since this story appears in the\nintroduction to the Gongsun Longzi, it suggests that the\nbook’s ancient editors themselves took the theme to be how the\nscope of the extension of a noun such as ‘person’ or\n‘horse’ varies when modified by an adjective such as\n‘Chu’ or ‘white’. The main theme is unlikely\nto be part-whole relations, since it is unlikely that the noun phrase\n‘Chu person’ was construed as referring to a whole\ncomprising two parts, the state of Chu and a person.  \nThis preparatory discussion in hand, let’s look at the arguments\nin the “White Horse Discourse.” The text consists of a\nseries of exchanges between a sophist and an objector, who defends the\ncommonsense view that white horses are horses. For brevity, we will\ntranslate and discuss only the sophist’s arguments, not the\nobjector’s. To capture the flavor of the Chinese, we will render\ncertain phrases in pidgin English, omitting articles and plurals. So\nwe will translate the main thesis as “White horse is not\nhorse,” variously interpretable as “a white horse is not a\nhorse,” “white horses are not horses,” “a\nwhite horse is not an exemplar of the kind horse,” or\n“the kind white horse is not identical with the kind\n horse.”[19] \nAt first glance, it is not at all clear how the premises are expected\nto support the conclusion. Here we should recall that the argument is\nprobably intended to be perplexing and open to various\ninterpretations, the better to confuse and mystify the audience. With\nthis caveat in mind, one plausible reading is that ‘white\nhorse’ names both the color and the shape of white horses, not\nonly the shape. So ‘white horse’ names something different\nfrom what ‘horse’ names. Hence white horse, the extension\nof ‘white horse’, is not the same as (identical to) horse,\nthe extension of ‘horse’. \nThis argument can also be understood as “separating hard and\nwhite,” in that the shape and color of white horses, which are\nin fact inseparable, are treated as two separate things. If we grant\nthe sophist that naming the color isn’t naming the shape, we\nhave already allowed him to separate shape from color. Referring to\nthe color is of course different from referring to the shape. But\nnaming the object with the color is just naming the object with the\nshape. Hence we should reject the third premise and insist that naming\nthe color is naming the\n shape.[20] \nThis argument is fairly clearly not about part-whole relations, nor\nabout separating hard from white. The sophist plainly construes\n“white horse is horse” as “white horse is identical\nto horse.” In Chinese as in English, the sentence ‘White\nhorses are horses’ can be interpreted as predicating\n‘horse’ of white horses, making the true claim that the\nthings picked out by ‘white horse’ are all among those\npicked out by ‘horse’, or it can be interpreted as\nexpressing an identity, making the false claim that exactly the same\nthings are picked out by ‘white horse’ as by\n‘horse’. The argument trades on this ambiguity. Because we\nknow that modifying a noun narrows the scope of its extension, when we\nhear “white horses are horses,” we naturally apply the\nprinciple of charity, assume the speaker is not saying something\nobviously false, and take the relation in question to be predication,\nnot identity. But the sophist insists on interpreting the sentence as\nan identity. Notice that the sophist implicitly applies a principle\nroughly like Leibniz’s law of indiscernibility of identicals. He\nassumes that if two things are identical, they will share all their\nfeatures, and one can be substituted for the other in any context.\nSince what can be “delivered” in answer to a request for\n“white horse” is different from what can be\n“delivered” for “horse,” white horse is not\n horse.[21] \n“White” is not “horse” because\n‘horse’ alone doesn’t pick out the white ones; only\n‘white’ does. The sophist takes it as obvious that\n“horse” combined with “white” is not simply\n“horse.” Here he is “separating hard and\nwhite,” in that he explicitly treats “white” and\n“horse” (that is, the shape of the animal) as two things\nthat are combined to form something more than, and different from, a\nhorse. The argument again turns on construing “White horse is\nhorse” as the claim that the kind white horse is\nidentical to the kind horse. \nHere again the argument is based on construing “White/brown\nhorse is horse” as an identity claim. Recall that in early\nChinese thought the same/different relation may refer to either\nidentity or kind relations. Moreover, in classical Chinese, both types\nof relations are expressed in the same syntactic form, the Chinese\nanalogue of ‘A is (not) B’. So when the\ncontext is unambiguous, it is perfectly legitimate to express the fact\nthat A is different from B by saying\n“A is not B.” Taking advantage of this\ngrammatical feature, the sophist can move legitimately from the\nuncontroversial claim that having a horse is different from (that is,\nnot identical to) having a brown horse to the intermediate claim that\nbrown horse is different from (not identical to) horse and then not so\nlegitimately to the conclusion that brown horse is not horse. The\nconclusion indeed follows, but only if we allow the sophist to\nconstrue “is not” as “is not identical to.”\nNotice that this argument seems to involve neither part-whole\nrelations nor separating hard from white (that is, shape from color).\nAnalogy plays a central role, however, as the argument is based on the\nanalogy between brown and white horses.  \nThe rhetorical flourish at the end of the argument is typical of\nWarring States disputation. To emphasize that a claim is inconsistent\nor contradictory, disputers would habitually cite contradictory or\nimpossible things as analogies (Leslie 1964).  \nThe sophist first “separates hard and white,” establishing\nthat the shape “horse” is not the same thing as the color\n“white.” The color alone does not specify the location\nthat is white; saying “white horse” does. Therefore horse,\nthe shape, is not white, the color. Indeed, horse specifies no color\nat all. White horse, on the other hand, does specify a color. So again\nthe sophist has shown that white horse and horse have distinct\nfeatures. Thus white horse is not (identical to) horse.  \nTo sum up, the most natural way to read the text is as repeatedly\nequivocating between a statement of identity and one that predicates a\nmore general term of the objects denoted by a less general term. The\nsophist refuses to distinguish the true statement that “[the\nkind] white horse is not [identical to the kind] horse” from the\nfalse “white horse is not [of the kind] horse.” The\nnatural way to interpret “White horse is horse” is as the\nlatter, but the sophist insists on interpreting it as the former. In a\nfew places, the sophist distinguishes the shape of the horse from the\ncolor in a way that probably corresponds to “separating hard and\nwhite.”  \nA related explanation of the sophist’s view is that he confuses\nterms that refer at different levels of generality, or, equivalently,\nsimply refuses to recognize that terms can refer at different levels\nof generality. Xunzi, whose career largely overlapped with Gongsun\nLong’s, introduced the concept of a “common name”\n(gong ming), or general term, which may refer to things at\ndifferent levels of generality (22.2f). Xunzi pointed out that\nsometimes we refer to things by a single name, such as\n‘horse’, and sometimes, to communicate more precisely, we\nuse a “compound” name (what we would think of as a noun\nphrase), such as ‘white horse’. Provided one of these two\nkinds of names is more general, we can use both without their\ninterfering with each other. This is roughly the same point Kong Chuan\nmade in insisting that ‘horse’ always refers to all horses\nand that adding ‘white’ to it merely narrows its reference\nby specifying the horses’ color. In each case, the animals\ndenoted by ‘horse’ are still horses. “White\nHorse” deliberately ignores this point.  \nHansen (1983, 1992) has proposed an interesting account of the\nphilosophical significance of the “White Horse” dialogue.\nThe simplest early Chinese model of the language-world relation was\n“one name, one thing,” according to which all names refer\nat the same level of generality. Given the Chinese concern with\n“correcting names,” so that communication can proceed\neffectively and language can guide action reliably, a natural view\nwould be that ideally each name or phrase should consistently denote\none and only one sort of thing. But as the Mohists noticed, when names\nare joined to form phrases, their reference may shift in unexpected\nways. In Chinese, the phrases ‘oxen-and-horses’ (niu\nma) and ‘white horse’ (bai ma) appear to\nhave the same syntax. But in compounds of the first type, the\nextension of the component nouns remains exactly the same as when the\nnouns are used singly: the extension of ‘oxen-and-horses’\nis simply the sum of the extensions of ‘oxen’ and\n‘horses’. In compounds of the second type—the\n“as hard to white” type—on the other hand, the\nextension of the component words changes. The extension of\n‘white horse’ is the intersection, not the sum, of white\nthings and horses. The extension of the words ‘white’ and\n‘horse’ as used in the compound is thus different from\nwhat it is when they are used alone. This raises a serious problem for\nthe one-name-one-thing view. The Mohists discovered the problem and\ntook steps toward a solution. Xunzi finally solved it by explicitly\nrejecting the one-name-one-thing principle and recognizing that terms\nrefer at different levels of generality. The approach implied by\n“White Horse,” Hansen suggests, would address the problem\nby retaining the one-name-one-thing principle and reforming our\nlanguage use, so that all names pick out exactly the same portion of\nreality in all contexts, whether used singly or compounded into\nphrases. Since the extension of names changes when they are combined\nto form compounds of the “as hard to white” type, a\nproponent of this view must insist that the objects denoted by such\ncompounds be treated as distinct from the objects denoted by either of\ntheir constituent names: white horses are neither white nor horse, but\na distinct sort of thing. This “solution” is absurd, of\ncourse. But moving beyond the one-name-one-thing model and explaining\nexactly why this is absurd was a legitimate philosophical\npuzzle at the\n time.[23] \nThe other complete, genuine essay attributed to Gongsun Long is the\nnear-impenetrable “Discourse on Indicating Things.” For a\ndiscussion of this text, see the supplementary document: \nAmong Warring States texts, only two show any familiarity with the\ndetails of Hui Shi’s and Gongsun Long’s theses. (The\n“Under Heaven” book of the Zhuangzi, the major\nsource for our discussion of Hui Shi, dates probably from the first\nfew decades of the Han dynasty.) One is the Xunzi, which as\nwe saw ascribes a list of seven paradoxes to Hui Shi and Deng Xi, as\nwell as alluding elsewhere (22.3) to the white horse sophism. The\nother is the famous “Discourse on Equalizing Things,” Book\n2 of the Zhuangzi, though the text does not attribute the\ntheses to Hui Shi or Gongsun Long by name. “Equalizing\nThings” is critical of the disputers’ ideas and in one\npassage explicitly criticizes Hui\n Shi.[24]\n But it also praises his intelligence and is not downright hostile\ntoward him, as Xunzi is.  \n“Equalizing Things” alludes to versions of at least four\nof Hui Shi’s theses and to both the white horse and the\n“indicating” sophisms. “Today go to Yue and arrive\nyesterday” is cited as an analogy for something impossible or\ncontradictory. “Just as it is alive, it is dying” is used\nfor rhetorical effect to support the point that judgments of what is\n“this” (shi) and “not this”\n(fei) arise together, are relative to each other, and can be\nreversed or shifted. After arguing that anything can be deemed\n“this” or “not this,” the text critiques\nGongsun Long:  \nInstead of using a white horse as an example to show that it’s\npossible to treat some horses as not of the kind horse, it\nwould be simpler and clearer to use something of another kind, such as\nan ox, and show that some horses can be treated as “the\nsame” as that thing and different from other horses. For\ninstance, draft horses could be deemed “the same” as oxen,\ngrouped together with them as draft animals, and distinguished as\ndifferent from riding horses or racehorses. For that matter, anything\nand everything can be summed into a whole and deemed a single\n“indicated” or “horse.” The text’s point\nis to trivialize Gongsun Long’s theses. For some purpose or\nother, by some standard or other, white horse can indeed be considered\ndifferent from horse. But in light of the pragmatic stance adopted by\n“Equalizing Things,” there is nothing puzzling or\nremarkable about this.  \nThese allusions place “Equalizing Things” firmly within\nthe intellectual milieu of the disputers. Indeed, the text argues\nexplicitly for a view closely related to one of their signature\nthemes—“deeming so the not-so, admissible the\ninadmissible.”  \nStill, the text’s stance is fundamentally critical of Hui Shi\nand Gongsun Long. In a trenchant critique, the writer mocks several\nHui Shi-style theses, including spatial and temporal paradoxes and a\nversion of the “one unit” view:  \nHaving already become one, can you still say anything? Having already\ncalled it “one,” can you succeed in not saying\nanything? One and the saying make two; two and the one make three.\nGoing on from here, even an expert calculator can’t get to the\nend of it, much less an ordinary person! So in moving from nothing to\nsomething, we arrive at three; how much worse in moving from something\nto something! Better not to move any particular way at all, but simply\nadapt what we deem shi (right) to the particular situation.\n(cf. Graham 1981: 56) \nThe text questions the coherence of the “everything is\none” view. To treat the myriad things and oneself as\n“one” is already to distinguish them from nothing, on the\none hand, and from what is not one, on the other. Indeed, the\nproponent of the “one unit” view cannot even state his\nposition consistently. Merely to say that everything is\n“one” is to recognize something else besides the one,\nnamely our statement pointing it out. The one and the name we give it\nor what we say about it already make two. And as soon as we notice\nthat we’ve got two, we’ve already got three—the one,\nwhat we said about it, and the “two” comprising the one\nand what we said. The playful mockery has an underlying point. The\n“all is one” view is not more “real” or more\njustified than other schemes of distinctions, and it is useless as a\nsolution to the problem of what scheme of distinctions to adopt in\nguiding life and action. It yields no normative guidance—not\neven Hui Shi’s “comprehensively care for all\nthings.” Instead of attempting to find the\n“absolute” or “real” scheme of action-guiding\ndistinctions, our energy would be better spent simply by guiding and\njustifying our actions contextually, responding to the needs of each\nparticular situation as it arises.  \nLike Hui Shi, then, the writer of “Equalizing Things”\nagrees that distinctions can be drawn in indefinitely many ways. It is\nalso true that if no distinctions are drawn, things in themselves\n“connect into one.” Yet focusing one’s attention\neither on establishing some particular scheme of distinctions or on\nthe “one” shows an equal lack of insight.\nDisputation—whether in defense of Confucian ritual, Mohist\ninclusive care, the Great One, or sophistical paradoxes—is\nbeside the point. Issues addressed in disputation cannot and need not\nbe settled in order to live well. In fact, they may even interfere\nwith the conduct of a good life. When we perform activities at which\nwe genuinely excel—those whose performance engenders the deeply\nsatisfying experience of feeling fully at home in the world—what\nguides us is not knowledge of fixed, explicit standards of\nshi/fei, nor identification with the “one.” It is\na combination of skill and a kind of uncodifiable knack for adapting\nto the particular situation.  \nBy contrast, wearing out one’s wits deliberately deeming things\none, as Hui Shi does, instead of simply seeing and making use of the\ninnumerable ways they can be taken to be the “same,” is\nlike forcefully affirming that seven equals four plus three without\nalso allowing that it equals three plus four (cf. Graham 54). It is a\nway of grasping part of the right view, but darkly, without insight.\n \nAs for Hui Shi, “Equalizing Things” concludes, “His\nknow-how almost reached the pinnacle, so his reputation carried on\nuntil later years. It was only in that he was good at it [disputation]\nthat he was different from other people. Because he was good at it, he\ndesired to clarify it. It was not the sort of thing that can be\nclarified, yet he tried to clarify it. Thus he spent his whole life in\nthe obscurity of hard and\n white.”[25]","contact.mail":"cjfraser@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
