Philosophers since the 1920s have argued about the\nsignificance of “logical construction” as a method in\nanalytic philosophy and proposed various ways of interpreting\nRussell’s notion. Some were inspired to develop their own\nprojects by examples of constructions. Russell’s notion of\nlogical construction influenced both Carnap’s project of\nconstructing the physical world from experience and Quine’s\nnotion of explication, and was a model for the use of set\ntheoretic reconstructions in formal philosophy later in the twentieth\ncentury.\n\n\nIt was only when looking back on his work, in the programmatic 1924\nessay “Logical Atomism”, that Russell first described\nvarious logical definitions and philosophical analyses as\n“logical constructions”. He listed as examples the\nFrege-Russell definition of numbers as classes, the theory of definite\ndescriptions, the construction of matter from sense data and then\nseries, ordinal numbers and real numbers. Because of the particular\nnature of Russell’s use of “contextual” definitions\nof expressions for classes, and the distinctive character of the\ntheory of definite descriptions, he regularly called the expressions\nfor such entities “incomplete symbols” and the entities\nthemselves “logical fictions”.\n\n\nLogical constructions differ in whether they involve explicit\ndefinitions or contextual definitions, and in the extent to which\ntheir result should be described as showing that the constructed\nobject is a mere “fiction”. Russell’s 1901\ndefinition of numbers as classes of equinumerous classes is\nstraightforwardly a case of constructing one sort of entity as a class\nof others with an explicit definition. This was followed by the theory\nof definite descriptions in 1905 and the “no-classes”\ntheory for defining classes in Principia Mathematica in 1910,\nboth of which involved the distinctive technique of contextual\ndefinition. In a contextual definition apparent singular terms (either\ndefinite descriptions or class terms) are eliminated through rules for\ndefining the entire sentences in which they occur. Constructions which\nare like those using contextual definitions are generally called\n“incomplete symbols”, while those like the theory of\nclasses are called “fictions.” Russell included the\nconstruction of matter, space and time as classes of sense data at the\nend of his 1924 list. The main problem for interpreting the notion of\nlogical construction is to understand what these various examples have\nin common, and how the construction of matter is comparable to either\nof the early constructions of numbers as classes or the theory of\ndefinite descriptions and “no-classes” theory of classes.\nNone of the expressions “fiction”, “incomplete\nsymbol” or even “constructed from” seems appropriate\nfor an analysis of the fundamental features of the familiar physical\nworld and the material objects that occupy it.\n\nThe earliest construction on Russell’s 1924 list is the famous\n“Frege/Russell definition” of numbers as classes of\nequinumerous classes from 1901 (Russell 1993, 320). The definition\nfollows the example of the definitions of the notions of limit and\ncontinuity that were proposed for the calculus in the preceding\ncentury. Russell did not rest content with adopting the Peano axioms\nas the basis for the theory of the natural numbers and then showing\nhow the properties of the numbers could be logically deduced from\nthose axioms. Instead, he defined the basic notions of\n“number” , “successor” and “0” and\nproposed to show, with carefully chosen definitions of their basic\nnotions in terms of logical notions, that those axioms could be\nderived from principles of logic alone.  \nRussell defined natural numbers as classes of equinumerous classes.\nAny  pair , a class with two members, can be put into a one to\none correspondence with any other, hence all pairs are \nequinumerous. The number two is then identified with the\nclass of all pairs. The relation between equinumerous classes when\nthere is such a one to one mapping relating them is called\n“similarity”. Similarity is defined solely in terms of\nlogical notions of quantifiers and identity. With the natural numbers\nso defined, Peano axioms can be derived by logical means alone. After\nnatural numbers, Russell adds “series, ordinal numbers and real\nnumbers” (1924, 166) to his list of constructions, and then\nconcludes with the construction of matter. \nRussell credits A. N. Whitehead with the solution to the problem of\nthe relation of sense data to physics that he adopted in 1914: \nI have been made aware of the importance of this problem by my friend\nand collaborator Dr Whitehead, to whom are due almost all the\ndifferences between the views advocated here and those suggested in\nThe Problems of Philosophy. I owe to him the definition of\npoints, and the suggestion for the treatment of instants and\n“things,” and the whole conception of the world of physics\nas a construction rather than an inference. (Russell\n1914b, vi) \nIt is only later, in an essay in which Russell reflected on his\nphilosophy that he also described his earlier logical proposals as\n“logical constructions.” The first specific formulation of\nthis method of replacing inference with construction as a general\nmethod in philosophy is in the essay “Logical\nAtomism”: \nOne very important heuristic maxim which Dr. Whitehead and I found, by\nexperience, to be applicable in mathematical logic, and have since\napplied to various other fields, is a form of Occam’s Razor.\nWhen some set of supposed entities has neat logical properties, it\nturns out, in a great many instances, that the supposed entities can\nbe replaced by purely logical structures composed of entities which\nhave not such neat properties. In that case, in interpreting a body of\npropositions hitherto believed to be about the supposed entities, we\ncan substitute the logical structures without altering any of the\ndetail of the body of propositions in question. This is an economy,\nbecause entities with neat logical properties are always inferred, and\nif the propositions in which they occur can be interpreted without\nmaking this inference, the ground for the inference fails, and our\nbody of propositions is secured against the need of a doubtful step.\nThe principle may be stated in the form: ‘Whenever possible,\nsubstitute constructions out of known entities for inferences to\nunknown entities’. (Russell 1924, 160) \nRussell was referring to logical constructions in this frequently\nquoted passage from his Introduction to Mathematical\nPhilosophy. He objects to introducing entities with implicit\ndefinitions, that is, as being those things that obey certain axioms\nor “postulates”: \nThe method of ‘postulating’ what we want has many\nadvantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest\ntoil. Let us leave them to others and proceed with our honest toil.\n(Russell 1919, 71) \nHe charges that we need a demonstration that there are any objects\nwhich satisfy those axioms.The “toil” here is the work of\nformulating definitions of the numbers so that they can be shown to\nsatisfy the axioms using logical inference alone. \nThe description of logical constructions as “incomplete\nsymbols” derives from the use of contextual definitions that\nprovide an analysis or substitute for each sentence in which a defined\nsymbol may occur. The definition does not give an explicit definition,\nsuch as an equation with the defined expression on one side that is\nidentified with a definiendum on the other, or a universal\nstatement giving necessary and sufficient conditions for the\napplication of the term in isolation. The connection between being a\nfiction and expressed by an “incomplete symbol” can be\nseen in Russell’s constructions of finite cardinal and ordinal\nnumbers by means of the theory of classes. That\n“no-classes” theory, via the contextual definitions for\nclass terms, makes all the numbers “incomplete symbols”,\nand so numbers can be seen as “logical fictions”. \nThe notions of construction and logical fiction appear together in\nthis account from Russell’s “Philosophy of Logical\nAtomism” lectures: \nYou find that a certain thing which has been set up as a metaphysical\nentity can either be assumed dogmatically to be real, and then you\nwill have no possible argument either for its reality or against its\nreality; or, instead of doing that, you can construct a logical\nfiction having the same formal properties, or rather having formally\nanalogous formal properties to those of the supposed metaphysical\nentity and itself composed of empirically given things, and the\nlogical fiction can be substituted for your supposed metaphysical\nentity and will fulfill all the scientific purposes that anyone can\ndesire. (Russell 1918, 144) \nIncomplete symbols, descriptions, classes and logical fictions are\nidentified with each other and then with the “familiar objects\nof daily life” in the following passage from earlier in the\nlectures: \nThere are a great many other sorts of incomplete symbols besides\ndescriptions. There are classes… and relations taken in\nextension, and so on. Such aggregations of symbols are really the same\nas what I call “logical fictions”, and they embrace\npractically all the familiar objects of daily life: tables, chairs,\nPiccadilly, Socrates, and so on. Most of them are either classes, or\nseries, or series of classes. In any case they are all incomplete\nsymbols, i.e. they are aggregations that only have a meaning in use\nand do not have any meaning in themselves. (Russell 1918, 122) \nIn what follows these various features of logical constructions will\nbe disentangled. The result appears to be a connected series of\nanalyses sharing at least a family resemblance with each other. The\ncommon feature is that in each case some formal or “neat”\nproperties of objects that had to be postulated in axioms before could\nnow be derived as logical consequences of definitions. The replaced\nentities are variously “fictions”, “incomplete\nsymbols” or simply “constructions” depending on the\nform that the definitions take. \nIt would be a mistake to see Russell’s logical constructions as\nthe product of the converse operation of a method that begins with\nlogical analysis. Analysis was indeed the distinctive method of\nRussell’s realist and atomistic philosophy with the method of\nconstruction appearing only later. Russell’s new philosophy was\nself-consciously in opposition to the Hegelianism prevailing in\nphilosophy at Cambridge at the end of the nineteenth century (Russell\n1956, 11–13). Russell first needed to defend the process of\nanalysis, and to argue against the view of the idealists that complex\nentities are in fact “organic unities” and that any\nanalysis of these unities loses something, as the slogan was\n“analysis is falsification”. (1903, §439) The subject\nof our analysis is reality, rather than merely our own ideas:  \nAll complexity is conceptual in the sense that it is due to a whole\ncapable of logical analysis, but is real in the sense that it has no\ndependence on the mind, but only upon the nature of the object. Where\nthe mind can distinguish elements, there must be different elements to\ndistinguish; though, alas! there are often different elements which\nthe mind does not distinguish. (1903, §439) \nAs ultimate constituents of reality are what is discovered by logical\nanalysis, logical construction cannot be the converse operation, for\nundoing the analysis by putting things back together only returns us\nto the complex entities with which we began. What then is the point of\nconstructing what has already been analyzed?  \nThe distinction made here between analysis and construction\ndeliberately side-steps and important discussion among scholars of\nFrege and Russell about the nature of analysis. Frege held, in his\nFoundations of Arithmetic (1884, §64), that a\nproposition about identity of numbers could be also analyzed as one\nabout the similarity of classes. He describes this as “recarving\n” one and the same content in different ways. Later Frege\nasserted that the same thought could be viewed as the result of the\napplication of a function to an argument in different ways. As the\nlogical form of a thought is the result of the application of concepts\nto arguments, this means that distinct logical forms are assigned to\nthe same thought. To resolve the apparent conflict with Frege’s\nfamous thesis of  compositionality , that a thought is built\nup from its constituents in a fashion that by and large follows its\nsyntactic form, Michael Dummett (1981, chapter 15) distinguishes two\nnotions of analysis in Frege, one as “analysis” proper,\nthe other as “decomposition”. Peter Hylton (2005, 43)\nargues that there is a problematic notion of analysis in Russell, with\nit being very difficult to say that sentences containing definite\ndescriptions have the complicated quantificational structures assigned\nto them in “On Denoting” (1905) as their “real\nstructure”. Michael Beaney, in his introduction to (2007, 8)\ngives the names “decompositional” and\n“transformative” to two kinds of analysis in his\nintroduction to papers that discuss the significance of this\ndistinction for Russell. James Levine claims that in fact the first\nform of analysis, by which the project is to find the ultimate\nconstituents of propositions, belongs to an early project of\n“Moorean Analysis” that Russell abandoned early. Indeed, by\nthe time of the account of numbers as classes of equinumerous classes,\nRussell had already adopted what Levine calls “Russell’s\nPost-Peano Analysis ”.  \nThis debate is certainly relevant to the study of Frege’s\nphilosophy, and its connections with Russell’s role as a founder\nof Analytic Philosophy as a movement, but it is perhaps out of keeping\nwith Russell’s own use of the terminology of\n“analysis”. While Peter Strawson, in his “On\nReferring”(1950) makes numerous allusions to Russell’s\n“analysis” of definite descriptions, in fact the term does\nnot appear in “On Denoting”. Russell refers to his\n“theory” of descriptions, and acknowledges that it is not\na proposal that will be recognized immediately as what we have always\nmeant by such sentences, but instead says of his somewhat complicated\nuse of quantifiers and identity symbols that:  \nHe then goes on to defend his theory by “dealing” with the\nthree puzzles including the famous example of whether “The\npresent King of France is bald” is true or false. At no point\ndoes he appeal to what a speaker may have in mind upon uttering one of\nthese sentences. As a result of these facts, it seems that\nRussell’s methodology is best understood by analogy with the\nlogical approach to scientific theories. On this model the result of\n“logical analysis” will be the definitions and primitive\npropositions or axioms from which the laws of a formalized scientific\ntheory can be derived by logical inference. The reduction of one\ntheory to another consists of rewriting the axioms of the target\ntheory using the language of the reducing theory, and then proving\nthem as theorems of that reducing theory. Construction, then, is best\nseen as the process of choosing definitions so that previously\nprimitive statements can be derived as theorems. (See Hager 1994 and\nRussell 1924.) \nThis picture fits best with this linguistically oriented notion of\n“theory construction” rather than the project of\nphilosophical analysis. It also follows the use of the notion of\nconstruction in the tradition of mathematics. Euclid prefaces each\ndemonstration with a “construction” of a figure that\nfeatures in the following proof. Gottlob Frege begins every proof in\nhis Basic Laws of Arithmetic (1893) with an\n“Analysis”, which informally explains the notions used in\nthe theorems and the strategy of the derivation, followed by the\nactual, gapless proof, which is called the “Construction”.\nHistorically, then, there is no notion of a construction as a\nsynthetic stage following an analytic stage as two processes of a\ncomparable nature, but leading in opposite directions. \nEven when described in terms of stages of theory construction,\nanalysis and logical construction are not simply converse operations.\nRussell stresses that the objects discovered and distinguished in\nanalysis are “real” as are their differences from each\nother. Thus there is a constraint on the “choice” of\ndefinitions and primitive propositions with which to begin. The\nrelationships between a deductive system and a realistic ontology\ndiffer among the various cases that Russell lists as examples of\nlogical constructions. Propositions and “complexes” such\nas facts are analyzed in order to find the real objects and relations\nof which they are composed. A logical construction, on the other hand,\nresults in a theory from which truths follow by logical inferences.\nThe truths that are part of a deductive system resulting from logical\nconstruction are only “reconstructions” of some of the\n“pre-theoretic” truths that are to be analyzed. It is only\ntheir deductive relations, in particular their deducibility from the\naxioms of the theory, that are relevant to the success of a\nconstruction. Logical constructions do not capture all of the features\nof the pre-theoretic entities with which one begins. \nMuch of the attention to logical construction has focused on whether\nit is in fact a unified methodology for philosophy that will introduce\na “scientific method in philosophy” as Russell says in the\nsubtitle of (Russell 1914b). Commentators from Fritz (1952) through\nSainsbury (1979) have denied that Russell’s various\nconstructions fit into a unified methodology, as well as questioning\nthe applicability of the language of “fiction” and\n“incomplete symbol” to all examples. Below it will be\nshown how, nevertheless, constructions do fall into several natural\nfamilies that are described by various of these terms with a\nconsiderable degree of accuracy. \nRussell’s definition of natural numbers as classes of\nsimilar, or equinumerous, classes, first published in\n(Russell 1901), was his first logical construction, and was the model\nfor those that followed. Similar classes are those that can be mapped\none to one onto each other by some relation. The notion of a\n“one-to-one relation” is defined with logical notions: R\nis one-one when for every \\(x\\) there is a unique \\(y\\) such that \\(x\n\\rR y\\), and for every such \\(y\\) in the range of \\(\\rR\\) there is a\nunique such \\(x\\). These notions of existence and uniqueness come from\nlogic, and so the notion of number is thus defined solely in terms of\nclasses and of logical notions. Russell announced the goal of his\nlogicist program in The Principles of Mathematics: “the\nproof that all pure mathematics deals exclusively with concepts\ndefinable in terms of a very small number of fundamental logical\nconcepts, and that all its propositions are deducible from a very\nsmall number of fundamental logical principles…” (Russell\n1903, xv). If  class  is also shown to be a logical\nnotion, then this definition would complete the logicist program for\nthe mathematics of natural numbers.  \nGiuseppe Peano (Peano 1889, 94) had stated axioms for elementary\narithmetic, which were later formulated by Russell (1919, 8) as: \nFor Peano these were the axioms of number, which, along with axioms of\nclasses and propositions, describe the properties of these entities\nand lead to the derivation of theorems that express the other\nimportant properties of those entities. \nRichard Dedekind (Dedekind 1887) had also listed the properties of\nnumbers with similar looking axioms, using the notion of\nchain, an infinite sequence of sets, each a subset of the\nnext, that is well ordered and has the structure of the natural\nnumbers. Dedekind then proves that the principle of induction (Axiom 5\nabove) holds for chains. (See entry on\n Dedekind).\n Although Russell finds it “most remarkable that\nDedekind’s previous assumptions suffice to demonstrate this\ntheorem” (Russell 1903, §236), he compares the two\napproaches, of Peano and Dedekind, with respect to simplicity and\ntheir differing ways of treating mathematical induction, and concludes\nthat: \nBut from a purely logical point of view, the two methods seem equally\nsound; and it is to be remembered that, with the logical theory of\ncardinals, both Peano’s and Dedekind’s axioms become\ndemonstrable. (Russell 1903, §241) \nIt was Peano and Dedekind that Russell had in mind when he later\nspeaks of “the method of ‘postulating’” when\nhe compares the “advantages” of their method over\nconstruction as those of theft over honest toil. \nTo complete his project Russell needed to find definitions and some\n“very small number of fundamental logical principles”\n(Russell 1903, xv) and then produce the required derivations.\nFinding an adequate definition of classes with the “no-classes\ntheory” and the principles of logic needed to derive the\nproperties of numbers and classes was only completed with\nPrincipia Mathematica (Whitehead and Russell 1910–13).\nThis construction of numbers was a clear example of defining entities\nas classes of others so as to be able to prove certain properties as\ntheorems of logic rather than having to rest with the theft of\nhypotheses. With the device of contextual definition from the theory\nof descriptions Russell then eliminated classes too, taking as\nfundamental the logical notion of a propositional function and so\nshowing that the principles of classes where a part of logic.  \nDefinite descriptions are the logical constructions that Russell has\nin mind when when he describes them as “incomplete\nsymbols”. The notion of a “logical fiction”, on the\nother hand, applies most straightforwardly to classes. Other\nconstructions, such as the notions of the domain and range of a\nrelation, and of one to one mappings that are crucial to the\ndevelopment of arithmetic, are only “incomplete” in an\nindirect sense due to their being defined as classes of a certain\nsort, which are in turn constructions. \nRussell’s theory of descriptions was introduced in his\npaper “On Denoting” (Russell 1905) published in the\njournal Mind. Russell’s theory provides the logical\nform of sentences of the form ‘The \\(F\\) is \\(G\\)’ where\n‘The \\(F\\)’ is called a definite description in\ncontrast with ‘An F’ which is an indefinite\ndescription. The analysis proposes that ‘The \\(F\\) is\n\\(G\\)’ is equivalent to ‘There is one and only one \\(F\\)\nand it is \\(G\\)’. Given this account, the logical properties of\ndescriptions can be deduced using just the logic of quantifiers and\nidentity. Among the theorems in *14 of Principia Mathematica\nare those showing that, (1) if there is just one \\(F\\) then ‘The\n\\(F\\) is \\(F\\)’ is true, and if there is not, then ‘The\n\\(F\\) is \\(G\\)’ is always false and then, (2) if the \\(F =\n\\text{the } G\\), and the \\(F\\) is \\(H\\), then the \\(G\\) is \\(H\\).\nThese theorems show that proper (uniquely referring) descriptions\nbehave like proper names, the “singular terms” of logic.\nSome of these results have been controversial —Strawson (1950)\nclaimed that an utterance of ‘The present King of France is\nbald’ should be truth valueless since there is no present king\nof France, rather than “plainly” false, as Russell’s\ntheory predicts. Russell’s reply to Strawson in (Russell 1959,\n239–45) is helpful for understanding Russell’s\nphilosophical methodology of which logical construction is just a\npart. It is, however, by assessing the logical consequences of a\nconstruction that it is to be judged, and so Strawson challenged\nRussell in an appropriate way.  \nThe theory of descriptions introduces Russell’s notion of\nincomplete symbol. This arises because no definitional\nequivalent of ‘The F’ appears in the formal analysis of\nsentences in which the description occurs. The sentence ‘The\n\\(F\\) is \\(H\\)’ becomes: \nof which no subformula, or even a contiguous segment, can be\nidentified as the analysis of ‘The F’. Similarly, talk\nabout “the average family” as in “The average family\nhas 2.2 children” becomes “The number of children in\nfamilies divided by the number of families = 2.2”. There is no\nsegment of that formula that corresponds to “the average\nfamily”. Instead we are given a procedure for eliminating such\nexpressions from contexts in which they occur, hence this is another\nexample of an “incomplete symbol” and the definition of an\naverage is an example of a “contextual definition.”  \nIt is arguable that Russell’s definition of definite\ndescriptions was the most prominent early example of the philosophical\ndistinction between surface grammatical form and logical form, and\nthus marks the beginnings of linguistic analysis as a method in\nphilosophy. Linguistic analysis begins by looking past superficial\nlinguistic form to see an underlying philosophical analysis. Frank\nRamsey described the theory of descriptions as a “paradigm of\nphilosophy” (Ramsey 1929, 1). While in itself surely not a model\nfor all philosophy, it was at least a paradigm for the other examples\nof logical constructions that Russell listed when looking back on the\ndevelopment of his philosophy in 1924. The theory of descriptions has\nbeen criticized by some linguists and philosophers who see\ndescriptions and other noun phrases as full-fledged linguistic\nconstituents of sentences, and who see the sharp distinction between\ngrammatical and logical form as a mistake. (See the entry on\n descriptions.) \nFollowing Gilbert Ryle’s (1931) influential criticisms of\nMeinong’s theory of non-existent objects, the theory of\ndescriptions has been taken as a model for avoiding ontological\ncommitment to objects, and so logical constructions in general are\noften seen as being chiefly used to eliminate purported entities. In\nfact, that goal is at most peripheral to many constructions. The\nprincipal goal of these constructions is to allow the proof of\npropositions that would otherwise have to be assumed as axioms or\nhypotheses. Nor need the introduction of constructions always result\nin the elimination of problematic entities. Yet other constructions\nshould be seen more as reductions of one class of entity to another,\nor replacements of one notion by a more precise, mathematical,\nsubstitute. \nRussell’s “No-Class” theory of classes from *20 of\nPrincipia Mathematica provides a contextual definition like\nthat of the theory of definite descriptions. One of Russell’s\nearly diagnoses of the paradox of the class of all classes that are\nnot members of themselves was that it showed that classes could not be\nindividuals. Indeed Russell seems to have come across his paradox by\napplying Cantor’s famous diagonal argument to show that there\nare more classes of individuals than individuals. Hence, he concluded,\nclasses could not be individuals, and expressions for classes such as\n‘\\(\\{x: Fx \\}\\)’ cannot be the singular terms they appear\nto be. Inspired by the theory of descriptions, Russell proposed that\nto say something \\(G\\) of the class of \\(F\\)s, \\(G\\) \\(\\{x: Fx \\}\\),\nis to say that there is some (predicative) property \\(H\\) coextensive\nwith (true of the same things as) \\(F\\) such that \\(H\\) is \\(G\\). The\nrestriction to predicative properties, or those which are not defined\nin terms of quantification over other properties, was a consequence of\nthe ramification of the theory of types to avoid intensional\nor “epistemic” paradoxes which motivated the theory of\ntypes in addition to the set theoretical “Russell’s\nParadox” (see Whitehead and Russell 1910–13, Introduction,\nChapter II). These predicative properties are intensional, however, in\nthe sense that two distinct properties might hold of the same objects.\n(See the entry on the\n notation in Principia Mathematica.)\n That classes so defined have the feature of extensionality is thus\nderivable, rather than postulated. If \\(F\\) and \\(H\\) are coextensive\nthen anything true of \\(\\{x:Fx \\}\\) will be true of \\(\\{x:Hx \\}\\).\nFeatures of classes then follow from the features of the logic of\nproperties. \nBecause classes would at first seem to be individuals of some sort,\nbut on analysis are found not to be, Russell speaks of them as\n“logical fictions,” an expression which echoes Jeremy\nBentham’s notion of “legal fictions.” (Hart 1994,\n84) (See entry on\n law and language).\n That a corporation is a “person” at law was for Bentham\nmerely a fiction that could be cashed out in terms of the notion of\nlegal standing and of limits to the financial liability of real\npersons. Thus any language about such “legal fictions”\ncould be translated in other terms to be about real individuals and\ntheir legal relationships. Because statements attributing a property\nto particular classes are replaced by existential sentences saying\nthat there is some propositional function having that property, this\nconstruction also can be characterized as showing that class\nexpressions, such as ‘\\(\\{x:Fx \\}\\)’, are incomplete\nsymbols. They are not replaced by some longer formula expressing a\nterm. On the other hand, the definition should not be seen as avoiding\nontological commitment entirely, as showing that something is\nliterally a “fiction”. Rather it shows how to reduce\nclasses to propositional functions. The properties of classes are\nreally properties of propositional functions and for every class said\nto have a property there really is some propositional function having\nthat property. \nWhitehead and Russell define a series in volume II of\nPrincipia Mathematica at *204.01 as the class\nSer of all relations which is transitive, connected\nand irreflexive. A relation \\(R\\) is transitive when, if\n\\(xRy\\) and \\(yRz\\) then \\(xRz\\). It is connected when for\nany \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) for which it is defined, either \\(xRy\\) or\n\\(yRx\\). Finally, an irreflexive relation is one such that\nfor all \\(x\\), it is not the case that \\(xRx\\). Any relation that has\nthose properties forms a series of the things that it\nrelates. Such relations are now called “linear orderings”\nor simply, “orderings”. Here the “logical\nconstruction” simply consists of an implicit definition of a\ncertain property of relations. There is certainly no thought that\nseries are merely invented “fictions”, and the symbol\n‘Ser’ for them is\n“incomplete” only in that it can be explicitly defined as\nthe intersection of other classes (a class of classes) and classes are\nthemselves “incomplete”. \nRussell’s definitions of ordinal numbers and real numbers\nresemble the definitions of natural numbers. Ordinal numbers are a\nspecial case of  relation numbers. Just as a cardinal number\ncan be defined as a class of similar classes where the similarity is\nsimply equinumerosity, the existence of a one to one mapping between\nthe two classes, a relation number is a class of similar classes which\nare ordered by some relation. Ordinal numbers are the relation numbers\nof well-ordered classes. “Relation-Arithmetic” is the\nsubject of Part IV of Volume II of Principia Mathematica,\nchapters *150 to *186. All of the properties of the arithmetic of\nordinal numbers are derived from the more general arithmetic of\nrelation numbers. Thus, for example, the addition of ordinal numbers\nis not commutative. The first infinite ordinal \\(\\omega\\) is the\nrelation number of the well-ordered classes similar to \\(1, 2, 3,\n\\ldots\\) etc. The sum \\(1 + \\omega\\) will be the relation number of\nordered classes which result from adding one element at the beginning\nof the ordering, say \\(0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\) etc., which has the same\nordinal number \\(\\omega\\). Thus \\(1 + \\omega = \\omega\\). On the other\nhand, adding an element at the “end” of such a well\nordered class will give an ordering that is not similar: \\(1, 2, 3,\n\\ldots \\text{etc.}, 0\\). Consequently, \\(1 + \\omega \\ne \\omega + 1\\).\nOn the other hand addition of ordinals, and indeed relation numbers in\ngeneral, is associative, that is, \\((\\alpha + \\beta) + \\gamma = \\alpha\n+ (\\beta + \\gamma)\\), which is proved with certain restrictions in\n*174. Ordinal numbers are thus defined exactly as natural numbers, as\nclasses of similar classes, in such a way that all the desired\ntheorems can be proved. Describing ordinal numbers as\n“fictions”, “incomplete symbols” and\n“constructions” applies in the same way as in the case of\nnatural numbers. \nThe class of real numbers, Θ, is defined in Volume III of\nPrincipia Mathematica at *310.01 as consisting of\n“Dedekindian series” of rational numbers, which are in\nturn relation numbers of “ratios” of natural numbers.\nWhitehead and Russell follow the account of real numbers as\nDedekind cuts of the rational numbers, and only differ from\nmore standard developments of the numbers in contemporary set theory\nby treating rational numbers as relation numbers of a certain sort,\nrather than ordered pairs of and integers (the “numerator”\nand “denominator”). Like the construction of relation\nnumbers as classes of similar classes, the “logical\nconstruction” of real numbers differs from the theory of\ndefinite descriptions and classes in general in not defining\n“incomplete symbols” or by showing that these numbers are\nreally “fictions”. They are best characterized as\ndefinitions that allow for the proof of theorems about these numbers\nthat would otherwise have to be postulated as axioms. They are the\nproduct of the “honest toil” that Russell prefers. \nMathematical functions are not mentioned by Russell in the 1924 list\nof “logical constructions” although the analysis of\nmathematical functions is the principal application of the theory of\ndefinite descriptions in PM. The basic “functions” of PM\nare propositional functions. The Greek letters \\(\\phi, \\psi, \\theta,\n\\ldots\\) are variables for propositional functions, and, with\nindividual variables \\(x, y, z, \\ldots\\) go together to form open\nsentences \\(\\phi(x), \\psi(x,y)\\), etc. This is the familiar syntax of\nmodern predicate logic. Mathematical functions, such as the\nsine function and addition, are represented as  term\nforming operators such as \\(\\sin x\\), or \\(x + y\\). In\ncontemporary logic they are symbolized by function letters that are\nfollowed by the appropriate number of arguments, \\(f(x),g(x,y)\\), etc.\nIn chapter *30 Whitehead and Russell propose a direct interpretation\nof such expressions for mathematical functions in terms of definite\ndescriptions, which they call “descriptive functions”.\nConsider the relation between a number and its sine, the relation\nwhich obtains between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) when \\(y = \\sin x\\). Call this\nrelation “\\(\\text{Sine}(x,y)\\)” or more simply,\n“\\(\\bS(x,y)\\)”, as a two-place relation. The mathematical\nfunction can then be expressed with a definite description,\ninterpreting our expression “the sine of \\(x\\)” not as\n“\\(\\sin(x)\\)”, but literally as “the Sine\nof \\(x\\)”, with a definite description, or “the \\(y\\) such\nthat \\(\\text{Sine}(x,y)\\)”. Using the notation of the theory of\ndefinite descriptions, this is ‘\\((\\iota x)\\bS(x,y)\\)’.\nThe effect of this analysis is that Whitehead and Russell can replace\nall expressions for mathematical functions with definite descriptions\nbased on relations. This definition involves relations in\nextension, which are represented with upper case Roman letters\nand with the relation symbol between the variables. The definition in\nPM is: *30.01. \\(R`y = (\\iota x)xRy\\), with the notation \\(R`y\\) to be\nread as “the \\(R\\) of \\(y\\).” As with the theory of\ndescriptions, the result of this definition is to facilitate the\nproofs of theorems which capture the logical properties of\nmathematical functions that will be needed in the further work of\nPM. \nThe logical analysis of function expressions in PM presents them as a\nspecial case of definite descriptions, “the \\(R\\) of\n\\(x\\)”. In the Summary of *30 we find: \nMathematical or descriptive functions are thus explicitly included\namong the incomplete symbols of Principia Mathematica. \nIn Principia Mathematica Russell’s multiple\nrelation theory of judgment is introduced by presenting an\nontological vision: \nThe universe consists of objects having various qualities and standing\nin various relations. (Whitehead and Russell 1910–13, 43) \nRussell goes on to explain the multiple relation theory of judgment,\nwhich finds the place of propositions in this world of objects and\nqualities standing in relations. (See the entry on\n propositions.)\n  \nRussell’s multiple relation theory, that he held from 1910 to\naround 1919, argued that the constituents of propositions, say\n‘Desdemona loves Cassio’, are unified in a way that does\nnot make it the case that they constitute a fact by themselves. Those\nconstituents occur only in the context of beliefs, say, ‘Othello\njudges that Desdemona loves Cassio’. The real fact consists of a\nrelation of Belief holding between the constituents Othello,\nDesdemona, and Cassio; \\(B(o,d,L,c)\\). Because one might also have\nbelieved propositions of other structures, such as \\(B(o,F,a)\\) there\nneed to be many such relations \\(B\\), of different\n“arities”, or number of arguments, hence the name\n“multiple relation” theory. Like the construction of\nnumbers, this construction abstracts from what a number of occurrences\nof a belief have in common, namely, a relation between a believer and\nvarious objects in a certain order. The account also makes the\nproposition an incomplete symbol because there is no constituent in\nthe analysis of ‘\\(x\\) believes that \\(p\\)’ that\ncorresponds to ‘\\(p\\)’. As a result Russell concludes\nthat: \nIt will be seen that, according to the above account, a judgment does\nnot have a single object, namely a proposition, but has several\ninterrelated objects. That is to say, the relation which constitutes\njudgment is not a relation of two terms, namely the judging mind and\nthe proposition, but is a relation of several terms, namely the mind\nand what we call the constituents of the proposition… \nOwing to the plurality of the objects of a single judgment, it follows\nthat what we call a “proposition” (in which it is to be\ndistinguished from the phrase expressing it) is not a single entity at\nall. That is to say, the phrase which expresses a proposition is what\nwe call an “incomplete” symbol; it does not have meaning\nin itself, but requires some supplementation in order to acquire a\ncomplete meaning. (Whitehead and Russell 1910–13,\n43–44) \nAlthough bound variables ranging over propositions hardly occur in\nPrincipia Mathematica (with a prominent exception in *14.3),\nit would seem that the whole theory of types is a theory of\npropositional functions. Yet following on the claim that propositions\nare “not single entities at all”, Russell says the same\nfor propositional functions. In the Introduction to Mathematical\nPhilosophy, Russell says that propositional functions are really\n“nothing”, but “nonetheless important for\nthat” (Russell 1919, 96). This comment makes best sense if we\nthink of propositional functions as somehow constructed by abstracting\nthem from their values, which are propositions. The propositional\nfunction “\\(x\\) is human” is abstracted from its values\n“Socrates is human”, “Plato is human”, etc.\nViewing propositional functions as constructions from propositions,\nthat are in turn constructions by the multiple relation theory, helps\nto make sense of certain features of the theory of types of\npropositional functions in Principia Mathematica. We can\nunderstand how propositional functions seem to depend on their values,\nnamely propositions, and how propositions in turn can themselves be\nlogical constructions. The relation of this dependence to the theory\nof types is explained in the Introduction to Principia\nMathematica in terms of the notion of\n“presupposing”: \nIt would seem, however, that the essential characteristic of a\nfunction is ambiguity… We may express this by saying\nthat “\\(\\phi x\\)” ambiguously denotes \\(\\phi a, \\phi b,\n\\phi c,\\) etc., where \\(\\phi a, \\phi b, \\phi c,\\) etc. are the various\nvalues of “\\(\\phi x\\).” … It will be seen that,\naccording to the above account, the values of a function are\npresupposed by that function, not vice versa. It is sufficiently\nobvious, in any particular case, that a value of a function does not\npresuppose the function. Thus for example the proposition\n“Socrates is human” can be perfectly apprehended without\nregarding it as a value of the function “\\(x\\) is human.”\nIt is true that, conversely, a function can be apprehended without its\nbeing necessary to apprehend its values severally and individually. If\nthis were not the case, no function could be apprehended at all, since\nthe number of values (true and false) of a function is necessarily\nindefinite and there are necessarily possible arguments with which we\nare not acquainted. (Russell 1910–13, 39–40) \nThe notion of “incomplete symbol” seems less appropriate\nthan “construction” in the case of propositional functions\nand propositions. To classify propositions and even propositional\nfunctions as instances of the same logical phenomenon as definite\ndescriptions requires a considerable broadening of the notion. \nThe ontological status of propositions and propositional functions\nwithin Russell’s logic, and in particular, in Principia\nMathematica, is currently the subject of considerable debate. One\ninterpretation, which we might call “realist,” is\nsummarized in this footnote by Alonzo Church in his 1976 study of the\nramified theory of types: \nThus we take propositions as values of the propositional variables, on\nthe ground that this is what is clearly demanded by the background and\npurpose of Russell’s logic, and in spite of what seems to be an\nexplicit denial by Whitehead and Russell in PM, pp. 43–44. \nIn fact, Whitehead and Russell make the claim: “that what we\ncall a ‘proposition’ (in the sense in which this is\ndistinguished from the phrase expressing it) is not a single entity at\nall. That is to say, the phrase which expresses a proposition is what\nwe call an ‘incomplete symbol’ …” They seem\nto be aware that this fragmenting of propositions requires a similar\nfragmenting of propositional functions. But the contextual definition\nor definitions that are implicitly promised by the “incomplete\nsymbol” characterization are never fully supplied, and it is in\nparticular how they would explain away the use of bound propositional\nand functional variables. If some things that are said by Russell in\nIV and V of his Introduction to the second edition may be taken as an\nindication of what is intended, it is probable that the contextual\ndefinitions would not stand scrutiny. \nMany passages in [(Russell 1908)] and [(Whitehead and Russell\n1910–13)] may be understood as saying or as having the\nconsequence that the values of propositional functions are sentences.\nBut a coherent semantics of Russell’s formalized language can\nhardly be provided on this basis (notice in particular, that, since\nsentences are also substituted for propositional variables, it would\nbe necessary to take sentences as names of sentences.) And since the\npassages in question seem to involve confusions of use and mention or\nkindred confusions that may be merely careless, it is not certain that\nthey are to be regarded as precise statements of a semantics. (Church\n1976, n.4) \nGregory Landini (1998) has proposed that there is indeed a coherent\nsemantics for propositions and propositional functions in PM, which\ntreats functions and propositions as linguistic entities. Landini\nproposes that this “nominalist semantics” is the intended\ninterpretation of PM and is what remains of Russell’s earlier\n“substitutional theory.” He argues that Russell was led to\nthis nominalism after first rejecting the reality of classes,then of\npropositional functions, and finally the reality of propositions. This\nrejection, according to Landini, leaves us with only a nominalist\nmetaphysics of individuals and expressions as the interpretation of\nRussell’s logic. See also Cocchiarella (1980), who describes a\n“nominalist semantics” for ramified type theory, but\nrejects it as Russell’s intended interpretation. Sainsbury\n(1979) describes a “substitutional” interpretation of the\nquantifiers over propositional functions, but combines this with a\ntruth-conditional semantics that does not require the ramification of\nthe theory of types that is central to Russell’s interpretation\nin PM. \nPropositions and propositional functions are unlike definite\ndescriptions and classes in that there are no explicit definitions of\nthem in PM. It is unclear what it means to say that a symbol for a\nproposition, such as a variable \\(p\\) or \\(q\\), has “no meaning\nin isolation”, and that, however, the meaning can be given\n“in context”, as it would seem that there no definition is\npossible, it would seem, in a logic in which propositions and\npropositional functions appear as primitive notions in the statement\nof the axioms and definitions of logic. \nWhether or not they are provided with contextual definitions by\nWhitehead and Russell, logical constructions do not appear as the\nreferents of logically proper names, and so by that account\nconstructions are not a part of the fundamental\n“furniture” of the world. Early critical discussions of\nconstructions, such as Wisdom (1931), stressed the contrast between\nlogically proper names, which do refer, and constructions, which were\nthus seen as ontologically innocent. \nBeginning with The Problems of Philosophy in 1912, Russell\nturned repeatedly to the problem of matter. As has been described by\nOmar Nasim (2008), Russell was stepping into an ongoing discussion of\nthe relation of sense data to matter that was being carried on by T.P.\nNunn (1910), Samuel Alexander (1910), G.F. Stout (1914), and G.E.\nMoore (1914), among others. The participants of this “Edwardian\ncontroversy”, as Nasim terms it, shared a belief that direct\nobjects of perception, with their sensory qualities, were nonetheless\nextra-mental. The concept of matter, then, was the result of a loosely\ndescribed social or psychological “construction”, going\nbeyond what was directly perceived. A project shared by the\nparticipants in the controversy was the search for a refutation of\nGeorge Berkeley’s idealism, which would show how the existence\nand real nature of matter can be discovered. In The Problems of\nPhilosophy (Russell 1912) Russell argues that the belief in the\nexistence of matter is a well supported hypothesis that explains our\nexperiences. Matter is known only indirectly, “by\ndescription”, as the cause, whatever it may be, of our sense\ndata, which we directly know by “by acquaintance”. This is\nan example of the sort of hypothesis that Russell contrasts with\nconstruction in the famous passage about “theft” and\n“honest toil”. Russell saw an analogy between the case of\nsimply hypothesizing the existence of numbers with certain properties,\nthose described by axioms, and hypothesizing the existence of\nmatter. \nThe need for some sort of account of the logical features of matter,\nwhat he called “the problem of matter”, had already\noccupied Russell much earlier. While we distinguish the certain\nknowledge we may have of mathematical entities from the contingent\nknowledge of material objects, Russell says that there are certain\n“neat” features of matter that are just too tidy to have\nturned out by accident. Examples include the most general\nspatiotemporal properties of objects, that no two can occupy the same\nplace at the same time, which he calls “impenetrability”,\nand so on. In The Principles of Mathematics (Russell 1903,\n§453) there is a list of these features of matter including\n“indestructibility”, “ingenerability” and\n“impenetrability”, which were all characteristic of the\natomic theory of the day. Russell followed the progression through the\nexact sciences from logic through arithmetic, and then real numbers\nand then to infinite cardinals. There followed a discussion of space\nand time, with the book ending with a last part (VII) on Matter and\nMotion, chapters §53 to §59. In them Russell discusses what\nhe calls “rational Dynamics as a branch of pure\nmathematics” (Russell 1903, §437). This rational\nDynamics, would involve justifying many of the fundamental\nprinciples of physics with pure mathematics alone, from definitions\nthat yield the geometry of space and time and the formal properties of\nits occupants, quantities of matter and energy. In this respect the\nconstruction of matter most resembles the construction of numbers as\nclasses as an effort to replace the “theft” of postulating\naxioms with the “honest toil” of devising definitions that\nwill validate those postulates.  \nIn the later project of constructing matter, from 1914 on, beginning\nwith Our Knowledge of the External World (Russell 1914b),\nmaterial objects come to be seen as collections of sense data, then of\n“sensibilia”. Sensibilia are potential objects of\nsensation, which, when perceived become “sense data” for\nthe perceiver. Influenced by William James, Russell came to defend a\nneutral monism by which matter and minds were both to be\nconstructed from sensibilia, but in different ways. Intuitively, the\nsense data occurring as they do “in” a mind, are material\nto construct that mind, the sense data derived from an object from\ndifferent points of view to construct that object. Russell saw some\nsupport for this in the theory of relativity, and the fundamental\nimportance of frames of reference in the new physics. \nIn the 1930s Susan Stebbing and John Wisdom, founding what has come to\nbe called the “Cambridge School of Analysis,” paid\nconsiderable attention to the notion of logical construction (see\nBeaney 2003). Stebbing (1933) was concerned with the unclarity over\nwhether it was expressions or entities that are logical constructions,\nand with how to understand a claim such as “this table is a\nlogical construction” and indeed what it could even mean to\ncontrast logical constructions with inferred entities. Russell had\nbeen motivated by the logicist project of finding definitions and\nelementary premises from which mathematical statements could be\nproved. Stebbing and Wisdom were concerned, rather, with relating the\nnotion of construction to philosophical analysis of ordinary language.\nWisdom’s (1931) series of papers in Mind interpreted\nlogical constructions in terms of ideas from Wittgenstein’s\nTractatus (1921). \nDemopoulos and Friedman (1985) find an anticipation of the recent\n“structural realist” view of scientific theories in\n(Russell 1927), The Analysis of Matter. They argue that the\nlogical constructions of sense data in Russell’s earlier\nthinking on the “problem of matter” were replaced by\ninferences to the structural properties of space and matter from\npatterns of sense data. We may sense patches of color next to each\nother in our visual field, but what that tells us about the causes of\nthose sense data, about matter, is only revealed by the structure of\nthose relationships. Thus the color of a patch in our visual field\ntells us nothing about the intrinsic properties of the table that\ncauses that experience. Instead it is the structural properties of our\nexperiences, such as their relative order in time, and which are\nbetween which others in the visual field, that gives us a clue as to\nthe structural relationships of time and space within the material\nworld that causes the experience. The contemporary version of this\naccount, called “structural realism”, holds that it is\nonly the structural properties and relations that a scientific theory\nattributes to the world about which we should be scientific realists.\n(See the entry on\n structural realism.) \nAccording to this account, Russell’s initial project of\nreplacing inference with logical construction was to find for each\npattern of sense data some logical construction that bears a pattern\nof isomorphic structural relations. That project was transformed,\nDemopoulos and Friedman argue, by replacing inference from the given\nin experience to the cause of that experience with an inference to the\nrather impoverished, structural, reality of the causes of those\nexperiences. Russell’s matter project was interpreted in this\nway by others, and led, in 1928, to G.H. Newman’s apparently\ndevastating objection. Newman (1928) pointed out that there is always\na structure of arbitrarily “constructed” relations with\nany given structure if only the number of basic entities, in this case\nsense data, is large enough. According to Demopoulos and Friedman,\nNewman shows that there must be more to scientific theories than\ntrivial statements to the effect that matter has some structural\nproperties isomorphic to those of our sense data. The project of\nThe Analysis of Matter does indeed face a serious difficulty\nwith “Newman’s problem”, whether or not those\ndifficulties arise for the earlier project of logical construction\n(see Linsky 2013). \nThe notion of logical construction had a great impact on the future\ncourse of analytic philosophy. One line of influence was via the\nnotion of a contextual definition, or paraphrase, intended to minimize\nontological commitment and to be a model of philosophical analysis.\nThe distinction between the surface appearance of definite\ndescriptions, as singular terms, and the fully interpreted sentences\nfrom which they seem to disappear was seen as a model for making\nproblematic notions disappear upon analysis. Wisdom (1931) proposed\nthis application of logical construction in the spirit of\nWittgenstein. In this way the theory of descriptions has been viewed\nas a paradigm of philosophical analysis of this\n“therapeutic” sort that seeks to dissolve logical\nproblems. \nA more technical strand in analytic philosophy was influenced by the\nconstruction of matter. Rudolf Carnap quotes (Russell 1914a, 11) as\nthe motto for his “Aufbau”, the Logical\nStructure of the World (1967): \nThe supreme maxim in scientific philosophizing is this: Whenever\npossible, logical constructions are to be substituted for inferred\nentities. (Carnap 1967, 6) \nIn the Aufbau the construction of matter from\n“elementary experiences”, and later Nelson Goodman (1951)\ncontinued the project. Michael Friedman (1999) and Alan Richardson\n(1998) have argued that Carnap’s project of construction owed\nmuch more to his background in neo-Kantian issues about the\n“constitution” of empirical objects than with\nRussell’s project. See, however, Pincock (2002) for a response\nthat argues for the importance of Russell’s project of\nreconstructing scientific knowledge in (Carnap 1967). More generally,\nthe use of set theoretic constructions became widespread among\nphilosophers, and continues in the construction of set theoretic\nmodels, both in the sense of logic where they model formal theories\nand to provide descriptions of truth conditions for sentences about\nentities. \nWillard van Orman Quine saw his notion of “explication” as\na development of logical construction. Quine presents his methodology\nin Word and Object (1960) beginning with an allusion to\nRamsey’s remark in the title of section 53: “The Ordered\nPair as Philosophical Paradigm”. The problem of apparently\nreferring expressions that motivates Russell’s theory of\ndescriptions is presented as a general problem: \nA pattern repeatedly illustrated in recent sections is that of the\ndefective noun that proves undeserving of objects and is dismissed as\nan irreferential fragment of a few containing phrases. But some times\nthe defective noun fares oppositely: its utility is found to turn on\nthe admission of denoted objects as values of the variables of\nquantification. In such a case our job is to devise interpretations\nfor it in the term positions where, in its defectiveness, it had not\nused to occur. (Quine 1960, 257) \nThe notion of a “defective noun” that is to be\n“dismissed as an irreferential fragment” clearly echoes\nthe description of constructions as logical fictions and their\nexpressions as mere incomplete symbols that so aptly describe the\ncontextual definitions for definite descriptions and classes. The task\nof “devising interpretations” is more like the positive\naspect suggested by the term “construction” and\nillustrated in the cases of the construction of numbers and matter.\nAfter concluding that the expression “ordered pair” was\nsuch a “defective noun”, Quine says that the notion of an\nordered pair \\(\\langle x,y \\rangle\\) of two entities \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\ndoes have “utility” and is limited only in having to\nfulfill one “postulate”: \nIn other words, that ordered pairs are distinguished by having unique\nfirst and second elements. Quine then continues: \nThe problem of suitably eking out the use of these defective nouns\ncan be solved once for all by systematically fixing upon some suitable\nalready-recognized object, for each \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), with which to\nidentify \\(\\langle x,y \\rangle\\). The problem is a neat one, for we\nhave in (1) a single explicit standard by which to judge whether a\nversion is suitable. (Quine 1960, 258) \nAgain Quine echoes Russell’s language with his mention of a\n“neat” property that calls out for a\n“construction” from known entities. Quine distinguishes\nhis project, which he calls “explication”, by the fact\nthat there are alternative possible ways to fix the notion. Although\nWhitehead and Russell give an account in PM *55, where they are called\n“ordinal couples”, the first proposal to treat ordered\npairs as classes of their members is from Norbert Wiener (1914) who\nidentifies \\(\\langle x,y \\rangle\\) with \\(\\{\\{ x \\}, \\{ y, \\Lambda\n\\}\\}\\), where \\(\\Lambda\\) is the empty class. From this definition it\nis easy to recover the first and second elements of the pair, and so\nQuine’s (1) is an elementary theorem. Later, Kuratowski proposed\nthe definition \\(\\{\\{ x \\}, \\{x,y\\}\\}\\), from which (1) also follows.\nFor Quine it is a matter of choice which definition to use, as the\npoints on which they differ are “don’t-cares”,\nissues which give a precise answer to questions about which our\npre-theoretic account is mute. An explication thus differs\nconsiderably from an “analysis” of ordinary, or\npre-theoretic language, both in giving a precise meaning to the\nexpression where it might have been obscure, or perhaps simply silent\nand in possibly differing from pre-theoretic use, as suggested by the\nname. This fits well with the asymmetries we have noted between\nanalysis and construction, with analysis aimed at the discovery of the\nconstituents and structure of propositions which are given to us, and\nconstruction which is more a matter of choice, with the goal being the\nrecovery of particular “neat” features of the construction\nin a formal theory. The ordered pair is thus a “philosophical\nparadigm” for Quine just as Russell’s theory of\ndescriptions was a paradigm of philosophy for Ramsey, and each is a\n“logical construction”.","contact.mail":"bernard.linsky@ualberta.ca","contact.domain":"ualberta.ca"}]
