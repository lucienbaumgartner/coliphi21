Set-theoretic paradoxes noted by Russell and others\nled to attempts to produce a consistent set theory as a foundation for\nmathematics. But, as is well known, set theories such as ZF, NBG and\nthe like were in various ways ad hoc. Hence, a number of people\nincluding da Costa (1974), Brady (1971, 1989), Priest, Routley, &\nNorman (1989, pp. 152, 498), considered it preferable to retain the\nfull power of the natural comprehension principle (every predicate\ndetermines a set), and tolerate a degree of inconsistency in set\ntheory. Brady, in particular, has extended, streamlined and simplified\nthese results on naive set theory in his book (2006); for a clear\naccount see also Restall’s review (2007). \nThese constructions require, of course, that one dispense at\nleast with the logical principle ex contradictione\nquodlibet (ECQ) (from a contradiction every proposition may be\ndeduced, also recently called explosion), as well as any\nprinciple which leads to it, such as disjunctive syllogism (DS) (from\nA-or-B and not-A deduce B). ECQ\ntrivialises any inconsistent theory (triviality = every sentence is\nprovable), which makes it useless for mathematical calculation. But\nconsiderable debate (Burgess 1981, Mortensen 1983), made it clear that\ndispensing with ECQ and DS was not so counter-intuitive, especially\nwhen a plausible story emerged about the special conditions under\nwhich they continue to hold.  \nIt should also be noted that Brady’s construction of naive set\ntheory opens the door to a revival of Frege-Russell logicism, which\nwas widely held, even by Frege himself, to have been badly damaged by\nthe Russell Paradox. If the Russell Contradiction does not spread,\nthen there is no obvious reason why one should not take the view that\nnaive set theory provides an adequate foundation for mathematics, and\nthat naive set theory is deducible from logic via the naive\ncomprehension schema. The only change needed is a move to an\ninconsistency-tolerant logic. Even more radically, Weber, in related\npapers (2010), (2012), has taken the inconsistency to be a positive\nvirtue, since it enables us to settle several questions that were left\nopen by Cantor, namely, that the well-ordering theorem and the axiom\nof choice are provable, and that the Continuum Hypothesis is false\n(2012, 284). Some of these come out provably both true and false;\nwherein Weber is concerned to advance proofs of the classical\nrecapture, which is the project of showing that traditional\nresults remain true (2010, 72). This is invigorating new ground. Weber\nalso showed something essential to this project, namely, that\nCantor’s Theorem continues to hold; that is, it does not depend\non overly-strong logical principles which are contested by\nparaconsistentists. Retaining Cantor’s Theorem is important in\nWeber’s view, since different orders of infinity remain\navailable in inconsistent set theory. \nIn addition, mathematics has a metalanguage, for talking about\nmathematics itself. This includes the concepts: (i) names for\nmathematical statements and other parts of syntax, (ii)\nself-reference, (iii) proof and (iv) truth. Gödel’s\ncontribution to the philosophy of mathematics was to show that the\nfirst three of these can be rigorously expressed in arithmetical\ntheories, albeit in theories which are either inconsistent or\nincomplete. The possibility of a well-structured example of the former\nof these two alternatives, inconsistency, was not taken seriously,\nagain because of belief in ECQ. However, in addition natural languages\nseem to have their own truth predicate. Combined with self-reference\nthis produces the Liar paradox, “This sentence is false”,\nan inconsistency. Priest (1987) and Priest, Routley and Norman (1989,\np. 154) argued that the Liar had to be regarded as a statement both\ntrue and false, a true contradiction. This represents another argument\nfor studying inconsistent theories, namely the claim that some\ncontradictions are true, also known as dialetheism. Kripke\n(1975) proposed instead to model a truth predicate differently, in a\nconsistent incomplete theory. We see below that incompleteness and\ninconsistency are closely related. \nBut these remarks have been about foundations, and mathematics is not\nits foundations. Hence there is a further independent motive, to see\nwhat mathematical structure remains wherever the constraint\nof consistency is relaxed. But it would be wrong to regard this as in\nany way a repudiation of the structures studied in classical\nmathematics: inconsistent structures represent an addition to\nknown structures. \nRobert K. Meyer (1976) seems to have been the first to think of an\ninconsistent arithmetical theory. At this point, he was more\ninterested in the fate of a consistent theory, his relevant arithmetic\nR#. This amounts to the axioms for Peano arithmetic, with a base of\nthe quantified relevant logic RQ, and Meyer hoped that the weaker base\nof relevant logic would allow more models. He was right. There proved\nto be a whole class of inconsistent arithmetical theories; see Meyer\nand Mortensen (1984), for example. In a parallel with the above\nremarks on rehabilitating logicism, Meyer argued that these\narithmetical theories provide the basis for a revived Hilbert Program.\nHilbert’s program was the project of rigorously formalising\nmathematics and proving its consistency by simple finitary/inductive\nprocedures. It was widely held to have been seriously damaged by\nGödel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem, according to which\nthe consistency of arithmetic was unprovable within arithmetic itself.\nBut a consequence of Meyer’s construction was that within his\narithmetic R# it was demonstrable by finitary means that whatever\ncontradictions there might happen to be, they could not adversely\naffect any numerical calculations. Hence Hilbert’s goal of\nconclusively demonstrating that mathematics is trouble-free proves\nlargely achievable as long as inconsistency-tolerant logics are used.\n \nThe arithmetical models used by Meyer and Mortensen later proved to\nallow inconsistent representation of the truth predicate. They also\npermit representation of structures beyond natural number arithmetic,\nsuch as rings and fields, including their order properties.\nAxiomatisations were also provided. Recently, the finite inconsistent\narithmetical collapse models, a strictly larger class than those\nstudied by Meyer and Mortensen, have been completely characterised by\nGraham Priest. Collapse models are obtained from classical models by\ncollapsing the domain down to congruence classes generated by various\ncongruence relations. When members of the same congruence class are\nidentified, the theories produced are inconsistent. For example,\nMeyer’s initial construction collapsed the integers under the\ncongruence modulo 2. This puts 0 and 2 in the same congruence\nclass, and in a suitable three-valued logic, both 0=2 and not-(0=2)\nhold. Priest showed that these models take a certain general form, see\nPriest (1997) and (2000). Strictly speaking, Priest went a little too\nfar in including “clique models”. This was corrected by\nParis and Pathmanathan (2006), and extended into the infinite by Paris\nand Sirokfskich (2008). Even more recently, Tedder (2015) obtained\naxiomatisations for the class of finite collapse models with a\ndifferent background logic, Avron’s A3.  \nOne could hardly ignore the examples of analysis and its special case,\nthe calculus. For a model-theoretic approach to these see Mortensen\n(1990, 1995)  \nNow Meyer’s original approach to the natural numbers, that is\nR#, was axiomatic rather than model-theoretic. The axiomatic approach\nhas also been taken in analysis by McKubre-Jordens and Weber\n(2012). In axiomatising analysis with a base of paraconsistent logic,\ntheir paper pushes Meyer’s approach to arithmetic via R# a long\nway further. These same authors (forthcoming) rework the theory of\nintegration as it was in Archimedes’ hands, which employs the\nmethod of exhaustion, using paraconsistent reasoning. This gives a\nresult “up to inconsistency”, which means that one is able\nto prove “Classical result or contradiction”. The\nclassical result can be then seen to be recapturable by the classical\nmove disjunctive syllogism applied to the classically-false\n(inconsistent) second disjunct.  \nIt is certainly important and worthy to pursue this direction, but a\nmild caution is entered here: the axiomatic project is a bit different\nfrom inconsistent mathematics. As noted earlier, Meyer in this phase\nwas consistentist – he sought a consistent theory with an\ninconsistency-tolerant logic. With similar motivation, he was also\nconcerned to try to settle what he called “the gamma\nproblem”, which was essentially the question of whether the\naxiomatic theory R# could be shown to contain classical Peano\narithmetic as a sub-theory. If this were so, then his proof of\nnontriviality for R# would immediately yield a new proof of the\nnegation consistency of classical Peano arithmetic! Note that this\nwould not be contrary to Godel’s Second Theorem, since\npresumably the proof of the gamma result would not be confined to\nfinitary techniques. (In the case of Meyer’s theory, it turned\nout to be not so.)  \nThere have proved to be many places throughout analysis where there\nare distinctive inconsistent insights. The examples in the remainder\nof this section are drawn from Mortensen (1995). For example: (1)\nRobinson’s (1974) non-standard analysis was based on\ninfinitesimals, quantities smaller than any real number, as well as\ntheir reciprocals, the infinite numbers. This has an inconsistent\nversion, which has some advantages for calculation in being able to\ndiscard higher-order infinitesimals. Interestingly, the theory of\ndifferentiation turned out to have these advantages, while the theory\nof integration did not. A similar result, using a different background\nlogic, was obtained by Da Costa (2000). (2) Another place to find\napplications of inconsistency in analysis is topology, where one\nreadily observes the practice of cutting and pasting spaces being\ndescribed as “identification” of one boundary with\nanother. One can show that this can be described in an inconsistent\ntheory in which the two boundaries are both identical and not\nidentical, and it can be further argued that this is the most natural\ndescription of the practice. (3) Yet another application is the class\nof inconsistent continuous functions. Not all functions which are\nclassically discontinuous are amenable of inconsistent treatment; but\nsome are, for example f(x)=0 for all x<0\nand f(x)=1 for all x≥0. The inconsistent\nextension replaces the first < by ≤, and has distinctive\nstructural properties. These inconsistent functions may well have some\napplication in dynamic systems in which there are discontinuous jumps,\nsuch as quantum measurement systems. Differentiating such functions\nleads to the delta functions, applied by Dirac to the study of quantum\nmeasurement. (4) Next, there is the well-known case of inconsistent\nsystems of linear equations, such as the system (i)\nx+y=1, plus (ii) x+y=2. Such\nsystems can potentially arise within the context of automated control.\nLittle work has been done classically to solve such systems, but it\ncan be shown that there are well-behaved solutions within inconsistent\nvector spaces. (5) Finally, one can note a further application in\ntopology and dynamics. Given a supposition which seems to be\nconceivable, namely that whatever happens or is true, happens or is\ntrue on an open set of (spacetime) points, one has that the logic of\ndynamically possible paths is open set logic, that is to say\nintuitionist logic, which supports incomplete theories par excellence.\nThis is because the natural account of the negation of a proposition\nin such a space says that it holds on the largest open set contained\nin the Boolean complement of the set of points on which the original\nproposition held, which is in general smaller than the Boolean\ncomplement. However, specifying a topological space by its closed sets\nis every bit as reasonable as specifying it by its open sets. Yet the\nlogic of closed sets is known to be paraconsistent, ie. supports\ninconsistent nontrivial theories; see Goodman (1981), for example.\nThus given the (alternative) supposition which also seems to be\nconceivable, namely that whatever is true is true on a closed set of\npoints, one has that inconsistent theories may well hold. This is\nbecause the natural account of the negation of a proposition, namely\nthat it holds on the smallest closed set containing the Boolean\nnegation of the proposition, means that on the overlapping boundary\nboth the proposition and its negation hold. Thus dynamical theories\ndetermine their own logic of possible propositions, and corresponding\ntheories which may be inconsistent, and are certainly as natural as\ntheir incomplete counterparts. \nOn closed set logic and boundaries as a natural setting for\ncontradictory theories, see Mortensen (2003, 2010). Weber and Cotnoir\n(2015) also explore the inconsistency of boundaries, arising from the\nincompatibility of the three principles (i) there are boundaries, (ii)\nspace is topologically connected, and (iii) discrete entities can be\nin contact (i.e., no space between them). This is a very interesting\nproblem, as all three are plausible; in particular there do seem to be\nboundaries in our world. An initially surprising feature of this\naccount is that boundaries come out as “empty”; after all,\nnull entities are contrary to the spirit of mereology. But this is not\nso shocking as it turns out that they are only empty in the sense that\nthey have members inconsistently.  \nCategory theory throws light on many mathematical structures. It has\ncertainly been proposed as an alternative foundation for mathematics.\nSuch generality inevitably runs into problems similar to those of\ncomprehension in set theory; see, e.g., Hatcher 1982 (pp.\n255–260). Hence there is the same possible application of\ninconsistent solutions. There is also an important collection of\ncategorial structures, the toposes, which support open set logic in\nexact parallel to the way sets support Boolean logic. This has been\ntaken by many to be a vindication of the foundational point of view of\nmathematical intuitionism. However, it can be proved that that toposes\nsupport closed set logic as readily as they support open set logic, to\ndate the only category-theoretic semantics for a paraconsistent logic.\nThis should not be viewed as an objection to intuitionism, however, so\nmuch as an argument that inconsistent theories are equally reasonable\nas items of mathematical study. See Mortensen (1995 Chap 11, co-author\nLavers). This position has now been taken up, extended and ably\ndefended by Estrada-Gonzales (2010, 2015a, 2015b). The same author\n(2016) undertakes to provide a category-theoretic description of\ntrivial theories, with the aim of showing that triviality is not such\nan uninteresting feature for mathematical theories to have. The\npresent author remains unconvinced, since a trivial theory is surely\nuseless for mathematical calculation; but the ingenuity of the\narguments must be conceded.  \nDuality between incompleteness/intuitionism and\ninconsistency/paraconsistency has at least two aspects. First there is\nthe above topological (open/closed) duality. Second there is Routley *\nduality. The Routley Star * of a set of sentences S, is defined\nas S* =df {A: ~A is not in\nS}. Discovered by the Routleys (1972) as a semantical tool for\nrelevant logics, the * operation dualises between inconsistent and\nincomplete theories of the large natural class of de Morgan logics.\nBoth kinds of duality interact as well, where the * gives distinctive\nduality and invariance theorems for open set and closed set\narithmetical theories. On the basis of these results, it is fair to\nargue that both kinds of mathematics, intuitionist and paraconsistent,\nare equally reasonable. \nA very recent development is the application to explaining the\nphenomenon of inconsistent pictures. The best known of these are\nperhaps M. C. Escher’s masterpieces Belvedere,\nWaterfall and Ascending and Descending. In fact the\ntradition goes back millennia to Pompeii. Escher seems to have derived\nmany of his intuitions from the Swedish artist Oscar Reutersvärd,\nwho began his inconsistent work in 1934. Escher also actively\ncollaborated with the English mathematician Roger Penrose. There have\nbeen several attempts to describe the mathematical structure of\ninconsistent pictures using classical consistent mathematics, by\ntheorists such as Cowan, Francis and Penrose. As argued in Mortensen\n(1997), however, no consistent mathematical theory can capture the\nsense that one is seeing an impossible thing. Only an inconsistent\ntheory can capture the content of that perception. This amounts to an\nappeal to a cognitive justification of paraconsistency. One can then\nproceed to display inconsistent theories which are candidates for such\ninconsistent contents. There is an analogy with classical mathematics\non this point: projective geometry is a classical consistent\nmathematical theory which is interesting because we are creatures with\nan eye, since it explains why it is that things look the way they do\nin perspective.  \nInconsistent geometrical studies are further developed in Mortensen\n(2002a), where category theory is applied to give a general\ndescription of the relationships between the various theories and\ntheir consistent cut-downs and incomplete duals. For an informal\naccount which highlights the difference between visual\n“paradoxes” and the philosophically more common paradoxes\nof language, such as the Liar, see Mortensen (2002b).  \nMore recently, inconsistent mathematical descriptions have been\nobtained for several classes of inconsistent figures, exemplified by\nEscher’s Cube (found in his print Belvedere), the\nReutersvärd-Penrose triangle, and others. See Mortensen (2010).\n \nRecently, an alternative technique for dealing generally with\ncontradictions has emerged. Brown and Priest (2004) have proposed a\ntechnique they call “Chunk and Permeate”, in which\nreasoning from inconsistent premisses proceeds by separating the\nassumptions into consistent theories (chunks), deriving appropriate\nconsequences, then passing (permeating) those consequences to a\ndifferent chunk for further consequences to be derived. They suggest\nthat Newton’s original reasoning in taking derivates in the\ncalculus, was of this form. This is an interesting and novel approach,\nthough it must meet the objection that to believe a conclusion\nobtained on this basis, one should believe all the premisses equally;\nand so an argument of the more common form, appealing to all the\npremisses without fragmenting them, should be eventually forthcoming.\nThe objection is thus that Chunk and Permeate is part of the context\nof discovery rather than the context of justification. \nRecently, Benham et. al. (2014) have extended these methods\nto the Dirac delta function. This broadens the class of applications,\nand so strengthens the technique. However, it also becomes clear\nthere, that there is a close parallel between (one large class of)\nChunk and Permeate applications, and (consistent) non-standard\nanalysis: wherever Chunk and Permeate takes a derivative by shifting\nchunks to one where infinitesimals are zero, non-standard analysis\ntakes a derivative by defining derivatives to be “standard parts\nonly”. Of course, equivalence between these two techniques does\nnot show which is explanatorily deeper. Developments are to be awaited\nwith interest. \nTo conclude: there has been appearing lately quite a bit of\nphilosophical material, that is sympathetic to the cause of\ninconsistent mathematics. Colyvan (2000) addresses the issue that\ninconsistent mathematical theories imply inconsistent mathematical\nobjects as their subject-matters. He also takes up the important task\nof providing an account of how inconsistent mathematics can have a\nbranch which is applied mathematics. Priest (2013), like\nColyvan, notes that inconsistent mathematics adds to the platonist\nmix. Berto (2007) usefully surveys paradoxes and foundational issues,\nand sets out some of the arithmetical results that bear on important\nphilosophical issues like the Incompleteness Theorems. Van Bendegem\n(2014) pursues the interesting motivation that change is always a\nstate of anomaly, so that always changing implies always anomalous.\nExamples include infinitesimals, complex numbers and infinity. Caution\nshould be adopted over thinking that inconsistency is always\nanomalous, however, if only because it is simply more material for\nmathematical study.  \nIt should be emphasised again that these structures do not in any way\nchallenge or repudiate existing mathematics, but rather extend our\nconception of what is mathematically possible. This, in turn, sharpens\nthe issue of Mathematical Pluralism; see e.g., Davies (2005), Hellman\nand Bell (2006), or Priest (2013). Various authors have different\nversions of mathematical pluralism, but it is something along the\nlines that incompatible mathematical theories can be equally true. The\ncase for mathematical pluralism rests on the observation that there\nare different mathematical “universes” in which different,\nindeed incompatible, mathematical theorems or laws hold. Well-known\nexamples are the incompatibility between classical mathematics and\nintuitionist mathematics, and the incompatibility between ZF-like\nuniverses of sets respectively with, and without, the Axiom of Choice.\nIt seems absurd to say that ZF with Choice is true mathematics and ZF\nwithout Choice is false mathematics, if they are both legitimate\nexamples of mathematically well-behaved theories.  \nThe primary question for the philosophy of mathematics is surely\nwhat is mathematics. Duality operations like topological\nduality or Routley* reinforce the point that incomplete/inconsistent\nduals are equally reasonable as examples of mathematics. From this\npoint of view, disputes about which of intuitionist or classical or\ninconsistent mathematics to accept seem pointless; they are all part\nof the subject matter of mathematics. This point is made effectively\nby Shapiro (2014, in contrast see his 2002). Shapiro’s\ndistinctive position has other ingredients: mathematics as the science\nof structure, and mathematical pluralism implying logical pluralism\n(on logical pluralism see also Beall and Restall 2006); but we do not\ntake these up here.  \nFor what it is worth, the present writer thinks that some version of\nmathematical pluralism is obviously true, if one takes mathematics to\nbe firstly about mathematical theories allowing for inconsistency ,\nand only secondly about the objects internal to those theories. There\nis, of course, no problem about incompatible theories, as structures\nof propositions, co-existing. The primacy of theories fits, too, with\nthe natural observation that the epistemology of mathematics is\ndeductive proof. It is only if one takes as a starting point the\nprimacy of the mathematical object as the truth-maker of theories,\nthat one has to worry about how their objects manage to co-exist.","contact.mail":"Chris.Mortensen@adelaide.edu.au","contact.domain":"adelaide.edu.au"}]
