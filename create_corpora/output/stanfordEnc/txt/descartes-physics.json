Not only did Descartes provide\nthe first distinctly modern formulation of laws of nature and a\nconservation principle of motion, but he also constructed what would\nbecome the most popular theory of planetary motion of the late\nseventeenth century. As the renowned historian of science Clifford\nTruesdell has observed, “[Descartes’ physics] is the beginning\nof theory in the modern sense” (Truesdell 1984, 6). Yet, for all\nof the forward-looking, seemingly modern, aspects of Descartes’\nphysics, many of Descartes’ physical hypotheses bear a close kinship\nwith the Aristotelian-influenced science of late-Medieval and\nRenaissance Scholasticism. It is this unique amalgam of both old and\nnew concepts of the physical world that may account for the current\nrevival of scholarly interest in Descartes’ physics.\n\n\n\nDespite his fame as a philosopher of purely metaphysical problems,\nsuch as the relation of the soul and body, or God’s existence, it\nwould not be incorrect to conclude that Descartes was a scientist\nfirst and a philosopher second. Not only did Descartes’ interest and\nwork in science extend throughout his entire scholarly career, but\nsome of his most important metaphysical works (e.g., the\nMeditations) were prompted by a perceived need to equip his\nscience with a metaphysical foundation that would be acceptable to the\nAristotelian-influenced Scholastics. Yet, one must be careful not to\nimpose modern conceptions on the “natural philosophy” of\nearlier centuries, for much seventeenth century science was\npractically indistinguishable from the more speculative metaphysics of\nthe era (and thus the label “natural philosophy” is\nparticularly apt for describing seventeenth century science). In fact,\nmuch of Descartes’ science is only part of a much larger system that\nembraces all areas of philosophical investigation, including both his\nphysics and metaphysics. \n\nThe awakening of Descartes’ interest in physics is often dated to late\n1618, when Descartes first met Isaac Beeckman, an amateur scientist\nand mathematician who championed the new “mechanical”\nphilosophy. The mechanical philosophy’s explanation of natural\nphenomena, which Descartes quickly adopted, rejected the use of\nScholastic substantial forms \n (see Section 2).  \n Rather, the mechanical approach favored a contact or impact model of\nthe interaction of small, unobservable “corpuscles” of\nmatter (which possess only a limited number of mainly geometric\nproperties, such as size, motion, shape, etc.). Over the course of the\nnext decade, Descartes worked on a large number of problems in both\nscience and mathematics, with particular emphasis on the theory of\nlight, mechanics (including hydrostatics), and the free-fall of\nterrestrial bodies. Much of Descartes’ output at this time is both\nhighly mathematical and concerns only specific physical problems, not\nunlike the work of his contemporary Galileo. One of the\naccomplishments of these years includes his discovery of the law of\nrefraction, often called Snell’s law: when light passes from one\nmedium into another, the sine of the angle of incidence maintains a\nconstant ratio to the sine of the angle of refraction. By the\nbeginning of the 1630s, however, Descartes embarked on a more\nambitious plan to construct a systematic theory of knowledge,\nincluding physics. The result was The World (1633), an\nimportant text in that it essentially contains the blueprints of the\nmechanical/geometric physics, as well as the vortex theory of\nplanetary motion, that Descartes would continue to refine and develop\nover the course of his scientific career. Before publishing the\ntreatise, however, he learned of the Church’s (1633)\ncondemnation of Galileo for promoting Copernicanism, which prompted\nDescartes to withdraw his work from publication (since Descartes also\nadvanced Copernicanism in The World). In the 1630s, the\npublication of the Geometry, the Optics, and the\nMeteorology, along with a philosophical introduction,\nDiscourse on the Method (1637) further presented Cartesian\nhypotheses on such topics as the law of refraction, vision, and the\nrainbow. Yet, besides a brief sketch of his metaphysics and physics in\nthe Discourse (Parts IV and V), a comprehensive treatment of\nhis physics had to await the 1644 publication of the Principles of\nPhilosophy. This work not only represents Descartes’ most fully\ndeveloped and exhaustive investigation of physics, it also provides\nthe metaphysical underpinnings of his physical system (in Part I). As\nan embodiment of his mature views, the Principles will thus\nform the basis of our examination of Cartesian physics. \n\nThe translations, with minor variations, are from Descartes 1979,\n1983, 1984a, 1984b, 1991, but the passages are identified with respect\nto the Adam and Tannery edition of the Oeuvres de Descartes\n(1976) according to the standard convention: “AT”,\nfollowed by volume and page number. Passages cited from the\nPrinciples, however, will be identified by “Pr”,\nfollowed by volume and article, and with a final “F”\nindicating the inclusion of new material from the French translation\nof 1647. \n\nFor recent in-depth examinations of Descartes’ physics, see\nGarber 1992a and Des Chene 1996. Schuster 2014 covers Descartes’\nearly physics, from 1618 to 1633. A concise survey of Cartesian\nphysics can be found in Garber 1992b. The scientific career of\nDescartes, with special emphasis on his physics, is presented in Shea\n1991; see also Gaukroger, Schuster, Sutton 2000 for the many aspects\nof his natural philosophy. Gaukroger 2002 examines the Principles\nof Philosophy, especially the physics, whereas Slowik 2002\nfocuses primarily on Cartesian space and relational motion. The\nhistorical background to much in Descartes’ physics is also\ntreated in Ariew 2011. On methodology in Descartes’ natural\nphilosophy, see Smith 2009, while Hattab 2009 and Machamer and McGuire\n2009 cover the development of various ideas important to his\nphysics. \n\nLike many of his contemporaries (e.g., Galileo and Gassendi),\nDescartes devised his mechanical theory in large part to refute the\nwidely held Aristotelian-based Scholastic explanation of natural\nphenomena that employed an ontology of “substantial forms”\nand “primary matter”. Briefly, Scholastic natural\nphilosophy viewed a material body as comprising both an inert\nproperty-less substratum (primary matter) and a quality-bearing\nessence (substantial form), with the latter providing the body’s\ncausal capacities. A quantity of matter, for example, possesses\nweight, color, texture, and all of the other bodily properties, only\nin virtue of being conjoined with a determinate form (of a billiard\nball, chair, etc.). Descartes admits that he had earlier held such a\nview of gravity, envisioning the substantial form as a kind of\ngoal-directed (teleological) mental property of bodies: “what\nmakes it especially clear that my idea of gravity was taken largely\nfrom the idea I had of the mind is the fact that I thought that\ngravity carried bodies towards the centre of the earth as if it had\nsome knowledge of the centre within itself. For this surely could not\nhappen without knowledge, and there can be any knowledge except in a\nmind” (AT VII 442). In a revealing passage from The\nWorld, Descartes declares the Scholastic hypothesis to be both an\nunintelligible and inadequate methodological approach to explaining\nnatural phenomena: \n\nDescartes’ plan is to reduce the class of metaphysically suspect\nproperties, such as heat, weight, taste, to the empirically\nquantifiable attributes of size, shape, and motion. In other words,\nDescartes intends to replace the “mentally” influenced\ndepiction of physical qualities in Scholastic natural philosophy with\na theory that requires only the properties of extension to describe\nthe manifest order of the natural world. Consequently, Descartes was\nan early exponent of what came to be known as the\n“primary/secondary” property distinction, a concept that\nwas very much “in the air” among the critics of\nScholasticism. \n\nNevertheless, even if Descartes’ mechanistic natural philosophy\nshunned the metaphysics of substantial forms, his underlying\nmethodology or approach to science remained very close to the\nScholastic tradition. By the time of the composition of the\nPrinciples, Descartes had formulated a method that, like the\nScholastics, strived to explain natural phenomena based on the\nallegedly simple and irrefutable “facts” and/or\nobservations, drawn from rational reflection on concepts or from\neveryday experience, about the most fundamental aspects of reality.\nThese supposedly basic facts thereby provide the requisite\nmetaphysical foundation for his physical hypotheses: in other words,\none proceeds from our “clear and distinct” knowledge of\ngeneral metaphysical items, such as the nature of material substance\nand its modes, to derive particular conclusions on specific types of\nphysical processes, for instance the laws of nature. This method of\nconducting science is quite contrary to the modern approach, needless\nto say, since modern scientists do not first engage in a metaphysical\nsearch for first principles on which to base their work. Yet, this is\nexactly the criticism that Descartes leveled at Galileo’s physics (in\na letter to Mersenne from 1638): “without having considered the\nfirst causes of nature, [Galileo] has merely looked for the\nexplanations of a few particular effects, and he has thereby built\nwithout foundations” (AT II 380; see, also, the Preface to the\nFrench translation of the Principles, AT IXB 5–11). The\nstructure of the Principles, Descartes’ most comprehensive\nscientific work, reflects these priorities: Part I recapitulates the\narguments (well-known from the Meditations) for the existence\nof God, mental substance, and other metaphysical topics; whereas the\nremaining Parts proceed to explain the nature of material substance,\nphysics, cosmology, geology, and other branches of science, supposedly\nbased on these fundamental metaphysical truths. This preoccupation\nwith metaphysical foundations, and the causal explanations of natural\nphenomena derived from them, might also account for the absence in the\nPrinciples of Descartes’ more mathematical work in physics,\nsuch as his discovery of the law of light refraction. As he argued in\nthe Rules for the Direction of the Mind (1628), pure\nmathematicians are only concerned with finding ratios and proportions,\nwhereas natural philosophers are intent on understanding nature (AT X\n393–395). The development of modern physics, which is inextricably\nintertwined with modern mathematics, thus stands in sharp contrast to\nthe latent Scholasticism evident in Descartes’ metaphysical approach\nto physics. \n\nDescartes’ many hypotheses concerning space and body are best\nappreciated when viewed as a continuation of a long debate within\nMedieval/Renaissance philosophy centered upon the Aristotelian dictum\nthat whatever possessed dimensionality was body (see, Grant 1981).\nWhile some philosophers, such as Telesio, Campanella, and Bruno, held\nspace to be always filled with matter (i.e., a plenum) yet somehow\nindependent of matter, others, like Patrizi and Gassendi, endorsed a\nmore absolutist notion that allowed spaces totally devoid of matter\n(i.e., vacuum). Rejecting these anti-Aristotelian ideas of empty\nspace, Descartes equated the defining property, or\n“essence”, of material substance with three-dimensional\nspatial extension: “the extension in length, breadth, and depth\nwhich constitutes the space occupied by a body, is exactly the same as\nthat which constitutes the body” (Pr II 10). Consequently, there\ncannot exist a space separate from body (Pr II 16), since all spatial\nextension simply is body (and he rejects the possibility of a vacuum\nthat is not extended). If, for example, God removed the matter within\na vessel (such that nothing remained), then the sides of the vessel\nwould immediately become contiguous (but not through motion; Pr II\n18). Descartes’ actual concept of “space” can be\nregarded as a sort of conceptual abstraction from this bodily spatial\nextension, which he also dubs “internal place”: \n\nRelative to an arbitrarily chosen set of bodies, it is thus possible\nto refer to the abstract (generic) spatial extension of a portion of\nthe plenum that different extended bodies successively\n“occupy”; and, presumably, by this process of abstraction\nthe internal place of the entire plenum can be likewise constructed.\nDescartes takes a similar view of time, which is judged to be a\ngeneralized abstraction from the “durations” of particular\nbodies (where duration is an attribute of substance; Pr II 56–57; see\nGorham 2007 for more on time in Descartes). Also like the Scholastics,\nDescartes rejects any form of atomism, which is the view that there\nexists a smallest indivisible particle of matter.  Rather, he holds\nthat since any given spatially extended length is divisible in\nthought, thus God has the power to actually divide it (Pr II 20). The\nmaterial entities that interact in Descartes’ physics come in distinct\nunits or corpuscles (see Section 7), which explains\nthe “corpuscularian” title often attributed to his\nmechanical system, but these corpuscles are not indivisible. \n\nDescartes’ Principles of Philosophy also presents his most extensive\ndiscussion of the phenomena of motion, which is defined as “the\ntransfer of one piece of matter or of one body, from the neighborhood\nof those bodies immediately contiguous to it and considered at rest,\ninto the neighborhood of others” (Pr II 25). Descartes attempts\nto distinguish his “proper” conception of motion, as a\nchange of the “neighborhood” of contiguous bodies, from\nthe common or “vulgar” conception of motion, which is\nchange of internal place (Pr II 10–15, 24–28). The surface of these\ncontaining bodies (that border the contained body) is also called the\n“external place” of the contained body. Descartes notes\nthat the vulgar concept of motion allows a body to simultaneously take\npart in many (possibly contradictory) motions, as when a sitting\npassenger on a ship views himself as at rest relative to the parts of\nthe ship, but not at rest relative to the shore (Pr II 24). Yet, when\nmotion is viewed as a translation of the contiguous neighborhood, a\nbody can only partake in one motion, which dispels the apparent\ncontradiction (since the body must either be at rest, or in\ntranslation away from, its contiguous neighborhood). \n\nNevertheless, Descartes’ hypothesis of motion may sanction a\nspecies of relative motion, since his phrase, “considered at\nrest”, implies that the choice of which bodies are at rest or in\nmotion is purely arbitrary. According to the “relational”\ntheory (or at least the more strict versions of relationism), space,\ntime, and motion are just relations among bodies, and not separately\nexisting entities or properties that are in any way independent of\nmaterial bodies. Motion only exists as a “relative\ndifference” among bodies: that is, the bodies do not possess\nindividual, determinate properties of speed, velocity, acceleration\n(e.g., body C has the speed property of “5 miles per\nhour”); rather, all that really exists is a difference in their\nrelative speed, velocity, and acceleration (e.g., there is a speed\ndifference among bodies C and B of “5 miles\nper hour”). Several passages in Descartes’ analysis of\nmotion seem to support this strong variety of relationism: “we\ncannot conceive of the body AB being transported from the\nvicinity of the body CD without also understanding that the\nbody CD is transported from the vicinity of the body\nAB” (Pr II 29). Hence, “all the real and positive\nproperties which are in moving bodies, and by virtue of which we say\nthey move, are also found in those [bodies] contiguous to them, even\nthough we consider the second group to be at rest” (Pr II\n30). This form of relational motion has been dubbed the\n“reciprocity of transfer” in the recent literature. Yet,\nas will be discussed in a later section, Descartes also holds that\nrest and motion are different bodily states, a view that is\nincompatible with a strict relationism as regards motion. Therefore,\nCartesian reciprocity of transfer only satisfies relationism (along\nwith its ban on individual bodily states of motion) for moving bodies\n(i.e., when there is a translation manifest between a body and its\ncontiguous neighborhood). Many of the difficulties associated with\nCartesian physics can be traced to the enormous ontological burden\nthat Descartes places on his hypothesis of motion. In a later section\nwe will examine the problem of integrating his account of motion with\nthe Cartesian laws of nature, but a brief discussion of the apparent\ncircularity of Descartes’ definitions of motion and body is\nrequired at this point. After describing motion as the transference of\na body from the surrounding neighborhood of bodies, Descartes states\nthat by “one body, or one part of matter, I here understand\neverything which is simultaneously transported” (Pr II 25). The\nproblem, of course, is that Descartes has defined motion as a change\nof contiguous bodies, and then proceeds to define body as that which\nmoves (translates, transports). Although this circularity threatens\nthe entire edifice of Cartesian physics, it is possible that Descartes\nintended both motion and body to possess an equal ontological\nimportance in his theory, such that neither is the more fundamental\nnotion (which serves as the basis for constructing or defining the\nother notion). Yet, their intrinsic interrelationship entails that any\nattempted definition of one must inevitably incorporate the other. The\nproblem with this reconstruction of Descartes’ reasoning,\nhowever, is that Descartes explicitly deems motion to be a\n“mode” of extension; where a mode is a lesser ontological\ncategory that, roughly, can be understood as a way that extension\nmanifests itself, or as a “property” of extension (Pr I\n53; shape is also mentioned as a mode of extension).  Finally, another\ndifficulty implicit in Descartes’ theory is the fact that a\nresting body, according to the definition of body and place, would\nseem to “blend” into the surrounding plenum: that is, if a\nbody is “everything which is simultaneously transported”,\nthen it is not possible to discern a resting body from the surrounding\nplenum matter that forms the external place of that resting body. In\naddition, Descartes rejects any explanation of the solidity of a body\nthat employs a bond among its particles (since the bond itself would\nbe either a substance or property, and thus the solidity of the bond\nwould presumably need to be explained; Pr II 55). A macroscopic\nmaterial body is, essentially, held together just by the relative rest\nof its constituent material parts.  This raises the obvious difficulty\nthat the impact of such bodies should result in their dispersion or\ndestruction (for there is nothing to hold them together). These sorts\nof complications prompted many later natural philosophers, who were\ngenerally sympathetic to Descartes’ mechanical philosophy, to\nsearch for an internal property of matter that could serve as a type\nof individuating and constitutive principle for bodies; e.g.,\nLeibniz’ utilization of “force”. \n\nRelated to the alleged circularity of the definitions of motion and\nbody, as well as the problem of resting bodies, is the difficulty in\nreconciling Descartes’ definition of “substance”\nwith his claim that individual bodies are substances. If, as Descartes\nbelieves, substances are not dependent on other things in order to\nexist (Pr I 51), then any part of extension (which is a body, via Pr\nII 10, as explained above) would not qualify as a substance since it\ndepend on its contiguous neighbors to delimit and define its\nboundary. Yet, Descartes often declares that individual bodies are\nsubstances; e.g., “the two halves of a portion of matter, no\nmatter how small they may be, are two complete substances” (AT\nIII 447). One of the most popular replies to this difficulty, from\nSpinoza (Ethics, Part I, Prop. 15) to many contemporary\ncommentators (e.g., Keeling 1968, Lennon 1993, Sowaal 2004, and\nnumerous others), is to declare that only the whole plenum is a\nsubstance, and not any of its constituent parts. The problem with this\nattempted solution, however, is that it lacks textual support, as is\nevident in the Pr I 51 quotation above. Likewise, some of these\nreconstructions, such as Lennon’s, would seem to violate central\naspects of Cartesian physics and metaphysics, for he interprets motion\nas a phenomenal contribution of the mind, such that the plenum and its\nparts do not move or change at all. Along these same lines, some\nscholars (e.g., Schaffer 2009) have concluded that Descartes was a\nsupersubstantivalist, i.e., the view that space (spacetime, in the\nmodern setting) is the only predicable or fundamental substance. While\nDescartes’ identification of corporeal substance and space (see\nabove, Pr II 10) might seem to support this reading,\nsupersubstantivalism takes space as primary, and matter as secondary\nor derived from space (see Sklar 1974, 222). Descartes, on the\ncontrary, takes matter or body as primary and space as a derived,\nabstract concept: “the same extension which constitutes the\nnature of body also constitutes the nature of space, and . . . these\ntwo things differ only in the way that the nature of the genus or\nspecies differs from that of the individual” (Pr II 11). Whereas\nspace is a genus or species concept for Descartes (which is a\nuniversal; Pr I 59), space is the individual for the\nsupersubstantivalist, and thus ascribing supersubstantivalism to\nDescartes violates his nominalism (Pr II 8). Indeed, the reason that\nDescartes seeks to equate bodily and spatial extension in this part of\nthe Principles is that he strives to reject any view that\ntreats space as a separate, usually incorporeal, entity that is\nindependent of matter (e.g., the popular imaginary space tradition,\nwhich was a forerunner to the absolutist or substantivalist\nconception): “That corporeal substance, when distinguished from\nits quantity or extension, is confusedly conceived as if it were\nincorporeal” (Pr II 9). \n\nForemost among the achievements of Descartes’ physics are the three\nlaws of nature (which, essentially, are laws of bodily motion).\nNewton’s own laws of motion would be modeled on this Cartesian\nbreakthrough, as is readily apparent in Descartes’ first two laws of\nnature: the first states “that each thing, as far as is in its\npower, always remains in the same state; and that consequently, when\nit is once moved, it always continues to move” (Pr II 37), while\nthe second holds that “all movement is, of itself, along\nstraight lines” (Pr II 39; these two would later be incorporated\ninto Newton’s first law of motion). By declaring that motion and rest\nare primitive states of material bodies without need of\nfurther explanation, and that bodies only change their state when\nacted upon by an external cause, it is not an exaggeration to claim\nthat Descartes helped to lay the foundation for the modern theory of\ndynamics (which studies the motion of bodies under the action of\nforces). For the Aristotelian-influenced Scholastics who had\nendeavored to ascertain the causal principles responsible for the\n“violent” motions of terrestrial bodies (as opposed to\ntheir “natural” motions to specific regions of the\nplenum), the explanation for these forced, unnatural motions seemed to\nlie in some type of internal bodily property, or external agent, that\nwas temporarily possessed by, or applied to, a body—an\nexplanation that accounts for the fact that the body’s motion both\noriginates and concludes in a state of rest (since, while on the\nearth’s surface, the terrestrial element has no natural\nmotions). According to the medieval “impetus” theory, for\nexample, these violent motions occur when a quality is directly\ntransferred to a body from a moving or constrained source, say, from a\nstretched bow to the waiting arrow. This property causes the observed\nbodily motion until such time that it is completely exhausted, thus\nbringing about a cessation of the violent movement (and the arrow’s\nfall back to earth). Implicit in the Scholastic view is the basic\nbelief that a terrestrial body continuously resists change from a\nstate of rest while situated upon the earth, since the depletion of\nthe impetus property eventually effects a corresponding return of the\nbody’s original motionless, earthbound condition. Descartes, on the\nother hand, interpreted the phenomena of motion in an entirely new\nlight, for he accepts the existence of inertial motion (uniform or\nnon-accelerating motion) as a natural bodily state alongside, and on\nequal footing with, the notion of bodily rest. He argues,\n“because experience seems to have proved it to us on many\noccasions, we are still inclined to believe that all movements cease\nby virtue of their own nature, or that bodies have a tendency towards\nrest. Yet this is assuredly in complete contradiction to the laws of\nnature; for rest is the opposite of movement, and nothing moves by\nvirtue of its own nature towards its opposite or own\ndestruction” (Pr II 37). While one can find several natural\nphilosophers whose earlier or contemporary work strongly foreshadowed\nDescartes’ achievement in the first and second laws—namely,\nGalileo and Isaac Beeckman (see Arthur 2007)—the precise\nformulation put forward in the Principles of Philosophy is\nquite unique (especially as regards the second law, since both Galileo\nand Beeckman appear to sanction a form of circular inertial motion,\nwhich possibly betrays the influence of the Scholastic’s circular\nmotion of the celestial element). A fascinating blending of\nScholasticism and the new physics is also evident in the above\nquotation, since Descartes invokes the logic of contrary properties in\nhis statement that “nothing moves by virtue of its own nature\ntowards its opposite or own destruction”. That is, rest and\nmotion are opposite or contrary states, and since opposite states\ncannot (via the Scholastic principle) transform into one another, it\nfollows that a body at rest will remains at rest and a body in motion\nwill remains in motion. Consequently, Descartes has employed a\nScholastic/Medieval argument to ground what is possibly the most\nimportant concept in the formation of modern physics, namely\ninertia. Yet, it is important to note that Descartes’ first and second\nlaws do not correspond to the modern concept of inertia, since he\nincorrectly regards (uniform, non-accelerating) motion and rest as\ndifferent bodily states, whereas modern theory dictates that they are\nthe same state. \n\nWhile Descartes’ first and second laws deal with the rest and motion\nof individual bodies, the third law of motion is expressly designed to\nreveal the properties exhibited among several bodies during their\ncollisions and interactions. In short, the third law addresses the\nbehavior of bodies under the normal conditions in his matter-filled\nworld; when they collide: “The third law: that a body, upon\ncoming in contact with a stronger one, loses none of its motion; but\nthat, upon coming in contact with a weaker one, it loses as much as it\ntransfers to that weaker body” (Pr II 40). In the following\nsections of the Principles, Descartes makes explicit the\nconserved quantity mentioned in this third law: \n\nAs a consequence of his first law of motion, Descartes insists that\nthe quantity conserved in collisions equals the combined sum of the\nproducts of size and speed of each impacting body. Although a\ndifficult concept, the “size” of a body roughly\ncorresponds to its volume, with surface area playing an indirect role\nas well. This conserved quantity, which Descartes refers to\nindiscriminately as “motion” or “quantity of\nmotion”, is historically significant in that it marks one of the\nfirst attempts to locate an invariant or unchanging feature of bodily\ninteractions. To give an example, if a body B of size 3 and\nspeed 5 collides with a body C of size 2 and speed 4, then\nthe total quantity of motion of the system is 23, a quantity which\nremains preserved after the collision even though the bodies may\npossess different speeds. \n\nMoreover, Descartes envisions the conservation of quantity of motion\nas one of the fundamental governing principles of the entire cosmos.\nWhen God created the universe, he reasons, a certain finite amount of\nmotion (quantity of motion) was transmitted to its material occupants;\na quantity, moreover, that God continuously preserves at each\nsucceeding moment. (For more on the difficult issue of God’s\ncontinuous recreation or preservation of the material world, see,\ne.g., Gorham 2004, Hattab 2007, and Schmaltz 2008).  \n\nIn the Principles, Descartes conservation law only recognizes\na body’s degree of motion, which correlates to the scalar quantity\n“speed”, rather than the vectorial notion\n“velocity” (which is speed in a given direction). This\ndistinction, between speed and velocity, surfaces in Descartes’ seven\nrules of impact, which spell out in precise detail the outcomes of\nbodily collisions (although these rules only describe the collisions\nbetween two bodies traveling along the same straight line). Descartes’\nutilization of the concept of speed is manifest throughout the\nrules. For example: \n\nAstonishingly, Descartes claims that a smaller body, regardless of its\nspeed, can never move a larger stationary body. While obviously\ncontradicting common experience, the fourth collision rule does nicely\ndemonstrate the scalar nature of speed, as well as the primary\nimportance of quantity of motion, in Cartesian dynamics. In this rule,\nDescartes faces the problem of preserving the total quantity of motion\nin situations distinguished by the larger body’s complete rest, and\nthus zero value of quantity of motion. Descartes conserves\nthe joint quantity of motion by equipping the stationary object\nC with a resisting force sufficient to deflect the moving\nbody B, a solution that does uphold the quantity of motion in\ncases where C is at rest.  That is, since B merely\nchanges its direction of inertial motion, and not its size or degree\nof speed (and C equals zero throughout the interaction), the\ntotal quantity of motion of the system is preserved.  For Descartes,\nreversing the direction of B’s motion does not alter the\ntotal quantity of motion, a conclusion that is in sharp contrast to\nthe later hypothesis, usually associated with Newton and Leibniz, that\nregards a change in direction as a negation of the initial speed\n(i.e., velocity). Thus, by failing to foresee the importance of\nconjoining direction and speed, Descartes’ law falls just short of the\nmodern law for the conservation of momentum. \n\nIn this context, the complex notion of “determination”\nshould be discussed, since it approximately corresponds to the\ncomposite direction of a body’s quantity of motion. In some passages,\nDescartes apparently refers to the direction of a body’s motion as its\ndetermination: “there is a difference between motion considered\nin itself, and its determination in some direction; this difference\nmakes it possible for the determination to be changed while the\nquantity of motion remains intact” (Pr II 41). Yet, a single\nmotion does not have just one determination, as is clear in his\ncritique of Hobbes’ interpretation of determinations: “What he\n[Hobbes] goes on to say, namely that a ‘motion has only one\ndetermination,’ is just like my saying that an extended thing\nhas only a single shape. Yet this does not prevent the shape being\ndivided into several components, just as can be done with the\ndetermination of motion” (April 21, 1641; AT III 356). In the\nsame way that a particular shape can be partitioned into diverse\ncomponent figures, so a particular determination can be decomposed\ninto various constituent directions. In his Optics, published\nin 1637, Descartes’ derivation of his law of refraction\nseemingly endorses this interpretation of determinations. If a ball is\npropelled downwards from left to right at a 45 degree angle, and then\npierces a thin linen sheet, it will continue to move to the right\nafter piercing the sheet but now at an angle nearly parallel with the\nhorizon. Descartes reasons that this modification of direction (from\nthe 45 degree angle to a smaller angle) is the net result of a\nreduction in the ball’s downward determination through collision with\nthe sheet, “while the one [determination] which was making the\nball tend to the right must always remain the same as it was, because\nthe sheet offers no opposition at all to the determination in this\ndirection” (see Figure 1). Figure 1.\nDiagram from the Optics. \n\nDescartes’ determination hypothesis also incorporates a certain\nquantitative element, as revealed in a further controversial\nhypothesis that is often described as the “principle of least\nmodal action”. In a letter to Clerselier (February 17th, 1645),\nDescartes explains: \n\nThis principle can be illustrated with respect to our previous example\ninvolving the fourth collision rule. If both B and C\nwere to depart at the same speed and in the same direction after\nimpact, it would be necessary for the smaller body B to\ntransfer at least half of its quantity of motion to the larger\nstationary body C. Yet, Descartes reasons that it is easier\nfor B in this situation to merely reverse it direction than\nto transfer its motion: \n\nConsequently, reversing B’s direction of motion, a change of\none mode (determination), constitutes a lesser modal change than a\ntransference of motion between two bodies, which alters two modes\n(speed and determination). In this passage, it is important to note\nthat if B were to transfer motion to C, it would\nchange both half of B’s speed and half of its determination,\neven though the direction of B’s quantity of motion is\npreserved. As a result, a body’s determination is apparently linked to\nits magnitude of speed. \n\nAs discussed in previous sections, there are various ways in which\nDescartes’ laws of motion violate a strict relationism. One of the\nmost problematic instances involves the relational compatibility of\nthe fourth and fifth collision rules. Whereas the fourth rule\nconcludes that a large object remains at rest during impact with a\nsmaller moving body, such that the smaller body is deflected back\nalong its initial path, the fifth rule concludes that a large body\nwill move a smaller stationary object, “transferring to [the\nsmaller body] as much of its motion as would permit the two to travel\nsubsequently at the same speed” (Pr II 50). From a relational\nstandpoint, however, rules four and five constitute the same type of\ncollision, since they both involve the interaction of a small and\nlarge body with the same relative motion (or speed difference) between\nthem. One might be tempted to appeal to the basic Cartesian tenet that\nmotion and rest are different intrinsic states of bodies, or the\nreciprocity of transfer thesis, to circumvent this difficulty (see\nsection 3): i.e., there is an ontological difference between a body\nthat is, or is not, undergoing a translation with respect to its\ncontiguous neighborhood, and this is sufficient to distinguish the\ncase of rule four from rule five (since the large body is really at\nrest in four, and really in motion in five). \n\nThe problem with this line of reasoning, however, is that it only\nworks if one presupposes that the two bodies are approaching one\nanother, and this is not a feature of the system that can be captured\nby sole reference to the contiguous neighborhood of each individual\nbody. Even if there is reciprocity of transfer between a body and its\nneighborhood, it is still not possible to determine which collision\nrule the impact will fall under, or if the bodies will even collide at\nall, unless some reference frame is referred to that can compute the\nmotion of both bodies relative to one another. Suppose, for instance,\nthat a certain spatial distance separates two bodies, and that one of\nthe bodies is, and the other is not, undergoing a translation relative\nto its neighboring bodies. Given this scenario, it is not possible to\ndetermine if; (i) the translating body is approaching the\nnon-translating body, or (ii) the spatial interval between them\nremains fixed and the translating body simply undergoes a change of\nneighborhood (i.e., the neighborhood moves relative to a stationary\nbody). In short, Descartes’ reciprocity of transfer thesis\nunderdetermines the outcome of his bodily collisions, as well as the\ncapacity to apply, and make predictions from, the Cartesian collision\nrules. The context of the collision rules also supports the view that\nthe motions of the impacting bodies are determined from an external\nreference frame, rather than from the local translation of their\ncontiguous neighborhoods. In elucidating the fourth rule, for\ninstance, Descartes states that B could never move C\n“no matter how great the speed at which B might\napproach C” (Pr II 49)—and only an external perspective,\nnot linked to the bodily reciprocity of transfer, could determine that\nB “approaches” C. Such admissions make\nit very difficult to reconcile Descartes’ physics with a strict\nrelational theory of space and motion, although it may be compatible\nwith weaker forms of relationism that can countenance various external\nreference frames, structures, or other methods for determining the\nindividual states of bodily motion. These weaker relationist\nstrategies (or even non-relational, absolutist interpretations) of\nDescartes’ physics come at a high price, however, since the\nreciprocity of transfer thesis must be abandoned. For these reasons,\nit is more likely that Descartes’ reciprocity of transfer thesis is\nintended to counter any interpretation that regards motion as caused\nby a bodily property, as some Scholastics had held (such as Buridan),\nrather then defend relational motion (see Maier 1982 on these earlier\nviews of motion). That is, if there is nothing in the moving body that\ndiffers from its neighborhood of contiguous bodies (see Pr II 30),\nthen a body’s motion is not due to it possessing a special property\nthat its neighborhood lacks. \n\nDespite the mechanistic, non-teleological character of Descartes’\nanalysis of motion and bodily interactions, there are many seemingly\nmetaphysical and qualitative traits in Cartesian physics that do not\nsit comfortably with his brand of reductionism (i.e., that material\nbodies are simply extension and its modes). In fact, returning to the\nCartesian laws of nature (section 4), it is evident that Descartes has\nallotted a fundamental role to the action of bodily\n“forces” or “tendencies”: for example, the\ntendency of bodies to follow straight lines, the resistance to motion\nof a large resting body (to a smaller moving body), etc. In The\nWorld, he states: “the virtue or power in a body to move\nitself can well pass wholly or partially to another body and thus no\nlonger be in the first; but it cannot no longer exist in the\nworld” (AT XI 15). As an early remark concerning his\nconservation principle, this explanation seems to envision force much\nlike a property or “power” possessed by individual\nmaterial objects, similar to the qualitative, metaphysical properties\nof the Scholastics (as in the “impetus” theory).  For\nthese reasons, the nature of bodily forces or tendencies is a\nphilosophical question of much interest in the study of Descartes’\nphysics. \n\nIn order to better grasp the specific role of Cartesian force, it\nwould be useful to closely examine his theory of centrifugal effects,\nwhich is closely associated with the second law of nature. Besides\nstraight-line motion, Descartes’ second law also mentions the\n“center-fleeing” (centrifugal) tendencies of circularly\nmoving material bodies: “all movement is, of itself, along\nstraight lines; and consequently, bodies which are moving in a circle\nalways tends to move away from the center of the circle which they are\ndescribing” (Pr II 39). At first glance, the second law might\nseem to correspond to the modern scientific dissection of centrifugal\nforce: specifically, the centrifugal effects experienced by a body\nmoving in a circular path, such as a stone in a sling, are a normal\nconsequence of the body’s tendency to depart the circle along a\nstraight tangential path. Yet, as stated in his second law, Descartes\ncontends (wrongly) that the body tends to follow a straight line away\nfrom the center of its circular trajectory. That is, the force exerted\nby the rotating stone, as manifest in the outward “pull”\non the impeding sling, is a result of a striving towards straight line\ninertial motion directed radially outward from the center of the\ncircle, rather than a striving towards straight line motion aimed\nalong the circle’s tangent. Descartes does acknowledge, however, the\nsignificance of tangential motion in explicating such\n“center-fleeing” tendencies, but he relegates this\nphenomenon to the subordinate status of a composite effect. By his\nreckoning, the tendency to follow a tangential path exhibited by a\ncircling body, such as the flight of the stone upon release from the\nsling, can be constructed from two more basic or primary inclinations:\nfirst, the tendency of the object to continue along its circular path;\nand second, the tendency of the object to travel along the radial line\naway from the center. Thus, Descartes is willing to admit that\n“there can be strivings toward diverse movements in the same\nbody at the same time” (Pr III 57), a judgment that seems to\npresuppose the acceptance of some type of “compositional”\ntheory of tendencies analogous to his dissection of\ndeterminations. Yet, since he believes that “the sling,\n…, does not impede the striving [of the body along the circular\npath]” (Pr III 57), he eventually places sole responsibility for\nthe production of the centrifugal force effects on the radially\ndirected component of “striving”. He states, “If\ninstead of considering all the forces of [a body’s] motion, we pay\nattention, to only one part of it, the effect of which is hindered by\nthe sling;…;we shall say that the stone, when at point\nA, strives only [to move] toward D, or that it only\nattempts to recede from the center E along the straight line\nEAD” (Pr III 57; see Figure 2). Figure 2.\n Diagram that accompanies Pr III 57. \n\nDescartes’ use of the terms “tendency” and\n“striving” in his rotating sling example should not be\nequated with his previous concept of a determination of motion. A\ndetermination is confined to a body’s actual motion, whereas a body’s\ntendency towards motion only occurs at a single instant. He states:\n“Of course, no movement is accomplished in an instant; yet it is\nobvious that every moving body, at any given moment in the course of\nits movement, is inclined to continue that movement in some direction\nin a straight line,…” (Pr II 39).  In another passage in\nthe Principles, Descartes identifies these strivings as a\n“first preparation for motion” (Pr III 63).  Hence, while\ndeterminations necessitate a span of several instants, tendencies\ntowards motion are manifest only at single instants. This is a crucial\ndistinction, for it partitions Cartesian dynamics into two ontological\ncamps: forces that exist at moments of time, and motions that can only\nsubsist over the course of several temporal moments. In many parts of\nthe Principles, moreover, Descartes suggests that quantity of\nmotion is the measure of these bodily tendencies, and thus quantity of\nmotion has a dual role as the measure of non-instantaneous bodily\nmotion as well as the instantaneous bodily tendencies (see Pr III\n121). \n\nGiven his rejection of the Scholastic qualitative tradition in\nphysics, Descartes’ depiction of centrifugal effects as due to a\n“tendency” or “striving” of moving bodies thus\nraises a host of intriguing ontological questions (and may even reveal\na vestigial influence of his earlier Scholastic training). That is,\neven as his penchant for a geometrical world view increased, as\nmanifest in the identification of extension as matter’s primary\nquality, Descartes continued to treat inertial motion and its\naccompanying force effects as if they were essential characteristics\nof bodies. Descartes’ own remarks on the ontological status of\ninertial force, furthermore, disclose a certain degree of ambiguity\nand indecision. In a 1638 letter, (six years before the\nPrinciples), he concludes: \n\nIn this passage, Descartes seems to deny the existence of inertial\nforce if conceived as a form of Scholastic quality that material\nbodies can possess; rather, bodies are “indifferent to\nmotion”, so even the slightest weight should move the entire\nearth. On the other hand, he is willing to acknowledge the commonly\nobserved fact that larger objects are much harder to set in motion\nthan smaller objects.  Consequently, although Descartes finds the\nexistence of “forces of resistance” (or “natural\nsluggishness”) problematic, as is the case with such similar\nproperties as weight, he does not entirely relegate inertia to the\nphenomenological status of the so-called secondary properties of\nmatter (such as color, taste, etc., which only exist in the mind). The\nmain reason for this inclusion of inertial force effects into\nscientific discourse can probably be traced to Descartes’\nclassification of motion as an intrinsic characteristic or\n“mode” of extension\n (see Section 3). \n As the concluding sections of the Principles state: “I\nhave now demonstrated [there] are nothing in the [material] objects\nother than…certain dispositions of size, figure and\nmotion…” (Pr IV 200). Since inertial forces are a\nconsequence or a by-product of motion, as the product of the size\ntimes speed of bodies, Descartes apparently did not object to\nincorporating these phenomena within the discussion of the modes of\nmaterial substance. \n\nYet, even if Descartes described force as an intrinsic fact of\nmaterial interactions, the exact nature of the relationship between\nforce and matter remains rather unclear. In particular, is force a\nproperty actually contained or present within bodies? Or, is it some\nsort of derivative phenomenal effect of the action of speed and size,\nand thus not present within extension? On the former interpretation\n(as favored by Alan Gabbey 1980, and Martial Gueroult 1980), forces\nexist in bodies in at least one important sense as “real”\nproperties or modes whose presence occasions the Cartesian laws of\nnature. While many of Descartes’ explanations might seem to favor this\ninterpretation (e.g., “[a body] at rest has force to remain at\nrest”, Pr II 43), Daniel Garber charges that such views run\ncounter to Descartes’ demand that extension alone comprise the essence\nof matter. Garber suggests that we view Cartesian force as a sort of\nshorthand description of the dynamical regularities maintained in the\nworld by God, and not as some form of quality internal to bodies:\n“The forces that enter into the discussion [of the Cartesian\ncollision laws] can be regarded simply as ways of talking about how\nGod acts, resulting in the law-like behavior of bodies; force for\nproceeding and force of resisting are ways of talking about how,\n…, God balances the persistence of the state of one body with\nthat of another” (Garber 1992a, 298; see also Hatfield 1979, Des\nChene 1996, and Manchak 2009, for more approaches). In various\npassages associated with the conservation principle, Garber’s\ninterpretation apparently gains credibility.  For instance: “So\nin now maintaining the world by the same action and with the same laws\nwith which He [God] created it, He conserves motion; not always\ncontained in the same parts of matter, but transferred from some parts\nto others depending on the ways in which they come in contact”\n(Pr II 42). In retrospect, however, it must be acknowledged that\nDescartes’ classification of material substance with extension, as\nexemplified in his demand that there exists nothing in bodies except\n“certain dispositions of size, figure and motion”, is so\nopen-ended and equivocal as to easily accommodate both of the\ninterpretations surveyed above. All that can be safely concluded is\nthat Descartes envisioned the forces linked with bodily inertial\nstates as basic, possibly primitive, facts of the existence of\nmaterial bodies—a broad judgment that, by refusing to take\nsides, opts out of this difficult ontological dispute. \n\nDescartes’ vortex theory of planetary motion proved initially to be\none of the most influential aspects of Cartesian physics, at least\nuntil roughly the mid-eighteenth century. A vortex, for Descartes, is\na large circling band of material particles. In essence, Descartes’\nvortex theory attempts to explain celestial phenomena, especially the\norbits of the planets or the motions of comets, by situating them\n(usually at rest) in these large circling bands. The entire Cartesian\nplenum, consequently, is comprised of a network or series of separate,\ninterlocking vortices. In our solar system, for example, the matter\nwithin the vortex has formed itself into a set of stratified bands,\neach lodging a planet, that circle the sun at varying speeds. The\nminute material particles that form the vortex bands consist of either\nthe atom-sized, globules (secondary matter) or the\n“indefinitely” small debris (primary matter) left over\nfrom the impact and fracture of the larger elements; tertiary matter,\nin contrast, comprises the large, macroscopic material element (Pr III\n48–54). This three-part division of matter, along with the three laws\nof nature, are responsible for all cosmological phenomena in\nDescartes’ system, including gravity. As described in Pr III 140, a\nplanet or comet comes to rest in a vortex band when its\nradially-directed, outward tendency to flee the center of rotation\n(i.e., centrifugal force;\n see Section 6) \n is balanced by an equal tendency in the minute elements that comprise\nthe vortex ring. If the planet has either a greater or lesser\ncentrifugal tendency than the small elements in a particular vortex,\nthen it will, respectively, either ascend to the next highest vortex\n(and possibly reach equilibrium with the particles in that band) or be\npushed down to the next lowest vortex—and this latter scenario\nultimately supplies Descartes’ explanation of the phenomenon of\ngravity, or “heaviness”. More specifically, Descartes\nholds that the minute particles that surround the earth account for\nterrestrial gravity in this same manner (Pr IV 21–27). As for the\ncreation of the vortex system, Descartes reasons that the conserved\nquantity of motion imparted to the plenum eventually resulted in the\npresent vortex configuration (Pr III 46). God first partitioned the\nplenum into equal-sized portions, and then placed these bodies into\nvarious circular motions that, ultimately, formed the three elements\nof matter and the vortex systems (see Figure 3). Figure 3.\nPlenum vortices in the Principles, Pr III 53. \n\nBesides the ontological economy of only requiring inertial motion and\nits attendant force effects, Descartes’ choice of circularly moving\nbands of particles may have also been motivated by worries over, for\nlack of a better term, “plenum crowding”. In the\nPrinciples, he argues: “It has been shown…that\nall places are full of bodies…. From this it follows that no\nbody can move except in a complete circle of matter or ring of bodies\nwhich all move at the same time” (Pr II 33). Circular motion is\ntherefore necessary for Descartes because there are no empty spaces\nfor a moving object to occupy. Although the world is described as\n“indefinitely” large (Pr I 26–27, with only God receiving\nthe more positive description, infinite), the non-circular motion of a\nsingle body could violate the Cartesian conservation principle by\nresulting in an indeterminate material displacement. As an aside, it\nis enormously difficult to reconcile Descartes’ collision rules with\nhis claim that all bodily motion occurs in circular paths; moreover,\nsince the bodies that comprise the circular path all move\nsimultaneously, it seems to follow from the definition of\n“body”\n (see Section 3) \n that there is only one moving body (and not many). \n\nReturning to the vortex theory, Descartes allots a considerable\nportion of the Principles to explicating various celestial\nphenomena, all the while adopting and adapting numerous sub-hypotheses\nthat apply his overall mechanical system to specific celestial events.\nOne of the more famous of these explanations is the Cartesian theory\nof vortex collapse, which also provides an hypothesis on the origins\nof comets (Pr III 115–120). Briefly, Descartes reckons that a\nsignificant amount of first element matter constantly flows between\nadjacent vortices: as the matter travels out of the equator of one\nvortex, it passes into the poles of its neighbor. Under normal\nconditions, primary matter flows from the poles of a vortex into its\ncenter, i.e., the sun, which is itself comprised of primary\nmatter. Due to centrifugal force, these particles press out against\nthe surrounding secondary globules as they begin their advance towards\nthe equator (Pr III 120–121); the pressure exerted by the primary and\nsecondary elements (on a person’s optic nerve) also serving as\nthe cause of light (Pr III 55–64, IV 195). Since the adjacent vortices\nalso possess the same tendency to swell in size, a balance of\nexpansion forces prevents the encroachment of neighboring vortices. On\noccasion, however, a buildup of larger elements on the sun’s\nsurface, identified as sunspots, may conspire to prevent the incoming\nflow of first element matter from the poles. If the sunspots\nultimately cover the entire surface of the sun, the vortex’s remaining\nprimary matter will be expelled at the equator, and thus it no longer\nhas a source of outward pressure to prevent the encroachment of\nneighboring vortices. Once the vortex is engulfed by its expanding\nneighbors, the encrusted sun may become either a planet in a new\nvortex, or end up as a comet passing through many vortices. \n\nOn the whole, the vortex theory offered the natural philosopher a\nhighly intuitive model of celestial phenomena that was compatible with\nthe mechanical philosophy. The theory was regarded as superior to\nNewton’s theory of universal gravitation since it did not posit\na mysterious, occult quality (gravity) as the cause of the planetary\norbits or the free-fall of terrestrial objects. The vortex theory\nlikewise provided a built-in explanation for the common direction of\nall planetary orbits. Additionally, the vortex theory allowed\nDescartes to endorse a form of Copernicanism (i.e., sun-centered\nworld) without running afoul of Church censorship. Since the alleged\nmotion of the earth was one of the Church’s principal objections to\nGalileo’s science, Descartes hoped to avoid this objection by\nplacing the earth at rest within a vortex band that circled the sun,\nsuch that the earth does not undergo a change of place relative to the\ncontaining surface of the neighboring material particles in its vortex\nband (Pr III 24–31; and section 3). Through this ingenious maneuver,\nDescartes could then claim that the earth does not move—via his\ndefinition of place and motion—and yet maintain the Copernican\nhypothesis that the earth orbits the sun. “The Earth, properly\nspeaking, is not moved, nor are any of the Planets; although they are\ncarried along by the heaven” (Pr III 28). In the long run,\nhowever, Descartes’ vortex theory failed for two fundamental reasons:\nfirst, neither Descartes nor his followers ever developed a systematic\nmathematical treatment of the vortex theory that could match the\naccuracy and predictive scope of the (continuously improving)\nNewtonian theory; and second, many attempts by Cartesian natural\nphilosophers to test Descartes’ various ideas on the dynamics of\ncircularly moving particles (e.g., by using large spinning barrels\nfilled with small particles) did not meet the predictions advanced in\nthe Principles (see Aiton 1972).","contact.mail":"eslowik@winona.edu","contact.domain":"winona.edu"}]
