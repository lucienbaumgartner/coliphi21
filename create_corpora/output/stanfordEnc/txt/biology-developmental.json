Developmental\nbiology displays a rich array of material and conceptual practices\nthat can be analyzed to better understand the scientific reasoning\nexhibited in experimental life science. This entry briefly reviews\nsome central phenomena of ontogeny and then explores four domains that\nrepresent some of the import and promise of conceptual reflection on\nthe epistemology of developmental biology.\n\nDevelopmental biology is the science that investigates how a variety\nof interacting processes generate an organism’s heterogeneous\nshapes, size, and structural features that arise on the trajectory\nfrom embryo to adult, or more generally throughout a life cycle (Love\n2008; Minelli 2011a). It represents an exemplary area of contemporary\nexperimental biology that focuses on phenomena that have puzzled\nnatural philosophers and scientists for more than two millennia. How\ndo the dynamic relations among seemingly homogeneous components in the\nearly stages of an embryo produce a unified whole organism containing\nheterogeneous parts in the appropriate arrangement and with correct\ninterconnections? More succinctly, how do we explain ontogeny\n(or, more archaically, generation)? In Generation of\nAnimals, Aristotle provided the first systematic investigation of\ndevelopmental phenomena and recognized key issues about the emergence\nof and relationships between hierarchically organized parts (e.g.,\nbone and anatomical features containing bone), as well as the\nexplanatory difficulty of determining how a morphological form is\nachieved reliably in offspring (e.g., the typical shape and structure\nof appendages in a particular species). Generation remained a poignant\nquestion throughout the early modern period and was explored by many\nkey figures writing at the time, including William Harvey, René\nDescartes, Robert Boyle, Pierre Gassendi, Nicolas Malebranche,\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Anne Conway, Immanuel Kant, and others\n(Smith 2006). Observations of life cycle transitions, such as\nmetamorphosis, fed into these endeavors and led to striking\nconclusions, such as Leibniz’s denial of generation sensu\nstricto. \nAnimals and all other organized substances have no\nbeginning … their apparent generation is only a development, a\nkind of augmentation … a transformation like any other, for\ninstance like that of a caterpillar into a butterfly. (Smith 2011:\n186–187) \nA major theme that crystallized in this history of investigation is\nthe distinction between epigenesis and preformation (see the entry on\n epigenesis and preformationism).\n Proponents of epigenesis claimed that heterogeneous, complex features\nof form emerge from homogeneous, less complex embryonic structures\nthrough interactive processes. Thus, an explanation of the ontogeny of\nthese form features requires accounting for how the interactions\noccur. Proponents of preformation claimed that complex form preexists\nin the embryo and “unfolds” via ordinary growth processes.\nAn adequate explanation involves detailing how growth occurs. Although\npreformation has a lighter explanatory burden in accounting for how\nform emerges during ontogeny (on the assumption that growth is easier\nto explain than process interactions), it also must address how the\nstarting point of the next generation is formed with the requisite\nheterogeneous complex features. This was sometimes accomplished by\nembedding smaller and smaller miniatures ad infinitum inside\nthe organism\n (Figure 1).\n Epigenetic perspectives were often dependent on forms of teleological\nreasoning (see the entry on\n teleological notions in biology)\n to account for why interactions among homogeneous components\neventually result in a complex, integrated whole organism. Though\nnothing prevents mixing features of these two outlooks in explaining\ndifferent aspects of development, polarization into dichotomous\npositions has occurred frequently (Rose 1981; Smith 2006). \nFigure 1: An early modern depiction of a\ntiny person inside of a sperm exemplifying preformationist views.  \nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the\ntopic of development was salient in controversies surrounding\nvitalism, such as the disagreement between Wilhelm Roux and Hans\nDriesch over how to explain ontogeny (Maienschein 1991). Roux thought\nthat a fertilized egg contains inherited elements that represent\ndifferent organismal characteristics. During the process of cellular\ndivision, these elements become unequally distributed among daughter\ncells leading to distinct cell fates. Driesch, in contrast, held that\neach cell retained its full potential through division even though\ndifferentiation occurred. Although this issue is often understood in\nterms of the metaphysics of life (vitalism versus\nmaterialism), Driesch’s interpretation of development and the\nautonomy of an organism had epistemological dimensions (Maienschein\n2000). The explanatory disagreement involved different experimental\napproaches and divergent views on the nature of differentiation in\nearly ontogeny (e.g., to what degree cells are pre-specified). A\nfamiliar philosophical theme running through these discussions, both\nepistemological and metaphysical, is the status of\n reductionism in biology.\n Through the middle of the 20th century,\nembryology—the scientific discipline studying\ndevelopment—slowly transformed into developmental biology with a\nvariety of reworked and recalcitrant elements (Berrill 1961). In\nconjunction with the issue of reductionism, a key aspect of this\nhistory is the molecularization of experimental (as opposed to\ncomparative) embryology (Fraser and Harland 2000), with a concomitant\nemphasis on the explanatory power of genes (see the entry on\n gene\n and\n Section 3.1).\n This complex and fascinating history, including interrelations with\nmedicine and reproductive technology, has been detailed elsewhere\n(see, e.g., Oppenheimer 1967; Horder et al. 1986; Hamburger 1988;\nHopwood 2019; Maienschein 2014; Maienschein et al. 2005; Gilbert 1991;\nEmbryo Project in Other Internet Resources). \nDevelopmental biology has increasingly become an area of exploration\nfor\n philosophy of biology\n due to the potential relevance of development for understanding\nevolution (Love 2015;\n Section 5),\n the theme of reductionism in biology and explanations from molecular\ngenetics (Robert 2004; Rosenberg 2006;\n Section 3),\n and via increased attention to the details of particular research\nprograms, such as stem cell biology (Fagan 2013; Laplane 2016).\nHowever, it should not be forgotten that ontogeny was on the radar of\nphilosophical scholars in the 20th century, as seen in\nErnest Nagel’s treatment of hierarchical organization and\nreduction in the development of living systems (Nagel 1961: 432ff).\nFor contemporary philosophy of science, developmental biology displays\na rich array of material and conceptual practices that can be analyzed\nto better understand the scientific reasoning exhibited in\nexperimental life science (see the entry on\n experiment in biology).\n After a brief review of some central phenomena of ontogeny, this\nentry explores four domains that represent some of the import and\npromise of conceptual reflection on the epistemology of developmental\nbiology. \nDevelopmental biology is the science that seeks to explain how the\nstructure of organisms changes with time. Structure, which may also be\ncalled morphology or anatomy, encompasses the arrangement of parts,\nthe number of parts, and the different types of parts. (Slack 2006:\n6) \nMost of the properties that developmental biologists attempt to\nexplain are structural rather than functional. For example, a\ndevelopmental biologist concentrates more on how tissue layers fold or\nhow shape is generated than on what the folded tissue layers do or how\nthe shape functions. The ontogeny of function, at all levels of\norganization, is an element of developmental biology, but it is often\nbracketed because of the predominance (both past and present) of\nquestions surrounding the ontogeny of form or structure (Love\n2008). \nTextbooks (e.g., Gilbert 2010; Slack 2013; Wolpert et al. 2010)\ntypically describe a canonical set of events surrounding the changing\nstructures displayed during animal\n development.[1]\n The first of these is fertilization (in sexually reproducing\nspecies), where an already semi-organized egg merges with a sperm\ncell, followed by the fusion of their nuclei to achieve the\nappropriate complement of genetic material. Second, the fertilized egg\nundergoes several rounds of cleavage, which are mitotic\ndivisions without cell growth that subdivide the zygote into many\ndistinct cells\n (Figure 2).\n After many rounds of cleavage, this spherical conglomerate of cells\n(now called a blastula) begins to exhibit some specification\nof germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm) and then\nproceeds to invaginate at one end, a complex process referred to as\ngastrulation that eventually yields a through-gut. All three\ngerm layers, from which specific types of cells are derived (e.g.,\nneural cells from ectoderm), become established during gastrulation or\nshortly after it\n completes.[2]Organogenesis refers to the production of tissues and organs\nthrough the interaction and rearrangement of cell groups. Events\nconfined to distinct taxonomic groups include neurulation in\nchordates, whereas other events correlate with mode of development\n(metamorphosis from a larval to adult stage) or individual\ntrauma (regeneration of a limb). \nFigure 2: An example of embryonic\ncleavage in marine snail embryos showing the fate of different cell\nlineages through developmental time. \nSeveral key processes underlie these distinct developmental events and\nthe resulting features of form that emerge (e.g., the through-gut\nformed subsequent to gastrulation or the heart formed during\norganogenesis). These are critical to the ontogeny of form and link\ndirectly to major research questions in developmental biology\n (Section 2).\n First, cellular properties, such as shape, change during ontogeny.\nThis is a function of differentiation whereby cells adopt\nspecific fates that include shape transformations\n (Figure 3).\n Second, regions of cells in the embryo are designated through\narrangement and composition alterations that correspond to different\naxes in different parts of the embryo (e.g., dorsal-ventral,\nanterior-posterior, left-right, and proximal-distal). The successive\nestablishment of these regions is referred to as pattern\nformation. Third, cells translocate and aggregate into layers\n(e.g., endoderm and ectoderm, followed by the mesoderm in many\nlineages) and later tissues (aggregations of differentiated cell\ntypes). Fourth, cells and tissues migrate and interact to produce new\narrangements and shapes composed of multiple tissue layers with novel\nfunctions (i.e., organs). These last two sets of processes are usually\ntermed morphogenesis (Davies 2005) and occur via many\ndistinct mechanisms\n (Section 1.3).\n Fifth, there is growth in the size of different form\nfeatures in the individual, remarkably obvious when comparing zygote\nto adult, although proportional change between different features\n(allometry) is also striking. \nFigure 3: A simple illustration of the\nkinds of differentiation related to the cellular components found in\nblood. \nNone of these processes occur in isolation and explanations of\nparticular form features usually draw on several of them\nsimultaneously, presuming other features that originated earlier in\nontogeny by different instantiations and combinations of the\nprocesses. This sets a broad agenda for investigation: how do various\niterations and combinations of these processes generate form features\nduring ontogeny? Consider the concrete example of vertebrate\ncardiogenesis. How does the vertebrate heart, with its internal and\nexternal shape and structure originate during ontogeny (Harvey 2002)?\nHow does the heart come to exhibit left/right asymmetry in the body\ncavity? What causes cells to adopt a muscle cell fate or certain\ntissues to interact in the prospective region of the heart? How do\nmuscle cells migrate to, aggregate in, and differentiate at the\ncorrect location? How does the interior of the heart adopt a\nparticular tubular structure with various chambers (that differs among\nvertebrate species)? How does the heart grow at a particular rate and\nachieve a specific size? Solutions relevant to explaining the ontogeny\nof form characterize causal factors that account for how different\nprocesses occur and yield various outcomes\n (Section 3). \nA developmental mechanism is a mechanism or process that\noperates during ontogeny (see McManus 2012 for discussion). At least\ntwo different types of developmental mechanisms can be distinguished\n(Love 2017a): molecular genetic mechanisms (signaling or gene\nregulatory networks;\n Section 3.1)\n and cellular-physical mechanisms (cell migration or epithelial\ninvagination;\n Section 3.2).\n Philosophical explorations of mechanisms in science and mechanistic\nexplanation have grown dramatically over the past two decades (Craver\nand Darden 2013; Glennan and Illari 2017; Illari and Williamson 2012).\nAmong different accounts of scientific mechanisms, four shared\nelements are discernable: (1) what a mechanism is for, (2) its\nconstituents, (3) its organization, and, (4) the spatiotemporal\ncontext of its operation. Developmental explanations seek to\ncharacterize these four elements through various experimental\ninterventions. Together these elements provide a template for\ncharacterizing the two different types of developmental\nmechanisms. \nA well-established molecular genetic mechanism is the initial\nformation of segments in Drosophila due to the segment polarity\nnetwork of gene expression (Wolpert et al. 2010, 70-81; Damen 2007).\nBy Stage 8 of development (~3 hours post-fertilization),\nDrosophila embryos have 14 parasegment units that were defined\nby pair-rule gene expression in earlier stages. The transcription\nfactor Engrailed accumulates in the anterior portion of each\nparasegment. This initiates a cascade of gene activity that defines\nthe boundaries of each compartment of cells that will eventually\nbecome a segment. One element of this activity is the expression of\nhedgehog, a secreted signaling protein, in cells anterior to\nthe band of cells where Engrailed has accumulated, which marks the\nposterior boundary of each nascent segment. This, in turn, activates\nthe expression of wingless, another secreted signaling protein,\nwhich maintains the expression of both engrailed and\nhedgehog in a feedback loop so that segment boundaries persist\n (Figure 4).\n The segment polarity network exhibits all four of the shared elements\nof a mechanism. It is constituted by a number of parts (e.g.,\nEngrailed, Wingless, Hedgehog) and activities or component operations\n(e.g., signaling proteins bind receptors, transcription factors bind\nto DNA and initiate gene expression), which are organized into\npatterns of interacting relationships (feedback loops, signaling\npathways) within a spatiotemporal context (in parasegments of the\nDrosophila embryo, ~3 hours post-fertilization) so as to\nproduce a specific behavior or phenomenon (a set of distinct segments\nwith well-defined boundaries). \nFigure 4: Wingless and Hedgehog\nreciprocal signaling during segmentation of Drosophila\nembryos. \nNext, consider the cellular-physical mechanism of branching\nmorphogenesis, which refers to combinations of cellular proliferation\nand movement that yield branch-like structures in kidneys, lungs,\nglands, or blood vessels. There are many types of branching\nmorphogenesis, but one primary mechanism is epithelial folding, which\ninvolves cells invaginating at different locations on a structure to\nyield branches (Davies 2013, ch. 20). Different cellular-physical\nmechanisms can produce invaginations that lead to branching structures\n(Varner and Nelson 2014): the constriction of one end of a subset of\ncolumnar cells in an epithelium (“apical constriction”);\nincreased cell proliferation of one epithelial sheet in relation to\nanother (“differential growth”); and compression of an\nepithelium leading to periodic invaginations (“mechanical\nbuckling”). That different mechanisms can lead to the same\nmorphological outcome means it can be difficult to discern which\nmechanism is operating in an embryonic context. Branching\nmorphogenesis also exhibits all four of the shared elements of a\nmechanism. The parts are cells and tissues with activities or\ncomponent operations (e.g., apical constriction, differential growth,\nmechanical buckling) being organized into patterns of interacting\nrelationships (apical constriction leading to epithelial invagination)\nwithin a spatiotemporal context (in tracheal precursors within the\nDrosophila embryo around Stage 7 and 8). This organization\nproduces a specific behavior or phenomenon (a set of branching\nstructures—the trachea). \nOnce these types of developmental mechanisms have been distinguished,\nseveral conceptual issues become salient. The first pertains to how\nthe two types of mechanisms are interrelated during ontogeny, and how\ndifferent investigative approaches do or do not successfully provide\nintegrated accounts of them\n (Section 3.3).\n A second is their distinct patterns of generality. Molecular genetic\nmechanisms are widely conserved across phylogenetically disparate taxa\nas a consequence of evolutionary descent, whereas cellular-physical\nmechanisms are widely instantiated as a consequence of shared physical\norganization but not due to evolutionary descent (Love 2017a). The\ndivergence of these patterns has prompted explicit epistemological\nreflection by developmental\n biologists.[3] \nOne recurring theme in the long history of investigations into\ndevelopment is that explaining the ontogeny of form consists of many\ninterrelated questions about diverse phenomena\n (Section 1.2).\n Sometimes philosophers have attempted to compress these questions\ninto one broad problem. \nThe real question concerning metazoan ontogeny is just how a single\ncell gives rise to the requisite number of differentiated cell\nlineages with all the right inductive developmental interactions\nrequired to reproduce the form of the mature organism (Moss 2002:\n97). \nThe central problem of developmental biology is to understand how a\nrelatively simple and homogeneous cellular mass can differentiate into\na relatively complex and heterogeneous organism closely resembling its\nprogenitor(s) in relevant aspects (Robert 2004: 1). \nThis language is not necessarily incorrect but can lead to skewed\ninterpretations. For example, Philip Kitcher has argued that:  \nIn contemporary developmental biology, there is … uncertainty\nabout how to focus the big, vague question, How do organisms develop?\n(Kitcher 1993: 115) \nThis is simply false. While it is true that these questions have been\nmanifested with differing frequency and vigor through history, and the\nability to answer them (as well as the nature of the questions\nthemselves) has been contingent on different research strategies and\nmethods, the issue has not been an unwieldy central problem. But\nscrutinizing the structure of developmental biology’s questions\nis not merely an exercise in clarification. It is crucial for\nunderstanding how the science of developmental biology is\norganized. \nAlthough it is common in philosophy to associate sciences with\ntheories, such that the individuation of a science is dependent on a\nconstitutive theory or group of models, it is uncommon to find\npresentations of developmental biology that make reference to a\ntheory of development (see discussion in Minelli and Pradeu\n2014). Instead, we find references to families of approaches\n(developmental genetics, experimental embryology, cell biology, and\n molecular biology)\n or catalogues of “key molecular components”\n(transcription factor families, inducing factor families, cytoskeleton\nor cell adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix components). No\nstandard theory or group of models provides theoretical scaffolding in\nthe major textbooks (e.g., Slack 2013; Wolpert et al. 2010; Gilbert\n2010). The absence of any reference to a constitutive theory of\ndevelopment or some set of core explanatory models is prima\nfacie puzzling. Three interpretations of this situation are\npossible: (a) despite the lack of reference to theories, one can\nreconstruct a theory (or theories) of developmental biology out of the\nrelevant discourse (e.g., multiple allied molecular models); (b) the\nlack of reference to theories indicates an immaturity in developmental\nbiology because mature sciences always have systematic theories; and,\n(c) the lack of reference to theories should be taken at face\nvalue. \nDevelopmental biology is not an immature science, groping about for\nsome way to explain its phenomena: “some of the basic processes\nand mechanisms of embryonic development are now quite well\nunderstood” (Slack 2013: 7). The impetus for this type of\ninterpretation arises out of commitments to a conception of mature\nscience that presumes theories are abstract systems with a small set\nof laws or core principles (see the entry on\n the structure of scientific theories).\n On the other hand, holding that developmental biology already has a\ntheory costumed in different guise—not referred to as such by\ndevelopmental biologists—is a possible interpretation. It arises\nout of a view that sciences must have theories, which has been\nexpanded to allow for different understandings of theory structure,\nsuch as constellations of models without laws, even though the\nassumption is that theory still plays a similar organizing role in\nguiding research. However, this assumption should be challenged and\nrejected on methodological grounds in the case of developmental\nbiology. An analysis of the reasoning in a science should exhibit\nepistemic transparency and not postulate “hidden”\nreasoning structure (Love 2012). This criterion is based on the\npremise that the basis of successes in scientific inquiry must be\navailable to those engaged in its practice (i.e., scientists). If we\npostulate hidden structure not present in scientific discourse to\naccount for inductive inference, explanation, or other forms of\nreasoning, then we risk obscuring how scientists themselves access\nthis structure to evaluate it (Woodward 2003: ch. 4). The successes of\ndevelopmental biology would become mysterious when viewed from the\nvantage point of its participants. \nEpistemic transparency demands a descriptive correspondence between\nphilosophical accounts of science and scientific practice. This does\nnot mean that every claim made by any scientist should be taken with\nthe same credence. A ruling concern is pervasive features of practice.\nThe problem with assuming laws are required for explanation is their\nrelative absence from a variety of successful sciences routinely\noffering explanations, not that no scientist ever appeals to laws as\nexplanatory. Pervasive features of scientific practice should be\nprominent in philosophical accounts of sciences. Thus, it is not\nsurprising that the desire for a theory can be found among some\ndevelopmental biologists: “Developing a theory is of utmost\nimportance for any discipline” (Sommer 2009: 417). But the fact\nthat these calls are rare means we should not assume theories are\nactually needed to govern and organize inquiry within the\n domain.[4] \nIt was once thought that each science must have laws in order to offer\nexplanations (see the entry on\n scientific explanations),\n but now this is seen as unnecessary (Giere 1999; Woodward 2003). The\nexpectation that a science have a theory to accomplish the task of\norganizing and guiding inquiry is of similar vintage. It derives from\nan intuitive expectation of what counts as a mature science in the\nfirst place. Even if we find empirically successful and coherent\ntraditions of research without a systematic theoretical framework\nproviding guidance, then the science cannot be mature. One might shrug\noff these quasi-positivist appeals to maturity by invoking more\nflexible conceptions of theory and theory structure. But why retain\nthe expectation that theories should accomplish the same epistemic\ntasks? It is a preconception about knowledge structure that is not\nplausible in light of the diversity of research practices found across\nthe sciences. The few scientists who favor this philosophical response\nhave different motivations. Instead of maturity, other reasons are\nsalient, such as guidance in the face of a welter of biochemical\ndetail or the need to forge a synthesis between evolution and\n development.[5] \nDevelopmental biologists recognize that the “curse of\ndetail” is one of the costs of developmental biology’s\nmeteoric success over the past three decades: “The principal\nchallenge today is that of exponentially increasing detail”\n(Slack 2013: ix). While something must provide organization and\nguidance to developmental biology, it need not be theories that\naccomplish the task. Regarding calls for a synthesis of evolution and\ndevelopment, these often assume that having a developmental theory is\na precondition for synthesis (Sommer 2009): “Our troubles\n… derive from our standing lack of an explicit theory of\ndevelopment” (Minelli 2011a: 4). However, this line of argument\nrelies on the degree to which evolutionary theory exhibits the\nsupposed structure to which developmental biologists should aspire.\nThe actual practice associated with evolutionary theory indicates a\nmore flexible framework with chameleon qualities that is responsively\nadjusted to the diverse investigative aims of evolutionary researchers\n(Love 2013). Therefore, it is not clear that evolutionary theory\nsupplies the preferred template. A productive way forward is to\nrelinquish the prior expectation that sciences must have theories of a\ncertain kind to govern and guide their activity. Instead, sciences\nthat display empirical success and fecundity should be studied to\ndiscover what features are responsible, without assuming that those\nfeatures will be the same for all sciences: “Science need not be\nunderstood in these terms and, indeed, may be better understood in\nother terms” (Giere 1999: 4). \nThe criterion of epistemic transparency\n (Section 2.1)\n encourages an exploration of our third interpretive option—the\nlack of reference to theories should be taken at face value.\nDevelopmental biology is organized primarily by stable, broad domains\nof problems that correspond to abstract representations of major\nontogenetic processes (differentiation, pattern formation, growth, and\nmorphogenesis;\n Section 1.2).\n Yet how do we interpret the “theoretical” aspects of\ndevelopmental biology (e.g., positional information models of pattern\nformation) and the utilization of theories from other domains (e.g.,\nbiochemistry)? One way is to distinguish between theory-informed\nscience—using theoretical knowledge—and theory-directed\nscience—having a theory that directs inquiry and organizes\nknowledge (Waters 2007b); developmental biology is theory-informed but\nnot theory-directed. Theories need not be wholly absent from\ndevelopmental biology but—when present—they play roles\nvery different from standard philosophical expectations. Developmental\nbiology uses theoretical knowledge from biochemistry when appealing to\nmorphogen gradients to explain how segments are established or\nchemical thermodynamics when invoking reaction–diffusion\nmechanisms to explain pigmentation patterns. It also uses theoretical\nknowledge derived from within developmental biology, such as\npositional information models. Different kinds of theory inform\ndevelopmental biology, but these do not organize research—they\nare not necessary to structure the knowledge and direct investigative\nactivities. Developmental biologists are not focused on confirming and\nextending the theory of reaction–diffusion mechanisms, nor are\nthey typically organizing their research around positional\n information.[6]\n This theoretical knowledge is used in building explanations but does\nnot provide rails of guidance for how to proceed in a research\nprogram. All sciences may use theoretical knowledge, but this is not\nthe same as all sciences having a theory providing direction and\norganization. \nWhy think that problems provide organizational architecture for the\nepistemology of developmental biology? They are a pervasive feature of\nits reasoning practices, illustrated in textbooks that capture\nsubstantial community consensus about standards of explanation,\nexperimental methods, essential concepts, and empirical content.\nUnlike evolutionary biology textbooks that discuss the theory of\nnatural selection or economics textbooks that talk about microeconomic\ntheory, an examination of several editions of major textbooks indicate\nthat developmental biology does not have similar kinds of\ntheories. \nJonathan Slack’s Essential Developmental Biology (Slack\n2006, 2013) is organized around four main types of processes, also\ndescribed as clustered groups of problems, which occur during\nembryonic development: regional specification (pattern formation),\ncell differentiation, morphogenesis, and growth. These broad clusters\nare then fleshed out along a standard timeline of early development,\nhighlighting gametogenesis, fertilization, cleavage, gastrulation, and\naxis specification\n (see Section 1.2).\n Different experimental approaches (cell and molecular biology,\ndevelopmental genetics, and experimental embryology) are utilized in a\nspecific set of model organisms\n (see below, Section 4)\n to dissect the workings of these developmental phenomena. Subsequent\nchapters cover later aspects of development (e.g., organogenesis),\nwith different systems treated in depth by tissue layer,\ndifferentiation and growth, or in relation to evolutionary questions\n(see below,\n Section 5).\n Throughout this presentation, no specific theory, set of hypotheses,\nor dominant model is invoked to organize these different domains of\ninvestigation. Instead, broad clusters of questions that reflect\ngenerally delineated processes (differentiation, specification,\nmorphogenesis, and growth) set the agenda of research. \nScott Gilbert’s Developmental Biology exhibits a\nsimilar pattern (Gilbert 2000 [2003, 2006, 2010]). Developmental\nbiology is constituted by two broad questions (“How does the\nfertilized egg give rise to the adult body? And how does that adult\nbody produce yet another body?”), which can then be subdivided\ninto further categories, such as differentiation, morphogenesis,\ngrowth, reproduction, regeneration, evolution, and environmental\nregulation. These questions can be parsed more analytically in terms\nof five variables: abstraction, variety, connectivity, temporality,\nand spatial composition. The values given to these variables structure\nthe constellation of research questions within the broad problem\nagendas corresponding to generally delineated processes. For example,\nresearch questions oriented around events in zebrafish gastrulation\nare structured in a way that differs from the research questions\noriented around vertebrate neural crest cell migration because they\ninvolve different values for the five variables: abstraction\n(zebrafish vs. vertebrates), temporality (earlier vs. later), spatial\ncomposition (tissue layer interactions vs. a distinctive population of\ncells), variety (epiboly vs. epithelium to mesenchyme transition), and\nconnectivity (gut formation and endoderm vs. organogenesis and\nectoderm/mesoderm). These configurations can be adjusted readily in\nresponse to shifts in the values for different variables (Love\n 2014).[7] \nThis anatomy of problems, with explicit epistemological structure\nderived from different values for these variables, operates to\norganize the science of development. Investigators from different\ndisciplines can be working on the same problem but asking different\nquestions that require distinct but complementary methodological\nresources. Knowledge and inquiry in developmental biology are\nintricately organized, just not by a central theory or group of\nmodels, and this erotetic organization is epistemologically accessible\nto the participating scientists. While theoretical knowledge,\nespecially that drawn from molecular biological mechanisms (see the\nentry on\n molecular biology)\n and mathematical models (e.g., reaction–diffusion models) is\nubiquitous (theory-informed), the clusters of problems that\nreappear across the textbooks and correspond to different types of\nprocesses provide the governing architecture (not\ntheory-directed), which can be characterized explicitly according\nto the variables described. Further analysis of this problem anatomy\nis possible, including how it is displayed in regular research\narticles and not just textbooks, as well as other areas of biology\n(see, e.g., Brigandt and Love 2012). \nExplanations in developmental biology are usually causal, though\nunlike standard mechanistic explanation there is a constant\nacquisition of new causal capacities (in terms of constituent\nentities, activities, and their organization) through development\n(McManus 2012; Parkkinen 2014). Although much work remains in\ncharacterizing different aspects of explanation in developmental\nbiology, there is no doubt that a difference making or manipulability\nconception of causation (see the entry on\n causation and manipulability)\n provides a core element of the reasoning (Woodward 2003; Strevens\n2009; Waters 2007a). Genetic explanations of development\n (Section 3.1),\n similar to what is seen in\n molecular genetics,\n work by identifying changes in the expression of genes and\ninteractions among their RNA and protein products that lead to changes\nin the properties of morphological features during ontogeny (e.g.,\nshape or size), while holding a variety of contextual variables fixed.\nMore recently, there has been growing interest in physical\nexplanations of development\n (Section 3.2)\n that involve appeals to mechanical forces due to geometrical\narrangements of mesoscale materials, such as fluid flow (Forgacs and\nNewman 2005). Researchers agree on the phenomena that need to be\nexplained\n (Section 1.2\n and\n Section 2.2),\n but differ on whether physical rules or genetic factors are more or\nless explanatory (Keller\n 2002).[8]\n The existence of two different types of causal explanations for\ndevelopmental phenomena poses an additional question about how they\nmight be combined into a more integrated explanatory framework\n (Section 3.3). \nMany philosophers have turned to explanations of development over the\npast two decades in an effort to esteem or deflate claims about the\ncausal power of genes (Keller 2002; Neumann-Held and Rehmann-Sutter\n2006; Rosenberg 2006; Robert 2004; Waters\n 2007a).[9]\n Genetic explanations touch the philosophical theme of reductionism\nand appear to constitute the bulk of empirical success accruing to\ndevelopmental biology over the past several\n decades.[10]\n Statements from developmental biologists reinforce this\nperspective: \nDevelopmental biology … deals with the process by which the\ngenes in the fertilized egg control cell behavior in the embryo and so\ndetermine its pattern, its form, and much of its behavior …\ndifferential gene activity controls development. (Wolpert et al. 1998:\nv, 15) \nThese types of statements are sometimes amplified in appeals to a\ngenetic program for development. \n[Elements of the genome] contain the sequence-specific code for\ndevelopment; and they determine the particular outcome of\ndevelopmental processes, and thus the form of the animal produced by\nevery embryo. … Development is the execution of the genetic\nprogram for construction of a given species of organism (Davidson\n2006: 2,\n 16).[11] \nAt other times, statements concentrate on genetics as the primary\nlocus of causation in ontogeny: “Developmental complexity is the\ndirect output of the spatially specific expression of particular gene\nsets and it is at this level that we can address causality in\ndevelopment” (Davidson and Peter 2015: 2). Whether or not these\nstatements can be substantiated has been the subject of intense\n debate.[12]\n The strongest claims about genetic programs or the genetic control of\ndevelopment have empirical and conceptual drawbacks that include an\ninattention to plasticity and the role of the environment, an\nambiguity about the locus of causal agency, and a reliance on\nmetaphors drawn from computer science (Gilbert and Epel 2009; Keller\n2002; Moss 2002; Robert 2004). However, this leaves intact the\ndifference-making principle of genetic explanation exhibited in\nmolecular genetics (Waters 2007a), which yields more narrow and\nprecise causal claims under controlled experimental conditions, and is\napplicable to diverse molecular entities that play causal roles during\ndevelopment, such as regulatory RNAs, proteins, and environmental\nsignals. We can observe this briefly by reconsidering the example of\nvertebrate cardiogenesis\n (Section 1.2). \nAre there problems with claiming that genes contain all of the\ninformation (see the entry on\n biological information)\n to form vertebrate hearts? Is there a genetic program in the DNA\ncontrolling heart development? Are genes the primary supplier and\norganizer of material resources for heart development, largely\ndetermining the phenotypic outcome? Existing studies of heart\ndevelopment have identified a role for fluid forces in specifying the\ninternal form of the heart (Hove et al. 2003) and its left/right\nasymmetry (Nonaka et al. 2002). Biochemical gradients of extracellular\ncalcium are responsible for activating the asymmetric expression of\nthe regulatory gene Nodal (Raya et al. 2004) and inhibition\nof voltage gradients scrambles normal asymmetry establishment (Levin\net al. 2002). Mechanical cues such as microenvironmental stiffness are\ncrucial for key transitions from migratory cells into organized sheets\nduring heart formation (Jackson et al. 2017). A number of genes are\nclearly difference makers in these processes (Asp et al. 2019;\nSrivastava 2006; Brand 2003; Olson 2006), but the conclusion that\ngenes carry all the information needed to generate form features of\nthe heart seems unwarranted. While it may be warranted empirically in\nsome cases to privilege DNA sequence differences as causal factors in\nspecific processes of ontogeny (Waters 2007a), such as hierarchically\norganized networks of genetic difference makers explaining tissue\nspecification (Peter and Davidson 2011), the diversity of entities\nappealed to in molecular genetics and the extent of their individual\nand joint roles in specifying developmental outcomes implies that\ndebates about the meaning, scope, and power of genetic explanations\nwill continue (Griffiths and Stotz 2013). However, a shift away from\ngenetic programs and genetic determinism to DNA, RNA, and proteins as\ndifference makers that operate conjointly suggests that we\nconceptualize other causal factors in a similar way. \nFluid flow, as a physical force, is also a difference maker during the\ndevelopment of the heart, and ontogeny more generally, and\ndevelopmental biologists appeal to physical difference makers, which\nare understood as factors in producing the morphological properties of\ndevelopmental phenomena (Forgacs and Newman 2005). A physical\ncausation approach was on display in the late 19th century work of\nWilhelm His (Hopwood 1999, 2000; Pearson 2018) and especially visible\nin the early 20th century work of D’Arcy Thompson and others\n(Thompson 1992 [1942]; Keller 2002: ch. 2; Olby 1986). This occurred\nin the milieu of increasing attention to the chromosomal theory of\ninheritance and attempts to explore developmental phenomena via\nclassical genetic methods (Morgan 1923, 1926, 1934). Thompson appealed\nto differential rates of growth and the constraints of geometrical\nrelationships to explain how organismal morphology originates. Visual\nrepresentations of abiotic, mechanical analogues provided the\nplausibility, such as the shape of liquid splashes or hanging drops\nfor the cup and bell configurations of the free-swimming sexual stage\nof jellyfish. If physical forces generated specific morphologies in\nviscoelastic materials, then analogous morphologies in living species\nshould be explained in terms of physical forces operating on the\nviscoelastic materials of the developing embryo. Yet morphogenetic\nprocesses that produce the shape and structure of morphology have been\nseen primarily, if not exclusively, in terms of genetics for the last\nhalf-century. Physical approaches moved into the background as\nmolecular genetics approaches went from strength to strength (Fraser\nand Harland 2000). \nThe molecularization of experimental embryology is one of the most\nstriking success stories of contemporary biology as genes and genetic\ninteractions (e.g., in transcriptional networks and signaling\npathways; see\n Section 1.3)\n were discovered to underlie specific details of differentiation,\nmorphogenesis, pattern formation, and growth when structure originates\nduring development. Genetic approaches predominate in contemporary\ndevelopmental biology and physical modes of causation are often\nneglected. The frustration among researchers interested in physical\ncausation during embryogenesis has been palpable. \nTo the molecular types, a cause is a molecule or a gene. To explain a\nphenomenon is to identify genes and characterize proteins without\nwhich the phenomenon will fail or be abnormal. A molecule is an\nexplanation: a force is a description; to argue otherwise brings pity,\nat best (Albert Harris to John Trinkaus, 12 March 1996; Source: Marine\nBiological Laboratory Library Archives). \nDespite this predominance of genetic explanatory approaches and the\nfrustration among researchers utilizing other approaches, a\ngroundswell of interest has been building around physical explanations\nof development, especially in terms of their integration with genetic\nexplanations (Miller and Davidson 2013; Newman 2015). Some\nphilosophers have argued that the biomechanical modeling of physical\ncausal factors constitutes a rejection of certain forms of reductive\nexplanation in biology (Green and Batterman 2017). \nThompson held that physical forces were explanatory but inadequate in\nisolation to account for the developmental origin of morphology;\nheredity (genetics) was also a necessary causal\n factor.[13]\n Yet Thompson was quick to highlight that mechanical modes of\ncausation might be neglected in the midst of growing attention to\nheredity (genetics): \nit is no less of an exaggeration if we tend to neglect these direct\nphysical and mechanical modes of causation altogether, and to see in\nthe characters of a bone merely the results of variation and of\nheredity. (Thompson 1992 [1942]: 1023) \nDespite this latter form of exaggeration manifesting itself through\nmuch of the 20th century, an agenda to combine or integrate\nthe two approaches is now\n explicit.[14] \nThere is no controversy about whether genetic and physical modes of\ncausation are at work simultaneously: \nboth the physics and biochemical signaling pathways of the embryo\ncontribute to the form of the organism. (Von Dassow et al. 2010:\n1) \nThey are not competing causal explanations of the same phenomenon.\nExplanations should capture how their productive interactions yield\ndevelopmental outcomes: \nan increasing number of examples point to the existence of a\nreciprocal interplay between expression of some developmental genes\nand the mechanical forces that are associated with morphogenetic\nmovements. (Brouzés and Farge 2004: 372) \nGenetic causes can lead to physical causation and vice versa.\nPhysical causation brings about genetic causation through\nmechanotransduction. Stretching, contraction, compression, fluid shear\nstress, and other physical dynamics are sensed by different molecular\ncomponents inside and outside of cells that translate these\nenvironmental changes into biochemical signals (Hoffman et al. 2011;\nWozniak and Chen 2009). Genetic causation brings about physical\ncausation by creating different physical properties of cells and\ntissues through the presence, absence, or change in frequency of\nparticular proteins. For example, different patterns of expression for\ncell adhesion molecules (e.g., cadherins) can lead to differential\nadhesion across epithelial sheets of tissue and thereby generate phase\nseparations or compartments via surface tension variation (Newman and\nBhat 2008). If these modes of causation are not competing, then how\nmight one combine genetic and physical difference makers into an\nintegrated causal explanation? How much explanatory unity can be\nachieved for this “reciprocal interplay”? \nFinding philosophical models for the explanatory integration of\ngenetics and physics remains an open question (Love 2017b).\nApportioning causal responsibility in the sense of determining\nrelative contributions (e.g., the composition of causal magnitudes\namong different physical forces in Newtonian mechanics) is problematic\nbecause this requires commensurability with respect to how causes\nproduce their effects (Sober 1988). In the context of causation\nunderstood in terms of difference makers, the difficulty of\nintegration is a variation on a problem in causal reasoning identified\nby John Stuart Mill and labeled the “intermixture of\neffects,” which involves multiple causes contributing in a\nblended fashion to yield an outcome. \nThis difficulty is most of all conspicuous in the case of\nphysiological phenomena; it being seldom possible to separate the\ndifferent agencies which collectively compose an organized body,\nwithout destroying the very phenomena which it is our object to\ninvestigate. (Mill 1843 [1974]: 456 [book 3, chapter 11, section 1,\nparagraph 7]) \nCareful statistical methodology in experiments can answer whether one\ntype of difference maker accounts for more of the variation in the\neffect variable for a particular population. But a ranking of causal\nfactors with respect to how much of a difference they made is not the\nsame as combining two modes of causation into an integrated account.\nAnother response is to dissolve the integration problem by reducing\nall of the causal interactions to one of the two distinct modes,\nthereby achieving a kind of explanatory unity (Rosenberg 2006).\nHowever, this approach is eschewed by working biologists who take both\ngenetic and physical modes of causation as significant and not\nreducible one to the other. \nA different strategy is integrative pluralism (Mitchell 2002). This\ninvolves a two-step procedure for explaining complex phenomena whose\nfeatures are the result of multiple causes: (a) formulate idealized\nmodels where particular causal factors operate in isolation\n(“theoretical modeling”); and, (b) integrate idealized\nmodels to explain how particular, concrete phenomena originate from\nthese causes in combination. This model is suggestive but also has key\ndrawbacks that include the fact that genetic causal reasoning in\ndevelopmental biology does not typically involve theoretical modeling\nand the precise nature of the integration is underspecified.\nIntegration of genetic and physical difference makers in a single\nmechanism offers a further possibility (Darden 2006; Craver 2007).\nAlthough this valuably highlights the productive continuity between\ndifference makers through stages in a sequence (i.e., their reciprocal\ninterplay), it also has handicaps. These include: \nDivergent approaches to measuring time. Instead of time “in the\nmechanism,” time is measured with external standardized stages\n(see below,\n Section 5.2).\n Stages facilitate the study of different kinds of developmental\nmechanisms, with different characteristic rates and durations for\ntheir stages, within a common framework for a model organism (e.g.,\nDrosophila), while also permitting conserved molecular\nmechanisms to be studied in different species because the\ncorresponding mechanism description is not anchored to the temporal\nsequence of the model organism. \nAn expectation that mechanism descriptions “bottom-out” in\nlowest level activities of molecular entities (Darden 2006). In the\ncase of combining genetic and physical difference makers, the\nreciprocal interplay means that there is a studious avoidance of\nbottoming out in one or the other mode of causation. \nThe requirement of stable, compositional organization for mechanisms:\n \nMechanistic explanations are constitutive or componential\nexplanations: they explain the behavior of the mechanism as a whole in\nterms of the organized activities and interaction of its components.\n(Craver 2007: 128)  \nBut these mechanism descriptions are often embedded in different\ndevelopmental contexts (at different times in ontogeny) with distinct\ncompositional relations (within and between species). The reciprocal\ninterplay between genetic and physical difference makers is not\nmaintained precisely because these compositional differences alter\nrelationships of physical causation (fluid flow, tension, etc.; see\n Section 1.3).\n Developmental biologists have been able to generalize relationships\nof genetic causation (in terms of genetic mechanisms; see\n Section 1.3)\n across species quite widely, but the attempt to combine these with\nphysical causation has necessitated narrowing the scope of the causal\nclaims. \nAdequate philosophical models of the systematic dependence between\ngenetic and physical difference makers in ontogeny need to account for\nhow the temporal relations necessary for making causal claims are\nanchored in an external periodization used by developmental\nbiologists. The imposition of different temporal scales can lead to\ndistinct factors being significant or salient, which matters for\nascertaining how different kinds of causes can be combined into\nintegrated explanations. One possibility is to juxtapose these\ndifference makers at distinct stages via experimental verification\nsuch that they exhibit productive continuity within the constraints of\nthe external periodization (Love 2017b). This facilitates representing\nsymmetry between causal factors because genetic difference makers can\nbe placed before or after physical difference makers (and vice\nversa). Although this does not provide a way to combine causal\nmagnitudes (as in vector addition from Newtonian mechanics), it offers\nan explicit strategy for assigning responsibility among different\nkinds of causes through the vehicle of temporal organization that goes\nbeyond ranking difference makers. The periodization serves as a\ntemplate from the practices of developmental biologists for providing\nwholeness or unity to the different modes of causation to yield a kind\nof integrated explanation of the morphology that results from a\nsequence of developmental processes. \nNot all types of causal explanation involve an external periodization\nand there are other ways to combine causes in order to produce more\nintegrated explanatory frameworks. One area where combined\nexplanations for developmental phenomena are being analyzed pertains\nto mechanism descriptions and mathematical modeling in systems biology\n(Brigandt 2013; Fagan 2013). For example, Fagan (2013: ch. 9) shows\nhow an integrated explanation emerges from a step-wise procedure that\nstarts with a detailed description of a molecular mechanism followed\nby the formulation of an abstracted wiring diagram of component\ninteractions, which is then translated into a system of equations that\ncan account for changes in component interactions over time. Solutions\nto these systems of equations and a mapping of solutions for the\ninteractions among components of the system onto the behavior of the\noverall system within a shared landscape representation more\nsystematically explains cellular differentiation. \nModel organisms are central to contemporary biology and studies of\nembryogenesis (Ankeny and Leonelli 2011; Steel 2008; Bier and McGinnis\n2003; Davis 2004). Biologists utilize only a small number of species\nto experimentally elucidate various properties of ontogeny (e.g.,\nC. elegans, Drosophila, and Brachydanio\n[zebrafish]; see\n Figure 5).\n These experimental models permit researchers to investigate\ndevelopment in great depth and facilitate a precise dissection of\ncausal relationships. Critics have questioned whether these models are\ngood representatives of other species because of inherent biases\ninvolved in their selection, such as rapid development and short\ngeneration time (Bolker 1995), and problematic presumptions about the\nconservation of gene functions and regulatory networks (Lynch 2009).\nFor example, C. elegans embryogenesis is not representative\nof nematodes in terms of pattern formation and cell specification\n(Schulze and Schierenberg 2011) and zebrafish appendage formation is a\npoor proxy for the development of appendages in tetrapods (Metscher\nand Ahlberg 1999). \nFigure 5: Drosophila\nmelanogaster (the common fruit fly) is one of the standard model\norganisms used in developmental biology. \nOne response to this criticism is to emphasize the conserved genetic\nmechanisms shared by all animals despite differences in developmental\nphenomena (Gerhart and Kirschner 2007; Ankeny and Leonelli 2011; Weber\n2005). Fruit flies may be unrepresentative in exhibiting syncytial\ndevelopment, but they use the collinear expression of Hox\ngenes to specify their anterior-posterior body axis. This response\nindicates that whether an entire model organism is representative\nper se is too coarse-grained a criterion to capture the\nrationale behind their use. We have to ask about representation\nwith respect to what, and some accounts have moved in this\ndirection. Jessica Bolker has distinguished exemplary and surrogate\nmodes of representation (Bolker 2009), where the former serve basic\nresearch by exemplifying a larger group and the latter correspond to\nmodels designed to provide indirect experimental access to otherwise\ninaccessible phenomena, such as mouse models of human psychological\ndisorders (e.g., depression). Surrogate models are adopted in\nbiomedical contexts where the phenomena of interest are manifested in\nhumans. Most developmental biologists consider model organisms as\nexemplars, not\n surrogates.[15]\n Thus, in order to respond to a criticism of non-representativeness,\nthe criterion of representation must be explored in more\n detail.[16] \nA basic presumption about model organisms is that they bear\nappropriate similarity relationships to larger groups of animals. This\npresumption is an instantiation of what is discussed generally for\n models in science\n meant to represent phenomena. Model organisms represent developmental\nphenomena in species that are either studied little or never studied\nat all: “we study flies and frogs as examples for the\ndevelopment of animals in general” (Nüsslein-Volhard 2006:\n87). One source of confidence in treating them as exemplars derives\nfrom an inductive inference over discovered patterns of evolutionary\nconservation with respect to developmental phenomena (e.g.,\ngastrulation or somite formation). If all or most model organisms\nshare a developmental feature, then all or most animals will share the\nfeature. This inference can be circumscribed more or less narrowly\n(e.g., if all or most vertebrate model organisms share somite\nformation, then all or most vertebrates will share it). \nAs a consequence of this confidence, the model organism\n(“source”) can represent these other unstudied species\n(“targets”). This basic distinction between the model or\nsource and the phenomena or target it is supposed to represent is\nubiquitous in reasoning with model organisms (Ankeny and Leonelli\n2011). Zebrafish is a model or representation of vertebrate\ndevelopment, the target phenomena, because we expect to learn about\nvertebrate development generally by studying ontogeny in zebrafish\nspecifically. We do not invest time and resources into zebrafish as a\nmodel organism only because we are interested in zebrafish.\nResearchers plan to make claims about somite formation from\nobservations in zebrafish that will apply to somite formation in other\nvertebrates that we will never have the time or money to\ninvestigate. \nDevelopmental biologists often speak of investigating mechanisms that\naccount for phenomena in ontogeny (see\n Section 1.3),\n and focus on conserved genetic and cellular mechanisms in model\norganisms (Gerhart and Kirschner 2007; Ankeny and Leonelli 2011; Weber\n2005). This suggests a distinction between representation with respect\nto developmental phenomena and representation with respect to genetic\nand cellular mechanisms operating in development. If we are interested\nin explaining how hearts (phenomena) develop, then we might\ninvestigate the molecular or cellular mechanisms occurring in\nthe heart field during zebrafish ontogeny. Some of these mechanisms\ncould be conserved even though the phenomena are not.\nDrosophila has only one cardiac cell type, no neural crest\ncells, and a heart with no atrial or ventricular chamber morphology\n(Kirby 1999). However, cardiogenesis in all invertebrates and\nvertebrates investigated thus far depends essentially on the\nexpression of the homeobox gene Nkx2-5/tinman\n(Gajewski and Schulz 2002). The reverse situation also can hold:\nsimilar phenomena may be manifested but genetic and cellular\nmechanisms might differ. Amphibians form a neural tube (neurulation)\nthrough a process of invagination (the folding of an epithelial\nsheet), whereas teleost fishes form a neural tube via cavitation (the\nhollowing out of a block of tissue via cell death). The neural tube is\nhomologous across vertebrates (i.e., a conserved phenomenon), but the\ncellular and genetic mechanisms involved in invagination versus\ncavitation are distinct (Davies 2013: ch. 4). \nThe distinction between phenomena and mechanisms assumes specificity;\ni.e., there are specific phenomena (somite formation in vertebrates)\nor mechanisms (collinear Hox gene expression) in view when\njudging the relationship between source (model) and target. But animal\ndevelopment consists of a multitude of different processes that\ninvolve a host of different mechanisms. Therefore, another distinction\noperating in the representational criterion pertains to questions of\nspecificity versus variety when selecting and using\nmodel organisms. A model might represent one type of target phenomena\n(differentiation or growth) or mechanism (cell signaling or cell\ncycling) but not others—specificity—or may do so better or\nworse with respect to particular types of phenomena or mechanisms. A\nmodel might represent several types of target phenomena and mechanisms\nsimultaneously—variety—with variability in how each type\nis represented. Trade-offs exist with respect to how well different\nphenomena or mechanisms are co-instantiated in a model organism. Note\nthat experimental organisms may be selected with respect to variety\nand specificity simultaneously, such as when a biologist working on a\nspecific phenomenon intends to work on others using the same model in\nthe future. They also may be selected with one or the other of these\ntwo aspects predominant. A model might be desirable if it has\nrepresentational variety in both mechanisms and phenomena even if it\nis not the best representative for every specific mechanism or\nphenomenon. Conversely, a model organism might be desirable if it is\nthe best representative for a specific mechanism despite being a very\npoor model for other phenomena or mechanisms. Variety is indicative of\nthe “whole organism” being the\n model.[17]\n A further distinction can be introduced between “model\norganisms” and “experimental organisms” (Ankeny and\nLeonelli 2011) or “general model organisms” and\n“Krogh-principle model organisms” (Love 2010). General\nmodel organisms are selected and used with the variety aspect of the\nrepresentational criterion preeminent; experimental or Krogh-principle\nmodel organisms are selected and used with specificity preeminent. \nOther issues relevant to the representation criterion include how\nindividual cells or cell types serve as developmental models (Fagan\n2016), how developmental mechanisms in different model organisms are\ncompared and evaluated (Yoshida forthcoming), how the use of model\norganisms constitutes an example of case-based reasoning (Ankeny\n2012), and how model organisms involve idealizations or known\ndepartures from features present in the model’s target as the\nresult of laboratory cultivation (Ankeny 2009;\n Section 5.2).\n Additionally, the question of representation is not the only one\ngermane to understanding model organism use. Because model organisms\nare utilized for experimental intervention, questions of\nrepresentation must be juxtaposed with questions of manipulation (see\nthe supplement on\n Model Organisms and Manipulation). \nThe relationships that obtain between development and evolution are\ncomplicated and under ongoing investigation (for a review, see Love\n2015). Two main axes dominate within a loose conglomeration of\nresearch programs (Raff 2000; Müller 2007): (a) the evolution of\ndevelopment, or inquiry into the pattern and processes of how ontogeny\nvaries and changes over time; and, (b) the developmental basis of\nevolution, or inquiry into the causal impact of ontogenetic processes\non evolutionary trajectories—both in terms of constraint and\nfacilitation. Two examples where the concepts and practices of\ndevelopmental and evolutionary biology intersect are treated here: the\nproblematic appeal to functional homology in developmental genetics\nthat is meant to underwrite evolutionary generalizations about\nontogeny\n (Section 5.1)\n and the tension between using normal stages for developmental\ninvestigation and determining the evolutionary significance of\nphenotypic plasticity\n (Section 5.2).\n These cases expose some of the philosophical issues inherent in how\ndevelopment and evolution can be related to one another. \nThe conserved role of Hox genes in axial patterning is\nreferred to as functionally homologous across animals (Manak and Scott\n1994), over and above the relation of structural homology that obtains\nbetween DNA sequences. And yet “functional homology” is a\ncontradiction in terms (Abouheif et al. 1997) because the definition\nof a homologue is “the same organ in different animals under\nevery variety of form and function” (Owen 1843: 379)—the\ndescendant, evolutionary distinction between homology (structure) and\nanalogy (function) is founded on this recognition. Therefore, the idea\nof functional homology appears theoretically confused and there is a\nconceptual tension in its use by molecular developmental\nbiologists. \nFigure 6: Vertebrate wings are\nhomologous as forelimbs; they are derived by common descent from the\nsame structure. The function of vertebrate wings (i.e., flight) is\nanalogous; although the wings fulfill similar functions, their role in\nflight has evolved separately. \nThe reference to “organ” in Owen’s definition is\nindicative of a structure (an entity) found in an organism that may\nvary in its shape and composition (form) or what it is for (function)\nin the species where it occurs. Translated into an evolutionary\ncontext, sameness is cashed out by reference to common ancestry. Since\nstructures also can be similar by virtue of natural selection\noperating in similar environments, homology is contrasted with\nanalogy. Homologous structures are the same by virtue of descent from\na common ancestor, regardless of what functions these structures are\ninvolved in, whereas analogous structures are similar by virtue of\nselection processes favoring comparable functional outcomes,\nregardless of common descent\n (Figure 6).\n  \nThis is what makes similarity of function an especially problematic\ncriterion of homology (Abouheif et al. 1997). Because functional\nsimilarity is the appropriate relation for analogy, it is not\nnecessary for analogues to have the same function as a consequence of\ncommon ancestry—similarity despite different origins suffices\n(Ghiselin 2005). Classic cases of analogy involve taxa that do not\nshare a recent common ancestor that exhibits the structure, such as\nthe external body morphology of dolphins and tuna (Pabst 2000). Thus,\nfunctional homology seems to be a category error because what a\nstructure does should not enter into an evaluation of homologue\ncorrespondence and similarity of function is often the result of\nadaptation via natural selection to common environmental demands, not\ncommon ancestry. \nAlthough we might be inclined to simply prohibit the terminology of\nfunctional homology, its widespread use in molecular and developmental\nbiology should at least make us\n pause.[18]\n While it is important to recognize this pervasive practice, some\noccurrences may be illicit. Swapping structurally homologous genes\nbetween species to rescue mutant or null phenotypes is not a genuine\ncriterion of functional homology, especially when there is little or\nno attention to establishing a phylogenetic context. This makes a\nnumber of claims of functional homology suspect. To not run afoul of\nthe conceptual tension, explicit attention must be given to the\nmeaning of “function.” Biological practice harbors at\nleast four separate meanings of function (Wouters 2003, 2005):\nactivity (what something does), causal role (contribution to a\ncapacity), fitness advantage or viability (value of having something),\nand selected effect or etiology (origination and maintenance via\nnatural selection). Debate has raged about which of them (if any) is\nmost appropriate for different aspects of biological and psychological\nreasoning or most general in scope (i.e., what makes them all function\nconcepts?) (see discussion in Garson 2016). Here the issue is whether\nwe can identify a legitimate concept of homology of function. \nIf we are to avoid mixing homology and analogy, then the appropriate\nnotion of function cannot be based on selection history, which is\nallied with the concept of analogy and concerns a particular variety\nof function. Similarly, viability interpretations concentrate on\nfeatures where the variety of function is critical because of\nconferred survival advantages. Any interpretation of function that\nrelies on a particular variety of function (because it was selected or\nbecause it confers viability) clashes with the demand that homology\nconcern something “under every variety of form and\nfunction.” A causal role interpretation emphasizes a systemic\ncapacity to which a function makes a contribution. It too focuses on a\nparticular variety of function, though in a way different from either\nselected effect or viability interpretations. Only an activity\ninterpretation (‘what something does’) accents the\nfunction itself, apart from its specific contribution to a systemic\ncapacity and position in a larger context. Therefore, the most\nappropriate meaning to incorporate into homology of function is\n“activity-function” because it is at least\npossible for activity-functions to remain constant under every\nvariety. An evaluation of sameness due to common ancestry is made\nseparately from the role the function plays (or its use), whether\nunderstood in terms of a causal role, a fitness advantage, or a\nhistory of\n selection.[19]Activity-functions can be put to different uses while being\nshared via common descent (i.e., homologous). More precisely, homology\nof function can be defined as the same activity-function in different\nanimals under every variety of form and use-function (Love 2007). This\nunambiguously removes the tension that plagued functional\nhomology. \nCareful discussions of regulatory gene function in development and\nevolution recognize something akin to the distinction between\nactivity- and use-function (i.e., between what a gene does and what it\nis for in some process within the organism). \nWhen studying the molecular evolution of regulatory genes, their\nbiochemical and developmental function must be considered separately.\nThe biochemical function of PAX-6 and eyeless are as\ngeneral transcription factors (which bind and activate downstream\ngenes), but their developmental function is their specific involvement\nin eye morphogenesis (Abouheif 1997: 407). \nThe biochemical function is the activity-function and the\ndevelopmental function is the use-function. This distinction helps to\ndiscriminate between divergent evolutionary trajectories. Biochemical\n(activity-functions) of genes are often conserved (i.e., homologous),\nwhile simultaneously being available for co-option to make causal role\ncontributions (use-functions) to distinct developmental processes. The\nsame regulatory genes are evolutionarily stable in terms of\nactivity-function and evolutionarily labile in terms of\n use-function.[20]\n By implication, claims about use-function homology for genes\nqua developmental function are suspect compared to those\nconcerning activity-function homology for genes qua\nbiochemical function because developmental functions are more likely\nto have changed as phylogenetic distance increases. \nThe distinction between biochemical (activity) function and\ndevelopmental (use) function is reinforced by the hierarchical aspects\nof homology (Hall 1994). A capacity defining the use-function of a\nregulatory gene at one level of organization, such as axial\npatterning, must be considered as an activity-function itself at\nanother level of organization, such as the differentiation of serially\nrepeated elements along a body axis. (Note that\n “level of organization”\n need not be compositional and thus the language of\n“higher” and “lower” levels may be\ninappropriate.) The developmental roles of Hox genes in axial\npatterning may be conserved by virtue of their biochemical\nactivity-function homologies but Hox genes are not\nuse-function homologues because of these developmental roles. Instead\nof focusing on the activity of a gene component and its causal role in\naxial patterning, we shift to the activity of axial patterning and its\ncausal role elsewhere (or elsewhen) in embryonic development. \nIntroducing a conceptually legitimate idea of homology of\nactivity-function is not about keeping the ideas of developmental\nbiology tidy. It assists in the interpretation of evidence and\ncircumscribes the inferences drawn. For example, NK-2 genes\nare involved in mesoderm specification, which underlies muscle\nmorphogenesis. In Drosophila, the expression of a particular\nNK-2 gene (tinman) is critical for both cardiac and\nvisceral mesoderm development. If tinman is knocked out and\ntransgenically replaced with its vertebrate orthologue,\nNkx2-5, only visceral mesoderm specification is rescued; the\nregulation of cardiac mesoderm is not (Ranganayakulu et al. 1998). A\nregion of the vertebrate protein near the 5′ end of the\npolypeptide differs enough to prevent appropriate regulation in\ncardiac morphogenesis. The homeodomains (stretches of sequence that\nconfer DNA binding) for vertebrate Nkx2-5 and\nDrosophila tinman are interchangeable. The inability\nof Nkx2-5 to rescue cardiac mesoderm specification is not\nrelated to the activity-function of differential DNA binding. One\ncomponent of the orthologous (homologous) proteins in both species\nretains an activity-function homology related to visceral mesoderm\nspecification but another component (not the homeodomain) has\ndiverged. This homeobox gene does not have a single use-function (as\nexpected), but it also does not have a single activity-function. Any\nadequate evaluation of these cases must recognize a more fine-grained\ndecomposition of genes into working units to capture genuine\nactivity-function conservation. We can link activity-function\nhomologues directly to structural motifs within a gene, but there is\nnot necessarily a single activity-function for an entire open reading\nframe. \nDefusing the conceptual tensions between developmental and\nevolutionary biology with respect to homology of function has a direct\nimpact on the causal generalizations and inferences made from model\norganisms\n (Section 4).\n Activity-function homology directs our attention to the stability or\nconservation of activities. This conservation is indicative of when\nthe study of mechanisms in model organisms will produce robust and\nstable generalizations\n (Section 1.3).\n The widespread use of functional homology in developmental biology is\naimed at exactly this kind of question, which explains its persistence\nin experimental biology despite conceptual ambiguities.\nGeneralizations concerning molecular signaling cascades are\nunderwritten by the coordinated biochemical activities in view, not\nthe developmental roles (though sometimes they may coincide). Thus,\nactivity-function details about a signaling cascade gleaned from a\nmodel organism can be generalized via homology to other unstudied\norganisms even if the developmental role varies for the\nactivity-function in other species. \nAll reasoning strategies combine distinctive strengths alongside of\nlatent weaknesses. For example, decomposing a system into its\nconstituents to understand the features manifested by the system\npromotes a dissection of the causal interactions of the localized\nconstituents, while downplaying interactions with elements external to\nthe system (Wimsatt 1980; Bechtel and Richardson 1993). Sometimes the\ndescriptive and explanatory practices of the sciences are successful\nprecisely because they intentionally ignore aspects of natural\nphenomena or use a variety of approximation techniques. Idealization\nis one type of reasoning strategy that scientists use to describe,\nmodel, and explain that purposefully departs from features known to be\npresent in nature. For example, the interior space of a cell is often\ndepicted as relatively empty even though intracellular space is known\nto be crowded (Ellis 2001); the variable of cellular volume takes on a\nvalue that is known to be false (i.e., relatively empty).\nIdealizations involve knowingly ignoring variations in properties or\nexcluding particular values for variables, in a variety of different\nways, for descriptive and explanatory purposes (Jones 2005; Weisberg\n2007). \n“Normal development” is conceptualized through strategies\nof abstraction that manage variation inherent within and across\ndeveloping organisms (Lowe 2015, 2016). The study of ontogeny in model\norganisms\n (Section 4)\n is usually executed by establishing a set of normal stages for\nembryonic development (see Other Internet Resources). A developmental\ntrajectory from fertilized zygote to fully-formed adult is broken down\ninto distinct temporal periods by reference to the occurrence of major\nevents, such as fertilization, gastrulation, or metamorphosis (Minelli\n2003: ch. 4; see\n Section 1.2).\n This enables researchers in different laboratory contexts to have\nstandardized comparisons of experimental results (Hopwood 2005, 2007).\nThey are critical to large communities of developmental biologists\nworking on well-established models, such as chick (Hamburger and\nHamilton 1951) or zebrafish (Kimmel et al. 1995): “Embryological\nresearch is now unimaginable without such standard series”\n(Hopwood 2005: 239). These normal stages are a form of idealization\nbecause they intentionally ignore kinds of variation in development,\nincluding variation associated with environmental variables. While\nfacilitating the study of particular causal relationships, this means\nthat specific kinds of variation in developmental features that might\nbe relevant to evolution are minimized in the process of rendering\nontogeny experimentally tractable (Love 2010). \nPhenotypic plasticity is a ubiquitous biological phenomenon. It\ninvolves the capacity of a particular genotype to generate phenotypic\nvariation, often in the guise of qualitatively distinct phenotypes, in\nresponse to differential environmental cues (Pigliucci 2001; DeWitt\nand Scheiner 2004; Kaplan 2008; Gilbert and Epel 2009). One familiar\nexample is seasonal caterpillar morphs that depend on different\nnutritional sources (Greene 1989). Some of the relevant environmental\nvariables include temperature, nutrition, pressure/gravity, light,\npredators or stressful conditions, and population density (Gilbert and\nEpel 2009). The reaction norm is a summary of the range of\nphenotypes, whether quantitatively or qualitatively varying, exhibited\nby organisms of a given genotype for different environmental\nconditions. When the reaction norm exhibits discontinuous variation or\nbivalent phenotypes (rather than quantitative, continuous variation),\nit is often labeled a polyphenism\n (Figure 7). \nFigure 7: A color polyphenism in\nAmerican Peppered Moth caterpillars that represents an example of\nphenotypic plasticity. \nPhenotypic plasticity has been of recurring interest to biological\nresearchers and controversial in evolutionary theory. Extensive study\nof phenotypic plasticity has occurred in the context of quantitative\ngenetic methods and phenotypic selection analyses, where the extent of\nplasticity in natural populations has been demonstrated and\noperational measures delineated for its detection (Scheiner 1993;\nPigliucci 2001). Other aspects of plasticity require different\ninvestigative methods to ascertain the sources of plasticity during\nontogeny, the molecular genetic mechanisms that encourage plasticity,\nand the kinds of mapping functions that exist between the genotype and\nphenotype (Pigliucci 2001; Kirschner and Gerhart 2005: ch. 5). These\nlatter aspects, the origin of phenotypic variation during and after\nontogeny, are in view at the intersection of development and\nevolution: How do molecular genetic mechanisms produce (or reduce)\nplasticity? What genotype-phenotype mapping functions are prevalent or\nrare? Does plasticity contribute to the origination of evolutionary\nnovelties (Moczek et al. 2011; West-Eberhard 2003)? \nIn order to evaluate these questions experimentally, researchers need\nto alter development through the manipulation of environmental\nvariables and observe how a novel phenotype can be established within\nthe existing plasticity of an organism (Kirschner and Gerhart 2005:\nch. 5). This manipulation could allow for the identification of\npatterns of variation through the reliable replication of particular\nexperimental alterations within different environmental regimes.\nHowever, without measuring variation across different environmental\nregimes, you cannot observe phenotypic plasticity. These measurements\nare required to document the degree of plasticity and its patterns for\na particular trait, such as qualitatively distinct morphs. An\nevaluation of the significance of phenotypic plasticity for evolution\nrequires answers to questions about where plasticity emerges, how\nmolecular genetic mechanisms are involved in the plasticity, and what\ngenotype-phenotype relations obtain. \nDevelopmental stages intentionally ignore variation associated with\nphenotypic plasticity. Animals and plants are raised under stable\nenvironmental conditions so that stages can be reproduced in different\nlaboratory settings and variation is often viewed as noise that must\nbe reduced or eliminated if one is to understand how development works\n(Frankino and Raff 2004). This practice also encourages the selection\nof model organisms that exhibit less plasticity (Bolker 1995). The\nlaboratory domestication of a model organism may also reduce the\namount or type of observable phenotypic variation (Gu et al. 2005),\nthough laboratory domestication also can increase variation (e.g., via\ninbreeding). Despite attempts to reduce variation by controlling\nenvironmental factors, some of it always remains (Lowe 2015) and is\ndisplayed by the fact that absolute chronology is not a reliable\nmeasure of time in ontogeny, and neither is the initiation or\ncompletion of its different parts (Mabee et al. 2000; Sheil and\nGreenbaum 2005). Developmental stages allow this recalcitrant\nvariation to be effectively ignored by judgments of embryonic\ntypicality. Normal stages also involve assumptions about the causal\nconnections between different processes across sequences of stages\n(Minelli 2003: ch. 4). Once these stages have been constructed, it is\npossible to use them as a visual standard against which to recognize\nand describe variation as a deviation from the norm (DiTeresi 2010;\nLowe 2016). But, more typically, variation ignored in the construction\nof these stages is also ignored in the routine consultation of the\nstages in day-to-day research contexts (Frankino and Raff 2004). \nNormal stages fulfill a number of goals related to descriptive and\nexplanatory endeavors that developmental biologists engage in (Kimmel\net al. 1995). They yield a way to measure experimental replication,\nenable consistent and unambiguous communication among researchers,\nespecially if stages are founded on commonly observable morphological\nfeatures, facilitate accurate predictions of developmental phenomena,\nand aid in making comparisons or generalizations across species. As\nidealizations of ontogeny, normal stages allow for a classification of\ndevelopmental events that is comprehensive with suitably sized and\nrelatively homogeneous stages, reasonably sharp boundaries between\nstages, and stability under different investigative conditions\n(Dupré 2001), which encourages more precise explanations within\nparticular disciplinary approaches (Griesemer 1996). Idealizations\nalso can facilitate abstraction and generalization, both of which are\na part of extrapolating findings from the investigative context of a\nmodel organism to other domains (Steel 2008; see\n Section 4\n and\n 5.1). \nThere are various weaknesses associated with normal stages that\naccompany the fulfillment of these investigative and explanatory\ngoals. Key morphological indicators sometimes overlap stages,\nterminology that is useful for one purpose may be misleading for\nanother, particular terms can be misleading in cross-species\ncomparisons, and manipulation of the embryo for continued observation\ncan have a causal impact on ontogeny. Avoiding variability in stage\nindicators can encourage overlooking the significance of this\nvariation, or at least provide a reason to favor its minimization. \nThus, there are good reasons for adopting normal stages to periodize\nmodel organism ontogeny, and these reasons help to explain why their\ncontinued use yields empirical success. However, similar to other\nstandard (successful) practices in science, normal stages are often\ntaken for granted, which means their biasing effects are neglected\n(Wimsatt 1980), some of which are relevant to evolutionary questions\n(e.g., systematically underestimating the extent of variation in a\npopulation). This is critical to recognize because the success of a\nperiodization is not a function of the eventual ability to relax the\nidealizations; periodizations are not slowly corrected so that they\nbecome less idealized. Instead, new periodizations are constructed and\nused alongside the existing ones because different idealizations\ninvolve different judgments of typicality that serve diverse\ndescriptive and explanatory aims. In addition to the systematic biases\ninvolved in developmental staging, most model organisms are poorly\nsuited to inform us about how environmental effects modulate or\ncombine with genetic or other factors in development—they make\nit difficult to discover details about mechanisms underlying reaction\nnorms. Short generation times and rapid development are tightly\ncorrelated with insensitivity to environmental conditions through\nvarious mechanisms such as prepatterning (Bolker 1995). \nThe tension between the specific practice of developmental staging in\nmodel organisms and uncovering the relevance of variation due to\nphenotypic plasticity for evolution can be reconstructed as an\nargument. \nAlthough this tension obtains even if the focus is not on evolutionary\nquestions, sometimes encouraging developmental biologists to interpret\nabsence of evidence as evidence of the developmental insignificance of\nphenotypic plasticity, it is exacerbated for evolutionary researchers.\nThe documentation of patterns of variation is precisely what is\nrequired to gauge the evolutionary significance of phenotypic\nplasticity. Practices of developmental staging in model organisms can\nretard our ability to make either a positive or negative assessment.\nDevelopmental staging, in conjunction with the properties of model\norganisms, tends to encourage a negative assessment of the\nevolutionary importance of phenotypic plasticity because the variation\nis not manifested and documented, and therefore is unlikely to be\nreckoned as substantive. Idealizations involving normal stages\ndiscourage a robust experimental probing of phenotypic plasticity,\nwhich is an obstacle to determining its evolutionary significance. \nThe consequences of this tension for the intersection of development\nand evolution are two-fold. First, the most powerful experimental\nsystems for studying development are set up to minimize variation that\nmay be critical to comprehending how evolutionary processes occur in\nnature. Second, if evolutionary investigations revolve around a\ncharacter that was assessed for typicality to underwrite the temporal\npartitions that we call stages, then much of the variation in this\ncharacter was conceptually removed as a part of rendering the model\norganism experimentally\n tractable.[21] \nThe identification of drawbacks that accompany strategies of\nidealization used to study development invites consideration of ways\nto address the liabilities identified (Love 2006). We can construct a\nprincipled perspective on how to address these liabilities by adding\nthree further premises: \nAt least two compensatory tactics can promote observations of\nvariation due to phenotypic plasticity that is ignored when\ndevelopmental stages are constructed for model organisms: the\nemployment of diverse model organisms and the adoption of alternate\nperiodizations. \nVariation often will be observable in non-standard model organisms\nbecause experimental organisms that do not have large communities\nbuilt around them are less likely to have had their embryonic\ndevelopment formally staged, and thus the effects of idealization on\nphenotypic plasticity are not operative. In turn, researchers are\nsensitized to the ways in which these kinds of variation are being\nmuted in the study of standard models. Stages can be used then as\nvisual standards to identify variation as deviations from a norm and\nthereby characterize patterns of\n variability.[22] \nA second compensatory tactic is the adoption of alternative\nperiodizations. This involves choosing different characters to\nconstruct new temporal partitions, thereby facilitating the\nobservation of variation with respect to characteristics previously\nstabilized in the normal stage periodization. These alternative\nperiodizations often divide a subset of developmental events according\nto processes or landmarks that differ from those used to construct the\nnormal stages, and they may not map one-one onto the existing normal\nstages, especially if they encompass events beyond the trajectory from\nfertilization to a sexually mature adult. This lack of isomorphism\nbetween periodizations also will be manifested if different measures\nof time are utilized, whether sequence (event ordering) or duration\n(succession of defined intervals), and whether sequences or durations\nare measured relative to one another or against an external standard,\nsuch as absolute chronology (Reiss 2003; Colbert and Rowe 2008). These\nincompatibilities prevent assimilating the alternative periodizations\ninto a single, overarching staging scheme. In all of these cases,\nidealization is involved and therefore each new periodization is\nsubject to the liabilities of ignoring kinds of variation. However,\nalternative periodizations require choosing different characters to\nstabilize and typify when defining its temporal partitions, which\nmeans different kinds of variation will be exposed than were\npreviously\n observable.[23] \nThe compensatory tactics of employing a diversity of model organisms\nand adopting alternative periodizations may be conceptually\nappropriate for addressing how the practice of developmental staging\nhas an impact on the detection of phenotypic plasticity, but this does\nnot remove associated costs (human, financial, and otherwise) or\ncontroversy. The advantages of a single, comprehensive periodization\nfor a general model organism (e.g., zebrafish normal stages) must be\nweighed in light of the advantages of alternative, process-specific\nperiodizations. However, by openly scrutinizing these practices in\nrelation to the phenomenon of interest and recognizing both advantages\nand drawbacks involved in the idealizations utilized, developmental\nand evolutionary biologists are better positioned to offer systematic\ndescriptions and comprehensive explanations of biological\nphenomena. \nThis entry has only sampled a small portion of work relevant to the\nimport and promise of conceptual reflection on the epistemology of\ndevelopmental biology. Much more could be said about each of the above\ndomains, such as a more fine-grained analysis of how normal stages\noperate as types in developmental biology (DiTeresi 2010; Lowe 2016).\nAdditionally, little has been said about how evidence works in\ndevelopmental biological experimentation or differences between\nconfirmatory and exploratory experimentation (Hall 2005;\nO’Malley 2007; Waters 2007b), nor have I treated the role of\nmetaphors and models that characterize key practices in developmental\nbiology (Fagan 2013; Keller 2002). The latter have been perspicuously\nanalyzed via increased attention to the details of particular research\nprograms. Finally, nothing has been said about the metaphysical\nimplications of developmental phenomena (a key input for\n Aristotle’s metaphysics).\n Concepts of potentiality are very natural in descriptions of\nembryological phenomena (e.g., the pluripotency of stem cells or the\npotential of a germ layer to yield different kinds of tissue lineages)\nand some have argued that empirical advances in developmental biology\nsupport a new form of essentialism about biological natural kinds\n(Austin 2019). This bears on how we understand dispositions (see the\nentry on\n dispositions)\n because the triggering conditions are often complex and multiply\nrealized (including manifestations without a trigger), as well as the\nfact that cells exhibit dispositions with multiple possible\nmanifestations (cell types) in specific sequential orderings\n(Hüttemann and Kaiser 2018; Laplane 2016). Metaphysical issues\nalso arise in the context of human developmental biology, such as how\nto understand the ontology of pregnancy (Kingma 2018; Sidzinska 2017).\nThus, developmental biology displays not only a rich array of material\nand conceptual practices that can be analyzed to better understand the\nscientific reasoning exhibited in experimental life science, but also\npoints in the direction of new ideas for metaphysics, especially when\nthat endeavor explicitly considers the input of empirically successful\nsciences.","contact.mail":"aclove@umn.edu","contact.domain":"umn.edu"}]
