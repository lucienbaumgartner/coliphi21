In §1 it is explained what it\nis, and what it is not. Its importance and wide applicability in\nlinguistics, philosophy, science and everyday life are briefly\nsurveyed in §2.  Whether types are universals is discussed in\n§3. §4 discusses some other suggestions for what types are,\nboth generally and specifically.  Is a type the sets of its tokens?\nWhat exactly is a word, a symphony, a species? §5 asks what a\ntoken is. §6 considers the relation between types and their\ntokens. Do the type and all its tokens share the same properties? Must\nall the tokens be alike in some or all respects? §7 explains some\nproblems for the view that types exist, and some problems for the view\nthat they don't. §8 elucidates a distinction often confused with\nthe type-token distinction, that between a type (or token) and an\noccurrence of it. It also discusses some problems that\noccurrences might be thought to give rise to, and one way to resolve\nthem.\n\n\n\nThe distinction between a type and its tokens is\nan ontological one between a general sort of thing and its particular\nconcrete instances (to put it in an intuitive and preliminary way). So\nfor example consider the number of words in the Gertrude Stein line\nfrom her poem Sacred Emily on the page in front of the\nreader's eyes: \n\nIn one sense of ‘word’ we may count three different\nwords; in another sense we may count ten different words. C. S. Peirce\n(1931-58, sec. 4.537) called words in the first sense\n“types” and words in the second sense “tokens”.\nTypes are generally said to be abstract and unique; tokens are concrete\nparticulars, composed of ink, pixels of light (or the suitably\ncircumscribed lack thereof) on a computer screen, electronic strings of\ndots and dashes, smoke signals, hand signals, sound waves, etc. A study\nof the ratio of written types to spoken types found that there are\ntwice as many word types in written Swedish as in spoken Swedish\n(Allwood, 1998). If a pediatrician asks how many words the toddler has\nuttered and is told “three hundred”, she might well enquire\n“word types or word tokens?” because the former answer\nindicates a prodigy. A headline that reads “From the Andes to\nEpcot, the Adventures of an 8,000 year old Bean” might elicit\n“Is that a bean type or a bean token?”. \n\nAlthough the matter is discussed more fully in §8 below, it should\nbe mentioned here at the outset that the type-token distinction is not\nthe same distinction as that between a type and (what logicians call)\nits occurrences. Unfortunately, tokens are often explained as\nthe “occurrences” of types, but not all occurrences of\ntypes are tokens. To see why, consider this time how many words there\nare in the Gertrude Stein line itself, the line type, not a\ntoken copy of it. Again, the correct answer is either three or ten, but\nthis time it cannot be ten word tokens. The line is an\nabstract type with no unique spatio-temporal location and therefore\ncannot consist of particulars, of tokens. But as there are only three\nword types of which it might consist, what then are we counting ten of?\nThe most apt answer is that (following logicians' usage) it is\ncomposed of ten occurrences of word types. See §8 below,\nOccurrences, for more details. \n\nIt is generally accepted that linguists are interested in types.\nSome, e.g. Lyons (1977, p. 28), claim the linguist is interested only\nin types. Whether this is so or not, linguists certainly appear to be\nheavily committed to types; they “talk as though” there\nare types. That is, they often quantify over types in their theories\nand refer to them by means of singular terms. As Quine has emphasized,\na theory is committed to the existence of entities of a given sort if\nand only if they must be counted among the values of the variables in\norder for the statements in the theory to be true. Linguistics is rife\nwith such quantifications. For example, we are told that an educated\nperson's vocabulary is about 15,000 words, but Shakespeare's\nwas more nearly 30,000. These are types, as are the twenty-six\nletters of the English alphabet, and its eighteen cardinal\nvowels. (Obviously the numbers would be much larger if we\nwere counting tokens). Linguists also frequently refer to types by\nmeans of singular terms. According to the O.E.D., for\nexample, the noun ‘color’’ is from early\nmodern English and in addition to its pronunciation [kɒ’\nlər] has two \"modern current or most usual spellings\" [colour,\ncolor], eighteen earlier spellings [collor, collour, coloure, colowr,\ncolowre, colur, colure, cooler, couler, coullor, coullour, coolore,\ncoulor, coulore, coulour, culler, cullor, cullour] and eighteen senses\n(vol. 2, p. 636).  According to Webster's, the word\n‘schedule’ has four current pronunciations:\n['ske-(,)jü(ə)l], ['ske-jəl] (US),\n['she-jəl] (Can) and ['she-(,)dyü(ə)l]\n(Brit) (p. 1044). Thus, linguistics is apparently committed\nto the existence of these words, which are types. \n\nReferences to types is not limited to letters, vowels and words, but\noccur extensively in all branches of linguistics. Lexicography\ndiscusses, in terms that make it clear that it is types being referred\nto, nouns, verbs, words, their stems, definitions, forms,\npronunciations and origins. Phonetics is committed to consonants,\nsyllables, words and sound segments, the human vocal tract and its\nparts (the tongue has five). Phonology also organizes sounds but in\nterms of phonemes, allophones, alternations, utterances, phonological\nrepresentations, underlying forms, syllables, words, stress-groups,\nfeet and tone groups. Morphology is apparently committed to morphemes,\nroots, affixes, and so forth, and syntax to sentences, semantic\nrepresentations, LF representations, among other things. Clearly, just\nas words and letters and vowels have tokens, so do all of the other\nitems mentioned (nouns, pronunciations, syllables, tone groups and so\nforth). It is more controversial whether the items studied in\nsemantics (the meanings of signs, their sense relations, etc.) also\ncome in types and tokens, and similarly for pragmatics (including\nspeaker meanings, sentence meanings, implicatures, presuppositions,\netc.) It seems to hinge on whether a mental event (token) or part of\nit could be a meaning, a matter that cannot be gone into here. See\nDavis (2003) for a view according to which concepts and\nthoughts—varieties of meaning—come in types and\ntokens. \n\nIt is notable that when one of the above types is defined, it is\ndefined in terms of other types. So for example, sentences might be\n(partly) defined in terms of words, and words in terms of phonemes. \n\nThe universal and largely unscrutinized reliance of linguistics on the\ntype-token relationship and related distinctions like that of\nlangue to parole, and competence to\nperformance, is the subject of Hutton's cautionary book\n(1990). \n\nObviously then, types play an important role in philosophy of\nlanguage, linguistics and, with its emphasis on expressions, logic.\nEspecially noteworthy is the debate concerning the relation between the\nmeaning of a sentence type and the speaker's meaning in using a\ntoken (a relation that figures prominently in Grice 1969). But the\ntype-token distinction also functions significantly in other branches\nof philosophy as well. In philosophy of mind, it yields two\nversions of the identity theory of mind (each of which is criticized in\nKripke 1972). The type version of the identity theory (defended by\nSmart (1959) and Place (1956) among others) identifies types\nof mental events/states/processes with types of physical\nevents/states/processes. It says that just as lightning turned out to\nbe electrical discharge, so pain might turn out to be c-fiber\nstimulation, and consciousness might turn out to be brain waves of 40\ncycles per second. On this type view, thinking and feeling are certain\ntypes of neurological processes, so absent those processes, there can\nbe no thinking. The token identity theory (defended by Kim (1966) and\nDavidson (1980) among others) maintains that every token mental event\nis some token physical event or other, but it denies that a type\nmatch-up must be expected. So for example, even if pain in humans turns\nout to be c-fiber stimulation, there may be other life forms that lack\nc-fibers but have pains too. And even if consciousness in humans turns\nout to be a brain waves that occur 40 times per second, perhaps\nandroids have consciousness even if they lack such brain waves. \n\nIn aesthetics, it is generally necessary to distinguish\nworks of art themselves (types) from their physical incarnations\n(tokens). (See, for example, Wollheim 1968, Wolterstorff 1980 and\nDavies 2001.) This is not the case with respect to oil paintings like\nthe Mona Lisa where there is and perhaps can be only one\ntoken, but seems to be the case for many other works of art. There can\nbe more than one token of a sculpture made from a mold, more than one\nelegant building made from a blueprint, more than one copy of a film,\nand more than one performance of a musical work. Beethoven wrote nine\nsymphonies, but although he conducted the first performance of\nSymphony No. 9, he never heard the Ninth, whereas the rest of\nus have all heard it, that is, we have all heard tokens of it. \n\nIn ethics, actions are said to be right/wrong—but is it\naction types or only action tokens? There is a dispute about this. Most\nethicists from Mill (1979) to Ross (1988) hold that the hallmark of\nethical conduct is universalizability, so that a particular action is\nright/wrong only if it is right/wrong for anyone else in similar\ncircumstances—in other words, only if it is the right/wrong\ntype of action. If certain types of actions are right and\nothers wrong, then there may be general indefeasible ethical principles\n(however complicated they may be to state, and whether they can be\nstated at all). But some ethicists hold that there are no general\nethical principles that hold come what may—that there is always some\ncircumstance in which such principles would prescribe the wrong\noutcome—and such ethicists may go on to add that only particular\n(token) actions are right/wrong, not types of actions. See, for\nexample, Murdoch 1970 and Dancy 2004. \n\nOutside of philosophy and linguistics, scientists often quantify\nover types in their theories and refer to them by means of singular\nterms. When, for example, we read that the “Spirit Bear” is\na rare white bear that lives in rain forests along the British Columbia\ncoast, we know that no particular bear is rare, but rather a\ntype of bear. When we are told that these Kermode bears “have a\nmutation in the gene for the melanocortin 1 receptor” (The\nWashington Post 9/24/01 A16) we know that it is not a token\nmutation, token gene and token receptor being referred to, but a type.\nIt is even more evident that a type is being referred to when it is\nclaimed that “all men carry the same Y chromosome…. This\none and only Y has the same sequence of DNA units in every man alive\nexcept for the occasional mutation that has cropped up every thousand\nyears” (The New York Times, Nicholas Wade 5/27/03).\nSimilarly, to say the ivory-billed woodpecker is not extinct is to be\nreferring to a type, a species. (The status of species will be\ndiscussed in greater detail in §4 below.) \n\nThe preceding paragraph contains singular terms that (apparently)\nrefer to types. An even more telling commitment to types are the\nfrequent quantifications over them. Mayr (1970, p. 233), for example,\ntells us that “there are about 28,500 subspecies of birds in a\ntotal of 8,600 species, an average of 3.3 subspecies per\nspecies…79 species of swallows have an average of 2.6\nsubspecies, while 70 species of cuckoo shrikes average 4.6\nsubspecies”. Although these examples come from biology, physics\n(or any other science) would provide many examples too. It was claimed\n(in the sixties), for example, that “there are thirty particles,\nyet all but the electron, neutrino, photon, graviton, and proton are\nunstable.” Artifactual types (the Volvo 850 GLT, the Dell\nLatitude D610 laptop) easily lend themselves to reference also. In\nchess we are told that accepting the Queen's Gambit with 2…dc\nhas been known since 1512, but Black must be careful in this\nopening—the pawn snatch is too risky. Type-talk is ubiquitous. \n\nAre types universals? They have usually been so conceived, and with\ngood reason. But the matter is controversial. It depends in part on\nwhat a universal is. (See the entry on\n properties.)\n Universals, in contrast to particulars, have been characterized as\nhaving instances, being repeatable, being abstract, being acausal,\nlacking a spatio-temporal location and being predicable of\nthings. Whether universals have all these characteristics cannot\nbe resolved here. The point is that types seem to have some, but not\nall, of these characteristics. As should be clear from the preceding\ndiscussion, types have or are capable of having instances, of being\nexemplified; they are repeatable. To many, this is enough to count as\nuniversals. With respect to being abstract and lacking a\nspatio-temporal location, types are also akin to universals—that\nis, they are if universals are. On certain views of types and\nuniversals, types, unlike their instances, are abstract and lack a\nspatio-temporal location. On other views, types and universals are\nin their instances and hence are neither abstract nor\nacausal; far from lacking a spatio-temporal location, they usually\nhave many. (For more details, see §5 below, The Relation\nbetween Types and Tokens.) So far, then, types appear to be a\nspecies of universal, and most metaphysicians would so classify\nthem. (Although a few would not. Zemach (1992), for example, holds\nthat there are no universals, but there are types, which are\nrepeatable particulars—the cat may be in many different\nplaces at the same time.) \n\nWhen it comes to being predicable, however, most types\ndiverge from such classic examples of universals as the property of\nbeing white or the relation of being east of. They\nseem not to be predicable, or at least not as obviously so as the\nclassic examples of universals. That is, if the hallmark of a\nuniversal is to answer to a predicate or open sentence such as\nbeing white answers to ‘is white’, then most\ntypes do not resemble universals, as they more readily answer to\nsingular terms.  This is amply illustrated by the type talk exhibited\nin §2 above. It is also underscored by the observation that it is\nmore natural to say of a token of a word—‘infinity’,\nsay—that it is a token of the word ‘infinity’ than\nthat it is an ‘infinity’.  That is to say, types seem to\nbe objects, like numbers and sets, rather than properties or\nrelations; it's just that they are not concrete particulars but\nare general objects—abstract objects, on some views. If, then,\nwe follow Gottlob Frege (1977) in classifying all objects as being the\nsort of thing referred to by singular terms, and all properties as the\nsort of thing referred to by predicates, then types would be\nobjects. Hence they would not fall into the same category as the\nclassic examples of universals such as being white and\nbeing east of, and thus perhaps should not be considered\nuniversals at all. (Although perhaps all this shows is that they are\nnot akin to properties, but are their own kind of universal.)  A\ngeneral exception to what has just been claimed about how we refer to\ntypes (with singular terms) might be inferred from the fact that we do\nmore often say of an animal that it is a tiger, rather than that it is\na member of the species Felis Tigris. This raises the\nquestion as to whether the species Felis Tigris is just the\nproperty of being a tiger, and if it isn't, then what\nthe relation between these two items is. \n\nWollheim (1968, p. 76) insightfully puts the point that types seem\nto be objects as that the relationship between a type and its tokens is\n“more intimate” than that between (a classic example of) a\nproperty and its instances because “for much of the time we think\nand talk of the type as though it were itself a kind of token, though a\npeculiarly important or pre-eminent one”. He (1968, p. 77)\nmentions two other differences worth noting between types and the\nclassic examples of universals. One is that although types and the\nclassic examples of properties often satisfy the same predicates, there\nare many more predicates shared between a type and its tokens than\nbetween a classic example of a property and its instances.\n(Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 is in the same key, has the\nsame number of measures, same number of notes, etc. as a great many of\nits tokens.) Second, he argues that predicates true of tokens in virtue\nof being tokens of the type are therefore true of the type (Old\nGlory is rectangular) but this is never the case with classic\nproperties (being white is not white.) \n\nThese considerations may not suffice to show that types aren't\nuniversals, but they do point to a difference between types and the\nclassic examples of properties. \n\nThe question permits answers at varying levels of generality. At its\nmost general, it is a request for a theory of types, the way set\ntheory answers the question “what is a set?” A general\nanswer would tell us what sort of thing a type—any\ntype—is. For example, is it sui generis, or a\nuniversal, or perhaps the set of its tokens, or a function from worlds\nto sets, or a kind, or, as Peirce maintained, a law? These options are\ndiscussed in §4.1. At a more specific level, “what is a\ntype?” is a request for a theory that would shed some light on\nthe identity conditions for specific types of types, not necessarily\nall of them. It would yield an account of what a word (or a symphony,\na species, a disease, etc.) is. This is in many ways a more difficult\nthing to do. To see just how difficult it is to give the identity\nconditions for an individual type, §4.2 considers what a word is,\nboth because words are our paradigm of types, since the\ntype-token distinction is generally illustrated by means of words, and\nbecause doing so will show that some of the most common assumptions\nmade about types and their tokens are not correct. It will also\nilluminate some of the things we want from a theory of types. \n\nAs mentioned in the previous paragraph, one way a theory of types\nmight answer the question “what is a type?” is the way set\ntheory answers the question “what is a set?” If types\nare universals, as most thinkers assume, then there are as\nmany theories of types as there are theories of universals. Some\naxiomatic theories include Zalta 1983 and Jubien 1988. Since theories\nof universals are discussed at length in this Encyclopedia elsewhere,\nthey will not be repeated here. (See \n properties.) \n However it might be said that types are not universals for\nthe reasons mentioned in §3 above, where it was urged that types\nmight be neither properties nor relations but objects, and there is an\nabsolute difference between objects and properties. Identifying types\nas universals would appear to fly in the face of that\nconsideration. \n\nIt might appear that types are better construed as sets (assuming sets\nthemselves are not universals). The natural thought is that a type is\nthe set of its tokens, which is how Quine sometimes (1987, p. 218)\nconstrues a type. After all, a species is often said to be “the\nclass of its members”. There are two serious problems with this\nconstrual. One is that many types have no tokens and yet they are\ndifferent types. For example, there are a lot of very long sentences\nthat have no tokens. So if a type were just the set of its tokens,\nthese distinct sentences would be wrongly classified as identical,\nbecause each would be identical to the null set. Another closely\nrelated problem also stems from the fact that sets, or classes, are\ndefined extensionally, in terms of their members. The set of natural\nnumbers without the number 17 is a distinct set from the set of\nnatural numbers. One way to put this is that classes have their\nmembers essentially. Not so the species homo\nsapiens, the word ‘the’, nor Beethoven's Symphony\nNo. 9. The set of specimens of homo sapiens without\nGeorge W. Bush is a different set from the set of specimens of\nhomo sapiens with him, but the species would be the same even\nif George W. Bush did not exist. That is, it is false that had George\nW. Bush never existed, the species homo sapiens would not\nhave existed. The same species might have had different members; it\ndoes not depend for its existence on the existence of all its members\nas sets do. \n\nBetter, then, but still in keeping with an extensional set-theoretic\napproach, would be to identify a type as a function from worlds to sets\nof objects in that world. It is difficult to see any motivation for\nthis move that would not also motivate identifying properties as such\nfunctions and then we are left with the question of whether types are\nuniversals, discussed in §3. \n\nThe example of homo sapiens suggests that perhaps a type is\na kind, where a kind is not a set (for the reasons mentioned\ntwo paragraphs above). Of course, this raises the question of what a\nkind is; Wolterstorff (1970) adopts the kind view of types and\nidentifies kinds as universals. In Wolterstorff 1980, he takes\nbeing an example of as undefined and uses it to define\nkinds—so that, for example, a possible kind is one such that it is\npossible there is an example of it. Norm kinds he then defines\nas kinds “such that it is possible for them to have properly\nformed and also possible for them to have improperly formed\nexamples” (p. 56). He identifies both species and artworks as\nnorm-kinds. Bromberger (1992a) also views the tokens of a type as a\nquasi-natural kind relative to appropriate projectible (“What is\nits freezing point?” e.g.) and individuating questions\n(“Where was it on June 13th, 2005?”). However,\nhe doesn't identify the type as the kind itself, since to do so\ndoes not do justice to the semantic facts mentioned in §2 above, that\ntypes are largely referred to by singular terms. Instead he views the\ntype as what he calls the archetype of the kind, defined as\nsomething that models all the tokens of a kind with respect to\nprojectible questions but not something that admits of answers to\nindividuating questions. Thus for Bromberger the type is not the kind\nitself, but models all the tokens of the kind. We shall see some\ndifficulties for this view in §5 below. \n\nIt wouldn't do to ignore what the coiner of the type-token\ndistinction had to say about types. Unfortunately it cannot be\nadequately unpacked without an in-depth explication of Peirce's\nsemiotics, which cannot be embarked upon here. (See the entries on\n Charles Sanders Peirce and\n Peirce's theory of signs.)\n Peirce said types “do not exist”, yet they are\n“definitely Significant Forms” that “determine\nthings that do exist” (4.423). A type, or “legisign”\nas he also calls it, “has a definite identity, though usually\nadmitting a great variety of appearances. Thus, & and and\nthe sound are all one word” (8.334). Elsewhere he tells us that\na type is “a general law that is a sign. This law is usually\nestablished by men. Every conventional sign is a legisign. It is not a\nsingle object, but a general type which…shall be\nsignificant. …[E]very Legisign requires Sinsigns”\n(2.246). Sinsigns are tokens. (It should be mentioned that for Peirce\nthere is actually a trichotomy among types, tokens and tones,\nor qualisigns, which are “the mere quality of appearance”\n(8.334).) Thus types have a definite identity as signs, are general\nlaws established by men, but they do not exist. Perhaps all Peirce\nmeant by saying they do not exist was that they are “not\nindividual things” (6.334), that they are, instead what he calls\n“generals”—not to be confused with universals. What\nhe might have meant by a “general law” is\nuncertain. Stebbing (1935, p.15) suggests “a rule in accordance\nwith which tokens … could be so used as to have meaning\nattached to them”. Greenlee (1973, p. 137) suggests that for\nPeirce a type is \"a habit controlling a specific way of responding\ninterpretatively.\" Perhaps, then, types are of a psychological nature.\nObviously two people can have the same habit, so habits also\ncome in types and tokens. Presumably, types are then habit types. This\naccount may be plausible for words, but it is not plausible for\nsentences, because there are sentences that have no tokens because if\nΦ,Ψ are sentences, then so is (Φ & Ψ) and it is\nclear that for Peirce \"every [type] requires [tokens]\" (2.246). And it\nis much less plausible for non-linguistic types, like types of\nbeetles, some of which have yet to be discovered. \n\nNo general theory of types can tell us what we often want to know\nwhen we ask: what is a species, a symphony, a word, a poem, or a\ndisease? Such questions are just as difficult to answer as what a type\nis in general. Even if types were sets, for example, set theory by\nitself will not answer the burning question of which set a species is.\nOne would then have to go to biology and philosophy of biology to find\nout whether a species is (i) “a set of individuals closely\nresembling each other” as Darwin (1859, p. 52) would have it, (ii)\na set of “individuals sharing the same genetic code” as\nPutnam (1975, p. 239) would have it, (iii) a set of “interbreeding\nnatural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such\ngroups”, as Mayr (1970, p. 12) would have it, or (iv) a set\ncomprising “a lineage evolving separately from others and with\nits own unitary evolutionary role and tendencies”, as Simpson\n(1961, p. 153) would have it. Similarly, if there is a question of\ncopyright infringement, one had best look to industry standards and\naesthetics for what a film or a song is, and not set theory. In\ngeneral, questions such as “what is a poem, a phoneme, a disease,\na flag,….?” are to be pursued in conjunction with a\nspecific discipline, and not within the confines of a general theory of\ntypes. It is largely up to linguistics and the philosophy of it, e.g.,\nto determine the identity conditions for phonemes, allophones, cardinal\nvowels, LF representations, tone groups and all the other linguistic\ntypes mentioned in §2 above. \n\nIt's instructive to consider what our paradigm of a type is—a\nword. It will reveal how complicated the identity conditions are for\neven one specific type, and help to dispel the idea that tokens are to\ntypes as cookies are to cookie cutters. It will also show what we\ndesire from a theory of types, by exhibiting the facts that a theory\nof types has to accommodate. We illustrated the type-token distinction\nby appealing to words, so presumably we think we know at\nleast roughly what a word type is. Unfortunately, everyone seems to\nthink they know, but there is massive disagreement on the matter in\nphilosophy. However, as urged in the preceding paragraph, it is\ncrucial to rely on linguistics when we consider what a word is. When\nwe do we find that there are different linguistic criteria for what a\nword is, and a good deal of the disagreement can be chalked up to this\nfact.  McArthur 1992's The Oxford Companion to the English\nLanguage (pp. 1120-1) lists eight: orthographic, phonological,\nmorphological, lexical, grammatical, onomastic, lexicographical and\nstatistical— but adds that more can be demarcated. There are\ndifferent types of types of words. However deserving of attention\neach of these is, it will be useful to focus on just one, and I will\ndo so in what follows. There is an important and very common use of\nthe word ‘word’ that lexicographers and the rest of us use\nfrequently. It is, roughly, the sort of thing that merits a\ndictionary entry. (Roughly, because some entries in the\ndictionary, e.g.,‘il-,’ ‘-ile,’ and\n‘metric system,’ are not words, and some words, e.g. many\nproper names, do not get a dictionary entry.) This notion was at play\nin our opening remarks in §2 about Shakespeare's vocabulary\ncontaining 30,000 words, and the twenty spellings and eighteen senses\nof the noun ‘color’/’colour’, the verb\n‘color’/’colour’, and four current\npronunciations of the noun ‘schedule’. These examples show\n(in this ordinary sense of ‘word’) that the same word can\nbe written or spoken, can have more than one correct spelling, can\nhave more than one correct spelling at the same time, can have more\nthan one sense at the same time and can have more than one correct\npronunciation at the same time. It also shows that different words can\nhave the same correct spelling and pronunciation; further obvious\nexamples would show that different words can have the same\nsense—e.g. English ‘red’ and French\n‘rouge’. A theory of types, or of word types, that cannot\naccommodate this notion of a word is worthless. In what follows, I\nshall use ‘word’ in this sense. \n\nIdeally, a theory of words and their tokens should tell us not only\n(i) what a word is (in the sense indicated), but (ii) how a word is to\nbe individuated, (iii) whether there is anything all and only tokens of a\nparticular word have in common (other than being tokens of that word);\n(iv) how we know about words; (v) what the relation is between words\nand their tokens; (vi) what makes a token a token of one word rather\nthan another; (vii) how word tokens are to be individuated; and (viii)\nwhat makes us think a particular is a token of one word rather than\nanother. These questions are distinct, although they are apt to run\ntogether because the answer to one may give rise to answers to others.\nFor example, if we say in answer to (iii), that all tokens of a\ncertain word (say, ‘cat’) have something in common besides\nbeing tokens of that word—they are all spelled\n‘c’-‘a’-‘t’, for\nexample—then we may be inclined to say to (vi) that\nspelling makes a word token a token of ‘cat’\nrather than some other type; and to (vii) that word tokens of\n‘cat’ are to be individuated on the basis of their being\nspelled ‘c’-‘a’-‘t’; and to (viii)\nthat we think something is a token of ‘cat’ when we see\nthat it is spelled ‘c’-‘a’-‘t’;\nand to (ii) that the word ‘cat’ itself is to be\nindividuated by its spelling; and to (i) that a word type is a\nsequence of letters—e.g. the word ‘cat’ just\nis the sequence of letters <‘c’,\n‘a’, ‘t’>; and to (iv) that we know about a\nparticular word, about what properties it has, by perceiving its\ntokens: it has all the properties that every one of its tokens has\n(except for properties types cannot have, e.g., being\nconcrete). \n\nThe advantage of starting with (iii) is that if there is some\nnontrivial property that all tokens of a word (in the sense indicated)\nhave in common, then perhaps we can use it to individuate the tokens,\nand also to get a handle on what the type is like and on how we know\nwhat the type is like. Unfortunately, it is not spelling, contrary to\nwhat many philosophers seem to think. Stebbing, e.g., considers the\ninscribed word a shape. But not even the linguist's much\nnarrower notion of an orthographic word (‘a visual sign\nwith a space around it’) requires a canonical spelling. We have\nseen that not all tokens of ‘color’ have the same\nspelling, even when they are spelled correctly, which they sometimes\nare not. Not all tokens are spelled at all—spoken tokens are\nnot. Moreover, two words can have the same spelling, as the noun\n‘color’ and verb ‘color’ prove, or to take a\ndifferent example, the noun ‘down’ from German meaning\n“the fine soft covering of fowls” and the different noun\n‘down’ from Celtic meaning \"open expanse of elevated\nland\". (They are not the same word with two senses, but different\nwords with different etymologies.)  Notice that even if, contrary to\nfact, all tokens of a word had the same spelling and we concluded that\nthe word type itself just is the sequence of letter types that compose\nit, we would have analyzed word types in terms of letter types, but\nsince we are wondering what types are in the first place, we would\nstill need an account of what letters are since they are types\ntoo. Providing one is surprisingly difficult.  Letters of the alphabet\nsuch as the letter ‘A’ are not just shapes, for\nexample, contrary to what is implicit in Stebbing 1935 and more\nexplicit in Goodman and Quine 1947, because Braille and Morse code\ntokens of the letter ‘A’ cannot be said to have “the\nsame shape”, and even standard inscriptions of the letter\n‘A’ do not have the same shape—in either a Euclidean\nor a topological sense—as these examples obtained from a few\nminutes in the library illustrate: \n\nMoreover, the letter ‘A’ has a long history and many of\nits earlier “forms” would not be recognizable to the modern\nreader. \n\nIf we switch instead to a phonemic analysis of words, as\nbeing more fundamental, similar problems arise. Not all tokens of a\nword are composed of the same phonemes, because some tokens\nare inscriptions. But even ignoring inscriptions, the example of the\ntwo ‘down’’s shows that neither can we identify a\nword with a sequence of phonemes. This particular difficulty might be\navoided if we identify a word with a phonemic analysis paired with a\nsense. But this is too strong; we saw earlier that the noun\n‘color’ has eighteen senses. Moreover,\n‘schedule’ has more than one phonemic analysis. A phoneme\nitself is a type with tokens, and so we'd also need an account of what\na phoneme is, and what its tokens have in common (if anything). Saying\nwhat a phoneme is promises to be at least as hard as saying what a\nletter is. Phonology, the study of phonemes, is distinct from\nphonetics, the scientific study of speech production. Phonetics is\nconcerned with the physical properties of sounds produced and is not\nlanguage relative. Phonemes, on the other hand, are language relative:\ntwo phonetically distinct speech tokens may be classified as tokens of\nthe same phoneme relative to one language, or as tokens of different\nphonemes relative to another language. Phonemes are theoretical\nentities, and abstract ones at that: they are sometimes said to be\nsets of features. The bottom line is that the\nphonological word is not the lexicographical one either. \n\nIt might be thought that we started at too abstract a level—that\nif we think there is a hierarchy of types of words, we started \"too\nhigh\" on the hierarchy and we should start lower on the\nhierarchy. That is, that we should first gather together those tokens\nthat are phonetically (and perhaps semantically) identical on\nthe grounds that this is a perfectly good notion of a\nword. But notice: this would mean that different dialects of\nthe same language would have far fewer \"words\" in common than one\nwould have supposed, and it would misclassify many words because, for\nexample, according to Fudge (1990, p. 39) a Cockney ‘know’\nis like the Queen's ‘now’; the Queen's ‘know’\nis like Scottish ‘now’; and a Yorkshire ‘know’\nis like the Queen's ‘gnaw’. Worse, even within the very\nsame idiolect it would distinguish as different \"words\" what one would\nhave thought were the same word. For example, the word\n‘extraordinary’ is variously pronounced with six, five,\nfour, three or even two syllables by speakers of British English.\nAccording to Fudge (1990, p. 40) it ranges \"for most British English\nspeakers from the hyper-careful\n['ekstrə'ʔɔ:dɪnərɪ] through the fairly\ncareful [ɪk'strɔ:dnrɪ] to the very colloquial\n['strɔ:nrɪ].\" That is, the very same person may use any of\nfive pronunciations for what should be considered the same word. Only\nan absolute diehard of this \"bottom-up\" approach would insist on\ndistinguishing as different words representations for the same\nidiolectal word. Not only would a phonologist take this as excessively\ncomplicated, but the representation types themselves can receive\nrealizations that are acoustically very different (for the small child\nand the man may speak the same idiolect). Fudge (1990, p. 31) assures\nus that \"It is very rare for two repetitions of an utterance to be\nexactly identical, even when spoken by the same person.\" Pretty soon,\neach word token would have to count as tokens of different\n\"words\". \n\nThe example of ['strɔ:nrι] demonstrates that there may be\nno phonetic signal in a token for every phoneme that is\nsupposed to compose the word: it is \"missing\" several syllables! This\nis also demonstrated by reflection on casual speech: [jeet?] for\n‘did you eat?’. No wonder, then, that many phoneticians\nhave given up on the attempt to reduce phonological types to\nacoustic/articulatory types. (See Bromberger and Halle 1986). Even the\nphysicalist Bjorn Lindblom (1986, p. 495) concedes that \"for a given\nlanguage there seems to be no unique set of acoustic properties that\nwill always be present in the production of a given unit (feature,\nphoneme, syllable) and that will reliably be found in all conceivable\ncontexts.\" \n\nHowever, the final nail in the coffin for the suggestion according to\nwhich all tokens of the same word have the \"same sound\" is that words\ncan be mispronounced. As Kaplan (1990) has argued, a word can suffer\nextreme mispronunciation and still be (a token of) the same word. He\nasks us to imagine a test subject, who faithfully repeats each word\nshe is told. After a time, we put filters on her that radically alter\nthe results of her efforts. Nonetheless, we would say she is saying\nthe word she hears. Kaplan concludes that differences in sound between\ntokens of the same word can be just about as great as we would\nlike. Notice that in such circumstances intention—what\nword the test subject intended to produce—is key. This suggests\nthat perhaps what all tokens of a word, say, ‘color’, have\nin common is that they were produced as the result of an intention to\nproduce a token of the word ‘color’. Unfortunately,\ncounterexamples are not hard to manufacture. (A clear phonemic example\nof ‘supercalifragilisticexpealadocious’ in English would\nprobably not count as a token of ‘color’, for example.)\nCounterexamples aside, it would be putting the cart before the horse\nto try to explain what the word ‘color’ is by appealing to\nthe intention to produce a token of the word ‘color’. It\nwould be like trying to explain what a fork is by appealing to the\nintention to produce a fork. Intentions are important in helping to\nidentify which type a token is a token of—question\n(viii)—but will not help us with what the type is—question\n(i)—and so I shall ignore them in what follows. \n\nThe upshot of all this is that there is no nontrivial, interesting,\n\"natural\", projectible property that all tokens of a word have in\ncommon, other than being tokens of that word (in the sense of\n‘word’ indicated). Tokens are all the same word, but they\nare not all the same. That is, the answer to (iii) is no. What then,\nof the other questions, (i)-(viii)? They become more difficult to\nanswer.  Wetzel (2002) attempts to answer them. The primary conclusion\nof Wetzel 2002 is that words are theoretical entities,\npostulated by and justified by linguistic theory. Words, in the sense\nindicated, are individuated by a number of variables, including\northography, phonology, etymology, grammatical function and\nsense(s). As for their tokens, they are apt to have some but not all\nof the properties of the type. And, as the story from Kaplan shows,\ntokens may even be quite deformed. These considerations impact\nsignificantly on the relation between types and their tokens,\ndiscussed in the next section, §5. \n\nThe relation between types and their tokens is obviously dependent on\nwhat a type is. If it is a set, as Quine (1987, p. 217) maintains, the\nrelation is class membership. If it is a kind, as\nWolterstorff maintains, the relation is kind-membership. If\nit is a law, as Peirce maintains, it is something else again, perhaps\nbeing used in accordance with. (Although Peirce also says a\ntoken is an “instance” of a type and that the token\nsignifies the type.) Nonetheless, it has often been taken to be the\nrelation of instantiation, or exemplification; a token is an\ninstance of a type; it exemplifies the type. (Not that every instance\nof a type is a token—e.g. capital ‘A’, small\n‘A’, and all the other types of ‘A’s tokened\nin the display in §4.2 above may be said to be instances of the\nletter ‘A’.) As with other universals, there are two\nversions of this relation, Platonic and Aristotelian. Although the two\nversions of property realism are discussed at length under this\nencyclopedia's entry for properties, a few remarks about the type\nversions are in order. \n\nAccording to Platonic versions of type realism, e.g., Bromberger 1989,\nHale 1990, Katz 1981 and Wetzel 2002, the type is an abstract object,\nnot located anywhere in space-time, although its tokens are.  This\nversion appears to give rise to serious epistemological\nproblems—we don't see or hear the type, it isn't located\nanywhere in space-time, so how do spatiotemporal creatures such as\nourselves know it exists, or what properties it has? Admittedly, we\nsee and hear tokens, but how are they a guide to what the type is\nlike? One answer, given for example, by Wolterstorff, for whom we saw\nin §4 that a type is a norm-kind, is that ordinary induction from\ntokens would give us knowledge of types, at least in the case of\ninstantiated types.  Bromberger (1992a, p.176) claims that linguists\n“often impute properties to types after observing and judging\nsome of their tokens and seem to do this in a principled way”\nand calls the principle that licenses this inference the Platonic\nRelationship Principle. More specifically, he proposes (1992a)\nthat the type, as the archetype of the quasi-natural kind which\ncomprises the tokens, has just those projectible properties that all\nthe tokens have. He has in mind properties such as the same underlying\nphonological structure, for words, and the same boiling point, for\nelements. \n\nHowever, as we saw in §4, generally there are no such properties\nhad by all and only tokens of a type, at least in the case of\nwords—not same phonological structure, nor same sense nor same\nspelling. Not all tokens have any such natural projectible property\n(except for the property of being tokens of the same\ntype). It should be clear from §4 that the cookie cutter\nmodel—the idea of the type as just a perceptible pattern for\nwhat all the tokens look like—does not work.  Goodman (1972,\npp. 437-8) follows Peirce in using the word ‘replica’ to\napply to all tokens of the same type, (although Peirce seemed to think\nthey were replicas of the type, whereas Goodman, being a nominalist,\ncannot think this) but not all tokens resemble each other in any\nordinary sense beyond being tokens of the same type (although of\ncourse some do). Goodman himself is clear about this, for he notes\nthere that “Similarity, ever ready to solve philosophical\nproblems and overcome obstacles, is a pretender, an impostor, a\nquack…. Similarity does not pick out inscriptions that are\n‘tokens of a common type’, or replicas of each other. Only\nour addiction to similarity deludes us into accepting similarity as\nthe basis for grouping inscriptions into the several letters, words,\nand so forth.” But others, e.g. Stebbing (1935, p. 6) and Hardie\n(1936), claim that all spoken tokens are more or less similar to each\nother. Because they are not, Wetzel (2002) and (2008) proposes that\nsince the only property all the tokens of a type generally share is\nbeing tokens of the type, one of the primary justifications for\npositing word types is that being a token of the word\n‘color,’ say, is the glue that binds the considerable\nvariety of space-time particulars together. The type is thus a very\nimportant theoretical object, whose function is to unify all the\ntokens as being “of the same type”; in accordance with the\nPlatonic Relationship Principle, the type has properties based on the\nproperties of some of its tokens, but in a complex\nway—in addition, the tokens have some of their\nproperties in virtue of what properties the type has. \n\nIn Aristotelian versions of exemplification, such as Wollheim 1968 and\nArmstrong 1978, the type has no independent existence apart from its\ntokens. It is “in” each and every one of its tokens, and\nso can be seen or heard just as the tokens can be. This avoids the\nepistemological problem mentioned in the preceding paragraph, but\nmakes it hard to explain how some types—such as very long\nsentences—can have no tokens. \n\nAs against instantiation of any sort, Stebbing (1935, p. 9) argues\nthat a token is not an instance of a type, because “the type is\na logical construction out of tokens having similarity or conventional\nassociation [as the inscribed word with the spoken]. It follows that\nthe type is logically dependent upon the tokens, in the sense that it\nis logically impossible to mention the type-word without using a\ntoken, and further, the meaning of the type has to be defined by\nreference to the tokens.” These claims are quite\ncontroversial. For example, it is clear one can refer to a type word\nwithout using a token of it—one can say “the word\na token of which is the first word on the page”. \n\nAnother alternative to exemplification is\nrepresentation. According to Szabo (1999, p. 150), types are\nabstract particulars, as with Platonic realism, but tokens\nrepresent their types, just as “paintings, photographs,\nmaps, numerals, hand gestures, traffic signs and horn signals”\nrepresent, or “stand for” their representata. A word token\nof ‘horse’ represents the word ‘horse’, which\nin turn represents horses. Just as a correct map of the planet can\nprovide us with knowledge of the planet, so too a token can provide us\nwith knowledge of properties of the type, thus addressing the\nepistemological problem. The representation view gives rise to a\nproblem however, for it turns out that what we have been calling word\ntokens aren't words at all on this view, anymore than a map of a\nplanet is a planet, and this runs contrary to our usual thinking. \n\nIt might seem that tokens are less problematic than types, being\nspatio-temporal particulars. But certain complications should be\nnoted.  (We continue to use linguistic examples, but the remarks hold\ntrue for tokens generally). \n\nSince types are usually thought to be universals, the debate over\nwhether they exist is as longstanding as the debate over universals,\nand debaters fall into the same camps. Realists say they do, as we saw\nin §5 which surveyed several varieties of realism. Realism's\ntraditional opponents were nominalists and\nconceptualists. Nominalists, who renounce universals and abstract\nobjects, say they don't.  (See, e.g., Goodman and Quine 1947, Quine\n1953, Goodman 1977 and Bromberger 1992b). Conceptualists argued that\nthere are no general things such as the species homo sapiens;\nthere are only general ideas—that is, ideas that apply\nto more than one thing. Applied to words, the thesis would be that\nwords are not abstract objects “out there”, but objects in\nthe mind.  Their existence then, would be contingent on having been\nthought of.  While this contingency may have a good deal of\nplausibility in the case of linguistic items, by itself conceptualism\nis just a stopgap measure on the issue of types and tokens\ngenerally. For ideas themselves are also either types or tokens (as\nevidenced by the fact that two people sometimes have the same\nidea). So either the conceptualist is proposing that types are idea\ntypes—which would be a species of realism—or she is\nproposing that there are no types, only mental idea particulars in\nparticular persons, which is a version of nominalism. Conceptualism,\ntherefore, will be ignored in what follows. \n\nRealism is the most natural view in the debate with nominalism,\nbecause as we saw in some detail in §2 type talk is\nubiquitous. That is, we talk as though there are types in philosophy,\nscience and everyday life. To say that we talk as though there are\ntypes is not to invoke the traditional argument for universals, which\nis that a sunset and a rose are both red, so they have something in\ncommon; and this something can only be the property of being\nred; so properties exist. Quine (1953) convinced many at\nmid-century that this traditional argument for universals, which\nrelies on predicates referring to something, fails. He objected that\n“the rose is red because the rose partakes of redness” is\nuninformative—we are no better off in terms of explanatory power\nwith such extra objects as redness than we are without them;\nperhaps a rose's being red and a sunset's being red are just brute\nfacts. Rather, to say we talk as though there are types is, as we saw\nin §2, to appeal to the fact that in our theories we frequently\nuse singular terms for types, and we quantify over them. As we saw,\nFrege emphasized that singular term usage is in indicator of\nobjecthood, and Quine stressed that we are ontologically\ncommitted to that over which we quantify.  Such considerations led\nQuine himself (1987, p. 217) to hold that expression types such as\n‘red’ exist, even while he denied that redness\ndoes. Since at least on the face of it we are committed to types in\nmany fields of inquiry, therefore, it is incumbent upon the nominalist\nto “analyze them away”. (Or to maintain that all theories\nwhich appear to refer to types are false—but this is a pretty\nradical approach, which will be ignored below.) \n\nRealism is not without its problems, as was noted in §5\nabove. Also favoring nominalism is Occam's principle which would have\nus prefer theories with fewer sorts of entities, other things being\nequal.  The main problem for nominalists is to account for our\napparent theoretical commitment to types, which, whatever types are,\nare not spatio-temporal particulars (according to nearly\neveryone). Traditional nominalists argued (as their name implies) that\nthere are no general things, there are only general words,\nand such words simply apply to more than one thing. But this is not a\nsolution to the current problem, presupposing as it does that there\nare word types—types are the problem. (Attempts to avoid this\nare given by Goodman and by Sellars; see below.) So-called class\nnominalists hold that a word type is just the class, or set, of its\ntokens. But this is unsatisfactory because, first, as we saw in\n§5, classes are ill-suited for the job, since classes have their\nmembership and their cardinality necessarily, but how many tokens a\ntype has is usually a contingent matter. (For the same reason,\nmereological sums of tokens are unsuited for the job of types, as they\nhave their parts essentially.) And second, classes are\nabstract objects too, so it is hard to see how this is really a form\nof nominalism about abstract objects at all. \n\nInitially more promising is the nominalistic claim that the surface\ngrammar of type talk is misleading, that talk of types is just\nshorthand for talk of tokens and is thus harmless. To say ‘The\nhorse is a mammal’ is just to say ‘All horses are\nmammals’; to say ‘The horse is a four-legged animal’\nis to say, as Frege himself (1977) suggested, ‘All properly\nconstituted horses are four-legged animals’. The idea is to\n“analyze away” apparent references to types by offering\ntranslations that are apparently type-free, and otherwise\nnominalistically acceptable. The problem is how to do this for each\nand every reference to or quantification over a type/types. Given the\nubiquity of such references/quantifications, only the procurement of\nsome sort of systematic procedure could assure us it can be done.\nHowever, chances of formulating a systematic procedure appear slight,\nin view of the following obstacles that would have to be overcome. \n\nI have been writing as though it were easy to pick out and quantify\nover tokens of a type without referring to the type. Sometimes it is:\n‘The horse…’— ‘All\nhorses…’. But this will not generally be the\ncase. Consider the noun ‘color’. The natural way to pick\nout its tokens is “all tokens of the noun\n‘color’”, but obviously this will not do as a\nnominalistic paraphrase, for it contains a reference to a\ntype. Goodman (1977) suggests a systematic way of paraphrasing and a\ngeneral procedure for substituting nominalistic paraphrases for\nlinguistic type-ridden sentences. In 1977 (p. 262) he claims that\n“any “ ‘Paris’ consists of five letters”\nis short for “Every ‘Paris’-inscription consists of\nfive letter-inscriptions” ”. The idea seems to be to\nreplace singular terms by predicates, which nominalists such as\nGoodman think carry no ontological commitment. So instead of “an\ninscription of ‘color’” write “a\n‘color’-inscription.” It seems pretty clear,\nhowever, that, based on the rules of quote-names for words, this\npredicate still retains a singular term for a type, the word\n‘color’ just as clearly as “a George W. Bush\nappearance” still contains a reference to Bush. That this is so\nis even more obvious in the case of “an ‘a cat is on the\nmat’-inscription”. So the question is how we might\nidentify these tokens grammatically but without referring to the noun\n‘color’ itself and still say something true and (in some\nappropriate sense) equivalent. Is there perhaps some other way of\nquantifying over tokens of a word, without referring to the word or to\nany other type? The fact that tokens are all “the same\ntype” suggests they are all “the same” somehow,\nwhich begets the idea that the type must embody certain\nsimilar features that all and only its tokens have, such as\nspelling, or sense, or phonological structure or some combination of\nthem. This is a beguiling idea, until one tries to find such a\nfeature, or features, amid the large variety of its tokens—even\nthe well-formed tokens. As we saw in §4, there is no such feature\n(consider again ‘color’ and ‘schedule’). They\ndemonstrate that e.g. neither same spelling, same sense, nor same\npronunciation prevail. In any event, such possible defining features\ninvolve reference to types: letter types in the spellings, phoneme\ntypes in the pronunciation. These too would have to be “analyzed\naway” in terms of quantifications over particulars. It might be\nthought that Sellars solved this problem by appealing to the notion of\na linguistic role, which Loux (1998, p. 79) defines as:\ntwo word (tokens) have the same linguistic role if they\n“function in the same way as responses to perceptual input; they\nenter into the same inference patterns; and they play the same role in\nguiding behavior”. It is dubious whether this notion can be\nunpacked without referring to abstract objects (same inference\npatterns?), but in any event it cannot be used to pick out all tokens\nof a word, as we have been using the word ‘word’. The\nreason is that ‘red’ and ‘rouge’ are different\nwords in our sense, but their tokens play the same linguistic role for\nSellars. \n\nBut even if expressions like “a\n‘color’-inscription” did not contain singular terms,\nGoodman's suggestion that whatever is true of the type is true of all\nthe tokens has two fatal defects. First, it would turn truths into\nfalsehoods. ‘Paris’ consists of five letters, as does\n‘color’, but not every ‘color’-inscription\nconsists of just five letter-inscriptions since some are spelled\n‘c’-‘o’-‘l’-‘o’-‘u’-‘r’.\n(As for denying that these are inscriptions of the word\n‘color’ see “Orthography” in §4 above.)\nIt doesn't even work for the word ‘Paris’, as it has the\nforms ‘Pareiss’ and ‘Parrys’ also. Second,\nGoodman's technique of replacing singular terms by predicates only\nworks if we are employing a realist semantics. That is, the key to his\nprogram is that for every word in the dictionary and every sentence in\nthe language there corresponds a unique predicate that is true of just\nthe tokens of that word/that sentence. (Without such predicates, true\nstatements apparently referring to types would be short for nothing at\nall.) But this is only plausible on a realist semantics. If\n‘predicate’ meant ‘predicate token’ there\nwould not even be enough predicates for every word in the dictionary,\nmuch less every sentence in the language. That is, it is certainly\nfalse that for every word α in the dictionary, there is an\nactual predicate token of the form ‘is an\nα-inscription’.  For more details on the problems with\nGoodman's strategy, see Wetzel (2000). \n\nSellars's suggestion is rather similar to Goodman's, and faces similar\ndifficulties, but is sufficiently different to be worth\nmentioning. Loux (1998, pp. 75-83), for one, argues that Sellars\n(1963) achieves the best nominalist account available by overcoming\ncritical objections to Carnap's “metalinguistic” account\nas follows. Carnap (1959, pp. 284-314) had suggested that all claims\ninvolving apparent reference to abstract objects, such as “Red\nis a color”, are systematically to be understood as\nmetalinguistic claims about the word involved (“The word\n‘red’ is a color predicate”). There are two obvious\nobjections to Carnap's suggestion. The first is that we still have\nword types being referred to; the second is that translation of\n“Red is a color” and “The word ‘red’ is\na color predicate” into French, say, will not result in\nsentences that are equivalent, since the latter (“Le mot\n‘red’ est un prédicat de coleur”) will still\nrefer to an English word, but the former will not. To counter the\nfirst objection, Sellars (1963, pp. 632-33) claims “the word\n‘red’” is a distributive singular term,\nwhich typically consists of ‘the’ followed by a common\nnoun that purports to name a kind—e.g., ‘the lion’\nin “The lion is tawny”—and that use of it results in\na generic claim that is about token lions, not the\ntype—“All lions are tawny”—since “The K\nis f” is logically equivalent to “All Ks are\nf”. Note that this is similar to Goodman's suggestion and as\nsuch is subject to the same criticism as is Goodman's: the two\nsentence forms said to be logically equivalent are not. See the second\nbullet point three paragraphs above.  Nor is there some other simple\nand straightforward logical equivalence that does the job; see the\nthird and fourth bullet points above. At best this is a suggestion\nthat some of the sentences in question—the ones that do not\ncontain “collective” predicates like\n‘extinct’—are logically equivalent to generic\nclaims—e.g. “Lions are tawny”—which are\ncapable of being true while admitting of exceptions. However, that\nthere is a uniform semantics (even a very complex one) for generic\nclaims, one moreover that “analyzes away” kind talk, is a\nstrong empirical claim about language, one that does not receive\nstrong support from current efforts to analyze generic claims. (See\nCarlson and Pelletier 1995.) \n\nTo counter the second objection (about non-equivalent translations)\nSellars suggests we introduce a new sort of quotation device, dot\nquotation, that would permit translation of the quoted word. Then,\ne.g.  “The word •red• is a color predicate”\ntranslates as “Le mot •rouge• est un prédicat\nde coleur”. The justification is that ‘red’ and\n‘rouge’ are functionally equivalent—they play the\nsame linguistic role. As mentioned above, this means that they have\nthe same causes (of perceptual stimuli, e.g.) and effects (conduct,\ne.g.) and function similarly in inferential transitions. Again,\nwhether Sellars can unpack the notion of “same linguistic\nrole” without appealing to any universals remains an open\nquestion. Less open is the question of how successful such an approach\nis to dealing with talk of words, e.g., “The word\n‘red’ consists of three letters”. If we apply\nSellars' analysis systematically, this becomes “”The word\n‘red’” consists of a three-lettered predicate”\nwhich is just false; if instead we reckon that “the word\n‘red’” is already a distributive singular term and\napply his analysis to it, getting “The word •red• is a\nthree-lettered predicate”, this then translates incorrectly as\n“Le mot •rouge• est un prédicat trois-en\nlettres”. If we stick instead with regular quotation, which\nresists translation, then we cannot appeal to “same linguistic\nrole” to say what class of things “the word\n‘red’” distributes over. In any event, Sellars's\naccount also faces the difficulty noted above with Goodman's account:\nit is only plausible on a realist semantics, because if\n‘predicate’ meant ‘predicate token’ there\nwould not even be enough predicates for every word in the dictionary,\nmuch less every sentence in the language. (For other problems with\nSellars's account, see Loux 1978: 81-85.) \n\nAs mentioned in §1 above, there is a related distinction that\nneeds to be mentioned in connection with the type-token\ndistinction. It is that between a thing, or type of thing, and (what\nis best called) an occurrence of it—where an occurrence\nis not necessarily a token. The reason the reader was asked above to\ncount the words in Stein's line in front of the reader's\neyes, was to ensure that tokens would be counted. Tokens are\nconcrete particulars; whether objects or events they have a unique\nspatio-temporal location.  Had the reader been asked to count the\nwords in Stein's line itself, the reader might still have correctly\nanswered either ‘three’ or ‘ten’. There are\nexactly three word types, but although there are ten word tokens in a\ntoken copy of the line, there aren't any tokens at all in the line\nitself. The line itself is an abstract type, as is the poem in which\nit first appeared.  Nor are there ten word types in the line, because\nas we just said it contains only the three word types,\n‘a,’ ‘is’ and ‘rose,’ each of\nwhich is unique. So what are there ten of? Occurrences of\nwords, as logicians say: three occurrences of the word (type)\n‘a,’ three of ‘is’ and four of\n‘rose’. Or, to put it in a more ontologically neutral\nfashion: the word ‘a’ occurs three times in the line,\n‘is’ three times and ‘rose’ four times.\nSimilarly, the variable ‘x’ occurs three times in the\nformula ‘∃x (Ax & Bx)’. \n\nNow this may seem impossible; how can one and the same thing occur\nmore than once without there being two tokens of it? Simons (1982)\nconcludes that it can't. Wetzel (1993) argues that it is useful to\ndistinguish objects from occurrences of them. For example, in the\nsequence of numbers <0,1,0,1> the very same number, the number\none, occurs twice, yet its first occurrence is distinct from its\nsecond. The notion of an occurrence of x in y involves not\nonly x and y, but also how x is situated in y. Even a\nconcrete object can occur more than once in a\nsequence—the same person occurs twice in the sequence of New\nJersey million dollar lottery winners, remarkably enough. If we think\nof an expression as a sequence, then the air of mystery over\nhow the same identical thing can occur twice vanishes. Does this mean\nthat, in addition to word types and word tokens, word occurrences must\nalso be recognized? Not necessarily; we can unpack the notion of an\noccurrence using “occurs in” if we have the notion of a\nsequence available; see Wetzel 1993 for details. \n\nThe need to distinguish tokens of types from occurrences of types\narises, not just in linguistics, but whenever types of things have\nother types of things occurring in them. There are 10,000 (or so)\nnotes in Beethoven's Sonate Pathétique, but there are\nonly 88 notes (types) the piano can produce. There are supposed to be\nfifty stars (types) in the current Old Glory (type), but the\nfive-pointed star (type) is unique. And what could it mean to say that\nthe very same atom (type), hydrogen, “occurs four times”\nin the methane molecule? Again, the perplexing thing is how the very\nsame thing can “occur” more than once, without there being\nmore than one token of it. Armstrong (1986), Lewis (1986a,b) and\nForrest (1986) called such types “structural universals”,\nwhich were the subject of a debate among the three. Armstrong and\nForrest defended Armstrong's (1978) view of universals against Lewis,\nwho delineated seven different views of structural universals\ncompatible with Armstrong's theory, and found all of them wanting.\nBasically, Lewis (1986a) assumed that there are two sorts of ways\nstructural universals might be constructed of simpler universals:\nset-theoretically and mereologically. He argued that set-theoretical\nconstructions resulted in ersatz universals, not universals worthy of\nthe name, and that the various mereological constructions just\nresulted in a heap of simpler universals, where there could not be\ntwo of the simpler universals. Wetzel (2008) argues that\nthere is a conception of a structural universal, the “occurrence\nconception”—which is an extension of the occurrence\nconception of expressions mentioned above—that escapes Lewis's\nobjections.","contact.mail":"wetzell@georgetown.edu","contact.domain":"georgetown.edu"}]
