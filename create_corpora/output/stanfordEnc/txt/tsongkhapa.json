In his iconic form, wearing a tall yellow hat, he is the\ncenter of the Gelugpa (Tib. dge lugs pa) sect that was\ndominant in Tibet until the Chinese takeover in 1951, and whose de\nfacto leader is the Dalai Lama.\n\n\nThe historical Tsongkhapa flourished in the period immediately\nfollowing the final redaction of the Buddhist canon in Tibetan\ntranslation (Tib. bKa' 'gyur, pronounced Kanjur). He\npropounds a distinctive Middle Way (Sk. madhyamaka, Tib.\ndbu ma pa) philosophy by differentiating between\nCandrakīrti's (fl. ca. 600) correct Consequentialist (Tib.\nthal 'gyur pa, Sk. *prāsaṅgika)\ninterpretation of the works of the Indian philosopher\nNāgārjuna (third-fourth century), and an incorrect\nAutonomist (Tib. rang rgyud pa, Sk.\n*svātantrika) interpretation by Bhāviveka (also\nknown as Bhavya and Bhāvaviveka, fl. ca. 550). He is strongly\ninfluenced by the Indo-Tibetan Buddhist logico-epistemological\ntradition (Sk. pramāṇa, Tib. tshad ma)\nfounded by the Indian epistemologists Dignāga and\nDharmakīrti (fifth to seventh century). Tsongkhapa strikes a\nbalance between knowledge and praxis. He says the emptiness of\nintrinsic existence (Sk. svabhāvaśūnyatā,\nTib. rang bzhin gyis stong pa nyid) is the ultimate truth\n(Sk. paramārtha-satya), and says even that is only true\nconventionally. At the same time he develops a hermeneutics to retain\nthe authority of correct moral statements on a covering (Sk.\nsaṃvṛti) or conventional (Sk.\nvyavahāra) level. His most influential writing\nreconciles the philosophy of emptiness with the imperative of praxis\nembodied in a universal altruistic principle (Sk.\nbodhicitta). He gives pride of place to apparently antinomian\ntantric praxis without devaluing the centrality of ordinary moral\nlife, and develops a distinctive analysis of dependent origination\n(Sk. pratītya-samutpāda) to support his assertion\nthat entities are both conventional and ultimate truths.\n\nBiographical information about Tsongkhapa comes from clues in his own\nwriting, and primarily from the hagiography written by his student\nKedrup Pelzangpo (mKhas grub dpal bzang po) (1385–1438)\ncalled Stream of Faith (Dad pa'i 'jug ngog) (partial\ntranslation in Thurman\n 1982).[1] \nTsongkhapa's life falls roughly into an earlier and later period. The\nlater period is defined by a series of publications, beginning in\nabout 1400, which systematically present his mature philosophy.\nTsongkhapa, influenced by the divisions used by the editors of the\nKanjur, treats non-tantric and tantric sources separately. His\nphilosophical views on tantra, and, to a certain extent his work on\nethics fall naturally into separate categories. The later period of\nhis life includes a period of institution building, possibly with an\neye to the founding of a new school or sect. \nThe name Tsongkhapa derives from Tsong kha, an ancient name for a part\nof the A mdo region of Greater Tibet (Bod chen) now included\nin Qinghai Province of the People's Republic of China, and the Tibetan\nsuffix pa that works as an agentive nominalizing particle.\nHis given name is Losang (sometimes written Lozang) Drakpa (bLo\nbzang grags pa). He is also known by the honorific title Je\nRinpoche (rJe rin po che) (“Precious Lord”). He\nwas born, probably to semi-nomadic farmers, in a settlement now\nincorporated into the outskirts of the Chinese city of Xi ning. His\nbirthplace is marked by the popular Kumbum (sKu 'bum)\nmonastery, \nIn his teens (1372–73), Tsongkhapa travelled from Tsong kha to\nCentral (dBus) Tibet (Bod) where he remained until\nhis death in 1419. He arrived as a young man in Central Tibet at the\nend of a long flowering of intellectual activity called “the\nlater diffusion [of Buddhism]” (Tib. spyi dar) that\nbegan with translator Rin chen bzang po (958–1055) and the\nscholar-saint Dīpaṃkāra-śrījñāna\nAtiśa (980–1054), and ended with the most important editor\nof the Kanjur, Butön (Bu ston Rin chen grub),\n(1290–1364). \nAccording to Kedrup, on his arrival in Central Tibet Tsongkhapa first\nstudied Tibetan medicine, then a traditional Buddhist curriculum of\nabhidharma, tenet systems (Tib. grub mtha') focusing\non the Middle Way and Mind Only (Sk. cittamātra also\ncalled yogācāra) philosophy, Buddhist ethics (Tib.\nsdom gsum), and epistemology (Sk.\npramāṇa). His early studies were pursued mainly in\ninstitutions affiliated with the two dominant scholarly traditions\n(Tib. lugs) of the time: the Sangphu (gSang phu ne'u\ntog) tradition founded by Ngok (rNgog bLo ldan shes rab)\n(1059–1109), and the Sakya (Sa skya) epistemological\ntradition based primarily on the works of the Sa skya\npaṇḍi ta (1182–1251). He also studied and practiced\ntantric Buddhism. \nIn his early years he wrote a number of essays on topics in\nabhidharma (Apple 2008), a detailed investigation of the\nālaya-vijñāna (Sk.) (“foundation,\nstorehouse, basis-of all consciousness”) (Sparham 1993), and an\nimportant treatise, Golden Garland (Legs bshad gser\nphreng), on the Perfection of Wisdom (Sk.\nprajñā-pāramitā) literature based on\nthe codification of its topics in the Ornament for the Clear\nRealizations (Abhisamayālaṃkāra)\n(Sparham 2007–2013). \nAfter completing his Golden Garland in 1388–89,\nTsongkhapa spent a period of some ten years removed from the hub of\nintellectual activity. He engaged in meditation and ritual religious\nexercises in Southern Tibet (Lho kha) where, as evidenced in\nhis short autobiographical writing from this transitional period\n(Thurman 1982), and corroborated by traditional sources (Kaschewsky\n1971, Vostrikov 1970), he resorted to a communion or dialogue with\nMañjuśrī––the iconographic representation\nof perfect knowledge in the Buddhist pantheon. Through the voice of\nMañjuśrī he articulated a hierarchical system of\nphilosophies culminating in what he characterized as a pristine,\nMiddle Way, *Prāsaṅgika-madhyamaka (Tib. dBu ma thal\n'gyur pa) that avoided over-reification (of the absolute) and\nover-negation (of the conventional). \nTsongkhapa framed his insights not as original contributions, but as a\nrediscovery of meanings already revealed by the Buddha. In all his\nworks he characterizes his philosophy as identical to the Buddha's.\nFurther, he says his philosophy is based on Nāgārjuna's and\nNāgārjuna's follower Āryadeva's (third-fourth century)\nexplanation of what the Buddha said. His philosophy gets its name\n*Prāsaṅgika (“those who reveal the unwelcome\nconsequences [inherent in other's assertions]”) from the\nimportance it gives to Buddhapālita's (late fifth century)\nexplication of Nāgārjuna's work, and to Candrakīrti's\ndefense of Buddhapālita's explanation, in the face of criticism\nby Bhāviveka. \nTsongkhapa presented his mature philosophy in a series of volumes\nduring the later period of his life, beginning with the publication of\nhis most famous work, the Great Exposition of the Stages of the\nPath (Lam rim chen mo) in 1402, at the age of 46. This\nwas followed by Essence of Eloquence (Legs bshad snying\npo) and Ocean of Reasoning (Rigs pa'i rgya\nmtsho) (1407–1408), the Medium-Length Exposition of the\nStages of the Path (Lam rim 'bring) in 1415, and, in the\nlast years of his life, his Elucidation of the Intention\n(dGongs pa rab gsal). \nTogether, in this series of works written over a seventeen year\nperiod, he succeeded in setting the agenda for the following\ncenturies, to a great extent, with later writers taking positions pro\nand con his arguments. As is so often the case, his stature pushed\nmuch of earlier Tibetan intellectual history into the shadows, until\nits rediscovery by the Eclectic Movement (Tib. Ris med) in\nDerge (sDe dge) in the late 18th century. \nTsongkhapa wrote his major works on tantra and ethics at the same time\nas his major philosophical works. Volumes 3–12 of his collected\nworks in 18 or 19 volumes deal exclusively with topics based on\ntantric sources. In 1405 he completed his Great Exposition of\nTantra (sNgags rim chen mo) (Hopkins 1980, Yarnall 2013)\na companion volume to his Great Exposition, where, in harmony\nwith his philosophy, he argued that tantra is defined neither by\nspecial insight (Sk. vipaśyana) or Mahāyāna\naltruism (Sk. bodhicitta), but solely by deity yoga (Tib.\nlha'i rnal 'byor) (Hopkins 1980). \nIn 1402, Tsongkhapa, with his teacher Rendawa (Red mda' ba gzhon\nnu blo gros), (1349–1412) (Roloff 2009) and others, at the\ntemple of Namstedeng (rNam rtsed ldeng/lding)\nconvened a gathering of monks with the intention of reinvigorating the\nBuddhist order. From this came Tsongkhapa's short, but influential\nworks on basic Buddhist morality (Sk. prātimokṣa)\nthat in turn laid the foundation for the importance some Gelukpa\nmonasteries would place on a stricter adherence to the monastic code.\nIn 1403 his influential works on ethical codes for bodhisattvas\n(Byang chub gzhung lam) (Tatz 1987) and for tantric\npractitioners (rTsa ltung rnam bshad) (Sparham 2005)\nappeared. His separate explanations of the three ethical codes (Tib.\nsdom gsum) are distinguished by the centrality they give to\nbasic morality, the importance the bodhisattva's code retains in\ntantra, and in the antinomian tantras the presence of a separate\nprātimokṣa-like ordination ritual built around a\ncodification of of ethical conduct specific to tantric\npractitioners. \nBy 1409, at the age of 52, his place in Tibetan society was\nsufficiently established that he could garner the support and\nsponsorship necessary for a successful rejuvenation of the central\ntemple in Lhasa, for establishing a new-year prayer festival (smon\nlam chen mo), and for completion of a large new monastery, Ganden\n(dGa' ldan), where he lived for much of his subsequent life\nuntil his death there in 1419. He inspired two of his students Tashi\nPalden (bKra shis dpal ldan) (1379–1449) and Shakya\nYeshey (Ye shes) (1354–1435) to found Drepung ('Bras\nspungs) monastery in 1416, and Sera Monastery in 1419, respectively.\nThese, with Ganden, would later become the three largest and most\npowerful Gelukpa monasteries, and indeed, the biggest monasteries in\nthe world. In 1407 and 1413 the Ming dynasty Yongle Emperor recognized\nTsongkhapa's growing fame and importance by inviting him to the\nChinese court, as was the custom. \nTsongkhapa's most important works from his early period are his\nExplanation of the Difficult Points (Kun gzhi dka'\n'grel) and Golden Garland (Legs bshad gser\nphreng). \nIn the former he gives a detailed explanation of the\nālaya-vijñāna (“foundation\nconsciousness”)––according to Tsongkhapa the\ndistinctive eighth consciousness in the eight-consciousness system of\nAsaṅga's (fourth century) Indian Yogācāra\nBuddhism. \nTsongkhapa opens his work with a brief discussion of the relationship\nbetween the views of Nāgārjuna and Asaṅga. Tsongkhapa\nthen discovers in the different usages of the term\nālaya-vijñāna and its near synonyms a\nnegative connotation conveying the cause and effect nature of repeated\nsuffering existences (Sk. saṃsāra). He surveys the\nrelevant literature, limiting his discussion of gotra\n(“lineage,” in the sense of the innate ability a person\nhas to grow up into a fully enlightened being) to the presentation\ngiven in Asaṅga's Bodhisattva Levels\n(Bodhisattva-bhūmi). There the “residual\nimpression left by listening [to the correct exposition of the\ntruth]” (Sk. śruta-vāsanā) is the\n“seed” (Sk. bīja) that matures into\nenlightenment. It is little more than the innate clarity of mind when\nit is freed from limitation by habituation to a correct vision of\nreality. \nTsongkhapa limits the sources for his explanation to non-tantric\nworks, almost all by persons he will later describe as Indian\nYogācāra writers, demonstrating thereby the influence the\ncategories used in the recently redacted Kanjur and Tenjur (Tib.\nbsTan 'gyur, the name for the commentaries in Tibetan\ntranslation included in the canon) had on his thinking. \nWhen Tsongkhapa arrived in Central Tibet, the pressing philosophical\nissue of the day was Dolpopa's (Dol po pa Shes rab rgyal\nmtshan) (1292–1361) Great Middle Way (Tib. dBu ma chen\npo, Sk. *Mahā-madhayamaka) philosophy. It\npropounded a hermeneutics based on the principle that a Buddha will\nalways tell you clearly what he means. Based on a wide array of\nsources, and without making a clear distinction between tantric and\nnon-tantric works, the central tenet of the Great Middle Way is that\nan absolute, pure, transcendental mind endowed with all good qualities\nexists radically other than the ordinary world of appearance. It is\nthe archetypical Tibetan Buddhist gzhan stong (pronounced\nshentong, “emptiness of other”) philosophy. \nDolpopa, stressing the hermeneutic stated above, says\nNāgārjuna and Asaṅga, writing during the golden age,\nhave the same philosophy, the Great Middle Way clearly articulated by\nthe Buddha. Dolpopa distinguishes a pure, transcendental knowledge\n(Tib. kun gzhi ye shes) that is quite other than the defiled\nfoundation consciousness (Tib. kun gzhi rnam shes), and\nequates the former with his single absolute, endowed with all the\nqualities of a Buddha. \nLater, in his mature period, as explained below, Tsongkhapa will be\nexplicit. He will state categorically that Asaṅga's\nYogācāra Buddhism is quite separate from, and in profundity\ninferior to, Nāgārjuna's Middle Way school (Wangchuk 2013),\nremoving all references to a Great Middle Way school. He will say the\nālaya-vijñāna, devoid of subject-object\nbifurcation, provides the essential mind-stuff for defilement\n(=saṃsāra) and carries seeds for purification\n(=nirvāṇa) in a Yogācāra system that is\nfundamentally wrong, and at odds with the way things actually are. He\nwill give the ālaya-vijñāna only a heuristic\nvalue, and say a correct view (the *Prāsaṅgika-madhyamaka\nview) of the workings of psycho-physical reality (the Buddhist\nskandhas) totally invalidates it. As Jeffrey Hopkins (2002,\n2006b) has shown conclusively, such statements constitute an explicit\nrejection of Dolpopa's view, a position Tsongkhapa still is\nformulating in early works like the Explanation of the Difficult\nPoints. \nIn his Explanation of the Difficult Points, Tsongkhapa is\ncertain he does not accept the view of Dolpopa, but he is still unsure\nexactly what he will put in its place. He ignores Dolpopa's pure,\ntranscendental knowledge called ālaya, mentioning it\nobliquely, only in passing, during a final brief survey of views based\non Chinese sources; he leaves unanswered the question of the final\nontological status of the eighth consciousness, but appears to accept\nit as having a provisional reality; and he allows the views of\nAsaṅga set forth in the Bodhisattva-bhūmi to\nretain an authority he will later explicitly deny. \nTsongkhapa's Golden Garland is his most important early work.\nIt takes the form of a long explanation of the Perfection of\nWisdom sūtras, given pride of place in the Kanjur as the\nforemost words of the Buddha, after the Vinaya section (the\ncodifications of ethical conduct). It is a word-by-word commentary on\nthe topics in the Ornament for the Clear Realizations\n(Abhisamayālaṃkāra). Tsongkhapa bases his\nexplanation on two sub-commentaries by Ārya Vimuktisena (sixth\ncentury?) and Hari Bhadra (end of the eighth century). It propounds a\nphilosophy that later Gelukpas, following the taxonomy developed in\nthe mature works of Tsongkhapa, call\nYogācāra-svātantrika-madhyamaka, in essence a Middle\nWay that incorporates many of the categories of Yogācāra\nBuddhism, yet does not have the authority of Candrakīrti's\nPrāsaṅgika interpretation. \nA great deal has been written on the difference between\nPrāsaṅgika and Svātantrika (Dreyfus and McClintock\n2003). Historically, the Gelukpa's\nYogācāra-svātantrika-madhyamaka is another name for the\nmainstream philosophical school that developed in Tibet, based\nprimarily on the teaching of Śāntarakṣita and his\nstudent Kamalaśīla (both fl. end of the eight century), the\nmost influential of all the Indian paṇḍitas involved in\nthe dissemination of Buddhist ideas to Tibet. Later Gelukpa\nscholastics, basing themselves on the mature works of Tsongkhapa, are\nunequivocal that Yogācāra-svātantrika-madhyamaka, like\nthe Yogācāra philosophy of Asaṅga, is wrong, and has\nonly heuristic value. At the same time, they tacitly acknowledge its\ncentrality by taking this “wrong” philosophy as the\nfoundation of their studies. \nIn the Golden Garland, Tsongkhapa, following\nŚāntarakṣita's school as it developed in Tibet,\nasserts that all bases (Sk. vastu) (the psycho-physical\nfactors locating the person as they begin their philosophical career),\nall mental states along the course of the path (Sk.\nmārga), and the final result, are illusory, because they\nlack any essential nature. But it is not yet clear how the basis\nrelates to the final outcome (the result). As explained below,\nTsongkhapa will solve the problem in his mature works by a clear,\nradical, nihilistic leap denying any essential nature whatsoever,\nanywhere, to anything, thereby implicitly and explicitly devaluing (in\nabsolutist terms) the ontological status of the final, pure, unified\nstate, relegating it to just one more conventional,\ndependently-originated thing. \nIn the Golden Garland, Tsongkhapa has not yet fully developed\nhis mature, systematic philosophy. He is still content with\ndiscrediting Dolpopa and surveying different points of view. He uses\nYogācāra terminology to present his own opinion, and uses a\nlanguage to describe enlightened (and enlightening) knowledge that\nretains for it a separateness (through its freedom from all mental\nconstruction) from all other mental states. The primary object of\nphilosophical inquiry in the Golden Garland is the unity of\nthe perceiving subject in enlightenment, a topic that reflects the\nlanguage and concerns of the\nYogācāra-svātantrika-madhyamaka school.  \nTsongkhapa in this early work is still comfortable with characterizing\nthe ultimate as an absence of elaboration (Tib. spros bral,\nSk. niṣprapañca) beyond the four extremes, later\nset forth as the orthodox view of the Sakya sect. Tsongkhapa's\nrejection of this characterization in his later work occasions a\nstrong rejection of his view by writers like Gorampa (Go rab\n'byams pa bsod nams sge ge) (1429-1489) (Cabezon and Dargyay\n2006). \nThe Golden Garland is driven in no small measure by an agenda\ndedicated to discrediting Dolpopa's Perfection of Wisdom\ncommentaries. This is evident from a comparison of Dolpopa and\nTsongkhapa's sources and views. While Dolpopa excoriates Ārya\nVimuktisena and Hari Bhadra and says they belong to the degenerate\nage, propounding doctrines harmful to golden age Buddhism, the\nGolden Garland privileges the commentaries by Ārya\nVimuktisena and Hari Bhadra. Dolpopa says the two Detailed\nExplanations of the Perfection of Wisdom Sūtras (Sk.\nBṛhaṭṭīkā, Tib. Gnod\n'jom) by “the foremost, Great Middle Way master\nVasubandhu” stand as the primary scriptural authority for the\nGreat Middle Way doctrine, superior even to the partial truths\nrevealed by Nāgārjuna. The Golden Garland disputes\nthat Vasubandhu is the author of the two Detailed\nExplanations, and says, regardless of their author, they are\nsimply restatements of Nāgārjuna's Middle Way. Finally,\nDolpopa propounds a doctrine that holds the basis, path, and result\nare eternally the same, and all else is thoroughly imaginary, but the\nGolden Garland is certain that such a view is wrong, and\ndirectly cites a passage from Dolpopa's work, though without naming\nits author, saying, “since no other great path-breaker, [i.e.,\nfounder of an original philosophy] besides him has ever asserted [what\nDolpopa says], learned persons are right to cast out [what he says]\nlike a gob of spit” (Sparham 2007-2013 vol. 1, 425). \nTsongkhapa formulated the philosophy for which he is best known some\nten years after finishing the Golden Garland. He\ncharacterized the vision that led him to his philosophy as a pristine\nMiddle Way. Reflecting back on his insight he would write in his\nIn Praise of Dependent Origination (brTen 'brel bstod\npa) (translation by Tupten Jinpa, undated) \n“Nonetheless, before the stream of this life\n\nFlowing towards death has come to cease\n\nThat I have found slight faith in you—\n\nEven this I think is fortunate.\n\nAmong teachers, the teacher of dependent origination,\n\nAmongst wisdoms, the knowledge of dependent origination—\n\nYou, who're most excellent like the kings in the worlds,\n\nKnow this perfectly well, not others.” \nTsongkhapa first sets forth this mature philosophy linking dependent\norigination and emptiness in a special section at the end of his\nGreat Exposition. There, in the context of an investigation\ninto the end-product of an authentic, intellectual investigation into\nthe truly real (Sk. tattva, Tib. de kho na), and\ninto the way things finally are at their deepest level (Sk.\ntathatā, Tib. de bzhin\n nyid),[2]\n he says you have to identify the object of negation (Tib. dgag\nbya), i.e., the last false projection to appear as reality, by\navoiding two errors: going too far (Tib. khyab che ba) and\nnot going far enough (Tib. khyab chung ba) (Drefus et al,\n2011, chapter 5). \nThat his project does not presuppose a privileged, soul-like, state of\nconsciousness that surveys and categorizes phenomena is evident from\nhis assertion that these two errors originate in a latent\npsychological tendency in philosophers: first, to hold on to vestiges\nof truth (reality) where there is in fact an absence of it, and\nsecond, to fall back on some version of truth (reality) in ordinary\nappearance after failing to avoid nihilism in a futile quest for\nmeaning. \nThis section of Tsongkhapa's work is based on the opening verse of\nNāgārjuna's Root Verses on the Middle Way\n(Mūla-madhyamaka-kārikā). Tsongkhapa's\nOcean of Reasoning (Garfield and Samten 2006) is a detailed\nexegesis of this work. In it, Nāgārjuna says nothing is\nproduced because it is not produced from itself, other, both or\nneither. In Tsongkhapa's Great Exposition, the subject of\nNāgārjuna's syllogism is primarily the embodied person,\nreflecting the trend that runs throughout Buddhist philosophical\nliterature, in general, to stress the application of philosophical\nanalysis to praxis. Furthermore, for Tsongkhapa, Nāgārjuna's\nstatement is about a first moment in the continuum of the\ninvestigating person. By implication, reflecting the continuing\ninfluence of Śāntarakṣita, it is the person engaged in\nthe philosophical investigation in the immediate moment. It is\naxiomatic for Buddhist philosophers that there is no independent\nsubject (soul) other than the five heaps (skandhas), so the\nsubject of the syllogism becomes the complex or continuum of\nsense-faculties in the present instant. Such a subject makes\nexcellence sense of Tsongkhapa's otherwise confusing juxtaposition of\nNāgārjuna's analysis with Dharmakīrti's epistemology,\nin which it is axiomatic that direct sense perception is an\nauthoritative means of knowledge (Sk.\npramāṇa). \nNāgārjuna's statement that such a person was never produced\nseems paradoxical, to say the least, because it appears to undercut\nthe reality of the very intellectual act in which the thinker is\nself-evidently engaged. Tsongkhapa makes it abundantly clear that in\nhis view not only is the intellectual act itself utterly devoid of any\nessential reality, even the sense-faculties (the complex eye, ear and\nso on) also lack any essential reality, never mind the sense data they\nconvey to the knowing individual. \nTsongkhapa's choice of the opening line's of Nāgārjuna's\nwork as a point of departure for his philosophy stems from his belief\nthat he has gained a true insight into dependent origination\n(pratītya-samutpāda). This insight, he believes,\nresolves the paradox between his apparent nihilism and his insistence\non the weight of authoritative statements and cognitions. Thus he says\nin his Great Exposition, \n“Therefore, the intelligent should develop an unshakeable\ncertainty that the very meaning of emptiness is\ndependent-arising… Specifically, this is the subtle point\nthat the noble Nāgārjuna and his spiritual son Āryadeva\nhad in mind and upon which the master Buddhapālita and the\nglorious Candrakīrti gave fully comprehensive commentary. This is\nhow dependent-arising bestows certain knowledge of the absence of\nintrinsic existence; this is how it dawns on you that it is things\nwhich are devoid of intrinsic existence that are causes and\neffects” (Lamrim Chenmo Translation Committee Vol. 3, 139). \nTsongkhapa set out the ramifications of his view in “eight\npoints that are difficult to understand” (Tib. dka' gnas\nbrgyad) first enumerated in notes (rjes byang) to one of\nhis lectures by his contemporary and disciple, Darma rin chen (also\ncalled rGyal tshab rje “the regent”). Tillemans\n(1998) has nicely rendered the opening of the text as follows, \n“Concerning the [ontological] bases, there are the following\n[three points]: (1) the conventional nonacceptance of particulars and\nof (2) the storehouse consciousness, and (3) the acceptance of\nexternal objects. Concerning the path, there are the following [four\npoints]: (4) the nonacceptance of autonomous reasonings as being means\nfor understanding reality and (5) the nonacceptance of self-awareness;\n(6) the way in which the two obscurations exist; (7) how it is\naccepted that the Buddha's disciples and those who become awakened\nwithout a Buddha's help realize that things are without any\nown-nature. Concerning the result, there is: (8) the way in which the\nbuddhas know [conventional] things in their full extent.\nThus, there are four accepted theses and four unaccepted\ntheses.”  \nThey have been discussed by a number of writers (Ruegg 2002, Cabezon\n1992, 397, Cabezon and Dargyay 2006, 76-93, 114-201). \nI have surveyed Tsongkhapa's early work on the\nālaya-vijñāna (Tilleman's “storehouse\nconsciousness”) above. For Tsongkhapa, until the correct view is\nunderstood, it is necessary to assert the\nālaya-vijñāna in order to save cause and\neffect, and avoid falling into nihilism. When the correct view is\nobtained, the ālaya-vijñāna stands\ninvalidated (Tillemans's second point). For Tsongkhapa, it is only\npossible to understand cause and effect (in particular, as experienced\nin the immediate moment by an embodied person), by correctly\nunderstanding that dependent origination precludes any essential\nexistence whatsoever. \nTsongkhapa asserts that a specific mark (Sk.\nsva-lakṣaṇa), for instance a mark that makes blue\nblue, instead of red or any other color, has not even a nominal\nexistence. This is the first of Tillemans's eight difficult\npoints. \nIn his monograph Essence of Eloquence, Tsongkhapa employs a\nhermeneutics that treats language and knowledge as equally semiotic in\nnature. This is consistent with Tsongkhapa's view that any\nintellectual act is itself utterly devoid of any essential reality,\nyet functions on a conventional level through the natural workings of\ndependent origination (Sk. dharmatā). This view allows\nhim to conclude that Dignāga and Dharmakīrti's\nLogico-epistemological school is equivalent to Asaṅga's\nYogācāra school insofar as the former school asserts a\nspecific mark, seen by direct sense perception, that is necessary in\norder to retain the reality of the conventional world. Tsongkhapa\ntakes the strong position that no datum that appears to (or is there\nbut unknown to) thought or sense perception, has any essential\nreality. All are, equally, simply labeled by thought construction\n(Tib. rtog pas btags tsam). Only convention makes the actual\nsense-faculties, for example, real, and success or failure experienced\nin a dream, for example, false. This dependent origination (between a\nlabel and what is labeled) precludes the essential existence implicit\nin the Epistemologist's sva-lakṣaṇa. \nTsongkhapa's strong rejection of Yogācāra idealism leads him\nto assert the existence of external objects (the third point). His\n(discredited) Yogācāra school, based on either the works of\nAsaṅga or the Epistemologists, explains the absence of\nsubject-object bifurcation as non-dual with thought or mind (Sk.\ncitta). Realizing this in a non-conceptual, meditational\nstate constitutes a liberating vision. Ultimately, therefore, external\nobjects are projections of a deluded mind. Tsongkhapa rejects this,\nthough he suggests only those who have understood the emptiness of\ninherent existence through reflecting on the natural workings of\ndependent origination can set it aside. As he says in his Ocean of\nReasoning, \n“The meaning of the statement that the conventional designation\nof subject and objects stops is that the designation of these two\nstops from the perspective of meditative equipoise, but it does not\nmean that the insight in meditative equipoise and the ultimate truth\nare rejected as subject and object. This is because their being\nsubject and object is not posited from the perspective of analytic\ninsight, but from the perspective of conventional understanding”\n(Garfield and Samten 2006, p. 26).  \nFrom the perspective of ordinary convention there are external\nobjects, so it is sufficient, on that level, to assert that they are\nthere. \nTsongkhapa does not accept svātantra\n(“autonomous”) reasoning (the fourth point). He asserts\nthat it is enough, when proving that any given subject is empty of\nintrinsic existence, to lead the interlocutor, through reasoning, to\nthe unwelcome consequences (prasaṅga) in their own\nuntenable position; it is not necessary to demonstrate the thesis\nbased on reasoning that presupposes any sort of intrinsic\n(=autonomous) existence. This gives Tsongkhapa's philosophy its name\n*Prāsaṅgika-madhyamaka, i.e., a philosophy of a middle way\n(between nihilism and eternalism) arrived at through demonstrating the\nunwelcome consequences (in any given position that presupposes\nintrinsic existence). \nIn the context of this assertion, Tsongkhapa offers a distinctive\nexplanation of the well-known Nayāyika objection to\nNāgārjuna's philosophy, namely, if the statements he uses to\nprove his thesis are themselves without any final intrinsic reality,\nthey will be ineffective as proofs. Tsongkhapa says\nPrāsaṅgika-madhyamakas do not simply find faults in all\npositions and reject all positions as their own. They only deny any\nthesis that presupposes an intrinsic existence. They do hold a\nspecific thesis, to wit, that all phenomena lack an intrinsic\nexistence. They use reasoning and logic that lacks any essential\nreality to establish this thesis. Such reasoning derives its\nefficacity on a conventional level through the natural workings of\ndependent origination. This is one of the most contentious assertions\nof Tsongkhapa. \nTsongkhapa's rejection of any form of self-referential consciousness\n(Sk. sva-saṃvitti, sva-saṃvedana) (the\nfifth point) is in essence a rejection of\nŚāntarakṣita's position that such self-referential or\nreflexive awareness is necessary to explain the self-evidential nature\nof consciousness, and to explain the privileged access the conscious\nperson has to their own consciousness as immediate and veridical\n(Garfield\n 2006).[3]\n At issue is the status of the knowing subject engaged in the\nintellectual pursuit of the truly real. Tsongkhapa holds that such a\nknowing subject has no essential reality at all. \nSuch a position requires of Tsongkhapa an explanation of memory. His\nsolution is to deny that when you remember seeing object X\nyou also remember the conscious act of seeing it. (Were you to do so,\nthere would have to be an aspect of the earlier consciousness of the\nobject that was equally conscious of itself, i.e., self-referential.)\nInstead, Tsongkhapa argues, memory is simply the earlier consciousness\nof object X, now designated “past.” When\ndesignated past, inexorably (or inferentially, as it were) the\npresence of a consciousness of the past object X is required\nto make sense of the present reality. \nTsongkhapa characterizes basic ignorance (Sk. avidyā),\nthe root cause of suffering in Buddhist philosophy, not as a latent\ntendency, but as an active defiling agency (Sk.\nkleśāvaraṇa) that projects a reality onto\nobjects that is in fact absent from them. This ignorance affects even\nsense perception and explains the veridical aspect that is, in fact,\njust error. The residual impressions left by distortion (literally\n“perfumings” Sk. vāsanā) explain the\nmere appearance of things as real. Beyond that, he asserts that\nhabituation to this distortion prevents conventional and ultimate\nreality from appearing united in an appearing object. This explanation\nof the psychology of error differs markedly from earlier Tibetan\nexplanations and constitutes the sixth difficult point. \nIn Tsongkhapa's mature philosophy the Mahāyāna altruistic\nprinciple (bodhicitta) is the sole criterion for\ndistinguishing authentic Mahāyāna views and practices from\nnon-Mahāyāna ones. By privileging the principle in this way\nhe is able to assert that any authentic realization of truth is a\nrealization of the way things are, namely, a realization of no\nsva-bhāva (Sk.) (“own-being, own-nature, intrinsic\nidentity”). For Tsongkhapa, therefore, Hīnayānists (by\nwhich he intends followers of the basic Buddhist doctrine of the Four\nNoble Truths set forth in the earliest scriptures), necessarily have\nthe same authentic knowledge of reality. Were they not to have such\nknowledge, he argues, they could not have reached the goals they\nreached (the seventh point). \nFinally, Tsongkhapa has a robust explanation of the difference between\ntrue and false on the covering or conventional level. He denies any\ndifference between a false object (a dream lottery ticket, for\nexample) and a real one; as appearances, he asserts, both are equally\nfalse, only convention decides which is true. All phenomena equally\nlack truth. In Tsongkhapa's mature philosophy, therefore, all\nappearance is false––to appear is to appear as being truly\nwhat the appearance is of, and the principle of dependent origination\nprecludes such truth from according with the way things actually\nare. \nTsongkhapa holds that sentences and their content and minds and what\nappears to them function in the same way. Saying (1) of a set of\n“true” and “false” statements that they are\nall equally untrue, and (2) saying of unmediated sense-based\nperception or mistaken ideas that they are equally untrue is to say\nthe same thing. The truth in both is decided by convention, not by\nsomething inhering in the true statement (or its content), or the\nvalid perception (or its object). For Tsongkhapa, therefore, since all\nappearance is false, the Buddha knows, but without any appearance of\ntruth (the eighth difficult point). \nTowards the very end of his life, in his Medium-Length Exposition\nof the Path and Elucidation of the Intention Tsongkhapa\ndefends his views against Rongtön's (rong stong shes bya kun\nrig) (1367-1449) criticism that his earlier and later works are\ninconsistent. Tsongkhapa extends his comparison of Candrakīrti's\nand Bhāviveka's interpretations of Nāgārjuna to more\nclearly identify a less subtle object of negation in the works of\nYogācāra-svātantrika-madhyamaka writers, particularly\nJñānagarbha (8th century) and Śāntarakṣita\n(Hopkins 2008, Part One, Yi 2015). Tsongkhapa finds in their works an\nanalysis leading beyond the Yogācāra's mere absence of a\nsubstantial difference between known object and knowing subject, but\nlimited insofar as it negates the ultimate truth of all objects\nappearing to conventional awareness while still allowing room for an\nobject of negation that does not appear to sense perception.  \nDreyfus et al (2011) and Falls (2010) suggest parallels between the\nissues raised by the Svātantrika–Prāsaṅgika\ndifference and some recent work in Western philosophy. They are\nhelpful for those familar with Western philosophy but unfamiliar with\nTsongkhapa, surveying questions that arise from the interaction of\nphilosophical traditions from different cultures. Falls argues\nTsongkhapa's philosophy is a therapeutea not a theoria and draws\nparallels between issues raised by Tsongkhapa and John McDowell's\ninterpretation of Wilfrid Sellars in particular.  \nA distinctive feature of Tsongkhapa's mature philosophy is the\ncentrality he accords hermeneutics, and the particular stratification\nof philosophical systems it occasions. His focus on hermeneutics stems\nin no small measure from his acceptance of the Kanjur as a true record\nof authentic statements of the Buddha, and also from his wish to\ndiscredit Dolpopa's views. According to Tsongkhapa, and worked out in\ndetail in his Essence of Eloquence, the given record of the\nBuddha's diverse statements seems to contain contradictions, so a\nreader must decide on criteria for interpreting them. No statement of\nthe Buddha can serve as a primary hermeneutic principle, so that\nprinciple necessarily becomes human reason (Sk. yukti, Tib.\nrigs pa). \nWhen human reason is brought to bear on the diverse statements of the\nBuddha, it concludes that all statements that an essential or\nintrinsic identity exists, or any statements that presupposes that,\ncannot be taken literally, at face value. This is because human\nreason, when it analyzes the ultimate truth of any object or\nstatement, finds it empty of anything intrinsic to it that would make\nit true. For Tsongkhapa, the line of reasoning that leads most clearly\nto this conclusion is dependent origination. \nStatements that require interpretation Tsongkhapa groups into those of\ndifferent Buddhist philosophical schools: in ascending order, Listener\n(Sk. Śrāvaka) schools based on older Buddhist\nsources (the Vaibhāṣika and Sautrāntika),\nYogācāra schools following Asaṅga and\nDignāga/Dharmakīrti, and non-Prāsaṅgika\nMadhyamaka schools following Bhāviveka and\nŚāntarakṣita. The Prāsaṅgika-madhyamaka\nschool of Candrakīrti alone captures the final intention of the\nBuddha. Tsongkhapa was certainly not the first doxographer, but his\nclear and definitive categories had immense influence on later\nwriters, so much so they have anachronistically been read back into\nworks that were written before his time. \nTsongkhapa's particular hermeneutics, the primary means he employs to\nlead readers to his philosophical insight, allows him to characterize\nparticular, authentic, Buddhist philosophies as wrong (because they\nare wrong from a Prāsaṅgika perspective), yet right from\nthe perspective of those particular systems. They are right because\nthe philosophies have particular roles to play in a larger, grander\nscheme. This scheme is part of the larger philosophy of a perfect\nperson whose views are in perfect accord (Sk. tathāgata)\nwith the way things are, i.e., dependently originated, and whose\nstatements are motivated solely by the benefit they have to those who\nhear them. \nIn this way, Tsongkhapa's hermeneutics lead to, or incorporate, a\nsecond principle, namely, bodhicitta (Sk.). The word\nbodhicitta has at least six different, but interrelated\nmeanings in different contexts (Wangchuk 2007). In his philosophical\nworks Tsongkhapa uses it to mean a universal, altruistic principle\n(not unlike the logos) that explains, primarily, the genesis\nof the Buddha's diverse statements, i.e., explains why a person with\nperfect intellect and powers of expression would make statements that\nseem to contain contradictions. \nThis principle plays a central role in Tsongkhapa's assertion that all\nauthentic attainments, without distinction, are based on an authentic\ninsight into emptiness (the seventh of the eight difficult points\nlisted above), and it leads him to assert that the\n“origin” of the Mahāyāna is located in\nbodhicitta, and bodhicitta alone \nTsongkhapa is part of a long, shared, Indo-Tibetan Buddhist tradition\nthat conceives of ethical conduct not in absolute terms, but in the\ncontext of different individuals in different situations. There is an\nunspoken presupposition that ethical statements are grounded in\nreality, in the sense that suffering (Sk. duḥkha) comes\nfrom actions (Sk. karma) that are not in accord with the way\nthings actually are (Tib. dngos po'i gnas lugs). The person\nis ultimately not present as an ethical subject, but is so, on a\nconventional or covering level, through the natural working of\ndependent origination. \nTsongkhapa groups such individuals into three separate categories\n(those who privilege basic Buddhist codes, bodhisattvas, and\ntāntrikas). Each is governed by an ethical code (Tib. sdom\ngsum), each superior code subsuming the points of the lesser.\nBeyond these three, his Great Exposition suggests ordinary\nethical conduct is codified as well, in the main, in the ten ethical\npoints (Sk. daśa-kuśala-patha) basic to any human\nlife that rises above the mere animal. \nThe first of the three specifically Buddhist codes, the basic code,\nprimarily governs the behavior of monks and nuns. Since for Tsongkhapa\neach higher code incorporates all the rules in the lower code, he\nconceives of the seven (or even twelve) sub-codes making up the basic\ncode as, in descending order, containing fewer and fewer of the rules\nthat constitute the full code. Each of the sub-codes is designed for\nparticular people in particular human situations. Tsongkhapa does not\nexpect a butcher to be governed by the rule of not killing, for\nexample, and he does not expect a lawyer to be governed by the rule of\nnot lying. He avoids gross devaluation of the basic code by\nprivileging spiritual elites. In this, he takes a pragmatic approach\nto ethics in line with his non-absolutist stance. For Tsongkhapa, it\nis axiomatic that human life is not ipso facto privileged\nabove any other form of life, but his detailed explanation gives\ngreater “weight” to the karmic retribution that comes from\nkilling humans, and amongst humans, noble persons, for example, than\nless fortunate forms of life. \nTsongkhapa's explanation of the bodhisattva moral code presented in\nthe Bodhisattva-bhūmi (Tatz 1987) follows naturally from\nthe importance he gives to the altruistic principle\n(bodhicitta) in his other writing. He reconciles rules in the\nbodhisattva code that enjoin behavior contradicting the basic code by\npositing an elite that, through a noblesse oblige of the\nspiritually advanced, are required to do things which would be\nunethical in an ordinary person. Their not doing so constitutes an\nethical lapse. For example, the basic code prohibits actions that\ninfluence what food a donor puts in the begging bowl (with a few\nexceptions for human flesh and so on), and prohibits eating after\nnoon. The bodhisattva code contradicts the basic code insofar as it\nprohibits eating meat, even though, by so doing, the donor does not\nget the opportunity to make charity. Tsongkhapa argues that if a monk\nat the bodhisattva stage of development eats meat it clashes with the\ndictates of the altruistic principle (bodhicitta). \nTsongkhapa accepts that the diverse body of literature, including the\nhistorically latest Buddhist tantras (some of which are distinctly\nantinomian in character), are the work of a fully awakened being (Sk.\nbuddha). The last of the three codes systematizes the conduct\nespoused in these tantras. Tsongkhapa's presentation is distinctive\nfor finding a code complete with a full ordination ceremony. The\npractical result of his presentation is to revalue the basic code for\nmonks, and devalue the ritual of tantric consecration as it pertains\nto ethical conduct. It stresses ethical conduct even in the context of\nworks that appear, in line with the nihilistic drift of Buddhist\nphilosophy, to count ethical codes as a block to the highest spiritual\nand philosophical attainment. \nFor Tsongkhapa the tantric code is only for the very highest spiritual\nelite, mainly monks and nuns. Tsongkhapa divides tantras into two\nsections, and says the lower section is governed exclusively by the\nbodhisattva code, supplemented by specific ritual injunctions (Sk.\nvrata). He gives two interpretations of the rules for the\nhigher tantras, reserving the truly antinomian behavior for a\ntheoretical elite whose altruism is so strong, and whose understanding\nand status is so ennobled, that they engage in what ordinarily would\nbe condemned as gross immorality. According to this code, it is an\nethical lapse not to eat meat, perhaps even human flesh, the logic\nbeing that in certain specific and unusual circumstances, in a person\nat this stage of development, such behavior would constitute a\nskillful means to benefit others. \nTsongkhapa does not have a different tantric philosophy. His\nPrāsaṅgika Middle Way is the philosophical position he\narticulates in his works on tantra. He does however, unlike in his\nnon-tantric works, accept that those propounding Idealistic\nphilosophies (Yogācāra, Svātantrika Middle Way) can\nhave success in their practice. In this he reveals again the\nimportance of the central Tibetan philosophical tradition going back\nto Śāntarakṣita. \nTsongkhapa conceives of tantra as a subset of the Mahāyāna,\nand to that extent all authentic Buddhist tantric activities are,\nnecessarily, authentically altruistic. What differentiates tantric\nactivity from other ordinary Mahāyāna activities is deity\nyoga (Tib. lha'i rnal 'byor), i.e., whether or not, from a\nfirst person perspective, the person is acting as a perfect,\n“divine” subject when engaging in (primarily ritual)\nbehavior. \nTsongkhapa wrote works on the Vajrabhairava,\nCakrasaṃvara (Gray 2017), and Kālacakra\ntantras, but is best known for his exposition of the\nGuhyasamāja tantra based on Indian commentaries\nassociated with the names of Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva,\nparticularly his short but influential Commentary on the\nJñāna-vajra-samuccaya (Ye shes rdo rje kun las\n‘dus pa'i ṭī kā) (1410), and magisterial\nClear Exposition of the Five Stages of Guhyasamāja\n(gSang ‘dus rim lnga gsal sgron) (1411) (Thurman 2011,\nKilty 2013). He accords great importance to esoteric yoga. In this\nrespect, his work is firmly located in the mainstream Tibetan\ntradition, influenced in particular by the translator Mar pa (Mar pa\nChos kyi blo gros) (1012–1097), who spread the Six Teachings\nof Nāropa (Nā ro chos drug), a later Indian\nsynthesis of diverse tantric practices, in Tibet. Based on this\nTsongkhapa gives detailed explanations of the\nnāḍī (channels for the energy or feelings\nthat run through the tantric practitioner's body), cakra\n(circles of channels in the heart, throat, and other central points up\nthe center of the body from the bottom of the spine, or tip of the sex\norgan, to the top of the head) and caṇḍalī\n(an intense pleasure experienced as heat that spreads through the\nchannels and fills the body). Tsongkhapa is praised, in particular,\nfor his explanation of theory and praxis associated with the illusory\nbody (Sk. māyā-kāya, Tib. sgyu lus)\nand clear light (Sk. prabhāsvara, Tib. 'od\ngsal), a skillful adaptation of his understanding of the two\ntruths to yogic praxis (Natanya 2017). This is summed up nicely in the\nstatement, “The\nPañcakramasaṃgrahaprakāśa (Illumination of\nthe Summary of the Five Steps), a short treatise attributed to\nNāropa (956–1040), combining the Six Teachings with the\n‘Five Steps’ (pañcakrama) of the Ārya\ntradition provided Tsong kha pa with the basic ideas of his Tantric\nsystem” (Tillemans 1998).
