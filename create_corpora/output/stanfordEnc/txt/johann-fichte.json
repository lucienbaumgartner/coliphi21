He was the eldest son in a family of poor\nand pious ribbon weavers. His extraordinary intellectual talent soon\nbrought him to the attention of a local baron, who sponsored his\neducation, first in the home of a local pastor, then at the famous\nPforta boarding school, and finally at the universities of Jena and\nLeipzig. With the death of his patron, Fichte was forced to discontinue\nhis studies and seek his livelihood as a private tutor, a profession he\nquickly came to detest. \n\nFollowing a lengthy sojourn in Zurich, were he met his future wife,\nJohanna Rahn, Fichte returned to Leipzig with the intention of\npursuing a literary career. When his projects failed, he was again\nforced to survive as a tutor. It was in this capacity that he began\ngiving lessons on the Kantian philosophy in the summer of 1790. This\nfirst encounter with Kant’s writings produced what Fichte himself\ndescribed as a “revolution” in his manner of\nthinking. Whereas he had formally been torn between, on the one hand,\na practical commitment to the moral improvement of humanity and, on\nthe other, a theoretical commitment to “intelligible\nfatalism,” he found in the Critical philosophy a way of\nreconciling his “head” and “heart” in a system\nthat could meet the highest intellectual standards without requiring\nhim to sacrifice his belief in human freedom. \n\nFichte eventually made his way to Königsberg, where he lived\nfor a few months. After a disappointing interview with Kant, he\nresolved to demonstrate his mastery of the latter’s philosophy by\nwriting a treatise on a theme as yet unaddressed by Kant: namely, the\nquestion of the compatibility of the Critical philosophy with any\nconcept of divine revelation. In a few weeks Fichte composed a\nremarkable manuscript in which he concluded that the only revelation\nconsistent with the Critical philosophy is the moral law itself. Kant\nwas sufficiently impressed by the talent of this unknown and\nimpoverished young man to offer to arrange for the publication of\nFichte’s manuscript, which was published by Kant’s own publisher in\n1792 under the title Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation.\nThe first edition of this work, however, for reasons that have never\nbeen satisfactorily explained, appeared without the author’s name and\npreface and was quickly and widely hailed as a work by Kant himself.\nWhen the true identity of its author was revealed, Fichte was\nimmediately catapulted from total obscurity to philosophical\ncelebrity. \n\nMeanwhile, Fichte was once again employed as a private tutor, this\ntime on an estate near Danzig, where he wrote several, anonymously\npublished political tracts. The first of these was published in 1793\nwith the provocative title Reclamation of the Freedom of Thought\nfrom the Princes of Europe, who have hitherto Suppressed it. In\nthe summer of 1793 Fichte returned to Zurich where he married his\nfiancé and oversaw the publication of the first two installments\nof his spirited Contribution to the Rectification of the Public’s\nJudgment of the French Revolution (1793 and 1794). In this work he\nnot only defended the principles (if not all the practices) of the\nFrench revolutionaries, but also attempted to outline his own\ndemocratic view of legitimate state authority and insisted on the right\nof revolution. Despite the fact that these political writings were\npublished anonymously, the author’s identity was widely known, and\nFichte thereby acquired a reputation, not wholly deserved, as a radical\n“Jacobin.” \n\nFollowing the completion of these projects, Fichte devoted his time in\nZurich to rethinking and revising his own philosophical\nposition. While maintaining his allegiance to the new Critical or\nKantian philosophy, Fichte was powerfully impressed by the efforts of\nK. L. Reinhold to provide the Critical philosophy with a new, more\nsecure “foundation” and to base the entire system upon a\nsingle “first principle.” At the same time, he became\nacquainted with the works of two authors who were engaged in skeptical\nattacks upon the philosophies of both Kant and Reinhold: Solomon\nMaimon and G. E.  Schulze (“Aenesidemus”). It was the need to\nrespond to the sharp criticisms of these authors that eventually led\nFichte to construct his own, unique version of transcendental\nidealism, for which, in the spring of 1794, he eventually coined the\nname Wissenschaftslehre (“Doctrine of Science” or\n“Theory of Scientific Knowledge”). During the winter of 1793/94\nhe composed a long manuscript, “Private Mediations on Elementary\nPhilosophy/Pracical Philosophy,” in which worked out some of the\nfundamental features of his new system.  In Feburary and March of 1794\nhe gave a series of private lectures on his conception of philosophy\nbefore a small circle of influential clerics and intellectuals in\nZurich. \n\nIt was at this moment that he received an invitation to assume the\nrecently vacated chair of Critical Philosophy at the University of\nJena, which was rapidly emerging as the capital of the new German\nphilosophy. Fichte arrived in Jena in May of 1794, and enjoyed\ntremendous popular success there for the next six years, during which\ntime he laid the foundations and developed the first systematic\narticulations of his new system. Even as he was engaged in this\nimmense theoretical labor, he also tried to address a larger, popular\naudience and also threw himself into various practical efforts to\nreform university life. As one bemused colleague observed, “his\nis a restless spirit; he thirsts for some opportunity to act in the\nworld. Fichte wants to employ his philosophy to guide the spirit of\nhis age.” Indeed, a passionate desire to “have an\neffect” upon his own age remained a central feature of Fichte’s\ncharacter, most notably expressed a decade later in his celebrated\nAddresses to the German Nation, delivered in Berlin in 1806\nduring the French occupation. In Jena, this same desire is reflected\nin the enormously popular series of public lectures on “Morality\nfor Scholars,” which he began to deliver immediately upon his\narrival in Jena. The first five of these lectures were published in\n1794 under the title Some Lectures concerning the Scholar’s\nVocation. \n\nThough Fichte has already hinted at his new philosophical position in\nhis 1794 review of G. E. Schulze’s Aenesidemus, the first\nfull-scale public announcement of the same came in a short manifesto\nthat he published as a means of introducing himself to his new\nstudents and colleagues at Jena and attracting listeners to his\nlectures. (As an “extraordinary professor,” Fichte was largely\ndependent upon fees paid by students attending his “private”\nlectures.) This manifesto, Concerning the Concept of the\nWissenschaftslehre (1794), articulated some of the basic ideas of\nthe new philosophy, but it mainly focused upon questions of systematic\nform and the relationship between philosophy and its proper object\n(the necessary actions of the human mind). \n\nFichte’s first truly systematic work was his Foundation of the\nEntire Wissenschaftslehre (1794/95). As the title implies, this\nwork, which remains to this day Fichte’s best-known philosophical\ntreatise, was not meant to be a presentation of his entire system, but\nonly of the rudiments or first principles of the same. In fact, Fichte\nhad not originally intended to publish this work at all, which was\nwritten less than a year after his first tentative efforts to\narticulate for himself his new conception of transcendental philosophy.\nThe Foundation was originally intended to be distributed, in\nfascicles, to students attending his private lectures during his first\ntwo semesters at Jena, where the printed sheets could be subjected to\nanalysis and questions and supplemented with oral explanations. Because\nof the great interest in Fichte’s new philosophy, however, he soon\nauthorized a public edition of the same, in two volumes. Parts I and II\nof the Foundation were published in 1794 and Part II in 1795.\nIn 1795 he also published a substantial supplement to the\nFoundation, under the title Outline of the Distinctive\nCharacter of the Wissenschaftslehre with Respect to the Theoretical\nFaculty. The title pages of all three of these publications,\nhowever, still stipulated that they were intended only as “a manuscript\nfor the use of his listeners.” (When, in 1802, Fichte issued a second,\none-volume edition of the Foundation and Outline, in\n1801, this subtitle was dropped.) \n\nDissatisfied with many features of his initial presentation of the\n“foundational” portion of his system and shocked by the\nvirtually universal misunderstanding of his published\nFoundation, Fichte immediately set to work on an entirely new\nexposition of the same, which he repeated three times in his private\nlectures on “The Foundations of Transcendental Philosophy\n(Wissenschaftslehre) nova methodo” (1796/76, 1797/98,\n1798/99). Though he intended to revise these lectures for serial\npublication under the title An Attempt a New Presentation of the\nWissenschaftslehre in the Philosophisches Journal einer\nGesellschaft Teutscher Gelehrten, of which he himself was by then\nco-editor, only the two Introductions to and the first chapter of this\n“New Presentation” ever appeared (1797/98). \n\nEven as he was thoroughly revising his presentation of the\nfoundational portion of his system, Fichte was simultaneously engaged\nin elaborating the various subdivisions or systematic branches of the\nsame. As was his custom, he did this first in his private lectures and\nthen in published texts based upon the same. The first such extension\nwas into the realm of philosophy of law and social philosophy, which\nresulted in the publication Foundations of Natural Right in\naccordance with the Principles of the Wissenschaftslehre\n(published in two volumes in 1796 and 1797). The second extension was\ninto the realm of moral philosophy, which resulted in the publication\nof the System of Ethics in accordance with the Principles of the\nWissenschaftslehre (1798). Fichte then planned to extend his\nsystem into the realm of philosophy of religion. Indeed, he announced\nlectures on this topic for the Spring Semester of 1799, but before he\ncould commence these lectures, his career at Jena had come to an\nabrupt and unhappy conclusion in the wake of the so-called “Atheism\nControversy” of 1798/99. \n\nIn 1798 Fichte published in his Philosophical Journal a brief\nessay “On the Basis of Our Belief in a Divine Governance of the\nWorld,” in which he attempted to sketch some of his preliminary\nideas on the topic indicated in the title and simultaneously to give\nthe first clear public hint of the character of a philosophy of\nreligion “in accordance with the principles of the\nWissenschaftslehre.” The occasion for this essay was\nanother essay, published in the same issue of the Philosophical\nJournal, by K. L. Forberg. As it happened, these two essays\nprovoked an anonymous author to publish a pamphlet charging the\nauthors of both essays with atheism and demanding Fichte’s dismissal\nfrom his post at Jena. The matter quickly escalated into a major\npublic controversy which eventually led to the official suppression of\nthe offending issue of the journal and to public threats by various\nGerman princes to prevent their students from enrolling at the\nUniversity of Jena. The crisis produced by these actions and the\ngrowing number of publications for and against Fichte—which\nincluded an intemperate Appeal to the Public by Fichte\nhimself (1799), as well as a more thoughtful response entitled\n“From a Private Letter” (1799)—eventually provoked\nF. H. Jacobi to publish his famous “open letter” to\nFichte, in which he equated philosophy in general and Fichte’s\ntranscendental philosophy in particular with “nihilism.”\nAs the public controversy unfolded, Fichte badly miscalculated his own\nposition and was finally forced to resign his position at Jena and to\nflee to Berlin, where he arrived in the summer of 1799. \n\nAt this point, the Prussian capital had no university of its own, and\nFichte was forced to support himself by giving private tutorials and\nlectures on the Wissenschaftslehre and by a new flurry of\nliterary production, increasingly aimed at a large, popular audience.\nThe first of these “popular” writings was a brilliant\npresentation of some of the characteristic doctrines and conclusions\nof Fichte’s system, with a strong emphasis upon the moral and\nreligious character of the same. This work, The Vocation of\nMan (1800), which is perhaps Fichte’s greatest literary\nachievements, was intended as an indirect response to Jacobi’s public\nrepudiation of the Wissenschaftslehre. That same year also\nsaw the publication of a typically bold foray into political economy,\nThe Closed Commercial State, in which Fichte propounds a\ncurious blend of socialist political ideas and autarkic economic\nprinciples. Defending his philosophy against misunderstanding\nremained, however, Fichte’s chief concern during this period, as is\nevidenced by the more direct response to Jacobi contained in his\npoignantly titled Sun-Clear Report to the Public at Large\nconcerning the Actual Character of the latest Philosophy: An Attempt\nto Force the Reader to Understand (1801). \n\nAt the same time that he was addressing the public in this manner,\nFichte was becoming ever more deeply engrossed in efforts to rethink\nand to rearticulate the very foundations of his system, beginning with\nhis private lectures on the Wissenschaftslehre of 1801/2, and\nculminating in the three, radically new versions of the same produced\nduring the year 1804. Indeed, he continued to produce new versions of\nthe Wissenschaftslehre right up until his death, delivering\nnew versions of his system in 1805, 1807, 1810, 1811, 1812, 1813, and\n1814 (though the last two versions were cut short, the first by the\nwar with France and the second by Fichte’s death). However, with the\nsingle exception of the extraordinarily condensed (and extraordinarily\nopaque) Presentation of the General Outlines of the\nWissenschaftslehre (1810), none of these later versions of the\nWissenschaftslehre was published during Fichte’s lifetime.\nSome of them appeared, in severely edited form, in the collection of\nFichte’s Works published by his son several decades following\nhis death, but most of them are only now being published for the first\ntime in the critical edition of Fichte’s writings produced by the\nBavarian Academy of the Sciences. It appears that Fichte was so\ndiscouraged by the public reception of the first, 1794/95 presentation\nof the foundation of his system that he concluded that it was prudent\nto limit future new presentations of the same to the lecture hall and\nseminar room, where he could elicit reactions and objections from his\nlisteners and respond immediately with the requisite corrections and\nclarifications. Be that as it may, Fichte never stopped trying to\nrefine his philosophical insights and to revise his systematic\npresentation of the same. Thus there are more than a dozen different\nfull-scale presentations or versions of the\nWissenschaftslehre, most of which were written after his\ndeparture from Jena. “The Wissenschaftslehre” is\nnot the name of a book; it is the name of a system of\nphilosophy, one capable of being expounded in a variety of\ndifferent ways. Despite the striking differences between the earlier\nand later versions of his lectures on the foundations of his system,\nFichte always insisted that the “spirit” of the same\nremained unaltered—a claim that continues to be challenged and\ndebated by Fichte scholars. \n\nIn 1805 Fichte spend a semester as a professor at the University of\nErlangen, but returned to Berlin in the fall of that year. The next\nyear, 1806, he published in rapid succession three popular and\nwell-received books, all of which were based upon earlier series of\npublic lectures that he had delivered in Berlin: On the Essence of\nthe Scholar (a reworking of some of the same themes first\naddressed in the similarly titled lectures of 1794); The\nCharacteristics of the Present Age (an attempt to show the\nimplications of his “system of freedom” for a speculative\nphilosophy of history); and Guide to the Blessed Life, or the\nDoctrine of Religion (an eloquent and somewhat mystically tinged\ntreatise on the relationship between transcendental philosophy and\ngenuine religion). Taken together, these three “popular”\nworks are remarkable blends of speculative profundity and rhetorical\neloquence. \n\nWith the entry of the French army of occupation into Berlin in 1806,\nFichte joined the Prussian government in exile in Königsberg,\nwhere he delivered yet another course of lectures on the\nWissenschaftslehre and wrote an important short book on\nMachiavelli as Author (1807), which defends a form of\nRealpolitik that at least appears to contrast quite starkly\nwith the liberalism and political idealism of Fichte’s earlier\npolitical writings. Fichte soon returned to occupied Berlin, however,\nwhere, in the winter of 1807/8, he delivered his celebrated\nAddresses to the German Nation (published in 1808). Though\nthese lectures later obtained a place of dubious honor as founding\ndocuments in the history of German nationalism, they are mainly\nconcerned with the issue of national identity (and particularly with\nthe relationship between language and nationality) and the question of\nnational education (which is the main topic of the work)—both\nof which are understood by Fichte as means toward a larger,\ncosmopolitan end. \n\nFichte had always had a lively interest in pedagogical issues and\nassumed a leading role in planning the new Prussian university to be\nestablished in Berlin (though his own detailed plans for the same were\neventually rejected in favor of those put forward by Wilhelm von\nHumboldt). When the new university finally opened in 1810, Fichte was\nthe first head of the philosophical faculty as well as the first\nelected rector of the university. His final years saw no diminishment\nin the pace either of his public activity or of his philosophical\nefforts. He continued to produce new lectures on the foundations and\nfirst principles of his system, as well as new introductory lectures\non philosophy in general (“Logic and Philosophy” [1812]\nand “The Facts of Consciousness” [1813]), political\nphilosophy (“System of the Doctrine of Right” [1812] and\n“Doctrine of the State” [1813]) and ethics (“System\nof Ethical Theory” [1812]). As presaged perhaps by his earlier\nbook on Machiavelli, these late forays into the domain of practical\nphilosophy betray a darker view of human nature and defend a more\nauthoritarian view of the state than anything to be found in Fichte’s\nearlier writings on these subject. \n\nIn 1813 Fichte canceled his lectures so that his students could enlist\nin the “War of Liberation” against Napoleon, of which\nFichte himself proved to be an indirect casualty. From his wife, who\nwas serving as a volunteer nurse in a Berlin military hospital, he\ncontracted a fatal infection of which he died on January 29,\n1814. Almost to the moment of his death he continued his lifelong\nefforts to rethink and to re-examine the basic foundations and\nsystematic implications of his philosophy, as is rather poignantly\nreflected in the remarkable philosophical “Diary” in which\nhe recorded his thoughts during this final period. \n\nThe primary task of Fichte’s system of philosophy (the\nWissenschaftslehre) is to reconcile freedom with necessity,\nor, more specifically, to explain how freely willing, morally\nresponsible agents can at the same time be considered part of a world\nof causally conditioned material objects in space and time. Fichte’s\nstrategy for answering this question—at least in his early\nwritings, which are the ones upon which his historical reputation as a\nphilosopher has (at least until recently) been grounded and hence are\nthe ones to be expounded here—was to begin simply with the\nungrounded assertion of the subjective spontaneity and freedom\n(infinity) of the I and then to proceed to a transcendental derivation\nof objective necessity and limitation (finitude) as a condition\nnecessary for the possibility of the former. This is the meaning of\nhis description, in his “First Introduction to the\nWissenschaftslehre,” of philosophy’s task as that of\n“displaying the foundation of experience” or\n“explaining the basis of the system of representations\naccompanied by a feeling of necessity.” Fichte derived this\nconception of the task and strategy of philosophy from his study of\nKant, and no matter how far his own system seemed to diverge from\n“the letter” of the Critical philosophy, Fichte always\nmaintained that it remained true to “the spirit” of the\nsame. Central to this “spirit,” for Fichte, is an\nuncompromising insistence upon the practical certainty of human\nfreedom and a thoroughgoing commitment to the task of providing a\ntranscendental account of ordinary experience that could explain the\nobjectivity and necessity of theoretical reason (cognition) in a\nmanner consistent with the practical affirmation of human\nliberty. Though Fichte attributed the discovery of this task to Kant,\nhe believed that it was first accomplished successfully only in the\nWissenschaftslehre, which he therefore described as the first\n“system of human freedom.” \n\nIn an effort to clarify the task and method of transcendental\nphilosophy, Fichte insisted upon the sharp distinction between the\n“standpoint” of natural consciousness (which it is the\ntask of philosophy to “derive,” and hence to\n“explain”) and that of transcendental reflection, which is\nthe standpoint required of the philosopher. He thus insisted that\nthere is no conflict between transcendental idealism and the\ncommonsense realism of everyday life.  On the contrary, the whole\npoint of the former is to demonstrate the necessity and unavailability\nof the latter. \n\nHowever “Kantian” in spirit Fichte’s enterprise might have\nbeen, he was at the same time all too keenly aware of what he\nconsidered to be certain glaring weaknesses and inadequacies in Kant’s\nown execution of this project. Taking to heart the criticisms of such\ncontemporaries as F. H. Jacobi, Salomon Maimon, and G. E. Schulze,\nFichte propounded a radically revised version of the Critical\nphilosophy. First of all, he argued that the very concept of a\n“thing in itself,” understood as a mind-independent,\nexternal “cause” of sensations, is indefensible on\nCritical grounds. In addition, he maintained that Kant’s denial of the\npossibility of “intellectual intuition,” though certainly\njustified as a denial of the possibility of any non-sensory awareness\nof external objects, is nevertheless difficult to reconcile with\ncertain other Kantian doctrines regarding the I’s immediate presence\nto itself both as a (theoretically) cognizing subject (the doctrine of\nthe transcendental apperception) and as a (practically) striving moral\nagent (the doctrine of the categorical imperative). \n\nHis study of the writings of K. L. Reinhold convinced Fichte that the\nsystematic unity of the Critical philosophy—specifically, the\nunity of theoretical and practical reason, of the First and Second\nCritiques—was insufficiently evident in Kant’s own\npresentation of his philosophy and that the most promising way to\ndisplay the unity in question would be to provide both theoretical and\npractical philosophy with a common foundation. The first task for\nphilosophy, Fichte therefore concluded, is to discover a single,\nself-evident starting point or first principle from which one could\nthen somehow “derive” both theoretical and practical\nphilosophy, which is to say, our experience of ourselves as finite\ncognizers and as finite agents. Not only would such a strategy\nguarantee the systematic unity of philosophy itself, but, more\nimportantly, it would also display what Kant hinted at but never\ndemonstrated: viz., the underlying unity of reason itself. \n\nSince it is a central task of philosophy, so construed, to establish\nthe very possibility of any knowledge or science\n(Wissenschaft) whatsoever, Fichte proposed to replace the\ndisputed term “philosophy” (or “love of\nwisdom”) with the new term Wissenschaftslehre or\n‘Theory of Science’—a name intended to highlight\nthe distinctively “second order” character of\nphilosophical reflection. Though Fichte’s proposal never caught on as\na general name for what was once called “philosophy,” it\ndid become the universally acknowledged name for his own distinctive\nversion of transcendental idealism. Here again, it is important to keep\nin mind that “Wissenschaftslehre” is not the name\nof any particular Fichtean treatise, but is instead the general name\nfor his entire system or project—an allegedly all-encompassing\nsystem that consists of a number of interrelated parts or systematic\nsubdisciplines and an overarching project that could and would be\nexpounded in a series of radically different presentations, employing\na bewildering variety of systematic vocabularies. \n\nIn order to construct any genuine philosophy of freedom, maintained\nFichte, the reality of freedom itself must simply be presupposed and\nthus treated as an incontrovertible “fact of reason” in\nthe Kantian sense. This, of course, is not to deny the possibility of\nraising skeptical, theoretically grounded objections to such claims;\non the contrary, it was the very impossibility of any theoretically\nsatisfactory refutation of skepticism concerning the reality of\nfreedom that led Fichte to affirm the inescapable “primacy of\nthe practical” with respect to the selection of one’s\nphilosophical starting point. \n\nTo the extent that any proposed first principle of philosophy is\nsupposed to be the first principle of all knowledge and hence of all\nargument, it clearly cannot be derived from any higher principle and\nhence cannot be established by any sort of reasoning. Furthermore,\nFichte maintained that there are two and only two possible starting\npoints for the philosophical project of “explaining” experience:\nnamely, the concept of pure selfhood (which Fichte associated with pure\nfreedom) and that of pure thinghood (which Fichte associated with utter\nnecessity)—neither of which can be warranted, qua philosophical\nstarting point, by a direct appeal to experience, and each of which can\nbe arrived at only by a self-conscious act of philosophical\nabstraction from ordinary experience (within which freedom and\nnecessity, subject and object, are invariably joined as well as\ndistinguished). \n\nThe two rival philosophical strategies made possible by these opposed\nstarting points are unforgettably limned by Fichte in his two 1797\n“Introductions to the Wissenschaftslehre,” in\nwhich he characterizes the sort of philosophy that begins with the\npure I as “idealism” and that which begins with the thing\nin itself as “dogmatism.” Since, according to Fichte’s\nearlier argument in Concerning the Concept of the\nWissenschaftslehre, a unified system of philosophy can have one\nand only one first principle, and since there are two and only two\npossible first principles, then it follows that no “mixed”\nsystem of idealism/dogmatism is possible.  Moreover, since dogmatism,\nas understood by Fichte, unavoidably implies a strict form of\ndeterminism or “intelligible fatalism,” whereas idealism\nis, from the start, committed to the reality of human freedom, it is\nalso practically impossible to reach any sort of\n“compromise” between two such radically opposed\nsystems. \n\nThough Fichte conceded that neither dogmatism nor idealism could\ndirectly refute its opposite and thus recognized that the choice\nbetween philosophical starting points could never be resolved on\npurely theoretical grounds, he nevertheless denied that any dogmatic\nsystem, that is to say, any system that commences with the concept of\nsheer objectivity, could ever succeed in accomplishing what was\nrequired of all philosophy. Dogmatism, he argued, could never provide\na transcendental deduction of ordinary consciousness, for, in order to\naccomplish this, it would have to make an illicit leap from the realm\nof “things” to that of mental events or\n“representations” [Vorstellungen]. Idealism, in\ncontrast, at least when correctly understood as the kind of Critical\nidealism that demonstrates that the intellect itself must operate in\naccordance with certain necessary laws, can—at least in\nprinciple—accomplish the prescribed task of philosophy and\nexplain our experience of objects (“representations accompanied\nby a feeling of necessity”) in terms of the necessary operations\nof the intellect itself, and thus without having to make an illicit\nappeal to things in themselves. To be sure, one cannot decide in\nadvance whether or not any such deduction of experience from the mere\nconcept of free self-consciousness is actually\npossible. This, Fichte conceded, is something that can be decided only\nafter the construction of the system in question.  Until then, it\nremains a mere hypothesis that the principle of human\nfreedom, for all of its practical certainty, is also the proper\nstarting point for a transcendental account of objective\nexperience. \n\nIt must be granted that the truth of the Wissenschaftslehre’s\nstarting point cannot be established by any philosophical means,\nincluding its utility as a philosophical first principle. On the\ncontrary—and this is one of Fichte’s most characteristic and\ncontroversial claims—one already has to be convinced, on\nwholly extra-philosophical grounds, of the reality of one’s own\nfreedom before one can enter into the chain of deductions and\narguments that constitute the Wissenschaftslehre. This is the\nmeaning of Fichte’s oft-cited assertion that “the kind of\nphilosophy one chooses depends upon the kind of person one is.”\nThe only compelling reason why the transcendental idealist comes to a\nstop with—and thus begins his system with—the\nproposition that “the I freely posits itself” is therefore\nnot because he is unable to entertain theoretical doubts on this score\nnor because he is simply unable to continue the process of reflective\nabstraction. Instead, he appeals to a principle eloquently expressed\nby Fichte in his essay “On the Basis of Our Belief in a Moral\nGovernance of the World,” namely: “I cannot go beyond this\nstandpoint because I am not permitted to do so.” It is precisely\nbecause the categorical imperative is in this way invoked to secure\nthe first principle of his entire system that Fichte felt entitled to\nmake the rather startling claim that the Wissenschaftslehre\nis the only system of philosophy that “accords with\nduty.” \n\nThe published presentation of the first principles of the Jena\nWissenschaftslehre commences with the proposition, “the\nI posits itself”; more specifically, “the I posits itself\nas an I.” Since this activity of “self-positing” is\ntaken to be the fundamental feature of I-hood in general, the first\nprinciple asserts that “the I posits itself as\nself-positing.” Unfortunately, this starting point is somewhat\nobscured in Part I of the Foundation of the Entire\nWissenschaftslehre by a difficult and somewhat forced attempt on\nFichte’s part to connect this starting point to the logical law of\nidentity, as well as by the introduction of two additional\n“first principles,” corresponding to the logical laws of\nnon-contradiction and sufficient reason. (Significantly, this\ndistraction is eliminated entirely in the 1796/99\nWissenschaftslehre nova methodo, which begins with the simple\n“postulate” or “summons” to the reader:\n“think the I, and observe what is involved in doing\nthis.”) \n\n“To posit” (setzen) means simply “to be\naware of,” “to reflect upon,” or “to be\nconscious of”; this term does not imply that the I must simply\n“create” its objects of consciousness. The principle in\nquestion simply states that the essence of I-hood lies in the\nassertion of ones own self-identity, i.e., that consciousness\npresupposes self-consciousness (the Kantian “I think,”\nwhich must, at least in principle, be able to accompany all our\nrepresentations). Such immediate self-identify, however, cannot be\nunderstood as a psychological “fact,” no matter how\nprivileged, nor as an “action” or “accident”\nof some previously existing substance or being. To be sure, it is an\n“action” of the I, but one that is identical with the very\nexistence of the same. In Fichte’s technical terminology, the original\nunity of self-consciousness is to be understood as both an action and\nas the product of the same: as a Tathandlung or\n“fact/act,” a unity that is presupposed by and contained\nwithin every fact and every act of empirical consciousness, though it\nnever appears as such therein. \n\nThis same “identity in difference” of original\nself-consciousness might also be described as an “intellectual\nintuition,” inasmuch as it involves the immediate\npresence of the I to itself, prior to and independently of any sensory\ncontent. To be sure, such an “intellectual intuition”\nnever occurs, as such, within empirical consciousness; instead, it\nmust simply be presupposed (that is, “posited”) in order\nto explain the possibility of actual consciousness, within which\nsubject and object are always already distinguished. The occurrence of\nsuch an original intellectual intuition is itself inferred, not\nintuited. \n\nUnfortunately, Fichte confuses matters by sometimes using the term\n“inner” or “intellectual intuition” to\ndesignate something else entirely: namely, the act of\nphilosophical reflection or purified self-observation through\nwhich the philosopher becomes conscious of the transcendental\nconditions for the possibility of ordinary experience—among\nwhich, of course, is the occurrence of the “original”\nintellectual intuition as a Tathandlung. On other occasions,\nhe employs the term “intellectual intuition” in yet\nanother sense: namely, to designate our direct, practical awareness\nwithin everyday life of our moral obligations (categorical imperative\nqua “real intellectual intuition”). Given the\nsubsequent abuse of this term by Schelling and the romantics, as well\nas the confusion that one sometimes finds among expositors of Fichte\non this issue, it is crucial to recognize systematic ambiguity of the\nterm “intellectual intuition” in Fichte’s own\nwritings. \n\nA fundamental corollary of Fichte’s understanding of I-hood\n(Ichheit) as a kind of fact/act is his denial that\nthe I is originally any sort of “thing” or\n“substance.” Instead, the I is simply what it posits\nitself to be, and thus its “being” is, so to speak, a\nconsequence of its self-positing, or rather, is co-terminus with the\nsame. The first principle of the Jena Wissenschaftslehre is\nthus equally “practical” and “theoretical,”\ninsofar as the act described by this principle is a\n“doing” as well as a “knowing,” a deed as well\nas a cognition. Thus the problematic unity of theoretical and\npractical reason is guaranteed from the start, inasmuch as this very\nunity is a condition for the possibility of self-consciousness. \n\nAfter establishing the first principle and conceiving the act\nexpressed therein, the philosophical task is then to discover what\nother acts must necessarily occur as conditions for the possibility of\nthe original, “simply posited,” first act and then to do\nthe same for each of these successively discovered acts (or the\ntheorems in which they are formulated). By continuing in this manner,\none will, according to Fichte, finally arrive at a complete deduction\nof the a priori structure of ordinary experience or, what amount to\nthe same thing, a complete inventory of the “original acts of\nthe mind.” This is precisely the task of the first or\n“foundational” portion of the Jena system. \n\nJust as we are never directly aware of the original act of\nself-positing with which the system commences, so are we also unaware—except, of course, from the artificial standpoint of\nphilosophical reflection—of each of these additional\n“necessary but unconscious” acts that are derived as\nconditions necessary for the possibility of the originally posited act\nof self-positing. Furthermore, though we must, due to the discursive\ncharacter of reflection itself, distinguish each of these acts from\nthe others that it is conditioned by and that are, in turn,\nconditioned by it, none of these individual acts actually occurs in\nisolation from all of the others. Transcendental philosophy is thus an\neffort to analyze what is in fact the single,\nsynthetic act through which the I posits for itself both\nitself and its world, thereby becoming aware in a single moment of\nboth its freedom and its limitations, its infinity and its\nfinitude. The result of such an analysis is the recognition that,\nalthough “the I simply posits itself,” its freedom is\nnever “absolute” or “unlimited”; instead,\nfreedom proves to be conceivable—and hence the I itself proves\nto be possible—only as limited and finite. Despite widespread\nmisunderstanding of this point, the Wissenschaftslehre is not\na theory of the absolute I. Instead, the conclusion of both the\nFoundation of the Entire Wissenschaftslehre and of the\nWissenschaftslehre nova methodo is that the “absolute\nI” is a mere abstraction and that the only sort of I that can\nactually exist or act is a finite, empirical, embodied, individual\nself. \n\nThe I must posit itself in order to be an I at all; but it can posit\nitself only insofar as it posits itself as limited (and hence divided\nagainst itself, inasmuch as it also posits itself as unlimited or\n“absolute”). Moreover, it cannot even posit for itself its\nown limitations, in the sense of producing or creating these\nlimits. The finite I (the intellect) cannot be the ground of its own\npassivity.  Instead, according to Fichte’s analysis, if the I is to\nposit itself at all, it must simply discover itself to be\nlimited, a discovery that Fichte characterizes as a\n‘check’ or Anstoß to the free, practical\nactivity of the I. Such an original limitation of the I is, however, a\nlimit for the I only insofar as the I posits it as such. I does this,\naccording to Fichte’s analysis, by positing its own limitation, first,\nas a mere “feeling,” then as a “sensation,”\nthen as an “intuition” of a thing, and finally as a\n“concept.” The Anstoß thus provides the\nessential occasion or impetus that first sets in motion the entire\ncomplex train of activities that finally result in our conscious\nexperience both of ourselves as empirical individuals and of a world\nof spatio-temporal material objects. \n\nThough this doctrine of the Anstoß may seem to play a\nrole in Fichte’s philosophy not unlike that which has sometimes been\nassigned to the thing in itself in the Kantian system, the fundamental\ndifference is this: the Anstoß is not something foreign\nto the I. Instead, it denotes the I’s original encounter with its own\nfinitude. Rather than claim that the Not-I is the cause or ground of\nthe Anstoß, Fichte argues that the former is posited by\nthe I precisely in order to “explain” to itself the\nlatter, that is, in order to become conscious of the same. Though the\nWissenschaftslehre demonstrates that such an\nAnstoß must occur if self-consciousness is to be\nactual, transcendental philosophy itself is quite unable to deduce or\nto explain the actual occurrence of such an Anstoß—except as a condition for the possibility of consciousness.\nAccordingly, there are strict limits to what can be expected from any\na priori deduction of experience. According to Fichte, transcendental\nphilosophy can explain, for example, why the world has a\nspatio-temporal character and a causal structure, but it can never\nexplain why objects have the particular sensible properties they\nhappen to have or why I am this determinate individual rather than\nanother.  This is something that the I simply has to discover at the\nsame time that it discovers its own freedom, and indeed, as a\ncondition for the latter. (It must be admitted, however, that Fichte’s\nown ambitious descriptions of his project sometimes obscure the\nessential limits of the same and that he sometimes gives his readers\nthe false impression that the Wissenschaftslehre proposes to\nprovide a complete a priori deduction of all the empirical details of\nexperience. This however is certainly not the case.) \n\nDespite this important stricture on the scope of transcendental\nphilosophy, there remains much that can be demonstrated within the\nfoundational portion of the Wissenschaftslehre. For example,\nit can be shown that the I could not become conscious of its own\nlimits in the manner required for the possibility of any\nself-consciousness unless it also possessed an original and\nspontaneous ability to synthesize the finite and the infinite. In this\nsense, the Wissenschaftslehre deduces the power of productive\nimagination as an original power of the mind. Similarly, it can be\nshown that the I could not be “checked” in the manner\nrequired for the possibility of consciousness unless it possessed, in\naddition to its original “theoretical” power of productive\nimaginative, an equally original “practical” power of\nsheer willing, which, once “checked,” is immediately\nconverted into a capacity for endless striving. The foundational\nportion of the Wissenschaftslehre thus also includes a\ndeduction of the categorical imperative (albeit in a particularly\nabstract and morally empty form) and of the practical power of the\nI. For Fichte, therefore, “the primacy of the practical”\nmeans not simply that philosophy must recognize a certain autonomous\nsphere within which practical reason is efficacious and practical\nconsiderations are appropriate; instead, it implies something much\nstronger: namely, the recognition that, as Fichte puts it, “the\npractical power is the innermost root of the I” and thus that\n“our freedom itself is a theoretical determining principle of\nour world.” The Wissenschaftslehre as a whole can\ntherefore be described as a massive effort to demonstrate that reason\ncould not be theoretical if it were not also practical—at the\nsame time, to be sure, that also demonstrates that reason could not be\npractical if were not also theoretical. \n\nFreedom, according to Fichte’s argument, is possible and actual only\nwithin the context of limitation and necessity, and thus it is never\n“absolute,” but always limited and finite. On the other\nhand, just as surely as a free subject must posit its freedom\n“absolutely”—that is to say, ‘purely and\nsimply’ (schlechthin) and “for no reason”\nwhatsoever—so must it never identify itself with any\ndeterminate or limited state of its own being. On the contrary, a\nfinite free self must constantly strive to transform both the natural\nand the human worlds in accordance with its own freely-posited goals.\nThe sheer unity of the self, which was posited as the starting point\nof the Foundations, is thereby transformed into an\nidea of reason in the Kantian sense: the actual I is always\nfinite and divided against itself, and hence it is always striving for\na sheer self-determinacy that it never achieves. Between the original\nabstraction of pure selfhood as sheer Tathandlung and the\nconcluding (necessary) idea of a self that is only what it determines\nitself to be, in which “is” and “ought” wholly\ncoincide, lies the entire realm of actual consciousness and real human\nexperience. \n\nHaving established the foundation of his new system, Fichte then\nturned to the task of constructing upon this foundation a\nfully-articulated transcendental system, the overall structure of\nwhich is most clearly outlined in the concluding section of the\ntranscripts of his lectures on Wissenschaftslehre nova\nmethodo. According to this plan, which has no analog in Fichte’s\nlater writings, the Entire Wissenschaftslehre is to\nconsisting of four, systematically interrelated parts:: (1) first\nphilosophy, which corresponds to the “foundational”\nportion of the system, as presented in the Foundation of the\nentire Wissenschaftslehre and revised in the lectures on\nWissenschaftslehre nova methodo; (2) “theoretical\nphilosophy” or “philosophy of nature,” (3)\n“practical philosophy” or ethics (corresponding to the\ncontent of the System of Ethics); and (4) “philosophy\nof the postulates,” which includes the subdisciplines of\n“natural law” or “theory of right” (as\nexpounded in the Foundation of Natural Right) and philosophy\nof religion. \n\nBy “philosophy of nature,” Fichte seems to have had in\nmind something similar to Kant’s Metaphysical First Principles of\nNature, though Fichte himself devoted very little attention to\nthe execution of such a project. The closest he ever came to\ndeveloping a philosophy of nature according to transcendental\nprinciples is the compressed account of space, time, and matter\npresented in the Outline of the Distinctive Character of the\nWissenschaftslehre with Respect to the Theoretical Faculty and\nthe lectures on Wissenschaftslehre nova methodo. In neither\nof these works, however, does he make any effort to distinguish\nrigorously between the “theoretical” aspect of the\nfoundational portion of his system and a distinctively\n“theoretical” subdivision of the same (“philosophy\nof nature”). In fact, a “philosophy of nature in\naccordance with the principles of the\nWissenschaftslehre” turns out to me even more modest\nthan Kant’s and more closely resembles what later came to be called\nthe philosophy of (natural) science than it does the speculative\nNaturphilosophie of Schelling and Hegel. Indeed, disagreement\nconcerning the compatibility of a rigorously transcendental philosophy\nwith a speculative, a priori “philosophy of nature” was\nthe very issue that precipitated the rift between Fichte and his\nerstwhile disciple, Schelling. The popular picture of Fichte’s\nattitude toward nature, namely, that he viewed the latter almost\nentirely from the perspective of human projects, that is, as the\nnecessary realm for moral striving, is therefore very close to the\ntruth. \n\nIn contrast to Fichte’s rather cursory treatment of purely theoretical\nphilosophy, ethics or “practical philosophy,” which\nanalyzes the determinate ways in which willing and acting are\ndeterminable by principles of pure reason, constitutes a major portion\nof the Jena system, and the System of Ethics is Fichte’s\nlongest single book. Whereas theoretical philosophy explains how the\nworld necessarily is, practical philosophy explains how the\nworld ought to be, which is to say, how it ought to be\naltered by rational beings. Ethics thus considers the object\nof consciousness not as something given or even as something\nconstructed by necessary laws of consciousness, but rather as\nsomething to be produced by a freely acting subject, consciously\nstriving to establish and to accomplish its own goals and guided only\nby its own self-legislated laws. The specific task of\nFichte’s ethics is therefore, first of all, to deduce the categorical\nimperative (in its distinctively moral sense) from the general\nobligation to determine oneself freely, and, second, to deduce from\nthis the particular obligations that apply to every free and finite\nrational being. \n\nLike all of Fichte’s systematic treatises of the Jena period, The\nSystem of Ethics begins with a detailed analysis of what is\ninvolved in the self-positing of the I. In this case, the focus is\nupon the necessity that the I posit for itself its own activity or\n“efficacy,” and upon a detailed analysis of the\nconditions for doing this. In this manner Fichte deduces what he calls\n“the principle of all practical philosophy,” viz., that\nsomething objective (a being) follows from something subjective (a\nconcept), and hence that the I must ascribe to itself a power of free\npurposiveness or causality in the sensible world. The I must posit\nitself as an embodied will, and only as such does it\n“discover” itself at all. From this starting point Fichte\nthen proceeds to a deduction of the principle of morality: namely,\nthat I must think of my freedom as standing under a certain necessary\nlaw or categorical imperative, which Fichte calls\n“the law of self-sufficiency” or “autonomy,”\nand that I ought always to determine my freedom in accordance\nwith this law. This, therefore, is the task of the philosophical\nscience of “ethics,” as understood by Fichte: to provide\nan a priori deduction of our moral nature in general and of our\nspecific duties as human beings. \n\nViewed from the perspective of practical philosophy, the world really\nis nothing more than what Fichte once described as “the material\nof our duty made sensible,” which is precisely the viewpoint\nadopted by the morally engaged, practically striving subject. On the\nother hand, this is not the only way the world can be viewed, and,\nmore specifically, it is not the only way in which it is construed by\ntranscendental philosophy. For this reason it is somewhat misleading\nto characterized the Wissenschaftslehre as a whole as a\nsystem of “ethical idealism.” As noted above, Fichte\ncertainly does succeed in constructing an account of consciousness\nthat fully integrates the imperatives and activities of practical\nreason into the very structure of the latter, but this integration is\nalways balanced by a recognition of the constitutive role of\ntheoretical reason and of the sheer, contingent “giveness”\nof the I’s original determinacy (doctrine of the\nAnstoß). \n\nThe final portion of the Jena system is devoted to “the\nphilosophy of the postulates,” a discipline that Fichte\nconceived of as occupying the middle ground between purely theoretical\nand purely practical philosophy. In this portion of the system the\nworld is considered neither as it simply is nor as it simply ought to\nbe; instead, either the practical realm of freedom is viewed from the\ntheoretical perspective of the natural world (in which case one\nconsiders the postulates that theoretical reason addresses to\npractical reason) or else, alternatively, the natural world is viewed\nfrom the perspective of practical reason or the moral law (in which\ncase one considers the postulates that practical reason addresses to\ntheoretical reason).  The first of these perspectives is that of\njuridical philosophy or philosophy of law, or what Fichte calls the\n“doctrine of right” (Rechtslehre); the latter is\nthat of the philosophy of religion. \n\nFichte’s philosophy of right (or of “natural law”), as\nexpounded in his Foundation of Natural Right, is one of the\nmost original and influential portions of the Jena\nWissenschaftslehre.  Written prior to Kant’s treatment of the\nsame topic (in Part One of the Metaphysics of Morals),\nFichte’s philosophy of right is notable, first of all, because of the\nway in which it distinguishes sharply between the realm of ethics and\nthat of “right” and tries to develop a complete theory of\nthe latter (a “theory of justice”) without appealing to\nthe categorical imperative or the moral law, and secondly, because of\nthe inclusion within this theory of a thoroughly original\n“deduction” of the social character of human beings. \n\nFichte’s transcendental account of natural right proceeds from the\ngeneral principle that the I must posit itself as an\nindividual in order to posit itself at all, and that in order\nto posit itself as an individual it must recognize itself as\n“summoned” or “solicited” by another\nfree individual—summoned, that is, to limit its own freedom\nout of respect for that of the freedom of the other. The same\ncondition applies, of course, to the other; hence, mutual recognition\nof rational individuals turns out to be condition necessary for the\npossibility of I-hood in general. This a priori deduction of\nintersubjectivity is so central to the conception of selfhood\ndeveloped in the Jena Wissenschaftslehre that Fichte, in his\nlectures on Wissenschaftslehre nova methodo, incorporated it\ninto his revised presentation of the very foundations of his system,\nwhere the “summons” takes its place alongside\n“original feeling” (which takes the place of the earlier\n“check”) as both a limit upon the absolute\nfreedom of the I and a condition for the positing of the same. \n\nThe specific task of Fichte’s theory of right is to consider the\nspecific ways in which the freedom of each individual must be\nrestricted in order that several individuals can live together with\nthe maximum amount of mutual freedom, and it derives its a priori\nconcepts of the laws of social interaction entirely from the sheer\nconcept of an individual I, as conditions for the possibility of the\nlatter. Fichte’s concept of right therefore obtains its binding force\nnot from the ethical law, but rather from the general laws of thinking\nand from enlightened self-interest, and the force of such\nconsiderations is hypothetical rather than categorical. The theory of\nright examines how the freedom of each individual must be externally\nlimited if a free society of free and equal individuals is to\nbe possible. \n\nUnlike Kant, Fichte does not treat political philosophy merely as a\nsubdivision of moral theory. On the contrary, it is an independent\nphilosophical discipline with a topic and a priori principles of its\nown. Whereas ethics analyzes the concept of what is demanded\nof a freely willing subject, the theory of right describes what such a\nsubject is permitted to do (as well as what he can rightfully\nbe coerced to do). Whereas ethics is concerned with the inner\nworld of conscience, the theory of right is concerned only with the\nexternal, public realm, though only insofar as the latter can be\nviewed as an embodiment of freedom. \n\nHaving established the general, albeit hypothetical concept of right,\nFichte then turns to an investigation of the conditions necessary for\nthe realization or “application” of the same: that is, for\nthe actual coexistence of free individuals, or the existence of a free\nsociety. The sum of these “conditions” constitute the sum\nof our “natural rights” as human beings, rights that can\nbe instantiated and guaranteed only within a deliberately constructed\nfree society. On purely a priori grounds, therefore, Fichte purports\nto be able to determine the general requirements of such a community\nand the sole justification for legitimate political coercion and\nobligation. \n\nThe precise relationship of Fichte’s theory of right to the social\ncontract tradition is complex, but the general outline is as follows:\nFichte presents an a priori argument for the fundamentally\nsocial character of human beings, an argument grounded upon\nan analysis of the very structure of self-consciousness and the\nrequirements for self-positing. Only after this “deduction”\nof the concept of right and of the applicability of the same does he\nexplicitly introduce the notion of what he calls the\nStaatsbürgervertrag or “citizens’ contract,”\na notion that he goes on to analyze into a series of distinguishable\nmoments, including the “civil contract” proper (or\n“property contract”), the “protection\ncontract,” and the “contract of unification,” all of\nwhich must be supplemented by the contracts of\n“subjection” and “expiation.” Fichte thus\npropounds what one might call a “contract theory of the\nstate,” but not of human community. \n\nAs numerous commentators, beginning with Hegel, whose own\nPhilosophy of Right was strongly influenced, both positively\nand negatively, by Fichte’s Foundations of Natural Right,\nhave pointed out, the actual theory of the state that Fichte himself,\nin Part Two of that work, erected upon what would appear to be a\nrather “liberal” theoretical foundation contains many\nelements that are not usually associated with the individualistic,\nliberal tradition—including a general indifference to\nquestions of constitutional structure, public participation in\ngovernment, etc., and a strong emphasis upon the “police”\nfunctions of the state (functions which, for Fichte, were not limited\nto concerns of security, but also included those of social\nwelfare). This, however, is not particularly surprising, since the\nfunction of the state in Fichte’s system is primarily to employ\ncoercion to guarantee that the parties to the contract will, in fact,\ndo what they have promised to do and to insure that every citizen will\nhave an opportunity to realize his own (limited) freedom. One of the\nmore remarkable features of Fichte’s conception of right is that every\ncitizen is entitled to the full and productive employment of his\nlabor, and hence that the state has a duty to manage the economy\naccordingly. The truth is that Fichte’s social and political theory is\nvery difficult to fit into the usual categories, but combines certain\nelements usually associated with liberal individualism with others\nmore commonly associated with communitarian statism. \n\nIn addition to the postulates addressed by theoretical to practical\nreason, there are also those addressed by practical reason to nature\nitself. The latter is the domain of the transcendental philosophy of\nreligion, which is concerned solely with the question of the extent to\nwhich the realm of nature can be said to accommodate itself to the\naims of morality. The questions dealt with within such a philosophy of\nreligion are those concerning the nature, limits, and legitimacy of\nour belief in divine providence. The philosophy of religion, as\nconceived by Fichte, has nothing to do with the historical claims of\nrevealed religion or with particular religious traditions and\npractices. Indeed, this is precisely the distinction between\nphilosophy of religion and “theology.” \n\nAs noted above, Fichte never had a chance to develop this final\nsubdivision of his Jena system, beyond the tentative foray into this\ndomain represented by his controversial essay “Concerning the\nBasis of Our Belief in a Divine Governance of the World” and the\nworks he contributed to the ensuing “atheism controversy.”\nIn “Concerning the Basis of our Belief” he certainly seems\nto contend that, so far as philosophy is concerned, the realm of the\ndivine is that of this world, albeit viewed in terms of the\nrequirements of the moral law, in which case it is transformed from\nthe natural to the “the moral world order,” and that no\nfurther inference to a transcendent “moral lawgiver” is\ntheoretically or practically required or warranted. In this same essay\nFichte also sought to draw a sharp distinction between religion and\nphilosophy (a distinction parallel to the crucial distinction between\nthe “ordinary” and “transcendental”\nstandpoints) and to defend philosophy’s right to postulate, on purely\na priori grounds, something like a “moral world order.”\nPhilosophy of religion thus includes a deduction of the postulate that\nour moral actions really do make some difference in the world. But\nthis is about as far as it can go. \n\nWith respect to the existence of God, the argument of Fichte’s essay\nis primarily negative, inasmuch as it explicitly denies that any\npostulate of the existence of a God independent of the moral law is\njustifiable on philosophical grounds. In the wake of the atheism\ncontroversy, Fichte returned to this subject and, in his “From a\nPrivate Letter” and in Part Three of The Vocation of\nMan, attempted to restate his position in a manner that at least\nappeared to be more compatible with the claims of theism. \n\nFor much of the nineteenth century, beginning with Hegel’s\nself-serving interpretation of the history of modern philosophy,\nFichte’s Wissenschaftslehre was generally assimilated into\nthe larger history of Germany idealism. Criticized by both Schelling\nand Hegel as a one-sided, “subjective” idealism and a\nprime instance of the “philosophy of reflection,” Fichte’s\nWissenschaftslehre was almost universally treated as a\nsuperseded rung on the ladder “from Kant to Hegel” and\nthus assigned a purely historical significance.  Neglected as the\nWissenschaftslehre may have been during this period, Fichte\nwas not entirely forgotten, but remained influential as the author of\nthe Addresses to the German Nation and was alternately hailed\nand vilified as one of the founders of modern pan-German\nnationalism. \n\nThis same situation prevailed throughout much of the twentieth century\nas well, during which Fichte’s fortune seemed closely tied to that of\nGermany. Particularly during the long periods preceding, during, and\nfollowing the two World Wars, Fichte was discussed almost exclusively\nin the context of German politics and national identity, and his\ntechnical philosophy tended to be dismissed as a monstrous or comical\nspeculative aberration of no relevance whatsoever to contemporary\nphilosophy. There were, to be sure, isolated exceptions and authors\nsuch as Fritz Medicus, Martial Gueroult, Xavier Léon, and Max\nWundt who, during the first half of the twentieth century, took Fichte\nseriously as a philosopher and made lasting contributions to the study\nof his thought. But the real boom in Fichte studies has come only in\nthe past four decades, during which the Wissenschaftslehre\nhas once again become the object of intense philosophical scrutiny and\nlively, world-wide discussion—as is evidenced by the\nestablishment of large and active professional societies devoted to\nFichte in Europe, Japan, and North America. \n\nJ. H. Stirling once quipped that “Fichte had two\nphilosophical epochs; and if both belong to biography, only one\nbelongs to history,” and until quite recently there was a great\ndeal of truth to this observation. Indeed, even today, Fichte’s\ntechnical writings of the post-Jena period remain little-known to the\nvast majority of philosophers. Admittedly, it is hard to recognize\nthese late texts—which drop the strategy of beginning with an\nanalysis of the self, along with the strong emphasis upon the\n“primacy of the practical,” and which include\nunembarrassed references to an apparently transcendent\n“absolute” (“Being,” “Absolute\nBeing,” “God”)—as the work of the same\nauthor who wrote the Foundations of the Entire\nWissenschaftslehre. Though Fichte himself always insisted that\nhis basic philosophy remained the same, no matter how much his\npresentation thereof may have altered over the years, many sympathetic\nreaders and not a few well-informed scholars have found it impossible\nto reconcile this claim with what at least appear to be the profound\nsystematic and doctrinal differences between the “early”\nand “late” Wissenschaftslehre. It is therefore\nnot surprising that the problematic “unity” of Fichte’s\nthought continues to be vigorously debated by experts in the\nfield. \n\nWhatever one may conclude concerning the relationship between Fichte’s\nearlier and later writings, it is certainly the case that, with the\npublication of numerous, faithfully edited “new”\nmanuscripts of later versions of the Wissenschaftslehre, the\nfocus of much of the best contemporary Fichte scholarship has shifted\nto his later texts, most of which were entirely unknown to earlier\ngenerations of readers. Seldom has a new edition of a philosopher’s\nliterary corpus had a greater effect upon the contemporary reputation\nof the thinker in question or a more stimulating effect upon\ncontemporary scholarship than in the case of the monumental new\ncritical edition of Fichte’s works begun in the early nineteen-sixties\nunder the auspices of the Bavarian Academy of the Sciences and the\ngeneral editorship of Reinhard Lauth and others. Now nearing\ncompletion, this edition has contributed directly and enormously to\nthe contemporary revival of interest in Fichte’s philosophy in\ngeneral, and in the later versions of the Wissenschaftslehre\nin particular. Much of the best recent work on Fichte, particularly in\nGermany, Italy, and Japan, has been devoted exclusively to his later\nthought. Stirling’s observation is thus no longer true, inasmuch as\nthe work of Fichte’s “second epoch” has, however\nbelatedly, now become the object of genuine and lively philosophical\ndiscussion and dispute. \n\nIn contrast, anglophone Fichte scholarship, which has also experienced\nquite a renaissance of its own over the past few decades, has remained\nlargely focused upon the “classical” texts of the Jena\nperiod. This is no doubt due, in large part at least, to the\nappearance, during these same decades, of new, reliable translations\nof almost all of Fichte’s early writings and the lack of translations\nof his later, unpublished texts. But it is also a reflection of the\nrelatively anemic tradition of Fichte scholarship in England and North\nAmerica, where even the early Wissenschaftslehre has long\nbeen neglected and under-appreciated. Until quite recently, virtually\nno scholars writing in English were interested in examining the\nWissenschaftslehre in its own right, but were mainly\nconcerned to determine Fichte’s position in relationship to Kant’s or\nHegel’s.  This situation, however, has fundamentally altered, and some\nof the most insightful and original current work on Fichte is being\ndone in English.  The recent publication of an English translation of\nthe Fichte’s second series of lectures on the\nWissenschaftslehr from 1804 suggests that anglophone Fichte\nscholarship is at least ready to begin coming to terms with Fichte’s\nlater philosophy.","contact.mail":"breazeal@uky.edu","contact.domain":"uky.edu"}]
