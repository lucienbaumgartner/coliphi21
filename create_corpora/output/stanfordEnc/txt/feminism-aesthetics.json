Rather, to refer to feminist\naesthetics is to identify a set of perspectives that pursue certain\nquestions about philosophical theories and assumptions regarding art\nand aesthetic categories. Feminists in general have concluded that,\ndespite the seemingly neutral and inclusive theoretical language of\nphilosophy, virtually all areas of the discipline bear the mark of\ngender in their basic conceptual frameworks. Those who work in\naesthetics inquire into the ways that gender influences the formation\nof ideas about art, artists, and aesthetic value. Feminist\nperspectives in aesthetics are also attuned to the cultural influences\nthat exert power over subjectivity: the ways that art both reflects\nand perpetuates the social formation of gender, sexuality, and\nidentity, and the extent to which all of those features are framed by\nfactors such as race, national origin, social position, and historical\nsituation. These interests have broadened from early analyses of norms\ngoverning female appearance to include consideration of the disabled\nbody and of transgender identities.\n\n\nAesthetics is by nature rather more interdisciplinary than are some\nother areas of philosophy, for this field articulates with art\npractices and the critical disciplines. Contributions to feminist\nperspectives in aesthetics have been made not only by philosophers but\nalso by art historians, musicologists, and theorists of literature,\nfilm, and performance, and by artists themselves. There are practical\nimplications for the discoveries that emerge from feminist\ninvestigations: analyses of the historical conceptual frameworks that\ngovern aesthetics and philosophy of art help to account for the\ndisproportionate numbers of men over women as influential\npractitioners of the arts, for example. Philosophical theories adapted\nby feminists also have been highly influential in the critical\ninterpretation of art and popular culture and sometimes in the\ndevelopment of contemporary artistic practice. Feminist aesthetics\npursues inquiries and critiques that reach into the values at the very\nfoundations of philosophy, examining concepts that often do not\ndirectly refer to men and women at all, yet whose hierarchies are\nimbued with gendered significance.\n\n\nThe following sections each begin with critiques of theoretical\ntraditions and feminist interventions and alternatives. These\nendeavors lead not only to revisions of philosophical positions but\nalso to the dissemination of feminist perspectives in areas collateral\nto traditional aesthetics. This progression moves historically through\ntopics that have animated the field, from early work to the most\nrecent.\n\nFeminist perspectives in aesthetics first arose in the 1970s from a\ncombination of political activism in the contemporary art world and\ncritiques of the historical traditions of philosophy and of the arts.\nThey have developed in conjunction with the postmodern debates about\nculture and society that have taken place in many fields in the social\nsciences and humanities. These debates often begin with an assessment\nof the western philosophical legacy, a legacy that is nowhere more\nchallenged than in the art world itself. Therefore, the significance\nof many contemporary art movements, including feminist and\npostfeminist work, is dramatized and clarified by understanding the\ntraditional values and theories that they address and challenge. \nThe richest historical target for feminist critiques of philosophies\nof art has been the concept of fine art, which refers to art that is\ncreated chiefly for aesthetic enjoyment. It includes at its core\npainting, music, literature, and sculpture, and it excludes crafts,\npopular art, and entertainment. Closely related to the concept of fine\nart are ideas about the creative genius of the artist, who is often\nconceived as possessing a unique vision expressed in art works. It was\nthe fine art tradition of painting that art historian Linda Nochlin\nhad in mind in 1971 when she asked her famous question, “Why\nhave there been no great women artists?” (Nochlin 1971 [1988]).\nSince the modifier “fine” already contains profound\nimplications for the gender of artists, some background regarding the\nolder history of ideas about art and artists is first needed in order\nto understand the variety of answers that can be provided to that\nquestion. This inquiry also positions us to understand the media,\nsubject matter, and styles that contemporary feminist artists and art\ntheorists have advanced. What is more, examination of the ancient\nroots of philosophy of art reveals a gendered value structure that\npersists to this day. \nThe term “art” has not always served as shorthand for the\nfine arts. Like most of the terms that refer to major conceptual\nanchors of the western intellectual tradition, its origins may be\ntraced to classical antiquity. The Greek term that we now usually\ntranslate “art” is techne, a term that is equally\nwell translated as “skill,” and that in its broadest sense\nwas used to distinguish products of human endeavor from objects of\nnature. The types of techne that most resemble our modern\nconcept of art are those that are “mimetic” or imitative,\nthat is, that reproduce the look of an object or that express an idea\nin narrative or drama. Sculpture imitates the human form, for\ninstance; music imitates sounds of nature and voices or—more\nabstractly—human emotions. Drama and epic poetry imitate lived\nevents. That art’s nature is to be mimetic was widely assumed\nfor centuries, and most commentators, including Aristotle, extolled\nthe ability of the mimetic artist to capture with beauty and skill\nsome truth about life and the world. The Roman historian Pliny the\nElder recorded the acclaim for painters who were able to render their\nsubjects in line and color so accurately that they were\nindistinguishable from their appearance in nature. \nProbably the earliest philosophical discussion of art in the Greek\ntradition occurs in Plato’s Republic. Unlike most of\nhis contemporaries, Plato regarded mimesis as dangerous. The\nRepublic is an extended investigation of the nature of\njustice, in the course of which Socrates and his friends envision an\nideal society that strictly censors and controls art forms such as\ndrama, music, painting, and sculpture. According to Plato’s\nmetaphysics, the abstract world of the Forms possesses a greater\ndegree of reality than the physical world with its changing, unstable\nevents and objects. Hence the more direct the apprehension of Forms,\nthe closer a human mind can approach Truth. Imitations such as\npaintings mimic the mere appearance of physical objects, becoming (as\nhe puts it in Republic X) three times removed from reality\nand the truth. Mimesis substitutes illusion for truth, and it does so\nin seductively pleasurable ways. What is more, arts such as tragic\npoetry rivet attention by engaging powerful emotions such as fear,\nenervating the virtues of a courageous person but paradoxically\npleasing at the same time. According to Plato’s analysis of the\nhuman psyche, the nonrational elements of the soul are powerful forces\nthat might divert the intellect from the cooler apprehension of\nwisdom; thus the pleasures that mimetic art delivers are sufficiently\nrisky that art should be carefully curbed in a well-governed\nsociety. \nPlato’s denigration of mimesis does not seem immediately to have\nanything to do with gender, although his influential system has\nimportant indirect implications that are rife with gendered\nsignificance. In his preference for the philosophical quest to attain\nknowledge of the Forms over indulgence in the pleasures of mimesis,\nfor example, one can see a hierarchy of values that rank the eternal,\nabstract, intellectual world of ideal forms over the transient,\nparticular, sensuous world of physical objects. This hierarchy\nsupports the dualism between mind and body that is deeply correlated\nwith gender asymmetry, and that was a fundamental target of critique\nin the early development of feminist perspectives in philosophy.\nFeminist philosophers take note of certain concepts that appear in\n“binary” combinations: mind-body; universal-particular;\nreason-emotion, sense, and appetite; and so forth—including\nmale-female. These are not merely correlative pairs, they are ranked\npairs in which the first item is taken to be naturally superior to the\nsecond (Gatens 1991: 92). Universality is considered superior to\nparticularity because it provides more general knowledge, for example;\nreason is superior to emotion because it is supposedly a more reliable\nfaculty. Both preferences represent a partiality for\n“objectivity” over “subjectivity,” concepts\nthat have an especially complicated significance in aesthetics. What\nis more, the sorts of pleasures that mimesis arouses are emotional and\nappetitive, appealing more to the body than to the intellect.\nTherefore we can find in Plato’s peculiar assessment of mimetic\narts an elevation of intellect and abstraction over emotion and\nparticularity. While not explicitly invoked, gender is present in\nassumptions of this discussion, because “male” and\n“female” (sometimes conflated with “masculine”\nand “feminine,” though the terms are not synonymous) are\nroot members of the pairs of opposites that have been present in\nwestern philosophy since Pythagoras. While there are no direct\nreferences to women creators in the Republic, this philosophy\nof art partakes of gendered concepts at its very core. The\nimplications of such concepts for artists evolve into explicit form\nwith the genesis of the modern category of fine art and its\ncreators. \nScholars disagree about how to date the rise of the special category\nof arts designated “fine arts” or “beaux\narts.” Some claim that the concept begins to emerge in the\nRenaissance, while others argue that it is not until the eighteenth\ncentury that fine art really firms up as a distinct classification\n(Kristeller 1951–52; Shiner 2001). At this time the idea that art is\nessentially mimetic begins to recede, and it gradually gives way to a\nromantic concept of art as self-expression. The eighteenth century is\nalso the period that produces many treatises comparing arts to one\nanother according to shared principles and, even more importantly,\ndevelops influential theories about a particular kind of pleasure\ntaken in objects of nature and art that becomes known as\n“aesthetic” enjoyment. This type of pleasure was central\nto the theories of taste that characterize the formative theories of\naesthetics. \nThe focus on fine art singles out the purely aesthetic values of works\nof art and positions them so centrally that the very concept of art is\nnarrowed. Art that is appreciated for its beauty or other aesthetic\nvirtues is distinct from the sorts of arts that produce items for\npractical use, such as furniture, cushions, or utensils. The latter\ncame to be designated “crafts,” and while their usefulness\nand skill-requirements were recognized, the making of a craft object\nwas considered decidedly less of an original achievement than the\ncreation of a work of fine art. Artistic creativity increasingly came\nto be regarded as a kind of personal expression that externalizes the\nvision of the individual artist in a work of autonomous value; craft,\nby contrast, aims at some practical function. \nThe significance of the fine art-craft distinction for the assessment\nof women’s creative production is substantial. While there are\nmany objects that are excluded from the category of fine art whose\nmakers are male, those objects of domestic use whose creation was\npredominantly the occupation of women were all marginalized by this\ncategory and its attendant values (Parker and Pollock 1981). Thereby\nthe traditional domestic arts were removed from the history of art\nproper. This historical change suggests one reason that painting, for\nexample, has had so few “great” female practitioners:\nhistorically women’s creative efforts were likely to be directed\nto the production of domestic wares; when these were shunted into the\ncategory of “craft,” women’s presence in the genre\nof visual arts shrank radically. \nWhat is more, the rise of attention to the fine arts gave those arts a\nparticularly public presence. The modern institution of the museum put\npaintings and sculptures on display; the concert hall made\nperformances available to a larger public (Shiner 2001). This is a\nperiod of history when ideas of social propriety were especially\ndivergent for men and women of the middle and upper classes, the chief\nconsumers of the fine arts. While it was considered a domestic benefit\nfor well-bred young ladies to be able to perform music at home for\nfamily and guests and to decorate the walls of the home with deft\npaintings, public exposure of such talents was widely regarded as\nimproper and unfeminine. Therefore, what talents women exercised in\nareas such as music tended to remain in the amateur realm rather than\nbe exerted in the more public professional world that monitored\nimportant developments of art forms. (There are notable exceptions\nsuch as the musicians Clara Schumann and Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, but\nthey are comparatively few.) Thus another reason women artists in many\ngenres take a back seat to their male colleagues is that they withdrew\nfrom or were denied the kind of education and training that prepared\nthem for the exacting standards of the public audience. (Nochlin notes\nhow many women painters were trained by artist-fathers who were able\nto provide them with the kind of training that would otherwise be\ndifficult to obtain; the same may be said of women musicians [Citron\n1993; McClary 1991].) These historical explanations illuminate another\npair of opposites marked by gender: public-private. This binary has\nbeen especially investigated by feminist political theorists but also\nhas considerable significance for philosophy of art (Pollock\n1988). \nFrom the above we can see how the concept of “art,”\nconsidered in its aspect of “fine art,” is a gendered\nconcept that selects as its paradigms mostly works that have been made\nby male creators. Awareness of fine art’s exclusionary criteria\nis evident in contemporary feminist art practice. Mindful of the\neffects that strict divisions between fine art and craft have exerted\nover female creativity, feminist artists who were active in the\nwomen’s movement of the 1970s, such as Faith Ringgold and Miriam\nSchapiro, incorporated craft materials such as fiber and cloth into\ntheir displays (Lauter 1993). Their work employs materials with\ndomestic and feminine associations, calling attention to the\nlong-overlooked labor of women in art traditions that are different\nfrom but no less worthy of attention than the fine arts of painting\nand sculpture. Indeed, craft objects themselves such as quilts are now\noccasionally the subject of exhibits in fine-art museums, another\nrecognition that the problematic distinction between fine art and\ncraft dissolves with changing cultural assessments. These sorts of\nwork suggest that, from one point of view, women have not been so much\nabsent from the history of art, as the history of art has screened out\nmany of the forms to which they have traditionally directed their\nenergies. \nThe area known as “Everyday Aesthetics,” discussed below,\nhas taken up some of these insights and widened the attention of\nphilosophy so that it more readily recognizes the role of creativity\nin domestic life. Perspectives on domesticity and the daily lives of\nwomen have dramatically influenced not only the materials of art but\nalso subjects portrayed. There has been a notable increase of\ndepictions of pregnancy and motherhood in art that manifests feminist\nthinking, for example (Liss 2009; Brand and Granger 2011). Feminist\nand postfeminist art has been groundbreaking in the theoretical\nexploration of the body in its varieties and meanings, including\nsexuality and maternity. (For an example of the tandem work of art and\nphilosophy, see Dorothea Olkowski’s discussion of the art of\nMary Kelly (Olkowski 1999).) The body in art is reviewed in Section 5\nbelow. \nIn addition to principles of selection, another bias infuses gender\ninto the idea of fine art: the very concept of the artist. For much of\nthe modern period, the very best examples of fine art were understood\nto be the creative products of artists with special talent amounting\nto “genius,” and genius is a trait that possesses\nespecially emphatic gender meaning. \nWhile genius is a rare gift, according to most theorists the pool of\nhuman beings from which genius emerges includes only men. Rousseau,\nKant, and Schopenhauer all declared that women possess characters and\nmentalities too weak to produce genius. This judgment represents a\nparticular instance of more general theories that attribute to males\nthe strongest and most important qualities of mind, in comparison to\nwhich females are but paler counterparts. At least since Aristotle,\nrationality and strong intellect have been regarded as\n“masculine” traits that women possess in lesser degrees\nthan men. Women are standardly considered less intellectual but more\nsensitive and emotional. According to some theories of creativity,\nemotionality and sensitivity can be inspirational virtues, and so the\nfield of aesthetics has been more responsive to the positive uses to\nwhich these traits might be put than are some other areas of\nphilosophy. When it comes to genius, however, male artists get the\nbest of both worlds: the great artistic genius is more than\nintellectually brilliant; he is also emotionally sensitive and\nfine-tuned, thus possessing characteristics that are traditionally\nlabeled both “masculine” and “feminine.” \nChristine Battersby has detailed the long and complicated history of\nthe concept of genius, which has roots in antiquity (Battersby 1989).\nBy the time it reaches its powerful Romantic form in the eighteenth\nand nineteenth centuries, it is especially exclusionary of women\nartists. The artistic genius was praised not only for the strong\nmentality that has always been attributed more heavily to men than to\nwomen, but also for a sensitivity and creativity that partakes equally\nof supposedly feminine attributes. Especially in the nineteenth\ncentury, such “nonrational” sources of inspiration were\nextolled for transcending the rules of reason and bringing something\nnew into being. Womanly metaphors of conception, gestation, labor, and\nbirth were liberally appropriated in descriptions of artistic\ncreativity, at the same time that actual women artists were passed\nover as representatives of the highest aesthetic production. \nThe description of genius with feminine images did not serve to bridge\nthe gulf between male and female artists, partly because of the\ndifferent ways that their creativity was conceived. Actual childbirth\nwas regarded as an outgrowth of women’s “natural”\nbiological role; their own particular emotions and sensitivities were\nsimilarly regarded as manifestations of what nature bestowed upon\nthem. Their artistic expression was thereby categorized less as\nachievement than as natural display; consequently the expression of\nfeeling in women’s art was often seen as a manifestation of\ntemperament, while strong feelings expressed in the work of men were\ninterpreted as emotions conveyed with mastery and control. By this way\nof thinking, emotions in women’s art are a byproduct of nature;\nin contrast, the genius of the male artist produces a new creation\nthat transcends the dictates of nature (Korsmeyer 2004: ch.3). \nWhile by and large disparate evaluations of the capabilities and\nsocial roles of men and women have inhibited women’s historical\naccomplishments in the fine arts, they have not prevented them\nentirely. Art and music historians have reevaluated the record of fine\nart and brought a number of women practitioners to the attention of\nboth scholars and general audiences. While there have been relatively\nfew women artists recognized as “great,” they have not\nbeen altogether absent from the historical record. What is more, there\nare certain art forms in which women were the pioneers, such as the\nprose novel. The novel is a relatively new art form in the west, and\nit began as popular story-writing whose market demand also afforded\nopportunities for women writers to earn money. Their works were not\nalways highly praised, for there was a lot of critical disdain for the\nwide appeal of their stories. Some of them, however, such as George\nEliot and Charlotte Brontë, created works of lasting acclaim and\neven earned that contested accolade, “genius.” \nAt the same time, a general skepticism about the soundness of the\ncanon of great arts of the past has informed a good deal of feminist\nscholarship in the critical disciplines, which has reassessed the\nhistorical record in painting, music, sculpture, and literature and\nrevised the canon to include neglected works by women. Rediscovery of\nthe work of women of the past was one of the major efforts of feminist\nscholars during so-called second-wave feminism of the 1970s and 80s, a\nperiod that also saw the founding of women’s studies programs at\nmany colleges and universities in North America and Europe. Especially\nin the early years of such studies, an important goal of scholarship\nwas to give women a fair shot at recognition in order to attain the\ngoal of sexual equality in the arts. As we shall see shortly, this\nproved to be an initial stage in the development of work in feminist\naesthetics. \nThere has been considerable debate among feminist scholars concerning\nhow to assess the values associated with genius and artistic\naccomplishment. Some have argued that the idea of genius itself is\nsuspect because of the great disparities in education available to\npeople, and the concept ought simply to be discarded. In addition,\nvalorizing the accomplishments of one individual perpetuates the\nneglect of joint and communal creativity in favor of a kind of\nmasculine heroism. (In fact, earlier feminist art was often\ncollaborative, an explicit rejection of the idea of individual\ncreativity in favor of joint efforts among women.) Other feminists\ndisagree and have located alternative criteria at work in\nwomen’s achievements, arguing that one can discern traditions of\nfemale genius at work in the body of art produced by women (Battersby\n1989). \nCritical attention to the values surrounding genius and the\nvalorization of individual creativity has occasioned some practical\nrecommendations regarding museum displays and the sorts of objects\nconsidered worthy of public attention. In fact, recent years have seen\nincreased attention to works produced outside the academic fine art\nsystems, including the creative products of under-represented social\nminorities. Hilde Hein pursues this point by suggesting that museums\nmight divert traditional interest in “masterworks” and aim\nat understanding more commonplace objects and their meanings, thus\ninverting the usual hierarchy of values manifest in museum and gallery\ndisplays (Hein 2010). Hein maintains that the nonhierarchical values\npromoted by feminist theory might motivate museums to reconsider their\nvisitors and the objects on display, reducing the distance between\nviewer and object that the concept of the masterwork of genius induces\n(Hein 2011, 2014). Sue Spaid goes even further, advancing a relational\ncollaboration among curators, artists, and viewing public (Spaid 2020;\nalso Reilly 2018). \nThe debate over creativity is a particular entry into broader\ndiscussions over whether women’s art might represent a kind of\n“gynocentric” tradition different from the androcentric\ntraditions of male artists (Ecker 1986; Hein and Korsmeyer 1993, sect.\nII). If this is to mean that the works of women artists always\nmanifest certain feminine aesthetic qualities due to their\nmakers’ gender, then many feminists respond negatively, arguing\nthat other social positions (historical, national, ethnic, racial,\nsexual orientation, and so forth) impose too many differences on women\nto yield any feminine common denominator to their work (Felski 1989,\n1998). On the other hand, some scholars argue that women artists and\nwriters often produce a counter-voice within their ambient traditions\nwhich might be considered to claim its own “aesthetic.”\nWhere one stands in this debate depends much on the scope of evidence\nconsidered relevant to the question (Devereaux 1998). Claims for a\ntradition of feminine aesthetics have been widely criticized for\nessentializing women and ignoring their many social and historical\ndifferences (Meagher 2011). At the same time, as Cornelia Klinger\nobserves, speculations about a women’s art tradition seem, in\nretrospect, to be more sophisticated than the label\n“essentialism” implies, because they move beyond\negalitarian liberalism and recognize the enduring influences of gender\nin aesthetic productions (Klinger 1998, 350; Eaton 2008). As with\nvirtually all philosophical questions, those concerning commonalities\namong women artists are revisited from time to time. (In 2015 a\nconference in Dublin, Ireland, was devoted to the topic of\n“Aesthetics and the Feminine” (Edwards 2016).) \nThe latter perspective characterizes those scholars who defend the\nidea that experiences of female embodiment can be manifest in\ndistinctive expressive styles that yet accommodate difference. The\nmost elaborate theoretical framework supporting this approach is\nprovided by work loosely described as “French feminisms.”\nHélène Cixous famously proposed the notion of\nécriture féminine, positing that the expression\nof women’s lived experience might be impressed in women’s\nliterary production in linguistic styles that offer alternatives to\nstandard objective description and linear temporal development (Cixous\n1975/1981). Although they proceed from varying theoretical\nfoundations, including different interpretations of psychoanalytic\ntheory, Luce Irigaray’s notion of writing the body and Julia\nKristeva’s positing of modes of semiotic expression that escape\npatriarchal symbolic discourse, propose parallel methods to\ndistinguish creativity distinct from androcentric styles (Irigaray\n1974 [1985]). They need not characterize the writing only of women,\nhowever; Kristeva’s theory of the semiotic posits that poetic\nlanguage taps expressive pre-symbolic resources flowing from infantile\nexperiences in the mother-child dyad (Kristeva 1984). With or without\nthe psychoanalytic frameworks employed by their originators, such\nideas have proven fruitful resources for feminist scholars working in\na variety of philosophical traditions. For example, Jane Duran has\nexamined the fiction of writers as different as the British novelist\nMargaret Drabble and the African-American writer Toni Cade Bambara to\ndisclose how expressing embodied experience shares certain traits that\nare manifest quite differently when inflected by race, social\nposition, and cultural legacy (Duran 2007). \nThe critique of tradition that fosters “writing the\nfeminine” proceeds from the discovery of a lack at the heart of\nartistic representation, an absence of voices positioned to express\nthe subjectivities of those who occupy the margins of social power. In\ncounterpoint, Ewa Plonowska Ziarek notes that worlds of art have also\nprovided a wealth of resources to uncover realities of gender,\nsexuality, social position, and race. However, the project of\ndeveloping feminist aesthetics has often been eclipsed by the\npolitical urgencies thereby disclosed, sidelining feminism within\naesthetics and aesthetics within feminism. Ziarek examines the works\nof modernist women writers, arguing that the very artistic form of\ntheir works unifies the efforts of feminism and political practice in\n“complex relations between political and aesthetic\ntransformations, their relation to gender and race differences, and\nthe role of materiality in political contestation and aesthetic\ninvention” (Ziarek 2012a, 392; Ziarek 2012b). \nThe foregoing has reviewed feminist reflections on theories of art,\nnoting how the histories of women in the arts inform contemporary\nfeminist debates and practices. Equally important are assessments of\nthe values that comprise the conceptual frameworks of aesthetics, from\nwhich some of the most influential tools of feminist critical analysis\nemerge. \nA good deal of feminist criticism has been focused on\neighteenth-century philosophy because of the many influential works on\nbeauty, pleasure, and taste that were written at that time and that\nbecame foundational texts for contemporary theories.\n“Taste” refers to a capacity that permits good judgments\nabout art and the beauties of nature. While the metaphor for\nperception is taken from the gustatory sense, these theories are\nactually about visual, auditory, and imaginative pleasure, since it is\nwidely assumed that literal taste experience is too bodily and\nsubjective to yield interesting philosophical problems. Judgments of\ntaste take the form of a particular kind of pleasure—one that\neventually became known as “aesthetic” pleasure (a term\nthat entered English only in the early nineteenth century). \nThe major theoretical concepts of this period are riddled with\ngendered significance, although tracing gender in the maze of writings\nof this time is a task complicated by the unstable role of sexuality\nin theories of aesthetic pleasure. According to its most austere\nanalysis—which came to dominate aesthetics and philosophy of art\nfor a time—aesthetic enjoyment has nothing to do with sexuality\nat all: Aesthetic pleasure is not a sensuous, bodily gratification; it\nis free from practical considerations and purged of desire. The two\nkinds of desire that most interrupt aesthetic contemplation are hunger\nand sexual appetite, which are the “interested” pleasures\npar excellence. Aesthetic pleasures are contemplative and\n“disinterested” (to use Kant’s term from the\nCritique of Judgment, 1790). It is disinterestedness that rids\nthe perceiver of the individual proclivities that divide people in\ntheir judgments and that clears the mind for common, even universal\nagreement about objects of beauty. Ideally, taste is potentially a\nuniversal phenomenon, even though its “delicacy,” as Hume\nput it, requires exercise and training. To some degree, the\nrequirements of taste may be seen as bridging the differences among\npeople. But there is an element of leisure embedded in the values of\nfine art, and critics have argued that taste also ensconces and\nsystematizes class divisions (Shusterman 1993; Mattick 1993). \nEven as theorists extolled the possibilities for universal taste,\nhowever, they often drew gender distinctions regarding its exercise.\nMany theorists argued that women and men possess systematically\ndifferent tastes or capabilities for appreciating art and other\ncultural products. The most noticeable gender distinctions occur with\nthe two central aesthetic categories of the eighteenth century, beauty\nand sublimity. Objects of beauty were described as bounded, small, and\ndelicate—“feminized” traits. Objects that are\nsublime, whose exemplars are drawn chiefly from uncontrolled nature,\nare unbounded, rough and jagged,\nterrifying—“masculinized” traits. These gender\nlabels are unstable, however, for the terrors of nature have an\nequally strong history of description as “feminine” forces\nof chaos (Battersby 1998). What is more, gendered meanings in the\nsublime are intensified by surrounding discourse about the strange,\nexotic, and foreign. Meg Armstrong argues that “exotic”\nbodies become subjected to aesthetic discourse in theories of the\nsublime, noting that Burke singles out the black female body as a\nspecial object of terror (Armstrong 1996). In short, aesthetic\nobjects take on both gendered and racialized meanings with\nthe concepts of beauty and sublimity (Bindman 2002). Moreover, so do\naesthetic appreciators. As Kant put it in his earlier\nObservations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime\n(1763), a woman’s mind is a “beautiful” mind. But a\nwoman is incapable of the tougher appreciation and insight that\nsublimity discloses (Wiseman 1993, Kneller 1993). The preclusion of\nwomen from the experience of the sublime limits their competence to\napprehend the moral and existential weight of the might and magnitude\nof both nature and art. Women’s supposed weaker constitutions\nand moral limitations, as well as their social restrictions,\ncontributed to a concept of sublimity that marks it as masculine.\nDebates over the nature and concept of sublimity gave rise to feminist\ndebates over whether one can discern in the history of literature an\nalternate tradition of sublimity that counts as a “female\nsublime” (Freeman 1995, 1998; Battersby 1998, 2007; Mann\n2006). \nThe careful purging of sensual pleasure from aesthetic enjoyment\nmingles with the paradoxical employment of female bodies as examples\nof aesthetic objects. Among the things that are naturally agreeable to\nhuman nature, Hume lists music, good cheer, and “the fair\nsex.” And Kant states, “The man develops his own taste\nwhile the woman makes herself an object of everybody’s\ntaste.” (Kant 1798 [1978: 222]) Edmund Burke frankly eroticizes\nbeauty when he speculates that the grace and delicacy of line that\nmark beautiful objects are reminiscent of the curves of the female\nbody (Burke 1757/1968). If women are the objects of aesthetic\npleasure, then the actual desire of the perceiver must be distanced\nand overcome in order for enjoyment to be purely aesthetic. This\noutcome is one implication of the notion of disinterested pleasure.\nThis requirement, it would seem, assumes a standard point of view that\nis masculine and heterosexual. But of course women are also subjects\nwho exercise taste. This implies that women are unstably both\naesthetic subject and object at the same time. As a rule, the\nconnoisseur, the so-called man of taste, was indeed male, and female\nbodies—in reality or represented in art—figured among the objects of\naesthetic pleasure. However, women were also participants in the\ndevelopment of aesthetic ideals, and Terry Robinson argues that they\nactively shaped the concept of the beautiful female body (T. Robinson\n2018). \nDisinterestedness has a long history; it characterizes the popular\naesthetic attitude theories of the twentieth century, which argued\nthat a prerequisite for any kind of full appreciation of art is a\ndistanced, relatively contemplative stance towards a work of art.\nSimilar assumptions about the most suitable way to view art lie behind\nthe formalist criticism that dominated visual art interpretation for\ndecades, and that also characterize interpretive norms in other art\nforms such as literature and music (McClary 1991, 4; Devereaux 1998;\nBrand 2000). The value of disinterested aesthetic enjoyment has come\nunder heavy critical scrutiny on the part of feminists. Some have\ndeconstructed this idea and argued that a supposedly disinterested\nstance is at least sometimes actually a covert and controlling\nvoyeurism and as such ought to be abandoned as an aesthetic ideal.\nOthers caution against discarding standards of disinterested,\nimpartial judgment altogether, arguing that such a move relinquishes\nthe important normativity of aesthetic evaluations (Eaton 2008, 2012).\nNonetheless, even if disinterestedness and related standards of\nobjectivity are retained, feminists continue to draw attention to the\nways in which the mere act of looking can manifest relations of social\npower. Anne Eaton proposes an alternative notion of\n“situatedness,” importing into aesthetics a version of\nfeminist standpoint theory to draw attention both to audience\npositions of appreciation and to the perspectives evoked in works of\nart (Eaton 2009). \nCriticisms of theories that mandate disinterested or distanced\naesthetic enjoyment have given rise to influential feminist theories\nof the perception and interpretation of art. The type of art that has\ncome in for particular scrutiny in terms of the implications of\ndisinterested enjoyment is visual art, and a good deal of argument\nabout what has become known as “the male gaze” has been\nproduced by film theorists and art historians, and subsequently\ninvestigated by philosophers. The phrase “male gaze”\nrefers to the frequent framing of objects of visual art so that the\nviewer is situated in a “masculine” position of\nappreciation. By interpreting objects of art as diverse as paintings\nof the nude and Hollywood films, these theorists have concluded that\nwomen depicted in art are standardly placed as objects of attraction\n(much as Burke had lined up women as the original aesthetic object);\nand that the more active role of looking assumes a counterpart\nmasculine position. As Laura Mulvey puts it, women are assigned the\npassive status of being looked-at, whereas men are the active subjects\nwho look (Mulvey 1989). Art works themselves prescribe ideal viewing\npositions. While many women obviously also appreciate art, the stance\nthey assume in order to appreciate works in the ways disposed by\ntradition requires the donning of a masculine perceptual attitude. \nTheories of the male gaze come in several varieties: Psychoanalytic\ntheories dominate film interpretation, (Mulvey 1989, 2019; Doane 1991;\nChanter 2008); but their presumptions and methodology are contested by\nphilosophers more attuned to cognitive science and analytic philosophy\n(Freeland 1998a; Carroll 1995; Cunliffe 2019). Versions of the male\ngaze can be found in the existentialist feminism of Simone de Beauvoir\n(Beauvoir 1949/2011); and there are empirically-minded observations\nthat confirm the dominance of male points of view in cultural\nartifacts without adopting any particular philosophical scaffolding.\nThese theories differ in their diagnosis of what generates the\n“maleness” of the ideal observer for art. For\npsychoanalytic theorists, one must understand the operation of the\nunconscious over visual imagination to account for the presence of\ndesire in objects of visual art. For others, historical and cultural\nconditioning is sufficient to direct appreciation of art in ways that\nprivilege masculine points of view. Despite many significant\ntheoretical differences, analyses of the gaze converge in their\nconclusion that much of the art produced in the Euro-American\ntraditions situates the ideal appreciator in a masculine\nsubject-position. There is debate over the dominance of the male\nposition in all art, for appreciative subjects cannot be understood\nsimply as “masculine” but require further attention to\nsexuality, race, and nationality (Silverman 1992; hooks 1992, 1995;\nYancy 2016). Sometimes a facile reading of the gaze tempts one to\nexaggerate the sharpness of gender distinctions into the male\nviewer and the female object of the gaze, though most\nfeminists avoid such over-simplification. Despite their differences,\ntheories of the gaze reject the idea that perception is ever merely\npassive reception. All of these approaches assume that vision\npossesses power: power to objectify—to subject the object of\nvision to scrutiny and possession. (For example, seeing oneself as the\nexotic Other in orientalist paintings heightens the political aura of\nart produced in dominant western cultures (Al-Saji 2019).) Since\nsocial norms frame and amplify the operation of perception, there may\nbe inflections of gender in the very act of seeing (Tullman 2017).\nExaminations of aesthetic perception have provided theoretical tools\nof inestimable value in calling attention to the fact that looking is\nrarely a neutral operation of the visual sense. As Naomi Scheman\nstates: \nNot only what is seen but what is rendered invisible or shadowy\ndemands additional examination, as with M.G. Davidson’s analysis of\nthe way that photographs of black women subtly train the white male\ngaze and with Paul Taylor’s study of the complexities of the phrase\n“Black is beautiful” (Davidson 2016; Taylor\n2016). Occluding persons from nondominant cultures and social groups\nin visual production can exert powerful political force (Ortega 2019b;\nOrtega, Pitts, and Medina 2019). \nTheories of the gaze stress the activity of vision, its mastery and\ncontrol of the aesthetic object. These theories reject the separation\nof desire from pleasure, reinstating into the core of beauty the sort\nof erotic, covetous gaze that was eliminated from aesthetic\ndisinterestedness. While not all art invites understanding in terms of\nthe gaze, much does; perhaps nowhere is the ideology of extreme\ndisinterested contemplation more questionable than when applied to\npaintings of female nudes, which one feminist scholar argues virtually\ndefine the modern fine art of painting (Nead 1992). Aesthetic\nideologies that would remove art from its relations with the world\ndisguise its ability to inscribe and to reinforce power relations. The\nerotic in art is one of those relations, and denying its presence\ndisguises both its persuasive sway and its aesthetic force (Eaton\n2012). With visual art, those relations are manifest in vision itself:\nthe way it is depicted in a work and the way it is directed in the\nobserver outside the work. Becoming attuned to the prescribed\nviewing-position of a work of visual art brings desire and suppressed\nheteroeroticism into focus and illuminates other presumptions about\nthe ideal audience for art, such as sexual identity and race (Roelofs\n2009, 2014). Depictions of the body in art are continuous with\npornographic and erotic representations, other areas of feminist\ninvestigations (Maes and Levinson 2012; Eaton 2007, 2012, 2017, 2018;\nKania 2012; Shusterman 2021). \nMany of these critical investigations can be ordered into a sustained\ncritique of aesthetic practices, in particular, of what is presented\nin the name of beauty. Of all the concepts within aesthetics,\nfor feminist consideration there is none so central, so contested, so\nrejected, and so embraced as beauty. Beauty is an enormous category of\nvalue, for so many disparate things are beautiful that generalizing\nabout its nature is a formidable challenge. Beauty is among the oldest\nof philosophical value concepts, with Plato numbering among its\nformative theorists. Plato focused on beauty as an abstract form whose\nessence is bestowed on the particular items that instantiate it, and\nin keeping with this foundational model, philosophers have usually\ntreated beauty in the most general of terms. Combined with the modern\nnotion of disinterested attention, this approach to aesthetic value\nseems to aim at the highest level of universality of appreciation. Yet\nat the same time, as noted above, one of the central exemplars of\nbeauty has been the (young, pretty, pale-skinned) female body, which\nexerts erotic attraction and promises satisfaction of physical desire.\nCritiques of the gender-inflection in supposedly neutral theories, as\nwell as its racialized implications, numbered among the early feminist\nrevisions in aesthetics. These theoretical efforts merged with social\ncritiques of beauty norms that circulated in the late twentieth\ncentury. What is more, for some time, beauty was rather sidelined in\nthe art world as well (Danto 2003). As a result, beauty fell out of\nfavor, and for quite a while one could find little original work\npublished on the subject. \nAll that began to change around 1990, and since the turn of the last\nmillennium there has been a veritable explosion of interest in beauty\namong philosophers, artists, critics, and cultural\ntheorists—feminists among them (Brand 2000, 2013; Higgins, Maira, and\nSikka 2017). While some of this work continues to consider the general\ntraits of beauty in art and nature, quite a lot of it focuses on the\nnorms of appearance of the human body, and the “violation”\nof “standard” norms according to race, disability, age,\nhistory, and variant sexual morphologies. Such standards govern not\nonly artistic depictions, but also the way that real people shape and\nreshape their own bodies to conform to reigning standards of\nattractiveness (Devereaux 2013; Wegenstein 2012). Feminists and\ncritical race theorists have been especially mindful of diversity and\nsuspicious of general norms and the harms that they can occasion. Yet\nat the same time feminists have recognized the pull of pleasure and\nthe importance of beauty in life as well as art. Seeking to avoid the\ndogma of universalism, Janet Wolff proposes an aesthetics of\n“uncertainty” that recognizes that norms of beauty are\ngrounded in communities and are thus ineluctably political, and yet\ndoes not relinquish the value of beauty (Wolff 2006). \nSimilar recognition of the potentials for both danger and pleasure in\nbeauty is found in investigations that seek to decenter notions of\nbeauty with reference to race, indigenous people, and subaltern\ncultures (e.g. Brand 2000, 2013, and Felski 2006). Nor is this a\ntheoretical effort alone; artists are major participants in the\nreclamation of beauty that takes as many forms as humanity offers. The\nupshot of this work is not to reinstate beauty back on its abstract\npedestal, but to retain its pleasures while being alert to its\ndangers. As Monique Roelofs observes, “the menace and promise of\nthe beautiful as a bearer of aesthetic value, a dimension of\nexperience, and a category of cultural criticism turn on the ways in\nwhich we may dislocate its relational functioning” (Roelofs\n2013: 73). The functions of beauty include the seductions of\nadvertising, a pervasive social phenomenon that reinforces and\nmanipulates ideals of femininity and thus represents another important\ntarget for feminist examinations (Michna 2016; Widdows 2019). In\naddition, the growing field of somaesthetics has increasingly focused\non the body, the care of the self, and gendered ideals of beauty that\naffect men as well as women (Hyvönen 2020), as well as the\nperformative body in dance (Banes 1998; Bresnahan, Katan-Schmid and\nHouston 2020) and competitive sports (Morgan and Edgars 2021). \nFeminist analyses of aesthetic practices of the past have influenced\nthe production of feminist art of our own times, and the latter in\nturn has contributed to a dramatic alteration of the climate of the\nart world. The changes that have beset the worlds of art in the\ntwentieth century, perhaps most dramatically in the fields of the\nvisual arts, are frequently the subject of philosophical discussions\nin the analytic tradition regarding the possibility of defining art\n(Danto 1981; Davies 1991; Carroll 2000). One challenge to defining art\nstems from the fact that contemporary artists frequently create with\nthe intention of questioning, undermining, or rejecting values that\ndefined art of the past. The early and mid-twentieth century\nextravagances of Dada and Pop Art are most often the target of\nphilosophical inquiries, which seek to discover commonalities among\nartworks that have few to no perceptible defining similarities. \nAs we have seen, the category of fine art has been a focus of feminist\nscholarly scrutiny because its attendant values screened out much of\nwomen’s creative efforts or actively dissuaded their attempts to\npractice certain genres. However, the dissolution of the values of\nfine art long preceded the art scene that feminists entered in the\n1970s. In spite of sweeping changes in the concepts of art and its\npurposes that characterize much art of the last century, the numbers\nof women practitioners in arts such as painting, sculpture, and music\nremained small. Therefore, while fine art may have historical\nimportance for women’s artistic influence, it clearly was not\nthe perpetuating cause of their exclusion from the worlds of art. The\nanti-art and avant garde movements so frequently discussed by\ncontemporary analytic philosophers were just as male-dominated as\nclassical music or Renaissance sculpture. Moreover, values surrounding\nthe artistic “genius” were just as vigorous as ever.\nTherefore, feminist art practices began as activist movements (such as\nthe Guerrilla Girls of New York City) to secure women more visibility\nand recognition in the artworld (Guerrilla Girls 2020). Feminist\nartists not only demanded that their work be taken seriously, they\nmounted a critique of the traditional thinking that lay behind their\nexclusions from the powerful centers of culture. \nFor these reasons, feminist art itself also furnishes numerous\nexamples that subvert older models of fine art, but with added layers\nof meaning that distinguish it from earlier iconoclastic movements.\nBecause of the gendered significance of the major concepts of the\naesthetic tradition, feminist challenges often systematically\ndeconstruct the concepts of art and aesthetic value reviewed above.\nFeminist art has joined—and sometimes has led—movements\nwithin the artworld that perplex, astound, offend, and exasperate,\nreversing virtually all the aesthetic values of earlier times. As art\ncritic Lucy Lippard put it, “feminism questions all the percepts\nof art as we know it” (Lippard 1995: 172). Feminist artists have\nchallenged the ideas that art’s main value is aesthetic, that it\nis for contemplation rather than use, that it is ideally the vision of\na single creator, that it should be interpreted as an object of\nautonomous value (Devereaux 1998). Feminism itself came under internal\ncriticism for its original focus on white, western women’s\nsocial situations, a familiar critique in feminist circles that has a\npresence in aesthetic debates. By the late twentieth and early\ntwenty-first centuries, the energies of feminist and postfeminist\nartists of diverse racial and national backgrounds have made the\npresence of women in the contemporary artworld today powerful and\ndramatic (Deepwell 2020). Self-referential explorations of identity\nand agency—often through performance art—have been led by women of\ncolor such as Adrian Piper, who is also a philosopher (Piper 1996), as\nwell as by lesbian and trans artists whose work gives rise to queer\nfeminist art histories (Jones and Silver 2015). \nIn many discussions of contemporary art, “feminist” is a\nlabel for work produced during the active phase of second-wave\nfeminism from the later 1960s to about 1980. The term\n“postfeminist” is now in use for a subsequent generation\nof artists who pursue some of the ideas and interests of the earlier\nperiod. These terms are far from precise, and there are many artists\npracticing today who continue to identify themselves with the term\n“feminist.” Perhaps an even larger group does not attend\nparticularly to labels, but their work is so provocative about the\nsubjects of gender and sexuality that it has become a focus for\nfeminist interpretation. (The photographic art of Cindy Sherman is a\ncase in point.) \nIn brief, feminist artists share a political sense of the historic\nsocial subordination of women and an awareness of how art practices\nhave perpetuated that subordination—which is why the history of\naesthetics illuminates their work. The more politically-minded\nartists, especially those who participated in the feminist movement of\nthe 1970s, often turned their art to the goals of freeing women from\nthe oppressions of male-dominated culture. (Examples of such work\ninclude the Los Angeles anti-rape performance project of Suzanne Lacy\nand Leslie Leibowitz, In Mourning and in Rage (1977), and\nWomanhouse (1972), a collaboration of twenty-four artists.)\nFeminist artists opened up previously taboo subjects such as\nmenstruation and childbirth for artistic presentation, and they began\nto employ female body images widely in their work. All of these moves\nwere controversial, including within the feminist community. For\nexample, when Judy Chicago made her large collaborative installation\n“The Dinner Party” in the early 1970s, she was both\npraised and criticized for the thematic use of vaginal imagery in the\ntable settings that represented each of thirty-nine famous women from\nhistory and legend (Chicago and Lucie-Smith 1999). Critics objected\nthat she was both essentializing women and reducing them to their\nreproductive parts; admirers praised her transgressive boldness. Since\nthat time, the increasing numbers of artistic portrayals of the female\nbody and its cycles has rendered these subjects less taboo and\ntransgressive, although they remain provocative and sometimes\ndisturbing. Early in his writing of feminist criticism for The\nNation, Arthur Danto characterized such work by feminist artists\nas ‘disturbatory’ (Argüello 2017; Brand Weiser\n2021). \nPostfeminist artists, such as Kiki Smith and Jenny Saville, build upon\nthe efforts of their predecessors in exploring the body, gender, and\nsexual identity. Postfeminist art, often highly theoretical and deeply\nserious, also tends to be playful and parodic in style, such as the\nwork of Vanessa Beecroft. It tends to be less overtly political than\nthe art of earlier feminists. Influenced by postmodern speculations\nthat gender, sexuality, and the body itself are creations of culture\nthat are malleable and performative, postfeminist art confounds and\ndisrupts notions of stable identity (Grosz 1994; Butler 1990, 1993).\nSuch art can be seen as individualistic compared to the social agendas\nof earlier feminism, but perhaps for this reason this sort of art is\nalso more attuned to differences among women. These presentations of\nthe female body tend to draw attention to the position it has in\nculture: not only the sexed body, but also bodies marked by racial and\ncultural differences (James 2010). In the 1970s and 80s,\nCuban-American artist Ana Mendieta produced a series of works making\nuse of her own body to form silhouettes and shapes. All of this\nactivity is theoretically charged and often philosophically motivated\n(Reckitt 2001, Heartney 2013). At the same time, it should be stressed\nthat the kinds of art that qualify to be labeled\n“feminist” are hugely varied and heterogeneous. And as\ntime passes and political climates shift, the interventions of artists\nand their visionary critiques alter accordingly. Twenty-first century\ntheorizing about feminist art now includes acknowledgement of the many\nforms of global feminisms and increased frequency of feminist content\nthat deals with war and politics. Robinson and Buszek offer a\nrefreshed definition of “feminist art” that is not a simple\nclassification of a type of art, but rather indicates the space where\nfeminist politics and the domain of art-making intersect (Robinson and\nBuszek 2019; also Armstrong and de Zegher 2006). \nPossibly there is no topic more discussed in feminist art and\nphilosophy today than “the body.” This interest represents\ncontinued explorations and critiques of traditional mind-body dualism,\nthe role of sexual morphology in the development of gender and the\nself, and the venerable association of women with matter and\nphysicality. All these subjects link gender analysis to the history of\nphilosophical concepts, both in the west (which most of this entry has\nemphasized) and in eastern traditions (Man 2000, 2015, 2016). Both the\nartistic and the theoretical modes of exploration of the body can be\nviewed as complementary elements of feminist aesthetics. This topic\ncovers very broad territory and includes the mutual involvement of\naesthetic norms with ethical judgments; aesthetic standards and\nimplications about bodies that appear deviant from standard concepts\nof “normal”; and the participation of the bodily senses in\naesthetic appreciation (Irvin 2016). \nTo begin with the last topic mentioned above: Both artists and\nphilosophers have reevaluated the senses and the orthodox materials\nthat are fashioned into objects of art. As we saw when considering\nphilosophies of taste and the formation of the idea of the aesthetic,\nthe literal sense of taste has customarily never been considered a\ntruly “aesthetic” sense, its pleasures and mode of\napprehension being too bodily and sensuous to qualify. Vision and\nhearing are the aesthetic senses proper, according to traditional\ntheory. This judgment is under question now, as the senses themselves\nare under reevaluation (Howes 1991). Early speculation about the\npossible gendering of sense experience was ventured by theorists such\nas Irigaray and Cixous, and a number of artists indirectly probe the\nissue by employing foodstuffs as the medium for their works (Korsmeyer\n2004, chs. 4–5). The presence of actual food—as opposed to\nthe depictions of still life painting—in art installations\nconfounds traditional aesthetic ideals on a number of fronts. It\nchallenges the idea that art has lasting value, because it literally\ndecays. And while such art is to be viewed, it synaesthetically teases\nthe senses of taste and smell as well. But it often does so without\nthe benefits that actual eating provides, for art made from food is\nnot necessarily itself a meal. In fact, rather than pleasing to the\nsense of taste, this art frequently trades on the arousal of disgust\nin the sensuous imagination. (Janine Antoni, for example, has\nfashioned large sculptures from lard and from chocolate, employing her\nmouth, teeth, and tongue as the carving tools. Hardly appealing to the\ngustatory sense, this work nonetheless arouses a somatic response at\nthe same time that it invites rumination on the venerable hierarchy of\nthe senses that puts the distance senses of sight and hearing above\nthe bodily senses of touch, smell, and taste.) \nA number of artists today are using food that can be eaten, inviting\nthe public into a participatory relationship with their works (Smith\n2013). The uses of food on the part of female artists are particularly\nsignificant, given the traditional association of women with the body,\nwith feeding and nurturance, and with transience and mortality. Not\nonly these venerable concepts but also the versions they manifest in\nthe contemporary social order are present in today’s art scene,\nsuch as Kara Walker’s 2014 work A Subtlety, a giant\nsculpture of sugar and molasses that explores eroticism, race, and the\nlegacies of American slavery (Davidson 2016). The very presence of\nsuch creations in the artworld today has contributed to consternation\non the part of professionals and public alike about just how art is to\nbe defined and conceived. There is no particular feminist\n“definition” of art, but there are many uses to which\nfeminists and postfeminists turn their creative efforts: exploring\ngender and sexuality as well as criticizing the traditions of art and\nof beauty imposed by aesthetic standards of the past. \nThe sense of taste is but one zone where the aesthetic dimensions of\nbodily sensation are recognized and explored, in dramatic contrast to\nthe traditional idea that aesthetic “distance” is required\nfor the true apprehension of art. Erotic desires, sexuality, and\nbodily sensation in general are increasingly central elements both of\nart and of aesthetic discourse, and feminist investigators have been\namong the important contributors to this movement (Lintott 2003; Lorde\n2007; Grosz 2008; Lintott and Irvin 2016). \nCritical consideration of norms of female beauty and the artistic\ndepiction of women influences the ways that feminist artists employ\ntheir own bodies in creating art (Brand 2000, 2013; Steiner 2001;\nBanes 1998). The work of artists across the globe utilizes bodies in\ndifferent cultural and political contexts, dramatizing the recognition\nprevalent in contemporary feminist theory that there is no such thing\nas the female body, only bodies marked by the differences of\ntheir historical situation, their geographical location, their social\nposition, their race (Hobson 2005; Tate 2009; Roelofs et al 2009;\nTaylor 2016). A wide spectrum of identities and desires are explored\nin text, image, and performance, including sexual\nmorphology—transgender, female, male, intersex. Revaluation of bodies\nwith abilities and disabilities represents yet another way in which\naesthetic investigations have political impact (Silvers 2000;\nMillett-Gallant 2010; Siebers 2010). The most dramatic uses of\nartists’ bodies occur with the relatively new genre of\nperformance art, in which feminists have been pioneers. \nA good deal of performance art has been highly controversial, partly\nbecause of the exposure of the bodies of the artists in ways that not\nonly challenge norms of female beauty but are deliberately gross or\neven borderline pornographic. The art tradition was long accustomed to\npictures of nude females arranged in alluring poses. A performance\nartist who manipulates her body in ways that reverse the values of\nthat tradition confronts the audience with a direct and emotionally\ndifficult challenge to those values. Karen Finley, to mention a\nwell-known case, called attention to the sexual exploitation of women\nby smearing her body with foodstuffs resembling blood and excrement.\nThis is an especially political use of disgust—an emotion that\nin earlier times was explicitly precluded from aesthetic arousal but\nthat has become a major feature of the comprehension and appreciation\nof contemporary art (Korsmeyer 2011). What at first disgusts, however,\nmay come to lose its stigma, and displays of the body are also\ndeployed to induce acceptance. Regarding what at first appear as\ndisfigurements with aesthetic openness can broaden both our\nsensibilities and our social horizons (Irvin 2017; Protasi 2017).\nArtists have contributed to changes in the social imagination about\ngender fluidity. While the concept of the sexed body has seemed in the\npast to be dictated by nature, transgender and non-binary artists are\namong those who challenge the idea that morphology at birth must\ndetermine the course of one’s life (Mostovoy in Brand Weiser\n2018; Vaid-Menon 2020). \nFeminist explorations of embodiment and the deliberate arousal of\ndisgust as an aesthetic response have at least two kinds of political\nand philosophical import. First of all, they invert feminine ideals\nthat frame restrictive norms for personal appearance. This can be done\nhumorously, boldly, sadly, aggressively, casually; much depends on the\nindividual work. There are numerous ways to challenge the traditional\naesthetic values expected in the female body, with disturbing\nemotional effects that make the audience question those values and\ntheir comprehensiveness. In addition, the arousal of disgust often\noccurs when artists move from consideration of the exterior of the\nbody to its warm, dark, sticky interior where unmentionable substances\nare kept hidden away. The deliberate cultivation of that which is not\npretty but is grossly material is the occasion for presenting formerly\ntaboo aspects of bodies: menstrual blood, excrement, internal organs.\nFemale artists are not the only ones who explore interiority and\nmateriality in art, of course. However, because of the traditional\nlinkage of gross matter with the “feminine” (now the\nterrible feminine, not the highly socialized feminine of Burke’s\nbeauty principle), when female artists explore such themes they cannot\nbut allude to venerable conceptual frameworks. This is a complex and\ndelicate territory for feminist investigation: the ancient category of\nthe feminine that includes the element of untamed nature and the gross\nmatter of existence. Feminist uses of these types of objects play upon\nmyths of nature and culture, of horror and sublimity, and of death and\nlife. Rather than keeping these themes in the uncanny but clean realms\nof myth, however, the presentation of entrails, blood,\nand—sometimes literally—flesh confronts the audience with\na particular and disturbing presence of the artist herself. Indeed,\nsuch theorizing extends beyond art into lived reality with\nphilosophical attention to such intrinsically female events as\nchildbirth, a transformative experience in which some theorists find\nelements of the sublime (Lintott 2011). \nThe provocative ideas of French philosopher and psychoanalyst Luce\nIrigaray have provided inspiration for a number of feminist artists\nwho seek to bring forth a “sexuate” perspective in their\nwork that does not borrow from the patriarchal tradition, for the\nlatter, according to Irigaray, has always eclipsed the expression of\nthe “feminine.” The body and its morphology are central to\nIrigaray’s philosophical method, as she insists that sexuate\nbeing pervades one’s existence, and that the pretense of\nshedding one’s sex when writing or speaking in standard,\nfamiliar idioms and syntax causes the feminine to disappear into the\nmasculine/neutral discourse that dominates the patriarchal order. As\nshe puts it in the title of one of her widely-read essays, “Any\ntheory of the subject has always been appropriated by the\nmasculine” (Irigaray 1974 [1985: 133]). One of Irigaray’s\nprojects is to evoke feminine subjectivity that can be represented in\nits own terms, not just as an absence in the symbolic order. While the\nintricacies of her philosophy are opaque and sometimes difficult to\npin down, her suggestive ideas have furnished inspiration for many\nfeminist artists. The psychoanalytic work of Bracha Ettinger\nconcerning subjectivity and gendered consciousness is equally\ndeveloped in her writings and in her visual art and indeed can be\nconsidered as much theory as aesthetic production (Ettinger 2006;\nPollock 2008). \nFeminist interpretive theories include approaches that are both\ncompeting and complementary, and they represent some of the same\nrivalries that are present in contemporary philosophy, broadly\nconstrued. Adaptations of psychoanalytic theory have an especially\nlarge presence in the interpretation of performance, literature, film\nand visual arts. Some feminists employ the discourse of Jacques Lacan,\nwhose concept of the symbolic order has been widely applied to\nunderstand the power of patriarchy embedded in cultural forms of every\nkind (Copjec 2002). Julia Kristeva, who analyzes the artistic\nexperience of “abjection” as a threat to self arising from\nboth the allure and the horror of self-disintegration and reabsorption\ninto the body of the mother, has been especially provocative for\nunderstanding the aesthetic arousal of disgust and the strong sexual\nand gendered elements of horror (Kristeva 1982; Creed 1993, Ortega\n2019a). Far from a mere application of a theory to aesthetics, the\nfeminist uses of abjection have explored and enlarged the concept in\norder to understand not only the psychological development of\nindividuals but also the construction of social and political\nrelations (Chanter 2008). \nThe uses of psychoanalytic theory in aesthetics mark an area of\ncontroversy that is importantly discipline-based. Many philosophers,\nespecially those of the analytic and postanalytic traditions, reject\nthe assumptions required by these approaches as empirically baseless\nand theoretically otiose. They argue that empirical, particularist\nanalyses of individual works have more explanatory power to illuminate\nthe positions that gender manifests in art (Freeland 1998a, 1998b;\nCarroll 1995). Thus differences over interpretive theory represent\ndivisions both within philosophy itself and in transdisciplinary\nscholarship. Debates over appropriate tools to understand the meaning\nof art and the power of culture should lay to rest once and for all\nany idea that “feminist aesthetics” describes a unitary\nset of ideas. \nAs is evident from the foregoing discussion, one can find in feminist\nphilosophy avenues of thought that direct inquiry away from the worlds\nof art and to the presence of aesthetic features in lived experience.\nArt and aesthetic qualities are obviously not merely theoretical\nobjects; they are cultural products with considerable authority to\nframe and to perpetuate social relations and values. Therefore\nfeminist aesthetics contains a component where theories of\ninterpretation are directed to particular works of culture. Such\nperspectives are poised to illuminate the changes in social\ninstitutions that are depicted in popular art forms such as literature\nand film, revealing the large-scale influence that aspects of the\npolitical feminist movement have had over marriage and family\nrelations (S.T. Ross 2016). Aesthetic norms are not limited to art but\nextend into virtually all aspects of life, including dress, personal\nadornment, and comportment. With dress, for example, perceived\naesthetic incongruity has political resonance, as with Muslim women\nwho choose to wear the hijab in countries where such garb has not been\na historical norm (Sheth 2009, 2019). Feminist perspectives extend to\nthe aesthetic frames of lived experience and the subtle forces they\nexert (Archer and Ware 2018). \nThe turn of attention to the body and its appearance, as well as to\ndomestic environments, has contributed to an area of interest loosely\nlabeled “everyday aesthetics.” Scholarship on everyday\naesthetics includes examination of craft practices, which are often\npursued in the home where many women continue to work, and to artistic\ntraditions that do not feature a distinction between “fine\nart” and “craft,” such as the cultural traditions of\nAsia (Saito 2007, 2017; Mandoki 2007; Leddy 2012; Light and Smith\n2004). Cooking, eating, arranging furniture and shelves,\ngardening—all these quotidian activities have aesthetic features (for\ngardening see S. Ross 1998; Miller 1993). Such activities are not\nalways uplifting or even pleasant, but attention to their sensuous\ncharacter, the rhythm they impose on the day, week, or year, and their\nplace in the patterns of life, disperses aesthetic attention to\nregions that are relatively new to theory, if widely familiar in\nexperience. \nFeminist analyses both contribute to the development of this field of\ninterest and occupy a place within it. For example, there is a growing\nbody of philosophy that explores issues about food and eating, which\nare topics that hitherto had little to no position in the field at all\n(Korsmeyer 1999). This new subject has several sources of development,\nincluding feminism, for it can be considered an area of scholarship\nthat has been nurtured by the overall critical questioning of dominant\nconceptual frameworks in philosophy, including those that overlooked\nmatters relevant to the practical and physical realities of\nliving. \nOf special pertinence for topics concerning women and gender in\neveryday aesthetics is the rise of attention to a subject absent in\nprevious philosophies: pregnancy and motherhood—topics also explored\nin contemporary feminist and postfeminist art, as noted above (Lintott\nand Sander-Staudt 2011). The aesthetics of the body here explores the\nmaternal body, its changes during pregnancy, birth, and nursing, and\nthe everyday demands of parenthood, within and among which feminists\nhave explored the beautiful, the sublime, the novel and unsettling,\nthe comforting and tranquil—as manifest in the events and activities\none encounters every day. The area of inquiry here is not the\ndepiction of these subjects in art or literature, or their\ndramatization in theater or film, but the aesthetics of the lived\nexperience itself. Raising children has an inevitable sensuousness\nthat provides its own aesthetic dimensions, and sometimes what is\noff-putting or disgusting to others becomes part of the relationship\nof mother to child (Irvin 2011). Attending to the intimacy of\nsensation and to the presentation of one’s own body serves to\ndetach theorizing in aesthetics away from art worlds and to everyday\npractice, and theory has expanded accordingly. In such ways are\ntraditional philosophical categories modified and adapted as feminist\nperspectives continue to probe the dimensions of the aesthetic. \nThe topics included under the designation “feminist\naesthetics” extend through philosophy, history, critical\ndisciplines, and art practices. Theories of perception, appreciation,\nand interpretation have been developed in all of these areas. While\nmuch of this thinking began with examination of philosophical\ntradition and the conceptual frameworks it affords, feminist\nperspectives have also opened the field in many directions, such that\ntheorizing in the twenty-first century has taken different directions\nfrom the critical perspectives that began to probe gender analysis in\nthe 1970s. Of special note is the diffusion of interests from overtly\npolitical and strategic analyses of women in society and culture, to\nexploration of the variant forms that gender can assume, a shift that\nalso distinguishes aspects of the transition from feminism to\npostfeminism. A wider attention to issues of diverse identity,\nparticularly attentive to racially inflected differences,\ncharacterizes both feminist theory in general and aesthetics today.\nThus feminist work is more and more likely not to focus on women as an\nexclusive topic but to consider other modes of identity as well. And\nfeminists have employed philosophies of divergent stripes in their own\nquests, elaborating and refining them, and—most\nimportantly—formulating ideas that are independent of any particular\ntheoretical allegiances. The changing emphases of feminist\nperspectives in aesthetics and philosophy of art over the last five\ndecades are evident in philosophy, art theory, criticism and\ncommentary on the arts, and in the practice of artists themselves,\ntestimony to the degree to which philosophy and cultural production\ntravel hand in hand, which is an abiding characteristic of the field\nof aesthetics itself.","contact.mail":"ckors@acsu.buffalo.edu","contact.domain":"acsu.buffalo.edu"},{"date.published":"2004-05-07","date.changed":"2021-03-12","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-aesthetics/","author1":"Carolyn Korsmeyer","author1.info":"https://philosophy.arizona.edu/people/peg-brand-weiser","entry":"feminism-aesthetics","body.text":"\n\n\n“Feminist aesthetics” does not label a variety of\naesthetics in the way that, for example, the terms “virtue\ntheory” and “naturalized epistemology” qualify types\nof ethics and theories of knowledge. Rather, to refer to feminist\naesthetics is to identify a set of perspectives that pursue certain\nquestions about philosophical theories and assumptions regarding art\nand aesthetic categories. Feminists in general have concluded that,\ndespite the seemingly neutral and inclusive theoretical language of\nphilosophy, virtually all areas of the discipline bear the mark of\ngender in their basic conceptual frameworks. Those who work in\naesthetics inquire into the ways that gender influences the formation\nof ideas about art, artists, and aesthetic value. Feminist\nperspectives in aesthetics are also attuned to the cultural influences\nthat exert power over subjectivity: the ways that art both reflects\nand perpetuates the social formation of gender, sexuality, and\nidentity, and the extent to which all of those features are framed by\nfactors such as race, national origin, social position, and historical\nsituation. These interests have broadened from early analyses of norms\ngoverning female appearance to include consideration of the disabled\nbody and of transgender identities.\n\n\nAesthetics is by nature rather more interdisciplinary than are some\nother areas of philosophy, for this field articulates with art\npractices and the critical disciplines. Contributions to feminist\nperspectives in aesthetics have been made not only by philosophers but\nalso by art historians, musicologists, and theorists of literature,\nfilm, and performance, and by artists themselves. There are practical\nimplications for the discoveries that emerge from feminist\ninvestigations: analyses of the historical conceptual frameworks that\ngovern aesthetics and philosophy of art help to account for the\ndisproportionate numbers of men over women as influential\npractitioners of the arts, for example. Philosophical theories adapted\nby feminists also have been highly influential in the critical\ninterpretation of art and popular culture and sometimes in the\ndevelopment of contemporary artistic practice. Feminist aesthetics\npursues inquiries and critiques that reach into the values at the very\nfoundations of philosophy, examining concepts that often do not\ndirectly refer to men and women at all, yet whose hierarchies are\nimbued with gendered significance.\n\n\nThe following sections each begin with critiques of theoretical\ntraditions and feminist interventions and alternatives. These\nendeavors lead not only to revisions of philosophical positions but\nalso to the dissemination of feminist perspectives in areas collateral\nto traditional aesthetics. This progression moves historically through\ntopics that have animated the field, from early work to the most\nrecent.\n\nFeminist perspectives in aesthetics first arose in the 1970s from a\ncombination of political activism in the contemporary art world and\ncritiques of the historical traditions of philosophy and of the arts.\nThey have developed in conjunction with the postmodern debates about\nculture and society that have taken place in many fields in the social\nsciences and humanities. These debates often begin with an assessment\nof the western philosophical legacy, a legacy that is nowhere more\nchallenged than in the art world itself. Therefore, the significance\nof many contemporary art movements, including feminist and\npostfeminist work, is dramatized and clarified by understanding the\ntraditional values and theories that they address and challenge. \nThe richest historical target for feminist critiques of philosophies\nof art has been the concept of fine art, which refers to art that is\ncreated chiefly for aesthetic enjoyment. It includes at its core\npainting, music, literature, and sculpture, and it excludes crafts,\npopular art, and entertainment. Closely related to the concept of fine\nart are ideas about the creative genius of the artist, who is often\nconceived as possessing a unique vision expressed in art works. It was\nthe fine art tradition of painting that art historian Linda Nochlin\nhad in mind in 1971 when she asked her famous question, “Why\nhave there been no great women artists?” (Nochlin 1971 [1988]).\nSince the modifier “fine” already contains profound\nimplications for the gender of artists, some background regarding the\nolder history of ideas about art and artists is first needed in order\nto understand the variety of answers that can be provided to that\nquestion. This inquiry also positions us to understand the media,\nsubject matter, and styles that contemporary feminist artists and art\ntheorists have advanced. What is more, examination of the ancient\nroots of philosophy of art reveals a gendered value structure that\npersists to this day. \nThe term “art” has not always served as shorthand for the\nfine arts. Like most of the terms that refer to major conceptual\nanchors of the western intellectual tradition, its origins may be\ntraced to classical antiquity. The Greek term that we now usually\ntranslate “art” is techne, a term that is equally\nwell translated as “skill,” and that in its broadest sense\nwas used to distinguish products of human endeavor from objects of\nnature. The types of techne that most resemble our modern\nconcept of art are those that are “mimetic” or imitative,\nthat is, that reproduce the look of an object or that express an idea\nin narrative or drama. Sculpture imitates the human form, for\ninstance; music imitates sounds of nature and voices or—more\nabstractly—human emotions. Drama and epic poetry imitate lived\nevents. That art’s nature is to be mimetic was widely assumed\nfor centuries, and most commentators, including Aristotle, extolled\nthe ability of the mimetic artist to capture with beauty and skill\nsome truth about life and the world. The Roman historian Pliny the\nElder recorded the acclaim for painters who were able to render their\nsubjects in line and color so accurately that they were\nindistinguishable from their appearance in nature. \nProbably the earliest philosophical discussion of art in the Greek\ntradition occurs in Plato’s Republic. Unlike most of\nhis contemporaries, Plato regarded mimesis as dangerous. The\nRepublic is an extended investigation of the nature of\njustice, in the course of which Socrates and his friends envision an\nideal society that strictly censors and controls art forms such as\ndrama, music, painting, and sculpture. According to Plato’s\nmetaphysics, the abstract world of the Forms possesses a greater\ndegree of reality than the physical world with its changing, unstable\nevents and objects. Hence the more direct the apprehension of Forms,\nthe closer a human mind can approach Truth. Imitations such as\npaintings mimic the mere appearance of physical objects, becoming (as\nhe puts it in Republic X) three times removed from reality\nand the truth. Mimesis substitutes illusion for truth, and it does so\nin seductively pleasurable ways. What is more, arts such as tragic\npoetry rivet attention by engaging powerful emotions such as fear,\nenervating the virtues of a courageous person but paradoxically\npleasing at the same time. According to Plato’s analysis of the\nhuman psyche, the nonrational elements of the soul are powerful forces\nthat might divert the intellect from the cooler apprehension of\nwisdom; thus the pleasures that mimetic art delivers are sufficiently\nrisky that art should be carefully curbed in a well-governed\nsociety. \nPlato’s denigration of mimesis does not seem immediately to have\nanything to do with gender, although his influential system has\nimportant indirect implications that are rife with gendered\nsignificance. In his preference for the philosophical quest to attain\nknowledge of the Forms over indulgence in the pleasures of mimesis,\nfor example, one can see a hierarchy of values that rank the eternal,\nabstract, intellectual world of ideal forms over the transient,\nparticular, sensuous world of physical objects. This hierarchy\nsupports the dualism between mind and body that is deeply correlated\nwith gender asymmetry, and that was a fundamental target of critique\nin the early development of feminist perspectives in philosophy.\nFeminist philosophers take note of certain concepts that appear in\n“binary” combinations: mind-body; universal-particular;\nreason-emotion, sense, and appetite; and so forth—including\nmale-female. These are not merely correlative pairs, they are ranked\npairs in which the first item is taken to be naturally superior to the\nsecond (Gatens 1991: 92). Universality is considered superior to\nparticularity because it provides more general knowledge, for example;\nreason is superior to emotion because it is supposedly a more reliable\nfaculty. Both preferences represent a partiality for\n“objectivity” over “subjectivity,” concepts\nthat have an especially complicated significance in aesthetics. What\nis more, the sorts of pleasures that mimesis arouses are emotional and\nappetitive, appealing more to the body than to the intellect.\nTherefore we can find in Plato’s peculiar assessment of mimetic\narts an elevation of intellect and abstraction over emotion and\nparticularity. While not explicitly invoked, gender is present in\nassumptions of this discussion, because “male” and\n“female” (sometimes conflated with “masculine”\nand “feminine,” though the terms are not synonymous) are\nroot members of the pairs of opposites that have been present in\nwestern philosophy since Pythagoras. While there are no direct\nreferences to women creators in the Republic, this philosophy\nof art partakes of gendered concepts at its very core. The\nimplications of such concepts for artists evolve into explicit form\nwith the genesis of the modern category of fine art and its\ncreators. \nScholars disagree about how to date the rise of the special category\nof arts designated “fine arts” or “beaux\narts.” Some claim that the concept begins to emerge in the\nRenaissance, while others argue that it is not until the eighteenth\ncentury that fine art really firms up as a distinct classification\n(Kristeller 1951–52; Shiner 2001). At this time the idea that art is\nessentially mimetic begins to recede, and it gradually gives way to a\nromantic concept of art as self-expression. The eighteenth century is\nalso the period that produces many treatises comparing arts to one\nanother according to shared principles and, even more importantly,\ndevelops influential theories about a particular kind of pleasure\ntaken in objects of nature and art that becomes known as\n“aesthetic” enjoyment. This type of pleasure was central\nto the theories of taste that characterize the formative theories of\naesthetics. \nThe focus on fine art singles out the purely aesthetic values of works\nof art and positions them so centrally that the very concept of art is\nnarrowed. Art that is appreciated for its beauty or other aesthetic\nvirtues is distinct from the sorts of arts that produce items for\npractical use, such as furniture, cushions, or utensils. The latter\ncame to be designated “crafts,” and while their usefulness\nand skill-requirements were recognized, the making of a craft object\nwas considered decidedly less of an original achievement than the\ncreation of a work of fine art. Artistic creativity increasingly came\nto be regarded as a kind of personal expression that externalizes the\nvision of the individual artist in a work of autonomous value; craft,\nby contrast, aims at some practical function. \nThe significance of the fine art-craft distinction for the assessment\nof women’s creative production is substantial. While there are\nmany objects that are excluded from the category of fine art whose\nmakers are male, those objects of domestic use whose creation was\npredominantly the occupation of women were all marginalized by this\ncategory and its attendant values (Parker and Pollock 1981). Thereby\nthe traditional domestic arts were removed from the history of art\nproper. This historical change suggests one reason that painting, for\nexample, has had so few “great” female practitioners:\nhistorically women’s creative efforts were likely to be directed\nto the production of domestic wares; when these were shunted into the\ncategory of “craft,” women’s presence in the genre\nof visual arts shrank radically. \nWhat is more, the rise of attention to the fine arts gave those arts a\nparticularly public presence. The modern institution of the museum put\npaintings and sculptures on display; the concert hall made\nperformances available to a larger public (Shiner 2001). This is a\nperiod of history when ideas of social propriety were especially\ndivergent for men and women of the middle and upper classes, the chief\nconsumers of the fine arts. While it was considered a domestic benefit\nfor well-bred young ladies to be able to perform music at home for\nfamily and guests and to decorate the walls of the home with deft\npaintings, public exposure of such talents was widely regarded as\nimproper and unfeminine. Therefore, what talents women exercised in\nareas such as music tended to remain in the amateur realm rather than\nbe exerted in the more public professional world that monitored\nimportant developments of art forms. (There are notable exceptions\nsuch as the musicians Clara Schumann and Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, but\nthey are comparatively few.) Thus another reason women artists in many\ngenres take a back seat to their male colleagues is that they withdrew\nfrom or were denied the kind of education and training that prepared\nthem for the exacting standards of the public audience. (Nochlin notes\nhow many women painters were trained by artist-fathers who were able\nto provide them with the kind of training that would otherwise be\ndifficult to obtain; the same may be said of women musicians [Citron\n1993; McClary 1991].) These historical explanations illuminate another\npair of opposites marked by gender: public-private. This binary has\nbeen especially investigated by feminist political theorists but also\nhas considerable significance for philosophy of art (Pollock\n1988). \nFrom the above we can see how the concept of “art,”\nconsidered in its aspect of “fine art,” is a gendered\nconcept that selects as its paradigms mostly works that have been made\nby male creators. Awareness of fine art’s exclusionary criteria\nis evident in contemporary feminist art practice. Mindful of the\neffects that strict divisions between fine art and craft have exerted\nover female creativity, feminist artists who were active in the\nwomen’s movement of the 1970s, such as Faith Ringgold and Miriam\nSchapiro, incorporated craft materials such as fiber and cloth into\ntheir displays (Lauter 1993). Their work employs materials with\ndomestic and feminine associations, calling attention to the\nlong-overlooked labor of women in art traditions that are different\nfrom but no less worthy of attention than the fine arts of painting\nand sculpture. Indeed, craft objects themselves such as quilts are now\noccasionally the subject of exhibits in fine-art museums, another\nrecognition that the problematic distinction between fine art and\ncraft dissolves with changing cultural assessments. These sorts of\nwork suggest that, from one point of view, women have not been so much\nabsent from the history of art, as the history of art has screened out\nmany of the forms to which they have traditionally directed their\nenergies. \nThe area known as “Everyday Aesthetics,” discussed below,\nhas taken up some of these insights and widened the attention of\nphilosophy so that it more readily recognizes the role of creativity\nin domestic life. Perspectives on domesticity and the daily lives of\nwomen have dramatically influenced not only the materials of art but\nalso subjects portrayed. There has been a notable increase of\ndepictions of pregnancy and motherhood in art that manifests feminist\nthinking, for example (Liss 2009; Brand and Granger 2011). Feminist\nand postfeminist art has been groundbreaking in the theoretical\nexploration of the body in its varieties and meanings, including\nsexuality and maternity. (For an example of the tandem work of art and\nphilosophy, see Dorothea Olkowski’s discussion of the art of\nMary Kelly (Olkowski 1999).) The body in art is reviewed in Section 5\nbelow. \nIn addition to principles of selection, another bias infuses gender\ninto the idea of fine art: the very concept of the artist. For much of\nthe modern period, the very best examples of fine art were understood\nto be the creative products of artists with special talent amounting\nto “genius,” and genius is a trait that possesses\nespecially emphatic gender meaning. \nWhile genius is a rare gift, according to most theorists the pool of\nhuman beings from which genius emerges includes only men. Rousseau,\nKant, and Schopenhauer all declared that women possess characters and\nmentalities too weak to produce genius. This judgment represents a\nparticular instance of more general theories that attribute to males\nthe strongest and most important qualities of mind, in comparison to\nwhich females are but paler counterparts. At least since Aristotle,\nrationality and strong intellect have been regarded as\n“masculine” traits that women possess in lesser degrees\nthan men. Women are standardly considered less intellectual but more\nsensitive and emotional. According to some theories of creativity,\nemotionality and sensitivity can be inspirational virtues, and so the\nfield of aesthetics has been more responsive to the positive uses to\nwhich these traits might be put than are some other areas of\nphilosophy. When it comes to genius, however, male artists get the\nbest of both worlds: the great artistic genius is more than\nintellectually brilliant; he is also emotionally sensitive and\nfine-tuned, thus possessing characteristics that are traditionally\nlabeled both “masculine” and “feminine.” \nChristine Battersby has detailed the long and complicated history of\nthe concept of genius, which has roots in antiquity (Battersby 1989).\nBy the time it reaches its powerful Romantic form in the eighteenth\nand nineteenth centuries, it is especially exclusionary of women\nartists. The artistic genius was praised not only for the strong\nmentality that has always been attributed more heavily to men than to\nwomen, but also for a sensitivity and creativity that partakes equally\nof supposedly feminine attributes. Especially in the nineteenth\ncentury, such “nonrational” sources of inspiration were\nextolled for transcending the rules of reason and bringing something\nnew into being. Womanly metaphors of conception, gestation, labor, and\nbirth were liberally appropriated in descriptions of artistic\ncreativity, at the same time that actual women artists were passed\nover as representatives of the highest aesthetic production. \nThe description of genius with feminine images did not serve to bridge\nthe gulf between male and female artists, partly because of the\ndifferent ways that their creativity was conceived. Actual childbirth\nwas regarded as an outgrowth of women’s “natural”\nbiological role; their own particular emotions and sensitivities were\nsimilarly regarded as manifestations of what nature bestowed upon\nthem. Their artistic expression was thereby categorized less as\nachievement than as natural display; consequently the expression of\nfeeling in women’s art was often seen as a manifestation of\ntemperament, while strong feelings expressed in the work of men were\ninterpreted as emotions conveyed with mastery and control. By this way\nof thinking, emotions in women’s art are a byproduct of nature;\nin contrast, the genius of the male artist produces a new creation\nthat transcends the dictates of nature (Korsmeyer 2004: ch.3). \nWhile by and large disparate evaluations of the capabilities and\nsocial roles of men and women have inhibited women’s historical\naccomplishments in the fine arts, they have not prevented them\nentirely. Art and music historians have reevaluated the record of fine\nart and brought a number of women practitioners to the attention of\nboth scholars and general audiences. While there have been relatively\nfew women artists recognized as “great,” they have not\nbeen altogether absent from the historical record. What is more, there\nare certain art forms in which women were the pioneers, such as the\nprose novel. The novel is a relatively new art form in the west, and\nit began as popular story-writing whose market demand also afforded\nopportunities for women writers to earn money. Their works were not\nalways highly praised, for there was a lot of critical disdain for the\nwide appeal of their stories. Some of them, however, such as George\nEliot and Charlotte Brontë, created works of lasting acclaim and\neven earned that contested accolade, “genius.” \nAt the same time, a general skepticism about the soundness of the\ncanon of great arts of the past has informed a good deal of feminist\nscholarship in the critical disciplines, which has reassessed the\nhistorical record in painting, music, sculpture, and literature and\nrevised the canon to include neglected works by women. Rediscovery of\nthe work of women of the past was one of the major efforts of feminist\nscholars during so-called second-wave feminism of the 1970s and 80s, a\nperiod that also saw the founding of women’s studies programs at\nmany colleges and universities in North America and Europe. Especially\nin the early years of such studies, an important goal of scholarship\nwas to give women a fair shot at recognition in order to attain the\ngoal of sexual equality in the arts. As we shall see shortly, this\nproved to be an initial stage in the development of work in feminist\naesthetics. \nThere has been considerable debate among feminist scholars concerning\nhow to assess the values associated with genius and artistic\naccomplishment. Some have argued that the idea of genius itself is\nsuspect because of the great disparities in education available to\npeople, and the concept ought simply to be discarded. In addition,\nvalorizing the accomplishments of one individual perpetuates the\nneglect of joint and communal creativity in favor of a kind of\nmasculine heroism. (In fact, earlier feminist art was often\ncollaborative, an explicit rejection of the idea of individual\ncreativity in favor of joint efforts among women.) Other feminists\ndisagree and have located alternative criteria at work in\nwomen’s achievements, arguing that one can discern traditions of\nfemale genius at work in the body of art produced by women (Battersby\n1989). \nCritical attention to the values surrounding genius and the\nvalorization of individual creativity has occasioned some practical\nrecommendations regarding museum displays and the sorts of objects\nconsidered worthy of public attention. In fact, recent years have seen\nincreased attention to works produced outside the academic fine art\nsystems, including the creative products of under-represented social\nminorities. Hilde Hein pursues this point by suggesting that museums\nmight divert traditional interest in “masterworks” and aim\nat understanding more commonplace objects and their meanings, thus\ninverting the usual hierarchy of values manifest in museum and gallery\ndisplays (Hein 2010). Hein maintains that the nonhierarchical values\npromoted by feminist theory might motivate museums to reconsider their\nvisitors and the objects on display, reducing the distance between\nviewer and object that the concept of the masterwork of genius induces\n(Hein 2011, 2014). Sue Spaid goes even further, advancing a relational\ncollaboration among curators, artists, and viewing public (Spaid 2020;\nalso Reilly 2018). \nThe debate over creativity is a particular entry into broader\ndiscussions over whether women’s art might represent a kind of\n“gynocentric” tradition different from the androcentric\ntraditions of male artists (Ecker 1986; Hein and Korsmeyer 1993, sect.\nII). If this is to mean that the works of women artists always\nmanifest certain feminine aesthetic qualities due to their\nmakers’ gender, then many feminists respond negatively, arguing\nthat other social positions (historical, national, ethnic, racial,\nsexual orientation, and so forth) impose too many differences on women\nto yield any feminine common denominator to their work (Felski 1989,\n1998). On the other hand, some scholars argue that women artists and\nwriters often produce a counter-voice within their ambient traditions\nwhich might be considered to claim its own “aesthetic.”\nWhere one stands in this debate depends much on the scope of evidence\nconsidered relevant to the question (Devereaux 1998). Claims for a\ntradition of feminine aesthetics have been widely criticized for\nessentializing women and ignoring their many social and historical\ndifferences (Meagher 2011). At the same time, as Cornelia Klinger\nobserves, speculations about a women’s art tradition seem, in\nretrospect, to be more sophisticated than the label\n“essentialism” implies, because they move beyond\negalitarian liberalism and recognize the enduring influences of gender\nin aesthetic productions (Klinger 1998, 350; Eaton 2008). As with\nvirtually all philosophical questions, those concerning commonalities\namong women artists are revisited from time to time. (In 2015 a\nconference in Dublin, Ireland, was devoted to the topic of\n“Aesthetics and the Feminine” (Edwards 2016).) \nThe latter perspective characterizes those scholars who defend the\nidea that experiences of female embodiment can be manifest in\ndistinctive expressive styles that yet accommodate difference. The\nmost elaborate theoretical framework supporting this approach is\nprovided by work loosely described as “French feminisms.”\nHélène Cixous famously proposed the notion of\nécriture féminine, positing that the expression\nof women’s lived experience might be impressed in women’s\nliterary production in linguistic styles that offer alternatives to\nstandard objective description and linear temporal development (Cixous\n1975/1981). Although they proceed from varying theoretical\nfoundations, including different interpretations of psychoanalytic\ntheory, Luce Irigaray’s notion of writing the body and Julia\nKristeva’s positing of modes of semiotic expression that escape\npatriarchal symbolic discourse, propose parallel methods to\ndistinguish creativity distinct from androcentric styles (Irigaray\n1974 [1985]). They need not characterize the writing only of women,\nhowever; Kristeva’s theory of the semiotic posits that poetic\nlanguage taps expressive pre-symbolic resources flowing from infantile\nexperiences in the mother-child dyad (Kristeva 1984). With or without\nthe psychoanalytic frameworks employed by their originators, such\nideas have proven fruitful resources for feminist scholars working in\na variety of philosophical traditions. For example, Jane Duran has\nexamined the fiction of writers as different as the British novelist\nMargaret Drabble and the African-American writer Toni Cade Bambara to\ndisclose how expressing embodied experience shares certain traits that\nare manifest quite differently when inflected by race, social\nposition, and cultural legacy (Duran 2007). \nThe critique of tradition that fosters “writing the\nfeminine” proceeds from the discovery of a lack at the heart of\nartistic representation, an absence of voices positioned to express\nthe subjectivities of those who occupy the margins of social power. In\ncounterpoint, Ewa Plonowska Ziarek notes that worlds of art have also\nprovided a wealth of resources to uncover realities of gender,\nsexuality, social position, and race. However, the project of\ndeveloping feminist aesthetics has often been eclipsed by the\npolitical urgencies thereby disclosed, sidelining feminism within\naesthetics and aesthetics within feminism. Ziarek examines the works\nof modernist women writers, arguing that the very artistic form of\ntheir works unifies the efforts of feminism and political practice in\n“complex relations between political and aesthetic\ntransformations, their relation to gender and race differences, and\nthe role of materiality in political contestation and aesthetic\ninvention” (Ziarek 2012a, 392; Ziarek 2012b). \nThe foregoing has reviewed feminist reflections on theories of art,\nnoting how the histories of women in the arts inform contemporary\nfeminist debates and practices. Equally important are assessments of\nthe values that comprise the conceptual frameworks of aesthetics, from\nwhich some of the most influential tools of feminist critical analysis\nemerge. \nA good deal of feminist criticism has been focused on\neighteenth-century philosophy because of the many influential works on\nbeauty, pleasure, and taste that were written at that time and that\nbecame foundational texts for contemporary theories.\n“Taste” refers to a capacity that permits good judgments\nabout art and the beauties of nature. While the metaphor for\nperception is taken from the gustatory sense, these theories are\nactually about visual, auditory, and imaginative pleasure, since it is\nwidely assumed that literal taste experience is too bodily and\nsubjective to yield interesting philosophical problems. Judgments of\ntaste take the form of a particular kind of pleasure—one that\neventually became known as “aesthetic” pleasure (a term\nthat entered English only in the early nineteenth century). \nThe major theoretical concepts of this period are riddled with\ngendered significance, although tracing gender in the maze of writings\nof this time is a task complicated by the unstable role of sexuality\nin theories of aesthetic pleasure. According to its most austere\nanalysis—which came to dominate aesthetics and philosophy of art\nfor a time—aesthetic enjoyment has nothing to do with sexuality\nat all: Aesthetic pleasure is not a sensuous, bodily gratification; it\nis free from practical considerations and purged of desire. The two\nkinds of desire that most interrupt aesthetic contemplation are hunger\nand sexual appetite, which are the “interested” pleasures\npar excellence. Aesthetic pleasures are contemplative and\n“disinterested” (to use Kant’s term from the\nCritique of Judgment, 1790). It is disinterestedness that rids\nthe perceiver of the individual proclivities that divide people in\ntheir judgments and that clears the mind for common, even universal\nagreement about objects of beauty. Ideally, taste is potentially a\nuniversal phenomenon, even though its “delicacy,” as Hume\nput it, requires exercise and training. To some degree, the\nrequirements of taste may be seen as bridging the differences among\npeople. But there is an element of leisure embedded in the values of\nfine art, and critics have argued that taste also ensconces and\nsystematizes class divisions (Shusterman 1993; Mattick 1993). \nEven as theorists extolled the possibilities for universal taste,\nhowever, they often drew gender distinctions regarding its exercise.\nMany theorists argued that women and men possess systematically\ndifferent tastes or capabilities for appreciating art and other\ncultural products. The most noticeable gender distinctions occur with\nthe two central aesthetic categories of the eighteenth century, beauty\nand sublimity. Objects of beauty were described as bounded, small, and\ndelicate—“feminized” traits. Objects that are\nsublime, whose exemplars are drawn chiefly from uncontrolled nature,\nare unbounded, rough and jagged,\nterrifying—“masculinized” traits. These gender\nlabels are unstable, however, for the terrors of nature have an\nequally strong history of description as “feminine” forces\nof chaos (Battersby 1998). What is more, gendered meanings in the\nsublime are intensified by surrounding discourse about the strange,\nexotic, and foreign. Meg Armstrong argues that “exotic”\nbodies become subjected to aesthetic discourse in theories of the\nsublime, noting that Burke singles out the black female body as a\nspecial object of terror (Armstrong 1996). In short, aesthetic\nobjects take on both gendered and racialized meanings with\nthe concepts of beauty and sublimity (Bindman 2002). Moreover, so do\naesthetic appreciators. As Kant put it in his earlier\nObservations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime\n(1763), a woman’s mind is a “beautiful” mind. But a\nwoman is incapable of the tougher appreciation and insight that\nsublimity discloses (Wiseman 1993, Kneller 1993). The preclusion of\nwomen from the experience of the sublime limits their competence to\napprehend the moral and existential weight of the might and magnitude\nof both nature and art. Women’s supposed weaker constitutions\nand moral limitations, as well as their social restrictions,\ncontributed to a concept of sublimity that marks it as masculine.\nDebates over the nature and concept of sublimity gave rise to feminist\ndebates over whether one can discern in the history of literature an\nalternate tradition of sublimity that counts as a “female\nsublime” (Freeman 1995, 1998; Battersby 1998, 2007; Mann\n2006). \nThe careful purging of sensual pleasure from aesthetic enjoyment\nmingles with the paradoxical employment of female bodies as examples\nof aesthetic objects. Among the things that are naturally agreeable to\nhuman nature, Hume lists music, good cheer, and “the fair\nsex.” And Kant states, “The man develops his own taste\nwhile the woman makes herself an object of everybody’s\ntaste.” (Kant 1798 [1978: 222]) Edmund Burke frankly eroticizes\nbeauty when he speculates that the grace and delicacy of line that\nmark beautiful objects are reminiscent of the curves of the female\nbody (Burke 1757/1968). If women are the objects of aesthetic\npleasure, then the actual desire of the perceiver must be distanced\nand overcome in order for enjoyment to be purely aesthetic. This\noutcome is one implication of the notion of disinterested pleasure.\nThis requirement, it would seem, assumes a standard point of view that\nis masculine and heterosexual. But of course women are also subjects\nwho exercise taste. This implies that women are unstably both\naesthetic subject and object at the same time. As a rule, the\nconnoisseur, the so-called man of taste, was indeed male, and female\nbodies—in reality or represented in art—figured among the objects of\naesthetic pleasure. However, women were also participants in the\ndevelopment of aesthetic ideals, and Terry Robinson argues that they\nactively shaped the concept of the beautiful female body (T. Robinson\n2018). \nDisinterestedness has a long history; it characterizes the popular\naesthetic attitude theories of the twentieth century, which argued\nthat a prerequisite for any kind of full appreciation of art is a\ndistanced, relatively contemplative stance towards a work of art.\nSimilar assumptions about the most suitable way to view art lie behind\nthe formalist criticism that dominated visual art interpretation for\ndecades, and that also characterize interpretive norms in other art\nforms such as literature and music (McClary 1991, 4; Devereaux 1998;\nBrand 2000). The value of disinterested aesthetic enjoyment has come\nunder heavy critical scrutiny on the part of feminists. Some have\ndeconstructed this idea and argued that a supposedly disinterested\nstance is at least sometimes actually a covert and controlling\nvoyeurism and as such ought to be abandoned as an aesthetic ideal.\nOthers caution against discarding standards of disinterested,\nimpartial judgment altogether, arguing that such a move relinquishes\nthe important normativity of aesthetic evaluations (Eaton 2008, 2012).\nNonetheless, even if disinterestedness and related standards of\nobjectivity are retained, feminists continue to draw attention to the\nways in which the mere act of looking can manifest relations of social\npower. Anne Eaton proposes an alternative notion of\n“situatedness,” importing into aesthetics a version of\nfeminist standpoint theory to draw attention both to audience\npositions of appreciation and to the perspectives evoked in works of\nart (Eaton 2009). \nCriticisms of theories that mandate disinterested or distanced\naesthetic enjoyment have given rise to influential feminist theories\nof the perception and interpretation of art. The type of art that has\ncome in for particular scrutiny in terms of the implications of\ndisinterested enjoyment is visual art, and a good deal of argument\nabout what has become known as “the male gaze” has been\nproduced by film theorists and art historians, and subsequently\ninvestigated by philosophers. The phrase “male gaze”\nrefers to the frequent framing of objects of visual art so that the\nviewer is situated in a “masculine” position of\nappreciation. By interpreting objects of art as diverse as paintings\nof the nude and Hollywood films, these theorists have concluded that\nwomen depicted in art are standardly placed as objects of attraction\n(much as Burke had lined up women as the original aesthetic object);\nand that the more active role of looking assumes a counterpart\nmasculine position. As Laura Mulvey puts it, women are assigned the\npassive status of being looked-at, whereas men are the active subjects\nwho look (Mulvey 1989). Art works themselves prescribe ideal viewing\npositions. While many women obviously also appreciate art, the stance\nthey assume in order to appreciate works in the ways disposed by\ntradition requires the donning of a masculine perceptual attitude. \nTheories of the male gaze come in several varieties: Psychoanalytic\ntheories dominate film interpretation, (Mulvey 1989, 2019; Doane 1991;\nChanter 2008); but their presumptions and methodology are contested by\nphilosophers more attuned to cognitive science and analytic philosophy\n(Freeland 1998a; Carroll 1995; Cunliffe 2019). Versions of the male\ngaze can be found in the existentialist feminism of Simone de Beauvoir\n(Beauvoir 1949/2011); and there are empirically-minded observations\nthat confirm the dominance of male points of view in cultural\nartifacts without adopting any particular philosophical scaffolding.\nThese theories differ in their diagnosis of what generates the\n“maleness” of the ideal observer for art. For\npsychoanalytic theorists, one must understand the operation of the\nunconscious over visual imagination to account for the presence of\ndesire in objects of visual art. For others, historical and cultural\nconditioning is sufficient to direct appreciation of art in ways that\nprivilege masculine points of view. Despite many significant\ntheoretical differences, analyses of the gaze converge in their\nconclusion that much of the art produced in the Euro-American\ntraditions situates the ideal appreciator in a masculine\nsubject-position. There is debate over the dominance of the male\nposition in all art, for appreciative subjects cannot be understood\nsimply as “masculine” but require further attention to\nsexuality, race, and nationality (Silverman 1992; hooks 1992, 1995;\nYancy 2016). Sometimes a facile reading of the gaze tempts one to\nexaggerate the sharpness of gender distinctions into the male\nviewer and the female object of the gaze, though most\nfeminists avoid such over-simplification. Despite their differences,\ntheories of the gaze reject the idea that perception is ever merely\npassive reception. All of these approaches assume that vision\npossesses power: power to objectify—to subject the object of\nvision to scrutiny and possession. (For example, seeing oneself as the\nexotic Other in orientalist paintings heightens the political aura of\nart produced in dominant western cultures (Al-Saji 2019).) Since\nsocial norms frame and amplify the operation of perception, there may\nbe inflections of gender in the very act of seeing (Tullman 2017).\nExaminations of aesthetic perception have provided theoretical tools\nof inestimable value in calling attention to the fact that looking is\nrarely a neutral operation of the visual sense. As Naomi Scheman\nstates: \nNot only what is seen but what is rendered invisible or shadowy\ndemands additional examination, as with M.G. Davidson’s analysis of\nthe way that photographs of black women subtly train the white male\ngaze and with Paul Taylor’s study of the complexities of the phrase\n“Black is beautiful” (Davidson 2016; Taylor\n2016). Occluding persons from nondominant cultures and social groups\nin visual production can exert powerful political force (Ortega 2019b;\nOrtega, Pitts, and Medina 2019). \nTheories of the gaze stress the activity of vision, its mastery and\ncontrol of the aesthetic object. These theories reject the separation\nof desire from pleasure, reinstating into the core of beauty the sort\nof erotic, covetous gaze that was eliminated from aesthetic\ndisinterestedness. While not all art invites understanding in terms of\nthe gaze, much does; perhaps nowhere is the ideology of extreme\ndisinterested contemplation more questionable than when applied to\npaintings of female nudes, which one feminist scholar argues virtually\ndefine the modern fine art of painting (Nead 1992). Aesthetic\nideologies that would remove art from its relations with the world\ndisguise its ability to inscribe and to reinforce power relations. The\nerotic in art is one of those relations, and denying its presence\ndisguises both its persuasive sway and its aesthetic force (Eaton\n2012). With visual art, those relations are manifest in vision itself:\nthe way it is depicted in a work and the way it is directed in the\nobserver outside the work. Becoming attuned to the prescribed\nviewing-position of a work of visual art brings desire and suppressed\nheteroeroticism into focus and illuminates other presumptions about\nthe ideal audience for art, such as sexual identity and race (Roelofs\n2009, 2014). Depictions of the body in art are continuous with\npornographic and erotic representations, other areas of feminist\ninvestigations (Maes and Levinson 2012; Eaton 2007, 2012, 2017, 2018;\nKania 2012; Shusterman 2021). \nMany of these critical investigations can be ordered into a sustained\ncritique of aesthetic practices, in particular, of what is presented\nin the name of beauty. Of all the concepts within aesthetics,\nfor feminist consideration there is none so central, so contested, so\nrejected, and so embraced as beauty. Beauty is an enormous category of\nvalue, for so many disparate things are beautiful that generalizing\nabout its nature is a formidable challenge. Beauty is among the oldest\nof philosophical value concepts, with Plato numbering among its\nformative theorists. Plato focused on beauty as an abstract form whose\nessence is bestowed on the particular items that instantiate it, and\nin keeping with this foundational model, philosophers have usually\ntreated beauty in the most general of terms. Combined with the modern\nnotion of disinterested attention, this approach to aesthetic value\nseems to aim at the highest level of universality of appreciation. Yet\nat the same time, as noted above, one of the central exemplars of\nbeauty has been the (young, pretty, pale-skinned) female body, which\nexerts erotic attraction and promises satisfaction of physical desire.\nCritiques of the gender-inflection in supposedly neutral theories, as\nwell as its racialized implications, numbered among the early feminist\nrevisions in aesthetics. These theoretical efforts merged with social\ncritiques of beauty norms that circulated in the late twentieth\ncentury. What is more, for some time, beauty was rather sidelined in\nthe art world as well (Danto 2003). As a result, beauty fell out of\nfavor, and for quite a while one could find little original work\npublished on the subject. \nAll that began to change around 1990, and since the turn of the last\nmillennium there has been a veritable explosion of interest in beauty\namong philosophers, artists, critics, and cultural\ntheorists—feminists among them (Brand 2000, 2013; Higgins, Maira, and\nSikka 2017). While some of this work continues to consider the general\ntraits of beauty in art and nature, quite a lot of it focuses on the\nnorms of appearance of the human body, and the “violation”\nof “standard” norms according to race, disability, age,\nhistory, and variant sexual morphologies. Such standards govern not\nonly artistic depictions, but also the way that real people shape and\nreshape their own bodies to conform to reigning standards of\nattractiveness (Devereaux 2013; Wegenstein 2012). Feminists and\ncritical race theorists have been especially mindful of diversity and\nsuspicious of general norms and the harms that they can occasion. Yet\nat the same time feminists have recognized the pull of pleasure and\nthe importance of beauty in life as well as art. Seeking to avoid the\ndogma of universalism, Janet Wolff proposes an aesthetics of\n“uncertainty” that recognizes that norms of beauty are\ngrounded in communities and are thus ineluctably political, and yet\ndoes not relinquish the value of beauty (Wolff 2006). \nSimilar recognition of the potentials for both danger and pleasure in\nbeauty is found in investigations that seek to decenter notions of\nbeauty with reference to race, indigenous people, and subaltern\ncultures (e.g. Brand 2000, 2013, and Felski 2006). Nor is this a\ntheoretical effort alone; artists are major participants in the\nreclamation of beauty that takes as many forms as humanity offers. The\nupshot of this work is not to reinstate beauty back on its abstract\npedestal, but to retain its pleasures while being alert to its\ndangers. As Monique Roelofs observes, “the menace and promise of\nthe beautiful as a bearer of aesthetic value, a dimension of\nexperience, and a category of cultural criticism turn on the ways in\nwhich we may dislocate its relational functioning” (Roelofs\n2013: 73). The functions of beauty include the seductions of\nadvertising, a pervasive social phenomenon that reinforces and\nmanipulates ideals of femininity and thus represents another important\ntarget for feminist examinations (Michna 2016; Widdows 2019). In\naddition, the growing field of somaesthetics has increasingly focused\non the body, the care of the self, and gendered ideals of beauty that\naffect men as well as women (Hyvönen 2020), as well as the\nperformative body in dance (Banes 1998; Bresnahan, Katan-Schmid and\nHouston 2020) and competitive sports (Morgan and Edgars 2021). \nFeminist analyses of aesthetic practices of the past have influenced\nthe production of feminist art of our own times, and the latter in\nturn has contributed to a dramatic alteration of the climate of the\nart world. The changes that have beset the worlds of art in the\ntwentieth century, perhaps most dramatically in the fields of the\nvisual arts, are frequently the subject of philosophical discussions\nin the analytic tradition regarding the possibility of defining art\n(Danto 1981; Davies 1991; Carroll 2000). One challenge to defining art\nstems from the fact that contemporary artists frequently create with\nthe intention of questioning, undermining, or rejecting values that\ndefined art of the past. The early and mid-twentieth century\nextravagances of Dada and Pop Art are most often the target of\nphilosophical inquiries, which seek to discover commonalities among\nartworks that have few to no perceptible defining similarities. \nAs we have seen, the category of fine art has been a focus of feminist\nscholarly scrutiny because its attendant values screened out much of\nwomen’s creative efforts or actively dissuaded their attempts to\npractice certain genres. However, the dissolution of the values of\nfine art long preceded the art scene that feminists entered in the\n1970s. In spite of sweeping changes in the concepts of art and its\npurposes that characterize much art of the last century, the numbers\nof women practitioners in arts such as painting, sculpture, and music\nremained small. Therefore, while fine art may have historical\nimportance for women’s artistic influence, it clearly was not\nthe perpetuating cause of their exclusion from the worlds of art. The\nanti-art and avant garde movements so frequently discussed by\ncontemporary analytic philosophers were just as male-dominated as\nclassical music or Renaissance sculpture. Moreover, values surrounding\nthe artistic “genius” were just as vigorous as ever.\nTherefore, feminist art practices began as activist movements (such as\nthe Guerrilla Girls of New York City) to secure women more visibility\nand recognition in the artworld (Guerrilla Girls 2020). Feminist\nartists not only demanded that their work be taken seriously, they\nmounted a critique of the traditional thinking that lay behind their\nexclusions from the powerful centers of culture. \nFor these reasons, feminist art itself also furnishes numerous\nexamples that subvert older models of fine art, but with added layers\nof meaning that distinguish it from earlier iconoclastic movements.\nBecause of the gendered significance of the major concepts of the\naesthetic tradition, feminist challenges often systematically\ndeconstruct the concepts of art and aesthetic value reviewed above.\nFeminist art has joined—and sometimes has led—movements\nwithin the artworld that perplex, astound, offend, and exasperate,\nreversing virtually all the aesthetic values of earlier times. As art\ncritic Lucy Lippard put it, “feminism questions all the percepts\nof art as we know it” (Lippard 1995: 172). Feminist artists have\nchallenged the ideas that art’s main value is aesthetic, that it\nis for contemplation rather than use, that it is ideally the vision of\na single creator, that it should be interpreted as an object of\nautonomous value (Devereaux 1998). Feminism itself came under internal\ncriticism for its original focus on white, western women’s\nsocial situations, a familiar critique in feminist circles that has a\npresence in aesthetic debates. By the late twentieth and early\ntwenty-first centuries, the energies of feminist and postfeminist\nartists of diverse racial and national backgrounds have made the\npresence of women in the contemporary artworld today powerful and\ndramatic (Deepwell 2020). Self-referential explorations of identity\nand agency—often through performance art—have been led by women of\ncolor such as Adrian Piper, who is also a philosopher (Piper 1996), as\nwell as by lesbian and trans artists whose work gives rise to queer\nfeminist art histories (Jones and Silver 2015). \nIn many discussions of contemporary art, “feminist” is a\nlabel for work produced during the active phase of second-wave\nfeminism from the later 1960s to about 1980. The term\n“postfeminist” is now in use for a subsequent generation\nof artists who pursue some of the ideas and interests of the earlier\nperiod. These terms are far from precise, and there are many artists\npracticing today who continue to identify themselves with the term\n“feminist.” Perhaps an even larger group does not attend\nparticularly to labels, but their work is so provocative about the\nsubjects of gender and sexuality that it has become a focus for\nfeminist interpretation. (The photographic art of Cindy Sherman is a\ncase in point.) \nIn brief, feminist artists share a political sense of the historic\nsocial subordination of women and an awareness of how art practices\nhave perpetuated that subordination—which is why the history of\naesthetics illuminates their work. The more politically-minded\nartists, especially those who participated in the feminist movement of\nthe 1970s, often turned their art to the goals of freeing women from\nthe oppressions of male-dominated culture. (Examples of such work\ninclude the Los Angeles anti-rape performance project of Suzanne Lacy\nand Leslie Leibowitz, In Mourning and in Rage (1977), and\nWomanhouse (1972), a collaboration of twenty-four artists.)\nFeminist artists opened up previously taboo subjects such as\nmenstruation and childbirth for artistic presentation, and they began\nto employ female body images widely in their work. All of these moves\nwere controversial, including within the feminist community. For\nexample, when Judy Chicago made her large collaborative installation\n“The Dinner Party” in the early 1970s, she was both\npraised and criticized for the thematic use of vaginal imagery in the\ntable settings that represented each of thirty-nine famous women from\nhistory and legend (Chicago and Lucie-Smith 1999). Critics objected\nthat she was both essentializing women and reducing them to their\nreproductive parts; admirers praised her transgressive boldness. Since\nthat time, the increasing numbers of artistic portrayals of the female\nbody and its cycles has rendered these subjects less taboo and\ntransgressive, although they remain provocative and sometimes\ndisturbing. Early in his writing of feminist criticism for The\nNation, Arthur Danto characterized such work by feminist artists\nas ‘disturbatory’ (Argüello 2017; Brand Weiser\n2021). \nPostfeminist artists, such as Kiki Smith and Jenny Saville, build upon\nthe efforts of their predecessors in exploring the body, gender, and\nsexual identity. Postfeminist art, often highly theoretical and deeply\nserious, also tends to be playful and parodic in style, such as the\nwork of Vanessa Beecroft. It tends to be less overtly political than\nthe art of earlier feminists. Influenced by postmodern speculations\nthat gender, sexuality, and the body itself are creations of culture\nthat are malleable and performative, postfeminist art confounds and\ndisrupts notions of stable identity (Grosz 1994; Butler 1990, 1993).\nSuch art can be seen as individualistic compared to the social agendas\nof earlier feminism, but perhaps for this reason this sort of art is\nalso more attuned to differences among women. These presentations of\nthe female body tend to draw attention to the position it has in\nculture: not only the sexed body, but also bodies marked by racial and\ncultural differences (James 2010). In the 1970s and 80s,\nCuban-American artist Ana Mendieta produced a series of works making\nuse of her own body to form silhouettes and shapes. All of this\nactivity is theoretically charged and often philosophically motivated\n(Reckitt 2001, Heartney 2013). At the same time, it should be stressed\nthat the kinds of art that qualify to be labeled\n“feminist” are hugely varied and heterogeneous. And as\ntime passes and political climates shift, the interventions of artists\nand their visionary critiques alter accordingly. Twenty-first century\ntheorizing about feminist art now includes acknowledgement of the many\nforms of global feminisms and increased frequency of feminist content\nthat deals with war and politics. Robinson and Buszek offer a\nrefreshed definition of “feminist art” that is not a simple\nclassification of a type of art, but rather indicates the space where\nfeminist politics and the domain of art-making intersect (Robinson and\nBuszek 2019; also Armstrong and de Zegher 2006). \nPossibly there is no topic more discussed in feminist art and\nphilosophy today than “the body.” This interest represents\ncontinued explorations and critiques of traditional mind-body dualism,\nthe role of sexual morphology in the development of gender and the\nself, and the venerable association of women with matter and\nphysicality. All these subjects link gender analysis to the history of\nphilosophical concepts, both in the west (which most of this entry has\nemphasized) and in eastern traditions (Man 2000, 2015, 2016). Both the\nartistic and the theoretical modes of exploration of the body can be\nviewed as complementary elements of feminist aesthetics. This topic\ncovers very broad territory and includes the mutual involvement of\naesthetic norms with ethical judgments; aesthetic standards and\nimplications about bodies that appear deviant from standard concepts\nof “normal”; and the participation of the bodily senses in\naesthetic appreciation (Irvin 2016). \nTo begin with the last topic mentioned above: Both artists and\nphilosophers have reevaluated the senses and the orthodox materials\nthat are fashioned into objects of art. As we saw when considering\nphilosophies of taste and the formation of the idea of the aesthetic,\nthe literal sense of taste has customarily never been considered a\ntruly “aesthetic” sense, its pleasures and mode of\napprehension being too bodily and sensuous to qualify. Vision and\nhearing are the aesthetic senses proper, according to traditional\ntheory. This judgment is under question now, as the senses themselves\nare under reevaluation (Howes 1991). Early speculation about the\npossible gendering of sense experience was ventured by theorists such\nas Irigaray and Cixous, and a number of artists indirectly probe the\nissue by employing foodstuffs as the medium for their works (Korsmeyer\n2004, chs. 4–5). The presence of actual food—as opposed to\nthe depictions of still life painting—in art installations\nconfounds traditional aesthetic ideals on a number of fronts. It\nchallenges the idea that art has lasting value, because it literally\ndecays. And while such art is to be viewed, it synaesthetically teases\nthe senses of taste and smell as well. But it often does so without\nthe benefits that actual eating provides, for art made from food is\nnot necessarily itself a meal. In fact, rather than pleasing to the\nsense of taste, this art frequently trades on the arousal of disgust\nin the sensuous imagination. (Janine Antoni, for example, has\nfashioned large sculptures from lard and from chocolate, employing her\nmouth, teeth, and tongue as the carving tools. Hardly appealing to the\ngustatory sense, this work nonetheless arouses a somatic response at\nthe same time that it invites rumination on the venerable hierarchy of\nthe senses that puts the distance senses of sight and hearing above\nthe bodily senses of touch, smell, and taste.) \nA number of artists today are using food that can be eaten, inviting\nthe public into a participatory relationship with their works (Smith\n2013). The uses of food on the part of female artists are particularly\nsignificant, given the traditional association of women with the body,\nwith feeding and nurturance, and with transience and mortality. Not\nonly these venerable concepts but also the versions they manifest in\nthe contemporary social order are present in today’s art scene,\nsuch as Kara Walker’s 2014 work A Subtlety, a giant\nsculpture of sugar and molasses that explores eroticism, race, and the\nlegacies of American slavery (Davidson 2016). The very presence of\nsuch creations in the artworld today has contributed to consternation\non the part of professionals and public alike about just how art is to\nbe defined and conceived. There is no particular feminist\n“definition” of art, but there are many uses to which\nfeminists and postfeminists turn their creative efforts: exploring\ngender and sexuality as well as criticizing the traditions of art and\nof beauty imposed by aesthetic standards of the past. \nThe sense of taste is but one zone where the aesthetic dimensions of\nbodily sensation are recognized and explored, in dramatic contrast to\nthe traditional idea that aesthetic “distance” is required\nfor the true apprehension of art. Erotic desires, sexuality, and\nbodily sensation in general are increasingly central elements both of\nart and of aesthetic discourse, and feminist investigators have been\namong the important contributors to this movement (Lintott 2003; Lorde\n2007; Grosz 2008; Lintott and Irvin 2016). \nCritical consideration of norms of female beauty and the artistic\ndepiction of women influences the ways that feminist artists employ\ntheir own bodies in creating art (Brand 2000, 2013; Steiner 2001;\nBanes 1998). The work of artists across the globe utilizes bodies in\ndifferent cultural and political contexts, dramatizing the recognition\nprevalent in contemporary feminist theory that there is no such thing\nas the female body, only bodies marked by the differences of\ntheir historical situation, their geographical location, their social\nposition, their race (Hobson 2005; Tate 2009; Roelofs et al 2009;\nTaylor 2016). A wide spectrum of identities and desires are explored\nin text, image, and performance, including sexual\nmorphology—transgender, female, male, intersex. Revaluation of bodies\nwith abilities and disabilities represents yet another way in which\naesthetic investigations have political impact (Silvers 2000;\nMillett-Gallant 2010; Siebers 2010). The most dramatic uses of\nartists’ bodies occur with the relatively new genre of\nperformance art, in which feminists have been pioneers. \nA good deal of performance art has been highly controversial, partly\nbecause of the exposure of the bodies of the artists in ways that not\nonly challenge norms of female beauty but are deliberately gross or\neven borderline pornographic. The art tradition was long accustomed to\npictures of nude females arranged in alluring poses. A performance\nartist who manipulates her body in ways that reverse the values of\nthat tradition confronts the audience with a direct and emotionally\ndifficult challenge to those values. Karen Finley, to mention a\nwell-known case, called attention to the sexual exploitation of women\nby smearing her body with foodstuffs resembling blood and excrement.\nThis is an especially political use of disgust—an emotion that\nin earlier times was explicitly precluded from aesthetic arousal but\nthat has become a major feature of the comprehension and appreciation\nof contemporary art (Korsmeyer 2011). What at first disgusts, however,\nmay come to lose its stigma, and displays of the body are also\ndeployed to induce acceptance. Regarding what at first appear as\ndisfigurements with aesthetic openness can broaden both our\nsensibilities and our social horizons (Irvin 2017; Protasi 2017).\nArtists have contributed to changes in the social imagination about\ngender fluidity. While the concept of the sexed body has seemed in the\npast to be dictated by nature, transgender and non-binary artists are\namong those who challenge the idea that morphology at birth must\ndetermine the course of one’s life (Mostovoy in Brand Weiser\n2018; Vaid-Menon 2020). \nFeminist explorations of embodiment and the deliberate arousal of\ndisgust as an aesthetic response have at least two kinds of political\nand philosophical import. First of all, they invert feminine ideals\nthat frame restrictive norms for personal appearance. This can be done\nhumorously, boldly, sadly, aggressively, casually; much depends on the\nindividual work. There are numerous ways to challenge the traditional\naesthetic values expected in the female body, with disturbing\nemotional effects that make the audience question those values and\ntheir comprehensiveness. In addition, the arousal of disgust often\noccurs when artists move from consideration of the exterior of the\nbody to its warm, dark, sticky interior where unmentionable substances\nare kept hidden away. The deliberate cultivation of that which is not\npretty but is grossly material is the occasion for presenting formerly\ntaboo aspects of bodies: menstrual blood, excrement, internal organs.\nFemale artists are not the only ones who explore interiority and\nmateriality in art, of course. However, because of the traditional\nlinkage of gross matter with the “feminine” (now the\nterrible feminine, not the highly socialized feminine of Burke’s\nbeauty principle), when female artists explore such themes they cannot\nbut allude to venerable conceptual frameworks. This is a complex and\ndelicate territory for feminist investigation: the ancient category of\nthe feminine that includes the element of untamed nature and the gross\nmatter of existence. Feminist uses of these types of objects play upon\nmyths of nature and culture, of horror and sublimity, and of death and\nlife. Rather than keeping these themes in the uncanny but clean realms\nof myth, however, the presentation of entrails, blood,\nand—sometimes literally—flesh confronts the audience with\na particular and disturbing presence of the artist herself. Indeed,\nsuch theorizing extends beyond art into lived reality with\nphilosophical attention to such intrinsically female events as\nchildbirth, a transformative experience in which some theorists find\nelements of the sublime (Lintott 2011). \nThe provocative ideas of French philosopher and psychoanalyst Luce\nIrigaray have provided inspiration for a number of feminist artists\nwho seek to bring forth a “sexuate” perspective in their\nwork that does not borrow from the patriarchal tradition, for the\nlatter, according to Irigaray, has always eclipsed the expression of\nthe “feminine.” The body and its morphology are central to\nIrigaray’s philosophical method, as she insists that sexuate\nbeing pervades one’s existence, and that the pretense of\nshedding one’s sex when writing or speaking in standard,\nfamiliar idioms and syntax causes the feminine to disappear into the\nmasculine/neutral discourse that dominates the patriarchal order. As\nshe puts it in the title of one of her widely-read essays, “Any\ntheory of the subject has always been appropriated by the\nmasculine” (Irigaray 1974 [1985: 133]). One of Irigaray’s\nprojects is to evoke feminine subjectivity that can be represented in\nits own terms, not just as an absence in the symbolic order. While the\nintricacies of her philosophy are opaque and sometimes difficult to\npin down, her suggestive ideas have furnished inspiration for many\nfeminist artists. The psychoanalytic work of Bracha Ettinger\nconcerning subjectivity and gendered consciousness is equally\ndeveloped in her writings and in her visual art and indeed can be\nconsidered as much theory as aesthetic production (Ettinger 2006;\nPollock 2008). \nFeminist interpretive theories include approaches that are both\ncompeting and complementary, and they represent some of the same\nrivalries that are present in contemporary philosophy, broadly\nconstrued. Adaptations of psychoanalytic theory have an especially\nlarge presence in the interpretation of performance, literature, film\nand visual arts. Some feminists employ the discourse of Jacques Lacan,\nwhose concept of the symbolic order has been widely applied to\nunderstand the power of patriarchy embedded in cultural forms of every\nkind (Copjec 2002). Julia Kristeva, who analyzes the artistic\nexperience of “abjection” as a threat to self arising from\nboth the allure and the horror of self-disintegration and reabsorption\ninto the body of the mother, has been especially provocative for\nunderstanding the aesthetic arousal of disgust and the strong sexual\nand gendered elements of horror (Kristeva 1982; Creed 1993, Ortega\n2019a). Far from a mere application of a theory to aesthetics, the\nfeminist uses of abjection have explored and enlarged the concept in\norder to understand not only the psychological development of\nindividuals but also the construction of social and political\nrelations (Chanter 2008). \nThe uses of psychoanalytic theory in aesthetics mark an area of\ncontroversy that is importantly discipline-based. Many philosophers,\nespecially those of the analytic and postanalytic traditions, reject\nthe assumptions required by these approaches as empirically baseless\nand theoretically otiose. They argue that empirical, particularist\nanalyses of individual works have more explanatory power to illuminate\nthe positions that gender manifests in art (Freeland 1998a, 1998b;\nCarroll 1995). Thus differences over interpretive theory represent\ndivisions both within philosophy itself and in transdisciplinary\nscholarship. Debates over appropriate tools to understand the meaning\nof art and the power of culture should lay to rest once and for all\nany idea that “feminist aesthetics” describes a unitary\nset of ideas. \nAs is evident from the foregoing discussion, one can find in feminist\nphilosophy avenues of thought that direct inquiry away from the worlds\nof art and to the presence of aesthetic features in lived experience.\nArt and aesthetic qualities are obviously not merely theoretical\nobjects; they are cultural products with considerable authority to\nframe and to perpetuate social relations and values. Therefore\nfeminist aesthetics contains a component where theories of\ninterpretation are directed to particular works of culture. Such\nperspectives are poised to illuminate the changes in social\ninstitutions that are depicted in popular art forms such as literature\nand film, revealing the large-scale influence that aspects of the\npolitical feminist movement have had over marriage and family\nrelations (S.T. Ross 2016). Aesthetic norms are not limited to art but\nextend into virtually all aspects of life, including dress, personal\nadornment, and comportment. With dress, for example, perceived\naesthetic incongruity has political resonance, as with Muslim women\nwho choose to wear the hijab in countries where such garb has not been\na historical norm (Sheth 2009, 2019). Feminist perspectives extend to\nthe aesthetic frames of lived experience and the subtle forces they\nexert (Archer and Ware 2018). \nThe turn of attention to the body and its appearance, as well as to\ndomestic environments, has contributed to an area of interest loosely\nlabeled “everyday aesthetics.” Scholarship on everyday\naesthetics includes examination of craft practices, which are often\npursued in the home where many women continue to work, and to artistic\ntraditions that do not feature a distinction between “fine\nart” and “craft,” such as the cultural traditions of\nAsia (Saito 2007, 2017; Mandoki 2007; Leddy 2012; Light and Smith\n2004). Cooking, eating, arranging furniture and shelves,\ngardening—all these quotidian activities have aesthetic features (for\ngardening see S. Ross 1998; Miller 1993). Such activities are not\nalways uplifting or even pleasant, but attention to their sensuous\ncharacter, the rhythm they impose on the day, week, or year, and their\nplace in the patterns of life, disperses aesthetic attention to\nregions that are relatively new to theory, if widely familiar in\nexperience. \nFeminist analyses both contribute to the development of this field of\ninterest and occupy a place within it. For example, there is a growing\nbody of philosophy that explores issues about food and eating, which\nare topics that hitherto had little to no position in the field at all\n(Korsmeyer 1999). This new subject has several sources of development,\nincluding feminism, for it can be considered an area of scholarship\nthat has been nurtured by the overall critical questioning of dominant\nconceptual frameworks in philosophy, including those that overlooked\nmatters relevant to the practical and physical realities of\nliving. \nOf special pertinence for topics concerning women and gender in\neveryday aesthetics is the rise of attention to a subject absent in\nprevious philosophies: pregnancy and motherhood—topics also explored\nin contemporary feminist and postfeminist art, as noted above (Lintott\nand Sander-Staudt 2011). The aesthetics of the body here explores the\nmaternal body, its changes during pregnancy, birth, and nursing, and\nthe everyday demands of parenthood, within and among which feminists\nhave explored the beautiful, the sublime, the novel and unsettling,\nthe comforting and tranquil—as manifest in the events and activities\none encounters every day. The area of inquiry here is not the\ndepiction of these subjects in art or literature, or their\ndramatization in theater or film, but the aesthetics of the lived\nexperience itself. Raising children has an inevitable sensuousness\nthat provides its own aesthetic dimensions, and sometimes what is\noff-putting or disgusting to others becomes part of the relationship\nof mother to child (Irvin 2011). Attending to the intimacy of\nsensation and to the presentation of one’s own body serves to\ndetach theorizing in aesthetics away from art worlds and to everyday\npractice, and theory has expanded accordingly. In such ways are\ntraditional philosophical categories modified and adapted as feminist\nperspectives continue to probe the dimensions of the aesthetic. \nThe topics included under the designation “feminist\naesthetics” extend through philosophy, history, critical\ndisciplines, and art practices. Theories of perception, appreciation,\nand interpretation have been developed in all of these areas. While\nmuch of this thinking began with examination of philosophical\ntradition and the conceptual frameworks it affords, feminist\nperspectives have also opened the field in many directions, such that\ntheorizing in the twenty-first century has taken different directions\nfrom the critical perspectives that began to probe gender analysis in\nthe 1970s. Of special note is the diffusion of interests from overtly\npolitical and strategic analyses of women in society and culture, to\nexploration of the variant forms that gender can assume, a shift that\nalso distinguishes aspects of the transition from feminism to\npostfeminism. A wider attention to issues of diverse identity,\nparticularly attentive to racially inflected differences,\ncharacterizes both feminist theory in general and aesthetics today.\nThus feminist work is more and more likely not to focus on women as an\nexclusive topic but to consider other modes of identity as well. And\nfeminists have employed philosophies of divergent stripes in their own\nquests, elaborating and refining them, and—most\nimportantly—formulating ideas that are independent of any particular\ntheoretical allegiances. The changing emphases of feminist\nperspectives in aesthetics and philosophy of art over the last five\ndecades are evident in philosophy, art theory, criticism and\ncommentary on the arts, and in the practice of artists themselves,\ntestimony to the degree to which philosophy and cultural production\ntravel hand in hand, which is an abiding characteristic of the field\nof aesthetics itself.","contact.mail":"mbweiser@email.arizona.edu","contact.domain":"email.arizona.edu"}]
