Until\nthe thirteenth century Augustine’s responses to questions concerning\nfree will, predestination, the nature of goodness, and divine freedom\ndominated moral speculation in the Latin West. For Augustine morality\ndemands the human will’s conformity to the prescriptions of the\nimmutable, necessary and eternal law. Augustine argues in his work on\nfree will that the eternal law “is called supreme reason, which must\nalways be obeyed, and through it the evil deserve an unhappy life and\nthe good a blessed life; and through this law we have derived temporal\nlaws rightly constructed and correctly emended.” The ideals of eternal\nlaw are universally imprinted upon human intellects and are the\nimmutable standards by which human actions may be judged. \n\n\nThe earliest medieval commentators on the Nicomachean Ethics analyzed\nonly the first three books of the work for reasons yet unexplained.\nThe medieval authors of the first half of the 13th century, while\naware of the existence of the remaining books of the Nicomachean\nEthics generally had only the partial text at their disposal.\nAristotle’s discussion of phronesis was mostly unknown until Robert\nGrosseteste’s complete translation of Aristotle’s text and the\naccompanying Greek commentaries appeared about 1248.  During this\nperiod theologians such as Philip the Chancellor and William of\nAuxerre examined the nature of the moral act in their theological\nSummas.  They were instrumental in introducing into moral theory the\nconcept of synderesis which they viewed as an innate human ability to\nrecognize the eternal first principles of moral reasoning.  Rather\nthan leave the guiding principles of human actions to human experience\nthey anchored moral decisions in the eternal law of God.  Although\ntheir interpretation was decidedly un-Aristotelian it did influence\nthe conclusions of later commentators, such as Albert the Great and\nThomas Aquinas.  After the appearance of Grosseteste’s translation\nAlbert the Great composed the first Latin medieval commentary on the\nentire text of the Nicomachean Ethics.  His treatment of the prudence\nas a virtue with both intellectual and moral components, his\nacceptance of universal moral principles in the natural law, and his\nunderstanding of practical reason and its relation to human happiness\nhad a profound effect upon the writings of his student, Thomas\nAquinas.\n\n\n\nWhen one chooses through one’s free will to live ‘honorably and\nrightly’ in accordance with divine law, one can reasonably be\nthought to live a moral life. Despite the human ability to reason\naccording to divine principles, the human condition does not permit the\nattainment of moral perfection through natural means alone. Augustine\nasserts that only through grace, sent freely by God to assist the human\nwill can one achieve true moral goodness. Prudence, which is the\nability to choose good and avoid evil, intellectual contemplation,\nmoral and political virtue, friendship, education and character (all\nessential elements in Aristotle’s ethics) are subsumed in Augustine’s\nmoral theology under the command to love God. For Augustine the\ncomplexity of Greek moral thought can be reduced to the simple rule of\nconformity to divine law.  \nDespite the contributions of Anselm in the eleventh century on\nquestions concerning free choice, divine foreknowledge and\npredestination, and Peter Abelard’s startling assertion in the twelfth\ncentury that morality arises from the agent’s intention alone, it is\nnot until the thirteenth century that a scientific approach to human\nmoral reasoning takes shape. Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics,\nnewly translated into Latin, provide a philosophical basis on which a\nfresh examination of Augustine’s doctrines could be based. The first\ngreat medieval commentary on Aristotle’s ethics, which was the result\nof Albert the Great’s teaching activity at the Dominican House of\nStudies in Cologne, marks the beginning of ‘moral science’\nin the Middle Ages. Albert’s careful exposition of Aristotle’s text and\nhis clarification of the concepts of natural law, moral reasoning and\nhuman virtue, and its influence on his most famous pupil, Thomas\nAquinas, led directly to a consideration of the question of practical\nreasoning in the Middle Ages. \n\nThe notion of medieval practical reason can be investigated in two\nways: 1) in light of the distinction between practical and theoretical\nsciences in the writings of the medieval university masters in the\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries; 2) in comparison to the modern\nunderstanding of practical reason as described by Immanuel Kant. The\nfirst method allows for a strict adherence to the texts themselves,\nwherein the concept of ‘ratio practica’ is strictly limited\nto a type of philosophical reasoning. The second approach permits a\ndeeper philosophical consideration of the parallels between the\nmedieval understanding of the nature of moral goodness and the modern\nview of the will as practical reason. Both approaches are helpful in\ngaining a fuller understanding of the meaning of practical reason in\nthe Middle Ages. \n\nIn its strictest sense the term ‘practical reason’\n(ratio practica) refers specifically to a type of reasoning,\nwhich is analogous to the deductions of speculative or theoretical\nscience. When discussing human knowledge of the precepts of natural law\nThomas Aquinas argues that these commands are related to practical\nreasoning as the first principles of demonstration are related to\nspeculative reasoning; in each science there are certain principles of\ndemonstration which are known in themselves (principia per se\nnota). These principles, which comprise the universal laws of\nmoral behavior direct all subsequent moral reasoning. Thomas bases his\ntheory of correct reasoning on the human ability to discover an\nunderlying order in any field of inquiry. The order of reasoning which\ndetermines metaphysical knowledge is derived from a recognition of the\nprinciple of non-contradiction. Reasoning from the notion that being\nand non-being are contradictory terms, a metaphysician argues for\ncertain conclusions about the nature of being. In practical reason one\nbegins with the principle that all human acts are directed to an end\nand then comes to recognize the fundamental element of ethics to be\n‘do good and avoid evil’: \n\nAlthough Albert sees a closer connection between prudence and practical\nreason than Thomas (“prudence and practical reason have the same acts\nin that reason gives the act while prudence informs the act by reason\nof justice, expediency and honesty.” De bono # 443), Albert\nessentially agrees with Thomas’ description of the method of practical\nreasoning (Super Ethica, VI, 7, pp. 436–437).  \n\nThomas argues from the basic principle that what is a good always\nhas the nature of the end to the conclusion that human beings seek to\ndiscover particular good acts as consequences of the determined end.\nSince practical reason mimics the deductive process of theoretical\nreasoning, the term, ‘ratio practica’, primarily\nrefers to a type of human knowledge. There is, however, a fundamental\ndifference between the conclusions of theoretical and practical\nscience: \n\nSince the goal of practical reason is action not knowledge, the\ntruth attained by the intellect must be caused by its conformity to\nright desire. There can be no necessary science of practical reason,\nsince virtuous activity allows for variety and derivation from the\nuniversal rule in particular instances. Moral matters, which are within\nthe domain of practical reason, are varied and inadequate\n(deformis), and cannot therefore provide the certainty which\nis expected in theoretical reasoning. If we are to have any science of\npractical reason at all, we must be content to apply the principles to\nvarious conclusions and proceed from rough arguments which demonstrate\ntruth in a general way. \n\nThe variety and differences among the will’s acts lead Thomas\nAquinas to use the term ‘ratio practica’ specifically to\ndistinguish the method of moral reasoning from that of strictly\nscientific knowledge: \n\nAlbert argues that despite the similarities in method between the two\ntypes of reasoning, the force of a practical conclusion depends more on\na particular desire than a universal principle. Since human desires\ndiffer so greatly, moral arguments are merely general and imperfectly\nformulated. (Super ethica, VI, 16, p. 491). These distinctions\nwhich are derived from Aristotle’s analysis of the nature of human\nknowledge, do not approach the understanding of science found in the\nphilosophy of Kant. For Kant, speculation does not, and cannot, give us\nknowledge of being, nor should we begin with being as the object of\nscience, as is seen in the medieval principle of existential\nnon-contradiction. Kant restricts speculative science to a\nconsideration of the laws of appearance. Practical science, or\npractical reason, in Kant’s philosophy, however, is concerned with\nfreedom rather the natural good or the human end. Kant’s practical\nreason attains the kind of rigor, based on pure a priori\nprinciples, which would be impossible in the ethics of Aristotle,\nAlbert and Thomas who are content with a science of practical reason\nwhose domain is contingent and changeable acts. The secure foundation\nwhich Kant sought for every moral choice would be considered beyond the\nscope of practical reason as formulated by the medieval commentators on\nAristotle’s ethics.  \n\nDespite their enthusiastic reception of Aristotle’s works, the\nmedieval moralists did not grant him complete authority in moral\nreasoning. The flexibility of Aristotle’s ethics, which Thomas himself\nacknowledges, did not lead medieval writers to construct a moral theory\nwhich, like Aristotle’s, is based on societal norms, tradition and\nhuman actions. The medieval moralists sought a more secure foundation\nfor determining ethical action than Aristotle’s appeal to the man of\npractical wisdom (phronimos). A modern author recognizes the\ntensions that exist in medieval ethical theory when he writes of Thomas\nAquinas: ‘How is it that Aquinas can seem so Aristotelian in his\ndescription of human action and yet be so Augustinian in his insistence\non the need for conformity to the eternal law?’ (Westberg, 34).\nThe answer to this question lies the account of the genesis of the\nhuman moral act and the conditions for its rectitude. Practical reason\nrequires a foundation more secure than the accepted practice of human\nactions. In the search for that basis, Thomas and his contemporaries\nconstruct a theory of practical reason far more complex than the mere\ndesignation of a type of intellectual reasoning; it becomes an account\nof the nature of moral goodness itself. \n\nThe designation of the will as rational appetite, its end as\ngoodness and its relationship to the intellect are well-known features\nof medieval followers of Aristotle and need not be treated at length\nhere. What is of more interest in a discussion of practical reason is\nthe analysis of those first principles which regulate moral reasoning.\nThomas in developing the ideas of his former teacher, Albert, insists\nthat the will must be moved by an end that is perceived as good.\n(S. th. I–II, 6, 1 & 8, 1; Super ethica, VI, 7,\npp. 436–437). More specifically he argues that: \n\nEven though the intellect moves the will by presenting the object to be\ndesired, the will itself has a natural inclination toward the good. The\nultimate human end, or supreme good, is beatitude, the perfect,\nall-encompassing human good. Such a supreme good could never be\nperceived by practical reason as evil. (S. th. I–II, 13, 6\n& 10, 2 ad 3; Super ethica, VI, 17, p. 497). The\ndetermination of the human end as beatitude says very little about the\nfirst principles of practical reason upon which specific moral\njudgments should be based. When the will desires, it seems to want more\nspecific objects than the vague longing for beatitude. Thomas and\nAlbert specify their theory of volition by means of the doctrines of\nnatural law, synderesis, and prudence.  \n\nThe source of the first principles in any science is a critical\nelement in determining the validity and nature of that science. In\nmoral reasoning the origin of the principles of actions not only\nreveals the understanding of the nature of goodness, but directs also\nall subsequent analysis as well. In Thomas’ theory of practical reason\nthe first principle of human actions is that of law:  \n\nThe dictates of natural law have a direct bearing on the\nattainment of human fulfillment.  Despite an overly optimistic view of\nhow Aristotelian happiness leads to eternal beatitude, R. McInerny\n(p. 34) recognizes the connection between natural law and the goal of\nhuman life: “Of course natural law cannot be discussed without\npresupposing what was said earlier about the ultimate end.  The\nprecepts of natural law have to do precisely with the end.  In its\nproper sense, a precept is command to do precisely what will lead to\nan end.” McInerny views the Aristotelian admonition to regard\nbeatitude as possible only insofar as it pertains to human beings to\nbe an admission that the ideal of happiness can only be imperfectly\nattained in this life.  This statement allows for Thomas to subsume\nwhat Aristotle had to say of the good life into a richer vision of the\nultimate goal that overcomes the vicissitudes of life (McInerny,\np. 33). This interpretation is common among those who wish to see an\norderly prgression from the life of virtue to perfect beatitude, but\nThomas’ position is more complex. Thomas’s comments on Aristotle’s\ntext rightly distinguishes between happiness in its essential activity\nand a type of earthly beatitude that includes the benefits of good\nfortune.  On Aristotle’s own position concerning human moral\nperfection Thomas claims that the Philosopher left the question open\nbecause he did not deem it entirely within the sphere of\nphilosophy. The role of prudence in the production of human happiness\nbecomes more restricted in Thomas’ theory than it does in Aristotle’s\nethics, since the prudential person must follow the logical\nprogression from the principles of natural law to the deduction of\nspecific actions.  The freedom of the practically wise person to chose\na life with elements from practical and theoretical activities is\nrestricted by the obligation to pursue the precepts of eternal law\n(Celano, 2007). \n\nAlbert formulates this position succinctly when he says, “prudence is\nregulated by divine and human law.” (Super ethica, VI, 4, p.\n417). While no other law than the dictates of practical reason guides\nhuman choices, the eternal law (lex aeterna) primarily and\nprincipally orders a human being to the end and determines the\ncorresponding means. As a result, acts that are at odds with the\neternal law must always be considered as contrary to the dictates of\npractical reason. (S. th. I–II, 71, 6 ad 3).  \n\nThe insistence upon the binding force of eternal law and the natural\nhuman inclination towards, and participation in, it (which is called\nnatural law) marks a decisive step away from Aristotle’s ethics of\nphronesis. The ground of moral action is no longer thought to\nbe the conformity of conduct to that of an outstanding person\n(phronimos); it is found in an external and universally\nbinding source (eternal law). The process of correct practical\nreasoning is governed, and measured, by the conformity of acts to the\nprecepts of this law: \n\nThe recognition of the principles of natural law allows practical\nreason to demonstrate how a human being naturally participates in\neternal law according to its common principles.  \n\nDeveloping ideas found in Albert’s work, Thomas argues that the will\nmust be determined by its acceptance of the dictates of practical\nreason, which necessarily conform to the precepts of natural law: \n\nThe content of the precepts, the way they are known and their\ninfluence on volition are the final elements in the natural law theory\nof practical reason. The assertion that natural law reflects eternal\nlaw gives little indication as to its specific precepts, but it does\nindicate that according to the order of natural inclinations an order\nof the precepts of natural law exists. There is in a human being, as\nin all other types of being, a primary inclination to\nself-preservation.  It is, however, in the discussions of synderesis\nthat Thomas and Albert most clearly identify those principles which\nare the foundation of human moral reasoning. Synderesis was introduced\ninto Latin by Jerome, perhaps as a variant of the Greek term,\n‘syneidesis’ (insight), and has no meaning\nwhatsoever in Greek. While Albert compares the moral principles of\nsynderesis to the innate natural seeds of law (seminaria\niuris), Thomas defines synderesis as “the law of our\nintellect insofar as it is a habitus containing the precepts\nof natural law which are the principles of human acts.”\n(S.th. I–II, 94, 1, ad 2). In an earlier work Thomas\nexplains synderesis either as a natural habit similar to the habit of\nprinciples, or as the power (potentia) of reason with such a\nhabit. He sees little difference in these two designations, since each\ndescribes the universal natural ability of reason to recognize the\nfirst principles of morality. The parallels to speculative reasoning\nthat marked practical reasoning are also a feature of deriving\nconclusions from the dictates of synderesis. Thomas’ claim that the\nfunction of synderesis is to recognize universal moral laws leaves\nlittle doubt that he understood the first principles of practical\nreason, natural law and synderesis to be the same: \n\nThe specific dictate of synderesis which refers to the eternal law\nis that one must obey God; the primary imperative with respect to the\nnatural law is that one should avoid evil and seek the good. These\nprinciples are obviously not mutually exclusive, ‘but the dictate\nof reason to pursue good is rationally and necessarily derived from the\ncommand to obey God.’ Synderesis is the ability of reason that\nnever errs in the recognition of those universal rules of moral action,\nsince a denial of their universal validity contravenes human reason.\nReason can, however, err in the application of the universal principle\nto a particular action. Moral wrong is then the result of an imperfect,\nor false, deduction from the principle. So properly speaking, error is\nnot ascribed to universal principles (synderesis), but rather to\nconscience which may incorrectly apply a universal judgment. (De\nveritate, q. 16, a. 2, ad 2; Super ethica VI, 7, p.\n441). \n\nThe ability to apply correctly the principles of practical reason to\nspecific acts in particular circumstances is the function of the\nintellectual virtue of prudence, defined succinctly as recta ratio\nagibilium. Prudence “represents the agent’s ability to deliberate,\ndecide and properly to order the process of practical reason to\naction.” (Westberg, p. 187). Prudence does not, however, direct the\nwill infallibly to right conclusions. Since it merely directs choices,\nbut does not determine them, the will can be said to remain free.\nThomas argues that the will can choose freely in three ways, although\nit could never express a desire contrary to the primary moral rule of\npursuing good. The will can be mistaken 1) with respect to its own act\nin that it can either will or not will; 2) with respect to its object\nin that it can either want or not want a particular thing; 3) with\nrespect to what is ordered to the end insofar as it wills a particular\ngood or evil act. (De veritate, q. 16, a. 2, ad 2 & q. 16,\na. 1). Thomas’ description of the will’s freedom seems at times to be\noverwhelmed by his insistence upon the will’s determination by the\nhuman intellect. This theory of freedom seems to consist merely in the\nhuman tendency for faulty reason, since both Albert and Thomas think it\nunlikely, or even impossible, for a human being to choose contrary to\nknowledge of the first principles and their application to particular\ncircumstances: \n\nFor Albert the delight that arises from intemperate desire does not\ncorrupt the natural habit of prudence, but rather its rule, when\nprudence fails in drawing the proper moral conclusion. In other words,\nno one can act contrary to the universal principles of morality, but\nonly in their particular application. (Super ethica, VI, 7, p.\n441).  \n\nAccording to these views human freedom could never lead a human\nbeing to act contrary to his own interests. To choose against the\nprinciples of natural law would not constitute freedom, but rather\nfoolishness. Although the will’s natural inclination to pursue the good\npresented by the intellect does not compel the will to act, the\nmoralists of the natural law theory think it psychologically impossible\nto choose something incompatible with a properly deduced conclusion of\npractical reason: \n\nThe ethics of natural law, with its impressive union of the Augustinian\ntheory of eternal principles and the Aristotelian method of moral\nreasoning, did not remain long unchallenged. Franciscan theologians,\nJohn Duns Scotus and William of Ockham, were especially critical of a\ntheory which they considered too restrictive of human freedom. Although\nScotus and Ockham never produced treatises specifically devoted to\nmoral theory, the main lines of their critiques may be sketched from\ntheir theological works.  \n\nScotus’ main concern in his arguments against the intellectualism of\nAlbert’s and Thomas’ ethics is his doctrine of the supremacy and\nfreedom of the human will. He claims that there could be no basis for\njudging an action right or wrong if the will were not free to choose\nagainst the dictates of the intellect. The will, even if it should act\n‘with reason’ still is able to choose between opposite\ncourses of action that lie within its power; the intellect however, has\nno power of self-determination, since it must assent to what it\nrecognizes as true. Only the will acts freely, for it has the power of\nself-determination. Scotus argues that a theory of practical reason in\nwhich judgments about actions were restricted to the type of reasoning\ncharacteristic of speculation not only restricts freedom, but also\nremoves any basis for merit or blame. If the moral agent must act in\naccordance with intellectual deduction, then he can only be praised for\nhis intellectual prowess, and not for his moral goodness. \n\nScotus is influenced by Aristotle’s assertion that the end of\npractical knowledge is truth in agreement with right desire. For Scotus\nthis philosophical expression of the natural law leads him to assert\none fundamental universal moral principle: ‘God should be\nloved’. This law is so deeply rooted in human reason that even\nGod’s power cannot release a human being from its obligations. This\nprinciple allows Scotus to view his moral theology as consistent with\nAristotle’s ethics, since reason leads man to obey God’s commands. The\nwill necessarily and perpetually seeks happiness and the will naturally\ndesires its own perfection. The primary universal command informs the\nwill’s natural desire for perfection, and so particular actions,\nregardless of circumstances, are judged in accordance with the will’s\nconformity to the precept to love God. \n\nScotus’ primary consideration as a moral theologian is the nature of\nfreely determined volitional choices. Only secondarily does he consider\nthe goodness of the desired end of the action. When the will freely\nchooses in accordance with right reason only then can the act be\nconsidered morally good. Scotus does have some difficulty explaining\nthe relationship between the will and the intellect. If a human being\nrealizes intellectually that the most desirable goal is union with God,\nit seems that human intellectual reason would compel him to pursue such\nan end. If the will does not act in agreement with the rationally\nderived first principle then it must be necessarily wrong. It is\nthereby difficult to see how the will’s absolute freedom can be\nmaintained. \n\nFaced with such a dilemma, Scotus argues that although the will\npursues an object rationally determined by the intellect, this does not\nmean that the will is conditioned by ‘natural necessity’.\nThe apprehension of a possible action is offered to the will as\nsomething neutral, while the will remains always free.\n(Ordinatio, IV, d. 46). In Scotus’ view the natural law is\ncomprised of self-evident a priori principles, whose validity\nthe intellect immediately recognizes from the coherence of terms. The\nwill then is naturally inclined to assent to their dictates, but is not\ncompelled to do so. For Scotus the clearest expression of natural law\nis the decalogue, which directs all human actions towards the\nattainment of beatitude. The commands of natural law are not good\nmerely because they are commanded, but are commanded because they are\ngood. (Ordinatio IV, 17) Scotus considers the first two\ncommandments, that God must be worshipped and revered, to be absolutely\nunalterable. God himself could never negate such moral principles and\nhuman beings are morally bound to their adherence. \n\nDespite his unrelenting criticisms of many of Scotus’ positions,\nWilliam of Ockham’s moral theology develops, rather than dismisses, the\nmain lines of Scotus’ ethical deliberations. Ockham too is concerned\nprimarily with the preservation of volitional freedom, both divine and\nhuman. Ockham specifically rejects the theory of natural law for\ndetermining human acts invariably toward an intellectually determined\nend. His insistence upon the dignity of human nature and the absolute\npower of the will for self-determination leads Ockham to reject his\npredecessors’ morality of natural law. Ockham’s critique of the\nmetaphysics of common nature was not limited to logical and\nmetaphysical speculation; it pertains also to his moral doctrine,\nwherein the will must be free even to choose ‘evil which is\nneither really or apparently good.’ \n\nThe autonomy of the will is so great that it can absolutely refuse\nto pursue beatitude even when it is presented either as a general or\nparticular idea. Even after death (in patria) the will can\nrefuse to desire its own perfection. Volitional freedom is absolute in\nOckham’s moral theology; it can be defined as a natural inclination to\nan end, only insofar as it is an observed general human tendency. The\nhuman will can just as easily reject its end, as it can pursue it.\n(Ordinatio I, d. 1, q. 6). \n\nThe natural foundation of morality, so essential to Albert and\nThomas and still an important element of Scotus’ thought, is rejected\nby Ockham in favor of a more complete notion of volitional freedom.\nStill Ockham does not advocate an ethics of relativism. The basis for\nhuman moral judgments lies in the will’s conformity to divine commands.\nImpressed by Scotus’ dictum, ‘Deus nullius est debitor’\n(God is indebted to no one), Ockham extends the power of God to\nreformulate all moral laws. Not only can the commandments that regulate\nhuman interactions be altered, but also those that determine the\nrelationship between God and man. God could command human beings to\nhate him and such a precept must be considered as morally binding.\nOckham’s use of the more common language of medieval moral theory does\nnot prevent him from emphasizing the contingency of human morality. His\nbelief in the power of human reason to discern the rational principles\nof an ordered life cannot overcome his desire to preserve the unlimited\npower of God, on whose will all moral principles depends and are\nsubject to change. Both Scotus and Ockham construct a moral theory of\nvolitional freedom, rather than one that they believe to be the moral\ndeterminism of Aristotle and his followers. \n\nThe question remains as to how the doctrine of practical wisdom\nrelates to the general moral theory of medieval thinkers. Writers such\nas Eckhart and Taler rejected Aristotelian virtues in favor of more\nreligious ones, acceptance (Gelassenheit) and detachment\n(Abgeschiedenheit), but even Thomas Aquinas had difficulty\nincorporating the rational theory of practical wisdom into his overall\nunderstanding of the moral life. Confronted with the conflicting claims\nof Aristotelian Ethics and the Augustinian doctrine of grace, he\nasserts in a sermon to young Dominicans: \n\nWhen faced with a clear choice between the two often conflicting\nmoral doctrines Thomas, like his contemporaries, preferred the\nreligious doctrines to the rationally based ethics of practical\nwisdom. \n\nThe earliest thirteenth-century interpretations of Aristotle’s notion\npractical wisdom emphasized the intellectual nature of moral virtue.\nThe pre-1250 commentators on the NE understood phronesis  as\na means whereby a human being could be united to the supreme good,\nhappiness.  These early interpreters of Aristotle made the moral life\nan essentially passive one, in that the  felix  is elevated\nto happiness by divine causality.  With the appearance of the work of\nRobert Kilwardby, Albert the Great, and Thomas Aquinas a deeper\nunderstanding of Aristotle’s moral thought infused the commentaries of\nthe second half of the thirteenth century.  These thinkers, however,\nwere also troubled by the relation between felicitas and\nprudentia. \n\nThomas follows the lines sketched by his former teacher, and\ntransforms the nature of Aristotelian ethics into a moral doctrine\nthat is more easily aligned with Christian moral theology. Albert and\nThomas were not content with the unspecified nature of the principles\nof the moral syllogism as described by Aristotle.  They left the\nformal structure of the Aristotelian moral act the same, but altered\nthe content by adding the specific formulations of the fundamental\nprinciples of natural law that direct all action toward the human\ngood.  The moral agent is no longer free to determine from the\nobservation of customs and practices the principles of actions that\ndirect the practical syllogism.  The precepts of natural law, which\nare recognized through the natural power (Albert), or the natural\nhabit (Thomas), of synderesis, ensure a universally binding\ncode of conduct.  Prudence becomes a mechanism whereby one deduces\nspecific actions from determined laws.  The science of morality\nbecomes closer to speculative theory because of the unerring process\nof determining singular decisions from universal commands.  The\nFranciscan critics of the intellectualism of the Dominican\ncommentators on Aristotle emphasized the volitional nature of the\nwill’s desire for goodness.  Despite their agreement that all human\nmoral actions lead ultimately to union with God, the commentators\ndiffer upon the natural moral means by which such a union is\ncaused. \n\nThe final question remains: can the medieval explanations of\npractical reason be aligned with Kant’s description of practical\nreason? Kant’s well known definition of practical reason is: \n\nFor Kant the aim of moral philosophy is to discover ideas and\nprinciples that would constitute as pure a concept of will as possible\nand not to determine the actions and conditions of willing, which are\nmainly the concerns of psychology (Grundlegung, Intro., XII).\nThe good will is good not through its result or its capacity to attain\na predetermined end, but only by means of the willing itself.\n(Grundlegung, I, 3). The will’s ability for self-determination\naccording to universally binding laws conveys the objectivity demanded\nby the proper concept of reason. Since a rational nature declares\nitself by the self-imposition of the end, morality is the relationship\nof actions to the autonomy of the will; and this autonomy is the\nrelation of the will to the most universal mandating\n(Gesetzgebung) possible. (Grundlegung, II, 83 &\n85–86). The will purified of any inclination and desire for an ulterior\nend is the proper matter for practical reason.  \n\nThe differences between Kantian and medieval theories of practical\nreason are obvious even from such a short description of their\nelements. The adherence of Albert and Thomas to the Greek view of human\nnature led them to their conviction of the will’s natural inclination\ntoward the good. Such a notion permits Thomas to advise us to seek\nnaturally what is useful to us. (De veritate, q. 24, a. 8).\nWhat is truly advantageous to human beings must always be conducive to\nattaining the human end, beatitude; utility in this sense will always\nbe a reliable guide to correct moral choice. Thomas claims that every\nthing to which man has a natural inclination human reason apprehends as\ngood. For Kant human beings cannot be permitted to pursue their\ninclinations which are to be viewed as subjective desires. Such desires\nlead to moral error at least as often as they produce right action. The\nobjectivity of the pure concept of the human will precludes the\nrecognition of human inclination as a measure of human goodness. \n\nDespite their insistence upon volitional freedom, which in some\naspects anticipates Kant’s thought, Scotus and Ockham argue that the\ntrue measure of morality lies in the conformity of the human will with\nthe commands of God. Such precepts may change if God so desires and so\nScotus and Ockham produce an ethics quite different in spirit from that\nof Kant’s theory of universal imperatives. Ockham in his rejection of\nthe intellectual basis for morality argues that an act in total\nconformity with right reason may not be virtuous, since God could\npossibly create such an act without human volitional consent. The act\nwould be completely rational and in conformity with divine commands,\nbut would lack any merit or virtue. For Ockham the goodness of any\naction lies completely in the will’s desire to obey divine commands\n(De connexione virtutum, III, 11). When Kant describes\npractical reason as a necessary law for all rational beings, whose\nactions are always to be judged according to maxims completely bound to\nthe concept of the will of a rational being, one may see parallels to\nthe Franciscan doctrine of the autonomy of the will. As Thomas and\nAlbert describe the genesis of moral action as a process in which\npractical reason has the ability to accept, understand and obey the\nprinciples of a universal law consonant with human nature, they\napproach Kant’s description of the dignity of the will more closely\nthan those who insist upon the necessity for adherence to the possibly\narbitrary precepts of God. Practical reason as the desire for the good\nas good, as expressed in the first principle of natural law or\nobedience to divine commands, and the conformity of the will through\nfree choice to the universally binding principles of practical reason\nindicate that in some important elements of their moral theories\nmedieval philosophers approach the spirit of Kant as they move away\nfrom the legacy of Aristotle.","contact.mail":"acelano@stonehill.edu","contact.domain":"stonehill.edu"}]
