On the epiphenomenalist view, mental\nevents play no causal role in this process. Huxley (1874), who held\nthe view, compared mental events to a steam whistle that contributes\nnothing to the work of a locomotive. James (1879), who rejected the\nview, characterized epiphenomenalists’ mental events as not\naffecting the brain activity that produces them “any more than a\nshadow reacts upon the steps of the traveller whom it\naccompanies”. \n\n\nAncient theories of the soul gave rise to debates among\nAristotle’s successors that have a strong resemblance to some\ncontemporary discussions of the efficacy of mental events (Caston,\n1997). The modern discussion of epiphenomenalism, however, traces back\nto a 19th century context, in which a dualistic view of mental events\nwas assumed to be correct. The first part of our discussion —\nTraditional Arguments — will be phrased in a style that reflects\nthis dualistic presupposition. By contrast, many contemporary\ndiscussions work within a background assumption of the preferability\nof materialist monism. One might have supposed that this position\nwould have put an end to the need to investigate epiphenomenalism;\nbut, as we shall see under Arguments in the Age of Materialism, such a\nsupposition is far from being the case. A brief outline of both\ndiscussions follows.\n\nMany philosophers recognize a distinction between two kinds of mental\nevents. (A) The first goes by many names, e.g., phenomenal\nexperiences, occurrences of qualitative consciousness, the\nwhat-it-is-like of experience,\n qualia.\n Pains, afterimages, and tastes can serve as examples. (B) Mental\nevents of the second kind are occurrent propositional attitudes, e.g.,\n(occurrent) beliefs and desires. Arguments about epiphenomenalism may\nconcern either type of mental event, and it should not be assumed that\nan argument given for one type can be rephrased without loss for the\nother. The two types can often be connected, however, through beliefs\nthat one has one’s experiences. Thus, if it is held that pains\nhave no physical effects, then one must say either (i) pains do not\ncause beliefs that one is in pain, or (ii) beliefs that one is in pain\nare epiphenomenal. For, if pains caused beliefs that one is in pain,\nand the latter had physical effects, then pains would, after all, have\neffects in the physical world (albeit indirectly). But\nepiphenomenalism says mental events have no effects in the\nphysical\n world.[1] \nThe central motivation for epiphenomenalism lies in the premise that\nwhenever there is a sufficient cause of a physical event, there is a\nsufficient physical cause of that event. If a mental event is\nsomething other than a physical event, then for it to make any causal\ncontribution of its own in the physical world would require a\nviolation of physical law. Descartes’ (1649) interactionist\nmodel proposed that nonphysical events could cause small changes in\nthe shape of the pineal gland. But such nonphysical effects, however\nslight, would mean that the physical account of motion is\nfalse — for that account says that there will be no\nsuch change of shape unless there is a physical force that causes\nit. \nOne may try to rescue mental efficacy by supposing that whenever there\nis a mental effect in the physical world there is also a\nphysical force that is a sufficient cause of the effect. This view,\nhowever, both offends Occamist principles and fails to satisfy the\nleading anti-epiphenomenalist intuition, namely, that the mental\nmakes a difference to the physical, i.e., that it leads to\nbehavior that would not have happened in absence of the mental. The\nview also leads to an epistemological problem: If there is always a\nsufficient physical cause for whatever a mental event is supposed to\nproduce, then one could never be in a position where one\nneeds to suppose there is anything non-physical at work, and\nthus there could never be any reason to introduce mental causes into\none’s account of neural events or behavior. \nMany contemporary thinkers would respond to the central motivation for\nepiphenomenalism by denying its dualistic presupposition, i.e., by\nholding that mental events are identical with physical events, and may\ntherefore have physical effects. Questions that remain for such\nphysicalistic views will be explained in section 3. For now, it should\nbe noted that the argument stated in the previous two paragraphs is\nnot supposed to be an argument for dualism, but only for adopting\nepiphenomenalism, once dualism is accepted. \nFurther support for epiphenomenalism can be derived from the fact,\nnoted by Wilhelm Wundt (1912), that “each simple sensation is\njoined to a very complicated combination of peripheral and central\nnerve processes”, together with the fact that the causes of\nbehavior are likewise complex neural events. This latter fact makes it\nnatural to look for complex events throughout the causal chain leading\nto behavior; and these can be found in the neural events that are\nrequired for the occurrence of simple sensations. The sensations\nthemselves could not contribute to behavior without first having\nneural effects that are more complex than themselves. Thus an\nanti-epiphenomenalist stance would require us to prefer the hypothesis\nthat simple sensations cause (relatively) complex neural events over\nthe hypothesis that complex neural events (that are required in any\ncase for the causation of sensations) are adequate to cause the neural\nevents required for the causation of behavior. \nEpiphenomenalism is absurd; it is just plain obvious that our pains,\nour thoughts, and our feelings make a difference to our (evidently\nphysical) behavior; it is impossible to believe that all our behavior\ncould be just as it is even if there were no pains, thoughts, or\nfeelings. (Taylor, 1963 and subsequent editions, offers a\nrepresentative statement.)  \nThis argument is surely the briefest of those against\nepiphenomenalism, but it may have been more persuasive than any other.\nEpiphenomenalists, however, can make the following reply. First, it\ncan never be obvious what causes what. Animated cartoons are full of\ncausal illusions. Falling barometers are regularly followed by storms,\nbut do not cause them. More generally, a regularity is causal only if\nit is not explained as a consequence of underlying regularities. It is\npart of epiphenomenalist theory, however, that the regularities that\nwe observe to hold between mental events and actions can be explained\nby underlying regularities. Schematically, suppose physical event\n\\(P_1\\) causes both mental event \\(M\\) and physical successor \\(P_2\\),\nas in Figure 1. Figure 1. \nSuppose there is no other cause of \\(M\\), and no other cause of\n\\(P_2\\). Then every \\(M\\) will be followed by \\(P_2\\), yet the cause\nof \\(P_2\\) will be adequately found in \\(P_1\\). It is true that, under\nthe assumptions stated, the counterfactual, “If \\(M\\) had not\noccurred, then \\(P_2\\) would not have occurred” holds; but then, so\nmay “if the barometer had not fallen, the storm would not have\noccurred.” The moral to be drawn is that causation may imply\nthat certain counterfactuals hold, but the holding of counterfactuals\nis not enough to show causation.  Thus, it is true that some of our\nactions would not have occurred, under normal conditions, unless we\nhad had certain mental events. But this fact cannot show that those\nactions are caused by our mental events (rather than being caused by\nthe physical causes of those mental events). \nIt is often said that pains cause withdrawals of affected parts of the\nbody. In extreme cases, however — for example in a case of\ntouching a hot stove — it can be observed that the affected part\nis withdrawn before the pain is felt. These cases cannot show\nthat pain never causes withdrawals, but they do show that pain is not\nnecessary as a cause of withdrawals. In less extreme cases, it is open\nto the epiphenomenalist to hold that the causal order is the same as\nin the extreme cases (i.e., some physical event, \\(P_1\\), causes both\nwithdrawal and pain) but is not ordinarily recognized to be so. \nA variant of the obvious absurdity objection is that epiphenomenalism\nleads to a feeling of loss of self, or a sense that we can no longer\nregard our actions as ours. (See Hyslop, 1998.)\nEpiphenomenalists may, however, reply that there would be different\nbrain states corresponding to the difference between cases of moving\nour bodies and cases of having our body parts moved by something else,\nand their view allows different brain states to have different\nphenomenological effects. Epiphenomenalism is also compatible with\nthere being a distinction between actions that proceed from normal\nbrain processes in normal conditions, and actions that proceed from\nmanipulation by others, disease, or situations that overwhelm normal\nreasoning abilities. \nThe development of consciousness must be explainable through natural\nselection. But a property can be selected for only if it has an effect\nupon organisms’ behavior. Therefore, consciousness (both qualia\nand intentional states) must have effects in behavior, i.e.,\nepiphenomenalism is false. (See Popper and Eccles, 1977; James (1879);\nRomanes, 1896)  \nAccording to the same biology that embraces natural selection,\nhowever, behavior has muscular causes, which in turn have neural\ncauses. Barring neural events that are inexplicably in violation of\nbiological constraints on their conditions of activation, there must\nbe an adequate physical cause of every link in the causal chain\nleading to behavior. Thus, it is easily understood how certain kinds\nof neural events can be selected for. Epiphenomenalists hold that\nconscious events are effects of (certain) neural events. Thus, it fits\nwell in their view that we have the conscious events we do because the\nneural causes of these events have been selected for. Indeed, if\nneural causes of behavior are selected for, and are sufficient causes,\nthere cannot be any further effect attributed to\nnatural selection. \nWilliam James (1879; 1890; see also Bradley, 2011) offered an\nintriguing variant of the argument from natural selection. If pleasure\nand displeasure have no effects, there would seem to be no reason why\nwe might not abhor the feelings that are caused by activities\nessential to life, or enjoy the feelings produced by what is\ndetrimental. Thus, if epiphenomenalism (or, in James’s own\nlanguage, automaton-theory) were true, the felicitous alignment that\ngenerally holds between affective valuation of our feelings and the\nutility of the activities that generally produce them would require a\nspecial explanation. Yet on epiphenomenalist assumptions, this\nalignment could not receive a genuine explanation. The felicitous\nalignment could not be selected for, because if affective valuation\nhad no behavioral effects, misalignment of affective valuation with\nutility of the causes of the evaluated feelings could not have any\nbehavioral effects either. Epiphenomenalists would simply have to\naccept a brute and unscientific view of pre-established harmony of\naffective valuation of feelings and the utility of their causes. \nEpiphenomenalists can respond to James’s argument by offering\nsupport for the following two views. (I) There is a distinction\nbetween (a) neural events in sensory systems, which cause feelings,\nand (b) neural events in a reward system (where an event is a member\nof a reward system if and only if it contributes to continuance (or,\ndiscontinuance) or repetition (or avoidance) in similar circumstances,\nof any behavior that leads to that event). (II) What\n“pleasure” refers to in any possible world is the effect\nin consciousness of the events in (b) that contribute to continuance\nor repetition. Since both (a) events and (b) events have neural and,\nultimately, behavioral effects, they can be selected for, and so can\ntheir combination. The alignment of feelings caused by useful stimuli\nand pleasure (and, by parallel reasoning, alignment of feelings caused\nby harmful stimuli and displeasure) would then follow from alignment\nof neural events of the kinds described in (a) and (b). This latter\nalignment is independently plausible. A reward system that can lead to\nquick decisions and a sensory system that provides discriminations for\nuse in longer term planning would both confer advantages; and these\nsystems would, in general, have to work together in a successful\norganism. (For fuller discussion of James’s argument see\nRobinson 2007, 2019; and for the structure of pleasure, see Robinson\n2006b, 2019.) \nOur reason for believing in other minds is inference from behavioral\neffects to mental event causes. But epiphenomenalism denies such a\ncausal connection. Therefore, epiphenomenalism implies the\n(exceedingly implausible) conclusion that we do not know that others\nhave mental events. (Jackson, 1982, replies to this and several other\narguments against epiphenomenalism. The argument is stated, and\naccepted, by Benecke, 1901.)  \nThe first premise of this argument is a widely held dogma, but it can\nbe denied without absurdity. (See Robinson, 1997.) It is perfectly\nobvious to everyone that the bodies of human beings are very much\nalike in their construction, and it requires no sophisticated\nreasoning to infer that if others are made like me, they probably hurt\nwhen affected like me, e.g., when their bodies are stuck with pins,\nbeaten, cut and so on. There is no principle that makes an inference\nfrom similar effects to similar causes more secure than an inference\nfrom similar causes to similar effects; on the contrary, the latter\ninference is more secure, because there can sometimes be quite\ndifferent causes of extremely similar effects. Thus, an inference to\nother minds that is allowed by epiphenomenalism must be at least as\nstrong as the inferential route to other minds with which it is\nincompatible. \nThe most powerful reason for rejecting epiphenomenalism is the view\nthat it is incompatible with knowledge of our own minds — and\nthus, incompatible with knowing that epiphenomenalism is true. (A\nvariant has it that we cannot even succeed in referring to our own\nminds, if epiphenomenalism is true. See Bailey (2006) for this\nobjection and Robinson (2012) for discussion.) If these destructive\nclaims can be substantiated, then epiphenomenalists are, at the very\nleast, caught in a practical contradiction, in which they must claim\nto know, or at least believe, a view which implies that they can have\nno reason to believe it. Moreover, unless epiphenomenalists can\nconsistently claim to know their own minds, they cannot offer the\nresponse to the other minds objection given in 2.3 above. (See Walton,\n1989.) (Many authors give some version of this objection. For a full\nstatement of this argument, and several others concerning\nepiphenomenalism, see Chalmers, 1996. For strong recent versions, see\nDeBrigard, 2014; Moore, 2012 (responded to by Robinson, 2013); and\nMoore, 2014.)  \nThe argument that is given to support the destructive claims is that\n(i) knowledge of one’s mental events requires that these events\ncause one’s knowledge, but (ii) epiphenomenalism denies physical\neffects of mental events. So, either we cannot know our own mental\nevents, or our knowledge of them cannot be what is causing the plainly\nphysical event of our saying something about our mental events. Thus,\nsuppose \\(S\\) is an epiphenomenalist, and that \\(S\\) utters “I am in\nterrible pain.” \\(S\\) is committed to the view that the pain does\nnot cause the utterance. But then, it seems, \\(S\\) would be making the\nsame utterance whether or not a pain were occurring. If this is so,\nthen \\(S\\)’s testimonies about \\(S\\)’s own pains are worthless\n— both to us and to \\(S\\). They cannot be taken to represent any\nknowledge about pains on \\(S\\)’s part (if \\(S\\)’s epiphenomenalist\nview is true). In fact, on an epiphenomenalist view, all the arguments\nfor epiphenomenalism and rebuttals to counterarguments we have\nreviewed might be given even if we were all zombies — i.e., even\nif we were all possessed of physical causes of our utterances and\ncompletely devoid of any mental life whatsoever. \nThe argument that epiphenomenalism is self-stultifying in the way just\ndescribed rests on the premise that knowledge of a mental event\nrequires causation by that mental event. But epiphenomenalists may\nreject that premise without absurdity. One way of seeing how to do\nthis involves considering the interactionist diagram in Figure 2,\nwhich shows \\(P_1\\) as directly causing \\(M\\) but not \\(P_2\\), and\n\\(M\\) directly causing \\(P_2\\).  (Directly causing is an intransitive\nrelation. Causation (when used without modifier) is transitive: events\nare causally related if there is a chain of direct causes, however\nlong, that connects them.) Figure 2. \nNow consider \\(P_3\\), which is directly caused by \\(P_2\\) and which we\nwill assume to cause (directly or indirectly) further behavior such as\n\\(S\\)’s utterance of “I am in terrible pain”. \\(P_3\\) is\nnot directly caused by \\(M\\). Does it convey knowledge of \\(M\\)? If we\nanswer negatively, on the ground that \\(P_3\\) is not directly caused\nby \\(M\\), we will be rejecting interactionism for virtually the same\nreason that epiphenomenalism is thought to be unacceptable. Since this\nis an extremely implausible stance, let us take it that \\(P_3\\) does\nconvey knowledge of \\(M\\). But what property does \\(P_3\\) actually\nhave that makes it a case of conveying knowledge of \\(M\\)?\nEpiphenomenalists will wish to point out that \\(P_3\\) does not have\nany property that contains information as to how it was\ncaused. Looking backward from \\(P_3\\), so to speak, one cannot tell\nwhether it was indirectly caused by \\(M\\) (as in the interactionistic\nFigure 2) or indirectly caused by \\(M\\)’s cause (as in the\nepiphenomenalistic Figure 1). There is, however, a property that\n\\(P_3\\) does have that is intuitively strongly connected to its\nconveying knowledge of \\(M\\) — namely, that it would not be\noccurring unless \\(M\\) had recently occurred. But \\(P_3\\) has this\nproperty on epiphenomenalist and interactionist views alike. Thus, if\nnot occurring unless \\(M\\) has recently occurred is the property that\nis responsible for \\(P_3\\)’s conveying knowledge of \\(M\\),\nepiphenomenalists have as much right as anyone to claim that \\(P_3\\)\nconveys knowledge of \\(M\\), and they are not debarred from knowing\nwhat they claim to know. \nCritics of epiphenomenalism can of course point out that there is a\nproperty that interactionism, but not epiphenomenalism, assigns to\n\\(P_3\\) — namely, the property of being indirectly caused by\n\\(M\\).  Epiphenomenalists, however, are likely to think that the\nintuitive connection between this property and knowledge is much\nweaker than that between knowledge of \\(M\\) and the fact that \\(P_3\\)\nwould not be occurring unless \\(M\\) had recently occurred. In fact,\nthey may hold that the relevance of indirect causation is exhausted by\nits ensuring that \\(P_3\\) would not occur unless \\(M\\) had recently\noccurred. They can then reiterate that there is another way of\nensuring that this condition holds, namely, the set of relations,\ndiagrammed in Fig. 1, that is affirmed by epiphenomenalism. \nThe foregoing way of responding to the self-stultification argument is\nfurther explained and defended in Robinson (1982b, 2013; see also\n2006a). An alternative response can be found in Chalmers (1996; see\nalso Nagasawa, 2010). Chalmers’s property-dualistic view holds\nthat there is more to a person than just a brain and a body. It allows\nfor persons to be directly acquainted with experiences, and it is this\ndirect acquaintance, rather than any causal relation, that justifies\nour beliefs about experiences. On this view, experiences are partially\nconstitutive of beliefs about experiences, and “the\njustification of my belief [about experiences] accrues not just in\nvirtue of my physical features but in virtue of some of my nonphysical\nfeatures — namely the experiences themselves” (Chalmers,\n1996, p. 198). In supplying non-causal relations to support the claim\nto knowledge of experiences, this view disconnects the knowledge\nquestion from the question of how things stand causally, and thus\navoids the self-stultification argument. \nA third response to self-stultification begins with the observation\nthat terms for sensory qualities (words for colors, flavors, pitches\nand timbres, etc.) must be learned. Very plausibly, this learning\ndepends (a) on correlations between properties of present objects and\nproduction of words for those properties by surrounding adult\nspeakers; and, consequently, (b) on correlations between brain event\ntypes that are caused by the properties of those objects, and brain\nevent types that are caused by the hearing of adults’ words. It\nalso plausibly depends (c) on the brain’s sensitivity to the\ncorrelation of brain events in (b). It is part of epiphenomenalist\ntheory that the first brain events mentioned in (b) include causes of\nsensations of characteristic kinds, and that, after learning, those\nsame brain events causally determine the production of predicates in\nsensation reports. The combination of these relations ensures that, so\nlong as conditions in the brain are normal, a report of a sensation is\nguaranteed to correctly identify the kind of sensation that is\nnormally caused in the speaker by objects that are standardly\ndescribed by the predicate in the report. This guarantee underwrites a\nclaim to knowledge of what kinds of sensation we are having. \nConditions may, of course, sometimes be abnormal. But that cannot be a\ndefeater for epiphenomenalist knowledge of our sensations, because all\nviews must allow for the possibility of cognitive breakdowns such as\nunnoticed slips of the tongue or linguistic difficulties brought on by\ndisease. \nIn a 2006 paper, Michael Pauen has given a particularly persuasive\nargument that offers a new and deeper twist to the problem of what\nepiphenomenalists can consistently claim to know about qualia.\nPauen’s focus is on the epiphenomenalists’ claim that\nthere are laws linking the occurrence of neural events of certain\nkinds with occurrences of qualitative events. Since epiphenomenalists\ndeny the identity of qualia and physical properties, such laws are not\nonly contingent, but independent of physical laws. Thus,\nepiphenomenalists must concede the possibility of worlds in which the\nphysical laws are as they are here, but there are no laws connecting\nphysical events to qualitative events. If such worlds are possible, we\nmight actually be in such a world, and so the epiphenomenalist can be\nasked to provide evidence that we are not in such a world. But the\nepiphenomenalist denial of efficacy for qualia precludes the\npossibility of providing any such evidence. Even conceding that we\nknow at each moment what qualia we are having, we cannot exclude the\npossibility that our memories seem to tell us of qualitative events\nthat never occurred (or that were of different kinds than we seem to\nremember); yet we would have to rely on such memories in order to have\nevidence of causal laws holding between physical and qualitative\nevents. (Another argument that turns on memory is given by Swinburne,\n2011.) \nAlexander Staudacher (2006) has given a critical discussion of\nPauen’s paper. Among several points, perhaps the strongest is a\ncomparison between Pauen’s challenge and the challenge to prove\nI am not a brain in a vat. Inability to decisively answer this latter\nchallenge is not generally taken to impugn our knowledge concerning\ntables and chairs, nor are physicists expected to lay it to rest\nbefore proceeding with their science. Analogously, it may be that\nworlds without causal laws are not “relevant alternatives”\nfor epiphenomenalism, i.e., not alternatives that epiphenomenalists\nare fairly required to rule out. Staudacher points out that if we are\nallowed to raise skeptical challenges of the kind Pauen raises, it\nwill be possible to construct analogous, unanswerable skeptical\nchallenges for interactionism. And, although Staudacher does not\nprovide an analogous case for physicalism, it seems that parallel\ndifficulties are constructable. For example, according to physicalism,\nit would seem to be a conceptual possibility that qualia are\nidentical, not with neural properties, but with a combination of\nneural properties and phases of the Moon, while memory traces depend\nonly on neural properties. For reasons parallel to Pauen’s, it\nseems we could never have evidence that would rule this possibility\nout. But it is not clear that physicalists need to admit the necessity\nof providing evidence against such a view, in order to responsibly\naffirm their view. If that is right, parallel reasoning may be able to\nsupport Staudacher’s way of resisting the force of Pauen’s\nchallenge. \nJ. Megill (2007) has raised a problem for epiphenomenalism based on\nthe assumption that properties must be individuated by their causal\nrelations. Since epiphenomenalists deny efficacy to phenomenal\nqualities, the only causal relations to which they could appeal to\nindividuate them would be causes of events with those qualities.\nHowever, different causes may produce the same effect. Thus, appeal to\ndifference of causes alone is an insufficient basis for individuation\nof phenomenal qualities. \nEpiphenomenalists can be expected to deny the necessity of causal\nrelations for individuation. They may consistently hold, for example,\nthat the unique hues are qualities that simply differ and have no\nmetaphysical need for a principle of individuation. An epistemological\nproblem, however, may appear to remain: How can epiphenomenalists know\nthat they experience different phenomenal qualities? This, however, is\nthe self-stultification problem in a different guise, and\nepiphenomenalists can refer to the responses already considered. \nOne might have thought that if the mental and the physical are\nidentical, there could be no room for epiphenomenalistic questions to\narise. Behavior is caused by muscular events, and these are caused by\nneural events. Mental events will be identical with some of these\nneural events; so whatever effects these neural events have will be\neffects of mental events, and mental events will make a causal\ncontribution to, i.e., will “make a difference” to our\nbehavior.  \nQuestions about epiphenomenalism, however, arise the moment any\ndistinction is made between the mental properties and the physical\nproperties of an event. Section 3.1 will explain three ways in which\nthis can be done within a broadly materialist monism. The third of\nthese ways is still the subject of lively debate, and some of the\nissues will be explained in sections 3.2 and 3.3. \nIt should be noted that most recent writers take a somewhat dogmatic\nposition against epiphenomenalism. They presume that epiphenomenalism\nis to be avoided, and they go to great lengths to try to show that\nthey have avoided incurring that anathema, despite maintaining the\nsufficiency of physical causation in conjunction with some kind of\ndistinction between the mental and the physical. \n(1) Many philosophers hold an externalist view of\nintentionality, according to which intentionality requires\nrepresentation, and representation depends on circumstances external\nto the body of the representing subject. (To illustrate with\nPutnam’s (1975) famous example from Twin Earth, what a thought\nthat \\(S\\) might express by “This is water” is actually about\ndepends on what the transparent, tasteless liquid in \\(S\\)’s\nenvironment actually is.) It seems, however, that the causal\ndeterminants of \\(S\\)’s behavior can depend only on events occurring\ninside \\(S\\)’s body. Thus, if externalism is right, what \\(S\\) does\ncannot depend on the intentional content of \\(S\\)’s thoughts. \nThis conclusion is compatible with holding that a proper\ndescription of \\(S\\)’s behavior should refer to\ncircumstances external to \\(S\\). For example, describing \\(S\\) as reaching\nfor a glass of water may not be appropriate unless \\(S\\) believes the\nglass contains water; and that this is what \\(S\\) believes may depend on\ncircumstances external to \\(S\\). But then, it is at least tempting to\nconclude that it cannot be the intentional character of \\(S\\)’s\nbelief that is causing the extension of \\(S\\)’s arm toward the\nglass. After all, \\(S\\)’s twin-earth double has, in some sense, a\ndifferent belief (one that refers to XYZ) but the internal bodily\nstory of the causation of the double’s arm-extension will be\nexactly the same as the story for \\(S\\) (up to substitution of XYZ in the\ndouble’s body wherever \\(S\\) has an H2O molecule). \n(2) Donald Davidson’s (1970) anomalous monism held that (i) each\nmental event is identical with a physical event, but (ii) there are no\npsychophysical laws. Davidson accepted the view that causation\ninvolves laws and, in view of (ii), held that the laws into which\nmental events entered related physical properties (or, mental events\nunder their physical descriptions). Many philosophers regarded this\nview as tantamount to epiphenomenalism, i.e., to the view that\ncausation of our behavior involves only the physical properties of our\nparts, and that the mental properties as such have no efficacy. \n(3) A similar discussion rages today, but begins with a background\nassumption of multiple realization. It is thought to be highly\nimplausible that belief in a particular proposition, or desire for a\nparticular state of affairs, is identical with the same state of a\nbrain (or a part of a brain) in different people, or even in the same\nperson at different times. Instead, the same belief or desire is taken\nto be “realized” by different neural structures or states\nof activation on different occasions. \nSince the physical properties of different neural events are\ndifferent, transitivity of identity prohibits claiming identity of\nmental properties with any of the physical properties whose\ninstantiation realizes those mental properties. In a body of work\nstretching over many years, Jaegwon Kim (1993, 2005, e.g.) has argued\nthat this division of mental from physical properties leads to\nexclusion of mental properties from playing a causal role. After all,\nit is widely accepted that the physical properties of neural events,\ntogether with a person’s state of neural connectivity, are\nsufficient to produce later neural events. Since behavior depends on\nmuscle contractions that depend on neural innervation, it seems that\nphysical events and structures, and the physical laws that apply to\nthem, are quite enough to bring about our behavior. There is nothing\nleft for mental properties to do. \nThere are, of course, some cases in which there is more than one\nsufficient cause of an event. Caesar’s death seems likely to have\nbeen overdetermined, i.e., it is probable that more than one\nattacker’s stroke would have been sufficient by itself for his\ndeath. But instances of mental properties are not distinct from\ninstances of physical properties that are their realizers in the way\nthat stabbings are distinct from each other, and systematic\noverdetermination of our behavior is generally regarded as\nimplausible. \nMany writers have held that Kim-style exclusion arguments depend on an\nunderstanding of causation for which there are preferable\nalternatives. (See, e.g., Woodward, 2008, 2017; Kroedel, 2016; Beebee,\n2017.) This kind of response is sometimes put forward as providing a\nmore correct account of causation. Other writers allow that exclusion\narguments can succeed if causation is understood as productive (or\n‘oomphy’) causation, but hold that there are other “conceptions\nof causation” (Beebee, 2017) on which it remains acceptable to say\nthat our mental states cause our behavior. Epiphenomenalists may\nconcede that there is some such sense, but still think their view is\nvindicated if all the productive causation is provided by the physical\nactivities of our brains.  \nEpiphenomenalists may also emphasize that examples in exclusion\narguments are usually beliefs, desires or intentions. These mental\nproperties are closely associated with behavioral dispositions, and\ncan easily be understood in functional terms for which multiple\nrealizability is immediately plausible. As Kim has explicitly\nrecognized, however, (1993, p. 366), there are  properties that\nhave long caused difficulties for functionalism, namely, the qualities\nof phenomenal experiences such as pains, itches, tastes, smells,\nafterimages, and so on. The “explanatory gap” (Levine,\n1983) or “unintelligibility” (Robinson, 1982a) or the\n“hard problem” (Chalmers, 1996) concerning the connection\nbetween neural events and phenomenal qualities can be otherwise\nexpressed as our inability to see any necessity in that connection. We\nare unable to understand why it should be that a series of neural\nactivations occurring in various degrees of intensity and temporal\nrelations should always be accompanied by pain, or itch, or, indeed,\nby any phenomenal quality whatever. Inability to see any such\nnecessity is, of course, not a proof that such a necessity does not\nobtain. Nonetheless, absent insight into the necessity of the\nconnection between neural properties and qualitative properties, we\nare arguably in an explanatory position similar to\ntraditional epiphenomenalism. That is, we will have a sufficient\nexplanation of behavioral reactions to stimuli that invokes\nexclusively neural properties. In addition, we may hold the view that\nthese neural properties are necessarily connected to qualitative\nproperties; but, lacking explanation of this necessity, this\nconnection will contribute no understanding of how qualitative\nproperties could make a difference to behavior. Because this\ndifficulty has not been removed in the case of qualia, the success or\nfailure of the previously discussed Traditional Arguments remains\nrelevant to contemporary thinking about epiphenomenalism. \nL. A. Shapiro and E. Sober (2007) have developed an alternative line\nof argument that they hold to apply just as well to functional\nproperties and properties that resist functional analysis. The\ndistinction between common causation and realization plays a key role.\nCommon causation, they note, can lead to an empirically based denial\nthat one co-effect causes another. For example, tail length in mice\noffspring is caused by their parents’ genes, not by their\nparents’ tail length — and this can be empirically shown\nby cutting parental tails (which, of course, leaves their genotype\nconstant) and observing no effect on tail length of offspring. \nIt is impossible, however, to suppress a realized condition while\nleaving its realizer constant, so there is no sense to the demand that\nbeliefs should have causal powers that are additional to the causal\npowers of their neural state realizers. Nor is it possible to suppress\na phenomenal quality while holding constant a state with its\n(allegedly) identical neural property. Thus, saying that “there\nis nothing left for the property of being a belief (or a phenomenal\nquality) to do, once the neural realizer (or identical neural\nproperty) has done its work” does not undercut the efficacy of\nthe beliefs or phenomenal qualities. It shows only that beliefs (or\nphenomenal qualities) do not satisfy a demand (for an\n‘extra’ causal contribution) that is incoherent in\nitself. \nJ. A. Baltimore (2010) has responded by arguing that there are reasons\nother than that illustrated by the mice tails example for denying\nefficacy to mental events. M. Baumgartner (2010; see Woodward, 2015\nfor response) suggests that Shapiro and Sober’s approach depends\non a certain (interventionist-inspired) view of causation, but that\nattributions of causation in virtue of mental properties cannot be\ncounted as making sense without departing from the terms of that view.\nWhether this strong critique is accepted or not, it is evident that\nremoving a reason for objecting to efficacy of mental events in virtue\nof their mental properties does not by itself provide a positive\nreason for asserting such efficacy. \nSuch a reason may, however, be found in the subset view proposed by\nShoemaker (2007). To briefly illustrate a key idea, suppose that a\ncertain belief, \\(M\\), can be realized by alternative physical states\n\\(P_1, \\ldots P_n\\). Suppose further that this belief is involved in\nan inference, and that its possessor arrives at a new belief, i.e.,\narrives at another state that has a new mental property,\n\\(M^*\\). Suppose, finally, that \\(M^*\\) can be realized by alternative\nphysical states \\(P^*_1, \\ldots, P^*_o\\), and that each \\(P_i\\) is a\nsufficient physical cause for some \\(P^*_j\\). A particular \\(P_i\\)\ncauses a particular \\(P^*_j\\) by a particular causal route that need\nnot be shared by other \\(P\\) to \\(P^*\\) instances, and so \\(P_i\\) has\ncausal powers not shared by all instances of M. But any instance of\n\\(M\\) would have been realized by a sufficient cause of some realizer\nof \\(M^*\\). Thus, \\(M\\)’s causal powers include just those that\nare relevant to bringing about \\(M^*\\) (assuming that other\nconditions, e.g., belief in other premises required for the inference,\nare held constant). Given these assumptions, it is reasonable to\nconclude that it is \\(M\\) rather than its particular realizers that\ncausally contribute to \\(M^*\\), even though each instance of \\(M\\) is\nrealized by some \\(P_i\\) that is a sufficient cause of a realizer of\n\\(M^*\\), and thus is sufficient for \\(M^*\\). \nThe subset view is the subject of lively debate; see, e.g., Antony\n(2010), Audi (2012), Melnyk (2010), Shoemaker (2010). One objection is\nthat the subset view assumes rather than shows that M has any causal\npowers at all, and that this is the key question at issue (Kim, 2010).\nReasons have been offered for doubting this assumption, i.e.,\naccepting epiphenomenalism, at least for beliefs and desires. Segal\n(2009) argues that being a belief and being a desire are dispositional\nproperties, and that dispositional properties are not efficacious.\nTammalleo (2008) supports an exclusion argument, and invokes\nmechanisms independently established by cognitive psychology to\nexplain why we have the mistaken intuition that mental states are\ncauses. \nFrank Jackson (1982) has given an epiphenomenalistic argument that has\nspawned lively responses from many quarters. This argument turns on\nthe concept of physical information, where “physical\ninformation” is information about ourselves and our world of the\nkind that is obtainable in the physical, chemical, and biological\nsciences. In Jackson’s argument, a brilliant scientist, Mary,\nhas learned all the physical information there is about color vision.\nHaving been confined to a black and white room, however, Mary has\nnever had a color experience. Jackson asks whether Mary will learn\nanything when she is released from her confinement and thus comes for\nthe first time to have color experiences. It seems compelling that she\nwould learn something; but as she already has all the physical\ninformation there is, what she learns must be some other kind of\ninformation, which we may call “phenomenal information”.\nThis “knowledge argument” has been regarded as a strong\nreason to accept a dualistic view of our experiences. When combined\nwith the traditional arguments (Pro) given above, it becomes a potent\nsource of support for epiphenomenalism.  \nDavid Lewis (1988) undertakes a thorough response to the knowledge\nargument. Among Lewis’s many considerations, there is one that\nseeks to enforce a connection between phenomenal information per\nse and epiphenomenalism. According to Lewis’s argument,\neven if one says that phenomenal events are identical with\nphysical events, and even if one says that phenomenal events produce\nphysical effects in violation of physical laws, one will still be led\nto a form of epiphenomenalism if one says there is phenomenal\ninformation that is irreducibly different from physical information.\nTo put the argument in ruthlessly summary form, let \\(V_1\\) and\n\\(V_2\\) be two possibilities for the phenomenal information that one\nacquires by, and only by, tasting Vegemite. Suppose that \\(P_1\\) is a\nphysical state produced by the taste of Vegemite. That the taste of\nVegemite has this physical effect is a piece of physical\ninformation. But this same physical information is compatible with two\npossibilities, (a) \\(V_1\\) is related by a law, \\(L_1\\), to \\(P_1\\);\nand (b) \\(V_2\\) is related by a different law, \\(L_2\\), to\n\\(P_1\\). Now, either of these possibilities is compatible with all the\nphysical information we have; i.e., their difference makes no physical\ndifference. Thus, that the phenomenal information in the taste of\nVegemite is, say, \\(V_1\\) rather than \\(V_2\\) can make no difference\nto anything physical, i.e., \\(V_1\\) is epiphenomenal. Lewis’s\npoint here is not to argue for or against epiphenomenalism; rather, he\nassumes epiphenomenalism is false, and uses the fact that the\nhypothesis of phenomenal information leads to it as an argument\nagainst that hypothesis. \nDenis Robinson (1993) raises the possibility that Lewis’s\nargument can be extended to produce a far-reaching and puzzling\nresult. Suppose that \\(I_1\\) and \\(I_2\\) are two possibilities for an\nintrinsic property of a basic physical entity, e.g., a quark.\nEverything relevant to physics can be expressed by the lawlike\nrelations in which quarks stand to fundamental physical objects and\nproperties. Let this set of relations be \\(\\mathbf{S}\\). It appears\nthat there are two possibilities, (a) \\(I_1\\) is related by a set of\nlaws, \\(\\mathbf{L_1}\\), to \\(\\mathbf{S}\\); or (b) \\(I_2\\) is related\nby a different set of laws, \\(\\mathbf{L_2}\\), to \\(\\mathbf{S}\\).\nEither of these possibilities is compatible with all the physics we\nhave, i.e., their difference makes no physical difference. Thus, that\nthe intrinsic property of quarks is, say, \\(I_1\\) rather than \\(I_2\\)\ncan make no difference to physics, i.e., \\(I_1\\) is epiphenomenal. The\ngeneralization of this point is that the intrinsic properties of the\nfundamental objects of physics must be epiphenomenal. \nIt thus appears that we must either (1) deny that fundamental objects\nof physics have any intrinsic properties, or (2) deny that\nLewis’s argument for the connection of phenomenal information\nwith epiphenomenalism is sound, or (3) deny that Lewis’s\nargument can be paralleled in the suggested way for the case of\nintrinsic physical properties, or (4) admit an epiphenomenalism of\nintrinsic properties into our view of the basic structure of physical\nreality. \nBertrand Russell (1927, p. 382) held the view that physical theory can\nreveal only causal structure, or “formal properties” of\nmatter, and that “by examining our percepts we obtain knowledge\nwhich is not purely formal as to the matter of our brains.” This\nidea is taken up sympathetically (with substantial reworking in a\nquantum mechanical context) by Lockwood (1993). Chalmers (1996)\noffered a useful discussion of the view (now known as\n“Russellian monism”), and expressed some sympathy for it\n— a sympathy which has increased in intervening years (see, e.g.,\nChalmers, 2010). Denis Robinson (1993), however, regards intrinsic\nsimilarity of fundamental physical entities as different from\nsimilarity of phenomenal properties. \nIf phenomenal properties are intrinsic properties of fundamental\nphysical objects, and the latter stand in lawlike relations, then\nlawlike relations will hold between phenomenal properties and some\nphysical occurrences. This conclusion appears to give a causal role to\nphenomenal properties and thus to suggest a way out of\nepiphenomenalism. But if intrinsicality carries epiphenomenality, as\nD. Robinson’s extension of Lewis’s argument suggests, then\nthis way out of epiphenomenalism would be blocked. Moreover, since\nthere is no phenomenal quality that we are always experiencing, no\ninstantiation of a quality by a fundamental physical particle can, by\nitself, be one of our sensations. It is thus not clear that Russellian\nmonism gives any more causal role to our sensations than does\nepiphenomenalism (see Robinson, 2018 for elaboration). \nThere are some empirical results that engage epiphenomenalism in\nseveral ways. These empirical results do not cut as deeply as the\nforegoing arguments, for they do not claim to show that consciousness\nis completely inefficacious. In particular, they do not show, and are\nnot aimed at showing, that episodes of consciousness do not causally\ncontribute to reports of such episodes. They suggest instead that the\nreported consciousness is not causally related to our nonlinguistic\nbehavior in ways that we ordinarily suppose. \nAn early and very well known argument derives from the work of B.\nLibet (1985, 2004). Libet asked participants in his experiments to\nmake an unplanned movement when they felt the urge to do so, and to\nreport (using a specially designed clock-like instrument) the time\nwhen they felt the urge to move. Recordings of participants’ brain\nwaves were made during these experiments, and Libet found a signal\n(the “readiness potential”, RP) that correlated with the\nmovements. The key finding was that (after allowing for corrections\ndue to neural transmission times) the RP occurred about 350 ms earlier\nthan the time that participants reported having the urge to move.\nLibet himself allowed for the possibility of a veto after the urge\nthat would block the movement. However, many have drawn an implication\nthat the conscious urge to make a movement comes too late to causally\ncontribute to a movement that has already been initiated by brain\nprocesses (that were detected by the RP measurement). A corollary of\nthis implication is that, to the extent we have an intuition that our\nurge to move caused the movement, we are subject to a causal illusion.\nThe possibility of causal illusion, in turn, weakens the intuitive\nargument against epiphenomenalism explained in section 2.1 above. \nMore recently, work led by J-D. Haynes (2013; see also Soon, et\nal., 2008) has found brain events that are somewhat correlated\nwith decisions, and that occur several seconds before the decision is\nmade. This work seems unsettling for the following reason. If we\nbelieve we were weighing options on a matter that was still open at,\nsay, one second before our conscious decision, but our action was\nalready predictable from neural events before that, then we would be\nunder some illusion about the extent to which our conscious decision\nhas an effect on our behavior. \nWork by Wegner and Wheatley (1999), Wegner (2002), and Linser and\nGoschke (2007), describes participants who have judged themselves to\nhave partial control of movements over which they in fact lacked\ncontrol. But if we can demonstrably have illusions about being in\ncontrol, our sense of being in control of our actions cannot be taken\nas evidence that our conscious intentions actually have effects in our\n(nonlinguistic) behavior. Such illusions further imply that we\nsometimes lack knowledge of the actual course of causation of our\nactions. \nIn well-regarded studies, Nisbett and Wilson (1977a, 1977b) showed\nthat people sometimes confabulate, that is, they give reasons for\nevaluative judgments that do not reflect the actual causes of making\nthose judgments. This work again carries two implications: that people\nare sometimes mistaken in accepting efficacy of what they believe to\nbe their reasons for a judgment, and that they are sometimes mistaken\nabout the real reasons for their behavior. \nThe implications drawn from these experiments have been criticized on\nseveral grounds. In some cases, there are technical criticisms of\nmethods or statistical analyses (see Dennett, 1991 for critique of\nLibet’s conclusions, and S. Walter’s 2014 discussion of the\nWegner and Wheatley (1999) experiment). The force of the work led by\nHaynes is mitigated by the fact that predictions of behavior from\nseveral seconds before its occurrence, while statistically\nsignificant, are far from perfect. Many other points have been made\n(see Nahamias, 2008; Mele, 2014; Shepherd, 2017; Baumeister et\nal., 2018). Two basic criticisms are offered by many writers.\nFirst, many of the experimental conditions involve meaningless setups\n(ouija-like boards, for example) or meaningless decisions (e.g., when\nto move a finger or which of two buttons to press) that bear little\nresemblance to real-life decisions (e.g., whether to accept a job, or\ngo to a particular place for a vacation) where people bring\nsubstantive reasons and personal preferences to bear. These oddities\nand simplifications may be thought to render ineffective psychological\nmechanisms that would be operative in more realistic cases and that\nwould forestall illusions about the relation between our consciously\nentertained reasons and our behavior. Second, the fact that there are\nsome cases in which unconscious influences have a noticeable effect on\nour behavior does not show that we are never, or even not usually,\nacting in a manner that would be rational, given our particular\nlongstanding beliefs and preferences. \nJames Ward’s Encyclopedia Britannica (tenth edition,\n1902) article, “Psychology”, contains the following\nsummary of T. H. Huxley’s view: “physical changes are held\nto be independent of psychical, whereas psychical changes are declared\nto be their ‘collateral products’. They are called\ncollateral products, or ‘epiphenomena’ to obviate\nthe charge of materialism … .” McDougall (1911)\nroundly declares, referring to Huxley, that “to him [the\ndoctrine] owes the name by which it is generally known; for he it was\nwho suggested that the stream of consciousness should be called\nepiphenomenal, or the epiphenomenon of the brain-process.” In\nCarington (1949), H. H. Price expresses his belief that the term\n“epiphenomenalism” was introduced by T. H. Huxley.  \nIt is interesting, therefore, that the term\n“epiphenomenalism” does not occur in Huxley’s (1874)\nessay on our topic; nor have I been able to find it elsewhere in his\npublished work. (Neither does Huxley use the terms “stream of\nconsciousness” or “brain-process”.) Of course, it is\npossible that Huxley made oral use of “epiphenomenalism”\nin lecturing. This seems unlikely, however, as he had at his disposal\nanother brief term for the view he was concerned to promote, the\nmeaning of which would have been more immediately accessible to most\naudiences, namely, “automatism”. This is the term that\noccurs in his 1874 essay, which bears the title “On the\nHypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History”. Besides\ncontaining the analogy of the steam-whistle that contributes nothing\nto the locomotive’s work, this essay compares consciousness to\nthe sound of the bell of a clock that has no role in keeping the time,\nand treats volition as a symbol in consciousness of the brain-state\ncause of an action. As Ward correctly noted, nonefficacious mental\nevents are referred to in this essay as “collateral\nproducts” of their physical causes. The essay is not solely\nconcerned with animals: to the best of Huxley’s judgment,\n“the argumentation which applies to brutes holds equally good of\nmen”. \nHuxley and his contemporaries seem to have been impressed by\npreparations in which frogs had had various portions of their brains\nremoved. Reasoning by analogy with humans lesioned by disease or\nbattle, Huxley finds it plausible that the frogs are not conscious, or\nnot exercising volition; yet when thrown into water, for example, they\nswim just as well as undamaged frogs. Huxley also discusses at some\nlength the case of a Seargent F., who had sustained a shot that\nfractured his left parietal bone. Once or twice a month, this soldier\nwould have a day-long bout in which he exhibited complex behavior\n(e.g., singing, writing a letter, “reloading”,\n“aiming”, and “firing” his cane with motions\nexactly appropriate to a rifle in a skirmish) while being plausibly\nunconscious, as evidenced by insensitivity to pins and shocks, sound,\nsmell and taste, and to a great extent, vision. Huxley allows that\nthere can be no direct evidence showing that the soldier is conscious\nor not conscious; but he concludes that he may be devoid of\nconsciousness, while performing his complex and apparently purposeful\nmovements. \nHuxley was not alone among 19th century figures who gave vigorous and\nclear expositions of an epiphenomenalistic view. S. Hodgson (1870), W.\nK. Clifford (1874) and H. Maudsley (1886) were exponents of the view.\nRomanes’ posthumous (1896) contains an excellent statement of\nthe view, which was first published in the early 1880s; and William\nJames (1879) likewise offers an early clear statement of it. Both\nRomanes and James follow their statements of the view with arguments\nagainst its acceptance. \nNone of the works just mentioned include the term\n“epiphenomenalism”. I have located three articles in\nMind in the 1890s that do use the term (the earliest, in\n1893, hyphenates it as “epi-phenomenalism”). The earliest\noccurrence of the term for referring to automatism that I have been\nable to locate is in William James’s The Principles of\nPsychology, first published in 1890. It occurs in his chapter\n“The Automaton-Theory” once, in scare quotes; the rest of\nthe time, the view is referred to as the\n“automaton-theory” or the “conscious\nautomaton-theory”. James attributes the origination of the view\nto Shadworth Hodgson, in The Theory of Practice (1870). A\nsection of this work titled “Dependence of consciousness on\nnerve movement” does indeed contain a forthright statement of\nthe view (without “epiphenomenalism”,\n“automatism” or any other “-ism” tag). \nEarly in his discussion of automatism, James (1890) includes some\nremarks about his intellectual development, and refers to his early\nstudy of medicine. “Epiphenomenon” has a use in this\nfield, meaning a symptom concurrent with, but not causally\ncontributory to, the course of a disease. Some early twentieth century\ndictionaries list only this meaning of the term; by mid-twentieth\ncentury, the focal philosophical meaning is standardly given. My\npresent surmise is that the term “epiphenomenalism” came\ninto philosophy from medicine in the late nineteenth century,\npossibly, though less certainly, through William James’s use of\nthe term in his influential Principles of Psychology\n(1890).","contact.mail":"wsrob@iastate.edu","contact.domain":"iastate.edu"}]
