The distinctive contributions of Huayan\ninclude the doctrines that “one is all, and all is one,”\nthat ultimate reality is ontologically identical with the illusory\nworld of common sense, and that realizing these facts leads to\nuniversal compassion. Huayan is known also for the incisive nature of\nits arguments, particularly in Fazang’s “Rafter\nDialogue” and Zongmi’s On the Origin of\nHumanity.\n\n\nThe Chinese term “Huayan” means “Flower\nGarland” and comes from the Avatamsaka Sutra\n(Flower Garland Sutra), an Indian Sanskrit text. Huayan also\nshows the influence of the Madhyamaka doctrine of Nagarjuna, the\nYogacara School, and the teachings of Awakening of Faith in\nMahayana. However, Huayan is a distinctively Chinese form of\nBuddhism, particularly for the way that it interprets\n“emptiness” in terms of “interdependence” and\ntreats the natural world as possessing intrinsic value. Huayan spread\nto Korea (where it was known as “Hwaeom”) and to Japan\n(where it was called “Kegon”). Like other forms of Chinese\nBuddhism, Huayan identified a series of patriarchs who allegedly\ntransmitted the orthodox teachings of the tradition from master to\ndisciple. Of these, the two most important are Fazang and Zongmi.\n\n\nAlthough the vitality of the school in China lapsed after the\npersecution of Buddhism by Emperor Wuzong (842–846 CE), its doctrines,\nmetaphors, and vocabulary had a significant influence on Chan (Zen)\nBuddhism and the Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming dynasties.\n\nBuddhism was founded some time between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE\nin South Asia. The fundamental teachings of Buddhism are that ordinary\nlife is suffused with (Skt.) dukkha (often translated as\n“suffering”), and that dukkha is caused by the\nillusory belief in persistent individual selves. The belief in selves\nleads to endless craving (Skt. tanha) which is unsatisfiable,\nbecause it is a longing by one illusory entity (the personal self) to\npermanently possess other equally illusory things. Escape from craving\n(and hence dukkha) is only possible by achieving\nenlightenment, which is fully believing the truth of no-self (Skt.\nanatman). Enlightenment leads to universal compassion:\ndukkha is seen to belong to no one, so there is no reason to\nprefer the elimination of what would conventionally be described as\n“my suffering” to “your suffering” or\n“their suffering.” The illusory world of independent\nselves is referred to as (Skt.) “samsara,” and\nthe state achieved through enlightenment is (Skt.)\n“nirvana.”  \nThe two major sects of the Buddhist religion are Theravada and\nMahayana. These sects have a great variety of philosophical\nformulations, but three of the more influential schools are Abhidharma\n(Theravada), Madhyamaka (Mahayana), and Yogacara (Mahayana). Each of\nthese schools interprets the key concepts of Buddhism in different\nways. \n Abhidharma Buddhists\n argue that the things that are taken to be\nindependent, persistent selves by common sense (such as particular\nmonks like “Nagasena” and objects like chariots) exist\nonly by convention. However, these conventionally existing entities\nare ontologically grounded in other, genuinely existing (Skt.)\n dharmas\n (entities such as instantaneous configurations of\nmatter, or temporary mental states). Although these dharmas\nare transient and causally dependent on one another, they also possess\na self-nature (Skt. \n svabhava).  \nIn contrast, Madhyamaka Buddhists (like Nagarjuna) argue that, because\nall dharmas are causally dependent, nothing is ultimately\ngrounded. They describe this by saying that reality is characterized\nby “emptiness” \n(Skt. sunyata), in the sense that\neverything is “empty” of self-nature and an independent,\npersistent self. The doctrine of emptiness is easy to misunderstand,\nand is sometimes mistakenly conflated with metaphysical nihilism.\nHowever, Buddhists distinguish their view from both Annihilationism\n(Skt. uccheda-drsti) and Eternalism (Skt.\nsasvata-drsti). Annihilationism is the view that nothing\nexists in any sense, while Eternalism is the view that something\nexists that is eternal, unchanging, and unconditioned by anything\nelse. Madhyamaka denies both extremes, and holds that while\ndharmas do exist, each dharma’s existence is\n“conditioned” (causally or conceptually dependent) on\nsomething else, without any ultimate ground.  \nYogacara\n offers a third alternative: everything is “empty”\nof a mind-independent self. All that exists are mental states.\nConsistent with the doctrine of “no-self,” Yogacara\nBuddhists deny that there is a substantial entity that has, thinks, or\nexperiences the mental states. However, in order to explain why there\nare correlations among experiences (for example, why the apparent\nexperience of “my starting a fire” is correlated with the\napparent experience of “you feeling warmth”), Yogacara\nposits a \n repository consciousness\n (Skt. alayavijnana) which\nmetaphorically contains the “seeds” of previous\nexperiences that bear fruit in later experiences.  \nBuddhism was brought to China by missionaries some time during the\nfirst century CE. Indian scriptures and expositions arrived in China\npiecemeal, with the result that early Chinese adherents to Buddhism\ndid not perceive contributions from different Indian traditions as\nfundamentally inconsistent. Chinese Buddhism is thus eclectic in its\nuse of concepts from what were originally distinct Indian Buddhist\nschools. This, in turn, led to the practice of (Ch.) panjiao\n(doctrinal classification), according to which different philosophical\nsystems are treated not as exclusive, but as partial conceptions of\nthe truth, which can be arranged hierarchically in terms of how\ncomplete (literally, “rounded,” Ch. yuan) their\ngrasp of the truth is. To use Western terminology, one might say that\npanjiao is a form of inference to the best explanation, since\nthe more comprehensive teachings are shown to offer a more plausible\nand comprehensive interpretation of the relevant ethical,\nmetaphysical, and empirical assumptions.  \nUpon gradually growing in influence, Buddhism became one of the\n“Three Teachings” (Ch. San jiao) of the Chinese\ntradition, along with Confucianism and Daoism. In fact, at times\nBuddhism has been the dominant religious and philosophical movement in\nChina (among both intellectuals and commoners). However, there have\nbeen several periods of Buddhist persecution in Chinese history. In\n567 CE, Wei Yuansong (n.d.), having left the Buddhist order, argued to\nEmperor Wu of the Northern Zhou (543–578, ruled 561–578) that Buddhism\nshould be de-institutionalized. He argued that Buddhism is responsible\nfor social instability because its various institutions—monastic\nliving, internal hierarchies, and freedom from political\ncontrol—undermine harmony-facilitating Chinese culture and\ntradition by virtue of facilitating corruption among monks and by\nisolating Buddhism from practical affairs (Ch. shi).  \nEmperor Wu’s subsequent persecutions of Buddhism, in 574 and\n577, disrupted Buddhist institutions. Many monks fled to rural areas,\nseeking forms of Buddhism better suited to a Chinese context.\nSearching for ways to make Buddhism more accessible to laity, for more\namenable practices and more achievable ideals, they also began\nexploring in earnest scriptures that receive little if any attention\nin the well-established schools of Indian Buddhism. The lack of\ndefinitive commentaries on these scriptures from established Indian\ntraditions, together with political disruptions to the inertia of\nextant scholarly traditions of Buddhism, permitted a freedom of\ncreative appropriation and innovation that resulted in traditions of\nBuddhism unique to the Chinese context.  \nHuayan is one of these traditions. Chief among the scriptures\nresponsible for its distinctive teachings are the Avatamsaka\n(Flower Garland) Sutra and Awakening of Faith in\nMahayana. Huayan takes its name from the Avatamsaka\nSutra (Ch. Huayan jing), which presents a dizzyingly\ncomplex and intricate vision of reality as thoroughly\n“interpenetrating,” of Buddhahood as coextensive with all\nthere is, and of the features of reality as completely dependent upon\nthe mind and deeds of sentient beings. Awakening of Faith in\nMahayana develops the theory of the tathagatagarbha,\n(Skt. for “Buddha-embryo” or “Buddha-womb”),\nthe potentiality of Buddhahood. It posits One Mind as the foundation\nof reality. It also ascribes to One Mind two aspects, tathata\n(Skt. for “suchness” or “thusness”) and\nsamsara. Tathata refers to reality as experienced\nwithout dukkha; it is generally taken to be non-conceptual\nand hence incapable of being expressed in words. Samsara is\nreality as experienced with dukkha. Awakening of Faith in\nMahayana presents these aspects as mutually inclusive and\ninseparable.  \nThrough the fusion of the ideas of the Avatamsaka Sutra and\nAwakening of Faith in Mahayana, Huayan Buddhism developed a\ndistinctive interpretation of the concepts of “emptiness”\nand “no-self.” The original Indian Buddhist view that\nthere are no selves transformed into the Chinese Buddhist view that\nthere is no individual self, but there is a sort of\ntranspersonal self (One Mind) of which all the transient and\nontologically interdependent aspects of reality are parts. The\nfundamental human vice is selfishness, which is caused by the illusory\nbelief in individual selves, and the fundamental human virtue is\nuniversal compassion, which is caused by the recognition that we are\nall parts of one, transpersonal reality. To fail to have compassion\nfor another person is like ignoring a wound to my own limb because it\nis temporarily numb.  \nHuayan inherits from Madhyamaka the view that all entities are\nconditioned. To be conditioned is for an entity to be causally or\nconceptually dependent for its existence and its identity on something\nelse. However, Huayan takes the additional steps of arguing that,\nbecause the identity of any one thing is dependent on the identities\nof other things, “one is all,” and because the whole is\ndependent for its identity on its parts, “all is one.”\nHuayan adopts from Yogacara the terms “repository\nconsciousness” (alayavijnana) and “womb of the\nBuddha” (tathagatagarbha), which it uses to describe\nthe reality of the world in itself. The Third Patriarch Fazang\n(discussed more below) illustrates how “one is all and all is\none” with the relationship between a rafter and the building of\nwhich it is a part. He argues that the building is the rafter, because\nthe building is nothing more than the sum of its parts, so each part\nis essential to its identity. Conversely, the rafter is the building,\nbecause what makes the rafter a rafter is its role as a part of the\nbuilding. (Intuitively, if the rafter were removed from the building,\nits identity could change to being a bench, or a teeter-totter, or\nsimply kindling.)  \nOne of the metaphors from the Avatamsaka Sutra that is\nfrequently used to illustrate mutual interdependence is Indra’s\nnet (or “Indra’s web”). According to pre-Buddhist\nmyth, the god Indra has a net with a jewel at the intersection of\nevery two strands. Each jewel is so bright that it reflects every\nother jewel in the net. This is adopted as a metaphor for the manner\nin which each thing that exists is dependent for both its existence\nand its identity upon every other thing that exists.  \nSince the only thing that exists is this reality, the world of\nillusion (samsara) is no different ontologically from\nnirvana. (The slogan “Nirvana is\nsamsara” is antecedently present in Madhyamaka.) In other\nwords, samsara is simply a mistaken perception of the same\nultimate reality experienced in enlightenment. Fazang illustrates this\nwith the metaphor of a statue of a golden lion (Fazang 2014a). We\nshould not deny or fail to perceive the conventional fact that the\nstatue appears to be a lion. However, we must realize that there is no\nsense in which a lion is actually there, and even the appearance of\nthe lion is not a separate entity beyond the gold that is present. The\ngold can take on different forms (ore, ingots, coins, etc.), but in\nitself it is ultimately unchanging. Similarly, we should not deny or\nfail to perceive that ordinary reality appears to consist of distinct,\npersistent individuals. However, we must realize that there are not\nactually distinct, persistent individuals. All that really exists is\nthe complete network of mutually interdependent entities\n(dharmas), and this network (extended through all of time and\nspace) is eternal and unchanging.  \nDushun holds the posthumous honor of being known as the first\npatriarch of the Huayan School. He was active as a monk during the Sui\n(581–618) and early Tang (618–907) dynasties. We know very little\nabout his life. He had no sectarian affiliation, and he seems to have\nbeen relatively unconcerned with scholarly controversies. We know that\nhe was keenly interested in the Avatamsaka Sutra, and that he\nwas renowned as a meditation master. For a time, he served as leader\nof the Zhixiang Temple on Zhongnan Mountain, which was a center for\nstudying the Avatamsaka Sutra. His main interest seems to\nhave been ministering to rural laity for the sake of making Buddhist\npractice relevant to their lives—by hosting common meals,\ndistributing food to the poor, chanting scriptural passages, and\noffering edifying homilies.  \nDushun authored only a handful of texts. Chief among these is\nDiscernments of the Dharmadhatu of Avatamsaka (Ch. Huayan\nfajie guanmen, trans. Gimello 1976b, 457–510). This no longer\nexists as an independent text. But it is interspersed within several\ncommentaries, most notably those by Chengguan (T45.1883; trans. Cleary\n1993, 71–124) and Zongmi (T45.1884, trans. King 1976). The text itself\nis quite unusual. It is not a commentary on the Avatamsaka\nSutra. Nor does it offer exegesis of the Avatamsaka\nSutra. There are no paraphrases, no explanations of passages, no\ndefinitions or technical terminology. Instead, the text distils the\ncentral insights available through studying the Avatamsaka\nSutra. Its apparent goal is making the Avatamsaka Sutra\nrelevant to meditative practice and accessible to the laity.  \nDiscernments of the Dharmadhatu divides into three sections,\neach of which corresponds to a “discernment” or meditation\non the content of the Avatamsaka Sutra. The first discernment\nreviews the equivalence between form (Skt. rupa) and\nemptiness. This is a well-known equivalence from the Heart\nSutra and other literature from the Indian Mahayana tradition.\nNothing in this discernment should be unfamiliar to students of the\nhistory of Indian Buddhism. The second discernment, by contrast,\ncontains two innovations that are critical for understanding the\nChinese appropriation of Buddhism—and thereby renders the text\nespecially significant from a philosophical perspective.  \nThe first innovation is Dushun’s decision to use the Chinese\nterm li (principle/pattern) to characterize the nature of\nultimate reality. Indian Mahayana typically characterizes the nature\nof ultimate reality as emptiness (Skt. sunyata) or suchness\n(Skt. tathata). Both of these terms connote something that\ndefies conceptualization. Dushun imbues li with an\nepistemological connotation: li is that which is present to\nthose who achieve nirvana. Nirvanic experience, as\nDushun understands it, reveals neither emptiness nor an\nundifferentiated manifold but, instead, boundless and ceaseless\nactivity that has a patterned coherence to it (see Jiang 2001,\n466–467; for a contrary interpretation, see Gimello 1976a, 125).  \nBy discussing li—the boundless and ceaseless activity\npresent during nirvanic experience—rather than\nemptiness, Dushun forestalls any conflation between li and\ntotal voidness. Whatever else it might be, li is far\nfrom nothing at all. By discussing li rather than\ntathata, Dushun affords the possibility of saying something\nabout ultimate reality. Conceptualizing nirvanic experience\nas encountering suchness presents those experiences as something other\nthan “such,” but conceptualizing nirvanic\nexperience as encountering li does not present activity as\nsomething other than activity. Dushun’s first innovation thereby\nopens the way to developing a metaphysical theory (conceptualization)\nabout reality as encountered during nirvanic experience.  \nThe second innovation in Discernments of the Dharmadhatu is\nDushun’s decision to use the Chinese term shi\n(thing/events/phenomena) to refer to the myriad things that appear in\nour experiences of reality. Indian Mahayana prefers to oppose\nemptiness to form, where form stands in as one of the myriad\ndharmas that constitute reality. Strictly speaking, then, the\nequivalence “emptiness is form, form is emptiness” is a\nclaim only about the relation between the dharmas\nand the notion of emptiness: it is the claim that all dharmas\nare empty. This equivalence says nothing about whether composite\nrealities—such as persons and chariots—are empty.  \nThe distinction between dharmas and composite realities makes\nsense in the Abhidharma tradition: dharmas are real,\ncomposites are empty. But all Mahayana traditions claim that\ndharmas are empty as well. So Dushun’s second\ninnovation makes Mahayana metaphysics more efficient: absent a reason\nto distinguish dharmas from the constituents built therefrom,\neverything is on an ontological par, dharma and\nnon-dharma alike.  \nDushun titles the second discernment the “mutual non-obstruction\nbetween li and shi.” He divides the\ndiscernment into ten themes, which naturally group into five pairs:\n \nThese five mutual relationships specify the meaning of “mutual\nnon-obstruction.” Since the first is fundamental to the\nremaining four, we focus on understanding the “pervasion”\nrelation between li and shi.  \nThe mutual pervasion of li and shi presents itself\nas paradoxical. Li is boundless and ceaseless. Shi\nare limited and impermanent. Pervade means “to spread through\nand be totally in every part of.” The paradox is that it is not\nat all clear how the limited and the unlimited can pervade each other.\nWould not the boundless become bounded by virtue of being\ncontained within something limited? Would not the limited, by virtue\nof being limited, need to become unlimited in order to spread\nthrough every part of the boundless? The first pairing in\nDushun’s second discernment seems to violate two quite plausible\nconstraints, namely: nothing limited contains anything boundless; and\nnothing limited appears throughout anything boundless.  \nDushun admits that his claim of mutual pervasion “transcends\nconventional sensibilities.” However, he offers a metaphor for\nclarification, comparing li to water and shi to\nwaves. This metaphor, originating with the Lankavatara Sutra,\nposits that each wave contains the entire ocean, and that each wave\nappears in every part of the ocean. These posits are not entirely\nimplausible. Individual waves extend across the entire ocean, insofar\nas waves lack natural borders for extension; and waves extend beneath\nthe surface of ocean waters, insofar as waves also lack natural\nborders for thickness. But, regardless of plausibility, the metaphor\nsuggests that the mutual pervasion of li and shi\namounts to the claim that none of the myriad things has natural\nborders even though they appear to have them (by virtue of presenting\nto us as discrete individuals that are separate from and independent\nof each other).  \nThe third discernment in Discernment of the Dharmadhatu is\n“total pervasion and accommodation.” This discernment\nconcerns the nature of and relations among individual shi.\nDushun observes that each shi is nothing other than\nli and yet, in its individuality, distinct from li;\nthat each shi includes, and is included within, all other\nshi; that this mutual inclusivity makes each shi\nsomehow omnipresent, albeit in ways that preserve differences among\nshi; that each shi contains, and is contained by,\nall other shi; that this mutual containment, while preserving\ndifferences among shi, is fractal, such that even the\nsmallest mote of dust contains the entirety of everything else, which\nin turn contains the same mote of dust containing everything else, on\nand on ad infinitum; and that mutual inclusion and\ncontainment is simultaneous and, somehow, a matter of perspective.\nThese claims are, somehow, consequences of the mutual pervasion of\nli and shi. It remains for subsequent contributors\nto the Huayan School to explain and elaborate upon Dushun’s\nfinal discernment.  \nTradition identifies Zhiyan as the second patriarch of the Huayan\nSchool. Zhiyan entered the Buddhist sangha under the tutelage of\nDushun, who exposed him to the Avatamsaka Sutra at Zhixiang\nTemple. But the youthful Zhiyan was also keenly interested in\ndoctrinal matters, and he studied a wide variety of texts and learned\nfrom masters of other schools. His encyclopedic scholarly knowledge of\nBuddhism, paired with uncertainty about how the many doctrines of the\nmany Buddhist schools cohere with each other and an abiding concern\nwith the charge that Buddhism neglects practical matters, led the\nyoung Zhiyan to become disheartened and confused.  \nRather than follow the more typical path of monk-scholars, Zhiyan left\npublic life, spending some 20 years wandering the countryside and\npreaching to the laity. He returned to Chang’an in the late\n640s, whereupon he attracted many disciples—chief among them\nFazang (who would later become the Third Patriarch) and the Korean\nmonk Uisang (625–702), who took Huayan to Korea. In 661, Prince Pei,\nson of Emperor Gaozu and Empress Wu, appointed Zhiyan as a chief\nlecturer. (This appointment may have been a factor in granting Fazang\nthe access to the royal court that was so important in his later\ncareer.) Zhiyan spent his remaining years teaching and refining his\nearlier work with scholarly detail.  \nPerhaps the most significant of Zhiyan’s later works is his\nEssays on Sundry Topics in the Huayan Sutra (Ch. Huayan\nJing Nei Zhang Men Deng Za Kong Mu Zhang; T45.1870). Here Zhiyan\nintroduced a five-tiered panjiao. Lowest in rank for this\npanjiao are Abhidharma teachings that posit the existence of\ndharmas with self-natures (svabhava). The second and\nthird ranks then encompass the sectarian Mahayana teachings\nresponsible for Zhiyan’s early confusions. These teachings\nacknowledge that everything, dharmas as well as constructions\nthereof, is empty of self-nature. But they do so in different ways.\nSome, such as Madhyamaka, take universal and thoroughgoing emptiness\nto preclude the possibility of experiencing or knowing a reality that\nis free of conceptual construction. Others, such as the\ntathagatagarbha theory of Yogacara, ground universal and\nthoroughgoing emptiness upon a pure and untainted consciousness.\nZhiyan classifies teachings without a pure and untainted ground for\nemptiness as “elementary” and those with such a ground as\n“advanced,” ranking them second and third in his\npanjiao, respectively.  \nThe second tier of Zhiyan’s panjiao stands to the third\ntier as Dushun’s first discernment stands to his second. In both\ncases, the latter makes claim to a more penetrating insight into the\nsignificance of dependent arising, by virtue of applying not only to\ndharmas but also to constructions thereof. For both Zhiyan\nand Dushun, the more penetrating insight seems to reveal a preference\nfor kataphatic accounts—focusing on the positive import of\ndependent arising, as manifest with doctrines about\ntathata—over apophatic accounts that focus on the\nconnections between dependent arising and emptiness.  \nSimilarly, the third tier of Zhiyan’s panjiao stands to\nsubsequent tiers as Dushun’s second discernment stands to his\nthird, delving further into the nature of and relations among\nindividual shi. But Zhiyan’s panjiao, unlike\nDushun’s discernments, offers a doctrinal motivation for\nproceeding to higher stages. The motivation, in brief, is that no\nMahayana teaching, elementary or advanced, explains both the origins of\nenlightenment and the origins of ignorance (as the main cause of\nbarriers to enlightenment). Some Mahayana teachings ground the\nemptiness of reality upon something impure and tainted, laden with\nhindrances and defilements. These teachings accommodate ignorance. Yet\nthey struggle to explain how enlightenment—pure and\nuntainted—arises from the impure and tainted. Other Mahayana\nteachings ground the emptiness of reality upon something pure and\nuntainted. Yet they struggle to explain how such a ground gives rise\nto hindrance and defilement.  \nZhiyan claims that the teachings of the Avatamsaka Sutra\novercome the limitations of the “elementary” and\n“advanced” Mahayana. (He claims this virtue for the\nteachings of the Lotus Sutra as well.) For Zhiyan, the\nAvatamsaka Sutra reveals an unmediated vision of ultimate\nreality that resolves all conflict among opposites. He calls this a\nvision of the “dharma-realm of dependent\narising.” This realm stands in contrast, conceptually, with the\nrealm of “dependent origination” (Skt.\npratitya-samutpada) familiar from earlier Buddhist teaching.\nThe realm of dependent origination concerns relations of dependence\namong conditioned and illusory dharmas, and in particular\nrelations that help to sustain or extinguish samsaric modes\nof experience. By contrast, the dharma-realm of dependent\narising concerns relations that pertain to nirvanic modes of\nexperience. The most pertinent of these relations, for Zhiyan’s\npanjiao, is the relation between the unmediated vision of\nultimate reality and nirvanic experience itself. According to\nZhiyan, these stand to each other as cause and result, respectively.\nHe calls the teaching that pertains to the first (cause) the “sudden” teaching; and the teaching that pertains to the\nsecond (result), the “round” teaching. Ranking result as\nsuperior to cause thereby completes his five-tiered panjiao.\n \nZhiyan endeavors to explain the Avatamsaka Sutra’s\nvision of reality in his Ten Mysteries of the One Vehicle of\nHuayan (Ch. Huayan Yicheng Shixuan Men; trans. Cleary\n1993, 125–146). He does so with his doctrine of the ten mysteries (Ch.\nshi xuan) of the dharma-realm of dependent arising.\nEach mystery is meant to reveal some aspect of the Avatamsaka\nSutra’s vision of reality. These aspects do not quite\ncorrespond with Dushun’s ten claims about the “total\npervasion and accommodation” of each shi with all\nothers (in his third discernment). But subsequent contributors to the\nHuayan School understand Zhiyan’s mysteries as an effort to\nelaborate upon these claims.  \nZhiyan intends for the ten mysteries to apply to ten categories of\ndharmas. He presents each category as a pairing among\ncontraries: doctrine and meaning, li and shi,\nunderstanding and practice, cause and result, person and\ndharma, realms and stages, teacher and disciple, chief and\nattendants, substance and function, response and stimulus. But there\nis no apparent pattern or system to the order in which Zhiyan presents\nthe ten mysteries, nor does Zhiyan explain how each category applies\nto each mystery.  \nFor the sake of illustration, consider each mystery as it pertains to\nthe category of shi. (1) Each shi simultaneously\ncauses, and results from, all other shi. (2) Each relates to\nall other shi in a manner that might be described as\n“fractal”: reflecting all others, being reflected by those\nothers, reflecting those reflections, being reflected in reflections\nof those reflections, and so on ad infinitum, akin to a jewel\nof Indra’s net. (3) The arising of each shi is\nsimultaneous with its cessation, and each shi’s\nrevealing itself to nirvanic awareness coincides with the\nconcealment of its dependence upon other shi. (4) Each is\nendowed with the qualities of all others and so, for example,\nmanifests as simultaneously the smallest particle of dust and the\ngreat Mount Sumeru. (5) Each shi, appearing in a single\ninstant of thought, is simultaneously past, present, and future; and\neach of these times has its own past, present, and future. (6) Each\nshi is simultaneously pure, insofar as it is identical with\nall other shi, and mixed, insofar as it contains all other\nshi within itself. (7) Each shi simultaneously\nincludes, and is included within, all other shi, yet without\nlosing its distinctness from those others. (8) Each is identical with\nall others, in the sense that each determines the identity and power\nof all others—and has its identity and power determined by those\nothers—without losing its distinctness. (9) Each shi is\nnothing more than a creation of mind. (10) Each shi reveals the round teaching of the Avatamsaka Sutra and\nfosters understanding of the nature of ultimate reality.  \nMany of Zhiyan’s mysteries have a paradoxical flavor, presenting\nshi with apparently contrary characteristics. But Zhiyan\nfinds mystery rather than contradiction. His insight seems to involve\na sort of aspectualism, whereby contrary characteristics are ascribed\nto different aspects of one and the same shi, and where\nopposition among these aspects is a matter of perspectival limitation\nrather than inherent contradiction. This perspectival aspectualism\nsupports, as a corollary, Zhiyan’s doctrine of the six\ncharacteristics. According to this doctrine, each shi creates\nall others while retaining its particularity, includes all others\nwithin itself while retaining its difference from them, and integrates\nothers into a whole without cooperating with those others to do so.\nBut Zhiyan provides little by way of explanation for these\ncharacteristics. Nor does he provide explanatory detail for locating\nthe full diversity of experience in a common foundational source of\nmind. These tasks fall to his successors.  \nFazang is Zhiyan’s most accomplished and influential student,\nand became the third patriarch of Huayan. He is responsible for\nsystematizing and extending Zhiyan’s teaching, and for securing\nthe prominence of Huayan-style Buddhism at the imperial court. He is\nknown especially for his definitive commentaries on the Avatamsaka\nSutra and Awakening of Faith in Mahayana, and for making\nHuayan doctrines accessible to laity with familiar technologies such\nas mirror halls and wood-block printing. These contributions support\nthe traditional regard for Fazang as the third patriarch of the Huayan\nSchool. \nFazang’s ancestors came from Sogdiana (a center for trade along\nthe Silk Road, located in what is now parts of Uzbekistan and\nTajikestan), but he was born in the Tang dynasty capital of\nChang’an (now Xi’an), where his family had become\nculturally Chinese. Fazang was a fervently religious adolescent.\nFollowing a then-popular custom that took self-immolation as a sign of\nreligious devotion, Fazang burned his fingers before a stupa at the\nage of 16. After becoming a monk, he assisted Xuanzang—famous\nfor his pilgrimage to India—in translating Buddhist works from\nSanskrit into Chinese. Fazang had doctrinal differences with Xuanzang,\nthough, so he later became a disciple of Zhiyan, probably around 663\nCE.  \nZhiyan’s access to the imperial court gave Fazang access to\nEmpress Wu, with whom he quickly gained favor. He undertook a variety\nof public services, such as performing rain-prayer rituals and\ncollaborating in various translation projects. He traveled throughout\nnorthern China, teaching the Avatamsaka Sutra and debating\nDaoists. He intervened in a 697 military confrontation with the\nKhitans, gaining further favor when Empress Wu ascribed to his ritual\nservices an instrumental role in suppressing the rebellion. In\naddition, Fazang provided information to undermine plots by some of\nthe empress’ advisors to secure power after her death. This\nsecured Fazang’s status—and the prominence of Huayan\nteachings—with subsequent rulers.  \nThe tenth and final chapter of Treatise on the Five Teachings of\nHuayan (Ch. Huayan Wujiao Zhang; T45.1866, trans. Cook\n1970) contains many of Fazang’s most distinctive and important\ndoctrines. In the first section, Fazang develops his theory of the\nthree natures. The original theory was developed in Yogacara Buddhism,\nand posits three “realities”: first, that there is nothing\nbut ineffable, inexpressible reality that resembles space, gold, and\nwater in its absolute natural purity; second, that this reality\nappears as an unreal imaginative construction; and third, that this\nunreal construction is the basis for error, which arises through\nconfusing the construction for reality.  \nIn his \n Three Natures Treatise,\n the Yogacara philosopher\nVasubandhu names the natures for each of these three\n“realities.” He says that inexpressible and ineffable\nreality has the nature of “consummation” (or perfection):\nthis reality is perfect, and its nature is nothing other than\nemptiness. He says that unreal imaginative constructions, appearances\nappearing as nothing other than appearances, have the nature of\n“other-dependence,” which is synonymous with dependent\narising (pratitya-samutpada). He says, finally, that\nconfusions about unreal imaginative constructions have the nature of\n“fabrication” (or imagination, or discrimination).  \nThe Madhyamaka tradition eventually endorsed a version of the three\nnature theory, albeit with some significant differences from the\nYogacara version. According to the Yogacara theory, while the\nfabricated nature is empty, the other-dependent and consummate natures\nare real. The imaginative constructions associated with the\nother-dependent nature—the karmic seeds in the repository\nconsciousness—must have some aspect that is real, according to\nYogacarins, lest there be nowhere for them to await their future\nactualization; and the ineffable reality associated with the\nconsummate nature also must have some aspect that is real, for the\nsake of avoiding the error of annihilationism. Madhyamakins reject the\nYogacarin reasoning as fallacious, preferring an epistemological\nrather than an ontological interpretation of the three natures. The\nchallenge with the epistemological interpretation, however, is making\nsense of how (delusional) appearances are possible in the absence of\nanything real.  \nFazang’s strategy for resolving this debate involves adapting\nthe perspective-taking tactic of the Awakening of Faith in\nMahayana to the three nature theory, ascribing two aspects to\neach nature. According to Fazang’s theory, one of the two\naspects associated with each nature is fundamental, the other is\nderivative. The fundamental aspects are, respectively: pure and\nunchanging, lacking self-nature (svabhava), and non-existence\nfrom the standpoint of reality—that is, being nothing more than\nconvention. The derivative aspects are: confluence to conditions,\napparent existence as thoroughly interdependent, and common-sense\nexistence (which involves a capacity to appear as if possessed of\nself-nature).  \nYogacarins and Madhyamkins both endorse the derivative aspect for each\nnature. So Fazang’s technique for justifying his theory is\ntwofold: first, argue that the fundamental aspects associated with\nthe three natures are compatible with each other; second, argue that\neach nature has its fundamental aspect if and only if it has its\nderivative aspect. Since everyone accepts that the derivative\naspects are legitimate and correct, it should then follow that the\nfundamental aspects are legitimate and correct as well.\nFazang’s view thereby aims to include everything that is correct\nin the Yogacarin and Madyamakin views, while avoiding objections that\neach of those more limited views lodges against the other.  \nFazang’s three-nature theory foregrounds the other-dependent\nnature of reality—how reality appears when conceptualized by\nthose lacking delusion and ignorance. This introduces the possibility\nof developing a metaphysical theory about reality as it appears to\nthose who are enlightened. Fazang endorses two complementary analyses\nof this reality. One analysis focuses on dharmas insofar as they are\nresults, investigating the nondual relationality of One Mind (as\ncause) and the entirety of dharmas (as result). The other\nanalysis focuses on dharmas insofar as they are causes,\ninvestigating the mutual inclusion and identity among each individual\ndharma and all remaining dharmas.  \nIn his Commentary on Awakening of Faith in Mahayana (Ch.\nDasheng qixin lun yiji; T44.1846, trans. Vorenkamp 2004a),\nFazang identifies One Mind with tathagatagarbha.\nTathagatagarbha, as Fazang understands it, is neither an\nindividual consciousness nor something that stands apart from or\nopposed to matter. It is, instead, the one and only source of all that\nexists, creating and sustaining the dharma-realm of dependent\narising—albeit without separation from that realm. One Mind, for\nFazang, is reality prior to any individual consciousness and prior to\nthe objects of consciousness (whether mental or material). This\npriority is ontological, tracking the order with respect to which\nreality is structured into more or less fundamental components.  \nFazang posits that One Mind has two aspects, Suchness Mind and Samsara\nMind. Suchness Mind is free from discerning cognition, neither\nproduced nor destroyed. It witnesses that which is neither\n“this” nor “that” and yet is also not empty.\nSamsara Mind, by contrast, arises and ceases in accordance with\nconditions, transforming into purity and impurity.  \nFazang explains the relation between these two aspects of One Mind by\npositing a distinction between Suchness and Ignorance. Suchness is the\ntrue nature of reality. Fazang posits that Suchness has two aspects,\none unchanging, the other accompanying change. Suchness as unchanging\nis calm and quiescent. Suchness as accompanying change, by contrast,\nis dynamic, embedded within the ebb and flow of conditioned\ndharmas. Because Suchness is available for encounter only to\nwitnessing consciousness that lacks a sense of self, Fazang\ncharacterizes it as empty. Ignorance, by contrast, is that which\ninitiates dukkha. Fazang posits that it, too, has two\naspects. As empty, Ignorance renders its results illusory. As actively\nfunctioning and completing affairs, it perfumes conditioned\ndharmas with hindrances and defilements. Because it is\nresponsible for the appearance of illusory objects, Fazang\ncharacterizes this aspect as existing.  \nSuchness and Ignorance, on Fazang’s account, are the two\nfundamental aspects of One Mind. The aspects of Suchness as unchanging\nand Ignorance as empty correspond to Suchness Mind. This\ncorrespondence positions Suchness Mind as the witnessing of\nunconditioned dharmas. Similarly, the aspects of Suchness as\naccompanying change and Ignorance as actively functioning correspond\nto Samsara Mind. This correspondence positions Samsara Mind as the\nwitnessing of conditioned dharmas. (Fazang provides an\nelaborate analysis of Samsara Mind, inspired by the \n Yijing\n[Classic of Changes]. The gist of his analysis explains that,\nbecause Suchness is present to Samsara Mind, right practice for the\ncessation of dukkha involves attending to the Suchness aspect\nof conditioned dharmas rather than causing those\ndharmas to cease.)  \nIn the third section of the tenth chapter of Treatise on the Five\nTeachings of Huayan, Fazang offers eight theses on\ndharmas as dependently-arisen causes. Four theses concern\ndharmas with respect to their different substance\n(dharmas as they relate to all other dharmas): each\ndharma includes all others, is included within all others,\ndetermines the identity of all others, and has its identity determined\nby all others. The remaining four concern dharmas with\nrespect to their same substance (dharmas as they relate to\nthe totality of the dharma-realm of dependent arising): each\ndharma includes the totality of dharmas, is included\nwithin the totality, determines the identity of the totality, and has\nits identity determined by the totality.  \nFazang’s theses involve two salient posits. The first is that\nevery dharma simultaneously has the aspects of existing and\nbeing empty. As existing, each dharma appears as an\nindividual that is (numerically) distinct from others. As empty, each\ndharma lacks any sort of self-nature that would render it\ninvulnerable to others. Fazang’s second posit is that every\ndharma also simultaneously has the aspects of having power\nand lacking power. As powerful, each dharma affects others in\nways beyond their control and despite their resistance. As powerless,\neach dharma is vulnerable to others, affected by them in ways\nbeyond its own control and despite its resistance. Fazang uses these\nposits to argue that insofar as one dharma exists or has\npower, the others are empty and lack power; and that insofar as one\ndharma is empty or lacking power, the others exist and have\npower. His theses about mutual inclusion and identity follow as\ncorollaries.  \nFazang offers several metaphors to elucidate his claims about mutual\ninclusion and identity, such as the metaphor of Indra’s net and\nthe metaphor of counting ten coins. The most developed metaphor occurs\nin the fourth and final section of the tenth chapter of Treatise\non the Five Teachings of Huayan, where Fazang uses a metaphor of\na framed building to explain six characteristics of dharmas\nas dependently-arisen causes (Fazang 2014b). Fazang labels the six\ncharacteristics as wholeness, particularity, identity, difference,\nintegration, and disintegration. Each of these pertains to some\ncharacteristic an individual dharma has as a part of some\nintegrated whole, akin to the relation a rafter bears to a building.\nFazang’s explanations are notoriously dense. Roughly speaking,\nit seems that a dharma has wholeness insofar as it creates\nsome whole; particularity insofar as it is numerically distinct from\nthat whole; identity insofar as it includes all other parts of the\nwhole; difference insofar as it is numerically distinct from those\nothers; integration insofar as its creating the whole does not\ninterfere with every other dharma of the whole doing the\nsame; and disintegration insofar as its creative success does not\ndepend upon the cooperation of other dharmas in the whole.\n \nThe first nine chapters of Fazang’s Treatise on the Five\nTeachings of Huayan provide, in effect, an encyclopedic argument\nfor a panjiao system that positions Fazang’s views as\nsurpassing the limitations of all prior Buddhist traditions, but\nFazang provides no convenient summary. With some minor exceptions, the\nbasic outline follows Zhiyan’s panjiao.  \nThe first teaching in Fazang’s panjiao—the one he\nranks as conveying the least truth, as being the most limited in its\nskillful means—is what he calls Hinayana (and what we now call\nAbhidharma). Fazang offers three criticisms of this teaching. First,\nhe claims that the Abhidharmic analysis of consciousness is\nincomplete, because it does not provide a thorough analysis of\nrepository consciousness (alayavijnana)—that occurs\nonly with the Yogacara branch of the Mahayana tradition. Second, he\nclaims that the Abhidharmic analysis of dharmas is\nincomplete, because no school within the tradition manages to\nestablish a list of dharmas that contains all the\ndharmas contained by all other lists, and because the\ntradition cannot seem to resolve disagreements on the status of\ncertain putative dharmas. Third, and most importantly, he\nclaims that the Abhidharmic tradition remains committed to the error\nof Eternalism by virtue of denying that dharmas are empty.\n \nThe second teaching in Fazang’s panjiao is what he\ncalls Elementary Teaching of the Mahayana. These are the teachings of\nMadhyamaka and Yogacara, represented by figures such as Nagarjuna and\nVasubandhu in India, and by Jizang and Xuanzang in China. Fazang ranks\nthis teaching as superior to the first because it teaches that\neverything, dharma or not, is empty, and because the Yogacara\ntradition provides a thorough analysis of repository consciousness.\nBut, according to Fazang, the Yogacarin analysis of consciousness is\nerroneous because it mistakes the repository consciousness for some\nsort of ultimate reality. The repository consciousness, according to\nYogacara tradition, contains impurities and defilements. Yet ultimate\nreality, as Fazang understands it, is free of such imperfections.  \nThe third teaching in Fazang’s panjiao is what he calls\nthe Final Teaching of the Mahayana. Fazang has in mind teachings\nassociated with tathagatagarbha theory, as present in texts\nsuch as Awakening of Faith in Mahayana. According to Fazang,\nthe Final Teaching improves upon the Elementary Teaching by virtue of\ncorrectly understanding ultimate reality as pure and\nundefiled—not as repository consciousness, but as\ntathagatagarbha. The Final Teaching also transcends the\nlimitations of the prior two teachings—each of which focuses on\none of the pair “existence” and “emptiness” to\nthe exclusion of the other—by treating ultimate reality as\nhaving two aspects: an aspect of existing, and an aspect of being\nempty.  \nThere is a latent tension within tathagatagarbha theory, as\nFazang understands it. This is the tension between conceptualizing\nultimate reality as tathagatagarbha and conceptualizing\ntathagatagarbha as ineffable. This is why Fazang ranks the\nFinal Teaching of the Mahayana as inferior to a fourth teaching, which\nhe calls the Sudden Teaching. This is the teaching of Vimalakirti,\nfrom the Vimalakirti Sutra, who, in responding to a request\nto characterize ultimate reality, answers with silence. This is\nsuperior to the Final Teaching of Mahayana, according to Fazang,\nbecause the only way to succeed at conceptualizing the ultimate nature\nof reality is to refuse to conceptualize in the first place.  \nThe fifth and final teaching in Fazang’s\npanjiao—the pinnacle of Buddhist teaching, in his\nview—is what he calls the Round Teaching. Here Fazang refers to\nhis own teaching, which he positions as developing the\nteachings of his master, Zhiyan, and which he locates in fetal form\namong the writings of Dushun and amidst the many verses of the\nAvatamsaka Sutra. While the first teaching in Fazang’s\npanjiao focuses on the fabricated nature of reality, and\nwhile the three intermediate teachings focus on the consummate nature\nof reality, Fazang claims that only the Round Teaching accommodates\nall three natures of reality. For, according to the Round Teaching,\neverything is empty, and so the teaching correctly understands the\n“fabricated” nature of what seems to be not-empty; but the\nconsummate nature of ultimate reality is ineffable, and so the\nteaching manages to avoid the limitations of the Elementary and Final\nTeachings of Mahayana. Since, in Fazang’s view, only the Round\nTeaching understands the other-dependent nature of ultimate\nreality—a nature ignored by other Buddhist traditions—he\nconcludes that the Round Teaching, as expressed by his metaphysics, is\nsuperior to all other Buddhist teachings.  \nLi Tongxuan is a contemporary of Fazang’s who remained\nrelatively unknown during his lifetime, and so he lacks the honor of\nbeing considered one of the patriarchs of Huayan Buddhism. However,\nLi’s work came to exert substantial influence upon subsequent\nBuddhist tradition, through its impact on the Korean monk Chinul\n(1158–1210), the Japanese monk Moye (1173–1232), and the Linji Chan\nmasters Juefan Huihong (1071–1128) and Dahui Zonggao (1089–1163). We\nknow little about Li’s life. He lived as a reclusive lay exegete\nof Buddhism, leading an austere lifestyle involving a daily meal of\nonly seven rice cakes made with dates and cypress. He also seems to\nhave had extensive knowledge of the Book of Changes (Ch.\nYijing), presumably due to his being an offspring of the Tang\nroyal family. Li influenced the Huayan tradition through a handful of\nwritings: a commentary on the Avatamsaka Sutra (Ch. Xin\nhuayan jing lun; T36.1739), a summary of that commentary, and a\nchapter-by-chapter summary of the Avatamsaka Sutra itself.\nHis writings are notable for using the theory of yin-yang and\nthe Five Phases, as well as appealing to correlative reasoning, to\ndiscern soteriological significance in minor details such as\ngeographical directions, numbers, and the names of bodhisattvas.  \nLi’s central contribution to Huayan tradition is his teaching of\nthe one true dharma-realm (Ch. yi zhen fajie).\nAccording to this teaching, all places and objects in the world are\ntrue just as they are. There is no real ontological separation between\nthe sacred and the secular, enlightenment and ignorance, or the Buddha\nand sentient beings. Li’s teaching of the one true\ndharma-realm supports a subitist approach to enlightenment,\nwhereby sentient beings attain Buddhahood suddenly rather than\ngradually. It supports, as well, his decision to explicate Buddhist\nideas using classical Chinese texts, as manifested in his frequent\nappeal to the Book of Changes in his commentary on the\nAvatamsaka Sutra. According to Li, Chinese sages such as\nKongzi (Confucius) and Laozi (the traditional founder of Daoism), and\nChinese classics, offer instructions from bodhisattvas by virtue of\ntheir endeavoring to edify sentient beings—and because,\naccording to Li’s teaching, the ordinary human condition is the\nfoundation for enlightenment in this lifetime.  \nLi justifies his teaching of the one true dharma-realm with a\ndistinctive and non-temporal approach to existence. According to Li,\nexistence is not only subject to change but also entirely complete at\neach moment. Past, present, and future co-exist at every moment. This\nnon-temporality of existence resolves several problems Li identifies\nwith the notions of cause and effect. The first problem pertains to\nconceptual relation. If cause and effect are not simultaneous (arising\nat one and the same moment), Li argues, then because causes are not\nconsidered causes until their effects arise, effects precede their\ncauses. If, by contrast, cause and effect are simultaneous, causes\nbecome causes exactly when effects arise. The second problem pertains\nto temporal relation. If cause and effect are not simultaneous, Li\nargues, there is an inexplicable gap between the time at which a cause\narises and the time at which the effect of that cause arises. If, by\ncontrast, cause and effect are simultaneous, there is no such gap.\n \nIf past, present, and future intermingle, then insofar as sentient\nbeings who are now ignorant subsequently gain enlightenment, there is\nno ontological difference between being a sentient being and being a\nBuddha: sentient beings are simultaneously Buddhas. Li here diverges\nfrom Fazang’s more canonical Huayan teaching, whereby ignorance\nand enlightenment are different ontological aspects of the same one\nreality. On Li’s account, the difference between sentient beings\nand Buddhas, and between ignorance and enlightenment, is merely\nepistemological, a matter of confusion about the nature and conditions\nof dukkha.  \nLi finds scriptural support for his non-temporal approach to\nexistence, and his associated teaching of the one true\ndharma-realm, in two tales. The first, the tale of the dragon\ngirl, occurs in the Lotus Sutra, where the dragon girl\nattains enlightenment in a single moment. The second, the tale of\nSudhana, occurs in the Avatamsaka Sutra, where Sudhana\nattains enlightenment in a single lifetime. Li interprets both tales\nas examples illustrating that the moment in which the mind arises to\npractice the Buddhist path is the same as the moment in which one\nattains perfect enlightenment. Insofar as practice is the cause of the\neffect that is enlightenment, it follows that cause and effect are\nsimultaneous—and so all times coexist in one moment. (For Li,\nthe tale of the dragon girl is less perfect than the tale of Sudhana,\nbecause the dragon girl, unlike Sudhana, changes her body and\ngeographical location upon attaining enlightenment.)  \nChengguan’s life was marked by continual encounter with\ndifference. He lived through the reigns of nine Tang emperors, and his\nstudies ranged widely—including Buddhist doctrines and\nmeditation practices, classic works indigenous to China, as well as\nthe Indian Vedas and works on Indian science. Tradition\nidentifies Chengguan as the fourth patriarch of the Huayan School,\nbecause he studied under Fashen (718–778), who was a student of\nFazang’s student Huiyuan (673–743).  \nChengguan was a voluminous writer. He authored a commentary (with an\naccompanying subcommentary) on the Avatamsaka Sutra that\ndisplaced Fazang’s with respect to authority and influence, as\nwell as an influential commentary on Dushun’s Discernments\nof the Dharmadhatu (Ch. Huayan fajie xuan jing;\nT45.1883, trans. Cleary 1983, 71–124). He gave frequent lectures to\nimperial officials, and he wrote many essays at their request.\nChengguan’s writings are notable for quoting frequently from\nChinese classics, borrowing words but not meanings for the sake of\nmaking his teaching accessible to educated literati. This style is\nlikely a response to the weakened political status of Buddhism\nfollowing the An Lushan rebellion (755–763), which increased Chinese\nsuspicions of foreign traditions such as Buddhism and thereby\nheightened a need to show how Buddhist teachings harmonize with native\nChinese traditions.  \nChengguan’s most distinctive contribution to Huayan tradition is\nhis theory of the fourfold dharma-realm. This theory\nidentifies four ways of encountering the dharma-realm of\ndependent arising. Chengguan calls the first the dharma-realm\nof shi. Shi, for Chengguan, refers to form, mind,\nand other characteristics. Chengguan characterizes this realm as\nconditioned, akin to an illusion by virtue of lacking true substance\nand nature, and containing unreal characteristics. It is the\ndharma-realm encountered as particularized into innumerably\nmany distinct individuals. Chengguan calls the second\ndharma-realm the dharma-realm of li.\nChengguan understands li to refer to substance, nature,\nemptiness, quiescence, the immutable nature of all dharmas.\nHe characterizes this realm as identical with true nature. It is the\ndharma-realm encountered as originally pure and free from\ndefilement.  \nChengguan groups the remaining two dharma-realms together as\ndharma-realms of non-obstruction. The third, the\ndharma-realm of non-obstruction among shi and\nli, correlates with the second discernment from\nDushun’s Discernments of the Dharmadhatu. The fourth,\nthe dharma-realm of non-obstruction among shi and\nshi, correlates with the third discernment from\nDushun’s Discernments of the Dharmadhatu. Chengguan\nendorses Dushun’s analysis of these realms. He adds, to\nDushun’s insights, the claim that the non-obstruction of\nli and shi is the foundation for the non-obstruction\namong shi. His meaning is twofold. From a practical\nperspective, he means that meditative insight into li is a\nprerequisite for meditative insight into shi. From a\ntheoretical perspective, he means that shi are mutually\nidentical and inclusive by virtue of their common penetration by\nli: since each shi is identical with and includes\nli, and since li is identical with and includes all\nshi, each shi is identical with and includes all\nother shi.  \nChengguan further develops Huayan tradition by subsuming Chan\nteachings under the perfect teaching of Huayan. Huiyuan,\nFazang’s disciple, had criticized Fazang’s\npanjiao for including the Sudden Teaching. His criticism was\ntwofold. First, the Sudden Teaching does not belong, because\nFazang’s panjiao ranks teachings with respect to their\ncontent but the sudden teaching—as inexpressible—lacks\ncontent. Second, if one ranks teachings with respect to how well they\nexpress truth about ultimate reality, then the Sudden Teaching, by\nvirtue of teaching the inexpressibility of ultimate truth, is distinct\nfrom neither the Final Teaching of Mahayana nor the Round Teaching.\n \nChengguan presents Huiyuan’s panjiao as an artifact of\nhis impoverished understanding of Chan meditation practice. In\nresponse, and in an effort to defend Fazang’s panjiao,\nChengguan develops his own panjiao. He identifies the Sudden\nTeaching with the teachings of various Chan traditions. These\nteachings, as Chengguan understands them, use words to express the\nidentity of mind and Buddha; and the direct mind-to-mind transmission\nof this truth suffices to distinguish Chan from other Buddhist\ntraditions—with respect to practice if not content.  \nDespite Chengguan’s unfavorable evaluations of Huiyuan’s\nteachings, Chengguan followed Huiyuan in explicitly criticizing\nindigenous Chinese teachings of the ru (Confucians) and the\nDaoists. He identifies the cardinal teaching of the ru\ntradition as the five constant virtues—benevolence,\nrighteousness, propriety, wisdom, sincerity; the cardinal teaching of\nDaoism as spontaneity (Ch. ziran); and the cardinal teaching\nof Buddhism as causality (Ch. yinyuan). Chengguan’s\ncriticisms center upon the claim that non-Buddhist teachings endorse a\nkind of pseudo-causality that abnegates responsibility for actions and\ndenigrates the role of wisdom. Against the Yijing (associated\nwith Confucians), he argues that locating the source of the myriad\nthings in the transformations of yin and yang\nascribes responsibility for wisdom or stupidity to the impersonal\nworkings of heaven, thereby denying the role of consciousness in\ncreating reality. He develops a similar criticism against the\nDaodejing, which locates the source of the myriad things in\nDao and denigrates practices of cultivation as superfluous. Against\nthe Zhuangzi, finally, he argues that the emphasis upon\nspontaneity as fundamental means that enlightenment arises without\ncause rather than through careful practice, and that this is erroneous\nby virtue of ignoring the way ignorance and enlightenment depend upon\nprior conditions.  \nTradition identifies Zongmi as the fifth patriarch of Huayan. Zongmi\nspent his early years studying Confucian classics and Buddhism before\ntraining with the Chan (Zen) master Suizhou Daoyuan (750–820). Then,\nfollowing a brief period of studying the Avatamsaka Sutra\nwith Chengguan, Zongmi began an extensive period of writing. His\nefforts focused, at first, on gathering commentaries on various sutras\nand writing his own. In time, he focused on compiling Chan texts to\ncreate a canon for the Chan tradition. These efforts resulted in his\nachieving status as a patriarch for the Heze school of Chan. Although\nZongmi’s Collected Writings on the Source of Chan (Ch.\nChanyuan zhuquanji) is no longer extant, its preface,\nProlegomena to the Collected Writings on the Source of Chan\n(Ch. Chanyuan zhuquanji duxu; T48.2015, trans. Broughton\n2004), survives.  \nZongmi’s major philosophical work is Inquiry into the Origin\nof Humanity (Ch. Yuanren lun; T45.1886, trans. Gregory\n1995). The title of this book might be a play on Inquiry into the\nOrigin of the Way, an influential anti-Buddhist essay by the\nConfucian philosopher Han Yu (768–824). Zongmi’s book offers, in\neffect, an innovative panjiao system. The central innovation\nis its inclusion of Daoism and Confucianism. Zongmi’s discussion\nof the strengths and weaknesses of each view are detailed, and here we\npresent only some of his arguments.  \nZongmi states that \n Kongzi and \n Laozi are both great sages, and that\ntheir ethical teachings are extremely beneficial to the common people.\nHowever, Confucians and Daoists claim that humans, animals, and\ninanimate objects all come into existence from the same underlying\n“vital force” (Ch. qi, roughly similar to the\n“boundless” of Anaximander). Zongmi argues that this\ncreates an insoluble problem. Since vital force is originally without\nconsciousness, then since we receive this force in the same way\ngrasses and trees do, either we should lack consciousness or else\ngrasses and trees should be conscious. In addition, Confucians and\nDaoists believe that fate is governed by Heaven (Ch. tian, an\nimpersonal higher power), which acts in accordance with the moral Way.\nZongmi argues that they cannot explain why a moral Heaven allows the\nvirtuous to suffer and the vicious to flourish. Since some who lack\nvirtue flourish, while others with virtue suffer, the distribution of\nrewards and punishments is unjust.  \nZongmi argues that Buddhists can resolve both dilemmas. Regarding the\nproblem of evil, Zongmi appeals to the Buddhist doctrine of\nreincarnation to explain how the distribution of rewards and\npunishments in the universe is ultimately just. According to this\ndoctrine, the distribution of rewards and punishments is determined\nnot only by one’s actions in one’s current life but also\nby one’s actions in previous lives. So the flourishing of the\nvicious, and the suffering of the virtuous, is attributable to karma\nfrom their past lives.  \nAccording to Zongmi, the only plausible solution to the problem of\nconsciousness is that fundamental reality is mental, and\nnon-consciousness is the result of a kind of self-deception, where the\nmind fails to realize its objects as manifestations of itself. \nCompetition for power, prestige, and wealth led to sectarian conflicts\namong Buddhists, Daoists, and Confucians. In addition, some aspects of\ninstitutional Buddhism were socially problematic, including the vast\namounts of tax-exempt wealth controlled by monasteries and extreme\nreligious practices such as self-immolation and self-mutilation, which\nwere endorsed even by leading figures like Zhiyan and Fazang.\nEventually, Daoists encouraged the Tang Emperor Wuzong to launch the\nGreat Anti-Buddhist Persecution (Ch. huichang huifo) of\n842–846. During this period, Buddhist monks and nuns were forcibly\ndefrocked, temples and shrines were destroyed, and their property\nseized. Although the persecution only lasted until the emperor’s\ndeath and was reversed by the next emperor, Buddhism never fully\nrecovered from the damage to its social influence and intellectual\nprestige.  \nFollowing the decline of Buddhism, the movement known in the West as\n“Neo-Confucianism” became increasingly influential.\n Neo-Confucianism\n presents itself as a revival of the original\nteachings of Confucianism against the mistaken doctrines of Daoism and\nBuddhism. However, after centuries of Buddhist dominance in\nphilosophy, it was almost inevitable that Neo-Confucian thinkers would\nunconsciously reinterpret their tradition in the light of Buddhist\nconcepts. For example, we saw how the Chinese term li\n(principle/pattern) is central to Huayan metaphysics. It is also\ncentral to \n Neo-Confucian metaphysics,\n even though the term is of\nperipheral importance in the Confucian classics. For example, of the\nFour Books of the Confucian canon, “li”\noccurs precisely zero times in all of the Analects of\nConfucius and the Great Learning, only twice in the\nMean, and a mere seven times in the Mengzi. In none\nof the passages where it does occur is there any suggestion that the\nterm has any deep metaphysical importance. (A typical use is in a\ndialogue in which someone asks Mengzi for help with his lack of\neloquence, describing himself as “not patterned (li) in\nregard to my mouth.”) Nonetheless, Neo-Confucian philosophers\nlike \n Zhu Xi\n  (1130–1200) repeatedly use the term to explain what they\ntake to be the underlying meaning of the classics, and give it a\nmetaphysical meaning very reminiscent of Indra’s net. Similarly,\nthe Neo-Confucian emphasis on the dangers of “selfish\ndesires” (Ch. siyu) and “selfish thoughts”\n(Ch. siyi) is not characteristic of ancient Confucianism, but\nrather reflects the centrality of selfishness in Buddhist accounts of\nhuman wrongdoing.  \nHuayan Buddhism has largely died out as a distinct religious movement\nin China, Korea, and Japan; however, Huayan texts continue to be\nstudied and have been particularly influential on Chan Buddhism (Jap.\nZen). Huayan has also had a substantial influence on other\nphilosophies. The so-called “New Confucian Manifesto”\nadvocates the “rounded and spiritual wisdom” of the East\nas opposed to the “square” wisdom of the West (see Harris\n(trans.), Part 11, Other Internet Resources). Although they identify\nthe ultimate source of this distinction as the Classic of\nChanges, their description of it is reminiscent of the\n“round” wisdom advocated by\npanjiao theorists. In addition, Mou Zongsan, one of the\nco-authors of the “Manifesto,” wrote extensively and\nsympathetically about Huayan. Among contemporary philosophers, Graham\nPriest (2015) has shown how to formalize the ontology of Huayan using\nnon-standard set theory.

The distinctive contributions of Huayan\ninclude the doctrines that “one is all, and all is one,”\nthat ultimate reality is ontologically identical with the illusory\nworld of common sense, and that realizing these facts leads to\nuniversal compassion. Huayan is known also for the incisive nature of\nits arguments, particularly in Fazang’s “Rafter\nDialogue” and Zongmi’s On the Origin of\nHumanity.\n\n\nThe Chinese term “Huayan” means “Flower\nGarland” and comes from the Avatamsaka Sutra\n(Flower Garland Sutra), an Indian Sanskrit text. Huayan also\nshows the influence of the Madhyamaka doctrine of Nagarjuna, the\nYogacara School, and the teachings of Awakening of Faith in\nMahayana. However, Huayan is a distinctively Chinese form of\nBuddhism, particularly for the way that it interprets\n“emptiness” in terms of “interdependence” and\ntreats the natural world as possessing intrinsic value. Huayan spread\nto Korea (where it was known as “Hwaeom”) and to Japan\n(where it was called “Kegon”). Like other forms of Chinese\nBuddhism, Huayan identified a series of patriarchs who allegedly\ntransmitted the orthodox teachings of the tradition from master to\ndisciple. Of these, the two most important are Fazang and Zongmi.\n\n\nAlthough the vitality of the school in China lapsed after the\npersecution of Buddhism by Emperor Wuzong (842–846 CE), its doctrines,\nmetaphors, and vocabulary had a significant influence on Chan (Zen)\nBuddhism and the Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming dynasties.\n\nBuddhism was founded some time between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE\nin South Asia. The fundamental teachings of Buddhism are that ordinary\nlife is suffused with (Skt.) dukkha (often translated as\n“suffering”), and that dukkha is caused by the\nillusory belief in persistent individual selves. The belief in selves\nleads to endless craving (Skt. tanha) which is unsatisfiable,\nbecause it is a longing by one illusory entity (the personal self) to\npermanently possess other equally illusory things. Escape from craving\n(and hence dukkha) is only possible by achieving\nenlightenment, which is fully believing the truth of no-self (Skt.\nanatman). Enlightenment leads to universal compassion:\ndukkha is seen to belong to no one, so there is no reason to\nprefer the elimination of what would conventionally be described as\n“my suffering” to “your suffering” or\n“their suffering.” The illusory world of independent\nselves is referred to as (Skt.) “samsara,” and\nthe state achieved through enlightenment is (Skt.)\n“nirvana.”  \nThe two major sects of the Buddhist religion are Theravada and\nMahayana. These sects have a great variety of philosophical\nformulations, but three of the more influential schools are Abhidharma\n(Theravada), Madhyamaka (Mahayana), and Yogacara (Mahayana). Each of\nthese schools interprets the key concepts of Buddhism in different\nways. \n Abhidharma Buddhists\n argue that the things that are taken to be\nindependent, persistent selves by common sense (such as particular\nmonks like “Nagasena” and objects like chariots) exist\nonly by convention. However, these conventionally existing entities\nare ontologically grounded in other, genuinely existing (Skt.)\n dharmas\n (entities such as instantaneous configurations of\nmatter, or temporary mental states). Although these dharmas\nare transient and causally dependent on one another, they also possess\na self-nature (Skt. \n svabhava).  \nIn contrast, Madhyamaka Buddhists (like Nagarjuna) argue that, because\nall dharmas are causally dependent, nothing is ultimately\ngrounded. They describe this by saying that reality is characterized\nby “emptiness” \n(Skt. sunyata), in the sense that\neverything is “empty” of self-nature and an independent,\npersistent self. The doctrine of emptiness is easy to misunderstand,\nand is sometimes mistakenly conflated with metaphysical nihilism.\nHowever, Buddhists distinguish their view from both Annihilationism\n(Skt. uccheda-drsti) and Eternalism (Skt.\nsasvata-drsti). Annihilationism is the view that nothing\nexists in any sense, while Eternalism is the view that something\nexists that is eternal, unchanging, and unconditioned by anything\nelse. Madhyamaka denies both extremes, and holds that while\ndharmas do exist, each dharma’s existence is\n“conditioned” (causally or conceptually dependent) on\nsomething else, without any ultimate ground.  \nYogacara\n offers a third alternative: everything is “empty”\nof a mind-independent self. All that exists are mental states.\nConsistent with the doctrine of “no-self,” Yogacara\nBuddhists deny that there is a substantial entity that has, thinks, or\nexperiences the mental states. However, in order to explain why there\nare correlations among experiences (for example, why the apparent\nexperience of “my starting a fire” is correlated with the\napparent experience of “you feeling warmth”), Yogacara\nposits a \n repository consciousness\n (Skt. alayavijnana) which\nmetaphorically contains the “seeds” of previous\nexperiences that bear fruit in later experiences.  \nBuddhism was brought to China by missionaries some time during the\nfirst century CE. Indian scriptures and expositions arrived in China\npiecemeal, with the result that early Chinese adherents to Buddhism\ndid not perceive contributions from different Indian traditions as\nfundamentally inconsistent. Chinese Buddhism is thus eclectic in its\nuse of concepts from what were originally distinct Indian Buddhist\nschools. This, in turn, led to the practice of (Ch.) panjiao\n(doctrinal classification), according to which different philosophical\nsystems are treated not as exclusive, but as partial conceptions of\nthe truth, which can be arranged hierarchically in terms of how\ncomplete (literally, “rounded,” Ch. yuan) their\ngrasp of the truth is. To use Western terminology, one might say that\npanjiao is a form of inference to the best explanation, since\nthe more comprehensive teachings are shown to offer a more plausible\nand comprehensive interpretation of the relevant ethical,\nmetaphysical, and empirical assumptions.  \nUpon gradually growing in influence, Buddhism became one of the\n“Three Teachings” (Ch. San jiao) of the Chinese\ntradition, along with Confucianism and Daoism. In fact, at times\nBuddhism has been the dominant religious and philosophical movement in\nChina (among both intellectuals and commoners). However, there have\nbeen several periods of Buddhist persecution in Chinese history. In\n567 CE, Wei Yuansong (n.d.), having left the Buddhist order, argued to\nEmperor Wu of the Northern Zhou (543–578, ruled 561–578) that Buddhism\nshould be de-institutionalized. He argued that Buddhism is responsible\nfor social instability because its various institutions—monastic\nliving, internal hierarchies, and freedom from political\ncontrol—undermine harmony-facilitating Chinese culture and\ntradition by virtue of facilitating corruption among monks and by\nisolating Buddhism from practical affairs (Ch. shi).  \nEmperor Wu’s subsequent persecutions of Buddhism, in 574 and\n577, disrupted Buddhist institutions. Many monks fled to rural areas,\nseeking forms of Buddhism better suited to a Chinese context.\nSearching for ways to make Buddhism more accessible to laity, for more\namenable practices and more achievable ideals, they also began\nexploring in earnest scriptures that receive little if any attention\nin the well-established schools of Indian Buddhism. The lack of\ndefinitive commentaries on these scriptures from established Indian\ntraditions, together with political disruptions to the inertia of\nextant scholarly traditions of Buddhism, permitted a freedom of\ncreative appropriation and innovation that resulted in traditions of\nBuddhism unique to the Chinese context.  \nHuayan is one of these traditions. Chief among the scriptures\nresponsible for its distinctive teachings are the Avatamsaka\n(Flower Garland) Sutra and Awakening of Faith in\nMahayana. Huayan takes its name from the Avatamsaka\nSutra (Ch. Huayan jing), which presents a dizzyingly\ncomplex and intricate vision of reality as thoroughly\n“interpenetrating,” of Buddhahood as coextensive with all\nthere is, and of the features of reality as completely dependent upon\nthe mind and deeds of sentient beings. Awakening of Faith in\nMahayana develops the theory of the tathagatagarbha,\n(Skt. for “Buddha-embryo” or “Buddha-womb”),\nthe potentiality of Buddhahood. It posits One Mind as the foundation\nof reality. It also ascribes to One Mind two aspects, tathata\n(Skt. for “suchness” or “thusness”) and\nsamsara. Tathata refers to reality as experienced\nwithout dukkha; it is generally taken to be non-conceptual\nand hence incapable of being expressed in words. Samsara is\nreality as experienced with dukkha. Awakening of Faith in\nMahayana presents these aspects as mutually inclusive and\ninseparable.  \nThrough the fusion of the ideas of the Avatamsaka Sutra and\nAwakening of Faith in Mahayana, Huayan Buddhism developed a\ndistinctive interpretation of the concepts of “emptiness”\nand “no-self.” The original Indian Buddhist view that\nthere are no selves transformed into the Chinese Buddhist view that\nthere is no individual self, but there is a sort of\ntranspersonal self (One Mind) of which all the transient and\nontologically interdependent aspects of reality are parts. The\nfundamental human vice is selfishness, which is caused by the illusory\nbelief in individual selves, and the fundamental human virtue is\nuniversal compassion, which is caused by the recognition that we are\nall parts of one, transpersonal reality. To fail to have compassion\nfor another person is like ignoring a wound to my own limb because it\nis temporarily numb.  \nHuayan inherits from Madhyamaka the view that all entities are\nconditioned. To be conditioned is for an entity to be causally or\nconceptually dependent for its existence and its identity on something\nelse. However, Huayan takes the additional steps of arguing that,\nbecause the identity of any one thing is dependent on the identities\nof other things, “one is all,” and because the whole is\ndependent for its identity on its parts, “all is one.”\nHuayan adopts from Yogacara the terms “repository\nconsciousness” (alayavijnana) and “womb of the\nBuddha” (tathagatagarbha), which it uses to describe\nthe reality of the world in itself. The Third Patriarch Fazang\n(discussed more below) illustrates how “one is all and all is\none” with the relationship between a rafter and the building of\nwhich it is a part. He argues that the building is the rafter, because\nthe building is nothing more than the sum of its parts, so each part\nis essential to its identity. Conversely, the rafter is the building,\nbecause what makes the rafter a rafter is its role as a part of the\nbuilding. (Intuitively, if the rafter were removed from the building,\nits identity could change to being a bench, or a teeter-totter, or\nsimply kindling.)  \nOne of the metaphors from the Avatamsaka Sutra that is\nfrequently used to illustrate mutual interdependence is Indra’s\nnet (or “Indra’s web”). According to pre-Buddhist\nmyth, the god Indra has a net with a jewel at the intersection of\nevery two strands. Each jewel is so bright that it reflects every\nother jewel in the net. This is adopted as a metaphor for the manner\nin which each thing that exists is dependent for both its existence\nand its identity upon every other thing that exists.  \nSince the only thing that exists is this reality, the world of\nillusion (samsara) is no different ontologically from\nnirvana. (The slogan “Nirvana is\nsamsara” is antecedently present in Madhyamaka.) In other\nwords, samsara is simply a mistaken perception of the same\nultimate reality experienced in enlightenment. Fazang illustrates this\nwith the metaphor of a statue of a golden lion (Fazang 2014a). We\nshould not deny or fail to perceive the conventional fact that the\nstatue appears to be a lion. However, we must realize that there is no\nsense in which a lion is actually there, and even the appearance of\nthe lion is not a separate entity beyond the gold that is present. The\ngold can take on different forms (ore, ingots, coins, etc.), but in\nitself it is ultimately unchanging. Similarly, we should not deny or\nfail to perceive that ordinary reality appears to consist of distinct,\npersistent individuals. However, we must realize that there are not\nactually distinct, persistent individuals. All that really exists is\nthe complete network of mutually interdependent entities\n(dharmas), and this network (extended through all of time and\nspace) is eternal and unchanging.  \nDushun holds the posthumous honor of being known as the first\npatriarch of the Huayan School. He was active as a monk during the Sui\n(581–618) and early Tang (618–907) dynasties. We know very little\nabout his life. He had no sectarian affiliation, and he seems to have\nbeen relatively unconcerned with scholarly controversies. We know that\nhe was keenly interested in the Avatamsaka Sutra, and that he\nwas renowned as a meditation master. For a time, he served as leader\nof the Zhixiang Temple on Zhongnan Mountain, which was a center for\nstudying the Avatamsaka Sutra. His main interest seems to\nhave been ministering to rural laity for the sake of making Buddhist\npractice relevant to their lives—by hosting common meals,\ndistributing food to the poor, chanting scriptural passages, and\noffering edifying homilies.  \nDushun authored only a handful of texts. Chief among these is\nDiscernments of the Dharmadhatu of Avatamsaka (Ch. Huayan\nfajie guanmen, trans. Gimello 1976b, 457–510). This no longer\nexists as an independent text. But it is interspersed within several\ncommentaries, most notably those by Chengguan (T45.1883; trans. Cleary\n1993, 71–124) and Zongmi (T45.1884, trans. King 1976). The text itself\nis quite unusual. It is not a commentary on the Avatamsaka\nSutra. Nor does it offer exegesis of the Avatamsaka\nSutra. There are no paraphrases, no explanations of passages, no\ndefinitions or technical terminology. Instead, the text distils the\ncentral insights available through studying the Avatamsaka\nSutra. Its apparent goal is making the Avatamsaka Sutra\nrelevant to meditative practice and accessible to the laity.  \nDiscernments of the Dharmadhatu divides into three sections,\neach of which corresponds to a “discernment” or meditation\non the content of the Avatamsaka Sutra. The first discernment\nreviews the equivalence between form (Skt. rupa) and\nemptiness. This is a well-known equivalence from the Heart\nSutra and other literature from the Indian Mahayana tradition.\nNothing in this discernment should be unfamiliar to students of the\nhistory of Indian Buddhism. The second discernment, by contrast,\ncontains two innovations that are critical for understanding the\nChinese appropriation of Buddhism—and thereby renders the text\nespecially significant from a philosophical perspective.  \nThe first innovation is Dushun’s decision to use the Chinese\nterm li (principle/pattern) to characterize the nature of\nultimate reality. Indian Mahayana typically characterizes the nature\nof ultimate reality as emptiness (Skt. sunyata) or suchness\n(Skt. tathata). Both of these terms connote something that\ndefies conceptualization. Dushun imbues li with an\nepistemological connotation: li is that which is present to\nthose who achieve nirvana. Nirvanic experience, as\nDushun understands it, reveals neither emptiness nor an\nundifferentiated manifold but, instead, boundless and ceaseless\nactivity that has a patterned coherence to it (see Jiang 2001,\n466–467; for a contrary interpretation, see Gimello 1976a, 125).  \nBy discussing li—the boundless and ceaseless activity\npresent during nirvanic experience—rather than\nemptiness, Dushun forestalls any conflation between li and\ntotal voidness. Whatever else it might be, li is far\nfrom nothing at all. By discussing li rather than\ntathata, Dushun affords the possibility of saying something\nabout ultimate reality. Conceptualizing nirvanic experience\nas encountering suchness presents those experiences as something other\nthan “such,” but conceptualizing nirvanic\nexperience as encountering li does not present activity as\nsomething other than activity. Dushun’s first innovation thereby\nopens the way to developing a metaphysical theory (conceptualization)\nabout reality as encountered during nirvanic experience.  \nThe second innovation in Discernments of the Dharmadhatu is\nDushun’s decision to use the Chinese term shi\n(thing/events/phenomena) to refer to the myriad things that appear in\nour experiences of reality. Indian Mahayana prefers to oppose\nemptiness to form, where form stands in as one of the myriad\ndharmas that constitute reality. Strictly speaking, then, the\nequivalence “emptiness is form, form is emptiness” is a\nclaim only about the relation between the dharmas\nand the notion of emptiness: it is the claim that all dharmas\nare empty. This equivalence says nothing about whether composite\nrealities—such as persons and chariots—are empty.  \nThe distinction between dharmas and composite realities makes\nsense in the Abhidharma tradition: dharmas are real,\ncomposites are empty. But all Mahayana traditions claim that\ndharmas are empty as well. So Dushun’s second\ninnovation makes Mahayana metaphysics more efficient: absent a reason\nto distinguish dharmas from the constituents built therefrom,\neverything is on an ontological par, dharma and\nnon-dharma alike.  \nDushun titles the second discernment the “mutual non-obstruction\nbetween li and shi.” He divides the\ndiscernment into ten themes, which naturally group into five pairs:\n \nThese five mutual relationships specify the meaning of “mutual\nnon-obstruction.” Since the first is fundamental to the\nremaining four, we focus on understanding the “pervasion”\nrelation between li and shi.  \nThe mutual pervasion of li and shi presents itself\nas paradoxical. Li is boundless and ceaseless. Shi\nare limited and impermanent. Pervade means “to spread through\nand be totally in every part of.” The paradox is that it is not\nat all clear how the limited and the unlimited can pervade each other.\nWould not the boundless become bounded by virtue of being\ncontained within something limited? Would not the limited, by virtue\nof being limited, need to become unlimited in order to spread\nthrough every part of the boundless? The first pairing in\nDushun’s second discernment seems to violate two quite plausible\nconstraints, namely: nothing limited contains anything boundless; and\nnothing limited appears throughout anything boundless.  \nDushun admits that his claim of mutual pervasion “transcends\nconventional sensibilities.” However, he offers a metaphor for\nclarification, comparing li to water and shi to\nwaves. This metaphor, originating with the Lankavatara Sutra,\nposits that each wave contains the entire ocean, and that each wave\nappears in every part of the ocean. These posits are not entirely\nimplausible. Individual waves extend across the entire ocean, insofar\nas waves lack natural borders for extension; and waves extend beneath\nthe surface of ocean waters, insofar as waves also lack natural\nborders for thickness. But, regardless of plausibility, the metaphor\nsuggests that the mutual pervasion of li and shi\namounts to the claim that none of the myriad things has natural\nborders even though they appear to have them (by virtue of presenting\nto us as discrete individuals that are separate from and independent\nof each other).  \nThe third discernment in Discernment of the Dharmadhatu is\n“total pervasion and accommodation.” This discernment\nconcerns the nature of and relations among individual shi.\nDushun observes that each shi is nothing other than\nli and yet, in its individuality, distinct from li;\nthat each shi includes, and is included within, all other\nshi; that this mutual inclusivity makes each shi\nsomehow omnipresent, albeit in ways that preserve differences among\nshi; that each shi contains, and is contained by,\nall other shi; that this mutual containment, while preserving\ndifferences among shi, is fractal, such that even the\nsmallest mote of dust contains the entirety of everything else, which\nin turn contains the same mote of dust containing everything else, on\nand on ad infinitum; and that mutual inclusion and\ncontainment is simultaneous and, somehow, a matter of perspective.\nThese claims are, somehow, consequences of the mutual pervasion of\nli and shi. It remains for subsequent contributors\nto the Huayan School to explain and elaborate upon Dushun’s\nfinal discernment.  \nTradition identifies Zhiyan as the second patriarch of the Huayan\nSchool. Zhiyan entered the Buddhist sangha under the tutelage of\nDushun, who exposed him to the Avatamsaka Sutra at Zhixiang\nTemple. But the youthful Zhiyan was also keenly interested in\ndoctrinal matters, and he studied a wide variety of texts and learned\nfrom masters of other schools. His encyclopedic scholarly knowledge of\nBuddhism, paired with uncertainty about how the many doctrines of the\nmany Buddhist schools cohere with each other and an abiding concern\nwith the charge that Buddhism neglects practical matters, led the\nyoung Zhiyan to become disheartened and confused.  \nRather than follow the more typical path of monk-scholars, Zhiyan left\npublic life, spending some 20 years wandering the countryside and\npreaching to the laity. He returned to Chang’an in the late\n640s, whereupon he attracted many disciples—chief among them\nFazang (who would later become the Third Patriarch) and the Korean\nmonk Uisang (625–702), who took Huayan to Korea. In 661, Prince Pei,\nson of Emperor Gaozu and Empress Wu, appointed Zhiyan as a chief\nlecturer. (This appointment may have been a factor in granting Fazang\nthe access to the royal court that was so important in his later\ncareer.) Zhiyan spent his remaining years teaching and refining his\nearlier work with scholarly detail.  \nPerhaps the most significant of Zhiyan’s later works is his\nEssays on Sundry Topics in the Huayan Sutra (Ch. Huayan\nJing Nei Zhang Men Deng Za Kong Mu Zhang; T45.1870). Here Zhiyan\nintroduced a five-tiered panjiao. Lowest in rank for this\npanjiao are Abhidharma teachings that posit the existence of\ndharmas with self-natures (svabhava). The second and\nthird ranks then encompass the sectarian Mahayana teachings\nresponsible for Zhiyan’s early confusions. These teachings\nacknowledge that everything, dharmas as well as constructions\nthereof, is empty of self-nature. But they do so in different ways.\nSome, such as Madhyamaka, take universal and thoroughgoing emptiness\nto preclude the possibility of experiencing or knowing a reality that\nis free of conceptual construction. Others, such as the\ntathagatagarbha theory of Yogacara, ground universal and\nthoroughgoing emptiness upon a pure and untainted consciousness.\nZhiyan classifies teachings without a pure and untainted ground for\nemptiness as “elementary” and those with such a ground as\n“advanced,” ranking them second and third in his\npanjiao, respectively.  \nThe second tier of Zhiyan’s panjiao stands to the third\ntier as Dushun’s first discernment stands to his second. In both\ncases, the latter makes claim to a more penetrating insight into the\nsignificance of dependent arising, by virtue of applying not only to\ndharmas but also to constructions thereof. For both Zhiyan\nand Dushun, the more penetrating insight seems to reveal a preference\nfor kataphatic accounts—focusing on the positive import of\ndependent arising, as manifest with doctrines about\ntathata—over apophatic accounts that focus on the\nconnections between dependent arising and emptiness.  \nSimilarly, the third tier of Zhiyan’s panjiao stands to\nsubsequent tiers as Dushun’s second discernment stands to his\nthird, delving further into the nature of and relations among\nindividual shi. But Zhiyan’s panjiao, unlike\nDushun’s discernments, offers a doctrinal motivation for\nproceeding to higher stages. The motivation, in brief, is that no\nMahayana teaching, elementary or advanced, explains both the origins of\nenlightenment and the origins of ignorance (as the main cause of\nbarriers to enlightenment). Some Mahayana teachings ground the\nemptiness of reality upon something impure and tainted, laden with\nhindrances and defilements. These teachings accommodate ignorance. Yet\nthey struggle to explain how enlightenment—pure and\nuntainted—arises from the impure and tainted. Other Mahayana\nteachings ground the emptiness of reality upon something pure and\nuntainted. Yet they struggle to explain how such a ground gives rise\nto hindrance and defilement.  \nZhiyan claims that the teachings of the Avatamsaka Sutra\novercome the limitations of the “elementary” and\n“advanced” Mahayana. (He claims this virtue for the\nteachings of the Lotus Sutra as well.) For Zhiyan, the\nAvatamsaka Sutra reveals an unmediated vision of ultimate\nreality that resolves all conflict among opposites. He calls this a\nvision of the “dharma-realm of dependent\narising.” This realm stands in contrast, conceptually, with the\nrealm of “dependent origination” (Skt.\npratitya-samutpada) familiar from earlier Buddhist teaching.\nThe realm of dependent origination concerns relations of dependence\namong conditioned and illusory dharmas, and in particular\nrelations that help to sustain or extinguish samsaric modes\nof experience. By contrast, the dharma-realm of dependent\narising concerns relations that pertain to nirvanic modes of\nexperience. The most pertinent of these relations, for Zhiyan’s\npanjiao, is the relation between the unmediated vision of\nultimate reality and nirvanic experience itself. According to\nZhiyan, these stand to each other as cause and result, respectively.\nHe calls the teaching that pertains to the first (cause) the “sudden” teaching; and the teaching that pertains to the\nsecond (result), the “round” teaching. Ranking result as\nsuperior to cause thereby completes his five-tiered panjiao.\n \nZhiyan endeavors to explain the Avatamsaka Sutra’s\nvision of reality in his Ten Mysteries of the One Vehicle of\nHuayan (Ch. Huayan Yicheng Shixuan Men; trans. Cleary\n1993, 125–146). He does so with his doctrine of the ten mysteries (Ch.\nshi xuan) of the dharma-realm of dependent arising.\nEach mystery is meant to reveal some aspect of the Avatamsaka\nSutra’s vision of reality. These aspects do not quite\ncorrespond with Dushun’s ten claims about the “total\npervasion and accommodation” of each shi with all\nothers (in his third discernment). But subsequent contributors to the\nHuayan School understand Zhiyan’s mysteries as an effort to\nelaborate upon these claims.  \nZhiyan intends for the ten mysteries to apply to ten categories of\ndharmas. He presents each category as a pairing among\ncontraries: doctrine and meaning, li and shi,\nunderstanding and practice, cause and result, person and\ndharma, realms and stages, teacher and disciple, chief and\nattendants, substance and function, response and stimulus. But there\nis no apparent pattern or system to the order in which Zhiyan presents\nthe ten mysteries, nor does Zhiyan explain how each category applies\nto each mystery.  \nFor the sake of illustration, consider each mystery as it pertains to\nthe category of shi. (1) Each shi simultaneously\ncauses, and results from, all other shi. (2) Each relates to\nall other shi in a manner that might be described as\n“fractal”: reflecting all others, being reflected by those\nothers, reflecting those reflections, being reflected in reflections\nof those reflections, and so on ad infinitum, akin to a jewel\nof Indra’s net. (3) The arising of each shi is\nsimultaneous with its cessation, and each shi’s\nrevealing itself to nirvanic awareness coincides with the\nconcealment of its dependence upon other shi. (4) Each is\nendowed with the qualities of all others and so, for example,\nmanifests as simultaneously the smallest particle of dust and the\ngreat Mount Sumeru. (5) Each shi, appearing in a single\ninstant of thought, is simultaneously past, present, and future; and\neach of these times has its own past, present, and future. (6) Each\nshi is simultaneously pure, insofar as it is identical with\nall other shi, and mixed, insofar as it contains all other\nshi within itself. (7) Each shi simultaneously\nincludes, and is included within, all other shi, yet without\nlosing its distinctness from those others. (8) Each is identical with\nall others, in the sense that each determines the identity and power\nof all others—and has its identity and power determined by those\nothers—without losing its distinctness. (9) Each shi is\nnothing more than a creation of mind. (10) Each shi reveals the round teaching of the Avatamsaka Sutra and\nfosters understanding of the nature of ultimate reality.  \nMany of Zhiyan’s mysteries have a paradoxical flavor, presenting\nshi with apparently contrary characteristics. But Zhiyan\nfinds mystery rather than contradiction. His insight seems to involve\na sort of aspectualism, whereby contrary characteristics are ascribed\nto different aspects of one and the same shi, and where\nopposition among these aspects is a matter of perspectival limitation\nrather than inherent contradiction. This perspectival aspectualism\nsupports, as a corollary, Zhiyan’s doctrine of the six\ncharacteristics. According to this doctrine, each shi creates\nall others while retaining its particularity, includes all others\nwithin itself while retaining its difference from them, and integrates\nothers into a whole without cooperating with those others to do so.\nBut Zhiyan provides little by way of explanation for these\ncharacteristics. Nor does he provide explanatory detail for locating\nthe full diversity of experience in a common foundational source of\nmind. These tasks fall to his successors.  \nFazang is Zhiyan’s most accomplished and influential student,\nand became the third patriarch of Huayan. He is responsible for\nsystematizing and extending Zhiyan’s teaching, and for securing\nthe prominence of Huayan-style Buddhism at the imperial court. He is\nknown especially for his definitive commentaries on the Avatamsaka\nSutra and Awakening of Faith in Mahayana, and for making\nHuayan doctrines accessible to laity with familiar technologies such\nas mirror halls and wood-block printing. These contributions support\nthe traditional regard for Fazang as the third patriarch of the Huayan\nSchool. \nFazang’s ancestors came from Sogdiana (a center for trade along\nthe Silk Road, located in what is now parts of Uzbekistan and\nTajikestan), but he was born in the Tang dynasty capital of\nChang’an (now Xi’an), where his family had become\nculturally Chinese. Fazang was a fervently religious adolescent.\nFollowing a then-popular custom that took self-immolation as a sign of\nreligious devotion, Fazang burned his fingers before a stupa at the\nage of 16. After becoming a monk, he assisted Xuanzang—famous\nfor his pilgrimage to India—in translating Buddhist works from\nSanskrit into Chinese. Fazang had doctrinal differences with Xuanzang,\nthough, so he later became a disciple of Zhiyan, probably around 663\nCE.  \nZhiyan’s access to the imperial court gave Fazang access to\nEmpress Wu, with whom he quickly gained favor. He undertook a variety\nof public services, such as performing rain-prayer rituals and\ncollaborating in various translation projects. He traveled throughout\nnorthern China, teaching the Avatamsaka Sutra and debating\nDaoists. He intervened in a 697 military confrontation with the\nKhitans, gaining further favor when Empress Wu ascribed to his ritual\nservices an instrumental role in suppressing the rebellion. In\naddition, Fazang provided information to undermine plots by some of\nthe empress’ advisors to secure power after her death. This\nsecured Fazang’s status—and the prominence of Huayan\nteachings—with subsequent rulers.  \nThe tenth and final chapter of Treatise on the Five Teachings of\nHuayan (Ch. Huayan Wujiao Zhang; T45.1866, trans. Cook\n1970) contains many of Fazang’s most distinctive and important\ndoctrines. In the first section, Fazang develops his theory of the\nthree natures. The original theory was developed in Yogacara Buddhism,\nand posits three “realities”: first, that there is nothing\nbut ineffable, inexpressible reality that resembles space, gold, and\nwater in its absolute natural purity; second, that this reality\nappears as an unreal imaginative construction; and third, that this\nunreal construction is the basis for error, which arises through\nconfusing the construction for reality.  \nIn his \n Three Natures Treatise,\n the Yogacara philosopher\nVasubandhu names the natures for each of these three\n“realities.” He says that inexpressible and ineffable\nreality has the nature of “consummation” (or perfection):\nthis reality is perfect, and its nature is nothing other than\nemptiness. He says that unreal imaginative constructions, appearances\nappearing as nothing other than appearances, have the nature of\n“other-dependence,” which is synonymous with dependent\narising (pratitya-samutpada). He says, finally, that\nconfusions about unreal imaginative constructions have the nature of\n“fabrication” (or imagination, or discrimination).  \nThe Madhyamaka tradition eventually endorsed a version of the three\nnature theory, albeit with some significant differences from the\nYogacara version. According to the Yogacara theory, while the\nfabricated nature is empty, the other-dependent and consummate natures\nare real. The imaginative constructions associated with the\nother-dependent nature—the karmic seeds in the repository\nconsciousness—must have some aspect that is real, according to\nYogacarins, lest there be nowhere for them to await their future\nactualization; and the ineffable reality associated with the\nconsummate nature also must have some aspect that is real, for the\nsake of avoiding the error of annihilationism. Madhyamakins reject the\nYogacarin reasoning as fallacious, preferring an epistemological\nrather than an ontological interpretation of the three natures. The\nchallenge with the epistemological interpretation, however, is making\nsense of how (delusional) appearances are possible in the absence of\nanything real.  \nFazang’s strategy for resolving this debate involves adapting\nthe perspective-taking tactic of the Awakening of Faith in\nMahayana to the three nature theory, ascribing two aspects to\neach nature. According to Fazang’s theory, one of the two\naspects associated with each nature is fundamental, the other is\nderivative. The fundamental aspects are, respectively: pure and\nunchanging, lacking self-nature (svabhava), and non-existence\nfrom the standpoint of reality—that is, being nothing more than\nconvention. The derivative aspects are: confluence to conditions,\napparent existence as thoroughly interdependent, and common-sense\nexistence (which involves a capacity to appear as if possessed of\nself-nature).  \nYogacarins and Madhyamkins both endorse the derivative aspect for each\nnature. So Fazang’s technique for justifying his theory is\ntwofold: first, argue that the fundamental aspects associated with\nthe three natures are compatible with each other; second, argue that\neach nature has its fundamental aspect if and only if it has its\nderivative aspect. Since everyone accepts that the derivative\naspects are legitimate and correct, it should then follow that the\nfundamental aspects are legitimate and correct as well.\nFazang’s view thereby aims to include everything that is correct\nin the Yogacarin and Madyamakin views, while avoiding objections that\neach of those more limited views lodges against the other.  \nFazang’s three-nature theory foregrounds the other-dependent\nnature of reality—how reality appears when conceptualized by\nthose lacking delusion and ignorance. This introduces the possibility\nof developing a metaphysical theory about reality as it appears to\nthose who are enlightened. Fazang endorses two complementary analyses\nof this reality. One analysis focuses on dharmas insofar as they are\nresults, investigating the nondual relationality of One Mind (as\ncause) and the entirety of dharmas (as result). The other\nanalysis focuses on dharmas insofar as they are causes,\ninvestigating the mutual inclusion and identity among each individual\ndharma and all remaining dharmas.  \nIn his Commentary on Awakening of Faith in Mahayana (Ch.\nDasheng qixin lun yiji; T44.1846, trans. Vorenkamp 2004a),\nFazang identifies One Mind with tathagatagarbha.\nTathagatagarbha, as Fazang understands it, is neither an\nindividual consciousness nor something that stands apart from or\nopposed to matter. It is, instead, the one and only source of all that\nexists, creating and sustaining the dharma-realm of dependent\narising—albeit without separation from that realm. One Mind, for\nFazang, is reality prior to any individual consciousness and prior to\nthe objects of consciousness (whether mental or material). This\npriority is ontological, tracking the order with respect to which\nreality is structured into more or less fundamental components.  \nFazang posits that One Mind has two aspects, Suchness Mind and Samsara\nMind. Suchness Mind is free from discerning cognition, neither\nproduced nor destroyed. It witnesses that which is neither\n“this” nor “that” and yet is also not empty.\nSamsara Mind, by contrast, arises and ceases in accordance with\nconditions, transforming into purity and impurity.  \nFazang explains the relation between these two aspects of One Mind by\npositing a distinction between Suchness and Ignorance. Suchness is the\ntrue nature of reality. Fazang posits that Suchness has two aspects,\none unchanging, the other accompanying change. Suchness as unchanging\nis calm and quiescent. Suchness as accompanying change, by contrast,\nis dynamic, embedded within the ebb and flow of conditioned\ndharmas. Because Suchness is available for encounter only to\nwitnessing consciousness that lacks a sense of self, Fazang\ncharacterizes it as empty. Ignorance, by contrast, is that which\ninitiates dukkha. Fazang posits that it, too, has two\naspects. As empty, Ignorance renders its results illusory. As actively\nfunctioning and completing affairs, it perfumes conditioned\ndharmas with hindrances and defilements. Because it is\nresponsible for the appearance of illusory objects, Fazang\ncharacterizes this aspect as existing.  \nSuchness and Ignorance, on Fazang’s account, are the two\nfundamental aspects of One Mind. The aspects of Suchness as unchanging\nand Ignorance as empty correspond to Suchness Mind. This\ncorrespondence positions Suchness Mind as the witnessing of\nunconditioned dharmas. Similarly, the aspects of Suchness as\naccompanying change and Ignorance as actively functioning correspond\nto Samsara Mind. This correspondence positions Samsara Mind as the\nwitnessing of conditioned dharmas. (Fazang provides an\nelaborate analysis of Samsara Mind, inspired by the \n Yijing\n[Classic of Changes]. The gist of his analysis explains that,\nbecause Suchness is present to Samsara Mind, right practice for the\ncessation of dukkha involves attending to the Suchness aspect\nof conditioned dharmas rather than causing those\ndharmas to cease.)  \nIn the third section of the tenth chapter of Treatise on the Five\nTeachings of Huayan, Fazang offers eight theses on\ndharmas as dependently-arisen causes. Four theses concern\ndharmas with respect to their different substance\n(dharmas as they relate to all other dharmas): each\ndharma includes all others, is included within all others,\ndetermines the identity of all others, and has its identity determined\nby all others. The remaining four concern dharmas with\nrespect to their same substance (dharmas as they relate to\nthe totality of the dharma-realm of dependent arising): each\ndharma includes the totality of dharmas, is included\nwithin the totality, determines the identity of the totality, and has\nits identity determined by the totality.  \nFazang’s theses involve two salient posits. The first is that\nevery dharma simultaneously has the aspects of existing and\nbeing empty. As existing, each dharma appears as an\nindividual that is (numerically) distinct from others. As empty, each\ndharma lacks any sort of self-nature that would render it\ninvulnerable to others. Fazang’s second posit is that every\ndharma also simultaneously has the aspects of having power\nand lacking power. As powerful, each dharma affects others in\nways beyond their control and despite their resistance. As powerless,\neach dharma is vulnerable to others, affected by them in ways\nbeyond its own control and despite its resistance. Fazang uses these\nposits to argue that insofar as one dharma exists or has\npower, the others are empty and lack power; and that insofar as one\ndharma is empty or lacking power, the others exist and have\npower. His theses about mutual inclusion and identity follow as\ncorollaries.  \nFazang offers several metaphors to elucidate his claims about mutual\ninclusion and identity, such as the metaphor of Indra’s net and\nthe metaphor of counting ten coins. The most developed metaphor occurs\nin the fourth and final section of the tenth chapter of Treatise\non the Five Teachings of Huayan, where Fazang uses a metaphor of\na framed building to explain six characteristics of dharmas\nas dependently-arisen causes (Fazang 2014b). Fazang labels the six\ncharacteristics as wholeness, particularity, identity, difference,\nintegration, and disintegration. Each of these pertains to some\ncharacteristic an individual dharma has as a part of some\nintegrated whole, akin to the relation a rafter bears to a building.\nFazang’s explanations are notoriously dense. Roughly speaking,\nit seems that a dharma has wholeness insofar as it creates\nsome whole; particularity insofar as it is numerically distinct from\nthat whole; identity insofar as it includes all other parts of the\nwhole; difference insofar as it is numerically distinct from those\nothers; integration insofar as its creating the whole does not\ninterfere with every other dharma of the whole doing the\nsame; and disintegration insofar as its creative success does not\ndepend upon the cooperation of other dharmas in the whole.\n \nThe first nine chapters of Fazang’s Treatise on the Five\nTeachings of Huayan provide, in effect, an encyclopedic argument\nfor a panjiao system that positions Fazang’s views as\nsurpassing the limitations of all prior Buddhist traditions, but\nFazang provides no convenient summary. With some minor exceptions, the\nbasic outline follows Zhiyan’s panjiao.  \nThe first teaching in Fazang’s panjiao—the one he\nranks as conveying the least truth, as being the most limited in its\nskillful means—is what he calls Hinayana (and what we now call\nAbhidharma). Fazang offers three criticisms of this teaching. First,\nhe claims that the Abhidharmic analysis of consciousness is\nincomplete, because it does not provide a thorough analysis of\nrepository consciousness (alayavijnana)—that occurs\nonly with the Yogacara branch of the Mahayana tradition. Second, he\nclaims that the Abhidharmic analysis of dharmas is\nincomplete, because no school within the tradition manages to\nestablish a list of dharmas that contains all the\ndharmas contained by all other lists, and because the\ntradition cannot seem to resolve disagreements on the status of\ncertain putative dharmas. Third, and most importantly, he\nclaims that the Abhidharmic tradition remains committed to the error\nof Eternalism by virtue of denying that dharmas are empty.\n \nThe second teaching in Fazang’s panjiao is what he\ncalls Elementary Teaching of the Mahayana. These are the teachings of\nMadhyamaka and Yogacara, represented by figures such as Nagarjuna and\nVasubandhu in India, and by Jizang and Xuanzang in China. Fazang ranks\nthis teaching as superior to the first because it teaches that\neverything, dharma or not, is empty, and because the Yogacara\ntradition provides a thorough analysis of repository consciousness.\nBut, according to Fazang, the Yogacarin analysis of consciousness is\nerroneous because it mistakes the repository consciousness for some\nsort of ultimate reality. The repository consciousness, according to\nYogacara tradition, contains impurities and defilements. Yet ultimate\nreality, as Fazang understands it, is free of such imperfections.  \nThe third teaching in Fazang’s panjiao is what he calls\nthe Final Teaching of the Mahayana. Fazang has in mind teachings\nassociated with tathagatagarbha theory, as present in texts\nsuch as Awakening of Faith in Mahayana. According to Fazang,\nthe Final Teaching improves upon the Elementary Teaching by virtue of\ncorrectly understanding ultimate reality as pure and\nundefiled—not as repository consciousness, but as\ntathagatagarbha. The Final Teaching also transcends the\nlimitations of the prior two teachings—each of which focuses on\none of the pair “existence” and “emptiness” to\nthe exclusion of the other—by treating ultimate reality as\nhaving two aspects: an aspect of existing, and an aspect of being\nempty.  \nThere is a latent tension within tathagatagarbha theory, as\nFazang understands it. This is the tension between conceptualizing\nultimate reality as tathagatagarbha and conceptualizing\ntathagatagarbha as ineffable. This is why Fazang ranks the\nFinal Teaching of the Mahayana as inferior to a fourth teaching, which\nhe calls the Sudden Teaching. This is the teaching of Vimalakirti,\nfrom the Vimalakirti Sutra, who, in responding to a request\nto characterize ultimate reality, answers with silence. This is\nsuperior to the Final Teaching of Mahayana, according to Fazang,\nbecause the only way to succeed at conceptualizing the ultimate nature\nof reality is to refuse to conceptualize in the first place.  \nThe fifth and final teaching in Fazang’s\npanjiao—the pinnacle of Buddhist teaching, in his\nview—is what he calls the Round Teaching. Here Fazang refers to\nhis own teaching, which he positions as developing the\nteachings of his master, Zhiyan, and which he locates in fetal form\namong the writings of Dushun and amidst the many verses of the\nAvatamsaka Sutra. While the first teaching in Fazang’s\npanjiao focuses on the fabricated nature of reality, and\nwhile the three intermediate teachings focus on the consummate nature\nof reality, Fazang claims that only the Round Teaching accommodates\nall three natures of reality. For, according to the Round Teaching,\neverything is empty, and so the teaching correctly understands the\n“fabricated” nature of what seems to be not-empty; but the\nconsummate nature of ultimate reality is ineffable, and so the\nteaching manages to avoid the limitations of the Elementary and Final\nTeachings of Mahayana. Since, in Fazang’s view, only the Round\nTeaching understands the other-dependent nature of ultimate\nreality—a nature ignored by other Buddhist traditions—he\nconcludes that the Round Teaching, as expressed by his metaphysics, is\nsuperior to all other Buddhist teachings.  \nLi Tongxuan is a contemporary of Fazang’s who remained\nrelatively unknown during his lifetime, and so he lacks the honor of\nbeing considered one of the patriarchs of Huayan Buddhism. However,\nLi’s work came to exert substantial influence upon subsequent\nBuddhist tradition, through its impact on the Korean monk Chinul\n(1158–1210), the Japanese monk Moye (1173–1232), and the Linji Chan\nmasters Juefan Huihong (1071–1128) and Dahui Zonggao (1089–1163). We\nknow little about Li’s life. He lived as a reclusive lay exegete\nof Buddhism, leading an austere lifestyle involving a daily meal of\nonly seven rice cakes made with dates and cypress. He also seems to\nhave had extensive knowledge of the Book of Changes (Ch.\nYijing), presumably due to his being an offspring of the Tang\nroyal family. Li influenced the Huayan tradition through a handful of\nwritings: a commentary on the Avatamsaka Sutra (Ch. Xin\nhuayan jing lun; T36.1739), a summary of that commentary, and a\nchapter-by-chapter summary of the Avatamsaka Sutra itself.\nHis writings are notable for using the theory of yin-yang and\nthe Five Phases, as well as appealing to correlative reasoning, to\ndiscern soteriological significance in minor details such as\ngeographical directions, numbers, and the names of bodhisattvas.  \nLi’s central contribution to Huayan tradition is his teaching of\nthe one true dharma-realm (Ch. yi zhen fajie).\nAccording to this teaching, all places and objects in the world are\ntrue just as they are. There is no real ontological separation between\nthe sacred and the secular, enlightenment and ignorance, or the Buddha\nand sentient beings. Li’s teaching of the one true\ndharma-realm supports a subitist approach to enlightenment,\nwhereby sentient beings attain Buddhahood suddenly rather than\ngradually. It supports, as well, his decision to explicate Buddhist\nideas using classical Chinese texts, as manifested in his frequent\nappeal to the Book of Changes in his commentary on the\nAvatamsaka Sutra. According to Li, Chinese sages such as\nKongzi (Confucius) and Laozi (the traditional founder of Daoism), and\nChinese classics, offer instructions from bodhisattvas by virtue of\ntheir endeavoring to edify sentient beings—and because,\naccording to Li’s teaching, the ordinary human condition is the\nfoundation for enlightenment in this lifetime.  \nLi justifies his teaching of the one true dharma-realm with a\ndistinctive and non-temporal approach to existence. According to Li,\nexistence is not only subject to change but also entirely complete at\neach moment. Past, present, and future co-exist at every moment. This\nnon-temporality of existence resolves several problems Li identifies\nwith the notions of cause and effect. The first problem pertains to\nconceptual relation. If cause and effect are not simultaneous (arising\nat one and the same moment), Li argues, then because causes are not\nconsidered causes until their effects arise, effects precede their\ncauses. If, by contrast, cause and effect are simultaneous, causes\nbecome causes exactly when effects arise. The second problem pertains\nto temporal relation. If cause and effect are not simultaneous, Li\nargues, there is an inexplicable gap between the time at which a cause\narises and the time at which the effect of that cause arises. If, by\ncontrast, cause and effect are simultaneous, there is no such gap.\n \nIf past, present, and future intermingle, then insofar as sentient\nbeings who are now ignorant subsequently gain enlightenment, there is\nno ontological difference between being a sentient being and being a\nBuddha: sentient beings are simultaneously Buddhas. Li here diverges\nfrom Fazang’s more canonical Huayan teaching, whereby ignorance\nand enlightenment are different ontological aspects of the same one\nreality. On Li’s account, the difference between sentient beings\nand Buddhas, and between ignorance and enlightenment, is merely\nepistemological, a matter of confusion about the nature and conditions\nof dukkha.  \nLi finds scriptural support for his non-temporal approach to\nexistence, and his associated teaching of the one true\ndharma-realm, in two tales. The first, the tale of the dragon\ngirl, occurs in the Lotus Sutra, where the dragon girl\nattains enlightenment in a single moment. The second, the tale of\nSudhana, occurs in the Avatamsaka Sutra, where Sudhana\nattains enlightenment in a single lifetime. Li interprets both tales\nas examples illustrating that the moment in which the mind arises to\npractice the Buddhist path is the same as the moment in which one\nattains perfect enlightenment. Insofar as practice is the cause of the\neffect that is enlightenment, it follows that cause and effect are\nsimultaneous—and so all times coexist in one moment. (For Li,\nthe tale of the dragon girl is less perfect than the tale of Sudhana,\nbecause the dragon girl, unlike Sudhana, changes her body and\ngeographical location upon attaining enlightenment.)  \nChengguan’s life was marked by continual encounter with\ndifference. He lived through the reigns of nine Tang emperors, and his\nstudies ranged widely—including Buddhist doctrines and\nmeditation practices, classic works indigenous to China, as well as\nthe Indian Vedas and works on Indian science. Tradition\nidentifies Chengguan as the fourth patriarch of the Huayan School,\nbecause he studied under Fashen (718–778), who was a student of\nFazang’s student Huiyuan (673–743).  \nChengguan was a voluminous writer. He authored a commentary (with an\naccompanying subcommentary) on the Avatamsaka Sutra that\ndisplaced Fazang’s with respect to authority and influence, as\nwell as an influential commentary on Dushun’s Discernments\nof the Dharmadhatu (Ch. Huayan fajie xuan jing;\nT45.1883, trans. Cleary 1983, 71–124). He gave frequent lectures to\nimperial officials, and he wrote many essays at their request.\nChengguan’s writings are notable for quoting frequently from\nChinese classics, borrowing words but not meanings for the sake of\nmaking his teaching accessible to educated literati. This style is\nlikely a response to the weakened political status of Buddhism\nfollowing the An Lushan rebellion (755–763), which increased Chinese\nsuspicions of foreign traditions such as Buddhism and thereby\nheightened a need to show how Buddhist teachings harmonize with native\nChinese traditions.  \nChengguan’s most distinctive contribution to Huayan tradition is\nhis theory of the fourfold dharma-realm. This theory\nidentifies four ways of encountering the dharma-realm of\ndependent arising. Chengguan calls the first the dharma-realm\nof shi. Shi, for Chengguan, refers to form, mind,\nand other characteristics. Chengguan characterizes this realm as\nconditioned, akin to an illusion by virtue of lacking true substance\nand nature, and containing unreal characteristics. It is the\ndharma-realm encountered as particularized into innumerably\nmany distinct individuals. Chengguan calls the second\ndharma-realm the dharma-realm of li.\nChengguan understands li to refer to substance, nature,\nemptiness, quiescence, the immutable nature of all dharmas.\nHe characterizes this realm as identical with true nature. It is the\ndharma-realm encountered as originally pure and free from\ndefilement.  \nChengguan groups the remaining two dharma-realms together as\ndharma-realms of non-obstruction. The third, the\ndharma-realm of non-obstruction among shi and\nli, correlates with the second discernment from\nDushun’s Discernments of the Dharmadhatu. The fourth,\nthe dharma-realm of non-obstruction among shi and\nshi, correlates with the third discernment from\nDushun’s Discernments of the Dharmadhatu. Chengguan\nendorses Dushun’s analysis of these realms. He adds, to\nDushun’s insights, the claim that the non-obstruction of\nli and shi is the foundation for the non-obstruction\namong shi. His meaning is twofold. From a practical\nperspective, he means that meditative insight into li is a\nprerequisite for meditative insight into shi. From a\ntheoretical perspective, he means that shi are mutually\nidentical and inclusive by virtue of their common penetration by\nli: since each shi is identical with and includes\nli, and since li is identical with and includes all\nshi, each shi is identical with and includes all\nother shi.  \nChengguan further develops Huayan tradition by subsuming Chan\nteachings under the perfect teaching of Huayan. Huiyuan,\nFazang’s disciple, had criticized Fazang’s\npanjiao for including the Sudden Teaching. His criticism was\ntwofold. First, the Sudden Teaching does not belong, because\nFazang’s panjiao ranks teachings with respect to their\ncontent but the sudden teaching—as inexpressible—lacks\ncontent. Second, if one ranks teachings with respect to how well they\nexpress truth about ultimate reality, then the Sudden Teaching, by\nvirtue of teaching the inexpressibility of ultimate truth, is distinct\nfrom neither the Final Teaching of Mahayana nor the Round Teaching.\n \nChengguan presents Huiyuan’s panjiao as an artifact of\nhis impoverished understanding of Chan meditation practice. In\nresponse, and in an effort to defend Fazang’s panjiao,\nChengguan develops his own panjiao. He identifies the Sudden\nTeaching with the teachings of various Chan traditions. These\nteachings, as Chengguan understands them, use words to express the\nidentity of mind and Buddha; and the direct mind-to-mind transmission\nof this truth suffices to distinguish Chan from other Buddhist\ntraditions—with respect to practice if not content.  \nDespite Chengguan’s unfavorable evaluations of Huiyuan’s\nteachings, Chengguan followed Huiyuan in explicitly criticizing\nindigenous Chinese teachings of the ru (Confucians) and the\nDaoists. He identifies the cardinal teaching of the ru\ntradition as the five constant virtues—benevolence,\nrighteousness, propriety, wisdom, sincerity; the cardinal teaching of\nDaoism as spontaneity (Ch. ziran); and the cardinal teaching\nof Buddhism as causality (Ch. yinyuan). Chengguan’s\ncriticisms center upon the claim that non-Buddhist teachings endorse a\nkind of pseudo-causality that abnegates responsibility for actions and\ndenigrates the role of wisdom. Against the Yijing (associated\nwith Confucians), he argues that locating the source of the myriad\nthings in the transformations of yin and yang\nascribes responsibility for wisdom or stupidity to the impersonal\nworkings of heaven, thereby denying the role of consciousness in\ncreating reality. He develops a similar criticism against the\nDaodejing, which locates the source of the myriad things in\nDao and denigrates practices of cultivation as superfluous. Against\nthe Zhuangzi, finally, he argues that the emphasis upon\nspontaneity as fundamental means that enlightenment arises without\ncause rather than through careful practice, and that this is erroneous\nby virtue of ignoring the way ignorance and enlightenment depend upon\nprior conditions.  \nTradition identifies Zongmi as the fifth patriarch of Huayan. Zongmi\nspent his early years studying Confucian classics and Buddhism before\ntraining with the Chan (Zen) master Suizhou Daoyuan (750–820). Then,\nfollowing a brief period of studying the Avatamsaka Sutra\nwith Chengguan, Zongmi began an extensive period of writing. His\nefforts focused, at first, on gathering commentaries on various sutras\nand writing his own. In time, he focused on compiling Chan texts to\ncreate a canon for the Chan tradition. These efforts resulted in his\nachieving status as a patriarch for the Heze school of Chan. Although\nZongmi’s Collected Writings on the Source of Chan (Ch.\nChanyuan zhuquanji) is no longer extant, its preface,\nProlegomena to the Collected Writings on the Source of Chan\n(Ch. Chanyuan zhuquanji duxu; T48.2015, trans. Broughton\n2004), survives.  \nZongmi’s major philosophical work is Inquiry into the Origin\nof Humanity (Ch. Yuanren lun; T45.1886, trans. Gregory\n1995). The title of this book might be a play on Inquiry into the\nOrigin of the Way, an influential anti-Buddhist essay by the\nConfucian philosopher Han Yu (768–824). Zongmi’s book offers, in\neffect, an innovative panjiao system. The central innovation\nis its inclusion of Daoism and Confucianism. Zongmi’s discussion\nof the strengths and weaknesses of each view are detailed, and here we\npresent only some of his arguments.  \nZongmi states that \n Kongzi and \n Laozi are both great sages, and that\ntheir ethical teachings are extremely beneficial to the common people.\nHowever, Confucians and Daoists claim that humans, animals, and\ninanimate objects all come into existence from the same underlying\n“vital force” (Ch. qi, roughly similar to the\n“boundless” of Anaximander). Zongmi argues that this\ncreates an insoluble problem. Since vital force is originally without\nconsciousness, then since we receive this force in the same way\ngrasses and trees do, either we should lack consciousness or else\ngrasses and trees should be conscious. In addition, Confucians and\nDaoists believe that fate is governed by Heaven (Ch. tian, an\nimpersonal higher power), which acts in accordance with the moral Way.\nZongmi argues that they cannot explain why a moral Heaven allows the\nvirtuous to suffer and the vicious to flourish. Since some who lack\nvirtue flourish, while others with virtue suffer, the distribution of\nrewards and punishments is unjust.  \nZongmi argues that Buddhists can resolve both dilemmas. Regarding the\nproblem of evil, Zongmi appeals to the Buddhist doctrine of\nreincarnation to explain how the distribution of rewards and\npunishments in the universe is ultimately just. According to this\ndoctrine, the distribution of rewards and punishments is determined\nnot only by one’s actions in one’s current life but also\nby one’s actions in previous lives. So the flourishing of the\nvicious, and the suffering of the virtuous, is attributable to karma\nfrom their past lives.  \nAccording to Zongmi, the only plausible solution to the problem of\nconsciousness is that fundamental reality is mental, and\nnon-consciousness is the result of a kind of self-deception, where the\nmind fails to realize its objects as manifestations of itself. \nCompetition for power, prestige, and wealth led to sectarian conflicts\namong Buddhists, Daoists, and Confucians. In addition, some aspects of\ninstitutional Buddhism were socially problematic, including the vast\namounts of tax-exempt wealth controlled by monasteries and extreme\nreligious practices such as self-immolation and self-mutilation, which\nwere endorsed even by leading figures like Zhiyan and Fazang.\nEventually, Daoists encouraged the Tang Emperor Wuzong to launch the\nGreat Anti-Buddhist Persecution (Ch. huichang huifo) of\n842–846. During this period, Buddhist monks and nuns were forcibly\ndefrocked, temples and shrines were destroyed, and their property\nseized. Although the persecution only lasted until the emperor’s\ndeath and was reversed by the next emperor, Buddhism never fully\nrecovered from the damage to its social influence and intellectual\nprestige.  \nFollowing the decline of Buddhism, the movement known in the West as\n“Neo-Confucianism” became increasingly influential.\n Neo-Confucianism\n presents itself as a revival of the original\nteachings of Confucianism against the mistaken doctrines of Daoism and\nBuddhism. However, after centuries of Buddhist dominance in\nphilosophy, it was almost inevitable that Neo-Confucian thinkers would\nunconsciously reinterpret their tradition in the light of Buddhist\nconcepts. For example, we saw how the Chinese term li\n(principle/pattern) is central to Huayan metaphysics. It is also\ncentral to \n Neo-Confucian metaphysics,\n even though the term is of\nperipheral importance in the Confucian classics. For example, of the\nFour Books of the Confucian canon, “li”\noccurs precisely zero times in all of the Analects of\nConfucius and the Great Learning, only twice in the\nMean, and a mere seven times in the Mengzi. In none\nof the passages where it does occur is there any suggestion that the\nterm has any deep metaphysical importance. (A typical use is in a\ndialogue in which someone asks Mengzi for help with his lack of\neloquence, describing himself as “not patterned (li) in\nregard to my mouth.”) Nonetheless, Neo-Confucian philosophers\nlike \n Zhu Xi\n  (1130–1200) repeatedly use the term to explain what they\ntake to be the underlying meaning of the classics, and give it a\nmetaphysical meaning very reminiscent of Indra’s net. Similarly,\nthe Neo-Confucian emphasis on the dangers of “selfish\ndesires” (Ch. siyu) and “selfish thoughts”\n(Ch. siyi) is not characteristic of ancient Confucianism, but\nrather reflects the centrality of selfishness in Buddhist accounts of\nhuman wrongdoing.  \nHuayan Buddhism has largely died out as a distinct religious movement\nin China, Korea, and Japan; however, Huayan texts continue to be\nstudied and have been particularly influential on Chan Buddhism (Jap.\nZen). Huayan has also had a substantial influence on other\nphilosophies. The so-called “New Confucian Manifesto”\nadvocates the “rounded and spiritual wisdom” of the East\nas opposed to the “square” wisdom of the West (see Harris\n(trans.), Part 11, Other Internet Resources). Although they identify\nthe ultimate source of this distinction as the Classic of\nChanges, their description of it is reminiscent of the\n“round” wisdom advocated by\npanjiao theorists. In addition, Mou Zongsan, one of the\nco-authors of the “Manifesto,” wrote extensively and\nsympathetically about Huayan. Among contemporary philosophers, Graham\nPriest (2015) has shown how to formalize the ontology of Huayan using\nnon-standard set theory.
