Collective intentional attitudes\npermeate our everyday lives, for instance when two or more agents look\nafter or raise a child, grieve the loss of a loved one, campaign for a\npolitical party, or cheer for a sports team. They are relevant for\nphilosophers and social scientists because they play crucial roles in\nthe constitution of the social world. In joint attention, the\nworld is experienced as perceptually available for a plurality of\nagents. This establishes a basic sense of common ground on which other\nagents may be encountered as potential cooperators. Shared\nintention enables the participants to act together intentionally,\nin a coordinated and cooperative fashion, and to achieve collective\ngoals. The capacity for shared belief provides us with a common stock\nof knowledge, and thus with a background against which relevant new\ninformation which we may want to share with others becomes salient.\nCollective acceptance is crucial for the development of\nlanguage, and for a whole world of symbols, institutions, and social\nstatus. Collective emotions provide us with a shared\nconception of what matters to us, together, and they establish\nreadiness for joint action. In virtue of capacity for collective\nintentionality, we can (and should) engage in joint reasoning and\ndeliberation, and (re-)organize ourselves to make sure that the way we\nlive together is how we, collectively, want it to be, from our\nsmall-scale communities to global politics.\n\n\nCollective intentional attitudes involve a plurality of participants\nin such a way that the attitudes in question can be ascribed to\nindividuals as a group, or unit. The main philosophical\nchallenge connected with the analysis of collective intentionality is\nin the tension within the expression “individuals as a\ngroup”. It can be spelled out as a contradiction between the\nfollowing two widely accepted claims (the Central Problem): \n\nCollective intentionality is no simple summation, aggregate, or\ndistributive pattern of individual intentionality (the Irreducibility\nClaim);\n\n Collective intentionality is had by the participating\nindividuals, and all the intentionality an individual has is their own\n(the Individual Ownership Claim). \n\nOver the last couple of decades, a number of theories of collective\nintentionality have been proposed, pointing towards different ways to\nsolve this tension.\n\nSuppose you intend to visit the Taj Mahal tomorrow, and I intend to\nvisit the Taj Mahal tomorrow. This does not not make it the case that\nwe intend to visit the Taj Mahal together. If I know about your plan,\nI may express (or refer to) our intention in the form “we intend\nto visit the Taj Mahal tomorrow”. But this does not imply\nanything collective about our intentions. Even if knowledge about our\nplan is common, mutual, or open between us, my intention and your\nintention may still be purely individual. For us to intend to visit\nthe Taj Mahal together is something different. \nDistributions (summations, aggregates) of individual intentions do not\nmake for collective intentions, even if combined with common\nknowledge, or mutual belief. This is accepted by an increasing number\nof contributors to the recent debate. Collectively intentional\nattitudes are not just sets of run-of-the-mill individual intentional\nattitudes combined with common knowledge or mutual belief. Another way\nof putting this is to say that collective intentionality is\nirreducible to individual intentionality (though this is\ngenerally accepted only insofar as individual intentionality is\nnarrowly understood). It is only in virtue of its irreducibility that\nthe intentional state in question can be attributed to the\nparticipants as a group. \nWhat does it mean for us to intend as a group? Surely, if we\nintend to visit the Tay Mahal together, it is you and me who intend\nthe shared activity, not some third subject over and above our heads,\nthe group. That we intend as a group does not displace you\nand me as the intenders of the action in question. To say that the\ngroup intends to go for a walk is the same as saying that the\nparticipating individuals intend to go for a walk— if\n“together” is added to the latter clause (and where\nexactly it has to be inserted is a crucial philosophical question).\nCollective intentions can be attributed to individuals, but only\ncollectively, it seems, and not distributively. The view that the\nintentional attitudes in question are the participant\nindividuals’ collectively rather than distributively, however,\nis in tension with the view that even if an individual participates in\ncollective intentionality, all the intentional attitudes that\nindividuals has are their own (the Individual Ownership Thesis). \nOn the naturalist version of the Individual Ownership Thesis, any\n(primary) intentional state is a higher order feature of a brain. It\nis not the case that in collective intentionality, individual brains\nare integrated in a Borg-like manner to form a collective super-brain.\nTherefore, it seems that collective intentionality reduces to an\naggregate, or combination, of individual brain states. According to an\ninternalist version, all the intentionality an individual has is\nstructurally independent of the existence or non-existence of anything\noutside the individual mind. The question of whether or not an\nindividual’s intentional states are collective is therefore\nsettled by internal features of individual minds. A third version,\nthat might seem attractive to non-naturalists and externalists,\nemphasizes that intentional states are, or involve, commitments. It\nseems, however, that only an individual agent’s own intentional\nstates can commit them to a particular course of action, or to\ninferences. Other individuals’ intentional states may provide an\nagent with a reason only on the base of what they themselves believe\nor desire. Thus, it seems that the commitments involved in collective\nintentional states are the individual commitments of each of the\nparticipants. \nIn all of these and related versions of the Individual Ownership\nThesis, the basic claim is that each individual has a mind of their\nown, and has a sort of intentional autonomy that is incompatible with\nthe view that individual minds are somehow fused when intentional\nstates are shared. Thus, the Individual Ownership Thesis places tight\nrestrictions on non-reductivism about collective intentionality. Most\nparticipants in the current debate accept a version of the\nIrreducibility Claim, and a version of the Individual Ownership\nThesis, and they set out to show how these could be modified in such a\nway as to be mutually compatible. \nThe label “collective intentionality” is fairly recent (in\nits current meaning, it was introduced by John Searle in his 1990\npaper “Collective Intentions and Actions”). In contrast to\nthe label, the concept is not new. The idea of collective\nintentionality is implied in such notions as Aristotle’s concept\nof koinonía (common striving), Jean-Jacque\nRousseau’s collective will (volonté\ngénérale), or in notions such as the spirit\nof peoples and related concepts as developed in German Idealism\nor the Historical School of Law. Somewhat more explicit conceptions of\ncollective intentionality can be found in early social and\nsociological theory\n (2.1),\n Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy\n (2.2),\n and in the works of Robin G. Collingwood and Wilfrid Sellars\n (2.3).\n These largely independent sources focus on key issues in the analysis\nof collective intentionality that persist through history into the\npresent. \nEmile Durkheim (1898) and Max Weber (1922) have developed conceptions\nof collective intentionality under other labels, and they have come to\nquite different and indeed opposite views. \nDurkheim claims that social facts have to be accounted for in terms of\ncollective consciousness rather than individual attitudes.\nHis (1898) example of people who are involved in a mass emotion, of\nwhich they cannot make sense in terms of their own personal views and\nfeelings, is often quoted as an illustration. Indeed, Durkheim’s\nview is sometimes even argued to be the direct historical root of the\ncurrent debate on collective intentionality (Olen/Turner 2015).\nDurkheim’s remarks on the role of collective consciousness\nsuggest a view of the collective “taking over control” and\nbypassing individual intentional psychology in the explanation of\naction (though Durkheim’s views can also be reconstructed along\nless collectivist lines; see Turner 1986). Durkheim’s work is\none of the historical sources for the analysis of collective emotions\n(von Scheve and Salmela 2014). \nWeber, by contrast, is famous for assigning the decisive role in the\nexplanation of social facts to the intentional attitudes of\nindividuals. He claims that many social situations are situations of\nstrategic interdependence between individual decisions. In such\nsituations, fully rational agents choose their preferred course of\naction on the basis of what they cognitively expect other agents to\ndo. However, Weber is well aware of the fact that where dependence of\neach participant’s choice on his or her expectation concerning\nthe other’s behavior is out in the open, the situation becomes\nunstable. In addressing this issue, Weber discusses the case in which\npeople act on the assumption of being in agreement with other\nagents, which then enables them to have normative\nexpectations concerning each other’s behavior. This is a\ndecisive step beyond what has later become known as rational choice\ntheory. Such agents do not choose according to what they think to be\nbest given what they think others are likely to do; rather, they rely\non others to do what they ought to do. This need not, Weber\nclaims, be a matter of explicit agreement, but may be grounded in a\nsense of the agent’s shared aims (and thus, we would now say, in\ncollective intentionality). However, such action orientation appears\nas not fully rational in Weber’s conception (Weber 1922).\nWeber’s conception thus foreshadows the neglect of collective\nintentions and actions in later rational choice and game theory.  \n(Quasi-)Durkheim’s and Weber’s conceptions mark the Scylla\nand the Charybdis of the debate. The Scylla is a straightforward\nanti-reductivism about collective intentionality that comes at the\ncost of a flat-out rejection of individual intentional autonomy. The\nCharybdis is a reductionist attempt that denies collective\nintentionality for rational social agents. \nSubstantive and concise philosophical analyses of collective\nintentionality can be found in early Phenomenology and Existential\nPhilosophy. These contributions have attracted increasing attention in\nrecent years (Salice & Schmid 2016; Moran & Szanto 2016).\nAmong the many relevant contributions and contributors (including\nEdmund Husserl, Edith Stein, and Jean-Paul Sartre), two stand out as\nparticularly important: Gerda Walther (1923), and Max Scheler (1954\n[1912]). The paradigm case in their (implicit) controversy is shared\nexperience. \nWalther claims that for A and B to share the experience\nof x, i) A has to experience x, and B has\nto experience x, ii) A has to empathize with\nB’s experience and vice versa, iii) A has to\nidentify with B’s experience and vice versa, and iv)\nthere has to be mutual empathetic awareness of the other’s\nidentification (Walther 1923: 85f.). Walther offers substantive\nanalyses of empathetic experience and identification, but the question\nremains why the reciprocal intentional attitudes required from the\nparticipants in shared experience stops at level three (current\naccounts that follow similar lines usually require full common\nknowledge). How could there be a shared experience between A\nand B if A is unaware of the fact that B\nis empathetically aware of A’s identification with\nB’s experience, or some such? It seems easy to develop a\nscenario in which Walther’s conditions are met, but in which\nthere is no shared experience for lack of awareness of what the other\ntakes to be the case. If collective intentionality is analyzed in\nterms of a combination of individual intentionality and mutual\nrecognition of some sorts, it seems that an infinite progress of\nreciprocal attitudes is set off. \nScheler’s most important contribution to the analysis of\ncollective intentionality is largely negative. Joint intentionality is\nnot, Scheler holds, a combination of individual intentionality with a\nstructure of reciprocal awareness, whatever the structure and kind of\nthe reciprocal awareness in question may be. From his analysis emerges\nthe view that when people share an attitude, it is not the case that\neach participant has an attitude of his or her own, but that the\nintentional attitude at stake here is really one and the same, so that\nmany minds are in a numerically identical state. The most\nconspicuous examples Scheler discusses are the experience of grief\nwhich parents, without thinking of each other, share at the deathbed\nof their child (Scheler 1954 [1912]: 145), and the chillingly positive\naccount of the shared national enthusiasm (the August Madness) at the\noutbreak of World War One (Scheler 1982 [1914]: 272ff.). Without\nmentioning his source, Martin Heidegger follows roughly Schelerian\nlines in his discussion of more innocent examples in (1996 [1928/29]).\nThe idea is that collective intentionality is not a combination of\nindividual intentionality and reciprocal attitudes, but irreducibly\ncollective (for a recent re-statement of this point see Searle 1995:\n27). A problem of irreducibility-claims of this sort, however, is that\nit is hard to believe that the participants in a collective\nintentional attitude do not represent, in some way, each other, even\nif they need not have occurrent beliefs or conscious empathetic\nexperience. A participant’s intention represents the others as\nco-intenders in some way, or so it seems (Searle seems to concede this\npoint in Searle 2010: 15). An important question to consider is\nwhether the relation between the co-intenders is of the cognitive,\nnormative, or rather of the affective kind. Tuomela & Miller\n(1988) and Michael Bratman (1999) argue that the participants have to\nknow what the others are up to, Alonso (2009) argues that\nthey just have to rely on them, while Gilbert (1990) claims\nthat they have to normatively expect others to do their\nparts. Schmid (2013) argues that the attitude in question is\ntrust, and that this combines cognitive and normative\ncomponents. The question of how participants in collective\nintentionality “represent” each other becomes particularly\npressing if it is assumed that basic cases of shared intentionality\nare developed at an age where infants do not have a theory of mind,\nsuch as in Michael Tomasello’s (2009) view. \nWhereas the mainstream of present debate about collective\nintentionality probably has no direct roots in early social theory or\nphenomenology, Wilfrid Sellars’ concept of we-intention is\nwidely acknowledged as the point of departure (Tuomela & Miller\n1988). We-intentions play a crucial role in Sellars’ practical\nphilosophy. As we-attitudes, normative judgments can both express\npeople’s attitudes, and have a claim to intersubjective\nvalidity. The concept of a we-intention thus bridges emotivism and\nintuitionism (Sellars 1974). We-intentions are attitudes, but at the\nsame time, they are not merely private, but involve a shared point of\nview from which the participants may critically assess each\nother’s contributions. \nSellars argues that even though we-intentions are not private, they do\nnot involve a group mind. His view is that we-intentions are had by\nindividuals, but that they differ from individual intentions in their\nform. According to the taxonomy developed below, his is a mode-account\nof collective intentionality. Sellars’ conception of\nwe-intention can be traced back to Robin G. Collingwood’s\nNew Leviathan (1947), where Collingwood defines society as\n \nthe sharing of certain persons in a practical social consciousness\nverbally expressed in a formula like ‘We will go for this\nwalk’ or ‘We will sail this boat’. (Collingwood\n1947: 146)  \nIn a chapter by the title “Society as joint will”,\nCollingwood argues that there is nothing mysterious about practical\nsocial consciousness (148). All the individual participant needs to\nhave is a however vague general idea of the enterprise as a whole, and\na special idea of the part in it allotted to himself. In addition, the\nparticipant must know that there are other agents who are partners\nwith him- or herself in this common endeavor, without having to know\nwho exactly they are. As “social consciousness,”\nsociety \nis nothing over and above its members. It has no will but the will of\nits members; no activity but the activity of its members; no\nresponsibility but the responsibility of its members. (149ff.). \nSellars’ interests differ from Collingwood’s, but his\nanalysis closely follows Collingwood’s lines. Sellars agrees\nwith Collingwood that the attitude in question requires no group mind\ncapable of belief or intention over and above the heads of the\nparticipating individuals (Sellars 1968: 203). On this account, all\nintentionality involved in group intention and group action is had\nby individuals, but it is conceived as intentionality of a\nspecial sort, which Sellars calls “action we-referential\nintention”, or, in short, “we-intention”. It is thus\nindividuals, and not a group, that intend a joint action\n(Sellars 1980: 98). This, however, leads Sellars to one of the deepest\nproblems in the analysis of collective practical intentionality. One\ncannot intend what one takes to be entirely beyond one’s\nabilities, or beyond one’s control (Sellars calls this the\n“‘up to the agent’ness” [Sellars 1980: 98] of\nintention). Objects of intention are taken, by the agent, to be\n“up to her”, to some degree at least. How, then, can\nindividuals have we-intentions? It seems plausible to assume that the\nbehavior of each individual, insofar as it is an action, is up to that\nindividual him- or herself. An individual who has an\naction-we-referential intention, however, does not only intend his or\nher own behavior, but also the behavior of the other participants, and\nthis behavior is not up to him- or herself, but up to others. Thus\nwe-intention seems to be incompatible with the ‘up to the\nagent’-ness of intention. \nIn the current debate, this problem is sometimes bypassed by shifting\nfrom action-referential to propositional intentions. Michael Bratman\nanalyzes shared intentions in terms of “intention,\nthat” rather than “intention to”\n(in a closely related vein, Raimo Tuomela distinguishes action\nintentions from aim intentions in parts of his work; e.g., Tuomela\n2007: 84f.). To intend that the door be closed is different\nfrom intending to close the door in that in the former case,\nthe subject having that intention may differ from the subject of the\nintended action. Thus the problem with we-referential intentions seems\nto disappear as soon as intention is conceived of in propositional\nrather than in action-referential terms. Sellars is fully aware of the\npossibility of that move:  \nIt is important to see that I can not only intend to do something\nmyself, I can also intend that someone else do something, i.e., that\nit be the case that he does it. (Sellars 1968: 184)  \nYet Sellars sees clearly that this apparent escape route is really a\ndead end, and again, he follows Collingwood, who argued that\nconsciousness, insofar it is practical, is not a matter of\n“making up your mind that”, but a matter of\n“making up your mind to” (Collingwood 1947: 139).\nTalk of “intention that something be the case”,\nSellars argues, may be grammatically correct, but it is understandable\nas talk of practical commitments only in virtue of its\nrelation to “intention to”. When spelled out, the\nintention that p is really the intention to make it the case\nthat p (Sellars 1968: 184). Thus a person’s intention\nthat “we” do x, or that somebody else does\nx, is a practical commitment only as an action-referential\nintention (intention to): one intends to do whatever is\nnecessary to make it the case that we do x, or that somebody\nelse does x. This yields a solution to the problem (which\nSellars later calls “superficial”). A person may simply\nassume that it is up to her what other people do because she takes\nherself to have an influence on these other people (Sellars\n1968: 188). \nThat we can influence people is as relevant to practical reasoning as\nthat we can influence sticks or stones. (Sellars 1980: 88) \nAn agent who intends to bring her influence on others to bear in such\na way as to make it the case that others do what is necessary for the\nintended state to obtain, however, does not have a proper\nwe-intention. The reason is that such intentionality does not go\nbeyond an egocentric perspective; it involves an extension of the\nrange of one’s own intentionality into other people’s\nagency rather than any sense of sharing. Remember that Sellars\ndevelops the idea of we-intention with an eye on making the intuition\nthat normative judgments express intentional attitudes compatible with\nthe view that they involve a claim to intersubjective validity. Just\nthat I intend to influence other people to behave in a certain way, or\nto form certain intentions, does not make my attitude intersubjective\nin such a way as to provide a stance for mutual critical\nassessment. \nIn On Reasoning about Values (1980), Sellars offers\nan alternative solution to the ‘up to the agent’ness\nproblem of we-intention: it involves \nthe fact […] that to say that the intendible constituents of an\nintention are those which are present sub specie ‘up to\nme’ is equivalent to accompanying them with the conditional\n‘if it is up to me’. […] Now ‘up to me’\nis the first person form of ‘up to X’. […]\nThus the correct answer to the above challenge consists in calling\nattention to the fact that the ‘up to the agent’ness of\naction we-referential intention is to be formulated as follows:\n‘Shall [each of us, if it is up to them, do\nA]’ And this in no way requires that what others\ndo be up to me. (1980: 98)  \nThus Sellars’ view is that when individuals we-intend to do\nsomething together, each one has his or her own we-intention.\n“[T]he intendings are two in number, but the\ncontent of these intendings is the same”\n(1968: 217). \nIn Sellars’ view, we-intentions are intentions had by\nindividuals; we-intending individuals have their own\nintention, and the action intended by a we-intending agent is limited\nto what the agent takes to be up to him- or herself. This means that\nthe existence of we-intention does not imply that an intention is\nactually shared, an idea that resembles Searle’s claim\nthat collective intentionality can be had by envatted brains (1990:\n406). This raises the question of what has to be the case for a\nwe-intending individual actually to intend together with\nothers. One person’s we-intention does not make for a collective\nintention. Other we-intending individuals need to be around. But is it\nenough for an intention to be joint that other individuals happen to\nbe around who have a we-intention with the exact same content? If one\nbrain in a vat cannot we-intend alone, can two, if not\ntogether? How do the we-intentions of individual participants\nhave to be related to each other in order to constitute a\ngenuine collective intention? Sellars’ analysis may not provide\na conclusive answer, but he presents at least two further insights\nthat seem highly relevant to the current debate. \nFirst, Sellars emphasizes the difference between two types of\nI-referential intentions. Primary I-referential intentions\nare different from we-derivative I-referential intentions in\nthat the content of the latter are contributions to joint actions. A\ngreat many intentions are we-derivative in that sense. My intention to\nmove a pawn on the chessboard is derivative from our intention to play\na game of chess. \nSecond, Sellars leaves ample room for what could be called\nintentional dissidence. Many current analyses assume that for\nus to intend x, each of us has to intend to do his or her\nshare. Sellars is keenly aware that this may not always be the case.\nIntentions may be ascribed to groups, as shared, without assuming that\neach participant intends to do his or her share. Yet Sellars\nacknowledges that the less of our collective intentions and beliefs an\nindividual shares, the more difficult it becomes to see him or her as\n“one of us” (Sellars 1968: 203). We-intentions are a\nmatter of a “shared point of view” that involves\nidentification with a group (Sellars 1980: 101). The question of\nwhether or not group identification needs to be in the individual\nparticipants’ self-interest remains open. Whether or not a\nsituation of choice is looked at in terms of one’s\n“private” or “shared” point of view depends on\nwhom one takes oneself to be: a solitary individual or a group member.\nSellars’ aim is not to provide a theory of identity selection.\nHis claim is that the moral point of view requires us to\nabandon the egocentric perspective, and to conceive of ourselves as\n“one of us”. The “we” at play here has to be\nunderstood in the least parochial sense. Only such we-intentionality\nactually serves the purpose for which Sellars devised the term\n“we-intention”; only the we-intentions that are\nuniversally shared, and no parochial group attitudes, constitute the\nmoral point of view. \nA common starting point of the theory of intentionality can be\nrendered as follows: (1) intentionality is taken to be a feature of\nminds, (2) minds are to be conceived as individual minds (or minds of\nindividuals), and (3) each individual has his or her own\nmind. We call this third statement, which is most relevant to the\ntopic at hand, the Individual Ownership Thesis. But how can\nintentional attitudes be shared in more than a merely\ndistributive sense? Or how can what we call the Irreducibility Claim\nbe true? In meeting the challenge of making irreducibility compatible\nwith individual ownership, a lot depends on where exactly the\ncollectivity is placed in the analysis of collective\nintentionality. \nIntentionality is commonly divided into three constitutive features.\nFirst, intentionality has content. The content of an\nintentional attitude is whatever the attitude in question is\nabout (e.g., the content of the intention to visit the Taj\nMahal is to visit the Taj Mahal). Second, intentionality has\na mode. The mode is what distinguishes a case of fear from a\ncase of intention, or a belief from a desire. Basic modes are the\nmodes of conative or practical intentional attitudes (such as\nintentions or desires), cognitive or theoretical intentional attitudes\n(such as beliefs or perceptions), and affective or emotional attitudes\n(such as hopes and fears). And third, intentionality has a\nsubject, that is, an entity whose intentionality it is, and\nto whom it can be ascribed as its source or bearer. \nWhereas there is a widely shared consensus among the participants in\nthe debate that there is no straightforward reduction of collective\nintentional attitudes to a set of individual intentional attitudes,\nthe question of what exactly is collective about collective\nintentionality is highly controversial. Each of the three components\nof intentional attitudes has been quoted as the seat or locus of the\nsharedness or collectivity in question. Some authors claim that\ncollective intentionality is intentionality with a collective\ncontent, others seem to invoke a special mode, while\nstill others claim that what’s collective about collective\nintentionality has to be the subject. Content-accounts claim that for\nA and B’s intention to visit the Taj Mahal\ntomorrow to be collective, each A and B have to intend\nto visit the Taj Mahal together. Mode-accounts insist that\nthe element of collectivity has to extend to the intending; in their\nview, A and B have to intend collectively to\nvisit the Taj Mahal (together). Subject-accounts hold that the element\nof togetherness is really in the subject; in their view, A and\nB have to form a plural subject or a unified group that is the\nsubject of—and has—the intention to visit the Taj\nMahal. \nThe paradigm of collective intentionality in the recent debate is\njoint intention (collective practical intentionality).\nAnalyses of joint intention will thus serve as a common reference\npoint in the following discussion of content-, mode-, and\nsubject-accounts of collective intentionality. \nWhat do the agents A and B have to intend for their\nintention to go for a walk to be collective? A first approach consists\nin saying that the relevant intentions of A and B do not\nrefer to their own individual walks, but to their joint walk. Instead\nof each intending to go for a walk, A and B would each\nintend the joint walk. This move is crucial to Michael Bratman’s\napproach to the analysis of what he terms ‘shared cooperative\nactivity’ (cf. Bratman 1999, chaps. 5–8, 2006, and 2014).\nIt is based on the view that action intentions do not just come in the\nform “I intend to X,” as when an agent\nintends to perform some action. On Bratman’s account, intentions\ncan also take the form “I intend that we\nJ” (cf. Bratman 1999, chap. 8), where J refers to\na joint activity in which the intending agent participates. This\nrepresents the participating agents as not just intending their\nrespective contributions, but as intending the joint activity; in the\ncase at hand, A and B are said to intend that they go\nfor a walk together. Although the focus at this point should be on\nthat core element, it is expedient to cite one version of the entire\nanalysis. \nWe intend to J if and only if \nThis gives the structure of what Bratman calls a “shared\nintention,” which he takes to be an intention to J shared\nby the participants. It is depicted as consisting in a complex nexus\nof interdependent individual attitudes and not as the intention of a\ncollective agent or as a state of some collective mind (cf. Bratman\n1999: 122–3). For there to be a joint activity, Bratman holds,\nthe participating agents have to intend this activity in such a way\nthat their so intending is aligned both socially and with other plans\n(or subplans) on each side and that it is common knowledge between\nthem. \nThus, the claim here is that intentions of the form “I intend\nthat we X” are basic to the intentionality of joint\naction. Critics have argued that Bratman’s account is defective\nin so far as it treats intentions of that form as basic, since they\nviolate either (1) the condition that one can only intend one’s\nown action, or (2) the condition that one can only control one’s\nown and no other agent’s actions, or (3) the condition that one\ncan only intend what one can take to be in a position to settle (see\nBaier 1997; Stoutland 1997; Velleman 1997). Bratman clarifies in reply\n(in Bratman 1999, chap. 8) that intentions of the form “I intend\nthat we X” are formed under the assumption that the\npartner in a shared activity does or will come to intend likewise.\nInstead of positing that in order to form such an intention an agent\nhas to be certain about their partner’s intentions, Bratman\ncontends that an agent is typically in a position to reliably predict\nwhether the other will come to form a corresponding intention. Given\nthat both agents form their intentions in this manner, whereby a\nshared intention comes into existence, they can both regard themselves\nas having partly settled the issue in question. On this account,\nneither of the agents controls for the other’s intention\nformation or action as their intentions are each understood as\npartially constitutive of the shared intention. \nAnother charge against Bratman’s and other accounts that ground\nan understanding of collective intentionality in individual\nagents’ intentions is that such intentions are circular (cf. the\ndiscussion of Tuomela 2005 below). The idea behind this criticism is\nthat such intentions presuppose rather than constitute collective\nintentionality (cf. Schmid 2005; Petersson 2007). For how can an\nindividual refer to a joint activity without the jointness, i.e., the\n‘we,’ already being in place? How can an agent assume that\nothers will intend likewise without presupposing the collectivity of\ntheir so intending? Instead of being foundational for shared\nintentions or collective intentionality, such intentions might turn\nout to be redundant expressions of an already existing collective\nintentionality. \nA reply available within Bratman’s account may refer to a\npresupposition of the formation of a shared intention. According to\nBratman (1999, chap. 5), shared agency requires that the individual\nagents involved be mutually responsive, i.e., that each seeks to be\nresponsive to the other’s intentions and actions and that each\nseeks to guide their own behavior with an eye to the behavior of the\nother. It is in this sense, and the phrase “in accordance with\nand because of” in the scheme given above signals this, that the\nways the agents involved form their respective intentions can be said\nto interconnect. Hence the idea behind this reply would be to ground\nthe intentional reference to the joint activity in mutual\nresponsiveness. (Bratman 2014, chapter 2, offers more reflections of\nthe charge of circularity; cf. Petersson 2015 for discussion.) \nIt is not clear whether this response can successfully deal with the\ncharge of circularity. Whereas it may be that in some scenarios the\nagents involved actually realize that they want to cooperate so that\ntheir processes of intention formation interconnect and they come to\nhave intentions as Bratman specifies them, the problem of circularity\nmay just crop up again with respect to the required interconnection.\nIt could be that instantiating interconnected processes of intention\nformation just presupposes the collectivity it is meant to\nconstitute. \nThe merits of Bratman’s approach clearly lie in its highlighting\nthat whatever joint intentions are, they do involve interrelated\nintentional attitudes on the part of the individual agents involved.\nHowever, many critics think that treating reference to the joint\nactivity as central and at the same time retaining the\n‘I’-form of the constitutive individual intentions makes\nfor a fundamental problem of circularity. \nBefore turning to a different type of account in which this particular\nproblem of circularity is (at least apparently) circumvented, it\nshould be noted that Bratman’s adherence to the\n‘I’-form of intentions is expressive of the individualism\nunderlying his approach. Already in the first statement of his account\nhe points out that it is “reductive in spirit” (Bratman\n1999: 108) and clarifies that the core “claim […] is that\nshared intention consists primarily of attitudes of individuals and\ntheir interrelations” (1999: 129). Even though Bratman has\nspecified the dimensions of the interrelations between the attitudes\nof the individual agents involved (cf. Bratman 2006), some critics\nhave taken issue with the claim that the attitudes constitutive of\nshared intentions have to stand in the singular, i.e., the\n‘I’-form (cf. Baier 1997; Stoutland 1997; Schmid 2009;\nSchweikard 2011). This line of criticism pertains to the picture thus\ndrawn of shared intention as a social phenomenon that is constructed\nout of I-form-attitudes as building blocks, a picture that understates\nthe relevance both of relations between the individuals involved and\nof the role of social identification expressed by the use of\n‘we.’ \nOther contributors to the analysis of collective intentional states\nclaim that the collectivity resides not just in the content of the\nintentionality but also in a specifically collective mode or we-mode.\nIf individuals share an intention, it is not just the case that they\neach intend a joint action; rather, they intend the joint action\ncollectively. \nThis shift of focus is best grasped by noticing two main elements:\nfirst, mode accounts include the claim that the attitudes that\nconstitute shared or joint attitudes are to be verbalized using the\nplural pronoun “we,” as in “we intend to go to the\nTaj Mahal” or “we believe that the Taj Mahal is in\nIndia.” Second, (some) mode accounts emphasize that such\nattitudes are not just verbalized in a certain way, but are expressive\nof the particular and fundamental sociality of their bearers. Raimo\nTuomela (2007, 2013) suggests distinguishing between (different\nstrengths of) I-mode and we-mode, picking out different ways of having\nintentional attitudes, where having an attitude in the I-mode means\nhaving it ‘as a private person’ and having it in the\nwe-mode means having it ‘as a group member’ (cf. Tuomela\n2007: 46). \nThe distinctions between attitudes verbalized in the singular form and\nattitudes verbalized in the plural form, and between I-mode and\nwe-mode, are not to be conflated with the distinction between modes of\nintentionality introduced above. Instead, the idea underlying mode\naccounts is to spell out a distinction that can be applied to\npractical (or conative), to cognitive, and to affective intentional\nstates, yielding a conceptual framework for analyzing the entire\nspectrum of collective intentional states. The idea is that the\nparticipating agents have attitudes of a special kind or\nform. \nA direct and explicit predecessor of mode accounts is Wilfrid Sellars,\nto whom, as was noted above, Tuomela and Miller refer as a source of\ntheir original account of we-intentions (cf. Tuomela & Miller\n1988). Focusing on cases of joint action and the respective\nintentional states, they analyze an individual agent’s\nwe-intention regarding a joint activity as consisting of (1) the\nintention to do her part, (2) a belief that others will to their\nparts, and (3) a belief that there is (or will be) mutual belief among\nthe agents involved that the relevant opportunities for performing the\njoint activity obtain (cf. Tuomela & Miller 1988: 375; see also\nTuomela 1991: 252; Tuomela 2005: 340–41) \nIn conceiving of we-intention as a special kind of intention had by an\nindividual agent, the analysis is true to Sellars’ understanding\nof we-intentions (cf.\n section 2.3\n above). As Tuomela and Miller put it, an individual agent can be said\nto ‘we-intend’ the joint action X if she has a\nrespective individual intention regarding her contribution and certain\nbeliefs about the actions and beliefs of the other agents involved.\nSuch a we-intention is not in itself an action intention on a par with\nthe participatory intention of a single agent, it is an ‘aim\nintention’ directed at the joint action (cf. Tuomela 2005;\n329–30). By contrast to content accounts, this account posits\nthat the intentionality of joint action consists in a particular form\nof intending instantiated by the individual agents involved. If the\nmembers of a group perform a joint action together, then this is in\nvirtue of each of them having a we-intention of the form given here;\ne.g., their joint action of going to the Taj Mahal is performed in\nvirtue of each having the we-intention to go to the Taj Mahal. \nIn his first contribution to this debate, John Searle criticized\nTuomela’s and Miller’s account as typical “in that\nit attempts to reduce collective intentions to individual intentions\nplus beliefs” (Searle 1990: 404; cf. Searle 2010: 46). In\nparticular, Searle rejects the idea of reducing\n‘we’-attitudes to ‘I’-attitudes. But he does\nnot understand the reverse claim, according to which collective\nintentionality is irreducible or “primitive” (Searle 1990:\n404), as having an impact on the internalist claim that all\nintentionality “has to exist inside individuals’\nheads” (Searle 2010: 44; cf. Searle 1990: 406). From\nSearle’s perspective, Tuomela and Miller are right in not\npositing the existence of a form of intentionality that somehow\ntranscends individuals’ minds, but they go wrong in claiming\nthat we-intentions can be reduced to I-intentions plus beliefs. Such a\nreduction fails, Searle holds, because thinking and conceiving of a\njoint action in the “we”-form is the core characteristic\nof cooperation. When A and B go to the Taj Mahal\ntogether, Searle’s account has it that each of them has the\nthought “We are going to the Taj Mahal” in his head; and\nthis is what makes theirs a joint action, since each derives his\ncontributory or participatory intention from his collective intention,\nassuming that the respective other will perform his contribution (cf.\nSearle 2010: 52–53). \nSearle’s account of the structure of collective intentionality\nhas been criticized precisely with respect to the combination of the\nclaim that the ‘we’ is irreducible with the claim that all\nintentionality resides in individual minds. Some critics have noted\nthat Searle embraces a solipsistic and individualistic methodology\n(see Searle 1990: 415 and Searle 2010: 47) that makes it impossible to\naccount for the intersubjective or interpersonal relations that\ncharacterize joint activities and social communities (see e.g.,\nMeijers 1994, 2003; Schmid 2003, 2009; Zaibert 2003). Such relations\nare explicitly bracketed out in Searle’s account. But it seems\nplausible to hold that successful coordination of efforts in pursuit\nof shared goals requires that the relations between the agents\ninvolved and the attitudes of the respective others figure in the\nintentional structure of this social process. For a complex event to\nbe not just a coincidentally matching pattern of actions by individual\nagents but an intentional joint action, it needs a complex structure\nof attitudes in which the agents involved refer to one another. The\nonly reference to a collectivity Searle incorporates into his account,\nthe plural indexical ‘we,’ is taken to be primitive and\naccessible to a solipsistic analysis (cf. Searle 1990: 415). Although\nthis insistence on the we-form of the intentionality allows\nclassifying Searle’s conception as a mode-account, its\nelaboration does not look convincing. His conception renders\ncollective intentionality distributive in the sense that the\ndistinctive mark of the phenomena in question is claimed not to be\ninstantiated by individuals together, by individuals-in-relations, by\nplural subjects or groups, but to the full by each of the individuals\ninvolved. \nThe description of this strand of the debate sidesteps the fact that\nit is not entirely clear whether the point of Tuomela’s and\nMiller’s analysis of we-intention is to provide a reductive\naccount of collective intentionality. In fact, Tuomela has repeatedly\nrejected this interpretation of the analysis (see, for instance\nTuomela 1995, chap. 9; Tuomela 2005: 342). He clarified that his\nanalysis of we-intention, which remained essentially unchanged\nthroughout subsequent work of his, “is rather meant to elucidate\nthe irreducible notion of we-intention in a functionally informative\nway” (Tuomela 2005: 358) and grounded in an “ontically\nindividualistic or, better, interrelational” framework (2005:\n342). This suggests reading the analysis not as reductive but as\nexplicative in the sense that it explicates the complex structure of\nattitudes that constitutes an individual agent’s we-intending.\nThis again provides the core element of Tuomela’s conception of\nthe intentionality that guides joint action, i.e., the analysis of\nwhat he calls ‘joint intention:’ \n(JI) Agents A1, …,\nAi, …, Am\nhave the joint intention to perform a joint action X\nif and only if \nIn the case of joint intention the conatively used ‘We will do\nX’ is true of each participant\nAi. (Tuomela 2005: 342) \nThis scheme not only makes explicit that on Tuomela’s account\neach participant in a joint action is viewed as having a we-intention\nin the sense specified above, it also highlights important\nsimilarities between this conception and Bratman’s conception of\n‘shared intentions.’ However, as signaled by the\nrespective choice of terminology, Tuomela thinks of the intentional\nstructure of collective action as consisting in individual attitudes\njoined together, whereas Bratman conceives of it as being\nshared among the participants. According to both accounts it\nis a core element of collective intentionality that each of the\nindividual agents involved refers to the others’ intentions and\nbeliefs regarding the joint activity. However, even if it is granted\nthat the crucial difference between these accounts regards the mode of\nthe constitutive attitudes, it needs to be seen whether the charge of\ncircularity discussed above also affects Tuomela’s account of\nwe-intentions (cf. Miller 2001 and Schmid 2005). \nThe charge of circularity targets the element of Tuomela’s (and\nMiller’s) analysis of we-intentions according to which the\nwe-intending individual agent refers to her part of the joint action\nX and has beliefs regarding others’ contributions and\nbeliefs. If the agent is to intend to do her part of X and if\nshe is to be able to refer to others’ contributions and beliefs,\nso the objection goes, then the collectivity that is meant to be\nconstituted by we-intentions has to be presupposed. Tuomela’s\nreply to this objection has the following three elements: first, the\npoint of the analysis is not that collectivity is constituted\nby but that it consists in the participants’\nhaving we-intentions, where this crucially depends on their\nsatisfaction of what Tuomela calls the ‘collectivity\ncondition,’ i.e., the condition that one participant can only\nhave a we-intention if others have an isomorphic we-intention (cf.\nTuomela 2005: 333 and 339). Second, Tuomela takes the analysis of\nwe-intention not to be an instance of vicious circularity (cf. Tuomela\n2005, sec. VI.), since from the pre-analytic perspective of the\nparticipant the performance of the joint action, including an\nallocation of contributions, is presumed and anticipated but not\npresupposed. Third, Tuomela does not view we-intentions and other\nelements of his account as independent building blocks but only as\nanalytically isolatable parts of a complex whole (cf. Tuomela 2007:\n125–6); once again, the guiding idea is not to track the\ncomposition of collectivity from basic and independent elements, but\nto elucidate what collectivity consists in. \nIn his more recent work on collective intentionality, Tuomela has\ngeneralized the idea underlying his analysis of we-intention to a\ndifferentiated conception of the socially shared point of view that\nunderlies social and collective phenomena (see especially Tuomela\n2003, 2007, and 2013; for a critical discussion see Schmitz 2017). At\nthe core of this conception lies a fine-grained distinction between\nvariations of what he calls the ‘I-mode’ and the\n‘we-mode,’ all of which specify ways in which individuals\nhave attitudes relative to a group whose member they are. When an\nindividual reasons or has attitudes in the ‘I-mode,’ she\ndoes function as a group member but her commitments relative to the\nrespective attitudes are private, i.e., they regard her goals\nqua private person. When she reasons or has attitudes in the\n‘we-mode,’ she functions as a group member and conceives\nof herself as being bound by and committed to what is collectively\naccepted and subject of collective commitment within the group.\nSpelling out the details of this conception—especially the\nnotions of collective acceptance (see Tuomela 2002 and 2007, chap. 6)\nand collective commitment as well as the so-called group ethos (see\nTuomela 2007, chap. 1)—would exceed the scope of the present\ndiscussion. But the contours of the approach should have become clear:\naccording to Tuomela, collective intentionality resides in a specific\nmode of having attitudes, and collective phenomena are individuated in\nterms of complex intentional structures that involve such specific\nattitudes. \nA more general criticism of the content accounts and mode accounts of\ncollective intentionality discussed in this and the previous section\naims at the individualist framework within which they are formulated\n(see, e.g., Baier 1997; Stoutland 1997; Meijers 2003). More\nspecifically, some authors have called for overcoming the\nintentional individualism the most prominent approaches to\ncollective intentionality adopt (cf. Schmid 2009 and Schweikard 2011).\nThis move involves leaving behind the view that all attitudes are\n(reducible to) attitudes by individuals, taken in isolation, and are\nto be verbalized in the ‘I’-form; this does away with the\nproblem of circularity. The alternative here is to acknowledge that\nsome attitudes take a genuine ‘we’-form and are rightly\nattributed to individuals standing in certain social relations. The\npoint of such a non-individualist line is not to posit mysterious\nsupra-individual forces or to undercut the intentional autonomy of\nindividual agents, where these are the worries that seem to motivate\nthe individualistic stance. It is, rather, to treat collective\nintentionality as irreducible with respect to its content and mode,\nand relational with respect to the structures that ground\nindividuals’ reference to plural contents and their\nself-conception as subject-in-relations. A non-individualist account,\naccording to which collective intentionality is irreducible and\nrelational, relies on an analysis of the specific relations\nindividuals are in when they share intentional attitudes with one\nanother. One aspect—whose investigation is still in the early\nstages of development—that helps to further illuminate this is\nthe particular nature of the first person plural indexical\n‘we’ (cf. Gilbert 1989; Nunberg 1993; Pettit 2003; de\nBruin 2009; Schweikard 2011; Schmid 2005). \nThe philosophically intriguing issues in the theory of intentionality\nare not confined to its content and mode but include the question as\nto what sort of entity is or can be a subject of intentionality. This\nis obviously another core question in the theory of collective\nintentionality, one where philosophical analysis meets with the\ninterests of social science and normative theorizing. Does it ever\nmake sense to say that a social group is the subject of, or just has,\nan intention, a belief, or an emotion? Or are such attributions of\nintentionality to groups merely metaphorical shorthand for referring\nto the attitudes of their members (Quinton 1975)? \nSome authors have developed qualified affirmative responses to the\nfirst of these questions and claimed that groups can indeed be\nsubjects (or bearers) of intentional states. One apparently\nstraightforward approach consists in applying the ‘intentional\nstance’ to groups, i.e., in making groups’ status as\nintentional subjects dependent on whether their behavior can be\ninterpreted as intentional (cf. Tollefsen 2002a, 2002b, and 2015). For\ninstance, if I see a number of people trying to pull a car out of a\nditch, I may be warranted in ascribing relevant beliefs and desires to\nthe group, as in “the group wants to move the car back onto the\nroad.” Cases like this one are familiar from everyday parlance,\nin which we often encounter attributions of intentional states to\ncorporations or governments. In this respect, interpretationism has\nthe clear advantage of shedding light on the social practice of\nascribing intentionality to groups, but the view needs to integrate an\naccount of the conditions under which such ascriptions are justified.\nIt just does not seem to be all there is to being a collective subject\nof intentionality that a given group can be viewed as such. What is\nneeded to establish that groups can be subjects of intentional states\nis an elaborate account of their internal structure, i.e., of what\nconstitutes them as proper targets for ascriptions of intentionality.\nTollefsen’s interpretationist account here focuses on the\nrational unity certain groups, such as organizations, are capable of\ndisplaying (see Tollefsen 2002a and 2002b, and Rovane 1998). \nOne influential account along these lines is Margaret Gilbert’s\nplural subject theory (Gilbert 1989, 1990, 1996, 2000, 2006, 2009, and\n2014). Gilbert starts from the basic case of two individuals going for\na walk together. On her account, such an activity requires that they\ntake on what she calls a ‘joint commitment,’ which she\nexplains as  \na kind of commitment of the will. In this case, the wills of two or\nmore people create it, and two or more people are committed by it.\n(Gilbert 2006: 134)  \nA joint commitment can, on this account, only be brought about (or\nrescinded) jointly. A joint commitment of this kind does not require a\n“single centre of consciousness” or a “distinctive\nform of ‘subjectivity’” (2006: 134), it is the\ncommitment precisely of those bound by it. According to Gilbert, each\njoint commitment is a joint commitment to do X as a body, where\nsubstitutions for “X” include “intend”,\n“believe”, “accept”, and so on. A joint\ncommitment to believe something as a body, for instance, is a\ncommitment to constitute as far as possible a single body that\nbelieves that thing, where  \nthe concept of a ‘single body’ is neutral with respect to\nthe question whether the body in question is in some sense composed of\nindividual human beings. (2006:137)  \nGilbert takes this not to imply that the individuals involved are (or\nhave to be) personally committed to the attitude in question, e.g.,\nthat each or any of them believes what they are jointly committed to\nbelieving as a body (cf. Gilbert 2009). However, joint commitments\nthus specified imply a normative relationship between the parties\nthereby committed: if A and B are jointly committed in\nsome way, then each of them is obligated to act accordingly and each\nof them is entitled to demand the other’s conforming action; in\nother words, they owe each other such action (cf. Gilbert 2009). \nGilbert uses this basic structure of joint commitment to define the\ntype of social group she calls ‘plural subject’:  \nA and B […] constitute a plural subject\n(by definition) if and only if they are jointly committed to doing\nsomething as a body—in a broad sense of ‘do’.\n(Gilbert 2006: 145)  \nSuch plural subjects, as a particular sort of social group, can be\nsubjects of intentional states such as intentions, beliefs, and\nacceptance; this is the point at which the account regards the subject\nof collective intentionality. \nA number of criticisms can be put forth against Gilbert’s plural\nsubject theory; although they were voiced at earlier stages of the\ndevelopment of the theory, their target has not decisively been moved.\nThe first critical point to note is familiar from the discussions in\nearlier sections of this entry, as it regards a problem of\ncircularity. Does the formation of a joint commitment not already\npresuppose the sort of joint action by plural subject it is meant to\nbring about? It seems to be crucial to the account that when two\nagents say, for instance, ‘Let’s go to the Taj Mahal\ntogether!’, they unite in virtue of the joint commitment this\ninvolves. But why start precisely there? Couldn’t the two also\nsay, at an earlier point in time, ‘Let’s jointly commit to\ngoing to the Taj Mahal together’? There is an apparent danger of\nregress or indeed of circularity. However, this objection may rely on\na superficial reading of Gilbert’s theory. Already in the first\ncomplete statement of her view (in Gilbert 1989), she elaborated that\nthe formation of a plural subject, or the entering of a joint\ncommitment, is preceded by an open display of ‘readiness’\non the part of the individual agents. So before they actually become\njointly committed to do such-and-such ‘as a body,’\nA and B each indicate that they are ready or willing to\ndo so. This reply by extended narrative is weaker than it might look,\nfor either this means that joint commitments are, as it were,\nput together from personal attitudes of the participants or\nthe respective attitudes instantiate the same sort of circularity that\nwas to be avoided. A possible resort consists in saying that the\nagents themselves do not presuppose the complicated technical\nstructure termed ‘joint commitment’ or ‘plural\nsubject,’ which renders the alleged problem of circularity one\nthat exists only for the theorist. \nA related critical point is that the process through which joint\ncommitments are brought about, in Gilbert’s analysis, already\ninvolves some form of collective intentionality. This seems obvious in\nthe case of explicit communication, as any communication is a joint\naction. But it is also true in those cases in which the agreement is\ntacit rather than explicit, as this implies some form of mutual\nunderstanding between the participants. It seems plausible to assume\nthat mutual understanding, even if it is tacit, is collectively\nintentional. If Gilbert’s claim is that all collective\nintentionality is of the form of a joint commitment, her account of\nthe process through which joint commitments are generated seems to\npresuppose another joint commitment. If individuals already have to be\njointly committed in some way in order to enter into a joint\ncommitment, however, either a vicious circle or an infinite regress\nseems to ensue. A possible solution would be to claim that joint\ncommitments of the sort that Gilbert envisages are a special\nkind of collective intention, and that they presuppose more basic\nforms of collective intentionality, which are not joint commitments of\nthe Gilbertian sort (Schmid 2005). \nA third critique regards the normative internal structure of plural\nsubject, i.e., the claims that the parties to a joint commitment\nassume mutual obligations and entitlements and that this is\ncharacteristic of the basic phenomenon of joint action. In his\ndiscussion of Gilbert’s view, Bratman (1999, chap. 7; 2014,\nchap. 5) rejects the claim that mutual obligations and entitlements\nare constitutive features of joint action. He deems it part of the\nnormal etiology of joint activities that the participants create\nmutual expectations and take on obligations to fulfill them (cf. also\nAlonso 2009, who elaborates a similar point using the concept of\n‘reliance’). But Bratman regards these as consequences\nrather than as constituents of such activities. In support of Gilbert\nit should be clarified that she does not speak of the obligations and\nentitlements in question as moral obligations and\nentitlements, but treats them rather as directed obligations\nand as part of the social relationship between the\nparticipants (cf. Gilbert 2006: 155). \nA fourth criticism of Gilbert’s view targets the scalability of\nthe conception of joint commitment and plural subjects. Gilbert\naffirms this at great length and claims that even political\ncommunities (or societies) can be understood along those lines, thus\narguing for a view of which she takes traditional social contract\ntheory to be one version (cf. Gilbert 2006, part II). The merits of\nsuch a contractualist approach need not be discussed in the present\ncontext, but the underlying claim that one can extrapolate from the\nbasic case of joint action runs into difficulties when it is viewed in\ncombination with Gilbert’s claim that joint commitments cannot\nbe rescinded unilaterally, but only jointly by all of the individuals\nwho undertake it (cf. Gilbert 2009: 182). This feature of the account\nmay seem counterintuitive already in cases of rather spontaneous\nsmall-scale joint actions, such as when I meet a colleague on the way\nto the lecture hall and we fall into walking together for a bit. But\nthe larger the scale, the more implausible this implication becomes.\nAre we to accept, by way of reductio, that one member of a\npolitical community can hold all others to a social contract (Baltzer\n2002)? \nAlthough these critical points might affect the overall reception of\nGilbert’s theory, it surely provides insights concerning some\nfeatures a group is likely to exhibit in order to count as a subject\nof collective intentionality. In particular, its members need to\ncreate a structure that turns the group into an unified entity in the\nsense that it is made the subject of attitudes they together accept\nand are committed to act on. This may, as Hindriks (2008a) notes,\nimply that more is needed than the joint commitment that can be\nexplicated in view of phenomena such as spontaneous joint walks. For\ninstance, the formation of an effective citizens’ movement may\nrequire that the individual agents involved accept the goal of the\njoint enterprise and an internal structure in which roles,\ncompetencies and decision-making mechanisms are defined (see also\nFrench 1984). \nRaimo Tuomela gives a more detailed account of the internal structure\nof what he calls ‘we-groups,’ which he takes to come in\ndifferent varieties, depending on the strength of their members’\nendorsement of and identification with the respective group’s\ngoals (Tuomela 2007, 2013). He draws an analogy between single agents\nand collective agents (cf. 2007: 85–86), thus setting the stage\nfor the study of the intentionality specific to group phenomena.\nTuomela acknowledges that the most familiar collective agents,\norganizations and corporations, require a more detailed internal\nstructure that encompasses the relationships between their members,\nrelationships between the members and the respective collective\nagents, and a number of organizational characteristics. In summary,\nthese features comprise members’ collective acceptance\nof and collective commitment to the group’s goals, a\ndistinction between operative and non-operative group\nmembers, the definition of roles and positions\nwithin the group, and the institution (or even codification) of a\ngroup-internal authority system (see also French 1984 for a\nsimilar view of the structure of groups).—It would not pay out\nat this point to reiterate the reflections on Tuomela’s\nindividualism and we-mode analysis mentioned above; instead, we do\nwell to focus on his specification of the status of such groups. \nTuomela explains that his  \naccount entails that a we-mode group […] is a collective\nartefact and indeed an organized institutional entity […].\nGroup members are viewed as functioning in group positions (be they\ndifferentiated or not). Thus, a we-mode group can indeed be said to\nconsist of such positions. (Tuomela 2007: 20)  \nDespite the emphasis he puts on the organizational features of groups,\nthe following statement testifies to the reductionist social ontology\nTuomela adopts: \nWe are here somewhat metaphorically viewing groups as analogous to\nindividual agents (persons). […] In a nutshell, my view is that\ngroups can but need not be taken as (singular) entities, and they are\nagents and persons only in a metaphorical sense. (Tuomela 2007: 140\nand 145)  \nThus, on this account, the aforementioned analogy between single and\ncollective agents is not to be overstated and used to infer that\ncollectives are agents that are (ontologically) on a par with single\nagents. But they may, even on Tuomela’s account, qualify as\nsubjects of intentional states, even as autonomous (cf. Tuomela 2007:\n234), insofar as they consist in a particular organizational structure\nand are upheld by the respective (we-mode-) attitudes of their\nmembers. \nA third influential ‘subject account’ of collective\nintentionality was propounded by Philip Pettit (2001a,b, 2003, 2009).\nThe theory of group agency Pettit has since expounded jointly with\nChristian List (see List & Pettit 2011) is not specifically\ntailored to this issue, or voiced in the respective terminology; the\nreconstruction in the following thus concentrates on a brief account\nof Pettit’s initial statement of his view, as it is (in argument\nand terminology) more explicitly stated within a framework that\noverlaps with other conceptions of collective intentionality. In\ncontrast to other accounts, Pettit’s does not start from an\nanalysis of joint action or collective intentional states, thus\ntreating the issues of joint agency and group agency as\ndistinguishable (cf. Pettit & Schweikard 2006). Instead, he\napproaches the issue of whether groups can be subjects of (or have)\nintentions directly by asking whether they can fulfill general\nconditions of agency. And he claims that not only can groups fulfill\nsuch conditions, but that such groups fulfill them as collective units\nof agency whose attitudes may be discontinuous with the attitudes of\ntheir members (cf. Pettit 2002 and 2003). \nIn the present context, the latest statement and defense of the entire\nargumentation centered on conditions of agency cannot be taken up (see\nPettit 2007a and List & Pettit 2011, chapters 1–3), the\nfocus will instead be on a partial argument regarding one important\nstep in the larger argumentation. It concerns the question whether\ngroups can be subjects of intention. Here it is: \nFirst premise: there is no intention without a minimum of rationality\non the part of the relevant agent. Second premise: collectives can\ndisplay that minimum of rationality only insofar as they collectivise\nreason, as I shall put it. Conclusion: only groups that collectivise\nreason can properly have intentions. (Pettit 2001b: 241)  \nIn short, the argument supports the view that only those groups\nqualify as subjects of intentions that instantiate a specific kind of\nrationality (see also Tollefsen 2002). In the initial defense of this\nview Pettit refers to consistency, closure, and completeness as\nrequirements of rationality (see Pettit 2001b: 243). By this he means\nthat in order to be rational an entity has to maintain only co-tenable\nattitudes, it forms  \nall those beliefs and intentions, and performs those actions, that are\nrationally required by the things it is rightly said to intend\n(ibid.),  \nand it forms attitudes on all matters relevant to what it can rightly\nbe said to intend. Whether these requirements are really weak enough\nto ground only a ‘minimum of rationality’ is not entirely\nclear. \nIn view of this description of the conditions of rationality it would\nnot seem as though fulfilling them required a complex form of social\norganization. A number of agents, one might say, could simply get\ntogether, jointly pursue a certain goal and decide all relevant\nmatters by majority voting; it might need some organizational\nstructure, depending on the size of the group, but the aforementioned\nconditions of rationality should be satisfiable in this way. Pettit\nrejects this view on the basis of observations about schemes of\nmajority voting that were first, under the label “doctrinal\nparadox,” noted in jurisprudence, then generalized under the\nlabel of the “discursive dilemma” and became the starting\npoint for the ‘theory of judgment aggregation’ (cf.\nKornhauser 1992; Pettit 2003; List 2012). The central tenet of these\ndebates is that there is no principled way of securing that\naggregations of consistent sets of votes on interconnected issues are\nthemselves consistent. \nAccording to a main lesson from the discursive dilemma, a group that\nis to count as a subject of intentional states has to implement an\ninternal structure and in particular a mechanism for decision-making.\nIf it is to fulfill the requirements initially given by Pettit, it is\n“forced to collectivize reason” (Pettit 2001a: 110). This\nagain means that it has to ensure that the majority votes, which are\neach treated as the group’s view on the respective question,\nform a consistent set of attitudes, even if that implies reconsidering\npast or constraining future judgments. So the group has to monitor its\nattitudes or it may institute a straw vote procedure, which\nfacilitates joint awareness of and deliberation about the\ngroup’s views (cf. Pettit 2007a). In the case described above,\nthe only satisfactory strategy, Pettit holds, would consist in\ntreating the majority votes regarding p and q as\nauthoritative, embrace the logical implication and affirm\n>p&q< (cf. Pettit 2001b: 247). In this way,\nthe group could meet the requirements of rationality.—This\nconcludes Pettit’s (early) analysis of the conditions under\nwhich groups can count as subjects of intentional states. It targets\nprimarily the processes of group-internal reflection and\ndecision-making. \nTo conclude this section, it bears mentioning that there is an\nimportant but often neglected alternative to studying the\nsubject-aspect of collective intentionality with respect to social\ngroups only. According to this alternative, the subject of\nintentionality does not have to be a ‘rational unity’ of\nagents (cf. Rovane 1998; Tollefsen 2002; Pettit 2003). Instead, a\nconception of collective intentionality can be open to the view that\ntwo or more individuals jointly form the subject of their collective\nintentional attitudes (cf. Smith 2011). At this systematic juncture,\nthe ontological commitment of an account that specifies the nature of\nthe subject of collective intentionality takes center stage. Here\nagain the crucial questions—and the structure is familiar from\nthe discussion of the other two issues of collectivity—are\nwhether what one wants to call the subject of an intentional attitude\nis irreducible, whether reference to such collective subjects is\nmerely metaphorical, or whether this particular kind of subjecthood\ncan be instantiated by two or more agents jointly. \nWhereas the focus of the discussion about collective intentionality is\nmostly within the domain of the philosophy of mind and action, a\nseries of neighboring philosophical disciplines and social sciences\nare highly pertinent to this topic. \nThe interest in the nature of social reality as well as in the\nstructure and normativity of social practices and institutions had\nbeen part of philosophical debates long before the incipience of\nspecific debates about collective intentionality. But by now it seems\nclear that analyses of collective intentionality provide significant\ncontributions to the study of social phenomena, and that they form an\nimportant part of the main projects of social ontology (for an\noverview see Hindriks 2018). \nTake the example of money (see Searle 1995: 1): there is an enormous\npractical difference between a blank piece of paper and a five dollar\nbill, but what does this difference consist in? To this some authors,\nincluding Searle (1995, 2010) and Tuomela (2002), have replied that\nthe existence of money depends at least partly on collective\nintentional attitudes, or on a shared practice of treating certain\npieces of paper, and not others, as money. This mechanism, which\naccording to Searle (2010) involves the imposition of status functions\nand specific deontic structures, generalizes to the way communities\ncreate and maintain social institutions, to public offices,\nconventions and cultural sites (such as the Taj Mahal); collective\nattitudes such as collective acceptance seem to play an ineliminable\nrole in the constitution of such social and institutional facts. The\nprecise structure of collective acceptance, however, is not all that\nclear. While it is meant to play the role of both creating and\nmaintaining institutional facts—it is by way of collective\nacceptance that we say that such-and-such is (or counts as) money and\nit is by way of collective acceptance that we acknowledge of\nsuch-and-such that it is (or counts as) money—, it is not easy\nto see how an attitude, whether collective or not, can fulfill these\ntwo functions with opposing directions-of-fit (see Laitinen 2014). \nRegardless of these details, integrating a conception of collective\nintentionality into the study of collective phenomena, which encompass\ninstitutional phenomena, is promising for the following very\nfundamental reason. The central concern of the theory of\nintentionality is to grasp the unity of, or the interaction\nbetween, the natural and the mental. The central concern of the theory\nof collective intentionality is to grasp the connections and\ninteractions between the mental and the social. And this is how the\ntheory of collective intentionality can be viewed as part of an\nencompassing ontological project. \nOn a more confined terrain, the theory of collective intentionality\nraises and contributes to elaborating on a number of specific issues\nin social ontology. As noted in the previous subsection, the theory of\ngroup agency—including the issue of whether collective entities\ncan count as subjects of intentional states—poses questions\nabout the ontological status of groups and group agents, and it\ninvites reiterations of familiar discussions about reduction,\nsupervenience, constitution, and composition (and more). But the\ntheory of joint action, especially if it is viewed as involving\nquestions about the specific relations between cooperators or\nco-agents, already raises issues regarding the social identity of\npersons. And once intersubjective relations are cast against the\nbackground of joint projects and shared practices, the study of\ncollective intentionality enters a direct exchange with the analysis\nof recognition and recognitive attitudes (cf. Ikäheimo &\nLaitinen (eds.) 2011). \nThe debates about collective responsibility began at least six decades\nago and by now constitute a distinct field of research in moral,\npolitical, and legal philosophy (cf. the entry on collective\nresponsibility). Accounts of collective intentionality, of joint\naction and group agency, can contribute to clarifying the conceptual,\naction-theoretic and ontological foundations of the phenomena in\nquestion (cf. May & Tuomela (eds.) 2007). Indeed, some influential\ncontributions to the study of social phenomena stem from debates about\ncollective responsibility and they proved to be important points of\nreference in discussions about collective intentionality (cf., e.g.,\nCopp 1979, 1980; French 1979, 1984; see also May & Hoffman (eds.)\n1991 and Barzagan-Forward & Tollefsen (eds.) 2020). \nThe closest systematic connection between these two fields regards the\npreconditions of (ascriptions of) responsibility. Assuming, more or\nless uncontroversially, that there is no responsibility without\nagency, intentionality, freedom, or autonomy on the part of the entity\nto whom responsibility is ascribed or who is held accountable, an\naccount of collective responsibility will have to include conceptions\nof collective agency, collective intentionality, collective freedom,\nand/or collective autonomy (see, e.g., Hindriks 2008b, Smiley 2018).\nIn analogy to the now widely accepted differentiations between joint\naction and group agency, one may also ask under what conditions a\nnumber of agents, who do not form or belong to an organized group, can\nbe jointly responsible for an action they performed jointly, for an\nevent they brought about through the joint action, or for events that\noccurred as a consequence of a joint omission (cf. Petersson\n2008). \nAs with the most discussed issues in the theory of collective\nintentionality, there is a fundamental divide between individualist\nand non-individualist (or collectivist) conceptions of collective\nresponsibility (cf. May 1992; Miller & Makela 2005; Miller 2006).\nThe former hold that only individual agents or natural persons can be\nproperly held responsible, while the latter hold that some collectives\ndo count as subjects of responsibility (cf. Mathiesen 2006; Pettit\n2007b; Hindriks 2009); depending on context and group size, there may\nbe a number of tenable intermediate positions on this spectrum. In any\ncase, it seems plausible to assume that one’s account of\ncollective responsibility should not be starkly discontinuous with\none’s account of collective agency. And it seems hardly\nspectacular to assume that a differentiated account of collective\nintentionality can inform a differentiated account of collective\nresponsibility. Systematically minded social philosophers are called\nupon to take up these challenges. \nCoordination is a basic social phenomenon. It comes into play when\nthere are two or more agents each of which has two or more options\nwhich are known to the agents to be interdependent in such a way that\nit does not matter so much to any individual participant which option\nis chosen, just as long as all agents converge on one option.\nCoordination usually involves conventions. Driving on the right side\nmay not per se be seen as preferable to driving on the left\nside, but all rational participants in motorized traffic easily agree\nthat there needs to be some convention here, and observe it in\npractice. If in situations of pure coordination (with no conflict of\ninterest) there is a convention, it seems natural to say that it is\nrational for the participants to act accordingly. \nSurprisingly, classical game theory fails to support this intuition.\nFrom a classical game theoretical point of view, the fact that the\nright side traffic rule is common knowledge between agents does not\nmake it rational to act accordingly. All that can be said is that it\nis rational for A to stick to the convention if A\nexpects the other to stick to the convention, too. However, the\nsame holds true for a violation of the convention. If A\nexpects B to violate the convention, it is rational for\nhim to do likewise in order to avoid a collision. As there is common\nknowledge of rationality, however, A knows that B will\nstick to the convention only if he or she expects A to do\nlikewise. Thus the condition cannot be settled, and the assertoric\njudgment that it is better to stick to the convention cannot be\nderived from the hypothetical judgment that this is the thing to do if\nthe other does so as well. As the rational choice, classical game\ntheory recommends a mixed strategy in such situations, which is\nremarkably bad advice for real life, and luckily descriptively\ninadequate. \nOne might think that rational coordination is made easier for the\nagents posited in game theoretic models if deviation from the\nconvention is sanctioned (e.g., by fines inflicted on those drivers\nwhich violate the traffic rule). In that case, there is typically one\ncoordination equilibrium which is better for both, and another\ncoordination equilibrium which is worse for both, but still better as\nfailures to coordinate. Yet this does surprisingly little to change\nthe situation from a classical game-theoretic point of view. In fact,\nthis shifts the recommended mixed strategy somewhat into the direction\nof more frequent selection of violation of the convention. \nA series of authors have argued that this reveals a fundamental flaw\nin the game-theoretic setting, and appeals to collective\nintentionality have persistently been made in this context. The idea\nis that agents may choose from a joint perspective; they do not\nconsider what’s best for them, individually, given the\nother’s expected choice, but look at such situations with an eye\non what’s best for them, jointly. One way of putting\nthis is to say that the failure of the classical model is to assume an\nidentity of the chooser that is fixed on the individual rather than\nseeing the identity of the chooser as variable. Michael Bacharach\n(2006), Robert Sugden (1993, 2000) and Martin Hollis (1998) have\ndeveloped corresponding accounts. In contrast to the\nliterature on collective intentionality, these accounts focus on ways\nof reasoning rather than forms of intention, or mental attitudes.\nHowever, these approaches can be seen as complementary to each other\n(Hakli, Miller & Tuomela 2010; see also Petersson 2016). Gold and\nSugden (2007) criticize Tuomela’s, Bratman’s,\nSearle’s and Gilbert’s accounts of collective\nintentionality, arguing that focusing on mental states or attitudes\nrather than modes of reasoning makes it impossible to see what is\ngenuinely collective about collective intentions. In their view,\ncollective intentions are the product of we-reasoning—a view\nthat is challenged by the phenomenon of spontaneous joint intentions,\nand perhaps by the circularity problem that team reasoning already\nsupposes some sense of doing something together. \nCollective or shared intentionality has been assigned a prominent role\nin recent research in evolutionary anthropology and developmental\npsychology. Michael Tomasello and his collaborators have suggested\nthat our capacity for shared intentionality is the most basic\ndifference between humans and other primates. The evidence quoted for\nthis claim is that while other primates seem to be apt strategic\nreasoners with an impressively well developed sense of what other\nindividuals perceive and want, the propensity to joint attention and\nthe inclination to cooperation even where this does not immediately\nserve one’s own purposes is uniquely human. Tomasello argues\nthat this basic cooperative-mindedness expresses a specifically human\ncapacity for shared intentionality (Tomasello & Racokzy 2003).\nIt is only on this base that other distinctively human capacities,\nsuch as the capacity for language and morality, can develop (Tomasello\n2009, 2016). Tomasello refers to Searle’s, Gilbert’s and\nBratman’s accounts, but remains largely noncommittal as to the\nquestion of what exactly the conception of shared intention he has in\nmind amounts to (Schmid 2012). However, his conception suggests that a\nSearlean version may be the basic form of shared intention, and that a\nnormatively stabilized conception of collective intentionality as\ndeveloped by Gilbert may be adequate for the forms of shared intention\ncoming a later stage in development. If Tomasello is right in claiming\nthat the basic capacity for shared intention precedes the development\nof a full theory of mind, this places tight conceptual restriction on\nan adequate analysis of basic shared intention, this seems to rule out\nthe common knowledge-condition that is implied even in Searle’s\n(2010) account.","contact.mail":"David.Schweikard@uni-flensburg.de","contact.domain":"uni-flensburg.de"},{"date.published":"2013-06-13","date.changed":"2020-12-09","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/collective-intentionality/","author1":"David P.

Collective intentional attitudes\npermeate our everyday lives, for instance when two or more agents look\nafter or raise a child, grieve the loss of a loved one, campaign for a\npolitical party, or cheer for a sports team. They are relevant for\nphilosophers and social scientists because they play crucial roles in\nthe constitution of the social world. In joint attention, the\nworld is experienced as perceptually available for a plurality of\nagents. This establishes a basic sense of common ground on which other\nagents may be encountered as potential cooperators. Shared\nintention enables the participants to act together intentionally,\nin a coordinated and cooperative fashion, and to achieve collective\ngoals. The capacity for shared belief provides us with a common stock\nof knowledge, and thus with a background against which relevant new\ninformation which we may want to share with others becomes salient.\nCollective acceptance is crucial for the development of\nlanguage, and for a whole world of symbols, institutions, and social\nstatus. Collective emotions provide us with a shared\nconception of what matters to us, together, and they establish\nreadiness for joint action. In virtue of capacity for collective\nintentionality, we can (and should) engage in joint reasoning and\ndeliberation, and (re-)organize ourselves to make sure that the way we\nlive together is how we, collectively, want it to be, from our\nsmall-scale communities to global politics.\n\n\nCollective intentional attitudes involve a plurality of participants\nin such a way that the attitudes in question can be ascribed to\nindividuals as a group, or unit. The main philosophical\nchallenge connected with the analysis of collective intentionality is\nin the tension within the expression “individuals as a\ngroup”. It can be spelled out as a contradiction between the\nfollowing two widely accepted claims (the Central Problem): \n\nCollective intentionality is no simple summation, aggregate, or\ndistributive pattern of individual intentionality (the Irreducibility\nClaim);\n\n Collective intentionality is had by the participating\nindividuals, and all the intentionality an individual has is their own\n(the Individual Ownership Claim). \n\nOver the last couple of decades, a number of theories of collective\nintentionality have been proposed, pointing towards different ways to\nsolve this tension.\n\nSuppose you intend to visit the Taj Mahal tomorrow, and I intend to\nvisit the Taj Mahal tomorrow. This does not not make it the case that\nwe intend to visit the Taj Mahal together. If I know about your plan,\nI may express (or refer to) our intention in the form “we intend\nto visit the Taj Mahal tomorrow”. But this does not imply\nanything collective about our intentions. Even if knowledge about our\nplan is common, mutual, or open between us, my intention and your\nintention may still be purely individual. For us to intend to visit\nthe Taj Mahal together is something different. \nDistributions (summations, aggregates) of individual intentions do not\nmake for collective intentions, even if combined with common\nknowledge, or mutual belief. This is accepted by an increasing number\nof contributors to the recent debate. Collectively intentional\nattitudes are not just sets of run-of-the-mill individual intentional\nattitudes combined with common knowledge or mutual belief. Another way\nof putting this is to say that collective intentionality is\nirreducible to individual intentionality (though this is\ngenerally accepted only insofar as individual intentionality is\nnarrowly understood). It is only in virtue of its irreducibility that\nthe intentional state in question can be attributed to the\nparticipants as a group. \nWhat does it mean for us to intend as a group? Surely, if we\nintend to visit the Tay Mahal together, it is you and me who intend\nthe shared activity, not some third subject over and above our heads,\nthe group. That we intend as a group does not displace you\nand me as the intenders of the action in question. To say that the\ngroup intends to go for a walk is the same as saying that the\nparticipating individuals intend to go for a walk— if\n“together” is added to the latter clause (and where\nexactly it has to be inserted is a crucial philosophical question).\nCollective intentions can be attributed to individuals, but only\ncollectively, it seems, and not distributively. The view that the\nintentional attitudes in question are the participant\nindividuals’ collectively rather than distributively, however,\nis in tension with the view that even if an individual participates in\ncollective intentionality, all the intentional attitudes that\nindividuals has are their own (the Individual Ownership Thesis). \nOn the naturalist version of the Individual Ownership Thesis, any\n(primary) intentional state is a higher order feature of a brain. It\nis not the case that in collective intentionality, individual brains\nare integrated in a Borg-like manner to form a collective super-brain.\nTherefore, it seems that collective intentionality reduces to an\naggregate, or combination, of individual brain states. According to an\ninternalist version, all the intentionality an individual has is\nstructurally independent of the existence or non-existence of anything\noutside the individual mind. The question of whether or not an\nindividual’s intentional states are collective is therefore\nsettled by internal features of individual minds. A third version,\nthat might seem attractive to non-naturalists and externalists,\nemphasizes that intentional states are, or involve, commitments. It\nseems, however, that only an individual agent’s own intentional\nstates can commit them to a particular course of action, or to\ninferences. Other individuals’ intentional states may provide an\nagent with a reason only on the base of what they themselves believe\nor desire. Thus, it seems that the commitments involved in collective\nintentional states are the individual commitments of each of the\nparticipants. \nIn all of these and related versions of the Individual Ownership\nThesis, the basic claim is that each individual has a mind of their\nown, and has a sort of intentional autonomy that is incompatible with\nthe view that individual minds are somehow fused when intentional\nstates are shared. Thus, the Individual Ownership Thesis places tight\nrestrictions on non-reductivism about collective intentionality. Most\nparticipants in the current debate accept a version of the\nIrreducibility Claim, and a version of the Individual Ownership\nThesis, and they set out to show how these could be modified in such a\nway as to be mutually compatible. \nThe label “collective intentionality” is fairly recent (in\nits current meaning, it was introduced by John Searle in his 1990\npaper “Collective Intentions and Actions”). In contrast to\nthe label, the concept is not new. The idea of collective\nintentionality is implied in such notions as Aristotle’s concept\nof koinonía (common striving), Jean-Jacque\nRousseau’s collective will (volonté\ngénérale), or in notions such as the spirit\nof peoples and related concepts as developed in German Idealism\nor the Historical School of Law. Somewhat more explicit conceptions of\ncollective intentionality can be found in early social and\nsociological theory\n (2.1),\n Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy\n (2.2),\n and in the works of Robin G. Collingwood and Wilfrid Sellars\n (2.3).\n These largely independent sources focus on key issues in the analysis\nof collective intentionality that persist through history into the\npresent. \nEmile Durkheim (1898) and Max Weber (1922) have developed conceptions\nof collective intentionality under other labels, and they have come to\nquite different and indeed opposite views. \nDurkheim claims that social facts have to be accounted for in terms of\ncollective consciousness rather than individual attitudes.\nHis (1898) example of people who are involved in a mass emotion, of\nwhich they cannot make sense in terms of their own personal views and\nfeelings, is often quoted as an illustration. Indeed, Durkheim’s\nview is sometimes even argued to be the direct historical root of the\ncurrent debate on collective intentionality (Olen/Turner 2015).\nDurkheim’s remarks on the role of collective consciousness\nsuggest a view of the collective “taking over control” and\nbypassing individual intentional psychology in the explanation of\naction (though Durkheim’s views can also be reconstructed along\nless collectivist lines; see Turner 1986). Durkheim’s work is\none of the historical sources for the analysis of collective emotions\n(von Scheve and Salmela 2014). \nWeber, by contrast, is famous for assigning the decisive role in the\nexplanation of social facts to the intentional attitudes of\nindividuals. He claims that many social situations are situations of\nstrategic interdependence between individual decisions. In such\nsituations, fully rational agents choose their preferred course of\naction on the basis of what they cognitively expect other agents to\ndo. However, Weber is well aware of the fact that where dependence of\neach participant’s choice on his or her expectation concerning\nthe other’s behavior is out in the open, the situation becomes\nunstable. In addressing this issue, Weber discusses the case in which\npeople act on the assumption of being in agreement with other\nagents, which then enables them to have normative\nexpectations concerning each other’s behavior. This is a\ndecisive step beyond what has later become known as rational choice\ntheory. Such agents do not choose according to what they think to be\nbest given what they think others are likely to do; rather, they rely\non others to do what they ought to do. This need not, Weber\nclaims, be a matter of explicit agreement, but may be grounded in a\nsense of the agent’s shared aims (and thus, we would now say, in\ncollective intentionality). However, such action orientation appears\nas not fully rational in Weber’s conception (Weber 1922).\nWeber’s conception thus foreshadows the neglect of collective\nintentions and actions in later rational choice and game theory.  \n(Quasi-)Durkheim’s and Weber’s conceptions mark the Scylla\nand the Charybdis of the debate. The Scylla is a straightforward\nanti-reductivism about collective intentionality that comes at the\ncost of a flat-out rejection of individual intentional autonomy. The\nCharybdis is a reductionist attempt that denies collective\nintentionality for rational social agents. \nSubstantive and concise philosophical analyses of collective\nintentionality can be found in early Phenomenology and Existential\nPhilosophy. These contributions have attracted increasing attention in\nrecent years (Salice & Schmid 2016; Moran & Szanto 2016).\nAmong the many relevant contributions and contributors (including\nEdmund Husserl, Edith Stein, and Jean-Paul Sartre), two stand out as\nparticularly important: Gerda Walther (1923), and Max Scheler (1954\n[1912]). The paradigm case in their (implicit) controversy is shared\nexperience. \nWalther claims that for A and B to share the experience\nof x, i) A has to experience x, and B has\nto experience x, ii) A has to empathize with\nB’s experience and vice versa, iii) A has to\nidentify with B’s experience and vice versa, and iv)\nthere has to be mutual empathetic awareness of the other’s\nidentification (Walther 1923: 85f.). Walther offers substantive\nanalyses of empathetic experience and identification, but the question\nremains why the reciprocal intentional attitudes required from the\nparticipants in shared experience stops at level three (current\naccounts that follow similar lines usually require full common\nknowledge). How could there be a shared experience between A\nand B if A is unaware of the fact that B\nis empathetically aware of A’s identification with\nB’s experience, or some such? It seems easy to develop a\nscenario in which Walther’s conditions are met, but in which\nthere is no shared experience for lack of awareness of what the other\ntakes to be the case. If collective intentionality is analyzed in\nterms of a combination of individual intentionality and mutual\nrecognition of some sorts, it seems that an infinite progress of\nreciprocal attitudes is set off. \nScheler’s most important contribution to the analysis of\ncollective intentionality is largely negative. Joint intentionality is\nnot, Scheler holds, a combination of individual intentionality with a\nstructure of reciprocal awareness, whatever the structure and kind of\nthe reciprocal awareness in question may be. From his analysis emerges\nthe view that when people share an attitude, it is not the case that\neach participant has an attitude of his or her own, but that the\nintentional attitude at stake here is really one and the same, so that\nmany minds are in a numerically identical state. The most\nconspicuous examples Scheler discusses are the experience of grief\nwhich parents, without thinking of each other, share at the deathbed\nof their child (Scheler 1954 [1912]: 145), and the chillingly positive\naccount of the shared national enthusiasm (the August Madness) at the\noutbreak of World War One (Scheler 1982 [1914]: 272ff.). Without\nmentioning his source, Martin Heidegger follows roughly Schelerian\nlines in his discussion of more innocent examples in (1996 [1928/29]).\nThe idea is that collective intentionality is not a combination of\nindividual intentionality and reciprocal attitudes, but irreducibly\ncollective (for a recent re-statement of this point see Searle 1995:\n27). A problem of irreducibility-claims of this sort, however, is that\nit is hard to believe that the participants in a collective\nintentional attitude do not represent, in some way, each other, even\nif they need not have occurrent beliefs or conscious empathetic\nexperience. A participant’s intention represents the others as\nco-intenders in some way, or so it seems (Searle seems to concede this\npoint in Searle 2010: 15). An important question to consider is\nwhether the relation between the co-intenders is of the cognitive,\nnormative, or rather of the affective kind. Tuomela & Miller\n(1988) and Michael Bratman (1999) argue that the participants have to\nknow what the others are up to, Alonso (2009) argues that\nthey just have to rely on them, while Gilbert (1990) claims\nthat they have to normatively expect others to do their\nparts. Schmid (2013) argues that the attitude in question is\ntrust, and that this combines cognitive and normative\ncomponents. The question of how participants in collective\nintentionality “represent” each other becomes particularly\npressing if it is assumed that basic cases of shared intentionality\nare developed at an age where infants do not have a theory of mind,\nsuch as in Michael Tomasello’s (2009) view. \nWhereas the mainstream of present debate about collective\nintentionality probably has no direct roots in early social theory or\nphenomenology, Wilfrid Sellars’ concept of we-intention is\nwidely acknowledged as the point of departure (Tuomela & Miller\n1988). We-intentions play a crucial role in Sellars’ practical\nphilosophy. As we-attitudes, normative judgments can both express\npeople’s attitudes, and have a claim to intersubjective\nvalidity. The concept of a we-intention thus bridges emotivism and\nintuitionism (Sellars 1974). We-intentions are attitudes, but at the\nsame time, they are not merely private, but involve a shared point of\nview from which the participants may critically assess each\nother’s contributions. \nSellars argues that even though we-intentions are not private, they do\nnot involve a group mind. His view is that we-intentions are had by\nindividuals, but that they differ from individual intentions in their\nform. According to the taxonomy developed below, his is a mode-account\nof collective intentionality. Sellars’ conception of\nwe-intention can be traced back to Robin G. Collingwood’s\nNew Leviathan (1947), where Collingwood defines society as\n \nthe sharing of certain persons in a practical social consciousness\nverbally expressed in a formula like ‘We will go for this\nwalk’ or ‘We will sail this boat’. (Collingwood\n1947: 146)  \nIn a chapter by the title “Society as joint will”,\nCollingwood argues that there is nothing mysterious about practical\nsocial consciousness (148). All the individual participant needs to\nhave is a however vague general idea of the enterprise as a whole, and\na special idea of the part in it allotted to himself. In addition, the\nparticipant must know that there are other agents who are partners\nwith him- or herself in this common endeavor, without having to know\nwho exactly they are. As “social consciousness,”\nsociety \nis nothing over and above its members. It has no will but the will of\nits members; no activity but the activity of its members; no\nresponsibility but the responsibility of its members. (149ff.). \nSellars’ interests differ from Collingwood’s, but his\nanalysis closely follows Collingwood’s lines. Sellars agrees\nwith Collingwood that the attitude in question requires no group mind\ncapable of belief or intention over and above the heads of the\nparticipating individuals (Sellars 1968: 203). On this account, all\nintentionality involved in group intention and group action is had\nby individuals, but it is conceived as intentionality of a\nspecial sort, which Sellars calls “action we-referential\nintention”, or, in short, “we-intention”. It is thus\nindividuals, and not a group, that intend a joint action\n(Sellars 1980: 98). This, however, leads Sellars to one of the deepest\nproblems in the analysis of collective practical intentionality. One\ncannot intend what one takes to be entirely beyond one’s\nabilities, or beyond one’s control (Sellars calls this the\n“‘up to the agent’ness” [Sellars 1980: 98] of\nintention). Objects of intention are taken, by the agent, to be\n“up to her”, to some degree at least. How, then, can\nindividuals have we-intentions? It seems plausible to assume that the\nbehavior of each individual, insofar as it is an action, is up to that\nindividual him- or herself. An individual who has an\naction-we-referential intention, however, does not only intend his or\nher own behavior, but also the behavior of the other participants, and\nthis behavior is not up to him- or herself, but up to others. Thus\nwe-intention seems to be incompatible with the ‘up to the\nagent’-ness of intention. \nIn the current debate, this problem is sometimes bypassed by shifting\nfrom action-referential to propositional intentions. Michael Bratman\nanalyzes shared intentions in terms of “intention,\nthat” rather than “intention to”\n(in a closely related vein, Raimo Tuomela distinguishes action\nintentions from aim intentions in parts of his work; e.g., Tuomela\n2007: 84f.). To intend that the door be closed is different\nfrom intending to close the door in that in the former case,\nthe subject having that intention may differ from the subject of the\nintended action. Thus the problem with we-referential intentions seems\nto disappear as soon as intention is conceived of in propositional\nrather than in action-referential terms. Sellars is fully aware of the\npossibility of that move:  \nIt is important to see that I can not only intend to do something\nmyself, I can also intend that someone else do something, i.e., that\nit be the case that he does it. (Sellars 1968: 184)  \nYet Sellars sees clearly that this apparent escape route is really a\ndead end, and again, he follows Collingwood, who argued that\nconsciousness, insofar it is practical, is not a matter of\n“making up your mind that”, but a matter of\n“making up your mind to” (Collingwood 1947: 139).\nTalk of “intention that something be the case”,\nSellars argues, may be grammatically correct, but it is understandable\nas talk of practical commitments only in virtue of its\nrelation to “intention to”. When spelled out, the\nintention that p is really the intention to make it the case\nthat p (Sellars 1968: 184). Thus a person’s intention\nthat “we” do x, or that somebody else does\nx, is a practical commitment only as an action-referential\nintention (intention to): one intends to do whatever is\nnecessary to make it the case that we do x, or that somebody\nelse does x. This yields a solution to the problem (which\nSellars later calls “superficial”). A person may simply\nassume that it is up to her what other people do because she takes\nherself to have an influence on these other people (Sellars\n1968: 188). \nThat we can influence people is as relevant to practical reasoning as\nthat we can influence sticks or stones. (Sellars 1980: 88) \nAn agent who intends to bring her influence on others to bear in such\na way as to make it the case that others do what is necessary for the\nintended state to obtain, however, does not have a proper\nwe-intention. The reason is that such intentionality does not go\nbeyond an egocentric perspective; it involves an extension of the\nrange of one’s own intentionality into other people’s\nagency rather than any sense of sharing. Remember that Sellars\ndevelops the idea of we-intention with an eye on making the intuition\nthat normative judgments express intentional attitudes compatible with\nthe view that they involve a claim to intersubjective validity. Just\nthat I intend to influence other people to behave in a certain way, or\nto form certain intentions, does not make my attitude intersubjective\nin such a way as to provide a stance for mutual critical\nassessment. \nIn On Reasoning about Values (1980), Sellars offers\nan alternative solution to the ‘up to the agent’ness\nproblem of we-intention: it involves \nthe fact […] that to say that the intendible constituents of an\nintention are those which are present sub specie ‘up to\nme’ is equivalent to accompanying them with the conditional\n‘if it is up to me’. […] Now ‘up to me’\nis the first person form of ‘up to X’. […]\nThus the correct answer to the above challenge consists in calling\nattention to the fact that the ‘up to the agent’ness of\naction we-referential intention is to be formulated as follows:\n‘Shall [each of us, if it is up to them, do\nA]’ And this in no way requires that what others\ndo be up to me. (1980: 98)  \nThus Sellars’ view is that when individuals we-intend to do\nsomething together, each one has his or her own we-intention.\n“[T]he intendings are two in number, but the\ncontent of these intendings is the same”\n(1968: 217). \nIn Sellars’ view, we-intentions are intentions had by\nindividuals; we-intending individuals have their own\nintention, and the action intended by a we-intending agent is limited\nto what the agent takes to be up to him- or herself. This means that\nthe existence of we-intention does not imply that an intention is\nactually shared, an idea that resembles Searle’s claim\nthat collective intentionality can be had by envatted brains (1990:\n406). This raises the question of what has to be the case for a\nwe-intending individual actually to intend together with\nothers. One person’s we-intention does not make for a collective\nintention. Other we-intending individuals need to be around. But is it\nenough for an intention to be joint that other individuals happen to\nbe around who have a we-intention with the exact same content? If one\nbrain in a vat cannot we-intend alone, can two, if not\ntogether? How do the we-intentions of individual participants\nhave to be related to each other in order to constitute a\ngenuine collective intention? Sellars’ analysis may not provide\na conclusive answer, but he presents at least two further insights\nthat seem highly relevant to the current debate. \nFirst, Sellars emphasizes the difference between two types of\nI-referential intentions. Primary I-referential intentions\nare different from we-derivative I-referential intentions in\nthat the content of the latter are contributions to joint actions. A\ngreat many intentions are we-derivative in that sense. My intention to\nmove a pawn on the chessboard is derivative from our intention to play\na game of chess. \nSecond, Sellars leaves ample room for what could be called\nintentional dissidence. Many current analyses assume that for\nus to intend x, each of us has to intend to do his or her\nshare. Sellars is keenly aware that this may not always be the case.\nIntentions may be ascribed to groups, as shared, without assuming that\neach participant intends to do his or her share. Yet Sellars\nacknowledges that the less of our collective intentions and beliefs an\nindividual shares, the more difficult it becomes to see him or her as\n“one of us” (Sellars 1968: 203). We-intentions are a\nmatter of a “shared point of view” that involves\nidentification with a group (Sellars 1980: 101). The question of\nwhether or not group identification needs to be in the individual\nparticipants’ self-interest remains open. Whether or not a\nsituation of choice is looked at in terms of one’s\n“private” or “shared” point of view depends on\nwhom one takes oneself to be: a solitary individual or a group member.\nSellars’ aim is not to provide a theory of identity selection.\nHis claim is that the moral point of view requires us to\nabandon the egocentric perspective, and to conceive of ourselves as\n“one of us”. The “we” at play here has to be\nunderstood in the least parochial sense. Only such we-intentionality\nactually serves the purpose for which Sellars devised the term\n“we-intention”; only the we-intentions that are\nuniversally shared, and no parochial group attitudes, constitute the\nmoral point of view. \nA common starting point of the theory of intentionality can be\nrendered as follows: (1) intentionality is taken to be a feature of\nminds, (2) minds are to be conceived as individual minds (or minds of\nindividuals), and (3) each individual has his or her own\nmind. We call this third statement, which is most relevant to the\ntopic at hand, the Individual Ownership Thesis. But how can\nintentional attitudes be shared in more than a merely\ndistributive sense? Or how can what we call the Irreducibility Claim\nbe true? In meeting the challenge of making irreducibility compatible\nwith individual ownership, a lot depends on where exactly the\ncollectivity is placed in the analysis of collective\nintentionality. \nIntentionality is commonly divided into three constitutive features.\nFirst, intentionality has content. The content of an\nintentional attitude is whatever the attitude in question is\nabout (e.g., the content of the intention to visit the Taj\nMahal is to visit the Taj Mahal). Second, intentionality has\na mode. The mode is what distinguishes a case of fear from a\ncase of intention, or a belief from a desire. Basic modes are the\nmodes of conative or practical intentional attitudes (such as\nintentions or desires), cognitive or theoretical intentional attitudes\n(such as beliefs or perceptions), and affective or emotional attitudes\n(such as hopes and fears). And third, intentionality has a\nsubject, that is, an entity whose intentionality it is, and\nto whom it can be ascribed as its source or bearer. \nWhereas there is a widely shared consensus among the participants in\nthe debate that there is no straightforward reduction of collective\nintentional attitudes to a set of individual intentional attitudes,\nthe question of what exactly is collective about collective\nintentionality is highly controversial. Each of the three components\nof intentional attitudes has been quoted as the seat or locus of the\nsharedness or collectivity in question. Some authors claim that\ncollective intentionality is intentionality with a collective\ncontent, others seem to invoke a special mode, while\nstill others claim that what’s collective about collective\nintentionality has to be the subject. Content-accounts claim that for\nA and B’s intention to visit the Taj Mahal\ntomorrow to be collective, each A and B have to intend\nto visit the Taj Mahal together. Mode-accounts insist that\nthe element of collectivity has to extend to the intending; in their\nview, A and B have to intend collectively to\nvisit the Taj Mahal (together). Subject-accounts hold that the element\nof togetherness is really in the subject; in their view, A and\nB have to form a plural subject or a unified group that is the\nsubject of—and has—the intention to visit the Taj\nMahal. \nThe paradigm of collective intentionality in the recent debate is\njoint intention (collective practical intentionality).\nAnalyses of joint intention will thus serve as a common reference\npoint in the following discussion of content-, mode-, and\nsubject-accounts of collective intentionality. \nWhat do the agents A and B have to intend for their\nintention to go for a walk to be collective? A first approach consists\nin saying that the relevant intentions of A and B do not\nrefer to their own individual walks, but to their joint walk. Instead\nof each intending to go for a walk, A and B would each\nintend the joint walk. This move is crucial to Michael Bratman’s\napproach to the analysis of what he terms ‘shared cooperative\nactivity’ (cf. Bratman 1999, chaps. 5–8, 2006, and 2014).\nIt is based on the view that action intentions do not just come in the\nform “I intend to X,” as when an agent\nintends to perform some action. On Bratman’s account, intentions\ncan also take the form “I intend that we\nJ” (cf. Bratman 1999, chap. 8), where J refers to\na joint activity in which the intending agent participates. This\nrepresents the participating agents as not just intending their\nrespective contributions, but as intending the joint activity; in the\ncase at hand, A and B are said to intend that they go\nfor a walk together. Although the focus at this point should be on\nthat core element, it is expedient to cite one version of the entire\nanalysis. \nWe intend to J if and only if \nThis gives the structure of what Bratman calls a “shared\nintention,” which he takes to be an intention to J shared\nby the participants. It is depicted as consisting in a complex nexus\nof interdependent individual attitudes and not as the intention of a\ncollective agent or as a state of some collective mind (cf. Bratman\n1999: 122–3). For there to be a joint activity, Bratman holds,\nthe participating agents have to intend this activity in such a way\nthat their so intending is aligned both socially and with other plans\n(or subplans) on each side and that it is common knowledge between\nthem. \nThus, the claim here is that intentions of the form “I intend\nthat we X” are basic to the intentionality of joint\naction. Critics have argued that Bratman’s account is defective\nin so far as it treats intentions of that form as basic, since they\nviolate either (1) the condition that one can only intend one’s\nown action, or (2) the condition that one can only control one’s\nown and no other agent’s actions, or (3) the condition that one\ncan only intend what one can take to be in a position to settle (see\nBaier 1997; Stoutland 1997; Velleman 1997). Bratman clarifies in reply\n(in Bratman 1999, chap. 8) that intentions of the form “I intend\nthat we X” are formed under the assumption that the\npartner in a shared activity does or will come to intend likewise.\nInstead of positing that in order to form such an intention an agent\nhas to be certain about their partner’s intentions, Bratman\ncontends that an agent is typically in a position to reliably predict\nwhether the other will come to form a corresponding intention. Given\nthat both agents form their intentions in this manner, whereby a\nshared intention comes into existence, they can both regard themselves\nas having partly settled the issue in question. On this account,\nneither of the agents controls for the other’s intention\nformation or action as their intentions are each understood as\npartially constitutive of the shared intention. \nAnother charge against Bratman’s and other accounts that ground\nan understanding of collective intentionality in individual\nagents’ intentions is that such intentions are circular (cf. the\ndiscussion of Tuomela 2005 below). The idea behind this criticism is\nthat such intentions presuppose rather than constitute collective\nintentionality (cf. Schmid 2005; Petersson 2007). For how can an\nindividual refer to a joint activity without the jointness, i.e., the\n‘we,’ already being in place? How can an agent assume that\nothers will intend likewise without presupposing the collectivity of\ntheir so intending? Instead of being foundational for shared\nintentions or collective intentionality, such intentions might turn\nout to be redundant expressions of an already existing collective\nintentionality. \nA reply available within Bratman’s account may refer to a\npresupposition of the formation of a shared intention. According to\nBratman (1999, chap. 5), shared agency requires that the individual\nagents involved be mutually responsive, i.e., that each seeks to be\nresponsive to the other’s intentions and actions and that each\nseeks to guide their own behavior with an eye to the behavior of the\nother. It is in this sense, and the phrase “in accordance with\nand because of” in the scheme given above signals this, that the\nways the agents involved form their respective intentions can be said\nto interconnect. Hence the idea behind this reply would be to ground\nthe intentional reference to the joint activity in mutual\nresponsiveness. (Bratman 2014, chapter 2, offers more reflections of\nthe charge of circularity; cf. Petersson 2015 for discussion.) \nIt is not clear whether this response can successfully deal with the\ncharge of circularity. Whereas it may be that in some scenarios the\nagents involved actually realize that they want to cooperate so that\ntheir processes of intention formation interconnect and they come to\nhave intentions as Bratman specifies them, the problem of circularity\nmay just crop up again with respect to the required interconnection.\nIt could be that instantiating interconnected processes of intention\nformation just presupposes the collectivity it is meant to\nconstitute. \nThe merits of Bratman’s approach clearly lie in its highlighting\nthat whatever joint intentions are, they do involve interrelated\nintentional attitudes on the part of the individual agents involved.\nHowever, many critics think that treating reference to the joint\nactivity as central and at the same time retaining the\n‘I’-form of the constitutive individual intentions makes\nfor a fundamental problem of circularity. \nBefore turning to a different type of account in which this particular\nproblem of circularity is (at least apparently) circumvented, it\nshould be noted that Bratman’s adherence to the\n‘I’-form of intentions is expressive of the individualism\nunderlying his approach. Already in the first statement of his account\nhe points out that it is “reductive in spirit” (Bratman\n1999: 108) and clarifies that the core “claim […] is that\nshared intention consists primarily of attitudes of individuals and\ntheir interrelations” (1999: 129). Even though Bratman has\nspecified the dimensions of the interrelations between the attitudes\nof the individual agents involved (cf. Bratman 2006), some critics\nhave taken issue with the claim that the attitudes constitutive of\nshared intentions have to stand in the singular, i.e., the\n‘I’-form (cf. Baier 1997; Stoutland 1997; Schmid 2009;\nSchweikard 2011). This line of criticism pertains to the picture thus\ndrawn of shared intention as a social phenomenon that is constructed\nout of I-form-attitudes as building blocks, a picture that understates\nthe relevance both of relations between the individuals involved and\nof the role of social identification expressed by the use of\n‘we.’ \nOther contributors to the analysis of collective intentional states\nclaim that the collectivity resides not just in the content of the\nintentionality but also in a specifically collective mode or we-mode.\nIf individuals share an intention, it is not just the case that they\neach intend a joint action; rather, they intend the joint action\ncollectively. \nThis shift of focus is best grasped by noticing two main elements:\nfirst, mode accounts include the claim that the attitudes that\nconstitute shared or joint attitudes are to be verbalized using the\nplural pronoun “we,” as in “we intend to go to the\nTaj Mahal” or “we believe that the Taj Mahal is in\nIndia.” Second, (some) mode accounts emphasize that such\nattitudes are not just verbalized in a certain way, but are expressive\nof the particular and fundamental sociality of their bearers. Raimo\nTuomela (2007, 2013) suggests distinguishing between (different\nstrengths of) I-mode and we-mode, picking out different ways of having\nintentional attitudes, where having an attitude in the I-mode means\nhaving it ‘as a private person’ and having it in the\nwe-mode means having it ‘as a group member’ (cf. Tuomela\n2007: 46). \nThe distinctions between attitudes verbalized in the singular form and\nattitudes verbalized in the plural form, and between I-mode and\nwe-mode, are not to be conflated with the distinction between modes of\nintentionality introduced above. Instead, the idea underlying mode\naccounts is to spell out a distinction that can be applied to\npractical (or conative), to cognitive, and to affective intentional\nstates, yielding a conceptual framework for analyzing the entire\nspectrum of collective intentional states. The idea is that the\nparticipating agents have attitudes of a special kind or\nform. \nA direct and explicit predecessor of mode accounts is Wilfrid Sellars,\nto whom, as was noted above, Tuomela and Miller refer as a source of\ntheir original account of we-intentions (cf. Tuomela & Miller\n1988). Focusing on cases of joint action and the respective\nintentional states, they analyze an individual agent’s\nwe-intention regarding a joint activity as consisting of (1) the\nintention to do her part, (2) a belief that others will to their\nparts, and (3) a belief that there is (or will be) mutual belief among\nthe agents involved that the relevant opportunities for performing the\njoint activity obtain (cf. Tuomela & Miller 1988: 375; see also\nTuomela 1991: 252; Tuomela 2005: 340–41) \nIn conceiving of we-intention as a special kind of intention had by an\nindividual agent, the analysis is true to Sellars’ understanding\nof we-intentions (cf.\n section 2.3\n above). As Tuomela and Miller put it, an individual agent can be said\nto ‘we-intend’ the joint action X if she has a\nrespective individual intention regarding her contribution and certain\nbeliefs about the actions and beliefs of the other agents involved.\nSuch a we-intention is not in itself an action intention on a par with\nthe participatory intention of a single agent, it is an ‘aim\nintention’ directed at the joint action (cf. Tuomela 2005;\n329–30). By contrast to content accounts, this account posits\nthat the intentionality of joint action consists in a particular form\nof intending instantiated by the individual agents involved. If the\nmembers of a group perform a joint action together, then this is in\nvirtue of each of them having a we-intention of the form given here;\ne.g., their joint action of going to the Taj Mahal is performed in\nvirtue of each having the we-intention to go to the Taj Mahal. \nIn his first contribution to this debate, John Searle criticized\nTuomela’s and Miller’s account as typical “in that\nit attempts to reduce collective intentions to individual intentions\nplus beliefs” (Searle 1990: 404; cf. Searle 2010: 46). In\nparticular, Searle rejects the idea of reducing\n‘we’-attitudes to ‘I’-attitudes. But he does\nnot understand the reverse claim, according to which collective\nintentionality is irreducible or “primitive” (Searle 1990:\n404), as having an impact on the internalist claim that all\nintentionality “has to exist inside individuals’\nheads” (Searle 2010: 44; cf. Searle 1990: 406). From\nSearle’s perspective, Tuomela and Miller are right in not\npositing the existence of a form of intentionality that somehow\ntranscends individuals’ minds, but they go wrong in claiming\nthat we-intentions can be reduced to I-intentions plus beliefs. Such a\nreduction fails, Searle holds, because thinking and conceiving of a\njoint action in the “we”-form is the core characteristic\nof cooperation. When A and B go to the Taj Mahal\ntogether, Searle’s account has it that each of them has the\nthought “We are going to the Taj Mahal” in his head; and\nthis is what makes theirs a joint action, since each derives his\ncontributory or participatory intention from his collective intention,\nassuming that the respective other will perform his contribution (cf.\nSearle 2010: 52–53). \nSearle’s account of the structure of collective intentionality\nhas been criticized precisely with respect to the combination of the\nclaim that the ‘we’ is irreducible with the claim that all\nintentionality resides in individual minds. Some critics have noted\nthat Searle embraces a solipsistic and individualistic methodology\n(see Searle 1990: 415 and Searle 2010: 47) that makes it impossible to\naccount for the intersubjective or interpersonal relations that\ncharacterize joint activities and social communities (see e.g.,\nMeijers 1994, 2003; Schmid 2003, 2009; Zaibert 2003). Such relations\nare explicitly bracketed out in Searle’s account. But it seems\nplausible to hold that successful coordination of efforts in pursuit\nof shared goals requires that the relations between the agents\ninvolved and the attitudes of the respective others figure in the\nintentional structure of this social process. For a complex event to\nbe not just a coincidentally matching pattern of actions by individual\nagents but an intentional joint action, it needs a complex structure\nof attitudes in which the agents involved refer to one another. The\nonly reference to a collectivity Searle incorporates into his account,\nthe plural indexical ‘we,’ is taken to be primitive and\naccessible to a solipsistic analysis (cf. Searle 1990: 415). Although\nthis insistence on the we-form of the intentionality allows\nclassifying Searle’s conception as a mode-account, its\nelaboration does not look convincing. His conception renders\ncollective intentionality distributive in the sense that the\ndistinctive mark of the phenomena in question is claimed not to be\ninstantiated by individuals together, by individuals-in-relations, by\nplural subjects or groups, but to the full by each of the individuals\ninvolved. \nThe description of this strand of the debate sidesteps the fact that\nit is not entirely clear whether the point of Tuomela’s and\nMiller’s analysis of we-intention is to provide a reductive\naccount of collective intentionality. In fact, Tuomela has repeatedly\nrejected this interpretation of the analysis (see, for instance\nTuomela 1995, chap. 9; Tuomela 2005: 342). He clarified that his\nanalysis of we-intention, which remained essentially unchanged\nthroughout subsequent work of his, “is rather meant to elucidate\nthe irreducible notion of we-intention in a functionally informative\nway” (Tuomela 2005: 358) and grounded in an “ontically\nindividualistic or, better, interrelational” framework (2005:\n342). This suggests reading the analysis not as reductive but as\nexplicative in the sense that it explicates the complex structure of\nattitudes that constitutes an individual agent’s we-intending.\nThis again provides the core element of Tuomela’s conception of\nthe intentionality that guides joint action, i.e., the analysis of\nwhat he calls ‘joint intention:’ \n(JI) Agents A1, …,\nAi, …, Am\nhave the joint intention to perform a joint action X\nif and only if \nIn the case of joint intention the conatively used ‘We will do\nX’ is true of each participant\nAi. (Tuomela 2005: 342) \nThis scheme not only makes explicit that on Tuomela’s account\neach participant in a joint action is viewed as having a we-intention\nin the sense specified above, it also highlights important\nsimilarities between this conception and Bratman’s conception of\n‘shared intentions.’ However, as signaled by the\nrespective choice of terminology, Tuomela thinks of the intentional\nstructure of collective action as consisting in individual attitudes\njoined together, whereas Bratman conceives of it as being\nshared among the participants. According to both accounts it\nis a core element of collective intentionality that each of the\nindividual agents involved refers to the others’ intentions and\nbeliefs regarding the joint activity. However, even if it is granted\nthat the crucial difference between these accounts regards the mode of\nthe constitutive attitudes, it needs to be seen whether the charge of\ncircularity discussed above also affects Tuomela’s account of\nwe-intentions (cf. Miller 2001 and Schmid 2005). \nThe charge of circularity targets the element of Tuomela’s (and\nMiller’s) analysis of we-intentions according to which the\nwe-intending individual agent refers to her part of the joint action\nX and has beliefs regarding others’ contributions and\nbeliefs. If the agent is to intend to do her part of X and if\nshe is to be able to refer to others’ contributions and beliefs,\nso the objection goes, then the collectivity that is meant to be\nconstituted by we-intentions has to be presupposed. Tuomela’s\nreply to this objection has the following three elements: first, the\npoint of the analysis is not that collectivity is constituted\nby but that it consists in the participants’\nhaving we-intentions, where this crucially depends on their\nsatisfaction of what Tuomela calls the ‘collectivity\ncondition,’ i.e., the condition that one participant can only\nhave a we-intention if others have an isomorphic we-intention (cf.\nTuomela 2005: 333 and 339). Second, Tuomela takes the analysis of\nwe-intention not to be an instance of vicious circularity (cf. Tuomela\n2005, sec. VI.), since from the pre-analytic perspective of the\nparticipant the performance of the joint action, including an\nallocation of contributions, is presumed and anticipated but not\npresupposed. Third, Tuomela does not view we-intentions and other\nelements of his account as independent building blocks but only as\nanalytically isolatable parts of a complex whole (cf. Tuomela 2007:\n125–6); once again, the guiding idea is not to track the\ncomposition of collectivity from basic and independent elements, but\nto elucidate what collectivity consists in. \nIn his more recent work on collective intentionality, Tuomela has\ngeneralized the idea underlying his analysis of we-intention to a\ndifferentiated conception of the socially shared point of view that\nunderlies social and collective phenomena (see especially Tuomela\n2003, 2007, and 2013; for a critical discussion see Schmitz 2017). At\nthe core of this conception lies a fine-grained distinction between\nvariations of what he calls the ‘I-mode’ and the\n‘we-mode,’ all of which specify ways in which individuals\nhave attitudes relative to a group whose member they are. When an\nindividual reasons or has attitudes in the ‘I-mode,’ she\ndoes function as a group member but her commitments relative to the\nrespective attitudes are private, i.e., they regard her goals\nqua private person. When she reasons or has attitudes in the\n‘we-mode,’ she functions as a group member and conceives\nof herself as being bound by and committed to what is collectively\naccepted and subject of collective commitment within the group.\nSpelling out the details of this conception—especially the\nnotions of collective acceptance (see Tuomela 2002 and 2007, chap. 6)\nand collective commitment as well as the so-called group ethos (see\nTuomela 2007, chap. 1)—would exceed the scope of the present\ndiscussion. But the contours of the approach should have become clear:\naccording to Tuomela, collective intentionality resides in a specific\nmode of having attitudes, and collective phenomena are individuated in\nterms of complex intentional structures that involve such specific\nattitudes. \nA more general criticism of the content accounts and mode accounts of\ncollective intentionality discussed in this and the previous section\naims at the individualist framework within which they are formulated\n(see, e.g., Baier 1997; Stoutland 1997; Meijers 2003). More\nspecifically, some authors have called for overcoming the\nintentional individualism the most prominent approaches to\ncollective intentionality adopt (cf. Schmid 2009 and Schweikard 2011).\nThis move involves leaving behind the view that all attitudes are\n(reducible to) attitudes by individuals, taken in isolation, and are\nto be verbalized in the ‘I’-form; this does away with the\nproblem of circularity. The alternative here is to acknowledge that\nsome attitudes take a genuine ‘we’-form and are rightly\nattributed to individuals standing in certain social relations. The\npoint of such a non-individualist line is not to posit mysterious\nsupra-individual forces or to undercut the intentional autonomy of\nindividual agents, where these are the worries that seem to motivate\nthe individualistic stance. It is, rather, to treat collective\nintentionality as irreducible with respect to its content and mode,\nand relational with respect to the structures that ground\nindividuals’ reference to plural contents and their\nself-conception as subject-in-relations. A non-individualist account,\naccording to which collective intentionality is irreducible and\nrelational, relies on an analysis of the specific relations\nindividuals are in when they share intentional attitudes with one\nanother. One aspect—whose investigation is still in the early\nstages of development—that helps to further illuminate this is\nthe particular nature of the first person plural indexical\n‘we’ (cf. Gilbert 1989; Nunberg 1993; Pettit 2003; de\nBruin 2009; Schweikard 2011; Schmid 2005). \nThe philosophically intriguing issues in the theory of intentionality\nare not confined to its content and mode but include the question as\nto what sort of entity is or can be a subject of intentionality. This\nis obviously another core question in the theory of collective\nintentionality, one where philosophical analysis meets with the\ninterests of social science and normative theorizing. Does it ever\nmake sense to say that a social group is the subject of, or just has,\nan intention, a belief, or an emotion? Or are such attributions of\nintentionality to groups merely metaphorical shorthand for referring\nto the attitudes of their members (Quinton 1975)? \nSome authors have developed qualified affirmative responses to the\nfirst of these questions and claimed that groups can indeed be\nsubjects (or bearers) of intentional states. One apparently\nstraightforward approach consists in applying the ‘intentional\nstance’ to groups, i.e., in making groups’ status as\nintentional subjects dependent on whether their behavior can be\ninterpreted as intentional (cf. Tollefsen 2002a, 2002b, and 2015). For\ninstance, if I see a number of people trying to pull a car out of a\nditch, I may be warranted in ascribing relevant beliefs and desires to\nthe group, as in “the group wants to move the car back onto the\nroad.” Cases like this one are familiar from everyday parlance,\nin which we often encounter attributions of intentional states to\ncorporations or governments. In this respect, interpretationism has\nthe clear advantage of shedding light on the social practice of\nascribing intentionality to groups, but the view needs to integrate an\naccount of the conditions under which such ascriptions are justified.\nIt just does not seem to be all there is to being a collective subject\nof intentionality that a given group can be viewed as such. What is\nneeded to establish that groups can be subjects of intentional states\nis an elaborate account of their internal structure, i.e., of what\nconstitutes them as proper targets for ascriptions of intentionality.\nTollefsen’s interpretationist account here focuses on the\nrational unity certain groups, such as organizations, are capable of\ndisplaying (see Tollefsen 2002a and 2002b, and Rovane 1998). \nOne influential account along these lines is Margaret Gilbert’s\nplural subject theory (Gilbert 1989, 1990, 1996, 2000, 2006, 2009, and\n2014). Gilbert starts from the basic case of two individuals going for\na walk together. On her account, such an activity requires that they\ntake on what she calls a ‘joint commitment,’ which she\nexplains as  \na kind of commitment of the will. In this case, the wills of two or\nmore people create it, and two or more people are committed by it.\n(Gilbert 2006: 134)  \nA joint commitment can, on this account, only be brought about (or\nrescinded) jointly. A joint commitment of this kind does not require a\n“single centre of consciousness” or a “distinctive\nform of ‘subjectivity’” (2006: 134), it is the\ncommitment precisely of those bound by it. According to Gilbert, each\njoint commitment is a joint commitment to do X as a body, where\nsubstitutions for “X” include “intend”,\n“believe”, “accept”, and so on. A joint\ncommitment to believe something as a body, for instance, is a\ncommitment to constitute as far as possible a single body that\nbelieves that thing, where  \nthe concept of a ‘single body’ is neutral with respect to\nthe question whether the body in question is in some sense composed of\nindividual human beings. (2006:137)  \nGilbert takes this not to imply that the individuals involved are (or\nhave to be) personally committed to the attitude in question, e.g.,\nthat each or any of them believes what they are jointly committed to\nbelieving as a body (cf. Gilbert 2009). However, joint commitments\nthus specified imply a normative relationship between the parties\nthereby committed: if A and B are jointly committed in\nsome way, then each of them is obligated to act accordingly and each\nof them is entitled to demand the other’s conforming action; in\nother words, they owe each other such action (cf. Gilbert 2009). \nGilbert uses this basic structure of joint commitment to define the\ntype of social group she calls ‘plural subject’:  \nA and B […] constitute a plural subject\n(by definition) if and only if they are jointly committed to doing\nsomething as a body—in a broad sense of ‘do’.\n(Gilbert 2006: 145)  \nSuch plural subjects, as a particular sort of social group, can be\nsubjects of intentional states such as intentions, beliefs, and\nacceptance; this is the point at which the account regards the subject\nof collective intentionality. \nA number of criticisms can be put forth against Gilbert’s plural\nsubject theory; although they were voiced at earlier stages of the\ndevelopment of the theory, their target has not decisively been moved.\nThe first critical point to note is familiar from the discussions in\nearlier sections of this entry, as it regards a problem of\ncircularity. Does the formation of a joint commitment not already\npresuppose the sort of joint action by plural subject it is meant to\nbring about? It seems to be crucial to the account that when two\nagents say, for instance, ‘Let’s go to the Taj Mahal\ntogether!’, they unite in virtue of the joint commitment this\ninvolves. But why start precisely there? Couldn’t the two also\nsay, at an earlier point in time, ‘Let’s jointly commit to\ngoing to the Taj Mahal together’? There is an apparent danger of\nregress or indeed of circularity. However, this objection may rely on\na superficial reading of Gilbert’s theory. Already in the first\ncomplete statement of her view (in Gilbert 1989), she elaborated that\nthe formation of a plural subject, or the entering of a joint\ncommitment, is preceded by an open display of ‘readiness’\non the part of the individual agents. So before they actually become\njointly committed to do such-and-such ‘as a body,’\nA and B each indicate that they are ready or willing to\ndo so. This reply by extended narrative is weaker than it might look,\nfor either this means that joint commitments are, as it were,\nput together from personal attitudes of the participants or\nthe respective attitudes instantiate the same sort of circularity that\nwas to be avoided. A possible resort consists in saying that the\nagents themselves do not presuppose the complicated technical\nstructure termed ‘joint commitment’ or ‘plural\nsubject,’ which renders the alleged problem of circularity one\nthat exists only for the theorist. \nA related critical point is that the process through which joint\ncommitments are brought about, in Gilbert’s analysis, already\ninvolves some form of collective intentionality. This seems obvious in\nthe case of explicit communication, as any communication is a joint\naction. But it is also true in those cases in which the agreement is\ntacit rather than explicit, as this implies some form of mutual\nunderstanding between the participants. It seems plausible to assume\nthat mutual understanding, even if it is tacit, is collectively\nintentional. If Gilbert’s claim is that all collective\nintentionality is of the form of a joint commitment, her account of\nthe process through which joint commitments are generated seems to\npresuppose another joint commitment. If individuals already have to be\njointly committed in some way in order to enter into a joint\ncommitment, however, either a vicious circle or an infinite regress\nseems to ensue. A possible solution would be to claim that joint\ncommitments of the sort that Gilbert envisages are a special\nkind of collective intention, and that they presuppose more basic\nforms of collective intentionality, which are not joint commitments of\nthe Gilbertian sort (Schmid 2005). \nA third critique regards the normative internal structure of plural\nsubject, i.e., the claims that the parties to a joint commitment\nassume mutual obligations and entitlements and that this is\ncharacteristic of the basic phenomenon of joint action. In his\ndiscussion of Gilbert’s view, Bratman (1999, chap. 7; 2014,\nchap. 5) rejects the claim that mutual obligations and entitlements\nare constitutive features of joint action. He deems it part of the\nnormal etiology of joint activities that the participants create\nmutual expectations and take on obligations to fulfill them (cf. also\nAlonso 2009, who elaborates a similar point using the concept of\n‘reliance’). But Bratman regards these as consequences\nrather than as constituents of such activities. In support of Gilbert\nit should be clarified that she does not speak of the obligations and\nentitlements in question as moral obligations and\nentitlements, but treats them rather as directed obligations\nand as part of the social relationship between the\nparticipants (cf. Gilbert 2006: 155). \nA fourth criticism of Gilbert’s view targets the scalability of\nthe conception of joint commitment and plural subjects. Gilbert\naffirms this at great length and claims that even political\ncommunities (or societies) can be understood along those lines, thus\narguing for a view of which she takes traditional social contract\ntheory to be one version (cf. Gilbert 2006, part II). The merits of\nsuch a contractualist approach need not be discussed in the present\ncontext, but the underlying claim that one can extrapolate from the\nbasic case of joint action runs into difficulties when it is viewed in\ncombination with Gilbert’s claim that joint commitments cannot\nbe rescinded unilaterally, but only jointly by all of the individuals\nwho undertake it (cf. Gilbert 2009: 182). This feature of the account\nmay seem counterintuitive already in cases of rather spontaneous\nsmall-scale joint actions, such as when I meet a colleague on the way\nto the lecture hall and we fall into walking together for a bit. But\nthe larger the scale, the more implausible this implication becomes.\nAre we to accept, by way of reductio, that one member of a\npolitical community can hold all others to a social contract (Baltzer\n2002)? \nAlthough these critical points might affect the overall reception of\nGilbert’s theory, it surely provides insights concerning some\nfeatures a group is likely to exhibit in order to count as a subject\nof collective intentionality. In particular, its members need to\ncreate a structure that turns the group into an unified entity in the\nsense that it is made the subject of attitudes they together accept\nand are committed to act on. This may, as Hindriks (2008a) notes,\nimply that more is needed than the joint commitment that can be\nexplicated in view of phenomena such as spontaneous joint walks. For\ninstance, the formation of an effective citizens’ movement may\nrequire that the individual agents involved accept the goal of the\njoint enterprise and an internal structure in which roles,\ncompetencies and decision-making mechanisms are defined (see also\nFrench 1984). \nRaimo Tuomela gives a more detailed account of the internal structure\nof what he calls ‘we-groups,’ which he takes to come in\ndifferent varieties, depending on the strength of their members’\nendorsement of and identification with the respective group’s\ngoals (Tuomela 2007, 2013). He draws an analogy between single agents\nand collective agents (cf. 2007: 85–86), thus setting the stage\nfor the study of the intentionality specific to group phenomena.\nTuomela acknowledges that the most familiar collective agents,\norganizations and corporations, require a more detailed internal\nstructure that encompasses the relationships between their members,\nrelationships between the members and the respective collective\nagents, and a number of organizational characteristics. In summary,\nthese features comprise members’ collective acceptance\nof and collective commitment to the group’s goals, a\ndistinction between operative and non-operative group\nmembers, the definition of roles and positions\nwithin the group, and the institution (or even codification) of a\ngroup-internal authority system (see also French 1984 for a\nsimilar view of the structure of groups).—It would not pay out\nat this point to reiterate the reflections on Tuomela’s\nindividualism and we-mode analysis mentioned above; instead, we do\nwell to focus on his specification of the status of such groups. \nTuomela explains that his  \naccount entails that a we-mode group […] is a collective\nartefact and indeed an organized institutional entity […].\nGroup members are viewed as functioning in group positions (be they\ndifferentiated or not). Thus, a we-mode group can indeed be said to\nconsist of such positions. (Tuomela 2007: 20)  \nDespite the emphasis he puts on the organizational features of groups,\nthe following statement testifies to the reductionist social ontology\nTuomela adopts: \nWe are here somewhat metaphorically viewing groups as analogous to\nindividual agents (persons). […] In a nutshell, my view is that\ngroups can but need not be taken as (singular) entities, and they are\nagents and persons only in a metaphorical sense. (Tuomela 2007: 140\nand 145)  \nThus, on this account, the aforementioned analogy between single and\ncollective agents is not to be overstated and used to infer that\ncollectives are agents that are (ontologically) on a par with single\nagents. But they may, even on Tuomela’s account, qualify as\nsubjects of intentional states, even as autonomous (cf. Tuomela 2007:\n234), insofar as they consist in a particular organizational structure\nand are upheld by the respective (we-mode-) attitudes of their\nmembers. \nA third influential ‘subject account’ of collective\nintentionality was propounded by Philip Pettit (2001a,b, 2003, 2009).\nThe theory of group agency Pettit has since expounded jointly with\nChristian List (see List & Pettit 2011) is not specifically\ntailored to this issue, or voiced in the respective terminology; the\nreconstruction in the following thus concentrates on a brief account\nof Pettit’s initial statement of his view, as it is (in argument\nand terminology) more explicitly stated within a framework that\noverlaps with other conceptions of collective intentionality. In\ncontrast to other accounts, Pettit’s does not start from an\nanalysis of joint action or collective intentional states, thus\ntreating the issues of joint agency and group agency as\ndistinguishable (cf. Pettit & Schweikard 2006). Instead, he\napproaches the issue of whether groups can be subjects of (or have)\nintentions directly by asking whether they can fulfill general\nconditions of agency. And he claims that not only can groups fulfill\nsuch conditions, but that such groups fulfill them as collective units\nof agency whose attitudes may be discontinuous with the attitudes of\ntheir members (cf. Pettit 2002 and 2003). \nIn the present context, the latest statement and defense of the entire\nargumentation centered on conditions of agency cannot be taken up (see\nPettit 2007a and List & Pettit 2011, chapters 1–3), the\nfocus will instead be on a partial argument regarding one important\nstep in the larger argumentation. It concerns the question whether\ngroups can be subjects of intention. Here it is: \nFirst premise: there is no intention without a minimum of rationality\non the part of the relevant agent. Second premise: collectives can\ndisplay that minimum of rationality only insofar as they collectivise\nreason, as I shall put it. Conclusion: only groups that collectivise\nreason can properly have intentions. (Pettit 2001b: 241)  \nIn short, the argument supports the view that only those groups\nqualify as subjects of intentions that instantiate a specific kind of\nrationality (see also Tollefsen 2002). In the initial defense of this\nview Pettit refers to consistency, closure, and completeness as\nrequirements of rationality (see Pettit 2001b: 243). By this he means\nthat in order to be rational an entity has to maintain only co-tenable\nattitudes, it forms  \nall those beliefs and intentions, and performs those actions, that are\nrationally required by the things it is rightly said to intend\n(ibid.),  \nand it forms attitudes on all matters relevant to what it can rightly\nbe said to intend. Whether these requirements are really weak enough\nto ground only a ‘minimum of rationality’ is not entirely\nclear. \nIn view of this description of the conditions of rationality it would\nnot seem as though fulfilling them required a complex form of social\norganization. A number of agents, one might say, could simply get\ntogether, jointly pursue a certain goal and decide all relevant\nmatters by majority voting; it might need some organizational\nstructure, depending on the size of the group, but the aforementioned\nconditions of rationality should be satisfiable in this way. Pettit\nrejects this view on the basis of observations about schemes of\nmajority voting that were first, under the label “doctrinal\nparadox,” noted in jurisprudence, then generalized under the\nlabel of the “discursive dilemma” and became the starting\npoint for the ‘theory of judgment aggregation’ (cf.\nKornhauser 1992; Pettit 2003; List 2012). The central tenet of these\ndebates is that there is no principled way of securing that\naggregations of consistent sets of votes on interconnected issues are\nthemselves consistent. \nAccording to a main lesson from the discursive dilemma, a group that\nis to count as a subject of intentional states has to implement an\ninternal structure and in particular a mechanism for decision-making.\nIf it is to fulfill the requirements initially given by Pettit, it is\n“forced to collectivize reason” (Pettit 2001a: 110). This\nagain means that it has to ensure that the majority votes, which are\neach treated as the group’s view on the respective question,\nform a consistent set of attitudes, even if that implies reconsidering\npast or constraining future judgments. So the group has to monitor its\nattitudes or it may institute a straw vote procedure, which\nfacilitates joint awareness of and deliberation about the\ngroup’s views (cf. Pettit 2007a). In the case described above,\nthe only satisfactory strategy, Pettit holds, would consist in\ntreating the majority votes regarding p and q as\nauthoritative, embrace the logical implication and affirm\n>p&q< (cf. Pettit 2001b: 247). In this way,\nthe group could meet the requirements of rationality.—This\nconcludes Pettit’s (early) analysis of the conditions under\nwhich groups can count as subjects of intentional states. It targets\nprimarily the processes of group-internal reflection and\ndecision-making. \nTo conclude this section, it bears mentioning that there is an\nimportant but often neglected alternative to studying the\nsubject-aspect of collective intentionality with respect to social\ngroups only. According to this alternative, the subject of\nintentionality does not have to be a ‘rational unity’ of\nagents (cf. Rovane 1998; Tollefsen 2002; Pettit 2003). Instead, a\nconception of collective intentionality can be open to the view that\ntwo or more individuals jointly form the subject of their collective\nintentional attitudes (cf. Smith 2011). At this systematic juncture,\nthe ontological commitment of an account that specifies the nature of\nthe subject of collective intentionality takes center stage. Here\nagain the crucial questions—and the structure is familiar from\nthe discussion of the other two issues of collectivity—are\nwhether what one wants to call the subject of an intentional attitude\nis irreducible, whether reference to such collective subjects is\nmerely metaphorical, or whether this particular kind of subjecthood\ncan be instantiated by two or more agents jointly. \nWhereas the focus of the discussion about collective intentionality is\nmostly within the domain of the philosophy of mind and action, a\nseries of neighboring philosophical disciplines and social sciences\nare highly pertinent to this topic. \nThe interest in the nature of social reality as well as in the\nstructure and normativity of social practices and institutions had\nbeen part of philosophical debates long before the incipience of\nspecific debates about collective intentionality. But by now it seems\nclear that analyses of collective intentionality provide significant\ncontributions to the study of social phenomena, and that they form an\nimportant part of the main projects of social ontology (for an\noverview see Hindriks 2018). \nTake the example of money (see Searle 1995: 1): there is an enormous\npractical difference between a blank piece of paper and a five dollar\nbill, but what does this difference consist in? To this some authors,\nincluding Searle (1995, 2010) and Tuomela (2002), have replied that\nthe existence of money depends at least partly on collective\nintentional attitudes, or on a shared practice of treating certain\npieces of paper, and not others, as money. This mechanism, which\naccording to Searle (2010) involves the imposition of status functions\nand specific deontic structures, generalizes to the way communities\ncreate and maintain social institutions, to public offices,\nconventions and cultural sites (such as the Taj Mahal); collective\nattitudes such as collective acceptance seem to play an ineliminable\nrole in the constitution of such social and institutional facts. The\nprecise structure of collective acceptance, however, is not all that\nclear. While it is meant to play the role of both creating and\nmaintaining institutional facts—it is by way of collective\nacceptance that we say that such-and-such is (or counts as) money and\nit is by way of collective acceptance that we acknowledge of\nsuch-and-such that it is (or counts as) money—, it is not easy\nto see how an attitude, whether collective or not, can fulfill these\ntwo functions with opposing directions-of-fit (see Laitinen 2014). \nRegardless of these details, integrating a conception of collective\nintentionality into the study of collective phenomena, which encompass\ninstitutional phenomena, is promising for the following very\nfundamental reason. The central concern of the theory of\nintentionality is to grasp the unity of, or the interaction\nbetween, the natural and the mental. The central concern of the theory\nof collective intentionality is to grasp the connections and\ninteractions between the mental and the social. And this is how the\ntheory of collective intentionality can be viewed as part of an\nencompassing ontological project. \nOn a more confined terrain, the theory of collective intentionality\nraises and contributes to elaborating on a number of specific issues\nin social ontology. As noted in the previous subsection, the theory of\ngroup agency—including the issue of whether collective entities\ncan count as subjects of intentional states—poses questions\nabout the ontological status of groups and group agents, and it\ninvites reiterations of familiar discussions about reduction,\nsupervenience, constitution, and composition (and more). But the\ntheory of joint action, especially if it is viewed as involving\nquestions about the specific relations between cooperators or\nco-agents, already raises issues regarding the social identity of\npersons. And once intersubjective relations are cast against the\nbackground of joint projects and shared practices, the study of\ncollective intentionality enters a direct exchange with the analysis\nof recognition and recognitive attitudes (cf. Ikäheimo &\nLaitinen (eds.) 2011). \nThe debates about collective responsibility began at least six decades\nago and by now constitute a distinct field of research in moral,\npolitical, and legal philosophy (cf. the entry on collective\nresponsibility). Accounts of collective intentionality, of joint\naction and group agency, can contribute to clarifying the conceptual,\naction-theoretic and ontological foundations of the phenomena in\nquestion (cf. May & Tuomela (eds.) 2007). Indeed, some influential\ncontributions to the study of social phenomena stem from debates about\ncollective responsibility and they proved to be important points of\nreference in discussions about collective intentionality (cf., e.g.,\nCopp 1979, 1980; French 1979, 1984; see also May & Hoffman (eds.)\n1991 and Barzagan-Forward & Tollefsen (eds.) 2020). \nThe closest systematic connection between these two fields regards the\npreconditions of (ascriptions of) responsibility. Assuming, more or\nless uncontroversially, that there is no responsibility without\nagency, intentionality, freedom, or autonomy on the part of the entity\nto whom responsibility is ascribed or who is held accountable, an\naccount of collective responsibility will have to include conceptions\nof collective agency, collective intentionality, collective freedom,\nand/or collective autonomy (see, e.g., Hindriks 2008b, Smiley 2018).\nIn analogy to the now widely accepted differentiations between joint\naction and group agency, one may also ask under what conditions a\nnumber of agents, who do not form or belong to an organized group, can\nbe jointly responsible for an action they performed jointly, for an\nevent they brought about through the joint action, or for events that\noccurred as a consequence of a joint omission (cf. Petersson\n2008). \nAs with the most discussed issues in the theory of collective\nintentionality, there is a fundamental divide between individualist\nand non-individualist (or collectivist) conceptions of collective\nresponsibility (cf. May 1992; Miller & Makela 2005; Miller 2006).\nThe former hold that only individual agents or natural persons can be\nproperly held responsible, while the latter hold that some collectives\ndo count as subjects of responsibility (cf. Mathiesen 2006; Pettit\n2007b; Hindriks 2009); depending on context and group size, there may\nbe a number of tenable intermediate positions on this spectrum. In any\ncase, it seems plausible to assume that one’s account of\ncollective responsibility should not be starkly discontinuous with\none’s account of collective agency. And it seems hardly\nspectacular to assume that a differentiated account of collective\nintentionality can inform a differentiated account of collective\nresponsibility. Systematically minded social philosophers are called\nupon to take up these challenges. \nCoordination is a basic social phenomenon. It comes into play when\nthere are two or more agents each of which has two or more options\nwhich are known to the agents to be interdependent in such a way that\nit does not matter so much to any individual participant which option\nis chosen, just as long as all agents converge on one option.\nCoordination usually involves conventions. Driving on the right side\nmay not per se be seen as preferable to driving on the left\nside, but all rational participants in motorized traffic easily agree\nthat there needs to be some convention here, and observe it in\npractice. If in situations of pure coordination (with no conflict of\ninterest) there is a convention, it seems natural to say that it is\nrational for the participants to act accordingly. \nSurprisingly, classical game theory fails to support this intuition.\nFrom a classical game theoretical point of view, the fact that the\nright side traffic rule is common knowledge between agents does not\nmake it rational to act accordingly. All that can be said is that it\nis rational for A to stick to the convention if A\nexpects the other to stick to the convention, too. However, the\nsame holds true for a violation of the convention. If A\nexpects B to violate the convention, it is rational for\nhim to do likewise in order to avoid a collision. As there is common\nknowledge of rationality, however, A knows that B will\nstick to the convention only if he or she expects A to do\nlikewise. Thus the condition cannot be settled, and the assertoric\njudgment that it is better to stick to the convention cannot be\nderived from the hypothetical judgment that this is the thing to do if\nthe other does so as well. As the rational choice, classical game\ntheory recommends a mixed strategy in such situations, which is\nremarkably bad advice for real life, and luckily descriptively\ninadequate. \nOne might think that rational coordination is made easier for the\nagents posited in game theoretic models if deviation from the\nconvention is sanctioned (e.g., by fines inflicted on those drivers\nwhich violate the traffic rule). In that case, there is typically one\ncoordination equilibrium which is better for both, and another\ncoordination equilibrium which is worse for both, but still better as\nfailures to coordinate. Yet this does surprisingly little to change\nthe situation from a classical game-theoretic point of view. In fact,\nthis shifts the recommended mixed strategy somewhat into the direction\nof more frequent selection of violation of the convention. \nA series of authors have argued that this reveals a fundamental flaw\nin the game-theoretic setting, and appeals to collective\nintentionality have persistently been made in this context. The idea\nis that agents may choose from a joint perspective; they do not\nconsider what’s best for them, individually, given the\nother’s expected choice, but look at such situations with an eye\non what’s best for them, jointly. One way of putting\nthis is to say that the failure of the classical model is to assume an\nidentity of the chooser that is fixed on the individual rather than\nseeing the identity of the chooser as variable. Michael Bacharach\n(2006), Robert Sugden (1993, 2000) and Martin Hollis (1998) have\ndeveloped corresponding accounts. In contrast to the\nliterature on collective intentionality, these accounts focus on ways\nof reasoning rather than forms of intention, or mental attitudes.\nHowever, these approaches can be seen as complementary to each other\n(Hakli, Miller & Tuomela 2010; see also Petersson 2016). Gold and\nSugden (2007) criticize Tuomela’s, Bratman’s,\nSearle’s and Gilbert’s accounts of collective\nintentionality, arguing that focusing on mental states or attitudes\nrather than modes of reasoning makes it impossible to see what is\ngenuinely collective about collective intentions. In their view,\ncollective intentions are the product of we-reasoning—a view\nthat is challenged by the phenomenon of spontaneous joint intentions,\nand perhaps by the circularity problem that team reasoning already\nsupposes some sense of doing something together. \nCollective or shared intentionality has been assigned a prominent role\nin recent research in evolutionary anthropology and developmental\npsychology. Michael Tomasello and his collaborators have suggested\nthat our capacity for shared intentionality is the most basic\ndifference between humans and other primates. The evidence quoted for\nthis claim is that while other primates seem to be apt strategic\nreasoners with an impressively well developed sense of what other\nindividuals perceive and want, the propensity to joint attention and\nthe inclination to cooperation even where this does not immediately\nserve one’s own purposes is uniquely human. Tomasello argues\nthat this basic cooperative-mindedness expresses a specifically human\ncapacity for shared intentionality (Tomasello & Racokzy 2003).\nIt is only on this base that other distinctively human capacities,\nsuch as the capacity for language and morality, can develop (Tomasello\n2009, 2016). Tomasello refers to Searle’s, Gilbert’s and\nBratman’s accounts, but remains largely noncommittal as to the\nquestion of what exactly the conception of shared intention he has in\nmind amounts to (Schmid 2012). However, his conception suggests that a\nSearlean version may be the basic form of shared intention, and that a\nnormatively stabilized conception of collective intentionality as\ndeveloped by Gilbert may be adequate for the forms of shared intention\ncoming a later stage in development. If Tomasello is right in claiming\nthat the basic capacity for shared intention precedes the development\nof a full theory of mind, this places tight conceptual restriction on\nan adequate analysis of basic shared intention, this seems to rule out\nthe common knowledge-condition that is implied even in Searle’s\n(2010) account.","contact.mail":"Hans-Bernhard.Schmid@unibas.ch","contact.domain":"unibas.ch"}]
