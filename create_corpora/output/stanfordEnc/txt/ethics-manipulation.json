Irving has tried unsuccessfully to provide\nTonya with reasons for doing X rather than Y. If Irving\nis unwilling to resort to coercion or force, he might deploy any of\nthe following tactics to try to influence Tonya’s choice. For\nexample, Irving might …\n\n Charm Tonya into wanting to please Irving by doing\nX.\n\n Exaggerate the advantages of doing X and the\ndisadvantages of doing Y, and/or understate the disadvantages\nof doing X and the advantages of doing Y.\n\n Make Tonya feel guilty for preferring to do\nY.\n\n Induce Tonya into an emotional state that makes\ndoing X seem more appropriate than it really is.\n\n Point out that doing Y will make Tonya seem\nless worthy and appealing to her friends.\n\n Make Tonya feel badly about herself and portray\nY as a choice that will confirm or exacerbate this feeling,\nand/or portray X as a choice that will disconfirm or combat\nit.\n\n Do a small favor for Tonya before asking her to do\nX, so that she feels obligated to comply.\n\n Make Tonya doubt her own judgment so that she will\nrely on Irving’s advice to do X.\n\n Make it clear to Tonya that if she does Y\nrather than X, Irving will withdraw his friendship, sulk, or\nbecome irritable and generally unpleasant.\n\n Focus Tonya’s attention on some aspect of\ndoing Y that Tonya fears and ramp up that fear to get her to\nchange her mind about doing Y.\n\nEach of these tactics could reasonably be called a form of manipulation.\nMany also have more specific, commonplace names, such as “guilt\ntrip” (tactic 3), “gaslighting” (tactic 8),\n“peer pressure” (tactic 5), “negging” (tactic\n6), and “emotional blackmail” (tactic 9). Perhaps not\neveryone will agree that every tactic on this list is\nproperly described as manipulation. And in some cases, whether the\ntactic seems manipulative may depend on various details not specified\nin the case as described. For example, if Y is seriously\nimmoral, then perhaps it is not manipulative for Irving to induce\nTonya to feel guilty about planning to do Y. It is also\npossible that we might revise our judgments about some of these\ntactics in light of a fully worked out and well supported theory of\nmanipulation—if we had one. Nevertheless, this list should\nprovide a reasonably good sense of what we mean by\n“manipulation” in the present context. It should also\nserve to illustrate the wide variety of tactics commonly described as\nmanipulation.\n\n\nManipulation is often characterized as a form of influence that is\nneither coercion nor rational persuasion. But this characterization\nimmediately raises the question: Is every form of influence\nthat is neither coercion nor rational persuasion a form of\nmanipulation? If manipulation does not occupy the entire logical space\nof influences that are neither rational persuasion nor coercion, then\nwhat distinguishes it from other forms of influence that are neither\ncoercion nor rational persuasion?\n\n\nThe term “manipulation” is commonly thought to include an\nelement of moral disapprobation: To say that Irving manipulated Tonya\nis commonly taken to be a moral criticism of Irving’s behavior.\nIs manipulation always immoral? Why is manipulation immoral\n(when it is immoral)? If manipulation is not always immoral, then what\ndetermines when it is immoral?\n\n\n\n\nForms of influence like those listed above are commonplace in ordinary\nlife. This distinguishes them from forms of influence described as\n“manipulation” in the free will literature. There, the\nterm “manipulation” typically refers to radical\nprogramming or reprogramming of all or most of an agent’s\nbeliefs, desires, and other mental states. Such global manipulation\n(as we might call it) is also typically imagined as happening via\ndecidedly extra-ordinary methods, such as supernatural intervention,\ndirect neurological engineering, or radical programs of indoctrination\nand psychological conditioning. Global manipulation is typically\nthought to deprive its victim of free will. This common intuition\ndrives the “manipulation argument”, which seeks to defend\nincompatibilism by claiming that living in a deterministic universe is\nanalogous to having been the victim of global manipulation. (For a\ndetailed discussion of this argument, see the discussion of manipulation\narguments in the entry on \n arguments for incompatibilism.) \nDespite the differences between ordinary manipulation and the forms of\nmanipulation in the free will literature, it is still worth wondering\nabout the relationship between them. If global manipulation completely\ndeprives its victim of free will or autonomy, might more ordinary\nforms of manipulation do something similar, but on a more limited\nscale? If Tonya succumbs to one of Irving’s tactics, should we\nregard her as being less free—and perhaps less\nresponsible—for doing X? So far, few people have explored\nthe connections between ordinary manipulation and the forms of global\nmanipulation discussed in the free will literature. (Two exceptions\nare Long 2014 and Todd 2013).  \nUntil recently, manipulation has seldom been the subject of\nphilosophical inquiry in its own right. However, the fact that\nmanipulation is commonly thought to undermine the validity of consent\nhas led to its frequent mention in areas where the validity of consent\nis at issue. \nOne such area is medical ethics, where proposed conditions for\nautonomous informed consent often reference the need to ensure that\nconsent is not manipulated. In fact, one of the earliest sustained\nphilosophical discussions of manipulation appears in Ruth Faden, Tom\nBeauchamp, and Nancy King’s influential book, A History and\nTheory of Informed Consent (1986). The view that manipulation\nundermines the validity of consent is widely held among medical\nethicists. However, there is far less agreement about how to determine\nwhether a given form of influence is manipulative. Nowhere is this\nlack of agreement more apparent than in recent discussions of\n“nudges”.  \nThe concept of a nudge was introduced by Cass Sunstein and Richard\nThaler to refer to the deliberate introduction of subtle, non-coercive\ninfluences into people’s decision-making to get them to make\nmore optimal choices (Thaler & Sunstein 2009; Sunstein 2014). Some\nnudges merely provide better and more comprehensible information;\nthese nudges seem best characterized as influences that improve the\nquality of rational deliberation. But other nudges operate by\npsychological mechanisms whose relationship to rational\ndeliberation is questionable at best. Many of these nudges exploit\nheuristics, reasoning and decision-making biases, and other\npsychological processes that operate outside of conscious awareness.\nFor example, some evidence suggests that patients are more likely to\nchoose an operation if they are told that it has a 90% survival rate\nrather than a 10% fatality rate. Would it be manipulative for a\nsurgeon to exploit this framing effect to nudge the patient into\nmaking the decision that the surgeon thinks best? Is it manipulative\nfor a cafeteria manager to place healthier food items at eye level to\nnudge customers into choosing them? The question of whether and when\nnudges manipulate has sparked a lively debate.  \nSome defenders of nudges suggest that because it is often impossible\nto frame a decision without pointing the decision-maker in\nsome direction, there is nothing manipulative about framing\nsuch decisions in one way rather than another. For example, physicians\nmust provide outcome information either in terms of fatality rate or\nsurvival rate (and if they give both, they must give one first), and\ncafeteria managers must choose something to put at eye level in the\ndisplays. This being the case, why think that deliberately choosing\none way of framing the decision over another is manipulative? Some\ndefenders of nudges suggest that in cases where it is inevitable to\nintroduce a non-rational influence into decision-making, deliberately\ndoing so is not manipulative. But there are reasons to be wary of this\nline of thought. Suppose that Jones is traveling to a job interview on\na subway car so crowded that it is inevitable that he will bump up\nagainst his fellow passengers.  Suppose that he capitalizes on this\nfact to deliberately bump his rival job candidate (who is on the same\nsubway car) out the door just as it closes, thus ensuring that he will\nbe late for his interview. Clearly the fact that some bumping on\nJones’s part was inevitable does not excuse Jones’s\nintentional bumping of his rival. Similarly, even if we inevitably\nintroduce non-rational influences into each other’s\ndecision-making, that fact seems insufficient to prove that such\ninfluences can never be manipulative. No doubt this analogy is\nimperfect, but it should suffice to call into question the assumption\nthat a deliberate nudge is not manipulative simply because some\nnudging is inevitable. \nMore nuanced discussions of whether nudges manipulate tend to focus\nless on the inevitability of nudging in some direction or another, and\nmore on the mechanisms by which the nudging occurs, and the direction\nin which it pushes the person being nudged. Although there is wide\nagreement that some nudges can be manipulative, so far no consensus\nhas emerged about which nudges are manipulative or how to distinguish\nmanipulative from non-manipulative nudges. (For a sample of approaches\nto the question of whether and when nudges manipulate, see\nBlumenthal-Barby 2012; Blumenthal-Barby & Burroughs 2012; Saghai\n2013; Wilkinson 2013; Hanna 2015; Moles 2015; Nys & Engelen 2017;\nand Noggle 2017. For arguments that nudges can be sometimes morally\njustified even when they are manipulative, see Wilkinson 2017 and Nys\n& Engelen 2017). \nQuestions about the legitimacy of nudges go beyond the medical\ncontext. Thaler and Sunstein advocate their use by government,\nemployers, and other institutions besides the health care industry.\nThe use of nudges by government raises additional concerns, especially\nabout the paternalism behind them (Arneson 2015; White 2013).\nQuestions about other forms of manipulation in the political sphere\nhave also been raised by philosophers and political theorists. The\nidea that political leaders might gain, retain, or consolidate\npolitical power by means that we would now call manipulative can be\ntraced back at least as far back as ancient Greek figures like\nCallicles and Thrasymachus. Niccolo Machiavelli not only details but\nrecommends political tactics that we would likely regard as\nmanipulative. More recent philosophical work on political manipulation\nincludes Robert Goodin’s 1980 book on Manipulatory\nPolitics and Claudia Mills’s important paper,\n“Politics and Manipulation” (1995). \nIn the field of business ethics, much philosophical attention has been\nfocused on the question of whether advertising is manipulative. The\neconomist John Kenneth Galbraith famously called advertising\n“the manipulation of consumer desire” and compared being\nthe target of advertising with being  \nassailed by demons which instilled in him a passion sometimes for silk\nshirts, sometimes for kitchenware, sometimes for chamber pots, and\nsometimes for orange squash. (Galbraith 1958)  \nSeveral philosophers have made similar criticisms of advertising.\nOften, these criticisms are limited to forms of advertising that do\nnot simply convey accurate factual information. As is the case with\npurely informational nudges, it seems difficult to claim that\nadvertising that does nothing more than convey accurate factual\ninformation is manipulative. However, most advertising attempts to\ninfluence consumer behavior by means other than or in addition to\npurely providing accurate information. Such non-informational\nadvertising is the most apt target for worries about manipulation. Tom\nBeauchamp and Roger Crisp have made influential arguments that such\nadvertising can be manipulative (Beauchamp 1984; Crisp 1987). Similar\ncriticisms claim that non-informational advertising can subvert\nautonomy or improperly tamper with consumers’ desires (e.g.,\nSantilli 1983). Such critiques are either versions of or close\nrelatives to critiques of advertising as manipulation. On the other\nside, Robert Arrington argues that, as a matter of fact, advertising\nvery seldom manipulates its audience or undermines its\naudience’s autonomy (Arrington 1982). Michael Phillips has\nmarshalled a large body of empirical evidence to argue that while some\nadvertising is manipulative, its critics vastly overestimate its power\nto influence consumers (Phillips 1997). \nAs will be apparent from our discussion so far, two main questions\nneed to be answered about manipulation. A satisfactory theory of\nmanipulation should answer both of them.  \nOne question—call it the identification\nquestion—concerns definition and identification: How can we\nidentify which forms of influence are manipulative and which are not?\nA satisfactory answer would presumably involve a general definition of\nmanipulation, which explains what the diverse forms of manipulative\ninfluence have in common. In addition to illuminating how the various\ninstances of manipulation are manifestations of a single more basic\nphenomenon, an answer to the identification question should also provide\ncriteria for determining whether a given instance of influence is\nmanipulative. Such an analysis might, of course, show that some of the\nphenomena that we were pre-theoretically inclined to count as\nmanipulation are relevantly different from clear cases of\nmanipulation, so that we might be led to revise our usage of the term\n“manipulation”, at least in contexts where precision is\nimportant. \nA second question—call it the evaluation\nquestion—concerns morality: How should we evaluate the\nmoral status of manipulation? A satisfactory answer to this question\nshould tell us whether manipulation is always immoral. And if\nmanipulation is not always immoral, a satisfactory answer to the\nevaluation question should tell us how to determine when manipulation\nis immoral. But more importantly, a satisfactory answer to the\nevaluation question should explain why manipulation is\nimmoral when it is immoral. What feature of manipulation makes it\nimmoral in those situations when it is immoral? \nAlthough the identification and evaluation questions are distinct,\nthey are not entirely independent. Any analysis of why manipulation is\nimmoral (when it is immoral) will presuppose some account of what\nmanipulation is. Thus, our answer to the identification question will\nconstrain our answer to the evaluation question. But an answer to the\nidentification question might do more than constrain our\nanswer to the evaluation question: it might also guide it. If\nan account of manipulation identifies its underlying characteristic as\nbeing relevantly similar to some other thing that we have independent\ngrounds for regarding as morally wrong, then we would likely want to\nargue that manipulation is wrong for similar reasons. Finally, we\nmight need to adjust our answers to one or both questions if they\ntogether imply implausible consequences. For example, if we define\nmanipulation as every form of influence besides rational persuasion or\ncoercion, and then claim that the wrongness of manipulation is\nabsolute, we will be forced to conclude that no form of influence\nbesides rational persuasion is ever morally legitimate. This is a\nradical conclusion that few would be willing to accept, but it is a\nconclusion that results from combining a certain answer to the\nidentification question with a certain answer to the evaluation\nquestion. \nCurrently, there are three main characterizations of manipulation on\noffer in the literature: One treats manipulation as an influence that\nundermines or bypasses rational deliberation. A second treats it as a\nform of pressure. A third treats it as a form of trickery. \nManipulation is often said to “bypass”,\n“undermine”, or “subvert” the target’s\nrational deliberation. It is not always clear, however, whether this\nclaim is meant as a definition of manipulation or merely as a\nstatement about manipulation (perhaps one that partly explains its\nmoral status). But let us consider whether the idea that manipulation\nbypasses reason can serve as a definition of manipulation.  \nThe thought that manipulative influences bypass the target’s\ncapacity for rational deliberation is appealing for at least two\nreasons. First, it seems reasonable to think that because manipulation\ndiffers from rational persuasion, it must influence behavior by means\nthat do not engage the target’s rational capacities. Second, it\nseems intuitive to describe forms of influence that do clearly bypass the\ntarget’s capacity for rational deliberation as manipulative. For\nexample, suppose that subliminal advertising worked in the way that it\nis commonly—though probably inaccurately—portrayed, so\nthat being exposed to a subliminal message urging you to “Drink\nCoke” could influence your behavior without engaging your\nmechanisms of rational deliberation. Intuitively such an influence\nwould seem to be a clear case of manipulation.  \nSubliminal advertising tactics—along with hypnosis and\nbehavioral conditioning—are commonly portrayed as effective\nmethods to influence others without their knowledge and thus without\nengaging their capacities for rational deliberation. The effectiveness\nof such tactics is almost certainly wildly exaggerated in the popular\n(and sometimes philosophical) imagination.  However, but if we imagine\nthem working as well as they are sometimes portrayed, then they would\nconstitute clear examples of what it might mean to say that\nmanipulation bypasses reason. Thus, we might understand manipulation\nin terms of bypassing rational deliberation, and understand\n“bypassing rational deliberation” in terms of exploiting\npsychological mechanisms or techniques that can generate behavior\nwithout any input from rational deliberation.  \nHowever, this approach faces a serious problem. If we define\nmanipulation in terms of bypassing rational deliberation, and then use\nexaggerated portrayals of hypnosis and subliminal advertising to\nillustrate what it means to bypass rational deliberation, we will set\na very high bar for something to count as manipulation. This bar would\nbe too high to count any of Irving’s tactics as manipulation,\nsince none of them completely bypasses Tonya’s capacity for\nrational deliberation in the way that subliminal advertising,\nhypnosis, or conditioning are commonly portrayed as doing. In fact, as\nMoti Gorin observes, manipulation often involves tactics that rely\non the rational capacities of the target (Gorin 2014a). This is\ncertainly true of the tactics that Irving uses to influence Tonya in\nthe examples above: they all seem better described as ways of\ninfluencing Tonya’s deliberation than bypassing it. \nPerhaps we might characterize manipulation not in terms of bypassing\ndeliberation altogether, but in terms of bypassing rational\ndeliberation, that is, by introducing non-rational influences into the\ndeliberative process. Thus, we might follow Joseph Raz in claiming\nthat  \nmanipulation, unlike coercion, does not interfere with a\nperson’s options. Instead it perverts the way that person\nreaches decisions, forms preference, or adopts goals. (Raz 1988: 377)\n \nTreating manipulation as bypassing rational deliberation, and\nthen characterizing “bypassing rational deliberation” in\nterms of introducing non-rational influences into deliberation, would\ncohere nicely with the observation that manipulation is a contrary of\nrational persuasion. Moreover, characterizing “bypassing\nrational deliberation” in this way would lower the bar for an\ninfluence to count as manipulative.  \nHowever, now we should worry about the bar being set too low. For many\nforms of non-rational influence do not seem to be manipulative. For\nexample, graphic portrayals of the dangers of smoking or texting while\ndriving are not obviously manipulative even when they impart no new\ninformation to the target (Blumenthal-Barby 2012). In addition, moral\npersuasion often involves non-rational influence. Appeals to the\nGolden Rule invite the interlocutor to imagine how it would\nfeel to be on the receiving end of the action under\nconsideration. It is difficult to believe that all such appeals are\ninherently manipulative, even when they appeal more to the feelings\nthan to facts (of which the interlocutor may already be aware).\nFinally, consider something as innocuous as dressing up before going\non a date or an interview. Presumably, the purpose of such\n“impression management” is to convey a certain impression\nto the audience. Yet dressing up on a single occasion provides little\nif any rational basis for conclusions about what the\nwell-dressed person is really like day in and day out. Thus,\nimpression management of this sort seems to be an attempt at\nnon-rational influence. Yet it seems odd to count it as\nmanipulation—especially if we treat “manipulation”\nas having a connotation of being immoral. Of course, we might avoid\nthis problem by defining “manipulation” in a morally\nneutral way, and then claiming that these forms of manipulation are\nnot immoral, while others are. But this would merely move the problem\nwithout solving it, for now we would want to know what distinguishes\nimmoral forms of manipulation from those that are not immoral.  \nPerhaps we could address this problem by defining reason more broadly,\nso that appeals to emotions could count as forms of rational\npersuasion. Such a move might be independently motivated by the\nrejection of what some critics regard as the hyper-cognitivist radical\nseparation of reason from emotion. However, it is not clear that\nallowing emotional appeals to count as rational persuasion will get us\nvery far in defining manipulation in terms of bypassing reason. For\nwhile we will have avoided the implausible implication that all\nappeals to emotion are ipso facto manipulative, we now face the\nquestion of which appeals to emotion are manipulative and which are\nnot. And that is close to the very question that the idea of bypassing\nreason was supposed to help us answer. \nThus, despite the plausibility of the claim that manipulation bypasses\nthe target’s capacities for rational deliberation, using this\nclaim to define manipulation faces serious challenges: If we\ntake “bypassing” very literally, then the account seems to\nmiss many examples of genuine manipulation. But if we loosen our\nunderstanding of “bypassing reason” so that it applies to\nany non-rational form of influence, then it seems to count as\nmanipulative many forms of influence that do not seem manipulative.\nAnd if we fix that problem by adopting a conception of reason\naccording to which appeals to the emotions are not ipso facto\nnon-rational, then we are left with the original problem of\ndetermining which appeals to the emotions are manipulative and which\nare not. Perhaps there is a way to characterize “bypassing\nreason” that can undergird a plausible definition of\nmanipulation in terms of bypassing reason. But the most obvious ways\nto define “bypassing reason” appear to be dead ends, and\nno other suggestions are currently on offer.  \nNevertheless, even if defining manipulation in terms of bypassing\nreason turns out to be a dead end, it is still possible that\nmanipulation really does bypass reason in some sense. But it\nmay turn out that we need an independent definition of manipulation\nbefore we can determine in what sense manipulation bypasses\nreason. Some writers, such as Cass Sunstein and Jason Hanna, seem to\nhave such an approach in mind when they initially characterize\nmanipulation in terms of bypassing or subverting reason, but then go\non to gloss “bypassing or subverting” in terms of some\nother account of manipulation (Sunstein 2016: 82–89; Hanna\n2015).  \nHowever, a recent argument by Moti Gorin raises questions for the\nclaim that manipulation bypasses or subverts reason—even when\nthat claim is not being used to define what manipulation is (Gorin\n2014a). Gorin argues that manipulation can occur even when the target\nis offered only good reasons. His argument turns largely on examples\nlike this: James wishes for Jacques’s death, since this would\nenable James to inherit a large fortune. James knows that Jacques\nbelieves that (1) God exists, and that (2) if God did not exist, life\nwould be meaningless, and he would have no reason to go on living.\nJames provides Jacques with rational arguments against the existence\nof God. These arguments fully engage Jacques’s rational\nfaculties, and consequently Jacques concludes that God does not exist.\nJacques promptly commits suicide—just as Jack had hoped he\nwould. As Gorin notes, James’s activities do not appear to have\nbypassed, subverted, or otherwise been detrimental to Jacques’s\ncapacity for reason—indeed, James depended on Jacques’s\nability to employ his rational faculties to draw (what James regarded\nas) the correct conclusion from his arguments. If we accept\nGorin’s characterization of James’s actions as\nmanipulative, then his example poses a significant challenge to the\nclaim that manipulation always bypasses the target’s capacity\nfor rational deliberation. \nA second approach to manipulation treats it as a form of trickery, and\nties it conceptually to deception. The connection between manipulation\nand deception is a common theme in both non-philosophical and\nphilosophical discussions of manipulation. In the literature on\nadvertising, for example, the charge that (at least some) advertising\nis manipulative often rests on the claim that it creates false beliefs\nor misleading associations (e.g., linking the vitality of the Marlboro\nman to a product which causes lung cancer). Similarly, in his\ndiscussion of promises, T. M. Scanlon condemns manipulation as a means\nof inducing false beliefs and expectations (Scanlon 1998:\n298–322). Shlomo Cohen offers a somewhat different account of\nthe relationship between manipulation, according to which the\ndistinction lies in the methods by which the target is induced to\nadopt a false belief (Cohen forthcoming). But even on this more\nnuanced view, there is still a strong connection between manipulation\nand deception.  \nAlthough some versions of the trickery view simply treat manipulation\nas being like deception in that both induce false beliefs and leave it\nat that, more expansive versions of the view treat manipulation as a\nmuch broader category of which deception is a special case. Whereas\ndeception is the deliberate attempt to trick someone into adopting a\nfaulty belief, more expansive versions of the trickery account see\nmanipulation as the deliberate attempt to trick someone into adopting\nany faulty mental state—belief, desire, emotion, etc.  \nAn early example of this more expansive trickery-based approach to\nmanipulation can be found in a 1980 paper by Vance Kasten, who writes\nthat  \nmanipulation occurs when there is a difference in kind between what\none intends to do and what one actually does, when that difference is\ntraceable to another in such a way that the victim may be said to have\nbeen misled. (Kasten 1980: 54)  \nAlthough many of Kasten’s examples of misleading involve some\nform of deception, he includes examples in which manipulation involves\ninducing the target to have inappropriate emotions like guilt. More\nrecently, Robert Noggle has defended a version of this more expansive\napproach, writing that  \nThere are certain norms or ideals that govern beliefs, desires, and\nemotions. Manipulative action is the attempt to get someone’s\nbeliefs, desires, or emotions to violate these norms, to fall short of\nthese ideals. (Noggle 1996: 44)  \nIn a similar vein, Anne Barnhill writes that  \nmanipulation is directly influencing someone’s beliefs, desires,\nor emotions such that she falls short of ideals for belief, desire, or\nemotion in ways typically not in her self-interest or likely not\nin her self-interest in the present context. (Barnhill 2014: 73,\nemphasis original; for a similar view, see Hanna 2015)  \nClaudia Mills offers a theory that can be considered as either a\nversion of, or a close relative to, the trickery account: \nWe might say, then, that manipulation in some way purports to be\noffering good reasons, when in fact it does not. A manipulator tries\nto change another’s beliefs and desires by offering her bad\nreasons, disguised as good, or faulty arguments, disguised as\nsound—where the manipulator himself knows these to be bad\nreasons and faulty arguments (Mills 1995: 100; see Benn 1967 and Gorin\n2014b for somewhat similar ideas). \nThis more expansive version of the trickery view retains the\nconnection between manipulation and deception but extends it to\ncharacterize manipulation as inducing—tricking—the target\ninto adopting any faulty mental state, including beliefs, but also\ndesires, emotions, etc. This view might be further expanded by\nadopting Michael Cholbi’s observation that the phenomenon of ego\ndepletion might induce targets of manipulation to form faulty\nintentions (that is, intentions that do not reflect their considered\nvalues) because their resistance to temptation has been worn down\n(Cholbi 2014).  \nThe trickery view can be motivated by appeal to various examples, one\nespecially fruitful set of which is Shakespeare’s\nOthello. It seems natural to describe Shakespeare’s\ncharacter Iago as a manipulator. The activities in virtue of which he\nmerits this label seem to involve various forms of trickery. For\nexample, through insinuation, innuendo and cleverly arranging\ncircumstances (like a strategically placed handkerchief) he tricks\nOthello into suspecting—and then believing—that his new\nbride Desdemona has been unfaithful. He then plays on Othello’s\ninsecurities and other emotions to lead him into an irrational\njealousy and rage that both overshadow his love for Desdemona and\ncloud his judgment about how to react. The trickery view accounts for\nour sense that Iago manipulates Othello by noting that Iago tricks him\ninto adopting various faulty mental states—false beliefs,\nunwarranted suspicions, irrational emotions, and so on. The fact that\nthe trickery view explains our sense that Iago manipulates Othello is\na key consideration in its favor. \nProponents of the trickery view differ over several of details, most\nnotably on how to define a faulty mental state. Some\nproponents of the trickery view argue that manipulation occurs when\nthe influencer attempts to induce what the influencer regards\nas a faulty mental state into the target’s deliberations\n(Mills 1995; Noggle 1996). By contrast, Jason Hanna argues that we\nshould define manipulation in terms of the attempt to introduce an\nobjectively faulty mental state into the target’s\ndeliberations (Hanna 2015: 634; see also Sunstein 2016: 89). Anne\nBarnhill defends a trickery account of manipulation, but suggests that\nour usage of the term “manipulation” is inconsistent on\nthe question of whose standards determine whether the influencer\nattempts to induce the target to adopt a faulty mental state (Barnhill\n2014).  \nAlthough the trickery account has considerable appeal, it faces an\nimportant challenge: It apparently fails to count as manipulative a\nwhole class of tactics that seem, intuitively, to be\nmanipulative. Tactics like charm, peer pressure, and emotional\nblackmail (tactics 1, 5, and 9) do not seem to involve trickery. Yet\nit seems quite natural to think of such tactics as forms of\nmanipulation.  \nA third way to characterize manipulation is to treat it as a kind of\npressure to do as the influencer wishes. On this account, tactics like\nemotional blackmail and peer pressure are paradigm cases of\nmanipulation, since they exert pressure on the target by imposing\ncosts for failing to do what the manipulator wishes. One rationale for\ntreating manipulation as a form of pressure is the observation that\nmanipulation is neither rational persuasion nor coercion. It seems\nplausible, then, to suppose that there is a continuum between rational\npersuasion and coercion with regard to the level of pressure being\nexerted, with rational persuasion exerting no pressure, coercion\nexerting maximum pressure, and the middle region, manipulation,\nexerting pressure that falls short of being coercive. In this way, we\nmight arrive at the idea that manipulation is a form of pressure that\ndoes not rise to the level of coercion.  \nOne of the earliest philosophical accounts of manipulation, by Ruth\nFaden, Tom Beauchamp, and Nancy King, has this structure. They begin\nby contrasting using rational persuasion to convince a patient to take\na medically necessary drug with simply coercing him to take it. Then\nthey observe that \nThere are many in-between cases: For example, suppose the physician\nhas made clear that he or she will be upset with the patient if the\npatient does not take the drug, and the patient is intimidated.\nAlthough the patient is not convinced that it is the best course to\ntake the medication, … the patient agrees to take the drug\nbecause it appears that acceptance will foster a better relationship\nwith the doctor… Here the patient performs the action …\nunder a heavy measure of control by the physician’s\nrole, authority, and indeed prescription. Unlike the first case, the\npatient does not find it overwhelmingly difficult to resist the\nphysician’s proposal, but, unlike the second case, it is\nnonetheless awkward and difficult to resist this rather\n“controlling” physician. (Faden, Beauchamp, & King\n1986: 258) \nThey claim that such “in between” cases constitute\nmanipulation. However, they do not claim that all forms of\nmanipulation fall into the middle region of this continuum; they also\ncount forms of deception, indoctrination, and seduction as\nmanipulative, and claim that  \nsome manipulative strategies can be as controlling as coercion or as\nnoncontrolling as persuasion; other manipulations fall somewhere\nbetween these endpoints. (Faden, Beauchamp, & King 1986: 259)  \nNevertheless, the idea that at least some forms of manipulation\ninvolve pressure has been very influential.  \nJoel Feinberg offers a similar account of manipulation. He writes that\nmany techniques for getting someone to act in a certain way \ncan be placed on a spectrum of force running from compulsion proper,\nat one extreme, through compulsive pressure, coercion proper, and\ncoercive pressure, to manipulation, persuasion, enticement, and simple\nrequests at the other extreme. The line between forcing to act and\nmerely getting to act is drawn somewhere in the manipulation or\npersuasion part of the scale. (Feinberg 1989: 189)  \nMichael Kligman and Charles Culver offer a similar account: \nThe attempt to influence B’s behavior takes on a\nmanipulative character when … A’s primary intent\nis no longer to convince B, in a good faith manner, that acting\nas desired by A would be in keeping with B’s\nrational assessments of outcome; [but rather] to procure or engineer\nthe needed assent by bringing pressure to bear, in a deliberate and\ncalculated way, on what he presume to be the manipulable features of\nB’s motivational system. (Kligman & Culver 1992:\n186–187) \nKligman and Culver go on to distinguish this manipulative pressure\nfrom coercion by claiming that the latter, unlike the former, involves\n“sufficiently strong incentives … that it would be\nunreasonable to expect any rational person not to so act”\n(Kligman & Culver 1992: 187). More recently, Marcia Baron and\nAllen Wood have also discussed forms of manipulation that seem best\ncharacterized as forms of pressure (Baron 2003; Wood 2014). \nAlthough we can treat the idea that manipulation consists of a form of\npressure as a full-fledged theory of manipulation, most of the authors\njust cited hold only that some forms of manipulation consist of\npressure. In particular, most agree with Faden, Beauchamp, and King,\nthat other forms of manipulation are more akin to deception. Thus, it\nis somewhat artificial to speak of the pressure model as a theory\nmeant to cover all forms of manipulation. It is more accurate to\nregard the pressure model as claiming that exerting non-coercive\npressure is sufficient (but perhaps not necessary) for an influence to\ncount as manipulative. \nOur discussion of the trickery and pressure accounts highlights a\nrather striking fact: If we survey the tactics that seem intuitively\nto be examples of manipulation, we find tactics that seem best\ndescribed as forms of trickery as well as tactics that seem best\ndescribed as forms of pressure. This is puzzling, since, on the face\nof it, trickery and pressure seem rather dissimilar. What should we\nmake of the fact that we use the same\nconcept—manipulation—to refer to methods of influence that\nseem to operate by such dissimilar mechanisms? \nSeveral responses are possible. First, it is possible that the common\nusage of term “manipulation” refers to such a diverse set\nof phenomena that no single analysis will capture every form of\ninfluence to which the term is commonly applied. Felicia Ackerman\nargues that the term “manipulation”  exhibits\n“combinatorial vagueness”: while it is connected to\nfeatures like inhibition of rational deliberation, unethicalness,\ndeceptiveness, playing upon non-rational impulses, shrewdness,\npressure, etc., “no condition on the list is sufficient,\n… and no single condition … is even necessary” for\nan instance of influence to be manipulative (Ackerman 1995:\n337–38).  \nSecond, we might hold that the concept of manipulation is not vague\nbut rather disjunctive, so that manipulation consists of\neither trickery or pressure. Indeed, in one of the\nearliest philosophical analyses of manipulation, Joel Rudinow takes\nthis approach. Rudinow begins with the following thesis:  \nA attempts to manipulate S iff A attempts to\ninfluence S’s behavior by means of deception or pressure\nor by playing on a supposed weakness of S. (Rudinow 1978: 343)\n \nHe goes on to claim that that the use of pressure is manipulative only\nif the would-be manipulator directs it at some supposed weakness in\nhis target that will render the target unable to resist it; this leads\nhim to finalize his definition in terms of “deception or by\nplaying upon a supposed weakness” of the target, with the second\ndisjunct meant to cover pressure-based tactics (Rudinow 1978: 346).\nSeveral other philosophers have followed Rudinow’s disjunctive\napproach to defining manipulation (Tomlinson 1986; Sher 2011; Mandava\n& Millum 2013). \nA somewhat different version of the disjunctive strategy might begin\nwith the pressure account’s continuum pressure of between\nrational persuasion and coercion, but go on to add a second dimension\nconsisting of a continuum between rational persuasion and outright\nlying. We might then define manipulation in terms of a two-dimensional\nspace bounded by rational persuasion, outright lying, and coercion. A\nstrategy like this is suggested by Sapir Handelman, although he adds a\nthird dimension that measures the level of “control” that\na given form of influence exerts (Handelman 2009). \nDisjunctive strategies that combine the trickery and pressure accounts\nare appealing because they seem to do a better job than either the\ntrickery or pressure account alone in accounting for the wide variety\nof tactics that seem intuitively to count as manipulation. However,\nthis wider coverage comes a price. If the disjunctive approach simply\nputs an “or” between the trickery and pressure accounts,\nthen it will leave unanswered the question of what, if anything, makes\nall forms of manipulation manifestations of the same phenomenon. Of\ncourse, it is possible that this question cannot be answered because,\nas a matter of fact, there are two irreducibly different forms of\nmanipulation. But this seems like a conclusion that we should accept\nonly reluctantly, after having made a good faith effort to determine\nwhether there really is anything in common between pressure-based\nmanipulation and trickery-based manipulation.  \nOne possible answer to this challenge might be drawn from Marcia\nBaron’s important paper on “Manipulativeness”, which\ndiagnoses the underlying moral wrong in manipulation in terms of an\nAristotelian vice. She suggests treating manipulativeness as the vice\nof excess with regard to “to what extent—and how and when\nand to whom and for what sorts of ends—to seek to influence\nothers’ conduct” (Baron 2003: 48). On her view,\nmanipulativeness is at the opposite extreme from the vice of  \nrefraining from offering potentially helpful counsel; or refraining\nfrom trying to stop someone from doing something very dangerous, for\nexample, from driving home from one’s house while drunk. (Baron\n2003: 48)  \nPerhaps, then, we can understand the underlying similarity between\ntrickery- and pressure-based manipulation as manifestations of a\ncommon vice, as different ways of going wrong with regard to how and\nhow much we should try to influence those around us. \nFinally, it is worth noting two other approaches to defining\nmanipulation. Patricia Greenspan suggests that manipulation is a sort\nof hybrid between coercion and deception. She writes that  \ncases of manipulation seem to have a foot in both of the usual\ncategories of intentional interference with another agent’s\nautonomy, coercion and deception, but partly as a result, they do not\nfit squarely in either category. (Greenspan 2003: 157)  \nThus, we might characterize her view as a “conjunctive”\ntheory of manipulation, according to which it contains elements of\nboth pressure and deception. It certainly seems true\nthat manipulators often use both pressure and deception. For example,\na manipulator who employs peer pressure might also exaggerate the\nextent to which the target’s peers will disapprove of her if she\nchooses the option that the manipulator wants her not to choose.\nHowever, we can also point to relatively pure cases of manipulative\npressure or manipulative trickery: Indeed, all of the items on the\nlist above can be imagined as involving either pure pressure or pure\ntrickery. The apparent existence of cases of manipulation that involve\nonly deception or only pressure seems to be a problem for\nGreenspan’s hybrid view. \nEric Cave defends a theory of what he calls “motive\nmanipulation” (Cave 2007, 2014). Cave’s approach rests on\na distinction between “concerns”, which are motives that\nconsist of the agent’s conscious pro-attitudes toward some action\nor state of affairs, and “non-concern motives” which are\nmotives that are not also concerns (i.e., they are not also conscious\npro-attitudes). This distinction in hand, Cave defines motive manipulation as any form of\ninfluence that operates by engaging non-concern motives. This theory\nclearly implies that appeals to non-conscious motives, and as well\ninfluences that operate via “quasi-hypnotic techniques”\nand “crude behavioral conditioning” are manipulative (Cave\n2014: 188). But it is not clear what Cave’s theory would say\nabout appeals to consciously-experienced emotions or pressure tactics\nlike peer pressor or emotional blackmail. This is because the\ndistinction between a concern and a non-concern motive—which is\na crucial part of the theory—seems under-described. Are such\nthings as my fear of failure or my desire to retain your friendship\nconcerns? Without a fuller account of the crucial distinction between\nconcerns and non-concern motives, it is difficult to say whether\nCave’s theory provides a plausible answer to the identification\nquestion. \nA complete answer to the evaluation question should tell us about the\nsort of wrongfulness that manipulation possesses: Is it absolutely\nimmoral, pro tanto immoral, prima facie immoral,\netc.? It should also tell us when manipulation is immoral if it is not\nalways immoral. Finally, a satisfactory answer to the evaluation\nquestion should tell us what makes manipulation immoral in cases where\nit is immoral.  \nSuppose that Tonya is a captured terrorist who has hidden a bomb in\nthe city and that her preferred course of action is to keep its\nlocation secret until it to explodes. And suppose that Irving is an\nFBI interrogator who wants Tonya to reveal the bomb’s location\nbefore it explodes. How would this way filling in the details of the\ncase change our moral assessment of the various ways that Irving might\ninduce Tonya to change her mind? \nOne rather extreme answer would be: “not at all”. This\nhardline view would hold that manipulation is always morally wrong, no\nmatter what the consequences. Inasmuch as this hardline view resembles\nKant’s notorious hardline position that lying is always wrong,\none might look to Kant’s ethics for considerations to support\nit. But just as hardly anyone accepts Kant’s hardline position\nagainst lying, the hardline view against manipulation also seems short\non defenders.  \nA less extreme position would be that while manipulation is always\npro tanto wrong, other moral considerations can sometimes\noutweigh the pro tanto wrongness of manipulation. Thus, we\nmight think that manipulation is always wrong to some extent, but that\ncountervailing moral factors might sometimes suffice to make\nmanipulation justified on balance. What might such factors include?\nOne obvious candidate would be consequences—for example, the\nfact that Irving’s successful manipulation of Tonya would save\nmany innocent lives. Non-consequentialist factors might also be\nthought to be countervailing considerations: Perhaps the immorality of\nTonya’s character, or the fact that she is acting on an evil desire or\nintention, is a countervailing factor that can outweigh the pro\ntanto wrongness of Irving’s manipulation. It is important to note that, on\nthis view, the fact that an action involves manipulation is always a\nmoral reason to avoid it, even if stronger countervailing\nconsiderations render it not wrong on balance. For example, even if\nIrving’s manipulation of Terrorist Tonya is not wrong on balance\n(e.g., because of the innocent lives that will be saved), if Irving can get\nTonya to reveal the bomb’s location without manipulation (or\nanything else that is comparably immoral), then it would be morally\nbetter to avoid manipulating her. \nBy contrast, we might hold that manipulation is merely prima\nfacie immoral. On this view, there is a presumption that\nmanipulation is immoral, but this presumption can be defeated in some\nsituations. When the presumption is defeated, manipulation is\nnot wrong at all (i.e., not even pro tanto wrong). On this\nview, we might say that while manipulation is usually wrong, it is not\nwrong at all in the terrorist scenario. On this view, not only is\nIrving’s manipulation of Terrorist Tonya not wrong on balance,\nbut there is not even any moral reason for him to choose a\nnon-manipulative method of getting Tonya to reveal the bomb’s\nlocation if one is available.  \nA more complex—but, perhaps, ultimately more\nplausible—view would combine the prima facie and\npro tanto approaches. Such a view would hold that\nmanipulation is prima facie immoral, but that when it is\nwrong, the wrongness is pro tanto rather than absolute. On\nthis view, there are situations in which the presumption against\nmanipulation is defeated and manipulation is not even pro\ntanto wrong. Perhaps bluffing in poker is like this. But where\nthe presumption is not defeated, the wrongness of manipulation is only\npro tanto, and thus able to be outweighed by sufficiently\nweighty countervailing moral considerations. In such cases, even if it\nis not wrong on balance to manipulate, it would still be morally\npreferable to avoid manipulation in favor of some other, morally\nlegitimate, form of influence. Manipulating a friend into refraining\nfrom sending a text to rekindle an abusive relationship might be an\nexample where the pro tanto wrongness of manipulation is\noutweighed by other considerations. In such a case, it seems plausible\nto maintain that it would be morally preferable to use reason rather\nthan manipulation to get one’s friend to see that sending the\ntext would be a mistake, even if the facts of the situation would\njustify resorting to manipulation. A view along these lines has been\ndefended by Marcia Baron (2014: 116–17). Although this view is\nfar less absolute than the hardline view, it retains the claim that\nmanipulation is prima facie wrong, so that there is always a\npresumption that it is immoral, though this presumption is sometimes\ndefeated. It is also compatible with the idea that the term\n“manipulation” has built into it a connotation of moral\ndis-approbation.  \nHowever, the claim that manipulation is presumptively wrong might be\nchallenged. One might argue that “manipulation” is, or at\nleast should be, a morally neutral term without even the presumption\nof immorality. On this view, whether a given instance of manipulation\nis immoral will always depend on the facts of the situation, and the\nterm itself includes (or should include) no presumption one way or the\nother. Clearly there are non-moralized notions of manipulation. When\nwe speak of a scientist manipulating variables in an experiment, or a\npilot manipulating the plane’s controls, our use of the term is\ndevoid of any hint of moral opprobrium. In the social sciences, we can\nfind cases of the term “manipulation” being used in a\nmorally neutral way even when another person is the target of\nmanipulation. For example, several papers by the evolutionary\npsychologist David M. Buss and colleagues use the term\n“manipulation” more or less as a synonym for\n“influence” in their discussions of how humans influence\nthe behavior of other humans (D.M. Buss 1992; D.M. Buss et al. 1987).\nOf course, pointing out morally neutral usages of\n“manipulation” does not really settle the question of\nwhether we should prefer a moralized or a non-moralized notion of\nmanipulation. An argument for preferring a non-moralized notion of\nmanipulation is provided by Allen Wood, who writes that \nIf we think that moral argument should proceed not merely by invoking\nour pro- or con- sentiments, or appealing to our unargued intuitions,\nbut instead by identifying objective facts about a situation that give\nus good reasons for condemning or approving certain things, then we\nwould generally do much better to use a non-moralized sense of words\nlike “coercion”, “manipulation”, and\n“exploitation”—a sense in which these words can be\nused to refer to such objective facts. (Wood 2014: 19–20)  \nNo matter how we answer the question of whether manipulation in\ngeneral is absolutely immoral, prima facie immoral, pro\ntanto immoral, or not even presumptively immoral, there are\nclearly situations in which manipulation is immoral. Any complete\nanswer to the evaluation question must explain why manipulation is\nimmoral in those cases where it is immoral. In addition, any view that\nholds that manipulation is only pro tanto and/or prima\nfacie immoral should tell us what sorts of considerations can\ndefeat the presumption that it is immoral and/or outweigh its pro\ntanto immorality. Several accounts have been offered to identify\nthe source of the moral wrongfulness of manipulation (when it is\nwrong). \nPerhaps the most straightforward way to explain the wrongfulness of\nmanipulation (when it is wrong) points to the harm done to its\ntargets. Manipulation is commonly used aggressively, as a way to harm\nthe manipulator’s target, or at least to benefit the manipulator\nat the target’s expense. The harmfulness of manipulation seems\nespecially salient in manipulative relationships, where manipulation\nmay lead to subordination and even abuse. The more minor economic harm\nof the extraction of money from consumers is often pointed to as a\nwrong-making feature of manipulative advertising, and there has been\nsome discussion of how manipulation might lead targets to enter into\nexploitative contracts. Systematic political manipulation may weaken\ndemocratic institutions and perhaps even lead to tyranny.  \nIt is commonly held that harmfulness is always a wrong-making\nfeature—though perhaps one that is only prima facie or\npro tanto. Thus, it seems reasonable to think that instances\nof manipulation that harm their victims are, for that reason, at least\npro tanto or prima facie immoral. But not all\ninstances of manipulation harm their victims. In fact, manipulation\nsometimes benefits its target. If the harm to the victim is the only\nwrong-making feature of manipulation, then paternalistic or beneficent\nmanipulation could never be even pro tanto wrong. But this\nclaim strikes most people as implausible. To see this, consider that\nthe debate about whether paternalistic nudges are wrongfully\nmanipulative is not settled simply by pointing out that they benefit\ntheir targets. The fact that it seems possible for an act to be\nwrongfully manipulative, even though it benefits (and is intended to\nbenefit) the target, presumably explains why there are few, if any,\ndefenses of the claim that manipulation is wrong only when\nand because it harms the target. Nevertheless, it seems plausible to\nhold that when manipulation does harm its target, this harm adds to\nthe wrongness of the manipulative behavior.  \nPerhaps the most common account of the wrongness of manipulation\nclaims that it violates, undermines, or is otherwise antithetical to\nthe target’s personal autonomy. The reason for this is easy to\nsee: Manipulation, by definition, influences decision-making by means\nthat—unlike rational persuasion—are not clearly\nautonomy-preserving. Thus, it is natural to regard it as interfering\nwith autonomous decision-making. The idea that manipulation is wrong\nbecause it undermines autonomous choice is implicit in discussions of\nmanipulation as a potential invalidator of consent. Indeed, the\nassumption that manipulation undermines autonomy is so common in\ndiscussions of manipulation and consent that it would be difficult to\ncite a paper on that topic that does not at least implicitly treat\nmanipulation as undermining autonomous choice. But even outside of\ndiscussions of autonomous consent, the claim that manipulation is\nimmoral because it undermines autonomy commonly made (and perhaps even\nmore commonly assumed). \nHowever, there are reasons for caution about tying the moral status of\nmanipulation too tightly to its effects on autonomy. One can imagine\ncases where it is not obvious that manipulation undermines autonomy.\nOne can even imagine cases where a manipulative act might enhance the\ntarget’s overall autonomy. For example, a teacher might\nmanipulate a student into taking a course of study which ultimately\nenhances her autonomy by opening new career options, improving her\nskills of critical self-reflection, etc. We might also imagine cases\nwhere manipulation is used to support the target’s autonomous\nchoice. Suppose that Tonya has autonomously decided to leave an\nabusive partner, but that she is now tempted to go back. If Irving\nresorts to a manipulative tactic designed to nudge her away from\nbacksliding on her autonomous choice to leave her abuser, then his\naction might seem less like undermining Tonya’s autonomy and\nmore like reinforcing it. \nOne might respond that these examples do not undermine the claim that\nmanipulation is wrong when and because it undermines autonomy because\nthese autonomy-enhancing instances of manipulation are not wrong.\nHowever, this response faces a complication: Consider the case where\nIrving manipulates Tonya into resisting the temptation to backslide on\nher resolution to leave her abusive partner. It seems plausible to say\nthat Irving’s manipulation in this case is not wrong on balance. But\nit also seems plausible to say that it was nevertheless pro tanto\nwrong since it seems plausible to think that it would have been\nmorally preferable for Irving to find some other way to help Tonya\navoid backsliding. But even the claim that Irving’s autonomy-enhancing\nmanipulation is merely pro tanto wrong seems inconsistent with the\nclaim that manipulation is wrong when and because it undermines\nautonomy. Of course, it is open to defenders of the autonomy account\nof the wrongness of manipulation to bite the bullet here and deny that\nautonomy-enhancing manipulation is even pro tanto immoral.\n \nAlternatively—and perhaps more plausibly—the defender of\nthe autonomy account of the wrongness of manipulation might concede\nthat Irving’s autonomy-enhancing manipulation of Tonya is pro\ntanto wrong.  But she might explain this by claiming that while the\nmanipulation is autonomy-enhancing overall, it nevertheless undermines\nTonya’s autonomy in the short term. The fact that Irving’s\nmanipulation undermines Tonya’s autonomy temporarily explains\nwhy it is pro tanto immoral—and why it would be morally better\nfor Irving to find a non-manipulative way to help Tonya avoid\nbacksliding. But the fact that the manipulation enhances Tonya’s\nautonomy overall explains why it is not immoral on balance. Of course,\nthis strategy will not appeal to those who hold that it is wrong to\nundermine a person’s autonomy even when doing so enhances that\nsame person’s overall autonomy.\n  \nA more significant threat to the link between manipulation and\nautonomy appears in an influential paper by Sarah Buss. She argues\nthat “when we are obligated to refrain from manipulation or\ndeceiving one another, this has relatively little to do with the value\nof autonomy” (S. Buss 2005: 208). Buss’s argument has two\nparts. First, she claims that manipulation does not, in fact, deprive\nits victim of the ability to make choices; indeed, it typically\npresupposes that the target will make her own choice. But if the\nmanipulation does not take away the target’s choice, Buss\nmaintains, it does not undermine her autonomy. (For a similar\nargument, see Long 2014). Second, Buss argues that it is false to\nclaim that an autonomous agent would rationally reject being subjected\nto manipulative influences. To support this claim, Buss argues that\nmanipulation and deception are “pervasive forms of human\ninteraction which are often quite benign and even valuable” (S.\nBuss 2005: 224). Her most notable example is the cultivation of\nromantic love, which often involves—and may even\nrequire—significant amounts of behavior that is aptly described\nas manipulation.  \nDefenders of the link between autonomy and the wrongness of\nmanipulation are not without potential replies to Buss’s\nintriguing argument. For one thing, it seems possible to craft a\nnotion of autonomy according to which having false information (or\nother faulty mental states) or being subjected to pressure (even when\nit does not rise to the level of coercion) compromise a person’s\nautonomy. Even though false beliefs about how to achieve one’s\nends may not compromise one’s authentic values or one’s\npowers of practical reasoning, they do seem to compromise one’s\nability to achieve one’s autonomously-chosen ends, and it is\nplausible to regard this as a diminishment of (some form of) autonomy.\nMoreover, the defender of the link between autonomy and the wrongness\nof manipulation might simply deny that the forms of manipulation to\nwhich an autonomous agent would consent (for example, those required\nby romantic love) are wrongful cases of manipulation.  \nSeveral accounts of manipulation tie its moral status to the fact that\nit influences behavior by methods that seem analogous to how one might\noperate a tool or a device. On this view, manipulation involves\ntreating the target as a device to be operated rather than an agent to\nbe reasoned with. As Claudia Mills puts it,  \na manipulator is interested in reasons not as logical justifiers but\nas causal levers. For the manipulator, reasons are tools, and bad\nreasons can work as well as, or better than, a good one. (Mills 1995:\n100–101)  \nThe point here is that a manipulator treats his target not as a fellow\nrational agent, for that would require giving good reasons for doing\nas the manipulator proposes. Instead, the manipulator treats his\ntarget as a being whose behavior is to be elicited by pressing the\nmost effective “causal levers”.  \nOf course, the idea that treating a person as a mere object is immoral\nis a prominent feature of Kant’s account of respect for persons\n(see entry on\n respect).\n Thus, it would be natural to appeal to Kantian ideas to help\nelaborate the idea that manipulation is wrong because of the way that\nit treats its target. Thus, for example, Thomas E. Hill writes,  \nThe idea that one should try to reason with others rather than to\nmanipulate them by nonrational techniques is manifest in Kant’s\ndiscussion of the duty to respect others. (Hill 1980: 96)  \nAlthough\n Kant’s moral philosophy (see entry)\n is a natural place to look for the idea that the wrongfulness of\nmanipulation derives from a failure to treat the target as a person,\nthere are potential drawbacks to tying the account too tightly to\nKant. For Kant’s notion of rational agency appears to be of the\nhyper-cognitive, hyper-intellectual variety. Hence, if it is unethical\nto fail to treat someone as that kind of rational agent, we\nmight be pushed toward the conclusion that the only acceptable basis\nfor human interaction is the kind of coldly intellectual rational\npersuasion that excludes any appeal to emotions. But as we saw\nearlier, there are good reasons for regarding such a conclusion as\nimplausible. \nThese considerations certainly do not entail that it is hopeless to\nlook to some notion of treating persons as things for an account of\nthe wrongfulness of manipulation. But they do suggest that more work\nmust be done before the claim that manipulation is wrong because it\ntreats a person as a mere thing can be regarded as much more than a\nplatitude.  \nAlthough harm, autonomy, and treating persons as things are the most\nprominent suggestions about what makes manipulation wrong when it is\nwrong, one can find other suggestions in the literature. For example,\nMarcia Baron’s virtue-theoretic account of manipulativeness\nsuggests that we might account for what is wrong about manipulation in\nterms of the character of the manipulator (Baron 2003). Patricia\nGreenspan suggests that when manipulation is immoral, it is because it\nviolates the terms of the relationship between the manipulator and his\ntarget—terms that will vary according to the nature of the\nrelationship between them (Greenspan 2003). Such a view\nsuggests—plausibly—that the moral status of a given\ninstance of manipulation will depend at least in part on the nature of\nthe relationship between the influencer and the target of the\ninfluence. \nIn addition to answering the identification and evaluation questions, a\ncomplete theory of manipulation should address several further issues.\n \nDiscussions of manipulation often distinguish between cases where the\nmanipulator influences his target directly, and cases where the\nmanipulator influences the target’s behavior by arranging the\ntarget’s environment in ways that induce her to act one way\nrather than another. Consider Joel Rudinow’s example of a\nmalingerer who manipulates a psychiatrist into admitting him to the\npsychiatric ward (Rudinow 1978). He does this by fooling a police\nofficer into thinking he is about to commit suicide. The police\nofficer brings him to the ward, reports that he is suicidal, and\nrequests that he be admitted. Although the psychiatrist is not fooled,\nher hospital’s rules force her to admit the malingerer at the\npolice officer’s request. It seems clear that the malingerer has\nmanipulated the police officer by tricking him into adopting a faulty\nbelief. But the psychiatrist, while not falling for the feigned\nsuicide attempt and thus not adopting any faulty beliefs, is\nnevertheless induced to do what she did not want to do. Although it\nseems correct to say that the psychiatrist was manipulated, this form\nof manipulation seems different from what was done to the police\nofficer.  By feigning a suicide attempt, the malingerer has tampered\nwith the police officer’s beliefs. But he has maneuvered the\npsychiatrist into admitting him, not by tampering with her\npsychological states, but rather by “gaming the system”,\nas we might say.  \nAttempts to articulate this distinction go back at least as far as the\nsociologists Donald Warwick and Herbert Kelman’s distinction\nbetween “environmental” and “psychic”\nmanipulation (Warwick & Kelman 1973), which influenced Faden,\nBeauchamp, and King’s seminal philosophical account of\nmanipulation (Faden, Beauchamp, & King 1986: 355–68). Anne\nBarnhill distinguishes between manipulation that “changes the\noptions available to the person or changes the situation she’s\nin, and thereby changes her attitudes” on the one hand, and\nmanipulation that “changes a person’s attitudes directly\nwithout changing the options available to her or the surrounding\nsituation” on the other (Barnhill 2014: 53). Drawing a similar\ndistinction, Claudia Mills writes \nIf A wants to get B to do act x, there are two general\nstrategies that A might undertake. A might change, or\npropose to change, the external or objective features of\nB’s choice situation; or alternatively, A might\ntry to alter certain internal or subjective features of\nB’s choice situation. While some writers might call both\nstrategies manipulative, at least in certain circumstances, I prefer\nto reserve the label manipulation for a subset of morally\nproblematic actions falling in the second category. (Mills 1995:\n97) \nAlthough Rudinow’s case provides a clear contrast between what\nwe might call psychological manipulation and situational manipulation,\nthis distinction—or at least its importance—is not always\nso clear. Consider\n tactic 9\nabove, where Irving threatens to withdraw his friendship if Tonya does\nnot do as Irving wishes. Is this direct psychological manipulation, or\nsituational manipulation? The criterion offered by Barnhill and others\ncounts it as situational manipulation, since Irving changes\nTonya’s choice situation so that doing Y and retaining\nIrving’s friendship is no longer an option. But how is this\ntactic any less of a direct interference with Tonya’s decision\nthan if Irving had engaged in some form of deception? Why would it be\nmore like what the malingerer does to the police officer than what he\ndoes to the psychiatrist? \nThis is not to deny that there is a difference between psychological\nand situational manipulation. Instead, it is to ask what that\ndifference is, and why it might matter. Presumably, the distinction is\nmeant to differentiate between tactics that affect a target’s\nbehavior by directly tampering with her psychology and those that do\nnot. But if this is the distinction, then it seems plausible to think\nthat Irving’s use of emotional blackmail is at least as direct a\ntampering with Tonya’s psychology as, say, Iago’s dropping\nof the handkerchief in a location where it will trick Othello into\nbecoming inappropriately suspicious. Yet criteria like those proposed\nby Mills and Barnhill seem to imply that these two forms of\nmanipulation are on opposite sides of that distinction. \nNevertheless, there does seem something importantly different between\nwhat the malingerer in Rudinow’s example does to the police\nofficer and what he does to the psychiatrist. But much work remains to\nbe done to provide a well-motivated account of that difference. Such\nan account should not only get the intuitively right answers in cases\nof direct pressure (like emotional blackmail) and indirect deception\n(like Iago’s dropping the handkerchief), but it should also\nexplain whether and why the distinction makes a moral difference.  \nSome views of manipulation seem to suggest, if not require, that\nmanipulators have fairly complex intentions—such as the\nintention to lead the target astray—for manipulation to\noccur. Marcia Baron and Kate Manne offer compelling reasons to think\nthat such requirements are too strong. Baron argues that manipulation\ncan occur even if the manipulator only has  \na combination of intent and recklessness: the aim of getting the other\nperson do what one wants, together with recklessness in the way that\none goes about reaching that goal. (Baron 2014: 103)  \nShe goes on to argue that the manipulator need not be aware that she\nhas that intention (Baron 2014, 101).  Manne agrees; to support this\nclaim, she offers the example of Joan, who gives extravagant gifts to\nrelatives who pay her less attention than (she thinks) they should\n(Manne 2014, 225). Manne tells Joan’s story in such a way that\nit seems plausible to say both that Joan’s gift-giving is a\nmanipulative attempt to make her relatives feel guilty, and that Joan\ndoes not consciously intend to make her relatives feel guilty. If\nManne’s description of her example is correct, then it seems\nthat Joan can manipulate her relatives into feeling guilty without\nhaving any conscious intention of making them feel guilty. (Later,\nManne [2014, 235] goes even farther, suggesting that “people can\neven behave manipulatively despite consciously intending not\nto.”) Of course, those who hold that manipulation requires more\nconscious intention than Manne allows might well balk at her\ndescription of the case of Joan. Nevertheless, the arguments offered\nby Baron and Manne raise important questions about the level of\nconscious intentionality required for an action to be\nmanipulative.  \nThe question of what sort of intention is required for an act to count\nas manipulative has practical implications for assessing the behavior\nof children, who sometimes behave in ways that seem aptly described as\nmanipulative even when they are too young to have the complicated\nintentions that some theories of manipulation might require. Similar\nworries arise for assessing the behavior of people for whom\nmanipulativeness has become a habit, or a part of their personalities.\nIndeed, certain personality disorders—such as borderline\npersonality disorder and antisocial personality disorder—are\noften characterized by manipulativeness, as is the so-called\nMachiavellian personality type (Christie & Geis 1970). As\nprofessor of psychiatric nursing Len Bowers writes,  \nthe manipulative behaviour of some personality-disordered (PD)\npatients is consistent and frequent. It is an integral part of their\ninterpersonal style, a part of the very disorder itself. (Bowers 2003:\n329; see also Potter 2006)  \nIn such cases, one wonders what level of intentionality lies behind\nbehavior that we would otherwise think of as manipulative. Even if we\nare inclined to regard childhood or certain personality disorders as\nfactors that mitigate the blameworthiness of manipulative behavior, it\nwould seem counterintuitive for a theory of manipulation to say that\nchildren and persons with personality disorders are incapable of\nacting manipulatively.  \nThe idea that manipulation can be a tool for the powerful to oppress\nthe less powerful is not new, even if the term\n“manipulation” has not always been used to express it.\nMarxian notions of ideology and false consciousness as mechanisms that\nfacilitate the exploitation of workers by capital clearly resemble the\nconcept of manipulation as it is being used here. (Allen Wood explores\nsome of these connections in Wood 2014.) More recently, the concept of\n“gas lighting” has become a common feature of feminist\ntheorizing about how the patriarchy manipulates women into doubting\ntheir own judgments about reality. On a smaller scale, a bevy of\nself-help books focus on how manipulative tactics can be used to\ncreate and maintain subordination within relationships (Braiker 2004;\nSimon 2010; Kole 2016). \nA relative lack of socio-political power is almost certainly one\nsource of vulnerability to manipulation. But there are likely others\nas well. The trickery model of manipulation\nsuggests—plausibly—that people who are less intellectually\nsophisticated are especially vulnerable to trickery and therefore to\nmanipulation. The pressure model suggests that financial, social, and\nemotional desperation may make one especially vulnerable to pressures\ncreated by threats to worsen an already tenuous situation. Moreover,\nsome forms of manipulation, like so-called “negging”\n(tactic 6) and gaslighting\n (tactic 8)\n may work to increase the target’s vulnerability to further\nmanipulation.  \nHowever, it may also be true that manipulation is a tempting tool for\nuse by the vulnerable against the powerful. As Patricia Greenspan\nnotes, \nmanipulation is often recommended as a strategy particularly for\nwomen, or simply is treated as characteristic of women, at least in a\nworld where women cannot act openly to achieve their ends. A further\nargument for manipulation in these cases appeal to the limits on what\nis possible in a position of subordination. (Greenspan 2003: 156) \nSimilarly, Len Bowers observes that  \nit is possible to interpret manipulation as a normal response to\nincarceration, rather than as being a pathological style of behavior,\n \nand that  \nmanipulative strategies may be viewed as a low-key way of fighting\nback at a system which has deprived the prisoner of normal freedom.\n(Bowers 2003: 330)  \nFinally, it seems likely that one reason why children often resort to\nmanipulative tactics is that they often lack any other (or any other\nequally effective) way to get what they want. \nIt is also worth noting that the idea that the idea that manipulation\nundermines autonomous choice might be used, somewhat paradoxically, to\nundermine autonomous choice, especially among the non-elite. This\npoint is comes out forcefully in a comment by Sarah Skwire (2015,\nOther Internet Resources) on George Akerlof and Robert Shiller’s\nbook, Phishing for Phools (Akerlof & Shiller\n2015). Akerlof and Shiller discuss a number of advertising, sales, and\nmarketing practices that they deem manipulative. The problem that\nSkwire notes is that the reason for calling these practices\nmanipulative is that consumers make choices that Akerlof and Shiller\nthink are sufficiently irrational that they would only be made under\nthe influence of manipulation. Skwire writes that this approach to\ndetecting manipulation demonstrates “contempt for the decisions\nmade by people who are poorer and from a lower social class than the\nauthors” (Skwire 2015, Other Internet Resources). In short, she\nsuggests that Akerlof and Shiller are too quick to suspect\nmanipulation in cases where people make different decisions from the\nones they think best. Whether or not we agree with Skwire’s\ncriticisms of Akerlof and Shiller, her point serves as a cautionary\none: Even if we accept that manipulation undermines autonomous choice,\nwe must be careful not to use that as a reason to suspect that people\nwho make different choices from what we think are best must therefore\nbe victims of manipulation. It would be ironic—and\nunjust—to use the idea that manipulation is a wrongful\ninterference with autonomy as a weapon to delegitimize the autonomous\nchoices of people with whom we disagree or whose situations, needs,\nand values we do not understand.","contact.mail":"noggl1r@cmich.edu","contact.domain":"cmich.edu"}]
