Unlike Buddhism which ultimately hailed from India, Confucianism was first and foremost a distinctly Chinese teaching. It spread, however, from Han dynasty China, into Korea, and then later entered Japan via, for the most part, the Korean peninsula. In significant respects, then, Confucianism is the intellectual force defining much of the East Asian identity of Japan, especially in relation to philosophical thought and practice. \n\n\n\nWhile there is a religious dimension to Confucianism, its teachings—ethical, epistemological, metaphysical, political, and aesthetic—are typically understood in relation to the socio-political world of humanity, beginning with the individual and his/her pursuit of moral and intellectual perfection, the family and its pursuit of harmony and order, and the polity and its pursuit of peace and prosperity throughout all below heaven, i.e., the world at large. In this respect, Confucianism was the secular philosophy operative in the ordinary world of everyday existence, at one level or another, throughout Japanese history, well into modern times. As often as not, however, its teachings became so integrated into Japanese culture without appeal to their overall identity as “Confucian” teachings, leading many, over time, to assume naively that they were integral to the Japanese mind and its myriad expressions in history and culture.\n\n\n\nViewed as a religio-philosophical teaching, Confucianism brims with high-minded ideals that have always challenged humanity to realize the highest state of ethical perfection and self-realization. However, as a political doctrine appropriated by the ruling elite to provide a modicum of legitimization for coercive rule, Confucianism was often voiced in cynical if not self-serving ways, belying the very ideals to which little more than lip-service was otherwise given. However, from the beginnings of political unity in Japan as provided by the nascent imperial system and then later by various shogunal regimes, Confucian thinking informed the ethics and socio-political ideals of the polity, and not infrequently imperial names and reign names, thus defining the parameters of real world discourse about the governed, those governing, and the nature and purpose of government. In modern times, ever resilient Confucian notions have provided conceptual foundations for integrating much of western thinking about self, society, the family, and the polity, thus helping to mediate Japan’s advance, philosophically, toward a more global understanding of civilization and modernity. \n\n\n\nHere, rather than trace the historical vicissitudes of Confucianism in Japanese culture, or explore the thinking of individual scholars, Confucianism will be approached as a systematic conceptual discourse defining the contours, philosophically, of much that was said and thought about the everyday world of common sense reality. In particular, the focus is on Confucian thinking about language, metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, the mind, political theory, education, spirituality, and the environment. In this way, the foundations of Confucianism as intellectual discourse are hopefully laid bare. \n\n\n\n“Confucianism” is a term used by westerners to refer to a\ndiverse set of philosophical movements that have been variously known\nin Japanese as Jugaku (the learning of the scholars),\nJukyō (the teachings of the scholars), seigaku\n(the learning of the sages), seirigaku (the learning of human nature\nand principle), rigaku (the learning related to principle),\nand shingaku (the learning of the mind). There was no single\nword in the traditional East Asian lexicon that corresponded exactly\nand consistently to “Confucianism,” yet by late-medieval\nand early-modern times, there was a fairly distinct understanding\namong Japanese intellectuals of an essential unity to the diverse\nConfucian teachings otherwise variously referred to. This is clear in\nreferences to the “three teachings”, Confucianism,\nBuddhism, and Daoism (and/or Shintō). One of many examples is\nMatsunaga Sekigo’s (1592–1657) Irinshō (Selected\nWritings on Ethics, 1640), which opens by stating, “Between\nheaven and earth, there are three major ways: the Confucian, which is\nthe way of Confucius; the Buddhist, which is the way of Shakyamuni;\nand the Daoist, which is the way of Laozi.” \n\nThe most commonly used references to Confucianism in Japanese\nhistory, traditional and modern, are the terms Jugaku and\nJukyō. In these, Ju is the Japanese reading of\nthe Chinese word Ru, literally referring to “weaklings.” The\nlatter was a reference to scholars who tended to\nwork with their minds rather than their bodies and were, as a result,\nperceived as being weaker. The term was used by later\nscholars in explaining the teachings of Confucius (551–479\nB.C.E.). Acceptance of the term partly reflected Confucius’\ndistaste for coercive force as opposed to the softer power of\nethical examples and the allegedly irresistible efficacy of moral\nsuasion. \n\nIn the west, the term “Confucianism” first came into use\nfollowing contacts between Jesuit missionaries and Chinese\nscholars. The Jesuit term “Confucianism” is a Latinized\nversion of the honorific reference to the great sage of China, Kong\nFuzi. Minus the honorific fuzi, Confucius’ name was Kong\nQiu. The relatively recent origins of the western term should not\nobscure the fact that there had long before developed, among East\nAsian intellectuals, an understanding of Confucianism expressed not\nthrough a root reference to the founder Confucius, but instead to\nthose who followed his teachings, the Ju, or scholars. \n\nViewing Confucianism as “philosophy” began, in western studies, with\nthe Jesuit anthology, Confucius Sinarum Philosophus\n(Confucius, China’s Philosopher), published in Paris in 1687\nand dedicated to King Louis XIV. This work introduced Confucius’\nthought with high praise and selected translations from the Great\nLearning, the Analects, and the Doctrine of the\nMean. Originally published in Latin, Confucius Sinarum\nPhilosophus was soon translated into French, German, and\nEnglish. It influenced early admirers of Confucianism and Chinese\nphilosophy, as it quickly came to be known, including Gottfried\nLiebniz (1646–1716) and Voltaire (1694–1778). The anthology was also\nknown to those who later disparaged Confucianism, including\nG. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831) who remarked that Confucius’ reputation\nwould have been enhanced had his works never been\ntranslated. Regardless, Hegel never flatly denied that Confucian\nthinking merited consideration as “philosophy,” even though he did not\nregard it well. \n\nIn this article, the term “Confucian” is used in reference\nto things (people, practices, discussions, texts, etc.) that derive\nfrom or relate directly to the Analects, as well as other\nworks of ancient literature associated with the Analects and\nConfucius. The five classics of ancient China—including the\nBook of History, the Book of Changes, the Book\nof Poetry, the Book of Rites, and the Spring and\nAutumn Annals—are here considered as Confucian classics because\nthey were, for the most part, thought to have been edited by\nConfucius. While modern scholars might well doubt that claim, most\nscholars in Chinese and East Asian history accepted the traditional\naccounts crediting Confucius with having edited the classics. The term\n“Neo-Confucian” refers to thinkers, ideas, texts,\npractices, and institutions that developed out of Confucian traditions\nas they were reinterpreted in the wake of Chinese and East Asian\nencounters with Buddhism. The term “Confucian” could\nequally apply to Neo-Confucians for simplicity’s sake, though\ndifferences between Confucian and Neo-Confucian are sufficiently\nsubstantial to merit the distinction between the two groups. \n\nUnderstood most comprehensively, the importance of Confucianism in\nJapanese history is undeniable: as in China and Korea, Confucian\nphilosophizing in Japan came to define one major if not dominant layer\nof the early-modern and modern worldviews. Its lexicographic legacy is\nomnipresent in modern Japanese discourse, with Confucian terms playing\nnew roles in discourses ranging from modern philosophy to science,\nreligion, the humanities and the social sciences. One indication of\nthe importance of Confucianism to Japan today is that the modern word\nfor “university” (J: daigaku; C: Daxue) is taken\nfrom the title of the first of the four books of Neo-Confucianism, the\nDaxue (The Great Learning; J:\nDaigaku), a text that was understood as the gateway to\nlearning for adults. This legacy, incidentally, is one that originated\nin Japan, with the founding of Tokyo Imperial University and a number\nof other imperial universities including Kyoto Imperial University,\nbut soon spread throughout East Asia. The acceptance of this\ndesignation signaled the consensus among East Asian statesmen and\nintellectuals regarding the significance of Confucianism for the\nadvanced educational values of the region as well as the multifaceted\nlexicon of Confucianism as the most apt for conceptualizing and\nultimately translating modernity.\n \n\nHegel’s view that the history of philosophy included Asian philosophy\nas well as Chinese philosophy, with Confucius as the prime\nrepresentative of the latter, influenced the first definition of\n“Japanese philosophy” and “Japanese Confucian philosophy.” Between\n1884 and 1890, Inoue Tetsujirō (1855–1944), studied in\nHeidelberg and Leipzig, focusing on German Idealism and Hegel. A\ndecade after his return to Japan and appointment as the first Japanese\nprofessor of philosophy at Tokyo Imperial University, Inoue began\npublishing his monumental three-volume account of Japanese philosophy,\nthe Philosophy of the Japanese School of Wang Yangming\n(Nihon Yōmeigakuha no tetsugaku, 1900), the\nPhilosophy of the Japanese School of Ancient Learning\n(Nihon kogakuha no tetsugaku, 1902), and the Philosophy\nof the Japanese School of Zhu Xi (Nihon Shushigakuha no\ntetsugaku, 1905). Standing as Hegel’s antithesis, Inoue presented\na detailed and fairly positive account of Japanese philosophy as\nJapanese Confucianism. In doing so, Inoue suggested that well before\nthe introduction of western philosophy, Japan had developed a\nsubstantial philosophical tradition of its own, one that in terms of\nvolume and diversity compared impressively with any national tradition\nof philosophy in the west. \n\n \n\nAlthough overtly nationalistic and so not\nalways cited in contemporary scholarship on the history of philosophy\nin Japan, Inoue’s trilogy remains the first extended statement of what\nJapanese philosophical thought consisted of. Its descriptions of\nConfucian thinking as philosophical in nature decisively impacted\nlater East Asian estimations of Confucianism. Even as Inoue elevated\nJapanese Confucian thinking as philosophical, late-Qing China\nabandoned its civil service examination system which for over five\ncenturies had tested one’s mastery of Confucian texts. That Chinese\nthinkers did later recognize value in Confucianism as the most\ncompelling statement of traditional Chinese philosophy owed much,\nironically enough, to Inoue’s earlier vision of the role of Japanese\nConfucianism in the philosophical development, prior to western\ncontact, of Japan. It is no exaggeration to say that the study of\nJapanese Confucianism as philosophy began with Inoue’s trilogy. \n\nMany western scholars typically distinguish between Confucianism and\nNeo-Confucianism. As an interpretive category, Neo-Confucianism has a\nvariety of nuances but most scholars who use the term do so in\nreference to forms of Confucian philosophizing that emerged in the\nwake of Buddhism. Many of the philosophical positions that Buddhism\nendorsed had not been well addressed by earlier Confucian\nphilosophers. For example, Buddhists often affirmed that\nmetaphysically all things are empty of self-substantial being. Along\nsimilar lines, Buddhists offered a psychology of introspection claiming that the reality constructed by ordinary experience is permeated with delusions arising from egocentrism and ignorance. As such the reality of common sense is one of anguish or suffering.. As such, it is the realm of suffering. Early Confucians had not typically\ndiscussed metaphysics, apparently thinking that common sense\nassumptions about the reality of this world were not in question. As\nBuddhist estimations of reality gained a greater hearing, Confucians\nformulated a metaphysics affirming the reality of the world of\nexperience, explaining the substantial nature of the world by way of\nthe notion of ki, a term indicating the generative force that\nis the transformative stuff of all that exists in an unending process\nof becoming. In positing this metaphysics of ki along with\nvarious other ideas related to ethics, politics, spirituality, and\nhumanity, Confucian scholars expanded upon the basics of early\nConfucian thinking so much so that many modern interpreters have\nreferred to them as “Neo-Confucians.”\n \n\nConfucianism began with the teachings of Confucius, despite the fact\nthat Confucius in no way saw himself as founding a school of\nphilosophy. Arguably his foremost concern was to effect a restoration\nof the kind of socio-political order that had prevailed, at least in\nhis mind, at the beginning of the Zhou dynasty (1027–256 B.C.E.). In\nsearch of a position of influence that would enable him to contribute\nto a return to such order, Confucius traveled from realm to realm\nwithin the Zhou kingdom, hoping that his ideas about how government\nand society ought to be aligned would find an enthusiastic\npatron. Although Confucius never succeeded in this, along the way a\ngroup of interested students came to associate themselves with\nhim. For his followers Confucius appears to have emerged as much as a\nteacher as he was a political figure. While Confucius never wrote any\nindependent treatises or dialogues that were meant to serve as\nsystematic expressions of his personal ideas, over time reports about\nhis discussions with his disciples came to be recorded and edited into\na work most commonly translated as the Analects. Some\nscholars have long questioned the extent to which the\nAnalects actually represents a true and consistent expression\nof Confucius’ thought. Nevertheless, the text has been accepted\n(perhaps naively) by sufficient numbers of followers over the\ncenturies to make it, whether authentic or not, a work that must be\nread and understood by anyone hoping to develop more than a\nsuperficial appreciation of what have been received as Confucius’\nteachings. \n\nConfucius set in motion the project of\nphilosophy as a search for and love of wisdom in ancient\nChina. Shortly after his passing, around 500 B.C.E., a variety of\nphilosophical teachings emerged, including those associated with\nDaoism, Mohism, and Legalism. So many were the philosophical positions\nthat commentators of the time noted, with hyperbole, that a\n“hundred schools of thought” had appeared. Each of these\nnew developments in classical philosophy, which interestingly enough\nappeared at about the same time as did the ideas of the ancient Greek\nphilosophers, emerged at least in part as a pointed critique of the\nideas associated with Confucius. \n\nThe most original philosophical notion attributed to Confucius was,\nfirst and foremost, that of humaneness (C: ren;\nJ: jin). Though never so much clearly and concisely\nexplained as it was discussed and explored, the Analects\nsuggests that the practice of humaneness consists in not treating\nothers in a way that one would not want to be treated. Not\nsurprisingly, this notion has been characterized as the Confucian\n“golden rule,” and likened as well to Kant’s categorical\nimperative calling on people to act according to rules that they would\nbe willing to deem universal laws. The Analects situates\nhumaneness at the center of its moral philosophy, emphasizing it as\nthe most universal ethical notion. Indicative of that quintessential\nnature, almost all thinkers in East Asian history who could in any way\nbe considered “Confucian” had to address it in their own\nwritings. \n\nEqually significant in the Analects is the notion of the\njunzi (Japanese: kunshi), or the\n“prince.” The term literally refers to the “son of a\nruler,” but the\nAnalects emphasizes that anyone who cultivates himself to the\nextent that his virtue is worthy of a prince is indeed a\n“prince.” Conversely, it makes clear that those born to\nhigh standing who do not cultivate their virtue are not worthy of being\ndeemed a prince. In effect, by developing this notion, the\nAnalects was outlining an ethical perspective whereby even the\nhighest levels of the socio-political hierarchy could be critically\nassessed. \n\nPolitically, the Analects suggests that rule by moral example\nis far more effective than rule by law and the threat of\npunishment. The latter might elicit compliance, but not a sense of\nmoral conscience. Rule by virtue, on the other hand, not only brings\nforth compliance when the coercive power of the ruler is manifest, but\nalso when it is not. Confucius also emphasized the primary importance\nof language and its correct use for rightly governing the realm. In\none passage, Confucius suggests that making sure language and words\nare used correctly is the first step to good government (13/3). Without\ndenying the importance of rule by law, Confucius rejected\nnarrow-minded legalism. At one point, the Analects (13/18)\neven portrays Confucius affirming that it would be right for a father\nto conceal the crimes of a son rather than turn him over to the\nauthorities. The Analects hardly meant to endorse evasion so\nmuch as the responsibility of family members to take care of their\nkin. \n\nThe Analects is also well known for what it does not\ndiscuss: metaphysics and spiritual matters. In particular, Confucius is\nknown for asking students who wanted to hear about spiritual matters\nwhy they were interested in such topics when they had yet to master the\nmoral way of humanity. In another context, the Analects\nsuggests that Confucius revered spirits, even while keeping his\ndistance from them. These passages imply that Confucius was not so\nmuch uninterested in metaphysical issues as he was in what he considered to be more fundamental and practical moral\nteachings. \n\nConfucius’ teachings were advanced by various disciples in the\nlate-Zhou period, the most systematic being Mengzi (371–289 B.C.E.),\nknown most commonly in the west by his Latinized name, Mencius. A text\nby the same name conveys Mencius’ most important elaborations of\nConfucian philosophy. Undoubtedly the most significant contribution\nMencius made to Confucian thought was his unequivocal affirmation that\nhuman nature is, at birth, good. Confucius had observed that people are\nalike by birth, but differ in practice. However, it was not entirely\nclear how or in what sense people were actually alike. Mencius argued\nfor the inborn goodness of humanity, noting how that goodness issued\nnaturally from a mind endowed with the beginnings of humaneness,\nrighteousness, propriety, and wisdom. Yet, Mencius also acknowledged\nthat evil, all too evident in the world, resulted when people abandoned\nthe beginnings of goodness they were born with. The project of\nConfucian learning as Mencius described it was to maintain this mind of\ngoodness and recover it if lost. \n\nPolitically, Mencius defined a more aggressive and confrontational\napproach than evident in the Analects. In one passage, Mencius\nsuggests that when a ruler forsakes ethical behavior and engages in\nextreme misrule, he can and should be removed, even executed, without\nsuch amounting to regicide. In another instance, Mencius defines a more\npeople-centered understanding of legitimacy, suggesting that crucial to\nacquiring legitimate rule is the ability to win the hearts-and-minds of\nthe people. Without that, a ruler might never hope for success. Equally\nimportant was Mencius’ affirmation that legitimate government\nconsists of ethical, humane government, or renzheng (J:\njinsei). \n\nConfucius was credited, according to traditional accounts, with\nediting the various classics of ancient Chinese writing that\nsupposedly existed prior to his day. While there might be some truth\nto this attribution, the classics that were known to Chinese history\nhave been shown to derive, as a matter of textual fact, from the\nearly-Han dynasty (206 B.C.E.-220 C.E.). These classics, often\nreferred to as six in number, only consisted of some five books by Han\ntimes: the Book of Changes (Yijing); the Book of\nHistory (Shujing); the Book of Poetry\n(Shijing); the Book of Rites (Liji); the\nSpring and Autumn Annals (Chunqiu). Whatever the\ntruth of the matter, it was widely believed among later Confucians\nthat the classics they studied had been in part edited by Confucius\nand so, in subtle ways, conveyed his understandings of history,\nliterature, etiquette, and even change itself. In the Han dynasty,\nthese texts came to be studied widely as part of the expanding\n“Confucian” curriculum. After a brief but brutal\npersecution of Confucian scholars and Confucian literature during the\nQin dynasty (221–206 B.C.E.), Confucius began to emerge, during the\nHan dynasty, as the much exalted and revered sage-philosopher of\nChina, and Confucians as a more distinctly identifiable group of\nscholars. \n\nIt was also in the Han that another philosophical system, that of\nBuddhism, entered China. Following the fall of the Han, Buddhism\ngradually expanded, often in association with the ruling power of\nnon-Chinese elites. While a conspicuous presence during the Sui and\nmost of the Tang dynasties, Buddhism eventually fell victim to\nimperial persecution at the highest level and widespread ethnocentric\nreactions issuing from an increasing consciousness of the foreign\nnature of the teachings. In tandem with the reaction against Buddhism\nand all of its philosophical claims, Confucian teachings were\nvariously reasserted. In many cases, these reassertions of\nConfucianism were made along such distinctively novel lines that\nwestern scholars have referred to them as expressions of Neo-Confucian\nphilosophy. The term does have its counterparts in East Asian\ndiscourse in the form of designations such as Songxue,\n“the learning of the Song dynasty,” xinglixue,\n“the learning of human nature and principle,”\nxinxue, “the learning of the mind,” and\nlixue, “the learning of principle.” \n\nUndoubtedly the newest thing about Neo-Confucianism was its\nmetaphysics: while Confucius and Mencius had apparently assumed the\nreality of the world, they had not felt obliged to explain that\nassumption theoretically, even in passing. In the wake of Buddhism’s\nsway during much of the Tang dynasty, Neo-Confucians of the Song and\nlater dynasties explicitly accounted for the reality of the world by\npositing a generative substantial force, qi (:\nki), capable of assuming a variety of forms: liquid, solid,\nand ethereal. This generative force was the Neo-Confucian response to\nBuddhist claims regarding the essential insubstantiality of the world.\nProviding a sort of intelligible order to the world of generative force\nwas the Neo-Confucian conception of an essential rational principle (C:\nli; J: ri) inhering in all things. Together,\nrational principle and generative force constituted the basic\ningredients of a variety of expressions of the Neo-Confucian\naffirmation of the reality of the world. Theorists often differed\nregarding the priority of one notion in relation to the other, or\nwhether there was in fact any priority between them at all, but rarely\nwas it the case that later Confucian forays into metaphysical\nspeculation abandoned either of the two metaphysical ingredients\nentirely. \n\nAnother novel area of philosophical speculation was that related to\nspiritual forces. Confucius said little about them, other than that\npeople’s proper concern should be how to live in the world of humanity.\nYet following the Buddhist discourses on the afterlife, rebirth, and\nvarious heavens and hells, Neo-Confucians were compelled to articulate\nvarious understandings of the spirit world. One of the more commonly\naccepted positions defined ghosts and spirits (C:\nguishen; J: kishin) in terms of the\nspontaneous activities of yin and yang in the world.\nWithout denying that there were spiritual forces, this account provided\nfor a kind of naturalistic understanding of spiritual phenomena. \n\nNeo-Confucians were not always so innovative. Virtually all affirmed\nthe Mencian line that human nature was at birth good. Furthermore, most\nacknowledged that the mind is endowed with the four beginnings of this\ngoodness as expressed in humaneness, righteousness, propriety, and\nwisdom. Supplementing Mencius’ claims, however, many Neo-Confucians\nadded that human nature was rational principle, giving all of humanity\na common bond with the rational structure of the world, and conversely\ngiving the rational structure of reality common ground with the\nessential goodness that otherwise characterized humanity through human\nnature. \n\nThe interpenetration of the cosmos and the individual was pursued\nalong several other lines as well, perhaps most notably in the new\nexplanations of the ancient Confucian notion of humaneness in terms of\nforming one body with everything in the universe. This sort of\nmysticism, more characteristic of Daoism than classical Confucianism,\nwas one of the more distinctive features of many expressions of\nNeo-Confucianism. Clearly the theoretical insights of the later\nConfucian scholars were not formulated simply to oppose Buddhism: not a\nfew instances of Neo-Confucian philosophizing emerged as reformulations\nof appealing aspects of either Buddhism or Daoism. Such reformulations\nprompted many later critics of these innovative ideas to see in them\noffensive amounts of heterodox thinking that should have been given no\nharbor in Confucian thought. \n\nOne example of Neo-Confucians reformulating ideas and/or introspective practices\nfrom Buddhism took the form of the often practiced, albeit somewhat\ncontroversial method of meditation known as jingzuo (Japanese:\nseiza), or “quiet-sitting.” With this practice, Neo-Confucians\ndeveloped an alternative to the popular Chan (Zen) form of meditation\nknown as zuochan (Japanese: zazen). The latter was\nmeant to help the practitioner intuit the essential emptiness of the\nego, also understood as intuiting their Buddha nature, as well as the\nemptiness or insubstantiality of all things. Neo-Confucians, however,\nemphasized that the introspective moments achieved during quiet-sitting\nwould lead to a comprehensive enlightenment wherein the person realized\nclearly the essential goodness of their original nature as moral\nprinciple and its simultaneous identity with the principle informing\nall things in the universe. This understanding of the ethical unity of\nthe self and world was the ground, as Neo-Confucians understood\nquiet-sitting, not for withdrawal or inactivity but instead for a\ndynamic engagement with the world.\n \n\nWith the territorial and cultural expansion of the Han dynasty into\nwhat is today known as the Korean peninsula, the stage was set for the\nintroduction of Confucian texts and teachings into Japan by way of the\nKorean kingdom of Paekche in the mid-6th century, along with Buddhism\nand the essentials of Chinese civilization. It must be noted that an\nancient Japanese text, Records of Ancient Matters\n(Kojiki, 712), relates that earlier, Keun Ch’ogo, the ruler of\nthe kingdom of Paekche, had sent an instructor named Wani, along with a\ncopy of the Analects and another Chinese text, the\nThousand Character Classic (Qianziwen; Japanese:\nSenjimon), to the ruler of Yamato around 400 C.E. Presumably\nthe intent was that of educating the Yamato prince in Confucianism and\nthe Chinese language. Controversy surrounds this account, however,\nmaking acceptance of it problematic. Still, if nothing more, Wani was a\nfigure of considerable legendary and cultural significance who,\naccording to traditional accounts, was the first scholar-teacher of the\nAnalects to enter the Japanese islands. \n\nBy all accounts, Paekche served as an effective transmitter of\nConfucian texts and scholars in the mid-6th century. The most\nconspicuous new philosophical force conveyed by this transmission was\nthat of Buddhism, especially as represented in art and architecture.\nYet, alongside Buddhism came Confucianism, especially evident as a\nconceptually-defined philosophical system informing social, political,\nand economic relations and institutions. \n\nAn enduring early Confucian contribution to Japanese culture related\nto conceptions of historical time. In particular, it was in the wake of\nthe introduction of Buddhism that the Japanese imperial court came to\nuse nengō (C: nianhao), or “year-names,”\nas a means of counting the years within the reign of an emperor. This\nsystem had originated in China, during the Han dynasty, as emperors\nnamed the span of their rule to reflect the agenda and values they\nsought to embody. In 1912, with the founding of the Chinese republic,\nthe practice ended in China, but it is followed even today as the\nstandard means of counting years in Japan. Insofar as virtually every\none of the nengō used in Japanese history as names for\nannual time has derived from Confucian texts, there can be little\nquestion that Japanese understandings of calendric time have been\nnuanced in accordance with Confucian philosophy. \n\nMuch the same can be said about the names associated with emperors.\nThough supposedly descended from an unbroken succession of Shintō\ndeities tracing back to Izanagi and Izanami, progenitors of Amaterasu\nand Susanoo, Japanese emperors, mythic as well as historical, have\ntaken names that were distinctly Confucian in character. This\nconnection has remained throughout Japanese imperial history. In this\nrespect, the Confucian nuances of imperial names in Japan reveal\nsignificant limits of Shintō as the sole foundation for all\nthings imperial. \n\nTo an extent, ancient Japanese conceptions of space also reflected\ndistinctly Confucian nuances. Yamato and Nippon were terms used to\nrefer to the imperial realm that came to be known, in the West, as\nJapan, but when ancient Japanese spoke in the most universal terms,\nreferring not just to their own socio-political realm but to the larger\nworld, they often did so by use of the expression tenka\n(C: tianxia), or “all-below-heaven.” This term first\nappears in the ancient Confucian classical literature including in\nparticular the Book of History and Book of Changes\n(Yijing). \n\nCosmologically, the ancient Japanese explained their origins, in\npart, in terms that were noticeably Confucian. Both the Records of\nAncient Matters (Kojiki) and the Chronicles of\nJapan (Nihon shoki) open with cosmological narratives\naccounting for the origins of the world, Japan, and the Japanese\npeople. One noteworthy ingredient in the narratives was that of the\n“five processes” (C: wuxing; J:\ngogyō): wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. These\nprocesses were in effect ontological forces that unfolded in\nprogressive incremental combinations, giving in turn a particular\nmetaphysical character to a time, place, or thing, as well as a\ndiscernible dynamic rhythm to change. Not surprisingly, the cosmology\nof the Kojiki, and the Nihon shoki as well, reflects\nthe eclectic outlook of Han Confucianism. \n\nTextually, perhaps the most conspicuously Confucian-influenced writing\nof ancient Japan is the so-called “Seventeen-Article\nConstitution” (Jūshichijō kenpō)\nattributed to Prince Shōtoku (573–621). Although this document\nwas not so much a constitution in the sense of a blueprint for\ngovernment and political organization as a set of maxims meant to\nserve as standards for political society, it is clearly influenced by\nConfucianism throughout. The opening article states, “Harmony is\nto be valued,” alluding to the Analects (1/12). In most\nof the remaining articles, the Constitution advances a secular\nadvocacy of Confucian social principles such as the importance of the natural\nhierarchy informing the political realm, as well as political virtues\nsuch as loyalty, obedience, ritual decorum, impartiality, diligence,\ntrustworthiness, moderation, and public-mindedness. Though these could\nbe easily dismissed as mere platitudes, their affirmation reflected\nthe extent to which even at an early stage of political development\nConfucian notions were privileged at the very core of official\ndiscourse. \n\nThe political nomenclature that came to be used in ancient Japan,\nincluding the term, tennō, meaning\n“emperor,” also derived, at least in part, from a host of\nConfucian texts. To a large degree, Confucius and later Confucians were\nteachers who emphasized the importance of learning as both a source of\npleasure and as a means for self-cultivation and even perfection in the\nform of sagehood. Given the political orientation of Confucianism, it\nshould come as no surprise that study and learning came to be\nconsidered the prerequisites for properly governing the realm and\nbringing peace to the world. \n\nImportant political policies of ancient Japan also derived from\nConfucian philosophical teachings. The handen system of equal\nland distribution in Japan was an outgrowth of the Mencius’\naccount (3 A/3) of “humane government.” Mencius explained that people\ncannot be expected to be good law-abiding members of society if they do\nnot have the basic material needs of life including food, clothing, and\nshelter. To ensure that people have these, Mencius advocated the\n“well-field” (C: jingtian) system of land distribution,\nallotting an equal share for all families. According to Mencius, humane\ngovernment begins with this system of land distribution. Although\nimplemented in the wake of the Taika reforms of the seventh century,\nthis idealistic approach to land distribution was incrementally\ncompromised by special allowances of semi-permanent land holdings for\nBuddhist temples, Shintō shrines, aristocrats, and samurai\nrulers. Still, the very attempt at its implementation reflected the\nextent to which the ancient Japanese initially sought to realize egalitarian\nConfucian thinking about landholding as a means of establishing the\nethical foundations of political society. \n\nAnother noteworthy institution was the daigakuryō, or\nthe imperial academy, established for the education of imperial princes\nand aristocrats who were likely to be involved in government service.\nAncient Japan never followed the Chinese practice of selecting\nbureaucrats by way of civil service exams based on Confucian learning\nand its practical applications. Yet, in sponsoring the\ndaigakuryō and a variety of provincial schools modeled\non the blueprint articulated in the Confucian Book of Rites,\nancient Japan established an elite educational system centered largely\naround the study of Confucian texts and the socio-political values\nadvanced in them. \n\nFollowing the Genpei War (1180–1185), a samurai regime was\nestablished in Kamakura. Religiously and philosophically, the Kamakura\nregime was far more eager to advance the development of Rinzai Zen\nBuddhism, for example, rather than the teachings of Confucius. While\nthe latter had grown significantly during the peaceful years of\naristocratic imperial rule, they suffered for centuries during the\nmedieval period when warrior regimes preferred the arts of war as a\nmeans to power over the Confucian foundations of moral virtue and\nritual refinement. The medieval period thus witnessed a relative\neclipse of Confucianism as it came to be enveloped, at best, in a new\nsyncretic cultural order, typically dominated by either one form of\nBuddhism or another. \n\nConfucianism and Buddhism were, however, always closely interrelated\nthroughout Japanese history. The introduction of Confucianism, for\nexample, came alongside of the introduction of Buddhism. Later the\nNeo-Confucian teachings of various Song philosophers including the\nCheng brothers, Zhu Xi, and Lu Xiangshan, were introduced to Japan\nbeginning in the thirteenth century, by Zen monks who had traveled to\nChina for advanced study of Chan teachings there. For centuries, the\nteachings of the Song philosophers remained subjects of study largely\nwithin the confines of Zen monasteries, attaining no independent\nexistence or philosophical integrity apart from Zen. This should hardly\nbe surprising, given that Neo-Confucian philosophers such as Zhu Xi had\nthemselves come to develop their Confucian thinking after earlier study\nand practice of Chan Buddhism. While Zhu Xi came to criticize Buddhism,\nother Neo-Confucians did not see Buddhism as necessarily antithetical\nto Confucianism or Neo-Confucianism. Ultimately, however, many\nNeo-Confucians did come to be more distinctive and unrelenting critics\nof Buddhism than tolerant competitors. \n\nSome of the first indications of an effort to establish\nNeo-Confucian learning as an independent branch of study and practice\ncan be seen in the reigns of Emperor Hanazono (r. 1308–1318) and\nGodaigo (r. 1318–1339). Godaigo’s ill-fated Kenmu Restoration, an\nattempt at restoring full political power to the imperial line, was\ngrounded in part in his understanding of imperial authority as defined\nby Neo-Confucian texts. This complemented efforts by Watarai Shintō theorists like Kitabatake Chikafusa who, at about the same time, were trying to shore up Shintō arguments for imperial authority. Also, during the Ashikaga period, some Rinzai\nZen monks returned from study in China advocating forms of\nNeo-Confucian learning for their shoguns. And in the early 15th\ncentury, the Ashikaga shogunate established the Ashikaga Academy where\nsupposedly several thousand students of Neo-Confucian teachings\nstudied. Yet still, the students were Zen monks. \n\nIf the inclusion of Confucian icons within samurai architecture be\nconstrued as evidence of the philosophical comeback of Confucianism,\nOda Nobunaga’s (1534–1582) Azuchi Castle, featuring paintings of\nConfucius and a host of Confucian sage figures, is surely worthy of\nmention. The ultimate standing accorded Confucianism in Azuchi Castle\nsuggests that Nobunaga’s thinking was moving away from\nbattlefield strategies and toward the task of governing the realm and\nproviding for peace and order throughout, especially as he understood Buddhist institutions to be a threat rather than aid to his plans for political control. \n\nJapanese developments of Confucian philosophy are often discussed in\nrelation to the Tokugawa period (1600–1868), with scant mention of what\ncame before, other than to say that Confucian thought had been\nsubmerged earlier in an eclecticism dominated by Zen monks. Tokugawa\nConfucianism is typically described by recitation of a succession of\nnames and schools. Much of this approach to the philosophical history\nof Japanese Confucianism derives from interpretations advanced by Inoue\nTetsujirō (1855–1944), professor at Tōkyō Imperial\nUniversity, in his monumental trilogy dating from the late 19th and\nearly 20th centuries. Inoue is noteworthy for having viewed Japanese\nConfucianism as “philosophy” (tetsugaku), and for affirming\nthat Confucian scholars had set forth substantial and diverse\nphilosophical perspectives in Japan well in advance of the introduction\nof Western philosophy. \n\nVaguely following Hegelian notions of thesis, antithesis, and\nsynthesis, Inoue described the unfolding of Japanese philosophy by\nexplaining the dialectical relationships of three major philosophical\nschools: the Zhu Xi School, the Wang Yangming School, and the School\nof Ancient Learning. Ever since Inoue, Japanese Confucianism has been\nmost typically explained in terms of these three schools, as\nrepresented by a succession of philosophers associated with each,\nincluding Zhu Xi philosophers such as Fujiwara Seika (1561–1617),\nHayashi Razan (1583–1657), Yamazaki Ansai (1619–1682); Wang Yangming\nphilosophers such as Nakae Tōju (1608–1648) and Kumazawa Banzan\n(1619–1691); and so–called Ancient Learning philosophers such as\nYamaga Sokō (1622–1685), Itō Jinsai (1627–1705), and\nOgyū Sorai (1666–1728). \n\nRather than recite this interpretive schema, which in many respects,\ndespite its trilogistic appeal, simply does not accurately represent\ndevelopments of Japanese Confucianism, this essay will offer an\nalternative approach. Here, Confucian philosophy is explained as a\ndiscourse comprised of major concepts addressed by virtually all who\nwould be called Confucian philosophers. Quite typically, Japanese\nConfucians articulated their philosophical visions by defining terms\nthat were at the core of their systems. While accounts of the meanings\nof words varied widely, an easily discernible discourse developed. \n\nOverall, Japanese Confucianism from the seventeenth through the\nearly-nineteenth centuries reasserts the\nintegrity of language, meaning, and discursive truth. This reassertion\nwas made in opposition to the Buddhist view of language which was,\ndespite myriad sutras in the Tripitaka, or the Buddhist canon,\nrather negative. Or at least this was how many early-modern Japanese\nConfucians understood it. According to these Confucian critics, the\nBuddhists held that ordinary language lacked ultimate meaning and the\nability to convey absolute truth. Rather than packed with significant\nmeaning, Buddhists insisted that words were to be viewed as inherently\nempty. If wrongly understood as conveyors of substantial meaning, they\nbecame the source of profound error. Perhaps the unifying feature of\nConfucian philosophizing in the early modern period was the view that\nwords were crucially important as vehicles for substantial meaning.\nMoreover, words and their correct usage were deemed by Confucians as\nabsolutely essential to self-understanding, self-cultivation, and at\nthe grandest level, to governing the realm and bringing peace and\nprosperity to the world. In this regard, Japanese Confucian philosophy\ncan be viewed as an East Asian philosophy of language engaged in a\nsearch for right meaning. This “right meaning” was\nconsidered fundamental to any attempt to resolve philosophical\nproblems. \n\nInsofar as the ultimate achievement of Japanese Confucian\nphilosophizing amounted to a relative turn away from nominalist\nBuddhist claims about the semantic emptiness of words and the merely\nconventional nature of meaning and truth, it set the philosophical\nstage in profound ways for the conceptual assimilation of Western\nphilosophical learning during the Meiji period (1868–1912). Because it\nwas, when viewed comprehensively, a conceptual movement of enormous\nconsequence relative the development of modern philosophy in Japan,\nthe period from the seventeenth through the early-nineteenth centuries\nis referred to here as “early modern,” emphasizing its\nrole in establishing the foundations of modernity, rather than in\nterms of the more traditional terminology of historical periodization\nwhere the “Tokugawa” or “Edo” period is often\nassociated with either “late medieval” or\n“feudalistic” developments. Apart from the contributions\nof Confucian philosophy to early-modern understandings of language,\nmeaning, and discursive truth, Confucian philosophizing in Japan\nduring this period was simply not always related to or an expression\nof the interests of the Tokugawa shoguns, nor did it always issue from\nthe shogun’s capital, Edo. Thus, the terms “Tokugawa” and\n“Edo” as historical categories do not satisfactorily\nconvey the generally progressive proto-modern thrust of Confucian\nphilosophizing as a whole during this period. \nAdditionally, Japanese Confucian philosophy emerged in no small part\nin opposition to the western religion of Christianity and all that was\nassociated with it, including the threat of possible domination. While\nthis was true throughout the Tokugawa period and in the Meiji as well,\nit is nowhere more conspicuous than in an early Tokugawa work,\nEthics (Irinshō) by Matsunaga Sekigo. Writing\nshortly after the brutal defeat of the Christian-nuanced Shimabara\nRebellion of 1637–38, Sekigo used words rather than swords to combat\nwhat he viewed as the dangerous foreign heterodoxy might mean ruin to\nthe Japanese polity. Unlike the earlier debates against the Christians carried out by the Buddhists on strictly metaphysical grounds Seikigo aimed to demonstrate the superiority of Confucianism as a philosophy that was universal, in his view, and yet distinctively East Asian and Japanese in its cultural roots. Arguably,\nlater affirmations of Confucianism were meant to do much the same,\neven long after the effective threat of the spread of Christianity had\nbeen stopped by government policies such as Buddhist temple\nregistration. Somewhat similarly, in the late Meiji, Inoue\nTetsujirō defined Japanese Confucianism as Japan’s first\nphilosophy, yet he also stood as one of the most outspoken and\nvehement critics of Christianity as a system of thought that was\ninherently mistaken and completely inappropriate for\nJapanese. Throughout much of its history, Japanese Confucianism\nhas therefore implicitly if not explicitly opposed Christianity on philosophical grounds.\n\n \n\nAs various forms of Buddhism dominated the medieval period of\nJapanese philosophical history, so did Buddhist estimations of words\nand meaning come to inform the minds of many of the philosophically\ninclined. While some aspects of Rinzai Zen esteemed components of traditional Chinese arts and letters, the more central spiritual praxis was more renowned for its their anti-intellectualism. This latter stance was well\nexpressed in the use of kōan, or paradoxical exchanges\nmeant to facilitate realization of Buddha-nature. The gist of the Zen\nteachings was that words, at best, are mere conventions useful for\neveryday communication. The transitory, insubstantial way of things\n(suchness or emptiness) cannot be adequately captured by the fixed\nmeanings of conventional language. When transmitted from teacher to\ndisciple, the highest level of truth could only be conveyed in a\nmind-to-mind transmission, one that typically eluded simple\ndiscursive language. \n\nGenerally speaking, the Neo-Confucian position of early-modern Japan\nwas defined in opposition to assertions of the semantic emptiness or\nradical nominalism so often advanced by Buddhists. While the\nNeo-Confucian affirmation that words convey significant meaning might\nseem commonplace, it was hardly so at the juncture of Japan’s\nmedieval and early modern history. Indeed, the rise of Neo-Confucian\ndiscourse in the Tokugawa should be understood as a reassertion of the\nmeaningfulness of language and its ultimate value in relation to any\nunderstandings of truth. \n\nAn early expression of the Neo-Confucian belief in the ultimate\nvalue of language and meaning was made by Hayashi Razan in the preface\nto his colloquial rendition of Chen Beixi’s (1159–1223) The\nMeanings of Neo-Confucian Terms (Xingli ziyi).\nIncidentally, the latter text can easily be interpreted as a sustained\nreaffirmation of the correct meanings of terms in the wake of an age of\nsemantic skepticism, and as a defense of Confucian realism over rampant\nBuddhist nominalism. That Razan devoted much of his final years to\nauthoring a lengthy colloquial explication of Beixi’s Ziyi\nspeaks volumes about his view of the importance of language. In his\npreface, Razan explained the crucial nature of language by reasoning\nthat “the minds of the sages and worthies are manifest in their words,\nand their words are found in their writings. Unless we understand the\nmeanings of their words, how can we comprehend the minds of the sages\nand worthies?” Elsewhere Razan emphasized that people could never\nrealize the minds of the sages and worthies in themselves unless they\nfirst understood the remarks of the sages and worthies as recorded in\nthe words of texts communicating them. \n\nRazan even suggested that thorough immersion in the words of the\nsages was the best way to achieve a kind of comprehensive, mystic\nenlightenment experience. Thus when asked about the methods involved in\nthe study of words, Razan explained, \n\nRazan was hardly alone in emphasizing the semantic integrity of\nwords. Itō Jinsai’s most comprehensive philosophical text, the\nGomō jigi (The Meaning of Words in the Analects and\nMencius), articulates both a defense of the meaningfulness of\nwords, and in-depth, systematic analyses of the meanings of some two\ndozen high-level philosophical terms. In his preface to the\nGomō jigi, Jinsai explained his pedagogical approach in\nterms of the study of language and meaning. There he stated, \n\nJinsai’s emphasis on semantic etymology and philological instruction\nwas meant to offset Buddhist training and presuppositions: he wanted\nhis students to recognize the difference between Buddhist terms with\ntheir various nuances and those of Confucianism. In particular Jinsai\nwas offended to see so many seemingly Buddhist terms in Neo-Confucian\ndiscourse. In an attempt to rid such terms from Neo-Confucianism,\nJinsai took great pains to document the heterodox lineages of words so\nthat they could be eliminated from Neo-Confucian writings. \n\nBrief introductory essays defending the ability of language to refer\nto reality are relatively common in early-modern Neo-Confucianism.\nOgyū Sorai’s (1666–1728) Benmei (Distinguishing\nNames), presents an even more in-depth analysis of philosophical\nterminology than Jinsai’s Gomō jigi. In the preface to\nhis Benmei, Sorai highlighted the political edge intrinsic to\nlanguage and meaning, at least as understood by many Confucians and\nNeo-Confucians alike. After allowing that some words are coined by\ncommoners, Sorai emphasized that the more abstract and philosophical\nterms are the very ones articulated by sages for the sake of\ninstructing people in the foundations of civilized life. Sorai then\nadded that because these terms convey such powerful teachings, princes\nare cautious in using them. \n\nSorai next alludes to a passage from the Analects (13/3)\nwhich relates that Confucius had said that if given charge of the\ngovernment of a state, his first priority would be correcting the\nmeanings and usages of words. When asked the reason for this, Confucius\nreplied in effect that socially and politically, all else depends upon\ncorrect usage of language. Without that, there would be no limits to\nwhich people might go. Sorai proceeds to sketch his understanding of\nthe problems related to philosophical meaning in his day, adding that\nhis intent in authoring the Benmei was to understand the right\nrelationships between words and things so that the minds of the sages\ncould be fathomed. \n\nIn essence, Sorai believed that by rightly defining words he was\nproviding the foundations for the integrity of a rightly governed\nsocial and political order. Ultimately, then, Confucians and\nNeo-Confucians in their repeated reaffirmations of the importance of\nlanguage and meaning were not simply indulging in philological\nexercises or arcane semantic research. Instead, they were engaged in an\neffort to recover the way (C: dao/J:\nmichi) for the sake of establishing a means to sagely truth,\nand a ground for a righteous political order. \n\nMany other examples of the Confucian reassertion of meaning in\nthe early-modern period could be given. Suffice it to say that the\nconcern for language so evident in Confucian writings reflected both a\nprofound turn away from what they considered to be the empty talk of\nBuddhists, especially Zen Buddhists, and toward a concern for defining\nthe conceptual bases for a well-ordered society. The need to defend the\nintegrity of language gradually subsided as Japanese thinkers\nincreasingly recognized the importance of words and meaning for\nphilosophical analysis. This reinforced an emphasis on linguistic truth\nand meaning as a means for providing political order, an emphasis that\ncontinued well into the modern period.\n \n\nAn important Neo-Confucian contribution to the philosophical\nconsciousness of early-modern Japan was its metaphysical account of the\nworld of ordinary experience as fully real. Early in the Tokugawa period, Hayashi Razan was\namong the leaders of those Japanese theorists who reiterated, with some\ndistinctive variations, the metaphysical accounts synthesized by Zhu Xi\nduring late-Song China. Essentially, this metaphysics explained reality\nin terms of two components, ri (“principle” or\n“pattern”) and ki (“generative force”).\nRi referred to the rational and moral order of things\ngenerally, as well as that of each and every thing in terms of their\nparticulars. In Razan’s view, there is a ri for each aspect of\nexistence, making all particulars what they are in actuality. At the\nsame time, there is an essential universal element in ri that\ndefined a larger realm of commonality in terms of what things can potentially be.\nThus, for example, the human nature that defines all people as people\nis referred to as ri, indicating that the rational order\nintegral to humanity is shared in common. But more importantly, there\nis a normative, moral side of ri which makes it as much an\nethical aspect of existence as it is a rational one. In the case of\nhumanity, as well as virtually all of the ten-thousand things of the\ncosmos, ri is defined as morally good. This affirmation means,\nin the case of humanity, that human nature is good. Viewed in the\nperspective of all things existing between heaven and earth, the\ngoodness of ri means that the world as such is also ethically\ngood by nature and in terms of what it is to become as well. No doubt\nevil enters in, but that is not the original state, nor should it be\nthe ultimate fate of things. \n\nThe other component of reality, that of ki, accounts for\nthe substantial, creative reality of all that exists in the world.\nKi is the vital, transformative stuff of all that exists,\nincluding things that are solid, liquid, and gaseous. This ki\nis described variously in terms of its clarity or turbidity, but\ninvariably things that exist have it as their substantial being. Simply\nput, nothing exists without ki. In certain respects,\nNeo-Confucian philosophers such as Zhu Xi and Razan affirmed that\nki was the stuff of reality in order to counter the Buddhist\nclaim that all things are insubstantial or empty. While admitting that\nthings are not always as they might seem, Neo-Confucians typically\naffirmed that there was a substantial basis even behind the illusory and ephemeral. \n\nGenerally speaking, Razan and other Neo-Confucian philosophers who\naffirmed the duality of ri and ki added that it was\nimpossible for there to be ri without ki, or\nki without ri. In reality, the two were absolutely\ninseparable. Yet there were moments of equivocation, especially while\nanalyzing the two notions, when Razan, following a long line of\nNeo-Confucian philosophers including Zhu Xi himself, emphasized the\npriority of ri over ki. No sooner was this broached,\nhowever, than it was also denied, with the appended insistence that one\ncould not exist without the other. Nevertheless, later critics of the\nmore standard Neo-Confucian line rarely bypassed the opportunity to\ncriticize at length those who privileged ri over\nki. \n\nItō Jinsai was one such critic. It would be easy to conclude\nthat since Jinsai differed with orthodox Neo-Confucians such as Zhu Xi\nand their Japanese exponents, including Razan and others, that he was\nnot a Neo-Confucian himself. There can be no doubt that Jinsai was not\nan orthodox, Zhu-Xi style Neo-Confucian. But then being a Neo-Confucian\ndid not necessarily mean that one had to agree with Zhu Xi on all\ncounts. Indeed Neo-Confucians often criticized one another to no end,\nbut nonetheless remained Neo-Confucians. Doubt, questioning, and rigorous critique were at the heart of\nNeo-Confucianism as a philosophical movement. Jinsai’s inclusion of a\nmetaphysics of ki and ri, along with his critical\ndisagreement with Zhu Xi over their relative priority, arguably made\nhim an exemplary Neo-Confucian. Certainly, there was scant ground for\nsuch a systematic metaphysics as Jinsai affirmed in any of the ancient\ntexts, especially the Analects and Mencius, that he\notherwise identified with. In this respect, the common\ncharacterization of Jinsai as an “ancient learning”\n(kogaku) philosopher who simply rejected Neo-Confucianism is\nmisleading. \n\nRather than a dualism of generative force and principle, Jinsai\naffirmed an ostensible monism of ki, one which held that\nnothing existed other than ki. Yet Jinsai did not deny that\nthere is ri in the world: rather, he simply subordinated it to\nki, suggesting that while only ki exists, ri\ndwells within ki. Apart from its embedded nature within\nki, ri has neither priority nor independent\nontological status of any sort. It is wholly enveloped within\nki. In making these claims, Jinsai was in effect rebalancing\nthe more orthodox but often ambiguous Neo-Confucian metaphysics, away\nfrom its more standard equivocation hesitantly favoring some sort of\nprior status for ri by insisting in a more thoroughgoing\nmanner a monism of generative force. \n\nA corollary of Jinsai’s outspoken subordination of principle within\ngenerative force was his denial of the relatively orthodox\nNeo-Confucian claim that human nature is united in morally good\nri. Rather than a universalistic affirmation of the goodness\nof human nature, Jinsai emphasizes the diversity of human nature as a\nperson’s inborn disposition, ranging from good to bad. Needless to say,\nJinsai saw the Cheng-Zhu claim that human nature is principle, or\nri, as profoundly mistaken. After all, in Jinsai’s view,\nri, which as a written word depicts the veins in a piece of\njade, was a “dead word,” i.e., one that refers to an inanimate\norder not typically associated with the vitality of the human world. In\ncontrast to ri, Jinsai extolled michi, or the way, as\na “living word,” i.e., one which symbolized the dynamism of human\nactivity. \n\nJinsai and Sorai both criticized the Neo-Confucian metaphysical\nnotion of principle, stating that rather than a word with ancient, and\ntherefore legitimate, Confucian origins, ri was a term that\nhad derived in part from Daoist and Buddhist discourse and so was often\nwrongly construed in Neo-Confucian discussions out of ignorance of, or\ndisregard for, the sanctity of the original teachings of Confucianism.\nJinsai’s standard on this count was supposedly the lexicon of the\nAnalects and Mencius, while Sorai’s was the more\nancient Six Classics. Despite their disagreements on the level\nof antiquity that should be considered as the source of legitimate\nphilosophical discourse, both agreed that principle was a problematic\npart of it and so should not be naively highlighted in metaphysical\ndiscussions. \n\nJinsai and Sorai’s critiques notwithstanding, the metaphysics of\nri and ki came to enjoy a degree of philosophical\ndomination in the remainder of the early modern period, especially\namong orthodox Neo-Confucians. Although often modified in one respect\nor another, the dualism of substantial, energetic generative force and\nrational, ethical order seemed like a compelling and sufficient account\nfor the diversity of experience. Not surprisingly, both ri and\nki were appropriated in any number of neologisms of the Meiji\nperiod to refer to terms from western philosophy and the sciences as\nthey were translated into Japanese. One example is the word “logic,” or\nronri in Japanese. The word ronri, when considered\nnot as a unified word but as two words that can be read apart,\nindicates “discussions (ron) of principle (ri),” a\ntypically Neo-Confucian activity. Although there were Huayan Buddhist usages of these terms, when the modern lexicon of theoretical discourse crystalized in the Meiji period, it was the Neo-Confucian usages that were then most relevant to the new terms coined such as ronri.\n \n\nOne of the more distinctive features of the various expressions of\nNeo-Confucian philosophy in early-modern Japan was their shared\nemphasis on the importance of doubt in learning. Chinese philosophers\nfrom the Song dynasty, from Zhang Zai (1020–1077) through Zhu Xi,\nemphasized the need for doubt and skepticism in relation to achieving\nany real progress in philosophical learning. In Japan, doubt came to\nhave notable advocates, first with Hayashi Razan, one of the earliest\nand most consistent advocates of Neo-Confucianism, and later with\nKaibara Ekken (1630–1714), to the end a professed Neo-Confucian, but\none who advanced one of the most systematic expressions of\nphilosophical doubt in the early-modern period. With Razan and Ekken,\nskepticism was never an end in itself, but rather a significant\nwaypoint on the way toward coming to more solid conclusions\nregarding philosophical questions, and indeed, all matters related to\ninformed engagement in this world. \n\nOne of Ekken’s most famous texts, the Taigiroku, is an\naccount of his professed doubts about the validity of the teachings of\nZhu Xi. Ekken opens his work by quoting Lu Xiangshan (1139–1192), Zhu\nXi’s contemporary, who observed, “In learning, a person should be\nworried when he has no doubts. If he has doubts, then progress follows.\nAs a result, he will learn something.” Zhu Xi made the case for\ndoubting along similar lines, noting, “Those with major doubts make\nmuch progress. Those with minor doubts make little progress. Those\nwithout doubts make no progress.” Such remarks relating to the need for\ndoubt and its resolution were quoted and paraphrased repeatedly by\nRazan, Ekken, and a number of others, as they sought to realize higher\nlevels of philosophical confidence or even certitude regarding their\npositions. \n\nOne reason for the invitation to doubt extended by Neo-Confucians\nseems to have been their realization that many Neo-Confucian tenets,\nespecially metaphysical ones, were profoundly novel. Upon first hearing\nthese new ideas, students might have many questions before they could\naccept them. So, the Neo-Confucians typically encouraged students to\nask questions and reflect critically on the matters prompting their\ndoubts. By doing so, the critical spirit so often associated with\nphilosophy as a discipline in the West was clearly instilled in the\nearly-modern students of Neo-Confucian thought. There can be little\nquestion that the number of extended critiques of Neo-Confucian\nthinking in the early-modern period were in part an outgrowth of the\ninvitation to doubt advocated by proponents of Neo-Confucianism. Far\nfrom a rigid and unchanging orthodoxy that allowed for little if any\nquestioning and doubt, Neo-Confucianism actively engaged doubt as a\nprerequisite to progress in learning.\n \n\nConfucian philosophy in Japan, ancient, medieval, and early-modern,\nis often caricatured as a teaching of loyalty and trustworthiness, that\nis, one suited to authoritarian rulers and obedient subjects, as well\nas warrior-lords and their samurai followers. No doubt loyalty and\ntrustworthiness were integral to the Confucian ethic, but equally\nimportant were more universal ethical prescriptions such as humaneness\n(jin). Humaneness was described variously, but most often\nassociated with the injunction not to do to others what one would not\nwant done to oneself. Humaneness might well be deemed the most\nquintessential of all Confucian and Neo-Confucian virtues. While\nNeo-Confucians affirmed the ancient and fundamental meaning of\nhumaneness as the “golden rule,” they added substantially to the\nmeaning of humaneness by suggesting that being truly humane led one to\nbecome mystically one body with everything in existence. While such a unity was grounded substantially in the single generative force constituting all reality (ichigenki), it was equally a function of recognizing other selves as oneself, and other entities, sentient or not, as part of a cosmic, familial continuum of essential oneness and wholeness. Moreover, the unity reflected one’s immersive participation in the generative activities of heaven and earth, and ultimate identification with the all-inclusive unity of the limitless creative potential of the cosmos. At a more rationalistic level, this unity was equally grounded in a cognitive grasp of the rational principles defining human nature’s goodness and the core ethical goodness of all things and their limitless becoming. \n\nAnother ethical notion crucial to Confucian and Neo-Confucian ethics\nwas that of gi, or justice. Often translated as\n“righteousness” and “rightness,” gi\nalso conveys a sense, in some contexts, of duty, responsibility, and\nobligation. To affirm that something or someone is gi\namounted to ethical praise of the highest order, while denying the\nsame meant virtual condemnation.\nGi was often combined with humaneness to form the compound,\njingi, indicating humaneness and justice, inherently political\nvirtues that established the clear legitimacy of a regime embodying\nthem. \n\nFrom Mencius forward, fidelity to gi was often defined in\nterms of one’s willingness to sacrifice one’s life if realization of\ngi and one’s continued existence could not be realized in\ntandem. One of the most famous debates of the Tokugawa period centered\naround an incident occurring in 1703 concerning a group of forty-seven\nsamurai who had been left masterless (rōnin) due to the\nshogun’s forcing the suicide of their lord. The question was\nwhether the rōnin were acting according to gi\nin taking revenge upon the man who had, in the first place, prompted\ntheir deceased lord to commit the offense that led to his being\ncondemned to self-destruction. Clearly, the issue was not the legal one\nof whether the rōnin obeyed or disobeyed the law, but\ninstead the moral one of whether they acted on the basis of a sense of\nrightness and justice. Opinions varied, of course, but that the debate\nwas widespread and meaningful reveals the extent to which Neo-Confucian\nethical notions such as gi had become integral, substantive\nfactors in public discourse in early-modern Japan.\n \n\nThe early-modern Neo-Confucians commonly described mind as the\nmaster of the body. All of the body’s activities are under the\ncontrol of the mind. As a combination of ri (principle)\nand ki (generative force), the mind can serve as the master of\nthe body because of its capacity for clear and unclouded intelligence.\nDue to the ri within it, the mind is originally good. Though\nevil might intrude into its workings, the mind’s original state\nis one of ethical goodness. \n\nThe Neo-Confucian position may not seem particularly profound unless\nwe consider the Buddhist position it opposes. Namely, some Buddhists\nheld that the discriminating mind is essentially empty and the seat, in everyday\ncognition, of delusion and ignorance. Rather than dismissing the everyday mind\nas the source of error, or advocating the realization of a mind that is\n“no-mind,” Neo-Confucians sought to describe the mind as a real,\nsubstantial entity in which intelligible ethical and rational\nprinciples indwelled, enabling humanity to know both what is, and what\nis right. The knowledge provided by the mind was not considered\ndelusional or unreal, but rather as real as any could possibly be.\nInsofar as the principles that dwell within the mind are identical with\nthose pervading the external world, the mind became the foundation for\na mystic union with all existent things. \n\nOften the mind was discussed in relation to the feelings issuing\nfrom it. Most Neo-Confucians considered human feelings—pleasure,\nanger, sorrow, fear, love, hate, and desire—to issue from the mind\nwhen it encounters things. As long as these feelings are expressed in\naccord with principle, they are considered natural outgrowths of the\nmind. If manifested insufficiently or to excess, the feelings are\njudged to be negative and in need of control. So as to enable the mind\nto master itself appropriately, Neo-Confucians sometimes advocated a\nZen-like practice called “quiet-sitting.” Essentially a\nmeditation upon one’s original, moral nature, quiet-sitting perceives\nthe calmness and stillness of the mind before its engagement with the\nworld of activity. The latter was typically seen as a source of\noverstimulation, one which could easily distract or distort the\nmind. If properly practiced, quiet-sitting could enable one to engage\nin any activity without overstepping or falling short in terms of\nemotive reactions. Such a mind was viewed as one well-regulated in\naccordance with the mean. \n\nNeo-Confucian critics such as Itō Jinsai and Ogyū Sorai\nobjected to characterizations of the mind in terms of\n“stillness” and “calmness,” asserting that\nthose attributes harked back to Buddhism or Daoism, not\nConfucianism. Whereas their criticisms had some merit, previous\northodox Neo-Confucians such as Hayashi Razan had insisted that the\nConfucian usage of terms such as “stillness” and\n“calmness” meant something profoundly different from what\nwas meant by Buddhists and Daoists. Ultimately, Razan insisted, the\nmind is an active thing, meant to be engaged in ongoing relations with\nthe world at large and so, “stillness” is being poised for\nengagement, rather than an end in itself.\n \n\nOne of the many terms used in East Asian philosophical discussions to\nrefer generally to the ideas of the Song philosophers of the Cheng-Zhu\ntradition and their exponents in later dynastic periods, was\nseirigaku (C: xinglixue), or “the school\nof human nature and principle.” The two words “human\nnature” (C: xing; J: sei) and\n“principle” (C: li; J: ri)\nwere joined in part as a reflection of the Neo-Confucian\nidentification of human nature with principle. In Japan, this\nposition, equating human nature and principle, was affirmed by\northodox proponents of the Cheng-Zhu teachings such as Hayashi Razan\nand later, Yamazaki Ansai and their followers. In many respects, their\naccounts of human nature can be construed as an egalitarian\naffirmation of the commonly shared nature of all people. The grammar\nof most statements asserting the identity of human nature and\nprinciple support this understanding: they leave little room for doubt\nthat orthodox Cheng-Zhu thinkers were saying that all people have the\nsame human nature, and that that human nature is principle. To the\nextent that they explained the myriad differences in humanity, they\ndid so by reference to variations in the clarity or turbidity of the\ngenerative force (ki) of particular individuals. \n\nThe ethical nuance assigned to human nature was a function of the\nCheng-Zhu understanding of principle in both positive and normative\nterms. Not only did principle indicate what “is,” it also\nreferred to what “ought to be” in a particular entity. In\nall matters, including human nature, principle was considered to be\nmorally good. Thus at the macrocosmic level, the world of ordinary life was\nviewed not as the Buddhists saw it in terms of delusion, error, and\nanguish, but rather as the bountiful and morally good creation of\nheaven and earth, leading to the on-going production and reproduction\nof the ten-thousand things of the world in which we live. At the\nmicrocosmic level, rather than stressing human thoughts and feelings\nas given to attachments leading to one painful rebirth after another,\nthe orthodox early-modern Neo-Confucians viewed the person as\nethically good by virtue of their human nature. Those with clear\ngenerative force perhaps better understood and manifested the goodness\nof their human nature, while those with more turbid generative force\ndid so less aptly. Nevertheless, with education and effort all could\nperfect themselves so as to realize fully the original goodness of\ntheir human nature. The human ideal of sagehood, more sought after\nthan perhaps ever actually realized, was recognized as one that all\ncould, with sufficient effort, achieve. \n\nThe orthodox Neo-Confucian explanation of human nature was\nfrequently affirmed in early-modern Japan, especially in\nphilosophically informed circles. However, those circles tended to be\npopulated by individuals representing hereditary, status-bound social\nestates. At the top of the social system were the aristocrats of the\nancient imperial capital, Kyōto, including the imperial family.\nYet, during the Tokugawa period, the aristocracy was both respected and\ncontrolled by the samurai leadership exercising coercive governing\npower. Apart from the aristocracy, which was by and large restricted to\nthe ancient imperial capital, the samurai were at the top of the\nsecular social system. Below them were peasant farmers, then artisans,\nand finally merchants. Shintō and Buddhist clergy, often defined\nby hereditary lines as well, were esteemed as outside the secular\nsocial system. Thus, in practice, there was precious little\negalitarianism in the early-modern social system. \n\nReflecting the inequalities of the day, Itō Jinsai challenged\nthe orthodox Neo-Confucian view by asserting that human nature is\nsimply the physical disposition (kishitsu) that each person\nis born with. In formulating this view, Jinsai was essentially\nagreeing with Dong Zhongshu (ca. 179–104 B.C.E.), who defined human\nnature as “the inborn disposition” of each person. But\nJinsai also sympathized with the thinking of Zhou Dunyi (1017–1073), a\nSong philosopher who is often considered an early exponent of the\nNeo-Confucian philosophy that found its most complete form in the\nthought of Zhu Xi. Zhou Dunyi differentiated five natures including\nthe morally strong, the immorally strong, the morally weak, the\nimmorally weak, and the mean which relies on neither strength or\nweakness. \n\nJinsai did not seek to advance Zhou’s position as much as to expand\nit into a recognition of the manifold diversity of human natures. A\nscholar by profession, Jinsai’s own social standing was that of a\ntownsperson, presumably of merchant background. The orthodox\nNeo-Confucian egalitarian position was at odds with the official\nhierarchy, but so was Jinsai’s view insofar as it affirmed a far\nmore individualized diversity than the established hierarchy allowed.\nThough Jinsai’s theory of human nature as innate, individual physical\ndisposition was reformulated by Ogyū Sorai, it did not achieve\nwide acceptance in early-modern Japan. Despite the extent to which it\nwas at odds with reality, Confucian pronouncements on human nature in\nthe early-modern period tended to repeat the Neo-Confucian line that\nhuman nature, as principle (ri), is morally good.\n \n\nThere is always a political nuance to Confucian philosophizing.\nConfucius himself first sought to offer his teachings to a ruler,\nthinking that they would provide an effective solution to the\npolitical crises of his times. The human ideal extolled by Confucius\nwas that of the junzi (J: kunshi), or the\n“son of a ruler” that is, a “prince.” (Some\ntranslators have rendered this term as “gentleman,”\n“noble person,” or “exemplary person.”) But\nfor Confucius, the true prince was not one born to the\nposition. Rather, Confucius most admired the person who cultivated\nhimself to such a point that he embodied a host of virtues associated\nwith royal birth. Confucius had little use for the person who was born\nto that station but neglected the task of self-cultivation. Such a\nperson, in Confucius’ view, hardly merited the standing accorded by\nbirth. This understanding of the true prince implied that those born\nto high rank must strive to earn, through self-cultivation, the kind\nof respect and right to exercise power otherwise associated with their\nstanding. \n\nMencian political thought was grounded in the view that government\nought to be humane, and provide for the best interests of humanity. In\nthis context, the ruler was characterized as the parent of the people,\nand his subjects as his own children, emphasizing the importance that\nhe should attach to their welfare. Mencius at points explained success\nin governing as a matter of gaining the hearts-and-minds of the people\nat large, suggesting that without popular support rule would not be\neffective. In addressing questions related to instances in the past\nwhere tyrants had been executed, Mencius argued that there had been no\ninstances of regicide. Instead, those put to death had been common\ncriminals, having forfeited their legitimacy by their very mistreatment\nof people. Implied, of course, was that rulers who did the same might\nbe legitimately dealt with in a similar manner. \n\nGiven the conditional perspective that Confucianism affirmed in\nrelation to governing, it is not surprising that Confucian teachings\ntended to circulate first and foremost among the ruling elite\nthroughout most of Japanese history. After all, had they had a wider\ncirculation, the political implications might have resulted in even\nmore challenges to those in power than actually occurred. Even more\nproblematic than the views of Confucius and Mencius were those in the\nBook of Historical Documents related to the notion of\ntianming (J: tenmei), or “the mandate of\nheaven.” According to numerous passages in the History, if a\nruler repeatedly abandoned his concern for the people, heaven would\neventually give the mandate to rule to a new line, one that\ndistinguished itself on the basis of concern for the people. In this\nprocess, the role of the people was instrumental. One passage in the\nHistory even states that heaven and the people are nearly the\nsame: “heaven sees with the eyes of the people, and hears with the ears\nof the people.” \n\nThere can be no question that this notion entered Japan, as surely\nas the classical literature of China did. That the tianming\nnotion attained no wide circulation reflects the extent to which\nConfucian political teachings in particular were restricted to the\nruling elite rather than taught to the population at large. It must be\nadded, however, that as Confucian learning became more widespread, even\nthe peasantry began to understand the basics of Confucian political\nthought and developed clear expectations regarding humane government.\nEarly-modern peasant protest movements and uprisings were often\ngrounded in the notion that righteous and humane rulers ought to\nprovide for the just interests of society as a whole. When such\nexpectations were not fulfilled, it was not uncommon for peasants to\nmake their dissatisfaction evident through remonstration and\nrebellion. \n\nBy comparison with the ancient, foundational writings, Neo-Confucian\npolitical philosophy was far more concerned with the project of\nensuring that the ruler understood the benefits of self-cultivation.\nOne of the most pertinent texts, the Great Learning (C:\nDaxue; J: Daigaku), outlines how a ruler\nshould proceed if he wishes to manifest luminous virtue, noting that\nthe project most fundamentally involves self-cultivation. For the\nlatter to be realized, the ruler must first make his mind correct and\nhis thoughts sincere. To realize this project, he must extend his\nunderstanding of things by studying and investigating them. If those\nruling could cultivate themselves in this way, then they would find\ntheir families well ordered, their states well governed, and all below\nheaven enjoying great peace. Effective rule was thus cast as a matter\nof self-cultivation on the part of those ruling. This was the central\npolitical philosophy taught by orthodox Neo-Confucians such as Hayashi\nRazan, Yamazaki Ansai and their followers in Tokugawa Japan. \n\nOne major challenge to this approach came from Ogyū Sorai.\nAccording to Sorai, the orthodox Neo-Confucian position was impractical\nbecause it was based on the assumption that the human mind can control\nitself. In Sorai’s view, this was simply impossible because it would\nentail dividing the mind into two entities: the controlling mind and\nthe controlled mind. Rather than expect the mind to control the mind,\nSorai appealed to the Book of History and its teaching that\nthe rites of “the early kings” be used to control not only the mind,\nbut the socio-political realm at large. Sorai claimed that his\nphilosophy was based on a correct reading of the ancient classics,\nespecially the Book of History, but it is clear that he leaves\na great deal out. Most particularly, he passes over the\ntianming notion completely, even though it is at the very core\nof the Book of History. Sorai also extolled the rites and\nmusic and their effectiveness for ruling, but never provided great\nclarity regarding what these included. Moreover, he repeatedly praised\n“the early kings” as the only sages who had and would ever exist in\nhuman history. The sagehood of the early kings was a function of their\nhaving established the way of social and political organization, a way\nthat could never be surpassed, only followed. Sorai identified that\nway, “the way of the sages,” as consisting in the rites and\nmusic, as well as the laws and bureaucratic forms necessary for good\ngovernment. \n\nUltimately, it seems that Sorai’s political philosophy meant to\nextol in later history those who stood as the representatives of the\nearly kings. For him, these were the samurai ruling elite of his day,\nand their imposition of rites, laws, and administrative government as a\nmeans of implementing the greatest peace and prosperity for the\ngreatest number. Sorai surely had little faith in the efficacy of\ninternal means of self control; instead, he consistently advocated\nexternal strategies such as rites and music, penal laws, and\nadministrative government as the means for providing, along utilitarian\nlines, for the welfare of all. \n\nSorai’s political philosophy, though one of the most systematic\nstatements offered during the early-modern period, was never fully\naccepted as the philosophy of the ruling elite, despite the fact that\nthat seems to have been Sorai’s explicit intent. Rather, his political\nphilosophy ended up being viewed as a heterodox alternative, one much\nakin to that of Xunzi in ancient China.\n \n\nA most important contribution of Neo-Confucianism to early-modern\nJapanese culture was its emphasis on education at virtually all levels.\nOrthodox Neo-Confucianism viewed learning as one of the most basic\nmethods of self-cultivation, one that contributed positively to the\nfull realization of a person’s morally good human nature. At the\nhighest level, education and learning were considered integral\ncomponents in the realization of a well-governed state and peace\nthroughout the world. \n\nAccording to Zhu Xi, learning involved most basically the process of\nemulation. This account of learning came to be widely endorsed in\nearly-modern Japan, even by heterodox thinkers such as Itō Jinsai\nand Ogyū Sorai. The model that Jinsai used in explaining learning\nas emulation was that of calligraphy. In learning to write, a student\nis presented with the example of his teacher, and then is expected to\nemulate it. Sustained efforts at emulation lead eventually to\ncomprehension and the ability of the student to perform thoughtfully\nthe task that has been learned. \n\nWhile the practice of learning as emulation was widely endorsed,\nearly-modern philosophers disagreed over the subject matter of education.\nOrthodox Neo-Confucians typically emphasized broad learning in the\nancient classics and historical literature, but most importantly they\nextolled the value of studying the Four Books and Zhu Xi’s\ncommentaries on them. Reflecting the orthodox Neo-Confucian value\nplaced on education is the first of the Four Books, the\nGreat Learning . Described as the “gateway” to all subsequent\nlearning, the Great Learning outlines the series of methods to\nbe mastered in order for a person to manifest luminous virtue. In this\nprocess, the investigation of things is preliminary. With such\ninvestigation, our understanding of things becomes complete and our\nthoughts sincere. Then, our minds are rectified. With this comes the\nrealization of a cultivated self, one capable of regulating families,\ngoverning states, and bringing peace to the world. \n\nOrthodox Neo-Confucians viewed the Great Learning as a work\nfor mature students. To provide for the most widely educated society\npossible, other texts, such as the Elementary Learning,\naddressed topics for younger minds. In early-modern Japan, the\nNeo-Confucian emphasis on education also led to the formulation of a\ncurriculum for women, as is evident in the Great Learning for\nWomen (Onna daigaku), attributed to Kaibara Ekken, the\nElementary Learning on Samurai Teachings (Bukyō\nshōgaku) by Yamaga Sokō, and other educational works\nfor townspeople and farmers. \n\nHeterodox thinkers such as Jinsai and Sorai often challenged\northodox Neo-Confucians on matters related to the texts elevated for\nstudy. Jinsai in particular affirmed that the most important works for\nstudents were the Analects of Confucius and the\nMencius. Distancing himself considerably from the orthodox\nposition, Jinsai offered a series of arguments seeking to prove, on\ntextual and philosophical grounds, that the Great Learning was\nnot a Confucian text. While he admitted that there was value in the\nstudy of the ancient classics, Jinsai believed that the\nAnalects and Mencius were by and large sufficient for\nmeaningful education. \n\nBy contrast, Ogyū Sorai emphasized the efficacy of studying\nthe Six Classics. In Sorai’s view, the Six Classics\nconveyed the words of the sages predating Confucius. He considered\ntheir words unique insofar as they enabled humanity to fathom the minds\nof the sages themselves. Sorai did value texts such as the\nAnalects, but decidedly less so. After all, Sorai reasoned,\nConfucius had not been fully a sage, at least not in his strictest\nsense of the term. For him, the sages were those ancient figures who\nhad established the basic way of socio-political civilized life, the\nway that Confucius later championed as a transmitter. Yet, far more\nthan learning through books, Sorai valued learning gained through\npractice in following the way. With this kind of performative learning,\nstudents were expected to come gradually to realize a full level of\npractical knowledge: knowing how to do something rather than knowing\nthat something is the case. \n\nThe proliferation of education in early-modern Japan, producing\nmid-nineteenth-century literacy rates comparable to those of the most\nadvanced Western nations, resulted from a complex set of factors,\nincluding the development of mass printing, the creation of schools in\nthe various samurai domains, and the rise of educational movements\nrelated to Japanese literature and culture that were highly critical of\nChinese-style philosophy of any sort. Yet, at the base of much of this\nwas the Neo-Confucian view, shared generally by orthodox and heterodox\nthinkers, that education, whether practical or discursive or both, was\na necessary ingredient in the life of all persons who might hope to\nrealize their full potential.\n \n\nThe liberation of Neo-Confucianism from the domination of Zen\nlearning only became possible in the late-sixteenth and\nearly-seventeenth centuries, following Toyotomi Hideyoshi’s (1537–1598)\ninvasions of the Korean peninsula. As a result, a number of\nNeo-Confucian texts that included pointed critiques of Buddhism came\ninto Japan. As the anti-Buddhist perspectives of these texts came to be\never more influential throughout the seventeenth century, an\nincreasingly common theme in Japanese Neo-Confucian discourse was its\nrelationship, positive or negative, to Buddhism. \n\nOne of the more interesting Confucian critiques of Buddhism was\narticulated by Itō Jinsai (1627–1705), a Kyōto-based\nscholar who, significantly enough, had neither been brought up nor\neducated by Buddhists. In his discussion of “the way,” Jinsai suggested\nthat the Buddha believed emptiness was the way, and that mountains,\nrivers, and land masses were all unreal. In opposition, Jinsai argued\nalong distinctly commonsensical lines: that for myriad ages heaven and\nearth have sustained life; the sun and moon have illuminated the world;\nmountains have stood and rivers flowed; birds, beasts, fish,\ninsects, trees, and grasses have lived as they do now. Given this\nevidence from the phenomenal world, Jinsai asked how the Buddhists\ncould claim that all is emptiness or nothingness. Answering his own\nquestion, Jinsai said that their emphasis on emptiness derived from\ntheir tending to retire to mountains and to sit silently while emptying\ntheir minds. Thus, Jinsai argued, the theoretical principles affirmed\nby the Buddhists—emptiness and nothingness—exist neither within\nthis world nor outside it. \n\nInstead of Buddhist emptiness which he claimed to be groundless,\nJinsai affirmed that the principles of love and social relations are\nfound in every aspect of life from humanity down to bamboo plants,\ntrees, grasses, insects, fish, and even grains of sand. Jinsai denied\nthat Buddhist principles received any corroboration in any level of\nexistence whatsoever, dismissing them as heterodoxies utterly lacking\nany basis in reality. \n\nJinsai maintained that the Confucian way is how people should\nconduct themselves ethically in their daily lives. In doing so, he\nasserted that the Confucian way is both natural and universal insofar\nas it is understood by everyone in every part of the universe as the\ninescapable path of all. Because this has been and will be true for all\ntime, it is simply called “the way.” Amplifying his point,\nJinsai added that the Confucian way does not exist simply because it is\ntaught. Rather, its vitality is naturally and universally so. By\ncontrast, the teachings of Buddhism exist only because certain people\nrevere them. If those people vanished, Jinsai maintained, so would\nBuddhism. Emphasizing their lack of practicality, Jinsai observed that\neven when Buddhist teachings are accepted, they bring no benefits. If\nthey are rejected, people lose nothing. Worst of all, Jinsai said, when\nthe world followed the teachings of the ancient Confucian sages, it was\nat peace, but since Buddhism had become dominant, great chaos and\ndisturbances have ensued. Thus, Jinsai’s rejection of Buddhism follows,\nat least in part, pragmatic lines, emphasizing that at best there is no\ngain from it, and at worst that it brings chaos and disorder to the\nworld. \n\nJinsai also criticized Buddhists for abandoning ethics, in\nparticular righteousness and justice (gi). While he allowed\nthat Buddhists taught the virtue of compassion, Jinsai added that they\nultimately extolled nirvana as the way. This led them to downplay\nrighteousness rather than recognize it as “the great path of all below\nheaven.” \n\nJinsai emphasized the mind as the seat of the moral sentiments\ngiving rise in action to the virtues of humaneness and righteousness.\nIn making this point and at the same time emphasizing the vital\nactivity of the mind, Jinsai enthusiastically endorsed the views of\nMencius. Jinsai pointedly criticized Buddhists and others who followed\nthem for claiming that the mind is empty. He also argued against the\nBuddhist belief that the mind ought to be made pure, utterly rid of\nhuman desires, and empty like a bright mirror or calm like still water.\nJinsai rejected such images for being at odds with the energetic\napproach to moral action that Confucianism endorses. For Jinsai, moral\naction emerges from moral sentiments and can never be divorced from the\npassions. Because the Buddhists sought, according to Jinsai, to\neliminate passions in their pursuit of nirvana, their view of\nthe mind was fundamentally mistaken. \n\nYet for all of his criticisms of Buddhism, Jinsai explained, in one\nof the appendices to his Gomō jigi, that the best way to\nrefute Buddhism and heterodoxies generally was not by means of debate,\nbut instead by manifesting the Confucian way of ethical engagement with\nthe world in daily practical activities. Debate, argument, and rhetoric\nwere, in Jinsai’s view, little more than empty formulations reflecting\ndescent into the same kind of emptiness that so characterized the\nBuddhist teachings one sought to oppose. \n\nIt might be added in this connection that Tokugawa Confucians often\nsought to outdo one another in their opposition to Buddhism. In one of\nhis more tolerant moments, Jinsai wrote a farewell letter to a Buddhist\nmonk, Dōkō (b: 1675?), who was about to depart Kyōto\nafter a period of study there. In the letter, which Jinsai surely never\nmeant to be construed as a definitive statement of his views on\nBuddhism, he praised Dōkō’s study of Confucianism. At one\npoint, Jinsai graciously added, “From the perspective of scholars, both\nConfucianism (Ju) and Buddhism (Butsu) definitely\nexist. However from the vantage point of heaven and earth, there is\nmost fundamentally neither Confucianism nor Buddhism. Rather, there is\nonly one way and that is all.” Jinsai’s letter, which was subsequently\npublished, shocked many Confucians who were far more doctrinaire in\ntheir opposition to Buddhism. One scholar, Satō Naokata\n(1650–1719), went so far as to republish Jinsai’s letter with a running\ncommentary, sharply critical of both Buddhism and Jinsai. The latter\nwas the subject of Naokata’s wrath because Jinsai, in Naokata’s\nintolerant view, had been insufficiently hostile to the “evil thing,”\nnamely, Buddhism. \n\nConfucian discourse on Buddhism, then, was much more complex than\nJinsai’s critiques alone might suggest. But what is clear is that\nduring the early-modern period of Japanese intellectual history,\nConfucianism and Buddhism came to be fairly distinct philosophical\nforces, with much critical antipathy issuing from the Confucian camp.\nAs Confucian learning became increasingly secure and respected in its\nown right, these critiques tended to diminish. Ogyū Sorai, for\nexample, rarely discussed Buddhism, though when he did his remarks were\ncritical. Still one senses that for Sorai and his audience, Buddhism\ndid not need to be subjected yet again to a Confucian critique.\nBuddhism had its own relevance for some people at certain times, and\nConfucianism had its own. Confucianism had arrived, apparently, as a\nlargely secular ethic with clear and distinct socio-political relevance\nthat to many suggested not just independence, but even philosophical\ndominance.\n \n\nNeo-Confucian philosophical discussions, often featuring lengthy\nexplanations of “ghosts and spirits” (C: guishen;\nJ: kishin), differed markedly from ancient\nConfucianism. Confucius declined to discuss spiritual matters at\nlength, even when asked about them specifically. Why address the world\nafter, Confucius asked, when one has yet to master the way of humanity\nwithin this world? Confucius was not disrespectful of ceremonies for\nthe spirits, but he did emphasize that he maintained a respectful\ndistance from them. Still, if he found himself in attendance at such a\nceremony, he behaved as if the spirits were actually there. Confucius’\nreluctance to discuss the spiritual dimension in any real detail has\nled many to speculate that he was an atheist, or perhaps a polite\nagnostic. \n\nIn the wake of Buddhism, however, it was impossible for Confucians\nto ignore the topic of ghosts and spirits. Buddhist literature went\ninto great detail about the Western Paradise, or the Buddhist Pure Land,\nand the many layers of hell where sinners would be punished by wardens\nof hell. Graphic depictions of the spirit world,\nheaven, hell, demons, hungry ghosts, and angelic bodhisattvas made the\naccounts seem all the more credible. In Japan, Shinto as well had its\nown traditions of ghosts, spirits, goblins, and changelings. To counter\nsuch discourse, Neo-Confucians formulated their own explanations of\nspiritual phenomena, ones offering a more naturalistic account of the\napparent activities of ghosts and spirits. These accounts can be\ninterpreted as bordering on atheism or agnosticism and so are in\nkeeping with Confucius’ position, at least as some have interpreted it.\nYet, they were far more lengthy overall than anything that Confucius or\nmost prior Confucians had offered. \n\nA key feature of Neo-Confucian philosophical discussions of ghosts\nand spirits is their naturalistic metaphysical character. Rather than\npurporting to describe particular spirits, many Neo-Confucians,\nfollowing Cheng Yi, explained ghosts and spirits as “traces of the\ncreative transformations of the world.” More specifically,\nNeo-Confucians often interpreted what appeared to be ghosts and spirits\nas “the spontaneous activities of the two generative forces,” yin and\nyang. As yin and yang expanded and contracted, spiritual forces purportedly emerged with\nyang, and ghostly forces with yin. \n\nWhile casting ghosts and spirits in metaphysical terms that in\ncertain respects seemed intent on explaining away ghosts and spirits,\nNeo-Confucians also affirmed that just as yin and yang pervade reality,\nso do ghosts and spirits. The spirits are simply the expansive and\nghosts, the contractive forces of the world. Recognizing the\ninterrelatedness of ghosts and spirits with the world at large, many\nNeo-Confucians associated spirits with heaven, spring and summer,\nmorning, the sun, light, music, and so on, while ghosts were linked to\nthe earth, fall and winter, evening, the moon, darkness, rituals, and\nso forth. With this analysis, Neo-Confucians did not deny spirits, but\ninstead asserted that they infuse every aspect of reality just as\nsurely as do yin and yang. \n\nProviding a basis for ancestor worship, Neo-Confucians typically\nclaimed that within a family line, there is a shared generative force,\nwhich entails a shared spirituality. This common spirituality is\ncommunicated through the male line in ancestral rites performed by sons\nto their fathers, grandfathers, and so on. Because the shared family\nline was considered essential to the shared spiritual basis,\nNeo-Confucians emphasized that if a family had to adopt a child, then\nit should take care to adopt a son from a male relative of the father\nso that the sacrifices offered by the adopted son might be happily\naccepted by the spirits. If adoption was outside the male line of the\nfamily, then offerings to the family ancestors would actually be\ncommunicated to the family line of the adopted son, leaving the family\nthat had adopted the son unhappily neglected. In an effort to curb\npopular involvement in spiritualistic movements and practices,\nNeo-Confucians generally described as wanton and improper any\nparticipation in a religious ritual or ceremony that had no\nrelationship with the larger family involved with them. \n\nOne of the more heterodox Neo-Confucian accounts of ghosts and\nspirits came from Ogyū Sorai. Unlike the naturalistic\nexplanations provided by most Neo-Confucians, Sorai emphasized the\nintegrity of the accounts of ghosts and spirits set forth by the\nancient sage kings. Sorai asserted that since the ancient kings had\nsaid that there were spirits, then there must indeed be spirits.\nLikewise with ghosts, as well as a host of other spiritual beings. To\nquestion the existence of ghosts and spirits was, in Sorai’s\nview, to disrespect the ancient sage kings. Sorai’s insistence upon an\nunquestioning belief in ghosts and spirits, however, was more the\nexception than the mainstream view among early-modern Japanese\nConfucians.\n \n\nOne of the great texts of Song dynasty Confucianism is Zhang Zai’s\n(1020–1070) “Western Inscription” (Ximing). In its opening\nlines, Zhang states that he views heaven as his father, earth as his\nmother, and the ten thousand things of the world as his brothers and\nsisters. All that fills the space between heaven and earth he\nconsiders as his body. Elsewhere Zhang spoke more metaphysically,\ndescribing that which fills all between heaven and earth\nas qi, or the generative force (J: ki) that is the\ncreative substantial being and energy of becoming in all things. Zhang\nalso explained qi in terms of the great vacuity, a notion\nthat sounds Buddhistic but was meant to capture the openness of all\nbecoming to change and transformation. Yet in the end, qi was\nthe rock bottom of Confucian realism, metaphysically speaking, and was\nin large part the ontological dimension of things that prompted\nConfucians throughout East Asia to take the world seriously not as a\nsite of delusion and ignorance, but instead as a both the crucible of\ntheir being and an extension of themselves in becoming. Reportedly,\nZhang’s sense of oneness and kinship with everything between heaven\nand earth left him unable to cut the grass and bushes outside his\nwindow. Other Song Confucians offered their own vision of oneness with\nreality by declaring that the humane person forms one body with the\nten thousand things of existence. These visions of oneness and kinship\nprompted Confucians to paint landscape (shanshui) paintings,\nliterally paintings of mountains (shan) and water\n(shui), compose poetry alluding to the interrelatedness of\nthings, and to direct public works projects meant to maintain the\nharmony and balance of heaven, earth, and humanity. \n\nZhang’s “Western Inscription” inspired Confucians throughout East Asia\nto develop philosophical thinking about their oneness with the natural\nworld and its generative being, and to advance practical thinking\nabout how to respectfully engage with the realm of heaven and\nearth. In Tokugawa Japan, this environmental concern took many\nforms. Kaibara Ekken’s Plants of Japan (Yamato\nhonzō), a kind of botanical study of Japanese medicinal\nplants and herbs, is one example. In his Instructions of\nCultivating Life (Yōjōkun), Ekken emphasized\nthe importance of nourishing one’s ki, or generative force,\nin harmony with that of all between heaven and earth. Equally\nimportant, especially as an indicator of the perennial significance of\nZhang Zai’s “Western Inscription” is Kumazawa Banzan’s (1619–1691)\n“Western Inscription for Japanese” (Yamato nishi no mei), an\nexpansive, vernacular commentary on Zhang Zai’s brief text. In\nhis Questions and Answers on the Great Learning (Daigaku\nwakumon), Banzan outlined various policy proposals, including\nlimits on the construction of Buddhist temples and samurai castles, as\na means of preventing deforestation. He also declared mountains,\nforests, and rivers – metaphors for the natural world—to be the\nfoundations of the state, and essential components in the longevity of\npolitical lines. If a ruler forfeited these components of nature and\nhis realm’s balance with the natural world, then his line would pay\nthe price. Banzan’s writings reveal that even Confucians in the\nprivate sector were thinking proactively about achieving a sustainable\nequilibrium with the forces of nature, one that provided for both the\nbest interests of human society and the integrity of natural growth\nand development. \n\nAn important legacy of Confucian philosophy in modern Japanese\nhistory derives from Confucian understandings of the philosophy of\nhistory. This is evident in the transition from the Tokugawa period,\ndominated politically by a samurai regime led by a shogun, to the Meiji\nperiod, at least billed as a restoration of imperial rule.\nRather than assuming that history was progressing ever forward to\nincrementally better levels, Confucians tended to see ideals in the\npast. Therefore, they often advocated a return to a supposed golden age\nas a means to improve conditions in the present. Confucius himself had\ndenied that he was an innovator, insisting that he only sought to\ntransmit the ideals of the past. Although Confucius might have cast his\nwork as mere transmission, he was clearly innovating in revolutionary\nphilosophical ways. The political transformation giving rise to the\nMeiji imperial regime, at least in terms of its philosophical\npresentation as a return to an ancient, supposedly more ideal model,\nwas characteristically Confucian. So was the fact that this purported\nreturn to the past ushered in a profoundly new historical period, one\nthat revolutionized most aspects of life. \n\nOne of the philosophical minds behind the Meiji restoration, at\nleast insofar as several of the anti-Tokugawa, pro-Meiji samurai\nleaders were concerned, was the Confucian scholar, Yoshida Shōin\n(1830–1859). He was a hereditary master, in the Chōshū\ndomain, of the Confucian teachings of Yamaga Sokō.\nPhilosophically, Sokō is best known for his Essential Records\nof the Sagely Teachings (Seikyō yōroku), a\nbrief but pointed critique of orthodox Neo-Confucian thinking. It\nadvocated instead Sokō’s own understanding of the\nAnalects. As transmitted to Shōin through the Yamaga\nline of scholarship, and then embodied by Shōin’s students such\nas Itō Hirobumi (1841–1909), a Chōshū revolutionary\nturned Meiji statesman, the restorationism that was at the core of both\nConfucianism and Neo-Confucianism was clearly echoed in the spirit of\nthe Meiji restoration. \n\nThe Meiji period, however, soon involved a profound turn away from\ntraditional patterns and toward more distinctively Western ones. This\nwas true in philosophy as well, resulting in the relative atrophy of\nConfucian studies. However, it is significant that most of the Meiji\nleaders who promoted Western philosophical ideas had backgrounds in\nConfucian studies. Nishi Amane (1829–1897), often referred to as the\nfather of western philosophy in Japan, read Ogyū Sorai’s\nphilosophical works before turning to the study of the ideas of Auguste\nComte and John Stuart Mill. During the people’s rights movement of the\n1870s and early 1880s, advocates such as Nakae Chōmin (1847–1901)\noften cast their understandings of liberty, equality, and natural\nrights in terms of notions drawn from Confucian discourse. \n\nWith the swing toward conservatism and nationalism in the late-Meiji\nperiod, philosophical voices such as that of Inoue Tetsujirō\nadvocated not so much a faithful return to Confucianism per se but to\nwhat Inoue called kokumin dōtoku, or “national\nethics.” This set of teachings was based largely on selective\nConfucian virtues such as loyalty and filial piety. Inoue is also\nnoteworthy for having led the way, albeit along highly nationalistic\nlines, in interpreting Confucian developments of the early-modern\nperiod as movements in “philosophy,” using the newly\ncoined Japanese word, tetsugaku. This Japanese word chosen as\nthe gloss for “philosophy” alluded back to, in Chinese\nliterature, the Book of History, a Confucian classic, where\ntetsu (C: zhi) refers to the\n“wisdom” manifested by the ancient sages of China. In that\nrespect, the “study of wisdom,” the literal meaning of\ntetsugaku, was as much an apt characterization of the\nConfucian project as it was one of the western field of\nphilosophy. \n\nUnfortunately, Inoue’s claim that there had been traditional forms of\nphilosophy, specifically the Neo-Confucian schools of the early-modern\nperiod, well prior to the introduction of western philosophy had one\ndisturbing side effect. He increasingly elevated the status of\nConfucian notions not necessarily as Confucian notions in themselves,\nbut as integral parts of a nationalistic, imperialistic, and\nmilitaristic blend serving the interests of Japanese militarists of\nthe 1930s and 1940s. In particular, Inoue’s later years were devoted\nto expounding bushidō, the so-called “way of the\nwarrior,” as a core ingredient in kokumin\ndōtoku. Inoue produced such a large corpus of\nbushidō-related literature that one might claim that\nthe way of the warrior was far more his invention than something\ngrounded in tradition. \n\nWith the defeat of Japan in 1945, Confucian notions came to be\nregarded negatively because of their unfortunate appropriation by\nInoue and other philosopher-ideologues. They had manipulated the core\nethics of Confucian philosophy into a teaching of loyalty to the\nimperial state and self-sacrifice for the sake of its glory. Those\nConfucian philosophers whose writings had been most enthusiastic about\nJapan, and so easily appropriated — as was the case with Yamaga\nSokō who had argued at one point in his multifaceted\nphilosophical corpus, that Japan, not China, was the true Central\nKingdom — have consequently suffered from significant neglect in\nthe postwar period. By contrast, those earlier Confucians whose\nwritings had disparaged Japan and celebrated China, such as those of\nOgyū Sorai, rebounded from their former pariah status in\njingoistic Japan to becoming the focus of repeated postwar\nstudies. Usually, however, because of the overall feeling that\nConfucianism of any sort was more ideology than philosophy (and this\nwas surely the most egregious legacy of its prewar appropriation)\nConfucianism has most frequently been interpreted simply as\n“thought” (shisō) or “ideology”\n(ideorogii), typically of a “feudalistic”\nsort. In other countries, including contemporary China,\ninterpreters are reexamining Confucianism as a living philosophy of\nongoing significance, but Japanese scholars have more viewed it as a\nhistorical artifact, not a vital philosophy. Instead, philosophy\ndepartments in most major Japanese universities today continue to\ndefine “philosophy” as western philosophy, finding relatively little\nplace for the study of Confucianism under its rubric. \n\nExaggerating the extent to which the fortunes of Japanese Confucianism declined in the postwar period, one scholar, Kiri Paramore, in his Japanese Confucianism: A Cultural Study, has suggested that in Japan, Confucianism ended up becoming taboo, a topic shunned by scholars and public intellectuals who would not so much utter the word, “Confucianism,” in their writings. As evidence, Paramore cites the oeuvre of Maruyama Masao, one of the greatest political thinkers of the mid-twentieth century. One of Maruyama’s most widely read works, Studies in the Intellectual History of Tokugawa Japan (Nihon shisōshi kenkyū), had discussed Neo-Confucianism in some detail, albeit in the flawed interpretive framework that Hegel had provided. Thus, Maruyama saw Neo-Confucianism as antithetical to change, and its continuative metaphysics linking the natural and ethical spheres, in need of dissolution. \n\n \n\nWritten during Japan’s war years, Maruyama identified a succession of Japanese Confucian scholars, including Ogyū Sorai, as vanquishers of the Zhu Xi mode of thought. The latter was, in Japan, little more—according to Maruyama–than an expression of spiritual slavery to the ossified philosophy of Song dynasty China, that of Zhu Xi. The dissolution of the Zhu Xi mode of thought credited to Japanese thinkers such as Sorai seemingly echoed the battlefield advances of the imperial Japanese forces in their conquest of large swathes of China and East Asia. Even though Maruyama was ideologically opposed to the war, his narrative hardly transcended the war rhetoric of Japanese nationalism in its ascent over China. Despite the fact that Maruyama later acknowledged errors and misjudgments in his presentation of Japanese Confucianism, his thinking came to be widely deemed as “a starting point” for future studies of the subject. There can be little doubt that as translated by Mikiso Hane and published by Princeton University Press, Maruyama’s Studies in the Intellectual History of Tokugawa Japan prompted many students of Japanese thought to renewed thinking about Confucianism and its importance in Japanese history. \n\nParamore claims that in the postwar period, Maruyama soon turned away from Confucian studies and only rarely used the term, “Confucianism” (Jukyō). This shunning of the notion supposedly announced a new era in which, according to Paramore, Confucianism was “taboo.” Put differently, Maruyama’s avoidance of the term, “Confucianism,” established the so-called “Maruyama rule” that “Confucianism” was not to be broached. However, familiarity with Maruyama’s oeuvre proves this analysis mistaken. After all, well after Studies, Maruyama authored a lengthy essay on the Yamazaki Ansai school, “Yamazaki Ansai’s Learning and the School of Yamazaki Ansai” (Ansai gaku to Ansai gakuha). Maruyama’s essay was published in a substantial volume on Ansai’s school, The School of Yamazaki Ansai (Yamazaki Ansai gakuha) in 1980. This volume was co-edited by Maruyama himself, and published by Iwanami shoten as part of its Nihon shisō taikei series. In the essay, Maruyama discusses Confucianism repeatedly, and admittedly, critically. Nevertheless, in discussing Confucianism, Maruyama violated the so-called “Maruyama rule” that had supposedly rendered Confucianism taboo. Clearly, Maruyama’s continued engagement with Confucianism proves that that was hardly the case. \n\nEvidence of the continued vitality of Confucianism within Japanese philosophical discourse is also at the University of Tokyo\nCenter for Philosophy. Since its founding in 2002, UTCP has sought\nto establish itself as an international base for the discussion of\nphilosophical problems. UTCP has also sponsored discussions addressing dimensions of Confucianism within Japanese philosophy. In doing so, UTCP has emerged as a leader in affirming the notion of “Japanese philosophy” and that of “Japanese Confucian\nphilosophy.” Much the same is true with the recently established\njournal, the Journal of Japanese Philosophy published by the\nState University of New York Press. Along with the longstanding\nefforts of the East-West Center and the University of Hawai‘i’s\nDepartment of Philosophy, the UTCP and JJP promise to\nsignificantly contribute to the revival of interest in Japanese\nConfucianism and its contributions to Japanese philosophical\ndiscourse. \n\n \n\nAlong similar lines, the International Association for Japanese Philosophy (IAJP), founded in 2014 by the editors of the Journal of Japanese Philosophy, provides opportunities, through regular conferences and panels, for discussion of a range of topics and themes in Japanese philosophy, including Japanese Confucianism, keeping the latter very much in the mainstream, rather than taboo, going forward. Recent calls for “Green Confucianism,” or an emphasis on environmentally-oriented dimensions of Confucian tradition that might serve as the foundations for an expansion of environmental philosophy within Japanese philosophical thinking, have also contributed to the ongoing relevance of the tradition in ways that go well beyond the confines of family morality, ancestor worship, and the basics of everyday morality in society and the political sphere. “Green Confucianism” is just one of many possible re-expressions of Confucian thinking vis-a-vis the evolving contexts of Japanese modernity that establish the perennial significance of Confucian cosmological thinking, alongside its ethical and sociopolitical and spiritual teachings.","contact.mail":"tuckerjo@ecu.edu","contact.domain":"ecu.edu"}]
