In Chapters 7–8, Aristotle deals with the\ncontradictory pairs of assertoric statements which divide truth and\nfalsity so that one is true and the other is false. In Chapter 9 he\nraises the question of whether this holds for all assertoric\nstatements or whether there might be an exception concerning\nstatements about singular future events or states of affairs which are\nneither necessary nor impossible and hence may take place, or may not.\nAristotle’s famous example is tomorrow’s sea battle. Is\nthe prediction that there will be a sea battle tomorrow\nnecessarily true, if it is true, and does its truth entail that the\nsea battle is inevitable? After a discussion of deterministic\narguments and the absurdity of fatalism (18a34–19a22), Aristotle\ngives his ambiguous reply in 19a23–39. Boethius’s (c.\n480–524) Latin translation of De interpretatione gave\nrise to a long commentary tradition through the Middle Ages, beginning\nfrom the eleventh century. Boethius’s own two commentaries were\nvery influential as well and provided information about other ancient\ncommentaries (Magee 2010). Chapter 9 was also dealt with in\ntheological commentaries on Peter Lombard’s Sentences\n(I.38) and in separate questions (Isaac 1953; Lohr 1967–1974;\nCraig 1988; Marenbon 2000; Braakhuis & Kneepkens 2003a; Knuuttila 2010). Al-Fārābī’s (c. 870–950) commentary on De\ninterpretatione was influential in medieval Arabic philosophy;\nAverroes (1126–1198) wrote another Arabic commentary. (For\nfuture contingents in medieval Arabic thought, see Marmura 1985;\nAdamson 2006.)\n\nThe discussion about future contingents in modern philosophical logic\nwas revived by J. Łukasiewicz’s works on three-valued logic\n(1957, 1967). He thought that in order to avoid fatalistic\nconsequences, one should admit that the principle of bivalence (for\nany proposition p, either p is true or p is\nfalse) does not hold good for future contingent propositions. Arguing\nthat this was realized by Aristotle in Chapter 9 of De\ninterpretatione, Łukasiewicz attempted to formalize\nAristotle’s position by introducing a third truth-value (neither\ntrue nor false) for future contingent propositions and giving\nthree-valued truth-tables for truth-functional basic connectives. Many\nauthors have followed Łukasiewicz in taking Aristotle to restrict\nthe principle of bivalence, though they have not ascribed to Aristotle\nthe details of Łukasiewicz’s system, which is problematic\nin many respects. In arguing for the deterministic consequences of\nunrestricted bivalence, Łukasiewicz himself assumed, and took\nAristotle to assume, that the truth of a proposition entails the\nnecessity of its truth. Logical determinism, therefore, is to be\navoided by qualifying the truth-values of future contingent\npropositions. The critics of this view do not see any entailment\nrelation between truth and necessity, some of them maintaining that\nthe illusion of logical determinism has its roots in a tacit\noscillation between a temporal and atemporal predication of truth. The\ntemporalized reading may be associated with diachronic determination,\ncertainty, necessity and other time-dependent qualifications. Mixing\nthese with non-deterministic atemporal predications yields the wrong\nidea of fatalism (von Wright 1984: 52–67). It is argued that\neven the temporalized predication of truth carries no deterministic\nimplications. (Sorabji 1980: 96–103; Sorabji’s example is\nthat “even if it has already been true that I am going to swim,\nI still retain the power to make it to have been false”.) \nThe majority of Aristotelian scholars believe that the argument in\nDe interpretatione 9 aims at avoiding fatalism by restricting\nbivalence for future contingent predictions (Frede 1970, 1985; Sorabji\n1980; Craig 1988; Gaskin 1995; Crivelli 2004; Weidemann 2012). The\nsecond interpretation insists that Aristotle’s point is not to\ndeny the truth-value of these statements, but their being true in the\nsame way as other statements are true. The difference is that while\nthe truth of other statements is necessary, the truth of future\ncontingent predictions is not yet similarly determined. This\ninterpretation is associated with Aristotle’s remark that not\neverything which is actual and therefore necessary is necessary\nwithout qualification (19a23). This is taken to mean that the\nnecessity of an event at a certain time does not imply that it was\ninevitable. Aristotle speaks about singular future possibilities which\nmay be realized or remain unrealized and which may or may not cease to\nbe antecedent possibilities (see De interpretatione 19a13–17,\nNicomachean Ethics III.5, 1114a17–19, Metaphysics VI.3). In the same\nway predictions may begin to be necessarily true or necessarily false.\n(For various versions of this approach, see Anscombe 1956; Rescher\n1963; Hintikka 1973; Fine 1984; Judson 1988.) \nThe former interpretation, which denies bivalence for future\ncontingent statements, is called the ‘traditional’ or\n‘standard’ interpretation. Some Stoics read Aristotle in\nthis way, as Boethius reports in his second commentary on\nAristotle’s De interpretatione: \nNow some people – the Stoics among them – thought that\nAristotle says that future contingents are neither true nor false. For\nthey interpreted his saying that nothing [of that sort] is disposed\nmore to being than to not being as meaning that it makes no difference\nwhether they are thought false or true; for they considered them to be\nneither true nor false [in Aristotle’s view], but falsely.\n(In Perihermeneias II, 208.1–4, trans. by N. Kretzmann.) \nOn the basis of a note in Simplicius’s commentary on\nAristotle’s Categories (407.6–13), it is argued\nthat some Aristotelians also qualified the principle of bivalence.\n(For this and other ancient deviations from the principle, see Sorabji\n1980: 92–93.) On the other hand, future contingent propositions\nwere treated as true or false in Stoic logic. The Stoics took the\nuniversally valid principle of bivalence to imply the predetermination\nof all future events. (See Cicero, De fato, 20–21;\nBobzien 1998: 59–86.)  \nBoethius regarded the Stoic interpretation of Aristotle’s view\nas mistaken, his interpretation being based on the terms\n‘definitely’ true or false and ‘indefinitely’\ntrue or false. These same terms were also used in Ammonius’s\ncommentary (c. 435/445–517/526). Since this work was not known\nto Boethius, both authors seem to have known some earlier Greek\ndiscussions in which these qualifications were introduced.\n(Ammonius’s Greek commentary on De interpretatione 9 is\ntranslated by D. Blank and Boethius’s Latin commentaries by N.\nKretzmann in the same volume, with interpretative essays by R.\nSorabji, N. Kretzmann and M. Mignucci in 1998.) The contemporary\nreconstructions of what Ammonius and Boethius meant can be divided\ninto two groups. According to one interpretation, Ammonius and\nBoethius ascribe to Aristotle the view that the predictions of future\ncontingent events and their denials differ from other contradictory\npairs, because truth and falsity are not definitely distributed\nbetween them and the propositions are consequently neither definitely\ntrue nor definitely false. In answering the Stoic criticism, Boethius\nmight have thought that future contingent propositions have the\ndisjunctive property of being true-or-false, which would mean\nsomething other than simply lacking a truth value. (For various\ninterpretations of how Boethius restricted bivalence, see Frede 1985;\nCraig 1988; Gaskin 1995; Kretzmann 1998.) Another interpretation holds\nthat Boethian future contingents are not definitely true or false\nbecause their truth-makers are not yet determined, but are true or\nfalse in an indeterminate way. No qualification of the principle of\nbivalence is involved. True statements are either definitely true or\nsimply (indefinitely) true or false (Mignucci 1988, 1998; Seel 2000;\nBeets 2003 for Boethius’s first commentary). According to both\ninterpretations, Ammonius and Boethius assumed that the definite truth\nof predictions directly implies determinism and that Aristotle denied\nthe definite truth of all future contingent propositions; it is less\nclear how they understood the indefinite truth of these (Sorabji\n1998a). Boethius’s formulations often suggest that future\ncontingent propositions are true-or-false. An additional reason for\nnot treating them as simply true or false is his view of the necessity\nof the present. In commenting on Aristotle’s remark that\n“ what is necessarily is when it is” (De\ninterpretatione 19a23), Boethius explains that even though\npresent things are temporally or conditionally necessary, they may be\ngenerically or antecedently contingent (In Perihermeneias I,\n121.20–122.4; II, 241.7–243.28). He apparently thinks that\nthe truth of future contingent statements implies that things cannot\nbe otherwise, for the assumed actuality of the relevant future\ntruth-makers means that alternative diachronic prospectives are\nrendered temporally impossible.  \nIn his longer commentary on De interpretatione, Boethius says\nof God that “he knows future events as happening contingently\nand not necessarily so that he does not ignore the possibility that\nsomething else might take place” (In Perihermeneias II,\n226.9–12). Boethius also stresses that since the truth of future\ncontingents is not accessible to humans, the predictions of the form\n“A sea battle will take place tomorrow” are false in the\nsense that they assert the truth of something that cannot be known\n(In Perihermeneias II, 211.26–213.18). In his later treatise\nConsolatio philosophiae Boethius states that “I do not\nthink that anybody would say that those things which are happening now\nwere not going to happen before they happened” (V. 4.19) In this\ntreatise, Boethius argues that God is atemporal and has the totality\nof changing history present to him. God’s knowledge is thus not\nforeknowledge since it is not temporally located, but the predictions\nof future contingents are true or false from the point of view of\nGod’s eternal knowledge of the things referred to (V.6,\n25–32; see also Augustine, City of God 11.21). According to Boethius, it is necessary\nthat if God knows that p, then p. This\n‘conditional necessity’ does not imply the ‘simple\nnecessity’ of p (Consolatio philosophiae V,\n6.27–30). Some medieval authors read this distinction in\nBoethius and Augustine as a modal placement solution to the problem of\nforeknowledge and free will (Matthews 2004). Thomas Aquinas, for\nexample, refers to Boethius’s distinction using the terms\nnecessitas consequentiae and necessitas consequentis\n(Summa contra gentiles I.67; De veritate I.23, ad\n13). For Boethius, see Evans 2004; Marenbon 2005; Sharples 2009; Marenbon 2013. \nBoethius’s remarks on modalities have led some authors to\nanalyze them by using models derived from modern temporal or tense\nlogic with branching time theory developed by Prior, Burgess, Thomason\nand others. In applying these to Boethius, Bornholdt states that the\nmodels shed light on Boethius’s approach even though they were\nnot intended by Boethius himself (2017: 49; see also Martin 2004:\n53–63). Bornholdt extends his formal analysis to later medieval\ndiscussions as well, calling it the Boethian model. For similar\nnon-historical reconstructions of time logic in some late medieval\ntheories of future contingents, see the\n SEP entry on future contingents. \nIn discussing statements such as “What is known by God\nnecessarily takes place”, Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109)\ndistinguished between the antecedent and consequent necessity of\nthings which are known. The latter is the necessity of a thing’s\nactuality which is caused by the actuality of the thing itself. The\nformer is the necessity by which a thing exists because of an external\ncause (Cur Deus homo 2.17, 125.6–126.2). Neither\nantecedent knowledge nor antecedent truth has a compelling effect on\nthings. In explaining Mary’s believing the truth of a prophetic\nstatement concerning the death of Christ, Anselm writes: \nTherefore, since her faith was true faith, it was necessary that things\nwould be as she believed. But if you are once again disturbed by my\nsaying “It was necessary…”, remember that the\ntruth of the virgin’s faith was not the cause of his dying\nfreely but that her faith was true faith because this was going to\nhappen. (Cur Deus homo 2.17, 124.27–125.3) \nAnselm thought that future contingent statements based on divine\nrevelation were true without deterministic implications. A similar\nview was held by most medieval theologians when they addressed divine\nomniscience and prophesy. For Anselm’s view, see Knuuttila\n2004. \nWilliam of Champeaux (c. 1070–1122) dealt with an argument\nagainst the compatibility between contingency and divine omniscience\nwhich was discussed in Augustine’s City of God (V.9).\nIn response to Cicero’s De fato and De\ndivinatione, Augustine refuted the claim that if events can\nhappen in any way other than God has foreseen, then God can be in\nerror. William stated that the antecedent of the argument is true but\nthe consequent is false and therefore the consequence is not valid\n(Lottin 1959: 195; Marenbon 1997: 226–227). Peter Abelard\n(1079–1142/4), in discussing the same example, applied the\nsystematic division between modal statements de sensu or in\nthe compounded sense and modal statements de re or in the\ndivided sense. (For Abelard’s modal terminology, see Glossae\nsuper Peri hermeneias XII.3–46. Later authors used the\nexpression de dicto instead of de sensu.)\nAbelard’s analysis of Cicero’s argument was often repeated\nin medieval theology, since it was put forward in slightly modified\nform in Peter Lombard’s Sententiae (c. 1157), which\nbecame the standard medieval introduction to theology. Abelard states\nthat when the proposition “A thing can be otherwise than God\nknows it to be” is read as a modal proposition de sensu\n(It is possible that a thing is otherwise than God knows it to\nbe), the antecedent is false and the possibility of God’s\nerror as a consequent would not be justified even if the consequence\nwere valid. When the antecedent is read de re (A thing\nthat is now somehow could be otherwise than God knows it to\nbe), the proposition is true, but the consequent about\nGod’s error is false, for if things were otherwise, God would\nknow as they would be. This shows that the consequence is not well\nformulated. Following Abelard, Peter Lombard formulated the same view\nin stating that “Things cannot be other than as God foreknows\nthem” is true in the compounded sense and false in the divided\nsense. The truth of the compounded sense saves God’s\ninfallibility and the falsity of the divided sense expresses\nGod’s freedom and the metaphysical contingency of the future\n(Peter Lombard, Sententiae I.38.2; Peter Abelard, Glossae\nsuper Peri hermeneias IX.86–99; Dialectica,\n217.27–219.24). It is assumed here that when a temporally\ndefinite statement is true, its denial may be possibly true.  \nEarly medieval logicians could deal with singular future statements as\nstatement types with truth-values changing in accordance with the time\nof assertion, as in Aristotle and Hellenistic philosophy. (For the\nprevalence of temporally indefinite sentences in ancient philosophy,\nsee Hintikka 1973: Ch. 4; Bobzien 1998: 66–67, 100–101,\n109–111.) In the theological context of timeless divine\nomniscience, it was more natural to regard these statements as\ntemporally definite. Abelard calls statements propositions\n(propositio) and what is asserted by a statement its\ndictum. He considered that a statement is true or false when\nits dictum is true or false. In dealing with prophesy,\nAbelard suggested that the dictum about a singular event is\nfirst expressed by a future tense proposition and then by present and\npast tense propositions. (For the nature of the dictum,\ncontrasted with the ‘facts’ and ‘propositions’\nof twentieth-century philosophical jargon, see Marenbon 1997:\n202–209). The view of a fixed propositional content was\ndeveloped further by twelfth-century authors who were later called\nnominales. One of the theses of this group was “What is\nonce true is always true”. (See Iwakuma and Ebbesen 1992: 196,\n199–201, 205–206 for the relevant texts. For the history\nof the principle, see also Marenbon 1992: 58–61 and Ebbesen\n1992: 73–74.) This thesis was employed in the discussions of how\nthe beliefs of Abraham and others who lived before the coming of\nChrist and believed various things about him were the same as the\nbeliefs of those who live after His coming. The reason for asking this\nwas that the previous beliefs were formulated in future tense\nstatements and the latter in present or past tense statements.\nAccording to the nominales, one could regard as basic a\ntemporally definite propositional content the meaning of which is\nexpressed by various tensed expressions depending on when they are\nuttered. While tensed statements about temporally definite singular\nevents have a changing truth-value, the corresponding non-tensed\ndicta are unchangingly true or false (Nuchelmans 1973:\n177–189; for some later examples, see also Nuchelmans 1980;\nLewis 1995; Goris 2001). Peter of Poitiers (c. 1130–1205), one\nof the authors taking this approach, argued that while the singular\nstatements about contingent things are immutably true or false because\nof God’s eternal choice, their unchanging truth-value could be\notherwise. God does not know contingent things through tensed\nstatements, since their truth-value is changeable. If God’s\nknowledge is described by using tensed statements, analogously to the\narticles of faith before and after the coming of Christ, one should\nread them so that they signify the same (Peter of Poitiers,\nSententiae I.7, 133–143; I.12.199–223;\nI.14.328–253). This became a well-known position since it was\nalso employed in Peter Lombard’s Sententiae (I.39.1;\nI.41.3). \nThe theological formulations by Peter Abelard, Peter Lombard and Peter\nof Poitiers discussed above exemplify twelfth-century deviations from\nthe Aristotelian thesis “What is necessarily is when it\nis”. This was traditionally understood as implying the principle\nof the necessity of the present, which was not questioned in ancient\nmodal theories (Knuuttila 1993: Ch. 1). Since God’s knowledge\nabout contingent things was regarded as unchangeable, the contingency\nof this knowledge (in the sense that it could be different) also\nimplied the denial of the Aristotelian equation of immutability with\nnecessity, a denial regarded as an explicit doctrine of the\nnominales (Iwakuma and Ebbesen 1992: 194). The new modal\nparadigm, which is more or less consciously applied in these\ndiscussions of God’s will, power, and knowledge, could be\ncharacterized as the model of simultaneous or synchronic alternatives.\nThere are three main examples of it in early medieval philosophy.  \nAbelard assumes that at a given instant of time, what is actual is\nnecessary as no longer avoidable, but he argues that unrealized\nalternatives are possible at the same time in the sense that they\ncould have happened at that time. Some of the alternatives of a\nsingular being are real counterfactual alternatives. These are\nunrealizable because of some previous change in the conditions of the\nsubject, and some are merely imaginable alternatives, such as\nSocrates’s being a bishop, which never had a real basis in\nthings. While often employing traditional ideas about necessity and\npossibility, Abelard also developed ideas pertaining to simultaneous\nalternatives. (See Martin 2003; Knuuttila 2008: 537–538.) \nGilbert of Poitiers (1085/90–1154) stressed the idea that\nnatural regularities which are called natural necessities are not\nabsolute, since they are chosen by God and can be overridden by divine\npower. This had become a widespread theological view in\nGilbert’s time. Gilbert explained it in the light of the\nAugustinian view of God’s acting by choice between alternative\nprovidential options and omnipotence as an executive power. There is\nan interesting formulation of Plato’s ‘Platonitas’\nin Gilbert. This is said to include all of what Plato was, is and will\nbe as well as what he could be but never is. Even though Gilbert does\nnot explain why there is a modal element in the individual concept, it\nwas probably needed in order to speak about Plato in alternative\npossible histories or, as in Abelard, about Socrates as a bishop.\nGilbert seems to have been the first to formulate an individual\nconcept in this way (Knuuttila 1993, 75–82; Marenbon 2007: 158–159). \nA third context of the systematic interest in simultaneous\nalternatives was the new twelfth-century theory that declarative\nsingular statements or their contents should be primarily treated as\ntemporally definite and as having an unchanging truth-value. All\npropositional contents pertaining to contingent things have a\ntruth-value on the basis of God’s eternal choice. These\ntruth-values would be otherwise if the providential design of the\nworld were different in relevant respects. Robert Grosseteste\n(1168/75–1253) taught that the opposites of actualized\ncontingent things are no longer realizable possibilities, though they\nare possible alternatives in the sense that they could have been\nincluded in God’s eternal providential choice. Actual history is\nan explication of one of the divine alternatives with respect to which\nthings are primarily called necessary, possible or impossible.\nNecessities and possibilities at this basic level are called\nmodalities ‘from eternity and without beginning’.\nMathematical truths exemplify these ‘simple’ necessities.\nIn addition, there are necessities and impossibilities which have a\nbeginning and which are eternal contingencies in the sense that they\ndepend on God’s free choice (De libero arbitrio\n168.26–170.33; 178.28–29). The contingency of the divine\nacts of knowledge and will is associated with an atemporal causal\npriority between the powers and their acts (178.24–26).\nGrosseteste’s views are compared with those of Duns Scotus in\nLewis (1996). \nThis was an innovative theory for dealing with future contingent\nstatements as omnitemporally true or omnitemporally false or, if these\nwere tensed, as antecedently true or antecedently false. The\ntruth-values of statements about contingent things, though temporally\nimmutable from the beginning of the world and also immutably known by\nGod, were metaphysically contingent. The consequence from knowledge or\ntruth to necessity, whether causal or semantic, was denied. The\ncontingency of the created order was based on God’s eternal and and\nfree providential choice that involved the acts of the created will as free.\nAnselm formulated this traditional view, following Augustine, as\nfollows: “It is both necessary that God foreknows what will come\nto be and that God foreknows that something will freely come to\nbe” (De concordia praescientiae et praedestinationis et\ngratiae Dei cum libero arbitrio, 1.1; cf. Augustine, On Free\nChoice of the Will, 3.3.8). Anselm argued that that predictions\nare true or false and their truth can be understood as the\ncorrespondence to what will happen, although what will contingently\nhappen is not known to human beings without supernatural help. This\nwas the standard view of the possibility of prophesy. (See the above\nquotation from Anselm’s Cur Deus homo; Peter Abelard,\nGlossae super Peri hermeneias, IX.69–85; Anonymous,\nSumma Duacensis, 129–130.) \nEarly medieval authors were well acquainted with the conception of\nGod’s eternal and timeless knowledge in Augustine and Boethius.\nThis aspect of the question of the divine knowledge and future\ncontingents became a central issue in Thomas Aquinas, who discussed\nthe philosophical theory of future contingents by following Aristotle\nand Boethius rather than twelfth-century innovators. According to\nAquinas, God atemporally grasps all combinations of things in\nparticular times by one eternal vision. Temporal things are timelessly\npresent to God, who has direct knowledge of them and their temporal\norder, though none of them is past or future with respect to His\ncognition (Scriptum super libros Sententiarum I.38.1.4–5; Summa contra\ngentiles I.66; Summa theologiae I.14.9, 14). Things seen\nas actual are necessary by supposition (i. e., with respect to\nGod’s knowledge and providence), but many of them are contingent\nwith respect to their proximate causes (Scriptum super libros Sententiarum I.38.1.5,\nSumma contra gentiles I.67, Summa theologiae I,\n14.13, De veritate 2.12). The ultimate source of the\nactuality of the created order is the divine free will (In libros \nPerihermeneias I.14, 197). Aquinas assumes that a metaphysical view of\nthe truth or falsity of all temporally definite propositions implies\nthat everything happens of necessity (In libros Perihermeneias I.13,\n173). In order to avoid this wrong idea, one should deal with future\ncontingent propositions like Boethius as disjunctively true or false.\nTheir definite truth-values known by supernatural omniscience are\nbeyond human cognitive capacities, except the various degrees of\nprobabilities corresponding to certain types of causes (In\nlibros Perihermeneias I.13, 172, 174). However, in the doctrine of divine\nprovidence, all historical propositions are definitely true. This is\ncalled Aquinas’s providential determinism (Porro 2013:\n121–127; Posti 2017: 82). While there are prophetic predictions\nof future contingents through a revelatory participation in divine\nknowledge, their truth remains a supernatural matter (Summa\ntheologiae II–2, 171.3, 6). Speaking about God’s atemporal\nknowledge as divine prescience is a temporal projection of the divine\nmode of knowing. For various interpretations of Aquinas’s view,\nsee Wippel 1985; Craig 1988: 99–126; Goris 1996; Marenbon 2005;\nKnuuttila 2010. \nMedieval critics found the allegedly Thomist idea of the presence of\neach instant of time to God’s non-temporal eternal vision\nproblematic because of the transitivity and symmetry of the relation\nof simulaneity. (See John Duns Scotus, Lectura\nI.39.1–5, 23, 28, 87, and further references in Hoenen 1993:\n169–70.) One could also ask how Aquinas’s view of\nGod’s essential simplicity and immutability is compatible with\nthe view that God’s eternal choice could be otherwise and the\nvoluntary acts of created beings could be other than what is known by\nGod (see Stump 2003: 100–127). \nMignucci’s account of how Ammonius and Boethius understood the\ndistinction between definite and indefinite truth is roughly speaking\nthe same as the explanation of these terms in Peter Abelard’s\ninterpretation of De interpretatione 9. Abelard believed that\nAristotle assumed that future contingent statements are true or false,\nthough not determinately true or false before the actuality of the\nthings to which they refer (Dialectica 213.17–20).\nAbelard used the notions of ‘determinate/indeterminate’\ninstead of the Boethian ‘definite/indefinite’, as most\nmedieval authors did. In this interpretation, he retained the\nprinciple of bivalence for all assertoric statements, but rejected the\nuniversal application of the stronger principle that every assertoric\nstatement is determinately true or determinately false. According to\nAbelard, the notions of ‘determinate’ or\n‘indeterminate’ apply primarily to the truth-makers of\nassertions and secondarily to assertions themselves: \nBut as the obtaining of future contingent states of affairs is\nindeterminate, similarly the propositions which enunciate these are\nsaid to be indeterminately true or false, for those which are true are\nindeterminately true and those which are false are indeterminately\nfalse, in acccordance with the indeterminate obtaining of what is\npredicted. Dialectica 211.30–32) \nAbelard was interested in the question of whether the\npresent truth of statements about future contingent events are\nthemselves determinate; i. e., whether “The sentence\n‘Socrates will eat tomorrow’ is true”, if true, is\ndeterminately true. Denying this, he restricted the principle that all\npast and present true propositions are determinately true. Abelard\nalso distinguished between determinateness and certainty. Future\ncontingent propositions may be certain if they are revealed by angels,\nfor example, but they are not knowable of themselves and not\ndeterminately true. (See Glossae super Peri hermeneias\nIX.19–42; Dialectica 211.32–212.23; Lewis\n1987.) \nThe ‘traditional’ view of truth and bivalence in Aristotle\nis put forward in an anonymous early twelfth-century commentary on\nDe interpretatione, edited by M. Dal Pra, which is often, and\nprobably mistakenly, attributed to Abelard. Applying Boethius’s\ndistinction between definitely and indefinitely true statements, the\nauthor argues that future contingent statements are merely\ndisjunctively true or false (tantum sub disjunctione);\n100.13–19; 112.8–113.3). They are true-or-false. \nWhile Abelard thought that the universal validity of the principle of\nbivalence was an Aristotelian view, thirteenth-century commentators\nargued for the traditional interpretation. Albert the Great and Thomas\nAquinas took Aristotle to be arguing in De interpretatione 9\nthat if every contradictory pair divides truth and falsity in a\ndeterminate way and the members are consequently determinately true or\nfalse, all things must determinately be or not be. They thought that\nAristotle then refuted the consequent by referring to various\ncontingent things. It follows that the antecedent cannot be true and\nfuture contingent propositions are not determinately true or\ndeterminately false. They are true-or-false under disjunction (Albert\nthe Great, Liber Perihermeneias, I.5.4–6,\n418–422; Thomas Aquinas, In libros Perihermeneias,\nI.13, 170–172; I.15, 202–203). The same interpretation of\nAristotle is found in Arabic commentators Abū Nasr\nal-Fārābī and Averroes. (See Al-Farabi’s\nCommentary and Short Treatise on Aristotle’s De\ninterpretatione, trans. F. Zimmermann, lxviii, 75–76,\n78–79, 91–92, 244–245, and Averroes’s \nMiddle Commentary on Aristotle’s De interpretatione, 82va.)\nAl-Fārābī’s own view was that future contingents\nare either true or false (94–96; Marmura 1985; Adamson 2006).\nThe traditional interpretation of Aristotle’s view was put\nforward by many later Latin commentators such as John Duns Scotus,\nQuaestiones in libros Perihermenias Aristotelis, I.7–8\n(179–181), trans. Buckner and Zupko; Walter Burley,\nCommentarius in librum Perihermeneias Aristotelis, 92,\n95–96; William Ockham, Expositio in Librum Perihermenias\nAristotelis I.6.15; Peter Auriol, Scriptum in I\nSententiarum I.38.3, 817–828; Gregory of Rimini,\nLectura super I Sententiarum I.38.1.1 (238–243); Peter\nof Ailly, Quaestiones super libros Sententiarum I.11.1A). In\nhis Supercommentary on Averroes’s Commentary on\nAristotle’s De interpretatione, the Jewish philosopher Levi\nben Gerson (Gersonides, 1288–1344) states that positing a truth\nvalue for future contingents leads to absurdity (83r; Rudavsky 1985:\n166). However, John Buridan read Aristotle in the same way as Abelard.\nAll assertoric statements are true or false though those about future\ncontingents are not determinately true or false (Questiones longe\nsuper librum Perihermeneias I.10). Since theologians usually\nthought that divine omniscience and prophecy presupposed unrestricted\nbivalence, the discussion of future contingents was divided into\nhistorical constructions of Aristotle’s view, mostly in\naccordance with the traditional interpretation, and the systematic\ndiscussions in theology that mostly refuted this for doctrinal\nreasons. Later examples of the traditional interpretation of\nAristotle’s view include George of Brussels, Logica magistri\nGeorgii inserto textu Bricoti, 51rv; Iodocus Trutfetter,\nSummulae totius logicae II.1 (LL3v–4v); Veteris\nartis…Perihermeneiasque expositio (g1r); see also Baudry\n1989 (ed.), La querelle des futurs contingents (Louvain\n1465–1475). Textes inédits, 206. (For medieval\ninterpretations, see Weidemann 1994; Gaskin 1995; Knuuttila 2010.) \nAn influential late medieval approach to future contingents was\nincluded in John Duns Scotus’s theory of metaphysics as a\ntranscendental science in which the meaning of the univocal notion of\nbeing (ens) was defined as ‘that to which to be is not\nrepugnant’. Beings in this metaphysical sense are actual things\nas well as non-actual possible things, the imagined actuality of which\ndoes not include a contradiction. In the Augustinian tradition\nmetaphysical possibilities were ultimately based on the divine essence\nand represented the ways in which it could be imitated by created\nthings. According to Scotus, when God as an omniscient being knows all\npossibilities, he seemingly does not know them by turning first to his\nessence. Possibilities can be known in themselves; in fact, they would\nbe what they are even if there were no God. Scotus calls the\npropositional formulations of pure possibilities logical possibilities\n(possibile logicum). These express things and states of\naffairs to which it is not repugnant to be. Possibilities as such have\nno kind of existence of their own, but are real in the sense that they\nform the precondition for everything that is or can be. (For\nScotus’s modal theory, see Vos et al. 1994; Knuuttila\n1996; Normore 1996, 2003; Honnefelder 2005.) Scotus takes it as an\nobvious fact that there are contingent states of affairs which could\nhave not been at that very moment of time at which they are\n(Ordinatio I.2.1.1–2, 86). This idea of simultaneous\nalternatives differed from the traditional view of the necessity of\nthe present and played and important role in Scotus’s\nmetaphysics. \nAll possibilities of being receive intelligible or objective being as\nthe objects of God’s knowledge. Some of these are included in\nGod’s providential plan of creation and will receive actual\nbeing. The description of a possible state of affairs at a certain\nmoment consists of compossible possibilities. Since finite beings are\ncontingently actual, alternative possibilities are possible with\nrespect to the time of their actuality, but they are not compossible\nwith what is actual. According to Scotus, impossibilities are\nincompossibilities between possible ingredients, such as\nSocrates’s sitting at a certain time and Socrates’s not\nsitting at that same time (Lectura I.39.1–5, 62–63;\nOrdinatio I.35, 32, 49–51; I.36, 60–1; I.43, 5–7, 14). \nScotus’s modal metaphysics incorporates many ideas similar to\nthose in the early medieval model developed by Abelard and the\nnominales, such as the denial of the necessity of the\npresent, the distinction between immutability and necessity and the\nuniversal validity of bivalence. Giving up the Thomistic view of the\natemporal presence of the flux of time to God, Scotus explains\nGod’s knowledge of the truth-value of future contingent\npropositions as his knowing which of the possible scenarios will be\nactual and which will not (Lectura I.39.1–5, 44). The\ndefinite truth-values of the propositions about possible future events\ndo not make them necessary, many of these being acts of the will which\nas a free cause chooses between alternatives without being determined.\n(See Vos et al. 1994; Söder 1999; for some discussions\nof Scotus’s view of the free acts of the will, see Dumont 2001;\nNormore 2003: 141–145; Langston 2010.)  \nScotus famously attempted to explain the contingency of God’s\neternal choice by distinguishing between the instants of nature in\nGod’s mind that represent conceptual succession without\nseparation or interval, for example, the instant of encountering\nopposite alternatives and the instant of choosing one of these. Future\ncontingent propositions founded on God’s eternal choice are\ndeterminately true or false in such a way that they could be\notherwise, independently of whether they are known or not to humans\n(Ordinatio I.38.2, 426) These ideas are not found in\nScotus’s early questions on Aristotle’s De\ninterpretatione that mostly follow Boethius’s views on\nfuture contingents, adding some more elaborated analyses of the\nstructure of future-tense propositions: they may signify that it is\ntrue now that something will be or signify that something will be\n(Opus 2.1.7–9). See the translations and commentary in\nBuckner and Zupko 2014.  \nOckham followed Scotus in believing that God’s choice could be\nother than it is and that future contingent propositions are true or\nfalse just as Scotus explicated, but he was dissatisfied with\nScotus’s instants explanation, admitting that he did not have\nany of his own (Ordinatio d. 38, 578, 581, 584–5; Adams\n1987: 1130–1136. Ockham also criticized the view that God knows future free acts\nthrough his own acts of the will as their partial cause, which he,\nlike many of his contemporaries and later commentators, treated as\nScotus’s position (Ordinatio d. 38, 582–583). This was\nHenry of Ghent’s view to which Scotus first subscribed but then\nqualified his acceptance. (See Hoenen 1993: 177–179; Söder\n1999: 177–183; Schabel 2000: 43–46.) Scotus thought that there\nare many contingent propositions known by God that are not simply\nchosen but rather permitted such as those about creaturely sins and\nother acts of free will (see Frost 2010). \nIn Scotus’ theory, the synchronic alternatives of a future free\nact remain possibilities though not compossibilities at the instant of\nthat act. He thought that these “logical potencies”\nexpressed by propositions with non-repugnant terms are not sufficient\nfor freedom that requires “real potencies” for\nalternatives at an instant of time with respect to the same instant\n(see Dumont 1995). Ockham did not accept this part of Scotus’s\ndenial of the necessity of the present, thinking that real capacities\nfor oppositions are diachronic (Ordinatio d. 38, 581). Opposite\nreal capacities without temporal succession at an instant were found\nproblematic by Thomas Wylton, an early critic of Scotus’s ideas\nwho, while largely following Boethius, put forward some propositional\ndistinctions similar to those in Scotus’s questions on De\ninterpretatione. See the edition and comments in Schabel 2011b;\nBornholdt 2017: 116–120. \nOckham believed, as Scotus did, that future contingent propositions\nare true or false, that created wills are non-determined free causes,\nand that God knows contingent events without their being\nsimultaneously present to God. (For Ockham’s view, see Adams and\nKretzmann 1983; Normore 1982.) While Scotus preferred to distinguish\nGod’s eternal knowledge and choice from the temporal order\nsharply (Lectura I.39.1–2, n. 28, 85; Ordinatio I.40,\nn. 8), Ockham thought that they can be treated as temporally past.\nThis led him to ask how God’s foreknowledge as something past\nand hence seemingly necessary is compatible with the contingency of\nfuture things. Ockham’s answer was that even though God’s\nforeknowledge is past, its content is future, and the past truth of\nfuture contingent propositions in God’s immutable but contingent\nknowledge does not fall under the necessity of the past (Ordinatio\nd. 38, 387–8; Tractatus de praedestinatione\n515–516). Many influential late thinkers embraced Ockham’s\nview. (See Robert Holkot, Sent. II.2 in Seeing the Future\nClearly, 127, 145–146; Gregory of Rimini, Lectura super I Sententiarum\nI.38.2.3 (302–303); Pierre d’Ailly, Quaestiones super libros Sententiarum I.11.3S.) This is also the hallmark of what is called the\nOckhamist view of divine foreknowledge in contemporary philosophical\ntheology (Zagzebski 1991: 66–97). \nWalter Chatton was a contemporary critic of Ockhams’s views\nabout future contingents and divine knowledge. He also addressed the\ntheories of Scotus, Wylton, and particularly Peter Auriol, his main\nsource of inspiration, but mostly avoided formulating his own\nposition. For an English translation with a commentary of his main\ntreatise on future contingents, see Bornholdt 2017; see also the\n SEP entry on Walter Chatton.\n Peter Auriol put forward an original revision of the usual\ntheological position that while future contingent propositions were\nneither true nor false in Aristotle, this was not acceptable\nconcerning divine knowledge. Auriol argued that since these\npropositions lack a truth value, even God is aware of the future in an\n“indistant” way that does not imply that future contingent\npropositions should be treated as true or false. Auriol’s\nindistant knowledge abstracts from temporality and simultaneity and is\nallegedly compatible with God’s necessary immutability and human\nfree will (Schabel 2000: 67–123). Auriol’s position\ninspired much critical discussion until early sixteenth century. It\ncame to be regarded as heretical when a Papal commission made a\ndecision about the theses of Peter de Rivo, who defended a view\nsimilar to that of Auriol. Some of de Rivo’s statements were\nofficially condemned in 1474 by Pope Sixtus IV (Baudry 1989 (ed.), La querelle des futurs contingents (Louvain 1465–1475). Textes inédits; Schabel 1995–96, 2000:\n315–336, 2003a). \nEnglish fourteenth-century authors often commented on the\nterminological distinctions between determinate and indeterminate\ntruth and falsity. Ockham characterized all prospective truths,\nwhether necessary or contingent, as immutable and therefore\ndeterminate, but there were other suggestions as well. Walter Burley,\nRichard of Campsall, Arnold of Strelley, and Robert Holkot preferred\nto call true propositions about future contingent things as\nindeterminately or contingently true. Some commentators have argued\nthat speaking about this special mode of being true or false was an\nattempt to modify bivalence by formulating an idea of many-valued\nlogic, see Normore 1982, 1993; Gelber 2004: 224–250. For further\ntexts and studies on late medieval controversies related to\nforeknowledge, freedom and future contingents, see Genest 1992;\nSchabel 2003a, 2003b, 2007, 2011a, 2011b; Schabel, Friedman, and Balcoyiannopoulou\n2001; Rossini and Schabel 2005; Thakkar 2005, 2010.  \nA central question for those who gave up the Thomist view was how God\ncan eternally know the acts of the will which is a free cause? An\ninfluential answer was offerred in the theory of middle knowledge by\nLuis de Molina (1535–1600). In addition to the knowledge of all\npossibilities and the possibilities which will be actualized in the\nprovidentially chosen history, God has a third kind of knowledge\n(scientia media), which comprises the hypothetical truths\nabout possible beings. In creating the world, God knows what possible\ncreatures would do in any possible situation (Freddoso 1988).\nMolina’s ‘middle knowledge’ theory about\ncounterfactuals of freedom was actively debated in the sixteenth and\nseventeenth century and has remained a living issue in the philosophy\nof religion (Dekker 2000).","contact.mail":"simo.knuuttila@helsinki.fi","contact.domain":"helsinki.fi"}]
