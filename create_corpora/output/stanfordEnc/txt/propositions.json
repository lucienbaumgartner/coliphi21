It is used to refer to some or all of the following: the\nprimary bearers of truth-value, the objects of belief and other\n“propositional attitudes” (i.e., what is believed, doubted,\n etc.[1]), \nthe referents of that-clauses, and the meanings of\nsentences.\n\n\n\nOne might wonder whether a single class of entities can play all\nthese roles. If David Lewis (1986, p. 54) is right in saying that\n“the conception we associate with the word\n‘proposition’ may be something of a jumble of conflicting\ndesiderata,” then it will be impossible to capture our\nconception in a consistent definition.\n\n\n\nThe best way to proceed, when dealing with quasi-technical words\nlike ‘proposition’, may be to stipulate a definition and\nproceed with caution, making sure not to close off any substantive\nissues by definitional fiat.\n\n\n\nPropositions, we shall say, are the sharable objects of the\nattitudes and the primary bearers of truth and falsity. This\nstipulation rules out certain candidates for propositions, including\nthought- and utterance-tokens, which presumably are not sharable, and\nconcrete events or facts, which presumably cannot be false. These\nconsequences fit well with contemporary usage. Our definition leaves\nopen many of the questions dividing propositionalists: which additional\nroles are propositions fit to play? would propositions have to be\nmind-independent or abstract? what individuation conditions would they\nhave? how would they relate to facts? We examine these issues below, as\nwell as the fundamental issue of whether there are propositions at all.\n\n\n\nWe will attempt only the briefest history of the topic, focusing on\nkey episodes rather than on a comprehensive survey. \n\nIt is difficult to find in the writings of Plato or Aristotle a clear\nendorsement of propositions in our sense.  Plato’s most challenging\ndiscussions of falsehood, in Theaetetus (187c-200d) and\nSophist (260c-264d), focus on the puzzle (well-known to\nPlato’s contemporaries) of how false belief could have an object at\nall. Thinking that Theaetetus flies would seem to require thinking the\nnon-existent flying Theaetetus. Were Plato a propositionalist, we\nmight expect to find Socrates or the Eleactic Stranger proposing that\nfalse belief certainly has an object, i.e., that there is something\nbelieved in a case of false belief — in fact, the same sort of\nthing as is believed in a case of true belief — and that this\nobject is the primary bearer of truth-value. But it seems no such\nproposal is seriously considered. In both dialogues, it is suggested\nthat thought is a kind of inward dialogue carried on in the mind\nitself (Theaetetus 189e-190a and Sophist263e), and\nthat judgment results when the two inward voices affirm the same\nthing.  Plato is standardly understood as explaining false belief\n(doxa) in terms of the assertion of a false statement\n(logos). But it is far from clear that he takes the objects\nof belief to be statements rather than simply the ordinary concrete\nobjects (e.g., Theaetetus) and forms (e.g., flying) which the\nstatement is about, and still less clear that he takes statements to\nbe sharable between minds. Statements, for Plato, might\nsimply be tokens of inner speech, as Nuchelmans (1973, p. 21)\nsuggests. \n\nAristotle expends great energy in investigating what in reality\nmakes true statements true, but less investigating the nature of\ntruth-bearers themselves. In his most significant discussions of truth\nand falsehood, he seems not to take a clear stand on the question of\npropositions. In On Interpretation 1 16a, for instance,\nAristotle remarks that falsity and truth require combination and\nseparation, whether of names and verbs in speech, or of elements in\nthought. However, it is unclear whether the resulting combination of\nthought elements is anything other than a token thought, as opposed to\nsomething which is the content of the token thought and which could be\nthought by others, could be denied, asserted, etc. \n\nArguably, the first employment in the western philosophical\ntradition of the notion of proposition, in roughly our sense, is found\nin the writings of the Stoics. In the third century B.C., Zeno and his\nfollowers, including Chrysippus especially, distinguished the material\naspects of words from that which is said, or lekta. Among\nlekta, they distinguished the complete from incomplete (or\ndeficient), the latter corresponding roughly to the meanings of\npredicates, the former to the meanings of sentences. Among complete\nlekta they included axiomata, or the meanings of\ndeclarative sentences. For the Stoics, only axiomata, and not\nthe words used to articulate them, were properly said to be true or\nfalse. Axiomata were therefore the proper subject matter of\nStoic logic. \n\nLekta posed a problem for Stoic materialism, according to\nwhich everything real is corporeal. For the Stoics, the real was\nlimited to that which can act or be acted upon, and therefore to the\nbodily. Lekta, however, were thought to be incorporeal. Seneca\nexplains: \n\nThe notion of a proposition can also be found in the works of\nMedieval philosophers, including especially Abelard (1079–1142) and his\nfollowers, but also among later scholastic philosophers in England,\nincluding Adam Wodeham (d. 1358) and Walter Burleigh (1275–1344). \n\nAbelard distinguishes between dicta or what is said and\nacts of assertion (or thinking), the former being the fundamental\nbearers of truth-value. While Abelard himself seems to have had little\nto say about the nature or identity conditions of dicta, his\nsuccessors took up the subject with vigor (Nuchelmans 1973, pp. 162–3).\nAre dicta particular acts of thinking, concrete events or\nfacts, or entities having the same sort of being as universals? Each of\nthese views is considered and evaluated in the treatise Ars\nMeliduna, of unknown authorship. \n\nA similar debate raged among the English scholastics in the\nfourteenth century. Against Ockham’s nominalistic account, under which the\nobject of assent is a complex token mental sentence, Adam Wodeham, for\nexample, maintained that the object of assent is not any sort of mental\nentity, nor even a thing at all, properly speaking, nor of\ncourse a nothing but rather a being the case (see\nWood 2003, and Nuchelmans 1996, IV for further discussion of Wodeham\nand his contemporaries). \n\nOne complicating factor for the contemporary reader in examining\nMedieval (and later) work on the topic is that the term\n“propositio” was standardly used, following Boethius, to\nrefer to sentences, mental as well as written or spoken (oratio\nverum falsumve significans, i.e., speech signifying what is true\nor false).  Propositions in our sense were what was signified by these\n>propositiones if they signified at\n all.[2] \n\nWhen we turn to the early modern period, it is not easy to find, at\nleast in the writings of major philosophers, an unabashed assertion of\nthe reality of propositions. Unsurprisingly, one looks in vain in the\nwritings of the British empiricists. As for Descartes, particular acts\nof judgments serve as the primary bearers of truth-value (although\nthere is considerable debate about the status of his eternal truths).\nLeibniz’s cogitato possibilis have some of the characteristics\nof propositions. These possible thoughts seem to play the role\nof thought-contents and the fundamental bearers of truth-value.\nHowever, it is a matter of debate whether they are accorded real\nontological status. \n\nPropositionalists were by no means rare in the 19th century, Gottlob\nFrege being the best known example. The Czech philosopher and\nmathematician Bernard Bolzano also deserves special mention. In his\nWissenschaftslehre, or Theory of Science, published\nin 1837, he argued for the existence of what he called\n‘Sätze an sich,’ or sentences in themselves,\nwhich he clearly distinguished from linguistic items or mental\nphenomena.  They are the fundamental bearers of truth and falsity, and\nthe objects of the attitudes.  It is the goal of every science,\nincluding mathematics, to state the fundamental true sentences in\nthemselves pertaining that subject matter. (This marks a clear\ndeparture from the psychologizing approaches of many of Bolzano’s\ncontemporaries.)  Like Frege after him, Bolzano conceived of\npropositions as complexes composed of wholly abstract mind-independent\nconstituents (Vorstellungen an sich). Bolzano’s work\nhas had a profound influence on Husserlian phenomenology and the\ndevelopment of modern logic. \n\nArguably, the three figures whose work has most shaped the framework\nfor contemporary Anglophone work on propositions are Gottlob Frege,\nG.E. Moore, and Bertrand Russell. We will give short summaries of their\nthought on the matter. \n\nIn 1892, Frege published his classic paper “On Sense and\nReference”. This paper contains his first formulation of the\ndistinction between sense (Sinn) and reference\n(Bedeutung). Roughly speaking, the sense of an expression is\nthe mode of presentation of its referent, or the cognitive value of\nits referent. Expressions were said to express their\nsenses. Sentences, too, had both referents and senses, according to\nFrege. The referent of a sentence is its truth-value. Its sense is a\nthought (Beaney 1997, p. 156), not a token thought, but a thought in\nthe sense of a proposition: a sharable content. Thus, in Fregean\njargon, meaningful sentences express thoughts. \n\nFrege conceived of thoughts as structured complexes of senses. The\nthought expressed by ‘The evening star is bright’ consists\nof the sense of ‘the evening star’ and the sense of ‘is\nbright’. (It should be noted that this claim about structure does\nnot strictly follow from the fact that sense is compositional, i.e.,\nthat the sense of a whole expression is fixed by the senses of its constituent\nparts and their syntactic mode of arrangement.) In his late\nmasterpiece, “The Thought” (1922), Frege is explicit about\nthe nature of thoughts. They are not part of the outer realm, which\nconsists of those entities perceivable by the senses. This Frege thinks\nis obvious. Nor are they part of the inner realm, which consists of\nideas. Unlike ideas, thoughts do not require an owner (i.e., they exist\neven if not present in any mind), and can be present to more than one\nmind. A third realm must be recognized, he tells us — a realm of\nabstract eternal entities which we can grasp by virtue of our\npower of thinking. However, Frege is explicit that thoughts do act: \n\nThis is perhaps the locus classicus for platonism in the\nmodern sense of that term, that is, for the doctrine that there exist\nmind-independent abstract entities. \n\nIn their early writings, Russell and Moore endorse propositionalism.\nIn his 1903 book The Principles of Mathematics, Russell\naffirms the existence of propositions, taking them to be complexes of\nordinary concrete objects (the referents of words) rather than of\nFregean senses (p. 47). Propositions so conceived are now standardly\ncalled Russellian, and propositions conceived as complexes of\nsenses or abstract entities are called Fregean. In his\n1899 paper, “The Nature of Judgment,” Moore affirms the\nexistence of propositions, taking them to be broadly Fregean in nature\n(in particular as being complexes of mind-independent Platonic\nuniversals which he calls concepts). \n\nRussell and Moore later grow suspicious of propositions (although\nRussell seems to have accepted them later as a kind of derived or\nimmanent entity). Interestingly, Moore’s thinking on the matter seems\nto have changed dramatically during the winter of 1910–11, as his\npublished lectures Some Main Problems of Philosophy reveal.\nBefore Christmas, Moore claims: \n\nAfter Christmas, Moore is more skeptical. While the theory of\npropositions is admittedly simple and natural (p. 286), there are good\nreasons to reject it. He specifies two problems, both having to do with\nfacts, a topic he avoided in his earlier lectures. The first\nis that the theory of propositions suggests the\n“primitivist” theory of truth, previously held by Moore and\nalso Russell, according to which truth is a simple unanalyzable\nproperty of propositions. Primitivism, Moore now claims, requires the\nclaim that facts consist in the possession by a proposition of the\nsimple property of truth. This Moore now finds unacceptable. The second\nproblem is simply that the theory seems intuitively false: \n\nRussell echoes similar sentiments in essays after\nPrinciples. In 1910 he writes that “we feel that there\ncould be no falsehood if there were no minds to make mistakes”\n(Slater 1992, p. 119), and in the 1918 he remarks that a person with\n“a vivid instinct as to what is real” cannot “suppose\nthat there is a whole set of false propositions about ” [Russell\n1956, p. 223). \n\nThese doubts led Russell (1912) to propose a multiple relation\ntheory of judgment, to replace the standard two-place relational theory\n(which is discussed at length in section 3.1). To use Russell’s\nexample, in judging that Desdemona loves Cassio, Othello stands, not\nin a binary relation to a proposition, but rather in a multiple or\nmany-placed relation to Desdemona, loving, and Cassio.\nOthello’s judgment is true when there is a fact of Desdemona loving\nCassio and otherwise false. This theory, and its contemporary\nincarnations, is discussed in a supplementary document. \n\nMoore’s doubts led him to postulate what appear to be merely\npossible facts as the objects of the propositional attitudes. When a\nsubject believes that x is F and x is not F, the object of belief is\nthe non-existent but possible fact that x is F. See section below for\nfurther discussion of possible facts and their relations to\npropositions. \n\nIf there are propositions, they would appear to be good\ncandidates for being the bearers of alethic modal properties (necessary\nand possible truth), as well as the relata of entailment. And\nif propositions stand in entailment relations, then there would seem to\nbe maximal consistent sets of them. Prima facie, such sets seem to be\ngood candidates for possible worlds (Adams 1974; 1981). A proposition\nwill be true in a possible world (at a maximal consistent set of\npropositions) iff it is a member of that world. \n\nIf possible worlds are understood in this way, however, it is\nimportant to distinguish two meanings for talk of ‘the actual\nworld’. This may refer either to the totality of what exists, to\nwhat Lewis calls “I and all my surroundings”, or to the maximal\nconsistent set which includes all the true propositions. The latter is\npart of I and all my surroundings, but only a proper part. \n\nBy our stipulation, ‘proposition’ is used to pick out\nthe objects of the attitudes and the bearers of truth and falsity. One\nwould therefore expect that if there are propositions, they would\nfigure importantly in the semantics of attitude- and truth-ascriptions.\nOne would expect, in particular, that in ‘S believes that\np’, and in ‘that p is true’, the\nthat-clauses would refer to\n propositions.[3] \n\nOne might doubt whether that-clauses could really\nrefer, if reference is understood on the model of proper\nnames. For, that-clauses are not proper names, nor are they\nnoun\n phrases.[4]\n Still, because propositions are the objects\nof the attitudes and the bearers of truth, mustn’t they somehow\nbe semantically associated with ascriptions of attitudes and of truth?\nFollowing Jeffrey King (2002), we will use the term\n‘designate’ as a catch-all covering any sort of semantic\nassociation between a linguistic item and an entity. We follow standard\nterminology in using the word ‘express’ to pick out the\nrelation between a predicate and the property which is its sense or\nsemantic content. \n\nMore carefully, then, the propositionalist will find it natural to\naccept the following account of attitude-ascriptions: \n\nThe Relational Analysis of Attitude Ascriptions \n\nAn attitude ascription ‘S Vs that\np’ is true iff ‘S’ designates a\nperson who stands in the attitude relation expressed by\n‘V’ to the proposition designated by ‘that\np’ (and false iff ‘S’ designates a\nperson who doesn’t stand in such relation to such a proposition). \n\nAnalogously, there is the Property Analysis of\ntruth-ascriptions: \n\nOne of the great advantages of these analyses — the combination of\nwhich we will simply call The Relational Analysis — is the\nsmooth explanation of the validity of certain inferences. Consider, for\nexample: \n\nCharles believes everything Thomas said.\n\nThomas said that cats purr.\n\nSo, Charles believes that cats purr. \n\nSomething Barbara asserted is true.\n\nNothing John denied is true.\n\nSo, something Barbara asserted John did not deny. \n\nJohn believes that every even is the sum of two primes.\n\nGoldbach’s Conjecture is that every even is the sum of two primes.\n\nSo, John believes Goldbach’s Conjecture. \n\nThese inferences are valid if they have the following simple logical\nforms: \n\nFor all x such that Thomas said x, Charlie believes\nx. \n  Thomas said A. \n  So, Charlie believes A. \n\nSome x such that Barbara asserted x is true.\n \nNo x such that John denied x is true.\n \nSo, some x such that Barbara asserted x is such\n that John did not deny x. \n\nJohn believes A.\n \nGoldbach’s Conjecture is A.\n \nSo, John believes Goldbach’s Conjecture. \n\nWe will discuss problems for the Relational Analysis in Section\n 5.[5] \n\nPropositions are also commonly treated as the meanings or, to use\nthe more standard terminology, the semantic contents of\nsentences, and so are commonly taken to be central to semantics and the\nphilosophy of language. However, there is room for doubt about whether\npropositions are the right sort of entity for the job (Lewis 1980).\nHere is why. Note that a sentence would appear to contribute the same\ncontent regardless of whether it occurs as a proper part of a larger\nsentence. So, a sentence such as ‘in the past, Reagan was\npresident’ would seem to be true depending on whether the content\nof ‘Reagan is president’ is true at some past time. But\nthis would seem to imply that this content must lack temporal\nqualification — that it can change in its truth-value over time.\nSimilarly, it seems there are locative sentential operators ‘in\nChicago, it is raining’. If so, then by a similar argument, it\nwould seem that the content of ‘it is raining’ would have\nto lack spatial qualification. The problem is this: it seems\npropositions, being the objects of belief, cannot in general\nbe spatially and temporally unqualified. Suppose that Smith, in London,\nlooks out his window and forms the belief that it is raining. Suppose\nthat Ramirez, in Madrid, relying on yesterday’s weather report, awakens\nand forms the belief that it is raining, before looking out the\nwindow to see sunshine. What Smith believes is true, while what Ramirez\nbelieves is false. So they must not believe the same proposition. But\nif propositions were generally spatially unqualified, they would\nbelieve the same proposition. An analogous argument can be given to\nshow that what is believed must not in general be temporally\nunqualified. \n\nIf these worries are well-taken, then the meanings or contents of\nsentences are not in general propositions. \n\nAppealing to recent work in linguistics, Jeffrey C. King (2003)\npresents evidence against one of the crucial assumptions of the above\narguments, that there are no genuine locational or temporal operators\nin English. King claims that ‘somewhere’ and\n‘sometimes’ are better regarded as quantifiers over\nlocational and temporal entities (i.e., either locations and times\nthemselves or locational or temporal properties of events). Thus,\n‘somewhere, it is raining’ would have the logical form\n‘there is some location L such that it is raining at\nL’.  King further argues that tenses are best analyzed\nas quantifiers over times rather than temporal operators. ‘John\nflunked chemistry’, thus, would have the form ‘there is\nsome time t within I* such that John flunks\nchemistry at t’, where the interval I* is\ncontextually supplied. These analyses, of course, require the\ncontroversial claim that predicates like ‘is raining’ and\n‘flunks ’ include extra argument places for locations and\ntimes. \n\nKing emphasizes that his argument is thoroughly empirical. It relies\non results from empirical linguistics. If King is right, however, the\nview that the contents of sentences are propositions can be\nmaintained. \nFor other criticisms of Lewis’s argument, see Richard (1982), Salmon\n(1989) and Cappelen and Hawthorne (2010).  Brogaard (2012) provides a defense of the temporalist view of propositions. \n\nOne familiar argument for propositions appeals to commonalties\nbetween beliefs, utterances, or sentences, and infers a common entity.\nThus, it has been suggested, less in print perhaps than in\nconversation, that propositions are needed to play the role of being\nwhat synonymous sentences have in common, what a sentence and its\ntranslation into another language have in common, etc. \n\nArguments of this sort are typically met with the following reply:\ncommonalties do not necessarily require common relations to a single\nentity. Two red things have something in common, in that they are both\nred, but it does not follow that they bear a common relation\nto a single entity, the universal of redness. Similarly, two\nsentences, in virtue of being synonymous, can be said to have\nsomething in common, but that fact alone does not entail they are\ncommonly related to a proposition. When a relation R is\nsymmetric and reflexive with respect to a certain domain, it may be\nuseful to speak of the things in the domain which bear R to\none another as “having something in common”, but nothing\nof ontological significance follows. Thus, the conclusion is drawn: we\nneed an argument for thinking that commonalties require common\nrelations to a single entity.  \n\nOne standard sort of argument for propositions is\nmetalinguistic. Thus, many argue that we think of\nthat-clauses as designating expressions if we are to explain\nhow certain argument patterns (such as those considered in Section 2)\nare valid and in fact have sound instances (Horwich 1990, Higginbotham\n1991, Schiffer 1996, Bealer 1998). Since some of these sound argument\ninstances contain as premises sentences attributing truth to the\ndesignata of that-clauses, those designata must be bearers of\ntruth-values.  Similarly, premises of some of these sound instances\nascribe attitudes toward the designatum of a that-clauses,\nthese designata would seem to be objects of attitudes.  In brief, in\norder to explain these facts about validity and soundness, it\nseems that-clauses must not only designate but must designate\nentities fitting the propositional role.  \n\nWhether propositions are needed for the semantics of natural language\nis a matter of continuing dispute.  For more on these matters, see the\nentry on theories of meaning.\n\n \n\nOur focus here will be on a different sort of argument. Here is a\nspeech the basic character of which should be familiar to undergraduate\nstudents of metaphysics: \n\nOne might attempt to regiment these remarks, somewhat artificially,\nto take the form of an argument, which we will dub the Metaphysics\n101 argument: \n\nFurther tinkering might improve the argument in certain ways. Our\nconcern, however, is whether the argument goes seriously awry. \n\nThe Metaphysics 101 Argument is not metalinguistic. It does not rely\non premises about English. This can be verified by noting that the\nargument looks just as good after it is translated into other\nlanguages. Nevertheless, it might be claimed that the argument derives\nits apparent force from a seductive mistake about how English (and\nother languages) function. Perhaps this is another case of what\nWittgenstein called “language on\n holiday.”[6] \n\nHow might one reply to the arguments for propositions just\ndiscussed? One might reply, of course, by arguing for the opposite\nconclusion. Thus, many have argued, on broadly naturalistic grounds,\nthat we ought not accept propositions. Any such argument will involve\ncontroversial claims about the nature and status of propositions. These\nissues are discussed in section 7. However, one increasingly popular\nreply to arguments for propositions is to argue, (1), that they\npresuppose the Relational Analysis, and (2), that the Relational\nAnalysis does a poor job of accounting for certain linguistic data. \n\nThe problem here is quite simple. If, as the Relational Analysis\nentails, attitude-ascriptions of the form ‘S\nVs that p’ assert relations to propositions,\nthen we should be able to replace ‘that p’ with\n‘the proposition that p’ without affecting\ntruth-value. But in general we can’t do this. Therefore, the\nRelational Analysis is false. Here are some examples of failed\nsubstitutions: \n 3. I imagine that it will snow this year. (TRUE)\n \n 4. So, I imagine the proposition that it will snow this year.\n(FALSE) \n 5. I remember that combustion produces phlogiston. (FALSE)\n \n 6. I remember the proposition that combustion produces phlogiston.\n(TRUE). \n\nThe class of attitude verbs for which substitution problems arise\n— the “problematic” attitude verbs — can be\ndivided into two subclasses: one consisting of verbs which do not\ngrammatically tolerate substitutions (e.g., intransitive verbs such as\n‘insist’, ‘complain’, ‘say’, and\nVPs of the form ‘Aux Adj’, such as ‘is\npleased’, ‘was surprised’); the other consisting of\nverbs which grammatically tolerate substitutions but for which\ntruth-value is not necessarily preserved (e.g., ‘expect’,\n‘anticipate’, ‘bet’, ‘gather’,\n‘judge’, ‘claim’, ‘maintain’,\n‘hold’, ‘judge’, ‘feel’,\n‘remember’, ‘know’, ‘recognize’,\n‘find’). \n\nFriederike Moltmann (2003) dubs this problem the Substitution\nProblem. (See also Vendler 1967, Prior 1971, Parsons 1993, Bach\n1997, McKinsey 1999, Recanati 2000, King 2002, Moffett 2003, Harman\n2003.) \n\nClosely related to the Substitution Problem is what Moltmann (2003, p.\n87) calls the Objectivization Effect, or objectivization.\nSubstitutions in some cases seem to force a new reading for the verb,\nan object reading rather than a content reading.\nThus, in ‘I imagine that it will snow this year,’\n‘imagine’ has the content reading (this is, by stipulation,\nwhat the content reading is!), whereas in ‘I imagine the\nproposition that it will snow this year,’ ‘imagine’\ntakes an object reading — it expresses the same relation that\nholds between subjects and garden variety objects such as those\ndesignated by NPs like ‘19th-century Wessex’ and ‘my\ncollege roommate’.  \n\nThe problem here can be described as follows. If the Relational\nAnalysis is true, then propositional attitudes are relations to\npropositions; but then it seems very odd that we should be unable to\nretain the content meaning by substituting ‘the proposition that\np’ for ‘that p’. \n\nDefensive Response #1. The above arguments against the\nRelational Analysis prove too much. Similar problems arise for the\nappeal to facts (as distinct from true propositions), properties, and\nevents in semantics. Here are several examples of substitution\nfailures. \n\nA difficulty for Defensive Response #1 is that it seems to spread a\nproblem around rather than solve it. One might argue that relational\nanalyses invoking propositions, facts, properties, and events all make\nthe same mistake of reading too much ontology into English. \n\nDefensive Response #2. From ‘S believes that\np’ we can infer ‘S believes the\nproposition that p’ and ‘S believes a\nproposition.’ And the same goes for ‘reject’,\n‘assert’, ‘deny’, and many other attitude\nverbs. If we concede that these sentences assert relations to\npropositions, then we are conceding that there are\npropositions. Against this, it might be argued that the many\nsubstitution failures give us reason to rethink the cases in which the\nsubstitutions go through. \n\nApart from such defensive replies, though, the relationalist might\nattempt to solve the problems. We will discuss two approaches. \n\nThe relationalist might claim that-clauses are ambiguous, and\nin particular that they pick out different kinds of entities depending\non which attitude verb they complement. How do we tell what kinds of\nentities are picked out? We look at substitution failures. Thus, it\nmight be argued the truth of ‘S remembers that\np’ requires that the subject bear the remembering\nrelation to a fact, rather than a proposition. After all,\n‘remember’ shows substitution failures for ‘the\n(true) proposition that p’ but not for ‘the fact\nthat p’. \n\nHowever, there are obstacles to this response. For one thing, some\nattitude verbs seem not to permit substitutions no matter which\nnominal complement is chosen. King (2002) gives the example of\n‘feel’. What sorts of entities, then, do that-clauses\ndesignate when they complement ‘feel’? No answer is\npossible. Is the Relational Analysis therefore false of such verbs?\nPerhaps even more damaging, there are verbs which are near synonyms of\n‘believes’, at least in attitude ascriptions, and which\ngrammatically take NP complements, but which exhibit substitution\nfailures and objectivization. ‘Feel’ is one example, as\nare ‘maintain’, ‘hold’, ‘judge’,\n‘expect’, and ‘suspect’. How could\n‘believes’ designate a relation to propositions in\nattitude ascriptions but these verbs not? (Consider also the\nnear-synonyms ‘assert’ and ‘claim’.) \n\nEven if the ambiguity hypothesis cannot provide the propositionalist\nwith a general solution to the Substitution Problem and the\nObjectivization Effect, it may help in explaining other\nlinguistic phenomena, such as the distributional differences between\nvarious nominal complements (‘the fact that p’,\n‘the proposition that p’, ‘the possibility that\np’, etc.).  (See Vendler 1967 and Moffett 2003.) \n\nNext, following Jeffrey King (2002), the propositionalist might give a\npurely syntactic answer to the problems. King (pp. 345–6) claims,\nfirst, that there is a very simple syntactic explanation for the\nsubstitution failures that produce ungrammaticalities: such verbs\ndon’t take NP complements at all, and so don’t take\nnominal complements, which are NP complements. (A verb can take\nthat-clause complements without taking NP complements, because\nthat-clauses are not NPs.) One might say something similar,\nfor example, about why we cannot substitute descriptions for names in\napposition (e.g., ‘The philosopher Plato believed in\nuniversals’ is true but ‘the philosopher the teacher of\nAristotle believed in universals’ is not true.) King claims,\nsecond, that the other class of failures are explained by shifts in\nverb meanings (i.e., because of objectivization). These shifts are due\nto syntactical matters, in particular the syntactic category of the\nverb complement. If the complement is an NP, the verb has an object\nmeaning. If it is a that-clause, it has the content meaning.\nKing recognizes the need for qualifications: verbs in the problematic\nclass can have the content reading with certain special NPs, e.g.,\nquantifiers (‘everything Bill holds, Bob holds’), and\nanaphoric pronouns (‘I hold that, too’.). In the final\nanalysis, King claims only that all the syntactic properties of the\ncomplement (and not just its general syntactic category) determine the\nverb’s meaning when taking that\n complement.[7] \n\nAlthough the dominant view in the literature is that the\nSubstitution Problem and the Objectivization Effect\nare problems principally for defenders of the Relational Analysis\n(e.g., Prior 1971, Bach 1997, Recanati 2000, Moltmann 2003; 2004), it\nis intriguing to ask whether some version of these problems arise for\neveryone — friend or foe of the Relational Analysis,\nfriend or foe of propositions.  \n\nAs noted above, there are near-synonyms which are alike in taking\nnominal complements but which differ with respect to substitutions.\nThis seems to be a fact that everyone must explain. It is hard to\nthink that the very slight differences in meaning between\n‘hold’ and ‘believe’ as they occur in\n‘S Vs that p’, could explain\nthe substitutional differences. Nor, as we saw above, does the\nambiguity hypothesis seem helpful here. It seems likely that the\nsubstitutional differences must be explained in terms of shifts in\nverb meaning. Because substitution does not affect the meaning of\n‘believe’, it must affect the meaning of\n‘hold’, and, intuitively, it does. This does leave the\nquestion of how the Objectivization Effect itself is to be\nexplained. But one might hope that a broadly syntactic solution\n— perhaps like King’s — would be available to anyone,\nregardless of one’s stance on propositions. \n\nIf these problems are problems everyone faces, some heat is taken\noff the relationalist, and the propositionalist generally. \n\nThat said, the relationalist may have to take account of other\nlinguistic puzzles. She will need to explain why it sounds so peculiar,\ne.g., to talk of “my believing what you desire, or my dreading\nwhat the thermometer indicated.” And, even with purely cognitive\nattitude verbs, similar puzzles arise: the mild peculiarity of “I\ndoubt/assert what you contemplate/entertain,” for example, will\nrequire explanation. (For more on these matters, see Vendler 1967 and\nHarman 2003.) \n\nLet us suppose, for the sake of argument, the linguistic problems\ndiscussed above undermine the Relational Analysis. Can a\npropositionalist dissociate herself from that analysis, and its\nlinguistic difficulties, while still endorsing the arguments we\ndiscussed for propositions in section 5.1?  \n\nSome modifications of the Relational Analysis do not avoid the\nlinguistic problems. For instance, it is not enough to claim that\nattitude verbs designate three-place relations between\nsubjects, propositions, and modes of presentation. \n\nOne possibility is to deny that attitude verbs designate relations\nwhen complemented by that-clauses, and to claim that they\nrather make a syncategorematic semantic contribution. Under one\napproach, that-clauses in attitude ascriptions designate\npropositions which serve to “measure” attitudes conceived\nof as mental particulars (Matthews 1994). It is not clear that this\nview will be immune to substitution and objectivization problems. See\nMoltmann (2003) for further discussion. \n\nAnother possibility is to abandon the Relational Analysis\naltogether, in favor of a version of Bertrand Russell’s “multiple\nrelation” theory. Following Russell (1911; 1913; 1918), Newman\n(2002) and Moltmann (2003; 2004), have recently argued that\nthat-clauses in attitude ascriptions do not designate\npropositions but rather provide a number of entities as terms of a\n“multiple” attitude relation. These philosophers\nnonetheless do accept propositions, and use them to explain sentences\nin which ‘proposition’ explicitly occurs, e.g.,\n(‘Some proposition that John believes is true’, ‘John\nbelieves the proposition that snow is white’). The basic idea is\nthat there are propositions, but they have the status of “derived\nobjects” — derived from our attitudes, which themselves are\nnot relations to propositions. It is an interesting question whether a\nRussellian is positioned to endorse the arguments for propositions\ngiven in section 4. (For more on the Russellian theory, see the\nsupplementary document: \n\nWe have suggested that the most promising arguments for propositions\nare the metalinguistic arguments and the Metaphysics 101 argument. The\nformer arguments are plainly theoretical: they appeal to the\nexplanatory power of semantical theories invoking propositions. To\nresist them, there is no need to explain away their intuitive appeal,\nbecause they do not and are not intended to have intuitive\nappeal. This is not true of the Metaphysics 101 argument.  It is\nthoroughly intuitive, and so resisting the argument requires giving a\nstory about how and why intuition goes wrong.  In this section, we\nwill consider one general strategy for doing this. \n\nThe Metaphysics 101 argument can seem Janus-faced: its premises seem utterly\nshallow, and yet its conclusion seems to resolve a\ndeep ontological debate. One is apt to think, “Sure, what\nI believe is different from my believing it. And so we can distinguish\nthe content of a belief from the attitude of belief. These contents are\npropositions. Fine, but now it seems there must be a domain of entities\nhere, whose nature remains to be investigated. How could that\nbe?” One might suspect some sort of equivocation or ambiguity is\nat work, some oscillation between a shallow and a deep interpretation. \n\nRudolf Carnap’s (1956) distinction between internal and external\nquestions may prove relevant here. For Carnap, an internal question is\na question that is asked within a particular linguistic framework.\nInternal questions are answered by invoking the rules of the framework\ntogether with logic and the empirical facts. Not all such questions are\ntrivial, but questions about the existence of the sorts of entities\ndefinitive of the framework are. Carnap in fact thought that the\ntraditional metaphysician aimed to ask a framework independent\nquestion, an external question, failing to realize that external\nquestions are best seen as non-cognitive practical questions about which\nframework to adopt and at worst meaningless. (See the link to Weisberg\n2000, in the Other Internet Resources section).  \n\nRelying on Carnap’s distinction, within certain linguistic\nframeworks, such as that presupposed by the Metaphysics 101 argument,\nit is almost trivial that there are propositions. All it takes is\nsomething as superficial as the Metaphysics 101 argument, or the\nfollowing even less enlightening argument, “The proposition that\nsnow is white is true; therefore, some proposition is true; therefore,\nthere are propositions.” The traditional metaphysician, however,\naims to ask a non-trivial question about the reality of the\npropositions outside such frameworks. Such questions have no cognitive\ncontent. \n\nOne of the chief difficulties for Carnap is to explain the truth of\ninternal statements. If ‘there are propositions’ is true,\neven within a framework, what does its truth consist in? If truth in a\nframework is explained in terms of truth given the axioms of the\nframework, we will want to know about the truth-value of the\naxioms themselves. If they are true, what makes them true? If they are\nnot true, why can’t we conclude that there really are no\npropositions? \n\nEven if we must reject Carnap’s internal/external distinction,\nperhaps some form of “Neo-Carnapian” ambiguity hypothesis\ncan help explain away the appeal of the Metaphysics 101 argument. \n\nA number of questions arise for the Neo-Carnapian. First, how are\nthe internal and external readings to be distinguished? Second, how\npervasive is the ambiguity? are there different readings not only for\nquantified sentences but for attitude- and truth-ascriptions as well?\nThird, what is the status of the Metaphysics 101 argument, given the\ntwo readings? The argument must be unsound when understood externally,\nbut must it be invalid, or is it a valid argument with a false premise?\nIf so, which is false? Fourth, how could philosophers regularly miss\nthe internal/external ambiguity? \n\nWe will briefly describe two Neo-Carnapian accounts. \n\nOne possibility is to explain the internal/external distinction by\nreference to fictions.  Internal statements are statements made within\nor relative to a fiction, and they are to be assessed as true or false\nrelative to the fiction.   \n However, any fictionalist interpretation of the internal/external\ndistinction would have to explain why the fiction of propositions,\nlike the fictions of properties and numbers, is not a mere game, but\ncan be used for describing reality.  We will briefly discuss a kind of\nfictionalism designed to do just this: figuralism. (For\ndiscussion, see Yablo (2000, 2001), Yablo and Rayo (2001), Yablo and\nGallois (1998), and for a similar view, Balaguer 1998a and\n1998b).  \n Relying on pioneering work by Kendall Walton (1990), Yablo argues that\npretense can serve serious practical and theoretical purposes. To use\nWalton’s example, by pretending that Italy is a boot, I can\neasily convey to you the location of the Italian town of Crotone. Here\nI am, in effect, using a pretense to convey information about the real\nworld. Literally, Italy is not a boot, but my interest is not in\nspeaking the literal truth, but in conveying a rather complicated fact\nto you as effectively as I can. Similarly, Yablo and Gallois claim,\none may pretend there are certain entities in order to better convey\ncertain facts (1998, 245–8). One might pretend there are directions in\norder to facilitate communication of facts about which lines stand in\nwhich geometric relations to which other ones. Perhaps one could do\nthe same with propositions? \n\nHowever, Yablo (2001) emphasizes that the figuralist need not be\ncommitted to any psychological thesis about\nmaking-believe. We may not consciously pretend that there are\npropositions when we say that what we believe is true, just as we may\nnot consciously pretend that there are such things as stomach\nbutterflies when we say we have butterflies in our stomach. Figuralism\nrequires only that there is a semantical distinction between literal\ncontent and figurative content, and that by asserting sentences with\ncertain false or at least highly doubtful literal contents, we may\nalso express genuine facts, which would be well nigh impossible to\nexpress literally. (See Balaguer 1998a and 1998b on the concept of\nrepresentational aids) \n\nFiguralism makes it possible to diagnose the failure of the\nMetaphysics 101 argument as follows. If its steps are interpreted\nliterally, the argument is unsound but valid. If its steps are\ninterpreted figuratively, it is sound. Why are we fooled, then? One\npromising suggestion is that it can be very difficult to distinguish\nfigurative from literal content, particularly when the figures\nemployed have little presentational force.  \n\nIf we accept this diagnosis, we are committed to thinking that every\nbelief-ascription is literally false. This is a bitter pill to\nswallow, though it may seem less bitter the less importance is placed\non literalness in communication (See Yablo 2001, p. 85). \n\nSome philosophers have suggested that ordinary English quantifiers are\nsusceptible to multiple readings, or different readings in different\ncontexts of use.  Thus, Hilary Putnam (1987, 2004) has argued that\nthere is no single meaning associated with the vocabulary of\nquantification, and that, depending on context, an assertion of\n‘there are Fs’ might be true or false.  For\nexample, the Polish mereologist, in certain contexts, might be able to\nspeak truly in asserting ‘any objects compose a further\nobject’, whereas an assertion of the negation of this sentence\nmight true in different contexts. (Note that Putnam is clear that the\nphenomenon he is describing isn’t mere quantifier-restriction.)\n The acknowledgement of different meanings for the quantifiers is\nnot enough by itself to explain away the intuitiveness of the\nMetaphysics 101 argument.  As we mentioned earlier, what is needed is\nan account of the apparent oscillation between a shallow and a deep\ninterpretation. There could, in principle, be a plurality of\ninterpretations of the quantifiers even if none of the readings\ndiffered with respect to metaphysical depth. \n Recently, Thomas Hofweber (2005, 2016) has claimed to have found the\nrequired pair of readings.  A quantifier, he claims, may have either a\ndomain-conditions or inferential role reading. The\ndomain-conditions reading is just the familiar reading we know from\nfirst order semantics: ‘there are Fs’ is true iff\nthere exists an entity in the relevant real domain which satisfies\n‘F’.  This reading is therefore ontologically\ncommitting and so deep (and thus external).  The inferential\nreading, by contrast, brings with it no ontological commitment, and so\nis shallow (and thus internal). \n Hofweber explains that the inferential role reading serves an\nimportant function.  It enables us the easy expression of partial\ninformation. For example, I might not recall a name or unique\ndescription of Fred’s favorite detective, but if I want express\nthe partial information I have, I can do this by saying “Fred\nadmires some detective.”.  Now, on the domain-conditions\nreading, what I express is false, and so I have misinformed my\naudience.  What we need, to achieve the desired end, is a reading for\n‘there is an F’ which validates existential\ngeneralization, regardless of whether the names occurring in the\npremise refer to an entity.  This is what the inferential role reading\nprovides.  Thus, we say “Fred admires some detective —\nyes, it’s Sherlock Holmes!” \n Hofweber points out that these two readings are not like the two\nreadings for ‘bank’. They validate many of the same\ninferences (e.g., ‘there is an F&G,\ntherefore, there is an F and there is a G’)\nand, within discourses lacking empty singular terms, they validate all\nof the same inferences.  \n Now for the relevance to the Metaphysics 101 argument.  On either\nreading of the relevant quantifiers in the Metaphysics 101 argument\n(those in steps 1, 2, and 4), the argument is valid.  But on the\ndomain-conditions reading, premise 1 (at least) is, if not false, then\nat least dubious — a piece of controversial ontology.  On the\ninferential-role reading, all the problems go away, and the argument\nappears completely shallow.  The Janus-faced character of the argument\ncomes from oscillating between the two readings.  Moreover, given the\nclose relations between the two readings, it is understandable that\nthe metaphysician fails to realize her mistake in thinking that the\nargument establishes the existence of propositions.  \n\nFor an account like Hofweber’s to succeed, it must be possible for\nattitude- and truth-ascriptions to be true even if\nthat-clauses do not designate. For if they designate, then\nthe domain-conditions reading of ‘there is something S\nbelieves’ would be true.  \n\nReflection on the proposition role leads many propositionalists to\nrather dramatic answers to questions about the nature and status of\npropositions. Below is one standard line of argument, versions of which\ncan be found in Bealer (1998) and Schiffer (2003). (See also Cartwright\n(1962) and Soames (1999).)  \n\nThe proposition that there are rocks, which we denote <there are\nrocks>, does not entail the existence of any beings that have or are\ncapable of having mental states. It entails this neither in a strictly\nor broadly logical sense. That is, it is possible in the\nbroadest sense for <there are rocks> to be true in the absence of\nall mental states. But now, if this proposition is possibly true in the\nabsence of mental states, then it possibly exists in the absence of all\nmental states, and so is mind-independent. This is an easy argument for\nthe mind-independence of at least some propositions. \n\nA parallel “easy argument” can be given for the\nabstractness of at least some propositions. <2+2=4> does not\nentail the existence of concrete entities. So it is possible for it to\nbe true (and so to exist) in the absence of concrete entities. Thus, it\nis possibly abstract. Assuming, contra Linksy and Zalta (1996), that\nabstractness is, necessarily, an essential feature of abstract\nentities, then it follows that <2+2=4> is in fact abstract. One\nmight want to extend such arguments to contingent propositions.\nConsider <there are trees>. This proposition is false in a world\nwithout concrete entities. But if it is false in such a world, it must\nexist in that world, and so is possibly, and so actually abstract. \n\nSimilar arguments can be constructed for properties. If properties\nare what we assert of objects and what is true/false\nof objects, then there are simple arguments for the conclusion\nthat at many properties are mind-independent and abstract. \n\nIt is dangerous to generalize these sorts of “Easy\nArguments” to all propositions (particularly singular\npropositions). But even if they cannot be fully generalized, they\nthreaten to show that propositions would be mind-independent abstract\nentities. Now, given that propositions de jure are sharable\nobjects of attitudes, it is antecedently unlikely that they should turn\nout to be, say, token utterances. But one might have thought that\npropositions could be identified with natural language sentence types\n(as in Quine 1960), or with sentence types in the language of thought.\nBut if the Easy Arguments succeed, it seems that to accept\npropositions, we must accept Platonism. Conceptualism about\npropositions seems ruled out. \n\nMany philosophers deny that there are propositions precisely because\nthey accept the validity of these Easy Arguments (and the truth of\ncertain attitude ascriptions). There are familiar problems besetting\nthe believer in abstract entities. The two “Benacerraf\nproblems,” in particular have received much attention in the\nliterature: the epistemological problem and identification\nproblem. The epistemological problem for abstract propositions,\nroughly, is this: how can we know about abstract propositions, given\nthat we cannot causally interact with them? The identification problem\nrequires a bit more explanation. If propositions are abstract, then\nthere will be many distinct candidates for propositions which seem to\nplay the proposition role equally well. If certain entities, the\nFs, are candidates for being propositions, why won’t the\nentities consisting of an F paired with the number 1 count as\nadequate candidates as well, so long as we reconstrue predicates for\npropositions in such a way as to make the number 1 irrelevant? But\npropositions cannot be both Fs and these new entities,\nbecause these new entities are not Fs. Is it simply\nindeterminate what propositions are? See the entry on\n platonism: in metaphysics.\n (See also J. Moore 1999) \n\nThe Easy Arguments can appear suspicious. How can the seemingly\nobvious acknowledgement that there are propositions — i.e., that\nbeliefs have sharable objects which bear truth-values — commit us\nto there being mind-independent abstract entities? We will discuss two\nsorts of reply found in the literature. Both are objections to the\ninference from there being propositions to the claim that\npropositions have the surprising features. We are putting aside\nobjections to the claim that there are propositions. \n\nThe Easy Arguments rely on an assumption about entailment and truth, namely: This assumption is needed to reason from premises about\npropositions failing to entail other propositions about there being\nmental states or being concrete entities to the possible truth of\nthose propositions in the absence of mental states and concrete\nentities.  \nBut how could (A) fail?  If a proposition fails to entail\nthat q, doesn’t it follow that there is a possible world in\nwhich the former is true and not-q?   \n\nSome philosophers (Pollock 1985, King 2007) have argued that\nprinciples like (A) have two readings, one clearly acceptable but\nuseless to the Easy Arguments and the other useful to those arguments\nbut false.  The two readings correspond to two ways of understanding\ntalk of truth with respect to possible worlds.  One way for something\nto be true with respect to a world requires the truth-bearer to exist\nin the world and be true there.  Another way is for the truth-bearer\nto “correctly describe” the world, where this does not\nrequire existing in the world.  Pollock gives the example of a picture\ndepicting the non-existence of all pictures.  The picture could\ncorrectly depict a situation even though the situation it depicts is\none in which the picture itself does not exist.  Similarly, the\nMedieval philosopher Jean Buridan discusses the example of an\nutterance of ‘there are no negative utterances’.  This\nutterance correctly describes a certain possible situation even though\nthat situation is one in which the utterance would not exist.\nFollowing Adams (1981), we may call the former way of being true with\nrespect to a world truth in a world and the latter truth\nat a world.  The conceptualist may claim that propositions can be\ntrue at worlds without being true in them, by analogy with the\nexamples from Pollock and Buridan.  A proposition like <there are\nno propositions> is true at certain possible worlds but true in\nnone.  Since we do not want to say that such propositions are\nnecessary, we must understand necessity as truth at every\npossible world.  Correspondingly, to preserve the connections between\nentailment and necessity, we must understand entailment in terms of\nthe entailed proposition being true at every world at which the\nentailing proposition is true.  Given all this, we can distinguish two\nreadings for Assumption A:  (Reading 1) If a proposition <p> fails to entail a\nproposition <q>, then there is a possible\nworld W such that <p> is\ntrue in W and not-q at W.  (Reading 2) If a proposition <p> fails to entail a\nproposition <q>, then there is a possible\nworld W such that <p> is\ntrue at W and not-q at W. Given the understanding of entailment in terms of truth at a world,\nthe conceptualist will claim that Reading 1 is false, while Reading 2\nis true but useless to the Easy Arguments.  Thus, the conclusions of\nthose arguments are blocked. \n\nThe plausibility of this response depends on having a good account of\nwhat truth at a world amounts to.  But this, in turn, depends on\nissues in the metaphysics of modality.   If worlds are concrete particulars (“I and all my\nsurroundings”), as they are for David Lewis (1986), then we\ncould say that a proposition is true at a world if the\nproposition is about the entities that are parts of that world and is\ntrue, and true in a world if true at a world and also part of\nthat world.  There may well be difficulties of explaining how a\nproposition could be part of more than one concrete world (and why it\nwould only be part of some concrete worlds but not all), but this\nframework seems to make conceptual room for the possibility\npropositions being true at worlds without being true in them.   \nSuppose, however, that worlds were conceived as world stories, i.e.,\nas maximal consistent sets of propositions (see Section 2). How, then,\nmight truth at a world be understood?  One approach, favored by Adams\n(1981), is to explain truth at a world in terms of truth in a world,\nunderstanding the latter to amount to truth were the world actual\n(were all its members true).  On this approach, we would understand\nwhat is true at a world in terms of what is true in it, together with\ncertain facts about the actual world.  However, the conceptualist\ncannot abide this approach.  For, on this approach, the members of any\nworld are true in that world.  But since the members of any and every\nworld are propositions, it would follow that, contrary to\nconceptualism, that it is necessary that there are propositions.  A\nmore conceptualist-friendly approach is to reverse the order of\nexplanation, to explain truth in a world in terms of truth at a world\n+ existence in that world.  How could truth at a world be understood?\nA natural proposal is to understand it as membership in a world\nstory.   Difficulties emerge with this proposal when we face the question\nof how to understand consistency of world stories. There are maximal\nsets of propositions that are not possible worlds because they are\nnot consistent in the relevant sense.  But the relevant sense\nis not easily defined. Following Adams (1981), we might wish to use\nthe concept of possibility to gloss the notion of consistency: a set\nof propositions is consistent if and only if those propositions could\nall be true together.  This returns us to the problem noted in the\nprevious paragraph: it again would turn out that necessarily there are\npropositions (even in mindless worlds).  \n\nThe conceptualist might hope to take the relevant notion of\nconsistency as primitive and reject the gloss in terms of joint\npossible truth.  Still, we should ask about the broader implications\nof denying the joint possible truth of consistent world stories.\nConsider, for instance the notion of actuality.  Only one of the many\npossible worlds is actual, although each is actual relative to itself.\nThe actual one, on the world story view, is the one all of whose\nmembers are true.  But if this is what actuality for worlds amounts\nto, then assuming possible worlds are possibly actual, it would follow\nthat for each possible world all its members could be true together.\nOught we to deny that possible worlds are possibly actual?   \nThe conceptualist might hope to avoid these problems, without falling\nback on Lewis’s concrete realism about possible worlds, by\nunderstanding worlds in terms of properties or states of affairs,\nrather than propositions.  Following Stalnaker (1976), one might think\nof worlds as properties which are ways things could have been.\nFollowing Plantinga (1974) and others, one might think of worlds as\nmaximal consistent states of affairs, where these are thought of as\ndistinct from propositions.  \nHowever, this retrenchment may end up only shifting the Platonist\nworries elsewhere.  To distinguish the ways that are possible\nworlds (or possible world-states) from those which are not, it is\ndifficult to avoid appealing to a gloss in terms of being possibly\ninstantiated: the possible worlds are not only maximal but they could\nbe instantiated. Taking this line would require conceding that in\nevery world there are properties.  Something similar holds for the\nconception of possible worlds as maximal consistent states of\naffairs.  \nOne might think, however, that Platonism about properties is less\nproblematic than Platonism about propositions.  The former do not\nrepresent the world, whereas the latter, as truth-bearers, do (Jubien\n2001, King 2007).  However, properties can apply or fail to apply to\nobjects, and can be said to be true or false of objects, and so it is\nnot clear that worries about representation clearly gain more traction\nfor propositions than for properties.  Similar considerations apply to\nstates of affairs. \nDespite these worries, the conceptualist might be encouraged by the\nexample of singular propositions.  Hasn’t the truth in vs. truth at\ndistinction been useful in dealing with the modality of singular\npropositions?  For example, consider any singular proposition about\nSocrates, e.g., the proposition that Socrates was a philosopher. Such\npropositions, plausibly, depend for their existence on the object they\nare directly about.  One might therefore think that no singular\nproposition about Socrates could exist unless Socrates existed.\nConsider, then, the proposition that Socrates does not exist.  It is\nclearly contingent that Socrates exists; things could have been\notherwise.  But then the proposition that Socrates does not exist\nwould appear to be possible without being possibly true.  Unlike the\nexamples from Pollock and Buridan, however, we cannot understand such\npossibility without possible truth in terms of expressing a possibly\ntrue proposition while not being possibly true itself.  Propositions\ndo not express propositions, of course, and so we cannot understand\ntheir possibility without possible truth in this way (Plantinga 1981).\nWhat is it, then, for such a singular proposition to be possible but\nnot possibly true?  Answering this question was one of the key\nmotivations in the development of the distinction between truth in and\ntruth at a world.  But while Adams and others attempted to do this by\nthinking of truth at a world as determined by what is true in that\nworld together with a certain set of facts about the actual world, the\nconceptualist hopes to kick aside the ladder of truth in a world\naltogether.  Whether this hope is reasonable or not is an important\nissue in contemporary work on propositions. (Key recent discussions\ninclude King 2007, Soames 2010, and Merricks 2015). \n\nAnother response to the Easy Arguments is, so to speak, to deflate\ntheir significance by deflating propositions. The Easy Arguments\nsucceed, but their success marks no great philosophical discovery and\nraises no hard questions of the sort that have traditionally bothered\nmetaphysicians of a nominalist bent.  \n\nWe will here discuss only Stephen Schiffer’s (2003) theory of\n“pleonastic\n propositions.”[8] \n\nPropositions exist, for Schiffer, but unlike rocks or cats, there is\nnothing more to them than what our concept of a proposition guarantees.\nOne may call them “abstract entities,” if one likes, but\nthis label should not encourage the thought that our minds can reach\nbeyond the physical world to make contact with denizens of a Platonic\nuniverse. We know about propositions, not by interacting with them, as\nwe do with rocks and cats, but by being participants in certain sorts\nof linguistic or conceptual practice. It’s because we speak or think in\ncertain ways that we are able to know about propositions. \n\nSchiffer argues, in effect, that given our proposition-talk and\nthought, propositions are, in D. M. Armstrong’s phrase, a kind of\n“ontological free lunch.” That is, the key\n“axioms” of our proposition-talk and thought are\nguaranteed to be true. These include the instances of the equivalence\nschema (E) for propositions: The proposition that p is\ntrue iff p. Given the truth of such axioms, it follows\nthat propositions exist and have the features attributed to them by\nour axioms. Moreover, because these axioms are constitutive of the\nconcept of a proposition, it follows that, by possessing that concept,\nwe can know the truth of these axioms. \n\nOne might concede to Schiffer that the axioms are constitutive of\nour concept of a proposition. But why think those axioms are true?\nSchiffer stresses that we do not make the axioms true by saying,\nthinking, or “stipulating” that they are true. The\nmind-independence of propositions, after all, is implicit in those\naxioms. \n\nSchiffer’s argument for pleonastic propositions is of a piece with\nhis argument for pleonastic entities generally, including fictional\nentities, events, and properties. A pleonastic entity, for him, is an\nentity that falls under a pleonastic concept. The latter is the key\nnotion and is defined as follows. \n A SFN (something-from-nothing) transformation (about Fs) is\na statement that allows us to deduce a statement about a kind of\nentity F, from a statement that involves no reference to\nFs. (61) SFN transformations assert a kind of\nsupervenience condition on Fs: if the relevant\nnon-F conditions obtain, Fs exist and have the\nrelevant features. (E.g., if snow is white, then the proposition that\nsnow is white exists and is true.)  \n If the concept F is pleonastic, then there are\nFs. We need to know how to tell if a concept is\npleonastic. Here is Schiffer’s test: Schiffer’s final formulation of the conservativeness test is:  \n\nOne might think the conservativeness test is overly complicated, and\nthat all that matters is that the new entities not interfere with the\nempirical world. If so, then the test would mention only empirical\ntheories not all theories. But, as Matti Eklund (2007) points\nout, two kinds of entity that are individually non-interfering with\nrespect to the empirical world might interfere with one another.\nSchiffer is aware of this problem (see his discussion of anti-fictional\nentities, pp. 55–6), and this is why he turns to the more complicated\naccount. \n\nSchiffer’s picture is this. If a concept satisfies the\nconservativeness test, then its instantiation would be unproblematic\nbecause it would interfere with nothing else. Its instantiation comes\nfor free. If a concept doesn’t meet this test, it doesn’t\ncome for free. \n\nAlthough Schiffer’s view of propositions can be described as\ndeflationary in one sense (because it attempts to deflate questions\nabout the existence and nature of propositions), the meta-ontology\nunderlying Schiffer’s approach is, if anything, inflationary: all\n“non-interfering” kinds of entity are instantiated. \n\nSchiffer’s, and other deflationist theories, must, at a minimum,\nanswer the following two questions, in addition to the questions facing\nall propositionalists: \n\nEven if Fs would be non-interfering in Schiffer’s sense, the\npostulation of Fs logically conflicts with some consistent\ntheories, e.g., ‘There are no Fs’. Schiffer\nplaces severer constraints on the denial of entities than on the\nacceptance of them.  Suppose Fs would be\nnon-interfering. Then adding them would not add information about\nnon-Fs. But suppose also that denying Fs would not\nadd information about non-Fs. Why isn’t this a reason to deny\nFs?  So, in this sense, the theory denying Fs passes\na corresponding conservativeness test. \n\nIf the proposition that snow is white is a simple, necessary and\neternal object, why does its having a property (truth) have anything\nto do with concrete snow’s having a property (whiteness)? Do instances\nof the T-schema simply state brute necessary connections between\nabstract objects and concrete ones?  Or do these necessary connections\nsomehow derive from our practices, and if so, how? \nAnother reaction one might have to the Easy Arguments is to accept\ntheir conclusions but to give an account of the nature of propositions\nwhich will make these conclusions palatable.  One promising line\nof thinking, in this regard, is to think of propositions as types, the\ntokens of which are mental or linguistic acts or events, and in\nparticular the acts that would be thought to express\nthe proposition.  Such views have been developed in recent years\nby Dummett (1996), Hanks (2011, 2015), and Soames (2010, 2014a,\n2015).  We focus here on the recent proposals put forth by Hanks\nand Soames. \nThe type view is motivated by its answers to otherwise puzzling\nfeatures of traditional Platonist views of propositions (e.g. Frege\n(1984)).  On this view, belief and other attitudes are understood\nas relations to already-existing propositions which represent things\nas being a certain way.  The truth or falsity of an individual’s\nbelief or other\ncognitive state is explained by the truth or falsity of the proposition\nwhich is the object of that state.  If truth consists in a\nrepresentation’s being accurate, then a proposition is true just in\ncase it accurately represents things as being a certain way. \nThus, on the traditional view, thinking subjects represent things as\nbeing a\ncertain way (either in thought or language) by standing in appropriate\nrelations to propositions which fundamentally represent things as being\na certain way. \nTwo problems arise for the Platonist’s position.  First,\nhow do cognizers come to be acquainted with such propositions? \nSecond, what explains how propositions represent things as being a\ncertain way?  Platonists appear to have no answer to the epistemic\nquestion, and presumably accept representation as a primitive feature\nof\npropositions.  Type theorists, however, explain the relation\nbetween a cognizer and a proposition simply as an instance of the\ngeneral relation between type and token.  Consider, as Dummett\n(1996, p. 259) does, one’s humming of a tune.  The tune is a\nspecies or type of musical performance capable of having multiple\nperformances at differing times or locations, while the humming of it\nis a\ntoken act belonging to that type.  One might then see the relation\nof a proposition to a mental or linguistic act as one between the type\nof act performed and the performance of the act. \nWhat type of acts should one identify with propositions?  For both\nHanks and Soames, propositions are types of predicative acts.  The notion of predication here is simply, for atomic propositions, one of an agent’s representing an object o as having property F.  (Hanks (2015, p. 64) characterizes predication as categorization,\nor the sorting of things into groups according to a rule.  We will take this to be a\nform of representation.)  Since representation is primarily\nsomething done by cognitive agents, according to Hanks and Soames, one might wonder whether the proposition itself\nis representational, and so possesses truth-conditions, on the type\nview.  Both theorists respond to this concern by claiming that\npropositions are representational in a secondary, derivative\nsense.  There\nare many examples of types that inherit features of their tokens (a\nsonata (type) can be discordant in virtue of performances of it being\ndiscordant; a movie can be frightening in virtue of its tokens being\nso, etc.  See the entry on types and tokens.)  Just as an act can be described as intelligent in order to communicate that the agent  acted intelligently in performing the act, type theorists will claim that a proposition represents o as F in a similarly derivative sense wherein any agent who performs the act of predicating F of o will thereby represent o as F. \nOne question that arises for such a view is whether propositions are\ngenuinely representational entities with truth-conditions, or whether\nthe claim that a proposition represents things as being a certain way\nis simply a convenient manner of speaking indirectly about the actual\nand possible representational acts of thinkers. \nAs we have seen, the type view reverses the traditional order of\nexplanation concerning the nature of predication, representation, and\ntruth-conditions.  On the traditional, Fregean picture,\npropositions exist as objective, mind-independent entities “waiting” to\nbe entertained, judged or asserted, so to speak.  On this view,\nfor a subject S to predicate F of o is for S to entertain the proposition that o is F; for S to represent o as F in thought or language is to have have a thought or utterance with the primarily representational proposition that o is\nF as its content, etc.  On the type view, a proposition’s\nrepresentational and predicative properties are derived from the\nfundamentally representational and predicative acts of agents. \nA concern for the type view is whether there will be “missing\npropositions” — truths or falsehoods which have never been\nentertained.  One drawn to the type view may allow for the\nexistence of uninstantiated types to account for the existence of these\npropositions.  However, given that propositions are claimed to\nderive their representational features from their tokens, such\nuninstantiated types would lack representational features, and so lack\ntruth-conditions.  Hanks suggests dealing with such propositions\ncounterfactually.  Even if no one had ever predicated eloquence of\nClinton, the proposition that Clinton is eloquent is true iff Clinton\nis eloquent because if someone were\nto predicate eloquence of Clinton, the token would be true iff Clinton\nis eloquent.  Predicative types, then, inherit their\nrepresentation features from both their actual and possible\ntokens.  This response, however, leaves us with the question of\ntruths for which there are not even any merely possible tokens — for\nexample, mathematical truths that are too complicated for any finite\nmind to grasp.  What, if anything, provides the truth-conditions\nof these propositions? \nHanks (2015, p. 27) allows that propositions are mind-independent and\nobjective entities which do not depend for their existence on having\nany tokens, just as one might think about a difficult type of dive that\nhas never been performed.  Thus, while Hanks’ view appears to be a\nrejection of a traditional Platonism about propositions, it seems\nnevertheless to accept a Platonism about types by untethering their\nexistence from their tokens.  (Compare to Dodd’s (2007) defense of\nPlatonism about types.)  Soames (2014a,b) also allows for\nuntokened types, but only those whose constituents have been referred\nto or predicated in other propositions.  For Soames, a proposition\np may exist in w even if no token of p has been performed in w.  For Soames, if in w a predicative event has occurred in which an agent predicates n-place property R of n objects, and in w events of referring to or thinking of objects o1...on have occurred, then the proposition that is the type of act of predicating R of o1...on\nexists (even if R has never been predicated of o1...on in w).  Still, it would seem that there can be truths in a world about objects that have never been thought\nof or referred to in that world.  In response to this, Soames claims that a\nproposition need not exist in a world w in order to be true in w. \nIn support of this, Soames appeals to other, albeit controversial,\ncases in which an object can have a property despite not\nexisting.  For instance, Socrates can have the properties of being referred to or being admired\ndespite no longer existing.  Thus, Soames’ accommodation of our\nintuitions concerning propositions that have never been thought appears\nto involve a rejection of Actualism. \nThe type view has been argued to provide solutions to several\ntraditional problems for propositional thought, including Frege’s\npuzzle, first-person belief, Kripke’s puzzle about belief, and the\nproblem of empty names.  In responding to these problems, Soames\ninvokes “Millian modes of presentation,” or ways of cognizing an object\nin thought which do not affect the representational content of the\nact,  to preserve a non-Fregean, Millian view of semantic content\nfor names and natural kind terms while individuating propositions\nfinely enough to solve traditional problems in the philosophy of\nlanguage.  Hanks, by contrast, invokes distinct types of\nreferential and expressive acts as the constituents of\npropositions.  On this view, each use of a name falls under\nseveral different reference types which differ in their fineness of\ngrain, each associated with a different proposition.  As we have seen, the type view is motivated in large part by the\nperceived need to explain how propositions represent things as being a\ncertain way on the grounds that a view which accepts primitively\nrepresentational propositions is objectionably mysterious.  Some\nquestion, however, whether the representational properties of\npropositions can (or need to) be explained at all (McGlone 2012,\nCaplan, et al. 2013, Merricks 2015). Merricks, for example,\nargues that we should accept that there are fundamentally\nrepresentational entities, but that we have no reason to favor mental\nstates (such as beliefs) over propositions as being the fundamental\nbearers of representational properties.  For if, e.g., beliefs\nare fundamentally representational, then it is either a primitive fact\nabout them that they represent what they do, or it is a feature\ncapable of explanation.  If it is a primitive fact about them,\nthen the view appears just as mysterious as one which accepts that\npropositions are primitively representational.  If it is a fact\ncapable of explanation, as the type theorists contend, then it is\npresumably explained in terms of an agent’s ability to predicate\nproperties of objects.  But unless there is some explanation of\nhow an agent can engage in predication, predication must itself be a\nprimitive representational ability, and the theory has not made any\ngenuine progress on what was to be explained. \nA final question worth considering at this stage is whether\npropositions are representational entities at all.  Richard (2013)\nand Speaks (2014), for instance, each develop views of propositions\nwhich deny that they are.  Consider the view defended by\nRichard.  Sentences, beliefs, and the like represent things as\nbeing a certain way — snow as being white, for example.  Put\nanother way, the sentence ‘Snow is white’ represents snow’s being\nwhite, where this is simply a way for things to be — a state of affairs\nor property that is either instantiated or not (but does not represent\nthings as being any way, just as properties are not in general\nrepresentational).  On this approach, the proposition expressed by\nthe sentence is identified with the way that things are represented as\nbeing, not as something which has representational properties either\nprimitively or in need of explanation by more fundamental acts of\npredication.  If an approach along these lines is correct, the\ntype view appears to lose one of its central motivations.  Some philosophers, notably W.V.O. Quine, recognize the existence\nof certain sorts of abstract entities but not others at least partly\non the basis of concerns about identity conditions.  Quine granted the\nexistence of sets, in part because they obey the extensionality axiom:\nsets are identical iff they have the same members.  When it came to\nproperties, relations and propositions, however, he found no such\nclear criterion of identity.  The property of being a creature with a\nheart, he noted, is distinct from the property of being a creature\nwith a kidney, even if all the same things exemplify the two\nproperties.  \nIt is a controversial matter whether Quine was right to demand such\nrigorous criteria of identity as a condition for acceptance of a class\nof entities.  However, even if Quine asks too much, any good theory of\npropositions ought to have something to say about when propositions\nare identical and when they are distinct.  Developing theories which\ngive such accounts in a way that fits well with intuitive data\nconcerning propositional attitude ascriptions would enhance our\nreasons to accept propositions.  \n\nThe question of identity conditions for propositions is importantly\nrelated to the question of whether propositions are structured\nentities. Propositions are structured if they have\nconstituents, in some broad sense, and the order of the\nconstituents matters. Order matters only if there could be two\nstructured propositions sharing all the same constituents, but which\nare distinct due to differences in the way under which those\nconstituents are “united” in the proposition. E.g., if the\nproposition that a loves b is the ordered triple\n<loving, a, b>, it is distinct from\nthe proposition that b loves a, which would be the\nordered triple <loving, b, a>. \n\nIf propositions are structured entities, then sameness of constituents\nand sameness of order will entail identity. There are, of course,\ndangers, in regarding propositions as structured. Prima facie, one\nwould rather not claim that the proposition that x is\ntriangular is identical to the proposition that x is\ntrilateral, since a subject might believe one but not the other. It\nwill be important, then, not to individuate propositions too coarsely.\nHowever, one might worry, in the opposing direction, about overly fine\nindividuations of propositions.  Is the proposition that John loves\nMary different from the proposition that Mary is loved by John?  For\nmore on structured propositions, see the entry on\n structured propositions.[9] \nAny theory that construes propositions as structured entities would\nseem to face the problem of the unity of the proposition.  It\nis not entirely straightforward to say what this problem or set of\nproblems is.  But at the very least, there are at least two problems\nhere.  There is the problem of explaining why one sort of structured\nwhole, a proposition, can be true or false, while the set of its\nconstituents is not.  A list isn’t true or false, and a proposition\nwith the same constituents is; why is this?  Second, there is a\ngeneral problem of explaining how two distinct things could have all\nthe same constituents.  For a thorough discussion of the history of\nphilosophical work on the unity of the sentence and the proposition,\nthe reader should consult Gaskin (2008). Some hold that propositions lack constituents altogether, and so are\nunstructured.  If propositions are unstructured, then if they are\nsets, they inherit\nthe identity conditions for sets: sameness of members. Thus, if a\nproposition is the set of worlds in which it is true (as in Stalnaker\n1976), then P=Q iff P and Q have\nthe same worlds as members iff P and Q are true in\nthe same worlds. As is well-known, this theory leads to a very coarse\nindividuation of propositions, too coarse, arguably, to handle\npropositional attitudes. (See Soames (1987) for a discussion of this\ntheory as well as the theory of propositions as sets of concrete\nsituations or facts. \n\nIf propositions are unstructured and distinct from sets, there are\nseveral possibilities for explaining their identity conditions. First,\nidentity conditions might be specified in terms of possible\nattitudes. One possibility is this: P=Q if,\nnecessarily whoever believes (asserts, denies, etc.) P\nbelieves (asserts, denies, etc.) Q, and vice versa.  Second,\nproposition identity might be reduced to property identity in the\nmanner of Myhill (1963) and Zalta (1983).  Thus, Zalta (1983, 72)\noffers the following definition of proposition identity:\n<p>=<q> if and only if the property of\nbeing such that p is identical to the property of being such\nthat q.  A third proposal, not incompatible with the second,\nis to explain proposition identity in terms of the “free\ngeneration” of propositions from a stock of certain\nnon-propositional entities, e.g., individuals, properties and\nrelations, by algebraic operations (Bealer 1982, Menzel 1986, Zalta\n1983 and \n 1989).[10]\n Although propositions on this approach are unstructured, each\nproposition may be represented by its “construction\nsequence.” To avoid identifying <Hesperus is beautiful>\nwith <Phosphorus is beautiful>, the relevant inputs cannot\nsimply be Hesperus (Phosphorus) and the property of being beautiful.\nA well-known strategy to cope with this problem, due to Frege, is to\nappeal to different modes of presentation associated with the\ndifferent names, each contributing something different to the\nproposition expressed.  However, these modes need not be understood as\ncomplex properties uniquely exemplified by referent of the name. For\ninstance, Bealer (1998) invokes what he calls\n“non-Platonic” modes of presentation.  Whether these\nnon-Platonic modes of presentation are understood as words, as causal\nchains of word use, or in some other way, the important point is that\nthe mode associated with ‘Hesperus’ will be different than\nthat associated with ‘Phosphorus’. Zalta (1989) introduces\npropositions with abstract constituents to do the work of these modes.\nOn Zalta’s view, such singular propositions are built out of abstract\nindividuals that encode the cognitive content of names. Since these\nabstract individuals encode this cognitive content, there is no need\nfor the referent of the name to instantiate it, and a fortiori no need\nfor the content to be a property uniquely instantiated by this\nreferent.  For more on encoding vs. instantiating, see section 6 of\nthe entry on existence.  Thus, these\ntheorists hope to use the metaphysical tools of these algebraic\naccounts to accommodate some of the key Fregean intuitions about\ndifferences in propositions expressed while avoiding difficulties with\nthe Fregean doctrine of sense. For a recent criticism of the notion of propositional constituency, see\nKeller (2013); for a positive account of propositional constituency,\nsee Gilmore (2014).  \n\nFrege famously wrote, “‘Facts, facts, facts’ cries\nthe scientist if he wants to bring home the necessity of a firm\nfoundation for science. What is a fact? A fact is a thought that is\ntrue.” (1918, p. 25) \n\nIs a fact just a true proposition? There are metaphysical and\nlinguistic arguments to the contrary. Here is a standard metaphysical\nargument. The fact that snow is white couldn’t exist if snow\nwasn’t white, but the true proposition would (only it would be\nfalse). Therefore, the fact isn’t the true proposition (See\nMoore 1953, p. 308). Facts might be, still, in some sense,\nderivative from true propositions, even if the identity claim fails.\nFollowing Moore (1953, pp. 261–2) and Slote (1974, p. 99), Kit Fine\n(1982, pp. 52–3) suggests that facts may be conceived as\nconcretizations of true propositions. Thus, the fact that p is the\ntruth of <p>. However, so construing facts makes them\npoor candidates for truthmakers: the truth of p, presumably,\nis not what makes <p> true. \n\nOne well-known linguistic argument against identifying facts with\ntrue propositions is closely related to the Ambiguity Response to The\nSubstitution Problem, considered in Section 5.4. Substitution of\n‘the fact that p’ for ‘the true proposition that\np’, or vice versa, produces peculiarities such as “John\nbelieves the fact that Obama is president”, or Harman’s (2003)\n“The true proposition that fires are hot makes it the case that\nfires are hot.” If facts were true propositions, so it is argued,\none would expect the substitutions to preserve truth. \n\nNonetheless, there are other uses of ‘fact’ that support\nthe identification: \n\nUsed in this way, ‘fact’ seems to apply to entities that\nresemble propositions, in that they have two modes of being: existence\nand something akin to truth (e.g., obtaining) (see McGrath\n 2003).[11] \n\nOne option, in the face of apparently conflicting uses of\n‘fact’, is to posit an ambiguity. (Fine 1982, p. 54) There\nare two kinds of entity associated with different uses of\n‘fact’: one kind has one mode of being (it simply exists),\nthe other has having two modes of being (it may exist without\nobtaining). “Bipolar” facts correspond, roughly, to what\nsome philosophers call possible states of affairs. \n\nHowever, some philosophers would want to distinguish even such\nbipolar facts from propositions. Bipolar facts, the argument goes, are\nstates of affairs, rather than true propositions. Clearly, not all\npropositions can be possible states of affairs, because there are\npropositions that are not possibly true, whereas possible states of\naffairs must obtain in at least some possible world. We might wish to\nextend the notion of a state of affairs to include impossible ones.\nWhether states of affairs, understood in this extended sense, are\npropositions clearly depends on the answers to questions about their\nidentity conditions. See the entry on\n states of affairs,\n as well as Richard (2013) for a recent view identifying propositions with states of affairs. \n\nKing (1995, 2007, 2014) argues that all propositions are facts, although\nnot the ones that we might expect. The proposition that Mary loves\nJohn is not the fact that Mary loves John but rather (to a first\napproximation) the following fact: Mary, loving, and John being the\nsemantic values of linguistic items standing in a certain syntactic\nrelation (represented by a phrase marker tree) which encodes\ninstantiation. King argues that his account has many virtues.  It\nhelps solve the problem of the unity of the proposition (see the\nprevious section), insofar as the structure of a proposition derives\nfrom the syntactic structure of a corresponding sentence.  It requires\nrelatively minimal ontological commitments: if one accepts that there\nare languages with expressions designating objects and properties and\nin which certain syntactic relations encode instantiation, then one\nwill accept King-propositions. The account also provides for finely\nindividuated propositions: differences in syntactic structure of\nsentences will carry over to differences in the propositions\nexpressed.  Given that the existence of King-propositions seems to\ndepend on their being language-users who use language in certain ways,\nKing is a conceptualist about propositions. (See section 7.2\nabove). \n\nIn discussing the question of whether there are properties, D. M.\nArmstrong (1989) distinguishes sparse from abundant conceptions of\nproperties. Following standard terminology, let us say that when a\npredicate has a property as its semantic content, the predicate\nexpresses that property. (For simplicity, we will assume that\nsentences can have propositions as semantic contents.) Under an\nabundant conception of properties, whether a predicate expresses a\nproperty depends only on its broadly syntactic facts about it. The\nsimplest abundant conception holds that every well-formed predicate\nexpresses a property. According to sparse conceptions, not every\nsyntactically well-formed predicate expresses a property.  \n\nA similar distinction may be applied to conceptions of propositions.\nAbundant conceptions will impose only broadly syntactic restrictions on\nthe expression of propositions. Sparse conceptions will deny that\nhaving the relevant syntactic properties is sufficient for the\nexpression and designation of propositions. \n\nOne motivation for accepting a sparse conception of propositions is\nexpressivism in metaethics. “Old-fashioned” expressivists\n(e.g., Ayer and Stevenson) claimed that moral sentences are\nnon-cognitive. We cannot believe that lying in politics is wrong, nor\ncan we have any broadly cognitive attitudes (e.g., disbelief) of the\nform ‘A-ing that p’ where\n‘p’ contains moral terms. If we cannot have such\nattitudes, then presumably there are no moral propositions. (If there\nwere such propositions, why wouldn’t there be possible cognitive\nattitudes having them as contents?). And if there are no moral\npropositions, then moral sentences do not express propositions, and so\nlack truth-value. \n\nWe certainly talk and think as if we have moral beliefs, as if we\nbelieve moral propositions. For the old-fashioned expressivist, then,\nmany of our apparently sincere ordinary claims will have to be\nrejected. Endorsing such a sparse conception of propositions thus leads\nto the surprising consequence all moral sentences lack truth-value. \n\nSome contemporary expressivists (Blackburn 1998, Horwich 1993,\nStoljar 1993) are less averse to moral propositions, moral properties\nand moral facts. But they take these commitments as\n shallow.[12]\n They accept an abundant conception of propositions, properties, etc.,\nbut combine it with a generous dose of deflationism. There are moral\npropositions, but they are mere shadows of moral declarative\nsentences. (Even if they are shadows of our sentences in some sense,\nthey are not shadows in another sense, at least if the Easy Arguments\nfor mind-independence and abstractness are successful: what is\nmind-independent and abstract is, in a clear sense, not merely a\nshadow of sentences.) \n\nAt least three important questions can be asked about the combination\nof expressivism and deflationism about moral propositions. First, if\nthe expressivist accepts moral propositions, what is the difference\nbetween expressivism and realism?  Second, by accepting deflationary\nmoral propositions, can the expressivist avoid the familiar problems\nfor moral realism (and cognitivism) which helped motivate expressivism\nin the first place? Third, can the realist avoid these familiar\nproblems equally well by accepting deflationary moral\npropositions? \n The first question is examined in the entry on\n moral cognitivism vs non-cognitivism.\n We will briefly discuss the other two. \n\nConsider, for example, the Humean argument facing realism, a crude\nversion of which is as follows. If there are moral propositions, then\nmoral judgments are beliefs in moral propositions. But moral judgments\nare intrinsically motivational states, whereas beliefs are not. So,\nthere are no moral propositions. Of course, this argument may be\ncriticized as relying on an overly strong internalism, or a\nsimple-minded speculative psychology. But even when improved, it is\nnot immediately clear how accepting deflationism about moral\npropositions will help the expressivist solve the problem. The moral\npropositions exist, and so why can’t they be believed independently of\nhaving any intrinsically motivating states?  How can their\ndeflationary character help defuse this question?  Moreover, suppose\nthat deflationism did help the expressivist cope with this problem.\nWhy couldn’t the realist follow suit with her own appeal to\ndeflationism? \n\nBlackburn’s supervenience argument is a second argument\nagainst realism. Blackburn formulated the argument in terms of moral\nproperties, as follows. If there are moral properties, then they\nsupervene on non-moral properties as a matter of conceptual necessity.\nThat is, in every conceptually possible world, if two things share all\nnon-moral properties, they share all moral properties. But if there\nare moral properties, the pattern of supervenience is not itself\nconceptually necessary. So, even if all Ps are Ms in\nfact, there is some conceptually possible world in which there is a\nP which isn’t an M. Blackburn’s question is this: if\nmoral properties can come apart from non-moral properties\nacross worlds, why can’t they come apart from them\nwithin worlds?  That is: what explains the “ban on\nmixed worlds”? A similar problem can be formulated for truth as\na feature of moral propositions. What explains the ban on conceptually\npossible worlds in which one moral proposition <x is\nM> is true, while another moral proposition <y\nis M> is false, but in which all relevant non-moral\npropositions <x is P> and <y is\nP> are alike in truth-value? What is not immediately clear\nis, first, how deflationary moral propositions will prove useful to\nthe expressivist in answering this question, and second, how,\nsupposing they do prove useful, why they won’t prove equally useful to\nthe realist. \nWhat the expressivist seeks is a conception of propositions (and of\ntruths, facts, and beliefs) substantive enough to explain and validate\nour ordinary realist-seeming discourse but deflationary enough to\navoid the traditional problems for realism.  Whether it is possible to\nnavigate the two is the subject of intense scrutiny in contemporary\nmetaethics.","contact.mail":"mcgrathma@missouri.edu","contact.domain":"missouri.edu"},{"date.published":"2005-12-19","date.changed":"2018-01-25","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/propositions/","author1":"Matthew McGrath","author2":"Devin Frank","author1.info":"https://philosophy.missouri.edu/people/mcgrath","entry":"propositions","body.text":"\n\n\n\nThe term ‘proposition’ has a broad use in contemporary\nphilosophy. It is used to refer to some or all of the following: the\nprimary bearers of truth-value, the objects of belief and other\n“propositional attitudes” (i.e., what is believed, doubted,\n etc.[1]), \nthe referents of that-clauses, and the meanings of\nsentences.\n\n\n\nOne might wonder whether a single class of entities can play all\nthese roles. If David Lewis (1986, p. 54) is right in saying that\n“the conception we associate with the word\n‘proposition’ may be something of a jumble of conflicting\ndesiderata,” then it will be impossible to capture our\nconception in a consistent definition.\n\n\n\nThe best way to proceed, when dealing with quasi-technical words\nlike ‘proposition’, may be to stipulate a definition and\nproceed with caution, making sure not to close off any substantive\nissues by definitional fiat.\n\n\n\nPropositions, we shall say, are the sharable objects of the\nattitudes and the primary bearers of truth and falsity. This\nstipulation rules out certain candidates for propositions, including\nthought- and utterance-tokens, which presumably are not sharable, and\nconcrete events or facts, which presumably cannot be false. These\nconsequences fit well with contemporary usage. Our definition leaves\nopen many of the questions dividing propositionalists: which additional\nroles are propositions fit to play? would propositions have to be\nmind-independent or abstract? what individuation conditions would they\nhave? how would they relate to facts? We examine these issues below, as\nwell as the fundamental issue of whether there are propositions at all.\n\n\n\nWe will attempt only the briefest history of the topic, focusing on\nkey episodes rather than on a comprehensive survey. \n\nIt is difficult to find in the writings of Plato or Aristotle a clear\nendorsement of propositions in our sense.  Plato’s most challenging\ndiscussions of falsehood, in Theaetetus (187c-200d) and\nSophist (260c-264d), focus on the puzzle (well-known to\nPlato’s contemporaries) of how false belief could have an object at\nall. Thinking that Theaetetus flies would seem to require thinking the\nnon-existent flying Theaetetus. Were Plato a propositionalist, we\nmight expect to find Socrates or the Eleactic Stranger proposing that\nfalse belief certainly has an object, i.e., that there is something\nbelieved in a case of false belief — in fact, the same sort of\nthing as is believed in a case of true belief — and that this\nobject is the primary bearer of truth-value. But it seems no such\nproposal is seriously considered. In both dialogues, it is suggested\nthat thought is a kind of inward dialogue carried on in the mind\nitself (Theaetetus 189e-190a and Sophist263e), and\nthat judgment results when the two inward voices affirm the same\nthing.  Plato is standardly understood as explaining false belief\n(doxa) in terms of the assertion of a false statement\n(logos). But it is far from clear that he takes the objects\nof belief to be statements rather than simply the ordinary concrete\nobjects (e.g., Theaetetus) and forms (e.g., flying) which the\nstatement is about, and still less clear that he takes statements to\nbe sharable between minds. Statements, for Plato, might\nsimply be tokens of inner speech, as Nuchelmans (1973, p. 21)\nsuggests. \n\nAristotle expends great energy in investigating what in reality\nmakes true statements true, but less investigating the nature of\ntruth-bearers themselves. In his most significant discussions of truth\nand falsehood, he seems not to take a clear stand on the question of\npropositions. In On Interpretation 1 16a, for instance,\nAristotle remarks that falsity and truth require combination and\nseparation, whether of names and verbs in speech, or of elements in\nthought. However, it is unclear whether the resulting combination of\nthought elements is anything other than a token thought, as opposed to\nsomething which is the content of the token thought and which could be\nthought by others, could be denied, asserted, etc. \n\nArguably, the first employment in the western philosophical\ntradition of the notion of proposition, in roughly our sense, is found\nin the writings of the Stoics. In the third century B.C., Zeno and his\nfollowers, including Chrysippus especially, distinguished the material\naspects of words from that which is said, or lekta. Among\nlekta, they distinguished the complete from incomplete (or\ndeficient), the latter corresponding roughly to the meanings of\npredicates, the former to the meanings of sentences. Among complete\nlekta they included axiomata, or the meanings of\ndeclarative sentences. For the Stoics, only axiomata, and not\nthe words used to articulate them, were properly said to be true or\nfalse. Axiomata were therefore the proper subject matter of\nStoic logic. \n\nLekta posed a problem for Stoic materialism, according to\nwhich everything real is corporeal. For the Stoics, the real was\nlimited to that which can act or be acted upon, and therefore to the\nbodily. Lekta, however, were thought to be incorporeal. Seneca\nexplains: \n\nThe notion of a proposition can also be found in the works of\nMedieval philosophers, including especially Abelard (1079–1142) and his\nfollowers, but also among later scholastic philosophers in England,\nincluding Adam Wodeham (d. 1358) and Walter Burleigh (1275–1344). \n\nAbelard distinguishes between dicta or what is said and\nacts of assertion (or thinking), the former being the fundamental\nbearers of truth-value. While Abelard himself seems to have had little\nto say about the nature or identity conditions of dicta, his\nsuccessors took up the subject with vigor (Nuchelmans 1973, pp. 162–3).\nAre dicta particular acts of thinking, concrete events or\nfacts, or entities having the same sort of being as universals? Each of\nthese views is considered and evaluated in the treatise Ars\nMeliduna, of unknown authorship. \n\nA similar debate raged among the English scholastics in the\nfourteenth century. Against Ockham’s nominalistic account, under which the\nobject of assent is a complex token mental sentence, Adam Wodeham, for\nexample, maintained that the object of assent is not any sort of mental\nentity, nor even a thing at all, properly speaking, nor of\ncourse a nothing but rather a being the case (see\nWood 2003, and Nuchelmans 1996, IV for further discussion of Wodeham\nand his contemporaries). \n\nOne complicating factor for the contemporary reader in examining\nMedieval (and later) work on the topic is that the term\n“propositio” was standardly used, following Boethius, to\nrefer to sentences, mental as well as written or spoken (oratio\nverum falsumve significans, i.e., speech signifying what is true\nor false).  Propositions in our sense were what was signified by these\n>propositiones if they signified at\n all.[2] \n\nWhen we turn to the early modern period, it is not easy to find, at\nleast in the writings of major philosophers, an unabashed assertion of\nthe reality of propositions. Unsurprisingly, one looks in vain in the\nwritings of the British empiricists. As for Descartes, particular acts\nof judgments serve as the primary bearers of truth-value (although\nthere is considerable debate about the status of his eternal truths).\nLeibniz’s cogitato possibilis have some of the characteristics\nof propositions. These possible thoughts seem to play the role\nof thought-contents and the fundamental bearers of truth-value.\nHowever, it is a matter of debate whether they are accorded real\nontological status. \n\nPropositionalists were by no means rare in the 19th century, Gottlob\nFrege being the best known example. The Czech philosopher and\nmathematician Bernard Bolzano also deserves special mention. In his\nWissenschaftslehre, or Theory of Science, published\nin 1837, he argued for the existence of what he called\n‘Sätze an sich,’ or sentences in themselves,\nwhich he clearly distinguished from linguistic items or mental\nphenomena.  They are the fundamental bearers of truth and falsity, and\nthe objects of the attitudes.  It is the goal of every science,\nincluding mathematics, to state the fundamental true sentences in\nthemselves pertaining that subject matter. (This marks a clear\ndeparture from the psychologizing approaches of many of Bolzano’s\ncontemporaries.)  Like Frege after him, Bolzano conceived of\npropositions as complexes composed of wholly abstract mind-independent\nconstituents (Vorstellungen an sich). Bolzano’s work\nhas had a profound influence on Husserlian phenomenology and the\ndevelopment of modern logic. \n\nArguably, the three figures whose work has most shaped the framework\nfor contemporary Anglophone work on propositions are Gottlob Frege,\nG.E. Moore, and Bertrand Russell. We will give short summaries of their\nthought on the matter. \n\nIn 1892, Frege published his classic paper “On Sense and\nReference”. This paper contains his first formulation of the\ndistinction between sense (Sinn) and reference\n(Bedeutung). Roughly speaking, the sense of an expression is\nthe mode of presentation of its referent, or the cognitive value of\nits referent. Expressions were said to express their\nsenses. Sentences, too, had both referents and senses, according to\nFrege. The referent of a sentence is its truth-value. Its sense is a\nthought (Beaney 1997, p. 156), not a token thought, but a thought in\nthe sense of a proposition: a sharable content. Thus, in Fregean\njargon, meaningful sentences express thoughts. \n\nFrege conceived of thoughts as structured complexes of senses. The\nthought expressed by ‘The evening star is bright’ consists\nof the sense of ‘the evening star’ and the sense of ‘is\nbright’. (It should be noted that this claim about structure does\nnot strictly follow from the fact that sense is compositional, i.e.,\nthat the sense of a whole expression is fixed by the senses of its constituent\nparts and their syntactic mode of arrangement.) In his late\nmasterpiece, “The Thought” (1922), Frege is explicit about\nthe nature of thoughts. They are not part of the outer realm, which\nconsists of those entities perceivable by the senses. This Frege thinks\nis obvious. Nor are they part of the inner realm, which consists of\nideas. Unlike ideas, thoughts do not require an owner (i.e., they exist\neven if not present in any mind), and can be present to more than one\nmind. A third realm must be recognized, he tells us — a realm of\nabstract eternal entities which we can grasp by virtue of our\npower of thinking. However, Frege is explicit that thoughts do act: \n\nThis is perhaps the locus classicus for platonism in the\nmodern sense of that term, that is, for the doctrine that there exist\nmind-independent abstract entities. \n\nIn their early writings, Russell and Moore endorse propositionalism.\nIn his 1903 book The Principles of Mathematics, Russell\naffirms the existence of propositions, taking them to be complexes of\nordinary concrete objects (the referents of words) rather than of\nFregean senses (p. 47). Propositions so conceived are now standardly\ncalled Russellian, and propositions conceived as complexes of\nsenses or abstract entities are called Fregean. In his\n1899 paper, “The Nature of Judgment,” Moore affirms the\nexistence of propositions, taking them to be broadly Fregean in nature\n(in particular as being complexes of mind-independent Platonic\nuniversals which he calls concepts). \n\nRussell and Moore later grow suspicious of propositions (although\nRussell seems to have accepted them later as a kind of derived or\nimmanent entity). Interestingly, Moore’s thinking on the matter seems\nto have changed dramatically during the winter of 1910–11, as his\npublished lectures Some Main Problems of Philosophy reveal.\nBefore Christmas, Moore claims: \n\nAfter Christmas, Moore is more skeptical. While the theory of\npropositions is admittedly simple and natural (p. 286), there are good\nreasons to reject it. He specifies two problems, both having to do with\nfacts, a topic he avoided in his earlier lectures. The first\nis that the theory of propositions suggests the\n“primitivist” theory of truth, previously held by Moore and\nalso Russell, according to which truth is a simple unanalyzable\nproperty of propositions. Primitivism, Moore now claims, requires the\nclaim that facts consist in the possession by a proposition of the\nsimple property of truth. This Moore now finds unacceptable. The second\nproblem is simply that the theory seems intuitively false: \n\nRussell echoes similar sentiments in essays after\nPrinciples. In 1910 he writes that “we feel that there\ncould be no falsehood if there were no minds to make mistakes”\n(Slater 1992, p. 119), and in the 1918 he remarks that a person with\n“a vivid instinct as to what is real” cannot “suppose\nthat there is a whole set of false propositions about ” [Russell\n1956, p. 223). \n\nThese doubts led Russell (1912) to propose a multiple relation\ntheory of judgment, to replace the standard two-place relational theory\n(which is discussed at length in section 3.1). To use Russell’s\nexample, in judging that Desdemona loves Cassio, Othello stands, not\nin a binary relation to a proposition, but rather in a multiple or\nmany-placed relation to Desdemona, loving, and Cassio.\nOthello’s judgment is true when there is a fact of Desdemona loving\nCassio and otherwise false. This theory, and its contemporary\nincarnations, is discussed in a supplementary document. \n\nMoore’s doubts led him to postulate what appear to be merely\npossible facts as the objects of the propositional attitudes. When a\nsubject believes that x is F and x is not F, the object of belief is\nthe non-existent but possible fact that x is F. See section below for\nfurther discussion of possible facts and their relations to\npropositions. \n\nIf there are propositions, they would appear to be good\ncandidates for being the bearers of alethic modal properties (necessary\nand possible truth), as well as the relata of entailment. And\nif propositions stand in entailment relations, then there would seem to\nbe maximal consistent sets of them. Prima facie, such sets seem to be\ngood candidates for possible worlds (Adams 1974; 1981). A proposition\nwill be true in a possible world (at a maximal consistent set of\npropositions) iff it is a member of that world. \n\nIf possible worlds are understood in this way, however, it is\nimportant to distinguish two meanings for talk of ‘the actual\nworld’. This may refer either to the totality of what exists, to\nwhat Lewis calls “I and all my surroundings”, or to the maximal\nconsistent set which includes all the true propositions. The latter is\npart of I and all my surroundings, but only a proper part. \n\nBy our stipulation, ‘proposition’ is used to pick out\nthe objects of the attitudes and the bearers of truth and falsity. One\nwould therefore expect that if there are propositions, they would\nfigure importantly in the semantics of attitude- and truth-ascriptions.\nOne would expect, in particular, that in ‘S believes that\np’, and in ‘that p is true’, the\nthat-clauses would refer to\n propositions.[3] \n\nOne might doubt whether that-clauses could really\nrefer, if reference is understood on the model of proper\nnames. For, that-clauses are not proper names, nor are they\nnoun\n phrases.[4]\n Still, because propositions are the objects\nof the attitudes and the bearers of truth, mustn’t they somehow\nbe semantically associated with ascriptions of attitudes and of truth?\nFollowing Jeffrey King (2002), we will use the term\n‘designate’ as a catch-all covering any sort of semantic\nassociation between a linguistic item and an entity. We follow standard\nterminology in using the word ‘express’ to pick out the\nrelation between a predicate and the property which is its sense or\nsemantic content. \n\nMore carefully, then, the propositionalist will find it natural to\naccept the following account of attitude-ascriptions: \n\nThe Relational Analysis of Attitude Ascriptions \n\nAn attitude ascription ‘S Vs that\np’ is true iff ‘S’ designates a\nperson who stands in the attitude relation expressed by\n‘V’ to the proposition designated by ‘that\np’ (and false iff ‘S’ designates a\nperson who doesn’t stand in such relation to such a proposition). \n\nAnalogously, there is the Property Analysis of\ntruth-ascriptions: \n\nOne of the great advantages of these analyses — the combination of\nwhich we will simply call The Relational Analysis — is the\nsmooth explanation of the validity of certain inferences. Consider, for\nexample: \n\nCharles believes everything Thomas said.\n\nThomas said that cats purr.\n\nSo, Charles believes that cats purr. \n\nSomething Barbara asserted is true.\n\nNothing John denied is true.\n\nSo, something Barbara asserted John did not deny. \n\nJohn believes that every even is the sum of two primes.\n\nGoldbach’s Conjecture is that every even is the sum of two primes.\n\nSo, John believes Goldbach’s Conjecture. \n\nThese inferences are valid if they have the following simple logical\nforms: \n\nFor all x such that Thomas said x, Charlie believes\nx. \n  Thomas said A. \n  So, Charlie believes A. \n\nSome x such that Barbara asserted x is true.\n \nNo x such that John denied x is true.\n \nSo, some x such that Barbara asserted x is such\n that John did not deny x. \n\nJohn believes A.\n \nGoldbach’s Conjecture is A.\n \nSo, John believes Goldbach’s Conjecture. \n\nWe will discuss problems for the Relational Analysis in Section\n 5.[5] \n\nPropositions are also commonly treated as the meanings or, to use\nthe more standard terminology, the semantic contents of\nsentences, and so are commonly taken to be central to semantics and the\nphilosophy of language. However, there is room for doubt about whether\npropositions are the right sort of entity for the job (Lewis 1980).\nHere is why. Note that a sentence would appear to contribute the same\ncontent regardless of whether it occurs as a proper part of a larger\nsentence. So, a sentence such as ‘in the past, Reagan was\npresident’ would seem to be true depending on whether the content\nof ‘Reagan is president’ is true at some past time. But\nthis would seem to imply that this content must lack temporal\nqualification — that it can change in its truth-value over time.\nSimilarly, it seems there are locative sentential operators ‘in\nChicago, it is raining’. If so, then by a similar argument, it\nwould seem that the content of ‘it is raining’ would have\nto lack spatial qualification. The problem is this: it seems\npropositions, being the objects of belief, cannot in general\nbe spatially and temporally unqualified. Suppose that Smith, in London,\nlooks out his window and forms the belief that it is raining. Suppose\nthat Ramirez, in Madrid, relying on yesterday’s weather report, awakens\nand forms the belief that it is raining, before looking out the\nwindow to see sunshine. What Smith believes is true, while what Ramirez\nbelieves is false. So they must not believe the same proposition. But\nif propositions were generally spatially unqualified, they would\nbelieve the same proposition. An analogous argument can be given to\nshow that what is believed must not in general be temporally\nunqualified. \n\nIf these worries are well-taken, then the meanings or contents of\nsentences are not in general propositions. \n\nAppealing to recent work in linguistics, Jeffrey C. King (2003)\npresents evidence against one of the crucial assumptions of the above\narguments, that there are no genuine locational or temporal operators\nin English. King claims that ‘somewhere’ and\n‘sometimes’ are better regarded as quantifiers over\nlocational and temporal entities (i.e., either locations and times\nthemselves or locational or temporal properties of events). Thus,\n‘somewhere, it is raining’ would have the logical form\n‘there is some location L such that it is raining at\nL’.  King further argues that tenses are best analyzed\nas quantifiers over times rather than temporal operators. ‘John\nflunked chemistry’, thus, would have the form ‘there is\nsome time t within I* such that John flunks\nchemistry at t’, where the interval I* is\ncontextually supplied. These analyses, of course, require the\ncontroversial claim that predicates like ‘is raining’ and\n‘flunks ’ include extra argument places for locations and\ntimes. \n\nKing emphasizes that his argument is thoroughly empirical. It relies\non results from empirical linguistics. If King is right, however, the\nview that the contents of sentences are propositions can be\nmaintained. \nFor other criticisms of Lewis’s argument, see Richard (1982), Salmon\n(1989) and Cappelen and Hawthorne (2010).  Brogaard (2012) provides a defense of the temporalist view of propositions. \n\nOne familiar argument for propositions appeals to commonalties\nbetween beliefs, utterances, or sentences, and infers a common entity.\nThus, it has been suggested, less in print perhaps than in\nconversation, that propositions are needed to play the role of being\nwhat synonymous sentences have in common, what a sentence and its\ntranslation into another language have in common, etc. \n\nArguments of this sort are typically met with the following reply:\ncommonalties do not necessarily require common relations to a single\nentity. Two red things have something in common, in that they are both\nred, but it does not follow that they bear a common relation\nto a single entity, the universal of redness. Similarly, two\nsentences, in virtue of being synonymous, can be said to have\nsomething in common, but that fact alone does not entail they are\ncommonly related to a proposition. When a relation R is\nsymmetric and reflexive with respect to a certain domain, it may be\nuseful to speak of the things in the domain which bear R to\none another as “having something in common”, but nothing\nof ontological significance follows. Thus, the conclusion is drawn: we\nneed an argument for thinking that commonalties require common\nrelations to a single entity.  \n\nOne standard sort of argument for propositions is\nmetalinguistic. Thus, many argue that we think of\nthat-clauses as designating expressions if we are to explain\nhow certain argument patterns (such as those considered in Section 2)\nare valid and in fact have sound instances (Horwich 1990, Higginbotham\n1991, Schiffer 1996, Bealer 1998). Since some of these sound argument\ninstances contain as premises sentences attributing truth to the\ndesignata of that-clauses, those designata must be bearers of\ntruth-values.  Similarly, premises of some of these sound instances\nascribe attitudes toward the designatum of a that-clauses,\nthese designata would seem to be objects of attitudes.  In brief, in\norder to explain these facts about validity and soundness, it\nseems that-clauses must not only designate but must designate\nentities fitting the propositional role.  \n\nWhether propositions are needed for the semantics of natural language\nis a matter of continuing dispute.  For more on these matters, see the\nentry on theories of meaning.\n\n \n\nOur focus here will be on a different sort of argument. Here is a\nspeech the basic character of which should be familiar to undergraduate\nstudents of metaphysics: \n\nOne might attempt to regiment these remarks, somewhat artificially,\nto take the form of an argument, which we will dub the Metaphysics\n101 argument: \n\nFurther tinkering might improve the argument in certain ways. Our\nconcern, however, is whether the argument goes seriously awry. \n\nThe Metaphysics 101 Argument is not metalinguistic. It does not rely\non premises about English. This can be verified by noting that the\nargument looks just as good after it is translated into other\nlanguages. Nevertheless, it might be claimed that the argument derives\nits apparent force from a seductive mistake about how English (and\nother languages) function. Perhaps this is another case of what\nWittgenstein called “language on\n holiday.”[6] \n\nHow might one reply to the arguments for propositions just\ndiscussed? One might reply, of course, by arguing for the opposite\nconclusion. Thus, many have argued, on broadly naturalistic grounds,\nthat we ought not accept propositions. Any such argument will involve\ncontroversial claims about the nature and status of propositions. These\nissues are discussed in section 7. However, one increasingly popular\nreply to arguments for propositions is to argue, (1), that they\npresuppose the Relational Analysis, and (2), that the Relational\nAnalysis does a poor job of accounting for certain linguistic data. \n\nThe problem here is quite simple. If, as the Relational Analysis\nentails, attitude-ascriptions of the form ‘S\nVs that p’ assert relations to propositions,\nthen we should be able to replace ‘that p’ with\n‘the proposition that p’ without affecting\ntruth-value. But in general we can’t do this. Therefore, the\nRelational Analysis is false. Here are some examples of failed\nsubstitutions: \n 3. I imagine that it will snow this year. (TRUE)\n \n 4. So, I imagine the proposition that it will snow this year.\n(FALSE) \n 5. I remember that combustion produces phlogiston. (FALSE)\n \n 6. I remember the proposition that combustion produces phlogiston.\n(TRUE). \n\nThe class of attitude verbs for which substitution problems arise\n— the “problematic” attitude verbs — can be\ndivided into two subclasses: one consisting of verbs which do not\ngrammatically tolerate substitutions (e.g., intransitive verbs such as\n‘insist’, ‘complain’, ‘say’, and\nVPs of the form ‘Aux Adj’, such as ‘is\npleased’, ‘was surprised’); the other consisting of\nverbs which grammatically tolerate substitutions but for which\ntruth-value is not necessarily preserved (e.g., ‘expect’,\n‘anticipate’, ‘bet’, ‘gather’,\n‘judge’, ‘claim’, ‘maintain’,\n‘hold’, ‘judge’, ‘feel’,\n‘remember’, ‘know’, ‘recognize’,\n‘find’). \n\nFriederike Moltmann (2003) dubs this problem the Substitution\nProblem. (See also Vendler 1967, Prior 1971, Parsons 1993, Bach\n1997, McKinsey 1999, Recanati 2000, King 2002, Moffett 2003, Harman\n2003.) \n\nClosely related to the Substitution Problem is what Moltmann (2003, p.\n87) calls the Objectivization Effect, or objectivization.\nSubstitutions in some cases seem to force a new reading for the verb,\nan object reading rather than a content reading.\nThus, in ‘I imagine that it will snow this year,’\n‘imagine’ has the content reading (this is, by stipulation,\nwhat the content reading is!), whereas in ‘I imagine the\nproposition that it will snow this year,’ ‘imagine’\ntakes an object reading — it expresses the same relation that\nholds between subjects and garden variety objects such as those\ndesignated by NPs like ‘19th-century Wessex’ and ‘my\ncollege roommate’.  \n\nThe problem here can be described as follows. If the Relational\nAnalysis is true, then propositional attitudes are relations to\npropositions; but then it seems very odd that we should be unable to\nretain the content meaning by substituting ‘the proposition that\np’ for ‘that p’. \n\nDefensive Response #1. The above arguments against the\nRelational Analysis prove too much. Similar problems arise for the\nappeal to facts (as distinct from true propositions), properties, and\nevents in semantics. Here are several examples of substitution\nfailures. \n\nA difficulty for Defensive Response #1 is that it seems to spread a\nproblem around rather than solve it. One might argue that relational\nanalyses invoking propositions, facts, properties, and events all make\nthe same mistake of reading too much ontology into English. \n\nDefensive Response #2. From ‘S believes that\np’ we can infer ‘S believes the\nproposition that p’ and ‘S believes a\nproposition.’ And the same goes for ‘reject’,\n‘assert’, ‘deny’, and many other attitude\nverbs. If we concede that these sentences assert relations to\npropositions, then we are conceding that there are\npropositions. Against this, it might be argued that the many\nsubstitution failures give us reason to rethink the cases in which the\nsubstitutions go through. \n\nApart from such defensive replies, though, the relationalist might\nattempt to solve the problems. We will discuss two approaches. \n\nThe relationalist might claim that-clauses are ambiguous, and\nin particular that they pick out different kinds of entities depending\non which attitude verb they complement. How do we tell what kinds of\nentities are picked out? We look at substitution failures. Thus, it\nmight be argued the truth of ‘S remembers that\np’ requires that the subject bear the remembering\nrelation to a fact, rather than a proposition. After all,\n‘remember’ shows substitution failures for ‘the\n(true) proposition that p’ but not for ‘the fact\nthat p’. \n\nHowever, there are obstacles to this response. For one thing, some\nattitude verbs seem not to permit substitutions no matter which\nnominal complement is chosen. King (2002) gives the example of\n‘feel’. What sorts of entities, then, do that-clauses\ndesignate when they complement ‘feel’? No answer is\npossible. Is the Relational Analysis therefore false of such verbs?\nPerhaps even more damaging, there are verbs which are near synonyms of\n‘believes’, at least in attitude ascriptions, and which\ngrammatically take NP complements, but which exhibit substitution\nfailures and objectivization. ‘Feel’ is one example, as\nare ‘maintain’, ‘hold’, ‘judge’,\n‘expect’, and ‘suspect’. How could\n‘believes’ designate a relation to propositions in\nattitude ascriptions but these verbs not? (Consider also the\nnear-synonyms ‘assert’ and ‘claim’.) \n\nEven if the ambiguity hypothesis cannot provide the propositionalist\nwith a general solution to the Substitution Problem and the\nObjectivization Effect, it may help in explaining other\nlinguistic phenomena, such as the distributional differences between\nvarious nominal complements (‘the fact that p’,\n‘the proposition that p’, ‘the possibility that\np’, etc.).  (See Vendler 1967 and Moffett 2003.) \n\nNext, following Jeffrey King (2002), the propositionalist might give a\npurely syntactic answer to the problems. King (pp. 345–6) claims,\nfirst, that there is a very simple syntactic explanation for the\nsubstitution failures that produce ungrammaticalities: such verbs\ndon’t take NP complements at all, and so don’t take\nnominal complements, which are NP complements. (A verb can take\nthat-clause complements without taking NP complements, because\nthat-clauses are not NPs.) One might say something similar,\nfor example, about why we cannot substitute descriptions for names in\napposition (e.g., ‘The philosopher Plato believed in\nuniversals’ is true but ‘the philosopher the teacher of\nAristotle believed in universals’ is not true.) King claims,\nsecond, that the other class of failures are explained by shifts in\nverb meanings (i.e., because of objectivization). These shifts are due\nto syntactical matters, in particular the syntactic category of the\nverb complement. If the complement is an NP, the verb has an object\nmeaning. If it is a that-clause, it has the content meaning.\nKing recognizes the need for qualifications: verbs in the problematic\nclass can have the content reading with certain special NPs, e.g.,\nquantifiers (‘everything Bill holds, Bob holds’), and\nanaphoric pronouns (‘I hold that, too’.). In the final\nanalysis, King claims only that all the syntactic properties of the\ncomplement (and not just its general syntactic category) determine the\nverb’s meaning when taking that\n complement.[7] \n\nAlthough the dominant view in the literature is that the\nSubstitution Problem and the Objectivization Effect\nare problems principally for defenders of the Relational Analysis\n(e.g., Prior 1971, Bach 1997, Recanati 2000, Moltmann 2003; 2004), it\nis intriguing to ask whether some version of these problems arise for\neveryone — friend or foe of the Relational Analysis,\nfriend or foe of propositions.  \n\nAs noted above, there are near-synonyms which are alike in taking\nnominal complements but which differ with respect to substitutions.\nThis seems to be a fact that everyone must explain. It is hard to\nthink that the very slight differences in meaning between\n‘hold’ and ‘believe’ as they occur in\n‘S Vs that p’, could explain\nthe substitutional differences. Nor, as we saw above, does the\nambiguity hypothesis seem helpful here. It seems likely that the\nsubstitutional differences must be explained in terms of shifts in\nverb meaning. Because substitution does not affect the meaning of\n‘believe’, it must affect the meaning of\n‘hold’, and, intuitively, it does. This does leave the\nquestion of how the Objectivization Effect itself is to be\nexplained. But one might hope that a broadly syntactic solution\n— perhaps like King’s — would be available to anyone,\nregardless of one’s stance on propositions. \n\nIf these problems are problems everyone faces, some heat is taken\noff the relationalist, and the propositionalist generally. \n\nThat said, the relationalist may have to take account of other\nlinguistic puzzles. She will need to explain why it sounds so peculiar,\ne.g., to talk of “my believing what you desire, or my dreading\nwhat the thermometer indicated.” And, even with purely cognitive\nattitude verbs, similar puzzles arise: the mild peculiarity of “I\ndoubt/assert what you contemplate/entertain,” for example, will\nrequire explanation. (For more on these matters, see Vendler 1967 and\nHarman 2003.) \n\nLet us suppose, for the sake of argument, the linguistic problems\ndiscussed above undermine the Relational Analysis. Can a\npropositionalist dissociate herself from that analysis, and its\nlinguistic difficulties, while still endorsing the arguments we\ndiscussed for propositions in section 5.1?  \n\nSome modifications of the Relational Analysis do not avoid the\nlinguistic problems. For instance, it is not enough to claim that\nattitude verbs designate three-place relations between\nsubjects, propositions, and modes of presentation. \n\nOne possibility is to deny that attitude verbs designate relations\nwhen complemented by that-clauses, and to claim that they\nrather make a syncategorematic semantic contribution. Under one\napproach, that-clauses in attitude ascriptions designate\npropositions which serve to “measure” attitudes conceived\nof as mental particulars (Matthews 1994). It is not clear that this\nview will be immune to substitution and objectivization problems. See\nMoltmann (2003) for further discussion. \n\nAnother possibility is to abandon the Relational Analysis\naltogether, in favor of a version of Bertrand Russell’s “multiple\nrelation” theory. Following Russell (1911; 1913; 1918), Newman\n(2002) and Moltmann (2003; 2004), have recently argued that\nthat-clauses in attitude ascriptions do not designate\npropositions but rather provide a number of entities as terms of a\n“multiple” attitude relation. These philosophers\nnonetheless do accept propositions, and use them to explain sentences\nin which ‘proposition’ explicitly occurs, e.g.,\n(‘Some proposition that John believes is true’, ‘John\nbelieves the proposition that snow is white’). The basic idea is\nthat there are propositions, but they have the status of “derived\nobjects” — derived from our attitudes, which themselves are\nnot relations to propositions. It is an interesting question whether a\nRussellian is positioned to endorse the arguments for propositions\ngiven in section 4. (For more on the Russellian theory, see the\nsupplementary document: \n\nWe have suggested that the most promising arguments for propositions\nare the metalinguistic arguments and the Metaphysics 101 argument. The\nformer arguments are plainly theoretical: they appeal to the\nexplanatory power of semantical theories invoking propositions. To\nresist them, there is no need to explain away their intuitive appeal,\nbecause they do not and are not intended to have intuitive\nappeal. This is not true of the Metaphysics 101 argument.  It is\nthoroughly intuitive, and so resisting the argument requires giving a\nstory about how and why intuition goes wrong.  In this section, we\nwill consider one general strategy for doing this. \n\nThe Metaphysics 101 argument can seem Janus-faced: its premises seem utterly\nshallow, and yet its conclusion seems to resolve a\ndeep ontological debate. One is apt to think, “Sure, what\nI believe is different from my believing it. And so we can distinguish\nthe content of a belief from the attitude of belief. These contents are\npropositions. Fine, but now it seems there must be a domain of entities\nhere, whose nature remains to be investigated. How could that\nbe?” One might suspect some sort of equivocation or ambiguity is\nat work, some oscillation between a shallow and a deep interpretation. \n\nRudolf Carnap’s (1956) distinction between internal and external\nquestions may prove relevant here. For Carnap, an internal question is\na question that is asked within a particular linguistic framework.\nInternal questions are answered by invoking the rules of the framework\ntogether with logic and the empirical facts. Not all such questions are\ntrivial, but questions about the existence of the sorts of entities\ndefinitive of the framework are. Carnap in fact thought that the\ntraditional metaphysician aimed to ask a framework independent\nquestion, an external question, failing to realize that external\nquestions are best seen as non-cognitive practical questions about which\nframework to adopt and at worst meaningless. (See the link to Weisberg\n2000, in the Other Internet Resources section).  \n\nRelying on Carnap’s distinction, within certain linguistic\nframeworks, such as that presupposed by the Metaphysics 101 argument,\nit is almost trivial that there are propositions. All it takes is\nsomething as superficial as the Metaphysics 101 argument, or the\nfollowing even less enlightening argument, “The proposition that\nsnow is white is true; therefore, some proposition is true; therefore,\nthere are propositions.” The traditional metaphysician, however,\naims to ask a non-trivial question about the reality of the\npropositions outside such frameworks. Such questions have no cognitive\ncontent. \n\nOne of the chief difficulties for Carnap is to explain the truth of\ninternal statements. If ‘there are propositions’ is true,\neven within a framework, what does its truth consist in? If truth in a\nframework is explained in terms of truth given the axioms of the\nframework, we will want to know about the truth-value of the\naxioms themselves. If they are true, what makes them true? If they are\nnot true, why can’t we conclude that there really are no\npropositions? \n\nEven if we must reject Carnap’s internal/external distinction,\nperhaps some form of “Neo-Carnapian” ambiguity hypothesis\ncan help explain away the appeal of the Metaphysics 101 argument. \n\nA number of questions arise for the Neo-Carnapian. First, how are\nthe internal and external readings to be distinguished? Second, how\npervasive is the ambiguity? are there different readings not only for\nquantified sentences but for attitude- and truth-ascriptions as well?\nThird, what is the status of the Metaphysics 101 argument, given the\ntwo readings? The argument must be unsound when understood externally,\nbut must it be invalid, or is it a valid argument with a false premise?\nIf so, which is false? Fourth, how could philosophers regularly miss\nthe internal/external ambiguity? \n\nWe will briefly describe two Neo-Carnapian accounts. \n\nOne possibility is to explain the internal/external distinction by\nreference to fictions.  Internal statements are statements made within\nor relative to a fiction, and they are to be assessed as true or false\nrelative to the fiction.   \n However, any fictionalist interpretation of the internal/external\ndistinction would have to explain why the fiction of propositions,\nlike the fictions of properties and numbers, is not a mere game, but\ncan be used for describing reality.  We will briefly discuss a kind of\nfictionalism designed to do just this: figuralism. (For\ndiscussion, see Yablo (2000, 2001), Yablo and Rayo (2001), Yablo and\nGallois (1998), and for a similar view, Balaguer 1998a and\n1998b).  \n Relying on pioneering work by Kendall Walton (1990), Yablo argues that\npretense can serve serious practical and theoretical purposes. To use\nWalton’s example, by pretending that Italy is a boot, I can\neasily convey to you the location of the Italian town of Crotone. Here\nI am, in effect, using a pretense to convey information about the real\nworld. Literally, Italy is not a boot, but my interest is not in\nspeaking the literal truth, but in conveying a rather complicated fact\nto you as effectively as I can. Similarly, Yablo and Gallois claim,\none may pretend there are certain entities in order to better convey\ncertain facts (1998, 245–8). One might pretend there are directions in\norder to facilitate communication of facts about which lines stand in\nwhich geometric relations to which other ones. Perhaps one could do\nthe same with propositions? \n\nHowever, Yablo (2001) emphasizes that the figuralist need not be\ncommitted to any psychological thesis about\nmaking-believe. We may not consciously pretend that there are\npropositions when we say that what we believe is true, just as we may\nnot consciously pretend that there are such things as stomach\nbutterflies when we say we have butterflies in our stomach. Figuralism\nrequires only that there is a semantical distinction between literal\ncontent and figurative content, and that by asserting sentences with\ncertain false or at least highly doubtful literal contents, we may\nalso express genuine facts, which would be well nigh impossible to\nexpress literally. (See Balaguer 1998a and 1998b on the concept of\nrepresentational aids) \n\nFiguralism makes it possible to diagnose the failure of the\nMetaphysics 101 argument as follows. If its steps are interpreted\nliterally, the argument is unsound but valid. If its steps are\ninterpreted figuratively, it is sound. Why are we fooled, then? One\npromising suggestion is that it can be very difficult to distinguish\nfigurative from literal content, particularly when the figures\nemployed have little presentational force.  \n\nIf we accept this diagnosis, we are committed to thinking that every\nbelief-ascription is literally false. This is a bitter pill to\nswallow, though it may seem less bitter the less importance is placed\non literalness in communication (See Yablo 2001, p. 85). \n\nSome philosophers have suggested that ordinary English quantifiers are\nsusceptible to multiple readings, or different readings in different\ncontexts of use.  Thus, Hilary Putnam (1987, 2004) has argued that\nthere is no single meaning associated with the vocabulary of\nquantification, and that, depending on context, an assertion of\n‘there are Fs’ might be true or false.  For\nexample, the Polish mereologist, in certain contexts, might be able to\nspeak truly in asserting ‘any objects compose a further\nobject’, whereas an assertion of the negation of this sentence\nmight true in different contexts. (Note that Putnam is clear that the\nphenomenon he is describing isn’t mere quantifier-restriction.)\n The acknowledgement of different meanings for the quantifiers is\nnot enough by itself to explain away the intuitiveness of the\nMetaphysics 101 argument.  As we mentioned earlier, what is needed is\nan account of the apparent oscillation between a shallow and a deep\ninterpretation. There could, in principle, be a plurality of\ninterpretations of the quantifiers even if none of the readings\ndiffered with respect to metaphysical depth. \n Recently, Thomas Hofweber (2005, 2016) has claimed to have found the\nrequired pair of readings.  A quantifier, he claims, may have either a\ndomain-conditions or inferential role reading. The\ndomain-conditions reading is just the familiar reading we know from\nfirst order semantics: ‘there are Fs’ is true iff\nthere exists an entity in the relevant real domain which satisfies\n‘F’.  This reading is therefore ontologically\ncommitting and so deep (and thus external).  The inferential\nreading, by contrast, brings with it no ontological commitment, and so\nis shallow (and thus internal). \n Hofweber explains that the inferential role reading serves an\nimportant function.  It enables us the easy expression of partial\ninformation. For example, I might not recall a name or unique\ndescription of Fred’s favorite detective, but if I want express\nthe partial information I have, I can do this by saying “Fred\nadmires some detective.”.  Now, on the domain-conditions\nreading, what I express is false, and so I have misinformed my\naudience.  What we need, to achieve the desired end, is a reading for\n‘there is an F’ which validates existential\ngeneralization, regardless of whether the names occurring in the\npremise refer to an entity.  This is what the inferential role reading\nprovides.  Thus, we say “Fred admires some detective —\nyes, it’s Sherlock Holmes!” \n Hofweber points out that these two readings are not like the two\nreadings for ‘bank’. They validate many of the same\ninferences (e.g., ‘there is an F&G,\ntherefore, there is an F and there is a G’)\nand, within discourses lacking empty singular terms, they validate all\nof the same inferences.  \n Now for the relevance to the Metaphysics 101 argument.  On either\nreading of the relevant quantifiers in the Metaphysics 101 argument\n(those in steps 1, 2, and 4), the argument is valid.  But on the\ndomain-conditions reading, premise 1 (at least) is, if not false, then\nat least dubious — a piece of controversial ontology.  On the\ninferential-role reading, all the problems go away, and the argument\nappears completely shallow.  The Janus-faced character of the argument\ncomes from oscillating between the two readings.  Moreover, given the\nclose relations between the two readings, it is understandable that\nthe metaphysician fails to realize her mistake in thinking that the\nargument establishes the existence of propositions.  \n\nFor an account like Hofweber’s to succeed, it must be possible for\nattitude- and truth-ascriptions to be true even if\nthat-clauses do not designate. For if they designate, then\nthe domain-conditions reading of ‘there is something S\nbelieves’ would be true.  \n\nReflection on the proposition role leads many propositionalists to\nrather dramatic answers to questions about the nature and status of\npropositions. Below is one standard line of argument, versions of which\ncan be found in Bealer (1998) and Schiffer (2003). (See also Cartwright\n(1962) and Soames (1999).)  \n\nThe proposition that there are rocks, which we denote <there are\nrocks>, does not entail the existence of any beings that have or are\ncapable of having mental states. It entails this neither in a strictly\nor broadly logical sense. That is, it is possible in the\nbroadest sense for <there are rocks> to be true in the absence of\nall mental states. But now, if this proposition is possibly true in the\nabsence of mental states, then it possibly exists in the absence of all\nmental states, and so is mind-independent. This is an easy argument for\nthe mind-independence of at least some propositions. \n\nA parallel “easy argument” can be given for the\nabstractness of at least some propositions. <2+2=4> does not\nentail the existence of concrete entities. So it is possible for it to\nbe true (and so to exist) in the absence of concrete entities. Thus, it\nis possibly abstract. Assuming, contra Linksy and Zalta (1996), that\nabstractness is, necessarily, an essential feature of abstract\nentities, then it follows that <2+2=4> is in fact abstract. One\nmight want to extend such arguments to contingent propositions.\nConsider <there are trees>. This proposition is false in a world\nwithout concrete entities. But if it is false in such a world, it must\nexist in that world, and so is possibly, and so actually abstract. \n\nSimilar arguments can be constructed for properties. If properties\nare what we assert of objects and what is true/false\nof objects, then there are simple arguments for the conclusion\nthat at many properties are mind-independent and abstract. \n\nIt is dangerous to generalize these sorts of “Easy\nArguments” to all propositions (particularly singular\npropositions). But even if they cannot be fully generalized, they\nthreaten to show that propositions would be mind-independent abstract\nentities. Now, given that propositions de jure are sharable\nobjects of attitudes, it is antecedently unlikely that they should turn\nout to be, say, token utterances. But one might have thought that\npropositions could be identified with natural language sentence types\n(as in Quine 1960), or with sentence types in the language of thought.\nBut if the Easy Arguments succeed, it seems that to accept\npropositions, we must accept Platonism. Conceptualism about\npropositions seems ruled out. \n\nMany philosophers deny that there are propositions precisely because\nthey accept the validity of these Easy Arguments (and the truth of\ncertain attitude ascriptions). There are familiar problems besetting\nthe believer in abstract entities. The two “Benacerraf\nproblems,” in particular have received much attention in the\nliterature: the epistemological problem and identification\nproblem. The epistemological problem for abstract propositions,\nroughly, is this: how can we know about abstract propositions, given\nthat we cannot causally interact with them? The identification problem\nrequires a bit more explanation. If propositions are abstract, then\nthere will be many distinct candidates for propositions which seem to\nplay the proposition role equally well. If certain entities, the\nFs, are candidates for being propositions, why won’t the\nentities consisting of an F paired with the number 1 count as\nadequate candidates as well, so long as we reconstrue predicates for\npropositions in such a way as to make the number 1 irrelevant? But\npropositions cannot be both Fs and these new entities,\nbecause these new entities are not Fs. Is it simply\nindeterminate what propositions are? See the entry on\n platonism: in metaphysics.\n (See also J. Moore 1999) \n\nThe Easy Arguments can appear suspicious. How can the seemingly\nobvious acknowledgement that there are propositions — i.e., that\nbeliefs have sharable objects which bear truth-values — commit us\nto there being mind-independent abstract entities? We will discuss two\nsorts of reply found in the literature. Both are objections to the\ninference from there being propositions to the claim that\npropositions have the surprising features. We are putting aside\nobjections to the claim that there are propositions. \n\nThe Easy Arguments rely on an assumption about entailment and truth, namely: This assumption is needed to reason from premises about\npropositions failing to entail other propositions about there being\nmental states or being concrete entities to the possible truth of\nthose propositions in the absence of mental states and concrete\nentities.  \nBut how could (A) fail?  If a proposition fails to entail\nthat q, doesn’t it follow that there is a possible world in\nwhich the former is true and not-q?   \n\nSome philosophers (Pollock 1985, King 2007) have argued that\nprinciples like (A) have two readings, one clearly acceptable but\nuseless to the Easy Arguments and the other useful to those arguments\nbut false.  The two readings correspond to two ways of understanding\ntalk of truth with respect to possible worlds.  One way for something\nto be true with respect to a world requires the truth-bearer to exist\nin the world and be true there.  Another way is for the truth-bearer\nto “correctly describe” the world, where this does not\nrequire existing in the world.  Pollock gives the example of a picture\ndepicting the non-existence of all pictures.  The picture could\ncorrectly depict a situation even though the situation it depicts is\none in which the picture itself does not exist.  Similarly, the\nMedieval philosopher Jean Buridan discusses the example of an\nutterance of ‘there are no negative utterances’.  This\nutterance correctly describes a certain possible situation even though\nthat situation is one in which the utterance would not exist.\nFollowing Adams (1981), we may call the former way of being true with\nrespect to a world truth in a world and the latter truth\nat a world.  The conceptualist may claim that propositions can be\ntrue at worlds without being true in them, by analogy with the\nexamples from Pollock and Buridan.  A proposition like <there are\nno propositions> is true at certain possible worlds but true in\nnone.  Since we do not want to say that such propositions are\nnecessary, we must understand necessity as truth at every\npossible world.  Correspondingly, to preserve the connections between\nentailment and necessity, we must understand entailment in terms of\nthe entailed proposition being true at every world at which the\nentailing proposition is true.  Given all this, we can distinguish two\nreadings for Assumption A:  (Reading 1) If a proposition <p> fails to entail a\nproposition <q>, then there is a possible\nworld W such that <p> is\ntrue in W and not-q at W.  (Reading 2) If a proposition <p> fails to entail a\nproposition <q>, then there is a possible\nworld W such that <p> is\ntrue at W and not-q at W. Given the understanding of entailment in terms of truth at a world,\nthe conceptualist will claim that Reading 1 is false, while Reading 2\nis true but useless to the Easy Arguments.  Thus, the conclusions of\nthose arguments are blocked. \n\nThe plausibility of this response depends on having a good account of\nwhat truth at a world amounts to.  But this, in turn, depends on\nissues in the metaphysics of modality.   If worlds are concrete particulars (“I and all my\nsurroundings”), as they are for David Lewis (1986), then we\ncould say that a proposition is true at a world if the\nproposition is about the entities that are parts of that world and is\ntrue, and true in a world if true at a world and also part of\nthat world.  There may well be difficulties of explaining how a\nproposition could be part of more than one concrete world (and why it\nwould only be part of some concrete worlds but not all), but this\nframework seems to make conceptual room for the possibility\npropositions being true at worlds without being true in them.   \nSuppose, however, that worlds were conceived as world stories, i.e.,\nas maximal consistent sets of propositions (see Section 2). How, then,\nmight truth at a world be understood?  One approach, favored by Adams\n(1981), is to explain truth at a world in terms of truth in a world,\nunderstanding the latter to amount to truth were the world actual\n(were all its members true).  On this approach, we would understand\nwhat is true at a world in terms of what is true in it, together with\ncertain facts about the actual world.  However, the conceptualist\ncannot abide this approach.  For, on this approach, the members of any\nworld are true in that world.  But since the members of any and every\nworld are propositions, it would follow that, contrary to\nconceptualism, that it is necessary that there are propositions.  A\nmore conceptualist-friendly approach is to reverse the order of\nexplanation, to explain truth in a world in terms of truth at a world\n+ existence in that world.  How could truth at a world be understood?\nA natural proposal is to understand it as membership in a world\nstory.   Difficulties emerge with this proposal when we face the question\nof how to understand consistency of world stories. There are maximal\nsets of propositions that are not possible worlds because they are\nnot consistent in the relevant sense.  But the relevant sense\nis not easily defined. Following Adams (1981), we might wish to use\nthe concept of possibility to gloss the notion of consistency: a set\nof propositions is consistent if and only if those propositions could\nall be true together.  This returns us to the problem noted in the\nprevious paragraph: it again would turn out that necessarily there are\npropositions (even in mindless worlds).  \n\nThe conceptualist might hope to take the relevant notion of\nconsistency as primitive and reject the gloss in terms of joint\npossible truth.  Still, we should ask about the broader implications\nof denying the joint possible truth of consistent world stories.\nConsider, for instance the notion of actuality.  Only one of the many\npossible worlds is actual, although each is actual relative to itself.\nThe actual one, on the world story view, is the one all of whose\nmembers are true.  But if this is what actuality for worlds amounts\nto, then assuming possible worlds are possibly actual, it would follow\nthat for each possible world all its members could be true together.\nOught we to deny that possible worlds are possibly actual?   \nThe conceptualist might hope to avoid these problems, without falling\nback on Lewis’s concrete realism about possible worlds, by\nunderstanding worlds in terms of properties or states of affairs,\nrather than propositions.  Following Stalnaker (1976), one might think\nof worlds as properties which are ways things could have been.\nFollowing Plantinga (1974) and others, one might think of worlds as\nmaximal consistent states of affairs, where these are thought of as\ndistinct from propositions.  \nHowever, this retrenchment may end up only shifting the Platonist\nworries elsewhere.  To distinguish the ways that are possible\nworlds (or possible world-states) from those which are not, it is\ndifficult to avoid appealing to a gloss in terms of being possibly\ninstantiated: the possible worlds are not only maximal but they could\nbe instantiated. Taking this line would require conceding that in\nevery world there are properties.  Something similar holds for the\nconception of possible worlds as maximal consistent states of\naffairs.  \nOne might think, however, that Platonism about properties is less\nproblematic than Platonism about propositions.  The former do not\nrepresent the world, whereas the latter, as truth-bearers, do (Jubien\n2001, King 2007).  However, properties can apply or fail to apply to\nobjects, and can be said to be true or false of objects, and so it is\nnot clear that worries about representation clearly gain more traction\nfor propositions than for properties.  Similar considerations apply to\nstates of affairs. \nDespite these worries, the conceptualist might be encouraged by the\nexample of singular propositions.  Hasn’t the truth in vs. truth at\ndistinction been useful in dealing with the modality of singular\npropositions?  For example, consider any singular proposition about\nSocrates, e.g., the proposition that Socrates was a philosopher. Such\npropositions, plausibly, depend for their existence on the object they\nare directly about.  One might therefore think that no singular\nproposition about Socrates could exist unless Socrates existed.\nConsider, then, the proposition that Socrates does not exist.  It is\nclearly contingent that Socrates exists; things could have been\notherwise.  But then the proposition that Socrates does not exist\nwould appear to be possible without being possibly true.  Unlike the\nexamples from Pollock and Buridan, however, we cannot understand such\npossibility without possible truth in terms of expressing a possibly\ntrue proposition while not being possibly true itself.  Propositions\ndo not express propositions, of course, and so we cannot understand\ntheir possibility without possible truth in this way (Plantinga 1981).\nWhat is it, then, for such a singular proposition to be possible but\nnot possibly true?  Answering this question was one of the key\nmotivations in the development of the distinction between truth in and\ntruth at a world.  But while Adams and others attempted to do this by\nthinking of truth at a world as determined by what is true in that\nworld together with a certain set of facts about the actual world, the\nconceptualist hopes to kick aside the ladder of truth in a world\naltogether.  Whether this hope is reasonable or not is an important\nissue in contemporary work on propositions. (Key recent discussions\ninclude King 2007, Soames 2010, and Merricks 2015). \n\nAnother response to the Easy Arguments is, so to speak, to deflate\ntheir significance by deflating propositions. The Easy Arguments\nsucceed, but their success marks no great philosophical discovery and\nraises no hard questions of the sort that have traditionally bothered\nmetaphysicians of a nominalist bent.  \n\nWe will here discuss only Stephen Schiffer’s (2003) theory of\n“pleonastic\n propositions.”[8] \n\nPropositions exist, for Schiffer, but unlike rocks or cats, there is\nnothing more to them than what our concept of a proposition guarantees.\nOne may call them “abstract entities,” if one likes, but\nthis label should not encourage the thought that our minds can reach\nbeyond the physical world to make contact with denizens of a Platonic\nuniverse. We know about propositions, not by interacting with them, as\nwe do with rocks and cats, but by being participants in certain sorts\nof linguistic or conceptual practice. It’s because we speak or think in\ncertain ways that we are able to know about propositions. \n\nSchiffer argues, in effect, that given our proposition-talk and\nthought, propositions are, in D. M. Armstrong’s phrase, a kind of\n“ontological free lunch.” That is, the key\n“axioms” of our proposition-talk and thought are\nguaranteed to be true. These include the instances of the equivalence\nschema (E) for propositions: The proposition that p is\ntrue iff p. Given the truth of such axioms, it follows\nthat propositions exist and have the features attributed to them by\nour axioms. Moreover, because these axioms are constitutive of the\nconcept of a proposition, it follows that, by possessing that concept,\nwe can know the truth of these axioms. \n\nOne might concede to Schiffer that the axioms are constitutive of\nour concept of a proposition. But why think those axioms are true?\nSchiffer stresses that we do not make the axioms true by saying,\nthinking, or “stipulating” that they are true. The\nmind-independence of propositions, after all, is implicit in those\naxioms. \n\nSchiffer’s argument for pleonastic propositions is of a piece with\nhis argument for pleonastic entities generally, including fictional\nentities, events, and properties. A pleonastic entity, for him, is an\nentity that falls under a pleonastic concept. The latter is the key\nnotion and is defined as follows. \n A SFN (something-from-nothing) transformation (about Fs) is\na statement that allows us to deduce a statement about a kind of\nentity F, from a statement that involves no reference to\nFs. (61) SFN transformations assert a kind of\nsupervenience condition on Fs: if the relevant\nnon-F conditions obtain, Fs exist and have the\nrelevant features. (E.g., if snow is white, then the proposition that\nsnow is white exists and is true.)  \n If the concept F is pleonastic, then there are\nFs. We need to know how to tell if a concept is\npleonastic. Here is Schiffer’s test: Schiffer’s final formulation of the conservativeness test is:  \n\nOne might think the conservativeness test is overly complicated, and\nthat all that matters is that the new entities not interfere with the\nempirical world. If so, then the test would mention only empirical\ntheories not all theories. But, as Matti Eklund (2007) points\nout, two kinds of entity that are individually non-interfering with\nrespect to the empirical world might interfere with one another.\nSchiffer is aware of this problem (see his discussion of anti-fictional\nentities, pp. 55–6), and this is why he turns to the more complicated\naccount. \n\nSchiffer’s picture is this. If a concept satisfies the\nconservativeness test, then its instantiation would be unproblematic\nbecause it would interfere with nothing else. Its instantiation comes\nfor free. If a concept doesn’t meet this test, it doesn’t\ncome for free. \n\nAlthough Schiffer’s view of propositions can be described as\ndeflationary in one sense (because it attempts to deflate questions\nabout the existence and nature of propositions), the meta-ontology\nunderlying Schiffer’s approach is, if anything, inflationary: all\n“non-interfering” kinds of entity are instantiated. \n\nSchiffer’s, and other deflationist theories, must, at a minimum,\nanswer the following two questions, in addition to the questions facing\nall propositionalists: \n\nEven if Fs would be non-interfering in Schiffer’s sense, the\npostulation of Fs logically conflicts with some consistent\ntheories, e.g., ‘There are no Fs’. Schiffer\nplaces severer constraints on the denial of entities than on the\nacceptance of them.  Suppose Fs would be\nnon-interfering. Then adding them would not add information about\nnon-Fs. But suppose also that denying Fs would not\nadd information about non-Fs. Why isn’t this a reason to deny\nFs?  So, in this sense, the theory denying Fs passes\na corresponding conservativeness test. \n\nIf the proposition that snow is white is a simple, necessary and\neternal object, why does its having a property (truth) have anything\nto do with concrete snow’s having a property (whiteness)? Do instances\nof the T-schema simply state brute necessary connections between\nabstract objects and concrete ones?  Or do these necessary connections\nsomehow derive from our practices, and if so, how? \nAnother reaction one might have to the Easy Arguments is to accept\ntheir conclusions but to give an account of the nature of propositions\nwhich will make these conclusions palatable.  One promising line\nof thinking, in this regard, is to think of propositions as types, the\ntokens of which are mental or linguistic acts or events, and in\nparticular the acts that would be thought to express\nthe proposition.  Such views have been developed in recent years\nby Dummett (1996), Hanks (2011, 2015), and Soames (2010, 2014a,\n2015).  We focus here on the recent proposals put forth by Hanks\nand Soames. \nThe type view is motivated by its answers to otherwise puzzling\nfeatures of traditional Platonist views of propositions (e.g. Frege\n(1984)).  On this view, belief and other attitudes are understood\nas relations to already-existing propositions which represent things\nas being a certain way.  The truth or falsity of an individual’s\nbelief or other\ncognitive state is explained by the truth or falsity of the proposition\nwhich is the object of that state.  If truth consists in a\nrepresentation’s being accurate, then a proposition is true just in\ncase it accurately represents things as being a certain way. \nThus, on the traditional view, thinking subjects represent things as\nbeing a\ncertain way (either in thought or language) by standing in appropriate\nrelations to propositions which fundamentally represent things as being\na certain way. \nTwo problems arise for the Platonist’s position.  First,\nhow do cognizers come to be acquainted with such propositions? \nSecond, what explains how propositions represent things as being a\ncertain way?  Platonists appear to have no answer to the epistemic\nquestion, and presumably accept representation as a primitive feature\nof\npropositions.  Type theorists, however, explain the relation\nbetween a cognizer and a proposition simply as an instance of the\ngeneral relation between type and token.  Consider, as Dummett\n(1996, p. 259) does, one’s humming of a tune.  The tune is a\nspecies or type of musical performance capable of having multiple\nperformances at differing times or locations, while the humming of it\nis a\ntoken act belonging to that type.  One might then see the relation\nof a proposition to a mental or linguistic act as one between the type\nof act performed and the performance of the act. \nWhat type of acts should one identify with propositions?  For both\nHanks and Soames, propositions are types of predicative acts.  The notion of predication here is simply, for atomic propositions, one of an agent’s representing an object o as having property F.  (Hanks (2015, p. 64) characterizes predication as categorization,\nor the sorting of things into groups according to a rule.  We will take this to be a\nform of representation.)  Since representation is primarily\nsomething done by cognitive agents, according to Hanks and Soames, one might wonder whether the proposition itself\nis representational, and so possesses truth-conditions, on the type\nview.  Both theorists respond to this concern by claiming that\npropositions are representational in a secondary, derivative\nsense.  There\nare many examples of types that inherit features of their tokens (a\nsonata (type) can be discordant in virtue of performances of it being\ndiscordant; a movie can be frightening in virtue of its tokens being\nso, etc.  See the entry on types and tokens.)  Just as an act can be described as intelligent in order to communicate that the agent  acted intelligently in performing the act, type theorists will claim that a proposition represents o as F in a similarly derivative sense wherein any agent who performs the act of predicating F of o will thereby represent o as F. \nOne question that arises for such a view is whether propositions are\ngenuinely representational entities with truth-conditions, or whether\nthe claim that a proposition represents things as being a certain way\nis simply a convenient manner of speaking indirectly about the actual\nand possible representational acts of thinkers. \nAs we have seen, the type view reverses the traditional order of\nexplanation concerning the nature of predication, representation, and\ntruth-conditions.  On the traditional, Fregean picture,\npropositions exist as objective, mind-independent entities “waiting” to\nbe entertained, judged or asserted, so to speak.  On this view,\nfor a subject S to predicate F of o is for S to entertain the proposition that o is F; for S to represent o as F in thought or language is to have have a thought or utterance with the primarily representational proposition that o is\nF as its content, etc.  On the type view, a proposition’s\nrepresentational and predicative properties are derived from the\nfundamentally representational and predicative acts of agents. \nA concern for the type view is whether there will be “missing\npropositions” — truths or falsehoods which have never been\nentertained.  One drawn to the type view may allow for the\nexistence of uninstantiated types to account for the existence of these\npropositions.  However, given that propositions are claimed to\nderive their representational features from their tokens, such\nuninstantiated types would lack representational features, and so lack\ntruth-conditions.  Hanks suggests dealing with such propositions\ncounterfactually.  Even if no one had ever predicated eloquence of\nClinton, the proposition that Clinton is eloquent is true iff Clinton\nis eloquent because if someone were\nto predicate eloquence of Clinton, the token would be true iff Clinton\nis eloquent.  Predicative types, then, inherit their\nrepresentation features from both their actual and possible\ntokens.  This response, however, leaves us with the question of\ntruths for which there are not even any merely possible tokens — for\nexample, mathematical truths that are too complicated for any finite\nmind to grasp.  What, if anything, provides the truth-conditions\nof these propositions? \nHanks (2015, p. 27) allows that propositions are mind-independent and\nobjective entities which do not depend for their existence on having\nany tokens, just as one might think about a difficult type of dive that\nhas never been performed.  Thus, while Hanks’ view appears to be a\nrejection of a traditional Platonism about propositions, it seems\nnevertheless to accept a Platonism about types by untethering their\nexistence from their tokens.  (Compare to Dodd’s (2007) defense of\nPlatonism about types.)  Soames (2014a,b) also allows for\nuntokened types, but only those whose constituents have been referred\nto or predicated in other propositions.  For Soames, a proposition\np may exist in w even if no token of p has been performed in w.  For Soames, if in w a predicative event has occurred in which an agent predicates n-place property R of n objects, and in w events of referring to or thinking of objects o1...on have occurred, then the proposition that is the type of act of predicating R of o1...on\nexists (even if R has never been predicated of o1...on in w).  Still, it would seem that there can be truths in a world about objects that have never been thought\nof or referred to in that world.  In response to this, Soames claims that a\nproposition need not exist in a world w in order to be true in w. \nIn support of this, Soames appeals to other, albeit controversial,\ncases in which an object can have a property despite not\nexisting.  For instance, Socrates can have the properties of being referred to or being admired\ndespite no longer existing.  Thus, Soames’ accommodation of our\nintuitions concerning propositions that have never been thought appears\nto involve a rejection of Actualism. \nThe type view has been argued to provide solutions to several\ntraditional problems for propositional thought, including Frege’s\npuzzle, first-person belief, Kripke’s puzzle about belief, and the\nproblem of empty names.  In responding to these problems, Soames\ninvokes “Millian modes of presentation,” or ways of cognizing an object\nin thought which do not affect the representational content of the\nact,  to preserve a non-Fregean, Millian view of semantic content\nfor names and natural kind terms while individuating propositions\nfinely enough to solve traditional problems in the philosophy of\nlanguage.  Hanks, by contrast, invokes distinct types of\nreferential and expressive acts as the constituents of\npropositions.  On this view, each use of a name falls under\nseveral different reference types which differ in their fineness of\ngrain, each associated with a different proposition.  As we have seen, the type view is motivated in large part by the\nperceived need to explain how propositions represent things as being a\ncertain way on the grounds that a view which accepts primitively\nrepresentational propositions is objectionably mysterious.  Some\nquestion, however, whether the representational properties of\npropositions can (or need to) be explained at all (McGlone 2012,\nCaplan, et al. 2013, Merricks 2015). Merricks, for example,\nargues that we should accept that there are fundamentally\nrepresentational entities, but that we have no reason to favor mental\nstates (such as beliefs) over propositions as being the fundamental\nbearers of representational properties.  For if, e.g., beliefs\nare fundamentally representational, then it is either a primitive fact\nabout them that they represent what they do, or it is a feature\ncapable of explanation.  If it is a primitive fact about them,\nthen the view appears just as mysterious as one which accepts that\npropositions are primitively representational.  If it is a fact\ncapable of explanation, as the type theorists contend, then it is\npresumably explained in terms of an agent’s ability to predicate\nproperties of objects.  But unless there is some explanation of\nhow an agent can engage in predication, predication must itself be a\nprimitive representational ability, and the theory has not made any\ngenuine progress on what was to be explained. \nA final question worth considering at this stage is whether\npropositions are representational entities at all.  Richard (2013)\nand Speaks (2014), for instance, each develop views of propositions\nwhich deny that they are.  Consider the view defended by\nRichard.  Sentences, beliefs, and the like represent things as\nbeing a certain way — snow as being white, for example.  Put\nanother way, the sentence ‘Snow is white’ represents snow’s being\nwhite, where this is simply a way for things to be — a state of affairs\nor property that is either instantiated or not (but does not represent\nthings as being any way, just as properties are not in general\nrepresentational).  On this approach, the proposition expressed by\nthe sentence is identified with the way that things are represented as\nbeing, not as something which has representational properties either\nprimitively or in need of explanation by more fundamental acts of\npredication.  If an approach along these lines is correct, the\ntype view appears to lose one of its central motivations.  Some philosophers, notably W.V.O. Quine, recognize the existence\nof certain sorts of abstract entities but not others at least partly\non the basis of concerns about identity conditions.  Quine granted the\nexistence of sets, in part because they obey the extensionality axiom:\nsets are identical iff they have the same members.  When it came to\nproperties, relations and propositions, however, he found no such\nclear criterion of identity.  The property of being a creature with a\nheart, he noted, is distinct from the property of being a creature\nwith a kidney, even if all the same things exemplify the two\nproperties.  \nIt is a controversial matter whether Quine was right to demand such\nrigorous criteria of identity as a condition for acceptance of a class\nof entities.  However, even if Quine asks too much, any good theory of\npropositions ought to have something to say about when propositions\nare identical and when they are distinct.  Developing theories which\ngive such accounts in a way that fits well with intuitive data\nconcerning propositional attitude ascriptions would enhance our\nreasons to accept propositions.  \n\nThe question of identity conditions for propositions is importantly\nrelated to the question of whether propositions are structured\nentities. Propositions are structured if they have\nconstituents, in some broad sense, and the order of the\nconstituents matters. Order matters only if there could be two\nstructured propositions sharing all the same constituents, but which\nare distinct due to differences in the way under which those\nconstituents are “united” in the proposition. E.g., if the\nproposition that a loves b is the ordered triple\n<loving, a, b>, it is distinct from\nthe proposition that b loves a, which would be the\nordered triple <loving, b, a>. \n\nIf propositions are structured entities, then sameness of constituents\nand sameness of order will entail identity. There are, of course,\ndangers, in regarding propositions as structured. Prima facie, one\nwould rather not claim that the proposition that x is\ntriangular is identical to the proposition that x is\ntrilateral, since a subject might believe one but not the other. It\nwill be important, then, not to individuate propositions too coarsely.\nHowever, one might worry, in the opposing direction, about overly fine\nindividuations of propositions.  Is the proposition that John loves\nMary different from the proposition that Mary is loved by John?  For\nmore on structured propositions, see the entry on\n structured propositions.[9] \nAny theory that construes propositions as structured entities would\nseem to face the problem of the unity of the proposition.  It\nis not entirely straightforward to say what this problem or set of\nproblems is.  But at the very least, there are at least two problems\nhere.  There is the problem of explaining why one sort of structured\nwhole, a proposition, can be true or false, while the set of its\nconstituents is not.  A list isn’t true or false, and a proposition\nwith the same constituents is; why is this?  Second, there is a\ngeneral problem of explaining how two distinct things could have all\nthe same constituents.  For a thorough discussion of the history of\nphilosophical work on the unity of the sentence and the proposition,\nthe reader should consult Gaskin (2008). Some hold that propositions lack constituents altogether, and so are\nunstructured.  If propositions are unstructured, then if they are\nsets, they inherit\nthe identity conditions for sets: sameness of members. Thus, if a\nproposition is the set of worlds in which it is true (as in Stalnaker\n1976), then P=Q iff P and Q have\nthe same worlds as members iff P and Q are true in\nthe same worlds. As is well-known, this theory leads to a very coarse\nindividuation of propositions, too coarse, arguably, to handle\npropositional attitudes. (See Soames (1987) for a discussion of this\ntheory as well as the theory of propositions as sets of concrete\nsituations or facts. \n\nIf propositions are unstructured and distinct from sets, there are\nseveral possibilities for explaining their identity conditions. First,\nidentity conditions might be specified in terms of possible\nattitudes. One possibility is this: P=Q if,\nnecessarily whoever believes (asserts, denies, etc.) P\nbelieves (asserts, denies, etc.) Q, and vice versa.  Second,\nproposition identity might be reduced to property identity in the\nmanner of Myhill (1963) and Zalta (1983).  Thus, Zalta (1983, 72)\noffers the following definition of proposition identity:\n<p>=<q> if and only if the property of\nbeing such that p is identical to the property of being such\nthat q.  A third proposal, not incompatible with the second,\nis to explain proposition identity in terms of the “free\ngeneration” of propositions from a stock of certain\nnon-propositional entities, e.g., individuals, properties and\nrelations, by algebraic operations (Bealer 1982, Menzel 1986, Zalta\n1983 and \n 1989).[10]\n Although propositions on this approach are unstructured, each\nproposition may be represented by its “construction\nsequence.” To avoid identifying <Hesperus is beautiful>\nwith <Phosphorus is beautiful>, the relevant inputs cannot\nsimply be Hesperus (Phosphorus) and the property of being beautiful.\nA well-known strategy to cope with this problem, due to Frege, is to\nappeal to different modes of presentation associated with the\ndifferent names, each contributing something different to the\nproposition expressed.  However, these modes need not be understood as\ncomplex properties uniquely exemplified by referent of the name. For\ninstance, Bealer (1998) invokes what he calls\n“non-Platonic” modes of presentation.  Whether these\nnon-Platonic modes of presentation are understood as words, as causal\nchains of word use, or in some other way, the important point is that\nthe mode associated with ‘Hesperus’ will be different than\nthat associated with ‘Phosphorus’. Zalta (1989) introduces\npropositions with abstract constituents to do the work of these modes.\nOn Zalta’s view, such singular propositions are built out of abstract\nindividuals that encode the cognitive content of names. Since these\nabstract individuals encode this cognitive content, there is no need\nfor the referent of the name to instantiate it, and a fortiori no need\nfor the content to be a property uniquely instantiated by this\nreferent.  For more on encoding vs. instantiating, see section 6 of\nthe entry on existence.  Thus, these\ntheorists hope to use the metaphysical tools of these algebraic\naccounts to accommodate some of the key Fregean intuitions about\ndifferences in propositions expressed while avoiding difficulties with\nthe Fregean doctrine of sense. For a recent criticism of the notion of propositional constituency, see\nKeller (2013); for a positive account of propositional constituency,\nsee Gilmore (2014).  \n\nFrege famously wrote, “‘Facts, facts, facts’ cries\nthe scientist if he wants to bring home the necessity of a firm\nfoundation for science. What is a fact? A fact is a thought that is\ntrue.” (1918, p. 25) \n\nIs a fact just a true proposition? There are metaphysical and\nlinguistic arguments to the contrary. Here is a standard metaphysical\nargument. The fact that snow is white couldn’t exist if snow\nwasn’t white, but the true proposition would (only it would be\nfalse). Therefore, the fact isn’t the true proposition (See\nMoore 1953, p. 308). Facts might be, still, in some sense,\nderivative from true propositions, even if the identity claim fails.\nFollowing Moore (1953, pp. 261–2) and Slote (1974, p. 99), Kit Fine\n(1982, pp. 52–3) suggests that facts may be conceived as\nconcretizations of true propositions. Thus, the fact that p is the\ntruth of <p>. However, so construing facts makes them\npoor candidates for truthmakers: the truth of p, presumably,\nis not what makes <p> true. \n\nOne well-known linguistic argument against identifying facts with\ntrue propositions is closely related to the Ambiguity Response to The\nSubstitution Problem, considered in Section 5.4. Substitution of\n‘the fact that p’ for ‘the true proposition that\np’, or vice versa, produces peculiarities such as “John\nbelieves the fact that Obama is president”, or Harman’s (2003)\n“The true proposition that fires are hot makes it the case that\nfires are hot.” If facts were true propositions, so it is argued,\none would expect the substitutions to preserve truth. \n\nNonetheless, there are other uses of ‘fact’ that support\nthe identification: \n\nUsed in this way, ‘fact’ seems to apply to entities that\nresemble propositions, in that they have two modes of being: existence\nand something akin to truth (e.g., obtaining) (see McGrath\n 2003).[11] \n\nOne option, in the face of apparently conflicting uses of\n‘fact’, is to posit an ambiguity. (Fine 1982, p. 54) There\nare two kinds of entity associated with different uses of\n‘fact’: one kind has one mode of being (it simply exists),\nthe other has having two modes of being (it may exist without\nobtaining). “Bipolar” facts correspond, roughly, to what\nsome philosophers call possible states of affairs. \n\nHowever, some philosophers would want to distinguish even such\nbipolar facts from propositions. Bipolar facts, the argument goes, are\nstates of affairs, rather than true propositions. Clearly, not all\npropositions can be possible states of affairs, because there are\npropositions that are not possibly true, whereas possible states of\naffairs must obtain in at least some possible world. We might wish to\nextend the notion of a state of affairs to include impossible ones.\nWhether states of affairs, understood in this extended sense, are\npropositions clearly depends on the answers to questions about their\nidentity conditions. See the entry on\n states of affairs,\n as well as Richard (2013) for a recent view identifying propositions with states of affairs. \n\nKing (1995, 2007, 2014) argues that all propositions are facts, although\nnot the ones that we might expect. The proposition that Mary loves\nJohn is not the fact that Mary loves John but rather (to a first\napproximation) the following fact: Mary, loving, and John being the\nsemantic values of linguistic items standing in a certain syntactic\nrelation (represented by a phrase marker tree) which encodes\ninstantiation. King argues that his account has many virtues.  It\nhelps solve the problem of the unity of the proposition (see the\nprevious section), insofar as the structure of a proposition derives\nfrom the syntactic structure of a corresponding sentence.  It requires\nrelatively minimal ontological commitments: if one accepts that there\nare languages with expressions designating objects and properties and\nin which certain syntactic relations encode instantiation, then one\nwill accept King-propositions. The account also provides for finely\nindividuated propositions: differences in syntactic structure of\nsentences will carry over to differences in the propositions\nexpressed.  Given that the existence of King-propositions seems to\ndepend on their being language-users who use language in certain ways,\nKing is a conceptualist about propositions. (See section 7.2\nabove). \n\nIn discussing the question of whether there are properties, D. M.\nArmstrong (1989) distinguishes sparse from abundant conceptions of\nproperties. Following standard terminology, let us say that when a\npredicate has a property as its semantic content, the predicate\nexpresses that property. (For simplicity, we will assume that\nsentences can have propositions as semantic contents.) Under an\nabundant conception of properties, whether a predicate expresses a\nproperty depends only on its broadly syntactic facts about it. The\nsimplest abundant conception holds that every well-formed predicate\nexpresses a property. According to sparse conceptions, not every\nsyntactically well-formed predicate expresses a property.  \n\nA similar distinction may be applied to conceptions of propositions.\nAbundant conceptions will impose only broadly syntactic restrictions on\nthe expression of propositions. Sparse conceptions will deny that\nhaving the relevant syntactic properties is sufficient for the\nexpression and designation of propositions. \n\nOne motivation for accepting a sparse conception of propositions is\nexpressivism in metaethics. “Old-fashioned” expressivists\n(e.g., Ayer and Stevenson) claimed that moral sentences are\nnon-cognitive. We cannot believe that lying in politics is wrong, nor\ncan we have any broadly cognitive attitudes (e.g., disbelief) of the\nform ‘A-ing that p’ where\n‘p’ contains moral terms. If we cannot have such\nattitudes, then presumably there are no moral propositions. (If there\nwere such propositions, why wouldn’t there be possible cognitive\nattitudes having them as contents?). And if there are no moral\npropositions, then moral sentences do not express propositions, and so\nlack truth-value. \n\nWe certainly talk and think as if we have moral beliefs, as if we\nbelieve moral propositions. For the old-fashioned expressivist, then,\nmany of our apparently sincere ordinary claims will have to be\nrejected. Endorsing such a sparse conception of propositions thus leads\nto the surprising consequence all moral sentences lack truth-value. \n\nSome contemporary expressivists (Blackburn 1998, Horwich 1993,\nStoljar 1993) are less averse to moral propositions, moral properties\nand moral facts. But they take these commitments as\n shallow.[12]\n They accept an abundant conception of propositions, properties, etc.,\nbut combine it with a generous dose of deflationism. There are moral\npropositions, but they are mere shadows of moral declarative\nsentences. (Even if they are shadows of our sentences in some sense,\nthey are not shadows in another sense, at least if the Easy Arguments\nfor mind-independence and abstractness are successful: what is\nmind-independent and abstract is, in a clear sense, not merely a\nshadow of sentences.) \n\nAt least three important questions can be asked about the combination\nof expressivism and deflationism about moral propositions. First, if\nthe expressivist accepts moral propositions, what is the difference\nbetween expressivism and realism?  Second, by accepting deflationary\nmoral propositions, can the expressivist avoid the familiar problems\nfor moral realism (and cognitivism) which helped motivate expressivism\nin the first place? Third, can the realist avoid these familiar\nproblems equally well by accepting deflationary moral\npropositions? \n The first question is examined in the entry on\n moral cognitivism vs non-cognitivism.\n We will briefly discuss the other two. \n\nConsider, for example, the Humean argument facing realism, a crude\nversion of which is as follows. If there are moral propositions, then\nmoral judgments are beliefs in moral propositions. But moral judgments\nare intrinsically motivational states, whereas beliefs are not. So,\nthere are no moral propositions. Of course, this argument may be\ncriticized as relying on an overly strong internalism, or a\nsimple-minded speculative psychology. But even when improved, it is\nnot immediately clear how accepting deflationism about moral\npropositions will help the expressivist solve the problem. The moral\npropositions exist, and so why can’t they be believed independently of\nhaving any intrinsically motivating states?  How can their\ndeflationary character help defuse this question?  Moreover, suppose\nthat deflationism did help the expressivist cope with this problem.\nWhy couldn’t the realist follow suit with her own appeal to\ndeflationism? \n\nBlackburn’s supervenience argument is a second argument\nagainst realism. Blackburn formulated the argument in terms of moral\nproperties, as follows. If there are moral properties, then they\nsupervene on non-moral properties as a matter of conceptual necessity.\nThat is, in every conceptually possible world, if two things share all\nnon-moral properties, they share all moral properties. But if there\nare moral properties, the pattern of supervenience is not itself\nconceptually necessary. So, even if all Ps are Ms in\nfact, there is some conceptually possible world in which there is a\nP which isn’t an M. Blackburn’s question is this: if\nmoral properties can come apart from non-moral properties\nacross worlds, why can’t they come apart from them\nwithin worlds?  That is: what explains the “ban on\nmixed worlds”? A similar problem can be formulated for truth as\na feature of moral propositions. What explains the ban on conceptually\npossible worlds in which one moral proposition <x is\nM> is true, while another moral proposition <y\nis M> is false, but in which all relevant non-moral\npropositions <x is P> and <y is\nP> are alike in truth-value? What is not immediately clear\nis, first, how deflationary moral propositions will prove useful to\nthe expressivist in answering this question, and second, how,\nsupposing they do prove useful, why they won’t prove equally useful to\nthe realist. \nWhat the expressivist seeks is a conception of propositions (and of\ntruths, facts, and beliefs) substantive enough to explain and validate\nour ordinary realist-seeming discourse but deflationary enough to\navoid the traditional problems for realism.  Whether it is possible to\nnavigate the two is the subject of intense scrutiny in contemporary\nmetaethics.","contact.mail":"dwfrank@eiu.edu","contact.domain":"eiu.edu"}]
