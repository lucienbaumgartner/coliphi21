The controversy touches on a\nnumber of difficult questions in logic and the philosophy of logic,\nand marks an important turning-point in the development of modern\nlogic. This entry gives an overview of that controversy and of its\nphilosophical underpinnings.\n\nIn June 1899, at a ceremony marking the installation of the new\nGauss-Weber monument in Göttingen, David Hilbert delivered a\nlecture on the foundations of geometry. Published later that year by\nTeubner under the title “Grundlagen der\nGeometrie” (“Foundations of Geometry”), the\npiece stands as a watershed in the development of modern mathematics\nand logic. Though the subject-matter of the work is geometry, its\nlasting influence concerns more broadly the role of axioms in\nmathematical theories, and the systematic treatment of such\nmetatheoretical questions as consistency and independence. By\npresenting a rich trove of consistency and independence\ndemonstrations, Hilbert displays here the power of the\n“formal” approach to axioms, and lays the groundwork for\nwhat soon becomes our own contemporary model-theoretic approach to\nformal systems. (For the historical background to Hilbert’s\ntreatment of axioms, see Hallett 2012 and\n Nineteenth Century Geometry;\n for the role of Hilbert’s work in the development of model\ntheory, see\n model theory\n and Eder & Schiemer 2018.) \nHilbert’s lecture and monograph inspired a sharp reaction from\nhis contemporary Gottlob Frege, who found both Hilbert’s\nunderstanding of axioms, and his approach to consistency and\nindependence demonstrations, virtually incomprehensible and at any\nrate seriously flawed. Frege’s reaction is first laid out in his\ncorrespondence with Hilbert from December 1899 to September 1900, and\nsubsequently in two series of essays (both entitled “On the\nFoundations of Geometry”) published in 1903 and 1906. Hilbert\nwas never moved by Frege’s criticisms, and did not respond to\nthem after 1900. Frege, for his part, was never convinced of the\nreliability of Hilbert’s methods, and held until the end that\nthe latter’s consistency and independence proofs were fatally\n flawed.[1] \nIn this philosophical debate between the two mathematicians, we see a\nclash between two quite different ways of understanding the nature of\nmathematical theories and of their justification. The difference of\nopinion over the success of Hilbert’s consistency and\nindependence proofs is, as detailed below, the result of significant\ndifferences of opinion over such fundamental issues as: how to\nunderstand the content of a mathematical theory, what a successful\naxiomatization consists in, what the “truths” of a\nmathematical theory really are, and finally, what one is really asking\nwhen one asks about the consistency of a set of axioms or the\nindependence of a given mathematical statement from others. \nIn what follows, we look briefly at Hilbert’s technique in\nFoundations of Geometry, detail Frege’s various\ncriticisms thereof, and finally outline the overall conceptions of\nlogic that give rise to the differences. \nHilbert’s work in Foundations of Geometry (hereafter\nreferred to as “FG”) consists primarily of laying out a\nclear and precise set of axioms for Euclidean geometry, and of\ndemonstrating in detail the relations of those axioms to one another\nand to some of the fundamental theorems of geometry. In particular,\nHilbert demonstrates the consistency of various sub-groups of the\naxioms, the independence of a number of axioms from others, and\nvarious relations of provability and of independence of important\ntheorems from specific sub-groups of the axioms. Included are new\ndemonstrations of the consistency of the entire set of axioms for\nEuclidean geometry, and of the independence of the axiom of parallels\nfrom the other Euclidean axioms. \nThe notion of “independence” at issue here is that of\nnon-provability: to say that a given statement is independent\nof a collection of statements is to say that it is not provable\nfrom them, or equivalently that the collection does not logically\nentail that statement. Consistency, too, is understood in terms of\nprovability: to say that a collection of statements is consistent is\nto say that no contradiction is provable from it. Hence the two\nnotions, consistency and independence, are inter-definable: a set of\nstatements is consistent if an arbitrarily-chosen contradiction is\nindependent of it, and a statement S is independent of a set\nC if the set \\(C \\cup {\\sim}S\\) is consistent. \nHilbert’s consistency demonstrations in FG are all\ndemonstrations of relative consistency, which is to say that\nin each case the consistency of a set AX of geometric axioms is\nreduced to that of a familiar background theory B,\ndemonstrating that AX is consistent if B is. The\nimportant technique Hilbert employs is the reinterpretation\nof the geometric terms appearing in AX in such a way that, as\nreinterpreted, the members of AX express theorems of B.\nFor example, Hilbert’s first consistency-proof interprets the\nterms “point”, “line”, and “lies\non” as standing respectively for a particular collection of\nordered pairs of real numbers, for a collection of ratios of real\nnumbers, and for an algebraically-defined relation between such pairs\nand ratios; under this reinterpretation, the geometric sentences in\nquestion express theorems of the background theory of real\nnumbers. \nThat such a reinterpretation strategy guarantees relative consistency\ncan be seen via the following reasoning: If the set AX were\ninconsistent, then it would logically imply a contradiction. But as\nlogical implication is independent of the specific meanings of such\nterms as “point” and “line”, AX would\ncontinue to imply a contradiction under its reinterpretation. But that\nis just to say that a set of theorems of B would imply a\ncontradiction, hence that B itself would be inconsistent. \nIndependence is demonstrated in exactly the same way. To show that a\nstatement I is independent of a set AX of statements\n(relative to the consistency of B), one interprets the relevant\ngeometric terms in such a way that the members of AX, as\ninterpreted, express theorems of B, while I expresses\nthe negation of a theorem of B. That is, the independence of\nI from AX (relative to the consistency of B) is\ndemonstrated by proving the consistency of \\(\\textit{AX} \\cup\n\\{{\\sim}I\\}\\) relative to that of B. \nThe general idea of using interpretation to prove consistency was not\nnovel in FG; similar strategies had been recently applied in various\nmathematical schools to show consistency and independence in\narithmetic and in class theory, as well as\n geometry.[2]\n The technique also has antecedents in the earlier use of geometric\nmodels to prove the consistency of non-Euclidean geometries.\n [3]\n Hilbert’s work in FG brings however a significant advance in\nterms of the clarity and systematic application of the technique, and\nan influential account of the nature of the metatheoretic reasoning\ninvolved in demonstrating consistency and independence via\nreinterpretation. Once Hilbert’s technique is applied to the\nsentences of a fully formalized language, a development that took\nplace in stages over the three decades following FG, we obtain\nessentially the modern understanding of models, whose use today in\ndemonstrations of consistency and independence differs only in detail\nfrom that of Hilbert’s\n technique.[4] \nHilbert’s central idea, again, is to focus not on particular\ngeometrical concepts like point and line, but to pay\nattention instead to the logical relations that are said, by the\naxioms, to hold between those concepts. The question of the\nindependence of the parallels axiom from the other Euclidean axioms\nhas entirely to do with the logical structure exhibited by these\naxioms, and nothing to do with whether it is geometric points\nand lines one is talking about, or some other subject-matter\naltogether. As Hilbert says, \n[I]t is surely obvious that every theory is only a scaffolding or\nschema of concepts together with their necessary relations to one\nanother, and that the basic elements can be thought of in any way one\nlikes. If in speaking of my points I think of some system of things,\ne.g., the system: love, law, chimney-sweep … and then assume\nall my axioms as relations between these things, then my propositions,\ne.g., Pythagoras’ theorem, are also valid for these things. In\nother words: any theory can always be applied to infinitely many\nsystems of basic elements. (Letter to Frege of December 29, 1899, as\nexcerpted by Frege [ellipsis Hilbert’s or Frege’s] in\nFrege 1980: 40) \nThis understanding of the geometric terms as susceptible of multiple\ninterpretations enables one to see the geometric sentences themselves,\nand sets of them, as providing definitions of a certain kind,\na kind typically referred to as “implicit definition”.\nSpecifically: A set AX of sentences containing n\nreinterpretable terms implicitly defines an n-place relation\n\\(R_{\\textit{AX}}\\) holding of just those n-tuples which, when\ntaken respectively as the interpretations of AX’s\nreinterpretable terms, render the members of AX true. (For\nexample: if AX is the set {There are at least two\npoints; Every point lies on at least two\nlines}, then \\(R_{\\textit{AX}}\\) is the relation that holds\nof any triple \\(\\langle P, \\textit{LO}, L\\rangle\\) such that P\nhas at least two members, L has at least two members, and\nLO is a relation that holds between each member of P and\nat least two members of L.) The defined relation is simply the\nabstract structure, or as Hilbert puts it the\n“scaffolding”, shared by any such\n n-tuple.[5] \nWhen a set of sentences provides an implicit definition of a relation,\none can ask whether that relation (and, by extension, the set of\nsentences itself) is satisfiable. That is, one can ask\nwhether there is an n-tuple which, when serving as the\ninterpretation of the relevant terms in the sentences, will make each\nsentence true. Each of Hilbert’s consistency-demonstrations in\nFG provides an n-tuple that satisfies the relevant defined\nrelation, and hence provides a proof of the satisfiability of that\nrelation. Satisfiability in this sense is sufficient for consistency,\nvia the reasoning given\n above.[6] \nWe can now redescribe Hilbert’s technique, in a nutshell, as\nfollows: Given a set AX of sentences, Hilbert appeals to a\nbackground theory B to construct an interpretation of\nAX’s geometric terms under which the members of AX\nexpress theorems of B. This interpretation is, assuming the\nconsistency of B, an n-tuple satisfying the relation\n\\(R_{\\textit{AX}}\\) defined by AX. Its existence demonstrates\nthe satisfiability of \\(R_{\\textit{AX}}\\) and consequently the\nconsistency of AX relative to that of B. Similarly for\nthe independence of I from AX.  \nFor Frege, things are radically different. Frege takes it that the\nsentences we use in mathematics are important only because of\nthe nonlinguistic propositions (or, as he puts it, the\n“thoughts”) they express. Mathematicians working in French\nand in German are working on the same subject because, as Frege sees\nit, their sentences express the same thoughts. Each thought is about a\ndeterminate subject-matter, and says something true or false about\nthat\n subject-matter.[7]\n Thoughts are also on this view the things that logically imply or\ncontradict one another, the things that are true or false, and the\nthings that together constitute mathematical theories. Hence, in\nFrege’s view, thoughts, rather than sentences, are the items\nabout which the questions of consistency and independence arise.  \nBecause each thought has a determinate subject-matter, it makes no\nsense to talk about the “reinterpretation” of thoughts.\nThe kind of reinterpretation that Hilbert engages in, i.e., of\nassigning different meanings to specific words, is something that can\napply only to sentences, from the Fregean point of view. Accordingly,\nthe first difficulty Frege notes with Hilbert’s approach is that\nit is not clear what Hilbert means by “axioms:” if he\nmeans the kinds of things for which issues of consistency and\nindependence can arise, then he must be talking about thoughts, while\nif he means the kinds of things that are susceptible of multiple\ninterpretations, then he must be talking about sentences. \nThe difficulties multiply from here. When Hilbert provides a specific\nreinterpretation of the geometric terms en route to proving\nthe relative consistency of a set AX of sentences, Frege notes\nthat we now have two different sets of thoughts in play: the set we\nmight call “\\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\)” of thoughts expressed\nwhen AX’s terms take their ordinary geometric meanings\n(e.g., on which “point” means point) and the set\nwe might call “\\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\)” of thoughts expressed\nwhen AX’s terms take the meanings assigned by\nHilbert’s re-interpretation (on which, e.g., “point”\nmeans pair of real numbers). Hilbert’s reinterpretation\nstrategy involves, from Frege’s point of view, simply shifting\nour attention from the set \\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\) of thoughts ordinarily\nexpressed by the sentences AX (and in whose consistency we are\ninterested) to the new set \\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\) of thoughts expressed\nby AX under the reinterpretation. And the fact that the\nreinterpreted sentences express truths about real numbers has little\nto do, from Frege’s perspective, with the consistency and\nindependence questions that arise for the original thoughts about\npoints, lines, and planes. \nIn addition to the confusing (as Frege sees it) practice of shifting\nback and forth between different sets of thoughts while discussing a\ngiven set of sentences, Hilbert’s procedure also involves, as\nFrege sees it, two further questionable aspects. \nThe first concerns the need for consistency proofs. On Frege’s\nview, the axioms of a theory always form a collection of true\nthoughts; and since truth implies consistency, the consistency of a\ncollection of axioms is never in need of demonstration. For Hilbert on\nthe other hand, the fact that a collection of sentences is taken as\naxiomatic is no guarantee of truth (or of truth under a given\ninterpretation), and a demonstration of consistency is often a crucial\nstep in establishing the mathematical respectability of that\ncollection of axioms. \nSecondly, Hilbert and Frege differ importantly over the connection\nbetween truth and consistency. Taking a theory to be axiomatized by a\nset of multiply-interpretable sentences, Hilbert’s view is that the\nconsistency of such a set suffices for the existence of the (or a)\ncollection of mathematical entities mentioned in the theory. The\nconsistency, for example, of a theory of complex numbers is all\nthat’s needed to justify the mathematical practice of reasoning in\nterms of such numbers. For Frege on the other hand, consistency can\nnever guarantee existence. His preferred example to make this point is\nthat the consistency (in Hilbert’s sense) of the trio of\nsentences  \nis insufficient to guarantee their instantiation. (See, e.g.,\nFrege’s letter to Hilbert of 6 January 1900; Frege 1980: 47.)\n \nThe central difference between Frege and Hilbert over the nature of\naxioms, i.e., over the question whether axioms are determinately true\nclaims about a fixed subject-matter or reinterpretable sentences\nexpressing multiply-instantiable conditions, lies at the heart of the\ndifference between an older way of thinking of theories, exemplified\nby Frege, and a new way that gathered strength at the end of the\nnineteenth century. Perhaps most clearly illustrated in Dedekind 1888,\nthe central idea of the new approach is to understand mathematical\ntheories as characterizing general “structural” conditions that\nmight be had in common by any number of different ordered domains.\nJust as, in algebra, the axioms for a group give general\nconditions that can be satisfied by any manner of object whatsoever\nunder appropriate relations, so too on the new view the axioms of\ngeometry specify multiply-instantiable conditions. Viewing theories\nfrom this modern perspective, it is entirely appropriate to take\naxioms as Hilbert does, since reinterpretable sentences are the right\nvehicles to express the multiply-instantiable conditions in\n question.[8]\n From the point of view of the earlier fixed-domain conception of\ntheories, on the other hand, such reinterpretable sentences are\nentirely inappropriate as axioms, since they fail to fix a determinate\nsubject-matter. On this question, i.e., the issue of the fixed-domain\n(Fregean) vs. multiply-instantiable structure (Hilbertian) conception\nof mathematical theories, the jury is still out: this debate continues\nto animate contemporary philosophy of mathematics (see entry on\n philosophy of mathematics).\n  \nThe second issue that divides Frege and Hilbert, regarding the\njustifiability of the inference from consistency to existence, is also\nstill alive. While everybody (including presumably Hilbert) would\nagree with Frege that outside of the mathematical domain we cannot\nsafely infer existence from consistency, the question remains whether\nwe can (or must) do so within mathematics. The Fregean point of view\nis that the existence of mathematical objects can only be proven (if\nat all) by appeal to more fundamental principles, while the Hilbertian\npoint of view is that in appropriate purely-mathematical cases, there\nis nothing more to be demonstrated, in order to establish existence,\nthan the consistency of a theory (see entries on\n philosophy of mathematics\n and\n Platonism in the philosophy of mathematics).\n  \nDespite these differences, Frege and Hilbert agree that there are\nimportant mathematical questions to be asked regarding consistency and\nindependence, and they agree that, e.g., the classic question of the\nindependence of the parallels axiom from the remainder of Euclidean\ngeometry is a significant one. But they disagree, as noted above,\nabout whether Hilbert’s procedure suffices to settle these\nquestions. We turn next to the issue of Frege’s rationale for\nrejecting Hilbert’s method for proving consistency and\nindependence.  \nAs noted above, Frege views Hilbert’s reinterpretations as\ninvolving a shift of attention from geometric thoughts (whose\nconsistency and independence are at issue) to thoughts of a wholly\ndifferent kind, those about the background theory B (whose consistency\nand independence are not in question). Regarding consistency proofs,\nhis view is that Hilbert makes an illegitimate inference from the\nconsistency of a collection \\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\) of thoughts about real\nnumbers to the consistency of a collection \\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\) of\nthoughts about geometric points, lines, and planes. Frege acknowledges\nthat Hilbert’s set AX of sentences can be understood as\nproviding an implicit definition of an abstract relation\n\\(R_{\\textit{AX}}\\), one that is satisfied by Hilbert’s\nconstructed n-tuples, and that the consistency (i.e.,\nsatisfiability) of \\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\) entails the consistency of that\ndefined relation. But here too, Frege takes it that Hilbert’s\ncrucial inference, from the consistency of \\(R_{\\textit{AX}}\\) to the\nconsistency of \\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\), is problematic. As Frege himself\nputs it, referring to \\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\) and \\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\) as\n“special geometries”, and to \\(R_{\\textit{AX}}\\) as the\n“general case:”  \n[G]iven that the axioms in special geometries are all special cases of\ngeneral axioms, one can conclude from lack of contradiction in a\nspecial geometry to lack of contradiction in the general case, but not\nto lack of contradiction in another special case. (Letter of January\n6, 1900 in Frege 1980: 48) \nOnce he has pointed out what he takes to be the questionable\ninference, Frege takes it that the burden of argument is squarely with\nHilbert: if Hilbert thinks that the consistency of \\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\)\nfollows from either the consistency of \\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\) or from the\nsatisfiability of \\(R_{\\textit{AX}}\\), then it is up to Hilbert to\nshow this. Frege does not go out of his way to demonstrate that the\ncrucial inference is invalid, but seems to take his point to have been\nessentially made once he has pointed out the need for a justification\nhere.  \nFrom Hilbert’s point of view, of course, there is no need for\nsuch a justification. The differences that Frege insists on over and\nover again between the sets of sentences (AX) and the different\nsets of thoughts (\\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\), \\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\) etc.) are\nentirely inconsequential from Hilbert’s standpoint. Because\nconsistency as Hilbert understands it applies to the\n“scaffolding” of concepts and relations defined by\nAX when its geometric terms are taken as place-holders, the\nconsistency he has in mind holds (to put it in terms of thoughts) of\n\\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\) iff it holds of \\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\), since both\nsets of thoughts are instantiations of the same\n“scaffolding”. The same point can be put in terms of\nsentences: Frege insists that the consistency-question that arises for\nthe sentences under their geometric interpretation is a different\nissue from the one that arises for those sentences under their\nreal-number interpretation; for Hilbert on the other hand, there is\njust one question, and it is answered in the affirmative if there is\nany interpretation under which the sentences express truths. Hence\nwhile Frege takes it that Hilbert owes an explanation of the inference\nfrom the consistency of \\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\) to that of\n\\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\), for Hilbert there is simply no inference. \nFrege’s lack of clarity about his reasons for rejecting\nHilbert’s procedure leaves an interpretive gap, with respect to\nwhich there is room for controversy. We should recall, to begin with,\nthat Hilbert is clearly right that his own reinterpretation strategy\nsuffices for the relative consistency and independence results he\nclaims. If consistency and independence are understood, as above, in\nterms of non-provability, and if proof is, as Hilbert\nassumes, independent of the meanings of geometric terms, then\n\\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\), \\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\), and even AX itself\nare all consistent if one of them is. Frege’s rejection of\nHilbert’s technique must involve, then, either some confusion\nabout what Hilbert has established, or a different understanding of\nwhat is at issue in claims of consistency and independence.  \nOne way to understand Frege’s contribution to the Frege-Hilbert\ndebate, then, is to recognize the contributions Frege makes in\nclarifying Hilbert’s own approach to axioms, but to hold that\nFrege’s negative assessment of Hilbert’s technique for\nproving consistency and independence is mistaken. On this account,\ndespite the difference between Frege and Hilbert over the nature of\naxioms, nevertheless the satisfiability of \\(R_{\\textit{AX}}\\) does\nshow the consistency of the collection of axioms in question, whether\none conceives of those axioms in Hilbert’s way as sentences\n(i.e., as the collection AX) or in Frege’s way as\nthoughts (i.e., as the collection \\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\)). Similarly for\nindependence. Frege’s mistake, on this view, is to have failed\nto notice that the kind of non-provability result (i.e.,\nconsistency or independence) that Hilbert takes his reinterpretations\nto demonstrate for geometric sentences entails a corresponding\nnon-provability (consistency or independence) result for geometric\nthoughts (see Resnik 1974, Currie 1982, Dummett 1975).  \nThe alternative interpretation argues that Frege’s understanding\nof consistency and independence is sufficiently different from\nHilbert’s that the entailment in question does not hold: that\nthe satisfiability of \\(R_{\\textit{AX}}\\), and the consequent\nconsistency in Hilbert’s sense of AX, does not entail the\nconsistency in Frege’s sense of \\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\). Similarly\nfor independence. According to this interpretation, Frege is right to\nclaim that Hilbert’s demonstrations fail to show consistency and\nindependence in the sense in which he, Frege, understands these\n terms.[9] \nThe central idea of the alternative interpretation is that for Frege,\nthe question whether a given thought is logically entailed by a\ncollection of thoughts is sensitive not just to the formal structure\nof the sentences used to express those thoughts, but also to the\ncontents of the simple (e.g., geometric) terms that appear in those\nsentences. If this is correct, then we see immediately that the\nconsistency of \\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\) need not entail the consistency of\n\\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\), since the question whether \\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\)\nlogically entails a contradiction may turn in part on the specifically\ngeometric parts of the thoughts in question, i.e., on the usual\ngeometric meanings of AX’s geometric terms. To choose an\nillustrative example, though not one that Frege himself gives,\nconsider the pair of sentences \nThis pair of sentences is demonstrably consistent in Hilbert’s\nsense. But on the interpretation of Frege suggested here, this\nconsistency (in Hilbert’s sense) does not ensure that the\nthoughts expressed by these sentences under their ordinary\ninterpretation form a consistent collection. If, for example, Frege\nunderstands the relation ’between’ as susceptible to\nconceptual analysis, in accordance with which the first thought can be\nseen to logically entail the negation of the second, then the pair of\nthoughts are inconsistent with one another in the straightforward\nsense of logically entailing a contradiction.  \nThe idea that Frege takes logical entailment to be sensitive to\nconceptual analysis in the way just suggested is taken, on this\naccount, to be evident in the strategy Frege employs in his life-long\nattempt to demonstrate his logicist thesis, the thesis that the truths\nof arithmetic are provable from pure logic. In the course of that\nproject, Frege regularly provides demonstrations that a given thought\nτ follows logically from a set T of thoughts, in a way that\ninvolves two steps. First, Frege subjects τ and/or the members of\nT to conceptual analysis, bringing out previously-unrecognized\nconceptual complexity in those thoughts. Secondly, he proves the\nthus-analyzed version of τ from the thus-analyzed members of\nT. For example, Frege takes himself to demonstrate that the\nthought expressed by \nfollows logically from the thoughts expressed by \nand by \nThe demonstration proceeds by providing a careful analysis of the\nnotion of “multiple of” in terms of addition, giving us in\nplace of (i) a more-complex (i′) which is then proven from (ii)\nand\n (iii).[10]\n Similarly, a significant part of Frege’s logicist project\nconsists of the careful analysis of such arithmetical notions as\nzero and successor, analysis which brings out\npreviously-unnoticed complexity, and facilitates the proof of\narithmetical truths. (For a discussion of the logicist project, see\nentries on\n Frege\n and\n logicism and neologicism.)\n  \nAs Frege puts it in the early pages of his Foundations of\nArithmetic, when we are trying to prove the truths of arithmetic\nfrom the simplest possible starting-points, \n… we very soon come to propositions which cannot be proved so\nlong as we do not succeed in analysing concepts which occur in them\ninto simpler concepts or in reducing them to something of greater\ngenerality. (Frege 1884: §4) \nIn short: the components of thoughts can sometimes be analyzed in\nterms of simpler or more general constituents, in a way that brings to\nlight previously-hidden relations of logical entailment. Hence when we\nwant to know whether a given thought is logically entailed by a set of\nthoughts, we need to pay attention, from Frege’s point of view,\nnot just to the overall structure exhibited by the sentences\nexpressing those thoughts, but also to the contents of the individual\nterms that appear in those sentences. \nThe connection between this aspect of Frege’s work and his views\nregarding independence, on the interpretation in question, is as\nfollows. Because we can sometimes discover that a thought τ is\nlogically entailed by a set T of thoughts only after a careful\nanalysis of some of the apparently-simple components of those\nthoughts, so too we will sometimes be able to discover that a set of\nthoughts is inconsistent, i.e., that it logically entails a\ncontradiction, on the basis of such conceptual analysis. Hence the\nconsistency of the set of thoughts expressed by a set Σ of\nsentences is something which turns not just on the overall structure\nof the sentences in Σ, but on the meanings of the terms\nappearing in Σ’s sentences. \nTo clarify this last point, let’s look at a non-mathematical\nexample, one which neither Hilbert nor Frege explicitly dealt with.\nConsider the set of sentences {Jones had a nightmare, Jones\ndidn’t have a dream}, or equivalently its first-order rendition,\n\\(\\{Nj, {{\\sim}Dj}\\}\\). The set is clearly consistent in the sense\nused by Hilbert in FG; it is a straightforward matter to provide\ninterpretations of “Jones”, “x had a\nnightmare” and “x had a dream” (or of\n“j”, “N”, and\n“D”) such that the sentences, so interpreted,\nexpress truths. (Consider, for example, an interpretation on which\n“j” is assigned the number 7,\n“N” the set of prime numbers, and\n“D” the set of numbers greater than 12.) But from\nthe Fregean point of view, the thoughts expressed are arguably\ninconsistent, since part of what it is to have a nightmare is to have\na dream. The inconsistency from Frege’s point of view can be\ndemonstrated by providing an analysis of the thoughts expressed, and\nnoting that the results of this analysis yield the set {Jones had a\ndisturbing dream, Jones didn’t have a dream}. \nFor the same reason, two sets of thoughts that are structurally\nsimilar in the sense that they can be expressed, under different\ninterpretations, by the same set of sentences, can differ with respect\nto Frege-consistency. As applied to the geometric context, the central\nidea, on this account of Frege’s objection to Hilbert, is that\nthe kinds of re-interpretation in which Hilbert engages can take one\nfrom a consistent set of thoughts (e.g., \\(\\textit{AX}_{R}\\)) to an\ninconsistent one (e.g., \\(\\textit{AX}_{G}\\)) because of the shift in\nsubject-matter, hence invalidating the inference from the consistency\nof the first to the consistency of the second.  \nFrege does not claim to be able to give specific geometric analyses\nwhich contradict particular consistency-claims of Hilbert’s, and\nthere is no evidence that he takes any of those claims to be false.\nThat he might well have had some such analyses in mind is hinted at in\na letter to Hilbert in which he claims that in his own unfinished\ninvestigations into the foundations of geometry, he was able to\n“make do with fewer primitive terms”, which presumably\nmeans that he takes some of the terms treated as primitive by Hilbert\nto be susceptible of analysis via others (see the letter to Hilbert of\nDecember 27, 1899 in Frege 1980: 34). Any such analysis would reveal\nrelations of logical dependence (from Frege’s point of view)\nwhere Hilbert would find independence.  \nBecause none of Frege’s work on this topic has survived, we have\nno details about the specific analyses he might have given. The\ncrucial point in Frege’s criticism of Hilbert, however, on this\naccount, is not a disagreement about particular analyses or the\nconsequent failure of particular consistency and independence claims,\nbut is instead about the general methodology of consistency and\nindependence proofs. Because for Hilbert the consistency of a set of\nsentences turns entirely on the overall structure they exhibit, while\nfor Frege the consistency of the set of thoughts expressed turns\nadditionally on the contents of the non-logical terms appearing in the\nsentences, on this account, Hilbert-consistency doesn’t imply\nFrege-consistency. \nWe have surveyed two ways of understanding Frege’s objections to\nHilbert’s techniques for proving consistency and independence.\nThe first takes Frege to be fundamentally mistaken, with the error\nlocated in his failure to appreciate the connection between the\nsatisfiability of a set of reinterpretable sentences and the\nassociated independence/consistency claims. The second takes Frege to\nbe fundamentally correct in the sense that (i) he understands the\nconsistency and independence of thoughts to turn not just on the\nsurface syntax of the sentences that express them but also on the\ncontents of the simple terms used in their expression, and (ii)\nconsistency and independence, so understood, are not demonstrable in\nHilbert’s manner.  \nNeither of these interpretive options is entirely unproblematic. An\nimportant difficulty with the first is its attribution to Frege of a\nsevere degree of confusion about the force of Hilbert’s\nre-interpretations, which is arguably in some tension with the fact\nthat, generally speaking, Frege’s account of Hilbert’s\nmethodological procedure in FG is considerably clearer than is\nHilbert’s own. A further source of difficulty is that the\nunderstanding of independence attributed on this account to Frege is\nin tension with the understanding of logical entailment that figures\ncentrally in his logicist work, an understanding on which the contents\nof mathematical terms can be crucial to questions of logical\nentailment. The second interpretation, though more charitable to\nFrege, arguably suffers from the lack of explicit mention by Frege of\nthe relevance of conceptual analysis to questions of consistency and\nindependence.  \nA final source of potential difficulty for any account of\nFrege’s views of independence and consistency is the very\ninteresting Part (iii) of the 1906 “Foundations of\nGeometry” essay. The importance of that text, and the\ninterpretive difficulties it poses, can be sketched as follows. \nThe 1906 “Foundations of Geometry” essay is primarily a\nre-statement of Frege’s earlier objections (discussed above) to\nHilbert’s treatment of consistency and independence. After a\nrehearsal of those objections, Frege turns in Part iii to the problem\nof giving a positive method for proving independence. How, he asks,\nmight one prove a given thought independent of a collection\nof thoughts? In answer, Frege provides a sketch of a potential method,\nand ends the discussion by noting that the method sketched is still\nincomplete, and that it faces some difficulties. Despite the obvious\nincompleteness, Frege never (as far as we can tell) returns to the\nproposal, and would seem in the end to have found it unsatisfactory.\nThat he thought it unsatisfactory in principle is indicated by his\nclaim four years later, in a note to Jourdain, that the unprovability\nof the parallels axiom cannot be proven (see Frege 1980: 183n). That\nis, he would seem by 1910 to hold that there is no systematic method\nfor proving\n independence.[11] \nThe 1906 proposal itself can be outlined as follows. Suppose, says\nFrege, that we have a collection C of sentences each of which\nexpresses a determinate thought, and a sentence S that similarly\nexpresses a determinate thought. The heart of the proposed method for\nproving the independence of the S-thought from the C-thoughts is that\nwe employ a mapping μ of terms to terms (and hence also of\nsentences to sentences) that preserves syntactic type (mapping names\nto names, one-place predicates to one-place predicates, etc.) and maps\n’logical’ terms to themselves. Then: the S-thought is\nindependent of the C-thoughts if μ maps S to a false sentence while\nmapping all the members of C to true sentences. (For discussion and\ndevelopment of Frege’s proposal, see Antonelli & May 2000,\nEder 2016. For discussion\nof Frege’s reasons for rejecting the proposal, see Ricketts\n1997, Eder 2013, Blanchette 2014.)  \nThe first intriguing thing about the proposal is its striking\nsimilarity to Hilbert’s method. Assuming Frege’s language\nto be rich enough to include terms for all of the objects, functions\nand sets that Hilbert might use in reinterpretations, there will\narguably be a mapping of the kind Frege describes if and only if there\nis a reinterpretation of the kind Hilbert uses to show (his version\nof) independence: where Hilbert’s reinterpretation provides a\nterm t with new content, Frege’s method would simply map\nt to a new term with that very content. And this would mean\nthat, despite all of the objections raised by Frege, Hilbert’s\nmethod would in the end suffice to demonstrate what Frege regards as\nthe independence of thoughts. If this is correct, then we have reason\nto doubt any interpretation of Frege on which his rejection of\nHilbert’s method is justified.  \nThe central reasons one might doubt the strong equivalence just\nsuggested between Hilbert’s method and Frege’s proposal\nare that (i) it is not clear just what kind of language Frege has in\nmind, and (ii) it is not clear whether the class of terms Frege would\ncount as “logical”, i.e., the class whose members μ\nmust map to themselves, is the same as the class of terms that Hilbert\nwould count as having a fixed interpretation. If Frege’s class\nof fixed terms is wider than is Hilbert’s, and/or Frege’s\nlanguage lacks some of the terminology of Hilbert’s, then a\ndemonstration of independence in Hilbert’s sense will not imply\nthe existence of a mapping demonstrating independence in Frege’s\nsense. One way to think of the crucial question is as the question\nwhether terms like “number” or “between”,\nterms that Frege treats as susceptible to conceptual analysis, will be\nallowed in the language that Frege is concerned with (as opposed, say,\nto requiring the language to contain only “fully-analyzed”\nterms), and whether such terms will be amongst those that μ maps to\narbitrary new terminology. Frege himself notes the importance of the\nsecond terminological demarcation problem just raised, i.e., the\nproblem of determining which terms are mapped to themselves, and\nremarks that this problem is one that would need to be addressed in\norder to turn his sketch into a workable strategy. Because he never\nanswers the question of the fixed terminology or of the kind of\nlanguage in question, Frege’s proposal is not sufficiently\ndeterminate for a clear comparison with Hilbert’s. We are left,\nthen, with the interpretive issue of making sense of Frege’s\nproposal of a method and subsequent apparent repudiation of it, while\nrecognizing the incomplete nature of that proposal. (For further\ndiscussion of the 1906 text, see: Ricketts 1997, Tappenden 2000,\nBlanchette 2014.)  \nBecause claims of consistency and of independence are fundamentally\nclaims of non-entailment or of unprovability, it is\nnot obvious, even once we are in possession of strong techniques for\nproving mathematical results, how one might go about proving\nconsistency and independence. What Hilbert offers us, in 1899, is a\nsystematic and powerful technique that can be used across all\nformalized disciplines to do just this: to prove consistency and\nindependence. In doing so, he lays the groundwork, in concert with\nvarious of his contemporaries, for the emergence of contemporary\nmodel-theoretic techniques. (For further discussion, see Mancosu,\nZach, & Badesa 2009; also see entry on\n nineteenth-century geometry.)\n  \nWhat we find through Frege’s rejection and Hilbert’s\ndefense of that technique is a clarification of the assumptions that\nare essential for its success. As we have seen, the crucial feature of\nproof that must be assumed, in order for a Hilbert-style\nreinterpretation to demonstrate an unprovability result, is\nthat provability is insensitive to the contents of those terms that\nHilbert takes to be reinterpretable—in this case, the geometric\nterms. The alternative view of consistency and independence, on which\nentailment and provability are sensitive to the contents of geometric\nterms, is one with respect to which Hilbert-style reinterpretations\ncannot demonstrate consistency and independence so understood. As\noutlined above, the reading of Frege on which he holds such a view of\nconsistency and independence provides a rationale for his objections\nto Hilbert, and an alternative account of what is at stake in claims\nof geometric consistency and independence.  \nDespite the clear failure of communication between Hilbert and Frege,\ntheir debate brings to light a number of important issues, not least\nof which are (i) the role of schematically-understood sentences in\nproviding implicit definitions, which Frege articulates more clearly\non Hilbert’s behalf than Hilbert had yet done, and (ii) the\nextent to which the logical relations are to be treated as\n“formal”. On this last issue, the difference between Frege\nand Hilbert is instructive. Long before the debate with Hilbert, Frege\nalready held that logical rigor requires the use of formal systems of\ndeduction, “formal” in the sense that all thoughts are\nexpressed via precisely-determined sentences, and that all\ninference-rules and axioms are presented syntactically (see, e.g.,\nFrege 1879). Most important for our purposes is the fact that\nFrege’s formal systems are entirely modern in the sense that the\nderivability in such a system of a sentence from a set of sentences\nturns just on the syntactic form of those sentences. The famous\nconceptual analyses on which much of Frege’s work turns are all\nprovided prior to proof; it is on the basis of conceptual analyses\nthat one arrives at the appropriate sentences to treat within the\nformal system, but the analyses themselves play no role within the\nproofs proper. Hence when it comes to the positive work of\ndemonstrating that a given sentence is derivable from a set of\nsentences, Frege is just like Hilbert: meanings don’t matter.\nIndeed, at the time of their correspondence, Frege’s work was\nconsiderably more “formal” than Hilbert’s, since\nHilbert at this time was not using an explicit syntactically-defined\nsystem of deduction. \nNevertheless, Frege’s conception of logic has the result that\nthere is only a one-way connection between logical implication as this\nholds between thoughts and formal derivability as this holds between\nsentences. Given a good formal system, a sentence σ is deducible\nfrom a set Σ only if the thought expressed by σ is in fact\nlogically entailed by the thoughts expressed by the members of\nΣ. (This simply requires that one’s axioms and rules of\ninference are well-chosen.) But the converse is false: that σ is\nnot deducible in such a system from Σ is no guarantee\nthat the thought expressed by σ is independent of the set of\nthoughts expressed by the members of Σ. For it may well be, as\nin the cases treated explicitly by Frege’s own analyses, that\nfurther analysis of the thoughts and their components will yield a\nmore-complex structure. When this happens, the analysis may return\nyet-more complex (sets of) sentences σ′ and Σ′\nsuch that σ′ is, after all, deducible from Σ′.\nAccording to the more-charitable of the two interpretive options\noutlined above, this is the explanation of Frege’s rejection of\nHilbert’s treatment of consistency and independence in geometry.\nAs we might put it, because considerable logical complexity can lie\nundiscovered in the thoughts expressed by relatively-simple sentences,\nnon-derivability is no guarantee of independence, in the Fregean\nscheme of things. There is a significant gap, as one might put it,\nbetween the logical and the formal. \nFor Hilbert on the other hand, at least in the context of axiomatized\ngeometry, the logical relations simply are the formally-describable\nrelations, since they have entirely to do with the structure exhibited\nby the sentences in question, or equivalently with the\n“scaffolding” of concepts defined by these sentences. It\nis because consistency in Hilbert’s sense turns just on this\nabstract structure, and not on the contents of the terms instantiating\nthe structure, that the reinterpretation strategy is effective. \nHilbert is clearly the winner in this debate, in the sense that\nroughly his conception of consistency is what one means today by\n“consistency” in the context of formal theories, and a\nnear relative of his methodology for consistency-proofs is now\nstandard. We now routinely take consistency and independence, as\nHilbert does, to hold independently of the meanings of the so-called\n“non-logical” terms, and hence to be straightforwardly\ndemonstrable in essentially Hilbert’s way. This is not to say\nthat Frege’s objections have been met, but rather that they have\nessentially been sidestepped via the enshrinement of the formal notion\nof consistency, and a lack of concern, at least under that title, with\nwhat Frege called “consistency”.
