According to these theorists, a\n“critical” theory may be distinguished from a\n“traditional” theory according to a specific practical\npurpose: a theory is critical to the extent that it seeks human\n“emancipation from slavery”, acts as a “liberating\n… influence”, and works “to create a world which\nsatisfies the needs and powers of” human beings (Horkheimer\n1972b [1992, 246]).  Because such theories aim to explain and\ntransform all the circumstances that enslave human beings,\nmany “critical theories” in the broader sense have been\ndeveloped. They have emerged in connection with the many social\nmovements that identify varied dimensions of the domination of human\nbeings in modern societies. In both the broad and the narrow senses,\nhowever, a critical theory provides the descriptive and normative\nbases for social inquiry aimed at decreasing domination and increasing\nfreedom in all their forms.\n\n\n\nCritical Theory in the narrow sense has had many different aspects and\nquite distinct historical phases that cross several generations, from\nthe effective start of the Institute for Social Research in the years\n1929–1930, which saw the arrival of the Frankfurt School\nphilosophers and an inaugural lecture by Horkheimer, to the\npresent. Its distinctiveness as a philosophical approach that extends\nto ethics, political philosophy, and the philosophy of history is most\napparent when considered in light of the history of the philosophy of\nthe social sciences. Critical Theorists have long sought to\ndistinguish their aims, methods, theories, and forms of explanation\nfrom standard understandings in both the natural and the social\nsciences. Instead, they have claimed that social inquiry ought to\ncombine rather than separate the poles of philosophy and the social\nsciences: explanation and understanding, structure and agency,\nregularity and normativity.  Such an approach, Critical Theorists\nargue, permits their enterprise to be practical in a\ndistinctively moral (rather than instrumental) sense. They do not\nmerely seek to provide the means to achieve some independent goal, but\nrather (as in Horkheimer’s famous definition mentioned above) seek\n“human emancipation” in circumstances of domination and\noppression. This normative task cannot be accomplished apart from the\ninterplay between philosophy and social science through\ninterdisciplinary empirical social research (Horkheimer 1993). While\nCritical Theory is often thought of narrowly as referring to the\nFrankfurt School that begins with Horkheimer and Adorno and stretches\nto Marcuse and Habermas, any philosophical approach with similar\npractical aims could be called a “critical theory,”\nincluding feminism, critical race theory, and some forms of\npost-colonial criticism. In the following, Critical Theory when\ncapitalized refers only to the Frankfurt School. All other uses of the\nterm are meant in the broader sense and thus not capitalized. When\nused in the singular, “a critical theory” is not\ncapitalized, even when the theory is developed by members of the\nFrankfurt School in the context of their overall project of Critical\nTheory.\n\n\n\nIt follows from Horkheimer’s definition that a critical theory\nis adequate only if it meets three criteria: it must be explanatory,\npractical, and normative, all at the same time. That is, it must\nexplain what is wrong with current social reality, identify the actors\nto change it, and provide both clear norms for criticism and\nachievable practical goals for social transformation. Any truly\ncritical theory of society, as Horkheimer further defined it in his\nwritings as Director of the Frankfurt School’s Institute for\nSocial Research, “has for its object [human beings] as producers\nof their own historical form of life” (Horkeimer 1972b [1992,\n244]). In light of the\npractical goal of identifying and overcoming all the circumstances\nthat limit human freedom, the explanatory goal could be furthered only\nthrough interdisciplinary research that includes psychological,\ncultural, and social dimensions, as well as institutional forms of\ndomination. Given the emphasis among the first generation of Critical\nTheory on human beings as the self-creating producers of their own\nhistory, a unique practical aim of social inquiry suggests itself: to\ntransform contemporary capitalism into a consensual form of social\nlife. For Horkheimer a capitalist society could be transformed only by\nbecoming more democratic, to make it such that all conditions of\nsocial life that are controllable by human beings depend on real\nconsensus in a rational society (Horkheimer 1972b [1992, 250]). The\nnormative orientation of Critical Theory, at least in its form of\ncritical social inquiry, is therefore towards the transformation of\ncapitalism into a “real democracy” in which such control\ncould be exercised (Horkheimer 1972b [1992, 250]). In such\nformulations, there are striking similarities between Critical Theory\nand American pragmatism.\n\n\n\nThe focus on democracy as the location for cooperative, practical and\ntransformative activity continues today in the work of Jürgen\nHabermas, as does the attempt to determine the nature and limits of\n“real democracy” in complex, pluralistic, and globalizing\nsocieties.\n\n\n\nAs might be expected from such an ambitious philosophical project and\nform of inquiry, Critical Theory is rife with tensions. In what\nfollows I will develop the arguments within Critical Theory that\nsurround its overall philosophical project. First, I explore its basic\nphilosophical orientation or metaphilosophy. In its efforts to combine\nempirical social inquiry and normative philosophical argumentation,\nCritical Theory presents a viable alternative for social and political\nphilosophy today. Second, I will consider its core normative\ntheory—its relation to its transformation of a Kantian ethics of\nautonomy into a conception of freedom and justice in which democracy\nand democratic ideals play a central role (Horkheimer 1993, 22;\nHorkheimer 1972b [1992, 203]). As a member of the second generation of\nCritical Theory, Habermas in particular has developed this dimension\nof normative political theory into a competitor to Rawlsian\nconstructivism, which attempts to bring our pretheoretical intuitions\ninto reflective equilibrium. In the third section, I will consider its\nempirical orientation in practical social theory and practical social\ninquiry that aims at promoting democratic norms. A fundamental tension\nemerges between a comprehensive social theory that provides a\ntheoretical basis for social criticism and a more pluralist and\npractical orientation that does not see any particular theory or\nmethodology as distinctive of Critical Theory as such. In this way,\nthe unresolved tension between the empirical and normative aspects of\nthe project of a critical theory oriented to the realization of human\nfreedom is manifest in each of its main contributions to philosophy\ninformed by social science. Finally, I examine the contribution of\nCritical Theory to debates about globalization, in which the potential\ntransformation of both democratic ideals and institutions is at\nstake.\n\n\n\nThe best way to show how Critical Theory offers a distinctive\nphilosophical approach is to locate it historically in German Idealism\nand its aftermath. For Marx and his generation, Hegel was the last in\nthe grand tradition of philosophical thought able to give us secure\nknowledge of humanity and history on its own. The issue for Left\nHegelians and Marx was then somehow to overcome Hegelian\n“theoretical” philosophy, and Marx argues that it can do\nso only by making philosophy “practical,” in the sense of\nchanging practices by which societies realize their ideals. Once\nreason was thoroughly socialized and made historical, historicist\nskepticism emerged at the same time, attempting to relativize\nphilosophical claims about norms and reason to historically and\nculturally variable forms of life. Critical Theory developed a\nnonskeptical version of this conception, linking philosophy closely to\nthe human and social sciences. In so doing, it can link empirical and\ninterpretive social science to normative claims of truth, morality and\njustice, traditionally the purview of philosophy. While it defends the\nemphasis on normativity and universalist ambitions found in the\nphilosophical tradition, it does so within the context of particular\nsorts of empirical social research, with which it has to cooperate if\nit is to understand such normative claims within the current\nhistorical context.  After presenting the two main versions of this\nconception of philosophy, I turn to an illuminating example of how\nthis cooperative relation between philosophy and the social sciences\nworks from the point of view of the main figures in Critical Theory\nwho sought to develop it: the critique of ideology, a form of\ncriticism which if generalized threatens to undermine the critical\nstance itself as one more ideology. Even if Critical Theorists are\nunited in a common philosophical project, this example shows the large\ndifferences between the first and second generation concerning the\nnormative justification of social criticism. \n\nIn the modern era, philosophy defines its distinctive role in relation\nto the sciences. While for Locke philosophy was a mere\n“underlaborer,” for Kant it had a loftier status. As Rorty\nand others have put it, transcendental philosophy has two distinct\nroles: first, as the tribunal of Reason, the ultimate court of appeal\nbefore which disciplines stand and must justify themselves and\nsecondly, as the domain for normative questions left out of\nnaturalistic inquiry. In light of this ability to judge the results of\nthe sciences, philosophy can also organize knowledge, assigning to\neach of them their proper sphere and scope. The Kantian solution\ndenies the need for direct cooperation with the sciences on issues\nrelated to normativity, since these were determined independently\nthrough transcendental analysis of the universal and necessary\nconditions for reason in its theoretical and practical\nemployment. Echoes of the subsequent post-Hegelian criticisms of\nKantian transcendental philosophy are found in the early work of\nHorkheimer and Marcuse. Indeed, Horkheimer criticizes\n“traditional theory” in light of the rejection of its\nrepresentational view of knowledge and its nonhistorical subject.\nEchoing Marx in The German Ideology, Horkheimer insists that\nfor a critical theory the world and subjectivity in all its forms have\ndeveloped with the life processes of society (Horkheimer 1972b [1992,\n245]). Much like certain naturalists today, he argued that\n“materialism requires the unification of philosophy and\nscience,” thus denying any substantive distinction between\nscience and philosophy (Horkheimer 1993, 34). As Horkheimer understood\nthe task of Critical Theory, philosophical problems are preserved by\ntaking a role in defining problems for research, and philosophical\nreflection retains a privileged role in organizing the results of\nempirical research into a unified whole. \n\nThis understanding of the relation of philosophy and the sciences\nremains broadly Kantian. Even while rejecting the role of philosophy as\ntranscendental judge, he still endorses its normative role, to the\nextent that it still has the capacity to organize the claims of\nempirical forms of knowledge and to assign each a role in the normative\nenterprise of reflection on historically and socially contextualized\nreason. This unstable mixture of naturalism with a normative\nphilosophical orientation informed much of the critical social science\nof the Frankfurt School in the 1930s. \n\nAccording to this conception of materialism, Critical Theory could\noperate with a theoretical division of labor in which philosophy’s\nnormative stance could criticize the embodiments of reason and\nmorality according to their internal criteria. At least for modern\nsocieties, such an enterprise of “immanent critique” was\npossible (see, for example, Horkheimer 1993, 39). However, Horkheimer\nand Marcuse saw the skeptical and relativist stance of the emerging\nsociology of knowledge, particularly that of Karl Mannheim, as\nprecisely opposed to that of Critical Theory. As Marcuse puts it,\n“sociology that is only interested in the dependent and limited\nnature of consciousness has nothing to do with truth. While useful in\nmany ways it has falsified the interest and goal of any critical\ntheory” (Marcuse 1969 152). As opposed to merely debunking\ncriticism, “a critical theory is concerned with preventing the\nloss of truth that past knowledge has labored to attain.” Given\nCritical Theory’s orientation to human emancipation, it seeks to\ncontextualize philosophical claims to truth and moral universality\nwithout reducing them to social and historical conditions. Horkheimer\nformulates this skeptical fallacy that informed much of the\nsociologically informed relativism of his time in this way:\n“That all our thoughts, true or false, depend on conditions that\ncan change in no way affects the validity of science. It is not clear\nwhy the conditioned character of thought should affect the truth of a\njudgment—why shouldn’t insight be just as conditioned as\nerror?” (Horkheimer 1993, 141). The core claim here is that\nfallibilism is different from relativism, suggesting that it is\npossible to distinguish between truth and the context of justification\nof claims to truth. \n\nFaced with a sociological naturalism that relativized claims to\ntruth and justice are necessary for social criticism, the challenge\ncould be answered by detranscendentalizing truth without losing its\nnormativity (Horkheimer 1993, 6; McCarthy, in McCarthy and Hoy 1994,\n10). Indeed it is relativism that depends on an implausible and\nahistorical form of detachment and impartiality, especially expressed\nin its methodological commitments to “reverential empathy and\ndescription.” The skepticism offered by historicism and the sociology\nof knowledge is ultimately merely theoretical, the skepticism of an\nobserver who takes the disengaged view from nowhere. Once the skeptic\nhas to take up the practical stance, alternatives to such paper doubt\nbecome inevitable. Indeed, the critic must identify just whose\npractical stance best reveals these possibilities as agents for social\ntransformation of current circumstances. As I point out in the next\nsection, the Frankfurt School most often applied ideology critique to\nliberal individualism, pointing out its contextual limitations that\nlead to reductionist and pernicious interpretations of democratic\nideals. \n\nDespite the force of these antirelativist and antiskeptical\narguments, two problems emerge in claims made by Horkheimer and Marcuse\nto underwrite some “emphatic” conception of truth or justice.\nFirst, philosophy is given the task of organizing social research and\nproviding its practical aims even in the absence of the justification\nof its superior capacities. A more modest and thoroughly empirical\napproach would be more appropriate and defensible. Second, the source\nof this confidence seems to be practical, that critics must immanently\ndiscover those transformative agents whose struggles take up these\nnormative contents of philosophy and attempt to realize them. But once\nthis practical possibility no longer seems feasible, then this approach\nwould either be purely philosophical or it would turn against the\npotentialities of the present. Indeed, during the rise of fascism in\nthe Second World War and the commodified culture afterwards, the\nFrankfurt School became skeptical of the possibility of agency, as the\nsubjective conditions for social transformation were on their view\nundermined. \n\nIt is clear that in Dialectic of Enlightenment Horkheimer\nand Adorno abandoned this interdisciplinary materialist approach with\nits emphasis on cooperation with the social sciences (1982, xi). Adorno\nand Horkheimer did not to deny the achievements of the Enlightenment,\nbut rather wanted to show that it had “self-destructive\ntendencies,” that its specific social, cultural and conceptual forms\nrealized in modern Europe “contained its own possibility of a\nreversal that is universally apparent today” (Adorno and Horkheimer\n1982, xiii). Since Adorno and Horkheimer planned to offer a positive\nway out of the dialectic of Enlightenment at the time they wrote these\nwords, this reversal is by no means inevitable. Even if their specific\nhistorical story of the emergence of Enlightenment reason out of myth\nis no longer so convincing, it is not enough to say with Habermas that\nThe Dialectic of Enlightenment did not “do justice to\nthe rational content of cultural modernity” (Habermas 1987, 103). For\nthe positive task of avoiding the reversal of Enlightenment,\nreconstructing the rational content of modernity is not enough, since\nthe issue is not to affirm its universalism, but its self-critical and\nemancipatory capacity. If the issue is the self-correcting capacity of\nthe Enlightenment, two questions emerge: how is it undermined? Where do\nwe locate the exercise of this capacity? This is the\n“Enlightenment problem,” the solution to which is twofold: to\nreconstruct those human capacities that have such reflexivity built\ninto them and to tie the operation of Enlightenment institutions to the\nconditions of their successful exercise. \n\nAgainst this skeptical predicament of the first generation of Critical\nTheory, it could be said without exaggeration that Habermas’s basic\nphilosophical endeavor from Knowledge and Human Interests\nto The Theory of Communicative Action has been to develop a\nmore modest, fallibilist, empirical account of the philosophical claim\nto universality and rationality. This more modest approach rids\nCritical Theory of its vestiges of transcendental philosophy, pushing\nit in a naturalistic direction. Such naturalism identifies more\nspecific forms of social scientific knowledge that help in developing\nan analysis of the general conditions of rationality manifested in\nvarious human capacities and powers. Thus, Habermas’s alternative sees\npractical knowledge, or reason in the robust sense, as it is\n“embodied in cognition, speech and action” (Habermas 1984,\n10). Habermas’s calls for particular “reconstructive\nsciences,” whose aim it is to render theoretically explicit the\nintuitive, pretheoretical know-how underlying such basic human\ncompetences as speaking and understanding, judging, and acting. Unlike\nKant’s transcendental analysis of the conditions of rationality, such\nsciences yield knowledge that is not necessary but hypothetical, not a\npriori but empirical, not certain but fallible. They are nevertheless\ndirected to universal structures and conditions and raise universal,\nbut defeasible claims to an account of practical reason. In this way,\nHabermas undermines both of the traditional Kantian roles for\nphilosophy and brings them into a fully cooperative relation to the\nsocial sciences. This can be seen in the clear differences between his\naccount of the critique of ideology, which is at once contextualist\nand antirelativist but also underwrites its own normativity in ways\nthat Horkheimer and Marcuse’s more nearly transcendental account could\nnot, given the inevitable tension between philosophical ideals and the\nhistorical conditions of current societies and their practices. \n\nLike many other such theories, the theory of communicative action\noffers its own distinctive definition of rationality. In good\npragmatist fashion, Habermas’s definition is epistemic, practical, and\nintersubjective. For Habermas, rationality consists not so much in the\npossession of knowledge and thus primarily concerned with the\nconsistency and content of one’s beliefs, but rather in “how\nspeaking and acting subjects acquire and use knowledge” (Habermas,\n1984, 11). Such a broad definition suggests that the theory could be\ndeveloped through explicating the general and formal conditions of\nvalidity in knowing and reaching understanding through language, and\nthis task falls primarily on “formal pragmatics.” As one among\nmany different “reconstructive sciences,” such a reconstruction\nof speech is inherently normative, in the sense that it is one of the\ndisciplines that reconstructs a common domain: “the know-how of\nsubjects who are capable of speech and action, who are attributed the\ncapacity to produce valid utterances, and who consider themselves\ncapable of distinguishing (at least intuitively) between valid and\ninvalid expressions” (Habermas 1990, 31). The positive goal of such a\ntheory is not only to provide an account of rationality based on this\nknow-how that is rich enough to grasp uses of reason in all their\nvariety, yet also normative enough to be able to clarify the necessary\nconditions for its practical employment as well as a critical analysis\nof the “pathologies” that occur when these conditions fail to\nobtain. \n\nMore than just reconstructing an implicitly normative know-how,\nHabermas is clear that such reconstructive sciences have a\n“quasi-transcendental” status by specifying very general\nand formal conditions of successful communication. In this way, their\nconcern with normativity and with the abilities needed for rationality\nin Habermas’s practical and social sense permits them to acquire a\ncritical role. Certainly, the goal of the reconstructive sciences is\ntheoretical knowledge: they make such practical know-how explicit. But\ninsofar as they are capable of explicating the conditions for valid or\ncorrect utterances, they also explain why some utterances are invalid,\nsome speech acts unsuccessful, and some argumentation\ninadequate. Thus, such sciences “also explain deviant cases and\nthrough this indirect authority acquire a critical function\nas well” (Habermas, 1990, 32). This authority then permits the\ntheory of rationality to underwrite critical claims about social and\npolitical practices, to show how their functioning violates not only\nthe espoused rules but also the conditions of rationality. \n\nSuch an approach can be applied to normative features of democratic\npractices. Rather than only providing a set of explicit principles of\njustification and institutional decision rules, democracy is\nalso a particular structure of free and open communication.\nIdeology restricts or limits such processes of communication\nand undermines the conditions of success within them. Ideology as\ndistorted communication affects both the social conditions in which\ndemocratic discussion takes place and the processes of communication\nthat go on within them. The theory of ideology, therefore, analyzes the\nways in which linguistic-symbolic meanings are used to encode, produce,\nand reproduce relations of power and domination, even within\ninstitutional spheres of communication and interaction governed by\nnorms that make democratic ideals explicit in normative procedures and\nconstraints. As a reconstruction of the potentially correct insights\nbehind Marx’s exaggerated rejection of liberalism, the theory of\ndistorted communication is therefore especially suited to the ways in\nwhich meanings are used to reproduce power even under explicit rules of\nequality and freedom. This is not to say that explicit rules are\nunimportant: they make it possible for overt forms of coercion and\npower to be constrained, the illegitimacy of which requires no appeal\nto norms implicit in practices. \n\nDemocratic norms of freedom can be made explicit in various rights,\nincluding civil rights of participation and free expression. Such norms\nare often violated explicitly in exercises of power for various ends,\nsuch as wealth, security, or cultural survival. Besides these explicit\nrights, such coercion also violates the communicative freedom expressed\nin ignoring the need to pass decisions through the taking of yes/no\nattitudes by participants in communication. Habermas calls such speech\nthat is not dependent on these conditions of communicative rationality\n“distorted communication.” For example, powerful economic groups\nhave historically been able to attain their agency goals without\nexplicitly excluding topics from democratic discussion but by implied\nthreats and other nondeliberative means (Przworski and Wallerstein\n1988, 12–29; Bohman 1997, 338–339). Threats of declining investments\nblock redistributive schemes, so that credible threats circumvent the\nneed to convince others of the reasons for such policies or to put some\nissue under democratic control. Similarly, biases in agenda setting\nwithin organizations and institutions limit scope of deliberation and\nrestrict political communication by defining those topics that can be\nsuccessfully become the subject of public agreement (Bohman 1990). In\nthis way, it is easy to see how such a reconstructive approach connects\ndirectly to social scientific analyses of the consistency of democratic\nnorms with actual political behavior. \n\nThis theory of ideology as distorted communication opens up the\npossibility of a different relation of theoretical and practical\nknowledge than Habermas has suggested so far. His approach uses formal\npragmatics philosophically to reflect upon norms and practices that are\nalready explicit in justifications in various sorts of argumentation or\nsecond-order communication. Such reflection has genuine practical\nsignificance in yielding explicit rules governing discursive\ncommunication (such as rules of argumentation), which in turn can be\nused for the purpose of designing and reforming deliberative and\ndiscursive institutions (Habermas 1996, 230). It is easily overlooked\nthat such rules are only part of the story; they make explicit and\ninstitutionalize norms that are already operative in correct language\nuse. Such implicit norms of well-formed and communicatively successful\nutterances are not identical with the explicit rules of\nargumentation. \n\nThese claims about norms raise two difficulties. First, there is a\npotential regress of rules, that is, that explicit rules requires\nfurther rules to apply them, and so on. Second, this approach cannot\ncapture how norms are often only implicit in practices rather than\nexplicitly expressed (Brandom 1994, 18–30). Here Habermas sides with\nPettit in seeing the central function of explicit norms as creating a\ncommons that can serve as the basis for institutionalizing norms, a\nspace in which the content of norms and concepts can be put up for\nrational reflection and revision (Pettit 1992, Habermas 1990).  Making\nsuch implicit norms explicit is thus also the main task of the\ninterpretive social scientist and is a potential source of social\ncriticism; it is then the task of the participant-critic in the\ndemocratic public sphere to change them. There is one more possible\nrole for the philosophically informed social critic. As we have seen\nin the case of ideological speech, the reconstructive sciences\n“also explain deviant cases and through this indirect authority\nacquire a critical function as well” (Habermas, 1990,\n32). \n\nIn this section, I have discussed claims that are distinctive of the\nmetaphilosophy of Critical Theorists of both generations of the\nFrankfurt School and illustrated the ways in which critical normativity\ncan be exercised in their differing models of the critique of ideology.\nCritical Theorists attempt to fulfill potentially two desiderata at the\nsame time: first, they want to maintain the normativity of\nphilosophical conceptions such as truth or justice, while at the same\ntime they want to examine the contexts in which they have developed and\nmay best be promoted practically. I argued that the first generation\ntheorists avoided the relativism of sociologies of knowledge such as\nMannheim’s only to fall into a practical skepticism about the\nfeasibility of agents acting upon such norms in current contexts.\nHabermas’s conception of the cooperation between philosophy and the\nsocial sciences in rational reconstruction of practical knowledge\nallows him to articulate a normative conception of “real\ndemocracy” more fully and to develop a social scientifically informed\nconception of democracy that is an alternative to current liberal\npractices. This project shifts the goal of critical social inquiry from\nhuman emancipation as such, to the primary concern with democratic\ninstitutions as the location for the realization of ideals of freedom\nand equality. The limits on any such realization may prove to be not\nmerely ideological: Critical Theory is also interested in those social\nfacts and circumstances that constrain the realization of the ideal\ndemocracy and force us to reconsider its normative content. While such\nan account of the relation between facts and norms answers the\nsociological skepticism of Weber and others about the future of\ndemocracy, it may be based on an overly limited account of social\nfacts. \n\nIn its initial phases Critical Theory attempted to develop a normative\nnotion of “real democracy” that was contrasted with actual\npolitical forms in liberal societies. A democratic society would be\nrational, because in it individuals could gain “conscious\ncontrol” over social processes that affect them and their life\nchances.  To the extent that such an aim is possible at all, it\nrequired that human beings become “producers of their [social\nlife] in its totality” (Horkheimer 1972b [1992, 244]). Such a\nsociety then becomes a “true” or expressive totality,\novercoming the current “false totality,” an antagonistic\nwhole in which the genuine social needs and interests cannot be\nexpressed or developed (Jay 1984).  Such a positive, expressivist\nideal of a social whole is not, however, antiliberal, since it shares\nwith liberalism the commitment to rationalism and universalism. The\nnext phase in the development of Critical Theory took up the question\nof antidemocratic trends. This development of the Frankfurt School\ninterpretation of the limits on democracy as an ideal of human freedom\nwas greatly influenced by the emergence of fascism in the 1930s, one\nof the primary objects of their social research. Much of this research\nwas concerned with antidemocratic trends, including increasingly\ntighter connections between states and the market in advanced\ncapitalist societies, the emergence of the fascist state and the\nauthoritarian personality.  Horkheimer came to see that these\nantidemocratic trends gradually undermined the realization of an\nexpressive whole, with the consequence that “the situation of\nthe individual is hopeless,” that the subjective conditions for\nexercising freedom and achieving solidarity were being eroded by an\nincreasingly totalizing social reification. \n\nAs first generation Critical Theorists saw it in the 1940s, this\nprocess of reification occurs at two different levels. First, it\nconcerned a sophisticated analysis of the contrary psychological\nconditions underlying democracy and authoritarianism; second, this\nanalysis was linked to a social theory that produced an account of\nobjective, large-scale, and long-term historical processes of\nreification. If these facts and trends are true, then the idea of a\n“true totality” is a plausible critical category. However, this\nconcept is ill suited for democratic theory due to a lack of clarity\nwith regard to the underlying positive political ideal of Critical\nTheory. Finally, in reaction to these normative failures, Habermas\nseeks to develop an intermediate level of analysis and a new normative\nconception in the historical analysis of the emergence of the\n“public sphere” (Öffentlichkeit). As his later and\nmore fully developed normative theory of democracy based on\nmacrosociological social facts about modern societies shows, Habermas\noffers a modest and liberal democratic ideal based on the public use of\nreason within the empirical constraints of modern complexity and\ndifferentiation. This social theory may make it difficult for him to\nmaintain some aspects of radical democracy as an expressive and\nrational ideal that first generation critical theorists saw as a\ngenuine alternative to liberalism. \n\nExcept for passages on “real democracy” as the achievement\nof a rational society, many of the Frankfurt School’s writings on\ndemocracy are concerned with developing a critique of liberal ideology\nreminiscent of “The Jewish Question.” Horkheimer puts his\ncriticism of bourgeois negative liberty in these terms: “The\nlimited freedom of the bourgeois individual puts on the illusory form\nof perfect freedom and autonomy” (Horkheimer 1972b [1992,\n211]). Horkheimer criticizes the modern philosophical and legal subject\nas abstract, detached, and ahistorical; whatever freedom and autonomy\nactors have, they are best understood as “definite\nindividuals” whose freedom is exercised in relation others and\nin historically specific societies.  The freedom of real individuals\ncan only be thought of in a holistic way, “in the resultant web\nof relationships with the social totality and with nature.” Like\nall good ideology critiques, then, this criticism of liberalism is\nimmanent, using the liberal norms and values against their historical\nrealization in specific institutions.  Nonetheless, this ideology\ncritique recognized that liberalism was still, as Marcuse put it, a\n“rationalist theory of society.” Whatever its successor,\nthe new form would have to pass the normative tests that fascism and\nother emerging forms of antiliberalism do not: this new unity\n“would have to prove itself before the tribunal of individuals,\nto show that their needs and potentialities are realized within\nit” (Marcuse 1968, 7). Using Hegelian terminology, Critical\nTheorists came to regard advanced capitalist societies as a\n“totality,” in which the tight integration of states and\nmarkets threatened to eliminate the space for freedom. While the\nemergence of fascism is possible evidence for this fact, it is also an\nobvious instance in which reliance on the internal criticism of\nliberalism is no longer adequate. \n\nThe shift in the Frankfurt School to such external forms of\ncriticism from 1940 onwards is not confined to the fascist state. With\nthe development of capitalism in its monopoly form, the liberal\nheritage loses its rational potential as the political sphere\nincreasingly functionalized to the market and its reified social\nrelationships. In this way the critique of liberalism shifts away from\nthe normative underpinnings of current democratic practices to the ways\nin which the objective conditions of reification undermine the\npsychological and cultural presuppositions of democratic change and\nopposition. Such a society is now a “wholly false totality.” The\nwork of Adorno and Horkheimer in this period shows the philosophical\nconsequences of this shift, especially in Dialectic of\nEnlightenment (1944) and The Eclipse of Reason\n(1947). \n\nOne of the central claims of Dialectic of Enlightenment\nconcerns the “entwinement of myth and Enlightenment,” as\nproviding a deep historical treatment of the genesis of modern reason\nand freedom and how they turn into their opposites. Rather than being\nliberating and progressive, reason has become dominating and\ncontrolling with the spread of instrumental reason. Liberal\ninstitutions do not escape this process and are indeed part of it with\ntheir institutionalization of self-interest and self-preservation,\ntending toward a “totally administered society.” In Eclipse\nof Reason Horkheimer turns this critique of instrumental reason\nagainst liberal democracy. He argues that the liberal tradition that\nMarcuse argued needed to be preserved only retained its normative force\non the metaphysical foundation of “objective reason.” However\ngrounded, liberalism depended on subjectivizing reason and objective\nmoral principles; subjects are proclaimed “autonomous” all the\nwhile they sink into the heteronomy of market relations. The\n“inevitable” tendency of liberalism to collapse into fascism\n“can be derived, apart from any economic causes, from the inner\ncontradiction between the subjectivist principle of self-interest and\nthe idea of reason that it is supposed to express” (Horkheimer 1987,\n21). Shorn of its objective content, democracy is reduced to mere\nmajority rule and public opinion to some measurable quantity. The\nargument here is primarily genealogical (thus based on a story of\nhistorical origin and development) and not grounded in social science;\nit is a reconstruction of the history of Western reason or of\nliberalism in which calculative, instrumental reason drives out the\nutopian content of universal solidarity. Some nondominating,\nalternative conception is exhibited in Horkheimer’s religiously\ninfluenced ideal of identification with all suffering creatures or\nAdorno’s idea of mimetic reconciliation with the other found primarily\nin art (Horkheimer 1972a; Adorno 1973). These analyses were also\ncomplemented by an analysis of the emergence of state capitalism and of\nthe culture industry that replaces the need for consent and even the\npseudo-consent of ideology. \n\nSome of the more interesting social scientific analyses of fascism\nthat the Frankfurt School produced in this period were relatively\nindependent of such a genealogy of reason. The first is the analysis of\npolitical economy of advanced, administered capitalist societies, with\nFranz Neumann providing a dissenting view that no state can completely\ncontrol social and economic processes in the ways that might be more\nconsistent with Horkheimer and Adorno’s critique of instrumental\nreason. Especially interesting were empirical investigations into the\n“authoritarian” and “democratic” personalities, which\nprovided a microsociology of democratic and antidemocratic character\ntraits (Adorno et al. 1953). Perhaps one of more striking results of\nthis study is that the core of the democratic personality is a\nparticular emotional or affective organization: “if fear and\ndestructiveness are the major emotional sources of fascism, eros\nbelongs mainly to democracy” (Adorno et al 1953, 480). Thus, long-term\nhistorical cultural development and macro- and micro-sociological\ntrends work against the democratic ideal. The sources of resistance to\nthese trends are increasingly found at the level of what Foucault would\ncall “micropolitics.” \n\nWhatever the merits of such general historical frameworks for critical\ninterpretations of the present, the internal difficulty for a critical\ntheory is that “real democracy,” the goal of emancipatory\ncriticism, demands a richer set of practical and theoretical\nresources, including institutional possibilities. What was needed was\nan alternative conception of rationality that is not exhausted by the\ndecline of objective reason into subjective self-interest. This basic\nproblem of first generation Critical Theory has been the life-long\ntheme of the work of Jürgen Habermas, for whom the publicity and\nmore generally the public sphere (Öffentlichkeit),\noccupies precisely the right conceptual space. Habermas also replaces\nthe expressive totality of a fully democratic society with the ideal\nof “undamaged intersubjectivity” and of universal\nsolidarity established through “communication free from\ndomination.” On the social theoretical side, totality is\nreplaced by a conception of social complexity, which is not\nnecessarily false or reifying. These shifts permit a more positive\nreassessment of the liberal tradition and its existing political\ninstitutions and open up the possibility of a critical sociology of\nthe legitimation problems of the modern state. On the whole, Habermas\nmarked the return to normative theory united with a broader use of\nempirical, reconstructive and interpretive social science. Above all,\nthis version of Critical Theory required fully developing the\nalternative to instrumental reason, only sketched by Adorno or\nHorkheimer in religious and aesthetic form; for Habermas criticism is\ninstead grounded in everyday communicative action. Indeed, he cam to\nargue that the social theory of the first generation, with its\ncommitments to holism, could no long be reconciled with the historical\nstory at the core of Critical Theory: the possible emergence of a more\nrobust and genuine form of democracy \n\nHabermas’s rejection of the explanatory holism of the first generation\nof the Frankfurt School has both explanatory and normative\nimplications. First, he brings categories of meaning and agency back\ninto critical social theory, both of which were absent in the\nmacro-sociological and depth psychological approaches that were\nfavored in the post war period. This brings democratic potentials back\ninto view, since democracy makes sense only within specific forms of\ninteraction and association, from the public forum to various\npolitical institutions. Indeed, Habermas’s first and perhaps most\nenduring work, The Structural Transformation of the Public\nSphere (Habermas 1989/1961), traced the historical emergence of\nnew forms of public interaction from the intimate sphere of the\nfamily, to coffee houses, salons, and finally to parliamentary\ndebates.  While linked ultimately to a narrative of its decline\nthrough the market and the administrative state, the core of such\ninteraction and the critical and egalitarian potential of being part\nof a public whose members address one another as equals had for\nHabermas a nonideological, even “utopian” core (Habermas\n1989, 88). Second, Habermas also developed an alternative sociology of\nmodernity, in which social differentiation and pluralization are not\npathological but positive features of modern societies (Habermas 1982,\n1986). Indeed, the positive conception of complexity permits an\nanalysis of the ways in which modern societies and their functional\ndifferentiation opens up democratic forms of self-organization\nindependently of some possible expressively integrated totality. Such\nan ideal of an expressive totality and conscious self control over the\nproduction of the conditions of social life is replaced with publicity\nand mutual recognition within feasible discursive institutions. \n\nThis emphasis on the normative potential of modernity does not mean\nthat modern political forms such as the state are not to be criticized.\nIn Legitimation Crisis (1969), for example, Habermas argues\nnot only that the demands of advanced capitalism restrict the scope and\nsignificance of democracy, but also that the state is “crisis\nridden” and unable to solve structural problems of unemployment,\neconomic growth, and environmental destruction. These crisis tendencies\nopen up a space for contestation and deliberation by citizens and their\ninvolvement in new social movements. This criticism of the contemporary\nstate is put in the context of a larger account of the relation between\ndemocracy and rationality. Contrary to “formal” democracy\nunderstood as majority rule, Habermas opposes “substantive\ndemocracy,” which emphasizes the “genuine participation of\ncitizens in political will formation” (Habermas 1975, 32). The\nrelevant notion of rationality that can be applied to such a process is\nprocedural and discursive; it is developed in terms of the procedural\nproperties of communication necessary to make public will formation\nrational and thus for it to issue in a genuine rather than merely de\nfacto consensus. \n\nWith such an expansion of Kantian practical reason, democracy is now\ngrounded in the intersubjective structure of communication exhibited\nin the special form of reflective and reciprocal communication and\npublic testing of claims to validity that Habermas calls\n“discourse.” As communication about communication,\ndiscourse emerges in problematic situations in which new solutions\nmust be sought in order to continue social cooperation. Democratic\ninstitutions have the proper reflexive structure and are thus\ndiscursive in this sense. In them, citizens deliberate as free and\nequal persons, for whom the legitimacy of the decision is related to\nthe achievement of a “rational consensus.” That is, a\nconsensus is rational to the extent that it is based on a norm that\ncould under ideal conditions be justified to all those who are\naffected by a decision. Early on Habermas called the full list of\nthese counterfactual conditions “the ideal speech\nsituation,” although later it is clear that it is meant to\nprovide a principled basis by which to assess the quality of\nagreements reached discursively. \n\nOne philosophical purpose of such a procedural conception of\nrationality is to refute value skeptics, who reduce politics to what\nWeber called the struggle between “gods and demons” (Weber 1949).\nIts purpose in social theory is to provide the basis for an account of\ncultural rationalization and learning in modernity. In normative theory\nproper, Habermas has from the start been suspicious of attempts to\napply this fundamentally epistemological criterion of rationality\ndirectly to the structure of political institutions. As early as\nTheory and Practice (1966), Habermas distanced himself from\nRousseau’s claim that the general will can only be achieved in a\ndirect, republican form of democracy. By failing to see that the ideal\nagreement of the social contract specifies only a certain procedural\nand reflexive level of justification, Rousseau confused “the\nintroduction of a new principle of legitimacy with proposals for\ninstitutionalizing just rule” (Habermas 1979, 186). Indeed democratic\nprinciples need not be applied everywhere in the same way (Habermas\n1973, 32–40). Instead, the realization of such norms has to take into\naccount various social facts, including facts of pluralism and\ncomplexity (Habermas 1996, 474). For Habermas, no normative conception\nof democracy or law could be developed independently of a descriptively\nadequate model of contemporary society, lest it become a mere ought.\nWithout this empirical and descriptive component, democratic norms\nbecome merely empty ideals and not the reconstruction of the\nrationality inherent in actual practices. I shall return to the\nproblematic relation of social facts to democratic ideals in the next\nsection in discussing Habermas’s account of the philosophy of critical\nsocial science. \n\nAnother way in which this point about democratic legitimacy can be\nmade is to distinguish the various uses to which practical reason may\nbe put in various forms of discourse. Contrary to the account of\nlegitimacy offered in Legitimation Crisis, Habermas later\nexplicitly abandons the analogy between the justification of moral\nnorms and democratic decision-making. Moral discourses are clearly\nrestricted to questions of justice that can be settled impartially\nthrough a procedure of universalization (Habermas 1990, 43ff). The\nmoral point of view abstracts from the particular identities of\npersons, including their political identities, and encompasses an\nideally universal audience of all humanity. Although politics and law\ninclude moral concerns within their scope, such as issues of basic\nhuman rights, the scope of justification in such practices can be\nrestricted to the specific community of associated citizens and thus\nmay appeal to culturally specific values shared by the\nparticipants. \n\nThere are at least three aspects of practical reason relevant to\ndemocratic deliberation: pragmatic, ethical, and moral uses of reason\nare employed with different objects (pragmatic ends, the interpretation\nof common values, and the just resolution of conflicts) and thus also\ndifferent forms of validity (Habermas 1993, 1–18). Because of this\nvariety, democratic discourses are often mixed and complex, often\nincluding various asymmetries of knowledge and information. Democratic\ndeliberation is thus not a special case of moral judgment with all of\nits idealizing assumptions, but a complex discursive network with\nvarious sorts of argumentation, bargaining, and compromise (Habermas\n1996, 286). What regulates their use is a principle at a different\nlevel: the public use of practical reason is self-referential and\nrecursive in examining the conditions of its own employment. Given the\nsocial circumstances of large-scale and pluralistic modern societies,\ndistinctively democratic deliberation requires the “medium of\nlaw,” so that the results of deliberation must be expressed through\nlaw. \n\nHabermas expresses the relevant differences among the uses of\npractical reason in morality and politics as sub-principles of the\nsame principle of discursive justification, which he calls\n“D.” D simply names a discursive procedure:\n“just those norms of action are valid if all persons affected\ncould agree as participants in rational discourse” (Habermas\n1996, 107). The moral principle “U” specifies that the\nrule of argumentation for moral discourse is univeralizability\n(Habermas 1990, 65–66). The more specific principle of democracy\nstates that “only those laws may claim legitimacy that can meet\nwith the agreement of all citizens in a discursive lawmaking procedure\nthat is itself legally constituted” (Habermas 1996, 110). He\nargues that such a principle is at a different level than the moral\nprinciple, to the extent that its aim is primarily to establish a\ndiscursive procedure of legitimate law making and is a much weaker\nstandard of agreement. \n\nNonetheless, even this democratic principle may still be too\ndemanding, to the extent that it requires the agreement of all citizens\n(counterfactually) as a criterion of legitimacy. Habermas admits that\nin the case of cultural values we need not expect such agreement, and\nhe even introduces compromise as a possible discursive outcome of\ndemocratic procedures. One way to genuinely weaken the principle would\nbe to substitute cooperation for consensus and the outcome of the\nprocedure: “a law then would be legitimate only if it could be\nagreed to in a fair and open deliberative process in which all citizens\nmay freely continue to participate whatever the outcome” (Bohman 1996,\n89). In this way, what is crucial is not the agreement as such, but how\ncitizens reason together within a common public sphere. The democratic\nprinciple in this form expresses an ideal of citizenship rather than a\nstandard of liberal legitimacy . \n\nThe internal complexity of democratic discourse does not overcome\nthe problem of the application of the democratic principle to\ncontemporary social circumstances. As Habermas puts it,\n“unavoidable social complexity makes it necessary to apply the\ncriteria of democracy in a differentiated way” (Habermas 1996, 486).\nSuch complexity restricts the application of fully democratic\njustification for a number of reasons: first, it is not possible for\nthe sovereign will of the people by their democratic decision-making\npowers to constitute the whole of society; and, second, a society\nformed by merely associative and communicative means of coordination\nand cooperation is no longer possible. This objection to radical\ndemocracy is thus directed to those theories that do not figure out how\nsuch principles can be institutionally mediated given current social\nfacts. Indeed, institutional mediation can overcome deficits in\ncommunicative self-organization, in so far as they compensate for\n“the cognitive indeterminacy, motivational insecurity, and the\nlimiting coordinating power of moral norms and informal norms of action\nin general” (Habermas 1996, 323). \n\nThis approach to law has important consequences for a critical theory,\nsince it changes how we appeal to democratic norms in criticizing\ncurrent institutions: it is not clear exactly what the difference is\nbetween a radical and a liberal democracy, since some of the\nlimitations on participation are due to the constraints of social\nfacts and not to power asymmetries. By insisting upon popular\nsovereignty as the outcome of the generation of “communicative\npower” in the public sphere, Habermas tries to save the\nsubstance of radical democracy. The unresolved difficulty is that in a\ncomplex society, as Habermas asserts, “public opinion does not\nrule” but rather points administrative power in particular\ndirections; or, as he puts it, it does not “steer” but\n“countersteers” institutional complexity (Habermas 1996,\nchapter 8). That is, members of the public do not control social\nprocesses; qua members of a public, they may exercise influence\nthrough particular institutionalized mechanisms and channels of\ncommunication. \n\nThe open question for current Critical Theory (although not all\ncritical theories) is then whether or not “real democracy” is\nstill the goal of social criticism given these putatively\n“unavoidable” facts about the structure of modern society. Even\ngiven the limits of social complexity, there is still room for\njudgments of greater or lesser democracy, particularly with regard to\nthe democratic value of freedom from domination. For example, a\ncritical theory of globalization could show that the democratic\npotential of modern societies is being undermined by neoliberal\nglobalization and denationalization of economic policy. Such a theory\nsees the solution here to be the achievement of more democracy at the\ninternational level. It is also possible that the critical use of\ndemocratic concepts may require reconceptualizing the democratic theory\nthat has informed much of Enlightenment criticism in European\nsocieties. Here critical theorists are then simply one sort of\nparticipant in the ongoing internal work of redefining the democratic\nideal, not simply in showing the lack of its full realization. \n\nEither way, radical democracy may no longer be the only means to\nsocial transformation, and indeed we may, with Marcuse, think that\npreserving the truths of the past, such as democratic constitutional\nachievements, to be as important as imagining a new future. Given the\nnew situation, Critical Theory could now return to empirical social\ninquiry to discover new potentials for improving democracy, especially\nin understanding how it may increase the scope and effectiveness of\npublic deliberation. In these various roles, critical theorists are\nparticipants in the democratic public sphere. One of the main\ncontinuing legacies of Critical Theory has been to see that democracy\nis “the unfinished project of modernity” (Habermas 1986, xi) and\nits further realization and transformation a genuine goal even in\ncomplex and globalizing societies. To do so would entail a different,\nperhaps more reflexive notion of critical social inquiry, in which\ndemocracy is not only the object of study but is itself understood as a\nform of social inquiry. Critical Theory would then have to change its\nconception of what makes it practical and democratic. \n\nIn the next two sections, I will discuss two aspects of this\ntransformed conception of Critical Theory. First, I turn to the role of\nsocial theory in this more pragmatic account of critical social\ninquiry. Contrary to its origins in Marxian theoretical realism, I\nargue for methodological and theoretical pluralism as the best form of\npractical social science aimed at human emancipation. Second, I\nillustrate this conception in developing the outlines of a critical\ntheory of globalization, in which greater democracy and nondomination\nare its goals. This theory also has a normative side, which is inquiry\ninto democracy itself outside of its familiar social container of the\nnation state. In this sense, it attempts not just to show constraints\nbut also open possibilities. Critical Theorists have failed not only to\ntake up the challenge of such new social circumstances but also thereby\nto reformulate democratic ideals in novel ways. I shift first to the\nunderstanding of the philosophy of social science that would help in\nthis rearticulation of Critical Theory as critical social inquiry as a\npractical and normative enterprise. \n\nSuch a practical account of social inquiry has much in common with\npragmatism, old and new (Bohman 1999a, 1999b). As with pragmatism,\nCritical Theory came gradually to reject the demand for a scientific or\nobjective basis of criticism grounded in a grand theory. This demand\nproved hard to square with the demands of social criticism directed to\nparticular audiences at particular times with their own distinct\ndemands and needs for liberation or emancipation. The first step was to\nmove the critical social scientist away from seeking a single unifying\ntheory to employing many theories in diverse historical situations.\nRather, it is better to start with agents’ own pretheoretical knowledge\nand self-understandings. The issue for critical social inquiry is not\nonly how to relate pretheoretical and theoretical knowledge of the\nsocial world, but also how to move among different irreducible\nperspectives. The second step is to show that such a practical\nalternative not only provides the basis for robust social criticism,\nbut also that it better accounts for and makes use of the pluralism\ninherent in various methods and theories of social inquiry. While it is\nfar from clear that all critical theorists understand themselves in\nthis way, most agree that only a practical form of critical inquiry can\nmeet the epistemic and normative challenges of social criticism and\nthus provide an adequate philosophical basis fulfilling the goals of a\ncritical theory. \n\nThe philosophical problem that emerges in critical social inquiry is\nto identify precisely those features of its theories, methods, and\nnorms that are sufficient to underwrite social criticism. A closer\nexamination of paradigmatic works across the whole tradition from\nMarx’s Capital (1871) to the Frankfurt School’s Studies in\nAuthority and the Family (1939) and Habermas’s Theory of\nCommunicative Action (1982) reveals neither some distinctive form\nof explanation nor a special methodology that provides the necessary\nand sufficient conditions for such inquiry. Rather, the best such works\nemploy a variety of methods and styles of explanation and are often\ninterdisciplinary in their mode of research. What then gives them their\ncommon orientation and makes them all works of critical social\nscience? \n\nThere are two common, general answers to the question of what\ndefines these distinctive features of critical social inquiry: one\npractical and the other theoretical. The latter claims that critical\nsocial inquiry ought to employ a distinctive theory that unifies such\ndiverse approaches and explanations. On this view, Critical Theory\nconstitutes a comprehensive social theory that will unify the social\nsciences and underwrite the superiority of the critic. The first\ngeneration of Frankfurt School Critical Theory sought such a theory in\nvain before dropping claims to social science as central to their\nprogram in the late 1940s (Wiggershaus 1994). By contrast, according to\nthe practical approach, theories are distinguished by the form of\npolitics in which they can be embedded and the method of verification\nthat this politics entails. But to claim that critical social science\nis best unified practically and politically rather than theoretically\nor epistemically is not to reduce it simply to democratic politics. It\nbecomes rather the mode of inquiry that participants may adopt in their\nsocial relations to others. The latter approach has been developed by\nHabermas and is now favored by Critical Theorists. \n\nBefore turning to such a practical interpretation of critical social\ninquiry, it is first necessary to consider why the theoretical approach\nwas favored for so long and by so many Critical Theorists. First, it\nhas been long held that only a comprehensive social theory could unify\ncritical social science and thus underwrite a “scientific” basis\nfor criticism that goes beyond the limits of lay knowledge. Second, not\nonly must the epistemic basis of criticism be independent of agents’\npractical knowledge, but it might also be claimed that the correctness\nof any explanation is independent of its desirable or undesirable\npolitical effects on a specific audience. So conceived, social\ncriticism is then a two-stage affair: first, inquirers independently\ndiscover the best explanation using the available comprehensive theory;\nthen, second, they persuasively communicate its critical consequences\nto participants who may have false beliefs about their practices. \n\nStarting with Marx’s historical materialism, large-scale\nmacrosociological and historical theories have long been held to be the\nmost appropriate explanatory basis for critical social science.\nHowever, one problem is that comprehensiveness does not ensure\nexplanatory power. Indeed, there are many such large-scale theories,\neach with its own distinctive and exemplary social phenomena that guide\nan attempt at unification. A second problem is that a close examination\nof standard critical explanations, such as the theory of ideology,\nshows that they typically appeal to a variety of different social\ntheories (Bohman 1999b). Habermas’s actual employment of critical\nexplanations bears this out. His criticism of modern societies turns on\nthe explanation of the relationship between two very different\ntheoretical terms: a micro-theory of rationality based on communicative\ncoordination and a macro-theory of the systemic integration of modern\nsocieties in such mechanisms as the market (Habermas 1987). \n\nNot only does the idea of a comprehensive theory presuppose that there\nis one preferred mode of critical explanation, it also presupposes\nthat there is one preferred goal of social criticism, a socialist\nsociety that fulfills the norm of human emancipation. Only with such a\ngoal in the background does the two-step process of employing\nhistorical materialism to establish an epistemically and normatively\nindependent stance make sense. The validity of social criticism does\nnot merely depend on its being accepted or rejected by those to whom\nit is addressed. Pluralistic inquiry suggests a different norm of\ncorrectness: that criticism must be verified by those participating in\nthe practice and that this demand for practical verification is part\nof the process of inquiry itself. \n\nDespite his ambivalence between theoretical and practical pluralism,\nHabermas has given good reasons to accept the practical and pluralist\napproach. Just as in the analysis of modes of inquiry tied to distinct\nknowledge-constitutive interests, Habermas accepts that various\ntheories and methods each have “a relative legitimacy.” Indeed,\nlike Dewey he goes so far as to argue that the logic of social\nexplanation is pluralistic and elides the “apparatus of general\ntheories.” In the absence of any such general theories, the most\nfruitful approach to social scientific knowledge is to bring all the\nvarious methods and theories into relation to each other:\n“Whereas the natural and the cultural or hermeneutic sciences are\ncapable of living in mutually indifferent, albeit more hostile than\npeaceful coexistence, the social sciences must bear the tension of\ndivergent approaches under one roof …” (Habermas 1988, 3). In\nThe Theory of Communicative Action, Habermas casts critical\nsocial theory in a similar pluralistic, yet unifying way. In discussing\nvarious accounts of societal modernization, for example, Habermas\nargues that the main existing theories have their own “particular\nlegitimacy” as developed lines of empirical research, and that Critical\nTheory takes on the task of critically unifying the various theories\nand their heterogeneous methods and presuppositions. “Critical\nTheory does not relate to established lines of research as a\ncompetitor; rather, starting from its concept of the rise of modern\nsocieties, it attempts to explain the specific limitations and relative\nrights of those approaches” (Habermas 1987, 375). \n\nThis tension between unity and plurality leads in two different\ndirections, one practical and the other theoretical. What might be\ncalled the “Kantian” approach proceeds case by case, seeing the\nway in which these theories run up against their limits in trying to\nextend beyond the core phenomena of their domain of validity (Bohman\n1991, chapter 2). This approach is not theoretical in orientation, but\nmore akin to “social science with a practical intent” to use\nHabermas’s older vocabulary (Habermas 1971). The “Kantian” answer\nis given sharpest formulation by Weber in his philosophy of social\nscience. While recognizing the hybrid nature of social science as\ncausal and interpretive, he sought explanations of particular phenomena\nthat united both dimensions. For example, in his Protestant Ethic\nand the Spirit of Capitalism he brought the macroanalysis of\ninstitutional structures together with the micro-analysis of economic\nrationality and religious belief (Weber 1958). According to this\ncontrasting approach, “the relative rights and specific\nlimitations” of each theory and method are recognized by assigning them\nto their own particular (and hence limited) empirical domain rather\nthan establishing these judgments of scope and domain through a more\ncomprehensive theory that encompasses all others. \n\nThe second approach may be termed “Hegelian.” Here theorists\nseek to unify social scientific knowledge in broad comprehensive\ntheories that produce a general history of modern societies. But\ngeneral theories provide “general interpretive frameworks” on\nwhich it is possible to construct “critical histories of the\npresent” (McCarthy in Hoy and McCarthy 1994, 229–230). Even this\naccount of a comprehensive theory hardly eliminates competing histories\nthat bring together different theories and methods. Rather than aiming\nat a single best history, “Hegelian” theories of this sort are\nseen as practical proposals whose critical purchase is seen in offering\na comprehensive interpretation of the present situation. They do not\nrely on the criteria of a theory of rationality often appealed to in\nthe Kantian approach, but still seem to justify particular moral\nclaims, such as claims concerning justice and injustice. \n\nHabermas wants to straddle the divide between the Kantian and the\nHegelian approaches in his social theory of modernity. Why not see\nHabermas’s theory of rationality as providing both a theoretical and\npractical basis for Critical Theory? Certainly, this is how Habermas\nsees the purpose of such a theory (Habermas 1984, chapter 1). Yet even\nif this theory of rationality has to be understood in this way, it\nwould still have to avoid what Rorty calls “the ambiguity of\nrationality,” between its statuses as “a cognitive faculty and a\nmoral virtue.” For this reason, Rorty keeps them distinct. “The\nepistemological notion of rationality concerns our relation to\nsomething nonhuman, whereas the moral notion concerns our relations to\nour fellow human beings” (Rorty 1996, 74). In a way similar to recent\narguments in Putnam, Habermas now more strongly distinguishes between\nclaims to truth and the context of justification in which they are\nmade, even as he also wants to reject moral realism. \n\nThe problem for the practical conception of critical social inquiry\nis then to escape the horns of a dilemma: it should be neither purely\nepistemic and thus overly cognitivist, nor purely moralistic. Neither\nprovides sufficient critical purchase. In the case of the observer,\nthere is too much distance, so much so that it is hard to see how the\ntheory can motivate criticism; in the case of the pure participant\nperspective, there is too little distance to motivate or justify any\ncriticism at all. It is also the same general theoretical and\nmethodological dilemma that characterizes the debates between\nnaturalist and anti-naturalist approaches. While the former sees terms\nsuch as rationality as explanans to explain away such phenomena as\nnorms, the latter argues that normative terms are not so reducible and\nthus figure in both explanans and explanandum. The best practical\naccount here reconciles Rorty’s ambiguity by putting the\nepistemological component in the social world, in our various cognitive\nperspectives towards it that include the normative perspectives of\nothers. The ambiguity is then the practical problem of adopting\ndifferent points of view, something that reflective participants in\nself-critical practices must already be able to do by virtue of their\ncompetence. \n\nThis shift to “perspective taking” is already implicit in the\nreflexivity of practical forms of Critical Theory. Rather than look for\nthe universal and necessary features of social scientific knowledge,\nCritical Theory has instead focused on the social relationships between\ninquirers and other actors in the social sciences. Such relationships\ncan be specified epistemically in terms of the perspective taken by the\ninquirer on the actors who figure in their explanations or\ninterpretations. Seen in this way, the two dominant and opposed\napproaches to social science adopt quite different perspectives. On the\none hand, naturalism gives priority to the third-person or explanatory\nperspective; on the other hand, the anti-reductionism of interpretive\nsocial science argues for the priority of first- and second-person\nunderstanding and so for an essential methodological dualism. Critical\nTheory since Horkheimer has long attempted to offer an alternative to\nboth views. \n\nHabermas and other Critical Theorists rightly call\n“technocratic” any social inquiry that only develops optimal\nproblem-solving strategies in light of purely third-person knowledge of\nthe impersonal consequences of all available courses of action.\nPragmatists from Mead to Dewey offer similar criticisms (Habermas 1971,\n1973; Dewey 1927b). This conception of practical knowledge would model\nthe role of the social scientist in politics on the engineer, who\nmasterfully chooses the optimal solution to a problem of design. For\nthe social scientist qua an ideally rational and informed\nactor, “the range of permissible solutions is clearly delimited,\nthe relevant probabilities and utilities precisely specified, and even\nthe criteria of rationality to be employed (e.g., maximization of\nexpected utilities) is clearly stated” (Hempel 1965, 481). This\ntechnocratic model of the social scientist as detached observer (rather\nthan reflective participant) always needs to be contextualized in the\nsocial relationships it constitutes as a form of socially distributed\npractical knowledge. \n\nBy contrast with the engineering model, interpretive social science\ntakes up the first-person perspective in making explicit the\nmeaningfulness of an action or expression. Interpretations as practical\nknowledge are not based on some general theory (no matter how helpful\nor explanatory these may be when interpretation is difficult), but\nreconstruct agent’s own reasons, or at least how these reasons might\nseem to be good ones from a first-person perspective. This leaves an\ninterpreter in a peculiar epistemic predicament: what started as the\nenterprise of seeing things from others’ points of view can at best\nprovide the best interpretation for us of how things are\nfor them. As a matter of interpretive responsibility, there\nis no getting around the fact that ethnography or history is our\nattempt “to see another form of life in the categories of our\nown” (Geertz 1971, 16–17; Bohman 1991, 132). The only way out of\nthis problem is to see that there is more than one form of practical\nknowledge. \n\nNaturalistic and hermeneutic approaches see the relationship of the\nsubject and object of inquiry as forcing the social scientist to take\neither the third-person or first-person perspective. However, critical\nsocial science necessarily requires complex perspective taking and the\ncoordination of various points of view, minimally that of social\nscientists with the subjects under study. The “second-person\nperspective” differs from both third-person observer and the\nfirst-person participant perspectives in its specific form of practical\nknowledge. It employs the know-how of a participant in dialogue or\ncommunication (Bohman 2000). This perspective provides the alternative\nto opposing perspectives especially when our first-person knowledge or\nthird-person theories get it wrong. When faced with interpreting\nothers’ behavior we quickly run into the limits of first-person\nknowledge simpliciter. Third-person accounts face the same\n“gerrymandering problem” as made clear in the private language\nargument (Brandom 1994, 28ff). Neither the interpreter’s nor the\nobserver’s perspectives are sufficient to specify these opaque\nintentional contexts for others. For social scientists as well as\nparticipants in practices more generally, the adjudication of such\nconflicts requires mutual perspective taking, which is its own mode of\npractical reasoning. \n\nTheories of many different sorts locate interpretation as a\npractice, that is, in acts and processes of ongoing communication.\nCommunication is seen from this perspective as the exercise of a\ndistinctive form of practical rationality. A critical theory of\ncommunicative action offers its own distinctive definition of\nrationality, one that is epistemic, practical, and intersubjective. For\nHabermas, for example, rationality consists not so much in the\npossession of particular knowledge, but rather in “how speaking\nand acting subjects acquire and use knowledge” (Habermas 1984, 11). Any\nsuch account is “pragmatic” because it shares a number of\ndistinctive features with other views that see interpreters as\ncompetent and knowledgeable agents. Most importantly, a pragmatic\napproach develops an account of practical knowledge in the\n“performative attitude,” that is, from the point of view of a\ncompetent speaker. A theory of rationality can be a reconstruction of\nthe practical knowledge necessary for establishing social\nrelationships. This reconstruction is essential to understanding the\ncommitments of the reflective participant, including the critic. \n\nThere are two general arguments for a theory that assumes the\nirreducibility of such a perspective. The first is that interpreting is\nnot merely describing something. Rather, it establishes commitments and\nentitlements between the interpreter and the one interpreted. Second,\nin doing so the interpreter takes up particular normative\nattitudes. These “normative attitudes” must be those of the\ninterpreted. In interpreting one is not just reporting, but rather\nexpressing and establishing one’s attitude toward a claim, such as when\nthe interpreter takes the interpreted to say something to be true, or\nto perform an act that is appropriate according to social norms. Some\nsuch attitudes are essentially two-person attitudes: the interpreter\ndoes not just express an attitude in the first-person perspective\nalone, but rather incurs a commitment or obligation to others by\ninterpreting what others are doing (Brandom 1994, 79). To offer an\ninterpretation that is accepted is to make explicit the operative\nsocial norms and thus to establish the normative terms of a social\nrelationship. \n\nThe critical attitude shares with the interpretive stance a\nstructure derived from the second-person perspective. Here an agent’s\nbeliefs, attitudes, and practices cannot only be interpreted as\nmeaningful or not, but must also be assessed as correct, incorrect, or\ninconclusive. Nonetheless, the second-person perspective is not yet\nsufficient for criticism. In order for an act of criticism itself to be\nassessed as correct or incorrect, it must often resort to tests from\nthe first- and third-person perspectives as well. The reflective\nparticipant must take up all stances; she assumes no single normative\nattitude as proper for all critical inquiry. Only such an\n“interperspectival” stance is fully dialogical, giving the\ninquirer and agent equal standing. If indeed all cooperative social\nactivities “involve a moment of inquiry” (Putnam 1994, 174), then\nthey also need a moment of self-reflection on the assumptions of such\ninquiry itself. It is this type of reflection that calls for a\ndistinctively practical form of critical perspective taking. If\ncritical social inquiry is inquiry into the basis of cooperative\npractices as such, it takes practical inquiry one reflective step\nfurther. The inquirer does not carry out this step alone, but rather\nwith the public whom the inquirer addresses. As in Kuhn’s distinction\nbetween normal and revolutionary science, second-order critical\nreflection considers whether or not the framework for cooperation\nitself needs to be changed, thus whether new terms of cooperation are\nnecessary to solve problems. \n\nVarious perspectives for inquiry are appropriate in different\ncritical situations. If it is to identify all the problems with\ncooperative practices of inquiry, it must be able to occupy and account\nfor a variety of perspectives. Only then will it enable public\nreflection among free and equal participants. Such problems have\nemerged for example in the practices of inquiry surrounding the\ntreatment of AIDS. The continued spread of the epidemic and lack of\neffective treatments brought about a crisis in expert authority, an\n“existential problematic situation” in Dewey’s sense (Dewey 1938,\n492). By defining expert activity through its social consequences and\nby making explicit the terms of social cooperation between researchers\nand patients, lay participants reshape the practices of gaining medical\nknowledge and authority (Epstein 1996, Part II). The affected public\nchanged the normative terms of cooperation and inquiry in this area in\norder that institutions could engage in acceptable first-order problem\nsolving. If expertise is to be brought under democratic control,\nreflective inquiry into scientific practices and their operative norms\nis necessary (Bohman 1999a). This public challenge to the norms on\nwhich expert authority is based may be generalized to all forms of\nresearch in cooperative activity. It suggests the transformation of\nsome of the epistemological problems of the social sciences into the\npractical question of how to make their forms of inquiry and research\nopen to public testing and public accountability. This demand also\nmeans that some sort of “practical verification” of critical\nsocial inquiry is necessary. \n\nA practical approach to Critical Theory responds to pluralism in the\nsocial sciences in two ways, once again embracing and reconciling both\nsides of the traditional opposition between epistemic (explanatory) and\nnon-epistemic (interpretive) approaches to normative claims. On the one\nhand, it affirms the need for general theories, while weakening the\nstrong epistemic claims made for them in underwriting criticism. On the\nother hand, it situates the critical inquirer in the pragmatic\nsituation of communication, seeing the critic as making a strong claim\nfor the truth or rightness of his critical analysis. This is a\npresupposition of the critic’s discourse, without which it would make\nno sense to engage in criticism of others. \n\nA good test case for the practical and pluralist conception of\nCritical Theory based on perspective taking would be to give a more\nprecise account of the role of general theories and social scientific\nmethods in social criticism, including moral theories or theories of\nnorms. Rather than serving a justifying role in criticisms for their\ntransperspectival comprehensiveness, theories are better seen as\ninterpretations that are validated by the extent to which they open up\nnew possibilities of action that are themselves to be verified in\ndemocratic inquiry. Not only that, but every such theory is itself\nformulated from within a particular perspective. General theories are\nthen best seen as practical proposals whose critical purchase is not\nmoral and epistemic independence but practical and public testing\naccording to criteria of interpretive adequacy. This means that it is\nnot the theoretical or interpretive framework that is decisive, but the\npractical ability in employing such frameworks to cross various\nperspectives in acts of social criticism. In the above example, it is\naccomplished in taking the patients’ perspectives seriously in altering\npractices of medical inquiry into AIDS. \n\nWhy is this practical dimension decisive for democratizing\nscientific authority? There seems to be an indefinite number of\nperspectives from which to formulate possible general histories of the\npresent. Merely to identify a number of different methods and a number\nof different theories connected with a variety of different purposes\nand interests leaves the social scientist in a rather hopeless\nepistemological dilemma. Either the choice among theories,\nmethods, and interests seems utterly arbitrary, or the\nCritical Theorist has some special epistemic claim to survey the domain\nand make the proper choice for the right reason. The skeptical horn of\nthe dilemma is embraced by “new pragmatists” like Richard Rorty\n(Rorty 1991) and Max Weber (1949) alike, who see all such knowledge as\npurpose-relative. The latter, perhaps Hegelian horn demands objectivist\nclaims for social science generally and for the epistemic superiority\nof the Critical Theorist in particular--claims that Habermas and other\nCritical Theorists have been at pains to reject (Weber 1949; Habermas\n1973, 38). Is there any way out of the epistemic dilemma of pluralism\nthat would preserve the possibility of criticism without endorsing\nepistemic superiority? \n\nThe way out of this dilemma has already been indicated by a\nreflexive emphasis on the social context of critical inquiry and the\npractical character of social knowledge it employs. It addresses the\nsubjects of inquiry as equal reflective participants, as knowledgeable\nsocial agents. In this way, the asymmetries of the context of technical\ncontrol are suspended; this means that critical social inquiry must be\njudged by a different set of practical consequences, appealing to an\nincrease in the “reflective knowledge” that agents already\npossess to a greater or lesser degree. As agents in the social world\nthemselves, social scientists participate in the creation of the\ncontexts in which their theories are publicly verified. The goal of\ncritical inquiry is then not to control social processes or even to\ninfluence the decisions that agents might make in any determinate sort\nof way. Instead, its goal is to initiate public processes of\nself-reflection (Habermas, 1971, 40–41). Such a process of deliberation\nis not guaranteed success in virtue of some comprehensive theory.\nRather, the critic seeks to promote just those conditions of democracy\nthat make it the best available process upon the adequate reflection of\nall those affected. This would include reflection of the democratic\nprocess itself. When understood as solely dependent upon the\nsuperiority of theoretical knowledge, the critic has no foothold in the\nsocial world and no way to choose among the many competing approaches\nand methods. The publicity of a process of practical verification\nentails its own particular standards of critical success or failure\nthat are related to social criticism as an act of interpretation\naddressed to those who are being criticized. An account of such\nstandards then has to be developed in terms of the sort of abilities\nand competences that successful critics exhibit in their criticism.\nOnce more this reveals a dimension of pluralism in the social sciences:\nthe pluralism of social perspectives. As addressed to others in a\npublic by a speaker as a reflective participant in a practice,\ncriticism certainly entails the ability to take up the normative\nattitudes of multiple pragmatic perspectives in the communication in\nwhich acts of criticism are embedded. \n\nIf the argument of the last section is correct, a pragmatic account\nis inevitably methodologically, theoretically, and perspectivally\npluralistic. Any kind of social scientific method or\nexplanation-producing theory can be potentially critical. There are no\nspecific or definitive social scientific methods of criticism or\ntheories that uniquely justify the critical perspective. One reason for\nthis is that there is no unique critical perspective, nor should there\nbe one for a reflexive theory that provides a social scientific account\nof acts of social criticism and their conditions of pragmatic\nsuccess. \n\nThe standard ideas of ideology critique exhibit the problems with a\nsolely third-person model of criticism dependent on some idea of the\ntheorists being able to discern the “real interests” of\nparticipants (Geuss 1981). Rather than claiming objectivity in a\ntransperspectival sense, most practically oriented Critical Theorists\nhave always insisted that their form of social inquiry takes a\n“dual perspective” (Habermas 1996, chapter 1; Bohman 1991,\nchapter 4). This dual perspective has been expressed in many different\nways. Critical Theorists have always insisted that critical approaches\nhave dual methods and aims: they are both explanatory and normative at\nthe same time, adequate both as empirical descriptions of the social\ncontext and as practical proposals for social change. This dual\nperspective has been consistently maintained by Critical Theorists in\ntheir debates about social scientific knowledge, whether it is with\nregard to the positivism dispute, universal hermeneutics, or micro- or\nmacro-sociological explanations. \n\nIn the dispute about positivist social science, Critical Theorists\nrejected all forms of reductionism and insisted on the explanatory role\nof practical reason. In disputes about interpretation, Critical\nTheorists have insisted that social science not make a forced choice\nbetween explanation and understanding. Even if social scientists can\nonly gain epistemic access to social reality through interpretation,\nthey cannot merely repeat what agents know practically in their\n“explanatory understanding.” Here we might think of explanations\nthat create micro- and macro linkages, as between intentional actions\npursued by actors for their own purposes and their unintended effects\ndue to interdependencies of various sorts. Such dual perspective\nexplanations and criticism both allow the reflective distance of\ncriticism and the possibility of mediating the epistemic gap between\nthe participants’ more internal and the critics’ more external point of\nview. Given the rich diversity of possible explanations and stances,\ncontemporary social science has developed a variety of possible ways to\nenhance critical perspective taking. \n\nSuch a dual perspective provides a more modest conception of\nobjectivity: it is neither transperspectival objectivity nor a\ntheoretical metaperspective, but always operates across the range of\npossible practical perspectives that knowledgeable and reflective\nsocial agents are capable of taking up and employing practically in\ntheir social activity. It is achieved in various combinations of\navailable explanations and interpretive stances. With respect to\ndiverse social phenomena at many different levels, critical social\ninquiry has employed various explanations and explanatory strategies.\nMarx’s historical social theory permitted him to relate functional\nexplanations of the instability of profit-maximizing capitalism to the\nfirst-person experiences of workers. In detailed historical analyses,\nfeminist and ethnomethodological studies of the history of science have\nbeen able to show the contingency of normative practices (Epstein 1996;\nLongino 1990). They have also adopted various interpretive stances.\nFeminists have shown how supposedly neutral or impartial norms have\nbuilt-in biases that limit their putatively universal character with\nrespect to race, gender, and disability (Mills 1997; Minnow 1990, Young\n2002). In all these cases, claims to scientific objectivity or moral\nneutrality are exposed by showing how they fail to pass the test of\npublic verification by showing how the contours of their experiences do\nnot fit the self-understanding of institutional standards of justice\n(Mills 1997; Mansbridge 1991). Such criticism requires holding both\none’s own experience and the normative self-understanding of the\ntradition or institution together at the same time, in order to expose\nbias or cognitive dissonance. It uses expressions of vivid first-person\nexperiences to bring about cross-perspectival insights in actors who\ncould not otherwise see the limits of their cognitive and communicative\nactivities. \n\nIn these cases, why is it so important to cross perspectives? Here\nthe second-person perspective has a special and self-reflexive status\nfor criticism. Consider the act of crossing from the first-person\nplural or “we perspective” to the second-person perspective in\ntwo reflexive practices: science and democracy. In the case of science\nthe community of experts operates according to the norm of objectivity,\nthe purpose of which is to guide scientific inquiry and justify its\nclaims to communal epistemic authority. The biases inherent in these\noperative norms have been unmasked in various critical science studies\nand by many social movements. For Longino, such criticism suggests the\nneed for a better norm of objectivity, “measured against the\ncognitive needs of a genuinely democratic community” (Longino 1990,\n236). This connection can be quite direct, as when empirical studies\nshow that existing forms of participation are highly correlated with\nhigh status and income, that lower income and status citizens were\noften unwilling to participate in a public forum for fear of public\nhumiliation (Verba, et al 1995, Mansbridge 1991, Kelly 2000). Adopting\nthe second-person perspective of those who cannot effectively\nparticipate does not simply unmask egalitarian or meritocratic claims\nabout political participation, but rather also suggests why critical\ninquiry ought to seek new forums and modes of public expression (Young\n2002, Bohman 1996). \n\nThe practical alternative offers a solution to this problem by\ntaking critical social theory in the direction of a pragmatic\nreinterpretation of the verification of critical inquiry that turns\nseemingly intractable epistemic problems into practical ones. The role\nof critical social science is to supply methods for making explicit\njust the sort of self-examination necessary for on-going normative\nregulation of social life. This practical regulation includes the\ngoverning norms of critical social science itself. Here the relation of\ntheory to practice is a different one than among the original\npragmatists: more than simply clarifying the relation of means and ends\nfor decisions on particular issues, these social sciences demand\nreflection upon institutionalized practices and their norms of\ncooperation. Reflective practices cannot remain so without critical\nsocial inquiry, and critical social inquiry can only be tested in such\npractices. One possible epistemic improvement is the transformation of\nsocial relations of power and authority into contexts of democratic\naccountability among political equals (Bohman 1999a; Epstein 1996). \n\nProperly reconstructed, critical social inquiry is the basis for a\nbetter understanding of the social sciences as the distinctive form of\npractical knowledge in modern societies. Their capacity to initiate\ncriticism not only makes them the democratic moment in modern practices\nof inquiry; that is, the social are democratic to the extent that they\nare sufficiently reflexive and can initiate discussion of the social\nbasis of inquiry within a variety of institutional contexts. Normative\ncriticism is thus not only based on the moral and cognitive distance\ncreated by relating and crossing various perspectives; it also has a\npractical goal. It seeks to expand each normative perspective in\ndialogical reflection and in this way make human beings more aware of\nthe circumstances that restrict their freedom and inhibit the full,\npublic use of their practical knowledge. One such salient circumstance\nis the long-term historical process of globalization. What is a\ndistinctively critical theory of globalization that aims at such a form\nof practical knowledge? How might such a theory contribute to wishes\nand struggles of the age, now that such problematic situations are\ntransnational and even global? What normative standards can critics\nappeal to, if not those immanent in liberalism? While in the next\nsection I will certainly talk about critical theorists, I will also\nattempt to do critical social inquiry that combines normative and\nempirical perspectives with the aim of realizing greater and perhaps\nnovel forms of democracy where none presently exist. \n\nWhile the standard theories of globalization deal with large scale and\nmacrosociological processes, the social fact of globalization is not\nuniform; differently situated actors experience it differently. This\nmakes it exemplary for pluralist and multiperspectival social\ninquiry. It is also exemplary in another sense. As a social fact that\nis not uniform in its consequences, globalization cannot be\nreconstructed from the internal perspective of any single democratic\npolitical community, it requires a certain kind of practically\noriented knowledge about the possibilities of realising norms and\nideals in praxis and is thus a theory of democratization, of\ncreating a political space where none now exists.  We may call this\npractical theory of praxis a “praxeology” (Linklater 2001,\n38).  Though the use of the term “praxeology” can be\ntraced back to the work of Ludwig von Mises and even earlier to Alfred\nEspinas, Linklater’s use derives from the way the term is employed in\nRaymond Aron’s work (Aron 2003, 577).  The purpose of praxeology, in\nthis sense, is inquiry into the “knowing how” of practical\nnormative knowledge, that is, how it is that norms are ongoingly\ninterpreted, realized, and enacted under particular social and\nhistorical circumstances. A critical and praxeological theory of\nglobalization must therefore solve two pressing internal problems:\nfirst, how to organize social inquiry within and among transnational\ninstitutions more democratically; and, second, it must show the\nsalient differences between national and transnational institutions\nand public spheres so that the democratic influence over globalization\nbecomes a more tractable problem with feasible solutions. \n\nCurrent theories of globalization are primarily macro-sociological\nand focus primarily on globalization as imposing constraints on\ndemocratic institutions. While not denying that globalization is such a\nfact, its explanations can become more critical and practical by also\nshowing how globalizing processes open up new institutional\npossibilities and new forms of publicity (Bohman 2003). In order to\ntest these possibilities, this theory must make itself a more open and\nmultiperspectival practice; it must become a global critical theory. It\nis in this context that we can press the questions of the normative\nadequacy of the democratic ideal that has been inherited from modern\nliberalism. Indeed, many critical theorists who defend a\n“cosmopolitan” conception of democracy have a surprisingly\nstandard conception of how democracy is best organized discursively and\ndeliberatively. For this reason, they have not asked the question\nwhether such practices are able to sustain a sufficiently robust and\ncooperative form of inquiry under the new global circumstances of\npolitical interdependence. \n\nIn what respect can it be said that this novel sort of practical and\ncritical social science should be concerned with social facts? A social\nscientific praxeology understands facts in relation to human agency\nrather than independent of it. Pragmatic social science is concerned\nnot merely with elaborating an ideal in convincing normative arguments,\nbut also with its realizability and its feasibility. In this regard,\nany political ideal must take into account general social facts if it\nis to be feasible; but it must also be able to respond to a series of\nsocial facts that ground skeptical challenges suggesting that\ncircumstances make such an ideal impossible. With respect to democracy,\nthese facts include, expertise and the division of labor, cultural\npluralism and conflict, social complexity and differentiation, and\nglobalization and increasing social interdependence, to name a few. In\ncases where “facts” challenge the very institutional basis of\nmodern political integration, normative practical inquiry must seek to\nextend the scope of political possibilities rather than simply accept\nthe facts as fixing the limits of political possibilities once and for\nall. For this reason, social science is practical to the extent that it\nis able to show how political ideals that have informed these\ninstitutions in question are not only still possible, but also feasible\nunder current conditions or modification of those conditions. As I have\nbeen arguing, the ideal in question for pragmatism and recent critical\nsocial theory inspired by pragmatism is a robust and deliberative form\nof self-rule—also a key aspect of Critical Theory’s wider\nhistorical ideal of human emancipation and freedom from domination. \n\nThe issue of realizability has to do with a variety of constraints.\nOn the one hand, democracy requires voluntary constraints on action,\nsuch as commitments to basic rights and to constitutional limits on\npolitical power. Social facts, on the other hand, are non-voluntary\nconstraints, or within our problematic, constraints that condition the\nscope of the application of democratic principles. Taken up in a\npractical social theory oriented to suggesting actions that might\nrealize the ideal of democracy in modern society, social facts no\nlonger operate simply as constraints. For Rawls, “the fact of\npluralism” (or the diversity of moral doctrines in modern societies) is\njust one such permanent feature of modern society that is directly\nrelevant to political order, because its conditions “profoundly\naffect the requirements of a workable conception of justice” (Rawls\n1999, 424). \n\nThis is not yet a complete story. Social facts such as pluralism\nhave become “permanent” only to the extent that modern\ninstitutions and ideals developed after the Wars of Religion, including\nconstitutional democracy and freedom of expression, promote rather than\ninhibit their development. This fact of pluralism thus alters how we\nare to think of the feasibility of a political ideal, but does\nnot touch on its realizability or possibility. Similarly, the\n“fact of coercion,” understood as the fact that any political\norder created around a single doctrine would require oppressive use of\nstate power, concerns not the realizability or possibility of a\nparticular ideal, but its feasibility as “a stable and unified\norder,” under the conditions of pluralism (Rawls 1999, 225). Thus, for\nRawls, regardless of whether they<unclear referent> are\nconsidered in terms of possibility or feasibility, they are only\nconsidered as constraints—as restricting what is\npolitically possible or what can be brought about by political action\nand power. In keeping with the nature and scope of entrenched\npluralism, not all actors and groups experience the constraints of\npluralism in the same way: from the perspective of some groups,\npluralism enables their flourishing; for others, it may be an\nobstacle. \n\nIf this were the only role of putative “facts” in Rawls’\npolitical theory of modernity, then it would not be a full practical\ntheory in the sense that I am using the term here. Rawls’ contribution\nis that social facts differ in kind, so that some, such as the fact of\npluralism, are “permanent” and not merely to be considered in\nnarrow terms of functional stability. Social facts related to stability\nmay indeed constrain feasibility without being limits on the\npossibility or realizability of an ideal as such; in the case of\npluralism, for example, democratic political ideals other than\nliberalism might be possible. Without locating a necessary connection\nbetween its relations to feasibility and possibility, describing a\nsocial fact as “permanent” is not entirely accurate. It is better\ninstead to think of such facts as “institutional facts” that are\ndeeply entrenched in some historically contingent, specific social\norder rather than as universal normative constraints on democratic\ninstitutions. \n\nThis approach allows us to see the “facts” of modern societies\nas practical: they are precisely those determinations that are embedded\nin relatively long-term social processes, whose consequences cannot be\nreversed in a short period of time—such as a generation— by\npolitical action. Practical theories thus have to consider the ways in\nwhich such facts become part of a constructive process that might be\ncalled “generative entrenchment” (Wimstatt 1974, 67–86). By\n“entrenchment of social facts,” I mean that the relevant\ndemocratic institutions promote the very conditions that make the\ninstitutional social fact possible in assuming those conditions for\ntheir own possibility. When the processes at work in the social fact\nthen begin to outstrip particular institutional feedback mechanisms\nthat maintain it within the institution, then the institution must be\ntransformed if it is to stand in the appropriate relation to the facts\nthat make it feasible and realizable. All institutions, including\ndemocratic ones, entrench some social facts in realizing their\nconditions of possibility. \n\nConsider Habermas’ similar use of social facts with respect to\ninstitutions. As with Rawls, for Habermas pluralism and the need for\ncoercive political power make the constitutional state necessary, so\nthat the democratic process of law making is governed by a system of\npersonal, social, and civil rights. However, Habermas introduces a more\nfundamental social fact for the possibility and feasibility of\ndemocracy: the structural fact of social complexity. Complex societies\nare “polycentric,” with a variety of forms of order, some of\nwhich, such as non-intentional market coordination, do not necessarily\nhave to answer to the ideals of democracy. This fact of complexity\nlimits political participation and changes the nature of our\nunderstanding of democratic institutions. Indeed, this fact makes it\nsuch that the principles of democratic self-rule and the criteria of\npublic agreement cannot be asserted simply as the proper norms for all\nsocial and political institutions, and this seems ideally suited to\nunderstanding how globalization limits the capacity of democracy to\nentrench itself. As Habermas puts it, “unavoidable social\ncomplexity makes it impossible to apply the criteria [of democratic\nlegitimacy] in an undifferentiated way” (Habermas 1996, 305). This fact\nmakes a certain kind of structure ineluctable; since complexity means\nthat democracy can “no longer control the conditions under which\nit is realized.” In this case, the social fact has become\n“unavoidable,” and certain institutions are necessary for the\nsocial integration to which there is “no feasible alternative” (Habermas 2001 122). \n\nWhile plausible, this claim lacks empirical evidence. Habermas here\noverestimates the constraining character of this “fact,” which\ndoes little to restrict a whole range of indirect, institutionally\nmediated institutional designs. These mediated forms of democracy would\nin turn affect the conditions that produce social complexity itself and\nthus stand in a feedback relation to them. The consequences of the\n“fact” of social complexity is thus not the same across all\nfeasible, self-entrenching institutional realizations of democracy, and\nsome ideals of democracy may rightly encourage the preservation of\naspects of complexity, such as the ways in which the epistemic division\nof labour may promote wider and more collaborative problem solving and\ndeliberation on ends. How might this alternative conception of social\nfacts guide a critical and praxeological theory of globalization? \n\nWhen seen in light of the requirements of practical social science and\nthe entrenchment of facts and conditions by institutions,\nconstructivists are right to emphasise how agents produce and maintain\nsocial realities, even if not under conditions of their own making. In\nthis context an important contribution of pragmatism is precisely its\ninterpretation of the practical status of social facts. Thus, Dewey\nsees social facts as always related to “problematic\nsituations,” even if these are more felt or suffered than fully\nrecognised as such.  The way to avoid turning problematic situations\ninto empirical-normative dilemmas is, as Dewey suggests, to see even\nfacts practically: “facts are such in a logical sense only as\nthey serve to delimit a problem in a way that affords indication and\ntest of proposed solutions” (Dewey 1938, 499). They may serve\nthis practical role only if they are seen in interaction with our\nunderstanding of the ideals that guide the practices in which such\nproblems emerge, thus where neither fact nor ideal is fixed and\nneither is given justificatory or theoretical priority. \n\nThe debate between Dewey and Lippmann about the public sphere and\nits role in democracy is precisely praxeological in the sense that I\ndefined the term earlier. In response to Lippmann’s insistence on the\npreeminence of expertise, Dewey criticised “existing political\npractice” for the reason that it largely ignored “occupational\ngroups and the organized knowledge and purposes that are involved in\nthe existence of such groups, manifests a dependence upon a summation\nof individuals quantitatively” (Dewey 1927a, 50–51). At the same time,\nhe recognised that existing institutions were obstacles to the\nemergence of such a form of participatory democracy in an era when\n“the machine age has enormously expanded, multiplied,\nintensified, and complicated the scope of indirect consequences” of\ncollective action and where the collectives—affected by actions\nof such a scope—are so large and diverse “that the\nresultant public cannot identify and distinguish itself” (Dewey 1927b,\n314). Dewey saw the solution in a transformation both of what it is to\nbe a public and of the institutions with which the public interacts.\nSuch interaction will provide the basis for determining how the\nfunctions of the new form of political organization will be limited and\nexpanded, the scope of which is “something to be critically and\nexperimentally determined” in democracy as a mode of practical inquiry\n(Dewey 1927b, 281). The question is not just one of current political\nfeasibility, but also of possibility, given that we want to remain\ncommitted in some broad sense to democratic principles of self-rule\neven if not to the set of possibilities provided by current\ninstitutions. How do we identify such fundamentally unsettling facts? I\nturn next to the discussion of a specific social fact, the “fact\nof globalization” and interpret it not as a uniform and aggregative\nprocess but as a problematic situation that is experienced in different\nand even contradictory ways at different locations and from a variety\nof perspectives, and is differently assessed with respect to different\nnormative ideals of democracy. Since this is a relatively recent and\nunsettled debate, through this example we can see Critical Theory in\nthe making. \n\nFor some critical theorists, the relatively “new” fact of\nglobalization permits a direct inference to the need for new and more\ncosmopolitan forms of democracy and citizenship. Whatever the specific\nform these assume in future institutions, the usual arguments for\npolitical cosmopolitanism are relatively simple despite the fact that\nthe social scientific analyses employed in them are highly complex and\nempirically differentiated in their factual claims. In discussions of\ntheories of globalization, the fact of global interdependence refers to\nthe unprecedented extent, intensity, and speed of social interactions\nacross borders, encompassing diverse dimensions of human conduct from\ntrade and cultural exchange to migration (Held, et al 1999). The\ninference from these facts of interdependence is that existing forms of\ndemocracy within the nation-state must be transformed and that\ninstitutions ought to be established that solve problems that transcend\nnational boundaries (Held 1995, 98–101). Thus, globalization is taken\nto be a macro-sociological, aggregative fact that constrains the\nrealization of democracy so long as the proper congruence between\ndecision makers and decision takers is lacking. Globalization is thus\ntaken as a constraint on democracy as it is realized in existing\nliberal representative systems. The Deweyan alternative is to see that\nfacts “have to be determined in their dual function as obstacles\nand as resources,” as problems that also hold out the conditions that\nmake the transformation of the situation possible (Dewey 1938,\n399–400). The “mere” fact of the wider scale of interaction is\nthus inadequate on its own and does not capture what role globalization\nmay play as a problematic situation for the emergence of new democratic\npossibilities. \n\nA pragmatic interpretation of social facts in this way encourages us\nto see globalization as Janus-faced, as an obstacle and as a resource\nfor the realization of democratic ideals. This sort of theory sees\nglobalization not as a unitary but rather as a multidimensional\nprocess. Even the notion of “complex interdependence” can be\nmisleading insofar as it falsely suggests the telos of an increasingly\nintegrated world or an increasingly homogeneous culture or political\ncommunity (Keohane 2000, 117). A pragmatic analysis is better served by\na concept such as “interconnectedness” as opposed to\ninterdependence to the extent that interdependence suggests convergence\nand levels the differences in the ways in which globalization is\nexperienced. Rather, it is important here, as in the case of the fact\nof pluralism, to see that this process can be experienced in different\nways by different peoples or political communities, given that it is a\nmultifaceted and multidimensional process producing “differential\ninterconnectedness in different domains” (Held et al 1999, 27). In some\ndomains such as global financial markets, globalization is profoundly\nuneven and deeply stratified reinforcing hierarchies and distributive\ninequalities. Inequalities of access to and control over aspects of\nglobalizing processes may reflect older patterns of subordination and\norder, even while the process produces new ones by excluding some\ncommunities from financial markets and by making others more vulnerable\nto its increased volatility (Hurrell and Woods 1999). \n\nIf these descriptions are correct, the fact of globalization is a\nnew sort of social fact whose structure of enablement and constraint is\nnot easily captured at the aggregative level. It is even experienced in\ncontradictory ways looking at its consequences and impacts that differ\nacross various domains and at various locations. Institutions can only\nmanage the problems of globalization in ways that consider the\ninterests of everyone by having mechanisms that ensure that the full\nrange of perspectives is available for inquiry. This requires that\ninternational financial institutions extent their forms of inquiry to\ninclude issues such as the social disintegration and domination\nproduced by their policies (Rodrik 1994, Woods 2001). \n\nOne further question about the fact of globalization must be raised\nin order to understand the inherent possibilities for democracy in it.\nIs globalization a “permanent” fact for democracy as Rawls\ndescribed the fact of pluralism for liberalism in that it is deeply\nembedded in its possible realizations? As many social theorists have\nargued, globalization is part of interlocking and long-term social\nprocesses beginning in early modernity; as Anthony Giddens put it,\n“modernity is inherently globalizing” (Giddens 1990, 63). Even if\nreversing such processes were possible, it is not feasible in any short\ntime span and under the democratic constraints. As with Rawls’ fact of\npluralism, so long as “globalizing” societies are democratic, we\ncan expect such processes to continue. This is not to say that\nglobalization in its current form is somehow permanent or unalterable\nif we want to realize democratic ideals. Indeed, just how globalization\nwill continue, and under what legitimate normative constraints, become\nthe proper questions for democratic politics, as citizens and public\nvigorously interact with those institutions that make globalization a\ndeeply entrenched and temporally stable social fact. However\nentrenched, the social fact of globalization still remains open to\ndemocratic reconstruction, should creative reinterpretation of\ndemocracy come about. In the next section, I examine recent debates\namong Critical Theorists about the significance of the European Union\nas a model for a genuine transformation of democracy. \n\nThe analysis thus far has taken a robust ideal of democracy for\ngranted consisting of self-rule by the public deliberation of free and\nequal citizens—the ideal of deliberative democracy that informs\nboth pragmatism and Critical Theory (Bohman 2004). Given the uneven and\npotentially contradictory consequences of globalization, it seems clear\nthat current democratic institutions themselves cannot be responsive to\nall the dimensions of domination and subordination that are possible\nconsidering the scale and intensity of interconnectedness. What are the\nalternatives? It is not just a matter of exercising an institutional\nimagination within broadly understood democratic norms and ideals.\nInformed by democratic ideals of non-domination, the practical\nknowledge needed to promote the democratising of uneven and\nhierarchical social relations requires an empirical analysis of current\ntransformations and its embedded possibilities. The democratic ideal of\nautonomy leads David Held and others to emphasise the emerging\nstructures of international law that produce a kind of binding power of\ncollective decisions. Others look to ways of reforming the structures\nof representation of current international institutions (Pogge 1997,\nHabermas 2001). Still others look to the emergence of various\ninstitutions in the European Union (EU) to discuss the trend toward\ninternational constitutionalism or supranational deliberation. \n\nAccording to the sort of plurality of perspectives endorsed by a\npragmatist philosophy of social science, a historical account of the\nemergence of single and multiple institutions would be helpful. In\nGerald Ruggie’s masterful analysis of the development of a global\norder beyond the nation-state, he shows that the modern sovereign\nstate and the social empowerment of citizens emerged within the same\nepistemic era as the single point perspective in painting,\ncartography, or optics. “The concept of sovereignty then\nrepresented merely the doctrinal counterpart of the application of\nsingle point perspective to the organization of political space”\n(Ruggie, 2000, 186). Unbundling sovereignty would lead to new\npolitical possibilities, including the re-articulation of\ninternational political space in a new way that cannot be anticipated\nin dominant theories of international relations.  Focusing on the\nshifts in the authority of states and the development of the European\nUnion, Ruggie sees the “EU as the first multiperspectival polity\nto emerge in the modern era” and thus the emergence of a new\npolitical form. The concept of “the multiperspectival\nform” does seem to offer “a lens through which to view\nother possible instances of international transformation today”\n(Ruggie 2000, 196). Such an account also applies to the theory of\npractical knowledge that might inform reflection on the possibilities\nof democracy in an era of uneven globalization. \n\nIf the political authority that now promotes globalization is to\nanswer to democratic will formation, the institutions in which such\npublic deliberation takes place must seek to become explicitly\nmultiperspectival in Ruggie’s sense. The positive conditions for such\nan extension of current political possibilities already exist in the\nfact of interdependence—the emergence of greater social\ninteraction among citizens who participate in vibrant interaction\nacross transnational civil society and within emerging global public\nspheres. In order to develop the framework for such a\nnormative-practical praxeology for emerging multiperspectival\ninstitutions, pragmatism and Critical Theory once again suggest\nthemselves: here Dewey’s testable claim that it is the interaction of\npublic and institutions that promotes democracy and democratic inquiry.\nHowever important giving greater powers to the European Parliament may\nbe, parliamentary politics at best serves a mediating role among\ntransnational and national institutions and is not the sole means to\ndemocratisation (Habermas 2001). Given that such institutions cannot\neasily be scaled up and retain their full democratic character, it is\nnecessary to look to a different institutional level: to the\npossibility of new forms of social inquiry that may be developing in\nthe problem-solving mechanisms of the European Union. \n\nHow might new forms of inquiry emerge that are able to accommodate a\ngreater number of perspectives and also remain democratic? Here we need\nagain to distinguish between first- and second-order forms of\ndeliberation, where the latter develops in order to accommodate an\nemergent public with new perspectives and interests. Dewey sees the\nnormal, problem-solving functioning of democratic institutions as based\non robust interaction between publics and institutions within a set of\nconstrained alternatives. When the institutional alternatives\nimplicitly address a different public than is currently constituted by\nevolving institutional practice and its consequences, the public may\nact indirectly and self-referentially by forming a new public with\nwhich the institutions must interact. This interaction initiates a\nprocess of democratic renewal in which publics organise and are\norganised by new emerging institutions with a different alternative set\nof political possibilities. Of course, this is a difficult process:\n“to form itself the public has to break existing political forms;\nthis is hard to do because these forms are themselves the regular means\nfor instituting political change” (Dewey 1927b, 255). This sort of\ninnovative process describes the emergence of those transnational\npublics that are indirectly affected by the new sorts of authoritative\ninstitutions brought about by managing “deregulation” and\nglobalization. This account of democratic learning and innovation seems\nnot to be limited by the scope of the institutions, even as the\npotential for domination also increases under current arrangements. \n\nWhat sort of public sphere could play such a normative role? In\ndifferentiated modern societies (that is, societies divided into\nmultiple economic and social spheres such as markets, a state, civil\nsociety and so on), one role of the distinctive communication that goes\non in the public sphere is to raise topics or express concerns that cut\nacross social spheres: it not only circulates information about the\nstate and the economy, but it also establishes a forum for criticism in\nwhich the boundaries of these spheres are crossed, primarily in\ncitizen’s demands for mutual accountability. But the other side of this\ngeneralization is a requirement for communication that crosses social\ndomains: such a generalization is necessary precisely because the\npublic sphere has become less socially and culturally homogeneous and\nmore internally differentiated than its early modern form (Habermas\n1989). Instead of appealing to an assumed common norm of\n“publicity” or a set of culturally specific practices of\ncommunication, a cosmopolitan public sphere is created when at\nleast two culturally rooted public spheres begin to overlap and\nintersect, as when translations and conferences create a cosmopolitan\npublic sphere in various academic disciplines. Instead of relying on\nthe intrinsic features of the medium to expand communicative\ninteraction, networks that are global in scope become publics only with\nthe development and expansion of transnational civil society. The\ncreation of such a civil society is a slow and difficult process that\nrequires the highly reflexive forms of communication and boundary\ncrossing and accountability typical of developed public spheres. On the\nbasis of their common knowledge of violations of publicity, their\nmembers will develop the capacities of public reason to cross and\nnegotiate boundaries and differences between persons, groups, and\ncultures. \n\nIn such boundary-crossing publics, the speed, scale, and intensity\nof communicative interaction facilitated by networks such as the\nInternet provides a positive and enabling condition for democratic\ndeliberation and thus creates a potential space for cosmopolitan\ndemocracy. Such a development hardly demands that the public sphere be\n“integrated with media systems of matching scale that occupy the same\nsocial space as that over which economic and political decision will\nhave an impact” (Garnham 1995, 265). But if the way to do this is\nthrough disaggregated networks (such as the Internet) rather than mass\nmedia, then we cannot expect that the global public sphere will no\nlonger exhibit features of the form of the national public sphere.\nRather, it will be a public of publics, of disaggregated networks\nembedded in a variety of institutions rather than an assumed unified\nnational public sphere. \n\nThe emergence of transnational public spheres is informative for the\npractical goals of a critical theory of globalization. Once we examine\nthe potential ways in which the Internet can expand the features of\ncommunicative interaction, whether or not the Internet is a public\nsphere is a practical question of possibility rather than a theoretical\nquestion about the fact of the matter. It depends not only on which\ninstitutions shape its framework but also on how participants contest\nand change these institutions and on how they interpret the Internet as\na public space. It depends on the mediation of agency, not on\ntechnology. With the proliferation of non-governmental organizations\n(NGOs) and other forms of transnational civil society organization, it\nis plausible to expect that two different and interacting levels of\nmultiperspectival innovation may emerge: first, new institutions such\nas the European Union that are more adapted to multiple jurisdictions\nand levels of governance; and, second, a vibrant transnational civil\nsociety that produces public spheres around various institutions with\nthe goal of making their forms of inquiry more transparent, accessible\nand open to a greater variety of actors and perspectives. This approach\ndoes not limit the sources of the democratic impulse to transnational\ncivil society. Rather, the better alternative is to reject both\nbottom-up and top-down approaches in favour of vigorous interaction\nbetween publics and institutions as the ongoing source of\ndemocratization and institutional innovation. \n\nAccording to a pragmatically inspired democratic experimentalism,\nattempts at democratisation and reform need not wait for publics to\nemerge; they can be constructed in various practices. Consultative NGOs\nmay generally become too intertwined with institutions and thus do not\ngeneratively entrench their own conditions in this way. This practical\ndifficulty is evident in the official civil society organizations of\nthe European Union that fail to promote public deliberation. Without\nfurther conceptual and normative clarification, the appeal to various\n“bottom up” strategies of democratization remains normatively\nunderdeveloped (Dryzek 1996, Jaggar, 2004). Even when informed by\ndemocratic aims, this form of politics cannot capture the complex\ninterrelationships of civil society, the state and the market,\nespecially given the background of inequalities and asymmetries that\noperate in processes of globalization. Apart from powerful corporate\nactors in civil society, NGOs from economically advantaged regions\npossess significant resources to influence and shape the formation of\ncivil society in other contexts. A critical theory of such activity\nasks about the possibility of a strong connection between their powers\nin civil society with market forces (Silliman 1998). \n\nBesides the spontaneous emergence of publics out of transnational\nassociations, it is also possible to make use of self-consciously\nconstructed publics of relevant stakeholders to act as\n“mini-publics” that are empowered to deliberate and make\ndecisions (Fung 2003). Here we can include a variety of experiments,\nfrom participatory budgets to citizen boards and juries that have a\nvariety of decision-making powers. Properly empowered and\nself-consciously constructed, mini-publics offer a strategy to get\nbeyond the dilemma of insider consultation and outsider contestation\nthat is a structural feature of civil society activity in currently\nexisting international institutions. Since self-consciously created\nminipublics seek to include all relevant stakeholders, they do not rely\non representation as the mode of communicating interests, or even the\ninclusion of well-organized actors as a way of achieving effective\nimplementation. Instead they open up a directly deliberative process\nwithin the institution that includes as many perspectives as possible\nand can be repeated when necessary. The minipublic is then an\ninstitutionally constructed intermediary, although it could act in such\na way as to become an agent for the creation of a larger public with\nnormative powers. In this capacity, minipublics may become open and\nexpandable spaces for democratic experimentation. While many are issue\nor domain specific, such experiments often become models for democratic\ngovernance in dispersed and diverse polities. As Cohen and Rogers put\nit, the more specific and episodic practices aim at mutual benefits\nthrough improved coordination, experimental deliberative practices tied\nto larger political projects may redistribute power and advantage and\nin this way secure the conditions of democracy more generally (Cohen\nand Rogers 2003, 251). \n\nThe same point could be made about taking existing democratic\ninstitutions as the proper model for democratization. To look only at\nthe constraints of size in relation to a particular form of political\ncommunity begs the question of whether or not there are alternative\nlinkages between democracy and the public sphere that are not simply\nscaled up. Such linkages might be more decentralized and polycentric\nthan the national community requires. The issue here is the standard\nof evaluation, not whether some other public sphere or form of\ncommunity “is totally or completely democratic, but whether it\nis adequately democratic given the kind of entity we take it to\nbe” (McCormick 1996, 345). For a nation state to be democratic\nit requires a certain sort of public sphere sufficient to create a\nstrong public via its connections to parliamentary debate. A\ntransnational and thus polycentric and pluralist community, such as\nthe European Union, requires a different sort of public sphere in\norder to promote sufficient democratic deliberation. Once a\ntransnational and post-territorial polity rejects the assumption that\nit must be what Rawls calls “a single cooperative scheme in\nperpetuity,” a more fluid and negotiable order might emerge with\nplural authority structures along a number of different dimensions\nrather than a single location for public authority and power. Without\na single location of public power, a unified public sphere becomes an\nimpediment to democracy rather than an enabling condition for mass\nparticipation in decisions at a single location of authority. The\nproblem for an experimental institutional design of directly\ndeliberative democracy is to create precisely the appropriate feedback\nrelation between disaggregated publics and such a polycentric decision\nmaking process.  The lesson for a critical theory of globalization is\nto see the extension of political space and the redistribution of\npolitical power not only as a constraint similar to complexity but\nalso as an open field of opportunities for innovative, distributive,\nand multiperspectival forms of publicity and democracy. \n\nA critical theory of globalization is a practical or praxeologically\noriented theory that sees the “fact of globalization” in relation\nto the goal of realizing the norms of human emancipation and democracy.\nThe central and still open questions for such a practically oriented\nsocial science are the following: what available forms of\npraxis are able to promote the transformations that could lead\nto new forms of democracy? What sort of practical knowledge is needed\nto make this possible and how might this knowledge be stabilised in\ninstitutionalised forms of democratic inquiry? What are the\npossibilities and opportunities for democracy at a higher level of\naggregation that globalization makes possible? How might the public\nsphere be realized at the global level? The argument here suggests that\nsuch inquiry and institutions must go beyond single perspective\nunderstandings of democracy that dominate national political life as\nwell as the various administrative techne that are common in\nthe international sphere. A critical praxeology of realizing norms in\nmultiperspectival institutions might add that it is also a reflexive\nquestion of putting such organization in the larger context of a\nproject of human emancipation. Such an interactive account of publics\nand institutions gives a plausible practical meaning to the extending\nof the project of democracy to the global level. It also models in its\nown form of social science the mode of inquiry that this and other\npublics may employ in creating and assessing the possibilities for\nrealizing democracy. A critical theory of globalization does not only\npoint out the deficits of current practices, but shows the potential\nfor properly organized publics to create new ones. Since the new\npractices need not be modeled on the old ones, it is not a theory of\ndemocracy as such, but of democratization. \n\nIn facing the challenges of new social facts, Critical Theory\nremains a vital philosophical tradition in normative disciplines of\nsocial and political philosophy. Furthermore, this vitality is enhanced\nwhen it considers a range of democratic claims not discussed here, all\nof which equally challenge the fundamental frameworks of conceptions of\ndemocracy, justice, and their interrelationship: these include the\nstruggles of aboriginal peoples, the disabled, women, and more. One\ngreat advantage of the practical account is that it makes it easier to\nsee why there are many different critical theories in different\nhistorical contexts, what Marx called the “wishes and struggles\nof the age.” On a practical account, critical inquiry aims at creating\nthe reflective conditions necessary for the practical verification of\nits inquiry, and these conditions are not confined only to democratic\ninstitutions, but wherever publics employ critical social theories and\nmethods as the moment of inquiry of their democratic politics. As new\nforms of critical theory emerge related to racism, sexism, and\ncolonialism, reflective social agents have transformed these same\ndemocratic ideals and practices in the interest of emancipation. In\nentrenching new social facts, agents transform the ideals themselves as\nwell as their institutional form. \n\nThis critical and practical orientation gives rise to three\ndifferent questions about critical social inquiry. First, does Critical\nTheory suggest a distinctive form of social inquiry? Second, what sort\nof knowledge does such inquiry provide in order to provide insight into\nsocial circumstances and justify social criticism of current ideals and\ninstitutions? Finally, what sort of verification does critical inquiry\nrequire? In light of the answers to these questions on the practical,\ndemocratic, and multiperspectival interpretation defended here, it is\nlikely that Critical Theory is no longer a unique approach.\nMethodologically, it becomes more thoroughly pluralistic. Politically,\nit loses its capital letters as the aims and struggles of the age of\nglobalization become more diverse and not automatically connected by\nthe commitment to any particular holistic social theory. Given its own\ndemocratic aims, it would be hard to justify any other interpretation.\nIn a period in which philosophy cooperates with empirical sciences and\ndisciplines, Critical Theory offers an approach to distinctly normative\nissues that cooperates with the social sciences in a nonreductive way.\nIts domain is inquiry into the normative dimension of social activity,\nin particular how actors employ their practical knowledge and normative\nattitudes from complex perspectives in various sorts of contexts. It\nalso must consider social facts as problematic situations from the\npoint of view of variously situated agents. \n\nThis kind of normative practical knowledge is thus reflexive and\nfinds its foothold in those ongoing, self-transforming normative\nenterprises such as democracy that are similarly reflexive in practice.\nBy discussing democracy in this way, I have also tried to show just how\ndeep the connections are between it and critical social science:\ncritical theories are not democratic theories, but their practical\nconsequences are assessed and verified in democratic practice and\nsolved by inquiry into better democratic practice. Perhaps one of the\nmore pernicious forms of ideology now is embodied in the appeal of the\nclaim that there are no alternatives to present institutions. In this\nage of diminishing expectations, one important role that remains for\nthe social scientifically informed, and normatively oriented democratic\ncritic is to offer novel alternatives and creative possibilities in\nplace of the defeatist claim that we are at the end of history. That\nwould not only mean the end of inquiry, but also the end of\ndemocracy."}]
