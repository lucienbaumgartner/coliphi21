From the end of the 10th, throughout the\n11th, and up to the beginning of the 12th\ncenturies, the production of original philosophical literature into\nArabic and Persian became the main stream of the Arabic-Islamic\nphilosophy, which was by then increasingly distant from the Greek\nsources in Arabic translation. Avicenna’s works fully attest\nthis phenomenon, which prompted a 12th century purist trend\nwell exemplified in the Muslim West by Averroes’ program of\ngoing back to Aristotle: a similar phenomenon occurred also in the\nMuslim East, with Muwaffaq al-Din Muhammad ‘Abd al-Latif ibn\nYusuf al-Baghdadi .\n\n‘Abd al-Latif was a philosopher and polymath who lived\nbetween the Second Crusade (1147–1149 AD) and the end of the\nFifth Crusade (1217–1231 AD). He was born in Baghdad in 1162 and\ndied there on 9 November 1231 after a pilgrimage of more than forty\nyears during which he travelled throughout Iraq, Syria and Egypt\nlooking for a good teacher in philosophy. He grew up in a\nShafi‘i family with excellent links with the Nizamiyya madrasa\nand he received a solid education in Islamic sciences. Then he turned\nto natural sciences, medicine, philosophy and, critically, to\nalchemy. His spasmodic search for knowledge brought him to meet\nthrough their writings Avicenna, al-Ghazali and\nal-Suhrawardi. ‘Abd al-Latif had many generous patrons and was\nin touch with the most important men of his era including the Saladin\nand, in Cairo, Maimonides. Cairo represented for ‘Abd al-Latif\nthe much-desired goal of his pilgrimage, the place where he finally\nmet Aristotle and his philosophy as well as that of his commentators\nThemistius and Alexander, and where he finally encountered the work of\nthe greatest Arabic Aristotelian commentator of the East,\nal-Farabi. For ‘Abd al-Latif, Cairo also meant the progressive\nabandonment of Avicenna’s philosophy, which he had held to be\nthe only one possible during the earlier years of his\neducation. ‘Abd al-Latif was a sharp critic, an independent\nthinker, and a prodigious writer on philosophy and medicine. His\nstated intellectual program was that to go back to the original Greek\nworks in Arabic translation, and in particular to return to Aristotle\nin philosophy and to Hippocrates, via Galen, in medicine, but he was\nable to go back to these sources only through the lens of their\nreworkings by the philosophers before Avicenna, al-Kindi and\nal-Farabi.\n\n\n\n\n‘Abd al-Latif’s intellectual position comes across in\nhis autobiography (sira). It seems to have formed part of a\nlarger work no longer extant which he wrote for his son Sharaf al-Din\nYusuf. The sira is contained in the Sources of\nInformation on the Classes of Physicians by Ibn Abi\nUsaybi‘a (Ibn Abi Usaybi‘a, c. 1242 [1882–84], Kitab\n‘Uyun al-anba’ fi tabaqat al-atibba’,\nA. Müller (ed.), al-Qahira: al-Matba‘at al-wahbiyya,\n1882–1884: II. 201–213; Martini Bonadeo 2013), and even\nmore in the Book of the Two Pieces of Advice (see Gutas 2011;\nMartini Bonadeo 2013; Joosse 2014; Fedouache - Ajoun - Ben Ahmed 2018). Other passages from ‘Abd\nal-Latif’s autobiography have been preserved by\nal-Dhahabi’s History of Islam (Von Somogyi 1937;\nCahen 1970). Finally, further information on ‘Abd al-Latif can\nbe found in the report of his journey in Egypt entitled Book of\nthe Report and Account of the Things which I Witnessed and the Events\nSeen in the Land of Egypt, a compendium extracted from his own\nhistory of Egypt, lost to us (Zand, Videan, & Videan 1965; Martini Bonadeo 2017). He was born in Baghdad in 1162 from an upper class family\noriginating from Mosul and spent his formative years in Baghdad until\n1189. In the years of his youth in Baghdad he studied Islamic sciences\nand medicine with many renowned scholars of his time, including Kamal\nad-Din ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Anbari (d.1181), a professor\nof fiqh (law), adab-literature, hadith\n(traditions) and Arabic grammar at the Nizamiyya madrasa, Wagih\nal-Wasiti (d.1215), a professor at the Zafariyya Mosque, Ibn Fadlan\n(d.1199), an outstanding legal scholar versed in the khilaf\n(divergence of the law) and dialectic, and leader of the\nShafi‘is in Iraq, ‘Abd Allah ibn Ahmad ibn al-Khashshab\n(d.1171), master of hadith, grammarian, mathematician, expert\nin fara’id (hereditary law) and nasab\n(genealogy), Radi al-Dawla Abu Nasr (d.ca.1182), son of the well-known\nphysician Amin al-Dawla Ibn al-Tilmidh, professor of medical\nsubjects. In his hometown ‘Abd al-Latif made his first steps in\nphilosophy studying al-Ghazali’s Intentions of the\nPhilosophers, the Measure of Science in the Art of\nLogic, the Criterion of Action on Ethics and the Touchstone\nof Reasoning in Logic. Then he turned to Avicenna’s books\nincluding the Salvation, the Cure,\nthe Canon, and the Validation by Bahmanyar, a pupil\nof Avicenna. Finally still in Baghdad he studied Indian mathematics,\nEuclid’s geometry, and many books on alchemy by Jabir ibn\nHayyan, but then he abandoned this discipline which he considered an\nirrational practice. At the age of twenty-eight, in 1189, he left Baghdad and began a\nlong period of travel in search for knowledge. First he was in Mosul\nfor a year. There he heard people saying great things about\nal-Suhrawardi. He came across al-Suhrawardi’s treatises\nthe Intimations, the Glimmer, and the Ascending\nSteps; but he did not find in them the knowledge that he was\nlooking for. He left Mosul for Damascus where he joined the grammarian\nal-Kindi al-Baghdadi (d.1216) and he worked on a certain number of\ngrammatical treatises. In Damascus he took more and more distance from\nthe study and practice of alchemy. Then ‘Abd al-Latif went to\nJerusalem and then to the Saladin near Acre. Here he came into contact\nwith Saladin’s entourage: Baha’ al-Din ibn Shaddad\n(1145–1234), his biographer and the chief of the army and the\ncity of Jerusalem, and ‘Imad al-Din al-Katib al-Isfahani\n(d.1201), the chronicler of Saladin’s deeds. With a safe-conduct\ndocument written by this latter ‘Abd al-Latif arrived in\nCairo. His aim in Egypt was to meet Yasin al-Simiya’i, a not well\nknown alchemist, and Moses Maimonides, the famous Jewish philosopher,\ntheologian, and doctor, born in Cordoba in 1135. ‘Abd al-Latif\nrefused to work with the first for the senselessness of his teaching\nand found the latter excellent, but dominated by the desire to excel\nand to lend his services to men in command and of\nprominence. ‘Abd al-Latif’s encounter with the Peripatetic\ntradition took place in the vibrant cultural environment of Cairo\nwhere he met Abu al-Qasim al-Shari‘i, probably the renowned and\nfamous master in the science of hadith Abu al-Qasim\nal-Busayri (d.1202), who had expert knowledge of the works of the\n“Ancients” and of those of Abu Nasr al-Farabi. In Cairo,\nfor the first time ‘Abd al-Latif studied the books of the\n“Ancients”, namely Aristotle, Alexander of Aphrodisias,\nand Themistius, and on the basis of these he began to test the cogency\nof Avicenna’s doctrines. From this he came to hold the\ninferiority of the work of Avicenna. Nevertheless, ‘Abd al-Latif\nwas intimately loath to renounce he who had been his master and the\ninspiration behind his research from his youth. After 13 September 1192, the date of the armistice with the Franks,\n‘Abd al-Latif moved to Jerusalem with the Saladin who appointed\nhim as the administrator of the Umayyad mosque in Damascus. After the\ndeath of the Saladin (d.1193), the last years of ‘Abd\nal-Latif’s life took the form of a long series of journeys, no\nlonger in search of knowledge, instruction, teachers and books, but\nall motivated by, or at the behest of, patrons: in Damascus al-Malik\nal-Afdal, Saladin’s eldest son; in Cairo al-Malik al-Aziz, in\nJerusalem al-Malik al-Adil Sayf al-Din Abu Bakr ibn Ayyub, in Erzinjan\nal-Malik ‘Ala’ al-Din Da’ud ibn Bahram, in Aleppo\nShihab al-Din Tughril. While he was in Aleppo he wanted to go on\npilgrimage to Mecca, and he started his journey towards Baghdad to\nleave some of his works to the ‘Abbasid caliph al-Mustansir ibn\nal-Zahir (r. 1226–1242). Once he arrived in Baghdad ‘Abd\nal-Latif fell ill and died on 9 November, 1231. He was buried next to\nhis father in the Wardiyya cemetery. ‘Abd al-Latif’s more famous students were:\nthe hadith scholar al-Birzali (d.1239), the botanist Ibn\nal-Suri (d.1242), the judge al-Tifashi (d.1253), and the biographer\nIbn Khallikan (d.1282). The oldest list of ‘Abd al-Latif’s works is that given\nby Ibn Abi Usaybi‘a at the end of the entry devoted to him in\nthe Sources of Information on the Classes of Physicians (Ibn\nAbi Usaybi‘a, c. 1242 [1882–84]: II. 211.1–213.16).  A\nsecond, later, list is found in Ibn Shakir al-Kutubi’s What\nwas omitted in the Obituaries (Ibn Shakir al-Kutubi, before 1363\n[1974], Fawat al-wafayat, I. ‘Abbas (ed.), Bayrut: Dar\nal-Sadir, 1974: II. 385.1–388.2). The list presented by Ibn Abi Usaybi‘a numbers one hundred\nand seventy-three works, including brief essays and treatises. The\nsubjects reflect the variety of ‘Abd al-Latif’s\ninterests. Thirteen writings are listed which deal with the Arabic\nlanguage, lexicography, and grammar, two with fiqh, nine with\nliterary criticism, fifty-three with medicine, ten with zoology, three\non the science of tawhid (unity of God), three on history,\nthree on mathematics and related disciplines, two on magic and\nmineralogy, and twenty-seven on other themes. There are forty-eight\nworks concerning philosophy: nineteen on logic—two of which are\nagainst Avicenna and the theory of conditional syllogisms—ten on\nphysics, eight on metaphysics, and nine on politics. Two general works\nare also mentioned, divided into three sections: logic, physics, and\nmetaphysics; one of these was in ten volumes and was completed by the\nauthor over a span of twenty years.  Ibn Shakir al-Kutubi’s list is shorter. It numbers fifteen\ndiscourses by ‘Abd al-Latif which are not mentioned by Ibn Abi\nUsaybi‘a and eighty-one works, all mentioned in the previous\nlist, with the exception of one about antidotes. The works which have come down to us, or at least those\ncontained in manuscripts so far\nidentified (Martini Bonadeo 2013, Fedouache - Ajoun - Ben Ahmed 2018), concerning hadith, lexicography, and grammar\nare  About fiqh (law) there are About mathematics there is  On medicine some works survived:  Concerning philosophy, there are:  Besides these works further eleven treatises have been\npreserved—among which is the already mentioned Book of the\nTwo Pieces of Advice—in the miscellaneous manuscript Bursa,\nHüseyin Çelebi 823 (Stern 1962; Fedouache - Ajoun - Ben Ahmed 2018, 3–236):  In the Book of the Two Pieces of Advice, a diatribe\nagainst false knowledge, ‘Abd al-Latif presents “two\npieces of advice” for would-be physicians and would-be\nphilosophers, an impassioned polemic against false physicians, and an\nequally harsh invective against false philosophers (see Gutas 2011;\nMartini Bonadeo 2013; Joosse 2014; Fedouache - Ajoun - Ben Ahmed 2018). Those who, in his age, devote themselves to philosophy are bad\nphilosophers for many different reasons: their lack of interest, the\nobscurity of philosophy and their lack of training and good\nteachers. But the main reason for the decline of the philosophical\nproduction of his age lies in the neglect into which the works of the\nAncients have fallen. The pages of these works are by now being used\nby bookbinders and pharmacists as paper for packaging. No\none—says ‘Abd al-Latif—wants to deny the\ncontributions made by Avicenna to philosophical research. He has, in\nfact, provided new energy to philosophy, and he has been able in part\nto understand the books of the Ancients and to offer an introduction\nto them. Nevertheless, if one examines his works in more detail and\ncompares them with those on similar themes by ancient authors and, in\nparticular, with Aristotle or al-Farabi, their inferiority\nemerges. For this reason ‘Abd al-Latif proposes presenting the\nmethod followed by Plato and Aristotle in their respective\nphilosophies. In doing that, he follows al-Farabi, summarizes and\nliterally quotes al-Farabi’s Philosophy of Plato and\nAristotle (Rosenthal & Walzer 1943; Mahdi 1961, 2001), where\nboth Platonic dialogues and Aristotelian treatises are set out in such\nan order as to constitute a systematic and progressive investigation\nof all the areas of philosophical research. For ‘Abd al-Latif, as for al-Farabi’s Plato,\nphilosophical research begins with an investigation of what\nconstitutes the perfection of man as man, which does not consist of a\nhealthy physique, a pleasant face, noble descent, a large group of\nfriends and lovers; nor does it consist in riches, glory, or power,\nsince none of these is able to make man fully and truly happy. For man\nthe attainment of happiness consists in a particular type of\nknowledge, the knowledge of the substances of all the beings and a\ncertain lifestyle, the virtuous life. Knowledge of things according to\ntheir essence is not an end in itself, but is that which must\ncharacterize the virtuous lifestyle of the philosopher: in him, in\nfact, theoretical knowledge is the prolegomenon to action, ethics, and\npolitics. For this reason ‘Abd al-Latif stresses that there is\nno difference between a man who lives in ignorance and the life of\nbeasts because in ignorance man acts like a beast. A life in ignorance\nis a life without the search for truth and, hence, inhuman in\nitself. In this perspective ‘Abd al-Latif introduces Plato’s\npolitical philosophy. Since the perfection of the soul is possible\nonly in a city where justice reigns, Plato starts from analysis of\nwhat justice is and how it ought to be. Then Plato examines the cities\nwhich deviate from the good ways of life and from the philosophical\nvirtues. In the virtuous city, man must be educated in the knowledge\nof the divine and natural beings and in following a virtuous way of\nlife. Human perfection is achieved by the man who combines the\ntheoretical, the political and the practical sciences. He will rule\nand will possess the ability to conduct a scientific investigation of\njustice and the other virtues and to form the character of the youth\nand the multitude. He will be able to correct wrong opinions and to\ncure every rank of his society with knowledge. The ruler will be the\none who has achieved human perfection at its utmost. Then ‘Abd al-Latif passes to present al-Farabi’s\nAristotle who holds that the perfection of man sought by Plato is not\nself-evident or easy to explain by way of a demonstration which leads\nto certainty. He believes, therefore, that it is necessary to start\nwith a prior consideration. There are four things which by nature are\ndesired by man in so far as they are good: the soundness of the body,\nof the senses, of the ability to discern that which leads to the\nhealth of the body and the senses, and of the ability to obtain that\nwhich leads to their soundness. In the second place man desires to\nknow the causes of the sensible things and also the causes of what he\nsees in his soul, and he discovers that the more he knows the more he\nfeels pleasure. Thus according to Aristotle, the knowledge sought by\nman can be said to be of two types: the first is a useful knowledge\nsought for the soundness of the body, of the senses, and of the other\ntwo abilities, the second is desired and desirable in itself for the\npleasure that a man experiences in apprehending it: for instance,\nthe myths or the stories of nations. ‘Abd al-Latif goes on by explaining that in human knowledge\nthere are three sorts of cognitions: those acquired by senses,\nfrequently insufficient, those first necessary cognitions that\noriginate with man, and those acquired by investigation and\nconsideration. ‘Abd al-Latif asks himself what type of knowledge\nis most appropriate for man. Animals, too, in fact, have a body,\nsenses, and the ability to discern how and with what to safeguard\ntheir health. They do not, however, possess the desire, provoked by\nwonder, to know the causes of what can be seen in the heavens and on\nearth. This problem involves the following question: why should man ever\ndesire to know the causes if the type of knowledge that they involve\nis not made for him? It is because man can grow in perfection by\nknowing the causes; indeed, knowing the causes is an act of the\nessence of man. Yet this statement opens up a series of problems. What\nis the essence of man, what is his ultimate perfection, what is the\nact whose realization leads to the final perfection of his essence?\nNevertheless, given that man is part of the world, if one wishes to\nknow the end of man and his activity he must first know the world in\nits totality. The four causes of the world in its totality and in each\nof its individual parts which must be sought are the what it is, the\nhow it is, the what it is from, and the what is it for. The investigation which deals with the world, in its totality and\nin each of its individual parts, is called natural investigation,\nwhile that which regards what man possesses by virtue and will is\ncalled the science of the things that depend on the will. Since that\nwhich is natural and innate in man precedes in time that which is in\nman by will and choice, the first type of investigation will precede\nthe second even if both must arrive at a certain science. Besides\nthese two types of research is the art of logic which forms the\nrational part of the soul, leads it to certainty, to study and to\nresearch; logic, moreover, guides and tests the validity of the other\ntwo fields of research. ‘Abd al-Latif reminds that in Aristotle’s science of\nnature the fundamental epistemological criterion holds that man must\nstart from what is attested to by the senses, to then proceed to what\nis hidden, until he knows everything which he desires to know. For\nthis reason, he goes on in the study of plants and then of animals. He\ncatalogues their species, and explains the apparatus of organs which\neach animal species is provided with. Since organs alone are not\nsufficient to explain animal life, man feels the need to introduce a\nfurther principle, which is the soul. Nevertheless, the soul is not a\nprinciple sufficient to explain man, since the actions of man reveal\nthemselves to be more powerful than the acts of the soul. The soul is\nnot enough to explain the highest degree of substantiality reached by\nman: Aristotle found man with speech and speech proceeds from\nintellect or the intellectual principles and powers. The human intellect is in potency and moves to act. All that which\npasses from potency to act necessitates an agent of the same species\nas the thing that must pass on to the act. The intellect as well,\ntherefore, in order to pass from potency to act, needs an active\nintellect which is always in act and never in potency. When\nman’s intellect reaches its extreme perfection, it comes close\nin its substance to the substance of this active intellect. In its\nsearch for perfection, man’s intellect tends to imitate the\nmodel of this intellect, since it is that which makes man substantial\nin so far as he is man. This intellect is also man’s end because\nit is that which provides him with a principle and an example to\nfollow in tending to perfection, which consists in approximating\nhimself as far as it is possible to it. It is therefore his agent, his\nend, and his perfection. It is a principle in three different ways: as\nan agent, as an end, and as the perfection to which man tends. It is,\nhowever, a separate form with respect to man, a separate agent, and a\nseparate end. The result of the enquiry undertaken leads to the conclusion that\nhuman nature, the human soul, and the capabilities and the acts of\nthese two, just like the capabilities of the practical intellect, are\nall finalized with respect to the perfection of the human\nintellect. Nature, the soul, and the human intellect are, however,\ninsufficient to attain perfection and it is not possible to leave out\nof consideration the acts generated by volition and choice which\ndepend on the practical intellect. For this reason, therefore, these\nacts must also become the object of investigation like all that which\nconstitutes human will. Desire and the things, which depend on sense\nand discernment—which the other animals also possess—on\nthe other hand, are neither human, nor useful for attaining\ntheoretical perfection. According to this criterion it is necessary to\nre-examine completely all the scientific fields already established in\nthe search for that which contributes to the attainment of perfection\nby man and that which, on the other hand, impedes this search.  Finally ‘Abd al-Latif mentions the Metaphysics\nsaying that in Aristotle’s Metaphysics beings are\ninvestigated according to a different method from that used in the\nscience of nature. Unlike his Farabian source,\nal-Farabi’s Philosophy of Plato and Aristotle,\n‘ as we know it, Abd al-Latif begins to analyze the metaphysical science which\nhas as its objects of inquiry the divine and noble things. He seems to\nmention the pseudo-Theology of Aristotle, the paraphrastic\nselection from Plotinus’ Enneads (IV to VI) translated\nby ‘Abd al-Masih ibn Nai‘ma al-Himsi and corrected by\nal-Kindi. He states that Aristotle in the Theology (Kitab\nbi-utulugiyya) said that God created the terrestrial world for\nman and also created in man the intellect and dispersed it in his soul\nso that it might be a weapon which strengthens man to make him able to\nlive in the earth (i.e., practical intellect) and to investigate the\ncreation of the heavens and the earth and the wonders which are found\nin the heavens and on the earth (i.e., theoretical intellect). And he\nsays that God is provident and takes care of qualitatively better men\nand inspires them as a result of the mediation of the active intellect\neither through the way of meditation, or through the way of the\neffulgence of soul or through the way of revelation. Of course since men are different there are different forms of\nassent to the truth: the absolute certainty of the man who follows the\ndemonstrative way as indicated by Aristotle in the Posterior\nAnalytics and the persuasion produced by examples and images as\nindicated by Aristotle in the Rhetoric and\nthe Poetics. Hence, philosophy comes into being in every man\nin the way that is possible for him.  For ‘Abd al-Latif, Plato and his disciple Aristotle pursue\nthe same purpose and the same end in their philosophical speculation,\nthat is to say, the perfection of man as man, which both identify in\nknowledge of the truth of things. Moreover, they describe a system so\nperfect in its organic constitution and completeness that the\ngenerations following them are left with nothing but the task of\nstudying it in an attempt to understand their thought correctly. The\nexceptional nature of Plato and Aristotle’s philosophy, says\n‘Abd al-Latif, has three causes: first, their philosophy is\nuseful in motivating one to study, second, for a long time they had\ninfluence in this field, and third, the absolute primacy of their\nphilosophy lies in their research into the causes from the more\ndistant to the closest to the object. This method of inquiry does not\nneed anything else and it is impossible to confute. It is therefore a\ngreat mistake to believe that the works of the Moderns are clearer,\nmore useful, or qualitatively superior with respect to those of the\nAncients. Abd al-Latif constantly held authors defined by him as\nModerns distinct from the Ancients and he unleashed a\nharsh polemic attack against the works of the former. His privileged\ntargets were Avicenna and Fakhr al-Din al-Razi whom he considered, as\nfar as it was possible, even worse than Avicenna. The writings of\nthese authors in fact, if compared with those of the Ancients, reveal\ntheir low scientific level, are confused, and lack detailed\nanalysis. ‘Abd al-Latif makes a series of criticisms on\nAvicenna’s philosophy (Martini Bonadeo 2013; Ben Ahmed 2019). In the first\nplace, he explains that Avicenna did not manage to present an\nexhaustive philosophical system in which every field of philosophical\nresearch could receive adequate treatment. ‘Abd al-Latif\ncriticizes Avicenna’s lack of reflection on the practical\nfield. Even in his most famous summa, the Kitab\nal-Shifa’, Avicenna neglected the contents of\nPlato’s Republic, Aristotle’s Ethics,\nand his Politics. ‘Abd al-Latif explains this omission\nas a total lack of familiarity by Avicenna not only of practical\nphilosophy, but also of philosophy in general. In the second place, according to ‘Abd al-Latif, Avicenna\nseems to have distorted or not to have had any knowledge of the\nfundamental Aristotelian epistemological criterion according to which\nresearch must begin with that which is more easily knowable to us\n(cf. Aristotle, Physics I.1, 184a16–21; Nicomachean\nEthics I.4, 1095b3–4). This is why, for example Avicenna\nmistakenly placed zoology after his treatment of the soul. Next, ‘Abd al-Latif points out that Avicenna has produced\nnumerous works, which have been copied from one another, as in the\ncase of the Kitab al-Shifa’ and the Kitab\nal-Najat. He observes that Avicenna decided to introduce all his\ntreatises with the discourse presented by Aristotle at the beginning\nof the Posterior Analytics (ll, 71a1–3) on every form\nof knowledge. But this is all that Avicenna knows of the Posterior\nAnalytics. In fact, he has not dealt with what constitutes the\nend of logic, that is to say, the five logical arts which are the\nobject of the Posterior Analytics, the Topics,\nthe Sophistical Refutations, the Rhetoric, and\nthe Poetics, and he has dwelt on an analysis of the contents of\nthe Isagoge, Categories, De Interpretatione\nand Prior Analytics which, according to ‘Abd al-Latif,\nconstitute a preparatory introduction to true logic. Even\nthe Kitab al-Shifa’, which deals with logic at greater\nlength, presents a confused discourse. ‘Abd al-Latif provides\nexamples which strengthen his strong criticism. In the first place it\nis surprising to him that Avicenna has not clarified the category of\n“having” (ἔχειν; for\nits Arabic translations see Afnan 1964: 89–90). But, in fact, in\nthe section on the categories (al-Maqulat) of the Kitab\nal-Shifa’, Avicenna devotes few words to his explanation of\nthe meaning and the value of this category. He maintains that it is\nnot a clear category and recognizes that he has not managed to\nunderstand it because he does not see how it can contain\nspecies. Moreover, ‘Abd al-Latif is amazed by the fact that\nAvicenna places the movement of the sky in the category of\n“Being-in-a-position”\n(κεῖσθαι), even\nthough he himself has written a book on the De Caelo et mundo\nand on the Physics. The category\nof κεῖσθαι is\nexplained by Avicenna both in the Kitab al-Shifa’ and\nthe Kitab al-Najat as the manner of being of the body in as\nfar as the fact that its parts constitute, one with another, a\nrelation of inclination and parallelism in relation to the directions\nand the parts of the place, if the body is in a place, such as, for\nexample standing up and sitting down. ‘Abd al-Latif’s\nthird criticism is of Avicenna’s claim that he can define one of\ntwo relative terms without having recourse to the other. ‘Abd\nal-Latif stresses that in the Isagoge Avicenna defines genus\nseparately and species separately and father separately and son\nseparately. Then in his definition of father as a “living thing\nwhich creates from his sperm another living thing similar to\nhim” Avicenna finds himself obliged to seek recourse to four\ndistinct relations. ‘Abd al-Latif proceeds to criticize Avicenna’s theory\nof the syllogism and in particular his admission of the hypothetical\nsyllogisms. Finally, ‘Abd al-Latif makes a series of further\ncriticisms of Avicenna without, however, going into each of them in\ndetail. Avicenna has enlarged the book of the Poetics with an\namount of material which actually derives from\nthe Rhetoric. Since Avicenna’s Kitab\nal-Shifa’, despite its numerous errors, has become the\nphilosophical encyclopedia of reference among ‘Abd\nal-Latif’s contemporaries, he believes that Avicenna is the\nindirect cause of the vast spread of philosophical errors, such as the\nconfusing, for example, the object proper to the Physics,\nthat is, nature, with that of the Metaphysics. ‘Abd al-Latif presents two sets of reasons why\nal-Razi‘s works, full of errors, should not be the object of\npeople’s admiration. In the first place this writer does not\npossess a specific technical knowledge of the various sciences which\nhe has decided to consider: his use of the medical terminology is\ninaccurate, for example, in his notes on\nAvicenna’s Canon. In the second place, since he lacks\nany didactic method, he simply raises continual sophisms. For these\nreasons, ‘Abd al-Latif maintains that he should not even try to\ntake on the holy text of the Koran as he did in his\ncommentary on sura 112 or on sura 95 and sura 87 (Gannagé 2011:\n227–256; Stern 1962: 57–59).  In the twenty-four chapters of his Book on the Science of\nMetaphysics ‘Abd al-Latif paraphrases and summarizes a sort\nof “library” of treatises on metaphysics (Zimmermann 1986)\nwhich were assimilated in the formative period of falsafa and\nimposed themselves to the point of becoming canonical. The editorial\nplan of the Book on the Science of Metaphysics follows the\nordering of the metaphysical and divine science according to\nal-Farabi’s Enumeration of the Sciences. It consists in\nfact of three distinct parts which reflect al-Farabi’s\ntripartite division: in the first part, which includes the first four\nchapters, there is the study of beings and their accidents; the second\npart, which goes from chapter five to chapter twelve, deals with the\nprinciples of definition and demonstration; the third and last part,\ncomprising chapters thirteen to twenty-four, is devoted to a\ndescription of the hierarchy of the immaterial and intelligible\nrealities until it reaches the First Mover, the First Principle, the\nFirst Cause, the One, which is nothing but the one God of\nthe Koran, the provident Creator, in a synthesis of\nAristotelian metaphysics, Neoplatonic metaphysics, and Islamic\nmonotheism (Neuwirth 1976). ‘Abd al-Latif devotes a full sixteen out of twenty-four\nchapters to a discussion of Aristotle’s Metaphysics,\nwhich he probably knew in more than one translation. The books\nof the Metaphysics he freely paraphrases are, in\norder, Alpha Elatton/Alpha\nMeizon, Beta, Delta, Gamma, \nEpsilon, Zeta, Eta, Theta, Iota,\nand Lambda (Neuwirth 1976, 1977–78; Martini Bonadeo\n2001, 2010, 2013, 2018; Ajoun 2017). Three whole chapters (13–15) are devoted to the\nlatter one. ‘Abd al-Latif is strongly influenced by\nThemistius’ paraphrase (Brague 1999) in his reading\nof Lambda. The presentation of Lambda ends with an\nentire chapter (16) containing an epitome of Alexander Arabus’s\ntreatise On the principles of the Universe (Badawi 1947;\nGenequand 2001; Endress 2002; Ajoun 2017). ‘Abd al-Latif’s use of\nthe Metaphysics reflects that of its first Arabic\ninterpreters, in particular al-Kindi, who centered on the contents of\nbooks Alpha Elatton, Epsilon, and Lambda\nand was tied to the criterion of the doctrinal unity of Greek\nmetaphysics: the natural theology of Lambda is only a premise\nfor a characterization of the First Principle, which is of clear\nNeoplatonic origin (D’Ancona 1996). This is particularly clear from the very beginning of the Book\non the Science of Metaphysics. For ‘Abd al-Latif, in fact,\nthere are different causes for different kinds of being and different\nsciences for different causes, but there is one first science leading\nall the others, for two different reasons. First, as al-Farabi taught,\nit is able to demonstrate the principles of the other sciences,\nbecause it is only this science, which investigates absolute beings\nand from them it provides an explanation of the principles of the\nparticular sciences, comprised in it and below it. Second, this\nscience includes speculation about the First Principle, which every\nother thing needs in its own existence. ‘Abd al-Latif claims\nthat this First Principle is the absolute final cause and that the\nscience of this cause is the wisdom (hikma) which precedes\nall other knowledge (Martini Bonadeo 2010; 2017a). The First Principle is described by ‘Abd al-Latif in a\ntypical Avicennian phrase as the Pure Being (al-wujud\nal-mujarrad), the aim of everything, and the First mover\nimmobile, pure act, eternal and everlasting, i.e., the First Principle whose\nknowledge is the end of our inquiry. The First mover not only produces the movement of the things, but it is their perfection, namely the paradigmatic cause, and their final cause. Abd al-Latif introduces the example of the law, which he derives from Themistius' paraphrase. The law moves politics in so far as it is chosen for itself. The First Principle, as God, is the cause for being of the worlds and their ordering according to their beauty and their duration and it is a substance which equals his science. The First Principle is also\ndescribed as the True One (al-wahid al-haqq), one by\nessence, without any kind of multiplicity. The way to know this True\nOne is to ascend from the things which have some degree of unity. So\nwe say one army, one city, that Zayd is one, that the\ncelestial sphere is one, and that the world is one. Then we proceed\nthrough souls and intellects, and through the things which in this\nascent loose multiplicity and acquire unity until we reach the\nAbsolute One (al-wahid al-mutlaq), the architectural\nprinciple of everything and the supreme intelligible which makes the\nworld be, preserves its existence, and orders it. The First Cause is\nfor ‘Abd al-Latif that cause which has within it all things in\npurely Neoplatonic vein. It is not surprising therefore that in\nparaphrasing chapter 10 of Lambda he speaks of emanation from\nthe First Principle. The characteristics of the Neoplatonic One are thus grafted onto\nthe Aristotelian characterization of the First Principle. The point of\nfusion lies in the doctrine of the self-reflection of divine thought,\nwhich for ‘Abd al-Latif, who is influenced by the exegesis of\nThemistius, is not a reason for composition and multiplicity within\nthe First Principle, as it was for Plotinus. If the thinking\nprinciple, the act of thinking and the object of thought coincide in\nthe First Principle, which by now is called God, there is in It no\nmultiplicity. The exposition of Lambda is followed by three chapters\nwhich discuss the theme of Providence\n(πρόνοια) of the First\nPrinciple. ‘Abd al-Latif’s main source is Alexander of\nAphrodisias’ De Providentia (Ruland 1976, 1979;\nZimmermann 1986; Thillet 2003; Martini Bonadeo 2017a). ‘Abd al-Latif therefore mutually\nharmonizes two solutions which are in reality quite different from one\nanother, not to say alternative: that put forward by Alexander\nregarding the problem of divine providence—the First Principle\nthinks and knows primarily only itself, but it eternally knows the\nevents of the world too, subject to becoming, in so far as it\nexercises its own direction over them through the celestial\norder—and that of Themistius, which ‘Abd al-Latif had\nalready made his own in the course of his paraphrase\nof Lambda, whereby God knows that which is different from him\nwithout for this reason coming out of himself, since he contains in\nhim all the ideas of all things, and is the norm and the condition of\nthe intelligibility of the world. ‘Abd al-Latif maintains that the action of God’s\nprovidence expresses itself both in the superior and in the inferior\nworld; but if in the first case the relationship between divine\nprovidence and the superior world is immediate, in the second case it\nis mediated by the superior world. The relationship between divine\nprovidence and those who receive it, however, cannot be thought of as\na causal relationship, since in this case “the noble would come\ninto being because of the ignoble and the earlier because of the\nlater” (Rosenthal 1975: 156), which is shameful, nor can this\nrelationship be thought as purely accidental. Both situations are\nunsuitable for the First Principle, which cannot therefore exercise\nprovidence as its primary action, but cannot either be considered as\nthat from which providence derives accidentally. ‘Abd al-Latif\nthen affirms that the existence and the order of things derive from\nthe existence of God, who is absolute good and returns to the image of\nfire which warms everything: God concedes to all existing things as\nmuch good as they, for their proximity to him, are able to\nreceive. The bodies of the sublunary world are able to enjoy the\npotency which emanates from God and so they tend to move towards\nhim. Among the existing things of the sublunary world, man has been\ngiven the capacity for reason, due to which he can carry out those\nactions that lead him to acquire the happiness appropriate to him. The\nsame rational capacity allows him to know divine things and, in virtue\nof this knowledge, man is superior to all other things that come to\nbeing and pass away. At times, however, he uses this rational capacity\nto obtain, not the good and virtues, but vices. This can happen\nbecause providence allows man the capacity to be able to acquire\nvirtues, but the success of this enterprise lies in the will and in\nthe choice made by man himself. Following the lead of Alexander’s treatise On\nProvidence, ‘Abd al-Latif introduces the problem of evil\nand places his examination of those aspects of the doctrine of\nprovidence that regard man and his actions within the framework of a\ndiscussion more of a cosmological nature. For this reason, though he\nfavours Themistius’ solution whereby God knows all things in\nthat he contains within him the ideas of all things, which he holds to\nbe closest to the dogma of the Koran, ‘Abd al-Latif has recourse\nto Alexander concerning the problems of evil, man’s free will,\nand divine justice.  ‘Abd al-Latif then proceeds in his treatise by epitomizing\nthe Book of the Exposition of the Pure Good, that is to say,\nthe Liber de causis of the Latin Middle Ages, proposition\n54, on the difference between eternity and time (Endress 1973; Jolivet\n1979: 55–75; Zimmermann 1994: 9–51) from\nProclus’ Elements of Theology, Metaphysics Lambda, and the pseudo-Theology (Martini Bonadeo 2017b, Ajoun 2017). ‘Abd al-Latif\nreproduces all the propositions of the Liber de causis,\nexcept numbers 4, 10, 18, and 20, and follows the same order in which\nthey are set out (Badawi 1955b; Anawati 1956: 73–110; Taylor\n1984: 236–248). Abd al-Latif's aim is to establish, on a Farabian model, an identification between the First Cause, One and Pure Good, as presented in the Liber de causis and the Aristotelian First Principle, Unmoved Mover and Intellect in actuality, described in his paraphrase of Metaphysics Lambda. \n  Abd al-Latif stresses the primacy of the most universal\ncause, which is, therefore, further from its effect with respect to\nthe causes nearer to the effect and hence apparently more\nimportant. The First Cause transcends any possibility of our knowledge. If\nknowing the true nature of things in fact means knowing their causes,\nsince by definition the First Cause has no causes that precede it, it\nis unknowable in its true nature. It can only be known by\napproximation, through a description of the secondary causes. A long\nsection, which describes intellect, follows this theory of the\ntranscendent ineffability of the First Cause which precludes any\nproper predication. The intellect is with eternity, above time, and is\nnot subject to division, because everything which is divisible is\ndivisible in magnitude, in number, or in motion, but all these kinds\nof division are under time. It is one, in so far as it is the first\nthing which originated from the First Cause, but it is multiple with\nrespect to the multiplicity of the gifts that come to it from the\nFirst Cause. The intellect knows what is above it—the gifts that\ncome to it from the First Cause—and what is below it—the\nthings of which it is the cause. But intellect knows its cause and its\neffect through its substance, that is to say that it perceives things\nintellectually. It grasps intellectually either the intellectual\nthings or the sensible ones. The First Cause, which is the Pure Good,\npours all that is good into the intellect and into all that which\nexists through the mediation of the intellect. There is, however, a\ncertain fluctuation in ‘Abd al-Latif’s attempt to\nestablish a perfect conformity between the First Cause as presented in\nthe Liber de causis and the First Principle presented in his\nchapters devoted to the paraphrase of Metaphysics\nLambda. According to ‘Abd al-Latif God precedes the\nintellect in ruling things: he orders the intellect to govern. But,\nhaving stated that the self-subsistent substance is not generated from\nsomething else, ‘Abd al-Latif maintains that intellect does not\nneed anything other than itself in its conceptualizing and formation\n(tasawwuri-hi wa taswiri-hi), that it is perfect and complete\neternally, and that it is the cause of itself. At this point ‘Abd al-Latif introduces the description of the\nScience of Sovereignty (‘ilm al-rububiyya) which echoes\nthat of the first chapter in the Theology of Aristotle: it is\nnot a physical science that limits itself to ascend from effects to\ncauses, but a science which, when it comes close to causes, is able to\ngo back to consider the effects in greater depth approaching the\ndivine knowledge of things. Moreover, ‘Abd al-Latif summarizes in the contents, but not\nin the order, a selection of twenty propositions of Proclus\n(1–3, 5, 62, 86, 15–17, 21, 54, 76, 78, 91, 79, 80, 167,\nand 72–74: see Zimmermann 1986), four quaestiones of Alexander\nof Aphrodisias (Van Ess 1966; Fazzo & Wiesner 1993) and the\nadaptation of John Philoponus’ De aeternitate mundi contra\nProclum IX,8 and IX,11 (Hasnawi 1994), entitled What\nAlexander of Aphrodisias Extracted from the Book of Aristotle Called\nTheology, Namely the Doctrine of Divine Sovereignty (Endress\n1973). In doing that ‘Abd al-Latif sets for himself three\nobjectives. In the first place, he wants to stress the crucial aspects\nof the doctrine of the First Cause understood as One, presented in the\nprevious chapters. In the second place, he discusses the relationship\nbetween the One and the many, and, not by chance, he does so after a\nseries of chapters (16–20) devoted to the relationship between\nthe First Cause and the world. As for these two objectives, he\nstresses the basic features of the First Cause: it is One and it gives\nunity to that which is multiple; it is One in itself and the True One\nwithout composition; it is the cause of all that which is multiple in\nthat, although it is by essence One, its causal action propagates in a\nmultiplicity of effects; it is above eternity and time; it is life\nthat does not end, light that does not extinguish, it is Pure Being,\nit is the first agent, it is ineffable and nothing can be properly\npredicated of it, it is unknowable, the apex of the hierarchy of being\nwhich is composed of the intellect, intelligible realities, the Soul,\nthe souls, and, finally, the corporeal realities of nature. Then he\nturns to the providence of the First Cause with regard to its effects:\nthis providence exists, is mediated by the spheres and preserves the\nspecies on earth. The divine power acts upon the sublunary world by\ncontact, and, starting from the first sphere of fire, the divine power\nis in matter according to the receptivity of the various matters. ‘Abd al-Latif ends his presentation of the metaphysical\nscience by summarizing the text of the pseudo-Theology from\nchapter 2 to chapter 10 (chapter nine is not included), more or less\nliterally (Badawi 1955a, Ajoun 2017). Through the\npseudo-Theology—as we have seen before, an item of the\nArabic Plotinus—‘Abd al-Latif was exposed to a Neoplatonic\ndoctrine on the causality of the Platonic ideas which took into\naccount the Aristotelian themes of the immobile causality of the First\nMover and the coincidence of the nature of what is the supreme\nintelligent and what is the supreme intelligible. ‘Abd al-Latif\nwrites about the First Principle, True One, and Creator, which is\nknown only through imperfect images and which is infinite in its\nessence, the process of emanation and the hierarchy from the First\nPrinciple to the word of coming to be, the nature and movement of the\ncelestial bodies which move out of the desire to imitate the\nperfection of the First Unmoved Mover and to assimilate themselves to\nthe Pure Good to the extent to which they are capable; the movement of\nthe first sphere and the life in the world of coming to be; the\nontological anteriority of the First Cause with respect to the\nproximate causes, the ascent of human soul from sensible to\nintellectual knowledge up to the First Principle, which is true\nintellect, true being, true perfection, true science and true\nsubstance. At the end he deals with the limits of our senses and of\nthe human intellect in understanding the First Cause and the others\nseparate beings: our intellect is weak in understanding concepts such\nas movement, time, matter, privation, and possibility, and it can\nattain them only through analogies and long meditation. Moreover, for\nour intellect the First Principle is the condition of knowing without\nbeing known by us, as the sun is the condition of our vision even\nthough we cannot bear the direct sight of it. The Book on the\nScience of Metaphysics ends with the announcement of a treatise\non political philosophy to follow, entitled The Conditions of the\nPerfect State and its Consequences: if people are educated to\ngrew up in virtues, it will be possible to realize al-madina\nal-fadila, the Farabian perfect state. This overview of the reception and use of the Greek and Arabic\nsources by ‘Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi in his Book on the\nScience of Metaphysics proves that, in the framework of\nal-Farabi’s awareness of the manifold nature of\nmetaphysics—ontology, knowledge of causes, universal science,\nand divine science or theology—the return to the Ancients, and\nto Aristotle, declared by ‘Abd al-Latif to be necessary in his\nbiography, was certainly not a return to the Aristotle of the Greek\nsources, linguistic access to which had by that time been lost for a\ncouple of centuries. Rather it was a return to the Aristotle of his\nown tradition: that strongly Neoplatonized Aristotle of the origins of\nthe Kindian falsafa. ‘Abd al-Latif’s treatise on\nmetaphysics is in fact deeply rooted in the whole set of Greek works\non first philosophy that had been translated or paraphrased into\nArabic under the impulse and direction of al-Kindi: in al-Kindi as in\n‘Abd al-Latif’s project where the knowledge of the causes\ncomes to coincide with a natural theology that investigates the First\nPrinciple, the De Providentia of Alexander of Aphrodisias, Proclus’ Elements of\nTheology, and the last three of Plotinus’ Enneads\nconstitute a natural development of book Lambda of\nthe Metaphysics. ‘Abd al-Latif’s attitude towards contemporary medicine\nand the practice of alchemy helps us understand his consideration for\nthe epistemology of the sciences, which must be based on universal\ngrounds as that of the Ancients, and it explains once more the primacy\n‘Abd al-Latif assigns to the philosophy of the Greeks which he\nconsidered the right way of thinking and therefore of acting. ‘Abd al-Latif in the first part of his above mentioned\nautobiographical work (Joosse 2011, 2014) focuses on the\nepistemological status of the art of medicine using different\ncomparisons which seem to be in contradiction: medicine is like both\nmathematics and the art of archery (Joosse & Pormann\n2008). Medicine is an art concerned with universals. For this reason\nit does not make errors. Mathematics is also a science which considers\nabstract concepts, but even in this theoretical science approximation\noccurs (the examples are that of the impossibility of squaring a\ncircle and the approximation in writing an irrational\nnumber). Concerning the physicians, they are like the expert in the\nart of archery “who hits the mark in most cases” (Joosse\n2014: 66), but they can make mistakes because they are concerned with\nparticulars. Good physicians, even if they do not hit the target, do\nnot miss it entirely. For ‘Abd al-Latif his contemporaries are\nlike those whose arrows which do not hit the targets, but on the\ncontrary, fall in the opposite direction (Joosse & Pormann\n2010). The pitiful state of contemporary medicine, in contrast to the\nmedicine of the Ancients Hippocrates, Dioscorides and Galen, is caused\nfirst of all because the contemporaries do not follow a medical\nepistemology. ‘Abd al-Latif observes that, even in antiquity,\nmedical sects had existed which taught false medicine. ‘Abd\nal-Latif recalls, in particular, the Empirical and Methodist sects\nwhich were in opposition to the Dogmatic or Rationalist one, according\nto the classic tripartite division of medical schools which were known\nto Arabic authors due precisely to the Arabic translation of many\nintroductory works by Galen and pseudo-Galen. The Empirical sect of\nSceptical inspiration, in fact, was neither concerned to study the\nanatomical structure of the human body nor the internal secrets of\nillnesses. It rejected any possible analogy between the dead body and\nthe living body. It denied any general theory. The medicine which it\ntaught, therefore, translated itself into a medical practice totally\nalien to the anatomic-physiological basis of symptoms and was wholly\nlinked to clinical phenomena and the classification of symptoms and\nmedicines. The Methodist sect of Stoic and Epicurean inspiration, for\nwhich human life was the natural place for moral and physical\nsuffering, held that the human body was formed of atoms which could\nnot be perceived by the senses and which were in continual movement\nthrough pores and channels. According to this sect, illness came about\nin the case of an alteration in the quality and the movement of the\ncorpuscles or in the case of an excessive tightening or relaxing of\nthe pores through which the atoms moved. Therapy, therefore, was\nreduced to baths designed to provoke sweat in cases of the tightening\nof the pores and astringents and tonics in the case of dilation, in\norder to return to an intermediate perviousness. ‘Abd al-Latif\nholds that the above sects are far removed from the medicine practiced\nby the Dogmatic doctors of Platonic and Aristotelian inspiration who\nconsidered anatomy and physiology to be the basic sciences and for\nwhom the detailed study of the internal causes of an illness was\nprimary and necessary. Nevertheless, the criteria followed by the\nEmpirical and the Methodist sects were thus far scientific: the\nphysicians followed a theory and did not proceed by pure and simple\nsupposition, as most contemporary physicians did (Joosse & Pormann\n2010). In ‘Abd al-Latif’s opinion, the medicine of his age\nmust rediscover and apply Greek medicine with its principles,\ndescriptions of diseases, and therapies. Greek theoretical medicine is\nconcerned with universals and is founded on the ground of universal\nprinciples which are valid everywhere. In this respect, according to\nhim, Greek medicine is far superior to his contemporaries’\npractice and must be learned by the physicians of his age according to\nthe principle of accumulation of knowledge which also guides\n‘Abd al-Latif’s philosophical project.  ‘Abd al-Latif was profoundly averse to alchemy, which was\nmuch in vogue in his time (Wiedeman 1907; Joosse 2008, 2014:\n29–62). It can in no way be placed in the system of the\nsciences. It is a complete fraud: the false alchemists are all engaged\nin the production of elixirs or the “Philosophers’\nstone”. They believe in the substantial transmutation of metals and\nthought that the “differentia specifica” of metals could\nbe produced during an artificial process, which in the end would\nalways lead to the transformation of lead and other base metals into\nprecious metals gold and silver. (Joosse 2008: 304) Alchemy and its false presumptions must be distinguished from\nscientific knowledge, such as mathematics, mineralogy, chemistry,\nzoology, and botany. Proof of this is that the Ancients never spoke of\nit: Pythagoras has not devoted a treatise to it, Plato and Aristotle\nnever speak of it, and thus neither do the Greek commentators after\nthem. There is not a single word on alchemy in all of Galen’s\nvoluminous works, nor in that of John Philoponus. In the Islamic age\nal-Jahiz, Hunayn ibn Ishaq, his son Ishaq, his grandson Hunayn,\nAbu Bishr Matta, and Abu al-Faraj ibn al-Tayyib keep all silent on the\nsubject. The father of this false science would seem to have been\nJabir ibn Hayyan who has turned generations of students after him\nastray. Al-Farabi, the greatest Islamic philosopher, mentions elixirs\n(al-iksir) in a highly negative way only once. Even Avicenna,\nin his treatise on alchemy does not give this art a rational\nbasis. Alchemy is guilty of having waylaid generations of\nscholars. ‘Abd al-Latif’s life and works testifies the crucial\nrole played by many Muslim men of learning and science, who attended\nthe milieus of the Islamic schools between the 12th and\n13th centuries, in the transmission of the Greek\nphilosophical and medical knowledge, still perceived as essential to\nthe training of the learned Muslim.","contact.mail":"cecilia.martini@unipd.it","contact.domain":"unipd.it"}]
