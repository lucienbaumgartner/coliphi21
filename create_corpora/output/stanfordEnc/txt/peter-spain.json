His works\non logic are typical examples of the type of manuals that gradually\nstarted to emerge within the context of twelfth- and\nthirteenth-century teaching practices. Until recently he was also\nidentified as the author of a number of extant works on medicine. \n\nPeter of Spain has been established as the medieval author of a work\nthat became widely known as Summule logicales magistri Petri\nHispani (Collection of Logic Matters of Master Peter of Spain).\nThe great number of manuscripts and printed editions is evidence of\nthe enormous success this work met with throughout European\nuniversities well into the seventeenth century. An interpolated\nversion of his Tractatus, by then known as the Summulae\nlogicales, was used by John Buridan as a basic text to comment\nupon. But finding out the true identity of the author of this\ninfluential Tractatus has proved to be a difficult task. For\na long time it was assumed that he was a Portuguese who became Pope in\n1276, under the name of John XXI. There is also another, earlier\ntradition, according to which the author of the Tractatus was\nregarded as Spanish, and a member of the Dominican order. Yet another\nattribution, dating from the fifteenth century, was to a Petrus\nFerrandi Hispanus, who died between 1254 and 1259; this attribution\nwould be consistent with the idea that Peter’s works on logic\noriginated from the first half of the thirteenth century. According to\nstill another attribution, the Summule was compiled by a\nBlack Friar no earlier than in the late thirteenth or early fourteenth\ncentury. \nThe ‘Dominican-thesis’ can be divided into three\ntraditions: \nCurrent research on the identity of Peter of Spain has once again\ntaken up the idea that he must have been a member of the Dominican\nOrder instead of Pope John XXI (D’Ors 1997, 2001, 2003).\nHowever, we are still in the dark about the true identity of Peter of\nSpain. The most recent information we have on this score is that a\nnumber of the Dominican candidates recently suggested as the author of\nthe Tractatus can be deleted from the list (Tugwell 1999,\n2006). The lack of further information also makes it difficult to\nestablish the dates and specifics of his carreer. \nIt is still not possible to establish the date of origin of the\nTractatus, the work that has enjoyed such enormous success.\nRecent scholarship suggests that it could have been written any time\nbetween the 1220s and the 1250s (Ebbessen 2013, 68–69). It has\nuniversally been recognised as a work by Peter of Spain. Another work\nthat has been identified as Peter of Spain’s is a\nSyncategoreumata (Treatise on Syncategorematic Words), which\nwas probably written some years after the\n Tractatus.[2]\n Considering the fact that in all the thirteenth-century manuscripts\nthe Syncategoreumata directly follow the Tractatus,\nand the number of similarities between doctrinal aspects of these two\nworks on logic, it is almost certain that they were written by the\nsame author. Both works seem to have originated from Southern France\nor Northern Spain, the region where we also find the earliest\ncommentaries on these treatises. \nBesides these works on logic, there are other works that have been\nwritten by a Peter of Spain. In the Petrus Hispanus papa\ntradition, he is the supposed author of a famous medical work\nThesaurus pauperum, as well as fourteen other works on\nmedicine. Other writings by (a) Peter of Spain include a Scientia\nlibri de anima, and commentaries on Aristotle’s De\nanima, De morte et vita, De sensu et sensato,\nDe\n animalibus,[3.]\n and commentaries on works by pseudo-Denys the Areopagite. As yet\nthere is no certainty about whether the Peter of Spain who wrote these\ntreatises is the author of the Tractatus and the\nSyncategoreumata, or about the dates of their origin. \nAnother Peter of Spain, referred to as Petrus Hispanus\nnon-papa, has been identified as the author of the Summa\n‘Absoluta cuiuslibet’, a late twelfth-century\nhandbook on syntax closely linked with Priscian’s\nInstitutiones grammatice, libb. XVII and XVIII, which became\nvery popular later in the Middle Ages under the name Priscianus\nminor (Kneepkens 1987). The chronology of this work seems to rule\nout that this Peter of Spain is the same author as the author of the\nTractatus. \nPeter’s logic seems to have its origin in the continental\ntradition. Evidence of the educational carreer of the\nTractatus appears from two\n commentaries,[4]\n which contain short lemmata and a number of questions\n(questiones) together with their solutions. The tracts as\ncontained in these texts are very similar to the ones in the\nTractatus. The Tractatus has features that are\ntypical of the Paris tradition, such as the separate treatment of\nampliation, restriction and distribution, as well as several other,\ndoctrinal\n elements.[5]\n We do not know whether Peter had any connection with Paris, nor can\nwe say anything definitive about the identity of Peter of\nSpain’s teachers. Earlier sources for Peter’s works on\nlogic can be traced back to Boethian-Aristotelian logic, and\nauthorities in the field of grammar such as Priscian and Donatus. \nLike the Tractatus, the Syncategoreumata also\ndisplays a continental origin, and appears to have continued along the\nlines of a similar work by Johannes Pagus (which has been dated\nbetween 1225 and 1235), later on further developed by Nicholas of\nParis, who wrote his Syncategoreumata between 1240 and 1250\n(see Braakhuis 1979, Vol. I, p. 248). \nThe Tractatus can be divided into two main parts. One part\ndeals with doctrines found in the so-called logica\nantiquorum—i.e., the logica vetus (old logic) and\nlogica nova (new logic)—and the other contains\ndoctrines covered by the logica modernorum—viz. the\ntracts that discuss the proprietates terminorum (properties\nof terms). \nThe first main part of the Tractatus divides into five\ntracts. The first tract, De introductionibus (On introductory\ntopics) explains the concepts used in traditional\nlogic—nomen (noun), verbum (verb),\noratio (phrase), propositio (proposition)—and\npresents the divisions of and the (logical) relationships between\npropositions. The second tract, De predicabilibus (On the\npredicables) covers matters dealt with in Boethius’s accounts of\nPorphyry’s Isagoge. It gives an account of the concept\npredicabile and the five predicables—genus,\nspecies, differentia, proprium,\naccidens—i.e., the common features of and differences\nbetween the predicables, as well as of the terms\n‘predicatio’ and\n‘denominativum’. Tract three, De\npredicamentis (On the categories), discusses the ten Aristotelian\ncategories, as well as some items already dealt with in the previous\ntreatise. The fourth tract, De sillogismis (On syllogisms)\nmainly goes back to Boethius’s De syllogismis\ncategoricis (On categorical syllogisms). It gives an explanation\nof the basic element of the syllogism, i.e., propositio, and\nof the syllogism, and then goes into mood and figure, the proper forms\nof syllogisms, and briefly deals with what are called paralogisms. The\nfifth tract, De locis (On topical relationships), is derived\nfrom Boethius’s De topicis differentiis (On different\ntopical relationships) I and II. This tract starts off with an\nexplanation of the notions argumentum and\nargumentatio, and then proceeds to deal with the species of\nargumentation: syllogism, induction, enthymeme, and example. Next, it\ngives a definition of locus (the Latin translation of the\nGreek topos): a locus is the seat of an argument\n(i.e., the locus is supposed to warrant the inference by\nbringing it under some generic rule.) The intrinsic loci (=\nthe kind of locus that occurs when the argument is derived\nfrom the substance of the thing involved) are covered first, followed\nby the extrinsic loci (= the kind of locus that\noccurs when the argument is derived from something that is completely\nseparate from the substance of the thing involved) and intermediary\nloci (= the kind of locus that occurs when the\nargument is taken from the things that partly share in the terms of\nthe problem and partly differ from it). Examples are:\nintrinsic—the locus “from definition”:\n‘a rational animal is running; therefore a man is\nrunning’; extrinsic—the locus “from\nopposites”: ‘Socrates is black; therefore he is not\nwhite’; intermediary—‘the just is good; therefore\njustice is good’. \nThe second part of the Tractatus comprises subjects that were\nof major importance in the doctrine of the properties of terms. In the\nsixth tract, De suppositionibus, the theory of supposition is\ndealt with. The treatise begins with an exposition of\nsignificatio. The definition of significatio runs:\nsignificatio is the respresentation of a thing by means of a\nword in accordance with convention. Next it gives a definition of the\nrelated terms suppositio and copulatio, and the\ndifferences between the terms significatio,\nsuppositio and copulatio. Of these three\nsuppositio and significatio are the most important\nin Peter’s semantics. Suppositio is defined as the\nacceptance of a substantive verb for some thing. Suppositio\nis dependent on significatio, because supposition can only\noccur via a term that already has some significatio. Put in\nother words, significatio pertains to a word by itself, and\nsupposition to a term as actually used in some context. \nThe tract concludes with a division of suppositio. The first\ndivision is into suppositio communis (common supposition) and\nsuppositio discreta (discrete supposition)—e.g., the\nterms homo (man) and Sortes (Socrates)\nrespectively. \nThe second division, suppositio communis, is divided into\nnaturalis (natural) and accidentalis (coincidental).\nSuppositio naturalis is described as the acceptance of a\ncommon term for all those things that can share in the common\nuniversal nature signified by the term in question—e.g.,\nhomo (‘man’) taken by itself by its very nature\nis able to stand for all men, whether in the past, present or future;\nsuppositio accidentalis is the acceptance of a common term\nfor those things for which the term in question requires an additional\nterm—e.g., in homo est (‘A man is’) the\nterm homo stands for present men, whereas in homo\nfuit (‘A man has been’) and in homo erit\n(‘A man will be’) it stands for past men and future men\nrespectively, owing to the additional terms fuit and\nerit. \nThe third division, suppositio accidentalis, is divided into\nsuppositio simplex (simple supposition) and suppositio\npersonalis (personal supposition). Suppositio simplex is\nthe acceptance of a term for the universal ‘thing’ it\nsignifies, as in homo est species (‘Man is a\nspecies’, animal est genus (‘Animal is a\ngenus’), in which the substantive terms homo and\nanimal stand for the universal man and animal, and not any\none of their particulars. Suppositio simplex can occur both\nin the subject- and in the predicate-term—e.g., homo est\nspecies (‘Man is a species’) and omnis homo est\nanimal (‘Every man is an animal’) respectively.\nSuppositio personalis is the acceptance of a common term for\none or more of its particulars, as in homo currit (‘A\nman is running’). \nThe fourth division, suppositio personalis, is subdivided\ninto either derterminata (determinate = standing for a\ncertain particular) or confusa (confused = standing for any\nindividual falling under that name). Suppositio determinata\noccurs when a common term is taken indefinitely or in combination with\na particular sign—e.g., homo currit (‘Man is\nrunning’) or aliquis homo currit (‘A /some man is\nrunning’). Suppositio confusa occurs when a common term\nis taken in combination with a universal sign (’Every man is\nrunning’). \nThe tract on supposition winds up with the discussion of a few\nquestions regarding the attribution of supposition in a few cases. \nThe seventh tract of the Tractatus, on fallacies, which forms\npart of the Aristotelian-Boethian logic, is written in the tradition\nof the Fallacie maiores (Major fallacies). The eighth tract,\nDe relativis (On relatives) deals with the relative pronouns\nas defined by Priscian in his Institutiones grammaticae. The\nrelative pronouns are devided into: relatives of substance, such as\nqui (who), ille (he), alius (another), and\nrelatives of accident, such as talis (of such a kind),\nqualis (of what kind), tantus (so much),\nquantus (how much). The former are subdivided into relatives\nof identity (qui and ille) and relatives of\ndiversity (such as alter and reliquus, both of which\ncan be translated as ‘the other’). The relative of\nidentity is defined in terms of supposition as what refers to and\nstands for the same thing. These relatives are either reciprocal or\nnon-reciprocal. With regard to the relatives of identity, Peter adds a\ndicussion of a number of questions about the rationale for using\ndemonstrative pronouns, and some problems concerning how the fallacy\nof a relative having two diverse referents comes about. \nThe tract on relatives continues with a brief discussion on the\nrelatives of diversity, accompanied by a rule about the supposition of\nthe relative when it is added to a superior and an inferior in a\npremiss and a conclusion, as in aliud ab animali; ergo\naliud ab homine (‘Something other than an animal; therefore\nsomething other than a man’). With regard to relatives of\nidentity a rule of the “ancients”, who deny that a\nproposition introduced by a relative can have a contradictory\nopposite, is discussed and rejected. Another rule is given about the\nidentity of supposition of a non-reciprocal relative and what it\nrefers to. The tract concludes with short accounts of relatives of\naccident. \nThe ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth tracts of the\nTractatus, i.e., the short tracts De ampliationibus\n(On ampliation), De appellationibus (On appellation), De\nrestrictionibus (On restriction) and De distributionibus\n(On distribution) are in fact elaborations of the theory of\nsupposition. Ampliation is an extension of the supposition of a term.\nIt occurs when an expression is combined with a modal term—e.g.\nhomo potest esse Antichristus (‘A man can be the\nAntichrist’), and homo necessario est animal (‘A\nman is necessarily an animal’)—in which case the\nsupposition of the term ‘man’ is extended to more than\njust individuals existing in the present. The tract on\nappellationes is very short: appellation is considered no\nmore than a special case of restriction, i.e., the restricted\nsupposition brought about by a present-tense verb. In this tract the\nrules of appellation are in fact specific kinds of rules of\nrestriction. The subject of restriction in general is discussed in the\neleventh tract. The rules of restriction are the same ones as were\npresented in the early Parisian textbooks on logic (see de Libera\n1982, pp. 176–177). The final tract, on distribution, deals with\nthe multiplication of common terms as a result of their being combined\nwith universal signs. These universal signs are either distributive of\nsubstance (such as omnis, nullus), or of accidents\n(such as qualiscumque, quantuscumque). In this\ndescription ‘substance’ is defined as substistent modes of\nbeing, and ‘accident’ as accidental modes of being.\nSeparate attention is given to the universal sign omnis\n(‘all’ or ‘every’) along with a discussion of\nthe common rule that the use of omnis requires three\nappellata (particular things). The most frequently cited\nexample in these discussions in the thirteenth century was the\nsophisma omnis phenix est (‘Every phoenix is’).\nAccording to Peter of Spain, the use of omnis does not call\nfor at least three appellata; an exception to this rule is\nfound in cases in which there is only one appellatum, as is\nthe phoenix-case. The tract also pays attention to a number of\ntongue-twisting sophisma-sentences. \nPeter’s treatise on syncategorematic words forms part of a\nseparate genre that developed from the beginning of the thirteenth\ncentury. The term syncategorema comes from a famous passage\nof Priscian in his Institutiones grammatice II , 15, in which\na distinction is made between two types of wordclasses (partes\norationis) distinguished by logicians, viz. nouns and verbs on\nthe one hand, and syncategoremata, or\nconsignificantia, on the other. The latter are defined as\nwords that do not have a definitive meaning on their own, but acquire\none only in combination with other, categorematic words.  \nLike the treatises of the Tractatus kind, the\nSyncategoreumata were developed from the (twelfth-century)\ntheories on fallacies, as well as from grammatical doctrines (from the\nsame period). From the second half of the twelfth century, there was a\ngrowing interest in the linguistic elements that are considered to lie\nat the basis of ambiguity and fallacious reasoning. Hence the increase\nof treatises presenting a systematic account of these terms. The\nconnection these treatises have with Priscian’s grammar can be\ngathered from the attention different authors pay to the signa\nquantitatis (or quantifiers), and the fact that considerable\nattention is given to the meaning and function of syncategorematic\nterms. \nThe list of words to be included among the syncategoreumata\nwas not always the same. Generally speaking it comprised exclusive\nwords tantum (only), solus (alone), exceptive words\nsuch as preter (except), nisi (unless), consecutive\nwords such as si (if) and nisi (if not), the words\nincipit (begins) and desinit (ceases), the modal\nterms necessario (necessarily) and contingenter\n(contingently), the conjunctives an (or), et (and),\nnisi (unless), in eo quod (in that), and\nquin (that not). In Peter’s work we also find a\ndiscussion of the terms quanto (‘how much’ or\n‘as much as’) quam (‘than’ or\n‘as’) and quicquid (whatever). Unlike that of\nsome other authors (such as William of Sherwood and Robert Bacon), his\nlist does not include the word omnis. \nIn the opening of his Syncategoreumata, Peter presents his\nrationale for this investigation, viz. that there is a close link\nbetween the use of these kinds of words in sentences and their\ntruth-value. His idea is that the syncategoreumata must have some sort\nof signification, but not the same as the categorematic words. For\nthis special kind of signification he uses the words\nconsignificatio and dispositio. \nThe first two separate chapters of the Syncategoreumata are\ndevoted to the words est and non, which are said to\nbe implied in all other syncategorematic words. Peter’s account\nof the first word focuses on the notion of compositio\n(composition), which is explained in great detail, by looking into the\nsignification of nouns and verbs (signifying a composition of a\nquality with a substance, and that of an act with a substance\nrespectively). Considerable attention is given to the composition\nfeaturing in the verb ‘is’, in the form of the question of\nwhether the composition involved can be counted among beings or not,\nconsidering the fact that it can be used to express different kinds of\nstates of affairs. The chapter on negation introduces the important\ndistinction between an act as conceived of or in the manner of a\nconcept (ut concepta sive per modum conceptus) and as carried\nout (ut exercita) (see Nuchelmans 1988). Among the former\ntype we find the noun ‘negation’ and the verb ‘to\ndeny’, whereas the latter is what is meant by the negative\nparticle ‘not’. The remainder of the chapter deals with\nthe function of the negation, which is to remove the composition found\nin whatever it covers, and discusses some well-known\nsophisma-sentences which turn on the specific function of\nnegation. \nThe third chapter of the Syncategoreumata discusses the\nexclusive words solus and tantum. They are called\nexclusives because they carry out an exclusion, not because they\nsignify one. An exclusion, furthermore, requires four things, namely,\nwhat is excluded, what is excluded from, the respect in which it is\nexcluded, and the act of exclusion. The kinds of exclusion are divided\ninto general and specific: the former involves an exclusion from\nsomething generic, whereas the latter from something specific.\nQuestions that come up in this section have to do with the results of\nadding an exclusive term to different kinds of words, such as to a\nterm falling under the category of Substance: does it exclude only\nother substances, or does it also exclude from things listed under\nanother category? And what if it is added to a term listed under the\ncategory of Accident (such as colour, quantity, and so on)? The next\nquestion deals with the sorts of terms that can be meaningfully\nassociated with an exclusion. For example, is it possible to exclude\nsomething from ‘being’ (as in ‘Only being is,\ntherefore nothing other than being is’)? The tract proceeds with\nthe kinds of things that can qualify for an exclusion. The fourth\nchapter, which deals with exceptive words, is compiled in a similar\nmanner. \nThe fifth chapter is about the word si, which is said to\nsignify causality in or via antecedence. The chapter also contains\ndiscussions of the kinds of consecution or consequence, problems of\ninference connected with the referents of terms used in consecutive\nsentences, and also on how to contradict a conditional sentence.\nSpecial attention is given to the problem whether from an impossible\nantecedent anything follows. \nThe chapter on ‘begins’ and ‘ceases’ is a good\nexample of the way in which extra-logical considerations found their\nway into medieval treatises on logic. Thus, apart from the semantics\nand inferential problems connected with the use of these words in\npropositions, the chapter also looks into the notions of motion and\ntime. An important part of Peter’s ontological views can be\ngathered from chapter seven, which covers issues connected with the\nuse of modal terms. Chapter eight discusses the signification and use\nof connectives, and the final chapter on syncategorematic words proper\nis concerned with the expressions quanto, quam and\nquicquid. A very short concluding chapter of Peter’s\nSyncategoreumata deals with a somewhat isolated topic, i.e.\nthe proper modes of response in an argument. The topics looked into\nare solution, the quantity and quality of syllogisms, and the ways to\ngo about proving a syllogism. \nOne of the most important elements in Peter’s logic concerns the\ndoctrine of supposition. The theory of supposition has its origins in\nthe twelfth century, when the medievals showed a growing interest in\nthe ways in which words function in different contexts. This way of\ndealing with the semantics of terms has been dubbed the\n“contextual approach” (see de Rijk 1962–67, Vol. II,\nPart I, pp. 113–117). \nThe primary semantic property of a word is its significatio,\nin Peter’s definition, the “representation of a thing by a\nword in accordance with convention”. It is a natural property of\na word, the presentation of some (universal) content to the mind. The\nsignificatio of a word depends on its imposition, i.e., the\napplication originally given to the word in question. A word can have\nmore than one significatio, if it was originally applied to\ntwo or more distinct (universal) natures. \nThe counterpart of significatio, the formal constituent of\nevery meaning, is the word’s capacity to “stand for”\ndifferent things (even though its significatio remains the\nsame), depending on the context in which it is used. In the early\nstages of the development of the theory on the properties of terms,\nthis feature of a word was called appellatio. For instance,\nthe words ‘man’ and ‘horse’ can be used to\nstand for different individual men or horses. But they can also stand\nfor themselves, e.g., when they are used in sentences such as\n‘man is a noun’, or ‘horse is a noun’.\nMoreover, their meaning can differ according as the words are used in\ncombination with verbs of different tenses. \nIn the final stages of the development of the theory, the notion of\nsupposition becomes the general label that covers all the uses of a\nnoun (substantive or adjectival), to which other recognised properties\nof terms (appellatio, ampliatio and\nrestrictio) are subordinated. \nThe theory of properties of terms shows a radical inconsistency, which\nhas been explained as “the persistent hesitation of medieval\nlogicians between the domains of connotation (universals) and\ndenotation (individuals)” (De Rijk 1982, pp. 167–168).\nThis inconsistency runs throughout Peter’s account of\nsupposition, and comes to the fore most prominently in what he says\nabout natural supposition (suppositio naturalis). The main\nproblem is in what way the property of natural supposition is related\nto the term’s significatio, which was defined as the\nacceptance of a word for a thing (res). By this definition,\nthe significatio of the term ‘man’ covers both\nits intension and extension, i.e., the universal nature of man and the\nindividuals that have this nature in common. Suppositio\nnaturalis, on the other hand, is described as “the\nacceptance of a common term for all those things that can share in a\ncommon universal nature”; for example, the term\n‘man’ when taken by itself by its very nature stands for\nall the individuals that fall under it, whether they existed in the\npast, exist in the present or will exist in the future. From this\ndefinition and the example just presented it appears that the\nextensional features of significatio and suppositio\nnaturalis overlap. The latter kind of suppositio has\nbeen explained by interpreters as the natural capacity of a\nsignificative word to stand for something. \nThere is a more telling difference between significatio and\nsuppositio naturalis, however. Significatio is the\nnatural property of any significative term to represent things, owing\nto its original imposition, whereas a term’s supposition only\nenters the scene when it is used. The expression “taken by\nitself” (per se sumptus) found in Peter’s account\nof suppositio naturalis, does not mean that no context is\nrequired, as is the case in significatio, but it merely\nindicates that for the moment the actual context is being disregarded.\nThe link between significatio and suppositio is the\nfollowing. When some word has acquired a signification by an\nimpositor (= someone who bestows a meaning upon a word), then\nit connotes a univeral nature or essence, and acquires a natural\ncapacity to stand for all the actual and possible individuals that\nshare in this common nature; it owes this capacity to its\nsignificatio. If, however, we disregard for a moment the\nactual context in which the term in question is used and look upon the\nterm as taken by itself (per se sumptus), then its\nsupposition covers its entire extension. If we take the factual\ncontext in which the term is used into consideration, then its\nextension becomes limited, owing to the context. The context, or more\nprecisely, the added significative term, can be of three kinds: the\nadded significative term can be a predicate of a proposition in which\nthe term at issue occurs, the added significative term can be an\nadjective, or the context can be of a social nature (De Rijk 1971. See\nalso de Rijk 1985, pp. 183–203).  \nThe distinction between significatio and suppositio\nnaturalis persisted throughout the thirteenth and fourteenth\ncenturies. Behind it is the fundamental view that regardless of\nwhether a word is used in some context or not, it always has a\nsignificatum, i.e., the universal nature or essence it\nsignifies, which can be separated from what the word comes to mean in\na specific context. \nBesides suppositio naturalis, Peter’s (and other\nmedievals’) conception of suppositio simplex also seems\nto hover between connotation and denotation. In the expression\nhomo est species the term homo has suppositio\nsimplex, but this is precisely too what the term homo\nsignifies. So there scarcely seems reason to separate signification\nfrom supposition on this score. The specific use of suppositio\nsimplex found in Peter of Spain and other medieval authors, as\nthe representation of a universal nature, is rejected later on by\nauthors such as William of Ockham. For the latter, the term\nhomo in the example just given has suppositio\nsimplex (for Ockham a special case of suppositio\nmaterialis) in that it stands for the mental concept of man\n(Kneale & Kneale 1978, pp. 268–269). \nPeter of Spain’s logical works are commonly characterised as\nrevealing a moderately ‘realistic’ outlook. To explain the\ncontents of linguistic expressions and the function of logical terms,\nhe is inclined to focus on their relationships to some extra-mental\nreality. This can be shown from the way in which he discusses the use\nof the word est (is), his account of suppositio\nsimplex, and the way he analyses the occurrence of the word\n‘necessarily’ in propositions. Moreover, his conception of\nthe consecutive expression ‘if’ clearly shows his tendency\nto put the domains of reality and language on a par. (However, not all\nlinguistic expressions are connected with extramental reality.\nAlthough ontology always plays a role in his accounts of language, it\nwould appear that Peter is especially interested in the contents of\nlinguistic epressions. In that regard it seems more appropriate to\nspeak of an intensionalist semantics.) \nIn his Syncategoreumata, Peter analyses the significative\nfunction of the word ‘is’. To a certain extent his\nfindings are not confined to that term alone, but cover all verbs, in\nwhich the verb ‘is’ is always understood. The most\nremarkable feature about his discussion of ‘is’ is his\nfocus on the notion of composition. What he is particularly interested\nin is the kinds of things affirmative propositions featuring that verb\ncan refer to, in his words, the type of composition involved in such\npropositions. \nThe notion of ‘composition’ plays a prominent role in\nPeter’s semantics. Before embarking on the specifics of the word\n‘is’, he first looks into the compositiones\ninvolved in the noun and the verb. When it comes to the composition\ninvolved in the use of ‘is’, the starting-point for his\naccount is the question whether the expression ‘is’ in a\nproposition of the form ‘S is P’ implies the\n‘being’ of the composition. Whether it does or not depends\non how we consider the composition. If we are talking about any\ncomposition whatsoever, in his words, the composition in general, the\ncomposition can indiscriminately be connected with beings and\nnon-beings. This is because we can talk about both things that are and\nthings that are not by making use of the same affirmative\npropositions. Hence anything expressed by a proposition of the form\n‘S is P’ is a being in a certain sense (ens\nquodammodo). The type of composition he is referring to here is\nthe mental content of some affirmation, which is something that only\nhas being to a certain degree. However, the composition in general,\nthat is, the state of affairs involved in such expressions, is\nprimarily connected with being rather than non-being. It is when we\ntalk about non-beings, such as chimaeras, that being in a certain\nsense once again enters the scene. Hence a distinction of the types of\nbeing referred to, or the types of composition involved in affirmative\npropositions into being in the absolute sense (ens\nsimpliciter) and being in a certain sense (ens\nquodammodo). The difference between these two types of being is\nillustrated by the distinction between two types of inference: from\n‘A man is an animal’, in which the composition involved is\na being in the absolute sense, it follows ‘Therefore a man\nis’, but from ‘A chimaera is a non-being’, in which\nthe composition is a being in a certain sense only, it does not follow\n‘Therefore a chimaera is’. \nThe counterpart of Peter’s discussion of composition is the\nsection on negation. Peter specifically goes into the question of what\nit is the negation denies. In his words, the negation removes the\ncomposition. The composition in this connection is identified with the\naffirmed state of affairs (res affirmata). What the negation\nremoves is not the state of affairs, but the affirmation that goes\nalong with it. The basis of both composition and negation turns out to\nbe the same state of affairs, i.e., something that is formulated in\nthe mind, to which we can either assent or deny to be the case. \nThe focus on matters of ontology is evidenced in other portions of\nPeter’s logic as well. For Peter, as for Henry of Ghent (who\nalso wrote a Syncategoreumata) the expression homo\n(man) in homo est animal (‘Man is an animal’) has\nsimple supposition: it stands for the universal nature of humanity.\nAccordingly, the expression is necessarily true, even if no man should\nexist. The term ‘necessarily’ thus has ampliative force:\nit enables the subject term ‘man’ to refer to individuals\nnot only existing in the present ( which is the normal case when a\npresent-tense verb is used), but also to those of the past and the\nfuture. This analysis runs contrary to what is found in some other\nSyncategoreumata authors, like Johannes Pagus and Nicholas of\nParis, who maintain that the term ‘necessarily’ does not\nhave ampliative force. Hence the expression homo necessario est\nanimal (‘A man is necessarily an animal’) is only\ntrue on the condition that a man exists. \nA similar point is made in connection with the use of modal terms. For\nPeter of Spain, logical necessity is based upon ontological necessity,\nor, the necessity of propositions has its foundation in the necessity\nof the things spoken about. Necessity is associated with different\ntypes of things, such as the relationships between certain concepts\n(such as genera and species), and the specific things the notions of\nwhich we come across in the different kinds of (scientific) knowledge\n(such as mathematical entities and their properties). His outlook on\nnecessity is clearly revealed in his analysis of the inference\nhomo necessario est animal; ergo Sortes necessario est\nanimal (‘A man is necessarily an animal; therefore Socrates\nis necessarily an animal’). In his view the inference is not\nvalid, because a transition is made from necessary being to a being at\na certain time. For Peter then, the notion of necessity ultimately\nrefers to a necessary state of affairs in reality, something that is\nalways the\n case.[6] \nA fusion of the domains of language and reality also turns up in\nPeter’s account of the consecutive ‘if’, which he\nexplains as signifying causality. Like his contemporaries he looks\ninto the question whether from something impossible anything follows.\nIn his account, the notion of ‘impossibility’ can be taken\nin two ways, viz. impossibility as such (or absolute impossibility),\nwhich amounts to nothing, or some impossible state of affairs, that is\na combination of notions that do have a real foundation but are\nincompatible. From the latter type of impossibility, such as ‘A\nman is an ass’, something, but not anything can follow, e.g.,\n‘Therefore a man is an animal’. From impossibilities as\nsuch, e.g., ‘You know that you are a stone’, nothing can\nfollow. The fundamental idea is that in order for something to follow\nfrom an antecedent, the antecedent in the consecutive relationship\nmust be a something (res) of some sort (see Spruyt 1993, pp.\n161–193).","contact.mail":"joke.spruyt@maastrichtuniversity.nl","contact.domain":"maastrichtuniversity.nl"}]
