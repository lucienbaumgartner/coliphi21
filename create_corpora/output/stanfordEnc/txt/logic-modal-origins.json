Common logical features of these operators\njustify the common label. In the strict sense however, the term\n“modal logic” is reserved for the logic of the alethic\nmodalities, as opposed for example to temporal or deontic logic. From\na merely technical point of view, any logic with non-truth-functional\noperators, including first-order logic, can be regarded as a modal\nlogic: in this perspective the quantifiers too can be regarded as\nmodal operators (as in Montague 1960). Nonetheless, we follow the\ntraditional understanding of modal logics as not including\nfull-fledged first-order logic. In this perspective it is the modal\noperators that can be regarded as restricted quantifiers, ranging over\nspecial entities like possible worlds or temporal instants. Arthur\nPrior was one of the first philosophers/logicians to emphasize that\nthe modal system S5 can be translated into a fragment\nof first-order logic, which he called “the uniform monadic\nfirst-order predicate calculus” (Prior and Fine 1977: 56).\nMonadic, since no relations between worlds needs to be stated for\nS5; and uniform as only one variable is needed to\nquantify over worlds (instants) when bound, and to refer to the\nprivileged state (the actual world or the present time) when free (see\nPrior and Fine 1977). Concerning the technical question of which\nmodel-theoretic features characterize modal logics understood as\nwell-behaved fragments of first-order logic, see Blackburn and van\nBenthem’s “Modal Logic: A Semantic Perspective”\n(2007a).\n\n\nThe scope of this entry is the recent historical development of modal\nlogic, strictly understood as the logic of necessity and possibility,\nand particularly the historical development of systems of modal logic,\nboth syntactically and semantically, from C.I. Lewis’s\npioneering work starting in 1912, with the first systems devised in\n1918, to S. Kripke’s work in the early 1960s. In that short span\nof time of less than fifty years, modal logic flourished both\nphilosophically and mathematically. Mathematically, different modal\nsystems were developed and advances in algebra helped to foster the\nmodel theory for such systems. This culminated in the development of a\nformal semantics that extended to modal logic the successful\nfirst-order model theoretic techniques, thereby affording completeness\nand decidability results for many, but not all, systems.\nPhilosophically, the availability of different systems and the\nadoption of the possible worlds model-theoretic semantics were\nnaturally accompanied by reflections on the nature of possibility and\nnecessity, on distinct sorts of necessities, on the role of the formal\nsemantics, and on the nature of the possible worlds, to mention just a\nfew. In particular, the availability of different systems brings to\nthe fore the philosophical question of which modal logic is the\ncorrect one, under some intended interpretation of the modal\noperators, e.g., as logical or metaphysical necessity. Questions\nconcerning the interpretability of modal logic, especially quantified\nmodal logic, were insistently raised by Quine. All such questions are\nnot pursued in this entry which is mostly devoted to the formal\ndevelopment of the subject.\n\n\nModal logic is a rich and complex subject matter. This entry does not\npresent a complete survey of all the systems developed and of all the\nmodel theoretic results proved in the lapse of time under\nconsideration. It does however offer a meaningful survey of the main\nsystems and aims to be useful to those looking for an historical\noutline of the subject matter that, even if not all-inclusive,\ndelineates the most interesting model theoretic results and indicates\nfurther lines of exploration. Bull and Segerberg’s (1984: 3)\nuseful division of the original sources of modal logic into three\ndistinct traditions—syntactic, algebraic, and model\ntheoretic—is adopted. For other less influential traditions, see\nBull and Segerberg (1984: 16). See also Lindström and\nSegerberg’s “Modal Logic and Philosophy” (2007). The\nmain focus of this entry is on propositional modal logic, while only\nsome particular aspects of the semantics of quantified modal logic are\ndiscussed. For a more detailed treatment of quantified modal logic,\nconsult the SEP entry on\n modal logic.\n Concerning the entry’s notation, notice that \\(\\Rightarrow\\) is\nadopted in place of Lewis’s fishhook for strict implication, and\n\\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) for strict equivalence.\n\nIn a 1912 pioneering article in Mind “Implication and\nthe Algebra of Logic” C.I. Lewis started to voice his concerns\non the so-called “paradoxes of material implication”.\nLewis points out that in Russell and Whitehead’s Principia\nMathematica we find two “startling theorems: (1) a false\nproposition implies any proposition, and (2) a true proposition is\nimplied by any proposition” (1912: 522). In symbols: \nand \nLewis has no objection to these theorems in and of themselves:  \nIn themselves, they are neither mysterious sayings, nor great\ndiscoveries, nor gross absurdities. They exhibit only, in sharp\noutline, the meaning of “implies” which has been\nincorporated into the algebra. (1912: 522)  \nHowever, the theorems are inadequate vis-à-vis the\nintended meaning of “implication” and our actual modes of\ninference that the intended meaning tries to capture. So Lewis has in\nmind an intended meaning for the conditional connective\n\\(\\rightarrow\\) or \\(\\supset\\), and that is the meaning of the English\nword “implies”. The meaning of “implies” is\nthat “of ordinary inference and proof” (1912: 531)\naccording to which a proposition implies another proposition if the\nsecond can be logically deduced from the first. Given such an\ninterpretation, (1) and (2) ought not to be theorems, and\npropositional logic may be regarded as unsound\nvis-à-vis the reading of \\(\\rightarrow\\) as logical\nimplication. Consider (2) for example: from the sheer truth of a\nproposition \\(p\\) it does not (logically) follow that \\(p\\) follows\nlogically from any proposition whatsoever. Additionally, given the\nintended, strict reading of \\(\\rightarrow\\) as logical implication and\nthe equivalence of \\((\\neg p\\rightarrow q)\\) and \\((p\\vee q)\\), Lewis\ninfers that disjunction too must be given a new intensional sense,\naccording to which \\((p\\vee q)\\) holds just in case if \\(p\\) were not\nthe case it would have to be the case that \\(q\\). \nConsiderations of this sort, based on the distinction between\nextensional and intensional readings of the connectives, were not\noriginal to Lewis. Already in 1880 Hugh MacColl in the first of a\nseries of eight papers on Symbolical Reasoning published in\nMind claimed that \\((p\\rightarrow q)\\) and \\((\\neg p\\vee q)\\)\nare not equivalent: \\((\\neg p\\vee q)\\) follows from \\((p\\rightarrow\nq)\\), but not vice versa (MacColl 1880: 54). This is the case because\nMacColl interprets \\(\\vee\\) as regular extensional disjunction, and\n\\(\\rightarrow\\) as intensional implication, but then from the falsity\nof \\(p\\) or the truth of \\(q\\) it does not follow that \\(p\\) without\n\\(q\\) is logically impossible. In the second paper of the series,\nMacColl distinguishes between certainties, possibilities and variable\nstatements, and introduces Greek letters as indices to classify\npropositions. So \\(\\alpha^{\\varepsilon}\\) expresses that \\(\\alpha\\) is\na certainty, \\(\\alpha^{\\eta}\\) that \\(\\alpha\\) is an impossibility,\nand \\(\\alpha^{\\theta}\\) that \\(\\alpha\\) is a variable, i.e., neither a\ncertainty nor an impossibility (MacColl 1897: 496–7). Using this\nthreefold classification of statements, MacColl proceeds to\ndistinguish between causal and general implication. A causal\nimplication holds between statements \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) if\nwhenever \\(\\alpha\\) is true \\(\\beta\\) is true, and \\(\\beta\\) is not a\ncertainty. A general implication holds between \\(\\alpha\\) and\n\\(\\beta\\) whenever \\(\\alpha\\) and not\\(-\\beta\\) is impossible, thus in\nparticular whenever \\(\\alpha\\) is an impossibility or \\(\\beta\\) a\ncertainty (1897: 498). The use of indices opened the door to the\niteration of modalities, and the beginning of the third paper of the\nseries (MacColl 1900: 75–6) is devoted to clarify the meaning of\nstatements with iterated indices, including \\(\\tau\\) for truth and\n\\(\\iota\\) for negation. So for example \\(A^{\\eta \\iota \\varepsilon}\\)\nis read as “It is certain that it is false that A is\nimpossible” (note that the indices are read from right to left).\nInterestingly, Bertrand Russell’s 1906 review of MacColl’s\nbook Symbolic Logic and its Applications (1906) reveals that\nRussell did not understand the modal idea of the variability of a\nproposition, hence wrongly attributed to MacColl a confusion between\nsentences and propositions which allowed the attribution of\nvariability only to sentences whose meaning, hence truth\nvalue, was not fixed. Similarly, certainty and impossibility are for\nRussell material properties of propositional functions (true of\neverything or of nothing) and not modal properties of propositions. It\nmight be said that MacColl’s work came too early and fell on\ndeaf ears. In fact, Rescher reports on Russell’s declared\ndifficulty in understanding MacColl’s symbolism and, more\nimportantly, argues that Russell’s view of logic had a negative\nimpact on the development of modal logic (“Bertrand Russell and\nModal Logic” in Rescher 1974: 85–96). Despite\nMacColl’s earlier work, Lewis can be regarded as the father of\nthe syntactic tradition, not only because of his influence on later\nlogicians, but especially because of his introduction of various\nsystems containing the new intensional connectives. \nIn “The Calculus of Strict Implication” (1914) Lewis\nsuggests two possible alternatives to the extensional system of\nWhitehead and Russell’s Principia Mathematica. One way\nof introducing a system of strict implication consists in eliminating\nfrom the system those theorems that, like (1) and (2) above, are true\nonly for material implication but not for strict implication, thereby\nobtaining a sound system for both material and strict implication, but\nin neither case complete. The second, more fruitful alternative\nconsists in introducing a new system of strict implication, still\nmodeled on the Whitehead and Russell system of material implication,\nthat will contain (all or a part of) extensional propositional logic\nas a proper part, but aspiring to completeness for at least strict\nimplication. This second option is further developed in A Survey\nof Symbolic Logic (1918). There Lewis introduces a first system\nmeant to capture the ordinary, strict sense of implication, guided by\nthe idea that:  \nUnless “implies” has some “proper” meaning,\nthere is no criterion of validity, no possibility even of arguing\nthe question whether there is one or not. And yet the question\nWhat is the “proper” meaning of\n“implies”? remains peculiarly difficult. (1918: 325)  \nThe 1918 system takes as primitive the notion of impossibility \\((\\neg\n\\Diamond)\\), defines the operator of strict implication in its terms,\nand still employs an operator of intensional disjunction. However,\nPost will prove that this system leads to the collapse of necessity to\ntruth—alternatively, of impossibility to falsity—since\nfrom one of its theorems \\(((p\\Rightarrow q)\\Leftrightarrow(\\neg\n\\Diamond q\\Rightarrow \\neg \\Diamond p))\\) it can be proved that\n\\((\\neg p\\Leftrightarrow \\neg \\Diamond p)\\). In 1920, “Strict\nImplication—An Emendation”, Lewis fixes the system\nsubstituting for the old axiom the weaker one: \\(((p\\Rightarrow\nq)\\Rightarrow(\\neg \\Diamond q\\Rightarrow \\neg \\Diamond p))\\). Finally,\nin Appendix II of the Lewis and Langford’s volume Symbolic\nLogic (1932: 492–502) “The Structure of the System of\nStrict Implication” the 1918 system is given a new axiomatic\nbase. \nIn the 1932 Appendix C.I. Lewis introduces five different systems. The\nmodal primitive symbol is now the operator of possibility\n\\(\\Diamond\\), strict implication \\((p\\Rightarrow q)\\) is defined as\n\\(\\neg \\Diamond(p\\wedge \\neg q)\\), and \\(\\vee\\) is ordinary\nextensional disjunction. The necessity operator \\(\\Box\\) can also be\nintroduced and defined, though Lewis does not, in the usual way as\n\\(\\neg \\Diamond \\neg\\). \nWhere \\(p, q\\), and \\(r\\) are propositional variables, System\nS1 has the following axioms: \nAxioms for S1 \nAxiom B5 was proved redundant by McKinsey (1934), and can thereby be\nignored. \nThe rules are (1932: 125–6): \nRules for S1 \nUniform Substitution\n\nA valid formula remains valid if a formula is uniformly substituted in\nit for a propositional variable. \nSubstitution of Strict Equivalents\n\nEither of two strictly equivalent formulas can be substituted for one\nanother. \nAdjunction\n\nIf \\(\\Phi\\) and \\(\\Psi\\) have been inferred, then \\(\\Phi \\wedge \\Psi\\)\nmay be inferred. \nStrict Inference\n\nIf \\(\\Phi\\) and \\(\\Phi \\Rightarrow \\Psi\\) have been inferred, then\n\\(\\Psi\\) may be inferred. \nSystem S2 is obtained from System S1\nby adding what Lewis calls “the consistency postulate”,\nsince it obviously holds for \\(\\Diamond\\) interpreted as\nconsistency: \nSystem S3 is obtained from system S1\nby adding the axiom: \nSystem S3 corresponds to the 1918 system of A\nSurvey, which Lewis originally considered the correct system for\nstrict implication. By 1932, Lewis has come to prefer system\nS2. The reason, as reported in Lewis 1932: 496, is\nthat both Wajsberg and Parry derived in system\nS3—in its 1918 axiomatization—the\nfollowing theorem: \nwhich according to Lewis ought not to be regarded as a valid principle\nof deduction. In 1932 Lewis is not sure that the questionable theorem\nis not derivable in S2. Should it be, he would then\nadjudicate S1 as the proper system for strict\nimplication. However, Parry (1934) will later prove that neither A8\nnor \ncan be derived in S2. \nA further existence axiom can be added to all these systems: \nThe addition of B9 makes it impossible to interpret \\(\\Rightarrow\\) as\nmaterial implication, since in the case of material implication it can\nbe proved that for any propositions \\(p\\) and \\(q, ((p\\rightarrow\nq)\\vee(p\\rightarrow \\neg q))\\) (1932: 179). From B9 Lewis proceeds to\ndeduce the existence of at least four logically distinct propositions:\none true and necessary, one true but not necessary, one false and\nimpossible, one false but not impossible (1932: 184–9). \nFollowing Becker (1930), Lewis considers three more axioms: \nThree additional axioms \nSystem S4 adds axiom C10 to the basis of\nS1. System S5 adds axiom C11, or\nalternatively C10 and C12, to the basis of S1. Lewis\nconcludes Appendix II by noting that the study of logic is best served\nby focusing on systems weaker than S5 and not\nexclusively on S5. \nParadoxes of strict implication similar to those of material\nimplication arise too. Given that strict implication \\((p\\Rightarrow\nq)\\) is defined as \\(\\neg \\Diamond(p\\wedge \\neg q)\\), it follows that\nan impossible proposition implies anything, and that a necessary\nproposition is implied by anything. Lewis argues that this is as it\nought to be. Since impossibility is taken to be logical impossibility,\ni.e., ultimately a contradiction, Lewis argues that from an impossible\nproposition like \\((p\\wedge \\neg p)\\), both \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg p\\)\nfollow. From \\(p\\) we can derive \\((p\\vee q)\\), for any proposition\n\\(q\\). From \\(\\neg p\\) and \\((p\\vee q)\\), we can derive \\(q\\) (1932:\n250). The argument is controversial since one might think that the\nprinciple \\((p\\Rightarrow(p\\vee q))\\) should not be a theorem of a\nsystem aiming to express ordinary implication (see, e.g., Nelson 1930:\n447). Whatever the merits of this argument, those who disagreed with\nLewis started to develop a logic of entailment based on the assumption\nthat entailment requires more than Lewis’s strict implication.\nSee, for example, Nelson 1930, Strawson 1948, and Bennett 1954. See\nalso the SEP entry on\n relevance logic. \nNotice that it was Lewis’s search for a system apt to express\nstrict implication that made Quine reject modal systems as based on a\nuse-mention confusion insofar as such systems were formulated to\nexpress at the object level proof-theoretic or semantic notions like\nconsistency, implication, derivability and theoremhood (in fact,\nwhenever \\(p\\rightarrow q\\) is a propositional theorem, system\nS1, and so all the other stronger Lewis systems too,\ncan prove \\(p\\Rightarrow q\\) (Parry 1939: 143)). \nGödel in “An Interpretation of the Intuitionistic\nPropositional Calculus” (1933) is the first to propose an\nalternative axiomatization of the Lewis system S4\nthat separates the propositional basis of the system from the modal\naxioms and rules. Gödel adds the following rules and axioms to\nthe propositional calculus.  \nInitially, Gödel employs an operator \\(B\\) of provability to\ntranslate Heyting’s primitive intuitionistic connectives, and\nthen observes that if we replace \\(B\\) with an operator of necessity\nwe obtain the system S4. Gödel also claims that\na formula \\(\\Box p\\vee \\Box q\\) is not provable in S4\nunless either \\(\\Box p\\) or \\(\\Box q\\) is provable, analogously to\nintuitionistic disjunction. Gödel’s claim will be proved\nalgebraically by McKinsey and Tarski (1948). Gödel’s short\nnote is important for starting the fruitful practice of axiomatizing\nmodal systems separating the propositional calculus from the strictly\nmodal part, but also for connecting intuitionistic and modal\nlogic. \nFeys (1937) is the first to propose system T by\nsubtracting axiom 4 from Gödel’s system S4\n(see also Feys 1965: 123–124). In An Essay in Modal\nLogic (1951) von Wright discusses alethic, epistemic, and deontic\nmodalities, and introduces system M, which\nSobociński (1953) will prove to be equivalent to Feys’\nsystem T. Von Wright (1951: 84–90) proves that\nsystem M contains Lewis’s S2,\nwhich contains S1—where system\nS is said to contain system S′\nif all the formulas provable in S′ can be\nproved in S too. System S3, an\nextension of S2, is not contained in\nM. Nor is M contained in\nS3. Von Wright finds S3 of little\nindependent interest, and sees no reason to adopt S3\ninstead of the stronger S4. In general, the Lewis\nsystems are numbered in order of strength, with S1\nthe weakest and S5 the strongest, weaker systems\nbeing contained in the stronger ones. \nLemmon (1957) also follows Gödel in axiomatizing modal systems on\na propositional calculus base, and presents an alternative\naxiomatization of the Lewis systems. Where PC is the\npropositional calculus base, PC may be characterized\nas the following three rules (1957: 177): \nA characterization of propositional calculus PC \nFurther rules in Lemmon’s system are: \nFurther axioms in Lemmon’s system are: \nUsing the above rules and axioms Lemmon defines four systems. System\nP1, which is proved equivalent to the Lewis system\nS1, employs the propositional basis\n(PC), rules (a′)—necessitation of\ntautologies and axioms—and (b′), and axioms (2) and (3).\nSystem P2, equivalent to S2, employs\n(PC), rules (a′) and (b), and axioms (2) and\n(1′). System P3, equivalent to\nS3, employs (PC), rule (a′),\nand axioms (2) and (1). System P4, equivalent to\nS4, employs (PC), rule (a), and\naxioms (2) and (1). In Lemmon’s axiomatization it is easy to see\nthat S3 and von Wright’s system\nM (Feys’ T) are not included\nin each other, given M’s stronger rule of\nnecessitation and S3’s stronger axiom (1) in\nplace of (1′) = K. In general, Lemmon’s axiomatization\nmakes more perspicuous the logical distinctions between the different\nLewis systems. \nLemmon considers also some systems weaker than S1. Of\nparticular interest is system S0.5 which weakens\nS1 by replacing rule (a′) with the weaker rule\n(a″): \nLemmon interprets system S0.5 as a formalized\nmetalogic of the propositional calculus, where \\(\\Box \\alpha\\) is\ninterpreted as “\\(\\alpha\\) is a tautology”. \nWe call “normal” the systems that include\nPC, axiom K and the rule of necessitation. System\nK is the smallest normal system. System\nT adds axiom T to system K. System\nB (the Brouwersche system) adds axiom B  \nto system T. S4 adds axiom 4\n(equivalent to Becker’s C10) to system T.\nS5 adds axioms B and 4, or alternatively axiom E  \nto system T. Lewis’s systems\nS1, S2, and S3 are\nnon-normal given that they do not contain the rule of Necessitation.\nFor the relationship between these (and other) systems, and the\nconditions on frames that the axioms impose, consult the SEP entry on\n modal logic. \nOnly a few of the many extensions of the Lewis systems that have been\ndiscussed in the literature are mentioned here. Alban (1943)\nintroduced system S6 by adding to S2\nthe axiom \\(\\mvdash \\Diamond \\Diamond p\\). Halldén (1950) calls\nS7 the system that adds the axiom \\(\\mvdash \\Diamond\n\\Diamond p\\) to S3, and S8 the\nsystem that extends S3 with the addition of the axiom\n\\(\\mvdash \\neg \\Diamond \\neg \\Diamond \\Diamond p\\). While the addition\nof an axiom of universal possibility \\(\\mvdash \\Diamond p\\) would be\ninconsistemt with all the Lewis systems, since they all contain\ntheorems of the form \\(\\mvdash \\Box p\\), systems S6,\nS7 and S8 are consistent. Instead,\nthe addition of either of these axioms to S4, and so\nalso to S5, results in an inconsistent system, given\nthat in S4 \\(\\mvdash \\Diamond \\Diamond p\\Rightarrow\n\\Diamond p\\). Halldén also proved that a formula is a theorem\nof S3 if and only if it is a theorem of both\nS4 and S7 (1950: 231–232),\nthus S4 and S7 are two alternative\nextensions of S3. \nIn “Philosophical Remarks on Many-Valued Systems of\nPropositional Logic” (1930. But Łukasiewicz 1920 is a\npreliminary Polish version of the main ideas of this paper),\nŁukasiewicz says:  \nWhen I recognized the incompatibility of the traditional theorems on\nmodal propositions in 1920, I was occupied with establishing the\nsystem of the ordinary “two-valued” propositional calculus\nby means of the matrix method. I satisfied myself at the time that all\ntheses of the ordinary propositional calculus could be proved on the\nassumption that their propositional variables could assume only two\nvalues, “0” or “the false”, and\n“1” or “the true”. (1970: 164)  \nThis passage illustrates well how Łukasiewicz was thinking of\nlogic in the early twenties. First, he was thinking in algebraic\nterms, rather than syntactically, concerning himself not so much with\nthe construction of new systems, but with the evaluation of the\nsystems relatively to sets of values. Secondly, he was introducing\nthree-valued matrices to make logical space for the notion of\npropositions (eminently about future contingents) that are neither\ntrue nor false, and that receive the new indeterminate value ½.\nIronically, later work employing his original matrix method will show\nthat the hope of treating modal logic as a three-valued system cannot\nbe realized. See also the SEP entry on\n many-valued logic. \nA matrix for a propositional logic L is given by (i) a set\nK of elements, the truth-values, (ii) a non-empty subset\n\\(D\\subseteq K\\) of designated truth-values, and (iii) operations on\nthe set K, that is functions from \\(n\\)-tuples of truth-values\nto truth-values, that correspond to the connectives of L. A\nmatrix satisfies a formula A under an assignment \\(\\sigma\\) of\nelements of K to the variables of A if the value of\nA under \\(\\sigma\\) is a member of D, that is, a\ndesignated value. A matrix satisfies a formula if it satisfies it\nunder every assignment \\(\\sigma\\). A matrix for a modal logic M\nextends a matrix for a propositional logic by adding a unary function\nthat corresponds to the connective \\(\\Diamond\\). \nMatrices are typically used to show the independence of the axioms of\na system as well as their consistency. The consistency of two formulas\nA and B is established by a matrix that, under an\nassignment \\(\\sigma\\), assigns to both formulas designated values. The\nindependence of formula B from formula A is established\nby a matrix that (i) preserves the validity of the rules of the system\nand that (ii) under an interpretation \\(\\sigma\\) assigns to A\nbut not to B a designated value. Parry (1939) uses the matrix\nmethod to show that the number of modalities of Lewis’s systems\nS3 and S4 is finite. A modality is a\nmodal function of one variable that contains only the operators\n\\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\Diamond\\). The degree of a modality is given by the\nnumber of \\(\\Diamond\\) operators contained. A proper modality is of\ndegree higher than zero. Proper modalities can be of four different\nforms:  \nThe improper modalities are \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg p\\) (1939: 144). Parry\nproves that S3 has 42 distinct modalities, and that\nS4 has 14 distinct modalities. It was already known\nthat system S5 has only 6 distinct modalities since\nit reduces all modalities to modalities of degree zero or one. Parry\nintroduces system S4.5 by adding to\nS4 the following axiom:  \nThe system reduces the number of modalities of S4\nfrom 14 to 12 (or 10 proper ones). The addition of the same axiom to\nLewis’s system S3 results in a system with 26\ndistinct modalities. Moreover, if we add  \nto S3 we obtain a distinct system with 26 modalities\nalso intermediate between S3 and S4.\nTherefore the number of modalities does not uniquely determine a\nsystem. Systems S1 and S2, as well\nas T and B, have an infinite number\nof modalities (Burgess 2009, chapter 3 on Modal Logic, discusses the\nadditional systems S4.2 and S4.3 and\nexplains well the reduction of modalities in different systems). \nA characteristic matrix for a system L is a matrix\nthat satisfies all and only the theorems of L. A matrix is\nfinite if its set K of truth-values is finite. A\nfinite characteristic matrix yields a decision procedure, where a\nsystem is decidable if every formula of the system that is not a\ntheorem is falsified by some finite matrix (this is the finite model\nproperty). Yet Dugundji (1940) shows that none of\nS1–S5 has a finite\ncharacteristic matrix. Hence, none of these systems can be viewed as\nan \\(n\\)-valued logic for a finite \\(n\\). Later, Scroggs (1951) will\nprove that every proper extension of S5 that\npreserves detachment for material implication and is closed under\nsubstitution has a finite characteristic matrix. \nDespite their lack of a finite characteristic matrix, McKinsey (1941)\nshows that systems S2 and S4 are\ndecidable. To prove these results McKinsey introduces modal matrices\n\\((K, D, -, *, \\times)\\), with \\(-\\), \\(*\\), and \\(\\times\\)\ncorresponding to negation, possibility, and conjunction respectively.\nA matrix is normal if it satisfies the following\nconditions: \nThese conditions correspond to Lewis’s rules of strict\ninference, adjunction and substitution of strict equivalents. The\nstructure of McKinsey’s proof is as follows. The proof employs\nthree steps. First, using an unpublished method of Lindenbaum\nexplained to him by Tarski which holds for systems that have the rule\nof Substitution for propositional variables, McKinsey shows that there\nis an S2-characteristic matrix \\(M = (K, D, -, *,\n\\times)\\) that does not satisfy condition (iii) and is therefore\nnon-normal. M is a trivial matrix whose domain is the set of\nformulas of the system, whose designated elements are the theorems of\nthe system, and whose operations are the connectives themselves. The\ntrivial matrix M does not satisfy (iii) given that for some\ndistinct formulas A and B, \\(A\\Leftrightarrow B\\) is an\nS2-theorem. Second, McKinsey shows how to construct\nfrom M a normal, but still infinite,\nS2-characteristic matrix \\(M_1 = (K_1, D_1, -_1, *^1,\n\\times_1 )\\), whose elements are equivalence classes of provably\nequivalent formulas of S2, i.e., of formulas A\nand B such that \\(A\\Leftrightarrow B\\) is a theorem of\nS2, and whose operations are revised accordingly. For\nexample, if \\(E(A)\\) is the set of formulas provably equivalent to\nA and \\(E(A)\\in K_1\\), then \\(-_1 E(A) = E(-A)= E(\\neg A).\nM_1\\) satisfies exactly the formulas satisfied by M without\nviolating condition (iii), hence it is a characteristic normal matrix\nfor S2 (\\(M_1\\) is the Lindenbaum algebra for\nS2). Finally, it is shown that for every formula\nA that is not a theorem of S2 there is a\nfinite and normal matrix (a sub-algebra of \\(M_1)\\) that falsifies it.\nA similar proof is given for S4. \nA matrix is a special kind of algebra. An algebra is a matrix without\na set D of designated elements. Boolean algebras correspond to\nmatrices for propositional logic. According to Bull and Segerberg\n(1984: 10) the generalization from matrices to algebras may have had\nthe effect of encouraging the study of these structures independently\nof their connections to logic and modal systems. The set of designated\nelements D in fact facilitates a definition of validity with\nrespect to which the theorems of a system can be evaluated. Without\nsuch a set the most obvious link to logic is severed. A second\ngeneralization to classes of algebras, rather than merely to\nindividual algebras, was also crucial to the mathematical development\nof the subject matter. Tarski is the towering figure in such\ndevelopment. \nJónsson and Tarski (1951 and 1952) introduce the general idea\nof Boolean algebras with operators, i.e., extensions of Boolean\nalgebras by addition of operators that correspond to the modal\nconnectives. They prove a general representation theorem for Boolean\nalgebras with operators that extends Stone’s result for Boolean\nalgebras (every Boolean algebra can be represented as a set algebra).\nThis work of Jónsson and Tarski evolved from Tarski’s\npurely mathematical study of the algebra of relations and includes no\nreference to modal logic or even logic in general. Jónsson and\nTarski’s theorem is a (more general) algebraic analog of\nKripke’s later semantic completeness results, yet this was not\nrealized for some time. Not only was Tarski unaware of the connection,\nbut it appears that both Kripke and Lemmon had not read the\nJónsson and Tarski papers at the time in which they did their\nmodal work in the late fifties and sixties, and Kripke claims to have\nreached the same result independently. \nLemmon (1966a and 1966b) adapts the algebraic methods of McKinsey to\nprove decidability results and representation theorems for various\nmodal systems including T (though apparently in\nignorance of Jónsson and Tarski’s work). In particular,\nhe extends McKinsey’s method by introducing a new technique for\nconstructing finite algebras of subsets of a Kripke model structure\n(discussed in the next section of this entry). Lemmon (1966b: 191)\nattributes to Dana Scott the main result of his second 1966 paper.\nThis is a general representation theorem proving that algebras for\nmodal systems can be represented as algebras based on the power set of\nthe set K in the corresponding Kripke’s structures. As a\nconsequence, algebraic completeness translates into Kripke’s\nmodel theoretic completeness. So, Lemmon elucidates very clearly the\nconnection between Kripke’s models whose elements are worlds and\nthe corresponding algebras whose elements are sets of worlds that can\nbe thought of as propositions, thereby showing that the algebraic and\nmodel theoretic results are deeply connected. Kripke (1963a) is\nalready explicit on this connection. In The Lemmon Notes\n(1977), written in collaboration with Dana Scott and edited by\nSegerberg, the 1966 technique is transformed into a purely model\ntheoretic method which yields completeness and decidability results\nfor many systems of modal logic in as general a form as possible\n(1977: 29). \nSee also the SEP entry on\n the algebra of logic tradition.\n For a basic introduction to the algebra of modal logic, consult\nHughes and Cresswell 1968, Chapter 17 on “Boolean Algebra and\nModal Logic”. For a more comprehensive treatment, see chapter 5\nof Blackburn, de Rijke, and Venema 2001. See also Goldblatt 2003. \nIn the early 1940s the recognition of the semantical nature of the\nnotion of logical truth led Rudolf Carnap to an informal explication\nof this notion in terms of Leibnizian possible worlds. At the same\ntime, he recognized that the many syntactical advances in modal logic\nfrom 1918 on were still not accompanied by adequate semantic\nconsiderations. One notable exception was Gödel’s\ninterpretation of necessity as provability and the resulting\npreference for S4. Carnap instead thought of\nnecessity as logical truth or analyticity. Considerations on the\nproperties of logically true sentences led him to think of\nS5 as the right system to formalize this\n‘informal’ notion. Carnap’s work in the early\nforties would then be focused on (1) defining a formal semantic notion\nof L-truth apt to represent the informal semantic notions of\nlogical truth, necessity, and analyticity, that is, truth in virtue of\nmeaning alone (initially, he drew no distinction between these\nnotions, but clearly thought of analyticity as the leading idea); and\n(2) providing a formal semantics for quantified S5 in\nterms of the formal notion of L-truth with the aim of obtaining\nsoundness and completeness results, that is, prove that all the\ntheorems of quantified S5 are L-true, and that\nall the L-truths (expressible in the language of the system)\nare theorems of the system. \nThe idea of quantified modal systems occurred to Ruth Barcan too. In\n“A Functional Calculus of First Order Based on Strict\nImplication” (1946a) she added quantification to Lewis’s\npropositional system S2; Carnap (1946) added it to\nS5. Though some specific semantic points about\nquantified modal logic will be considered, this entry is not focused\non the development of quantified modal logic, but rather on the\nemergence of the model theoretic formal semantics for modal logic,\npropositional or quantified. For a more extensive treatment of\nquantified modal logic, consult the SEP entry on\n modal logic. \nIn “Modalities and Quantification” (1946) and in\nMeaning and Necessity (1947), Carnap interprets the object\nlanguage operator of necessity as expressing at the object level the\nsemantic notion of logical truth:  \n[T]he guiding idea in our constructions of systems of modal logic is\nthis: a proposition \\(p\\) is logically necessary if and only if a\nsentence expressing \\(p\\) is logically true. That is to say, the modal\nconcept of the logical necessity of a proposition and the semantical\nconcept of the logical truth or analyticity of a sentence correspond\nto each other. (1946: 34)  \nCarnap introduces the apparatus of state-descriptions to define the\nformal semantic notion of L-truth. This formal notion is then\nto be used to provide a formal semantics for S5. \nA state-description for a language L is a class of sentences of\nL such that, for every atomic sentence \\(p\\) of L,\neither \\(p\\) or \\(\\neg p\\), but not both, is contained in the class.\nAn atomic sentence holds in a state-description R if\nand only if it belongs to R. A sentence \\(\\neg A\\) (where\nA need not be atomic) holds in R if and only if A\ndoes not hold in R; \\((A\\wedge B)\\) holds in R if and\nonly if both A and B hold in R, and so on for the\nother connectives in the usual inductive way; \\((\\forall x)Fx\\) holds\nin R if and only if all the substitution instances of \\(Fx\\)\nhold in R. The range of a sentence is the class of\nstate-descriptions in which it holds. Carnap’s notion of\nvalidity or L-truth is a maximal notion, i.e., Carnap defines a\nsentence to be valid or L-true if and only if it holds in\nall state-descriptions. In later work Carnap adopts models in\nplace of state-descriptions. Models are assignments of values to the\nprimitive non-logical constants of the language. In Carnap’s\ncase predicate constants are the only primitive constants to which the\nmodels assign values, since individual constants are given a fixed\npre-model interpretation and value assignments to variables are done\nindependently of the models (1963a). \nIt is important to notice that the definition of L-truth does\nnot employ the notion of truth, but rather only that of\nholding-in-a-state-description. Truth is introduced later as what\nholds in the real state description. To be an adequate formal\nrepresentation of analyticity, L-truth must respect the basic\nidea behind analyticity: truth in virtue of meaning alone. In fact,\nthe L-truths of a system S are such that the semantic\nrules of S suffice to establish their truth. Informally,\nstate-descriptions represent something like Leibnizian possible worlds\nor Wittgensteinian possible states of affairs and the range of\nstate-descriptions for a certain language is supposed to exhaust the\nrange of alternative possibilities describable in that language. \nConcerning modal sentences, Carnap adopts the following conventions\n(we use \\(\\Box\\) in place of Carnap’s operator N for\nlogical necessity). Let S be a system: \nFrom which it follows that: \nCarnap’s conventions hold also if we substitute “truth in\na state description of S” for “truth in\nS”. \nCarnap assumes a fixed domain of quantification for his quantified\nsystem, the functional calculus with identity FC, and\nconsequently for the modal functional calculus with identity\nMFC, a quantified form of S5. The\nlanguage of FC contains denumerably many individual\nconstants, the universe of discourse contains denumerably many\nindividuals, each constant is assigned an individual of the domain,\nand no two constants are assigned the same individual. This makes\nsentences like \\(a = a\\) L-true, and sentences like \\(a = b\\)\nL-false (1946: 49). Concerning MFC, the Barcan\nformula and its converse are both L-true, that is,  \nThis result is guaranteed by the assumption of a fixed domain of\nquantification. Carnap proves that MFC is sound, that\nis, all its theorems are L-true, and raises the question of\ncompleteness for both FC and MFC.\nGödel proved completeness for the first order predicate calculus\nwith identity, but the notion of validity employed was truth in every\nnon-empty domain of quantification, including finite domains. Carnap\ninstead adopts one unique denumerable domain of quantification. The\nadoption of a fixed denumerable domain of individuals generates some\nadditional validities already at the pre-modal level which jeopardize\ncompleteness, for example “There are at least two\nindividuals”, \\((\\exists x)(\\exists y)(x\\ne y)\\), turns out to\nbe valid (1946: 53). \nA consequence of the definitions of state-descriptions for a language\nand L-truth is that each atomic sentence and its negation turn\nout to be true at some, but not all, state-descriptions. Hence, if\n\\(p\\) is atomic both \\(\\Diamond p\\) and \\(\\Diamond \\neg p\\) are\nL-true. Hence, Lewis’s rule of Uniform Substitution fails\n(if \\(p\\wedge \\neg p\\) is substituted for \\(p\\) in \\(\\Diamond p\\) we\nderive \\(\\Diamond(p\\wedge \\neg p)\\), which is L-false, not\nL-true). This is noticed by Makinson (1966a) who argues that\nwhat must be done is reinstate substitutivity and revise\nCarnap’s naïve notion of validity (as logical necessity) in\nfavor of a schematic Quinean notion (“A logical truth\n… is definable as a sentence from which we get only\ntruths when we substitute sentences for its simple\nsentences” Quine 1970: 50) that will not make sentences\nlike \\(\\Diamond p\\) valid. Nonetheless, Carnap proves the soundness\nand completeness of propositional S5, which he calls\n“MPC” for modal propositional calculus,\nfollowing Wajsberg. The proof however effectively employs a schematic\nnotion of validity. \nIt has been proved that Carnap’s notion of maximal validity\nmakes completeness impossible for quantified S5,\ni.e., that there are L-truths that are not theorems of\nCarnap’s MFC. Let \\(A\\) be a non-modal sentence\nof MFC. By convention (1), \\(\\Box A\\) is true in\nMFC if and only if \\(A\\) is L-true in\nMFC. But \\(A\\) is also a sentence of\nFC, thus if L-true in MFC it\nis also L-true in FC, since the state\ndescriptions (models) of modal functional logic are the same as those\nof functional logic (1946: 54). This means that the state descriptions\nhold the triple role of (i) first-order models of FC\nthereby defining first-order validity, (ii) worlds for\nMFC thereby defining truth for \\(\\Box A\\) sentences\nof MFC, and (iii) models of MFC\nthereby defining validity for MFC. The core of the\nincompleteness argument consists in the fact that the non-validity of\na first-order sentence \\(A\\) can be represented in the modal language,\nas \\(\\neg \\Box A\\), but all models agree on the valuation of modal\nsentences, making \\(\\neg \\Box A\\) valid. Roughly, and setting aside\ncomplications created by the fact that Carnap’s semantics has\nonly denumerable domains, if \\(A\\) is a first-order non-valid sentence\nof FC, \\(A\\) is true in some but not all the models\nor state-descriptions. Given Carnap’s conventions, it follows\nthat \\(\\neg \\Box A\\) is true in MFC. But then \\(\\neg\n\\Box A\\) is L-true in MFC, i.e., in\nMFC \\(\\mvDash \\neg \\Box A\\). Given that the non-valid\nfirst-order sentences are not recursively enumerable, neither are the\nvalidities for the modal system MFC. But the class of\ntheorems of MFC is recursively enumerable. Hence,\nMFC is incomplete vis-à-vis\nCarnap’s maximal validity. Cocchiarella (1975b) attributes the\nresult to Richard Montague and Donald Kalish. See also Lindström\n2001: 209 and Kaplan 1986: 275–276. \nCarnap’s semantics is indeed a precursor of Possible Worlds\nSemantics (PWS). Yet some crucial ingredients are still missing.\nFirst, the maximal notion of validity must be replaced by a new\nuniversal notion. Second, state-descriptions must make space for\npossible worlds understood as indices or points of evaluation. Last, a\nrelation of accessibility between worlds needs to be introduced.\nThough Kripke is by no means the only logician in the fifties and\nearly sixties to work on these ideas, it is in Kripke’s version\nof PWS that all these innovations are present. Kanger (1957),\nMontague (1960, but originally presented in 1955), Hintikka (1961),\nand Prior (1957) were all thinking of a relation between worlds, and\nHintikka (1961) like Kripke (1959a) adopted a new notion of validity\nthat required truth in all arbitrary sets of worlds. But Kripke was\nthe only one to characterize the worlds as simple points of evaluation\n(in 1963a). Other logicians were still thinking of the worlds\nfundamentally as models of first-order logic, though perhaps Prior in\nhis development of temporal logic was also moving towards a more\nabstract characterization of instants of time. Kripke’s more\nabstract characterization of the worlds is crucial in the provision of\na link between the model theoretic semantics and the algebra of modal\nlogic. Kripke saw very clearly this connection between the algebra and\nthe semantics, and this made it possible for him to obtain model\ntheoretic completeness and decidability results for various modal\nsystems in a systematic way. Goldblatt (2003: section 4.8) argues\nconvincingly that Kripke’s adoption of points of evaluation in\nthe model structures is a particularly crucial innovation. Such a\ngeneralization opens the door to different future developments of the\nmodel theory and makes it possible to provide model theories for\nintensional logics in general. For these reasons, in this entry we\ndevote more attention to Kripke’s version of PWS. For a more\ncomprehensive treatment of the initial development of PWS, including\nthe late fifties work on S5 of the French logician\nBayart, the reader is referred to Goldblatt 2003. On the differences\nbetween Kanger’s semantics and standard PWS semantics, see\nLindström 1996 and 1998. \nKripke’s 1959a “A Completeness Theorem in Modal\nLogic” contains a model theoretic completeness result for a\nquantified version of S5 with identity. In\nKripke’s semantic treatment of quantified S5,\nwhich he calls S5*\\(^=\\), an assignment of values to\na formula \\(A\\) in a domain of individuals \\(D\\) assigns a member of\n\\(D\\) to each free individual variable of \\(A\\), a truth value \\(T\\)\nor \\(F\\) to each propositional variable of \\(A\\), and a set of ordered\n\\(n\\)-tuples of members of \\(D\\) to each \\(n\\)-place predicate\nvariable of \\(A\\) (the language for the system contains no non-logical\nconstants). Kripke defines a model over a non-empty domain\n\\(D\\) of individuals as an ordered pair \\((G, K)\\), such that \\(G\\in\nK, K\\) is an arbitrary subset of assignments of values to the\nformulas of S5*\\(^=\\), and all \\(H\\in K\\) agree on\nthe assignments to individual variables. For each \\(H\\in K\\), the\nvalue that \\(H\\) assigns to a formula \\(B\\) is defined inductively.\nPropositional variables are assigned \\(T\\) or \\(F\\) by hypothesis. If\n\\(B\\) is \\(P(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)\\), \\(B\\) is assigned \\(T\\) if and only\nif the \\(n\\)-tuple of elements assigned to \\(x_1\\), …, \\(x_n\\)\nbelongs to the set of \\(n\\)-tuples of individuals that \\(H\\) assigns\nto \\(P. H\\) assigns \\(T\\) to \\(\\neg B\\) if and only if it assigns\n\\(F\\) to \\(B. H\\) assigns \\(T\\) to \\(B\\wedge C\\) if and only if it\nassigns \\(T\\) to \\(B\\) and to \\(C\\). If \\(B\\) is \\(x = y\\) it is\nassigned \\(T\\) if and only if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are assigned the same\nvalue in \\(D\\). If \\(B\\) is \\((\\forall x)Fx\\) it is assigned \\(T\\) if\nand only if \\(Fx\\) is assigned \\(T\\) for every assignment to \\(x\\).\n\\(\\Box B\\) is assigned \\(T\\) if and only if \\(B\\) is assigned \\(T\\) by\nevery \\(H\\in K\\). \nThe most important thing to be noticed in the 1959 model theory is the\ndefinition of validity. A formula \\(A\\) is said to be valid in a\nmodel \\((G, K)\\) in \\(D\\) if and only if it is assigned \\(T\\) in\n\\(G\\), to be valid in a domain \\(D\\) if and only if it is\nvalid in every model in \\(D\\), and to be universally valid if\nand only if it is valid in every non-empty domain. Kripke says:  \nIn trying to construct a definition of universal logical validity, it\nseems plausible to assume not only that the universe of discourse may\ncontain an arbitrary number of elements and that predicates may be\nassigned any given interpretations in the actual world, but also that\nany combination of possible worlds may be associated with the real\nworld with respect to some group of predicates. In other words,\nit is plausible to assume that no further restrictions need be placed\non \\(D, G\\), and \\(K\\), except the standard one that \\(D\\) be\nnon-empty. This assumption leads directly to our definition of\nuniversal validity. (1959a: 3)  \nThis new universal notion of validity is much more general than\nCarnap’s maximal validity. The elements \\(H\\) of \\(K\\) still\ncorrespond to first-order models, like Carnap’s\nstate-descriptions, and in each Kripke model the elements \\(H\\) of\n\\(K\\) are assigned the same domain \\(D\\) of individuals and the\nindividual variables have a fixed cross-model assignment. So far the\nonly significant divergence from Carnap is that different Kripke\nmodels can have domains of different cardinality. This by itself is\nsufficient to reintroduce completeness for the non-modal part of the\nsystem. But the most significant development, and the one that makes\nit possible to prove completeness for the modal system, is the\ndefinition of validity not as truth in all worlds of a maximal\nstructure of worlds, but as truth across all the subsets of the\nmaximal structure. The consideration of arbitrary subsets of possible\nworlds, makes it possible for Kripke’s model theory to\ndisconnect validity from necessity. While necessities are relative to\na model, hence to a set of worlds, validities must hold across all\nsuch sets. This permits the reintroduction of the rule of Uniform\nSubstitution. To see this intuitively in a simple case, consider an\natomic sentence \\(p\\). The classical truth-table for \\(p\\) contains\ntwo rows, one where \\(p\\) is true and one where \\(p\\) is false. Each\nrow is like a possible world, or an element \\(H\\) of \\(K\\). If we only\nconsider this complete truth table, we are only considering maximal\nmodels that contain two worlds (it makes no difference which world is\nactual). By the definition of truth for a formula \\(\\Box B, \\Box p\\)\nis false in all the worlds of the maximal model, and \\(\\Diamond p\\) is\ntrue in all of them. If validity is truth in all worlds of this\nmaximal model, like for Carnap, it follows that \\(\\mvDash \\Diamond\np\\), but in S5 \\(\\nmvdash\\Diamond p\\). If instead we\ndefine validity as Kripke does, we have to consider also the\nnon-maximal models that contain only one world, that is incomplete\ntruth-tables that cancel some rows. Hence, there are two more models\nto be taken into consideration: one which contains only one world\n\\(H=G\\) where \\(p\\) is true, hence so is \\(\\Box p\\), and one which\ncontains only one world \\(H=G\\) where \\(p\\) is false and so is \\(\\Box\np\\) as well as \\(\\Diamond p\\). Thanks to this last model \\(\\nmvDash\n\\Diamond p\\). Notice that the crucial innovation is the definition of\nvalidity as truth across all subsets of worlds, not just the maximal\nsubset. The additional fact that validity in a model is defined as\ntruth at the actual world of the model—as opposed to truth at\nall worlds of the model—though revealing of the fact that Kripke\ndid not link the notion of necessity to the notion of validity, is\nirrelevant to this technical result.  \nKripke’s completeness proof makes use of Beth’s method of\nsemantic tableaux. A semantic tableau is used to test whether a\nformula \\(B\\) is a semantic consequence of some formulas \\(A_1,\n\\ldots, A_n\\). The tableau assumes that the formulas \\(A_1, \\ldots,\nA_n\\) are true and \\(B\\) is false and is built according to rules that\nfollow the definitions of the logical connectives. For example, if a\nformula \\(\\neg A\\) is on the left column of the tableau (where true\nformulas are listed), \\(A\\) will be put on the right column (where\nfalse formulas are listed). To deal with modal formulas, sets of\ntableaux must be considered, since if \\(\\Box A\\) is on the right\ncolumn of a tableau, a new auxiliary tableau must be introduced with\n\\(A\\) on its right column. A main tableau and its auxiliary tableaux\nform a set of tableaux. If a formula \\(A\\wedge B\\) is on the right\ncolumn of the main tableau, the set of tableaux splits into two new\nsets of tableaux: one whose main tableau lists \\(A\\) on its right\ncolumn and one whose main tableau lists \\(B\\) on the right column. So\nwe have to consider alternative sets of tableaux. A semantic tableau\nis closed if and only if all its alternative sets are closed. A set of\ntableaux is closed if it contains a tableau (main or auxiliary) that\nreaches a contradiction in the form of (i) one and the same formula\n\\(A\\) appearing in both its columns or (ii) an identity formula of the\nform \\(a = a\\) in its right side (this is an oversimplification of the\ndefinition of a closed tableau, but not harmful for our purposes).\nOversimplifying once more, the structure of Kripke’s\ncompleteness proof consists of proving that a semantic tableau used to\ntest whether a formula \\(B\\) is a semantic consequence of formulas\n\\(A_1, \\ldots, A_n\\) is closed if and only (i) in\nS5*\\(^=\\) \\(A_1, \\ldots, A_n\\vdash B\\) and (ii)\n\\(A_1, \\ldots, A_n\\vDash B\\). This last result is achieved by showing\nhow to build models from semantic tableaux. As a consequence of (i)\nand (ii) we have soundness and completeness for\nS5*\\(^=\\), that is: \\(A_1, \\ldots, A_n\\vdash B\\) if\nand only if \\(A_1, \\ldots, A_n\\vDash B\\). \nThe 1959 paper contains also a proof of the modal counterpart of the\nLöwenhein-Skolem theorem for first-order logic, according to\nwhich if a formula is satisfiable in a non-empty domain then it is\nsatisfiable, and hence valid (true in \\(G)\\), in a model \\((G, K)\\) in\na domain \\(D\\), where both \\(K\\) and \\(D\\) are either finite\nor denumerable; and if a formula is valid in every finite or\ndenumerable domain it is valid in every domain. \nKripke’s 1962 “The Undecidability of Monadic Modal\nQuantification Theory” develops a parallel between first-order\nlogic with one dyadic predicate and first-order monadic modal logic\nwith just two predicate letters, to prove that this fragment of\nfirst-order modal logic is already undecidable. \nOf great importance is the paper “Semantical Analysis of Modal\nLogic I” (Kripke 1963a) where normal systems are treated. It is\nhere that Kripke fully develops the analogy with the algebraic results\nof Jónsson and Tarski and proves completeness and decidability\nfor propositional systems T, S4,\nS5, and B (the Brouwersche system),\nwhich is here introduced. Kripke claims to have derived on his own the\nmain theorem of “Boolean Algebras with Operators” by an\nalgebraic analog of his own semantical methods (69, fn. 2). It is in\nthis paper that two crucial generalizations of the model theory are\nintroduced. The first is the new understanding of the elements \\(H\\)\nof \\(K\\) as simple indices, not assignments of values. Once this\nchange is introduced, the models have to be supplemented by an\nauxiliary function \\(\\Phi\\) needed to assign values to the\npropositional variables relative to worlds. Hence, while in the 1959\nmodel theory  \nthere can be no two worlds in which the same truth-value is\nassigned to each atomic formula [which] turns out to be\nconvenient perhaps for S5, but it is rather\ninconvenient when we treat normal MPC’s in general (1963a: 69)\n \nwe can now have world duplicates. What is most important about the\ndetachment of the elements of \\(K\\) from the evaluation function is\nthat it opens the door to the general consideration of modal frames,\nsets of worlds plus a binary relation between them, and the\ncorrespondence of such frames to modal systems. So, the second new\nelement of the paper, the introduction of a relation \\(R\\) between the\nelements of \\(K\\), naturally accompanies the first. Let it be\nemphasized once again that the idea of a relation between worlds is\nnot new to Kripke. For example, it is already present as an\nalternativeness relation in Montague 1960, Hintikka 1961, and Prior\n1962, where the idea is attributed to Peter Geach. \nIn 1963a Kripke “asks various questions concerning the relation\n\\(R\\)” (1963a: 70). First, he shows that every satisfiable\nformula has a connected model, i.e., a model based on a model\nstructure \\((G, K, R)\\) where for all \\(H\\in K\\), \\(G\\mathrel{R*}H\\),\nwhere \\(R*\\) is the ancestral relation corresponding to \\(R\\). Hence,\nonly connected models need to be considered. Then, Kripke shows the\nnowadays well-known results that axiom 4 corresponds to the\ntransitivity of the relation \\(R\\), that axiom \\(B\\) correspond to\nsymmetry, and that the characteristic axiom of S5\nadded to system T corresponds to \\(R\\) being an\nequivalence relation. Using the method of tableaux, completeness for\nthe modal propositional systems T,\nS4, S5, and B\nvis-à-vis the appropriate class of models (reflexive\nstructures for T) is proved. The decidability of\nthese systems, including the more complex case of S4,\nis also proved. (For a more detailed treatment of frames, consult the\nSEP entry on\n modal logic.) \nIn the 1965 paper “Semantical Analysis of Modal Logic II”,\nKripke extends the model theory to treat non-normal modal systems,\nincluding Lewis’s S2 and S3.\nThough these systems are considered somewhat unnatural, their model\ntheory is deemed elegant. Completeness and decidability results are\nproved vis-à-vis the proper class of structures,\nincluding the completeness of S2 and\nS3, and the decidability of S3. To\nachieve these results, the model theory is extended by the\nintroduction of a new element \\(N\\subseteq K\\) in the model structures\n\\((G, K, R, N). N\\) is the subset of normal worlds, i.e., worlds \\(H\\)\nsuch that \\(H\\mathrel{R}H\\). Another interesting aspect of the\nnon-normal systems is that in the model theoretic results that pertain\nto them, \\(G\\) (the actual world) plays an essential role, in\nparticular in the S2 and S3 model\nstructures the actual world has to be normal. Instead, the rule of\nnecessitation that applies to normal systems makes the choice of \\(G\\)\nmodel theoretically irrelevant. \nThe great success of the Kripkean model theory notwithstanding, it is\nworth emphasizing that not all modal logics are complete. For\nincompleteness results see Makinson 1969, for a system weaker than\nS4; and Fine 1974, S. Thomason 1974, Goldblatt 1975,\nand van Benthem 1978, for systems between S4 and\nS5. Some modal formulas impose conditions on frames\nthat cannot be expressed in a first-order language, thus even\npropositional modal logic is fundamentally second-order in nature.\nInsofar as the notion of validity on a frame abstracts from the\ninterpretation function, it implicitly involves a higher-order\nquantification over propositions. On the correspondence between frame\nvalidity and second-order logic and on the model-theoretic criteria\nthat distinguish the modal sentences that are first-order expressible\nfrom those that are essentially second-order see Blackburn and van\nBenthem’s “Modal Logic: A Semantic Perspective”\n(2007a). \nIn 1963b, “Semantical Considerations on Modal Logic”,\nKripke introduces a new generalization to the models of quantified\nmodal systems. In 1959 a model was defined in a domain \\(D\\). As a\nresult all worlds in one model had the same cardinality. In 1963b\nmodels are not given in a domain, hence worlds in the same model can\nbe assigned different domains by a function \\(\\Psi\\) that assigns\ndomains to the elements \\(H\\) of \\(K\\). Given the variability of\ndomains across worlds, Kripke can now construct counter-examples both\nto the Barcan Formula  \nand its converse \nThe Barcan formula can be falsified in structures with growing\ndomains. For example, a model with two worlds, \\(G\\) and one other\npossible world \\(H\\) extending it. The domain of \\(G\\) is \\(\\{a\\}\\)\nand \\(Fa\\) is true in \\(G\\). The domain of \\(H\\) is the set \\(\\{a,\nb\\}\\) and \\(Fa\\), but not \\(Fb\\), is true in \\(H\\). In this model\n\\((\\forall x)\\Box Fx\\) but not \\(\\Box(\\forall x)Fx\\) is true in \\(G\\).\nTo disprove the converse of the Barcan formula we need models with\ndecreasing domains. For example, a model with two worlds \\(G\\) and\n\\(H\\), where the domain of \\(G\\) is \\(\\{a, b\\}\\) and the domain of\n\\(H\\) is \\(\\{a\\}\\), with \\(Fa\\) and \\(Fb\\) true in \\(G, Fa\\) true in\n\\(H\\), but \\(Fb\\) false in \\(H\\). This model requires that we assign a\ntruth-value to the formula \\(Fb\\) in the world \\(H\\) where the\nindividual \\(b\\) does not exist (is not in the domain of \\(H)\\).\nKripke points out that from a model theoretical point of view this is\njust a technical choice. \nKripke reconstructs a proof of the converse Barcan formula in\nquantified T and shows that the proof goes through\nonly by allowing the necessitation of a sentence containing a free\nvariable. But if free variables are instead to be considered as\nuniversally bound, this step is illicit. Necessitating directly an\nopen formula, without first closing it, amounts to assuming what is to\nbe proved. Prior 1956 contains a proof of the Barcan formula  \nKripke does not discuss the details of Prior’s proof.\nPrior’s proof for the Barcan formula adopts\nŁukasiewicz’s rules for the introduction of the existential\nquantifier. The second of these rules states that if \\(\\mvdash\nA\\rightarrow B\\) then \\(\\mvdash A\\rightarrow(\\exists x)B\\). Prior uses\nthe rule to derive  \nfrom  \nThis seems to us to be the ‘illegitimate’ step in the\nproof, since  \ndoes not hold in a model with two worlds \\(G\\) and \\(H\\), where the\ndomain of \\(G\\) is \\(\\{a\\}\\) and the domain of \\(H\\) is \\(\\{a, b\\}\\),\nand where \\(Fa\\) is false in both \\(G\\) and \\(H\\), but \\(Fb\\) is true\nin \\(H\\). In this model \\(\\Diamond Fx\\) is true but \\((\\exists\nx)\\Diamond Fx\\) is false in \\(G\\). In this counter-model \\(\\Diamond\nFx\\) is made true in \\(G\\) by the individual \\(b\\) that is not in the\ndomain of \\(G\\). In general, the rule that if \\(\\mvdash A\\rightarrow\nB\\) then \\(\\mvdash A\\rightarrow(\\exists x)B\\) does not preserve\nvalidity if we allow that \\(Fx\\) may be made true at a world by an\nindividual that does not exist there. We conclude that the rule is to\nbe rejected to preserve the soundness of S5\nrelatively to this model theoretic assumption.","contact.mail":"rballari@mail.ubc.ca","contact.domain":"mail.ubc.ca"}]
