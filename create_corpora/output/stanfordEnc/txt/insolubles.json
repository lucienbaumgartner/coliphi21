From the\nlate-twelfth century to the end of the Middle Ages and beyond, such\nparadoxes were discussed at length by an enormous number of authors.\nYet, unlike twentieth century interest in the paradoxes, medieval\ninterest seems not to have been prompted by any sense of theoretical\n“crisis”.\n\n\nThe history of the medieval discussions can be divided into three main\nperiods: (a) an early stage, from the late-twelfth century to the\n1320s; (b) a period of especially intense and original work, during\nroughly the second quarter of the fourteenth century; (c) a late\nperiod, from about 1350 on. The discussion in this article will be\norganized as follows:\n\nThe Liar Paradox was well known to antiquity. Its discovery is often\ncredited to Eubulides the Megarian (4th century BCE), on the basis of\na remark by Diogenes Laertius (Lives of the Philosophers\nII.108), although in fact Diogenes says only that Eubulides discussed\nthe paradox, not that he discovered\n it.[2]\n A little later, the poet and grammarian Philetus (or Philitas) of Cos\n(c. 330–c. 270 BCE), if we are to believe the story in Athenaeus\nof Naucratis’s Deipnosophists IX.401e, worried so much\nover the Liar that he wasted away and died of insomnia, as, according\nto Athenaeus, his epitaph recorded: \nPhiletus of Cos am I\n\n’Twas The Liar who made me die,\n\nAnd the bad nights caused\n thereby.[3] \nDiogenes Laertius also reports (VII.196–98) that, in addition to\na huge number of other works on a variety of topics, the Stoic\nlogician Chrysippus (c. 279–206 BCE) wrote: \nUnfortunately, almost none of Chrysippus’ work survives. \nNonetheless, it does not appear that medieval interest in insolubles\nwas derived directly from these or any other known ancient sources\nthat discuss the Liar. Many of the relevant works were lost (e.g., the\nworks of Chrysippus), while others were never translated into Latin\nand so were effectively unavailable to the Latin Middle Ages, though\nthings may be different for the Arabic and Byzantine traditions, which\nare only starting to be studied (see, e.g., Alwishah & Sanson\n2009; Gerogiorgakis 2009). Indeed, it is not at all clear just what it\nwas that prompted medieval interest. One might have supposed that,\neven if particular theories about the Liar were not transmitted to the\nLatin West from antiquity, at least formulations of Liar-type\nparadoxes must have been known and available to stimulate the medieval\ndiscussions. In fact, however, there are strikingly few\npossibilities. \nSeneca (Epistle 45.10), for instance, mentions the Liar\nparadox by its Greek name pseudomenon, but does not actually\nformulate it. Again, St Augustine perhaps has the Liar in mind in his\nAgainst the Academicians (Contra academicos\nIII.13.29), where he refers to the “most lying calumny,\n‘if it is true [it is] false, if it is false it is\ntrue’”. But neither passage would likely be sufficient by\nitself to suggest the special problems of the Liar to anyone not\nalready familiar with them. \nSomewhat more explicit is Aulus Gellius’s (2nd century CE)\nAttic Nights (XVIII.ii.10), “When I lie and say I am\nlying, am I lying or speaking the truth?” But Gellius was not\nwidely read in the Middle Ages, and no known medieval author cites him\nin the context of\n insolubles.[4]\n Again, Cicero’s Academica priora,\nII.xxix.95–xxx.97, contains a fairly clear formulation:  \nIf you lie and speak that truth [namely, that you lie], are you lying\nor speaking the truth?  … If you say you lie, and you speak the\ntruth, you lie; but you say you lie, and you speak the truth;\ntherefore, you lie.  \nBut this passage is never cited in the\ninsolubilia-literature. Moreover Cicero, who wrote in Latin\nand so did not have to be translated to be available to the Middle\nAges, calls such paradoxes “inexplicables”\n(inexplicabilia). If he was the catalyst for the medieval\ndiscussions, we would have expected to find that term in the\ninsolubilia-literature, and we do not; the unanimous medieval\nterm is ‘insolubles’. \nOne initially plausible stimulus for the medieval discussions would\nappear to be the Epistle to Titus 1:12: “One of themselves, even\na prophet of their own, said, The Cretians [= Cretans] are always\nliars, evil beasts, slow bellies”. The Cretan in question is\ntraditionally said to have been the sixth-century BCE thinker\nEpimenides. For this reason, the Liar Paradox is nowadays sometimes\nreferred to as the “Epimenides”. Yet, blatant as the\nparadox is here, and authoritative as the Epistle was taken to be, not\na single medieval author is known to have discussed or even\nacknowledged the logical and semantic problems this text poses. When\nmedieval authors discuss the passage at all, for instance in\nScriptural commentaries, they seem to be concerned only with why St.\nPaul should be quoting pagan\n sources.[5]\n It is not known who was the first to link this text with the Liar\nParadox. \nBy contrast with these passages, none of which was cited in the\ninsolubilia-literature, there is a text from\nAristotle’s Sophistical Refutations 25, [A-SR]:\n180a27–b7, that, almost from the very beginning of the\ninsolubilia-literature to the end of the Middle Ages, served\nas the framework for discussing insolubles. It occurs in\nAristotle’s discussion of the fallacy of confusing things said\n“in a certain respect” (secundum quid) with\nthings said “absolutely” or “without\nqualification” (simpliciter). In this context,\nAristotle considers someone who takes an oath that he will become an\noath-breaker, and then does so. Absolutely or without qualification,\nAristotle says, such a man is an oath-breaker, even though with\nrespect to the particular oath to become an oath-breaker he\nis an oath-keeper. Then Aristotle adds the intriguing remark,\n“The argument is similar too concerning the same man’s\nlying and speaking the truth at the same time” ([A-SR]:\n180b2–3). It was this sentence that many medieval authors took\nto be a reference to the Liar Paradox, which therefore, on the\nauthority of Aristotle, could be solved as a fallacy secundum quid\net simpliciter. \nThe widespread appeal to this passage throughout the history of the\ninsolubilia-literature indicates that the text did play some\nrole in prompting medieval interest in insolubles. This suggestion is\nreinforced by the fact that the earliest known medieval statement of\nthe Liar occurs in 1132, around the time the Sophistical\nRefutations first began to circulate in Western Europe in Latin\ntranslation (see\n Section 2\n below). \nNevertheless, it is not immediately obvious how Aristotle’s\nremarks can be made to fit the Liar Paradox. The oath-breaker, as the\nexample was generally interpreted, takes two oaths: one,\nwhich he keeps, that he will commit perjury, and a second (it does not\nmatter what it is) that he breaks, thereby fulfilling the first oath.\nThe man is an oath-breaker and an oath-fulfiller, but with respect to\ndifferent oaths; by breaking his second oath, rendering it\nfalse, he fulfills the first oath, making it true. However, it is\npossible to interpret the passage as referring to a single oath, when\nthe oath is broken at the same time as it is made. Seen that way, it\nconnects the Liar paradox with the fallacy secundum quid et\n simpliciter.[6] \nIn short, it seems clear that the Sophistical Refutations was\ninstrumental in prompting medieval interest in insolubles. But more\nmust have been involved too. Martin (1993) suggests a connection with\ntheories of obligations (cf.\n Section 3.3\n below). Before medieval logicians could formulate genuine Liar-type\nparadoxes, they first had to go well beyond anything found in\nAristotle’s text. At present we cannot say whether they did this\non the basis of some still unidentified ancient source or whether it\nwas through their own intellectual power and logical insight. \nThe medievals discussed many more insolubles than the Liar Paradox,\nthough most can be seen as variants of it. One common variant was what\nis now called the ‘yes’-‘no’ paradox: Socrates\nsays “What Plato is saying is false”, while Plato says\n“What Socrates is saying is true” (see, e.g., Buridan\n[B-SD]: 974). There is also the ‘no’-‘no’\nparadox, where Plato instead says “What Socrates is saying is\nfalse” (Buridan [B-SD]: 971). There is even a\n‘no’-‘no’-‘no’ paradox, where\nSocrates says that Plato is saying something false, Plato that Cicero\nis saying something false and Cicero that Socrates is saying something\nfalse (Albert [AS-I]: 353). There are conjunctive insolubles, e.g.,\n“God exists and some conjunction is false”, where God has\nannihilated any other conjunction, and disjunctive insolubles, e.g.,\n“A man is an ass or some disjunction is false”, where God\nhas instead annihilated any other disjunctive proposition (Albert\n[AS-I]: 357–8). There is also a nice example where a landowner\nhas decreed that only those who speak truly will be allowed across his\nbridge and those who lie about their business will be thrown in the\nwater (or maybe even hanged on the nearby gallows). When Socrates is\nchallenged on coming to the river, he says “You will throw me in\nthe water” (Bradwardine [B-I]: 135; Buridan [B-SD]: 993; see\nalso Cervantes Don Quixote, vol. II book III ch. XIX, p.\n714). \nThe medievals discovered what is now usually referred to as\nCurry’s Paradox, either in the form “If this conditional\nis true then a man is an ass” (see Read 2009: section 9), or in\nits contraposed form, “If God exists then some conditional is\nfalse” (where this is the only conditional: Albert [AS-I]: 359).\nThere were also epistemic paradoxes, such as “You do not know\nthis proposition” (Bradwardine [B-I]: 139): you do not know it,\nfor if you did, it would be true and you would not know it. But now\nyou must realise that you do know it. Such insolubles can involve\ndoubt as well as knowledge, e.g., “Socrates knows the\nproposition written on the wall to be doubtful to him” (see\n note 32).\n Further insolubles arise from the medieval theory of (logical)\n Obligations,\n e.g., “Something proposed is denied by you” (Bradwardine\n[B-I]: 125), and “The king is sitting or a disjunctive doubt is\nproposed” (Bradwardine [B-I]: 151)—in the theory of\nobligations, the respondent is taken never to know whether the king is\nsitting. \nIn 1132, Adam of Balsham, the founder of the important logical school\nof the “Parvipontani” (so called because they\ngathered at the Petit Pont in Paris), wrote an Art of\nDiscussing (Ars disserendi), in which he treats, among\nother things, various kinds of yes/no questions, including\n“whether he speaks truly who says he lies” and\n“whether he who says nothing but that he lies is speaking the\ntruth”. ([AB]: 107.) \nThe importance of this passage should not be exaggerated. It is true\nthat it gives us the earliest known explicit medieval formulation of\nthe\n Liar.[7]\n But Adam makes no attempt to solve the paradox, does not say it was a\ncurrent topic of discussion in his day, and in fact does not even\nindicate he recognized its paradoxicalness. He simply offers it as an\nexample of one kind of yes/no question. \nIt is not until later in the twelfth century that one finds an\nexplicit statement of the special problems raised by insolubles. In\nhis On the Natures of Things (De naturis rerum), of\nunknown date but apparently well known by the end of the century,\nAlexander Neckham ([N-NR]: 289)\n says[8]: \nAgain, if Socrates says he lies, and says nothing else, he says some\nproposition. Therefore, either a true one or a false one. Therefore,\nif Socrates says only that he lies, he says what is true or what is\nfalse. \nBut if (1) Socrates says only the proposition that Socrates lies, and\nhe says what is true, then it is true that Socrates lies. And\nif it is true that Socrates lies, Socrates says what is false.\nTherefore, if Socrates says only the proposition that Socrates lies,\nand he says what is true, he says what is false. \nBut if (2) Socrates says only the proposition that Socrates lies, and\nhe says what is false, then it is false that Socrates says\nwhat is false. And if it is false that Socrates says what is false,\nSocrates does not say what is false. But if Socrates says only that he\nlies, he says either what is true or what is false. Therefore, if\nSocrates says he lies, he says what is true. Therefore, if Socrates\nsays only that he lies, and he says what is false, then he says what\nis true. \nBut if Socrates says only that he lies, he says what is true or false.\nTherefore, if Socrates says only that he lies, he says what is true\nand says what is false. \nNevertheless, although it is clear that Neckham was fully aware of\nwhat is paradoxical about the Liar, he makes no attempt to\nsolve the paradox. He presents it only as an example of the\n“vanities” logic deals with. This suggests that by his day\nothers were trying to solve the paradox, and in fact in the\ndiscussion of the fallacy secundum quid et simpliciter\ncontained in the so-called Munich Logic\n(= Dialectica Monacensis) from sometime in the second\nhalf of the century, we find the remark: “But how this fallacy\narises in uttering the insoluble ‘I am saying a\nfalsehood’, that is a matter discussed in the treatise on\n insolubles”.[9] \nThe first text we have that actually tries to solve the paradox is an\nanonymous treatise from the very end of the twelfth or the very early\nthirteenth century (De Rijk 1966). From then on, there are a great\nnumber of surviving treatments (see Spade 1975). In the early 1320s,\nThomas Bradwardine, in a preliminary section of his own treatise on\ninsolubles, lists nine views in circulation in his day, including his\nown (see Bradwardine [B-I], ch. 2; Spade 1987: 43–46). Some of\nthese views can no longer be identified in the texts that survive from\nthe period before Bradwardine, but among the surviving views, we can\ndistinguish five broad approaches to “solving” the\n paradox.[10]\n (Sometimes these approaches are combined in a single author.) \nAs might be expected in view of\n Section 1.3\n above, many of these early theories attempted to analyze insolubles\nas fallacies secundum quid et simpliciter. Later in the\ninsolubilia-literature, discussions often continued to be\ncast in terms of this fallacy. It was claimed in (Spade 1987: 32) that\ntheir real focus was generally on entirely different theoretical\nissues, and that the role of the fallacy thus became purely\n“honorary”, preserving the authority of Aristotle.\nHowever, that assessment was challenged in (Dutilh Novaes & Read\n2008). Bradwardine, for example, explicitly and repeatedly casts his\nsolution in terms of Aristotle’s discussion, making actual (not\nmerely “honorary”) use of the conceptual framework offered\nby the fallacy secundum quid et\n simpliciter.[11] \nAristotle had suggested ([A-SR]: 180b5–7) that insolubles are\nfalse simpliciter (absolutely/without qualification), but\ntrue secundum quid (in a certain respect). Some authors in\nthe early medieval literature, however, argued that insolubles are\nwithout qualification neither true nor false, but only true in a\ncertain respect and false in a certain\n respect.[12]\n Others used the terminology of simpliciter and secundum\nquid, but applied it to reference (suppositio) rather\nthan to truth and falsehood, so that in insolubles certain terms did\nnot refer “without qualification” to their referents, but\nonly “in a certain respect”. This view is in effect a kind\nof restriction on\n self-reference.[13] \nThe theory of transcasus has nothing to do with the fallacy\nsecundum quid et simpliciter, although it too seems to have\nhad its origins in antiquity. The word transcasus is not a\ncommon Latin word. It seems to be a literal translation of Greek\nmetaptosis. In Stoic logic, propositions that change their\ntruth value over time were called metapiptonta (from the same\nroot). Walter Burley in fact used the word transcasus exactly\nthis way in 1302 in two short logical works (Spade 1987:\n33–34). \nNevertheless, in the particular context of insolubles, while the term\ntranscasus does have an association with time, it does not\nimply any change of truth value over time. Rather the theory\nof transcasus held that in the proposition “This\nstatement is false”, the term “false” refers\nnot to the proposition in which it occurs, but rather to some\nproposition uttered earlier. Thus, when the liar says “I am\nlying”, what he really means is “What I said just a moment\nago was a lie”. If the speaker did not in fact say anything\nearlier, then his present statement is simply false and no paradox\n arises.[14] \nThis odd view, like the last of those discussed in\n Section 2.1\n above, amounts in practice to a restriction on self-reference. But it\nis not clear exactly what motivated it. In any event, the theory of\ntranscasus appears to have disappeared as a theory actually\nheld by anyone after the early period, although it continued to be\nmentioned in later authors’ surveys of earlier\n views.[15] \nA third theory from this early period distinguishes the\n“exercised” act from the “signified” or\n“conceived” act. The details of this theory are not yet\nwell understood, but the basic strategy is to distinguish what the\nliar says he is doing (namely, lying) from what he really\nis doing. The author of the Questions on the Sophistical\nRefutations attributed to John Duns Scotus, who held a version of\nthis theory (Scotus [DS-Q], questions 52–53, pp. 505–15),\nthought that what the liar is really doing (the “exercised\nact”) is speaking the truth. In order to avoid the paradox, this\ntheory would seem to be committed to saying that the exercised act and\nthe signified act are two distinct acts, so that the theory,\nlike the theory of transcasus\n (Section 2.2\n above), is committed to some kind of restriction on\n self-reference.[16] \nEven when not combined with transcasus or the theory that\ndistinguishes exercised act from signified act, a very popular\napproach throughout the insolubilia-literature, in the early\nperiod (and for that matter even in our own day), before\nBradwardine’s sustained attack on it (see\n  Section 3.1),\n was to deny or restrict the possibility of self-reference. Such\ntheories had the title “restriction” (restrictio)\nand their proponents were called “restricters”\n(restringentes). All such theories maintained that in some or\neven all cases, terms in propositions could not “supposit\nfor” (stand for, refer to) the propositions in which they\noccur. \nSome theories of restriction went further and also ruled out other\npatterns of reference. For example: \nAs a general theory, restriction is open to an obvious objection: it\nrules out innocuous forms of reference along with pathological ones.\nThe sentence “This sentence has five words” is not\nparadoxical, after all, even though it is self-referential; in fact,\nit seems obviously true. Yet the general theory of restriction would\ndisallow it. \nMedieval authors sometimes raised this objection. As a result, we find\ntwo kinds of restriction-theories in the medieval literature:\n(a) general or strong theories that rule out self-reference, and\nperhaps other patterns of reference too, in innocuous as well as\npathological cases; and (b) more specialized or weaker theories that\nrule out certain forms of reference only when they result in paradox.\nWalter Burley and William of Ockham, for example, held the latter form\nof restriction (Spade 1974). \nIf general or strong theories of restriction are open to the objection\nstated above, the weaker theories are open to a different objection:\nthey risk being vacuous if their proponents did not have any\nindependent way of identifying paradoxical cases. Perhaps, their\ntheories amounted to saying “all forms of reference are allowed,\nexcept for paradoxical ones, which are not allowed”. This is no\ndoubt true, but it is also a\n tautology.[17] \nUnlike restriction, which remained (and remains) a popular view, the\ntheory of “cassation” disappeared very early (though it\nhas its contemporary advocates). It is maintained in the earliest\nknown treatise on insolubles (De Rijk 1966) and in one other early\nanonymous text (Spade 1975: 43–44), but seems to have died out\nafter about 1225, although it continued to be mentioned in later\nauthors’ surveys of previous views, no doubt because of its\ninclusion in Bradwardine’s own survey. It was briefly revived by\nJohn Dumbleton in the 1330s: see (Spade 1975 item XXXVI, pp.\n63–5). His essential idea was that signification requires\nuptake, so any utterance which cannot be understood cannot constitute\na proposition—and the insolubles defy understanding, for\nself-reference generates a regress of deferred intelligibility.  \n‘Cassation’ is now an archaic word (though it survives in\nlegal documents), but merely means “making null and void,\ncanceling”. In effect, this theory holds that one who utters an\ninsoluble proposition “isn’t saying anything”. The\nsecond of the texts just cited even gives a curious “ordinary\nlanguage” argument, appealing to the rusticus (the\nman-on-the-street), who, if you were to say to him “What I am\nsaying is false”, would reply “Nil dicis”\n(“You are saying nothing”). \nThe treatise in De Rijk 1966 presents more of a theory. Much of it is\nobscure to modern scholars, but it seems to appeal to a distinction\nbetween a mental act of asserting and a vocal act of uttering a\nproposition. “Saying” requires both acts; it is “an\nassertion with utterance”. In the case of the liar who says\n“What I am saying is false”, the mental act of asserting\nis present, and for that matter so is the physical act of uttering the\nwords. But somehow (this is the obscure part) there is no\n“saying”. \nIt is tempting to interpret this view as an appeal to a kind of\nfallacy of composition; just as someone who is both good and an author\nis not necessarily a good author, so too something that is both\nmentally asserted and vocally uttered is not necessarily\n“said” (asserted with utterance). It is tempting, yes, but\nhighly speculative. Nevertheless, whatever the correct interpretation,\nit appears that the distinction between asserting and uttering drawn\nby this theory escapes the facile “refutation” of it used\nas early as the mid-thirteenth century, that it “plainly\ncontradicts sensation that is not\n deceived”.[18] \nThe preceding theories represent the earliest stage of the\ninsolubilia-literature. Although these theories are sometimes\nmentioned in the later literature, and in the case of\n“restriction” often accepted in the later\nliterature, much more sophisticated treatments began to emerge in the\nsecond quarter of the fourteenth century. The turning point is Thomas\nBradwardine, whose own theory was enormously influential on later\nauthors. Shortly after Bradwardine, two other English authors from\nthis middle period are also important: Roger Swyneshed\n (Section 3.2),\n and William Heytesbury\n (Section 3.3).\n A little later, important contributions were made by Parisian\nauthors, Gregory of Rimini\n (Section 3.4),\n John Buridan\n (Section 3.5)\n and Albert of Saxony\n (Section 3.6). \nThomas Bradwardine (c. 1300–1349) wrote his Insolubles\nat Oxford sometime between 1321 and 1324. It became one of the most\nimportant works on the topic in the Middle Ages. In fact, early in the\nthird quarter of the fourteenth century, Ralph Strode, in his own\ntreatise on the topic, surveys the earlier views (quoting\nBradwardine’s own survey and theory almost verbatim), and then\nsays (Spade 1981: 116): \nFor the opinions mentioned above were those of the old [logicians],\nwho understood little or nothing about insolubles. After them there\narose the prince of modern philosophers of nature, namely Master\nThomas Bradwardine. He was the first one who discovered something\nworthwhile about insolubles. \nBradwardine’s theory is built around a distinctive theory of\ntruth, which in turn depends on a conception of signification,\ndescribed by Spade as an “adverbial” theory of\npropositional signification (Spade 1996: 178–85\n [Other Internet Resources];\n cf. Read 2008b: §13.2). By virtue of their constituent terms,\npropositions signify things; but, in addition, a proposition as a\nwhole signifies that such-and-such is the case. This\nconception may be related to Walter Burley’s theory of the\npropositio in re (see, e.g., Cesalli 2001). It is this latter\nkind of signification that is the basis for Bradwardine’s theory\nof truth. \nFor Bradwardine, a proposition is (D1) true if it signifies\nonly as is the case (tantum sicut est), and (D2)\nfalse if it signifies otherwise than is the case (aliter quam\nest). Note the absence of the ‘only’ in the criterion\nfor falsehood. Truth therefore, is more demanding than falsehood. In\norder for a proposition to be true, all of what it signifies\nto be the case must in fact be the case; if any of what it\nsignifies to be the case fails to be the case, the\nproposition is false. He will then argue that insolubles signify more\nthan at first appears, and that not everything they signify can be the\ncase. Consequently, they are simply false.  \nThus what is most distinctive in Bradwardine’s theory is his\n“multiple-meanings” theory of signification. For him,\npropositions signify many things, not in the sense of being ambiguous,\nbut as requiring a multitude of conditions to be satisfied for their\ntruth. For example, ‘Some man is running’ signifies not\nonly that a man is running, but also that there is a man, and a\nrunner. Indeed, Bradwardine claims that a proposition signifies\neverything which follows from it. This is his famous second postulate,\n(P2). There is considerable controversy over its correct\ninterpretation (for a careful discussion, see Dutilh Novaes 2009:\n§1). (P2) is interpreted by Spade (1981:120) as what he calls\n“Bradwardine’s Principle” (BP):  \nIf p only if q, then P signifies that\nq, \nwhere the name replacing ‘P’ names the sentence\nreplacing ‘p’. However, he concedes that, when read\nin this way, the principle does not support the proof Bradwardine\ngives of his second thesis, (T2), which we will discuss below.\nAccordingly, Spade attributes a further principle to Bradwardine, the\n“Converse Bradwardine Principle”\n (CBP):[19] \nWhatever a sentence signifies follows from it. If P signifies\nthat q, then p only if q. \nHowever, he admits that Bradwardine never states or mentions this\nprinciple, and that with it, Bradwardine’s solution\ncollapses. \nIt is claimed in Read 2009 that (P2) should be interpreted more\ngenerously, not in terms of how it is actually stated by Bradwardine,\nbut how it is actually used by him. As used, it is a closure\nprinciple, that a proposition signifies everything which follows from\nwhat it signifies. This arguably has (BP) as a consequence, but is\nstronger than it, and sufficient for Bradwardine’s proof of\n(T2). \nBradwardine’s solution to the insolubles is stated in his second\nthesis, (T2): “Every proposition which signifies that it itself\nis not true, or is false, also signifies that it is true and is\nfalse”. The proof has four stages: \nIn the subsequent chapter, Ch. 7, Bradwardine considers the problem of\nrevenge in various guises. (See, e.g., the entry on the\n  Liar paradox, and especially\nthe section on Expressive power and ‘revenge’.)\nTake Socrates’ utterance of\n‘Socrates utters a falsehood’, where Socrates utters\nnothing else. Bradwardine’s claim is that Socrates’\nutterance is false, that is, that Socrates utters a falsehood. How can\nBradwardine’s claim that Socrates utters a falsehood be true,\nwhile Socrates’ utterance of the same thing is false? The\nreason, Bradwardine replies, is that Socrates’ utterance is\nself-referential, and signifies not only that Socrates’\nutterance is false but also, by (T2), that it is true (and so is\nfalse), whereas Bradwardine’s utterance is not self-referential\nand so not subject to\n (T2).[20] \nSometime between roughly 1330 and 1335, the English Benedictine Roger\nSwyneshed adopted a theory in some respects reminiscent of\nBradwardine’s, but with interesting features of its own. Like\nBradwardine, Swyneshed held that for a proposition to be true, it is\nnot enough that it “signify as is the case”. But whereas\nBradwardine maintained that in addition the proposition must not\nsignify otherwise than is the case (that is, it must signify\nonly as is the case), Swyneshed said that in addition the\nproposition must not “falsify itself”. Insolubles do\nfalsify themselves, and so are false for that reason, even though they\nsignify as is the case. Propositions that falsify themselves are said\nto be those that are “relevant (pertinens) to inferring\nthat they are false”. \nThe notions of “relevance”,\n“self-falsification”, and “signifying as is the\ncase” (or “otherwise than is the case”) are puzzling\nones in Swyneshed’s theory and the subject of ongoing\n study.[21]\n But the main historical interest of his theory does not lie there.\nRather, it lies in three famous and controversial conclusions he drew\nfrom his principles: \nMany authors found these conclusions ridiculous, especially the second\nand third ones. But they had their defenders as\n well.[24] \nTwo other features of Swyneshed’s theory should be at least\nmentioned, although our understanding of his view does not yet allow a\nthorough treatment of them. Along with other authors (e.g., Buridan),\nhe explicitly holds that while valid inference does not always\npreserve truth, it does preserve the property of signifying as is the\ncase. Second, Swyneshed explicitly considers a situation where\na = ‘a does not signify as is the case’, and\nsays that a is neither true nor false in that situation. This\nis the only known case of a medieval author’s actually allowing\nfailure of bivalence for insolubles, even though several authors refer\nto (and reject) such\n theories.[25] \nIn 1335, the Mertonian logician and philosopher of nature William\nHeytesbury wrote an important treatise Rules for Solving\nSophisms (Regulae solvendi\n sophismata).[26]\n The first of its six chapters is on insolubles. The Rules as\na whole, and this first chapter in particular, were widely read and\ncommented on, particularly in Italy in the late-fourteenth and\nfifteenth centuries (see, e.g.,\n Section 4.3\n below). Indeed, Heytesbury’s theory is a competitor to\nBradwardine’s as the most influential theory of insolubles in\nthe whole of the Middle\n Ages.[27] \nHeytesbury treated insolubles as paradoxical only with respect\nto certain assumed circumstances (what he calls the\ncasus or “hypothesis”). For example, the\nproposition ‘Socrates is uttering a falsehood’ is not\nparadoxical in the abstract, all by itself, but only in contexts\nwhere, say, it is Socrates who utters that proposition, the\nproposition is the only proposition Socrates utters (it is\nnot an embedded quotation, for instance, part of some larger statement\nhe is making), and where his proposition signifies just as it normally\ndoes. Spoken and written language are thoroughly arbitrary, for\nmedieval authors, so that the vocal sequence or inscription\n‘Socrates is uttering a falsehood’ could theoretically\nsignify any way you want. It might, for example, signify that 2 + 2 =\n4, in which case it would not be insoluble at all but\nstraightforwardly true. \nIt is the last condition that is the focal point for\nHeytesbury’s attack. He holds that in the casus where\nSocrates himself says just ‘Socrates is uttering a\nfalsehood’ and nothing else, his proposition cannot, on\npain of contradiction, signify just as it normally does\n(precise sicut verba communiter pretendunt, as he puts it).\nIf it does signify as it normally does, it must signify some other way\nas well. \nHow else might it signify? Heytesbury did not think it was his duty to\nanswer that question, as Bradwardine did. The proposition’s\nadditional signification cannot be predicted, given the arbitrariness\nof spoken and written language. Depending on what else it signifies,\ndifferent verdicts about the proposition are appropriate. In short,\nHeytesbury’s strategy is to say,  \nYou tell me exactly what Socrates’s statement\nsignifies, and I’ll tell you first of all whether the case you\ndescribe is possible, and if it is, I’ll tell you whether his\nstatement is true or false. \nThis “shift the burden” strategy is a consequence of the\nfact that Heytesbury, even more than Bradwardine and Swyneshed, views\nthe question of insolubles in the context of obligationes, a\nhighly formalized medieval disputation context that is a subject of\nmuch recent\n discussion.[28]\n But many later authors felt that Heytesbury had simply sidestepped\nthe real theoretical issue, and went on to stipulate what Heytesbury\nwould not: an insoluble’s “additional”\nsignification. They held that, in circumstances that make it\ninsoluble, a proposition not only signifies as it normally does; it\nalso signifies that it is true. This “adjustment”\nto Heytesbury’s theory has the effect of combining it with the\ntradition stemming from\n Bradwardine.[29]\n It proved to be an appealing combination. \nGregory of Rimini’s main writing was done in the 1340s. Although\ntoday we know of no text or passage of his that discusses insolubles,\nthere must have been one, because in 1372 Peter of Ailly cites\nGregory’s theory in some detail and uses it in writing his own\ntreatise on insolubles (see Peter of Ailly [P-CI], and\n Section 4.2\n below).  \nGregory’s view relied on the traditional medieval notion (going\nback to Aristotle’s On Interpretation 1, 16a3–5)\nof “mental language”, the “language of\nthought” that underlies and is expressed in spoken and written\n language.[30]\n Unlike spoken and written languages, where the signification of words\nand propositions is thoroughly a matter of convention, signification\nin mental language is fixed by nature once and for all, the same for\neveryone. It follows that propositions in mental language can never\nsignify otherwise than they “normally” do. Thus\nHeytesbury’s analysis, according to which insolubles do signify\notherwise than they normally do, cannot be applied to propositions\nformed in mental language. Although Heytesbury himself did not draw\nthis conclusion, it follows from his theory that insolubles cannot be\nformulated in mental language. \nIn the absence of any text by Gregory on the topic, we cannot be sure\nthat he reasoned like this from Heytesbury’s position. But for\nwhatever reason, he apparently did confine insolubles to spoken and\nwritten language; for Gregory there are no insolubles in mental\nlanguage. An insoluble proposition in spoken or written language\ncorresponds to and expresses not the mental proposition one\nwould normally expect on the basis of the usual linguistic\nconventions, but a complex and non-paradoxical mental\nproposition. \nFor example, where a is the spoken or written proposition\n‘a is false’, a corresponds to and expresses\nthe conjunction of two mental propositions. The first\nconjunct signifies that a is false. Note that this is not the\ninsoluble a, since that was in spoken or written language\nwhereas this proposition is mental. Unlike a, this proposition\nis not self-referential; it refers instead to a. \nThe second conjunct signifies that the first conjunct is\nfalse. Since the first conjunct signifies that a is false, this\nmeans that the second conjunct amounts to saying that a is\nnot false, but rather true. \nOne way, therefore, of viewing Gregory’s theory is to say that\nhe adopted the hybrid view described at the end of\n Section 3.3\n above, the view that combines Heytesbury with Bradwardine, but then\nmoved that whole analysis into mental language. Just as for\nHeytesbury’s theory, insolubles for Gregory do not signify just\nas their words normally do—they do not express the mental\nproposition one would expect from the normal linguistic conventions).\nJust as for Bradwardine’s theory, insolubles for Gregory do\nsignify partly that way (through the first conjunct of the mental\nproposition). But they do not signify precisely that way;\nthey also signify that they are true (through the second conjunct of\nthe mental proposition). \nGiven our present knowledge of Gregory’s views, this\nreconstruction must remain speculative. \nJohn Buridan was another logician of the 14th century also\nholding a theory of the insolubles similar to Bradwardine’s.\nHowever, there may have been no direct influence. Buridan taught at\nthe University of Paris, and rather unusually remained a teaching\nmaster in the Arts Faculty for his entire career, from the 1320s until\nat least 1358. We can trace the development of his approach to the\ninsolubles from his early Treatise on Consequences, dating\nfrom the 1330s, through his commentaries on Aristotle’s\nPosterior Analytics, Sophistical Refutations, and\nMetaphysics, to the various treatises of the Summulae de\nDialectica, which was repeatedly revised over twenty years. His\nfinal view is described in the ninth and last treatise of the\nSummulae, with the independent title Sophismata, in\na version from the mid-1350s (see Pironet 1993). \nBuridan’s early view was that every proposition, not just\ninsolubles, signifies its own truth. This idea can be found as early\nas Bonaventure’s Quaestiones disputatae de mysteria\nTrinitate (q1 a1), composed in the 1250s. Unlike Bradwardine,\nBuridan gives only the briefest of arguments for this claim about\nsignification, not grounding it in any principle like\nBradwardine’s (P2). Thus insolubles, which signify their own\nfalsity, signify that they are both true and false, and so are false.\nBuridan’s view on insolubles may have developed out of Girard of\nOdo’s, whose Logica was composed in Paris in the early\n1300s. Girard’s idea was that the Liar paradox, ‘I say\nsomething false’, has four things wrong with it\n(malitiae), the fourth being that, since it is affirmative,\nit asserts the unity of its subject with its predicate, but its\npredicate (‘something false’) denies this (see Giraldus\nOdonis Logica, 396–8). \nHowever, even in the Treatise on Consequences, Buridan thinks\nthis final step, concluding that insolubles are false because they\nsignify that they are both true and false, needs qualification. For he\nrejects the idea that a proposition is true if things are how it\nsignifies, even however it signifies. Things can be, e.g., how\n‘No proposition is negative’ signifies, but it cannot be\ntrue (since it is itself negative, and thus falsifies itself when\nformed). Rather, affirmative propositions are true if their terms\nsupposit for the same, negative if they supposit for different things.\nIndeed, he later rejects the suggestion that propositions signify\ntheir own truth. He did so both for ontological reasons, since that\nwould require some kind of propositional meanings (the famous\ncomplexe significabilia—see, e.g., Klima 2009:\n§10.2); and also because that would make every proposition\nmeta-linguistic. Rather, his later theory claims that every\nproposition virtually implies another proposition asserting the truth\nof the first. Then an insoluble like ‘Socrates utters a\nfalsehood’, uttered by Socrates, is false not because its terms\ndon’t supposit for the same, but because the terms in the\nimplied proposition can’t also do so. Buridan’s solution\nhas been much discussed in recent decades and has been edited and\ntranslated several times (see Buridan [B-S], [B-S2], [B-B], [B-SD],\n[B-SD2]), but it is deeply problematic (see, e.g., Read 2002: §5;\nRead 2006: §6). \nMuch closer to Bradwardine’s theory than to Buridan’s is\nthat of another Paris logician, Albert of Saxony, who arrived in Paris\nsometime before 1351 and taught there until around 1362. His view of\nthe insolubles is similar to Buridan’s early view, arguing in a\nsimilar way that every proposition signifies its own truth. But there\nis reason to doubt whether Albert was a student or even follower of\nBuridan, for Buridan belonged to the Picardian Nation at the\nUniversity, whereas Albert was in the English (or by then\n“Anglo-German”) Nation, and in general his outlook follows\nthe English logical tradition from earlier in the century. What is\nperhaps most impressive, and enjoyable, about Albert’s treatise\non Insolubles (Albert of Saxony, [AS-I]), the first part of\nthe sixth treatise of his Perutilis Logica (A Really\nUseful Logic), is the extensive list of insolubles treated, and\ntheir variety. For example, we find there a paradox much discussed in\nthe recent literature on paradoxes under the title\n‘V-Curry’, closely related to\n Curry’s paradox.\n In fact, in its contemporary form it appears in Dumbleton’s\ndiscussion of the insolubles (see above,\n Section 2.5)\n and in Heytesbury’s Sophismata Asinina ([H-SA}:\nsophism 18, p. 413): consider the consequence with sole premise\n‘This consequence is valid’ and conclusion ‘A man is\nan ass’. Albert contraposes it, inferring ‘This\nconsequence is invalid’ from the premise ‘God\nexists’. The text translated in “Insolubles”\n([AS-I]: XIV, p. 368) reads (slightly amended):  \nLet this consequence be A, its antecedent [‘God\nexists’] B, and its consequent [‘This consequence\nis invalid’] C, and let ‘this’ indicate the\nconsequence itself. Then I put forward consequence A, and I ask\nwhether consequence A is valid or not. \n[i] If one says that it is valid, then, since its antecedent is true,\nit follows that its consequent is true. And if its consequent is true,\nthen things are as its consequent signifies. But the consequent\nsignifies that consequence A is not valid. Therefore,\nconsequence A is not valid. \n[ii] But if one says that consequence A is not valid—on\nthe contrary: If consequence A is not valid, it is possible\nthat B be true while C is false. But that is false,\nwhich I prove as follows. For if A is not valid, things are as\nC signifies them to be, because C signifies that\nA is not valid; and consequently, C is true. Therefore\nB cannot be true unless C is true. Therefore, if\nA is not valid, A is valid. The first consequence is\nevident, for in order that A be not valid it is enough that\nB can be [true] without C, if they are formulated. The\nlast consequence holds “from the first to the last”. \nThe translation follows the Venice 1522 edition. As given in [AS-L]\n(p. 1158), following the manuscripts, the text given in [ii]\nreads: \n[ii′] But if one says that consequence A is not\nvalid—on the contrary: If consequence A is not valid, it\nis possible that B be true while C is false. But that is\nfalse, which I prove as follows. For if A is not valid, then\nC is true, and so A is valid, since B is not true\nunless C is true. So if A is not valid, A is\nvalid. The premise [‘If A is not valid then C is\ntrue’] is clear, for if A is not valid, things are as\nC signifies, because C signifies that A is not\nvalid; and, consequently, C is true. The first consequence is\nevident, for in order that A be valid it is enough that\nB cannot be true without C, if it is formulated. The\nlast consequence holds “from the first to the last”. \nIn a nutshell, Albert’s argument in [ii′] is that if\nA is invalid, it must be possible for B to be true and\nC false. But if A is invalid, C is true. So it is\nimpossible for B to be true and C false. So even if\nA is invalid, it is valid, and so A is valid. But by\n[i], if A is valid it is invalid. So it is\nboth—paradox. \nDumbleton’s response to the paradox is to deny that the premise\n(of his version, ‘This consequence is valid’) constitutes\na proposition, given the regressive reference of its subject\n(‘this consequence’—which\nconsequence?—‘this consequence’, …; cf. Ryle\n1951). Albert’s response, however, in line with his general\napproach to the insolubles, is to agree that his inverted consequence\nis indeed invalid, but to deny that it follows that C\n(‘This consequence is invalid’) is true, for C\nsignifies more than just that A is invalid. Thus the premise\n(‘God exists’) can be true without the conclusion being\ntrue, and so the consequence really is invalid.  \nThe period of greatest innovation and sophistication in the medieval\ninsolubilia-literature seems to have been the second quarter\nof the fourteenth century. After about 1350, less original work is\nknown. Insolubles continued to be discussed, but it seems that for the\nmost part the theories adopted were variations or elaborations of the\nones already seen. Paul of Venice (1499), writing in about\n1396–7, in the final section of his Logica Magna, lists\nfifteen theories, supplementing Bradwardine’s list of nine with\nlater developments, but most from before 1350 (see Spade 1973:\n82–4). This period is not yet well researched, however, so it is\ntoo early for a clear verdict. \nOne of the main (and perhaps genuinely new) theories to emerge from\nthis late period is that of John Wyclif, who wrote a Summa of\nInsolubles (Summa insolubilium),\n [31]\n probably in the early 1360s, and included another discussion of\ninsolubles in his Continuation of the Logic (Logicae\ncontinuatio), III.8. The theory is essentially the same in the\ntwo treatments. \nFor Wyclif, the key to resolving insolubles is to recognize various\nsenses in which propositions can be true or false. There are three\nmain senses of ‘true’, and accordingly of\n‘false’: \nThe “independence” required by the third kind of truth is\nan obscure and difficult matter, not yet well understood. But here is\nhow it applies to insolubles: \nWhere a = ‘a is false’, its primary\nsignificate either exists or does not. If it does, then in any event\nit is not independent of a in the sense required by the third\nkind of truth. In either case, then, a will be false\nin the third sense. If the word ‘false’ in a is\ntaken in the second sense, therefore, a’s primary\nsignificate does exist, since it is a fact that a is false in\nthe third sense. In short, the insoluble is true in the second sense,\nbut false in the third sense. \nOur present understanding of Wyclif’s theory does not go much\nbeyond this. Many questions and problems remain. For instance, if the\nword ‘false’ in a is not taken in the third sense\nbut in the second, the paradox seems to emerge all over again\nin a form that cannot be handled by this theory. \nWhatever its virtues or defects, Wyclif’s theory had some\ninfluence on later authors. Robert Alyngton’s own\nInsolubilia, for instance, from around 1380, explicitly\nappeals to Wyclif’s theory. Its influence can also be seen in\nPeter of Mantua’s account (see\n Section 4.3\n below) and in an anonymous late treatise preserved in a Prague\nmanuscript (see Wyclif [W-SI]: xxiv–xxv.) \nAs already mentioned\n (Section 3.4\n above), in 1372 the Frenchman Peter of Ailly (Petrus de Alliaco)\nwrote an Insolubilia that preserves all we know of Gregory of\nRimini’s theory. Peter’s theory looks much like\nGregory’s. Nevertheless, he did not accept Gregory’s view\nentirely. Whereas for Gregory, an insoluble in spoken or written\nlanguage corresponds to or expresses a conjunction of two\npropositions in mental language, for Peter it corresponds to or\nexpresses two distinct mental propositions, not their\nconjunction. (The two distinct mental propositions are the same two\nthat Gregory had conjoined.) \nIn medieval semantics, propositions that correspond to two distinct\nmental propositions are ambiguous or equivocal. (Indeed, that is the\nmedieval account of equivocation.) Thus, for Peter,\ninsolubles in spoken or written language are strictly equivocal and do\nnot have a single signification. In one sense (answering to the first\nof Gregory’s conjuncts), they are true; in another sense\n(answering to Gregory’s second conjunct), they are false. By\ncontrast, for Gregory, insolubles are just false, not ambiguous at\nall; they correspond to a single false conjunction, one\nconjunct of which is true and the other false. \nPeter’s theory has the phenomenological advantage that it\naccounts for the psychological “flip-flop” sense we have\nwhen thinking about insolubles. When we look at them one way they seem\ntrue; when we look at them another way, they seem false. No other\nmedieval theory seems to account for this psychological fact. For\nfurther discussion, see Dutilh Novaes 2008a: §3.8. \nStrobino 2012 contains the first significant discussion of Peter of\nMantua’s account of insolubles in modern times. Mantua’s\ntreatise, composed in the early 1390s, shows influences from Albert of\nSaxony and William Heytesbury (whose opinions he criticises\nextensively) and of Wyclif’s theory. Mantua’s theory is\nalso mentioned in Paul of Venice’s Logica Magna, in\naddition to the fifteen theories Paul specifically enumerates. Once\nagain, the theory frames itself in Aristotelian terms, whereby the\ninsolubles are absolutely or unqualifiedly false, but true in a\ncertain respect. Like Wyclif’s, his main notion of truth\n(Wyclif’s third, Mantua’s second) requires that\npropositions not be self-referential. If they are self-referential,\nthey are false in this sense. But Mantua’s other notion (similar\nto but narrower than Wyclif’s second) applies only to\nself-referential propositions that are true according to their primary\nsignification. For example, ‘This proposition is not true’\nis false in the first sense (since it is self-referential), but true\nin the second sense, because it is self-referential and not true (in\nthe first sense). Strobino argues that Mantua’s theory, like\nWyclif’s, cannot deal with the problem of revenge, e.g., with\nsuch a proposition as ‘This proposition is not true in either\nsense’.  \nSeveral instructive observations can be made about the medieval\ninsolubilia-literature. \nFirst, although this article has focused on Liar-type paradoxes, and\nalthough the medieval literature did too, it also included other kinds\nof puzzles. For example, (the ‘no’-‘no’\nparadox), where a = ‘b is false’ and\nb = ‘a is false’, no Liar-type paradox\narises; contradiction can be avoided by simply taking one of the two\npropositions as true and the other as false. But medieval logicians\nregarded such cases as problematic because they require us to assign\ndifferent truth values to propositions that are semantically exactly\nalike; there is no reason to pick a as the true proposition\nrather than b or conversely (see Read 2006). Cases like this,\nwhich violate only a kind of semantic “principle of sufficient\nreason”, were often included under the heading\n“insolubles” (for example, Buridan, Sophismata\nVIII.8). A variety of epistemic and pragmatic puzzles were often\nincluded as\n well.[32]\n There is often no attempt, as is usual in present-day literature on\nthe paradoxes, to ignore all the inessentials and focus in on a single\nparadigmatic case that gets at the kernel of the issue. For medieval\nauthors, the issue was a broad one. Most did not attempt to give any\nprecise and rigorous characterization of what it takes to be an\ninsoluble. Often, the definitions they did give are quite general and\ninclude much more than Liar-type paradoxes. In contrast,\nBradwardine’s definition is precise: an insoluble is “a\ndifficult paralogism secundum quid et simpliciter arising\nfrom some [speech-] act’s reflection on itself with a privative\ndetermination” (Bradwardine [B-I]: §2.1). \nSecondly, medieval authors did not have any sense of theoretical\n“crisis” over insolubles, as modern discussions of the\nparadoxes often do. The medievals did not regard the paradoxes as\nthreatening the very foundations of reasoning. On the contrary, most\nauthors seem to have regarded them as merely argumentative nuisances,\nand their main concern was to come up with a way of dealing with them\nwhen they arose in disputation. No doubt this difference from the\nreaction to the logical paradoxes in modern logic is due to the\ndifferent contexts in which the discussions emerged. Modern logic is a\nformalized, systematic discipline, closely tied to the foundations of\nmathematics; medieval logic, by contrast, was much looser and informal\n(which of course is not to say it lacked insight), much more tied to\nthe give and take of live academic disputation. \nThirdly, and related to the second point, most medieval authors\nthought it was entirely feasible to find a completely satisfactory\n“solution” to insolubles. Insolubles were regarded as\nresting on a straightforward but pernicious fallacy, although authors\ndisagreed over just what the fallacy is. William of Ockham, for\ninstance, writes,  \nAs for insolubles, you should know it is not because they can in no\nway be solved that some sophisms are called insolubles, but because\nthey are solved with difficulty. (Ockham [O-SL]: III-3,\n46) \nThe only medieval author who is known to have departed from this\nconfident view is William Heytesbury, who raises objections against\nhis own view, and then remarks (Heytesbury [H-OI]: 45, emphasis\nadded): \nMany objections of this sort can be raised against this view, which it\nwould be difficult or impossible to answer to complete\nsatisfaction. \nAgain, about his own view he says (p. 21, emphasis added): \nI do not claim that it or any [opinion] is altogether satisfactory,\nbecause I do not see that this is possible. Nevertheless I\nrate this one among all of them to be nearer the truth. \nRichard Lavenham, an English contemporary of Wyclif, perhaps put the\nprevailing optimism best (Spade 1975: 93; Heytesbury [H-OI]: 8): \nJust as the bond of love is sometimes called insoluble, not because it\ncan in no way be untied (sit solubilis) but because it can be\nuntied [only] with difficulty, so a proposition is sometimes called\ninsoluble, not because it is not solvable but because it is solvable\n[only] with difficulty.","contact.mail":"slr@st-and.ac.uk","contact.domain":"st-and.ac.uk"}]
