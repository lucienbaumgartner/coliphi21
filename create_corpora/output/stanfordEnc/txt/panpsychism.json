The view has a long and venerable history in\nphilosophical traditions of both East and West, and has recently\nenjoyed a revival in analytic philosophy. For its proponents\npanpsychism offers an attractive middle way between physicalism on the\none hand and dualism on the other. The worry with dualism—the\nview that mind and matter are fundamentally different kinds of\nthing—is that it leaves us with a radically disunified picture\nof nature, and the deep difficulty of understanding how mind and brain\ninteract. And whilst physicalism offers a simple and unified vision of\nthe world, this is arguably at the cost of being unable to give a\nsatisfactory account of the emergence of human and animal\nconsciousness. Panpsychism, strange as it may sound on first hearing,\npromises a satisfying account of the human mind within a unified\nconception of nature.\n\n\n\n\nClear indications of panpsychist doctrines are evident in early Greek\nthought. One of the first Presocratic philosophers of ancient Greece,\nThales (c. 624–545 BCE) deployed an analogical argument for the\nattribution of mind that tends towards panpsychism. The argument\ndepends upon the idea that enminded beings are self-movers. Thales\nnotes that magnets and, under certain circumstances, amber, can move\nthemselves and concludes that they therefore possess minds. It is\nclaimed that Thales went much beyond such particular attributions and\nendorsed a true panpsychism and pantheism. For example, as reported by\nBarnes (1982: 96–7), Diogenes claimed that Thales believed that\n“the universe is alive and full of spirits”, but this\nremark is derived from an earlier claim of Aristotle: “some say\na soul is mingled in the whole universe—which is perhaps why\nThales thought that everything is full of gods”. While Barnes\ndisputes the pantheistic reading of Thales, he allows that Thales\nbelieved in the “ubiquity of\n animation”.[1] \nThe Presocratics were struck by a dilemma: either mind is an elemental\nfeature of the world, or mind can somehow be reduced to more\nfundamental elements. If one opts for reductionism, it is incumbent\nupon one to explain how the reduction happens. On the other hand, if\none opts for the panpsychist view that mind is an elemental feature of\nthe world, then one must account for the apparent lack of\nmental features at the fundamental level. Anaxagoras (c. 500–425\nBCE) flatly denied that novel elements can emerge from more basic\nfeatures of reality and instead advanced the view that\n“everything is in everything” (there are interesting\nparallels between this and much more recent arguments for panpsychism\nby Thomas Nagel and Galen Strawson, discussed below). Anaxagoras\nexplained the appearance to the contrary in terms of a\n“principle of dominance and latency” (see Mourelatos\n1986), which asserted\nthat some qualities were dominant in their contribution to the\nbehavior and appearance of things. However, Anaxagoras’s views\non mind are complex since he apparently regarded mind as uniquely\nnot containing any measure of other things and thus not fully\ncomplying with his mixing principles. Perhaps this can be interpreted\nas the assertion that mind is ontologically fundamental in a special\nway; Anaxagoras did seem to believe that everything has some portion\nof mind in it while refraining from the assertion that everything has\na mind (even this is controversial, see Barnes 1982: 405 ff.). \nOn the other hand, Empedocles, an almost exact contemporary of\nAnaxagoras, favored a reductionist account based upon the famous\ndoctrine of the four elements: earth, air, fire and water. All\nqualities were to be explicated in terms of ratios of these elements.\nThe overall distribution of the elements, which were themselves\neternal and unchangeable, was controlled by “love and\nstrife” in a grand cyclically dynamic\n universe.[2]\n The purest form of reductionism was propounded by the famed atomist\nDemocritus (c. 460–370 BCE). His principle of emergence was\nbased upon the possibility of multi-shaped atoms\n“interlocking” to form an infinity of more complex shapes.\nBut Democritus had to admit that the qualities of experience\ncould not be accounted for in this way, and thus chose to relegate\nthem to non-existence: “by convention sweet and by convention\nbitter, by convention hot, by convention cold, by convention color;\nbut in reality atoms and void” (Taylor 1999). \nWhat is striking about these early attempts to formulate an integrated\ntheory of reality is that the mind and particularly consciousness keep\narising as special problems. It is sometimes said that the mind-body\nproblem is not an ancient philosophical worry (see Matson 1966), but\nit does seem that the problem of consciousness was vexing philosophers\n2500 years ago, and in a form redolent of contemporary worries. \nWe find these worries re-emerging at the start of the scientific\nrevolution, as the mechanistic picture of the world inaugurated by\nGalileo, Descartes and Newton put the problem of the mind at center\nstage while paradoxically sweeping it under the rug. Galileo’s\nmathematisation of nature seemed to leave no space for the qualities\nwe find in experience: the redness of the tomato, the spiciness of the\npaprika, the sweet smell of flowers. Galileo’s solution, in a\nmove reminiscent of Democritus, was to strip matter of such sensory\nqualities. This led to the distinction between “primary\nqualities”—such as shape, size and motion—which were\nthought to really exist in matter, and “secondary\nqualities”—such as colours, odours and tastes—which\nwere thought to exist only in the mind of the observer (or to exist as\npowers to cause ideas in the minds of\n observers).[3]\n Galileo and Descartes did not take the radical Democritian step of\ndenying the existence of the secondary qualities; instead they placed\nthem in the\n soul.[4]\n However, this of course led to a radical form of dualism, with a\nsharp metaphysical division between souls with their secondary\nqualities and bodies with their primary qualities.  \nIn opposition to this dualism, the panpsychist views of Spinoza\n(1632–77) and Leibniz (1646–1716) can be seen as attempts\nto provide a more unified picture of nature. Spinoza regarded both\nmind and matter as simply aspects (or attributes) of the eternal,\ninfinite and unique substance he identified with God Himself.\nIn the illustrative scholium to proposition seven of book two of the\nEthics ([1677] 1985) Spinoza writes:  \na circle existing in nature and the idea of the existing circle, which\nis also in God, are one and the same thing … therefore, whether\nwe conceive nature under the attribute of Extension, or under the\nattribute of Thought … we shall find one and the same order, or\none and the same connection of causes….  \nWe might say that, for Spinoza, physical science is a way of studying\nthe psychology of God. There is nothing in nature that does not have a\nmental aspect—the proper appreciation of matter itself reveals\nit to be the other side of a mentalistic coin. \nLeibniz’s view is sometimes caricatured as: Spinoza with\ninfinitely many substances rather than just one. These substances\nLeibniz called monads (Leibniz [1714] 1989). Since they are\ntrue substances (able to exist independently of any other thing), and\nsince they are absolutely simple, they cannot interact with\neach other in any way. Yet each monad carries within it complete\ninformation about the entire universe. Space, for Leibniz, was\nreducible to (non-spatial) similarity or correspondence relationships\nbetween the intrinsic natures of the monads. \nLeibniz’s monads are fundamentally to be conceived\nmentalistically—they are in a way mentalistic automatons moving\nfrom one perceptual state (some conscious and some not) to another,\nall according to a God imposed pre-defined rule. It is highly\nsignificant for the development of contemporary forms of panpsychism\nthat Leibniz could find no intrinsic nature for his basic elements\nother than a mentalistic nature—the only model he found adequate\nto describe his monads was one of perception and spontaneous activity.\nThis view has been highly influential on the emergence in recent times\nof Russellian monism, discussed below. \nThe nineteenth century was the heyday of panpsychism. Even a partial\nlist of panpsychists of that period reveals how many of the best minds\nof the time gravitated towards this doctrine. Prominent exponents of\ndistinctive forms of panpsychism include Gustav Fechner\n(1801–1887), Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920), Rudolf Hermann\nLotze (1817–1881), William James (1842–1910), Josiah Royce\n(1855–1916) and William Clifford (1845–1879). Royce and\nLotze represent what may be called “idealist panpsychism”.\nThat is, the primary motivation for the ascription of mental\nattributes to matter is that matter is, in essence, a\n“form” of mind, and thus panpsychism is a kind of theorem\nthat follows from this more fundamental philosophical view. \nAn important figure in the development of panpsychist thought is\nArthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860). Schopenhauer was influenced by\nKant’s view that we lack an understanding of reality as it is in\nand of itself, but he made a crucial exception for the immediate\nknowledge one has of oneself. Taking will to be the\nfundamental quality one is aware of in introspection, Schopenhauer\nthus theorised that will is the inner nature of all things. This line\nof reasoning bears a striking similarity to, and indeed is an\nimportant influence on, the contemporary Russellian monists, whom we\nwill discuss below. \nOther panpsychists of this time include Friedrich Paulsen\n(1846–1908), a student of Fechner’s who extended his\nteacher’s version of panpsychism, and Morton Prince\n(1854–1929), psychologist and physician who advocated a\npanpsychism that emphasized that it is matter that must be\n“psychologized” or imbued with mentalistic attributes\n(Prince regarded this as a form of materialism, and there are again\naffinities here with Russellian monism, discussed below). Also to be\nmentioned are Eduard von Hartmann (1842–1906) who extended his\nfamous doctrine of the unconscious down to the level of atoms,\nFerdinand C.S. Schiller (1864–1937) who provided a pragmatist\ndefense of panpsychism as a doctrine which by various analogical\narguments yields otherwise unattainable insights into nature, and\nErnst Häckel (1834–1919), an early and avid proponent of\nDarwinism in Germany who interpreted our evolutionary connection with\nthe rest of nature as evidence for panpsychism, and who was thus\nwilling to ascribe mental properties to living cells. \nFechner and Royce developed panpsychist accounts of nature that did\nnot attribute mental properties to the smallest bits of matter. This\nmight seem to exclude their being correctly classed as\n“panpsychists”, as it is part of the definition of\npanpsychism that mentality is fundamental. Surely someone who believes\nthat amoebas have experiences, but that the quarks and electrons that\nultimately constitute amoebas do not, is no panpsychist. However, this\nsimplifying view contains an implicit assumption about the nature of\nfundamental reality, namely that micro-level entities are its building\nblocks. Fechner and Royce did not accept this assumption, holding\ninstead that the ontological foundation of reality is the\n“world-soul” or “world-mind” of which\neverything is a part (there are obvious echoes of Spinoza in such a\nview). This top-down view of the place of mind in the world does seem\nto be a legitimate sort of panpsychism, and it is one that does not\nrequire that everything in the world be itself enminded. Hartshorne\n(1950) labelled this kind of panpsychism “synecological”,\nin opposition to “atomistic” panpsychism. In contemporary\nphilosophy, these views are known respectively as\n“(constitutive) cosmopsychism” and “(constitutive) micropsychism”, and both\nhave their defenders as we shall see below. \nWilliam James’s panpsychism grew out of his “neutral\nmonism”— the view that the fundamental nature of reality\nis neither mental nor physical, but of some third form that\ncan be regarded as either mental or physical from different\nviewpoints. To the extent that a neutral monism can be regarded as a\ndual-aspect view (as in Spinoza’s philosophy), it might be\nregarded as a kind of panpsychism in its own right; but James’s\nview developed beyond this, to incorporate mind-like elements into the\nbasic structure of reality. In a notebook of 1909 he wrote: “the\nconstitution of reality which I am making for is of the psychic\ntype” (see Cooper 1990). James’s commitment to panpsychism\nremains somewhat controversial, since he also advanced a cogent set of\nobjections against a version of the view, which he labelled the\n“mind dust” theory, in chapter six of The Principles\nof Psychology ([1890] 1981). These objections are the inspiration\nfor the so-called “combination problem”, around which much\nof the twenty first century literature on panpsychism focuses. But in\nthe end James’s commitment is quite clear (see James 1909, 1911;\nLamberth 1997; and for an excellent analysis of James’s views on\nmind see Cooper 1990 or chapters 2–4 of Cooper 2002). \nThe most significant development and defense of a panpsychist\nphilosophy in the twentieth century was undoubtedly that of Alfred\nNorth Whitehead\n (1861–1947).[5]\n Exploration of the details of Whitehead’s philosophy would\nrequire an article of its own, and would be fraught with interpretive\ndifficulties in any case since Whitehead’s own presentation is\nforbiddingly complex. But roughly speaking Whitehead proposed a\nradical reform of our conception of the fundamental nature of the\nworld, placing events (or items that are more event-like than\nthing-like) and the ongoing processes of their creation and\nextinction as the core feature of the world, rather than the\ntraditional triad of matter, space and time. His panpsychism arises\nfrom the idea that the elementary events that make up the world (which\nhe called occasions) partake of mentality in some—often\nextremely attenuated—sense, metaphorically expressed in terms of\nthe mentalistic notions of creativity, spontaneity and perception. The\nechoes of Leibniz are not accidental here, and Whitehead also has a\nform of Leibniz’s distinction between unities and mere\naggregates, which he explains in these terms:  \n… in bodies that are obviously living, a coordination has been\nachieved that raises into prominence some functions inherent in the\nultimate occasions. For lifeless matter these functionings thwart each\nother, and average out so as to produce a negligible total effect. In\nthe case of living bodies the coordination intervenes, and the average\neffect of these intimate functionings has to be taken into account.\n(1933: 207)  \n(Lest it seem that Whitehead is only discussing life, he is\nclear that this depends upon a sort of mental\n functioning.)[6] \nFrom the 1930s to the end of the twentieth century, there was\nrelatively little interest in panpsychism in Western philosophy. This\nattitude was arguably caused by two things: the dominance of\nphysicalism in the philosophy of mind, and the general hostility to\nmetaphysics which reigned up until the 1970s. A rare exception to this\ntrend was Timothy Sprigge who, in A Vindication of Absolute\nIdealism (1983), defends an idealism-based form of panpsychism.\nSprigge summarized his views and provided some novel defences of them\nin Sprigge (2007), which is a response to critics, a number of which\nexplicitly discuss panpsychism (see e.g., Maddell 2007). An important\nform of the anti-emergence argument for panpsychism (discussed below)\nwas published by Thomas Nagel in 1979. Later David Griffin, in\nUnsnarling the World Knot (1998), espoused an atomistic\npanpsychism in the form of an explicit interpretation, extension and\ndefense of Whitehead’s version of the doctrine. We also find\nsympathy for panpsychism in David Chalmers’ (1996) The\nConscious Mind, and in articles responding to Chalmers by Piet\nHut & Roger Shepard, Gregg Rosenberg, and William Seager, all in\nShear 1997 (for more on the history of panpsychism see Clark 2004 and\nSkrbina 2005). \nRecent developments have gone some way to reversing the aversion to\npanpsychism that has dominated Western philosophy in recent times.\nFrom the 1970s onwards hostility to metaphysics slowly withdrew, and\nmost philosophers in the analytic tradition now accept the\ninevitability of metaphysics. And towards the end of the twentieth\ncentury and into the twenty-first, the continuing failure of\nphysicalists to come up with a satisfying account of consciousness has\nled many to look for alternatives. As a result of both of these\nthings, a significant and growing minority of analytic philosophers\nhave begun seriously to explore the potential of panpsychism, both to\nprovide a satisfying account of the emergence of human consciousness\nand to give a positive account of the intrinsic nature of matter\n(these motivations should become clearer in the discussion below of\nthe arguments for panpsychism). The following volumes include some of\nthis recent work: Freeman 2006; Skrbina 2009; Blaumauer 2011; Alter\n& Nagasawa 2015; Brüntrup & Jaskolla 2016; Seager\nforthcoming. \nThe word “panpsychism” literally means that everything has\na mind. However, in contemporary debates it is generally understood as\nthe view that mentality is fundamental and ubiquitous in the natural\nworld. Thus, in conjunction with the widely held assumption (which\nwill be reconsidered below) that fundamental things exist only at the\nmicro-level, panpsychism entails that at least some kinds of\nmicro-level entities have mentality, and that instances of those kinds\nare found in all things throughout the material universe. So whilst\nthe panpsychist holds that mentality is distributed throughout the\nnatural world—in the sense that all material objects have\nparts with mental properties—she needn’t hold\nthat literally everything has a mind, e.g., she needn’t hold\nthat a rock has mental properties (just that the rock’s\nfundamental parts do). \nWe can distinguish various forms of panpsychism in terms of\nwhich aspect of mentality is taken to be fundamental and\nubiquitous. Two important characteristics of human minds are\nthought and consciousness. In terms of these\ncharacteristics we can distinguish the following two possible forms of\npanpsychism: \nAccording to the definition of consciousness that is dominant in\ncontemporary analytic philosophy, something is conscious just in case\nthere is something that it’s like to be it; that is to say, if\nit has some kind of experience, no matter how\n basic.[7]\n Humans have incredibly rich and complex experience, horses less so,\nmice less so again. Standardly the panexperientialist holds that this\ndiminishing of the complexity of experience continues down through\nplants, and through to the basic constituents of reality, perhaps\nelectrons and quarks. If the notion of “having experience”\nis flexible enough, then the view that an electron has\nexperience—of some extremely basic kind—would seem to be\ncoherent (of course we must distinguish the question of whether it is\ncoherent from the question of whether it is plausible; the\nlatter will depend on the strength of the arguments discussed\nbelow). \nThought, in contrast, is a much more sophisticated phenomenon, and\nmany doubt that it is correct to ascribe it to non-human animals,\nnever-mind fundamental particles. The traditional view in analytic\nphilosophy is that thoughts are mental states that can be modelled as\npsychological attitudes towards specific propositions:\nbelieving that Budapest is the capital of Hungary,\nhoping that war is over, fearing that there will be\nanother Global Financial Crisis. Panpsychism is often caricatured as\nthe view that electrons have hopes and dreams, or that quarks suffer\nfrom existential angst. However, whilst there have been some defenders\nof pancognitivism in history, it is panexperientialist forms of\npanpsychism that are taken seriously in contemporary analytic\nphilosophy. From now on I will equate panpsychism with\npanexperientialism.  \nPanpsychists believe that there is much more consciousness in the\nuniverse than most Westerners tend to think there is; indeed at least\nsome fundamental entities have consciousness according to panpsychism.\nBut what is the relationship between this “extra”\nconsciousness and the consciousness we ordinarily believe in, the\nconsciousness we pre-theoretically associate with humans and other\nanimals? \nDavid Chalmers (2015) distinguishes between constitutive and\nnon-constitutive forms of panpsychism, a distinction I present here in\na slightly modified form: \nThe most common form of constitutive panpsychism is: \nAccording to constitutive micropsychism, the smallest parts of my\nbrain have very basic forms of consciousness, and the consciousness of\nmy brain as a whole is in some sense made up from the consciousness of\nits parts. This is the form of panpsychism that suffers most acutely\nfrom the combination problem, which we will explore below.\nHowever, if it can be made sense of, constitutive micropsychism\npromises an elegant and parsimonious view of nature, with all the\nrichness of nature accounted for in terms of facts at the micro-level.\n \nTurning to non-constitutive forms of panpsychism, we should note that\nby saying that human and animal consciousness is not\n“fundamental”, we simply mean that it is not grounded\nin (realized by/constituted of) micro-level consciousness; and\nthis does not entail that human/animal consciousness is not caused\nby micro-level consciousness. Indeed, non-constitutive\npanpsychism typically takes the form of some kind of\nemergentism, according to which the conscious minds of humans\nand animals arise as a causal product of interactions between\nmicro-level conscious subjects. \nEmergentist panpsychism in turn takes two forms. Gregg Rosenberg\n(2004) and Godehard Brüntrup (2016) have each defended a form of\nlayered emergentism, according to which human minds\nco-exist with the micro-level conscious subjects that give\nrise to them and sustain them throughout their existence. The\nresulting picture is structurally similar to the “British\nemergentism” of the 19th and early 20th\ncentury: in both pictures new fundamental entities and forces appear\nwhen matter reaches a certain level of\n complexity.[9]\n However, panpsychist emergentists are arguably committed to a less\nradical form of emergence than non-panpsychist emergentists, as the\nemergent entities are of the same kind as the micro-level entities\nfrom which they emerge. \nWilliam Seager (2016) and Hedda Hassel Mørch (2014) have\nindependently defended a non-layered form of panpsychist emergentism,\nwhich we can call “fusionism”. According to fusionism,\nwhen micro-level subjects come together to form a human mind they\ndon’t compose it as bricks compose a house, rather they as it\nwere fuse into it, ceasing to exist in the process. On Seager’s\nview the post-fusion conscious brain entirely lacks parts; it is a\n“big simple”. On Mørch’s view the post-fusion\nconscious brain still has parts, but whereas pre-fusion the brain was\ndependent for its existence on its parts, post-fusion the parts are\ndependent for their existence upon the brain. \nBy taking human and animal consciousness to be fundamental, rather\nthan somehow made up of more basic forms of consciousness,\nemergentists avoid some forms of the combination problem (discussed\nbelow). However, this comes at the cost of having an empirically more\nrisky view. It is natural to think that emergent fundamental features\nof reality would introduce radically new causal powers, and hence it\nought to be possible in principle to observe the difference they make\nin the world when they come into existence. David Papineau (2001) has\nargued that (i) neuroscience and cellular biology show no sign of the\nexistence of distinctive causal powers associated with biological\nconsciousness, and that (ii) this counts strongly against emergentism\nof any kind. \nIt is worth mentioning a position very similar to panpsychism, namely\npanprotopsychism. Whereas panpsychists think that\nconsciousness is fundamental and ubiquitous,\npanprotopsychists think that proto-consciousness is\nfundamental and ubiquitous. The properties that characterise conscious\nexperience are commonly referred to as “phenomenal\nproperties”; and hence the properties involved in\nproto-consciousness are referred to as “protophenomenal\n properties”.[10] \nIn the first instance, we can think of protophenomenal properties as\nproperties that are not themselves forms of consciousness but which in\ncombination give rise to forms of consciousness. However, as Daniel\nStoljar (2010) has pointed out, this definition is too broad, as\nanybody who believes that consciousness is not fundamental holds that\nit is constituted of some other properties, and hence believes in\nproperties which are “protophenomenal” in this sense.\nStandard forms of physicalism will turn out to be forms of\n“panprotopsychism” on such a definition. \nTo get around this problem, a fuller definition of\n“protophenomenal properties” would define them as\nproperties that in certain combinations transparently account\nfor the existence of consciousness, in the sense that one could in\nprinciple move a priori from knowing the relevant facts about\nprotophenomenal properties to knowing the relevant facts about\nphenomenal properties (Chalmers 2015; Goff 2015, 2017). That is to\nsay, if you could magically perceive the protophenomenal properties\nin my brain (assuming panprotopsychism is true), you would in\nprinciple be able to deduce what it’s like to be me. This would\ndistinguish panprotopsychism from the standard contemporary form of\nphysicalism—that advocated by proponents of the so-called\n“phenomenal concept strategy” (Loar 1990; Papineau 1998; Diaz-Leon\n2010)—according to which there is no explanatory entailment from\nthe physical to the mental. We can further stipulate that the\nexplanatory entailment advocated by the panprotopsychist does not hold\n(solely) in virtue of the kind of properties physical science reveals\nto us, thus distinguishing panprotopsychism from more radically\nreductive views such as analytic functionalism. \nThus, protophenomenal properties have a kind of indirect definition,\nin terms of their propensity to ground consciousness. Different forms\nof panprotopsychism are distinguished by what if anything they have to\nsay about the positive nature of protophenomenal properties. Many\npanprotopsychists think we currently have no positive conception of\nthe nature of protophenomenal properties. Indeed, some have argued\nthat we are constitutionally incapable of ever forming one. This view\nwas dubbed “mysterianism” by Owen Flanagan, and is most\nassociated with Colin McGinn (1989; McGinn does not use the label\n“panprotopsychism” to describe his view, but it fits the\ndefinition laid out in this section). \nPerhaps the most promising conception of protophenomenal properties\nis given by the view Herbert Feigl (1960) called\n“panqualityism”, crediting it to a conversation with\nStephen C. Pepper. Versions of the view itself were held by William\nJames (1904), Ernst Mach (1886), Bertrand Russell (1921) and Peter\nUnger (1999). More recently the view has been prominently defended by\nSam Coleman (2012, 2014, 2015, 2016). According to panqualityism the protophenomenal\nproperties are unexperienced qualities. Our conscious\nexperience is filled with experienced qualities, e.g., those\nphenomenal qualities involved in seeing colour or feeling pain.\nPanqualityists believe that such qualities are only contingently\nexperienced, and that in basic matter they exist unexperienced. \nPanqualityists typically give some kind of reductionist account of how\nsuch unexperienced qualities come to be experienced, such as a\nfunctionalist account according to which for a quality to be\nexperienced is for it to play the right causal role in the cognitive\ncapacities of the organism. Thus, panqualityism can be seen as a kind\nof middle way between panpsychism and\n physicalism.[11]\n Whereas the physicalist thinks that we can give an entirely reductive\naccount of consciousness, and the panpsychist thinks that\nconsciousness is fundamental, the panqualityist thinks that that the\nqualitative aspect of consciousness is fundamental, whilst\nholding a reductive view of subjectivity, i.e., the fact that\nthose qualities are experienced. \nTom McClelland (2013) defends a form of panprotopsychism that combines\nelements of mysterianism with the kind of reductive account of\nsubjectivity favoured by the panqualityists. McClelland is a mysterian\nabout the basic features of matter that give rise to the qualitative\nproperties we encounter in our experience, but like Coleman he hopes\nthat we may be able to give a reductive account of how those qualities\ncome to be experienced. \nFor some other defences of protopanpsychism or closely related views,\nsee Stoljar (2001), Holman (2008), Montero (2010) and Pereboom (2011,\n2015).  \nContemporary philosophers tend to assume that fundamental things exist\nat the micro-level. Coleman (2006) calls this “smallism”:\nthe view that facts about big things are grounded in facts about\nlittle things, e.g., the table exists and is the way it is because the\nparticles making it up are related in certain extremely complicated\nways. However, the work of Jonathan Schaffer (2010) has recently\nbrought to prominence an alternative picture of reality. According to\nthe view Schaffer calls “priority monism”, facts about\nlittle things are grounded in facts about big things. The\ntable’s atoms exist and are the way they are because the table\nexists and is the way it is; and all things ultimately exist and are\nthe way they are because of certain facts about the universe as a\nwhole. For the priority monist there is one and only one fundamental\nthing: the universe. \nIf we combine priority monism with constitutive panpsychism we\nget: \nWe can also envisage non-constitutive forms of cosmopsychism. On a\nstandard form of layered emergentism (discussed above), human and\nanimal minds are causally dependent on consciousness-involving\nmicro-level facts whilst being fundamental entities in their own\nright; on the cosmopsychist analogue, human and animal minds are\ncausally dependent on the conscious cosmos whilst being fundamental\nentities in their own\n right.[12]\n The minimal commitment of cosmopsychism is that the universe is\nconscious; in principle this is compatible with holding that the\nuniverse is a derivative entity, grounded in facts about is parts.\n \nCosmopsychism is not to be confused with pantheism: the view that the\nuniverse is\n God.[13]\n Just as the micropsychist holds that electrons have experience but\nnot thought, so the cosmopsychist holds that the universe has some\nkind of experience, but may refrain from attributing thought or agency\nto the universe. It could be that the consciousness of the universe is\na gigantic mess that doesn’t add up to anything coherent enough\nto ground cognition. \nDetailed forms of cosmopsychism have been proposed by Mathews (2011),\nJaskolla & Buck (2012), Shani (2015), Nagasawa & Wager (2016),\nand Goff (2017, forthcoming). Most of these philosophers are attracted\nto cosmopsychism on the grounds that it is better fitted than\nmicropsychism to deal with the combination problem (we will discuss\nsome of their reasons for thinking this below in the section on the\ncombination problem). Cosmopsychism is the contemporary analogue of\nthe “synecological” forms of panpsychism, defended by\nFechner and Royce amongst others, which were discussed above.  \nIn his 1927 book The Analysis of Matter, Bertrand Russell\nproposed a novel approach to the mind-body problem. Arthur Eddington,\nin his Gifford lectures of the same year, independently expressed very\nsimilar thoughts (published in Eddington\n 1928).[14]\n Remarkably this approach was almost completely forgotten about for\nmuch of the twentieth century. However, there has recently been a\nrevival of interest in this approach, resulting in a Russell-inspired\nview that has become known as “Russellian monism”. \nRussellian monists are motivated by the need to characterise the\nintrinsic nature of matter (This issue is discussed in great detail\nbelow in the section on the “Intrinsic nature argument”;\nreading that section will help one get a grip on Russellian monism and\nits motivation). We can define the view itself in terms of two\ncomponents, one negative and one positive: \nSome Russellian monists think that the intrinsic nature of fundamental\nmatter is itself consciousness-involving; others that it involves\nnon-phenomenal properties that somehow transparently explain the\nreality of consciousness. Thus, we get panpsychist and\npanprotopsychist forms of the view, which we can call\n“Russellian panpsychism” and “Russellian\npanprotopsychism” respectively. \nThe attraction of Russellian monism is that it has the potential to\navoid both the deep problems facing dualism and the\ndeep problems facing physicalism. The problem with dualism is its\ndifficulty reconciling the causal efficacy of human consciousness with\n(what many philosophers take to be) the empirical fact that the\nphysical world is causally closed, in the sense that every\nevent has a sufficient physical cause. The causal closure of the\nphysical seems to leave no room for fundamental non-physical mental\ncauses to do any work. If my behaviour is entirely caused by physical\nevents in my brain, then my immaterial soul is left with no role to\nplay in the production of behaviour. The physicalist avoids this\nproblem as on her view consciousness states are physical\nstates, and hence they are themselves parts of the causally closed\nphysical system. Or rather physicalists can avoid this problem if they\ncan give an adequate account of the grounding of consciousness. The\nproblem for physicalists, as we will discuss in the next section, is\nthat there are strong philosophical grounds for thinking that they are\nunable to do\n this.[15] \nRussellian monism offers hope of a satisfying solution to both of\nthese difficulties. Its elegant integration of consciousness in the\nmaterial world looks to be a promising way of accounting for the\ncausal role of human consciousness. If conscious states just are the\nintrinsic nature of brain states, then the causal action of brain\nstates and the causal action of conscious states are arguably one and\nthe same thing. And by postulating a phenomenal or protophenomenal\nnature to fundamental physical reality, Russellian monism hopes to\nprovide an adequate account of the grounding of\n consciousness.[16] \nFor these reasons, Russellian monism is increasingly being seen as one\nof the most promising ways forward on the problem of consciousness.\nEven its opponents have expressed admiration for its virtues;\nphysicalist Alyssa Ney (2015: 349) says of it  \nThis proposal strikes me, suspending disbelief about the…theses\nthat lead up to it, as at least as bold and exciting as Newton’s\nproposed identification of terrestrial and cosmic reality. \nThe growing prominence of Russellian monism, given that one\nparadigmatic form of Russellian monism is panpsychist, has resulted in\npanpsychism once again being considered as a serious option. \nSee Alter & Nagasawa (2015) for a recent collection of essays on\nRussellian monism. For further work on Russellian monism and related\nviews see Feigl (1967), Maxwell (1979), Lockwood (1989), Strawson\n(1994, 2003, 2016), Chalmers (1996, 2015), Griffin (1998), Stoljar\n(2001), Pereboom (2011, 2015) and Goff (2015, 2017). \nNeuroscience has made great progress in uncovering the mechanisms in\nthe brain that underlie our cognitive and behavioural functioning. But\nthis form of scientific investigation has not produced anything\napproaching a satisfying explanation of why it is that a person has\nsubjective experience, i.e., of why there is something that\nit’s like to be a human being. It seems that we can imagine a\ncreature that was empirically indiscernible from a human being in\nterms of its physical brain processes and the behaviour they give rise\nto, but which had no experience whatsoever (it screams and runs away\nwhen you stick a knife in it, but it doesn’t actually\nfeel pain). And it arguably follows that facts about physical\nbrain processes and behaviour cannot explain, at least not in a\ntransparent and satisfying manner, the reality of conscious\nexperience. \nThis is the problem David Chalmers (1995, 1996) famously named\n“the hard problem of\n consciousness”.[17]\n Some think the alleged problem involves a confusion, although\nanyone who thinks this is obliged to diagnose the exact root of the\nconfusion. Others think that there is a problem, but one that further\nscientific investigation will solve. Perhaps we just need to wait for\nthe arrival of the “Darwin of consciousness” to make\nprogress. However, there is no reason to suppose that “further\nscientific investigation” has to be pursued under the\nmethodological assumption that consciousness is to be accounted\nfor in terms of processes which don’t involve\nconsciousness, e.g., in terms of facts about non-conscious\nneurons. The panpsychist proposes an alternative approach: explain\nhuman and animal consciousness in terms of more basic forms of\nconsciousness. These more basic forms of consciousness are then\npostulated as properties of the fundamental constituents of the\nmaterial world, perhaps of quarks and electrons. Thus, we try to\nexplain the consciousness of the human brain in terms of the\nconsciousness of its most fundamental parts. \nThomas Nagel (1979) influentially argued that adopting a view like\npanpsychism is the only way to avoid what he called\n“emergence”. Crucially, close examination of the text\nreveals that Nagel is using the word “emergence” slightly\ndifferently to how it has come to be used in contemporary discussions\nof panpsychism (discussed above). For Nagel, “emergent”\nproperties of a complex system are ones that cannot be intelligibly\nderived from the properties of its parts. In contrast, for the\n“emergentist panpsychists” discussed above,\n“emergent” properties of a complex system are simply\nfundamental macro-level properties, which may or may not be\nintelligibly derived from the properties of its\n parts.[18]\n Following Galen Strawson (2006a) we can use the word “radical\nemergence” to express Nagel’s notion of\n emergence.[19] \nNagel’s argument involves four premises: \nNagel takes these premises to imply that there must be non-physical\nproperties of basic matter that, when combined in the right way,\nintelligible imply the existence of mental states. It is worth noting\nthat, although Nagel calls the resulting view\n“panpsychism”, it seems compatible with panprotopsychism\n(discussed above). \nMore recently, Galen Strawson (2006a) has defended a similar argument\nfrom the untenability of radical emergence. Whereas Nagel’s aim\nis merely to establish the disjunction of panpsychism and\npanprotopsychism, the conclusion of Strawson’s argument is very\ndefinitely the truth of panpsychism. Strawson begins by arguing that\nradical emergence is upon reflection unintelligible: \nEmergence can’t be brute. It is built into the heart of\nthe notion of emergence that emergence cannot be brute in the sense of\nthere being absolutely no reason in the nature of things why the\nemerging thing is as it is (so that it is unintelligible even to God).\nFor any feature Y of anything that is correctly considered to\nbe emergent from X, there must be something about X and\nX alone in virtue of which Y emerges, and which is\nsufficient for Y (Strawson 2006a: 18) \nThere are of course cases in which one property arises from another,\ne.g., liquid arises from individual molecules each of which is not\nitself liquid. However, in all such cases, Strawson argues, the\nemergence is perfectly intelligible: \nWe can easily make intuitive sense of the idea that certain sorts of\nmolecules are so constituted that they don’t bind together in a\ntight lattice but slide past or off each other (in accordance with van\nde Waals molecular interaction laws) in a way that gives rise\nto—is—the phenomenon of liquidity. So too, with\nBénard convection cells we can easily make sense of the idea\nthat physical laws relating to surface tension, viscosity, and other\nforces governing the motion of molecules give rise to hexagonal\npatterns on the surface of a fluid like oil when it is heated. In both\nthese cases we move in a small set of conceptually homogeneous\nshape-size-mass-charge-number-position-motion-involving physics\nnotions with no sense of puzzlement…. Using the notion of\nreduction in a familiar loose way, we can say that the phenomena of\nliquidity reduce without remainder to shape-size-mass-charge-etc.\n(Strawson 2006a: 18) \nThus, the crucial feature of intelligible emergence, according to\nStrawson, is that the relationship between the product of emergence\nand its producer can be adequately characterized using a single set of\nconceptually homogeneous concepts. But it’s very hard to see how\nany set of conceptually homogeneous concepts could capture both the\nexperiential (i.e., consciousness-involving) and the non-experiential\n(non-conscious-involving), and hence hard to see how the thesis that\nconsciousness emerges from non-consciousness could be rendered\nintelligible. Strawson argues that it is only by supposing that human\nand animal consciousness emerges from more basic forms of\nconsciousness, that we have hope of avoiding the emergence of animal\nconsciousness being a brute and inexplicable miracle.  \nIt is not clear that Strawson is able to conclusively rule out the\npanprotopsychist option discussed above. It is plausible that we\ncurrently have no positive conception of wholly non-experiential\nstates that would intelligibly give rise to consciousness. But maybe\nthat’s because the Darwin of consciousness hasn’t come\nalong yet to theorise her way to their nature. Or maybe, as Colin\nMcGinn (1989) famously argued, human beings are constitutively\nincapable of grasping the nature of the properties underlying\nconsciousness; it could nonetheless be that the emergence of\nconsciousness from non-consciousness is intelligible to God if not to\nus. We have seen that Strawson insists that an emergent feature and\nthat from which it emerges must be capable of being captured under a\nset of conceptually homogeneous notions; but perhaps there is an\nunknown (at least thus far) neutral vocabulary in terms of which both\nexperiential and non-experiential features of reality can be\nadequately described (Nagel is open to this possibility, which is\nanother way of seeing how the conclusion of Strawson’s argument\nis stronger than that of Nagel’s). Furthermore, as Philip Goff\n(2006, 2017: ch. 7)\nhas argued in response to Strawson, there is reason to doubt that the\npanpsychist herself is able to give a wholly intelligible story as to\nhow macro-level consciousness emerges from the micro-level\nconsciousness, which threatens to undermine Strawson’s claim\nthat panpsychism avoids radical emergence. (This issue is discussed in\ndetail below in the section on The Subject-Summing\nProblem). \nStrawson’s argument is intended to show that a non-panpsychist\nreduction of consciousness is impossible. However, it is not\nobvious that this is essential for the anti-emergence argument for\npanpsychism to have force. Philosophers and scientists have spent a\ngreat deal of time trying to explain consciousness in terms of\nnon-consciousness, and these efforts have not produced even the\nbeginnings of an intelligible explanation. Given this failure it seems\nreasonable to explore other paradigms of scientific explanation. \nIt might seem obvious that emergentist panpsychists (discussed above)\nare unable to make use of the anti-emergence argument for panpsychism.\nHowever, many panpsychists argue that panpsychist forms of emergentism\nare less radical than non-panpsychism forms of emergentism. Hedda\nHassel Mørch (2014), for example, defends a form of panpsychism\ninvolving partially intelligible emergence, which she argues\nis to be preferred over fully brute emergence. \nBrian McLaughlin (2016) responds to Nagel’s argument by\ndeploying a currently popular strategy for defending physicalism: the\nphenomenal concept strategy. See also Freeman 2006 for a volume of\nresponses to Strawson’s anti-emergence argument, followed by\nStrawson’s counter-response. \nThere is a second prominent argument for panpsychism, which has\nnothing to do with the need to explain human consciousness; rather it\nbegins from a certain gap in the picture of the world we get from the\nphysical sciences. This argument has its roots in Leibniz,\nSchopenhauer, Russell (1927) and Whitehead (1933 [1967]), and is\ndefended by many panpsychists, including Sprigge (1999), Strawson\n(2003) and Goff (2017). It is also strongly connected to the\nmotivations for Russellian monism, and so it may be useful to read\nthis section in close conjunction with the section above on Russellian\nmonism. \nIn the public mind physics is on its way to giving us a complete\naccount of the fundamental nature of the material world. It seems\nalmost tautological that “physics” is the true theory of\n“the physical”, and hence that it is to physics we should\nturn for an understanding of the complete nature of space, time and\nmatter. However, this commonplace opinion comes under pressure when we\nreflect on the austere vocabulary in terms of which physical theories\nare framed. A crucial moment in the scientific revolution was\nGalileo’s declaration that the book of the universe is written\nin the language of mathematics; from this point onwards mathematics\nhas been the language of physics. The vocabulary of physics is\narguably not entirely mathematical, as it involves causal or nomic\nnotions, such as the notion of a law of nature. But the kind of\nqualitative concepts we find in the Aristotelian\ncharacterisation of the universe are wholly absent from modern\nphysics. Physical theories are framed in a wholly mathematico-nomic\nvocabulary. \nThe problem is that it’s not clear that such an austere\nvocabulary can even in principle capture the complete nature of\nconcrete reality. A mathematical description of a situation abstracts\nfrom concrete reality; a mathematical model in economics for example\nabstracts away from what is being bought or sold, or the nature of\nlabour. And nomic predicates can only express information about how\nphysical entities are disposed to behave. This is fine if we want to\npredict, say, how electrons will behave. But intuitively there must\nalso be an intrinsic nature to an electron; there must be an\nanswer to the question “How is the electron in and of\nitself?” And this question doesn’t seem to be answered by\ndescribing how electrons are disposed to behave. \nSome philosophers, known as “dispositional essentialists”,\nhold that all fundamental properties are pure dispositions\n(Ellis 2001; Molnar 2003; Mumford 2004; Bird 2007). On this view, once\nwe have fully described how the electron is disposed to behave, e.g.,\nthe disposition to repel other electrons and to attract positrons, or\nthe disposition to exert gravitational attraction on other entities\nwith mass, we have thereby said everything there is to be said about\nthe nature of the electron. Entities on this view are not so much\nbeings as doings. \nHowever, there are powerful arguments against the intelligibility of\ndispositional essentialism. Most discussed is the charge that attempts\nto characterize the nature of properties under the assumption of\ndispositional essentialism lead to vicious regress (Robinson 1982;\nBlackburn 1990; Armstrong 1997; Heil 2003; Lowe 2006; Goff 2017: ch.\n6). For any given disposition X, we understand the nature of\nX only when we know the nature of its manifestation, that is,\nthe property it gives rise to when manifested. For example, the\nmanifestation of flammability is burning; we only know what\nflammability is when we know that burning is its manifestation.\nHowever, assuming dispositional essentialism the manifestation of any\ndisposition X will be another disposition, call it\n“Y”. To know the nature of X we need to know\nthe nature of Y. But we can only know the nature of Y by\nknowing the nature of its manifestation, which will be another\ndisposition, call it “Z”. To know the nature of Z we need\nto know the nature of its manifestation, and so on ad infinitum. The\nbuck is continually passed, and hence an adequate understanding of the\nnature of any property is impossible, even for an omniscient being; in\nother words, a dispositional essentialist world is unintelligible.\nRussell records the moral of the story thus:  \nThere are many possible ways of turning some things hitherto regarded\nas “real” into mere laws concerning the other things.\nObviously there must be a limit to this process, or else all the\nthings in the world will merely be each other’s washing (Russell\n1927: 325) \nIf this argument is sound, then physical theory will never provide us\nwith a complete and adequate account of the nature of the material\nworld. The job of physics is to provide us with mathematical models\nthat accurately predict the behaviour of matter. This is incredibly\nuseful information; rich understanding of the causal structure of\nmatter has enabled us to manipulate the natural world in all sorts of\nextraordinary ways, allowing us to build lasers and hairdryers, and to\nput men on the moon. Indeed we can explain the extraordinary success\nof physics in terms of the fact that from Galileo onwards it focused\non this more limited project of capturing matter’s causal\nstructure, rather than speculating about the underlying nature of the\nstuff that has that structure.  \nHowever, as philosophers we may be interested in finding out what the\nintrinsic nature of matter is, or at least having our best guess as to\nwhat it might be. And if the above line of reasoning is correct, we\nmust look beyond physics for this. The panpsychist has a proposal: the\nintrinsic nature of matter is, at least in part, consciousness.\nSupposing for the sake of discussion that electrons are fundamental\nconstituents of reality, the panpsychist proposal is as follows:\nphysics tells us how an electron behaves, but in and of itself the\nelectron is essentially a thing that instantiates consciousness (of\npresumably some extremely basic kind). \nWhat is to be said in favour of this proposal? The first thing to say\nis that it is not obvious that we have an alternative proposal, at\nleast at present. We learn about matter through its causal impact on\nour senses or on our measuring devices; as Eddington (1928:\n58–60; quoted in Strawson 2006a) put it “Our knowledge of\nthe nature of the objects treated in physics consists solely of\nreadings of pointers [on instrument dials] and other\nindicators”. It’s hard to see how this indirect method of\ninvestigating matter could yield insight into its intrinsic nature.\nDerk Pereboom (2011) has suggested that future thinkers may through\nimagination theorise their way to a positive hypothesis concerning the\nintrinsic nature of matter, and such a proposal may turn out to have\nempirical support, or theoretical support of some other kind. However,\nat least as they are currently conceived of, the physical sciences\nhave no use for speculation concerning matter’s intrinsic\nnature. It is arguable that our choice is between the panpsychist\nproposal and the view that the intrinsic nature of matter is “we\nknow not what”. \nFurthermore, assuming the falsity of dualism, we know that the\nintrinsic nature of at least some matter is\nconsciousness-involving: namely the matter of brains (or whole\norganisms if we think that organisms are the bearers of\nconsciousness). This is perhaps our only real clue as to the intrinsic\nnature of matter in general; as regards the intrinsic nature of stuff\noutside of brains (or of the parts of brains) we can only speculate.\nGoff (2016, 2017: ch. 7) has argued that from this epistemic starting\npoint there is a clear “simplicity argument” in favour of\npanpsychism: in the absence of any reason to suppose otherwise, the\nmost simple, elegant, parsimonious hypothesis is that the matter\noutside of brains is continuous with the matter of brains in also\nhaving a consciousness-involving nature. Eddington (1928:\n259–60; quoted in Strawson 2003) remarked that it was rather\n“silly”, given that we know nothing from physics of the\nintrinsic nature of matter, to suppose that its nature is incongruent\nwith mentality and then to wonder where mentality comes from. These\npanpsychists try to put the onus is on their opponents to come up with\na non-panpsychist proposal as to the intrinsic nature of matter, and\nto give reasons to prefer it to the prima facie much simpler\nand more parsimonious panpsychist proposal. \nWhereas the anti-emergence argument discussed above tries to show that\npanpsychism offers the best account of the synchronic dependence of\nbiological consciousness on more fundamental features of reality,\ngenetic arguments try to show that panpsychism offers the\nbest account of the development of biological consciousness in\nevolutionary\n history.[20]\n Such arguments turn on the assumption that evolution is a continuous\nprocess that molds pre-existing properties into more complex forms,\nbut that cannot produce “entirely novel” properties.\nWilliam Clifford puts the argument thus: \n… we cannot suppose that so enormous a jump from one creature\nto another should have occurred at any point in the process of\nevolution as the introduction of a fact entirely different and\nabsolutely separate from the physical fact. It is impossible for\nanybody to point out the particular place in the line of descent where\nthat event can be supposed to have taken place. The only thing that we\ncan come to, if we accept the doctrine of evolution at all, is that\neven in the very lowest organism, even in the Amoeba which swims about\nin our own blood, there is something or other, inconceivably simple to\nus, which is of the same nature with our own consciousness….\n(Clifford [1874] 1886: 266) \nA similar argument is due to James:  \nwe ought … to try every possible mode of conceiving of\nconsciousness so that it may not appear equivalent to the irruption\ninto the universe of a new nature non-existent to then. ([1890] 1950:\n148)  \nMore recently, Goff (2013) has argued that consciousness is not\nvague, and that this leads to a sorites-style argument for\npanpsychism. Very roughly if consciousness does not admit of\nborderline cases, then we will have to suppose that some utterly\nprecise micro-level change—down to an exact arrangement of\nparticles—marked the first appearance of consciousness (or the\nchange from non-conscious to conscious embryo/foetus), and it is going\nto seem arbitrary that it was that utterly precise change that was\nresponsible for this significant change in nature. \nA final important motivation for panpsychism comes from the need to\naccount for mental causation in a way that is consistent with\nalleged causal closure of the physical: the thesis that every\nphysical event has a sufficient physical cause (Chalmers 2015; Goff\n2017: ch. 6). If, as the dualist believes, consciousness exists\noutside the physical world, it is hard to see how it could impact on a\ncausally closed physical system. But if, as the panpsychist believes,\nconsciousness infuses the intrinsic nature of the material world, then\nconsciousness and its effects are part of the causally closed system.\nAs discussed above, this is an important motivation for the\ncontemporary position Russellian\n monism.[21] \nMany people, both philosophers and non-philosophers, find deeply\ncounterintuitive the idea that fundamental constituents of the\nphysical world, such as electrons, have conscious experience. And many\ntake this to be a good reason not to take panpsychism seriously.\nHowever, panpsychists may respond by denying that a theory’s\nill-fit with our intuitions is a reason for doubting its truth.\nConsider the thesis that we have a common ancestors with apes, or that\ntime flows slower when travelling at high speeds, or that a particle\ncan exist in a superposition between distinct locations; all of these\ntheses are highly counter-intuitive, but this gives us little or no\nreason to think them false.  \nPresumably these scientific theories are taken so seriously in spite\nof their strangeness because they are supported by empirical evidence.\nHowever, most arguments for panpsychism start from a datum which is\nknown with greater certainty than the data of observation and\nexperiments: the existence of human consciousness. Of course the mere\nexistence of human consciousness does not logically entail the truth\nof panpsychism. There are always an infinite number of theories\nconsistent with the data, and we must choose between them on the basis\nof theoretical virtues, such as parsimony and simplicity. But if it\ncould be shown that panpsychism provides the best explanation of the\nexistence of human and animal consciousness, or that it is the most\nparsimonious theory of the intrinsic nature of matter (given that the\nonly clue we have as to the intrinsic nature of matter is that some of\nit involves consciousness), this would give us strong support for the\ntruth of panpsychism in spite of its prima facie strangeness. \nConsider the following analogy (Goff 2016, 2017: ch. 7). Einstein’s\ntheory of special relativity is empirically equivalent to the\nLorentzian theory that preceded it; and if our concern is fit with\ncommonsense then Lorentz’s theory is superior as it preserves\nour commonsense notion of absolute time. However, the scientific\ncommunity almost universally went for Einstein’s view on the\ngrounds of its greater simplicity and elegance. Similarly, we should\nassess panpsychism on the grounds of its theoretical virtue and\nexplanatory power, rather than the fact that most Western people find\nit strange. \nIt is generally agreed, both by its proponents and by its opponents,\nthat the hardest problem facing panpsychism is what has become known\nas the “combination problem”. This term comes from William\nSeager (1995), although in the contemporary literature the problem\nitself is generally traced back to William James ([1890]\n 1981).[22]\n The combination problem is most obviously a challenge for\nconstitutive micropsychism, although as we shall see there are forms\nof it that threaten other kinds of panpsychism. According to\nconstitutive micropsychism, micro-level entities have their own very\nbasic forms of conscious experience, and in brains these micro-level\nconscious entities somehow come together to constitute human and\nanimal consciousness. The problem is that this is very difficult to\nmake sense of: “little” conscious subjects of experience\nwith their micro-experiences coming together to form a\n“big” conscious subject with its own experiences. \nThe inspiration for the problem is the following passage from\nJames: \nTake a hundred of them [feelings], shuffle them and pack them as close\ntogether as you can (whatever that may mean); still each remains the\nsame feeling it always was, shut in its own skin, windowless, ignorant\nof what the other feelings are and mean. There would be a hundred-and\nfirst-feeling there, if, when a group or series of such feelings where\nset up, a consciousness belonging to the group as such should emerge.\nAnd this 101st feeling would be a totally new fact; the 100\nfeelings might, by a curious physical law, be a signal for its\ncreation, when they came together; but they would have no substantial\nidentity with it, not it with them, and one could never deduce the one\nfrom the others, nor (in any intelligible sense) say that they evolved\nit. (James [1890] 1981: 160)b \nIn fact, if one reads on in the text one finds that James’\nargument is that there is no mental combination because there is no\ncombination whatsoever (Shani 2010). James believes that in reality\nthere are only particles arranged in various ways, which give rise to\nthe idea of composite objects by the effects they have on our senses.\nThe denial that there are any composite objects whatsoever is fairly\nradical. However, contemporary philosophers have been inspired by the\nabove passage to think that there is something specifically troubling\nabout the notion of mental combination, a concern that\ndoesn’t obviously arise in the physical case. At least on the\nface of it we have no problem with the idea of bricks forming a house,\nor mechanical parts forming a car engine. But the idea of many minds\nforming some other mind is much harder to get your head around (so to\nspeak). \nThe general consensus among panpsychists is that there is currently no\nwholly adequate solution to the combination problem. However, this is\nnot obviously a reason to think the panpsychist research project is\nnot worth pursuing. Compare: it was only many decades after Darwin and\nWallace formulated the principle of natural selection that modern\ngenetics developed, and indeed there are many deep problems facing the\nDarwinian research project that remain unsolved. It takes time to move\nfrom a broad theoretical framework to a complete theory with all the\ndetails filled in. It is only recently that panpsychism is once again\nbeing taken seriously by contemporary philosophers and some neuroscientists\n(e.g., Tononi & Koch 2015). If it does eventually produce a\nperfectly adequate account of human consciousness and of the nature of\nmatter, this will no doubt only be after many decades or centuries of\nserious inter-disciplinary work. \nThe kind of mental combination which is generally taken to be most\ntroubling is subject-summing: the combination of distinct\nconscious subjects into a single conscious mind. And hence the\nparadigmatic form of the combination problem is the\nsubject-summing problem. \nThe subject-summing problem, and indeed all forms of the combination\nproblem, can be construed in a stronger or a milder form. In its\nmilder form it is taken to be a challenge that the panpsychist must\naddress in the long run, either by eventually coming up with an\nadequate theoretical account of mental combination, or at least by\nexplaining why such an account is beyond our ken. Almost all\npanpsychists accept this challenge, and one major activity of the\ncontemporary panpsychism research project is attempting to solve (or\ncircumnavigate) the subject-summing problem and the combination\nproblem more generally. \nIn its stronger form the subject-summing problem takes the form of an\nargument to the conclusion that subject-summing is incoherent or\nimpossible, and hence that panpsychism—or at least constitutive\nmicropsychism—must be false. Sam Coleman (2014), for example,\nhas argued that subject-summing is incoherent on the grounds that each\nsubject has a viewpoint that excludes the viewpoints of all other\nsubjects. The essence of my current point of view as a conscious\nsubject is a matter not just of the conscious experiences I am\npositively having, but of the fact that I am having those\nexperiences and no others.  The same could be said of the\nessence of the point of view you are currently enjoying. If my point\nof view and your point of view were to be combined into an\n“uber-mind”, then that uber-mind would have to have\nboth your experiences to the exclusion of all other\nexperiences and my experiences to the exclusion of all other\nexperiences. This seems flatly contradictory, assuming that you\nand I have different experiences. If this argument works, it ought to\napply to the much simpler points of view of micro-level subjects, thus\nrendering constitutive micropsychism\nincoherent.[23] \nAnother attempt to demonstrate the impossibility of subject-summing is\nfound in Goff’s (2009, 2017) conceivability argument against\nmental combination. Goff reads into the above James passage a claim\nabout conceivability: \nConceivable Isolation of Subjects (CIS)—For any group\nof subjects, \\(S_{1}\\), \\(S_{2}\\), …, \\(S_{n}\\), and any\nconscious states, \\(E_{1}\\), \\(E_{2}\\), …, \\(E_{n}\\), the\nfollowing scenario is conceivable: there are \\(S_{1}\\), \\(S_{2}\\),\n…, \\(S_{n}\\) instantiating \\(E_{1}\\), \\(E_{2}\\), …,\n\\(E_{n}\\), but it’s not the case that there is a subject \\(S*\\)\nsuch that \\(S*\\) is not identical with any of \\(S_{1}\\), \\(S_{2}\\)\n… \\(S_{n}\\). \nBuilding on this he argues that we can conceive of a\n“micro-experiential zombie”, defined as a creature that\nis: \nIf we can infer from the conceivability to the possibility of such\ncreatures, then the falsity of constitutive micropsychism seems to\nfollow. For the constitutive micropsychist holds that the facts about\nmicro-subjects wholly account for the existence of macro-level\nconscious subjects. But if it is possible for the facts about\nmicro-subjects to obtain in the absence of any macro-level\nconsciousness—which on the face of it seems to be the case in a\nworld of micro-experiential zombies—then it seems that the facts\nabout micro-subjects cannot wholly account for the existence of\nmacro-level consciousness (it’s generally assumed that for fact\nX to ground fact Y, it must be the case that X\nnecessitates Y). In that sense, it’s impossible for\nsubjects to sum. \nThis is a particularly worrying argument for the panpsychist, as she\ngenerally motivates her view in terms of a rejection of physicalism:\nif physicalist accounts of consciousness are implausible then this can\nmotivate turning to panpsychism as an alternative. However, the most\ncommon way of rejecting physicalism is via a conceivability argument\nof the above form, roughly: we can conceive of the physical facts of\nthe body and brain obtaining in the absence of the facts about\nconsciousness, and hence the physical facts cannot wholly account for\nthe facts about consciousness (see Chalmers 2009 and Goff 2017). If\nthe same form of argument also applies to the panpsychist account of\nmacro-level consciousness—the kind of consciousness we surely\nwant explained at the end of the day—then it seems we’ve\ngot nowhere. (Note that this worry does not threaten the intrinsic\nnature argument for panpsychism, discussed\n above).[24] \nFor further details, see the supplementary document\n Possible Solutions to the Subject-Summing Problem. \nIn David Chalmers’ (2016) taxonomy of the combination problem,\nthere are three dimensions of difficulty: \nWe have already covered the subject-summing problem in some detail. I\nturn now to a briefer treatment of problems pertaining to quality and\nstructure. \nHuman consciousness is a rich and wonderful thing. In any given sense\nmodality, we enjoy an incredible variety of qualities. Moreover, prima\nfacie the delightful qualities we enjoy in one sense modality seem to\nbe wildly different from the sensory qualities we enjoy in any other\nsensory modality; what it’s like to smell, for example, seems to\nhave nothing in common with what it’s like to see a colour. For\nthe panpsychist all this richness and variety results from fundamental\nkinds of mental qualities, which panpsychists tend to suppose are\nquite small in number (e.g., for Russellian monists basic conscious\nproperties are the intrinsic nature of the basic properties picked out\nby physics, which are relatively few in number). The palette problem\n(Chalmers 2016), expressed as metaphor, goes as follows: How is it\nthat the richly painted canvas of human experiences is produced from\nsuch a small palette of paints?  \nNumerous speculative solutions have been offered to the palette\nproblem. Patrick Lewtas (forthcoming) avoids the palette problem\naltogether by postulating an enormous number of fundamental\nmicro-experiential properties, one corresponding to every basic\nquality we find in human experience. Luke Roelofs (2014, 2015)\ndevelops a form of constitutive micropsychism according to which we\ncannot recognise or imagine the basic micro-conscious ingredients\nwhich make up human consciousness, because we never experience them in\nisolation from the extremely complex combinations we find in our\nexperience; given that we are unable even to imagine the\nmicro-conscious ingredients, we have no good reason to deny that those\ningredients are extremely small in number.  Keith Turausky (2012,\nOther Internet Resources) considers the view that perhaps there is\njust one fundamental mental quality that somehow contains all others,\nin something like the way white light contains all colours. \nHuman conscious experience is not only rich in qualities, but also\nrich in structure. For example visual experience appears to have a\nstructure that corresponds to the spatial environment being\nexperienced, and experience as a whole comes carved up into distinct\nsensory modalities. The structure of our experience seems very\ndifferent from the structure of the brain, at either the micro or the\nmacro level. For the dualist this is of course not a worry, as the\nconscious mind is a completely distinct entity from the brain.\nHowever, many panpsychists believe that the conscious mind is\nidentical with, or bears a very intimate relationship with, the brain.\nMost Russellian monists, for example, believe that the conscious mind\nis the intrinsic nature of the brain. And all constitutive\nmicropsychists think that human experience is grounded in the\nproperties of micro-level entities. Thus, these forms of panpsychism\nface the challenge of explaining how the rich structure of\nconsciousness results from, or at least co-exists with, the seemingly\nvery different structure of the brain. Perhaps the most discussed form\nof the structural mismatch problem is the grain problem\n(Maxwell 1979; Lockwood 1993): the worry that experiences seem to be\nsmooth and continuous in a way that is at odds with the discrete,\nparticularized structure of brain properties. \nAgain there are numerous proposals for addressing the worry. Michael\nLockwood (1993) suggests that the worry only arises when we are\nimplicitly thinking of the brain in terms of classical physics, and\nthat it evaporates when we explicitly adopt more recent scientific\nparadigms. Stoljar (2001) argues that the alleged problem arises from\nphilosophers confusing the structure of consciousness itself with the\nstructure of what is represented by consciousness. Nagasawa &\nWager (2016) suggest that the problem goes away when we adopt\ncosmopsychism rather than micropsychism, because we no longer suppose\nthat the structure of the macro-level brain is derived from its\nstructure at the micro-level. Roelofs (2015: 182–97) has argued,\nechoing certain views of Leibniz and Spinoza, that the structure of\nour conscious experience might outstrip our awareness of it. Goff\n(2017: ch. 8) argues that we do find structure in the brain\nisomorphic with the structure of consciousness, so long as we consider\nless basic kinds of brain structure; and hence the moral of the story\nis that there is much more consciousness present in the brain than we\nordinarily suppose, corresponding both to more basic and to less basic\nbrain structures (cf. Roelofs 2015: 213–28 and Chalmers 2016:\n7.8).","contact.mail":"goffp@ceu.edu","contact.domain":"ceu.edu"}]
