Here you have\na perceptual experience since you consciously see something\nyellow. And your experience seems to justify your belief\nsince your experience seems to make it reasonable for you to believe\nthat a lemon is there.\n\nOur perceptual experiences of the world outside us seem to justify\nour beliefs about how the world outside us is. If that's right, a\nquestion in the epistemology of perception remains open: how do our\nexperiences justify beliefs about the external world? And a question\nin the philosophy of mind remains open as well: what are our\nexperiences themselves like?\n\nThis entry will survey interactions between the epistemology of\nperception and the philosophy of mind. Following the existing\nliterature, the focus will be on visual experience. The reader is\ninvited to consider how generalizations to other senses might or might\nnot succeed.\n\nSection 1 considers theories of experience and what implications\nthey might have for the epistemology of perception. Section 2\nconsiders perceptual phenomena, such as attending or dreaming, with\nspecial implications for the epistemology of perception.\n\nFor our purposes, a theory of perceptual experience aims to\nidentify a feature that is constitutive of perceptual\nexperience: it is shared by all perceptual experiences, and identifies\nat least part of their nature. In this section, we will consider\nvarious potential links between theories of experience and the\nepistemology of perception that can be captured with the following\ntemplate: \nEpistemology-Mind Link \nIf experiences justify beliefs about the external world, then\n experiences have property \\(P\\).\n The idea here is that experiences have to be a certain way in order\nto justify beliefs. Now, philosophers might accept a particular\ninstance of the E-M Link, but disagree\nabout whether experiences are the way they need to be in order to\njustify beliefs about the external world. For example, Davidson (1986)\nand McDowell (1994) agree that experiences justify beliefs about the\nexternal world only if experiences have contents that can be assessed\nfor truth. Davidson (1986) argues that experiences do not justify\nbeliefs about the external world on the grounds that they lack\ntruth-assessable contents, whereas McDowell (1994) argues that\nexperiences must have truth-assessable contents given that they\njustify beliefs about the external world (more on their dispute\nin subsection 1.2). We can organize our discussion of such agreements and disagreements\naround the following trio of claims: \nEpistemology \nOur experiences justify beliefs about the external world. \nEpistemology-Mind Link\nIf our experiences justify beliefs about the external world, then our\nexperiences have property \\(P\\). \nMind \nOur experiences do not have property \\(P\\). If Epistemology\nand Epistemology-Mind Link are true,\nthen Mind is false. Something will have\nto go. Approaches will vary according to their verdict on what exactly\nmust go. In what follows we survey the most prominent instances of the\ntrio. We will start with sense-data theories, then turn to raw feel\ntheories, and theories on which experiences have propositional\ncontents. We will close the part by considering the conscious\ncharacter of experiences. On sense-datum theories, whenever you have a visual experience as\nif there is something present that is red, there really is something\npresent that is red—a sense-datum. Now, in many cases of\nillusions and hallucination, there won't be any ordinary red thing\naround for you to experience even if there seems to you to be a red\nthing present. So sense-data are either going to be mental objects or\nat any rate very strange non-mental objects. More generally, a\nsense-datum theory is any view that accepts the following: \nThe Phenomenal Principle \nWhenever you visually experience it to be that case that something is\n\\(F\\), then there is something \\(F\\) that you experience (Robinson\n1994).  Let's first examine an epistemological case for sense-datum\ntheories. Here the direction of flow is from epistemology to the\nphilosophy of mind. We can find it in the following famous quote from\nH.H. Price: \nWhen I see a tomato there is much that I can doubt … One thing\nhowever I cannot doubt: that there exists a red patch of a round and\nsomewhat bulgy shape, standing out from a background of other\ncolour-patches, and having a certain visual depth, and that this whole\nfield of colour is presented to my consciousness … (Price 1932:\n3). On Price's line of thought, perceptual experiences do afford us\n with some certainty. When Price sees a tomato, he may be certain that\n there is something red and round present. According to critics of the\n argument, Price is not entitled to be certain of any such thing. For\n example, his experience might merely represent that there exists\n something red and round present, where such representation can occur\n even if nothing red and round is present (for more on this objection\n see the entry on \n  the problem of perception\n (section 3.1.2). Let's now turn to the status of beliefs about ordinary objects in\nthe external world, and the flow from the philosophy of mind to\nepistemology. We can organize our discussion under the following\ninstance of the trio: \nEpistemology \nExperiences justify beliefs about the external world. \nEpistemology-Mind Link 1 \nIf experiences justify beliefs about the external world, then\nexperiences are not relations to sense-data. \nMind 1 \nExperiences are relations to sense-data. In principle, a sense-datum theorist might\naccept E-M Link 1\nand Mind 1, and conclude\nthat Epistemology is false. For\nexample, she might take up a coherence theory of justification, on\nwhich our beliefs about the external world are justified by their\ncoherence with each other and not by experiences (for more on this move, see the \nentry on\n  sense-data (section 3.2). In the usual line of discussion, philosophers\naffirm Epistemology\nand E-M Link 1, and conclude\nthat Mind 1 is false (see Berkeley\n1710/2008: sect 18 or Reid 1764/1997: ch. 1). Sense-datum theories\ntell us that the things we are directly aware of in perceptual\nexperience are not ordinary external objects. As the commonly used\nmetaphor has it, sense-data theories draw a veil of ideas\nover the world. The usual objection holds that this veil makes it\nimpossible for us to gain knowledge or justified belief from\nexperience about the external world. Philosophers such as Berkeley and\nReid reject sense-datum theories on the grounds that we do have\nepistemic access to the world. In response, the sense-datum theorist might deny E-M Link 1. In particular, the\ntheorist might say that experiences justify beliefs about the external\nworld when complemented with reflection on how they are best explained\n(Russell 1912). Call this the IBE approach since it concerns\nInferences to the Best Explanation of our experiences (see Vogel 1990\nfor more contemporary discussion). Setting aside debate about how such\nan explanation might go, and why it might be the best, the response\nmight not go far enough. To see why the IBE approach might not go far enough, consider the\nidea that experiences provide non-inferential justification\nfor beliefs about the external world. If experiences provide\nnon-inferential justification for beliefs about the external world,\nthey justify beliefs through a route that does not involve further\nbeliefs. Compare how your sharp pain might justify you directly in\nbelieving that you are in pain, without further beliefs playing any\nrole. Contrast how your thermometer might justify you in believing you\nhave a fever only in conjunction with your having reason to believe\nthe thermometer works. Non-inferential justification is justification\nthat does not involve auxiliary beliefs (see Pryor 2005 for more\ndetail). On the IBE approach, it seems that experiences at best give us\ninferential justification for beliefs about the external world.\nThat's because they justify us only in conjunction with whatever\nbeliefs their best explanation brings in. Experiences arguably do\nbetter (Johnston 2006). The veil of ideas objection might then be\nbetter put as follows: \nEpistemology1 \nExperiences give non-inferential justification for beliefs about the\n external world. \nEpistemology-Mind Link 2 \nIf experiences give non-inferential justification for beliefs about\nthe external world, then experiences are not relations to\nsense-data. So, \nnot-Mind 1 \nExperiences are not relations to sense-data. Even still, it is unclear why sense-datum theories should rule out\ngetting non-inferential justification from experiences. Perhaps if a\nsense-datum theory is true, we at best see external objects\nindirectly, by means of seeing sense-data. But this is a point in the\nphilosophy of mind about seeing and not yet a point about\nepistemology. Our justification for beliefs could still be\nnon-inferential (Moore 1953; Silins 2011). The crucial question for\nepistemology is about the role of background beliefs, and the mental\nprocess of indirect perception need not make use of background\nbeliefs. For instance, whether you indirectly perceive objects by\nmeans of sense-data might instead just be a matter of how the\nsense-data are caused, leaving open the possibility that you gain\nnon-inferential justification for beliefs about the external world\nfrom sense-data. Let's now zoom out to a big picture assessment of the epistemic\nimplications of sense-datum theories. The thought driving the veil of ideas worry is that if experiences\nfail to put us in direct contact with reality, then they cannot\njustify beliefs about external reality. This thought is meant to get\nus to the conclusion that sense datum theory is false. But it might go\ntoo far. The first ramification concerns seeing objects. According to many\nviews, we see ordinary extended objects by seeing their surfaces,\nrather than seeing them directly (see Moore 1918 or Broad 1952, and\nClarke 1965 or Campbell 2004 for dispute). As far as seeing objects\ngoes, their facing surfaces play the same role as sense-data did on\nmany versions of the sense-datum theory—intermediaries not\nidentical with objects that still permit us to see objects by seeing\nthem. But now, if we endorse the veil of ideas objection, the facing\nsurfaces of objects would be a veil over the rest of external\nreality. Call this the veil of surfaces. Our experiences\nwould fail to give us access to whether we live in a world of ever\nshifting facades or instead a world of three-dimensional objects as\nthey are ordinarily conceived.  Descartes arguably states this problem\nwhen he writes: \nI remember that, when looking from a window and saying I see men who\npass in the street, I really do not see them, but infer that what I\nsee is men, just as I say that I see wax. And yet what do I see from\nthe window but hats and coats which may cover automatic machines?\n(PW, p. 21 ) If the veil of ideas objection succeeds against sense-data\ntheories, it might also rule out the theory that we directly perceive\nonly surfaces. It is not clear whether the objection can get us that\nfar. \nThe veil of ideas objection also has controversial ramifications for\ncases of illusion or hallucination. When something looks red to you\nwhen it isn't, or when you have a hallucination of a bloody dagger in\nfront of you, your experience fails to put you in direct contact with\nreality as it is. According to many approaches, your experience might\nstill—misleadingly—justify you in believing that reality\nis the way it visually appears to be. However, if the thought driving\nthe veil of ideas objection is correct, experiences only justify in\nthose cases when you are seeing things as they are. This is quite a\ndemanding view, one that rules out justification in a wide range of\ncases where many think it is present. (For more discussion of views\nthat exclude perceptual justification from cases of illusion or\nhallucination, see section 2.2.). \nAccording to sense-data theories, all visual experiences relate us to\nobjects with the properties attributed by our visual experiences.  At\nan opposite extreme, one might hold that experiences are “raw\nfeels”, failing to present the world to us in any way. To get a\nfeel for this line of thought, consider the experience of\n“seeing stars”. According to some views, your experience\nhere is a mere sensation, failing to present your surroundings to you\n(cf. Smith 2002: 130–1). On these views, the expression of “seeing\nstars” is extremely misleading here, as you do not literally see\nstars, and do not even figuratively see anything else—it is not\nas if your experience is of anything in the scene. According to raw\nfeel theory, all visual experiences are in fact like this, not just\nexceptional ones. As Bonjour puts it, we capture what our visual\nexperiences are like “in terms of patches of color arranged in\ntwo-dimensional visual space” (2001: 32). (For a survey of views\nthat could fall under the heading of “raw feel theory” as\nused here, see entry on\n  contents of perception (section 2.1). \nIn a passage from “A Coherence Theory of Truth and\nKnowledge”, Donald Davidson can be read as using raw feel theory\nto argue for a skeptical epistemological conclusion: \nThe relation between a sensation and a belief cannot be logical, since\nsensations are not beliefs or other propositional attitudes. What then\nis the relation? The answer is, I think, obvious: the relation is\ncausal. Sensations cause some beliefs and in this sense are the basis\nor ground of those beliefs. But a causal explanation of a belief does\nnot show how or why the belief is justified. (1986: 310) By itself, the view that experiences are raw feels is silent about\nwhether experiences are able to justify beliefs about the external\nworld. To get to conclusions about epistemology, some sort of linking\nprinciple is needed. Davidson's idea is that a source can supply\njustification only if it has propositional content, so that the source\nis assessable as accurate or inaccurate, depending on whether the\nrelevant proposition is true. On this way of setting up the issues, an\nexperience has “propositional content” by having content\nthat is assessable for truth (for further discussion of how to clarify\nthe idea that experiences have propositional content, see the entry on\n  the contents of perception;\n Byrne 2009; Pautz 2009; or Siegel 2012). Given\nDavidson's demand, experiences would be unable to justify beliefs if\nthey were merely raw feels or sensations. (For important precedents to\nDavidson here, see Sellars 1956 and Popper 1959: chapter 5. For\nfurther contemporary discussion, see Bonjour 1985; McDowell 1994;\nBrewer 1999; and Pryor 2005.). We can sketch the issues raised by Davidson with the following\ninstance of our trio: \nEpistemology \nExperiences justify beliefs about the external world. \nEpistemology-Mind Link 3 \nIf experiences justify beliefs about the external world, then\nexperiences have propositional content. \nMind 2 \nExperiences are raw feels without propositional content. The Davidsonian response to the trio is to\naccept E-M Link 3\nand Mind 2, but to\ndeny Epistemology. A different response to the trio\naccepts E-M Link3, but\nuses Epistemology to\nreject Mind 2. This position was\noccupied by McDowell 1994 and Brewer 1999 (although they later revised\ntheir views in Brewer 2006 and McDowell 2009). Let us focus on debate about E-M Link\n3, the common ground between Davidson, McDowell and Brewer. It\ncan be resisted by raw feel theorists, as well as by non-raw feel\ntheorists who fall short of attributing propositional contents to\nexperiences. Why believe E-M Link 3 at all?\nDavidson's own case appeals to the claim that, in order for an\nexperience to justify a belief, the experience must make more probable\nor entail the content of the belief (he also uses the further\nassumption that only propositional contents can do any such\nthing). It's not clear why all raw feel theorists must accept the\ndemand. Think back to the experience of “seeing stars”,\nand suppose that the experience is indeed a raw feel. The experience\nmight still justify the belief that you are having that particular\nexperience, whether or not it is a raw feel. Analogously, if pains are\nbest understood as raw feels, they arguably could still justify you in\nbelieving that you have them. Now, if experiences could lack\npropositional contents and still justify you in believing you have\nthem, why couldn't they still also justify beliefs about the external\nworld? In particular, at least if background beliefs are allowed to\nplay a role, it seems perfectly possible for beliefs about the\nexternal world to be justified thanks to the availability of\ninferences linking particular raw feels with particular conditions of\nthe external world. The justificatory structure here would look like\nthis: (For a contemporary view with this sort of structure, see Bonjour\n2001). One also might try to meet the spirit of the demand that justifiers\nincrease probability or entail without attributing propositional\ncontents to experiences. Here it's important to note the rich range of\nways in which experiences might be directed at the world. Many of\nthese ways need not involve propositional content. First, even if experiences lack contents that are assessable for\ntruth, experiences might still have contents that are assessable for\naccuracy. Burge 2010 suggests that experience contents have the form\n‘that \\(F\\)’, and are accurate just in case the referent has\nthe property \\(F\\). Alternatively, consider how a map or picture might\nbe accurate or inaccurate without being true or false. When\nexperiences are accurate in either of these ways, other contents of\nbeliefs will be true. So experiences could lack propositional\ncontents, but still count as close enough to entailing the contents of\nbeliefs or to increasing the probability of the contents of\nbeliefs. Second, experiences might lack contents altogether, and not be\nassessable for truth or accuracy, but still be related in important\nways to relations to the world such as seeing (Campbell 2002; McDowell\n2009; Brewer 2006, 2011). According to these approaches, your\nexperience justifies a belief about the world only when your\nexperience is a case of seeing the world as it is. You can see the\nworld as it is only if it is in fact that way. Here many of your\nexperiences might be supremely positioned to justify whether or not\nthey have any content. (For more about such\napproaches, see subsection 2.2.). In sum, raw feel theorists might be in a good position to reject\nE-M Link 3. Moreover,\neven if experiences are not raw feels, they might also lack\npropositional contents, and still be directed at the world in a way\nthat helps them to justify beliefs. Let us now turn to more fine-grained connections between contents\nof experience and perceptual justification, focusing on contents of\nexperience that can be assessed for truth. First, is having the content that \\(p\\) necessary for an experience\nto justify believing that \\(p\\)? Here is a first pass at capturing the\nissue: \nEpistemology-Mind Link4 \nIf your visual experience \\(e\\) gives you justification to believe some\nexternal world proposition that \\(p\\), then \\(e\\) has the content that\n\\(p\\). A challenge comes from cases when you use an experience and\nbackground beliefs to extrapolate far beyond any content the\nexperience might have. For example, when I have an experience in New\nYork with the content that the traffic light is red, my background\nbeliefs enable the experience to justify me in believing that cars are\npermitted to turn right. But this legally informed belief is in a\ncontent that most likely does not figure in my experience. To accommodate extrapolation beyond experience thanks to auxiliary\nbeliefs, the simplest response is to focus on non-inferential\njustification that does not involve auxiliary beliefs (we set aside\nwhether there other ways to reformulate the thesis). \nEpistemology-Mind Link5 \nIf your visual experience \\(e\\) gives you non-inferential justification\nto believe some external world proposition that \\(p\\), then \\(e\\) has the\ncontent that \\(p\\). On this line of thought, if your experience justifies you in\nbelieving that \\(p\\) in a way that does not include auxiliary beliefs,\nthen your experience has the content that \\(p\\). If the Necessity thesis is true, it allows for rich connections\nbetween theories of perceptual experience and theories of perceptual\njustification. Consider for instance the debate about “high-level”\ncontent. Very roughly, this debate is about whether our experiences\nmerely represent colors, shapes and locations, or whether they\nrepresent thicker properties or relations such as causing an\nexplosion, being a fake Louis Vuitton bag, being virtuous, or being\nglad to see you (for more see the entry on \n the contents of perception,\nSiegel 2006, or the papers collected in Brogaard 2013). If the Necessity thesis is true, and we have non-inferential\njustification for belief in high-level contents, it will follow that\nsome of our experiences have high-level contents as well. But how to\nestablish that our experiences give us non-inferential justification\nfor some high level beliefs?  One route is to try to leverage the psychological immediacy of our\nformation of some high level beliefs. When the fashionista sees the\ndroopy bag marked “Louis Vuitton” in a cheap Shenzhen mall, she does\nnot need to puzzle out whether it is a fake, or to pull out her\nlighter to test whether the material melts likes plastic. Instead she\nforms her belief that the bag is a fake Louis Vuitton without any\nconscious reflection. Likewise, we don't need to puzzle out whether\nour loved ones are present when we see them—we seem to recognize\nthem on the basis of our experiences without reasoning.  Still, it may\nbe that auxiliary beliefs are playing a role in all these examples\nwhile remaining unconscious. Auxiliary beliefs could play a mediating\nrole without ever being conscious. The psychological immediacy of\nbelief formation needn't go along with non-inferential justification\n(see McDowell 1982). For further discussion of how to show we have non-inferential\njustification from experiences for some beliefs in high-level\ncontents, and of whether the experiences themselves would need to have\nhigh-level contents to do so, see Millar 2000, McDowell 2009, or\nSilins 2013. \nFor further defense of the claim that an experience justifies a belief\nonly if it has a content identical with that of the belief, see\nMcDowell 1994 and Brewer 1999. For critical responses, see Speaks 2005\nand Byrne 2005. Is having the content that \\(p\\) enough for an experience to\njustifying you believing that \\(p\\)? Here is a first pass at capturing\nthe idea: \nSufficiency First Pass \nIf you have an experience \\(e\\) with the content that \\(p\\), then \\(e\\)\ngives you justification to believe that \\(p\\). The Sufficiency thesis is not formulated in terms of non-inferential\njustification. For all it says, whenever an experience justifies a\nbelief, it does so only in a way involving the assistance of an\nauxiliary belief. Still, the picture does mesh well with views on\nwhich experiences give non-inferential justification, and we may\nunderstand it in those terms in what follows.  Our thesis does need to be qualified. For example, suppose that\nyou gain convincing evidence that you are the victim of an illusion,\nas when you learn that the lines of the Müller-Lyer illusion are\nthe same in length even though they look to be different in\nlength: Figure 1. Müller-Lyer illusion[1] Your experience does not give you justification to believe that the\nlines are different in length once you have gain the evidence they are\nthe same in length. Such cases are ones of “defeat”. To\ntake account of such cases, the fan of Sufficiency can say that  \nSufficiency \nIf you have an experience \\(e\\) with the content that \\(p\\), then \\(e\\)\ngives you defeasible justification to believe that \\(p\\). Here the core idea is that your experience gives you justification\nunless you have gained evidence that your experience is misleading. For defenses of theses along the lines of Sufficiency, see Pollock\n(1974), Pryor (2000) or Huemer (2001, 2007). Their strategies put much\nweight on what it is like to have an experience (see more\nin section 2.4 on this sort of strategy). A\ndifferent approach looks at how experiences come to have their\ncontents. For examples of this strategy, see Burge 2003; Peacocke\n2004; Sawyer and Majors 2005;\nand Setiya 2012: ch. 3. The Sufficiency thesis also promises to establish rich connections\nbetween epistemology and the philosophy of mind. Consider again the\ndebate about high-level contents of experience. If one is able to\nestablish that experiences have high-level contents, one could then\nuse the Sufficiency thesis to reach the conclusion that experiences\njustify beliefs in high-level contents as well. Assuming that experiences with the content that \\(p\\) will give\nnon-inferential justification for a belief that \\(p\\), we could then\nhave an answer to an important question for foundationalist views in\nepistemology. These are views on which our inferentially justified\nbeliefs about the external world are inferred from a foundation of\nnon-inferentially justified beliefs (for more see the entry on\n foundationalist theories of epistemic justification).\n Which beliefs get to be in the\nfoundation? This question for foundationalist views is pressing. As\nNozick remarks in Philosophical Explanations, it is of little\nuse to have a foundation for our knowledge that is only one brick wide\n(1981: 3). In general, the more restrictive foundationalist views are\nabout the breadth of our foundational beliefs, the harder it will be\nto build up to everyday beliefs about the world. However, if beliefs\nconcerning causation, emotions, or morality get to be foundational,\nthe foundationalist project can look much more promising (Masrour\n2011). If Sufficiency were true, and our experiences had contents\nconcerning causation, emotions, or morality, we could then start\nenquiry from such beliefs. As helpful as the Sufficiency thesis could be for foundationalists,\nit faces a lot of criticism. Many objections proceed by proposing\nrequirements for justification that are not always satisfied when one\nhas an experience with a given content. Such cases would then be ones\nin which you have an experience with a certain content, and yet it\ndoes not give you reason to believe that content. For example, one\nmight demand that the experience be a case of seeing\n(section 2.2 of this entry), or demand that the\nexperience be suitably free of top-down influence from one's own mind\n(section 2.4 of this entry). Here we will focus on objections that turn on the character of\nperceptual content. The objection here is known as “the problem\nof the speckled hen” (see Chisholm 1942; Sosa in Sosa and Bonjour 2003; Markie 2009 for different versions of the problem). To get a feel for our problem, suppose you get a look at a speckled\nhen in good light, but without enough time to carefully count the\nnumber of speckles on it. Figure 2.\n“Speckled Sussex Hen named Mata Hari”[2] The objection to Sufficiency can be put as follows. First, your\nexperience does have a content about how many spots face you—say\nto the effect that \\(H\\) has 17 spots. Second, your experience does not\njustify you in believing that \\(H\\) has 17 spots. After all, forming a\nbelief that \\(H\\) has 17 spots without carefully counting might seem no\nmore likely to be right than a guess. So, the critic concludes, some\nexperiences have the content that \\(p\\) without giving you justification\nto believe that \\(p\\). In response, some argue that your experience is actually silent\nabout the exact number of speckles facing you on the hen (see Tye\n2009; for more on experience and numeracy, see Beck 2012).  One can raise the core challenge to Sufficiency in other ways.\nAnother source of examples can be found in Block's (2007) empirically\ninformed work on “phenomenal overflow” (drawing on\nSperling 1960 and Lamme 2003). Consider for example the Sperling\nparadigm, in which subjects are flashed a grid of letters, and only\nsubsequently given a tone that indicates which row to report (high for\nthe top, medium for the middle, etc). Subjects are able to report any\nrow singled out without being able to report them all. (For an online\ndemo without sound, see Other Internet\nResources). Arguably subjects experience all the letters as they\nare without being able to report them all (but see Stazicker 2011 or\nPhillips 2011 for criticisms of Block). The objector add that we do\nnot have justification from our experience to believe the proposition\nthat enumerates all the letters present. (For a further way to set up\nthe speckled hen problem, using the example of highly determinate\ncolors, see Smithies 2012a). Even if one allows that some experiences have enough determinacy to\nset up the speckled hen problem, the option remains of maintaining\nthat the experiences do give you justification to believe the relevant\ndeterminate proposition. For example, perhaps your experiences do give\nyou justification to believe the determinate proposition, even though\nyou are unable to take advantage of the justification you have by\nforming a belief on their basis (see Smithies 2012a for a view with\nthis structure). Alternatively, perhaps speckled hen cases are compatible with\nSufficiency since they turn out to be cases of defeat. Given that we\nare generally aware of our poor ability to make snap judgments about\nthe details of the scene before, perhaps we have defeasible but\ndefeated justification to believe detailed propositions about the\nscene before us. \nSo far we have focused on the ramifications for epistemology of the\nview that experiences have propositional contents. Intentionalism is a\nmore ambitious view in the philosophy of mind that aims to find\nnecessary connections between the conscious character of an\nexperience—what it is like to have it—and the content of\nthat experience. According to intentionalists, at a minimum, \nMinimal Intentionalism \nIf experiences \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\) have the same content, then what it is\nlike to have \\(e_1\\) is the same as what it is like to have \\(e_2\\). In a slogan, “same content, same character” (for\ndiscussion of further variations in the camp, see Chalmers 2004). Here we will point to some epistemological ramifications of the\nview. \nOne way to defend Intentionalism examines how we become\nintrospectively aware of what it's like to have our experiences.\nArguably we become introspectively aware of what it's like to have our\nexperiences only by being aware of what we are experiencing. Perhaps\nawareness of the world is the sole route to introspective awareness of\nwhat it's like to have a given experience. And perhaps this point\nabout introspection supports at least a minimal version of\nIntentionalism. For further discussion of this broadly epistemological\nargument for intentionalism, see the entry on \n qualia (section 6), also the\nentry on\n representational theories of consciousness\n (section 3.3). Another defense of Intentionalism examines how we become able to\nthink about certain properties by having experiences. Perhaps\nexperiences are sufficient for certain cognitive abilities, and\nperhaps Intentionalism gives the best explanation of how experiences\nare sufficient for certain cognitive abilities. For an exposition of\nthis broadly epistemological line of argument for Intentionalism, see\nPautz 2010. For an epistemological argument against some versions of\nIntentionalism, see Kriegel 2011. He targets versions of the view that\naim to find what constitutes experience in terms of awareness of\nproperties (or a suitably similar relation to properties).  According\nto Kriegel, just as sense-data theories are unable to provide an\nadequate epistemology because of the “veil of appearances”\nthey impose between perceivers and the world, the targeted versions of\nIntentionalism fail to provide an adequate epistemology for the same\nreason. As we saw in section 2.1, sense-data\ntheorists have ways to respond to veil objections.  Perhaps\nintentionalists do as well. An uncontroversial theory of perceptual experiences holds that they\nall have a conscious character—for any experience \\(e\\) there is\nsomething it is like to have \\(e\\). Further, part of what it is for\nsomething to be an experience is for it to have a conscious\ncharacter. There is much debate about how to explain the nature of\nperceptual consciousness, but there is little debate about whether\nsomething is an experience only if it has a conscious character. There is much more room for debate about the importance of\nconsciousness for the epistemology of perception. One strategy of\nexplaining how experiences justify beliefs focuses on their conscious\ncharacter. We may call it the phenomenal approach. To see why this approach is a contender, consider subjects who have\n“blindsight”. They have unconscious visual representations\nof what's in their blind field without having conscious visual\nexperience of anything in their blind field (see Weiskrantz 2009 for a\nsurvey). These subjects are better than chance at identifying objects\nin their blind field, but they have to be prompted to make a\nguess. For our purposes, imagine a hypothetical blindsighted subject\nwho does not need to be prompted to form a belief that there is an \\(X\\)\nto the left. Now compare that subject with an ordinary sighted subject\nwho forms a belief that there is an \\(X\\) to the left on the basis of\nvisual experience. There are various questions here whose answers might support the\nphenomenal approach (see Smithies 2012a for more). First, is the blindsighted subject completely unjustified in\nbelieving that there is an \\(X\\) to the left? If you think the answer to\nthis question is yes, and you're not a skeptic about the sighted\nsubject, you arguably should be sympathetic to the phenomenal\napproach. What else would explain this difference between them? Second, is the blindsighted subject at any rate less justified than\nthe sighted subject in believing that there is an \\(X\\) to the left? If\nyou think the answer here is yes, again you arguably should be\nsympathetic to the phenomenal approach. What else would explain this\nepistemic difference between them? In response, one might deny that the epistemic differences obtain\n(see Lyons 2009). Even if one accepts that the epistemic differences\nobtain, one might still insist that they are equally or better\nexplained by alternative candidates than consciousness. For example,\nperhaps the blindsighted subject does not count as seeing the \\(X\\), and\nperhaps the sighted subject is more justified than the blindsighted\nsubject simply thanks to seeing the \\(X\\) (as an \\(X\\)). Here the\nexplanatory burden would be borne by bearing a perceptual relation to\nthe thing, rather than having an experience with a certain\ncharacter. Here it might help to compare the sighted subject with a conscious\nsubject for whom things are just the same from the inside, but who\nfails to see any \\(X\\) because she is hallucinating. If the sighted\nsubject and the hallucinating subject are equally justified in\nbelieving there is an \\(X\\) to the left, visual experience might be a\nbetter candidate than seeing to explain the epistemic symmetry between\nthe sighted and the hallucinating subjects. Suppose the blindsighted subject and sighted subject are equally\njustified—is the phenomenal approach then doomed? Speaking\nloosely, even if the blindsighted subject has the same epistemic\neffect as the sighted subject, it's not entirely clear that there must\nbe the same cause. Analogously, even if there are physical duplicates\nof us without consciousness who perform the same bodily movements as\nus, the possibility remains open that some of our own bodily movements\nare explained by conscious pains and the like. To support the claim that consciousness doesn't supply perceptual\njustification, one might look to other real-life cases of unconscious\nvisual representation. One sort of case is that of unconscious\npriming. Here you are exposed to a stimulus too quickly for it to\nregister in visual experience, but for all that it still does affect\nyour behavior. For example, an unconsciously registered numeral might\nimprove your ability to report that a subsequently seen numeral is\ngreater or lower than 5, depending on whether the priming one is\nitself greater or lower than 5 (Naccache and Dehaene 2001). Now this\nsort of case is arguably not one in which unconscious visual\nrepresentations justify. The subjects concerned plausibly do not form\nbeliefs that are good candidates to be justified by their unconscious\nvisual representations. But consider people with visual hemi-neglect,\nwho seem to lack conscious visual experience of their neglected\nfield. Some neglect patients seem to take in information about the\nneglected stimuli, and to form beliefs about it. For instance, some of\nthem, when presented with a burning house in their neglected field and a normal house in their normal field, prefer the one that isn't on fire (Marshall and Halligan 1988; Bisiach and Rusconi 1990). Here they do form a belief that is a candidate to be\njustified by their unconscious visual representation. Their belief\nthat the house in their neglected field isn't preferable might be justified by the\ninformation they take in, even if the intake is through unconscious\nperception. If this case is one in which the subject is justified, and\njustified to the same degree as in ordinary cases of conscious\nperception, one might then start to wonder whether consciousness must\nplay a role even in ordinary cases of perceptual\njustification. Perhaps it is side-stepped by unconscious visual\nrepresentations even then. (For a rich range of examples of\nunconscious perception, see Hassin, Uleman, and Bargh 2006. For\napproaches to the epistemology of perception that minimize the role of\nconsciousness, see Burge 2003 and Lyons 2009). If the conscious character of experiences does play a justifying\nrole, a further question remains about why it does so. One might hold\nthat there is no further explanation to be provided here.  Perhaps the\ncapacity of consciousness to justify is a fundamental fact of\nepistemology. According to another proposal, consciousness justifies\nthanks to being introspectively accessible. On this internalist conception of justification, a special kind of access to a source is necessary for the source to\nprovide justification, and consciousness stands out for allowing this\nsort of access (see e.g. Smithies 2012b). Here we will focus on a particular aspect of the conscious\ncharacter of experiences, one highlighted by Pryor (2000) among\nothers. To get a feel for the feature, first look away from this\nsurface and imagine a black circle in front of you. Now look at this\nsurface and have a visual experience of a black circle in front of\nyou. In the former case, you were not justified in believing that there\nis a black circle in front of you. In the present case, you are. One\ncandidate way to explain the epistemic difference is to focus on a\ndifference between what it is like to imagine and what it is like to\nhave a visual experience (see Martin 2002 for more). The salient feature of experience here is not easy to pin down.\n The rough idea is that, when you visually experience, as opposed to\n when you visually imagine, things are presented to you as actually\n being the case. How this feature of experience is best to be\n understood is open to debate. For now let us leave open its exact\n nature and simply use the term “presentational\n phenomenology” as a place-holder for whatever it is (for more\n see Chudnoff 2012 or Bengson forthcoming).\n  Even if presentational phenomenology is epistemically privileged,\nthere remains an important question about its scope. Suppose you see a\ncow through a picket fence. There is arguably some way you\nperceptually “get” that there is an extended cow there.\nFor a dramatic contrast, start by considering Damien Hirst's\nSome Comfort Gained From the Acceptance of the Inherent Lies in Everything, that consists of a cow vertically sliced into a series of boxes arranged like dominos.  \nNow suppose you know you are seeing the Hirst sculpture through a\npicket fence, where the segments align exactly with the gaps in the\nfence. Here you arguably would not perceptually “get” that\nthere is an elongated cow there. In the ordinary case of seeing a cow through a picket fence, it is\ndebatable whether presentational phenomenology includes the presence\nof an extended cow, or whether it includes only those regions of the\ncow not occluded by the fence (see Noe 2005 for further discussion).\nIf your presentational phenomenology includes only the non-occluded\nregions, and only presentational phenomenology supplies perceptual\njustification, the rational powers of experience threaten to be\nlimited. You would not have justification to believe that an extended\ncow is present just by taking your experience at face\nvalue. Analogously, if only the facing surface of an object is\nphenomenally present, you might have justification to believe only\nthat the facing surface is present by taking your experience at face\nvalue. Here we might find ourselves back at the “veil of\nsurfaces” discussed in section 2.2. Some\nmight accept this prediction. Some might prefer to take a more\nexpansive view of presentational phenomenology. Others might conclude\nthat presentational phenomenology is not the key supplier of\nperceptual justification. We have now surveyed the epistemic implications of some central\ntheories of experience. We have by no means covered all theories of\nexperience. Here we will simply point to further important areas to\nconsider. For discussion of naïve realist theories of experience,\nand of their interaction with issues about skepticism, see the entries\non\n   epistemological problems of perception \nand\n the disjunctive theory of perception. \n For discussion of how dualist theories of experience might lead to\n epiphenomenalism, where epiphenomenalism might lead to skeptical problems, \nsee the entry on\n  epiphenomenalism (section 2.3).\n For discussion of the theory that experience is actually a special case\n of belief, where that theory might affect our understanding of how we\n base beliefs on experiences, see  the entry on\n  the contents of perception (section 2.2). Let us now consider the significance for epistemology of a range of\nperceptual phenomena. On most views, these phenomena do not occur in\nall cases of perception, but still have important ramifications for\nthe epistemology of perception. The first array of phenomena are concerned with the relation\nbetween experience and the world. Here we will consider different\nkinds of perceptual error, as well as forms of perception that occur\nonly in the absence of error. The remaining phenomena we will consider\nare characterized by the internal etiology of experience. Here we will\nlook at the influence of attention and of other mental states on our\nexperience. In cases of perceptual error, we form a false belief on the basis\nof an experience, as when an uninformed subject concludes there is\nmotion below (to get the effect, let your eyes drift over the\nimage): Figure 3. “Rotating snakes”[3] This is a paradigm case of an illusion, where you do see a scene,\nbut misperceive what the scene is like. In a paradigm case of\nhallucination, you have a perceptual experience, but do not perceive\nanything in the scene before you. Few dispute that there are cases of perceptual error (although some\ndisagree about whether perceptual error is ever properly at the level\nof experience as opposed to that of beliefs formed on the basis of\nexperiences, cf. Brewer 2006). Many skeptical arguments use the\noccurrence of perceptual error to conclude that experiences do not do\na particular job in epistemology. We can understand these arguments as\nusing different versions of\nthe Epistemology-Mind Link:  \nEpistemology-Mind Link6 \nIf experiences sometimes deceive us, then experiences do not give us\nknowledge of the external world. \nEpistemology-Mind Link7 \nIf experiences sometimes deceive us, then experiences do not give us\njustified beliefs about the external world. For discussion of how to supplement or defend such principles, see\nthe entries on\n  skepticism\nand\n epistemological problems of perception. Here we will focus on a weaker principle that addresses the kind of\njustification we can get from perceptual experiences: \nEpistemology-Mind Link8 \nIf experiences sometimes deceive us, then experiences at best give us\ninferential justification for beliefs about the external world. If our experiences sometime deceive us, there is a\n“gap” between our having of the experience and the truth\nof the proposition they putatively\njustify. On E-M Link8, some\nintermediate belief will then be needed to close the gap between\nexperience and truth, for example a belief to the effect that our\nexperiences are reliable.  Given the need for an intermediate belief,\nour experiences will then arguably fail to give us non-inferential\njustification for beliefs about the external world. This conclusion is\nendorsed by philosophers who still reject skepticism about perceptual\njustification (Cohen 2002; Wright\n2004; or White 2006). E-M Link8 might still lead to\nskepticism. Consider an auxiliary belief meant to bridge the gap\nbetween experience and truth, and ask whether whatever process that\nlead to it might sometimes deceive us. For example, consider your\nbelief that your experiences are reliable, and whatever process led to\nyour belief that your experiences are reliable. That process could\narguably lead you to falsely believe your experiences are reliable in\na situation where you are radically deceived by an evil demon. We now have a gap between the occurring of the process that led to\nan auxiliary belief and the truth of the auxiliary belief. So then,\naccording to the reasoning behind E-M\nLink8, we would need another auxiliary belief to bridge the\ngap. Since an evil demon could presumably deceive us yet again, we\nthreaten to have a vicious regress here. E-M\nLink8 might end up having undesired skeptical\nimplications. (White 2006 articulates this line of thought without\nendorsing it). We have considered the significance of illusion and\nhallucination. Let's now examine the case of dreams. Dreams are often\nunderstood to be paradigms of perceptual error, for example by\nDescartes when he writes that \nthis would not happen with such distinctness to someone\nasleep. Indeed! As if I did not remember other occasions when I have\nbeen tricked by exactly similar thoughts while asleep! (PW, p. 13) The picture of dreaming as a case of perceptual error is challenged\nby Sosa (2005). We can frame the issue with a simplified argument for\nskepticism: \nEpistemology-Mind Link9 \nIf our experiences justify beliefs about our present surroundings, our\nexperiences do not frequently deceive us while we dream. \nMind \nOur experiences frequently deceive us while we dream. So, \nNot-Epistemology \nOur experiences do not justify our beliefs about our present\nsurroundings. Sosa responds (to a more complex skeptical argument focused on\nknowledge) by defending an alternative conception of dreams known as\n“the imagination model”. On this model, we actually do not\nform beliefs about our surroundings when we dream, or even have\nperceptual experiences when we dream. To see a defense of the imagination model, consider that, when I go\nto bed, I form and store a belief that I am lying in bed. If I were to\nform a belief while I am dreaming that I am running away from lions, I\nwould then have a belief that contradicts my stored belief that I am\nlying in bed. Now we arguably do not have such contradictory beliefs\nwhile we are dreaming. The view that we form beliefs while dreaming\nmight then be what has to go (Sosa 2005: 6). \nLet's now consider the case of visual experience. On the imagination\nmodel, when dreaming we do not even have visual experiences with the\nsame conscious character as those we have when awake (we leave open\nwhether we have “visual experiences” while dreaming in\nsome extended sense). The argument at this stage can exploit the\nearlier conclusion that we do not form beliefs about our surroundings\nwhile dreaming. Sosa defends the further thesis on the grounds that,\nif we did have experiences when dreaming with the conscious character\nof those we have when awake, we would be open to epistemic criticism\nfor failing to form beliefs that take our experiences at face\nvalue. However when I dream that I am being attacked by a lion, but do\nnot believe while I dream that I am being attacked by a lion, I\narguably am not open to epistemic criticism. If the imagination model of dreaming is correct, the skeptical\nargument above is unsound because Mind is false. For discussion of\nwhether Sosa succeeds in blocking the best dreaming arguments for\nskepticism, see Ichikawa 2009. For further discussion specifically of the visual\ncharacter of dreams, see Schwitzgebel 2011: ch. 1. Some epistemologists privilege perceptual states that you are in\nonly if you are not in cases of illusion or hallucination. On their\nviews, these states are either the only sources of perceptual\njustification, or at any rate the best sources of perceptual\njustification. In the terminology of Hawthorne and Kovakovich 2006, we\nmay call these perceptual states “success states”. To get a sense of some of the candidate states, consider the\nfollowing table: (Successful) vision Illusion Hallucination Having a visual experience with the content that\n\\(a\\) is \\(F\\) Y Y Y Seeing \\(a\\) as being \\(F\\) Y Y N Seeing that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\) Y N N Seeing \\(a\\)'s \\(F\\)ness Y N N (In setting up this table, we assume that hallucinations of a\nparticular object are possible. For discussion, see Johnston 2004 or\nSchellenberg 2010.) Epistemologists differ according to which success states they\nprivilege, what job they assign to the state, and how severely they\nregard the absence of the privileged state. For views which privilege seeing that \\(p\\), see McDowell (1982,\n1995) or A. Jackson (2011). For views which privilege something along\nthe lines of seeing \\(a\\)'s \\(F\\)ness, see Johnston (2006). These states\nare fact-entailing, since as a matter of necessity, you see\nthat \\(a\\) is \\(F\\), or see \\(a\\)'s \\(F\\)ness, only if \\(a\\) is in fact \\(F\\).\nFor a view that potentially favors the sort of perceptual state you\nfind in cases of vision and illusion rather than hallucination, see\nBurge (2003). This sort of state is relational, since you can\nbe in it only if the relevant object of perception is present in your\nscene. Assuming that each conscious success state has a counterpart in\nunconscious perception, notice that versions of these views might\nfocus on perceptual states in common between conscious subjects and\nsubjects without conscious perception. In principle, you might get perceptual justification from a success\nstate in the good case of vision or illusion, and get the same amount\nof perceptual justification from a non-success state in the bad case\nof hallucination (Lord forthcoming takes up a view with this structure\nregarding reasons for belief). We bracket that sort of approach\nhere. It is more common to hold that you get no perceptual\njustification in the case of hallucination (e.g., Jackson 2011), or at\nleast a lower degree or different kind of perceptual justification in\nthe case of hallucination (e.g., Schellenberg 2013). \n\nLet's group views that privilege success states under the label\n“Success Theory”, and leave open how to adjudicate within\nthe camp.  In support of Success Theory, one can emphasize the tight\nconnection the approach draws between perceptual justification and\ntruth.  Especially if you privilege seeing that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\) or seeing\n\\(a\\)'s \\(F\\)ness, the state that gives you justification to believe that\n\\(a\\) is \\(F\\) guarantees the truth of the belief that \\(a\\) is\n\\(F\\). Moreover, the source of your justification remains mental and\narguably accessible to you, thus satisfying the demands of some\n“internalist” approaches in epistemology that privilege\nwhat is inside the subject or accessible in a special way by the\nsubject (Prichard 2012).\n Moreover, Success Theory has a promising connection\nwith issues about skepticism. They promise to block skeptical\narguments that assume our evidence is the same between the good case\nof successful vision and the bad case of radical deception or\nhallucination (McDowell 1995, for a critique, see Wright 2004). As an objection to Success Theory, many bring in demands on\njustification that are not satisfied by the most versions of the\nview. For instance, consider the “internalist” thesis\nthat, if things seem the same to each of two people from the inside,\nthen those two people are equally justified in their beliefs.  More\nspecifically, if two people have the same conscious perspective on the\nworld, and the same stored beliefs, then they are the same with\nrespect to the degree of justification of their beliefs. This sort of\nthesis is often motivated by considering radically deceived\ncounterparts to us, and appealing to the intuition that such subjects\nand us are equally justified (Lehrer and Cohen 1983; Cohen\n1984; Wedgwood 2002; for dispute, see Sutton 2007 or Littlejohn 2012).  Now,\nif a version of Success Theory predicts that a subject in perceptual\nerror has less justification than a corresponding perceiver, that\nversion might be rejected on the basis of its conflict with the\ninternalist thesis. In response, one might attempt to explain away the intuition of\nequal justification as instead concerning equal blamelessness, or at\nany rate as being correct only if restricted to blamelessness (e.g.,\nWilliamson 2007). Internalist theorists often retort by distinguishing\nthe sort of blamelessness one finds in cases of cognitive delusion or\nbrainwashing, and the epistemic status of the victim of an evil demon\n(Pryor 2001). \n\nAlternatively, someone with a “disjunctive theory of perception” might insist that the radically deceived subject\ndoes not have the same conscious perspective on the world as the\nsuccessful perceiver (Fish 2013).\n On this line of thought, to have the\nconscious perspective of someone in a case of perceptual success, you\nneed to be in a case of perceptual success. Here the antecedent of the\ninternalist thesis is not satisfied in cases of radical deception. One\nchallenge here is that there are many ways to be deceived. For\nexample, when someone sees that a lemon is yellow, they might well\nlack a conscious counterpart who hallucinates, but they arguably still\nhave a conscious counterpart who sees a fake lemon that is yellow. If\nthe subject in a case of vision and the subject in a case of illusion\nare equally justified, that will be trouble for approaches that give\njustifying privilege to the states of seeing that \\(a\\) is \\(F\\) or seeing\n\\(a\\)'s \\(F\\)ness. Some philosophers might attack Success Theory on the grounds that\nit is too internalist rather than not internalist enough. According to\ntheorists such as Ginsborg 2006 or Roessler 2009, the justifiers of perceptual beliefs\nare best understood to be facts about the external world rather than\nfacts about perceivers' mind. Standard cases of perceptual justification are ones in which you\nattend to what you see, as when you attend to your mail and form a\njustified belief that you have mail. But are all cases of perceptual\njustification ones in which attention is involved?  According to\nthe Attention Needed view, only attentive experiences can\nprovide justification. According to the Attention Optional\nview, inattentive experiences can provide propositional\njustification. If you only experience what you attend to, as is maintained by\nphilosophers such as Prinz 2012, all cases of justification by\nexperience will trivially involve attention as well. Here we'll pursue\nthe issue on the assumption that we sometimes experience something we\ndo not attend to, as is held by theorists such as Searle 1992 and Mole\n2011. To make our discussion concrete, consider Simons and Chabris's\n(1999) famous “Selective Attention Test” on youtube (see the link\nin Other Internet Resources). When subjects were\nasked to count passes of basketballs—spoiler alert!—a fair\nnumber failed to notice a person in a gorilla suit who came into the\nscene. Given how hard it is to track the passes of basketballs, it is\nnatural to assume that the non-noticers were attending only to the\nbasketballs, and did not attend to the person in the gorilla suit. Now\nsuppose that some of non-noticers still did experience a person in a\ngorilla suit in the scene, as a person in a gorilla suit. According to\nthe Attention Needed view, their inattentive experience cannot provide\nthem with justification to believe that someone's there in a gorilla\nsuit. According to the Attention Optional view, their inattentive\nexperience might still provide them with justification to believe that\nsomeone's there in a gorilla suit. Both views have their attractions. Typically, if you look\ncarelessly at a scene, your experience will put you in a worse\nepistemic position if you look attentively at the scene. Perhaps at\nthe limit, if attention is gone but experience remains, experience no\nlonger provides justification. On the other hand, you can have evidence you don't notice you have,\nand this point might favor the Attention Optional view.  Consider\neveryday cases of “change blindness” discussed by Dretske\n2004. For example, your friend gets a haircut, and asks you “do\nI look different?” You are stumped. On Dretske's account, you\nmight still have a perfectly accurately experience of how his hair now\nlooks. Here your experience plausibly gives you justification to\nbelieve that your friend got a haircut (when combined with your\nbackground beliefs). You also fail to notice that your experience\ngives you justification to believe your friend got a haircut. If\nexperiences provide un-noticed evidence, such cases are arguably good\nprecedents for the sorts of cases allowed by the Attention Optional\nview. (For more striking cases of change blindness, see the link\nin Other Internet Resources.) For further discussion of the potential epistemic roles of\nattention, see Campbell 2002, 2011; Roessler 2011; Smithies 2011; Wu\n2014; and Silins and Siegel 2014. According to one empiricist tradition, experience functions as a\nmirror, reflecting what is before the subject, without any\nmanipulation by the subject's mind. Given that experience is supposed\nto not be influenced by one's theories or expectations, it is thereby\nsupposed to be in an optimal position to confirm or disconfirm\nhypotheses about the world. According to a wide range of philosophers\nand scientists, such a picture of the nature of experience is\nmistaken, putting limitations on the ability of experience to justify\nbelief. In the philosophy of science, the challenge has been put in\nterms of the “theory-dependence of observation”, and the\nimplications thereof. In more recent epistemology and philosophy of mind, the challenge has\nbeen put in terms of “cognitive penetration” or\n“top-down” effects and the implications thereof. To survey the debate, we'll start with the philosophy of mind by\nconsidering potential examples of the phenomenon, and we will then\nturn to questions in epistemology. One potential source of examples comes from ambiguous figures such\nas the Necker cube (Hanson 1958; Kuhn 1962; Churchland 1979,\n1988). Figure 4. Necker Cube[4] You can see this figure as a downward-tilted cube with the left\nface closest to you, or as an upward-tilted cube with the right face\nclosest to you. Critics dispute whether such examples support any\nthesis of theory-dependence of observation. An alternative\nresponse is that you experience the figure in different ways merely\nbecause you attend to different parts of the figure at different\ntimes. Here the difference in your experience is not explained by\ndifferences in what theory you hold (Fodor 1984). Theorists such as Hanson, Kuhn and Churchland also made much of\nwork by so-called “New Look” psychologists such as Bruner\nand Postman. Consider for instance Bruner and Postman's classic 1949\nexperiment involving anomalous playing cards. In this experiment,\nsubjects were briefly shown the following sort of card: Figure 5 What did you just see? When subjects were exposed to this sort of\ncard, many reported it to be a six of hearts. The card is actually a\nred six of spades.  One might claim that the card looked to you the way red sixes of\nhearts look to you. However, there is much skepticism about whether\nthere is an effect here on perceptual experience itself (Fodor 1983;\nPylyshyn 1999. Perhaps the card fails to look like a red six of hearts\nto you, and you simply jumped to the conclusion that it is a red six\nof hearts when you form your belief. The effect might merely have been\non beliefs formed on the basis of perceptual experience. The current debate about cognitive penetration is informed by more\nrecent experiments in psychology. For a case of a top-down effect in\nthe current literature, consider “memory color” in Hansen\net al.'s banana (2006). When subjects were asked to adjust an image of\na characteristically yellow object until it was achromatic, they\novercompensated by adjusting until the image was slightly\nbluish. Subjects did not overcompensate with objects that were not\ncharacteristically yellow. According to recent discussions\nMacpherson 2012, the type of case presented by Hansen et al. is\nmuch harder to explain away than those in the classic philosophy of\nscience literature. (For related examples, see Delk and Fillenbaum\n1965 or Olkkonen, Hansen, and Gegenfurtner 2008. For further\nphilosophical discussion, see Deroy 2013). Let us now turn to the epistemology of cases of cognitive\npenetration. It's not clear whether all cases of top-down effects are\nproblematic for perceptual justification. Consider the possibility of\ntop-down effects from expertise. For example, perhaps the expert\nradiologist sees more than the novice when looking at an x-ray, and\nperhaps the expert chess-player sees more than the novice when looking\nat a chessboard in mid-game (see the papers in Ericsson 2006 for\ndiscussion of such examples). Further, suppose that the expertise\nexamples are genuine cases of top-down influence. Here the expert is\npresumably at an epistemic advantage thanks to top-down effects, where\nher experience justifies her with respect to those contents that her\nexperience has thanks to her cognitive background (Siegel 2012). \nTo see why some cases of top-down effects might be epistemically\nproblematic, consider Siegel's (2012) hypothetical case of\n“Angry Looking Jack”. Suppose that Jill antecedently has\nan unjustified belief that Jack is angry at her. The next time she\nsees him, he does look angry to her—as a result of a top-down\neffect from her belief. In response to her experience, Jill then\nreaffirms her belief. Is she now justified in believing that Jack is\nangry at her? (Markie 2005 presents a related example of a gold\nprospector whose wishful thinking makes a nugget visually seem to be\ngold). You could appeal to an intuition that Jill is not justified by her\nexperience in believing that Jack is angry at her (Siegel 2012). But\nothers may not share the intuition. Pryor (2000) for instance\ndiscusses the apparent irrelevance of etiology to the justificatory\npower of experience, and would seem to lack an intuition that Jill is\nnot justified by her experience. Another strategy is to give a further argument that Jill is not\njustified by her experience in believing that Jack is angry at\nher. For arguments that appeal to an analogy with the unjustified\nformation of a belief on an unjustified belief, see McGrath (2013) and\nSiegel (2013). For an argument that appeals to an analogy with the\nunjustified formation of beliefs on the basis of emotion, see Vance\n(2014).","contact.mail":"nico.silins@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
