To the extent that he\nis remembered today by non-specialists in the history of\nnineteenth-century religious thought, it is mainly as the object of\nMarx’s criticism in his famous Theses on Feuerbach,\noriginally penned in 1845 and first published posthumously by\nFriedrich Engels as an appendix to his book, Ludwig Feuerbach and\nthe End of Classical German Philosophy (Engels 1888). Although\nnever without his admirers, who have included several leading\npopularizers of scientific materialism in the second half the\nnineteenth century (cf. Gregory 1977), not to mention the theologian,\nKarl Barth, Feuerbach’s public influence declined rapidly after\nthe failed revolution of 1848/49 (in approximately inverse proportion\nto the rising popularity of Schopenhauer). Renewed philosophical\nattention paid to him in the middle of the twentieth century is\nlargely attributable to the publication, beginning in the late 1920s,\nof Marx’s early philosophical manuscripts, including The\nGerman Ideology, which revealed the extent of Feuerbach’s\ninfluence on Marx and Engels during the period culminating in the\ncomposition of that historic work (1845–46). \n\n\nApart from this influence, and the continuing interest of his work as\na theorist of religion, Feuerbach’s importance for the history\nof modern philosophy is also due to the fact that the publication of\nThe Essence of Christianity in 1841 can be taken, as it was\nby Engels, to symbolically mark the end of the period of classical\nGerman philosophy that had begun sixty years earlier with the\nappearance of Kant’s Critique of Pure\nReason—though some might want to question the assumption\ninvolved in this way of putting things that classical German\nphilosophy culminated in the Hegelian system that Engels thought of\nFeuerbach as having overthrown. In any case, Feuerbach’s\nbiography and the trajectory of his thinking are both closely\nintertwined with political and intellectual developments in the period\nreferred to by historians as the Vormärz, which extends\nfrom\n 1830–1848.[1]\n Although he remained unable to bring to fruition the\n“philosophy of the future”, the aphoristically formulated\n“principles” of which he attempted to set out in 1843, the\nemphases in his later essays on corporeality, the senses, finitude,\ninter-subjectivity, and drive psychology introduced into the history\nof modern thought themes developed further by Marx, Nietzsche, Freud,\nMartin Buber, Karl Löwith, Maurice Merleu-Ponty and Alfred\nSchmidt, among others.\n\n\n\n\nLudwig was the third son of the distinguished jurist, Paul Johann\nAnselm Ritter von Feuerbach. His nephew, the neo-classical painter,\nAnselm Feuerbach, was the son of Ludwig’s older brother, also\ncalled Anselm, himself a classical archaeologist and aesthetician\n“in the spirit of Gotthold\nEphraim Lessing and\n Johann Joachim \n Winckelmann”.[2]\n Ludwig’s father, who studied philosophy and law at Jena in the\n1790s with the Kantians, Karl Reinhold and Gottlieb Hufeland,\nrespectively, belonged to a group of distinguished northern German\nscholars called to Bavaria during the period of administrative reform\nunder Maximilian Montgelas, and charged with the task of modernizing\nthe legal and educational institutions of what became in 1806 the\nmodern kingdom of Bavaria. Other members of this group of\nNordlichter or “northern lights” included F.I.\nNiethammer, F.H. Jacobi (the godfather of Ludwig’s younger\nbrother, Friedrich), and Friedrich Thiersch (the tutor of\nLudwig’s two oldest brothers, who has sometimes been called\n“the Humboldt of Bavaria”). P.J.A. Feuerbach was knighted\nin recognition of his achievement in modernizing the Bavarian penal\ncode, though his political influence was dramatically curtailed as a\nresult of outspoken national-liberal criticisms of Napoleon expressed\nin pamphlets he published in 1813 and 1814. \nRaised Protestant and religiously devout in his youth, Ludwig\nmatriculated in the theological faculty of the University of\nHeidelberg in 1823, where his father hoped he would come under the\ninfluence of the late rationalist theologian, H.E.G. Paulus. Ludwig\nwas won over instead by the speculative theologian, Karl Daub, who had\nbeen instrumental in bringing Hegel to Heidelberg for two years in\n1816, and was by this time one of the foremost theologians of the\nHegelian school. By 1824 Ludwig had secured his father’s\ngrudging permission to transfer to Berlin under the pretext of wanting\nto study with the theologians Friedrich Schleiermacher and August\nNeander, but in fact because of his growing infatuation with\nHegel’s philosophy. Feuerbach’s matriculation at Berlin\nwas delayed because of suspicions of his involvement in the\npolitically subversive student fraternity (Burschenschaft)\nmovement, in which two of his older brothers were active, as a result\nof which one of them (Karl, a talented mathematician) was imprisoned\nand subsequently attempted suicide. In 1825, to his father’s\nconsternation, Ludwig transferred to the philosophical faculty,\nthereafter hearing within a two-year period all of Hegel’s\nlectures except for those on aesthetics, repeating the lectures on\nlogic\n twice.[3] \nShortly after defending his Latin dissertation, De ratione, una,\nuniversali, infinita, at Erlangen in 1828 Feuerbach began to\nlecture on the history of modern philosophy at the conservative\nuniversity there, many of whose faculty were closely associated with\nthe neo-Pietist Awakening, and, in the case of Julius Friedrich Stahl,\nwho would go on to become a leading theorist of conservatism, also\nwith the so-called “positive philosophy” of the late\nSchelling. The scathingly satirical and even vulgar couplets\n(Xenien) directed against the Pietists that Feuerbach\nappended to his first book, Thoughts on Death and Immortality\n(1830, hereafter Thoughts; see\n Section 2\n below), which he published anonymously in 1830, effectively destroyed\nhis prospects for an academic career. \nDuring the 1830s Feuerbach published three books on the history of\nmodern philosophy, in addition to several essays and reviews. These\ninclude the History of Modern Philosophy from Bacon to\nSpinoza (1833), History of Modern Philosophy: Presentation,\nDevelopment, and Critique of the Leibnizian Philosophy (1837),\nand Pierre Bayle: A Contribution to the History of Philosophy and\nHumanity (1838), none of which have been translated into English.\nThe first of them won him the praise of Edward Gans and an invitation\nfrom Leopold von Henning to contribute reviews to the Annals for\nScientific Criticism, the principal journal of the Hegelian\nacademic establishment in Berlin. In these reviews Feuerbach defended\nthe Hegelian philosophy vigorously against critics such as Karl\nBachmann. Even after the publication of the works on Leibniz and\nBayle, however, he was refused an academic appointment. He was able\nfor several decades to sustain his existence as an independent scholar\nin the remote Frankish village of Bruckberg by virtue of his wife,\nBertha Löw, having been partial heir of a porcelain factory\nlocated there, from a modest pension due to his father’s service\nto Bavaria, and from publishing royalties.  \nThe event that precipitated the gradual dissolution of the Hegelian\nsynthesis of faith and knowledge that Marx and Engels later referred\nto sardonically as the “putrefaction of absolute spirit”\nwas the publication in two volumes in 1835–36 of D.F.\nStrauss’s Life of Jesus Critically Examined. Here\nStrauss used the tools of the “Higher Criticism” he had\nacquired from his Tübingen teacher, F.C. Baur, to reveal the\nhistorical unreliability of the accounts of the life of Jesus\npreserved in the canonical gospels, and interpreted the doctrine of\nthe incarnation of Christ as a mythological expression of the\nphilosophical truth of the identity of the divine spirit and the human\nspecies (conceived as the community of finite spirits existing\nthroughout history, and not as the historical individual, Jesus of\nNazareth). The appearance of Strauss’s book confirmed the\nsuspicions of theological conservatives like E.W. Hengstenberg and\nHeinrich Leo that Hegel’s philosophy, despite its use of\nChristian terminology, is incompatible with the historical faith, and\nthe editors of the Berlin Annals felt compelled to publicly discredit\nStrauss’s Hegelian credentials. It was in the wake of these\nevents that Arnold Ruge established the Halle Annals for German\nScience and Art, which served for several years as the principal\nliterary organ of the Young Hegelians, and to which Feuerbach began to\ncontribute essays and reviews in 1838, including in 1839 an essay\nentitled “Toward a Critique of the Hegelian Philosophy”,\nin which he first began to distance himself publicly from the Hegelian\ncause, calling for a “return to nature”—and to a\nnaturalistic explanation of the mysteries of Christianity, and of\nreligion more\n generally.[4] \nFeuerbach achieved the height of his brief literary fame with the\npublication in 1841 of The Essence of Christianity, which was\ntranslated into English by the novelist, Mary Anne Evans (a.k.a.\nGeorge Eliot), who also translated Strauss’s Life of\nJesus. Engels recalled the appearance of Feuerbach’s book\nas having a profoundly “liberating effect” on him and Marx\nby “breaking the spell” of the Hegelian system, and\nestablishing the truths that human consciousness is the only\nconsciousness or spirit that exists, and that it is dependent upon the\nphysical existence of human beings as part of nature (Engels 1888:\n12–13). In 1844 Marx wrote to Feuerbach, with reference to the\nlatter’s Principles of the Philosophy of the Future\n(1843; hereafter Principles) and The Essence of Faith\nAccording to Luther (1844), that in them he had, intentionally or\nnot, “given socialism a philosophical foundation”\n(GW v. 18, p. 376). In fact, Feuerbach was only then\nbeginning to acquaint himself with socialist ideas through his reading\nof authors like Lorenz von Stein and Wilhelm Weitling. In the end he\ndeclined Marx’s request for a contribution to the\nGerman-French Annals, as well as Ruge’s urging that he\nbecome more politically engaged. He did come out of rural seclusion to\nobserve fairly passively the ultimately disappointing events in\nFrankfurt in 1848, and to deliver a series of public lectures at\nHeidelberg beginning the same year. He unfortunately failed to develop\nwith much specificity or argumentative rigor the “philosophy of\nthe future” for which he himself called in the early 1840s,\ncontinuing instead to focus his attention mainly on religion in works\nlike The Essence of Religion (1845), Lectures on the\nEssence of Religion (1851), and Theogony According to the\nSources of Classical, Hebrew and Christian Antiquity (1857). The\nfive years of philological labor that Feuerbach invested in the latter\nwork, which he considered his crowning achievement, went largely\nunnoticed both by his contemporaries and by posterity. \nDuring the 1840s Feuerbach corresponded and occasionally visited and\nmaintained close personal relationships with several leading German\nradicals, including, in addition to Ruge and Marx, the publishers Otto\nLüning, Otto Wigand, and Julius Fröbel; the revolutionary\npoet, Georg Herwegh, and his wife, Emma; Hermann Kriege, a freelance\nactivist and early German socialist who emigrated to America; and\nscientific materialists like Jacob Moleschott and Carl Vogt. The\nimpression made by him on several leading lights of the younger\ngeneration is reflected in Gottfried Keller’s\nBildungsroman, Green Henry, first published in 1855,\nand in the dedication (to Feuerbach) of Richard Wagner’s early\nbook, The Art-Work of the Future (1850). \nPartly as the result of a global financial crisis, the porcelain\nfactory that had supported Feuerbach’s literary existence went\nbankrupt in 1859. The following year he and his wife and daughter were\nforced to relocate to the village of Rechenberg, located then on the\noutskirts of Nuremberg, where Feuerbach lived out the remainder of his\nlife under severely strained financial circumstances and in\nincreasingly ill health. Although his productivity as a writer\ndeclined sharply during this period, he was able to bring out in 1866\nthe tenth and final volume of his collected works (which had begun to\nappear in 1846), bearing the title God, Freedom and Immortality\nfrom the Standpoint of Anthropology, and including a fairly\nsubstantial, though fragmentary, essay “On Spiritualism and\nMaterialism, Especially in Relation to the Freedom of the Will”.\nIn this essay, and in an essay on ethics that Feuerbach left\nincomplete at his death, we find him beginning to sketch out a moral\npsychology and an eudaimonistic ethical theory in which the concept of\nthe “drive-to-happiness”\n(Glückseligkeitstrieb) plays a central role. \nIn an essay published in 1835 Heinrich Heine observed that pantheism\nhad by this time become “the secret religion of\nGermany”.[5] That Feuerbach is generally remembered as an\natheist and a materialist has tended to obscure the fact that he began\nhis philosophical career as an enthusiastic adherent of this\nphilosophical religion, one early expression of which can be found in\nthe Greek words “Hen kai Pan” (One and All)\ninscribed in 1791 by Hölderlin in Hegel’s student album\nfrom Tübingen (cf. Pinkard 2000:\n32).[6] This\ninscription is an allusion to words uttered by Lessing after reading\nGoethe’s poem-fragment, “Prometheus”, and responding\nenthusiastically by declaring himself a Spinozist, according to the\naccount contained in Jacobi’s famous Letters on the Doctrine\nof Spinoza (1785; cf. Jacobi [MPW]: 187). It was the publication\nof these letters that set off the original Pantheism Controversy, and\nhad the unintended effect of leading more than one generation of young\nGerman poets and thinkers to regard Spinoza no longer as a “dead\ndog” and a godless atheist, but rather as the God-intoxicated\nsage of a pantheistic creed in which those who, like Lessing, could no\nlonger “stomach” orthodox conceptions of the divinity that\nmake a strict distinction between creator and creation, could seek to\nsatisfy their spiritual aspirations. Feuerbach included several verses\nof the Prometheus-fragment as an epigram to his first book, in which\nhe used the tools of Hegelian logic to develop a view of the divinity\nas One and All along lines laid out by Spinoza, Giordano Bruno and\nJacob Boehme. These three he hailed as ‘pious God-inspired\nsages’ (GTU 241/48) who prepared the ‘feast\nreconciliation’ (GTU 463/214) between nature and spirit that it\nis that task of the modern age to celebrate. \nBut this reconciliation, he argued, cannot occur as long as God\ncontinues to be thought of as an individual person existing\nindependently of the world.  \nThat Feuerbach, unlike Strauss, never accepted Hegel’s\ncharacterization of Christianity as the consummate religion is clear\nfrom the contents of a letter he sent to Hegel along with his\ndissertation in\n 1828.[7]\n In this letter he identified the historical task remaining in the\nwake of Hegel’s philosophical achievement to be the\nestablishment of the “sole sovereignty of reason” in a\n“kingdom of the Idea” that would inaugurate a new\nspiritual dispensation. Foreshadowing arguments put forward in his\nfirst book, Feuerbach went on in this letter to emphasize the need for\n \nthe I, the self in general, which especially since the beginning of\nthe Christian era, has ruled the world and has thought of itself as\nthe only spirit that exists at all [to be] cast down from its royal\nthrone. (GW v. 17, Briefwechsel I (1817–1839),\n103–08)  \nThis, he proposed, would require prevailing ways of thinking about\ntime, death, this world and the beyond, individuality, personhood and\nGod to be radically transformed within and beyond the walls of\nacademia. \nFeuerbach made his first attempt to challenge prevailing ways of\nthinking about individuality in his inaugural dissertation, where he\npresented himself as a defender of speculative philosophy against\nthose critics who claim that human reason is restricted to certain\nlimits beyond which all inquiry is futile, and who accuse speculative\nphilosophers of having transgressed these. This criticism, he argued,\npresupposes a conception of reason is a cognitive faculty of the\nindividual thinking subject that is employed as an instrument for\napprehending truths. He aimed to show that this view of the nature of\nreason is mistaken, that reason is one and the same in all thinking\nsubjects, that it is universal and infinite, and that thinking\n(Denken) is not an activity performed by the individual, but\nrather by “the species” acting through the individual.\n“In thinking”, Feuerbach wrote, “I am bound together\nwith, or rather, I am one with—indeed, I myself am—all\nhuman beings” (GW I:18). \nIn the introduction to Thoughts Feuerbach assumes the role of\ndiagnostician of a spiritual malady by which he claims that modern\nmoral subjects are afflicted. This malady, to which he does not give a\nname, but which he might have called either individualism or egoism,\nhe takes to be the defining feature of the modern age insofar as this\nage conceives of “the single human individual for himself in his\nindividuality […] as divine and infinite” (GTU\n189/10). The principal symptom of this malady is the loss of\n“the perception [Anschauung] of the true totality, of\noneness and life in one unity” (GTU 264/66). This loss\nFeuerbach finds reflected in three general tendencies of the modern\nage: 1) the tendency to regard human history solely as the history of\nthe opinions and actions of individual human subjects, and not as the\nhistory of humanity conceived as a single collective agent, 2) the\ntendency to regard nature as a mere aggregate of “countless\nsingle stars, stones, plants, animals, elements and things”\n(GTU 195/14) whose relations to one another are entirely\nexternal and mechanical, rather than as an organic whole the internal\ndynamics of which are animated by a single all-encompassing vital\nprinciple, and 3) the tendency to conceive of God as a personal agent\nwhose inscrutable will, through which the world came into being from\nnothing and is continually directed, is unconstrained by rational\nnecessity. \nFeuerbach’s basic objection to the theistic conception of God\nand his relation to creation is that, on it, both are conceived as\nequally spiritless. Rather than consisting of lifeless matter to which\nmotion is first imparted by the purposeful action of an external\nagent, Feuerbach argues that nature contains within itself the\nprinciple of its own development. It exercises “unlimited\ncreative power” by ceaselessly dividing and distinguishing its\nindividual parts from one another. But the immeasurable multiplicity\nof systems within systems that results from this activity constitutes\na single organic totality.  \nNature is ground and principle of itself, or—what is the same\nthing, it exists out of necessity, out of the soul, the essence of\nGod, in which he is one with nature. (GTU 291/86)  \nGod, on this view, is not a skilled mechanic who acts upon the world,\nbut a prolific artist who lives in and through it. \nIn Thoughts Feuerbach further argues that the death of finite\nindividuals is not merely an empirical fact, but also an a\npriori truth that follows from a proper understanding of the\nrelations between the infinite and the finite, and between essence and\nexistence. Nature is the totality of finite individuals existing in\ndistinction from one another in time and space. Since to be a finite\nindividual is not to be any number of other individuals from which one\nis distinct, non-being is not only the condition of individuals before\nthey have begun to exist and after they have ceased to do so, but also\na condition in which they participate by being the determinate\nentities that they are. Thus, being and non-being, or life and death,\nare equally constitutive of the existence of finite entities\nthroughout the entire course of their generation and destruction. \nEverything that exists has an essence that is distinct from its\nexistence. Although individuals exist in time and space, their\nessences do not. Essence in general is timeless and unextended.\nFeuerbach nevertheless regards it as a kind of cognitive space in\nwhich individual essences are conceptually contained. Real or\nthree-dimensional space, within which individual things and people\nexist in distinction from one another and in temporal succession, he\nthinks of as essence “in the determination of its\nbeing-outside-of-itself” (GTU 250/55). In his\nbeing-one, Feuerbach argues, God is everything-as-one, and is, as\nsuch, the universal essence in which all finite essences are\n“grounded, contained and conceived [begriffen]”\n(GTU 241/48). \nIt is by means of Empfindung or sense experience that\nsentient beings are able to distinguish individuals from one another,\nincluding, in some instances, individuals that share the same essence.\nThe form of experience is temporality, which is to say that whatever\nis directly experienced occurs “now”, or at the moment in\ntime to which we refer as “the present”. Experience, in\nother words, is essentially fleeting and transitory, and its contents\nare incommunicable. What we experience are the perceivable features of\nindividual objects. It is through the act of thinking that we are able\nto identify those features through the possession of which different\nindividuals belong to the same species, with the other members of\nwhich they share these essential features in common.  \nUnlike sense experience, thought is essentially communicable. Thinking\nis not an activity performed by the individual person qua\nindividual. It is the activity of spirit, to which Hegel famously\nreferred in the Phenomenology as “‘I’ that\nis ‘We’ and ‘We’ that is\n‘I’” (Hegel [1807] 1977: 110). Pure spirit is\nnothing but this thinking activity, in which the individual thinker\nparticipates without himself (or herself) being the principal thinking\nagent. That thoughts present themselves to the consciousness of\nindividual thinking subjects in temporal succession is due, not to the\nnature of thought itself, but to the nature of individuality, and to\nthe fact that individual thinking subjects, while able to participate\nin the life of spirit, do not cease in doing so to exist as\ncorporeally distinct entities who remain part of nature, and are thus\nnot pure spirit. \nA biological species is both identical with and distinct from the\nindividual organisms that make it up. The species has no existence\napart form these individual organisms, and yet the perpetuation of the\nspecies involves the perpetual generation and destruction of the\nparticular individuals of which it is composed. Similarly,\nSpirit has no existence apart from the existence of individual\nself-conscious persons in whom Spirit becomes conscious of itself\n(i.e., constitutes itself as Spirit). Just as the life of a biological\nspecies only appears in the generation and destruction of individual\norganisms, so the life of Spirit involves the generation and\ndestruction of these individual persons. Viewed in this light, the\ndeath of the individual is necessitated by the life of infinite\nSpirit.  \nDeath is just the withdrawal and departure of your objectivity from\nyour subjectivity, which is eternally living activity and therefore\neverlasting and immortal. (GTU 323/111)  \nArguing thus, Feuerbach urged his readers to acknowledge and accept\nthe irreversibility of their individual mortality so that in doing so\nthey might come to an awareness of the immortality of their\nspecies-essence, and thus to knowledge of their true self, which is\nnot the individual person with whom they were accustomed to identify\nthemselves. They would then be in a position to recognize that, while\n“the shell of death is hard, its kernel is sweet”\n(GTU 205/20), and that the true belief in immortality is  \na belief in the infinity of Spirit and in the everlasting youth of\nhumanity, in the inexhaustible love and creative power of Spirit, in\nits eternally unfolding itself into new individuals out of the womb of\nits plenitude and granting new beings for the glorification,\nenjoyment, and contemplation of itself. (GTU 357/137) \nIn light of the emphasis placed in his later works on the practical\nexistential needs of the embodied individual subject, it should be\nnoted that during his early idealistic phase Feuerbach was strongly\ncommitted to a theoretical ideal of philosophy according to which\ncontemplation of and submersion in God is the highest ethical\nact of which human beings are capable. Whereas in his later works\nFeuerbach would seek to compel philosophy  \nto come down from its divine and self-sufficient blissfulness in\nthought and open its eyes to human misery, (GPZ\n264/3)  \nhere he spoke instead of  \nthe painful whimpering of the sick and the last moans of the dying as\nvictory songs of the species [in which it] celebrates its reality and\nvictorious lordship over the single phenomenon. (GTU 302/\n95) \nThe understanding of reason as one and universal embodied in the works\ndiscussed in the preceding section also informs the approach taken by\nFeuerbach to the history of philosophy in the three previously\nmentioned books and a series of lectures that he produced during the\n 1830s.[8]\n In his lectures on the history of modern philosophy Feuerbach\nemphasizes that philosophical reflection is an activity to which human\nbeings are driven. The history of the philosophical systems\nthat this activity has produced, he argues, is conceived only\nsubjectively and thus inadequately as long as it is regarded as the\nhistory of the opinions of individual thinkers. Because thinking is a\nspecies-activity the philosophical systems that have arisen in the\ncourse of the history of philosophy should be regarded as necessary\nstandpoints of reason itself. The Idea is not something first produced\nby philosophical reflection. Rather, the individual thinker, in the\nact of thinking, transcends his individuality and functions as an\ninstrument or organ through which the Idea actualizes one of its\nmoments, which is later reproduced in the consciousness of the\nhistorian of philosophy. The activity of the Idea is experienced\nsubjectively as inspiration (Begeisterung). In producing\nitself, the Idea does not pass from nonbeing into being, but rather\nfrom one state of being (being in itself) to another (being for\nitself). The Idea produces itself by determining itself, and human\nconsciousness is the medium of its self-actualization.  \nReason is nothing but the self-activity of the eternal,\ninfinite idea, whether in art or religion or philosophy, but this\nactivity is always the activity of the Idea in a particular\ndetermination and thus also at a particular time, for it\nis precisely according to the particular determinations of the idea\nthat enter successively into human consciousness that we differentiate\nthe periods and epochs of history. (VGP 11) \nThe emergence of new philosophical systems results on this view from a\nnecessity that is both internal and external. Certain philosophical\nideas are only capable of achieving historical expression under\nspecific historical conditions. Just as it was only possible for\nChristianity to appear at that point in history when the ties of\nfamily and nation in Greco-Roman antiquity were dissolved, so it was\nonly possible for modern philosophy to appear under specific\nhistorical conditions. The beginning of the history of modern\nphilosophy must be located at the point at which the modern spirit\nfirst begins to distinguish itself from the medieval spirit. The\ndominant principle of the medieval period was the Judeo-Christian,\nmonotheistic principle, according to which God is conceived as an\nomnipotent person through an act of whose will the material world was\ncreated from nothing (ex nihilo). It is because nature, as\nconceived from this standpoint, is excluded from the divine substance,\naccording to Feuerbach, that medieval thought showed no interest in\nthe investigation of nature. It is only where the substantiality of\nnature begins to be rediscovered that the spirit of modernity\ndistinguishes itself from the medieval spirit. This occurs most\nclearly where matter comes to be regarded as an attribute of the\ndivine substance, so that God is no longer conceived of as a being\ndistinct from nature but rather as the immutable and eternal imminent\ncause from which the plenitude of finite shapes in nature pours forth.\nThis happens first among the nature philosophers of the Italian\nRenaissance, and subsequently in the speculative reflections of Jakob\nBöhme and in the system of Spinoza. Indeed, it is one distinctive\nfeature of Feuerbach’s view of the history of modern philosophy\nthat he thinks of it as beginning, not with Descartes, but with the\nnature philosophers of the Italian Renaissance. Feuerbach insists upon\nthe speculative significance of Bacon’s philosophy of nature. It\nis precisely in subjecting nature to experimentation, and thereby to\nrational comprehension, that spirit raises itself above nature. But\nwhile Feuerbach emphasizes the philosophical importance of experience\nin the modern rediscovery of nature, he nevertheless insists that\nempiricism lacks a “principle” of its own. Later he will\nspeak of the need for an alliance between German metaphysics and\n“the anti-scholastic, sanguine principle of French\nsensualism and materialism” (VT\n254–255/165). \nFeuerbach’s conviction that Christian faith is inimical to\nreason and philosophy was strengthened by his own studies of the\nhistory of modern philosophy, especially his studies of Leibniz and\nBayle. His monographs on these figures were written during the period\nof controversy following the appearance of Strauss’s Life of\nJesus. Toward the end of the 1830s the Young Hegelians were\nincreasingly opposed on two fronts, by right-wing Hegelians such as\nFriedrich Göschel, who insisted upon the compatibility of\nHegelianism and Protestant orthodoxy, and by representatives of the\nso-called “Positive Philosophy”, who, taking their\ninspiration from the late Schelling, emphasized the personality of God\nas disclosed in the Christian revelation as the supreme metaphysical\nprinciple (cf. Breckman 1999 and Gooch 2011). It is in light of these\ndevelopments that, beginning in the Leibniz monograph, Feuerbach\nsought increasingly to distinguish from one another, and to\ndemonstrate the incompatibility of, what he refers to there as\n“the philosophical standpoint” and “the theological\nstandpoint”, respectively. Feuerbach regards the theological\nstandpoint as “practical” because it imagines God as a\nbeing separate from the world, upon which he acts according to\npurposes similar to those that guide the actions of human beings,\nrather than conceiving the world as a necessary, and hence rationally\nintelligible, consequence of the divine nature. To be sure, for\nLeibniz, there is nothing arbitrary about the divine will. God’s\nwill is determined by his infinite wisdom and goodness, which compel\nhim to choose to create the best possible world. But this attempt to\nsynthesize rational necessity and divine sovereignty remains in\nFeuerbach’s view an unacceptable compromise. Like Tycho Brahe,\nwho sought to combine the Ptolemaic and Copernican astronomies,\nLeibniz sought to reconcile the irreconcilable. In general, Feuerbach\nregarded Leibniz’s theory of monads as an original philosophical\nposition that offers a genuinely novel conception of substance, and an\nalternative to the mechanistic-mathematical Cartesian account of\nmotion, and thus constitutes an organic link in the developmental\nsequence of historical philosophical systems. Feuerbach criticized\nLeibniz, however, for not having derived the unity or harmony of the\nmonads from the nature of the monads themselves, and for appealing\ninstead to a theological representation of God as an alien, external\npower who achieves this harmonization miraculously, and hence,\ninexplicably.  \nAlthough, considered superficially, Feuerbach’s study of Bayle\nis a continuation of the line of inquiry pursued in his earlier\nhistorical monographs, closer inspection confirms Rawidowicz’s\nobservation that this book marks an important turning point in his\nintellectual development (Rawidowicz 1964: 62–62). The book is\nfull of digressions that go on for many pages without making any\nreference to Bayle, which can produce an impression that it lacks a\nclearly defined focus. In fact Feuerbach is here moving toward, and\nbuilding a case for, a claim that he articulates more explicitly in\nsucceeding years, namely, that the “practical negation” of\nChristianity is a fait accompli insofar as the scientific,\neconomic, aesthetic, ethical and political values and institutions\nthat are constitutive of modern European culture are incompatible with\nthe demands of authentic Christian faith as expressed in the Bible and\nin the writings of classical patristic and medieval authors, who are\neither indifferent or inimical to the scientific investigation of\nnature, the acquisition of wealth, the pursuit of artistic creativity\nas an end in itself, and attempts to establish ethical and political\nnorms on the basis of universally valid rational principles rather\nthan the authority of revelation or of the Church. \nAlthough the Protestant Reformation, in its rejection of clerical\ncelibacy, its affirmation of the vocation of the laity, and its\nseparation of temporal and spiritual authority, resolved the\ncontradiction between the spirit and the flesh that was characteristic\nof medieval Catholicism, Feuerbach argues, it failed to resolve the\ncontradiction between faith and reason, or theology and philosophy.\nBayle’s historical significance for Feuerbach consists in his\nuncompromising exposure of this contradiction, which, because it was\nso deeply rooted in Bayle’s own character, he himself could only\nresolve by embracing fideism. Feuerbach sought to further expose this\ncontraction in his 1839 essay, “On Philosophy and\nChristianity”, in which he for the first time publicly\nrepudiated the Hegelian claim that philosophy affirms in the form of\nconceptual thinking the same truths affirmed by religion in the form\nof sensible representations.  \nIn a section of the preface to the second edition of The Essence\nof Christianity (1843) that Eliot omitted from her translation,\nFeuerbach reveals that he had sought in this book to achieve two\nthings: First, to attack the Hegelian claim for the identity of\nreligious and philosophical truth by showing that Hegel succeeds in\nreconciling religion with philosophy only by robbing religion of its\nmost distinctive content. Second,  \nto place the so-called positive philosophy in a most fatal light by\nshowing that the original of its idolatrous image of God\n[Götzenbild] is man, that flesh and blood belong to\npersonality essentially. (WC 10–11)  \nAppreciation of each of these objectives requires further\nclarification of the historical context in which Feuerbach’s\nbook appeared, namely one year after the ascension to the Prussian\nthrone of the Romantic conservative, Friedrich Wilhelm IV, whose inner\ncircle of advisers consisted of devout aristocrats closely associated\nwith the neo-Pietist Awakening, who felt called to establish a\nGerman-Christian state as a bulwark against the influence of\nsubversive ideas on the continent. 1840 also saw the death of the\nPrussian minister of culture, Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein, who had\nbeen a supporter of the Hegelian cause, and a bearer of the hopes of\nthe Young Hegelians both for academic advancement and for a Prussian\nstate informed by a liberal Protestant ethos amenable to progress in\nthe arts and sciences. The wedge driven by the outcry surrounding the\nappearance of Strauss’s book between the right and left wings of\nthe Hegelian camp made this “center” position increasingly\nuntenable. The policies of Altenstein’s successor were aimed\ninstead at slaying the “dragonseed” of Hegelian pantheism\nin the universities under Prussian jurisdiction. \nBy the time Feuerbach published his most famous book, The Essence\nof Christianity (1841), in which he sought to develop “a\nphilosophy of positive religion or revelation” (WC 3),\nhe had begun to move away from his earlier idealistic pantheism. That\nhe nevertheless sought in this book to criticize both Hegelian\nspeculative theology and the positive philosophy from “the same\nstandpoint” taken by Spinoza in his Theologico-Political\nTreatise (VWR 16/9; cf. WC 10–11) has\noften been overlooked. At one point in the Treatise Spinoza\nobserves that the biblical authors  \nimagined God as ruler, legislator, king, merciful, just, etc., despite\nthe fact that all the latter are merely attributes of human nature and\nfar removed from the divine nature. (Spinoza [1677] 2007: 63)  \nIn Christianity Feuerbach makes a similar distinction between\nthe metaphysical and personal divine predicates. God considered as the\ntheoretical object of rational reflection, or “God as\nGod”, is a timeless and impassible entity that is unaffected by\nhuman suffering and ultimately indistinguishable from reason itself.\n \nThe consciousness of human nullity that is bound up with consciousness\nof this being is in no way a religious consciousness; it is much more\ncharacteristic of skeptics, materialists, naturalists and pantheists.\n(WC 89/44)  \nIt is God’s personal predicates that concern the religious\nbeliever, for whom God exists, not as an object of theoretical\ncontemplation, but of feeling, imagination, and prayerful\nsupplication. \nWhereas the metaphysical predicates, which “serve only as\nexternal points of support to religion” (WC 62/25), can\nbe thought of as ones that apply to the first person of the Trinity\n(i.e., God in his abstract universality), the second person of the\nTrinity, by virtue of his having subjected himself for the salvation\nof humanity to a humble birth and an ignominious death, “is the\nsole, true, first person in religion” (WC 106/51). The\ndoctrine of the Incarnation, Feuerbach argues against Hegel, is for\nthe Christian believer not a symbolic representation of the eternal\nprocession and return of infinite spirit into, and back from, its\nfinite manifestations, but rather “a tear of divine compassion\n[Mitleid]” (WC 102/50), and, as such, the act\nof a sacred heart that is able to sympathize with human suffering.\nThat God was compelled by his love for humanity to renounce his\ndivinity and become human Feuerbach takes as proof that “Man was\nalready in God, was already God himself, before God\nbecame man” (ibid.), i.e., that belief in divine compassion\ninvolves the attribution or projection onto God of a moral sentiment\nthat can only be experienced by a being capable of suffering, which\n“God as God” is not. \nThe Essence of Christianity is divided into two parts. In the\nfirst part Feuerbach considers religion “in its agreement with\nthe human essence” (WC 75), arguing that, when\npurportedly theological claims are understood in their proper sense,\nthey are recognized as expressing anthropological, rather than\ntheological, truths. That is, the predicates that religious believers\napply to God are predicates that properly apply to the human\nspecies-essence of which God is an imaginary representation. In the\nsecond part Feuerbach considers religion “in its contradiction\nwith the human essence” (WC 316), arguing that, when\ntheological claims are understood in the sense in which they are\nordinarily taken (i.e., as referring to a non-human divine person),\nthey are\n self-contradictory.[9]\n In early 1842 Feuerbach still preferred that his views be presented\nto the public under the label “anthropotheism” rather than\n“atheism” (GW v. 18, 164), emphasizing that his\noverriding purpose in negating “the false or theological essence\nof religion” had been to affirm its “true or\nanthropological essence”, i.e., the divinity of man. \nFeuerbach begins The Essence of Christianity by proposing\nthat, since human beings have religion and animals don’t, the\nkey to understanding religion must be directly related to whatever it\nis that most essentially distinguishes human beings from animals.\nThis, he maintains, is the distinctive kind of consciousness that is\ninvolved in the cognition of\n universals.[10]\n A being endowed with such “species-consciousness” is able\nto take its own essential nature as an object of thought. The capacity\nfor thought is conceived here as the capacity to engage in internal\ndialogue, and thus to be aware of oneself as containing both an I and\na Thou (a generic other), so that, in the act of thinking, the human\nindividual stands in a relation to his species in which non-human\nanimals, and human beings qua biological organisms, are\nincapable of standing. When a human being is conscious of himself as\nhuman, he is conscious of himself not only as a thinking being, but\nalso as a willing and a feeling being.  \nThe power of thinking is the light of knowledge [des\nErkenntnis], the power of the will is the energy of character,\nthe power of the heart is love. (WC 31/3)  \nThese are not powers that the individual has at his disposal. They are\nrather powers that manifest themselves psychologically in the form of\nnon-egoistic species-drives (Gattungstriebe) by which\nindividuals periodically find themselves overwhelmed, especially those\npoets and thinkers in whose works the species-essence is most clearly\ninstantiated.\n [11]\n Such manifestations include the experiences of erotic and platonic\nlove; the drive to knowledge; the experience of being moved by the\nemotion expressed in music; the voice of conscience, which compels us\nto moderate our desires to avoid infringing on the freedom of others;\ncompassion; admiration; and the urge to overcome our own moral and\nintellectual limitations. The latter urge, Feuerbach contends,\npresupposes an awareness that our individual limitations are\nnot limitations of the species-essence, which functions thus\nas the norm or ideal toward which the individual’s efforts at\nself-transcendence are directed. \nThe individual human being is limited both physically and morally. Our\nphysical existence is limited in time and space. We are also\nlimited—and often painfully aware of our being so—in our\nintellectual and moral capacities. But I only experience as a painful\nlimitation my inability to be and do things that others of my kind are\nable to be and to do, so that in recognizing my own limitations I\nsimultaneously recognize that they are not limitations of the species.\nIf they were, either I would not be aware of them at all, or I would\nnot experience my awareness of them as painful. For example, I only\nreprove myself for cowardice because I am aware of the bravery of\nothers, which I myself lack. I only reprove myself for my stinginess\nbecause of my awareness of the generosity of others, which I myself\nlack. The experience of conscience—taken in the broad sense as\nan awareness of one’s moral and intellectual shortcomings and\ninadequacies—presupposes species-consciousness in the form of an\nawareness of the qualities that one finds oneself lacking but can\nimagine oneself under other circumstances possessing. \nFeuerbach’s central claim in The Essence of\nChristianity is that religion is an alienated form of human\nself-consciousness insofar as it involves the relation of human beings\nto their own essence as though to a being distinct from themselves.\nAlthough, in developing this claim, Feuerbach was clearly influenced\nby Hegel’s account of Unhappy Consciousness in the\nPhenomenology, Ameriks’ contention that  \nFeuerbach’s philosophical doctrines […] can be understood\nas little more than a filling out of the details of Hegel’s\nscathing account of orthodox Christianity as a form of “unhappy\nconsciousness” (Ameriks 2000: 259)  \nis problematic for several reasons. First, it overlooks the likelihood\nof Hegel’s having understood his analysis of Unhappy\nConsciousness to apply to the otherworldliness he associated with\nmedieval Catholicism, or perhaps to otherworldly religion more\ngenerally, but not in any case to the type of Protestantism that he\nregarded as “the religion of the modern age” (Hegel [1807]\n1977: 14), and in which he found the sacred and the secular\nreconciled. Second, it overlooks the fact that Feuerbach’s\nappropriation of themes found in Hegel’s account of Unhappy\nConsciousness occurs in the context of an explicit, albeit incomplete,\nrepudiation of Hegel’s philosophy of spirit. Unlike Hegel, who\nconceives of Unhappy Consciousness as a moment in the development of\nhuman self-consciousness that is also a moment in the\ncoming-to-be-for-itself of the absolute, Feuerbach has by this time\nreached the conclusion that one cannot distinguish absolute spirit\nfrom “subjective spirit or the essence of man” without, in\nthe end, continuing to occupy “the old standpoint of\ntheology” (VT 246–247). Third, it overlooks the\nsignificance of Feuerbach’s emphasis on the importance for\ngrasping the essence of religion of precisely those subjective aspects\nof religious consciousness (imagination and feeling) that Hegel\nhimself regarded as inessential or of secondary importance. Finally,\nin connection with this third point, it overlooks the significance of\nFeuerbach’s agreement with Spinoza against Hegel that\n“faith […] requires not so much truth as piety”\n(Spinoza [1677] 2007: 184). \nIn a short essay published 1842, in which he sought to clarify the\ndifference between his own approach to the philosophy of religion and\nHegel’s, Feuerbach suggested that this difference is most\nevident in the relations in which each of them stands to\nSchleiermacher, who famously defined religion as the feeling of utter\ndependence. Whereas Hegel had “rebuked” Schleiermacher for\nabdicating the truth-claims of the Christian faith by taking the\narticles of faith as expressions of this feeling, Feuerbach says he\ndoes so only because Schleiermacher was prevented by his\n“theological prejudice” from drawing the unavoidable\nconclusion that, “if feeling is subjectively what religion is\nchiefly about, then God is objectively nothing but the essence of\nfeeling” (B 230). These comments fail to acknowledge\nthat, in The Essence of Christianity Feuerbach had conceived\nof God as an alienated projection of the human species-essence, which\nwas said to include not only feeling, but reason and will, as well.\nThey nevertheless reflect Feuerbach’s generally overlooked\ndeployment against Hegel of resources derived from the philosophies of\nfeeling of Schleiermacher and\n Jacobi,[12]\n and they indicate the direction in which his thinking about religion\ncontinued to move after the publication of The Essence of\nChristianity, namely, away from an emphasis on\nspecies-consciousness conceived along Hegelian lines, and toward what\nVan Harvey has aptly referred to as the\n“naturalist-existentialist” themes that predominate in his\nlater writings on religion (cf. Harvey 1995), which are discussed in\n Section 6\n below. \nIn notes for lectures on the history of modern philosophy that he\ndelivered in 1835/36, Feuerbach wrote that idealism is the “one\ntrue philosophy”, and that “what is not spirit is\nnothing” (VGP 139). Around the same time he\nvigorously defended the “absolute method” employed by\nHegel in his Logic against its critics (GW 8:73).\nFeuerbach himself referred to his early philosophical\n“standpoint” as “the standpoint of pantheistic\nidentity” (GW 10:291). His efforts to extricate himself\nfrom this standpoint were ongoing over the course of two decades,\nthough the extent to which they ultimately succeeded is debatable.\nWhereas the young Marx saw Feuerbach as “the true conqueror\nof the old philosophy”, the neo-Kantian historian\nof materialism, F.A. Lange, could find in his “new”\nphilosophy only another iteration of the philosophy of spirit,\n“which we encounter here in the form of a philosophy of\nsensuousness” that lacks materialistic bona fides (Marx 1844:\n80; Lange [1866] 1974: v. 2, 522). \nIn 1839, the same year that Feuerbach made his first public break with\nHegelianism in the essay, “Toward a Critique of the Hegelian\nPhilosophy”, he was still able to write that he missed in\nspeculative philosophy “the element of the empirical, and in\nempiricism the element of speculation”, and to describe his own\nmethod as an effort to conjoin both kinds of philosophical\n“activity” into a form of “skepticism or\ncritique just as much of the merely speculative as\nof the merely empirical” (GW 9:12). It was\nonly in 1842, between the time of the publication of the first (1841)\nand second (1843) editions of The Essence of Christianity\n(which happens also to have been a time of draconian censorship and\npolice surveillance) that Feuerbach became convinced of the need to\nmake a “radical break” with the speculative philosophical\n tradition.[13]\n This prompted him to report in the preface to the second edition of\nhis famous book that “the Idea” retained for him only a\npractical significance as “faith in the historical\nfuture”, and in the triumph of truth and virtue. In the realm of\ntheoretical philosophy proper he now considered himself, “in\ncomplete opposition to the Hegelian philosophy”, a realist and a\nmaterialist (WC 15).  \nIn two brief philosophical manifestos published in 1842 and 1843,\nrespectively, Feuerbach sought to “deduce”, through an\ninternal criticism of the “old” philosophy (culminating in\nthe Hegelian system), the “principles”\n(Grundsätze) that would lay the foundation for a\n“new”, naturalistic “philosophy of the\nfuture”. After the publication of these two manifestos, however,\nhe turned his attention back to religion, claiming in the foreword to\nthe first volume of his collected works (1846) that it was only in his\nbook on The Essence of Faith According to Luther (1844) that\nhe came to appreciate the “truth and essentiality of\nsensuousness [Sinnlichkeit]” (GW 10:187), and\nthereby to overcome the “contradiction” between\nspeculation and empiricism in which his position in The Essence of\nChristianity had remained mired. It is certainly the case that a\nnumber of concepts that are central to the philosophical anthropology\nwith which Feuerbach sought to replace the “old”\nphilosophy, including the effort to “naturalize freedom”\nundertaken in his final writings, were first introduced and developed\nin writings on religion published in the 1840s and 1850s. Because of\nthis it’s difficult to neatly separate a discussion of\nFeuerbach’s “new” philosophy from his later\ntheorizing about religion. Be that as it may, the first of these\ntopics will be explored in this section and the second in the\nsucceeding section. Feuerbach’s preliminary efforts in his last\nactive years to develop a drive psychology and to naturalize ethics\nwill be considered briefly in the final section. \nOne thing that distinguishes Feuerbach’s “new”\nphilosophy from other versions of modern empiricism and materialism is\nhis claim to have derived the “principles” of this\nphilosophy through a dialectical inversion of the Hegelian system. In\nthe “Theses” Feuerbach argues that, by\n“positing” the human essence “outside of man”\nin the ethereal realm of absolute spirit, the Hegelian philosophy\nperpetuates the theological alienation of human beings from their own\nessence, which he now explicitly equates with subjective spirit. The\nre-appropriation of this abstracted essence by finite, corporeal human\nsubjects cannot be achieved “positively” [auf positive\nWeg], but only through a “total negation” of the\nHegelian philosophy that will reveal once and for all the\nincarnational telos of the history of philosophy and humanity\n(VT 247). In this way, Feuerbach thinks, the hidden\n“truth of Christianity” (VT 263) will finally be\nrealized in the form of an atheistic humanism that renounces the\nfantastical consolations of religion in order to embrace the\nhistorical tasks of human self-realization and the creation of the\npolitical and cultural institutions that are conducive to it. \nIn 1846 Feuerbach published a number of “fragments” from\nhis unpublished papers intended to document the course of his\nphilosophical development. One of these fragments, entitled\n“Doubt”, and dated 1827–28 (which is the time when\nFeuerbach was writing his doctoral dissertation) seems already to\nanticipate Feuerbach’s later critique of Hegel. In this fragment\nwe find him questioning the transition from the first to the second\npart of Hegel’s tripartite philosophical system, i.e., the\ntransition from the logic to the philosophy of nature. The conceptual\nprocess traced by Hegel in the logic, whereby the categories of\nthought are successively deduced from one another, is driven by the\nnegativity of the logical determinations of each of these categories,\nuntil the process culminates in the absolute Idea. But what negativity\nremains within the absolute Idea to propel the transition from thought\nto being unless it is that the purportedly “absolute” Idea\nremains in some sense incomplete until it becomes incarnate in the\nrealm of the sensuous, i.e., nature. In that case, however, nature\nitself (as the realm of the sensuous) is the hidden truth of the\nIdea. \nThe claim for the identity of thought and being was the cornerstone of\nthe Hegelian philosophy in which Feuerbach finds the “old”\nphilosophy perfected, and one of the principal “theses” of\nthe new philosophy is its rejection of this claim. Feuerbach argues\nthat, because the concept of pure being with which Hegel begins the\nLogic is an abstraction, in the end Hegel succeeds only in\nreconciling thought with the thought of being, and not with being\nitself. The new philosophy affirms that being is distinct from, and\nprior to, thought, and that it is as various as is the panoply of\nindividually existing beings, from which it cannot be intelligibly\ndistinguished.  \nThought comes from being, but being does not come from thought.\n[…] The essence of being as being [i.e., in contrast\nto the mere thought of being] is the essence of nature.\n(VT 258/168)  \nTo say that something exists in actuality is to say that it exists not\nonly as a figment of someone’s imagination, or as a mere\ndetermination of their consciousness, but that it exists for itself\nindependently of consciousness. “Being is something in which not\nonly I but also others, above all also the object itself,\nparticipate” (GPZ 304/40). In affirming the distinction\nbetween thought and being, repudiating Hegel’s critique of sense\ncertainty, and affirming the claim that nature exists through itself,\nindependently of thought, the new philosophy also affirms the reality\nof time and space, insisting that real existence is finite,\ndeterminate, corporeal existence. Whereas in his lectures on logic and\nmetaphysics, and in his writings from the mid-1830’s, Feuerbach\nhad defended the Hegelian method of the logical Entwicklung\nor development of the various moments of the absolute Idea, he now\nargues that the concept of development entails temporality, so that a\nnon-temporal developmental process is a contradiction in terms. If\nspeculative philosophy is the philosophy of the infinite, the new\nphilosophy aims to disclose the truth of finitude by reversing the\npath taken by speculation from the infinite to the finite, and from\nthe indeterminate to the determinate (VT 249). \nAlthough, in the “Theses”, Feuerbach refers to\n“speculative philosophy” as having been inaugurated by\nSpinoza, restored by Schelling, and perfected by Hegel (VT\n243), in Principles he locates the origin of this tradition\nin the Cartesian philosophy, and specifically in “the\nabstraction from the sensuous [Sinnlichkeit], from\nmatter” (GPZ 275/ 13) through which the conception of\nthe cogito first arose. Much of the content of Principles\nconsists of a truncated survey of the history of modern philosophy,\nwhich purports to trace through a number of dialectical inversions a\nnecessary development from the rationalistic theism of Descartes and\nLeibniz through the pantheism of Spinoza to the idealism of Kant and\nFichte, culminating in Hegel’s philosophy of identity. What this\nsurvey is primarily intended to show is that the fundamental tendency\nof this development has been toward the actualization and humanization\nof God or, alternatively, toward  \nthe divinization of the real, of the materially\nexistent—of materialism, empiricism, realism,\nhumanism—[and] the negation of theology. (GPZ 285/ 22)\n \nThis survey is followed by a short “demonstration” of the\nhistorical necessity of the new philosophy, which takes the form of a\ncritique of Hegel, and by the enumeration of several doctrines that\ndistinguish the new philosophy from the old. \nWhereas earlier rationalists had conceived of God as being entirely\ndistinct from nature and possessing perfect knowledge untainted by\nmateriality, and had furthermore “placed the effort and labor of\nabstraction and of self-liberation from the sensuous only in\nthemselves”, Feuerbach notes that Hegel was the first to\ntransform “this subjective activity into the self-activity of\nthe divine being”, so that, like the heroes of pagan antiquity,\nGod (or the Idea) must “fight through virtue for his\ndivinity”, and only comes to be for himself (or itself) at the\nend of a long and laborious process (GPZ 296/32). This\nprocess, as it is described by Hegel at the end of the Science of\nLogic, involves the logical Idea  \nfreely releas[ing] itself … [into] the externality\nof space and time existing absolutely on its own without the\nmoment of subjectivity. (Hegel [1812–1816] 1969: 843)  \nWhat Feuerbach refers to as “the liberation of the absolute from\nmatter” is achieved as spirit gradually distinguishes itself\nfrom nature before attaining to the awareness of itself as absolute.\nHere, Feuerbach notes, “matter is indeed posited in God, that\nis, it is posited as God”, and to posit matter as God is to\naffirm atheism and materialism, but insofar as the\nself-externalization of the Idea in nature is superseded in the course\nof the coming-to-be-for-itself of the Idea in the forms of subjective,\nobjective and absolute spirit, this negation of “theology”\n(i.e., of God conceived as an immaterial being distinct from nature)\nis negated in turn. Hegel’s philosophy thus represents, for\nFeuerbach,  \nthe last magnificent attempt to restore Christianity, which was lost\nand wrecked, through philosophy … by identifying it with the\nnegation of Christianity. (GPZ 297/34)  \nThe old philosophy conceived of the cogito as “an abstract and\nmerely a thinking being to whose essence the body does not\nbelong” (GPZ 319–320/ 54). The new philosophy, by\ncontrast, affirms that, as a thinking subject, “I am a real,\nsensuous being and, indeed, the body in its totality is my ego, my\nessence itself” (ibid.). Although it remains unclear just what\nFeuerbach could mean in claiming that “the body in its totality\nis my ego”, elsewhere he says that to affirm that the ego is\ncorporeal “has no other meaning than that the ego is not only\nactive but also passive … [and that] the passivity of the ego\nis the activity of the object” in such a way that “the\nobject belongs to the innermost being of the ego” (AP\n150/142). Object and ego are, to use a Heideggerian term,\ngleichursprunglich or “equiprimordial”.  \nIt is through the body that the ego is not just an ego but also an\nobject. To be embodied is to be in the world; it means to have so many\nsenses, i.e., so many pores and naked surfaces. The body is nothing\nbut the porous ego. (AP 151/143)  \nIf philosophical thought is to avoid remaining “a prisoner of\nthe ego”, Feuerbach insists, it “must begin with its\nantithesis, with its alter ego” (AP\n146/138). The antithesis of thought is sensation. Whereas in thinking\nit is the object that is determined by the thinking activity of the\nsubject, in sense experience, he maintains, without much argument and\nwith apparently little concern for the epistemological problems that\npreoccupied the British empiricists and Kant, the consciousness of the\nsubject is determined by the activity of the object, which functions\nthus as a subject in its own right. What makes it possible for the ego\nto posit the object is only that, in positing the object as something\ndistinct from itself, the ego is at the same time posited by the\nobject. If, however, the  \nthe object is not only something posited, but also (to continue in\nthis abstract language) something which itself posits, then it is\nclear that the presuppositionless ego, which excludes the object from\nitself and negates it, is only a presupposition of the subjective ego\nagainst which the object must protest. (AP 147/ 139)  \nIt is not to the I, but to the not-I within the I, that real, sensuous\nobjects are given. Memory is what first enables us to transform\nobjects of sense experience into objects of thought, so that what is\nno longer present to the senses can nevertheless be present to\nconsciousness. In doing so it allows us to transcend the limitations\nof time and space in thought, and to construct from a multitude of\ndistinct sense experiences a conception of the universe as a whole,\nand of our relations to the various other beings that exist in it.\nFeuerbach continues to affirm that, unlike the animals,\n“man” is a universal, cosmopolitan being, but he now\nmaintains that we need not ascribe to human beings any unique\nsupersensible faculty in order to affirm this truth, since  \nwherever a sense is elevated above the limits of particularity and its\nbondage to needs, it is elevated to an independent and theoretical\nsignificance and dignity; universal sense is intelligence\n[Verstand]; universal sensibility, mentality\n[Geistigkeit]. (GPZ 336/69)  \nWhat distinguishes humans from the animals is not their possession of\nnon-natural powers either of reason or volition, but the fact that\nhuman beings are “absolute sensualists” whose powers of\nobservation and recollection extend to the whole of nature. \nAlthough Feuerbach is most often associated with the slogan underlying\nThe Essence of Christianity, according to which\n“theology is anthropology” (insofar as the predicates\nattributed by Christians to God are in fact predicates of the human\nspecies-essence), in a number of works on religion published in the\n1840s and 1850s Feuerbach advanced explanations of the origin of\nreligious concepts and beliefs that are strikingly different from, and\napparently at odds with, the more familiar position put forward in\nthat book. The primary works in which Feuerbach advanced these new\ntheoretical proposals are the previously referenced Luther book\n(1844), a short book entitled The Essence of Religion (1846),\nthe essay, “Belief in Immortality from the Standpoint of\nAnthropology” (1847), the Lectures on the Essence of\nReligion originally delivered in 1848–9, but first\npublished in 1851 (hereafter Lectures), and the\nTheogony (1857). The question of the relationship between the\naccount of religion contained in The Essence of Christianity\nand the views put forward in these later writings is a complex one,\nthe most penetrating analysis of which is to be found in Harvey\n(1995). Here Harvey identifies five distinct “explanatory\nprinciples” employed by Feuerbach in The Essence of\nChristianity, among which he distinguishes those that are\nconceived along Hegelian lines from those that tend instead toward the\n“existentialist-naturalist” themes which predominate in\nFeuerbach’s later writings on religion (Harvey 1995:\n68–69). Harvey’s thesis is that, in those later writings,\nFeuerbach in fact develops a new, bipolar model of religion that is\nboth incompatible with, and more compelling than, the earlier one,\nwhich relied too heavily on abstract Hegelian conceptions that are no\nlonger viable. Whereas, in The Essence of Christianity, the\nemphasis was on God as an alienated projection of the human\nspecies-essence, and on the infinity and perfection of the species,\nthe new bipolar model sees religion as meeting deep-seated\npsychological needs resulting from the contingency and precariousness\nof the finite, embodied existence of individual human subjects seeking\nto preserve themselves and expand their natural powers. \nIn a previously cited essay published in 1842, which was intended to\nclarify the differences between Hegel’s philosophy of religion\nand his own, Feuerbach referred readers seeking to evaluate his\nargument in The Essence of Christianity to his\n“Critique of the So-Called Positive Philosophy”, published\nin the Halle Annals in December, 1838 (B 235). It\nwas there that Feuerbach first put forward the claim that all the\n“determinations” (Bestimmungen) ascribed by the\npositive philosophy to God are determinations either of “the\nessence of nature” or of “the essence of man”\n(KPP 204). This claim is consistent with subsequent\nstatements of Feuerbach’s, including his observation in the\nPrinciples that “God, in the theological sense, is God\nonly as long as he is conceived as a being distinguished from the\nbeing of man and nature” (GPZ 280/19). Here the\nimplication seems to be that, if it can be shown that attributes\nascribed by theists to God are attributes derived either from human\nconsciousness or from nature, then it will have been shown that God\nhas no existence apart from the existence of human consciousness and\nof nature. Thus, even if it is true, as Harvey is probably correct to\nargue, that the bipolar model of religion found in the later writings\ndoes not merely supplement, but replaces, the position taken by\nFeuerbach in The Essence of Christianity, these two distinct\nexplanatory enterprises can nevertheless be understood as alternative\nstrategies for making good on Feuerbach’s original claim that\nthe predicates of divinity can be reduced to predicates derived either\nfrom the essence of nature or from the human essence. Also, while\nHarvey is correct to point out that the human species-essence is\nrarely mentioned in Feuerbach’s later writings, by 1851\nFeuerbach had still not abandoned the claim that God conceived as a\npersonal being distinct from nature “is nothing other than the\ndeified and objectified spiritual essence of man” (VWR\n28/21). \nAs Rawidowicz (1964: 113) and Ascheri (1964: 62) have both observed,\nthe break with the speculative tradition that Feuerbach signaled in\nthe “Preliminary Theses” and in Principles\ncorresponds to a notable change in his stance toward religion, if not\nin his estimation of the truth-value of traditional doctrinal claims.\nIn his polemical essays of the late 1830s, and in The Essence of\nChristianity, Feuerbach had unfavorably contrasted the\n“egoistic”, practical standpoint of religion, which he\nassociated with the unrestricted subjectivity of feeling\n(Gemüt) and imagination (Phantasie), with the\nimpartial, theoretical standpoint of philosophy, which he associated\nwith reason and objectivity. At the end of Principles,\nhowever, he informs his readers that the new philosophy, without\nceasing to be theoretical, nevertheless has a fundamentally practical\ntendency, and that in this respect it “assumes the place of\nreligion” and “is in truth itself religion”\n(GPZ 341/73). This line of thought is developed somewhat\nfurther in an unpublished manuscript where Feuerbach observes that, in\norder to replace religion, philosophy must itself become religion in\nthe sense that “it must, in a way suited to its own nature,\nincorporate the essence of religion or the advantage that religion\npossesses over philosophy” (NV 123/148). Here Feuerbach\ndoes not tell his readers what this advantage is, but in the\nLectures he claims that the difference between philosophy and\nreligion can be reduced to “the simple statement that religion\nis sensuous and aesthetic, while philosophy is nonsensuous and\nabstract” (VWR 20/13). Religion’s\n“advantage” over the old philosophy, then, is presumably\nit’s implicit acknowledgment of the “truth and\nessentiality of sensuousness” and of human finitude, which it is\nthe task of the new philosophy to articulate explicitly. \nWhen Feuerbach’s Luther book was first published in 1844,\nits subtitle suggested that it was conceived of as an addendum\nto The Essence of Christianity. Because, in the first edition\nof that book, Feuerbach had relied heavily on quotations from\npatristic and medieval works to substantiate his claims, some\ntheological critics had retorted that, while Feuerbach’s account\nof Christianity might apply to Catholicism, it did not apply to\nProtestantism. It was in responding to these critics that Feuerbach\nturned his attention to Luther, and, in doing so, introduced a number\nof concepts and themes that had not figured prominently in The\nEssence of Christianity, but which he continued to develop in his\nlater writings, including both those devoted to religion, as well as\nthose devoted to other topics. Foremost among these concepts and\nthemes are Seligkeit or blessedness and the\nGlückseligkeitstrieb or drive-to-happiness; “human\negoism” or human self-love; the feeling of dependence on nature;\nand the powerful, theogonic (i.e., god-originating) wish to be free\nfrom the limitations of nature by which the human drive-to-happiness\nis restricted.  \nFeuerbach begins the Luther book by conceding that no doctrine would\nseem more clearly to contradict the central claim advanced in The\nEssence of Christianity, namely, that Christians worship the\nhuman species-essence, than does Luther’s doctrine, which is the\nepitome of human self-abnegation insofar as it emphasizes the\ndepravity and contemptibleness of human nature in contrast to the\nperfection of the divine nature. This appearance, however, is\ndeceptive; for, while it’s true that whatever Luther takes from\nhuman beings he gives to God, since all that belongs to God belongs to\nChrist, and all that belongs to Christ belongs to the Christian, it is\nonly on the surface that Luther’s doctrine is dehumanizing.\nWhereas, in The Essence of Christianity, he had contrasted\nthe egoism and intolerance of faith (which he associated with the\nfalse, theological essence of religion) with the altruism and\nuniversality love (which he associated with the true, human essence of\nreligion), in the Luther book Feuerbach emphasizes that Christian\nfaith is faith in a God who is love, but the principal object of whose\nlove is humanity, so that this faith turns out to be an indirect form\nof human self-love or self-affirmation. The Christian believer affirms\nthe existence of, as well as his or her confidence in, the goodness of\nGod, who has promised him or her blessedness or freedom from the\npainful limitations of mortality. It is only because the Christian\nbeliever “completes and satisfies himself in God”\n(WGL 363/46) that God has everything that human beings lack.\nLuther, with his emphasis on God’s being pro nobis or\n“for us”, was “the first to let out the secret of\nthe Christian faith” (WGL 366/50), which is, at bottom,\nthe assurance  \nthat God is by his very nature concerned with man, […] that God\nis a being not for himself or against us, but rather for us, a good\nbeing, good to us men. (WGL 366–67/51)  \nFrom this recognition Feuerbach goes on to develop an analysis of the\ndivine attributes, which he interprets in this context as “means\nto the end of benevolence” (WGL 368/52). Here, and in\nFeuerbach’s later writings, the concepts of blessedness and the\ndrive-to-blessedness seem to play a role analogous to the one played\nby the concept of the species-essence in The Essence of\nChristianity. Whereas, in the latter work, divine attributes such\nas omniscience and perfection were said to be attributes of the human\nspecies-essence, in the section on Seligkeit toward the end\nof the Theogony, where Feuerbach develops a line of thought\nfirst introduced in the Luther book, many of these same attributes are\nsaid to characterize the state of blessedness itself. “God is\nonly the foreword, blessedness the text of Christianity. Or: The\nmystery of divinity is first unveiled and revealed in the gospel of\nblessedness” (T 308). The thesis here is that the\nattributes of the Christian God are determined by the most fundamental\nwishes of the Christian believer. For example, God qua\ncreator is first and foremost omnipotent, but omnipotence is ascribed\nto God only because God must be omnipotent in order to be able to\nexercise his benevolence toward believers by supplying them with what\nthey lack, including eternal life. There is no lack that cannot be\nsatisfied, and no ultimate harm that can befall, the person who is the\nobject of the benevolence of an omnipotent being. On this account, the\ndivine attributes are determined by human needs, and these are\ndetermined in turn by the psychophysical constitution of humans as\nbeings who find themselves constrained by natural limitations from\nwhich they have an urgent wish to be liberated. Belief in divine\nomnipotence is motivated not by any specific wish, however, but rather\nby “the unspecific over-all wish that there be in general no\nnatural necessity; no limitations, no opposition to the human being\nand to human wishes” (WGL 372/59). \nFeuerbach, whose understanding of Seligkeit or blessedness\nseems to have been heavily influenced by Augustine’s account of\nfelicitas in The City of God, defines blessedness at\none point as freedom from sin, sensual drives, “the oppression\nof matter”, death, and the limitations of nature in general\n(WGL 403/103). Whereas the God of Christianity had previously\nbeen identified by Feuerbach as an alienated projection of the human\nspecies-essence, here God is defined instead as the realized\ndrive-to-happiness of the Christian believer. To say that belief in\nGod is motivated or caused by the human drive-to-happiness is not\nnecessarily to deny that attributes ascribed to God are attributes\nderived from human nature, but it is in any case to affirm that the\nascription to God of the perfections of the human species-essence\nserves an underlying psychological need that is itself determined by\nthe dependence of human beings upon nature, and their awareness of\nthis dependence in the form of powerful hopes and fears that give rise\nto belief in supernatural agencies. \nTwo years after the publication of the Luther book Feuerbach published\nanother short book entitled The Essence of Religion, the core\nideas in which are further developed in the Lectures, where\nFeuerbach explains that, because Christians themselves do not worship\nsuch things as the sun and the moon, but instead worship “will,\nintelligence, consciousness as divine beings and powers”\n(VWR 27/20), he himself had “disregarded nature”\nin his account of Christianity (VWR, 26/19). This had given\nrise to certain unspecified but “preposterous”\nmisunderstandings, which he sought to correct by augmenting the slogan\nencapsulating his doctrine from “theology is anthropology”\nto “theology is anthropology ‘and\nphysiology’” (VWR 28/21). This modification\nreflects a new emphasis in Feuerbach’s later writings on the\nontological dependence of human consciousness upon the physical human\norganism, which itself exists only in relation to the natural order of\nwhich it is a part—a relation mediated, or, to be more precise,\nrevealed, by the senses. \nThe Essence of Religion begins with the striking claims 1)\nthat the feeling of dependence is the “ground” of\nreligion, and 2) that the original object of this feeling, i.e., in\nthe history of religion, is nature. Feuerbach defines the feeling of\ndependence as  \nthe feeling or consciousness of man that he does not and cannot exist\napart from a being that is distinct from himself, that he does not\nhave himself to thank for his own existence. (WR 4)  \nThis feeling can manifest itself negatively as fear, which Feuerbach\nrefers to at one point as “a feeling of dependency on an object\nwithout which I am nothing, which has the power to destroy me”\n(VWR 39/31), but it can also manifest itself in the form of\ncelebratory joy and exaltation. Feuerbach finds both of these powerful\nemotions expressed in the act of sacrificial offering, which he takes\nto be the most characteristic act of nature religions (as opposed,\npresumably, to prayer as the characteristic act of\n“spiritual”, i.e., monotheistic, religion). In addition to\nfilling a “gap” in the argument put forward in The\nEssence of Christianity by emphasizing the dependence of\n“the human essence” upon “the essence of\nnature”, Feuerbach also sought in The Essence of\nReligion to identify features shared in common by what he calls\n“nature religions”, on the one hand, and\n“spiritual” religions like Christianity, on the other, and\nto clarify the relationship between these two kinds of religion.\nFeuerbach uses the term “nature religion” to refer both\nthe pagan religions of classical antiquity, and the religions of\nvarious tribal peoples whose beliefs and practices were described for\nFeuerbach and his contemporaries by European travelers in journals\nsuch as Das Ausland, from which Feuerbach derived a number of\nthe examples to which he refers in this book (cf. Tomasoni 1990:\n10–11, 127–135).  \nWhile the feeling of dependence is the ground of religion, what the\nact of sacrifice aims at or seeks to achieve is freedom from the\nrestrictions of nature, or, alternatively, human independence. If\nblessedness is the condition of not being restricted by the\nlimitations imposed by nature on all finite, corporeal individuals\nsubject to generation and corruption, then human blessedness can be\nregarded as the final goal (Endzweck) of religion\n(WR 34). The gods are the objects of worship and the\nrecipients of sacrifice because they are the benefactors of human\nbeings in the specific sense that they are imagined to have it in\ntheir power to satisfy fundamental human wishes, including the wish\nnot to die. “Only a being who loves man and desires his\nhappiness [Seligkeit] is an object of human worship, of\nreligion” (VWR 71/60). The sacrificial act is motivated\nby the experience of need (Bedürfnis), which involves\nthe simultaneous awareness both of one’s “non-being apart\nfrom nature”, and of one’s existence as a self-conscious\nbeing distinct from nature (WR 32). In the Lectures\nFeuerbach claims that the feeling of dependence on nature is the only\n“truly universal” designation for the “psychological\nor subjective ground of religion” (VWR 39/31). This\ncontinues to be the case even after nature has ceased to be the locus\nof divinity, and the origin of the visible world is sought in the will\nof a transcendent creator who brought forth the world into being from\nnothing, and who is solely responsible for occurrences attributed by\npolytheists to a multitude of divine agencies. The objective correlate\nof the feeling of dependence, in the case of both polytheism and\nmonotheism, is the really existing things and people who are the\nobjects of various human needs, physical and psychological—needs\nwhich Feuerbach implicitly recognizes, especially in the\nTheogony, to be culturally determined. \nFeuerbach’s description of the feeling of dependence as\ninvolving the awareness  \nthat I am nothing without a not-I which is distinct from me\nyet intimately related to me, something other, which is at\nthe same time my own being (VWR 350/311)  \nreflects his understanding of nature as the totality of “the\nbeings [Wesen], things, [and] objects that man distinguishes\nfrom himself and his products” (WR 4). Nature, in other\nwords, is the non-human world, devoid of consciousness, will and\nsentiment. It includes such things as light, electricity, air, water,\nearth, and the plants and animals upon which the existence of human\nbeings depends, but it also includes the human organism itself insofar\nas the effects produced by it are produced unconsciously and\ninvoluntary. Nature is the “cause and ground of man”; in\nhuman beings nature “becomes a personal, conscious, intelligent\n(verständiges) being” (VWR 29/21). To say\nthat human beings are dependent upon nature is to say, among other\nthings, that nature, which is devoid of consciousness and intention,\nis what has caused human beings to exist, and that the same physical\nprocesses that have produced the human brain have also produced human\nconsciousness. While all organisms are dependent upon nature for their\nexistence, human beings are distinguished from other organisms by the\nextent of their conscious awareness of this dependence, which\nFeuerbach finds expressed in the earliest forms of cultic activity,\nincluding the earliest forms of nature religion focused, for example,\non the changes of the seasons, and in the offering of sacrifice to\ndivine beings associated with various aspects of the natural world.\nAlthough nature is the original object of religion, this goes\nunrecognized initially because human beings do not at first\ndistinguish themselves from nature or vice versa. The forces of nature\nare instead personified, and naturally occurring events are attributed\nto the human-like motivations of spirits and gods. Religion, according\nto Feuerbach, exhibits the following contradiction: When it conceives\nof itself theistically, it mistakenly thinks of God as a thoroughly\nnon-human being (i.e., one whose existence and attributes in no way\ndepends on the existence and attributes of human beings), and when in\nconceives of itself as nature religion, it mistakenly attributes\nconsciousness and will to what is in fact entirely non-human. \nFurther analysis of the feeling of the dependence leads Feuerbach to\nconclude that this feeling itself presupposes “egoism as the\nultimate hidden ground of religion” (VWR\n91–92/79). Here he reasons that, if human beings were not\nsubject to powerful psychological drives which compel them to expand\nand develop their natural powers, including most fundamentally the\ndrive-to-self-preservation, they would not experience the limitations\nimposed upon them by nature as painful and restricting.\n“Life is egoism” (EEWR 82)\ninsofar as the fundamental drive of all living things, including the\nhuman organism, is the drive to self-preservation\n(Selbsterhaltungstrieb). Nevertheless, what Feuerbach calls\n“human egoism” doesn’t seem to be the same thing\neither as psychological egoism (the claim that everyone always acts\nfrom self-interest) or ethical egoism (the claim that\n“good” is whatever serves my own interests). Feuerbach\nwrites that, by “human egoism” he means  \nman’s love for himself, that is, love of the human essence, the\nlove that spurs him on to satisfy and develop all the impulses and\ntendencies without whose satisfaction and development he neither is\nnor can be a true, complete human being. (VWR 60–61/50)\n \nThis type of self-love, which warrants comparison with, but is not the\nsame as, Rousseau’s amour de soi, encompasses love of\none’s fellow human beings, apart from whom one cannot either\ncultivate or satisfy the ethical, intellectual and aesthetic impulses\nand capacities in which one’s essential humanity consists, and\nto whose well-being one’s own is thus inextricably linked.  \nFeuerbach’s book, Theogony according to the Sources of\nClassical, Hebrew and Christian Antiquity (1857), is the product\nof six years of close engagement with Hebrew, Greek, and Latin texts\nfrom antiquity, and exemplifies the vastness of Feuerbach’s\nhumanistic erudition. Feuerbach considered it his “simplest,\nmost complete, mature work” (GW 20: 292). It may not be\na mere coincidence that the period of Feuerbach’s engagement in\nthese philological labors was the same period when one of his closest\ncorrespondents was Emil Ernst Gottfried von Herder, the son of Johann\nGottfried von Herder, whose introduction to the study of theology\nFeuerbach had read as a young man while he himself was learning Hebrew\ngrammar in preparation for his matriculation in the theological\nfaculty at the University of Heidelberg. Like the older Herder, who\nconceived of the poetry of the Hebrew Bible as a product of the genius\nof humanity in its childhood, Feuerbach turned to the Iliad and the\nOdyssey, which he thought of as the Urstätten or\n“original sites” of anthropology, and to the Hebrew\nscriptures, for clues to the origins of belief in the gods and in God.\nLarge portions of the book consist either of 1) careful philological\nanalyses of individual passages selected, for example, from the Iliad\nor the Odyssey, or from the creation accounts in Genesis, or else of a\nverse from Pindar or Ovid, or a passage from the New Testament; or 2)\nquotations from a wide range of Greco-Roman, patristic, rabbinical and\nmedieval sources which Feuerbach cites as evidence to support the\ncentral explanatory claim of the book. This claim is that the\npsychological origin of belief in the gods and in God is the powerful\nhuman wish for happiness or blessedness conceived as a state of\nfreedom from the “limitations” (Grenze) that\nnature imposes on human existence, which are experienced by the human\nsubject in the form of powerful feelings of hope and fear. \nIn seeking to substantiate the claim that the wish is the fundamental\nreligious phenomenon, Feuerbach analyzes several theophanies from the\nIliad in order show that the gods make their appearances in the epic\nin response to petitions directed to them by humans. Insofar as the\nends toward which the actions of the gods in the Homeric epics are\ndirected are determined by the wishes of the mortals who invoke their\nblessings and curses, the gods act as the representatives or deputies\nof (Vertreter) of human self-love (T 12). “The\nwish is a slave of necessity, but a slave with the will to\nfreedom” (T 47), and the gods are the imaginary\nembodiment of human freedom from the restrictions of finitude.\nFeuerbach arrives at this conclusion through his analysis of the acts\nof petitionary prayer in the Iliad and their role in wish fulfillment,\nand cites in this context the observation of the Byzantine Homeric\ncommentator, Eustathius of Thessalonica, that Homer allows no just\nrequest made of the gods to remain unfulfilled. In the divine-human\nrelationship, it is the mortals who desire, strive, and will, and it\nis the gods who complete or bring to fruition these human intentions\nto the extent that the conditions for their satisfaction are beyond\nhuman control (T 19). While the wish itself is a purely\nsubjective psychological occurrence, the completion of the action to\nwhich a wish might give rise, or the achievement of the end toward\nwhich the wish it directed, depends upon external circumstances that\nmay or may not be conducive to the fulfillment of the wish. It is\nunder such circumstances, where failure is a distinct possibility, and\na matter of urgency hangs in the balance, that the gods are invoked\nand their blessings sought in order to bring some human endeavor to a\nsuccessful completion. The gods are beings who are able to do or know\nwhat humans would like to be able to do or know, but cannot\n(T 39).  \nReligion does not originate, as philosophy does, from a theoretical or\nspeculative impulse to understand the world, but in a practical\nconcern to influence the course of events that transpire within it.\nBelief in gods thus presupposes a desire that there should exist\nbeings capable of guaranteeing the success of human endeavors, and\nfaith is preceded by hope in the logical order of things religious. If\nhuman beings did not have a powerful desire, say, to be liberated from\nbondage or to avoid death, belief in the Promised Land or in\nimmortality would never have arisen. In biblical terms, faith in God\nis trust in what God promises, but what is promised by God is what is\nsought after or desired by human beings. The religious significance of\nGod’s promises is contingent upon their correspondence to\ndeep-seated human desires. Whereas, in The Essence of\nReligion, Feuerbach referred to the feeling of dependence as the\n“ground” of religion, he now attributes the psychological\norigin of the gods to the wish. The wish, considered as an act of\nstriving for what remains beyond the limits of human power to achieve,\nis theogonic in the sense that theophanies (i.e., manifestations of\nthe gods or of God) described in the Homeric epics and in the Bible,\nconsidered as narrative events, occur as responses to powerful human\nwishes or needs, or else as expressions of gratitude and celebration\nin response to occasions where these needs are believed to have been\nmet through the cooperation or assistance of a divine agency\n(T 32). The gods owe their existence to “sensualism and\nmaterialism” insofar as they are the product of the material\nneeds of finite, embodied human subjects. \nInteresting sections of the Theogony are devoted to analyzing\nthe role of the gods in the consecration of oaths, and to the origins\nof conscience in the aggrieved will-to-happiness of the other.\nFeuerbach attributes belief in divine justice to the wish that the\nperson by whom one has been harmed should suffer harm themselves\n(T 103). He appeals to the mythological representations of\nthe furies and of Medusa as evidence of the “sensual”\norigins of the voice of conscience (T 136), which presupposes\na powerful, involuntary sense of sympathy with the suffering of person\nwho has suffered, or stands to suffer from, one’s actions. It is\n“only in his egoism that man has a criterion for distinguishing\nbetween right and writing” (T 140). At one point in the\nTheogony Feuerbach defines morality (Sittlichkeit)\nas “the drive-to-happiness endowed with wisdom, the wise,\nrational, healthy, normal, justified (gerechte)\nself-love” (T 82).  \nWhen human beings in the course of their history acquire new and\ndifferent wishes, they tend also to worship new and different\ndivinities. Whereas the ancient Greco-Roman pagans, and even the\nancient Hebrews, were mainly concerned to secure blessedness in the\nform of long life and temporal prosperity, the early Christians sought\ntheir blessedness in eternity or “eternal life”. Feuerbach\nclosely associates this shift from a concern with temporal blessedness\nto a concern with eternal blessedness with the Christian emphasis on\ncreation ex nihilo, which he contrasts both with the Hebrew account of\ncreation as involving the forming and ordering of pre-existent\nelements, and the limitation of the Greco-Roman gods to being able to\nprolong the lives of mortals, and securing their blessedness in this\nlife, without being able to confer immortality upon them. The freedom\nfrom natural necessity ascribed by early Christian thinkers to God is\ninterpreted by Feuerbach as an expression of the wish of these\nChristians to be free themselves from the constraints of material\nexistence. \nAs noted in the preceding section, Feuerbach’s espousal of\nsensuousness coincides with a movement toward nominalism that is\nreflected in a shift of emphasis from the human species to the\nindividual human being in his later works on religion. One way that\nthis shift shows itself is in a striking change in Feuerbach’s\nestimation of egoism. Among the many issues that remain unclear in\nFeuerbach’s later writings is what the expression “human\nessence” can mean for him once he has abandoned the\nspecies-ontology of his earlier writings and declared himself a\nnominalist. That pivotal question aside, it is at least clear that in\nPrinciples, and in his later writings on ethics, Feuerbach\ncontinues to emphasize the importance of inter-subjectivity and of the\nI-Thou relationship, but that these are no longer conceived in\nidealistic terms, as they had been in his earlier writings, including\nhis doctoral dissertation, where he spoke of thought as a\nspecies-activity in which the individual thinking subject\nparticipates. In his later writings on ethics Feuerbach continues to\naffirm that human beings are essentially communal and dialogical\nbeings, both with respect to our cognitive and linguistic capacities,\nand with respect to the range of moral sentiments we experience toward\none another, but the communality in which the human essence is\nmanifested is now said to be one that presupposes a real,\n“sensible” distinction between I and Thou. \nUndoubtedly the central concept in Feuerbach’s last works, which\ninclude the essay, “On Spiritualism and Materialism, Especially\nin Relation to the Freedom of the Will”, and an incomplete essay\non ethics, is the concept of the Glückseligkeitstieb or\ndrive-to-happiness. Toward the end of the Preliminary Theses,\nafter affirming that all science must be grounded in nature, and that\ndoctrines not so grounded remain purely “hypothetical”,\nFeuerbach had gone on to note that this is especially true of the\ndoctrine of freedom, and he had assigned to the new philosophy the\ntask of “naturalizing freedom” (VT 262/172). This\nis one of the tasks to which he applies himself in “On\nSpiritualism and Materialism”, where he takes aim at\n“supernaturalistic” philosophers, among whom he counts\nKant, Fichte and Hegel, who ascribe to human beings a noumenal or\nuniversal will that is “independent of all natural laws and\nnatural causes and thus of all sensuous motivations\n[Triebfedern]” (SM 54). In arguing that it is\npossible for the will to be determined by the mere form of the moral\nlaw, independently of any sensible inclination, Kant had identified\nthe will with pure practical reason. In doing so, Feuerbach argues, he\nturned the will into a mere abstraction. For Feuerbach it makes no\nsense to speak of a timeless will devoid of affect directed toward\nsome particular object. \nThe concepts of drive (Trieb), happiness, sensation and will\nare closely interrelated in the account of agency that Feuerbach\nsought to develop in these last writings. Feuerbach regards sensation\nas the “first condition of willing” (M 366),\nsince without sensation there is no pain or need or sense of lack\nagainst which for the will to strive to assert itself. At one point he\ndefines happiness as the “healthy, normal” state of\ncontentment or wellbeing experienced by an organism that is able to\nsatisfy the needs and drives that are constitutive of its\n“individual, characteristic nature and life” (M\n366). The drive-to-happiness is a drive toward the overcoming of a\nmultitude of painful limitations by which the finite, corporeal\nsubject is afflicted, which can include “political brutality and\ndespotism” (VWR 61/50). Every particular drive is a\nmanifestation of the drive-to-happiness, and the different individual\ndrives are named after the different objects in which people seek\ntheir happiness (SM 70). Among the specific drives to which\nFeuerbach refers in his later writings are the\ndrive-to-self-preservation, the sexual drive, the drive-to-enjoyment,\nthe drive-to-activity and the drive-to-knowledge. Although he does not\nexplicitly associate drives with the unconscious, Feuerbach does\nanticipate Nietzsche and Freud in regarding the body as the\n“ground” of both the will and of consciousness\n(SM 153), and he emphasizes that action results from the\nforce with which a dominant drive succeeds in subduing other\nconflicting drives that may reassert themselves under altered\ncircumstances (SM 91). Feuerbach also occasionally\ndistinguishes between healthy and unhealthy drives, though he has\nlittle to say about the standard or criterion for making such a\ndistinction. \nWhereas happiness involves the experience of a sense of contentment on\nthe part of a being that is able to satisfy the drives that are\ncharacteristic of its nature, the inability to satisfy these drives\nresults in various forms of discontent, aggravation, pain and\nfrustration. The German word, “Widerwille”, means\ndisgust or repugnance, but literally it involves not-wanting or,\netymologically, “willing against”, and this, Feuerbach\ncontends, is the most rudimentary form of willing.  \nEvery malady (Übel), every unsatisfied drive, every\nunassuaged longing, every sense of absence [i.e., of a desired object]\nis an irritating or stimulating injury and negation of the\ndrive-to-happiness innate in each living and sensing being, and the\ncountervailing affirmation of the drive-to-happiness, accompanied by\nrepresentations and consciousness, is what we call “will”.\n(M 367)  \nFreedom of the will, as Feuerbach conceives of it here, is freedom\nfrom the evils (Übeln) by which my drive-to-happiness is\nrestricted, and is contingent upon the availability to me of the\nspecific means required for overcoming these restrictions. \nAnother way that Feuerbach seeks to “naturalize freedom”\nis by developing a naturalistic account of conscience according to\nwhich the voice of conscience, which imposes restrictions on my own\ndrive-to-happiness, functions in doing so as the advocate for the\ndrive-to-happiness of “the I apart from me, the sensuous\nThou” (SM 80), who has been or stands to be harmed by\nthose actions from which I can have a moral obligation to refrain from\nperforming. Where there is no harm or benefit, Feuerbach contends,\nthere is no criterion for distinguishing right from wrong (SM\n75–76). Feuerbach agrees with Schopenhauer in regarding\ncompassion (Mitleid) as a basic source of moral motivation,\nbut rejects Schopenhauer’s association of compassion with the\nrenunciation of the will to live. The purpose of morality and law is\nto harmonize the drive-to-happiness of the various individual members\nof a moral community.  \nMy right is the legal recognition of my own drive-to-happiness, my\nduty is the drive-to-happiness of the other that demands recognition\nfrom me. (SM 74)  \nThe moral will, as Feuerbach conceives of it here, is not a\ndisinterested will. It is rather “that will which seeks to cause\nno harm because it wishes to suffer no harm” (SM 80),\nand has come to identify its own interests with those of others.\nBecause sympathy for the suffering of others presupposes antipathy\ntoward my own suffering, whoever does away with self-interest (i.e.,\nrefuses to recognize moral value in actions motivated by\nself-interest) does away at the same time with compassion\n(Mitleid).","contact.mail":"todd.gooch@eku.edu","contact.domain":"eku.edu"}]
