It is clear enough that people\ndie when their lives end, but less clear what constitutes the ending\nof a person’s life.\n\n\nSecond, in what sense might death or posthumous events harm\nus? To answer this question, we will need to know what it is for\nsomething to be in our interests.\n\n\nThird, what is the case for and the case against the harm\nthesis, the claim that death can harm the individual who dies,\nand the posthumous harm thesis, according to which events\nthat occur after an individual dies can still harm that individual?\n\n\n\nFourth, how might we solve the timing puzzle? This puzzle is\nthe problem of locating the time during which we incur harm for which\ndeath and posthumous events are responsible.\n\n\nA fifth controversy concerns whether all deaths are\nmisfortunes or only some. Of particular interest here is a dispute\nbetween Thomas Nagel, who says that death is always an evil, since\ncontinued life always makes good things accessible, and Bernard\nWilliams, who argues that, while premature death is a misfortune, it\nis a good thing that we are not immortal, since we cannot continue to\nbe who we are now and remain meaningfully attached to life\nforever.\n\n\nA final controversy concerns whether or not the harmfulness\nof death can be reduced. It may be that, by adjusting our conception\nof our well-being, and by altering our attitudes, we can reduce or\neliminate the threat death poses us. But there is a case to be made\nthat such efforts backfire if taken to extremes.\n\nDeath is life’s ending. To clarify death further, we will need\nto say a bit about the nature of life, and ask whether life can be\nsuspended or restored, and how it relates to our continued existence.\nWe can also distinguish between the concept of death and criteria by\nwhich death can be detected. \nIt is not easy to clarify the nature of life. Suppose we could\nconstruct a machine, the HAL 1.01, with (nearly) all of the\npsychological attributes of persons: would HAL 1.01 be alive? Probably\nnot, given the nature of HAL’s hardware. It seems that being\nconscious does not entail being alive. Still, to the extent that we\nare puzzled about the nature of life, we will be puzzled about what is\nentailed by the ending of life, that is, death. \nThings that are alive have a distinctive capacity to develop or\nmaintain themselves by engaging in various processes including\nchemosynthesis, photosynthesis, cellular respiration, cell generation,\nand maintenance of homeostasis. Let us call these vital\nprocesses. It is one thing to have the capacity to deploy these\nprocesses and another to actually deploy them, just as there is a\ndifference between having the ability to run and actually running. For\nsomething to have the property ‘alive’ seems to be a\nmatter of its having the capacity to sustain itself using processes\nthat are saliently similar to these. (For accounts of life, see Van\nInwagen 1990 and Bedau 2014.) \nBy contrast, the property ‘dead’ seems applicable to\nsomething that has lost this capacity. We can call this the loss\nof life account of death. The event by which the\ncapacity to employ vital processes is lost is one thing and the\ncondition of having lost it is another. ‘Death’\ncan refer to either.  \nLet us add that ‘the ending of life’ is itself potentially\nambiguous. On one hand it might be a process wherein our lives are\nprogressively extinguished, until finally they are gone. On the other\nit might be a momentary event. This event might be understood in three\nways. First, it might be the ending of the dying process—the\nloss of the very last trace of life. Call this ‘denouement\ndeath’. Second, it might be the point in the dying process when\nextinction is assured, at least given the resources available to\nprevent it. Call this moment ‘threshold death’. A third\npossibility is that life ends when the physiological systems of the\nbody have lost the capacity to function as an integrated whole, or\nwhen this loss becomes irreversible (Belshaw 2009; DeGrazia 2014).\nCall this ‘integration death’. \nThus death can be a state (being dead), the process of\nextinction (dying), or one of three events that occur\nduring the dying process. Death in all of these senses can be further\ndistinguished from events—such as being shot with an\narrow—that cause death. \nThe loss of life account of death has been challenged by theorists who\nclaim that things placed in suspended animation are not alive (Feldman\n1992, Christopher Belsaw 2009, Cody Gilmore 2013, and David DeGrazia\n2014). When zygotes and embryos are frozen for later use in the in\nvitro fertilization procedure, their vital processes are brought to a\nstop, or very nearly so. The same goes for water bears that are\ndehydrated, and for seeds and spores. It seems clear that the zygotes\nand water bears are not dead, since their vital processes can easily\nbe restarted—by warming the zygote or by wetting the water bear.\nThey are not dead, but are they alive? If we deny that they are alive,\npresumably we would do so on the grounds that their vital processes\nare halted. If something’s life can be ended by suspending its\nvital processes without its dying, then we must reject the loss of\nlife account of death. \nHowever, the loss of life account is thoroughly established in\nordinary usage, and is easily reconciled with the possibility of\nsuspended animation. In denying that frozen embryos are dead, it is\nclear that we mean to emphasize that they have not lost the\ncapacity to deploy their vital processes. When we say that\nsomething is dead, we mean to emphasize that this capacity\nhas been lost. Having used ‘dead’ to signal this\nloss, why would we want to use the word ‘alive’ to signal\nthe fact that something is making active use of its vital processes?\nOur best option is to use a pair of contrasting terms. We can use\n‘viable’ to indicate that something has the capacity to\ndeploy vital processes and ‘unviable’ to indicate that it\nhas lost this capacity. When instead we are concerned about whether or\nnot something is engaging its vital processes, we can use different\ncontrasting terms, say ‘vital’ and ‘nonvital’,\nthe former to characterize something that is employing its capacity\nfor vital processes and the latter to characterize something that is\nnot making use of its capacity for vital processes. What seems\nrelatively uncontroversial is that being dead consists in unviability.\nTo retain the loss of life account, we have only to add that being\nalive consists in viability. We can then say that a frozen embryo is\nviable and hence alive despite its lack of vitality, and it will die\nif its life ends (it will die if it ceases to be viable). Of course,\nif we are willing to abandon the loss of life account, we could\ninstead use ‘alive’ to characterize something that is both\nviable and vital. We would then say that a frozen embryo is not alive\n(since it lacks vitality) but also that it is not dead (since it\nremains viable). \nIt will be useful to sharpen the loss of life account if, as seems\nconceivable, it is possible to restore life to something that\nhas died. \nRestoration in this sense is quite different from the revival of\nsomething, such as a frozen embryo, whose vital processes have been\nhalted. Something can be revived only if it is\nalive—only if it has the capacity to deploy vital processes, as\nin the case of a frozen zygote. It is revived when it regains\nvitality. Something’s life can be restored only if it\nhas lost its capacity for vital processes. Life is restored when this\ncapacity is regained. \nTo bring the possibility of restoration into view, imagine a\nfuturistic device, the Disassembler-Reassembler, that reduces\nme to small cubes, or individual cells, or disconnected atoms, which\nit stores and later reassembles just as they were before. Many of us\nwill say that I would survive—my life would continue—after\nReassembly, but it is quite clear that I would not live during\nintervals when my atoms are stacked in storage. I would not even exist\nduring such intervals. If I can be Reassembled, my life would be\nrestored, not revived. Restoration, not revival, is a way of bringing\na creature back from the dead. Now imagine a device that repairs\ncorpses: it moves molecules back to where they were prior to the death\nof the creature that left the corpse, and restarts its vital\nprocesses. Like the Disassembler-Reassembler, the corpse\nreanimator would resurrect the dead—it would restore the\nlives of people who have died. \nGiven the possibilities of restoration and revivification, it seems\nbest to refine the loss of life account, as follows: \nDying is the loss of a thing’s life—the loss of\nits capacity to perpetuate itself using vital processes. A thing dies\nat the time it loses this capacity. It is dead at all times\nafterwards, except while that capacity is regained.  \nDeath for you and me is constituted by the loss of our capacity to\nsustain ourselves using vital processes. This characterization of\ndeath could be sharpened if we had a clearer idea of what we\nare, and the conditions under which we persist. However, the\nlatter is a matter of controversy.  \nThere are three main views: animalism, which says that we are\nhuman beings (Snowdon 1990, Olson 1997, 2007); personism,\nwhich says that we are creatures with the capacity for self-awareness;\nand mindism, which says that we are minds (which may or may\nnot have the capacity for self-awareness) (McMahan 2002). Animalism\nsuggests that we persist over time just in case we remain the same\nanimal; mindism suggests that we persist just when we remain the same\nmind. Personism is usually paired with the view that our persistence\nis determined by our psychological features and the relations among\nthem (Locke 1689, Parfit 1984).  \nIf we are animals, with the persistence conditions of animals, our\ndeaths are constituted by the cessation of the vital processes that\nsustain our existence as human beings. If we are minds, our deaths are\nconstituted by the extinction of the vital processes that sustain our\nexistence as minds. And if persistence is determined by our retaining\ncertain psychological features, then the loss of those features will\nconstitute death.  \nThese three ways of understanding death have very different\nimplications. Severe dementia can destroy a great many psychological\nfeatures without destroying the mind, which suggests that death as\nunderstood by personists can occur even though death as understood by\nmindists has not. Moreover, human beings sometimes survive the\ndestruction of the mind, as when the cerebrum dies but the brainstem\ndoes not, leaving an individual in a persistent vegetative state. It\nis also conceivable that the mind can survive the extinction of the\nhuman being: this might occur if the brain is removed from the body,\nkept alive artificially, and the remainder of the body is destroyed\n(assuming that a bare brain is not a human being). These possibilities\nsuggest that death as understood by mindists can occur even though\ndeath as understood by animalists has not (and also that the latter\nsort of death need not be accompanied by the former.) \nWhat is the relationship between existence and death? May people and\nother creatures continue to exist after dying, or cease to exist\nwithout dying?  \nTake the first question: may you and I and other creatures continue to\nexist for some time after our lives end? Fred Feldman (1992, p. 91) coins the term termination thesis to refer to the view that “when a person dies, he or she. . .goes out of existence; subsequently, there is no such thing as that person.” (A version of the thesis applies to any living thing.) The position that we can indeed survive death we might\ncall the dead survivors view. The dead survivors view has\nbeen defended by various theorists, most notably Feldman (1992,\n2000, 2013). One point cited in its favor is that we commonly refer to\n‘dead animals’ (and ‘dead plants’) which may\nsuggest that we believe that animals continue to exist, as animals,\nwhile no longer alive. The idea might be that an animal continues to\ncount as the same animal if enough of its original components remain\nin much the same order, and animals continue to meet this condition\nfor a time following death (Mackie 1997). On this view, if you and I\nare animals (as animalists say) then we could survive for a time after\nwe are dead, albeit as corpses. In fact, we could survive\nindefinitely, by arranging to have our corpses preserved. \nHowever, this way of defending the dead survivors view may not be\ndecisive. The terms ‘dead animal’ and ‘dead\nperson’ seem ambiguous. Normally, when we use ‘dead\npeople’ or ‘dead animal’ we mean to speak of persons\nor animals who lived in the past. One dead person I can name is\nSocrates; he is now a ‘dead person’ even though his corpse\nsurely has ceased to exist. However, in certain contexts, such as in\nmorgues, we seem to use the terms ‘dead animal’ and\n‘dead person’ to mean “remains of something that was\nan animal” or “remains of something that was a\nperson.” On this interpretation, even in morgues calling\nsomething a dead person does not imply that it is a person.  \nWhat about the second question: can creatures cease to exist without\ndying? Certainly things that never were alive, such as bubbles and\nstatues, can be deathlessly annihilated. Arguably, there are also ways\nthat living creatures can be deathlessly annihilated (Rosenberg 1983,\nFeldman 1992, Gilmore 2013). Perhaps an amoeba’s existence ends\nwhen it splits, replacing itself with two amoebas, and the existence\nof chlamydomonas ends when pairs of them fuse to form a zygote. Yet\nwhen amoebas split, and chlamydomonas fuse, the vital processes that\nsustain them do not cease. If people could divide like amoebas,\nperhaps they, too could cease to exist without dying. (For a famous\ndiscussion of division, fusion, and their implications, see Parfit\n1981.) If such ‘deathless exits’ are possible, we would\nhave to modify the loss of life account of death. \nHowever, proponents of that account can hold their ground. They can\nsay that division, fusion, and other apparent examples of deathless\nexits are unusual ways of dying, because nonexistence is not brought\nabout via the destruction of vital processes, but they are not ways of\nescaping death altogether. Proponents of the loss of life account\nmight also turn the tables on its critics, and argue as follows:\nnothing can be alive unless it exists, so if something ceases to exist\nit ceases to be alive, but to cease to be alive is to die. So there\nare no deathless exits after all. \nDefining death is one thing; providing criteria by which it can be\nreadily detected or verified is another. A definition is an account of\nwhat death \\(is\\); when, and only when its definition is met, death\nhas necessarily occurred. A criterion for death, by contrast, lays out\nconditions by which all and only actual deaths may be readily\nidentified. Such a criterion falls short of a definition, but plays a\npractical role. For example, it would help physicians and jurists\ndetermine when death has occurred. \nIn the United States, the states have adopted criteria for death\nmodeled on the Uniform Determination of Death Act (developed by the\nPresident’s Commission, 1981), which says that “an\nindividual who has sustained either (1) irreversible cessation of\ncirculatory and respiratory functions, or (2) irreversible cessation\nof all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem, is\ndead. A determination of death must be made in accordance with\naccepted medical standards.” In the United Kingdom, the accepted\ncriterion is brain stem death, or the “permanent functional\ndeath of the brain stem” (Pallis 1982).  \nThese current criteria are subject to criticism, even if we put aside\nreservations concerning the qualifier ‘irreversible’.\nAnimalists might resist the criteria since the vital processes of\nhuman beings whose entire brains have ceased to function can be\nsustained artificially using cardiopulmonary assistance. Mindists and\npersonists might also resist the criteria, on the grounds that minds\nand all psychological features can be destroyed in human beings whose\nbrain stems are intact. For example, cerebral death can leave its\nvictim with an intact brain stem, yet mindless and devoid of\nself-awareness. \nMay death or posthumous events harm us? Might they benefit us?\nPerhaps; in order to decide, we will need an analysis of\nwelfare, which tells us what well-being is and how well off\nwe are. We will also need an account of personal interests,\nwhich tells us what it is for something to be in our interests or\nagainst our interests. \nThe most widely accepted account of our interests is\ncomparativism. In order to clarify comparativism, it is best\nto distinguish different senses in which an event can have value. \nSome events are intrinsically good (or bad) for a subject; such events\nare good (bad) for their own sakes, rather than in virtue of their\ncontingent effects. By contrast, some events are extrinsically good\n(bad) for a subject; they are good (bad) because of their contingent\neffects. For example, many people count their pleasure as\nintrinsically good and their pain as intrinsically bad; aspirin would\nbe extrinsically good, since it eliminates pain, and really bad puns\nwould be extrinsically bad in that they are painful. \nEvents can have value in a different way: they can be overall good\n(bad) for a subject; that is, they can be good (bad) all things\nconsidered. Events are overall good (bad) for me when (and to the\nextent that) they make my life better (worse) than it would be if\nthose events had not occurred. Contrast events that are partially good\n(bad) for me: these make my life better (worse) only in some respects.\nPartial goods may be overall bad for me. For example, playing video\ngames every day gives me pleasure, and is hence partially good for me,\nbut if it also causes me to neglect my job, health and family, it\nmight well be overall bad for me.  \nAccording to comparativism, the value an event \\(E\\) has for me is\nroughly \\(E\\)’s overall value for me. But let us attempt to\nformulate the comparativist account a bit more precisely. \nTo assess the value for me of an event \\(E\\), we begin by\ndistinguishing two possible situations, or possible worlds. One of\nthese is the actual world, which is the world as it actually is, past\npresent and future. The other is the possible world that is the way\nthings would be if \\(E\\) had not occurred. We can assume that this is\nthe world that is as similar to the actual world as possible, and in\nthat way ‘closest’ to the actual world, except that \\(E\\)\ndoes not occur, and various other things are different because of\n\\(E\\)’s nonoccurrence. We can call the actual world \\(W_{E}\\),\nin this way reminding ourselves that world \\(W_{E}\\), in this way\nreminding ourselves that \\(E\\) actually occurred. And by \\(W_{{\\sim}\nE}\\) we can indicate the closest world to the actual world in which\n\\(E\\) does not occur. Here the tilde, ‘\\({\\sim}\\)’, stands\nfor ‘not’.  \nThe next step is to assess my welfare level in \\(W_{E}\\) and my\nwelfare level in \\(W_{{\\sim} E}\\). My welfare level in \\(W_{E}\\) is\nthe intrinsic value for me of my life in \\(W_{E}\\); it is the value my\nlife actually has for me, measured in terms of intrinsic goods and\nintrinsic evils. To calculate my welfare level in \\(W_{E}\\), we start\nby assigning a value to my intrinsic goods in \\(W_{E}\\). This will be\na positive value representing the sum of these goods. Next we assign a\nvalue to my intrinsic evils in \\(W_{E}\\); this will be a negative\nvalue. Next we sum these values; the goods will raise this sum, while\nthe evils will lower it. Some symbolism might help fix ideas (although\nit may give the false impression that our subject matter admits of\nmore precision that is actually possible). Let \\(G(S,W)\\) stand for\nthe sum of the values of \\(S\\)’s intrinsic goods in world W, and\nlet \\(B(S,W)\\) stand for the sum of the values of \\(S\\)’s\nintrinsic evils in \\(W\\). So far we have said that \\(S\\)’s\nwelfare level in \\(W_{E}\\) equals \\(G(S,W_{E}) + B(S,W_{E})\\). If we\nlet \\(IV(S,W)\\) stand for the intrinsic value of world \\(W\\) for\nsubject \\(S\\), the claim is that \nMy welfare level in \\(W_{{\\sim} E}\\) is assessed similarly; it is the\nsum of my intrinsic goods and evils in \\(W_{{\\sim} E}\\). \nFinally, we subtract the value for me of my life in \\(W_{{\\sim} E}\\)\nfrom the value for me of my life in \\(W_{E}\\). According to\ncomparativism, this is the value \\(E\\) has for me. Letting \\(V(S,E)\\)\nstand for the value of E for subject S, comparativism says that \nThis value determines whether an event is overall bad (good) for a\nsubject \\(S\\). If \\(E\\)’s value for \\(S\\) is negative, that is,\nif \\(V(S,E) \\lt 0\\), then \\(E\\) is overall bad for \\(S\\). If\n\\(E\\)’s value is positive, then \\(E\\) is overall good for \\(S\\).\nThe more negative (positive) \\(E\\)’s value is, the worse\n(better) \\(E\\) is for \\(S\\). \nConsider an example. Suppose that we are looking to identify the value\nfor me of drinking this cup of coffee. Call this event Drink.\nThen the first step is to distinguish the actual world, \\(W_{Drink}\\),\nin which I drank the coffee, from the closest world in which I did\nnot, \\(W_{{\\sim} Drink}\\). Then we calculate my welfare level in\n\\(W_{Drink}\\), \\(IV(Luper,W_{Drink})\\) and in \\(W_{{\\sim} Drink}\\),\n\\(IV(Luper,W_{{\\sim} Drink})\\). The former, \\(IV(Luper,W_{Drink})\\),\nequals the value of the intrinsic goods I will enjoy in my life plus\nthe value of the intrinsic evils I will endure. For simplicity, let us\npull a number out of the hat to indicate the value of the goods I will\nenjoy in my life before I drink the coffee, say 100, and another\nnumber to indicate the value of the evils I will endure in my life\nbefore I drink the coffee, say \\(-50\\). Let us also assume that\ndrinking the coffee will give me some pleasure for one hour, which has\na value of 10, and drinking the coffee will not cause me to endure any\nevils. Finally, let us assume that after that hour of savoring my\ncoffee, I will go on to enjoy goods with a value of 50, and evils with\na value of \\(-10\\). Then \nAssuming that my life one hour after drinking my coffee would\nbe just like my life would have been were I not to drink my coffee,\nmore or less, so that drinking my coffee benefits me only during the\nhour I savor it, we can say that \nGiven these assumptions, \nDrinking the coffee, then, was good for me, as 10 is a positive\nvalue. \nWe can now offer a rough statement of the comparativist account of\ninterests. \nIn order to refine the comparativist account, we will need to\ndistinguish between event tokens and event types.\nEvent tokens are concrete events, such as the bombing of the World\nTrade Center. Event types are abstract entities such as bombings,\nleapings and burials. One token of the type bombing is the\nbombing of the World Trade Center. Earlier we used the letter\n‘\\(E\\)’ to refer to event tokens rather than event types.\nWhat is more, we assumed that the event tokens to which\n‘\\(E\\)’ referred were actual events, not merely possible\nevents. But perhaps we can also offer a comparativist account of the\nvalue of the occurrence of an \\(E\\)-type event; that is, a\ncomparativist account of how valuable it would be for a subject \\(S\\)\nif an event of type \\(E\\) were to occur. \nTo this end, we might assess the value for \\(S\\) of the occurrence of\nan \\(E\\)-type event by working out \\(S\\)’s welfare level in the\nactual world (where presumably an \\(E\\)-type event did not occur) then\n\\(S\\)’s welfare level in the closest world in which an\n\\(E\\)-type event does occur, and subtracting the first from the\nsecond. When the result is a positive value, the occurrence of an\n\\(E\\)-type event would be good for \\(S\\); when negative, the\noccurrence would be bad for \\(S\\).  \nIn sum, the comparativist view may be stated as follows: \nWe sometimes say things that suggest that we can have interests at\nparticular times which we lack at others. For example, we might say\nthat having a tooth drilled by a dentist is not in our interests while\nwe are undergoing the procedure, even though it is in our long-term\ninterests. The idea seems to be that what makes a subject \\(S\\) better\noff at time \\(t\\) is in \\(S\\)’s interests-at-time-\\(t\\). But it\nis important to distinguish interests-at-\\(t\\) from\ninterests. What is in our interests-at-time-\\(t_{1}\\) need\nnot be in our interests-at-time-\\(t_{2}\\). This is not true of our\ninterests. Whatever interests we have we have at all times. If\nsomething is in our interests, it is timelessly in our interests. \nComparativism analyses our interests in terms of our welfare, and is\ncompatible with any number of views of welfare. There are three main\nways of understanding welfare itself: positive hedonism,\npreferentialism, and pluralism. Let us briefly consider each of these\nthree views.  \nPositive hedonism is the following position: \nPositive Hedonism: for any subject \\(S\\), experiencing\npleasure at \\(t\\) is the one and only thing that is intrinsically good\nfor \\(S\\) at \\(t\\), while experiencing pain at \\(t\\) is the one and\nonly thing that is intrinsically bad for \\(S\\) at \\(t\\). The more\npleasure (pain) \\(S\\) experiences at \\(t\\), the greater the intrinsic\ngood (evil) for \\(S\\) at \\(t\\).  \nPositive hedonism has been defended (by J.S.Mill 1863) on the grounds\nthat it resolves the problem of commensurability. The difficulty\narises when we attempt to equate units of different sorts of goods.\nFor example, how do we decide when one unit of love is worth one unit\nof achievements, assuming that both love and achievements are\nintrinsically good? The problem does not arise for hedonists, who\nevaluate all things in terms of the pleasure and pain that they give\nus. \nHowever, most theorists consider positive hedonism to be implausible.\nNagel argues that I would harm you if I were to cause you to revert to\na pleasant infantile state for the rest of your life, yet by hedonist\nstandards I have not harmed you at all. Similarly, it would be a grave\nmisfortune for you if your spouse came to despise you, but for some\nreason pretended to love you, so that you underwent no loss of\npleasure. And Nozick notes that we would refuse to attach ourselves to\nan Experience Machine that would give us extremely pleasant\nexperiences for the rest of our lives. By hypothesis, the Machine\nwould give us far more pleasure (and less pain) than is otherwise\npossible. Our reluctance to use the Machine suggests that things other\nthan pleasure are intrinsically good: it is because we do not wish to\nmiss out on these other goods that we refuse to use the Machine. \nPreferentialism assesses welfare in terms of desire fulfillment. To\ndesire is to desire that some proposition \\(P\\) hold; when we desire\n\\(P, P\\) is the object of our desire. According to\npreferentialism, our welfare turns on whether the objects of our\ndesires hold: \nPreferentialism: for any subject \\(S\\), it is intrinsically\ngood for \\(S\\) at \\(t\\) that, at \\(t, S\\) desires \\(P\\) and \\(P\\)\nholds; it is intrinsically bad for \\(S\\) at \\(t\\) that, at \\(t, S\\)\ndesires \\(P\\) and \\({\\sim}P\\) holds. The stronger \\(S\\)’s desire\nfor \\(P\\) is, the better (worse) it is for \\(S\\) that \\(P\\) holds\n(\\({\\sim}P\\) holds).  \nIn this, its unrefined form, preferentialism is implausible. Many of\nthe things we desire do not appear to contribute to our welfare.\nConsider, for example, Rawls’ famous example of the man whose\nmain desire is to count blades of grass. In response to the grass\ncounter case, Rawls (1971) adopts critical preferentialism,\nwhich says that welfare is advanced by the fulfillment of\nrational aims. Assuming that counting grass blades is\nirrational because it is pointless, fulfilling the desire to count\ngrass blades is not intrinsically good. However, even critical\npreferentialism seems vulnerable to attack, since the fulfillment of\nrational desires need not advance one’s welfare. Parfit (1984)\nillustrates the point by supposing that you have the (rational) desire\nthat a stranger’s disease be overcome: the fulfilment of this\ndesire advances the stranger’s welfare, not yours. This example\ncan be handled by egocentric preferentialism, which says that\nonly desires that make essential reference to the self can advance our\nwelfare when fulfilled (Overvold 1980). Thus the fulfilment of my\ndesire that \\(I\\) be happy is intrinsically good for me, but the\nfulfilment of my desire that somebody or other be happy is not. A\nfurther variant of preferentialism might be called achievement\npreferentialism. This view says that subject \\(S\\)’s\naccomplishing one of \\(S\\)’s goals (or ends) is intrinsically\ngood for \\(S\\), and that being thwarted from accomplishing such a goal\nis intrinsically bad for \\(S\\) (Scanlon 1998; Keller 2004; Portmore\n2007). \nPluralism is the third main account of welfare. Pluralists can agree\nwith the hedonist position that a person’s pleasure is\nintrinsically good for that person, and with the\npreferentialist’s view that the fulfilment of a person’s\ndesire is intrinsically good for that person. However, pluralism says\nthat various other sorts of things are intrinsically good, too. Some\ntraditional examples are wisdom, friendship and love, and honor.\nAnother example might be engaging in self-determination. \nTypically, those who value life accept the harm thesis: death\nis, at least sometimes, bad for those who die, and in this sense\nsomething that ‘harms’ them. (Several theorists, including\nBarbara Levenbook (2013), emphasize that, in one sense of the term\n‘harm’, events that are only partially bad for me might be\nsaid to harm me. In what follows the term ‘harm’ will be\nrestricted to events that are overall bad for me.) It is important to\nknow what to make of this thesis, since our response itself can be\nharmful. This might happen as follows: suppose that we love life, and\nreason that since it is good, more would be better. Our thoughts then\nturn to death, and we decide it is bad: the better life is, we think,\nthe better more life would be, and the worse death is. At this point,\nwe are in danger of condemning the human condition, which embraces\nlife and death, on the grounds that it has a tragic side, namely\ndeath. It will help some if we remind ourselves that our situation\nalso has a good side. Indeed, our condemnation of death is here based\non the assumption that more life would be good. But such consolations\nare not for everyone. (They are unavailable if we crave immortality on\nthe basis of demanding standards by which the only worthwhile projects\nare endless in duration, for then we will condemn the condition of\nmere mortals as tragic through and through, and may, as Unamuno (1913)\npoints out, end up suicidal, fearing that the only life available is\nnot worth having.) And a favorable assessment of life may be a limited\nconsolation, since it leaves open the possibility that, viewing the\nhuman condition as a whole, the bad cancels much of the good. In any\ncase it is grim enough to conclude that, given the harm thesis, the\nhuman condition has a tragic side. It is no wonder that theorists over\nthe millennia have sought to defeat the harm thesis. We will examine\ntheir efforts, as well as the challenges to the posthumous harm\nthesis, according to which events occurring after we die can harm us.\nFirst, however, let us see how the harm theses might be defended. \nThose theorists who defend the harm theses typically draw upon some\nversion of comparativism (e.g., Nagel 1970, Quinn 1984, Feldman 1991).\nAccording to comparativism, a person’s death may well harm that\nperson. Death may also be harmless. To decide whether a person’s\ndeath is bad for that person, we must compare her actual welfare level\nto the welfare level she would have had if she had not died. Suppose,\nfor example, that Hilda died on December 1, 2008 at age 25 and that,\nhad she not died, she would have prospered for 25 years and suffered\nduring her final five years. To apply comparativism, we must first\nselect an account of welfare with which to assess Hilda’s\nwell-being. For simplicity, let us adopt positive hedonism. The next\nstep is to sum the pleasure and pain she had over her lifetime.\nSuppose that she had considerably more pleasure than pain. We can\nstipulate that her lifetime welfare level came to a value of 250. Next\nwe sum the pleasure and pain she would have had if she had not died on\nDecember 1, 2008. The first 25 years of her life would be just as they\nactually were, so the value of these would be 250. We can suppose that\nher next 25 years would also receive the value of 250. And let us\nstipulate that her final 5 years, spent mostly suffering, carry a\nvalue of \\(-50\\). Then, had she not died, her lifetime welfare level\nwould have been \\(250 + 250 - 50 = 450\\). Subtracting this value from\nher actual lifetime welfare level of 250 gives us \\(-200\\). This is\nthe value for her of dying on December 1, 2008. According to\ncomparativism, then, her death was quite bad for her. Things would\nhave been different if the last 30 years of her life would have been\nspent in unrelenting agony. On that assumption, her death would have\nbeen good for her. \nOur example concerned a particular death at a specific time.\nComparativism also has implications concerning whether dying young is\nbad for the one who dies, and whether it is bad for us that we die at\nall. In both cases the answer depends on how our lives would have gone\nhad we not died. Usually dying young deprives us of many years of good\nlife, so usually dying young is bad for us. As for whether or not it\nis bad to be mortal, that depends on whether the life we would lead as\nan immortal being would be a good one or not. \nAccording to comparativism, when death is bad for us, it is bad for us\nbecause it precludes our coming to have various intrinsic goods which\nwe would have had if we had not died. We might say that death is bad\nfor us because of the goods it deprives us of, and not, or at least\nnot always, because of any intrinsic evils for which it is\nresponsible. \nSo much for the harm thesis. Now let us ask how the posthumous harm\nthesis might be defended.  \nNote first that we must reject the posthumous harm thesis if we adopt\npositive hedonism and combine it with comparativism, for nothing that\nhappens after we die can boost or reduce the amounts of pleasure or\npain in our lives. \nHowever, posthumous events might well be bad for us on other accounts\nof welfare. Suppose that I want to be remembered after I die. Given\npreferentialism, something could happen after I die that might be bad\nfor me, namely my being forgotten, because it thwarts my desire. \nThese ways of defending the harm theses seem quite plausible.\nNevertheless, there are several strategies for criticizing the harm\ntheses. Let us turn to these criticisms now, starting with some\nstrategies developed in the ancient world by Epicurus and his follower\nLucretius. \nOne challenge to the harm thesis is an attempt to show that the state\ndeath puts us in, nonexistence, is not bad. According to the\nsymmetry argument, posed by Lucretius, a follower of\nEpicurus, we can prove this to ourselves by thinking about our state\nbefore we were born: \nThe idea is clear to a point: it is irrational to object to death,\nsince we do not object to pre-vital nonexistence (the state of\nnonexistence that preceded our lives), and the two are alike in all\nrelevant respects, so that any objection to the one would apply to the\nother. However, Lucretius’ argument admits of more than one\ninterpretation, depending on whether it is supposed to address death\nunderstood as the ending of life or death understood as the state we\nare in after life is ended (or both). \nOn the first interpretation, the ending of life is not bad, since the\nonly thing we could hold against it is the fact that it is followed by\nour nonexistence, yet the latter is not objectionable, as is shown by\nthe fact that we do not object to our nonexistence before birth. So\nunderstood, the symmetry argument is weak. Our complaint about death\nneed not be that the state of nonexistence is ghastly. Instead, our\ncomplaint might be that death brings life, which is a good thing, to\nan end, and, other things being equal, what deprives us of good things\nis bad. Notice that the mirror image of death is birth (or, more\nprecisely, becoming alive), and the two affect us in very different\nways: birth makes life possible; it starts a good thing going. Death\nmakes life impossible; it brings a good thing to a close.  \nPerhaps Lucretius only meant to argue that the death state is\nnot bad, since the only thing we could hold against the death state is\nthat it is nonexistence, which is not really objectionable, as witness\nour attitude about pre-vital nonexistence. So interpreted, there is a\nkernel of truth in Lucretius’ argument. Truly, our pre-vital\nnonexistence does not concern us much. But that is because pre-vital\nnonexistence is followed by existence. Nor would we worry overly about\npost-vital nonexistence if it, too, were followed by existence. If we\ncould move in and out of existence, say with the help of futuristic\nmachines that could dismantle us, then rebuild us, molecule by\nmolecule, after a period of nonexistence, we would not be overly upset\nabout the intervening gaps, and, rather like hibernating bears, we\nmight enjoy taking occasional breaks from life while the world gets\nmore interesting. But undergoing temporary nonexistence is not the\nsame as undergoing permanent nonexistence. What is upsetting is the\npermanence of post-vital nonexistence—not nonexistence per\nse. \nThere is another way to use considerations of symmetry to argue\nagainst the harm thesis: we want to die later, or not at all, because\nit is a way of extending life, but this attitude is irrational,\nLucretius might say, since we do not want to be born earlier (we do\nnot want to have always existed), which is also a way to extend life.\nAs this argument suggests, we are more concerned about the indefinite\ncontinuation of our lives than about their indefinite\nextension. (Be careful when you rub the magic lamp: if you\nwish that your life be extended, the genie might make you older!) A\nlife can be extended by adding to its future \\(or\\) to its past. Some\nof us might welcome the prospect of having lived a life stretching\nindefinitely into the past, given fortuitous circumstances. But we\nwould prefer a life stretching indefinitely into the future. \nIs it irrational to want future life more than past life? No; it is\nnot surprising to find ourselves with no desire to extend life into\nthe past, since the structure of the world permits life extension only\ninto the future, and that is good enough. But what if life extension\nwere possible in either direction? Would we still be indifferent about\na lengthier past? And should our attitude about future life match our\nattitude about past life? \nOur attitude about future life should match our attitude about past\nlife if our interests and attitudes are limited in certain ways. If\nquantity of life is the only concern, a preference for future life is\nirrational. Similarly, the preference is irrational if our only\nconcern is to maximize how much pleasure we experience over the course\nof our lives without regard to its temporal distribution. But our\nattitude is not that of the life- or pleasure-gourmand. \nAccording to Parfit, we have a far-reaching bias extending to goods in\ngeneral: we prefer that any good things, not just pleasures, be in our\nfuture, and that bad things, if they happen at all, be in our past. He\nargues that if we take this extensive bias for granted, and assume\nthat, because of it, it is better for us to have goods in the future\nthan in the past, we can explain why it is rational to deplore death\nmore than we do our not having always existed: the former, not the\nlatter, deprives us of good things in the future (he need not say that\nit is because it is in the past that we worry about the life-limiting\nevent at the beginning of our lives less than the life-limiting event\nat the end). This preference for future goods is unfortunate, however,\naccording to Parfit. If cultivated, the temporal insensitivity of the\nlife- or pleasure-gourmand could lower our sensitivity to death:\ntowards the end of life, we would find it unsettling that our supply\nof pleasures cannot be increased in the future, but we would be\ncomforted by the pleasures we have accumulated. \nWhether or not we have the extensive bias described by Parfit, it is\ntrue that the accumulation of life and pleasure, and the passive\ncontemplation thereof, are not our only interests. We also have\nactive, forward-looking goals and concerns. Engaging in such pursuits\nhas its own value; for many of us, these pursuits, and not passive\ninterests, are central to our identities. However, we cannot make and\npursue plans for our past. We must project our plans (our\nself-realization) into the future, which explains our forward bias.\n(We could have been devising and pursuing plans in the past,\nbut these plans will not, I assume, be extensions of our present\nconcerns.) It is not irrational to prefer that our lives be extended\ninto the future rather than the past, if for no other reason than\nthis: only the former makes our existing forward-looking pursuits\npossible. It is not irrational to prefer not to be at the end of our\nlives, unable to shape them further, and limited to reminiscing about\ndays gone by. As Frances Kamm (1998) emphasizes, we do not want our\nlives to be all over with. \nNevertheless, it does not follow that we should be\nindifferent about the extent of our pasts. Being in the grip\nof forward-looking pursuits is important, but we have passive\ninterests as well, which make a more extensive past preferable.\nMoreover, having been devising and pursuing plans in the past\nis worthwhile. If fated to die tomorrow, most of us would prefer to\nhave a thousand years of glory behind us rather than fifty. We want to\nhave lived well. \nFurther challenges to the harm theses are offered by Epicurus\n(341–270) in his Letter to Menoeceus: \nWe might restate Epicurus’ brief argument as follows: if death\nharms the individual who dies, there must exist a subject who\nis harmed by death, a clear harm that is received, and a\ntime when that harm is received. As to the timing issue,\nthere seems to be two possible solutions, given that death follows\nimmediately upon life: either death harms its victims while they are\nalive or later. If we opt for the second solution we appear to run\nhead on into the problem of the subject, for assuming that we do not\nexist after we are alive, no one is left to incur harm. We also\nencounter the problem of specifying a harm that might be accrued by a\nnonexistent person. If we opt for the first solution—death harms\nits victims while they are alive—we have a ready solution to the\nproblem of the subject but we face the problem of supplying a clear\nway in which death is bad: death seems unable to have any ill\neffect on us while we are living since it will not yet have occurred.\nSeeing that there is no coherent solution to all three issues,\nEpicurus rejects the harm thesis. \nEpicurus focuses on death, but if his argument is good, it applies\nmore generally, to include all events that follow death.  \nIn some respects Epicurus’s argument is not clear. One problem\nis that what he means by ‘death’ is unclear. For now let\nus assume that he meant to refer to the process by which our lives are\nended. Another interpretive problem arises as well: his intent might\nbe to show that neither death nor posthumous events can\naffect us at all. From this claim it would follow\nthat death and posthumous events are harmless, assuming that an event\nharms us only if it somehow affects us at some time (perhaps well\nafter it occurs). \nLet us see if it is possible to show that death and posthumous events\ndo not affect us. Then we can try out (in the next section) a weaker\nthesis: that death and posthumous events cannot affect us in a way\nthat is bad for us. This weaker claim is easier to defend, but\nthe stronger claim is worth exploring. \nWe can start with some assumptions about when an event can affect us.\nTo this end, let us adopt the causal account of\nresponsibility: \nFrom the causal account, together with some plausible assumptions, it\nfollows that a post-mortem event, such as the burning of\none’s corpse, cannot affect us after we are dead, since, by (a),\nto be affected is to be affected causally, but, by (b), nonexistent\npeople cannot be causally affected by any event. It also follows that\nthe state of being dead cannot affect us while we are dead. Here we\nare assuming that people cease to exist when they die (the termination\nthesis). From the causal account it also follows that neither being\ndead, nor any events that follow, can affect us while we are alive,\ngiven the ban on backwards causation: \nSo far so good: neither the state of being dead nor any post-mortem\nevent can ever affect us. However, it has not been shown that we\ncannot be affected by the dying process. Of course, the thesis that we\nmust exist to be affected, together with the termination thesis, rule\nout the possibility that death affects us after it occurs\n(after we are nonexistent). And the ban on backwards causation rules\nout the possibility that death affects us before it occurs. Thus: \nBut nothing said so far rules out the possibility that death affects\nus exactly when it occurs. In particular, the problem of the\nsubject does not arise since it is a living, existing person who is\nharmed by death while it occurs. Is there any way to establish that\ndeath cannot affect us even at the time it occurs? There might be two\nways. First, we might claim that death occurs only after we are\nnonexistent. This assumption has the odd consequence that death can\naffect us only if posthumous events can. It will follow from (7) that\ndeath cannot ever affect us. Second, we might claim that death is\ninstantaneous; it happens too quickly to affect us. \nSome theorists have indeed defined ‘death’—the\nending of life—in such a way as to imply that it occurs only\nafter we are nonexistent. For example, Feinberg (1984), following\nLevenbook (1984), defines death as “the first moment of the\nsubject’s nonexistence.” Perhaps this definition is\nmotivated by the awkwardness of attaching ‘death’ to a\nmoment in the dying process when a spark of life persists. However, it\nis at least as awkward to attach ‘death’ to a moment after\nthe dying process is over—to suggest that the ending of life\noccurs while we are in a state of death. It is also to concede too\nmuch to the Epicurean, who could then establish that death is no evil\nmerely by showing that posthumous events are innocuous. \nWhat about the suggestion that death happens too quickly to affect\nus? \nRecall that ‘death’ can be used in the process as well as\nthe denouement sense (Section 1). Death, in the process sense, unfolds\nover a period of time, and it obviously affects us while it\noccurs—even if instantly. \nWhat if we opt for the denouement sense of ‘death’? Is it\nplausible to say that losing the very last of life can have no affect\non us? It is difficult to see why. If we were correct when we said\nthat the complete destruction of our vital capacities affects us,\nsurely we are also affected, albeit less, by losing the very last of\nthe vital capacities that sustain us. \nLet’s review. Granting them some leeway, Epicureans can\nshow: \nThey can then argue as follows: \nFor a more rigorous presentation of the above argument, see the\nsupplementary document: \n\n The Argument: Death and Posthumous Events Don’t Affect Us\n  \nBut Epicureans lack a convincing argument against the possibility that\nthe dying process and some of its effects overlap in time; hence they\ncannot refute the harm thesis. We have a subject, harm, and time: the\nsubject of death is a live creature who endures its effects at the\nvery time the creature dies. \nInstead of trying to establish that death cannot affect us at all,\nEpicureans might argue that death cannot affect us in a way that\nis bad for us. To that end, they can provide a condition for\nsomething’s being bad for us and argue that death fails to meet\nit. \nThe condition which Epicurus himself supplied is this: an event (or\nstate of affairs) harms us only if it causes in us the presence of\nsome condition we find unpleasant. For simplicity, we can call all\nsuch conditions pain or suffering. That condition, the suffering, need\nnot occur at the same time as the event that causes its presence in\nus. An event may occur long before it has any direct impact on us; it\nmay occur even before we exist, as when someone times a bomb to go off\n150 years later, killing everyone around. Epicurus himself did not\nspell out a complete view of welfare. He did not make it entirely\nclear when things are, overall, beneficial or harmful to a person. But\nhe surely did think that something harms us only if it causes us to\nsuffer. \nSome theorists prefer to phrase Epicurus’s condition in terms of\nexperience, thusly: we are harmed only by what we experience. Given\nthat one never experiences one’s death, it would follow that it\ncannot harm those who die. A variant of this experience\ncondition was proposed by Rosenbaum (1986): we are harmed only by\nwhat we can experience. Other theorists state\nEpicurus’s condition in terms of existence, thus attributing to\nhim the existence condition: something harms us only at times\nwhen we exist. (For good discussions of the experience condition and\nits plausibility, see Nussbaum 2013, Silverstein 2013, and Fischer\n2014.) \nOn the Epicurean view, clearly neither the state nor process of death\nis inherently harmful—it is, in itself, not bad for us.\nFor death is not necessarily painful. One can die painlessly, as when\none dies while unconscious. But Epicurus did not say merely that death\nneed not be harmful; he claimed that death was never harmful;\non his criterion, this means that death never causes the subject to\nsuffer. \nTo show that death can have no salient effect on us, Epicureans might\nargue that death cannot be responsible for any\ncondition’s presence in us, salient or otherwise. It can only be\nresponsible for our ceasing to be in a condition. However,\nthis thesis is clearly false on the process sense of\n‘death:’ moving from being wholly alive to completely\nlacking life might well introduce the presence of some bad condition\nin us, such as pain. No doubt Epicureans gravitate to the denouement\nsense of death since the ending of the final trace of life might occur\nextremely quickly, perhaps so quickly that it has no salient effect on\nus while it happens. Nevertheless, Epicureans may argue, with some\ndegree of plausibility, that denouement death cannot harm us: \nBy combining 16 with 13, established earlier, Epicureans may conclude\nthat: \nHowever, this conclusion will disappoint people who wonder whether\ndying is a misfortune: they want to know whether losing their\nlives is a bad thing, not just whether, having nearly completely\nlost life, it is bad to lose the very last of it (Luper 2004). Even\nfor Epicurus himself this conclusion is not entirely adequate. For it\nleaves in place the possibility that the dying process can be\nharmful. \nSo why did Epicurus say that death is nothing to us? He surely knew\nthat the dying process can be harmful to us. One possibility is that\nhe did not really intend to show that death is innocuous. Many\ncommentators insist that he wanted only to show that being\ndead, that is, the state of death, is nothing to us, and that he\nrealized that dying is often a misfortune. It is also possible that\nEpicurus did not believe that what we have called ‘process\ndeath’ is part of death; instead, death is what we have called\n‘denouement death’. This line of thought would position\nhim to admit that ‘process death’ is bad for us, but it is\nonly the precursor to death. \nHowever, if Epicurus meant to show only that denouement death is\nharmless, or that the state of being dead is harmless, his efforts are\ndisappointing given his own goal, which was to enable us to achieve\nataraxia, or complete tranquility. He cannot reach this goal if he\ndoes not free us from our concern about the dying process or the\nevents leading up to the dying process.  \nThe best Epicurus could do is to downplay the painfulness of process\ndeath and its cause, and this he appears to do: \nUnfortunately, Epicurus was wrong; the dying process and its cause can\nbe excruciating. \nThere are things other than death that seem bad for us. To prepare us\nfor complete tranquility in the fact of these things, Epicurus would\nneed to address them as well. Let us consider some examples, and what\nEpicurus might say about them.  \nOne example is obvious: we suffer when we anticipate death. Epicurus\nwould probably admit that anticipating death is a bad thing if it\nupsets us. But he emphasizes that our (present) anticipatory fear is\nnot caused by our (future) death, since future events are powerless to\naffect the past. Hence, by the painfulness criterion, the fear of\ndeath is not grounds for saying that death is harmful. Moreover, fear\nis irrational unless its object is genuinely evil in some way, which\ndeath is not:  \nSomething else that is related to death seems bad for us: namely, the\ngrief others experience when we die. But Epicurus would urge us to\ndistinguish what is bad for us from what is bad for others. At most,\nthe fact that your family grieves at your death supports the claim\nthat your demise harms them, not that it harms you. (Too, your\ndistress at anticipating your family’s grief over your death is\nnot grounds for you to regard your death as a bad thing: the suffering\nyour death brings them cannot affect you, and your anticipatory grief\nis irrational.) Furthermore, their grief should be mitigated by the\nfact that your death is not bad for you. Their grief is entirely\nself-centered, exactly like the self-pity a stamp collector might feel\nat the destruction of a treasured stamp, in that the stamp is not\nharmed by its own destruction.  \nThese examples illustrate that Epicurus can address some death-related\nconcerns by showing that they are misguided, if we grant him his claim\nthat we can be harmed only by what causes us to suffer. However, some\ndeath-related concerns cannot be handled this way. For example, the\nfact that everyone dies causes us distress and is therefore harmful to\nus even on Epicurus’ criterion. At most Epicurus can say that\nmortality need not be harmful to us, and that it will not be if we can\nmanage not to be distressed by it (Luper 2009).  \nEpicurus’ case against the harm theses hinged on the assumption\nthat we can be harmed only by what causes us to suffer. However, in\nsection 3.1 we supported the harm theses by combining comparativism\nwith one of the three leading accounts of welfare. We noted that death\nand posthumous events seem harmful because they deprive us of goods we\nwould otherwise have had. If our argument was correct, then\nEpicurus’ assumption must be mistaken. It must be false that\nharm requires incurring pain. Instead, harm can consist in being\ndeprived of goods. \nAre there ways Epicureans could resist the view that being deprived of\ngoods can be bad for us? Perhaps. Epicureans could criticize\ncomparativism. They could also defend some view of welfare that is\nmore congenial to their position. Let us consider each strategy,\nstarting with the second. \nEpicurus may have accepted the following view of welfare: \nNegative Hedonism: \nfor any subject \\(S, S\\)’s experiencing pain is the one and only\nthing that is intrinsically bad for \\(S\\), and nothing is\nintrinsically good for \\(S\\).  \nWhen paired with comparativism, this view has implications that\nEpicurus would have welcomed. It implies that harm is limited to what\nincreases our pain, and benefit is limited to what reduces it.\nConsequently death is harmless to those who die painlessly, no matter\nhow good the life they would have had would have been. Moreover, death\ncan be beneficial: it can preclude our suffering. \nHowever, the implications of negative hedonism are quite absurd. For\nexample, it implies that we never have reason to endure pain for the\nsake of pleasure or any other good. It also implies that we should end\nour lives as quickly and painlessly as we can since living on will\nharm us and cannot possibly benefit us. The negative hedonist account\nof welfare is clearly false. \nPerhaps Epicureans would have better success if they were to reject\ncomparativism itself. To that end, they might adopt one of four\nstrategies which we will discuss in turn.  \nIt is quite possible that Epicurus himself rejected comparativism, as\nformulated above. Perhaps he thought that the harmfulness of an event\n\\(E\\) is not a matter of the good it deprives us of, but rather a\nmatter of how much intrinsic harm it causes, and the goodness of \\(E\\)\nis a matter of how much intrinsic good it causes. Earlier we let\n\\(B(S,W)\\) stand for the sum of the values of the things which are\nintrinsically bad for \\(S\\) in world \\(W\\), and we let \\(G(S,W)\\)\nstand for the sum of the values of the things which are intrinsically\ngood for \\(S\\) in world \\(W\\). Using this symbolism, we can state the\nfollowing alternative to comparativism: \nBifurcated Comparativism:\n\\(E\\) harms \\(S\\) if and only if \\(B(S,W_{E}) \\lt B(S,W_{{\\sim} E})\\);\n\\(E\\) benefits \\(S\\) if and only if \\(G(S, W_{E}) \\gt G(S,W_{{\\sim}\nE})\\).  \nBifurcated comparativism implies that goods do not offset evils, but\nmight eliminate them: that is, the goods \\(E\\) brings do not reduce\nthe harmfulness of \\(E\\) unless they cause us to have less pain or\nless of some other evil. Similarly, evils do not offset goods.\nCombined with positive hedonism, bifurcated comparativism implies that\nwe are harmed only by what increases our suffering, and benefitted\nonly by what increases our pleasure; all else is a matter of\nindifference. Epicurus might have been drawn to this combination\nbecause it implies that death can neither harm nor benefit us,\nignoring the pain it can cause while it occurs. \nHowever, bifurcated comparativism is implausible. One problem is its\nimplication that that goods and evils do not offset each other.\nAnother worry is that surely some events or states of affairs harm us\nwithout causing us pain or some other intrinsic evil, and benefit us\nwithout giving us pleasure or some other intrinsic good. It is better\nto be anaethetized before surgery, but not if bifurcated comparativism\nis true. Moreover, if I slip into a temporary coma, which precludes my\nsuffering from injuries inflicted upon me in a car crash, the coma\nbenefits me, even though it does not give me pleasure or other goods.\nSimilarly, a coma that precludes my enjoying a week’s worth of\ngood life harms me, yet gives me no pain or other evils. \nSurely death is capable of benefitting us the same way that\nanesthetization and unconsciousness can. It can preclude our enduring\ngreat suffering. Similarly, like anesthetization and unconsciousness,\ndeath can harm us by precluding our living well. Comparativism gets\nthings right and bifurcated comparativism gets things wrong in all of\nthese examples. \nComparativism assesses our interests in a temporally neutral way. It\nimplies that, at each point in my life, it is in my interests that my\nwelfare be as high as possible across my entire life, so that it is\nprudent for me now to do what will boost my welfare later, other\nthings being equal. Famously, Derek Parfit (compare McMahan 2002)\nsupplies grounds for assessing our interests in a temporally relative\nway instead of a temporally neutral way. Assessing our interests in a\ntemporally relative way may help Epicureans to undermine the harm\ntheses. \nConsider that sometimes we have no reason whatever to satisfy a\ndesire. Parfit gives two examples. First, a desire might be implicitly\nconditional on its own persistence, in the sense that we want to\nsatisfy it only on condition that we still have it. The desire to play\ncards is like this. We lose all reason to satisfy such desires as soon\nas we cease to have them. Compare desires, mentioned earlier, that are\nconditional on our persistence. We might have reason to satisfy these\nright up until our last day, even if we cease to have them much\nearlier. Second, Parfit notes, we might change our values or ideals,\nwhich might lead us to condemn some of our desires. In this case it is\nreasonable to forego any opportunity to satisfy them. When a property,\nsuch as conditionality, undermines the importance of satisfying a\ndesire for \\(P\\), so that \\(P\\)’s holding is not intrinsically\ngood for us (and \\({\\sim}P\\)’s holding is not intrinsically bad\nfor us), let us say that it is an undermining feature.  \nWhen we no longer want something, we may speak of a past desire.\nPerhaps a desire is undermined by being past, as Parfit has claimed\n(compare Suits 2001). Then Epicureans may be able to revive their\nattack on the posthumous harm thesis: dying ensures that we cannot be\nharmed by posthumous events, since we are without desires long before\nthese occur (Vorobej, 1998). This strategy does not seem to vindicate\ndeath itself, since death may preclude the fulfillment of some of the\nvery desires it destroys. However, the die-hard Epicurean might\nsuggest that a desire is undermined, in passing, at the very moment of\nits destruction; if it is later thwarted, no harm is done.  \nIn any case, it is far from clear that our interests should be\nassessed in a temporally relative way. The matter is quite\ncontroversial. Consider Parfit’s claim that our desires are\nundermined by their pastness: neutralists, who assess our interests in\nthe temporally neutral way prescribed by comparativism, can resist\nParfit’s claim by finding a feature other than pastness that\ntends to undermine desires that we no longer have. One possibility\nbecomes evident once we notice that most of our aims are tentative in\nthe sense that we adopt them in the expectation that we may later\nrevise them. An extreme way to revise a desire for \\(P\\) is to stop\nwanting \\(P\\) altogether—to end the desire for \\(P\\), say on the\ngrounds that it conflicts with other, more pressing interests. We\ndefer to future exercises of our own autonomy, realizing that we may\nreassess our priorities, until our life plan matures. In particular,\nwe are always prepared to revise desires in light of the projects and\ncommitments with which we identify, and loath to abandon projects and\ncommitments which have become parts of our identities. We favor some\nof the ways our desires change, and take what steps we can to coax\nthem in preferred directions. As a rough approximation, we may say\nthat, unless our desires change in ways we (do or) would oppose, the\nchanges are voluntary (Cf. Harry Frankfurt 1971). For our purposes we\ncan even count, as voluntary, the intentional elimination of a desire\nusing artificial means, as when we take pills to remove the desire to\nsmoke cigarettes. If we voluntarily stop wanting \\(P, {\\sim}P\\) can no\nlonger harm us. It will not harm us during the time we wanted \\(P\\),\nor later, when our desire is thwarted. So we undermine a desire when\nwe voluntarily abandon it (Luper 1987). On this view, Epicureans\ncannot show that desires are harmlessly thwarted by death and\nposthumous events on the grounds that such desires are past at the\ntime death or posthumous events thwart them. \nComparativism says that the value of my dying at time \\(t\\) depends on\nthe intrinsic goods (and evils) I would have accrued after \\(t\\) had I\nnot died, even though I am actually dead after \\(t\\). Being dead, I am\nincapable of accruing any intrinsic goods or evils after \\(t\\), and in\nthat sense I am unresponsive after \\(t\\). Interest actualism\ndenies that the value of my dying at \\(t\\) can depend on these goods.\nIt says that the value for \\(S\\) of event \\(E\\) is not affected by the\nintrinsic goods or evils \\(S\\) would have accrued had \\(E\\) not\noccurred, if \\(S\\) would have accrued them after \\(S\\) has actually\nbecome unresponsive. \nAccepting interest actualism would force us to modify comparativism.\nThe actualist view would be this: \nActualist Comparativism: \\(E\\)’s value for \\(S\\) equals\nthe intrinsic value for \\(S\\) of \\(S\\)’s life in \\(W_{E}\\), the\nactual world in which \\(E\\) occurs, minus the intrinsic value for\n\\(S\\) of \\(S\\)’s life in the closest world, \\(W_{{\\sim} E}\\), in\nwhich \\(E\\) does not occur excluding any intrinsic value \\(S\\) would\naccrue in \\(W_{{\\sim} E}\\) after \\(S\\) ceases to be responsive in\n\\(W_{E}\\).  \nHowever, actualist comparativism does not appear to be more plausible\nthan standard comparativism. If I die at \\(t\\), accruing goods after\n\\(t\\) is not in my interests-after\\(-t\\), but it does not follow that\nit is not in my interests. If developing and fulfilling certain\ndesires is entailed in making my life as a whole as good as possible,\nthen it is in my interests to develop and fulfill those desires. Even\nthough I will die before I develop and fulfill the desires, it is in\nmy interests to develop and fulfill them, and bad for me not to\ndevelop and fulfill them.  \nOne other line of thought might be pressed against the comparativist\naccount of interests. Comparativism says that something harms me when\nit makes my life worse than it would have been. However, there seem to\nbe events and states of affairs that do not harm me even though their\nvalue for me is negative. I am not harmed, it seems, by failing to be\na genius, or rich and beautiful. But compare my life as it is, with my\nunimpressive IQ, income and looks, to my life as it would be were I\nbrilliant or rich or beautiful: the former is considerably worse than\nthe latter. By failing to be brilliant, rich and beautiful, I am\nprecluded from having many goods, but we might say that the preclusion\nis moot, in the sense that it is harmless to me. Epicureans might\nrenew their attack on the harm thesis by exploiting examples like\nthese. The examples appear to show that things can have enormous\nnegative value for me without harming me. Similarly, Epicureans might\ninsist, the preclusion of goods by death is moot: cut short, my life\nis worse than it would be were I not to die, but this comparative\ndifference does not show that I am harmed. \nIt seems that the comparative criteria work well when we evaluate\nlosses, such as the loss of my arms, and also when we evaluate some\nlacks, such as the inability to see or to feel pleasure. But the\ncriteria have worrisome implications when we evaluate certain other\nlacks, such as my lack of genius. It is relatively clear that a person\nis harmed by the inability to see but less clear that he is harmed by\nthe lack of genius. Why is that?  \nThere are various responses to the problem of moot preclusion. One is\nto deny that it makes any sense to speak of\n‘negativities’, or events that consist in things not\nhappening. This does not stop us from evaluating the event or process\nof dying (as opposed to the state of death) which is not a\n‘negativity’. Comparativists are right to claim that\nthings harm us by making our lives worse than they would have been\notherwise; negativities are not counterexamples, since they do not\nexist. Another response is that moot preclusion involves cases in\nwhich the events or states of affairs that would be good for us if\nthey held are highly improbable (Draper 1999). A further explanation\ninvolves the relative importance of having some goods rather than\nothers. In some moods, we may consider it harmful to be deprived of a\ngood just when it is important for us to have it. The troublesome\nlacks we have been discussing might be lacks of goods it is\nunimportant to have; such lacks would not be harmful even though we\nwould be better off without them. \nIn section 3 we showed that the harm theses can be defended on the\nbasis of comparativism together with a plausible view of welfare. We\nalso considered ways of attacking this defense, and some possible\nresponses. In this section we consider another worry about the view\nthat death may harm its victims by depriving them of goods (or benefit\nthem by precluding their incurring evils). Roughly, the worry is this:\nsuppose we accept the presumption that something can harm a subject\nonly if there is a (period of) time when it does so. Let us call this\nthe Epicurean presumption. Then death can harm us by\ndepriving us of goods only if there is a time during which we are\nharmfully deprived. However, it is not clear that there \\(is\\) such a\ntime. If the Epicurean presumption is really true, then proponents of\nthe harm thesis will need to clarify when it is that being deprived of\ngoods harms a victim. In this section we will consider several\npossibilities. First, however, we will examine the Epicurean\npresumption itself. \nThere is more than one way to understand the Epicurean presumption. It\nmight mean this:  \nOn this reading, the presumption is surely true. But it is also quite\neasy to supply the time when something such as death is against the\ninterests of its victim. All it takes for an event to be against my\ninterests is that it makes my life as a whole worse than it would have\nbeen had the event not occurred. Suppose, for example, that I will be\ninfected tomorrow and, because of its effects on me during next week,\nthe infection will worsen my life as a whole. Then being infected is\nagainst my interests, period. That means it is against my interests\nnow and at all other times I exist. This may seem mysterious, unless\nwe notice that something’s being against my interests, according\nto the terms of comparativism, is not an event, and hence not an event\noccurring at some time. \nThere is another way to understand the Epicurean presumption. Recall\nthe distinction made earlier (at the end of 2.1) between my interests,\non one hand, and my interests-at-time-\\(t\\), or what makes me better\nor worse off at time \\(t\\), on the other. The Epicurean presumption\nmight be that harm affects my interests-at-\\(t\\), at some time \\(t\\),\nrather than my interests. That is, the presumption might be understood\nas follows:  \nNow, if comparativism is true, this version of the Epicurean\npresumption is false. To see why, let us distinguish between two ways\nin which something might be bad for me. On the one hand, something\nmight bring it about that, for a while, I am worse off than I would\nhave been. For example, a coma might prevent me from enjoying a\nweek’s worth of pleasant activities, so that, while comatose, my\nwelfare level would be lower than it would have been had I not fallen\ninto a coma. On the other hand, something might cause it to be the\ncase that my life as a whole is worse than it would have been.\nUsually, things that make our lives as wholes worse (such as comas) do\nso by making us worse off for a while. However, what makes our lives\nworse need not make us worse off for any period of time. Death can\nprevent me from enjoying years of pleasant activities, making my life\nas a whole worse than it would have been had I not died, even if I am\nnot worse off at any time during my life. Death is an injury to my\nlife as a whole. \nThe Epicurean presumption can be sustained if it is equated with P1,\nbut it is easy to point to the time when death is against the\ninterests of its victims: if it is against their interests at all, it\nis timelessly against their interests, according to comparativism. We\nmight call this view atemporalism, borrowing the term from\nJens Johansson (2013). (Johansson defines atemporalism this way:\n‘death is bad for the deceased but not at any time.’) If,\nby contrast, we equate the presumption with P2, we will look for the\ntime during which we are worse off because of death than we would have\nbeen had we not died, and worry about the fact that it is difficult to\nsupply that time. However, there is good reason to reject P2. We have\nalready seen that comparativism is extremely plausible, and P2 is\nfalse if comparativism is true.  \nEven if P2 is false, and death can harm us without leaving us worse\noff, there might still be times when, due to death or posthumous\nevents, we are worse off. Many theorists have offered explanations of\nwhen it is that we incur such harm. There seem to be five\npossibilities (and various combinations thereof): \nLet us consider each of the five. \nAccording to some theorists, Feldman (1991) argues for the eternalist\nview that my death is always bad for me if bad for me at all (but he\nmight instead intend to defend atemporalism, defined in section\n4.1). If my death harms me, it harms me while I am alive, while I am\ndead, and even before I came into existence. However, theorists (among\nthem Lamont 1998, Silverstein 2000 and Feit 2002) who interpret\nFeldman this way argue that he is wrong to accept eternalism. Suppose\nI stubbed my toe, and we ask ‘when was the stubbing bad for\nme?’ What exactly do we want to know? Perhaps we want to know\nwhen it is true that the stubbing was bad for me. If so, the answer\nis: ‘eternally, if ever.’ However, our question might be:\n‘at which times do I incur harm for which the stubbing was\nresponsible?’ If so, the answer is: ‘I incur that harm at\nall and only those times when my toe is throbbing as a result of the\nstubbing.’ A question concerning the timing of death’s\nharmfulness might be similarly ambiguous. In asking, ‘when is\nLincoln’s death bad for him?’ we might want to know when\nit is true that his death is bad for him. The answer is presumably\nthat it is an eternal truth.  Feldman appears to answer this first\nquestion. But his critics are looking for an answer to a second\nquestion, namely this: ‘at which times does Lincoln incur the\nharm for which his death is responsible?’ To this latter\nquestion it is absurd to reply that Lincoln is always incurring\nharm. \nThe termination thesis poses a significant obstacle to the\nsubsequentist view that, due to death and posthumous events, we may\nincur harm while we are dead. If, after a person dies, there is no such thing as that person, it appears to follow that there is no subject\nwho is a candidate for further harm. How can we make sense of the idea\nthat death or posthumous events can harm an individual after she has\ndied?  \nSubsequentists might adopt a metaphysical view that is sometimes\ncalled metaphysical eternalism (defended by Nagel 1970 and\nSilverstein 1980, among others). On this view, past and future objects\nare ontologically on a par with present objects. Existing things are\nspread out in both space and time. Suppose it is possible to refer to\nanything that is ontologically on a par with present objects. Then,\ngiven metaphysical eternalism, we can still refer to Socrates even\nthough ‘Socrates’ refers to something whose existence is\ntemporally located wholly in the past, and say of him that he is not\nalive. Perhaps, then, we can also make sense of the idea that people\nundergo harm while dead, assuming that harm can consist in the absence\nof some salient good: we can interpret “Socrates’ death\nharmed him while his life was over” as “The living\nSocrates lacked various salient goods during a time following his\ndeath.” \nIs it plausible to argue that dead people can still incur harm? There\nare significant obstacles to this view. Here are some relevant\nconsiderations: \nMany kinds of things whose reality few would question—boulders,\nnumbers, and my shoe, for example—cannot be harmed at all, and\ncertainly cannot incur harm at particular times, yet clearly lack\ngoods at particular times. Hence its lacking goods at some time does\nnot imply, of a thing, that it is incurring harm at that time. Let us\nsay that a creature is responsive at \\(t\\) just in case it\nhas the capacity to accrue at \\(t\\) the intrinsic goods or evils in\nwhich welfare consists. At those times when (living) people are\nresponsive, they may incur harm; because shoes are never responsive,\nthey can never incur harm. It seems reasonable to assume that while\nSocrates is dead he is not responsive, even if, by virtue of existing\nin the past, Socrates is ontologically on a par with things that exist\nwhile he is dead. Assuming he is unresponsive while dead, it is hard\nto take seriously the idea that he incurs harm then. \nRecent defenses of subsequentism seem vulnerable to the charge from\nunresponsiveness. According to Neil Feit (2002), Lincoln’s death\nwas bad for him, if at all, throughout the period he was deprived of\nlife. To determine whether, and when, dying at time \\(t\\) harms me, we\ncompare the situation in which I die at \\(t\\) to the situation (the\nnearest possible world \\(W)\\) I would be in were I not to die at\n\\(t\\). If I would fare better in \\(W\\), my dying at \\(t\\) harms me;\nroughly, it begins to harm me at the time when I begin to fare better\nin \\(W\\), and ends at the time when I cease to fare better in \\(W\\).\nBen Bradley (2004, 2009) refines Feit’s version of\nsubsequentism. According to Bradley, “death is bad for the\nperson who dies at all and only those times when the person would have\nbeen living well, or living a life worth living, had she not died when\nshe did.” Is subsequentism defensible on the Feit-Bradley\napproach? Perhaps, but they owe us an explanation of how it is that we\ncan incur harm, albeit by deprivation, during a stretch of time when\nwe are unresponsive. \nMany theorists who reject subsequentism assume that because death\ntakes a person out of actual existence, the dead are not\n“there” to be harmed.  Palle Yourgrau (2019) rejects this\nassumption.  He combines modal realism (the view that, like the actual\nworld, other possible worlds are concrete objects) with the thesis of\ntransworld identity (one and the same object exists in more than one\npossible world), and says that although a dead person no longer exists\nin the actual world, one and the same person is still alive, and\nexists, in other possible worlds.  We may deny that, after a person\nhas died, she is no longer real at all—not “there”\nto be harmed—because she still exists in other worlds, according\nto Yourgrau.   \nConcurrentism says we incur mortal harm precisely when death occurs.\nIt also says that those posthumous events that are bad for us harm us\nprecisely when they occur. One concurrentist, Julian Lamont (1998),\nputs the view this way: we incur deprivation harm at the time some\nevent ensures that we will not retain or attain some good that is\notherwise available. Call such an event an ensuring event.\nDeath may itself be an ensuring event, so death and at least many\ndeprivation harms may occur simultaneously. Similar reasoning might\nsupport the concurrentist story about when posthumous events harm us,\nfor, like death, posthumous events ensure that we will not attain some\ngoods we otherwise would have had, such as our not being slandered\nposthumously. The upshot is a unified story about when death and\nposthumous events harm us. \nHowever, the concurrentist story about when posthumous events harm\ntheir victims seems worrisome. The view is that posthumous events that\nare bad for us harm us precisely when they occur. The problem, of\ncourse, is that by the time posthumous events occur nothing remaining\nof us is capable of incurring harm. This is the point that was just\npressed against subsequentism. Nevertheless, concurrentists could be\ncorrect about when death harms us even if they are wrong about the\ntime we incur harm from posthumous events. Indeed, they could say that\nwhile death can harm us, posthumous events cannot. \nTo solve the timing puzzle, we might try rejecting one or more\nelements of the Epicurean’s causal account of responsibility,\nand see if there is a way to defend the priorist claim that death and\nposthumous events can harm the living. To defend priorism, we\nwill need to deny the assumption that a thing can affect us only\ncausally. For that assumption, together with the ban on backwards\ncausation, forces us to dismiss the idea that harm can occur\nbefore the event that precipitates it takes place. Yet, as\nGeorge Pitcher (1984) says, this is precisely the idea we need in\norder to understand the harmfulness of post-mortem events. They can\nharm us by being responsible for truths that affect our interests. For\nexample, being slandered while I am dead makes it true that my\nreputation is to be damaged, and this harms me at all and only those\ntimes when I desire that my reputation be untarnished. It is while I\nam alive that I care about my reputation’s always being intact,\nand it is while I am alive that my well-being is brought lower by\nposthumous slander. The posthumous events themselves harm me only\nindirectly; directly I am harmed by their making things true that bear\non my interests.  \nPitcher’s idea can be applied to death as well as post-mortem\nevents. Death can harm us by making things true that negatively affect\nour interests, in which case we incur harm during such time as our\nwell-being is lower than it otherwise would have been. For example,\ndying before I complete some treasured project ensures that “I\nshall never complete my project” is true of me; because of this,\nmy well-being is lower than it would have been, at such times as I am\ninterested in the success of my project.  \nAssuming that comparativism is correct, priorism is not a complete\naccount of the harmfulness of death and posthumous events, for\ncomparativism, supplemented with some form of the preferentialist\naccount of welfare, implies that death can be objectionable, in part,\nbecause it thwarts desires which we would have had and fulfilled had\nwe not died. Because we never actually will have such desires, we can\nnever be worse off if they are thwarted. Comparativism also suggests\nthat death is objectionable insofar as it precludes the pleasure which\nwe would have enjoyed had we not died, even if we never desired the\npleasure of which death deprives us. \nThere is another way to extend priorism. We might object to the\nstate of death, since coming to be dead makes it true of us\nthat we have desires that will be unfulfilled. But instead of saying\nthat being dead is objectionable, it seems better to say something\nelse, once we notice that the state of death is simply the state of\nnonexistence initiated by the event of death. Perhaps being dead is\npowerless to harm us since any harm that might be associated with it\nis entailed in, and brought about by, death itself, which is\nresponsible for limiting the duration of our lives, and all that that\nentails. \nThe last possibility—that death and posthumous events harm us\nbut at no determinate time (Nagel 1970; Silverstein 1980)—is\ncriticized by Julian Lamont (1998) on the grounds that it implies that\nsome events take place but at no particular time. But William Grey\n(1999) counters that Lamont has misunderstood Nagel’s (and\nGrey’s) indefinitist position, which is that the harm death\ncauses is incurred during a stretch of time that has blurry boundaries\n(compare: the time of the onset of baldness). \nAs Grey understands it, indefinitism is correct only if subsequentism,\npriorism or concurrentism is true (Grey opts for subsequentism), for\neven a period of time with blurry edges must occur before, after or at\nthe same time as a mortem event (eternalism is an exception since an\ninfinite period has no boundaries to blur). \nEternalism, the position that those who are harmed by death are always\nincurring harm, is surely wrong. Subsequentism is more plausible, but\nit is hard to make sense of the idea of incurring harm posthumously,\nsince we are not responsive while dead. The indefinitist view, as we\nhave understood it, is also unhelpful; it tells us that the boundaries\nof the time death harms us are blurry, yet fails to say when that time\nis. Concurrentism or priorism, or some combination of the two, seem to\nprovide the most promising answers to the timing problem (the problem\nof specifying when a victim incurs the harm for which death and\nposthumous events are responsible). It does seem reasonable to say\nthat death may harm us while it occurs. It is far less plausible to\nsay that posthumous events may harm us while they occur, since we are\nnot responsive then. It is also plausible to say that both death and\nposthumous events may harm us while we are alive, for living people\nmay have interests that depend on what happens in the future. \nAt this time it is worth repeating what was stated in section 4.1:\nproponents of the harm theses do not need a solution to the timing\npuzzle, for something can harm us timelessly; that is, it can be\nagainst our interests even if there is no time \\(t\\) at which, because\nof it, we are worse off at \\(t\\) than we would have been otherwise. As\ncomparativism says, anything that makes our lives worse than they\notherwise would have been is against our interests. This death usually\ndoes. But at no time after death are we worse off than we would have\nbeen had we not died, for the simple reason that we do not exist.\nDeath might make us worse off while it occurs; however, it, and a\nposthumous event, might also make us worse off before it occurs, since\nit may be against the interests we once had. \nAre all deaths misfortunes? Perhaps, but there is a strong case to the\ncontrary. \nTo support the conclusion that death is not always a misfortune, we\nmight adopt some version of preferentialism. Perhaps it is not bad to\ndie at an advanced enough age, for people who live long enough may be\nground down by life until they give up many of their goals. Also, they\nwill have attained many of their aspirations. If already satisfied, or\ngiven up, a desire cannot be thwarted, even by death, so as we lose\nour motivation for living, death ceases to be objectionable to us.\nPerhaps death is bad for us only if premature in the sense that it\ncomes when we still have interests such as salient desires that propel\nus forward in life, and only if meeting these interests is a real\nprospect. \nWe are left to wonder whether death would ever cease to be\nobjectionable were we not ravaged by bad health and other\nhardships. Bernard Williams (and others, such as Kagan 2012) argues that it would be bad to live\nforever, even under the best of circumstances. His view is based on an\nassumption about the relationship between our identities and the\ndesires that motivate us to live. \nConsider a woman who wants to die. She might still take the view that\nif she is to live on, then she should be well fed and clothed. She\nwants food and clothing on condition she remain alive. In this sense\nher desires are conditional, and do not give her reason to\nlive. Contrast a father who is committed to rearing a beloved\ndaughter: he desires unconditionally that the child do well, and his\ndesire gives him reason to live, because he can rear his child only if\nhe survives. In this sense, his desire is categorical, or\nunconditional. Williams thinks that categorical desires are essential\nto identity, and give meaning to life. Through categorical desires, we\nare attached to projects or relationships that are definitive of the\nself; faced with their destruction, we would feel our lives are\nmeaningless, and that in an important sense we cannot survive as the\npersons we once were. \nThe bearing on death, according to Williams, is, first, that people\nhave good reason to condemn a death that is premature in the sense\nthat it thwarts their categorical desires. Second, mortality is good,\nsince people who live long enough eventually will lose the categorical\ndesires with which they identify. Life will lose its novelty, and\noppressive boredom will set in. To avoid ennui, superseniors would\nhave to replace their fundamental desires, again and again. But this\nis to abandon their identities; it is tantamount to death. \nAs Williams says, lives of unimaginative routine will eventually grow\nstale if extended long enough. Of course, this is not supposed to\ncomfort ordinary mortals, most of whom will die long before routine\nundermines the joy in living. However, as several theorists, including\nNagel (1986, p. 224, n. 3) Glover (1977, p. 57), and Fischer (1994)\nhave suggested, it is not obvious that life must become dull. Williams\nmay have overlooked how rich and complex life can be, especially for\nsuperseniors who pursue multiple open-ended projects in the company of\nother superseniors. His response to this kind of criticism is that\neven rich and open-ended projects eventually will become routine (say\nafter a few billion years), so our pursuits must be replaced\nperiodically if we are to remain interested in life. But to phase in\nwholly new projects is to lose our identity. \nWilliams’s response faces objections. First, we might avoid\nboredom by adding to our pursuits, and varying the way we approach\nthem, without abandoning certain core interests that define us.\nSecond, Williams is working with a view of identity that may be too\nnarrow. Many of us would welcome a possibility that he downplays:\ngradually transforming our interests and projects over time.\nTransformation is not death. It is distinct from, and preferable to,\nannihilation. Transformation would be death only if identity were\nwholly a matter of retaining (most of) our psychological features over\ntime. However, it is questionable that persistence requires this kind\nof connectedness. Even if our persistence hinges on our psychological\nfeatures, transformation need not be death, since transformation is\nconsistent with the gradual, continuous change of our psychological\nfeatures. If we could live endlessly, the stages of our lives would\ndisplay reduced connectedness, yet they could be continuous, which is\na property that is important in the kind of survival most of us prize.\nEven after drinking at the fountain of eternal youth, we would tend to\nfocus on relatively short stretches of our indefinitely extensive\nlives, and over these periods we would prize connectedness, since we\nare animated by specific projects and relationships that can be\ndeveloped only if there are strong interconnections among the temporal\nstages of our lives. However, sometimes we would turn our attention to\nrelatively long stretches of life, and then, prizing continuity, we\nwould phase in new and worthwhile undertakings that build upon, and do\nnot wholly replace, the old. \nEven if death is usually bad for those who die, perhaps it\nneed not be bad for us, if we prepare ourselves suitably.\nThis might be possible if some form of preferentialism is true, and\nif, by altering our desires, we could cease to have any interests that\ndying would impair. For then we might be able to thanatize\nour desires, in this sense: abandon all desires that death might\nthwart. Among these are desires we can satisfy only if we live on for\na few days, but also desires we cannot possibly satisfy within the\nspan of a normal lifetime, and the desire for immortality itself.\nInstead of desiring that some project of mine succeed, which is a\ndesire that might be thwarted by my death, I might instead adopt a\nconditionalized version of this desire, namely: should I live on, let\nmy project succeed. If all goes well, thanatizing would insulate us\nfrom harm from death by leaving us with no interests with which dying\ninterferes.  \nUnfortunately, this strategy will backfire. The main problem is that\ndeath can interfere with desire fulfillment not just by falsifying the\nobjects of our desires but also by precluding our having desires\n(Luper 2013). So even if we resolve, from now on, to limit ourselves\nto desires whose objects cannot be falsified by death, we are still\nvulnerable to the harm death will do us if it precludes our having and\nfulfilling desires. Hence thanatizing would force us to avoid having\nany desires whose fulfillment would have benefitted us, and to deny\nourselves such desires would be as bad for us as the harm we are\ntrying to avoid. \nHowever, the core idea of adapting our desires is useful, if not taken\nto an extreme. It is prudent to avoid taking on goals we cannot\npossibly attain, and hence prudent to eschew projects that cannot\npossibly be completed during the course of a normal lifetime.","contact.mail":"sluper@trinity.edu","contact.domain":"trinity.edu"}]
