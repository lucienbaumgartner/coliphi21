Philosophers of science from the\nsubcontinent have expanded their presence ever since. This article\naims to provide an overview of philosophy of science in the\nsubcontinent. The primary focus is on contributions produced in Latin\nAmerica by thinkers living in the region, with an emphasis on\n“mainstream philosophy of science”—a discipline\ncentered on the study of scientific knowledge, metaphysics,\nmethodology, and values, broadly analytic in style, as exemplified by\nworks published in high-quality journals such as Philosophy of\nScience, Erkenntnis, The British Journal for the\nPhilosophy of Science, and Studies in the History and\nPhilosophy of Science.\n\n This entry has four parts. Section 1 provides historical\nbackground.  Section 2 is devoted to philosophy of science activity in\nvarious regional centers through the early 1990s when the Internet and\nimproved institutional resources “globalized” the practice\nof philosophy of science, greatly blurring earlier geographical\nseparations. The two following sections focus on the last decades:\nSection 3 presents contributions to the general philosophy of science,\nand Section 4 reviews advances in the philosophy of special\nsciences. The final Section 5 briefly considers some of the\ndifficulties and prospects for philosophy of science in Latin\nAmerica.\n\n\nIn this article effort is made to provide an even-handed and objective\npicture, but of course only a selective sketch is possible, made of\nchoices influenced by the authors’ interpretation of the\nfield.\n\nIt is useful to begin with a brief historical background. Science and\nscientific thought have long functioned in Latin America as beacons of\ncivic hope and progress amidst multiple recurrent frustrations that\nvary in kind and texture from place to place. In most of the region,\nthe Enlightenment ideals that fueled independence movements of the\nearly nineteenth century were quickly disappointed by the chaos and\ngeneral barbarism that followed in much of the region until the 1860s.\nIt was different in Brazil, where emancipation from Europe occurred\ngradually and orderly during the century, but there too problems\ngrew as did also tensions between the economic elite and the\ncountry’s leading liberal thinkers. \nReacting against expanding frustration, many Latin Americans saw a\nsolution in the “scientific” ways of thinking dominant in\nthe industrialized countries. In the 1850s a progressive philosophy\nwas in full flight in the larger world, ready-made for Latin American\nvisionaries: French Positivism, a doctrine of progress and secular\nreligion, centered on hope in modern science, led by Auguste Comte.\nCommitted to fighting the temptations of barbarism, the positivists\nsought to continue the project of the Enlightenment. Against the\nimpulsive approach to decision-making then prevailing in most of Latin\nAmerica, local positivists sought to extend scientific thought to\nphilosophy and political action, convinced it would promote\nobjectivity, rational consensus, publicly accessible cumulative truth\nin all spheres, along the material success characteristic of modern\nscience. Between about 1870 and 1910 positivism took strong hold in\nmuch of Latin America, with an agenda that called for methodological\nimprovement in the local practice of the natural sciences, medicine,\nand education, also greatly influencing activity in philosophy,\nhistory, art, and law (see, e.g., Frondizi 1943, Zea 1943–44,\nNachman 1977, Quintanilla 2006). In Argentina, scientism and\nComte’s philosophy had influential defenders, notably Domingo\nFaustino Sarmiento, many scientists (e.g., paleontologist Florentino\nAmeghino), physician-philosophers (e.g., José Ingenieros and\nAlejandro Korn), educators (e.g., Pedro Scalabrini), and lawyers\n(e.g., Carlos Octavio Bunge, whose nephew Mario A. Bunge would become\nan international figure in philosophy of science in the following\ncentury). A conviction these thinkers shared stated that a modern and\nefficient system of public education was indispensable for achieving\nthe desired transformations. Interest in advancing the positivist approach\ngrew to religious heights especially in Brazil, where it was\nchampioned by distinguished political figures, notably Miguel de\nLemos, a reorganizer of the country’s curriculum and a decisive\nforce in the construction of the first Humanity Temple for the\npropagation of Comte’s ideas in the world. When Brazil became a\nrepublic in 1889, positivist doctrine made its way to the new flag,\nthe motto “Order and Progress” lifted from Comte’s\nwritings—in Système de Politique Positive\n(1851), the preliminary discourse’s conclusion begins with the\nwords “Love for principle, order for base, and progress for\naim” (L’amour pour principe, l’ordre pour base, et le\nprogrès pour but; p. 321). \nThe influence of positivism in Mexico was nearly as strong,\nparticularly in education, as exemplified by the labors of the\nrespected chemist and medical doctor Gabino Barreda, who banned\nreligion and traditional philosophy from the school curriculum and\ncentralized access to higher education and culture. In Chile, the\nbrothers Jorge and Enrique Lagarrigue were two leading advocates of\nComte’s philosophy and his Humanity Religion. In Colombia, Rafael\nNuñez, an educational reformer and three times president of\nColombia, actively promoted positivism, as did in Peru (with touches\nof Herbert Spencer’s evolutionism) such figures as Javier Prado,\nManuel González Prada, Celso Bambarén, and Manuel\nVicente Villarán. In Bolivia, positivism also had influential\ndefenders from the 1870s through the 1890s, notably a circle of\nwriters, “Círculo Literario”, in whose\njournal works by Charles Darwin, Luis Dumont, Ernst H. P. A.  Haeckel\nand other naturalists appeared in translation. \nWith all this intellectual and progressive enthusiasm in the air,\nhopes of imminent general improvement ran high, but\n“positive” results were slow in coming. The expectations\nof economic advancement and civic improvement did not materialize as\nadvertised. To compound matters, the devastation caused by the Great\nWar in Europe badly compromised social faith in the products of\nscience. Positivism waned accordingly in Latin America, replaced in\nthe 1920s by a more radical social thought, especially Marxism, as well\nas approaches distrustful of naturalist reasoning (Bergsonian\nspiritualism, phenomenology, and later existentialism). Metaphysics\nunbridled by standard logic became dominant in many university\ncircles.  Reactions to excessively “high philosophy” began to\narise in the 1940s, helped by the arrival of thinkers from Europe, for\nexample Juan David García Bacca in the cases of Ecuador,\nMexico, and Venezuela, Hans Lindemann in Argentina, and Gilles-Gaston\nGranger in Brazil. Along the way came a revival of interest in logic,\nscience-friendly epistemology, and the study of conceptual structures.\nThanks to these developments, when philosophy of science became a\nprofessional field in the late 1940s, Latin America had some\nscientists and philosophers ready and willing to fully join their\ncounterparts in Europe and North America. Since then, for the past\nseventy years, a number of philosophers of science based in Latin\nAmerica, often in uncooperative environments, have managed to produce\nwork of the highest international standards (something not so clearly\napparent in the developing world in other branches of international\nphilosophy). \nBy the mid 1990s, academic centers in Latin America began to benefit\nfrom the kind of world-wide interaction made possible by the Internet,\nelectronic libraries, and improved forms of institutional support for\nintegration and travel. With geographical and institutional barriers\ngreatly reduced, the field expanded considerably. Over the last\nthree decades virtually every theme in philosophy of science would\ndevelop a presence in works produced in Latin America. Dialogue and\ncollaboration between researchers now transcend the traditional local\nboundaries. This new global environment makes less relevant the\ntraditional geographical approach to philosophical production in the\nregion. Accordingly, Sections 3 and 4, devoted to activity from the\nmid 1990s on, structure the subject around themes, concepts, and\nprinciples (rather than around geography and individuals). \nPhilosophy of science developed a robust presence at Universidad\nNacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), a major institution\nat the forefront of intellectual life in the country and the\nSpanish-speaking world. The discipline gained strength in the 1960s\nand early 1970s through the efforts of prominent faculty members,\nespecially Fernando Salmerón, Luis Villoro, and Alejandro Rossi\nwho encouraged rigor and clarity in philosophy and provided\nscholarship support to enable students to do post-graduate work in\nEurope, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Together they\nfounded the journal Crítica in 1967, a choice venue\nfor philosophy in Latin America and Spain. An influential work by\nSalmerón, La Filosofía y las\nMatemáticas, came out the following year. Major\ninternational seminars and meetings became a regular feature at\nUNAM’s Institute for Philosophical Investigations (Instituto\nde Investigaciones Filosóficas—IIF), which in the\n1970s and 1980s hosted some now legendary seminars and short courses\nled by world-class figures. One of these international seminars\nfocused on the history and philosophy of science, started by Mario\nBunge (Argentina and Canada). IIF became the host of many spirited\nphilosophical debates, those between Bunge and Héctor-Neri\nCastañeda (Guatemala and the United States) being among the\nmost prominentely remembered. With Bunge’s help, in 1976 an\nepistemology forum was established—Asociación\nMexicana de Epistemología. At the beginning of the 1970s,\nMario Otero (Uruguay) formally joined IIF with a considerable effect\non the studies of the philosophical history of science. \nThe structuralist approach came to Mexico in a big way with Carlos\nUlises Moulines who moved to IIF from Munich in the mid-1970s. Born in\nVenezuela, he studied in Europe, first under the supervision of\nJesús Mosterín in Barcelona and then of Wolfgang\nStegmüller in Munich. His early focus was on the rise of the\nlogical empiricist approach, particularly the projects of logical\nreconstruction of the empirical world variously advocated by Bertrand\nRussell, Rudolf Carnap, and Nelson Goodman; Moulines developed these\ninvestigations in his first monograph, La Estructura del Mundo\nSensible (1973). He took an interest in integrating some of\nStegmüller’s original contributions into earlier\nstructuralist work by Patrick Suppes in the United States and Gunther\nLudwig in Germany, an effort displayed by some of his articles from\nthis period (notably Moulines 1975, 1976). Responding to the\nhistorical turn in philosophy of science, Moulines, like Joseph Sneed\nin the United States and Stegmüller in Germany, focused on the\nissue of theory change. He devoted much of his research during the\n1970s and 1980s to the dynamics of theories, applying the resources of\ndiachronic structuralist reconstruction and Kuhnian analysis (in terms\nof disciplinary matrices) to the development of Newtonian mechanics\nand equilibrium thermodynamics. The resulting investigations were\npresented in the book Exploraciones Metacientíficas\n(1982). Moulines became an important intellectual force at IIF where\nhe stayed for over a decade, engaged in cutting-edge research that\nmade him a leading figure in the international structuralist\nmovement. In Moulines’ view, scientific theories are cultural\nconstructs of philosophical interest. He regards philosophy of science\nas a discipline whose epistemology is primarily interpretive rather\nthan prescriptive or descriptive—a theorization about\ntheorizations. A good proportion of the philosophy of science\nconducted at IIF during his tenure was directly influenced by him. A\nrelevant point for present purposes is that his work in Mexico during\nthese years reached the highest levels within the worldwide\nstructuralist movement. In 1984 Moulines left the country, first to\nBielefeld University, then to Berlin, and finally to the Center for\nMathematical Philosophy at Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich,\nwhere he became Stegmüller’s successor and is now a\nProfessor Emeritus. Many of his subsequent publications had a lasting\nimpact in Latin America, notably An Architectonic for Science: The\nStructuralist Program (Balzer, Moulines, and Sneed 1987), along\nmany papers.  Research seminars at IIF continued to develop and strengthen in\nthe 1980s with a series of international symposia of philosophy\nstarted by Enrique Villanueva and continued by León\nOlivé, a venture of impressive scale that brought together\nworld-class figures from many parts of Latin America, the United\nStates, Britain, and Europe. The high-quality interactions these\nvenues generated proved remarkably fruitful as starting points of much\nsubsequent research activity in Mexico and elsewhere in the\nsubcontinent. This period was also marked by institutional investment\nin specialized research libraries and the reinforcement of publishing\nprograms at UNAM and other institutions in Mexico. Scholarship\nprograms helped researchers and students spend periods at major\ninternational centers. At IIF philosophical research reached a level\nof support never seen before in Latin America. Significant papers and\nmonographs began to flow regularly from seminars on general philosophy\nof science, the philosophy of physics, and the philosophy of\nbiology. \nActivity in the field also became more diverse at IIF in the 1980s.\nOne major area focused on the limits of scientific knowledge,\nrepresented by Luis Villoro’s 1982 critique of scientism in\nCreer, Saber, Conocer, where he advocates a revaluation of\n“wisdom” (characterized as knowledge drawn from lived\nexperiences), which in Villoro’s view is richly found in the\n“wise men” of traditional cultures; in this book he\nexplores how human reason has operated throughout history and the\nextent to which it has led to situations of domination and/or\nemancipation from subjection. \nIt is important to emphasize that the professionalization of the\nphilosophy of science in Mexico was achieved mainly through the\ncreation of specialized degree programs. Nowadays, the Posgrado en\nFilosofía de la Ciencia, founded at UNAM in 1993, is the\nprogram where most of the new generations now working in the\ndiscipline in Mexico have been trained. \nAn influential textbook by Gilles-Gaston Granger, Lógica e\nFilosofia das Ciências —first published in\n1955—is acknowledged as the first introduction to the field in\nPortuguese. A disciple of Gaston Bachelard, Granger taught at the\nUniversity of São Paulo (USP) from 1947 to 1953 and was a major\nforce in the development of philosophy of science in Brazil. His work\nfavored a historically-oriented approach hospitable to the Anglo-Saxon\nanalytic style. Back in Europe he associated himself with various\nphilosophical and social projects; in 1986 he was elected to the Chair\nof Comparative Epistemology at the Collège de France.\nThe research projects Granger started in Brazil continued after his\ntenure, especially thanks to the efforts of Oswaldo Porchat. \nIn 1964 a military coup led to government action eradicating academics\nsuspected of leftist sympathies, seriously disrupting many fields,\nincluding philosophy of science. Nevertheless, faculty groups were\nsoon able to restore activity. In 1970, at USP João Paulo\nMonteiro managed to start Ciência e Filosofia, a\njournal dedicated to logic and philosophy of science from a plurality\nof perspectives. Revitalization of the discipline continued throughout\nthe decade with timely research projects, often carried out in\nconjunction with international visits and courses, notably ones\norganized by Porchat, first at USP and after 1975 at State University\nof Campinas (UNICAMP), where he headed a new unit, Centro de\nLógica, Epistemologia e História da Ciência\n(CLE), whose members included Zeljko Loparic and other distinguished\nscholars. In 1977 CLE launched the prestigious journal\nManuscrito, supplemented in 1980 by Cadernos de Filosofia\ne História da Ciência, and in 1987 by a book series\n(Coleção CLE). CLE quickly became a symbol of\nhope for philosophers and historians of science as well as logicians.\nIn particular, CLE is involved in the articulation of\n“Paraconsistent Logic”, a field Newton C. da Costa began\nto develop in the late 1950s and early 1960s when he was working at\nFederal University of Paraná. Da Costa is one of the most\ncharismatic and energetic thinkers in Latin America, a world-class\nfigure in mathematics, logic, and philosophy of science, with a widely\nrecognized reputation for original works on non-classical logics, the\naxiomatization of scientific theories, and structuralist philosophy of\nscience, orientations that continue to be active in Brazil with such\nfigures as Itala D’Ottaviano and Walter Carnielli. \nIn philosophy of science CLE supports significant research on the\ncharacter and structure of modern science as well as its concepts and\ntheories—conducted from a variety of perspectives, including\ninvestigations in science teaching and the uses of philosophy of\nscience in education. Critical dialogue has been fostered through\nseminars, distinguished international visits, research funding,\nfaculty and student exchanges, interdisciplinary studies, and the\npublication of monographs and papers by Brazilian authors as well as\ntranslations of major works into Portuguese. Post-graduate studies and\npostdoctoral fellowships in logic and philosophy of science are\nthriving accordingly at UNICAMP. One scheme developed by CLE to\nattract promising faculty recently graduated from institutions\nworldwide produced excellent results. In the 1980s Michel Ghins and\nHarvey Brown energized analytic activity on space-time physics. Steven\nFrench did likewise in advancing the model-theoretic approach and the\nmetaphysics of quantum mechanics at Campinas. With the help of these\nand other recruits, philosophy of physics, mathematics, and formal\napproaches to the philosophy of science thrived. At Campinas, French\nand da Costa started a long-lasting collaboration that proved\nremarkably fertile, resulting in influential contributions to current\ndebates on the metaphysics of quantum mechanics, structuralism, and\nthe semantic approach to theories, as well as a fresher way of looking\nat the concept of truth (“pragmatic truth” and\n“partial truth”). These collaborations led to many papers\n(Da Costa and French 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993) as well as a book in\n2003, Science and Partial Truth: A Unitary Approach to Models and\nScientific Reasoning, which received international acclaim for\nthe light it casts on philosophical logic, structuralism, and\nrealism. Brown and French made Brazil their country, and it is easy to\nimagine how different the geography of philosophy of physics and\nmathematics might have turned out had circumstances in Brazil been a\nlittle kinder to academic life in the 1980s. Together with da Costa,\nthe international recruits and the local talents they began to nurture\nwould have probably turned CLE and USP (where Otávio Bueno had\nworked with da Costa) into top centers for philosophy of science in\nthe world. Destiny dictated otherwise, however; Ghins left to a\nprofessorship at Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium; Brown moved to a\ndistinguished career at Oxford, where he is now professor of the\nphilosophy of physics; and French went to the United States and then\nback to England where he is now professor of philosophy of science at\nthe University of Leeds and Editor-in-Chief of The British Journal\nfor the Philosophy of Science. Brown and French have each served\nterms as presidents of the prestigious British Society for the\nPhilosophy of Science. Happily, all these international old members\nmaintain productive ties with Brazilian groups. CLE has continued to\nprosper over the last two decades. \nPhilosophical activity has expanded in Brazil at many other\ninstitutions since the 1990s, as described in the following\nsections. \nAs with the previous countries, the field developed a presence in the\nAndean countries in the early days of professional philosophy of\nscience. \nIn Venezuela, Juan David García Bacca, a critic of Francisco\nFranco, was forced to leave Spain and arrived in Caracas in 1946 after\nperiods in Ecuador and Mexico. He led a productive career at the\nFaculty of Letters and Philosophy, Central University (Universidad\nCentral de Venezuela, UCV). In the mid-1930s, after completing a\ndoctoral dissertation on the logico-genetic structure of the physical\nsciences, García Bacca joined the Vienna Circle. In Latin\nAmerica he became a prolific writer, his works including\nTeoría de la relatividad (1941), La\nfísica (1962), Historia filosófica de la\nciencia (1963), Teoría y metateoría de la\nciencia, Vol. I (1977) and Vol II (1984). He remained a major\nforce in Caracas until 1971. In the 1970s and 1980s, Andrés\nKalnay led a small group interested in the foundations of quantum\nmechanics, first at UCV’s School of Physics and then at\nVenezuela’s leading center for scientific research,\nInstituto Venezolano de Investigaciones\nCientíficas. Presently UCV runs a master’s program\nin logic and philosophy of science coordinated by Franklin\nGalindo. \nPhilosophy of science in Colombia has long-enduring ties with\nContinental European schools, but analytic philosophy of science has\nnot been absent. Already in the 1950s Mario Laserna at Universidad\nde los Andes (Uniandes), Bogotá, promoted the study of\nlogic and the scientific philosophy of Hans Reichenbach. Subsequently,\nlocal groups, helped by international visitors, have played a\nconsistent role in the country, notably Gonzalo Munévar, a\nColombian philosopher of science now based in the United States, who\nvisits regularly his country. \nActivity in Peru started early in the 1950s, as attested by gatherings\norganized at Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (UNMSM,\nPeru’s oldest university) and Sociedad Peruana de\nFilosofía, both in Lima. Broad interest is also reflected\nin articles published in the 1950s and 1960s in the weekly literary\nsupplement of “El Comercio” by Oscar\nMiró-Quesada, Francisco Miró-Quesada, and other\nintellectuals interested in logic, science, and mathematics. Francisco\nMiró-Quesada, the country’s leading philosopher, was one\nof the pioneers in the development of modern philosophical logic and\nscience studies in Latin America, where he has indefatigably\nencouraged hope in the power of human reason. Miró-Quesada\ntaught at UNMSM for more than two decades, and then at Universidad\nCayetano Heredia (UPCH) and other centers in the country. He also\nheaded institutes for philosophical research, first at Universidad\nde Lima and subsequently at Universidad Ricardo Palma.\nMiró-Quesada was the author of numerous works in the area of\nphilosophy of science, including a book in the philosophy of\nmathematics, Filosofía de las Matemáticas\n(1954). He has also been a champion of research in logic in the region\n(it was Miró-Quesada who suggested to name Newton da\nCosta’s approach “paraconsistent logic”, which he\nhelped to promote). Miró-Quesada’s most heartfelt project\nfocused on the study of human reason, regarded as the capacity to\nreach truth, broadly understood, as outlined in his preliminary book\nApuntes para una Teoría de la Razón (1962),\nfollowed in 2013 by Esquema de una Teoría de la\nRazón, in which Miró-Quesada discusses the pursuit\nof rational validity in logic, science, metaphysics, and ethical\ntheory. In the early 1970s, young faculty trained in Europe and the\nUnited States expanded and updated the philosophical study of science\nin the country, particularly at UNMSM. Timely contributions were made,\nespecially by Luis Piscoya (philosophy of psychology and general\nphilosophy of science), Juan Abugattas (philosophy of science),\nJulio-Cesar Sanz-Elguera (philosophy of science), and David Sobrevilla\n(philosophy of the social sciences). Ever since, at San Marcos,\nLuís Piscoya has been working on the interface between\nphilosophy of science and education; he is the author of\nInvestigación Científica y Educacional: un Enfoque\nEpistemológico (1995), and numerous papers (e.g., Piscoya,\n1993). In the late 1970s, an innovative program in philosophy opened\nat UPCH, one of the leading research universities in the\nsubcontinent. Under Francisco Miró-Quesada, many international\nworkshops, seminars, and courses took place in Lima as part of this\nventure. From the late 1980s on, activity at UPCH continued through a\nprogram named “Scientific Thought”, headed by Alberto\nCordero, with the collaboration of Sandro D’Onofrio and other\nfaculty members. \nIn Chile, meanwhile, Gerold Stahl, Nathan Stemmer, and Augusto\nPescador made logic a major field in Chile in the 1960s. Later in the\ndecade, Roberto Torretti published a seminal book, Manuel Kant.\nEstudio sobre los Fundamentos de la Filosofía\nCrítica (1967; revised edition 2005). His subsequent work\non Kant led him to wider research on the philosophical history of\nscience, a field that had a growing audience, especially in Santiago.\nHowever, life in Chile became increasingly challenging as the decade\nprogressed. In 1970 Torretti left to Puerto Rico, where he continued\nto develop his philosophical work, especially on nineteenth-century\ngeometry and the theory of relativity. In 1973 a ruthless military\ndictatorship took over the government. It was a difficult time for\nacademia; Chile’s leading journal, Revista de\nFilosofía, ceased publication and remained dormant until\n1977. Although the institutional environment suffered greatly at most\ncenters, quality research continued in logic, as evidenced by\ninternationally acclaimed contributions during the period by Rolando\nChuaqui and others. \nNearly always based in Latin American centers (Chile and Puerto Rico),\nTorretti is an icon of rigor and philosophical sense and an author of\nworld-class level contributions; his writings are celebrated for his\ninsightful commentaries and educated perspectives on the rational\ndevelopment of ideas, especially in Galileo, Newton, Leibniz, Kant,\nnineteenth-century mathematics, Helmholtz, Poincaré, and\nEinstein. Torretti’s major publications on these subjects have a\nsecure place on the reading lists of leading seminars in philosophy of\nscience anywhere, in particular Philosophy of Geometry from\nRiemann to Poincaré (1978), Relativity and\nGeometry (1985), Creative Understanding: Philosophical\nReflections on Physics (1990), and The Philosophy of\nPhysics (1999), each an authoritative work in the philosophy and\nthe philosophical history of science. In the years that Torretti spent\nat the Rio Piedras Campus of Universidad de Puerto Rico, he\nled a fruitful career until his retirement in 1995. During most of\nthis period he was the editor of Diálogos, one of the\nleading philosophy journals in Latin America. \nOn the eastern side of the southern cone, developments of considerable\ninternational impact took place in Argentina between the 1940s and\n1970s. The arrival of Hans Lindemann in the 1940s marked a turning\npoint in analytic philosophy in Argentina where his discussions of\nthe philosophy of Bertrand Russell and the Vienna Circle (he had\nstudied under Moritz Schlick and been a member of the Circle)\nencouraged further activity, in particular research seminars and\ncourses by Mario Bunge, Gregorio Klimovsky, and Julio Rey Pastor.\nThroughout the 1950s, the Buenos Aires area enjoyed a decade of\noptimism about the academic and cultural possibilities of philosophy\nof science and its applications. Several centers prospered,\nparticularly two that were founded in 1952. In one of them,\nInstituto Libre de Estudios Superiores, Klimovsky and Rolando\nGarcía discussed the “logical empiricist” approach\nand gave courses that systematically presented the new philosophy to\nwider audiences. The other center was Círculo\nFilosófico, led by Bunge, where his book\nCausalidad (1959a) and other works of the period took shape,\nand their central materials were presented in lectures and\ndiscussions. Bunge and Klimovsky managed to secure chairs at\nUniversidad de Buenos Aires (UBA) in philosophy of science\nand logic, respectively. In the mid-1950s, their research and courses\nturned the university into a world-class place in the\nfield. Bunge’s administrative and cultural efforts during this\nperiod put a strong emphasis on making professional philosophical\nactivity possible in Argentina. A new association for logic and\nscientific philosophy, Agrupación Rioplatense de\nLógica y Filosofía Científica, was founded\nin 1956, aimed at drawing together thinkers from Argentina and Uruguay\nwho wanted to study philosophy in the rational and rigorous style of\nthe new approach, with Bunge, Klimovsky, Jorge Bosch, Gino Germani,\nand Rolando Garcia among its members. A consistent group began to\nform, resulting in such achievements as Cuadernos de\nEpistemología, a series that gave the whole of Latin\nAmerica and Spain access to key works in the field translated into\nSpanish. \nIn Causalidad, Bunge (1959a) focused on the empiricist\nconception of causality and its shortcomings, blaming the empiricist\noutlook for having created unnecessary confusion and pessimism in\nphilosophy. In this work Bunge distinguishes causal determination from\nother forms of determination (structural, teleological, dialectical,\nand statistical), telling apart three different senses in which the\nterm “causality” enters scientific discourse—as a\nlaw stating that same causes produce same effects, as a relation\nbetween cause and effect, and as a principle stating that everything\nhas a cause. The book came out in 1959, gaining considerable\ninternational reception, especially due to the realist conception it\narticulates. Causality also marks a turning point: philosophy\nbooks one may call “classics” were now coming out of Latin\nAmerica and finding a place in mainstream reading lists in the\nEnglish-speaking world and Europe. A citizen of the world, perhaps the\nmost universalist of philosophers in the subcontinent, Bunge is\nnonetheless very South American (it is hard to imagine him growing up\nanywhere else but in cosmopolitan Argentina). Bunge has always been a\nsocially engaged intellectual, a trend already present in his efforts\nas founder and secretary general of a college for workers,\nUniversidad Obrera Argentina, from 1938 until 1943. He has\nremained a spirited spokesman for the need to maintain in Latin\nAmerica cultural and educational institutions capable of promoting the\npractice of philosophy by minds free from ideological pressure,\nfinancial oppression, and political or governmental control. First in\nArgentina and then elsewhere, Bunge has been at “war”\nagainst, as he puts it, the kind of uncritical understanding of\nphilosophy he found prevailing at the Faculty of Philosophy and\nLetters when he joined in the 1950s, laboring to inspire a lasting\nsense of professional rigor in his students and collaborators. The\nseries he launched, Cuadernos de Epistemología, had a\nsubstantial impact on scientists, philosophers, and the educated\npublic in the Spanish-speaking world. Bunge’s production during\nthese years was remarkable; apart from Causality, other works\nof relevance are Bunge (1959b, 1960, 1961a, 1961b, 1962a, and\n1962b). Unfortunately, these accomplishments were not achieved without\nfriction with colleagues and groups sympathetic to alternative ideas\nBunge could not respect. In addition, the country’s political\nand economic conditions were deteriorating. Early in the 1960s,\ninternal fractions within the Argentine army began to make civic life\nincreasingly difficult. Bunge left the country in 1963, first to the\nUnited States (where the Vietnam War and other political developments\nmade him uncomfortable), then moving in 1966 to McGill University,\nMontreal, where he remains to this day. \nFew thinkers associated with analytic philosophy strive to produce a\ncomprehensive philosophical system. Bunge is one of them, a thinker\ntrying to integrate ontology, metaphysics, epistemology, semantics,\npsychology, and science coherently and fruitfully. Thus far\nBunge’s publications make more than fifty books and hundreds of\nphilosophical and scientific articles, mostly in English and Spanish;\nhis main works were also translated into German, Italian, Russian, French,\nHungarian, and Portuguese among other languages. His works of\ngreatest impact in mainstream philosophy of science are arguably\nCausality (1959a), The Myth of Simplicity (1963),\nand Foundations of Physics (1967). Bunge’s search for a\nnaturalist vision worth having was given systematic expression in his\nTreatise on Basic Philosophy (an eight-volume work published\nbetween 1974 and 1989). More recent publications by Bunge include\nEmergence and Convergence: Qualitative Novelty and the Unity of\nKnowledge (2003), Chasing Reality: Strife over Realism\n(2006), and Medical Philosophy: Conceptual Issues in Medicine\n(2013), as well as his much-awaited autobiography Memorias entre\nDos Mundos (2014), to mention a fraction of his abundant\nproduction.  In his oral presentations and seminars, Bunge pays forceful and\nparticular attention to the evaluation of the arguments at hand,\nchampioning the use of logic as an expediter of clarity of thought. He\nis renowned for his scathing critiques of positions that demean\nreason, the search for truth, and the universality of science,\nscientific naturalism, as well as positions that fail to respect human\nbeings as individuals. Bunge enthusiastically endorses the way in\nwhich the Enlightenment tried to disseminate conceptual and moral\ntools to revise and improve human thought and life in general.\nBunge’s works steadily emphasize the idea that science can lead\n(and has often led) to what he regards as the only sensible foundation\nfor social and political action: relevant knowledge of the world.\nImportantly, early on in Latin America Bunge played the role of a\nmuch-needed exemplar, a leading thinker who in the 1960s became a\n“possibility proof” that philosophers working in the\nsubcontinent could, despite the often bizarre difficulties academics\nface, stand up and join the philosophical conversation at the highest\nlevels. No Latin American philosopher had achieved anything comparable\nbefore in cosmopolitan philosophy. \nLosing Bunge was a major blow, one of many as the decade unfolded.\nWhen the military intervened the universities in 1966, many of the\nmost talented minds in science and the humanities fled the country.\nKlimovsky remained, however, and his presence helped keep the\ndiscipline active during this difficult period, first at UBA and then\nat Belgrano University from the late 1970s until his death. Philosophy\nof science did not stop in Argentina, young talent continuing to\narise, notably Alberto Coffa, at Universidad de la Plata until he too\nleft to the United States. The surrounding turmoil was a negative\nfactor, yet a remarkable period of expansion began at the end of the\ndecade, marked by the foundation of the Sociedad Argentina de\nAnálisis Filosofico (SADAF), a model institution supported\nby its own members, in which fellows and invited international guests\nmeet around topics of philosophical interest, including many of\ncentral importance in philosophy of science. A major journal saw the\nlight in Buenos Aires in 1975: Revista Latinoamericana de\nFilosofía, followed in 1981 by another important\nperiodical, Análisis Filosófico. \nActivity in philosophy of science has grown in the country since then,\nas the remaining sections of this article describe. \nAlthough Gregorio Klimovsky was one of the founding fathers of the\nphilosophy of science in Argentina, he was still active until the\nfirst decade of the twenty-first century. He introduced mathematical\nlogic and axiomatic set theory in Argentinian universities and\ndefended a hypothetico-deductive method close to that of Popper, not\nonly for natural sciences but also for social sciences. At the turn of\nthe century, he published three books that were very relevant in\nuniversity education (Klimovsky 1994, Klimovsky and Hidalgo 1998,\nKlimovsky and Boido 2005). Moreover, his autobiography (2008) presents\na vivid portrayal of the inception of analytic philosophy of science\nin Argentina. But perhaps the most important merit of Klimovsky was\nhaving been the teacher of several generations of Argentine logicians\nand philosophers of science such as Tomás Moro Simpson,\nRaúl Orayen, and Alberto Coffa. \nThe interest in Popper’s theses reappears in the work of Carlos\nVerdugo (2009). By contrast, Alejandro Cassini (2003) argues for the\nadvantages of the Bayesian theory of confirmation over the\nhypothetico-deductive method. \nThe semantic approach to scientific theory was studied by\nGermán Guerrero Pino (2008, 2010), who compared van\nFraassen’s proposal with that of the structuralist school. In\nturn, Juan Manuel Jaramillo Uribe (2009, 2014) builds a bridge\nbetween metatheoretical structuralism with other philosophical\nschools, such as French structuralism and structural realism. Pablo\nLorenzano has also developed sustained work in the field of\nmetatheoretical structuralism (Balzer and Lorenzano 2000, Lorenzano\nand Díez 2002, Lorenzano 2013), particularly applied to\nbiology, leading a research group with young members of different\nLatin American countries.  We noted that Francisco Miró-Quesada’s most heartfelt\nproject focused on the study of human reason, regarded as the capacity\nto reach truth in logic, science, metaphysics, and ethical theory\n(1962, 2013). In turn, from a perspective that defends rationality\nagainst the attacks of postmodern thought, Ricardo Gómez (2003)\ndevelops a strong criticism to Rorty’s arguments. A very radical\nposition is adopted by Gonzalo Munévar (1981) who considers the\nrationality of science a social property that should be understood in\nterms of biological performance. \nIn Mexico the interest in the rationality of science led to the\npublication of two relevant volumes on the subject, one compiled by\nAmbrosio Velasco (1997) and the other by Velasco and Ana Rosa\nPérez Ransanz, and Ambrosio Velasco (2011); the second contains\nmore than 40 contributions of Iberoamerican authors and offers a wide\npicture of the discussion on the matter in the region. In particular,\nSergio Martínez (2003) focused on the relationship between\nrationality and scientific practices.  More recently, problems of the empirical equivalence between\ntheories and the underdetermination of theory choice were addressed by\nPablo Acuña, particularly in the case of Lorentz’s ether\ntheory and Einstein’s special relativity (Acuña and Dieks\n2014, Acuña 2014a). Acuña (2014b) also analyses three\nartificial cases of empirical equivalence, arguing that they are not\nthe result of practice of real science but cooked up by philosophers\nof science. \nAs a consequence of his close collaboration with Jean Piaget (Piaget\nand García 1971, 1987), Rolando García became the author\nwho still represents genetic epistemology in Latin America (1997). In\nparticular, he developed with Piaget the idea of a parallelism between\npsychogenesis and the evolution of sciences (Piaget and García\n1983). More recently, García (2000) linked genetic epistemology\nwith the theory of complex systems.  Already in the nineties, Oscar Nudler began to develop a view of\nthe dynamics of science in terms of conflicts (1990). This view became\na well-articulated model based on what he called “controversy\nspace” (Nudler 2002, 2004): a dynamic structure composed of\ninter-related controversies, with a “focus”, composed by\nthe issues that are the main object of the disagreements, and a\n“common ground”, which consists of the commitments not\nsubject to discussion within the controversy space. Controversy spaces\ntypically change by re-focalization which occurs when certain\nassumptions move from the common ground to the focus. This model was\nsuccessfully applied to different scientific cases, such as the\norigins of chaos theory, the debate about the relations between\nchemistry and physics, the origins of molecular biology, and the\ndevelopment of twentieth century American linguistics, among others\n(see Nudler 2011). \nThe philosophy of Thomas Kuhn attracted the interest of many Latin\nAmerican philosophers of science. For instance, during the 1980s, some\nCuban scholars focused on the Kuhnian concept of scientific revolution\n(Núñez 1985, 1989). In Uruguay, Mario Otero (1997)\nedited a volume about Kuhn with contributions from his research\ngroup. After his retirement, the group was left in the hands of\nLucía Lewowicz, who continued that line of research (2004,\n2005), focusing particularly on the Kuhnian notion of taxonomic\ncategory (2007). In Colombia, the research group of Jaramillo Uribe\nalso compiled a collective volume devoted to the philosophy of Kuhn\n(Jaramillo Uribe et al. 1997) and, in a more recent book, Guerrero\nPino (2003) considered the relevance of the Kuhnian philosophy for\nscience education. In Argentina, Nélida Gentile (2013)\npublished a book on incommensurability commemorating the 50th\nanniversary of The Structure. The book Kuhn y el Cambio\nCientífico, by Ana Rosa Pérez Ransanz (1999),\ndeserves particular attention, for it has been much discussed in the\nSpanish-speaking world and, as a consequence, was reprinted two times\n(2000, 2012).  After getting his PhD under the supervision of Paul Feyerabend,\nGonzalo Munévar became one of the main international\nspecialists on the philosophy of the author (see the compilation of\nhis articles in Munévar 2006). Moreover, Munévar (1998)\nadvocates for an evolutionary philosophy that leads to a thorough\nevolutionary relativism of scientific knowledge which, nevertheless,\nis not an obstacle to a theory of relative truth.  Christián Carman worked extensively on the problem of\nrealism in science. He offered a detailed elucidation of the term\n“scientific realism” (2005a), and he considered the\ntheoretical-observational distinction in light of the problem of\nrealism (2005b). Carman also critically analyzed Harré’s\ninductive argument for scientific realism (2005c). Moreover, he\nreformulated the no-miracle argument in order to apply it to\nsimultaneous predictions (2010b), in particular in the context of\nPtolemy’s planetary theory (Carman and Díez 2015). \nRecently, some surveys of the arguments regarding the problem of\nrealism have been produced. For instance, Bruno Borge (2015)\nreconsiders the no-miracle argument 40 years after its formulation,\nand Borge and Gentile (2019) compiled a volume on the subject with\ncontributions from Latin American authors. \nAfter the strong influence of logical empiricism and its claim for the\n“unity of science”, in the last decades of the twentieth\ncentury many pluralist approaches were proposed from different\nperspectives. In Latin America, different pluralistic views have been\nadvanced. \nAlthough Félix Schuster was a student of Mario Bunge and\nGregorio Klimovsky, he directed his interest to social sciences. In\nthis field, he defends methodological pluralism as the way to access\nsocial reality (Schuster 1992). \nRoberto Torretti’s view of scientific knowledge finds its roots\nin his interpretation of Kant’s philosophy (Torretti 1967).\nAccording to Torretti, it does not follow from the transcendental\ndeduction of the categories that they are contained in a definitive\nand immutable list; by admitting that the patterns ruling the\nconstitution of the objects of knowledge may change, “Kant opens\na wide door to intellectual pluralism” (2008: 87). From this\nperspective, Torretti (2000) explicitly rejects the scientific realism\nthat conceives the aim of science as the development of a discourse\nthat “cuts reality at its joints”, and agrees with Hilary\nPutnam’s pragmatic realism (Putnam 1987) on the basis\nof some examples drawn from past and present scientific practice.  Also under the influence of Putnam, but now of his internal\nrealism (Putnam 1981), Olimpia Lombardi and Ana Rosa Pérez\nRansanz (2012) propose an ontological pluralism that, instead of being\napplied to the problem of theory change, finds its main fertility in a\nsynchronic sense: when theories embodying different conceptual schemes\nare simultaneously accepted, it must be admitted that different\nontologies may coexist since each one of them is constituted by its\ncorresponding theory. This view, which denies the ontological\ndependence of the supposedly “secondary” disciplines or\n“phenomenological” theories regarding those fields\nconceived as “fundamental”, has been applied to the\nrelationship between chemistry and physics with the purpose of\ndefending the ontological autonomy of the physical world (Lombardi and\nLabarca 2005); this view has sparked an intense debate in the field of\nthe philosophy of chemistry (it will be considered below, in the\nsubsection about the philosophy of chemistry). \nThe role played by models in science was studied in Latin America\nsince the first years of the twentieth century. In México,\nAlfredo López Austin (2005) compiled a volume including five\ncontributions that explore the meaning and the nature of scientific\nmodels. Recently, Mario Casanueva and Ximena\nGonzález-Grandón (2016) edited a special issue of the\njournal Scientiae Studia, whose articles fall into two\ngroups: those in the first group emphasize that models amplify our\ncapacities of representation, perception, and calculation; those in\nthe second stress the function of models in legitimating scientific\nknowledge.  Also very recently, Alejandro Cassini paid close attention to the\nnature of scientific models. In particular, he criticizes\nfictionalism, which conceives models as useful fictions (Cassini\n2013), and contends that every scientific model has a target against\nthose who claim that some models do not (Cassini 2018). In turn,\nHernán Accorinti (2015a, 2015b) discussed the problem of the\nautonomy of models with respect to theories, with applications to\nchemistry; in particular, to atomic and molecular models in quantum\nchemistry (Accorinti and Martínez González 2016,\nAccorinti, Fortin, and Martínez González 2018) and to\nthe different models of electronegativity (Accorinti 2019). \nAlthough not directly concerned with models, an interesting volume\nabout the epistemic role of images in science was published as the\nresult of a workshop held in Mexico D.F. in 2007 (Casanueva and\nBolaños 2009). In the introduction to the volume, the editors\nrefer to the “pictorial turn” to stress the\nincreasing relevance of pictorial representation as an epistemic\nvehicle for science, where “pictorial” includes not only\nvisual pictures but also tactile and auditory representations. \nAlthough Mario Bunge’s already classical book Causality\n(1959a) was a landmark in the study of causation, it was only several\ndecades later that the interest on causation took off in the region.\nEduardo Flichman developed a “deflationist” view of\ncausation according to which causation is not an ontological relation\nbetween events but an anthropomorphic asymmetric relation that\nspeakers project over reality. From this perspective, Flichman (1989)\ncriticized the counterfactual theory of causation proposed by David\nLewis (1973) by showing that clear cases of causation can be\nmeaningfully reversed and, therefore, challenge the supposed asymmetry\nof causation. \nThis criticism sparked an interesting debate in the Mexican journal\nCritica during the 1990s. Dorothy Edgington (1990) accepted\nFlichman’s criticism as an argument against the possibility of\nanalyzing the concept of causation. Horacio Abeledo (1995), in turn,\nshowed that there would be a “formal” way out of\nFlichman’s criticism, but with no philosophical support. From an\nopposite perspective, Helen Beebee (1997) explicitly responded to\nFlichman’s argument and to Abeledo’s conclusion by arguing\nthat the putative counter-example presented by Flichman is not in fact\na counter-example after all. Both Flichman and Abeledo reacted to\nBeebee’s paper. On the basis of a refutation of Beebee’s\nargument, Flichman (2000) elaborated on his criticism of Lewis’s\ntheory and his defense of an acausal position. Finally, Abeledo (2000)\noffered a clear and detailed summary of the whole controversy, adding\nnew arguments against Beebee’s view but stressing his\ndisagreements with Flichman’s position.  Other Latin American authors were interested in causation. For\nexample, Sergio Martínez (1997) provides a detailed review of\nthe role of causation in scientific explanation along the history of\nscience. In Santiago de Chile, Wilfredo Quezada Pulido leads a\nresearch group mainly devoted to study physical causation. In his\npublished works, Quesada Pulido (2002) compared the theories of causal\ntransference, of causal processes, and of conserved quantities, and\nanalyzed the manipulability theory of causation in the light of the\nproblem of anthropomorphism (2007). More recently, Fernanda Samaniego\nappeals to the manipulability approach to define a notion of\n“explanatory depth” (2014) and to account for spin-echo\nexperiments (2013, 2015).  His work on causation led Flichman (1990, 1995) to discuss the\nconcept of scientific law: according to him, the distinction between\nlaws of nature and accidental uniformities depends on the role they\nplay in a scientific theory; moreover “hard” and\n“soft” accidental uniformities must be carefully\ndistinguished because the latter are frequently confused with laws of\nnature. Pablo Lorenzano (1998, 2007) also reflects upon the concept of\nlaw of nature in relation to the existence of biological laws.  The history of science from a philosophical perspective has been\nextensively studied in Latin America. For instance, in Argentina\nGuillemo Boido has strongly promoted the area; his book on Galileo\n(Boido 1996) not only offers a historical narrative, but also explains\nhistoriographic discussions in light of the historical record. In\nColombia, Mauricio Nieto Olarte (2000, 2007) developed relevant\nresearch work on the origins of science in the region during the\ncolonial period. In Mexico, Laura Benítez published several\nworks on early science (e.g., Benítez 1993, 2000, 2004), and\ndeveloped a long and fruitful collaboration with José Antonio\nRobles about science in Modern times (e.g., Benítez and Robles\n2000, 2006; Robles and Benítez 2004). Also in México,\nGodfrey Guillaumin (2005) studied the historical evolution of the\nnotion of scientific evidence.  Some philosophers of science of the region also manifested their\ninterest in particular events of the history of science. For instance,\nPablo Mariconda analyzed Galileo’s tide theory (1999), the\nsimple machines designed by Galileo (2008), and Galileo’s\nargument for the autonomy of science (Lacey and Mariconda 2012). He\nalso studied the method of astronomy according to Kepler (Tossato and\nMariconda 2010).  In turn, Alejandro Cassini and Marcelo Levinas developed a\nfruitful collaboration studying different aspects of the history of\nphysics at the beginning of twentieth century, particularly regarding\nEinstein’s works: Einstein’s reinterpretation of\nMichelson-Morley experiment (Cassini and Levinas 2005), his\nexplanations of photoelectric effect (Cassini and Levinas 2008;\nCassini, Levinas, and Pringe 2015) and of the Compton effect (Cassini,\nLevinas, and Pringe 2013), his reinterpretation of Fizeau experiment\n(Cassini and Levinas 2019), as well as the role played by the ether in\nthe conceptual change to special relativity (Cassini and Levinas\n2009). In the quantum context, Olival Freire Jr. (2015) published a\nbook that traces the passionate foundational controversies that\naccompanied the ripening of quantum physics during the second half of\nthe twentieth century.  The works of Christián Carman deserve a special mention\nsince they make him a top-ranked international specialist in ancient\nastronomy due to their quantity and quality. His first works focused\non Ptolemy’s calculations and explanations (Carrman 2009, 2010a,\n2011, 2015; Recio and Carman 2018), but soon his interest expanded to\nother authors, such as Aristarchus (2014), Martianus Capella (2017a),\nCopernicus (2018), and Heraclides of Pontus (2017b). In an additional\nline of research, Carman collaborated with the renowned scholar James\nEvans in a detailed study of the Antikythera mechanism which resulted\nin several very relevant works (Evans, Carman, and Thorndike 2010;\nCarman, Thorndike, and Evans 2012; Carman and Evans 2014). Carman\ndeveloped further his analyses of the mechanism, in some cases in\nsingle-authored works and in other cases in collaborartion with other\ninternational scholars (Anastasiou, Seiradakis, Carman, and Efstathiou\n2014; Carman and di Cocco 2016; Carman 2017c). Finally, Carman has\nrecently extended his collaboration with Evans beyond the original\ninterest in the Antikythera mechanism, examining other issues in\nancient astronomy (Carman and Evans 2015). \nIn Latin America, the discussions about science and values have\ntraditionally focused on the question of the dependence of scientific\nresearch in Latin American countries on the agenda set by central\ncountries. Due to their local interest, most of the material was\nwritten in Spanish. In 1971, a debate, remembered until today for its\nphilosophical and political significance, confronted Oscar Varsavsky\nand Gregorio Klimovsky in Argentina. For Varsavsky (1971), since\nscience is essentially ideology-laden, ideology must appear explicitly\nin scientific policy as a guide toward a new social order. Klimovsky\n(1971), by contrast, advocated for a neutral basic science: politics\nappear mostly in the application of scientific knowledge. The original\ndebate was complemented with the contribution of other prominent\nArgentine thinkers, and appeared in 1975 as the book Ciencia y\nIdeología. Aportes polémicos (Klimovsky et\nal. 1975). In the same year, Jorge Sabato compiled a significant book\nwith articles by more than twenty specialists about ideology in\nscience, relations between science, technology, and society, the\nstructural scientific-technological dependence of Latin America, the\nproduction of technology, and the planning of scientific-technological\ndevelopment in Latin American countries. The lively debates of those\nyears were drastically interrupted by the military coup\nd’état in Argentina in 1976.  The claim for a Latin American science, guided by regional\ninterests and ideological views, is in resonance with those\nphilosophical and sociological studies, like that of Enrique Dussel\n(1995) which denounces the Eurocentric “myth of modernity”\nthat justifies the superiority of European culture over Native\nAmerican cultures. In turn, the need to contextualize scientific\nknowledge in the framework of social needs of a particular community\nalso appears in the works of Rolando García (1981) under the\nconcept of interdisciplinary research, that is, a research that\ncombines different theoretical approaches in the search for solving\nlocalized social requirements.  Whereas the above contributions focused mainly on natural science,\nthe interest in how social knowledge is produced in Latin America has\ngrown during the last decades. An example of this interest is the book\nof Leandro Rodríguez Medina (2014) which examines the\ncirculation of knowledge within globalization, focusing on the\ndifferences between centers and peripheries of knowledge production in\nthe social sciences, and in the ways in which foreign ideas shape\nperipheral fields.  Two philosophers of science, who are well-known in the Latin\nAmerican communities, were also very interested in issues connected\nwith social and political values in science, although from different\nperspectives. Since the 1990s, León Olivé (1988 [1993])\nstood at the interface between the philosophy and the sociology of\nknowledge, trying to explain the double nature of knowledge as a\nsocial construct and a representation of reality. More recently, his\ninterest focused on how technology has pervaded contemporary society,\nmodeling both knowledge and values (Olivé 2007).  Ricardo\nGómez, by contrast, develops his position in open confrontation\nwith neoliberalism (2002, 2017a). On this basis, he considers that the\nethical dimension of science and technology should stand against\nneoliberal principles from a clear political position (Gómez\n2017b). \nThe interaction between scientific activities and values has been the\ninterest of Pablo Mariconda (Lacey and Mariconda 2014a, 2014b). In\nparticular, Mariconda (2014) discusses the technological risks\nassociated with transgenic agriculture. Along the same lines, Guillemo\nFolgera analyzes the techno-scientific discourse regarding genetically\nmodified organisms (Folguera, Carrizo, and Massarini 2014) and\ndenounces the omission of risks in the use of such organisms (Francese\nand Folguera 2018).  In the context of science, society, and values, studies that\ncombine the reflection upon scientific knowledge with gender matters\nmust be mentioned. For instance, Fabrizzio (now Siobhan) Guerrero Mc\nManus (2016) provides Spanish-speaking readers with an overview of a\nfeminism that seeks to develop a critical framework aimed at\ndetecting, exposing, and correcting the many gender biases nowadays\npresent in the sciences. In this context, the works of Diana\nMaffía cannot be forgotten since she has critically analyzed\nthe links between gender and science in the past twenty years or so\n(e.g., Maffía 2001, 2005, 2006, 2007; Rietti and Maffía\n2005). \nAlthough Mario Bunge and Roberto Torretti were central figures for the\nphilosophy of physics in Latin America, their early emigration\nprevented them from starting research lines around their works. As a\nconsequence, the development of the philosophy of physics in the\nregion is relatively recent.  Quantum mechanics is one of the focuses of the research group led\nby Olimpia Lombardi which developed its work in two directions: the\ninterpretation of the theory and the analysis of the meaning of\ndecoherence. Regarding the first topic, Lombardi and Mario Castagnino\nproposed the modal-Hamiltonian interpretation of quantum mechanics: a\nrealist, non-collapse interpretation that endows the Hamiltonian with\na determining role. The interpretation proved to be effective in\nexplaining ideal and non-ideal measurements and many other well-known\nphysical situations such as hydrogen atom, Zeeman effect, fine\nstructure, etc. (Lombardi and Castagnino 2008). The interpretation was\nreformulated in a Galilean invariant form (Ardenghi, Castagnino, and\nLombardi 2009; Lombardi, Castagnino, and Ardenghi 2010), and was\napplied to further situations, such as the non-collapse account of\nconsecutive measurements in physics (Ardenghi, Lombardi, and Narvaja\n2013), the understanding of quantum decoherence (Lombardi, Ardenghi,\nFortin, and Castagnino 2011), the view of quantum measurement in\ninformational terms (Lombardi, Fortin, and López 2015), and the\nproblem of optical isomerism in chemistry (Fortin, Lombardi, and\nMartínez González 2016, 2018). In addition, the\nmodal-Hamiltonian interpretation proposes a bundle-of-properties\nontology that adequately accounts for contextuality and\nindistinguishability (da Costa, Lombardi, and Lastiri 2013; da Costa\nand Lombardi 2014), but without preventing the emergence of particles\nunder certain particular circumstances (Lombardi and Dieks 2016).  By stressing the distinction between collapse and decoherence,\nOsvaldo Pessoa (1997) criticized the assumption that decoherence\nsolves the measurement problem. Following Pessoa’s view,\nCastagnino, Sebastian Fortin, and Lombardi (2010) deepened the\ncriticisms of the orthodox approach to decoherence (see also Lombardi,\nFortin, and Castagnino 2012; Fortin and Lombardi 2014, 2017), proposed\na new approach for closed systems (Castagnino and Lombardi 2004;\nFortin and Lombardi 2018), and developed a general conceptual\nframework for decoherence in closed and open systems (Castagnino,\nLaura, and Lombardi 2007). On the basis of this new perspective, the\nresearch group offered a particular view of the classical limit of\nquantum mechanics (Castagnino and Lombardi 2005; Fortin and Lombardi\n2016) and applied it to the problem of defining the quantum ergodic\nhierarchy (Castagnino and Lombardi 2007; Gómez and Castagnino\n2014). \nIn the subtle frontier between logic and physics, Décio Krause\ndeveloped an impressive work related to the quantum challenges to\nthe notions of identity and individuality. Already in his PhD\ndissertation, under the supervision of Newton da Costa, Krause\nsupplied a semantics to the so-called “Schrödinger\nlogic” (da Costa and Krause 1994, 1997) designed to account for\nelementary quantum particles. This work led him to formulate his\nquasi-set theory (Krause 1991, 1992, 1996a, 1996b), according\nto which there are urelements for which identity makes no sense.\nKrause’s semi-extensional quasi-set theory was compared with the\nintensional quaset theory developed by Maria Luisa dalla Chiara and\nGiuliano Toraldo di Francia (dalla Chiara, Giuntini, and Krause 1998),\nand was applied to particular problems in the foundations of quantum\nmechanics (Sant’Anna and Krause 1997; Krause, Sant’Anna,\nand Volkov 1999; Krause 2000; Domenech, Holik, and Krause 2008). \nKrause also developed an intense collaboration with Steven French to\ndevelop a concept of individuality for the quantum ontology (Krause\nand French 1995, 2007; French and Krause 1995, 1999, 2003); they also\nadvanced some ideas about individuality in quantum field theory\n(French and Krause 2010). This collaboration gave rise to a very\nrelevant book on the matter (French and Krause 2006), which discusses\nthe problem of individuality in philosophy and in classical and\nquantum physics and articulates quasi-set theory as a theory for\nnon-individuals.  More recently, Krause produced a relevant collaborative work with\nJonas Arenhart, his former PhD student, about quantum\nnon-individuality (Krause and Arenhart 2012, 2016a) and its\ncompatibility with Einstein’s realism (Krause and Arenhart\n2014). They also examined the view of quantum particles as individuals\nin a primitive sense (Arenhart and Krause 2014a, 2014b). This\ncollaboration led to a recent book about the logical foundations of\nscientific theories (Krause and Arenhart 2016b). In recent years,\nKrause also worked with da Costa in the application of paraconsistent\nlogics to physics (da Costa and Krause 2014, 2016).  Still in the field of the interpretation of quantum mechanics,\nElías Okon and Daniel Sudarsky (2014a, 2014b) criticized Robert\nGriffiths’s consistent histories approach by arguing that it is\ninterpretively vague and does not solve the measurement problem. These\nworks were rebutted by Griffiths (2015), and the rebuttal was\nimmediately answered by Okon and Sudarsky (2015a) by claiming that the\nconsistent histories interpretation introduces anthropomorphic terms\nnot contained in the formalism. In turn, based on Okon and\nSudarsky’s criticism, Marcelo Losada and Lombardi (2018) defend\na “formalism of contextual histories” which is free from\nthe shortcomings of Griffiths’s proposal. \nGiven the need for an observer-independent interpretation of quantum\nmechanics for cosmology, Okon and Sudarsky (2014c) defended an\nobjective collapse theory for the application to cosmology and quantum\ngravity, and on this basis, they proposed an adaptation of objective\ncollapse models to a general relativistic context (2018a). The authors\nalso examined the black hole information loss paradox as a situation\nthat can be accounted for by collapse interpretations (Okon and\nSudarsky 2015b, 2017, 2018b).  Other aspects and interpretations of quantum mechanics have also\nbeen explored. For instance, Sergio Martínez explored the\nphysical content of the Luders Rule (1990, 1991), Pessoa (2005)\nproposed a modal logical treatment of quantum mechanics, and Pablo\nAcuña (2016b) pointed out the difficulties in defining the\nnotion of inertial trajectory in Bohmian mechanics which is considered\na different theory and not a different interpretation of quantum\nmechanics (Acuña forthcoming). In turn, Rodolfo Gambini, Luis\nPedro García-Pintos, and Jorge Pullin (2010, 2011) devised an\ninterpretation that offers a solution to the quantum measurement\nproblem based on the loss of coherence due to the use of realistic\nclocks. \nMatters not directly related to quantum mechanics have also been\nstudied by Latin American philosophers of physics. For instance,\nAcuña (2016a) critically assessed the debate concerning the\ndirection of explanation between Minkowski spacetime and the Lorentz\ninvariance of dynamical laws. Diego Romero-Maltrana (2015) analyzes\nthe relationship between symmetries and conserved quantities supported\nby Noether’s theorems in order to argue for the priority of\nconserved quantities over symmetries.  The problem of time’s arrow was addressed by Castagnino,\nLombardi and collaborators by elaborating on John Earman’s\nheresy (1974) according to which the arrow of time is a geometrical\nproperty of the universe (Castagnino, Lombardi, and Lara 2003). This\nglobal arrow is transferred to the local domain as an energy flow that\npoints to the same time direction on the entire spacetime (Castagnino\nand Lombardi 2009), which in turn supplies the foundations for local\nirreversible theories (Aiello, Castagnino, and Lombardi 2008).\nCastagnino and Lombardi also collaborated with Manuel Gadella, one of\nthe authors of the time-asymmetric quantum mechanics, in order to\nanalyze irreversibility and time’s arrow in the quantum realm\n(Castagnino, Gadella, and Lombardi 2006), a work recently followed by\nCristian López (2019). \nAlthough the philosophy of chemistry is a relatively young\nsubdiscipline in philosophy of science,it has attracted the interest\nof several researchers in Latin America. \nThe group led by Olimpia Lombardi worked on the topic since 2005 when\na paper advocating for the ontological autonomy of chemistry (Lombardi\nand Labarca 2005) was published. The paper sparked a hot debate which\nbegan with a criticism by Paul Needham (2006) that was immediately\nresponded by Lombardi and Labarca (2006), and was followed by many\nother authors. In the meantime, Labarca and Lombardi (2010) also argued for\nthe existence of orbitals in the ontology of chemistry relying on\nontological pluralism. On the basis of the impact of her view,\nLombardi (2014a) reviewed and organized the different criticisms and\noffered a systematic response to them; in turn, with Mariana\nCórdoba, she stressed the Kantian roots of her ontological\npluralism (Córdoba and Lombardi 2013). \nGiven her antireductionist perspective, Lombardi (2013, 2014b) also\ncriticized the book of Hinne Hettema (2012), Reducing Chemistry to\nPhysics, stressing the many difficulties that must be faced by\nthose who insist on the reduction of chemistry to physics; the papers\nreceived immediate replies from Hetterma (2014).  The problems regarding the relations between chemistry and physics\nwere addressed by Lombardi’s group from various perspectives. In\nparticular, they brought to light several interpretive issues of\nquantum mechanics that are not accommodated when the theory is used in\nchemistry (Lombardi and Castagnino 2010; Martínez\nGonzález, Fortin, and Lombardi 2019) and argued that quantum\ndecoherence does not solve the problem of isomerism (Fortin, Lombardi,\nand Martínez González 2016). They also began to examine\nthe issue of the relationship between chemistry and quantum mechanics\nfrom a theoretical perspective, such as the Quantum Theory of Atoms in\nMolecules (Jaimes Arriaga, Fortin, and Lombardi 2019) and Bohmian\nmechanics (Fortin, Lombardi, and Martínez González\n2017); this last paper was critically assessed by Giovanni Villani,\nElena Ghibaudi, and Luigi Cerruti (2018).  As a continuation of her previous work in Spanish, Lombardi (2012)\noffered a critical analysis of Ilya Prigogine’s proposals. In\nturn, with Lucía Lewowicz, she analyzed the ontological\ncategory of stuff as required by macro-chemistry (Lewowicz and\nLombardi 2013). The problem of the categories underlying the chemical\ndiscourse was also addressed in the context of the group by\nCórdoba and Alfio Zambon (2017) for the particular case of\nnano-materials. A particular mention is needed to Zambon’s\n(2018) completely new representation of the periodic system based on\natomic-number triads. \nGuillermo Restrepo focused his interest on how formal tools can be\napplied to chemistry. With José Luis Villaveces, he noted the\nresemblance between Leibniz’s and Lavoisier’s programs\nregarding a lingua philosophica for understanding nature\n(Restrepo and Villaveces 2011) and reviewed the origins of\nmathematical thinking in chemistry (Restrepo and Villaveces 2012).\nRestrepo also analyzed the mathematical aspects of the periodic law\n(Restrepo and Pachón 2007) and considered the different\nfoundational aspects of the field called “mathematical\nchemistry” (2013; Restrepo and Villaveces 2013). Restrepo has\nbeen working in Germany since 2014 where he still produces interesting\ncontributions to the philosophy of chemistry.  The development of the technological aspects of chemistry has been\nthe interest of José Antonio Chamizo (2013, 2017, 2019) with\napplications to chemistry education. \nThe philosophy of biology in the region has been developed in various\ndirections from the most traditional topics in the area to more\ninnovative questions. \nThe traditional topic of natural selection is treated in relation to\nits explanatory power by Pablo Lorenzano in collaboration with the\nSpanish philosopher José Díez (Díez and Lorenzano\n2013, 2015). Santiago Ginnobili (2016) offers a metatheoretical\nstructuralist reconstruction of Darwin’s theory with the purpose\nof elucidating the concept of ecological fitness, and Mario Casanueva\n(2011) proposes a structuralist reconstruction of the mechanism of\nnatural selection by means of graph resources. In turn, Gustavo Caponi\n(2013) studies the concepts of function, fitness, and adaptation in\nnatural selection theory.  Closely related with natural selection, the issue of evolution is\napproached from very different perspectives. For instance, Guillemo\nFolguera stresses the dependence of macroevolution on microevolution\neven in the criticisms of the synthesis since the seventies (Folguera\nand Lombardi 2012), and Maurizio Esposito (2011) supplies examples of\nhow Darwinism was used and adapted in different contexts. But the most\nextensive work on this issue has been developed by Edna\nSuárez-Díaz who focused specifically on molecular\nevolution. In this field, she studied the role played by the concept\nof informational molecule and by the idea of molecular evolution of\ninformational molecules in differentiating molecular from classical\nevolutionists and in the constitution of genomics\n(Suárez-Díaz 2009, 2010). Despite stressing the\nimportance of the molecular experimental approach in evolutionary\nbiology (Suárez-Díaz and Barahona 1996),\nSuárez-Díaz acknowledges the methodological and\nconceptual difficulties embedded in the use of molecular evidence to\nelaborate molecular phylogenies (Suárez-Díaz and\nAnaya-Muñoz 2008; Suárez-Díaz 2014a), and\nemphasizes the generative nature of experimentation\n(Suárez-Díaz 2013).  Heredity, always linked with biological knowledge, has been the\ntopic of interest of Carlos López-Beltrán who shows the\ntransformation of the concept from playing a metaphorical role to\nacquire a narrative role (1994) and subsequently being conceived in\nstatistical terms (2006). By relating heredity with genetics, Esposito\n(2017) emphasizes the longstanding relationships between the\nreductionist view of gene as hereditary unit, the idea of information\nencoded in DNA, and the prophecies about the power of controlling\ngenetic information. From a structuralist perspective, Lorenzano\noffers a metatheoretical reconstruction of classical genetics (Balzer\nand Lorenzano 2000), paying special attention to the Hardy-Weinberg\nlaw within population genetics (2014).  Mario Casanueva (1997)\nexplores the relationship among the sexual theory of reproduction,\nMendelian genetics, and Mendel’s hybridisation theory. In turn,\nJuan Manuel Torres (1997, 2002, 2006) focuses on the use of genetic\ntests in medical practice, and Anna Barahona (2007) considers how\ndifferent inheritance issues can be represented by genetic maps.  Fabrizzio (now Siobhan) Guerrero Mc Manus examines methodological\nproblems: the rational selection of an algorithm for phylogenetic\ninference (2009), and the limitations of mechanistic explanations when\ndealing with developmental mechanisms (2012). In turn, the issue of\ncausation is treated by Maximiliano Martínez in terms of the\nconcept of multi-level causation (Martínez and Moya 2011;\nMartínez and Esposito 2014). The ideas of a multiplicity of\nlevels and of downward causation appears repeatedly in the works of\nCharbel El-Hani (El-Hani and Pereira 1999; El-Hani and Emmeche 2000;\nQueiroz and El-Hani 2006), with the purpose of advocating for property\nand process emergence in biology.  In collaboration with El-Hani, João Queiroz has developed\nextensive work on the biosemiotic approach to biology (El-Hani,\nQueiroz, and Stjernfelt 2010; Queiroz, Emmeche, Kull, and El-Hani\n2011; Queiroz 2012; Queiroz, Stjernfelt, and El-Hani 2014), and its\nrelationship with genetic information (El-Hani, Queiroz, and Emmeche\n2006). From a completely different viewpoint,\nSuárez-Díaz (2007) discusses what she considers the\nmetaphor of information in molecular biology. \nOther non-classical but currently very relevant topics in life\nsciences are also treated in the region, such as environmental matters\n(Klier et al. 2017), ecology (Nunes-Neto, Moreno, and El-Hani 2014),\nand evo-devo (Baedke and Mc Manus 2018).  Finally, it is worth mentioning a recent trend that, in the\nconfluence among philosophy, anthropology, and biology, considers\npolitical issues in biological research (Wade et al. 2015;\nGarcía-Deister and López-Beltrán 2015; Delgado\n2018), studies genomic variations in Latin America\n(Suárez-Díaz 2014b; Anaya-Muñoz,\nGarcía-Deister, and Suárez-Díaz 2017), examines\nthe relationship among genetic research, nationalism, and the\nconstruction of collective social identities (Kent et al. 2015), and\nexplores the relationships among homosexuality, homophobia, and\nbiomedical sciences in the region (Mc Manus 2014). \nSometimes very close to logic itself, the philosophy of logic has an\nimportant presence in Latin American philosophy of science from\nmultiple perspectives. \nThe logical treatment of contradiction attracted great interest,\nmainly in the groups of Campinas and Buenos Aires, although with\ndifferent motivations. In Campinas, where one underlying interest was\nthe possibility of modeling contradictory information in scientific\npractice, Newton da Costa focused on the mathematical concept of\n“pragmatic truth” (Mikenberg, da Costa, and Chuaqui 1986)\nwith the purpose of showing that the logic of pragmatic truth is\nparaconsistent (da Costa, Bueno, and French 1998). In turn, Walter\nCarnielli and Marcelo Coniglio developed an approach in which the\ndistinction between logic and philosophy is not straightforward. On\nthe philosophical side, and following the path opened by da Costa,\nthey focused on the so-called “logics of formal\ninconsistency”, a family of paraconsistent logics that can\nexpress the notion of consistency within the object language\n(Carnielli, Coniglio, and Marcos 2007). Carnielli also developed\ndialogical and epistemic approaches to paraconsistency (Rahman and\nCarnielli 2000; Carnielli and Rodrigues 2019).  In the group led by Eduardo Barrio at Buenos Aires, works on\ninconsistency were motivated by semantic reasons, in particular, the\ntreatment of paradoxes (Barrio 2010; Picollo 2012; Barrio and Picollo\n2013). They studied non-transitivity as a solution of paradoxes\n(Barrio, Rosenblatt, and Tajer 2015; Barrio, Pailos, and Szmuc 2018),\nand considered non-traditional approaches to paradoxes (Da Ré\nand Rosenblatt 2018). Some members of the group were also interested\nin classical recapture in the contexts of paraconsistent logic\n(Teijeiro forthcoming) and of logics of formal inconsistency (Tajer\nforthcoming). Recently, Barrio and collaborators have begun to focus\nspecifically on paraconsistency in its different aspects (Barrio,\nPailos, and Szmuc 2017, forthcoming a; Barrio and Da Ré 2018b;\nBarrio, Clerbout, and Rahman forthcoming). \nThe strong contact between the groups of Campinas and Buenos Aires\nresulted in the publication of two special issues of the Logic\nJournal of the IGPL (Barrio and Carnielli forthcoming a,b)\ndevoted to logics of formal inconsistency. The interest in paradoxes\nand inconsistency also appeared in other authors of the region, such\nas Andrés Bobenrieth (1998).  Topics related to non-extensionality, in particular modal logics\nand Kripkean semantics, were also treated by some philosophers of\nlogic in Latin America (e.g., Mortari 2007; Marcos 2009; Estrada\nGonzález 2012; Rosenblatt and Szmuc 2014). In particular, Max\nFreund (2001, 2004, 2007, 2015) focused on modal logics with sortal\nquantifiers and wrote a collaborative book on modal logic\n(Cocchiarella and Freund 2008).  The question of the coexistence of different logics was\nadditionally addressed by the groups in Buenos Aires and\nCampinas. Whereas Barrio and collaborators discussed logical pluralism\n(Barrio, Pailos, and Szmuc forthcoming b), Carnielli and Coniglio\nfocused on the problems of translations between logics (Carnielli,\nConiglio, and D’Ottaviano 2009) and combinations of logics\n(Carnielli and Coniglio 2007 [2016]).  More traditional problems related with truth have also been\ntreated by the philosophers of logic of the region (e.g., Barrio and\nRodríguez-Pereyra 2015; Barrio and Da Ré 2018a). In\nparticular, Mario Gómez-Torrente (1998, 2000, 2002, 2008, 2006\n[2019]) developed a longstanding work on the notion of logical truth,\ntruth-preservation, and the relationships among logical truth,\nderivability, and model-theoretic validity. \nAlthough in the boundaries between logic and epistemology, the logic\nof belief revision and the works of Carlos Alchourrón\n(Alchourrón and Makinson 1981, 1982; Alchourrón 1996)\ncannot be forgotten: the AGM model (Alchourrón,\nGärdenfors, and Makinson 1985) is still the dominant theory of\nbelief revision (see entry logic\nof belief revision in this Encyclopedia). Andrés\nPáez (2006) uses the theory of belief revision to supply a\nconcept of explanation embodied with pragmatic conditions. Closely\nrelated with this topic, “defeasible reasoning” was\nextensively studied by Gustavo Bodanza and Fernando Tohmé\n(2005, 2009; Bodanza, Tohmé, and Simari 2016; Bodanza,\nTohmé, and Auday 2017; see also Bodanza 2002; Bodanza and\nAlessio 2017). Tohmé also supplied a category-theoretic\nrepresentation of abduction (Tohmé, Caterina, and Gangle 2015),\nand analyzed abduction in its application to economy (Crespo,\nTohmé, and Heymann 2010; Tohmé and Crespo\n2013). Abductive reasoning was also the main interest of Atocha\nAliseda (2003; Soler-Toscano, Nepomuceno-Fernández, and\nAliseda-Llera 2009), who applied abduction to medical diagnosis\n(Aliseda and Leonides 2013) and proposed a conditional logic to\nformalize abduction (Beirlaen and Aliseda 2014). She also published a\nbook completely devoted to abduction (Aliseda 2006), which not only\ndiscusses conceptual and formal matters, but also pays special\nattention to the epistemic applications of abductive reasoning. \nThe philosophy of cognitive sciences is a very complex field, mainly\ndue to the difficulty to distinguish it from other areas such as\nphilosophy of mind, epistemology, linguistics, philosophy of action,\nand logic.  The traditional topic of consciousness has been treated in its\nrelation to brain functions from a naturalized perspective by\nJosé Luis Díaz (1995, 2000) and more recently by Miguel\nAngel Sebastián (2014) on the basis of the neurophysiology of\ndreams; in turn, Beatriz Sorrentino Marques and Osvaldo Pessoa (2017)\nanalyze the role of consciousness in agent causation theories.\nAnother traditional topic, perception, is addressed by Juan Carlos\nGonzález who analyzes the process of perceptual recalibration\n(González, Bach-y-Rita, and Haase 2005) and the case of\nhallucinations (González 2010, 2016), and by Laura Danón\nand Daniel Kalpokas (2017) who offer an explanation of the direct\nperception of mental states of others. Juan Pablo Bermúdez, in\nturn, focuses on mental actions, supplying an account of skillful\naction that rejects both intellectualism and anti-intellectualism\n(2017) and claiming that remembering is not merely passive but must be\nviewed as a mental action (Arango-Muñoz and Bermúdez\n2018). In collaboration with Bermúdez, Alejandro Rosas stresses\nthe cognitive and non-cognitive roots of shared intentionality (Rosas\nand Bermúdez 2018) and the influence of cognitive dispositions\non weakness of will attribution (Rosas, Bermúdez, and\nGutiérrez 2018). \nIn addition to his collaborative work with Bermúdez, Rosas\ndeveloped an extensive work on the evolution of moral cognition and\nthe cognitive roots of cooperation (2002, 2008a). In particular, he\nclaims that altruism is selected both at the individual and at the\ngroup levels (2008b) and proposes a unified theory of human\ncooperation based on reciprocity (2010, 2012). Recently, with\ncolleagues coming from philosophy and from science, he has contributed\nto the research on moral judgment with moral dilemmas (Rosas and\nKoenigs 2014; Rosas, Viciana, Caviedes, and Arciniegas 2019).  An approach that received much attention in the region is that of\nembodied cognition and, in particular, enactivism (see González\n2013; Hutto and Satne 2017; Martínez, Español, and\nPérez 2018).  For instance, Ignacio Avila analyzes bodily\nawareness and its role in perceptual self-location (2014, 2017) and\nconsiders certain enactive accounts of perception (2015). Adrian\nCussins (2012) discusses the role that representation of the body\nplays in cognition. In turn, Maria Eunice Quilici González asks\nwhether embodied cognition can be applied to artificial systems as\nrobots (Haselager and González 2007a). \nAxel Barceló Aspeitia and Angeles Eraña focused their\nwork mainly on the modularity of mind in order to adapt the idea of\ndomain specificity (Barceló, Eraña, and Stainton 2010)\nand to compare the hypothesis of massive modularity to other views\nabout the structure of mind (Eraña 2012). In this context,\nClaudia Lorena García (2007) argues that the hypothesis of the\nmodularity of mind needs to be understood in terms of the evolutionary\nbiological concepts of variational independence (2007) and of\nfunctional homology and functional variation (2010).  Metacognition is the topic that attracted the interest of Santiago\nArango-Muñoz who distinguishes between the rationalizing level\nand the controlling level in metacognition (2011) and appeals to the\nconcepts of metamemory and metacognitive feelings to address the\ninteractions between the mind and the world (2013). Furthermore, he\nexplores the nature of the so-called “epistemic feelings”\nfrom a metacognitive perspective (2014, 2019).  Cognitive functions are approached from an informational\nperspective by M.E.Q. González, who analyzes mechanical models\nof intelligence (2005) and of reasoning (González, Broens, and\nD’Ottaviano 2007; Haselager and González 2007b). From the\nsame informational approach, Sebastián and Artiga (forthcoming)\nexplore metarepresentation. Other formal perspectives are adopted to\nverify the so-called cognitive task analysis (Laureano-Cruces and\nBarceló-Aspeitia 2002) and to analyze the agent’s\nresolution of conditional probability problems (Moro, Bodanza, and\nFreidin 2011). \nFrom a completely different viewpoint, several authors in the region\nprefer to understand cognitive phenomena in an analytical framework,\nspecifically in relation to language (e.g., Skidelsky 2013;\nGarcía-Ramírez 2011; García-Ramírez and\nShatz 2011) with affinity with research in philosophy of mind.  Certain methodological problems of social sciences have been\naddressed by Diego Ríos, who analyzed explanation with\nmechanistic and evolutionary models (2004; Kuchle and Ríos\n2015), and studied the relationship between methodological\nindividualism and methodological holism (Ríos 2005, 2009;\nRíos Pozzi 2007). In particular, the autonomy and\nirreducibility of economics has been discussed (Scarano 2012;\nGómez 2012). Nevertheless, almost all of the philosophy of\nsocial sciences in Latin America has been directed to theoretical\nissues in specific sciences or particular problems of the region.  A field that attracts great interest is the philosophy of history.\nElías Palti recalls the evolution and crisis of the area\n(2018), and distinguishes the so-called “politico-intellectual\nhistory” from the old “history of political ideas”\n(2010, 2014). Veronica Tozzi (2012a, 2016, 2018), in turn, proposes an\noriginal pragmatist approach to the philosophy of history, which\nappeals to Dewey’s notion of “practical meaning” in\nrelation to the knowledge of the past. Tozzi also focuses on the\nproblem of the roles memory and testimony play in representing the\nrecent past (2009, 2012b). In connection to these concepts, Esteban\nLythgoe (2011, 2014) analyzes how Paul Ricoeur articulates history,\nmemory, and testimony.  Other topics involved in the philosophy of history have also been\nconsidered: the historicity of the concept of subject (Palti 2004),\nthe ideas of progress (Ratto 2018), and of future (Belvedresi\n2018). In particular, María Inés Mudrovcic highlights\nthe different types of consciousness of temporality (2014) and\nanalyzes the political self-understanding of the present in terms of\nthe past in contemporary Western societies (2013). The impact of the\nphenomenon of globalization on historiographical paradigms (Brauer\n2018) and on the deformation of ethical and political concepts\n(Roldán 2018) are also examined. In turn, the idea of Global\nHistory is considered by Rosa Belvedresi (2012) who compares it with\nthe concept of universal history, and by Francisco Naishtat (2012) as\na framework for the Marxist debate on colonialism and\nmodernization. \nAt the crossroads between philosophy of politics and political\nphilosophy—if there is any difference between them—the\ncategories of equality and liberty (Hilb 1994), authority\n(Oyarzún 2012), and power (Oyarzún 2017) have been\nanalyzed. In this field, Naishtat has developed extensive research\nmainly directed to the critical evaluation of phenomena at the global\nscale. For instance, he analyzes the relationship between fragile\nsovereignties, global-intensive governance apparatuses, and a\nhorizon-less catastrophe-world (2010a), and argues that the political\ndimension of the global is global justice (2011). In turn, Naishtat\nstands in the context of recent political events, when he considers\nthe possibility of peace and rights transcending state frontiers in\nthe light of the 1990s Balkan wars (2000) and the\ndisplacement of the content of the terms “terror” and\n“terrorism” after 9/11 towards a meaning functional to\nglobalization (2010b).  Latin American themes are recurrent in the philosophy of social\nsciences of the region. Palti has been very active in this field: he\nstudied the nineteenth century Latin American intellectual history in\nthe context of the thesis of the essential contestability of concepts\n(2005), considered the limitations of the notion of “misplaced\nideas” by means of which Roberto Schwarz analyzed the dynamics\nof ideas in Latin America (2006), and critically examined the radical\ntransformation in the ways of conceiving the process leading to the\nbreak of colonial ties that linked Latin America with Spain\n(2009). Other authors share this interest in regional problems, such\nas Pablo Oyarzún (2007) who focused on Latin American\nsingularities, Gustavo Leyva (2014) who considered how the democratic\nproject was reformulated and radicalized in Latin America over the\nlast decades, and Ambrosio Velasco Gómez (2015) who proposes an\noriginal thesis about the intellectual roots of Mexican\nindependence. \nWhen Latin American themes are considered, the so-called Philosophy of\nLiberation cannot be forgotten: a philosophical movement that emerged\nin the late sixties in Argentina and spread through Latin America in\nthe following decades with authors such as Enrique Dussel, Leopoldo\nZea, Arturo Roig, Francisco Miró Quesada, Arturo Roig, and\nCarlos Cullen among many others. Nevertheless, here the topic will not\nbe treated because a complete entry of the Encyclopedia is devoted to\nit (Eduardo Mendieta,\n philosophy of liberation). \nThe philosophy of technology has attracted significant interest from\nLatin American researchers working from very different perspectives\nwhether ontological-epistemological or ethical-political. From a\ngeneral viewpoint, Ricardo Gómez (2010) offers a detailed\noverview of the philosophical ideas about technology.  Regarding the ontological status of technical artifacts and\nactions, Diego Lawler critically analyzes the functional and\nintentional theories about the nature of artifact kinks (Vega and\nLawler 2014) and proposes a praxeological approach to technological\npractices (Lawler 2018). In turn, Andrés Vaccari directs\ncriticisms to the functionalist assumptions underlying the dual nature\nof technical artifacts program (2013) and the extended cognition\ntheory applied to artifacts (2017), claiming that transhumanism has\nfailed in its aim to ground the transformation of the human condition\non technology (2015). The ontological status of artificial agents and\nartificial life was addressed by Mari González and Osvaldo\nPessoa (2008), who face the problem of whether life and autonomy could\nin principle be sustained with components other than carbon, and by\nDiego Parente (2018) who considers the challenges that these cases\npose to the traditional dichotomy between natural/artificial. Pablo\nRodríguez and Javier Blanco (2017), in turn, confront Gilbert\nSimondon’s theory of individuation with ideas coming from\ncybernetics. From an epistemological perspective Myriam Altamirano\nBustamante, Adalberto de Hoyos, and León Olivé (2011)\nargue that much of the tacit knowledge involved in technology can be\ntransmitted as explicit knowledge through patents. \nThe ethical and socio-political dimensions of technology are topics\nthat have received great attention in the region. For instance, Jorge\nLinares Salgado (2018) analyzes the ethical and societal consequences\nof the production of bio-artifacts derived from synthetic biology. A\nmore specific study is offered by Carlos Osorio Marulanda (2018), who\naddresses the problems related with drinking water production,\nespecially in rural areas of Latin America, from the perspective of\nscience, technology, and society (STS) studies. \nIn the area of STS studies, the extensive work of Hebe Vessuri\noccupies a relevant place. In the boundaries between sociology and\nphilosophy, Vessuri has addressed general problems from a regional\npoint of view. For example, she considers how the current admission of\nthe underlying ontological complexity of the world influences both the\nsocio-cognitive and the institutional organization of disciplinary\nknowledge, particularly in developing countries (2000) and how\nscience and technology can respond to the particular needs of Latin\nAmerican societies (2003). Vessuri also discusses the world\ndistribution of scientists, engineers, and technologists and the\nmovement of these personnel from peripheral countries to central\ncountries (de la Vega and Vessuri 2008). The readers interested in STS\nstudies in Latin America can turn to the article “Latin American\nscience, technology, and society. A historical and reflexive\napproach” (Kreimer and Vessuri 2018), which describes the\ndevelopment of STS in the region, its institutionalization and its\nspaces of interaction. \nFinally, two books in Spanish by León Olivé must be\nrecalled due to their impact in the Latin American community of\nphilosophers of science: whereas in the first (Olivé 2000)\nscience and technology are considered on a par, the second book\n(Olivé 2007) deals specifically with the different facets of\ntechnology. \nOther topics, not easily included in the traditional philosophies of\nparticular sciences, have also been addressed in Latin America.  What is now known as philosophy of information has been an\ninterest of Olimpia Lombardi and her research group from different\nperspectives. The meaning of the term “information” is\nelucidated from a general viewpoint (Lombardi 2004), paying particular\nattention to Shannon information (Lombardi 2005; Lombardi, Holik, and\nVanni 2016a), and arguing for a pluralistic interpretation of the\nconcept (Lombardi, Fortin, and Vanni 2015). By adopting a critical\nperspective regarding Christopher Timpson’s deflationary view of\ninformation (Lombardi, Fortin, and López 2016), it is argued\nthat there is no qualitative difference between Shannon and quantum\ninformation besides the difference in the way in which they are\nencoded (Lombardi, Holik, and Vanni 2016b). In turn, an\ninterpretational account of quantum measurement is offered (Lombardi,\nFortin, and López 2015). On the basis of this critical work,\nLombardi and Cristian López (2018) have elucidated the concept\nof information as used in Giulio Tononi’s Integrated Information\nTheory of consciousness, and have proposed a manipulation-based\ninterpretation of communicational information (López and\nLombardi 2019).  The philosophy of science as a resource for science education is a\ntopic that has acquired an increasing interest in Latin America during\nthe last decades. In this field, two authors have developed intensive\nwork. Agustín Adúriz-Bravo addressed the use of\nwell-known episodes from the history of science, such as the\nformulation of the pendulum law by Galileo (2004) and the discovery of\nradium by the Curies (Adúriz-Bravo and Izquierdo-Aymerich 2009)\nfor science education. Moreover, he applied the cognitive model of\nscience (Izquierdo-Aymerich and Adúriz-Bravo 2003;\nAdúriz-Bravo and Izquierdo-Aymerich 2005) and the semantic view\nof scientific theories (Adúriz-Bravo 2011, 2013) both to the\npractice of science teaching and to research on science education. He\nalso appealed to the so called “Nature of Science” view of\nscience for the education of science teachers (Adúriz-Bravo\n2007, 2014). On the basis of those theoretical bases,\nAdúriz-Bravo focuses on the philosophy of chemistry as a\nresource for the didactics of chemistry (Erduran, Adúriz-Bravo,\nand Mamlok Naaman 2007; Izquierdo-Aymerich and Adúriz-Bravo\n2009; Adúriz-Bravo, Merino, and Izquierdo-Aymerich 2012).  The interest of Charbel El-Hani is mainly centered on the\nphilosophy of biology for didactics of biology. He advocates for a\ntheory-centered approach to the concept of life (2008) and considers\nthe advantages of the dialogue between the students’\nethnobiological knowledge and biology school knowledge (Baptista and\nEl-Hani 2009). He also appeals to the works of Mendel and Darwin for\nteaching genetics and evolution (Bizzo and El-Hani 2009; El-Hani\n2015) and analyzes the different concepts of gene that often overlap\nin biology education (Dos Santos, Joaquim, and El-Hani 2012; Meyer,\nBomfim, and El-Hani 2013, Gericke, Hagberg, dos Santos, Joaquim, and\nEl-Hani 2014). Beyond the specific field of biology, El-Hani accounts\nfor the different ways in which individuals and societies represent\nconcepts (Aguiar Jr, Sevian, and El-Hani 2018), discusses how to deal\nwith the relations between different cultural perspectives in\nclassrooms (Moreira-dos-Santos and El-Hani 2017), and advocates for\nunderstanding as one of the major goals of science education\n(Ferreira, El-Hani, and da Silva Filho 2016). \nAfter reviewing the development of philosophy of science in Latin\nAmerica since its emergence in the mid-twentieth century, it can be\nsaid that there are some distinctive features in different countries.\nBut in the last decades, especially given the widespread use of the\nInternet and digital libraries by the mid-1990s, a growing\nintercommunication and collaboration can be verified as well as the\ntendency to form an academic community with an important international\npresence, which, at the same time, has certain characteristics of its\nown. Among the common features, the following deserve to be\nmentioned. \nFinally, it is worth stressing that the area strongly progressed in\nspite of the many obstacles that philosophical research faces in the\nregion; the erratic political situation and the cyclic economic crisis\nin Latin American countries influence research policies, and this\nplaces scholars in unstable and uncertain positions.  Nevertheless,\nregardless of the difficulties, at present a new generation of young\nphilosophers of science allows us to foresee that the philosophy of\nscience produced in Latin America will continue to grow in quantity\nand quality, increasing its already considerable international\npresence.","contact.mail":"olimpiafilo@arnet.com.ar","contact.domain":"arnet.com.ar"},{"date.published":"2015-12-02","date.changed":"2020-02-07","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phil-science-latin-america/","author1":"Olimpia Lombardi","author2":"Ana Rosa Pérez Ransanz","author1.info":"http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Philosophy/Faculty-Bios/Alberto-Cordero","entry":"phil-science-latin-america","body.text":"\n\n\nWhen philosophy of science began as a professional field in the late\n1940s, contributions from Latin America joined the forefront of the\ninternational debate right away. Philosophers of science from the\nsubcontinent have expanded their presence ever since. This article\naims to provide an overview of philosophy of science in the\nsubcontinent. The primary focus is on contributions produced in Latin\nAmerica by thinkers living in the region, with an emphasis on\n“mainstream philosophy of science”—a discipline\ncentered on the study of scientific knowledge, metaphysics,\nmethodology, and values, broadly analytic in style, as exemplified by\nworks published in high-quality journals such as Philosophy of\nScience, Erkenntnis, The British Journal for the\nPhilosophy of Science, and Studies in the History and\nPhilosophy of Science.\n\n This entry has four parts. Section 1 provides historical\nbackground.  Section 2 is devoted to philosophy of science activity in\nvarious regional centers through the early 1990s when the Internet and\nimproved institutional resources “globalized” the practice\nof philosophy of science, greatly blurring earlier geographical\nseparations. The two following sections focus on the last decades:\nSection 3 presents contributions to the general philosophy of science,\nand Section 4 reviews advances in the philosophy of special\nsciences. The final Section 5 briefly considers some of the\ndifficulties and prospects for philosophy of science in Latin\nAmerica.\n\n\nIn this article effort is made to provide an even-handed and objective\npicture, but of course only a selective sketch is possible, made of\nchoices influenced by the authors’ interpretation of the\nfield.\n\nIt is useful to begin with a brief historical background. Science and\nscientific thought have long functioned in Latin America as beacons of\ncivic hope and progress amidst multiple recurrent frustrations that\nvary in kind and texture from place to place. In most of the region,\nthe Enlightenment ideals that fueled independence movements of the\nearly nineteenth century were quickly disappointed by the chaos and\ngeneral barbarism that followed in much of the region until the 1860s.\nIt was different in Brazil, where emancipation from Europe occurred\ngradually and orderly during the century, but there too problems\ngrew as did also tensions between the economic elite and the\ncountry’s leading liberal thinkers. \nReacting against expanding frustration, many Latin Americans saw a\nsolution in the “scientific” ways of thinking dominant in\nthe industrialized countries. In the 1850s a progressive philosophy\nwas in full flight in the larger world, ready-made for Latin American\nvisionaries: French Positivism, a doctrine of progress and secular\nreligion, centered on hope in modern science, led by Auguste Comte.\nCommitted to fighting the temptations of barbarism, the positivists\nsought to continue the project of the Enlightenment. Against the\nimpulsive approach to decision-making then prevailing in most of Latin\nAmerica, local positivists sought to extend scientific thought to\nphilosophy and political action, convinced it would promote\nobjectivity, rational consensus, publicly accessible cumulative truth\nin all spheres, along the material success characteristic of modern\nscience. Between about 1870 and 1910 positivism took strong hold in\nmuch of Latin America, with an agenda that called for methodological\nimprovement in the local practice of the natural sciences, medicine,\nand education, also greatly influencing activity in philosophy,\nhistory, art, and law (see, e.g., Frondizi 1943, Zea 1943–44,\nNachman 1977, Quintanilla 2006). In Argentina, scientism and\nComte’s philosophy had influential defenders, notably Domingo\nFaustino Sarmiento, many scientists (e.g., paleontologist Florentino\nAmeghino), physician-philosophers (e.g., José Ingenieros and\nAlejandro Korn), educators (e.g., Pedro Scalabrini), and lawyers\n(e.g., Carlos Octavio Bunge, whose nephew Mario A. Bunge would become\nan international figure in philosophy of science in the following\ncentury). A conviction these thinkers shared stated that a modern and\nefficient system of public education was indispensable for achieving\nthe desired transformations. Interest in advancing the positivist approach\ngrew to religious heights especially in Brazil, where it was\nchampioned by distinguished political figures, notably Miguel de\nLemos, a reorganizer of the country’s curriculum and a decisive\nforce in the construction of the first Humanity Temple for the\npropagation of Comte’s ideas in the world. When Brazil became a\nrepublic in 1889, positivist doctrine made its way to the new flag,\nthe motto “Order and Progress” lifted from Comte’s\nwritings—in Système de Politique Positive\n(1851), the preliminary discourse’s conclusion begins with the\nwords “Love for principle, order for base, and progress for\naim” (L’amour pour principe, l’ordre pour base, et le\nprogrès pour but; p. 321). \nThe influence of positivism in Mexico was nearly as strong,\nparticularly in education, as exemplified by the labors of the\nrespected chemist and medical doctor Gabino Barreda, who banned\nreligion and traditional philosophy from the school curriculum and\ncentralized access to higher education and culture. In Chile, the\nbrothers Jorge and Enrique Lagarrigue were two leading advocates of\nComte’s philosophy and his Humanity Religion. In Colombia, Rafael\nNuñez, an educational reformer and three times president of\nColombia, actively promoted positivism, as did in Peru (with touches\nof Herbert Spencer’s evolutionism) such figures as Javier Prado,\nManuel González Prada, Celso Bambarén, and Manuel\nVicente Villarán. In Bolivia, positivism also had influential\ndefenders from the 1870s through the 1890s, notably a circle of\nwriters, “Círculo Literario”, in whose\njournal works by Charles Darwin, Luis Dumont, Ernst H. P. A.  Haeckel\nand other naturalists appeared in translation. \nWith all this intellectual and progressive enthusiasm in the air,\nhopes of imminent general improvement ran high, but\n“positive” results were slow in coming. The expectations\nof economic advancement and civic improvement did not materialize as\nadvertised. To compound matters, the devastation caused by the Great\nWar in Europe badly compromised social faith in the products of\nscience. Positivism waned accordingly in Latin America, replaced in\nthe 1920s by a more radical social thought, especially Marxism, as well\nas approaches distrustful of naturalist reasoning (Bergsonian\nspiritualism, phenomenology, and later existentialism). Metaphysics\nunbridled by standard logic became dominant in many university\ncircles.  Reactions to excessively “high philosophy” began to\narise in the 1940s, helped by the arrival of thinkers from Europe, for\nexample Juan David García Bacca in the cases of Ecuador,\nMexico, and Venezuela, Hans Lindemann in Argentina, and Gilles-Gaston\nGranger in Brazil. Along the way came a revival of interest in logic,\nscience-friendly epistemology, and the study of conceptual structures.\nThanks to these developments, when philosophy of science became a\nprofessional field in the late 1940s, Latin America had some\nscientists and philosophers ready and willing to fully join their\ncounterparts in Europe and North America. Since then, for the past\nseventy years, a number of philosophers of science based in Latin\nAmerica, often in uncooperative environments, have managed to produce\nwork of the highest international standards (something not so clearly\napparent in the developing world in other branches of international\nphilosophy). \nBy the mid 1990s, academic centers in Latin America began to benefit\nfrom the kind of world-wide interaction made possible by the Internet,\nelectronic libraries, and improved forms of institutional support for\nintegration and travel. With geographical and institutional barriers\ngreatly reduced, the field expanded considerably. Over the last\nthree decades virtually every theme in philosophy of science would\ndevelop a presence in works produced in Latin America. Dialogue and\ncollaboration between researchers now transcend the traditional local\nboundaries. This new global environment makes less relevant the\ntraditional geographical approach to philosophical production in the\nregion. Accordingly, Sections 3 and 4, devoted to activity from the\nmid 1990s on, structure the subject around themes, concepts, and\nprinciples (rather than around geography and individuals). \nPhilosophy of science developed a robust presence at Universidad\nNacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), a major institution\nat the forefront of intellectual life in the country and the\nSpanish-speaking world. The discipline gained strength in the 1960s\nand early 1970s through the efforts of prominent faculty members,\nespecially Fernando Salmerón, Luis Villoro, and Alejandro Rossi\nwho encouraged rigor and clarity in philosophy and provided\nscholarship support to enable students to do post-graduate work in\nEurope, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Together they\nfounded the journal Crítica in 1967, a choice venue\nfor philosophy in Latin America and Spain. An influential work by\nSalmerón, La Filosofía y las\nMatemáticas, came out the following year. Major\ninternational seminars and meetings became a regular feature at\nUNAM’s Institute for Philosophical Investigations (Instituto\nde Investigaciones Filosóficas—IIF), which in the\n1970s and 1980s hosted some now legendary seminars and short courses\nled by world-class figures. One of these international seminars\nfocused on the history and philosophy of science, started by Mario\nBunge (Argentina and Canada). IIF became the host of many spirited\nphilosophical debates, those between Bunge and Héctor-Neri\nCastañeda (Guatemala and the United States) being among the\nmost prominentely remembered. With Bunge’s help, in 1976 an\nepistemology forum was established—Asociación\nMexicana de Epistemología. At the beginning of the 1970s,\nMario Otero (Uruguay) formally joined IIF with a considerable effect\non the studies of the philosophical history of science. \nThe structuralist approach came to Mexico in a big way with Carlos\nUlises Moulines who moved to IIF from Munich in the mid-1970s. Born in\nVenezuela, he studied in Europe, first under the supervision of\nJesús Mosterín in Barcelona and then of Wolfgang\nStegmüller in Munich. His early focus was on the rise of the\nlogical empiricist approach, particularly the projects of logical\nreconstruction of the empirical world variously advocated by Bertrand\nRussell, Rudolf Carnap, and Nelson Goodman; Moulines developed these\ninvestigations in his first monograph, La Estructura del Mundo\nSensible (1973). He took an interest in integrating some of\nStegmüller’s original contributions into earlier\nstructuralist work by Patrick Suppes in the United States and Gunther\nLudwig in Germany, an effort displayed by some of his articles from\nthis period (notably Moulines 1975, 1976). Responding to the\nhistorical turn in philosophy of science, Moulines, like Joseph Sneed\nin the United States and Stegmüller in Germany, focused on the\nissue of theory change. He devoted much of his research during the\n1970s and 1980s to the dynamics of theories, applying the resources of\ndiachronic structuralist reconstruction and Kuhnian analysis (in terms\nof disciplinary matrices) to the development of Newtonian mechanics\nand equilibrium thermodynamics. The resulting investigations were\npresented in the book Exploraciones Metacientíficas\n(1982). Moulines became an important intellectual force at IIF where\nhe stayed for over a decade, engaged in cutting-edge research that\nmade him a leading figure in the international structuralist\nmovement. In Moulines’ view, scientific theories are cultural\nconstructs of philosophical interest. He regards philosophy of science\nas a discipline whose epistemology is primarily interpretive rather\nthan prescriptive or descriptive—a theorization about\ntheorizations. A good proportion of the philosophy of science\nconducted at IIF during his tenure was directly influenced by him. A\nrelevant point for present purposes is that his work in Mexico during\nthese years reached the highest levels within the worldwide\nstructuralist movement. In 1984 Moulines left the country, first to\nBielefeld University, then to Berlin, and finally to the Center for\nMathematical Philosophy at Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich,\nwhere he became Stegmüller’s successor and is now a\nProfessor Emeritus. Many of his subsequent publications had a lasting\nimpact in Latin America, notably An Architectonic for Science: The\nStructuralist Program (Balzer, Moulines, and Sneed 1987), along\nmany papers.  Research seminars at IIF continued to develop and strengthen in\nthe 1980s with a series of international symposia of philosophy\nstarted by Enrique Villanueva and continued by León\nOlivé, a venture of impressive scale that brought together\nworld-class figures from many parts of Latin America, the United\nStates, Britain, and Europe. The high-quality interactions these\nvenues generated proved remarkably fruitful as starting points of much\nsubsequent research activity in Mexico and elsewhere in the\nsubcontinent. This period was also marked by institutional investment\nin specialized research libraries and the reinforcement of publishing\nprograms at UNAM and other institutions in Mexico. Scholarship\nprograms helped researchers and students spend periods at major\ninternational centers. At IIF philosophical research reached a level\nof support never seen before in Latin America. Significant papers and\nmonographs began to flow regularly from seminars on general philosophy\nof science, the philosophy of physics, and the philosophy of\nbiology. \nActivity in the field also became more diverse at IIF in the 1980s.\nOne major area focused on the limits of scientific knowledge,\nrepresented by Luis Villoro’s 1982 critique of scientism in\nCreer, Saber, Conocer, where he advocates a revaluation of\n“wisdom” (characterized as knowledge drawn from lived\nexperiences), which in Villoro’s view is richly found in the\n“wise men” of traditional cultures; in this book he\nexplores how human reason has operated throughout history and the\nextent to which it has led to situations of domination and/or\nemancipation from subjection. \nIt is important to emphasize that the professionalization of the\nphilosophy of science in Mexico was achieved mainly through the\ncreation of specialized degree programs. Nowadays, the Posgrado en\nFilosofía de la Ciencia, founded at UNAM in 1993, is the\nprogram where most of the new generations now working in the\ndiscipline in Mexico have been trained. \nAn influential textbook by Gilles-Gaston Granger, Lógica e\nFilosofia das Ciências —first published in\n1955—is acknowledged as the first introduction to the field in\nPortuguese. A disciple of Gaston Bachelard, Granger taught at the\nUniversity of São Paulo (USP) from 1947 to 1953 and was a major\nforce in the development of philosophy of science in Brazil. His work\nfavored a historically-oriented approach hospitable to the Anglo-Saxon\nanalytic style. Back in Europe he associated himself with various\nphilosophical and social projects; in 1986 he was elected to the Chair\nof Comparative Epistemology at the Collège de France.\nThe research projects Granger started in Brazil continued after his\ntenure, especially thanks to the efforts of Oswaldo Porchat. \nIn 1964 a military coup led to government action eradicating academics\nsuspected of leftist sympathies, seriously disrupting many fields,\nincluding philosophy of science. Nevertheless, faculty groups were\nsoon able to restore activity. In 1970, at USP João Paulo\nMonteiro managed to start Ciência e Filosofia, a\njournal dedicated to logic and philosophy of science from a plurality\nof perspectives. Revitalization of the discipline continued throughout\nthe decade with timely research projects, often carried out in\nconjunction with international visits and courses, notably ones\norganized by Porchat, first at USP and after 1975 at State University\nof Campinas (UNICAMP), where he headed a new unit, Centro de\nLógica, Epistemologia e História da Ciência\n(CLE), whose members included Zeljko Loparic and other distinguished\nscholars. In 1977 CLE launched the prestigious journal\nManuscrito, supplemented in 1980 by Cadernos de Filosofia\ne História da Ciência, and in 1987 by a book series\n(Coleção CLE). CLE quickly became a symbol of\nhope for philosophers and historians of science as well as logicians.\nIn particular, CLE is involved in the articulation of\n“Paraconsistent Logic”, a field Newton C. da Costa began\nto develop in the late 1950s and early 1960s when he was working at\nFederal University of Paraná. Da Costa is one of the most\ncharismatic and energetic thinkers in Latin America, a world-class\nfigure in mathematics, logic, and philosophy of science, with a widely\nrecognized reputation for original works on non-classical logics, the\naxiomatization of scientific theories, and structuralist philosophy of\nscience, orientations that continue to be active in Brazil with such\nfigures as Itala D’Ottaviano and Walter Carnielli. \nIn philosophy of science CLE supports significant research on the\ncharacter and structure of modern science as well as its concepts and\ntheories—conducted from a variety of perspectives, including\ninvestigations in science teaching and the uses of philosophy of\nscience in education. Critical dialogue has been fostered through\nseminars, distinguished international visits, research funding,\nfaculty and student exchanges, interdisciplinary studies, and the\npublication of monographs and papers by Brazilian authors as well as\ntranslations of major works into Portuguese. Post-graduate studies and\npostdoctoral fellowships in logic and philosophy of science are\nthriving accordingly at UNICAMP. One scheme developed by CLE to\nattract promising faculty recently graduated from institutions\nworldwide produced excellent results. In the 1980s Michel Ghins and\nHarvey Brown energized analytic activity on space-time physics. Steven\nFrench did likewise in advancing the model-theoretic approach and the\nmetaphysics of quantum mechanics at Campinas. With the help of these\nand other recruits, philosophy of physics, mathematics, and formal\napproaches to the philosophy of science thrived. At Campinas, French\nand da Costa started a long-lasting collaboration that proved\nremarkably fertile, resulting in influential contributions to current\ndebates on the metaphysics of quantum mechanics, structuralism, and\nthe semantic approach to theories, as well as a fresher way of looking\nat the concept of truth (“pragmatic truth” and\n“partial truth”). These collaborations led to many papers\n(Da Costa and French 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993) as well as a book in\n2003, Science and Partial Truth: A Unitary Approach to Models and\nScientific Reasoning, which received international acclaim for\nthe light it casts on philosophical logic, structuralism, and\nrealism. Brown and French made Brazil their country, and it is easy to\nimagine how different the geography of philosophy of physics and\nmathematics might have turned out had circumstances in Brazil been a\nlittle kinder to academic life in the 1980s. Together with da Costa,\nthe international recruits and the local talents they began to nurture\nwould have probably turned CLE and USP (where Otávio Bueno had\nworked with da Costa) into top centers for philosophy of science in\nthe world. Destiny dictated otherwise, however; Ghins left to a\nprofessorship at Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium; Brown moved to a\ndistinguished career at Oxford, where he is now professor of the\nphilosophy of physics; and French went to the United States and then\nback to England where he is now professor of philosophy of science at\nthe University of Leeds and Editor-in-Chief of The British Journal\nfor the Philosophy of Science. Brown and French have each served\nterms as presidents of the prestigious British Society for the\nPhilosophy of Science. Happily, all these international old members\nmaintain productive ties with Brazilian groups. CLE has continued to\nprosper over the last two decades. \nPhilosophical activity has expanded in Brazil at many other\ninstitutions since the 1990s, as described in the following\nsections. \nAs with the previous countries, the field developed a presence in the\nAndean countries in the early days of professional philosophy of\nscience. \nIn Venezuela, Juan David García Bacca, a critic of Francisco\nFranco, was forced to leave Spain and arrived in Caracas in 1946 after\nperiods in Ecuador and Mexico. He led a productive career at the\nFaculty of Letters and Philosophy, Central University (Universidad\nCentral de Venezuela, UCV). In the mid-1930s, after completing a\ndoctoral dissertation on the logico-genetic structure of the physical\nsciences, García Bacca joined the Vienna Circle. In Latin\nAmerica he became a prolific writer, his works including\nTeoría de la relatividad (1941), La\nfísica (1962), Historia filosófica de la\nciencia (1963), Teoría y metateoría de la\nciencia, Vol. I (1977) and Vol II (1984). He remained a major\nforce in Caracas until 1971. In the 1970s and 1980s, Andrés\nKalnay led a small group interested in the foundations of quantum\nmechanics, first at UCV’s School of Physics and then at\nVenezuela’s leading center for scientific research,\nInstituto Venezolano de Investigaciones\nCientíficas. Presently UCV runs a master’s program\nin logic and philosophy of science coordinated by Franklin\nGalindo. \nPhilosophy of science in Colombia has long-enduring ties with\nContinental European schools, but analytic philosophy of science has\nnot been absent. Already in the 1950s Mario Laserna at Universidad\nde los Andes (Uniandes), Bogotá, promoted the study of\nlogic and the scientific philosophy of Hans Reichenbach. Subsequently,\nlocal groups, helped by international visitors, have played a\nconsistent role in the country, notably Gonzalo Munévar, a\nColombian philosopher of science now based in the United States, who\nvisits regularly his country. \nActivity in Peru started early in the 1950s, as attested by gatherings\norganized at Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (UNMSM,\nPeru’s oldest university) and Sociedad Peruana de\nFilosofía, both in Lima. Broad interest is also reflected\nin articles published in the 1950s and 1960s in the weekly literary\nsupplement of “El Comercio” by Oscar\nMiró-Quesada, Francisco Miró-Quesada, and other\nintellectuals interested in logic, science, and mathematics. Francisco\nMiró-Quesada, the country’s leading philosopher, was one\nof the pioneers in the development of modern philosophical logic and\nscience studies in Latin America, where he has indefatigably\nencouraged hope in the power of human reason. Miró-Quesada\ntaught at UNMSM for more than two decades, and then at Universidad\nCayetano Heredia (UPCH) and other centers in the country. He also\nheaded institutes for philosophical research, first at Universidad\nde Lima and subsequently at Universidad Ricardo Palma.\nMiró-Quesada was the author of numerous works in the area of\nphilosophy of science, including a book in the philosophy of\nmathematics, Filosofía de las Matemáticas\n(1954). He has also been a champion of research in logic in the region\n(it was Miró-Quesada who suggested to name Newton da\nCosta’s approach “paraconsistent logic”, which he\nhelped to promote). Miró-Quesada’s most heartfelt project\nfocused on the study of human reason, regarded as the capacity to\nreach truth, broadly understood, as outlined in his preliminary book\nApuntes para una Teoría de la Razón (1962),\nfollowed in 2013 by Esquema de una Teoría de la\nRazón, in which Miró-Quesada discusses the pursuit\nof rational validity in logic, science, metaphysics, and ethical\ntheory. In the early 1970s, young faculty trained in Europe and the\nUnited States expanded and updated the philosophical study of science\nin the country, particularly at UNMSM. Timely contributions were made,\nespecially by Luis Piscoya (philosophy of psychology and general\nphilosophy of science), Juan Abugattas (philosophy of science),\nJulio-Cesar Sanz-Elguera (philosophy of science), and David Sobrevilla\n(philosophy of the social sciences). Ever since, at San Marcos,\nLuís Piscoya has been working on the interface between\nphilosophy of science and education; he is the author of\nInvestigación Científica y Educacional: un Enfoque\nEpistemológico (1995), and numerous papers (e.g., Piscoya,\n1993). In the late 1970s, an innovative program in philosophy opened\nat UPCH, one of the leading research universities in the\nsubcontinent. Under Francisco Miró-Quesada, many international\nworkshops, seminars, and courses took place in Lima as part of this\nventure. From the late 1980s on, activity at UPCH continued through a\nprogram named “Scientific Thought”, headed by Alberto\nCordero, with the collaboration of Sandro D’Onofrio and other\nfaculty members. \nIn Chile, meanwhile, Gerold Stahl, Nathan Stemmer, and Augusto\nPescador made logic a major field in Chile in the 1960s. Later in the\ndecade, Roberto Torretti published a seminal book, Manuel Kant.\nEstudio sobre los Fundamentos de la Filosofía\nCrítica (1967; revised edition 2005). His subsequent work\non Kant led him to wider research on the philosophical history of\nscience, a field that had a growing audience, especially in Santiago.\nHowever, life in Chile became increasingly challenging as the decade\nprogressed. In 1970 Torretti left to Puerto Rico, where he continued\nto develop his philosophical work, especially on nineteenth-century\ngeometry and the theory of relativity. In 1973 a ruthless military\ndictatorship took over the government. It was a difficult time for\nacademia; Chile’s leading journal, Revista de\nFilosofía, ceased publication and remained dormant until\n1977. Although the institutional environment suffered greatly at most\ncenters, quality research continued in logic, as evidenced by\ninternationally acclaimed contributions during the period by Rolando\nChuaqui and others. \nNearly always based in Latin American centers (Chile and Puerto Rico),\nTorretti is an icon of rigor and philosophical sense and an author of\nworld-class level contributions; his writings are celebrated for his\ninsightful commentaries and educated perspectives on the rational\ndevelopment of ideas, especially in Galileo, Newton, Leibniz, Kant,\nnineteenth-century mathematics, Helmholtz, Poincaré, and\nEinstein. Torretti’s major publications on these subjects have a\nsecure place on the reading lists of leading seminars in philosophy of\nscience anywhere, in particular Philosophy of Geometry from\nRiemann to Poincaré (1978), Relativity and\nGeometry (1985), Creative Understanding: Philosophical\nReflections on Physics (1990), and The Philosophy of\nPhysics (1999), each an authoritative work in the philosophy and\nthe philosophical history of science. In the years that Torretti spent\nat the Rio Piedras Campus of Universidad de Puerto Rico, he\nled a fruitful career until his retirement in 1995. During most of\nthis period he was the editor of Diálogos, one of the\nleading philosophy journals in Latin America. \nOn the eastern side of the southern cone, developments of considerable\ninternational impact took place in Argentina between the 1940s and\n1970s. The arrival of Hans Lindemann in the 1940s marked a turning\npoint in analytic philosophy in Argentina where his discussions of\nthe philosophy of Bertrand Russell and the Vienna Circle (he had\nstudied under Moritz Schlick and been a member of the Circle)\nencouraged further activity, in particular research seminars and\ncourses by Mario Bunge, Gregorio Klimovsky, and Julio Rey Pastor.\nThroughout the 1950s, the Buenos Aires area enjoyed a decade of\noptimism about the academic and cultural possibilities of philosophy\nof science and its applications. Several centers prospered,\nparticularly two that were founded in 1952. In one of them,\nInstituto Libre de Estudios Superiores, Klimovsky and Rolando\nGarcía discussed the “logical empiricist” approach\nand gave courses that systematically presented the new philosophy to\nwider audiences. The other center was Círculo\nFilosófico, led by Bunge, where his book\nCausalidad (1959a) and other works of the period took shape,\nand their central materials were presented in lectures and\ndiscussions. Bunge and Klimovsky managed to secure chairs at\nUniversidad de Buenos Aires (UBA) in philosophy of science\nand logic, respectively. In the mid-1950s, their research and courses\nturned the university into a world-class place in the\nfield. Bunge’s administrative and cultural efforts during this\nperiod put a strong emphasis on making professional philosophical\nactivity possible in Argentina. A new association for logic and\nscientific philosophy, Agrupación Rioplatense de\nLógica y Filosofía Científica, was founded\nin 1956, aimed at drawing together thinkers from Argentina and Uruguay\nwho wanted to study philosophy in the rational and rigorous style of\nthe new approach, with Bunge, Klimovsky, Jorge Bosch, Gino Germani,\nand Rolando Garcia among its members. A consistent group began to\nform, resulting in such achievements as Cuadernos de\nEpistemología, a series that gave the whole of Latin\nAmerica and Spain access to key works in the field translated into\nSpanish. \nIn Causalidad, Bunge (1959a) focused on the empiricist\nconception of causality and its shortcomings, blaming the empiricist\noutlook for having created unnecessary confusion and pessimism in\nphilosophy. In this work Bunge distinguishes causal determination from\nother forms of determination (structural, teleological, dialectical,\nand statistical), telling apart three different senses in which the\nterm “causality” enters scientific discourse—as a\nlaw stating that same causes produce same effects, as a relation\nbetween cause and effect, and as a principle stating that everything\nhas a cause. The book came out in 1959, gaining considerable\ninternational reception, especially due to the realist conception it\narticulates. Causality also marks a turning point: philosophy\nbooks one may call “classics” were now coming out of Latin\nAmerica and finding a place in mainstream reading lists in the\nEnglish-speaking world and Europe. A citizen of the world, perhaps the\nmost universalist of philosophers in the subcontinent, Bunge is\nnonetheless very South American (it is hard to imagine him growing up\nanywhere else but in cosmopolitan Argentina). Bunge has always been a\nsocially engaged intellectual, a trend already present in his efforts\nas founder and secretary general of a college for workers,\nUniversidad Obrera Argentina, from 1938 until 1943. He has\nremained a spirited spokesman for the need to maintain in Latin\nAmerica cultural and educational institutions capable of promoting the\npractice of philosophy by minds free from ideological pressure,\nfinancial oppression, and political or governmental control. First in\nArgentina and then elsewhere, Bunge has been at “war”\nagainst, as he puts it, the kind of uncritical understanding of\nphilosophy he found prevailing at the Faculty of Philosophy and\nLetters when he joined in the 1950s, laboring to inspire a lasting\nsense of professional rigor in his students and collaborators. The\nseries he launched, Cuadernos de Epistemología, had a\nsubstantial impact on scientists, philosophers, and the educated\npublic in the Spanish-speaking world. Bunge’s production during\nthese years was remarkable; apart from Causality, other works\nof relevance are Bunge (1959b, 1960, 1961a, 1961b, 1962a, and\n1962b). Unfortunately, these accomplishments were not achieved without\nfriction with colleagues and groups sympathetic to alternative ideas\nBunge could not respect. In addition, the country’s political\nand economic conditions were deteriorating. Early in the 1960s,\ninternal fractions within the Argentine army began to make civic life\nincreasingly difficult. Bunge left the country in 1963, first to the\nUnited States (where the Vietnam War and other political developments\nmade him uncomfortable), then moving in 1966 to McGill University,\nMontreal, where he remains to this day. \nFew thinkers associated with analytic philosophy strive to produce a\ncomprehensive philosophical system. Bunge is one of them, a thinker\ntrying to integrate ontology, metaphysics, epistemology, semantics,\npsychology, and science coherently and fruitfully. Thus far\nBunge’s publications make more than fifty books and hundreds of\nphilosophical and scientific articles, mostly in English and Spanish;\nhis main works were also translated into German, Italian, Russian, French,\nHungarian, and Portuguese among other languages. His works of\ngreatest impact in mainstream philosophy of science are arguably\nCausality (1959a), The Myth of Simplicity (1963),\nand Foundations of Physics (1967). Bunge’s search for a\nnaturalist vision worth having was given systematic expression in his\nTreatise on Basic Philosophy (an eight-volume work published\nbetween 1974 and 1989). More recent publications by Bunge include\nEmergence and Convergence: Qualitative Novelty and the Unity of\nKnowledge (2003), Chasing Reality: Strife over Realism\n(2006), and Medical Philosophy: Conceptual Issues in Medicine\n(2013), as well as his much-awaited autobiography Memorias entre\nDos Mundos (2014), to mention a fraction of his abundant\nproduction.  In his oral presentations and seminars, Bunge pays forceful and\nparticular attention to the evaluation of the arguments at hand,\nchampioning the use of logic as an expediter of clarity of thought. He\nis renowned for his scathing critiques of positions that demean\nreason, the search for truth, and the universality of science,\nscientific naturalism, as well as positions that fail to respect human\nbeings as individuals. Bunge enthusiastically endorses the way in\nwhich the Enlightenment tried to disseminate conceptual and moral\ntools to revise and improve human thought and life in general.\nBunge’s works steadily emphasize the idea that science can lead\n(and has often led) to what he regards as the only sensible foundation\nfor social and political action: relevant knowledge of the world.\nImportantly, early on in Latin America Bunge played the role of a\nmuch-needed exemplar, a leading thinker who in the 1960s became a\n“possibility proof” that philosophers working in the\nsubcontinent could, despite the often bizarre difficulties academics\nface, stand up and join the philosophical conversation at the highest\nlevels. No Latin American philosopher had achieved anything comparable\nbefore in cosmopolitan philosophy. \nLosing Bunge was a major blow, one of many as the decade unfolded.\nWhen the military intervened the universities in 1966, many of the\nmost talented minds in science and the humanities fled the country.\nKlimovsky remained, however, and his presence helped keep the\ndiscipline active during this difficult period, first at UBA and then\nat Belgrano University from the late 1970s until his death. Philosophy\nof science did not stop in Argentina, young talent continuing to\narise, notably Alberto Coffa, at Universidad de la Plata until he too\nleft to the United States. The surrounding turmoil was a negative\nfactor, yet a remarkable period of expansion began at the end of the\ndecade, marked by the foundation of the Sociedad Argentina de\nAnálisis Filosofico (SADAF), a model institution supported\nby its own members, in which fellows and invited international guests\nmeet around topics of philosophical interest, including many of\ncentral importance in philosophy of science. A major journal saw the\nlight in Buenos Aires in 1975: Revista Latinoamericana de\nFilosofía, followed in 1981 by another important\nperiodical, Análisis Filosófico. \nActivity in philosophy of science has grown in the country since then,\nas the remaining sections of this article describe. \nAlthough Gregorio Klimovsky was one of the founding fathers of the\nphilosophy of science in Argentina, he was still active until the\nfirst decade of the twenty-first century. He introduced mathematical\nlogic and axiomatic set theory in Argentinian universities and\ndefended a hypothetico-deductive method close to that of Popper, not\nonly for natural sciences but also for social sciences. At the turn of\nthe century, he published three books that were very relevant in\nuniversity education (Klimovsky 1994, Klimovsky and Hidalgo 1998,\nKlimovsky and Boido 2005). Moreover, his autobiography (2008) presents\na vivid portrayal of the inception of analytic philosophy of science\nin Argentina. But perhaps the most important merit of Klimovsky was\nhaving been the teacher of several generations of Argentine logicians\nand philosophers of science such as Tomás Moro Simpson,\nRaúl Orayen, and Alberto Coffa. \nThe interest in Popper’s theses reappears in the work of Carlos\nVerdugo (2009). By contrast, Alejandro Cassini (2003) argues for the\nadvantages of the Bayesian theory of confirmation over the\nhypothetico-deductive method. \nThe semantic approach to scientific theory was studied by\nGermán Guerrero Pino (2008, 2010), who compared van\nFraassen’s proposal with that of the structuralist school. In\nturn, Juan Manuel Jaramillo Uribe (2009, 2014) builds a bridge\nbetween metatheoretical structuralism with other philosophical\nschools, such as French structuralism and structural realism. Pablo\nLorenzano has also developed sustained work in the field of\nmetatheoretical structuralism (Balzer and Lorenzano 2000, Lorenzano\nand Díez 2002, Lorenzano 2013), particularly applied to\nbiology, leading a research group with young members of different\nLatin American countries.  We noted that Francisco Miró-Quesada’s most heartfelt\nproject focused on the study of human reason, regarded as the capacity\nto reach truth in logic, science, metaphysics, and ethical theory\n(1962, 2013). In turn, from a perspective that defends rationality\nagainst the attacks of postmodern thought, Ricardo Gómez (2003)\ndevelops a strong criticism to Rorty’s arguments. A very radical\nposition is adopted by Gonzalo Munévar (1981) who considers the\nrationality of science a social property that should be understood in\nterms of biological performance. \nIn Mexico the interest in the rationality of science led to the\npublication of two relevant volumes on the subject, one compiled by\nAmbrosio Velasco (1997) and the other by Velasco and Ana Rosa\nPérez Ransanz, and Ambrosio Velasco (2011); the second contains\nmore than 40 contributions of Iberoamerican authors and offers a wide\npicture of the discussion on the matter in the region. In particular,\nSergio Martínez (2003) focused on the relationship between\nrationality and scientific practices.  More recently, problems of the empirical equivalence between\ntheories and the underdetermination of theory choice were addressed by\nPablo Acuña, particularly in the case of Lorentz’s ether\ntheory and Einstein’s special relativity (Acuña and Dieks\n2014, Acuña 2014a). Acuña (2014b) also analyses three\nartificial cases of empirical equivalence, arguing that they are not\nthe result of practice of real science but cooked up by philosophers\nof science. \nAs a consequence of his close collaboration with Jean Piaget (Piaget\nand García 1971, 1987), Rolando García became the author\nwho still represents genetic epistemology in Latin America (1997). In\nparticular, he developed with Piaget the idea of a parallelism between\npsychogenesis and the evolution of sciences (Piaget and García\n1983). More recently, García (2000) linked genetic epistemology\nwith the theory of complex systems.  Already in the nineties, Oscar Nudler began to develop a view of\nthe dynamics of science in terms of conflicts (1990). This view became\na well-articulated model based on what he called “controversy\nspace” (Nudler 2002, 2004): a dynamic structure composed of\ninter-related controversies, with a “focus”, composed by\nthe issues that are the main object of the disagreements, and a\n“common ground”, which consists of the commitments not\nsubject to discussion within the controversy space. Controversy spaces\ntypically change by re-focalization which occurs when certain\nassumptions move from the common ground to the focus. This model was\nsuccessfully applied to different scientific cases, such as the\norigins of chaos theory, the debate about the relations between\nchemistry and physics, the origins of molecular biology, and the\ndevelopment of twentieth century American linguistics, among others\n(see Nudler 2011). \nThe philosophy of Thomas Kuhn attracted the interest of many Latin\nAmerican philosophers of science. For instance, during the 1980s, some\nCuban scholars focused on the Kuhnian concept of scientific revolution\n(Núñez 1985, 1989). In Uruguay, Mario Otero (1997)\nedited a volume about Kuhn with contributions from his research\ngroup. After his retirement, the group was left in the hands of\nLucía Lewowicz, who continued that line of research (2004,\n2005), focusing particularly on the Kuhnian notion of taxonomic\ncategory (2007). In Colombia, the research group of Jaramillo Uribe\nalso compiled a collective volume devoted to the philosophy of Kuhn\n(Jaramillo Uribe et al. 1997) and, in a more recent book, Guerrero\nPino (2003) considered the relevance of the Kuhnian philosophy for\nscience education. In Argentina, Nélida Gentile (2013)\npublished a book on incommensurability commemorating the 50th\nanniversary of The Structure. The book Kuhn y el Cambio\nCientífico, by Ana Rosa Pérez Ransanz (1999),\ndeserves particular attention, for it has been much discussed in the\nSpanish-speaking world and, as a consequence, was reprinted two times\n(2000, 2012).  After getting his PhD under the supervision of Paul Feyerabend,\nGonzalo Munévar became one of the main international\nspecialists on the philosophy of the author (see the compilation of\nhis articles in Munévar 2006). Moreover, Munévar (1998)\nadvocates for an evolutionary philosophy that leads to a thorough\nevolutionary relativism of scientific knowledge which, nevertheless,\nis not an obstacle to a theory of relative truth.  Christián Carman worked extensively on the problem of\nrealism in science. He offered a detailed elucidation of the term\n“scientific realism” (2005a), and he considered the\ntheoretical-observational distinction in light of the problem of\nrealism (2005b). Carman also critically analyzed Harré’s\ninductive argument for scientific realism (2005c). Moreover, he\nreformulated the no-miracle argument in order to apply it to\nsimultaneous predictions (2010b), in particular in the context of\nPtolemy’s planetary theory (Carman and Díez 2015). \nRecently, some surveys of the arguments regarding the problem of\nrealism have been produced. For instance, Bruno Borge (2015)\nreconsiders the no-miracle argument 40 years after its formulation,\nand Borge and Gentile (2019) compiled a volume on the subject with\ncontributions from Latin American authors. \nAfter the strong influence of logical empiricism and its claim for the\n“unity of science”, in the last decades of the twentieth\ncentury many pluralist approaches were proposed from different\nperspectives. In Latin America, different pluralistic views have been\nadvanced. \nAlthough Félix Schuster was a student of Mario Bunge and\nGregorio Klimovsky, he directed his interest to social sciences. In\nthis field, he defends methodological pluralism as the way to access\nsocial reality (Schuster 1992). \nRoberto Torretti’s view of scientific knowledge finds its roots\nin his interpretation of Kant’s philosophy (Torretti 1967).\nAccording to Torretti, it does not follow from the transcendental\ndeduction of the categories that they are contained in a definitive\nand immutable list; by admitting that the patterns ruling the\nconstitution of the objects of knowledge may change, “Kant opens\na wide door to intellectual pluralism” (2008: 87). From this\nperspective, Torretti (2000) explicitly rejects the scientific realism\nthat conceives the aim of science as the development of a discourse\nthat “cuts reality at its joints”, and agrees with Hilary\nPutnam’s pragmatic realism (Putnam 1987) on the basis\nof some examples drawn from past and present scientific practice.  Also under the influence of Putnam, but now of his internal\nrealism (Putnam 1981), Olimpia Lombardi and Ana Rosa Pérez\nRansanz (2012) propose an ontological pluralism that, instead of being\napplied to the problem of theory change, finds its main fertility in a\nsynchronic sense: when theories embodying different conceptual schemes\nare simultaneously accepted, it must be admitted that different\nontologies may coexist since each one of them is constituted by its\ncorresponding theory. This view, which denies the ontological\ndependence of the supposedly “secondary” disciplines or\n“phenomenological” theories regarding those fields\nconceived as “fundamental”, has been applied to the\nrelationship between chemistry and physics with the purpose of\ndefending the ontological autonomy of the physical world (Lombardi and\nLabarca 2005); this view has sparked an intense debate in the field of\nthe philosophy of chemistry (it will be considered below, in the\nsubsection about the philosophy of chemistry). \nThe role played by models in science was studied in Latin America\nsince the first years of the twentieth century. In México,\nAlfredo López Austin (2005) compiled a volume including five\ncontributions that explore the meaning and the nature of scientific\nmodels. Recently, Mario Casanueva and Ximena\nGonzález-Grandón (2016) edited a special issue of the\njournal Scientiae Studia, whose articles fall into two\ngroups: those in the first group emphasize that models amplify our\ncapacities of representation, perception, and calculation; those in\nthe second stress the function of models in legitimating scientific\nknowledge.  Also very recently, Alejandro Cassini paid close attention to the\nnature of scientific models. In particular, he criticizes\nfictionalism, which conceives models as useful fictions (Cassini\n2013), and contends that every scientific model has a target against\nthose who claim that some models do not (Cassini 2018). In turn,\nHernán Accorinti (2015a, 2015b) discussed the problem of the\nautonomy of models with respect to theories, with applications to\nchemistry; in particular, to atomic and molecular models in quantum\nchemistry (Accorinti and Martínez González 2016,\nAccorinti, Fortin, and Martínez González 2018) and to\nthe different models of electronegativity (Accorinti 2019). \nAlthough not directly concerned with models, an interesting volume\nabout the epistemic role of images in science was published as the\nresult of a workshop held in Mexico D.F. in 2007 (Casanueva and\nBolaños 2009). In the introduction to the volume, the editors\nrefer to the “pictorial turn” to stress the\nincreasing relevance of pictorial representation as an epistemic\nvehicle for science, where “pictorial” includes not only\nvisual pictures but also tactile and auditory representations. \nAlthough Mario Bunge’s already classical book Causality\n(1959a) was a landmark in the study of causation, it was only several\ndecades later that the interest on causation took off in the region.\nEduardo Flichman developed a “deflationist” view of\ncausation according to which causation is not an ontological relation\nbetween events but an anthropomorphic asymmetric relation that\nspeakers project over reality. From this perspective, Flichman (1989)\ncriticized the counterfactual theory of causation proposed by David\nLewis (1973) by showing that clear cases of causation can be\nmeaningfully reversed and, therefore, challenge the supposed asymmetry\nof causation. \nThis criticism sparked an interesting debate in the Mexican journal\nCritica during the 1990s. Dorothy Edgington (1990) accepted\nFlichman’s criticism as an argument against the possibility of\nanalyzing the concept of causation. Horacio Abeledo (1995), in turn,\nshowed that there would be a “formal” way out of\nFlichman’s criticism, but with no philosophical support. From an\nopposite perspective, Helen Beebee (1997) explicitly responded to\nFlichman’s argument and to Abeledo’s conclusion by arguing\nthat the putative counter-example presented by Flichman is not in fact\na counter-example after all. Both Flichman and Abeledo reacted to\nBeebee’s paper. On the basis of a refutation of Beebee’s\nargument, Flichman (2000) elaborated on his criticism of Lewis’s\ntheory and his defense of an acausal position. Finally, Abeledo (2000)\noffered a clear and detailed summary of the whole controversy, adding\nnew arguments against Beebee’s view but stressing his\ndisagreements with Flichman’s position.  Other Latin American authors were interested in causation. For\nexample, Sergio Martínez (1997) provides a detailed review of\nthe role of causation in scientific explanation along the history of\nscience. In Santiago de Chile, Wilfredo Quezada Pulido leads a\nresearch group mainly devoted to study physical causation. In his\npublished works, Quesada Pulido (2002) compared the theories of causal\ntransference, of causal processes, and of conserved quantities, and\nanalyzed the manipulability theory of causation in the light of the\nproblem of anthropomorphism (2007). More recently, Fernanda Samaniego\nappeals to the manipulability approach to define a notion of\n“explanatory depth” (2014) and to account for spin-echo\nexperiments (2013, 2015).  His work on causation led Flichman (1990, 1995) to discuss the\nconcept of scientific law: according to him, the distinction between\nlaws of nature and accidental uniformities depends on the role they\nplay in a scientific theory; moreover “hard” and\n“soft” accidental uniformities must be carefully\ndistinguished because the latter are frequently confused with laws of\nnature. Pablo Lorenzano (1998, 2007) also reflects upon the concept of\nlaw of nature in relation to the existence of biological laws.  The history of science from a philosophical perspective has been\nextensively studied in Latin America. For instance, in Argentina\nGuillemo Boido has strongly promoted the area; his book on Galileo\n(Boido 1996) not only offers a historical narrative, but also explains\nhistoriographic discussions in light of the historical record. In\nColombia, Mauricio Nieto Olarte (2000, 2007) developed relevant\nresearch work on the origins of science in the region during the\ncolonial period. In Mexico, Laura Benítez published several\nworks on early science (e.g., Benítez 1993, 2000, 2004), and\ndeveloped a long and fruitful collaboration with José Antonio\nRobles about science in Modern times (e.g., Benítez and Robles\n2000, 2006; Robles and Benítez 2004). Also in México,\nGodfrey Guillaumin (2005) studied the historical evolution of the\nnotion of scientific evidence.  Some philosophers of science of the region also manifested their\ninterest in particular events of the history of science. For instance,\nPablo Mariconda analyzed Galileo’s tide theory (1999), the\nsimple machines designed by Galileo (2008), and Galileo’s\nargument for the autonomy of science (Lacey and Mariconda 2012). He\nalso studied the method of astronomy according to Kepler (Tossato and\nMariconda 2010).  In turn, Alejandro Cassini and Marcelo Levinas developed a\nfruitful collaboration studying different aspects of the history of\nphysics at the beginning of twentieth century, particularly regarding\nEinstein’s works: Einstein’s reinterpretation of\nMichelson-Morley experiment (Cassini and Levinas 2005), his\nexplanations of photoelectric effect (Cassini and Levinas 2008;\nCassini, Levinas, and Pringe 2015) and of the Compton effect (Cassini,\nLevinas, and Pringe 2013), his reinterpretation of Fizeau experiment\n(Cassini and Levinas 2019), as well as the role played by the ether in\nthe conceptual change to special relativity (Cassini and Levinas\n2009). In the quantum context, Olival Freire Jr. (2015) published a\nbook that traces the passionate foundational controversies that\naccompanied the ripening of quantum physics during the second half of\nthe twentieth century.  The works of Christián Carman deserve a special mention\nsince they make him a top-ranked international specialist in ancient\nastronomy due to their quantity and quality. His first works focused\non Ptolemy’s calculations and explanations (Carrman 2009, 2010a,\n2011, 2015; Recio and Carman 2018), but soon his interest expanded to\nother authors, such as Aristarchus (2014), Martianus Capella (2017a),\nCopernicus (2018), and Heraclides of Pontus (2017b). In an additional\nline of research, Carman collaborated with the renowned scholar James\nEvans in a detailed study of the Antikythera mechanism which resulted\nin several very relevant works (Evans, Carman, and Thorndike 2010;\nCarman, Thorndike, and Evans 2012; Carman and Evans 2014). Carman\ndeveloped further his analyses of the mechanism, in some cases in\nsingle-authored works and in other cases in collaborartion with other\ninternational scholars (Anastasiou, Seiradakis, Carman, and Efstathiou\n2014; Carman and di Cocco 2016; Carman 2017c). Finally, Carman has\nrecently extended his collaboration with Evans beyond the original\ninterest in the Antikythera mechanism, examining other issues in\nancient astronomy (Carman and Evans 2015). \nIn Latin America, the discussions about science and values have\ntraditionally focused on the question of the dependence of scientific\nresearch in Latin American countries on the agenda set by central\ncountries. Due to their local interest, most of the material was\nwritten in Spanish. In 1971, a debate, remembered until today for its\nphilosophical and political significance, confronted Oscar Varsavsky\nand Gregorio Klimovsky in Argentina. For Varsavsky (1971), since\nscience is essentially ideology-laden, ideology must appear explicitly\nin scientific policy as a guide toward a new social order. Klimovsky\n(1971), by contrast, advocated for a neutral basic science: politics\nappear mostly in the application of scientific knowledge. The original\ndebate was complemented with the contribution of other prominent\nArgentine thinkers, and appeared in 1975 as the book Ciencia y\nIdeología. Aportes polémicos (Klimovsky et\nal. 1975). In the same year, Jorge Sabato compiled a significant book\nwith articles by more than twenty specialists about ideology in\nscience, relations between science, technology, and society, the\nstructural scientific-technological dependence of Latin America, the\nproduction of technology, and the planning of scientific-technological\ndevelopment in Latin American countries. The lively debates of those\nyears were drastically interrupted by the military coup\nd’état in Argentina in 1976.  The claim for a Latin American science, guided by regional\ninterests and ideological views, is in resonance with those\nphilosophical and sociological studies, like that of Enrique Dussel\n(1995) which denounces the Eurocentric “myth of modernity”\nthat justifies the superiority of European culture over Native\nAmerican cultures. In turn, the need to contextualize scientific\nknowledge in the framework of social needs of a particular community\nalso appears in the works of Rolando García (1981) under the\nconcept of interdisciplinary research, that is, a research that\ncombines different theoretical approaches in the search for solving\nlocalized social requirements.  Whereas the above contributions focused mainly on natural science,\nthe interest in how social knowledge is produced in Latin America has\ngrown during the last decades. An example of this interest is the book\nof Leandro Rodríguez Medina (2014) which examines the\ncirculation of knowledge within globalization, focusing on the\ndifferences between centers and peripheries of knowledge production in\nthe social sciences, and in the ways in which foreign ideas shape\nperipheral fields.  Two philosophers of science, who are well-known in the Latin\nAmerican communities, were also very interested in issues connected\nwith social and political values in science, although from different\nperspectives. Since the 1990s, León Olivé (1988 [1993])\nstood at the interface between the philosophy and the sociology of\nknowledge, trying to explain the double nature of knowledge as a\nsocial construct and a representation of reality. More recently, his\ninterest focused on how technology has pervaded contemporary society,\nmodeling both knowledge and values (Olivé 2007).  Ricardo\nGómez, by contrast, develops his position in open confrontation\nwith neoliberalism (2002, 2017a). On this basis, he considers that the\nethical dimension of science and technology should stand against\nneoliberal principles from a clear political position (Gómez\n2017b). \nThe interaction between scientific activities and values has been the\ninterest of Pablo Mariconda (Lacey and Mariconda 2014a, 2014b). In\nparticular, Mariconda (2014) discusses the technological risks\nassociated with transgenic agriculture. Along the same lines, Guillemo\nFolgera analyzes the techno-scientific discourse regarding genetically\nmodified organisms (Folguera, Carrizo, and Massarini 2014) and\ndenounces the omission of risks in the use of such organisms (Francese\nand Folguera 2018).  In the context of science, society, and values, studies that\ncombine the reflection upon scientific knowledge with gender matters\nmust be mentioned. For instance, Fabrizzio (now Siobhan) Guerrero Mc\nManus (2016) provides Spanish-speaking readers with an overview of a\nfeminism that seeks to develop a critical framework aimed at\ndetecting, exposing, and correcting the many gender biases nowadays\npresent in the sciences. In this context, the works of Diana\nMaffía cannot be forgotten since she has critically analyzed\nthe links between gender and science in the past twenty years or so\n(e.g., Maffía 2001, 2005, 2006, 2007; Rietti and Maffía\n2005). \nAlthough Mario Bunge and Roberto Torretti were central figures for the\nphilosophy of physics in Latin America, their early emigration\nprevented them from starting research lines around their works. As a\nconsequence, the development of the philosophy of physics in the\nregion is relatively recent.  Quantum mechanics is one of the focuses of the research group led\nby Olimpia Lombardi which developed its work in two directions: the\ninterpretation of the theory and the analysis of the meaning of\ndecoherence. Regarding the first topic, Lombardi and Mario Castagnino\nproposed the modal-Hamiltonian interpretation of quantum mechanics: a\nrealist, non-collapse interpretation that endows the Hamiltonian with\na determining role. The interpretation proved to be effective in\nexplaining ideal and non-ideal measurements and many other well-known\nphysical situations such as hydrogen atom, Zeeman effect, fine\nstructure, etc. (Lombardi and Castagnino 2008). The interpretation was\nreformulated in a Galilean invariant form (Ardenghi, Castagnino, and\nLombardi 2009; Lombardi, Castagnino, and Ardenghi 2010), and was\napplied to further situations, such as the non-collapse account of\nconsecutive measurements in physics (Ardenghi, Lombardi, and Narvaja\n2013), the understanding of quantum decoherence (Lombardi, Ardenghi,\nFortin, and Castagnino 2011), the view of quantum measurement in\ninformational terms (Lombardi, Fortin, and López 2015), and the\nproblem of optical isomerism in chemistry (Fortin, Lombardi, and\nMartínez González 2016, 2018). In addition, the\nmodal-Hamiltonian interpretation proposes a bundle-of-properties\nontology that adequately accounts for contextuality and\nindistinguishability (da Costa, Lombardi, and Lastiri 2013; da Costa\nand Lombardi 2014), but without preventing the emergence of particles\nunder certain particular circumstances (Lombardi and Dieks 2016).  By stressing the distinction between collapse and decoherence,\nOsvaldo Pessoa (1997) criticized the assumption that decoherence\nsolves the measurement problem. Following Pessoa’s view,\nCastagnino, Sebastian Fortin, and Lombardi (2010) deepened the\ncriticisms of the orthodox approach to decoherence (see also Lombardi,\nFortin, and Castagnino 2012; Fortin and Lombardi 2014, 2017), proposed\na new approach for closed systems (Castagnino and Lombardi 2004;\nFortin and Lombardi 2018), and developed a general conceptual\nframework for decoherence in closed and open systems (Castagnino,\nLaura, and Lombardi 2007). On the basis of this new perspective, the\nresearch group offered a particular view of the classical limit of\nquantum mechanics (Castagnino and Lombardi 2005; Fortin and Lombardi\n2016) and applied it to the problem of defining the quantum ergodic\nhierarchy (Castagnino and Lombardi 2007; Gómez and Castagnino\n2014). \nIn the subtle frontier between logic and physics, Décio Krause\ndeveloped an impressive work related to the quantum challenges to\nthe notions of identity and individuality. Already in his PhD\ndissertation, under the supervision of Newton da Costa, Krause\nsupplied a semantics to the so-called “Schrödinger\nlogic” (da Costa and Krause 1994, 1997) designed to account for\nelementary quantum particles. This work led him to formulate his\nquasi-set theory (Krause 1991, 1992, 1996a, 1996b), according\nto which there are urelements for which identity makes no sense.\nKrause’s semi-extensional quasi-set theory was compared with the\nintensional quaset theory developed by Maria Luisa dalla Chiara and\nGiuliano Toraldo di Francia (dalla Chiara, Giuntini, and Krause 1998),\nand was applied to particular problems in the foundations of quantum\nmechanics (Sant’Anna and Krause 1997; Krause, Sant’Anna,\nand Volkov 1999; Krause 2000; Domenech, Holik, and Krause 2008). \nKrause also developed an intense collaboration with Steven French to\ndevelop a concept of individuality for the quantum ontology (Krause\nand French 1995, 2007; French and Krause 1995, 1999, 2003); they also\nadvanced some ideas about individuality in quantum field theory\n(French and Krause 2010). This collaboration gave rise to a very\nrelevant book on the matter (French and Krause 2006), which discusses\nthe problem of individuality in philosophy and in classical and\nquantum physics and articulates quasi-set theory as a theory for\nnon-individuals.  More recently, Krause produced a relevant collaborative work with\nJonas Arenhart, his former PhD student, about quantum\nnon-individuality (Krause and Arenhart 2012, 2016a) and its\ncompatibility with Einstein’s realism (Krause and Arenhart\n2014). They also examined the view of quantum particles as individuals\nin a primitive sense (Arenhart and Krause 2014a, 2014b). This\ncollaboration led to a recent book about the logical foundations of\nscientific theories (Krause and Arenhart 2016b). In recent years,\nKrause also worked with da Costa in the application of paraconsistent\nlogics to physics (da Costa and Krause 2014, 2016).  Still in the field of the interpretation of quantum mechanics,\nElías Okon and Daniel Sudarsky (2014a, 2014b) criticized Robert\nGriffiths’s consistent histories approach by arguing that it is\ninterpretively vague and does not solve the measurement problem. These\nworks were rebutted by Griffiths (2015), and the rebuttal was\nimmediately answered by Okon and Sudarsky (2015a) by claiming that the\nconsistent histories interpretation introduces anthropomorphic terms\nnot contained in the formalism. In turn, based on Okon and\nSudarsky’s criticism, Marcelo Losada and Lombardi (2018) defend\na “formalism of contextual histories” which is free from\nthe shortcomings of Griffiths’s proposal. \nGiven the need for an observer-independent interpretation of quantum\nmechanics for cosmology, Okon and Sudarsky (2014c) defended an\nobjective collapse theory for the application to cosmology and quantum\ngravity, and on this basis, they proposed an adaptation of objective\ncollapse models to a general relativistic context (2018a). The authors\nalso examined the black hole information loss paradox as a situation\nthat can be accounted for by collapse interpretations (Okon and\nSudarsky 2015b, 2017, 2018b).  Other aspects and interpretations of quantum mechanics have also\nbeen explored. For instance, Sergio Martínez explored the\nphysical content of the Luders Rule (1990, 1991), Pessoa (2005)\nproposed a modal logical treatment of quantum mechanics, and Pablo\nAcuña (2016b) pointed out the difficulties in defining the\nnotion of inertial trajectory in Bohmian mechanics which is considered\na different theory and not a different interpretation of quantum\nmechanics (Acuña forthcoming). In turn, Rodolfo Gambini, Luis\nPedro García-Pintos, and Jorge Pullin (2010, 2011) devised an\ninterpretation that offers a solution to the quantum measurement\nproblem based on the loss of coherence due to the use of realistic\nclocks. \nMatters not directly related to quantum mechanics have also been\nstudied by Latin American philosophers of physics. For instance,\nAcuña (2016a) critically assessed the debate concerning the\ndirection of explanation between Minkowski spacetime and the Lorentz\ninvariance of dynamical laws. Diego Romero-Maltrana (2015) analyzes\nthe relationship between symmetries and conserved quantities supported\nby Noether’s theorems in order to argue for the priority of\nconserved quantities over symmetries.  The problem of time’s arrow was addressed by Castagnino,\nLombardi and collaborators by elaborating on John Earman’s\nheresy (1974) according to which the arrow of time is a geometrical\nproperty of the universe (Castagnino, Lombardi, and Lara 2003). This\nglobal arrow is transferred to the local domain as an energy flow that\npoints to the same time direction on the entire spacetime (Castagnino\nand Lombardi 2009), which in turn supplies the foundations for local\nirreversible theories (Aiello, Castagnino, and Lombardi 2008).\nCastagnino and Lombardi also collaborated with Manuel Gadella, one of\nthe authors of the time-asymmetric quantum mechanics, in order to\nanalyze irreversibility and time’s arrow in the quantum realm\n(Castagnino, Gadella, and Lombardi 2006), a work recently followed by\nCristian López (2019). \nAlthough the philosophy of chemistry is a relatively young\nsubdiscipline in philosophy of science,it has attracted the interest\nof several researchers in Latin America. \nThe group led by Olimpia Lombardi worked on the topic since 2005 when\na paper advocating for the ontological autonomy of chemistry (Lombardi\nand Labarca 2005) was published. The paper sparked a hot debate which\nbegan with a criticism by Paul Needham (2006) that was immediately\nresponded by Lombardi and Labarca (2006), and was followed by many\nother authors. In the meantime, Labarca and Lombardi (2010) also argued for\nthe existence of orbitals in the ontology of chemistry relying on\nontological pluralism. On the basis of the impact of her view,\nLombardi (2014a) reviewed and organized the different criticisms and\noffered a systematic response to them; in turn, with Mariana\nCórdoba, she stressed the Kantian roots of her ontological\npluralism (Córdoba and Lombardi 2013). \nGiven her antireductionist perspective, Lombardi (2013, 2014b) also\ncriticized the book of Hinne Hettema (2012), Reducing Chemistry to\nPhysics, stressing the many difficulties that must be faced by\nthose who insist on the reduction of chemistry to physics; the papers\nreceived immediate replies from Hetterma (2014).  The problems regarding the relations between chemistry and physics\nwere addressed by Lombardi’s group from various perspectives. In\nparticular, they brought to light several interpretive issues of\nquantum mechanics that are not accommodated when the theory is used in\nchemistry (Lombardi and Castagnino 2010; Martínez\nGonzález, Fortin, and Lombardi 2019) and argued that quantum\ndecoherence does not solve the problem of isomerism (Fortin, Lombardi,\nand Martínez González 2016). They also began to examine\nthe issue of the relationship between chemistry and quantum mechanics\nfrom a theoretical perspective, such as the Quantum Theory of Atoms in\nMolecules (Jaimes Arriaga, Fortin, and Lombardi 2019) and Bohmian\nmechanics (Fortin, Lombardi, and Martínez González\n2017); this last paper was critically assessed by Giovanni Villani,\nElena Ghibaudi, and Luigi Cerruti (2018).  As a continuation of her previous work in Spanish, Lombardi (2012)\noffered a critical analysis of Ilya Prigogine’s proposals. In\nturn, with Lucía Lewowicz, she analyzed the ontological\ncategory of stuff as required by macro-chemistry (Lewowicz and\nLombardi 2013). The problem of the categories underlying the chemical\ndiscourse was also addressed in the context of the group by\nCórdoba and Alfio Zambon (2017) for the particular case of\nnano-materials. A particular mention is needed to Zambon’s\n(2018) completely new representation of the periodic system based on\natomic-number triads. \nGuillermo Restrepo focused his interest on how formal tools can be\napplied to chemistry. With José Luis Villaveces, he noted the\nresemblance between Leibniz’s and Lavoisier’s programs\nregarding a lingua philosophica for understanding nature\n(Restrepo and Villaveces 2011) and reviewed the origins of\nmathematical thinking in chemistry (Restrepo and Villaveces 2012).\nRestrepo also analyzed the mathematical aspects of the periodic law\n(Restrepo and Pachón 2007) and considered the different\nfoundational aspects of the field called “mathematical\nchemistry” (2013; Restrepo and Villaveces 2013). Restrepo has\nbeen working in Germany since 2014 where he still produces interesting\ncontributions to the philosophy of chemistry.  The development of the technological aspects of chemistry has been\nthe interest of José Antonio Chamizo (2013, 2017, 2019) with\napplications to chemistry education. \nThe philosophy of biology in the region has been developed in various\ndirections from the most traditional topics in the area to more\ninnovative questions. \nThe traditional topic of natural selection is treated in relation to\nits explanatory power by Pablo Lorenzano in collaboration with the\nSpanish philosopher José Díez (Díez and Lorenzano\n2013, 2015). Santiago Ginnobili (2016) offers a metatheoretical\nstructuralist reconstruction of Darwin’s theory with the purpose\nof elucidating the concept of ecological fitness, and Mario Casanueva\n(2011) proposes a structuralist reconstruction of the mechanism of\nnatural selection by means of graph resources. In turn, Gustavo Caponi\n(2013) studies the concepts of function, fitness, and adaptation in\nnatural selection theory.  Closely related with natural selection, the issue of evolution is\napproached from very different perspectives. For instance, Guillemo\nFolguera stresses the dependence of macroevolution on microevolution\neven in the criticisms of the synthesis since the seventies (Folguera\nand Lombardi 2012), and Maurizio Esposito (2011) supplies examples of\nhow Darwinism was used and adapted in different contexts. But the most\nextensive work on this issue has been developed by Edna\nSuárez-Díaz who focused specifically on molecular\nevolution. In this field, she studied the role played by the concept\nof informational molecule and by the idea of molecular evolution of\ninformational molecules in differentiating molecular from classical\nevolutionists and in the constitution of genomics\n(Suárez-Díaz 2009, 2010). Despite stressing the\nimportance of the molecular experimental approach in evolutionary\nbiology (Suárez-Díaz and Barahona 1996),\nSuárez-Díaz acknowledges the methodological and\nconceptual difficulties embedded in the use of molecular evidence to\nelaborate molecular phylogenies (Suárez-Díaz and\nAnaya-Muñoz 2008; Suárez-Díaz 2014a), and\nemphasizes the generative nature of experimentation\n(Suárez-Díaz 2013).  Heredity, always linked with biological knowledge, has been the\ntopic of interest of Carlos López-Beltrán who shows the\ntransformation of the concept from playing a metaphorical role to\nacquire a narrative role (1994) and subsequently being conceived in\nstatistical terms (2006). By relating heredity with genetics, Esposito\n(2017) emphasizes the longstanding relationships between the\nreductionist view of gene as hereditary unit, the idea of information\nencoded in DNA, and the prophecies about the power of controlling\ngenetic information. From a structuralist perspective, Lorenzano\noffers a metatheoretical reconstruction of classical genetics (Balzer\nand Lorenzano 2000), paying special attention to the Hardy-Weinberg\nlaw within population genetics (2014).  Mario Casanueva (1997)\nexplores the relationship among the sexual theory of reproduction,\nMendelian genetics, and Mendel’s hybridisation theory. In turn,\nJuan Manuel Torres (1997, 2002, 2006) focuses on the use of genetic\ntests in medical practice, and Anna Barahona (2007) considers how\ndifferent inheritance issues can be represented by genetic maps.  Fabrizzio (now Siobhan) Guerrero Mc Manus examines methodological\nproblems: the rational selection of an algorithm for phylogenetic\ninference (2009), and the limitations of mechanistic explanations when\ndealing with developmental mechanisms (2012). In turn, the issue of\ncausation is treated by Maximiliano Martínez in terms of the\nconcept of multi-level causation (Martínez and Moya 2011;\nMartínez and Esposito 2014). The ideas of a multiplicity of\nlevels and of downward causation appears repeatedly in the works of\nCharbel El-Hani (El-Hani and Pereira 1999; El-Hani and Emmeche 2000;\nQueiroz and El-Hani 2006), with the purpose of advocating for property\nand process emergence in biology.  In collaboration with El-Hani, João Queiroz has developed\nextensive work on the biosemiotic approach to biology (El-Hani,\nQueiroz, and Stjernfelt 2010; Queiroz, Emmeche, Kull, and El-Hani\n2011; Queiroz 2012; Queiroz, Stjernfelt, and El-Hani 2014), and its\nrelationship with genetic information (El-Hani, Queiroz, and Emmeche\n2006). From a completely different viewpoint,\nSuárez-Díaz (2007) discusses what she considers the\nmetaphor of information in molecular biology. \nOther non-classical but currently very relevant topics in life\nsciences are also treated in the region, such as environmental matters\n(Klier et al. 2017), ecology (Nunes-Neto, Moreno, and El-Hani 2014),\nand evo-devo (Baedke and Mc Manus 2018).  Finally, it is worth mentioning a recent trend that, in the\nconfluence among philosophy, anthropology, and biology, considers\npolitical issues in biological research (Wade et al. 2015;\nGarcía-Deister and López-Beltrán 2015; Delgado\n2018), studies genomic variations in Latin America\n(Suárez-Díaz 2014b; Anaya-Muñoz,\nGarcía-Deister, and Suárez-Díaz 2017), examines\nthe relationship among genetic research, nationalism, and the\nconstruction of collective social identities (Kent et al. 2015), and\nexplores the relationships among homosexuality, homophobia, and\nbiomedical sciences in the region (Mc Manus 2014). \nSometimes very close to logic itself, the philosophy of logic has an\nimportant presence in Latin American philosophy of science from\nmultiple perspectives. \nThe logical treatment of contradiction attracted great interest,\nmainly in the groups of Campinas and Buenos Aires, although with\ndifferent motivations. In Campinas, where one underlying interest was\nthe possibility of modeling contradictory information in scientific\npractice, Newton da Costa focused on the mathematical concept of\n“pragmatic truth” (Mikenberg, da Costa, and Chuaqui 1986)\nwith the purpose of showing that the logic of pragmatic truth is\nparaconsistent (da Costa, Bueno, and French 1998). In turn, Walter\nCarnielli and Marcelo Coniglio developed an approach in which the\ndistinction between logic and philosophy is not straightforward. On\nthe philosophical side, and following the path opened by da Costa,\nthey focused on the so-called “logics of formal\ninconsistency”, a family of paraconsistent logics that can\nexpress the notion of consistency within the object language\n(Carnielli, Coniglio, and Marcos 2007). Carnielli also developed\ndialogical and epistemic approaches to paraconsistency (Rahman and\nCarnielli 2000; Carnielli and Rodrigues 2019).  In the group led by Eduardo Barrio at Buenos Aires, works on\ninconsistency were motivated by semantic reasons, in particular, the\ntreatment of paradoxes (Barrio 2010; Picollo 2012; Barrio and Picollo\n2013). They studied non-transitivity as a solution of paradoxes\n(Barrio, Rosenblatt, and Tajer 2015; Barrio, Pailos, and Szmuc 2018),\nand considered non-traditional approaches to paradoxes (Da Ré\nand Rosenblatt 2018). Some members of the group were also interested\nin classical recapture in the contexts of paraconsistent logic\n(Teijeiro forthcoming) and of logics of formal inconsistency (Tajer\nforthcoming). Recently, Barrio and collaborators have begun to focus\nspecifically on paraconsistency in its different aspects (Barrio,\nPailos, and Szmuc 2017, forthcoming a; Barrio and Da Ré 2018b;\nBarrio, Clerbout, and Rahman forthcoming). \nThe strong contact between the groups of Campinas and Buenos Aires\nresulted in the publication of two special issues of the Logic\nJournal of the IGPL (Barrio and Carnielli forthcoming a,b)\ndevoted to logics of formal inconsistency. The interest in paradoxes\nand inconsistency also appeared in other authors of the region, such\nas Andrés Bobenrieth (1998).  Topics related to non-extensionality, in particular modal logics\nand Kripkean semantics, were also treated by some philosophers of\nlogic in Latin America (e.g., Mortari 2007; Marcos 2009; Estrada\nGonzález 2012; Rosenblatt and Szmuc 2014). In particular, Max\nFreund (2001, 2004, 2007, 2015) focused on modal logics with sortal\nquantifiers and wrote a collaborative book on modal logic\n(Cocchiarella and Freund 2008).  The question of the coexistence of different logics was\nadditionally addressed by the groups in Buenos Aires and\nCampinas. Whereas Barrio and collaborators discussed logical pluralism\n(Barrio, Pailos, and Szmuc forthcoming b), Carnielli and Coniglio\nfocused on the problems of translations between logics (Carnielli,\nConiglio, and D’Ottaviano 2009) and combinations of logics\n(Carnielli and Coniglio 2007 [2016]).  More traditional problems related with truth have also been\ntreated by the philosophers of logic of the region (e.g., Barrio and\nRodríguez-Pereyra 2015; Barrio and Da Ré 2018a). In\nparticular, Mario Gómez-Torrente (1998, 2000, 2002, 2008, 2006\n[2019]) developed a longstanding work on the notion of logical truth,\ntruth-preservation, and the relationships among logical truth,\nderivability, and model-theoretic validity. \nAlthough in the boundaries between logic and epistemology, the logic\nof belief revision and the works of Carlos Alchourrón\n(Alchourrón and Makinson 1981, 1982; Alchourrón 1996)\ncannot be forgotten: the AGM model (Alchourrón,\nGärdenfors, and Makinson 1985) is still the dominant theory of\nbelief revision (see entry logic\nof belief revision in this Encyclopedia). Andrés\nPáez (2006) uses the theory of belief revision to supply a\nconcept of explanation embodied with pragmatic conditions. Closely\nrelated with this topic, “defeasible reasoning” was\nextensively studied by Gustavo Bodanza and Fernando Tohmé\n(2005, 2009; Bodanza, Tohmé, and Simari 2016; Bodanza,\nTohmé, and Auday 2017; see also Bodanza 2002; Bodanza and\nAlessio 2017). Tohmé also supplied a category-theoretic\nrepresentation of abduction (Tohmé, Caterina, and Gangle 2015),\nand analyzed abduction in its application to economy (Crespo,\nTohmé, and Heymann 2010; Tohmé and Crespo\n2013). Abductive reasoning was also the main interest of Atocha\nAliseda (2003; Soler-Toscano, Nepomuceno-Fernández, and\nAliseda-Llera 2009), who applied abduction to medical diagnosis\n(Aliseda and Leonides 2013) and proposed a conditional logic to\nformalize abduction (Beirlaen and Aliseda 2014). She also published a\nbook completely devoted to abduction (Aliseda 2006), which not only\ndiscusses conceptual and formal matters, but also pays special\nattention to the epistemic applications of abductive reasoning. \nThe philosophy of cognitive sciences is a very complex field, mainly\ndue to the difficulty to distinguish it from other areas such as\nphilosophy of mind, epistemology, linguistics, philosophy of action,\nand logic.  The traditional topic of consciousness has been treated in its\nrelation to brain functions from a naturalized perspective by\nJosé Luis Díaz (1995, 2000) and more recently by Miguel\nAngel Sebastián (2014) on the basis of the neurophysiology of\ndreams; in turn, Beatriz Sorrentino Marques and Osvaldo Pessoa (2017)\nanalyze the role of consciousness in agent causation theories.\nAnother traditional topic, perception, is addressed by Juan Carlos\nGonzález who analyzes the process of perceptual recalibration\n(González, Bach-y-Rita, and Haase 2005) and the case of\nhallucinations (González 2010, 2016), and by Laura Danón\nand Daniel Kalpokas (2017) who offer an explanation of the direct\nperception of mental states of others. Juan Pablo Bermúdez, in\nturn, focuses on mental actions, supplying an account of skillful\naction that rejects both intellectualism and anti-intellectualism\n(2017) and claiming that remembering is not merely passive but must be\nviewed as a mental action (Arango-Muñoz and Bermúdez\n2018). In collaboration with Bermúdez, Alejandro Rosas stresses\nthe cognitive and non-cognitive roots of shared intentionality (Rosas\nand Bermúdez 2018) and the influence of cognitive dispositions\non weakness of will attribution (Rosas, Bermúdez, and\nGutiérrez 2018). \nIn addition to his collaborative work with Bermúdez, Rosas\ndeveloped an extensive work on the evolution of moral cognition and\nthe cognitive roots of cooperation (2002, 2008a). In particular, he\nclaims that altruism is selected both at the individual and at the\ngroup levels (2008b) and proposes a unified theory of human\ncooperation based on reciprocity (2010, 2012). Recently, with\ncolleagues coming from philosophy and from science, he has contributed\nto the research on moral judgment with moral dilemmas (Rosas and\nKoenigs 2014; Rosas, Viciana, Caviedes, and Arciniegas 2019).  An approach that received much attention in the region is that of\nembodied cognition and, in particular, enactivism (see González\n2013; Hutto and Satne 2017; Martínez, Español, and\nPérez 2018).  For instance, Ignacio Avila analyzes bodily\nawareness and its role in perceptual self-location (2014, 2017) and\nconsiders certain enactive accounts of perception (2015). Adrian\nCussins (2012) discusses the role that representation of the body\nplays in cognition. In turn, Maria Eunice Quilici González asks\nwhether embodied cognition can be applied to artificial systems as\nrobots (Haselager and González 2007a). \nAxel Barceló Aspeitia and Angeles Eraña focused their\nwork mainly on the modularity of mind in order to adapt the idea of\ndomain specificity (Barceló, Eraña, and Stainton 2010)\nand to compare the hypothesis of massive modularity to other views\nabout the structure of mind (Eraña 2012). In this context,\nClaudia Lorena García (2007) argues that the hypothesis of the\nmodularity of mind needs to be understood in terms of the evolutionary\nbiological concepts of variational independence (2007) and of\nfunctional homology and functional variation (2010).  Metacognition is the topic that attracted the interest of Santiago\nArango-Muñoz who distinguishes between the rationalizing level\nand the controlling level in metacognition (2011) and appeals to the\nconcepts of metamemory and metacognitive feelings to address the\ninteractions between the mind and the world (2013). Furthermore, he\nexplores the nature of the so-called “epistemic feelings”\nfrom a metacognitive perspective (2014, 2019).  Cognitive functions are approached from an informational\nperspective by M.E.Q. González, who analyzes mechanical models\nof intelligence (2005) and of reasoning (González, Broens, and\nD’Ottaviano 2007; Haselager and González 2007b). From the\nsame informational approach, Sebastián and Artiga (forthcoming)\nexplore metarepresentation. Other formal perspectives are adopted to\nverify the so-called cognitive task analysis (Laureano-Cruces and\nBarceló-Aspeitia 2002) and to analyze the agent’s\nresolution of conditional probability problems (Moro, Bodanza, and\nFreidin 2011). \nFrom a completely different viewpoint, several authors in the region\nprefer to understand cognitive phenomena in an analytical framework,\nspecifically in relation to language (e.g., Skidelsky 2013;\nGarcía-Ramírez 2011; García-Ramírez and\nShatz 2011) with affinity with research in philosophy of mind.  Certain methodological problems of social sciences have been\naddressed by Diego Ríos, who analyzed explanation with\nmechanistic and evolutionary models (2004; Kuchle and Ríos\n2015), and studied the relationship between methodological\nindividualism and methodological holism (Ríos 2005, 2009;\nRíos Pozzi 2007). In particular, the autonomy and\nirreducibility of economics has been discussed (Scarano 2012;\nGómez 2012). Nevertheless, almost all of the philosophy of\nsocial sciences in Latin America has been directed to theoretical\nissues in specific sciences or particular problems of the region.  A field that attracts great interest is the philosophy of history.\nElías Palti recalls the evolution and crisis of the area\n(2018), and distinguishes the so-called “politico-intellectual\nhistory” from the old “history of political ideas”\n(2010, 2014). Veronica Tozzi (2012a, 2016, 2018), in turn, proposes an\noriginal pragmatist approach to the philosophy of history, which\nappeals to Dewey’s notion of “practical meaning” in\nrelation to the knowledge of the past. Tozzi also focuses on the\nproblem of the roles memory and testimony play in representing the\nrecent past (2009, 2012b). In connection to these concepts, Esteban\nLythgoe (2011, 2014) analyzes how Paul Ricoeur articulates history,\nmemory, and testimony.  Other topics involved in the philosophy of history have also been\nconsidered: the historicity of the concept of subject (Palti 2004),\nthe ideas of progress (Ratto 2018), and of future (Belvedresi\n2018). In particular, María Inés Mudrovcic highlights\nthe different types of consciousness of temporality (2014) and\nanalyzes the political self-understanding of the present in terms of\nthe past in contemporary Western societies (2013). The impact of the\nphenomenon of globalization on historiographical paradigms (Brauer\n2018) and on the deformation of ethical and political concepts\n(Roldán 2018) are also examined. In turn, the idea of Global\nHistory is considered by Rosa Belvedresi (2012) who compares it with\nthe concept of universal history, and by Francisco Naishtat (2012) as\na framework for the Marxist debate on colonialism and\nmodernization. \nAt the crossroads between philosophy of politics and political\nphilosophy—if there is any difference between them—the\ncategories of equality and liberty (Hilb 1994), authority\n(Oyarzún 2012), and power (Oyarzún 2017) have been\nanalyzed. In this field, Naishtat has developed extensive research\nmainly directed to the critical evaluation of phenomena at the global\nscale. For instance, he analyzes the relationship between fragile\nsovereignties, global-intensive governance apparatuses, and a\nhorizon-less catastrophe-world (2010a), and argues that the political\ndimension of the global is global justice (2011). In turn, Naishtat\nstands in the context of recent political events, when he considers\nthe possibility of peace and rights transcending state frontiers in\nthe light of the 1990s Balkan wars (2000) and the\ndisplacement of the content of the terms “terror” and\n“terrorism” after 9/11 towards a meaning functional to\nglobalization (2010b).  Latin American themes are recurrent in the philosophy of social\nsciences of the region. Palti has been very active in this field: he\nstudied the nineteenth century Latin American intellectual history in\nthe context of the thesis of the essential contestability of concepts\n(2005), considered the limitations of the notion of “misplaced\nideas” by means of which Roberto Schwarz analyzed the dynamics\nof ideas in Latin America (2006), and critically examined the radical\ntransformation in the ways of conceiving the process leading to the\nbreak of colonial ties that linked Latin America with Spain\n(2009). Other authors share this interest in regional problems, such\nas Pablo Oyarzún (2007) who focused on Latin American\nsingularities, Gustavo Leyva (2014) who considered how the democratic\nproject was reformulated and radicalized in Latin America over the\nlast decades, and Ambrosio Velasco Gómez (2015) who proposes an\noriginal thesis about the intellectual roots of Mexican\nindependence. \nWhen Latin American themes are considered, the so-called Philosophy of\nLiberation cannot be forgotten: a philosophical movement that emerged\nin the late sixties in Argentina and spread through Latin America in\nthe following decades with authors such as Enrique Dussel, Leopoldo\nZea, Arturo Roig, Francisco Miró Quesada, Arturo Roig, and\nCarlos Cullen among many others. Nevertheless, here the topic will not\nbe treated because a complete entry of the Encyclopedia is devoted to\nit (Eduardo Mendieta,\n philosophy of liberation). \nThe philosophy of technology has attracted significant interest from\nLatin American researchers working from very different perspectives\nwhether ontological-epistemological or ethical-political. From a\ngeneral viewpoint, Ricardo Gómez (2010) offers a detailed\noverview of the philosophical ideas about technology.  Regarding the ontological status of technical artifacts and\nactions, Diego Lawler critically analyzes the functional and\nintentional theories about the nature of artifact kinks (Vega and\nLawler 2014) and proposes a praxeological approach to technological\npractices (Lawler 2018). In turn, Andrés Vaccari directs\ncriticisms to the functionalist assumptions underlying the dual nature\nof technical artifacts program (2013) and the extended cognition\ntheory applied to artifacts (2017), claiming that transhumanism has\nfailed in its aim to ground the transformation of the human condition\non technology (2015). The ontological status of artificial agents and\nartificial life was addressed by Mari González and Osvaldo\nPessoa (2008), who face the problem of whether life and autonomy could\nin principle be sustained with components other than carbon, and by\nDiego Parente (2018) who considers the challenges that these cases\npose to the traditional dichotomy between natural/artificial. Pablo\nRodríguez and Javier Blanco (2017), in turn, confront Gilbert\nSimondon’s theory of individuation with ideas coming from\ncybernetics. From an epistemological perspective Myriam Altamirano\nBustamante, Adalberto de Hoyos, and León Olivé (2011)\nargue that much of the tacit knowledge involved in technology can be\ntransmitted as explicit knowledge through patents. \nThe ethical and socio-political dimensions of technology are topics\nthat have received great attention in the region. For instance, Jorge\nLinares Salgado (2018) analyzes the ethical and societal consequences\nof the production of bio-artifacts derived from synthetic biology. A\nmore specific study is offered by Carlos Osorio Marulanda (2018), who\naddresses the problems related with drinking water production,\nespecially in rural areas of Latin America, from the perspective of\nscience, technology, and society (STS) studies. \nIn the area of STS studies, the extensive work of Hebe Vessuri\noccupies a relevant place. In the boundaries between sociology and\nphilosophy, Vessuri has addressed general problems from a regional\npoint of view. For example, she considers how the current admission of\nthe underlying ontological complexity of the world influences both the\nsocio-cognitive and the institutional organization of disciplinary\nknowledge, particularly in developing countries (2000) and how\nscience and technology can respond to the particular needs of Latin\nAmerican societies (2003). Vessuri also discusses the world\ndistribution of scientists, engineers, and technologists and the\nmovement of these personnel from peripheral countries to central\ncountries (de la Vega and Vessuri 2008). The readers interested in STS\nstudies in Latin America can turn to the article “Latin American\nscience, technology, and society. A historical and reflexive\napproach” (Kreimer and Vessuri 2018), which describes the\ndevelopment of STS in the region, its institutionalization and its\nspaces of interaction. \nFinally, two books in Spanish by León Olivé must be\nrecalled due to their impact in the Latin American community of\nphilosophers of science: whereas in the first (Olivé 2000)\nscience and technology are considered on a par, the second book\n(Olivé 2007) deals specifically with the different facets of\ntechnology. \nOther topics, not easily included in the traditional philosophies of\nparticular sciences, have also been addressed in Latin America.  What is now known as philosophy of information has been an\ninterest of Olimpia Lombardi and her research group from different\nperspectives. The meaning of the term “information” is\nelucidated from a general viewpoint (Lombardi 2004), paying particular\nattention to Shannon information (Lombardi 2005; Lombardi, Holik, and\nVanni 2016a), and arguing for a pluralistic interpretation of the\nconcept (Lombardi, Fortin, and Vanni 2015). By adopting a critical\nperspective regarding Christopher Timpson’s deflationary view of\ninformation (Lombardi, Fortin, and López 2016), it is argued\nthat there is no qualitative difference between Shannon and quantum\ninformation besides the difference in the way in which they are\nencoded (Lombardi, Holik, and Vanni 2016b). In turn, an\ninterpretational account of quantum measurement is offered (Lombardi,\nFortin, and López 2015). On the basis of this critical work,\nLombardi and Cristian López (2018) have elucidated the concept\nof information as used in Giulio Tononi’s Integrated Information\nTheory of consciousness, and have proposed a manipulation-based\ninterpretation of communicational information (López and\nLombardi 2019).  The philosophy of science as a resource for science education is a\ntopic that has acquired an increasing interest in Latin America during\nthe last decades. In this field, two authors have developed intensive\nwork. Agustín Adúriz-Bravo addressed the use of\nwell-known episodes from the history of science, such as the\nformulation of the pendulum law by Galileo (2004) and the discovery of\nradium by the Curies (Adúriz-Bravo and Izquierdo-Aymerich 2009)\nfor science education. Moreover, he applied the cognitive model of\nscience (Izquierdo-Aymerich and Adúriz-Bravo 2003;\nAdúriz-Bravo and Izquierdo-Aymerich 2005) and the semantic view\nof scientific theories (Adúriz-Bravo 2011, 2013) both to the\npractice of science teaching and to research on science education. He\nalso appealed to the so called “Nature of Science” view of\nscience for the education of science teachers (Adúriz-Bravo\n2007, 2014). On the basis of those theoretical bases,\nAdúriz-Bravo focuses on the philosophy of chemistry as a\nresource for the didactics of chemistry (Erduran, Adúriz-Bravo,\nand Mamlok Naaman 2007; Izquierdo-Aymerich and Adúriz-Bravo\n2009; Adúriz-Bravo, Merino, and Izquierdo-Aymerich 2012).  The interest of Charbel El-Hani is mainly centered on the\nphilosophy of biology for didactics of biology. He advocates for a\ntheory-centered approach to the concept of life (2008) and considers\nthe advantages of the dialogue between the students’\nethnobiological knowledge and biology school knowledge (Baptista and\nEl-Hani 2009). He also appeals to the works of Mendel and Darwin for\nteaching genetics and evolution (Bizzo and El-Hani 2009; El-Hani\n2015) and analyzes the different concepts of gene that often overlap\nin biology education (Dos Santos, Joaquim, and El-Hani 2012; Meyer,\nBomfim, and El-Hani 2013, Gericke, Hagberg, dos Santos, Joaquim, and\nEl-Hani 2014). Beyond the specific field of biology, El-Hani accounts\nfor the different ways in which individuals and societies represent\nconcepts (Aguiar Jr, Sevian, and El-Hani 2018), discusses how to deal\nwith the relations between different cultural perspectives in\nclassrooms (Moreira-dos-Santos and El-Hani 2017), and advocates for\nunderstanding as one of the major goals of science education\n(Ferreira, El-Hani, and da Silva Filho 2016). \nAfter reviewing the development of philosophy of science in Latin\nAmerica since its emergence in the mid-twentieth century, it can be\nsaid that there are some distinctive features in different countries.\nBut in the last decades, especially given the widespread use of the\nInternet and digital libraries by the mid-1990s, a growing\nintercommunication and collaboration can be verified as well as the\ntendency to form an academic community with an important international\npresence, which, at the same time, has certain characteristics of its\nown. Among the common features, the following deserve to be\nmentioned. \nFinally, it is worth stressing that the area strongly progressed in\nspite of the many obstacles that philosophical research faces in the\nregion; the erratic political situation and the cyclic economic crisis\nin Latin American countries influence research policies, and this\nplaces scholars in unstable and uncertain positions.  Nevertheless,\nregardless of the difficulties, at present a new generation of young\nphilosophers of science allows us to foresee that the philosophy of\nscience produced in Latin America will continue to grow in quantity\nand quality, increasing its already considerable international\npresence.","contact.mail":"acordelec@outlook.com","contact.domain":"outlook.com"},{"date.published":"2015-12-02","date.changed":"2020-02-07","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phil-science-latin-america/","author1":"Olimpia Lombardi","author2":"Ana Rosa Pérez Ransanz","author1.info":"http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Philosophy/Faculty-Bios/Alberto-Cordero","entry":"phil-science-latin-america","body.text":"\n\n\nWhen philosophy of science began as a professional field in the late\n1940s, contributions from Latin America joined the forefront of the\ninternational debate right away. Philosophers of science from the\nsubcontinent have expanded their presence ever since. This article\naims to provide an overview of philosophy of science in the\nsubcontinent. The primary focus is on contributions produced in Latin\nAmerica by thinkers living in the region, with an emphasis on\n“mainstream philosophy of science”—a discipline\ncentered on the study of scientific knowledge, metaphysics,\nmethodology, and values, broadly analytic in style, as exemplified by\nworks published in high-quality journals such as Philosophy of\nScience, Erkenntnis, The British Journal for the\nPhilosophy of Science, and Studies in the History and\nPhilosophy of Science.\n\n This entry has four parts. Section 1 provides historical\nbackground.  Section 2 is devoted to philosophy of science activity in\nvarious regional centers through the early 1990s when the Internet and\nimproved institutional resources “globalized” the practice\nof philosophy of science, greatly blurring earlier geographical\nseparations. The two following sections focus on the last decades:\nSection 3 presents contributions to the general philosophy of science,\nand Section 4 reviews advances in the philosophy of special\nsciences. The final Section 5 briefly considers some of the\ndifficulties and prospects for philosophy of science in Latin\nAmerica.\n\n\nIn this article effort is made to provide an even-handed and objective\npicture, but of course only a selective sketch is possible, made of\nchoices influenced by the authors’ interpretation of the\nfield.\n\nIt is useful to begin with a brief historical background. Science and\nscientific thought have long functioned in Latin America as beacons of\ncivic hope and progress amidst multiple recurrent frustrations that\nvary in kind and texture from place to place. In most of the region,\nthe Enlightenment ideals that fueled independence movements of the\nearly nineteenth century were quickly disappointed by the chaos and\ngeneral barbarism that followed in much of the region until the 1860s.\nIt was different in Brazil, where emancipation from Europe occurred\ngradually and orderly during the century, but there too problems\ngrew as did also tensions between the economic elite and the\ncountry’s leading liberal thinkers. \nReacting against expanding frustration, many Latin Americans saw a\nsolution in the “scientific” ways of thinking dominant in\nthe industrialized countries. In the 1850s a progressive philosophy\nwas in full flight in the larger world, ready-made for Latin American\nvisionaries: French Positivism, a doctrine of progress and secular\nreligion, centered on hope in modern science, led by Auguste Comte.\nCommitted to fighting the temptations of barbarism, the positivists\nsought to continue the project of the Enlightenment. Against the\nimpulsive approach to decision-making then prevailing in most of Latin\nAmerica, local positivists sought to extend scientific thought to\nphilosophy and political action, convinced it would promote\nobjectivity, rational consensus, publicly accessible cumulative truth\nin all spheres, along the material success characteristic of modern\nscience. Between about 1870 and 1910 positivism took strong hold in\nmuch of Latin America, with an agenda that called for methodological\nimprovement in the local practice of the natural sciences, medicine,\nand education, also greatly influencing activity in philosophy,\nhistory, art, and law (see, e.g., Frondizi 1943, Zea 1943–44,\nNachman 1977, Quintanilla 2006). In Argentina, scientism and\nComte’s philosophy had influential defenders, notably Domingo\nFaustino Sarmiento, many scientists (e.g., paleontologist Florentino\nAmeghino), physician-philosophers (e.g., José Ingenieros and\nAlejandro Korn), educators (e.g., Pedro Scalabrini), and lawyers\n(e.g., Carlos Octavio Bunge, whose nephew Mario A. Bunge would become\nan international figure in philosophy of science in the following\ncentury). A conviction these thinkers shared stated that a modern and\nefficient system of public education was indispensable for achieving\nthe desired transformations. Interest in advancing the positivist approach\ngrew to religious heights especially in Brazil, where it was\nchampioned by distinguished political figures, notably Miguel de\nLemos, a reorganizer of the country’s curriculum and a decisive\nforce in the construction of the first Humanity Temple for the\npropagation of Comte’s ideas in the world. When Brazil became a\nrepublic in 1889, positivist doctrine made its way to the new flag,\nthe motto “Order and Progress” lifted from Comte’s\nwritings—in Système de Politique Positive\n(1851), the preliminary discourse’s conclusion begins with the\nwords “Love for principle, order for base, and progress for\naim” (L’amour pour principe, l’ordre pour base, et le\nprogrès pour but; p. 321). \nThe influence of positivism in Mexico was nearly as strong,\nparticularly in education, as exemplified by the labors of the\nrespected chemist and medical doctor Gabino Barreda, who banned\nreligion and traditional philosophy from the school curriculum and\ncentralized access to higher education and culture. In Chile, the\nbrothers Jorge and Enrique Lagarrigue were two leading advocates of\nComte’s philosophy and his Humanity Religion. In Colombia, Rafael\nNuñez, an educational reformer and three times president of\nColombia, actively promoted positivism, as did in Peru (with touches\nof Herbert Spencer’s evolutionism) such figures as Javier Prado,\nManuel González Prada, Celso Bambarén, and Manuel\nVicente Villarán. In Bolivia, positivism also had influential\ndefenders from the 1870s through the 1890s, notably a circle of\nwriters, “Círculo Literario”, in whose\njournal works by Charles Darwin, Luis Dumont, Ernst H. P. A.  Haeckel\nand other naturalists appeared in translation. \nWith all this intellectual and progressive enthusiasm in the air,\nhopes of imminent general improvement ran high, but\n“positive” results were slow in coming. The expectations\nof economic advancement and civic improvement did not materialize as\nadvertised. To compound matters, the devastation caused by the Great\nWar in Europe badly compromised social faith in the products of\nscience. Positivism waned accordingly in Latin America, replaced in\nthe 1920s by a more radical social thought, especially Marxism, as well\nas approaches distrustful of naturalist reasoning (Bergsonian\nspiritualism, phenomenology, and later existentialism). Metaphysics\nunbridled by standard logic became dominant in many university\ncircles.  Reactions to excessively “high philosophy” began to\narise in the 1940s, helped by the arrival of thinkers from Europe, for\nexample Juan David García Bacca in the cases of Ecuador,\nMexico, and Venezuela, Hans Lindemann in Argentina, and Gilles-Gaston\nGranger in Brazil. Along the way came a revival of interest in logic,\nscience-friendly epistemology, and the study of conceptual structures.\nThanks to these developments, when philosophy of science became a\nprofessional field in the late 1940s, Latin America had some\nscientists and philosophers ready and willing to fully join their\ncounterparts in Europe and North America. Since then, for the past\nseventy years, a number of philosophers of science based in Latin\nAmerica, often in uncooperative environments, have managed to produce\nwork of the highest international standards (something not so clearly\napparent in the developing world in other branches of international\nphilosophy). \nBy the mid 1990s, academic centers in Latin America began to benefit\nfrom the kind of world-wide interaction made possible by the Internet,\nelectronic libraries, and improved forms of institutional support for\nintegration and travel. With geographical and institutional barriers\ngreatly reduced, the field expanded considerably. Over the last\nthree decades virtually every theme in philosophy of science would\ndevelop a presence in works produced in Latin America. Dialogue and\ncollaboration between researchers now transcend the traditional local\nboundaries. This new global environment makes less relevant the\ntraditional geographical approach to philosophical production in the\nregion. Accordingly, Sections 3 and 4, devoted to activity from the\nmid 1990s on, structure the subject around themes, concepts, and\nprinciples (rather than around geography and individuals). \nPhilosophy of science developed a robust presence at Universidad\nNacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), a major institution\nat the forefront of intellectual life in the country and the\nSpanish-speaking world. The discipline gained strength in the 1960s\nand early 1970s through the efforts of prominent faculty members,\nespecially Fernando Salmerón, Luis Villoro, and Alejandro Rossi\nwho encouraged rigor and clarity in philosophy and provided\nscholarship support to enable students to do post-graduate work in\nEurope, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Together they\nfounded the journal Crítica in 1967, a choice venue\nfor philosophy in Latin America and Spain. An influential work by\nSalmerón, La Filosofía y las\nMatemáticas, came out the following year. Major\ninternational seminars and meetings became a regular feature at\nUNAM’s Institute for Philosophical Investigations (Instituto\nde Investigaciones Filosóficas—IIF), which in the\n1970s and 1980s hosted some now legendary seminars and short courses\nled by world-class figures. One of these international seminars\nfocused on the history and philosophy of science, started by Mario\nBunge (Argentina and Canada). IIF became the host of many spirited\nphilosophical debates, those between Bunge and Héctor-Neri\nCastañeda (Guatemala and the United States) being among the\nmost prominentely remembered. With Bunge’s help, in 1976 an\nepistemology forum was established—Asociación\nMexicana de Epistemología. At the beginning of the 1970s,\nMario Otero (Uruguay) formally joined IIF with a considerable effect\non the studies of the philosophical history of science. \nThe structuralist approach came to Mexico in a big way with Carlos\nUlises Moulines who moved to IIF from Munich in the mid-1970s. Born in\nVenezuela, he studied in Europe, first under the supervision of\nJesús Mosterín in Barcelona and then of Wolfgang\nStegmüller in Munich. His early focus was on the rise of the\nlogical empiricist approach, particularly the projects of logical\nreconstruction of the empirical world variously advocated by Bertrand\nRussell, Rudolf Carnap, and Nelson Goodman; Moulines developed these\ninvestigations in his first monograph, La Estructura del Mundo\nSensible (1973). He took an interest in integrating some of\nStegmüller’s original contributions into earlier\nstructuralist work by Patrick Suppes in the United States and Gunther\nLudwig in Germany, an effort displayed by some of his articles from\nthis period (notably Moulines 1975, 1976). Responding to the\nhistorical turn in philosophy of science, Moulines, like Joseph Sneed\nin the United States and Stegmüller in Germany, focused on the\nissue of theory change. He devoted much of his research during the\n1970s and 1980s to the dynamics of theories, applying the resources of\ndiachronic structuralist reconstruction and Kuhnian analysis (in terms\nof disciplinary matrices) to the development of Newtonian mechanics\nand equilibrium thermodynamics. The resulting investigations were\npresented in the book Exploraciones Metacientíficas\n(1982). Moulines became an important intellectual force at IIF where\nhe stayed for over a decade, engaged in cutting-edge research that\nmade him a leading figure in the international structuralist\nmovement. In Moulines’ view, scientific theories are cultural\nconstructs of philosophical interest. He regards philosophy of science\nas a discipline whose epistemology is primarily interpretive rather\nthan prescriptive or descriptive—a theorization about\ntheorizations. A good proportion of the philosophy of science\nconducted at IIF during his tenure was directly influenced by him. A\nrelevant point for present purposes is that his work in Mexico during\nthese years reached the highest levels within the worldwide\nstructuralist movement. In 1984 Moulines left the country, first to\nBielefeld University, then to Berlin, and finally to the Center for\nMathematical Philosophy at Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich,\nwhere he became Stegmüller’s successor and is now a\nProfessor Emeritus. Many of his subsequent publications had a lasting\nimpact in Latin America, notably An Architectonic for Science: The\nStructuralist Program (Balzer, Moulines, and Sneed 1987), along\nmany papers.  Research seminars at IIF continued to develop and strengthen in\nthe 1980s with a series of international symposia of philosophy\nstarted by Enrique Villanueva and continued by León\nOlivé, a venture of impressive scale that brought together\nworld-class figures from many parts of Latin America, the United\nStates, Britain, and Europe. The high-quality interactions these\nvenues generated proved remarkably fruitful as starting points of much\nsubsequent research activity in Mexico and elsewhere in the\nsubcontinent. This period was also marked by institutional investment\nin specialized research libraries and the reinforcement of publishing\nprograms at UNAM and other institutions in Mexico. Scholarship\nprograms helped researchers and students spend periods at major\ninternational centers. At IIF philosophical research reached a level\nof support never seen before in Latin America. Significant papers and\nmonographs began to flow regularly from seminars on general philosophy\nof science, the philosophy of physics, and the philosophy of\nbiology. \nActivity in the field also became more diverse at IIF in the 1980s.\nOne major area focused on the limits of scientific knowledge,\nrepresented by Luis Villoro’s 1982 critique of scientism in\nCreer, Saber, Conocer, where he advocates a revaluation of\n“wisdom” (characterized as knowledge drawn from lived\nexperiences), which in Villoro’s view is richly found in the\n“wise men” of traditional cultures; in this book he\nexplores how human reason has operated throughout history and the\nextent to which it has led to situations of domination and/or\nemancipation from subjection. \nIt is important to emphasize that the professionalization of the\nphilosophy of science in Mexico was achieved mainly through the\ncreation of specialized degree programs. Nowadays, the Posgrado en\nFilosofía de la Ciencia, founded at UNAM in 1993, is the\nprogram where most of the new generations now working in the\ndiscipline in Mexico have been trained. \nAn influential textbook by Gilles-Gaston Granger, Lógica e\nFilosofia das Ciências —first published in\n1955—is acknowledged as the first introduction to the field in\nPortuguese. A disciple of Gaston Bachelard, Granger taught at the\nUniversity of São Paulo (USP) from 1947 to 1953 and was a major\nforce in the development of philosophy of science in Brazil. His work\nfavored a historically-oriented approach hospitable to the Anglo-Saxon\nanalytic style. Back in Europe he associated himself with various\nphilosophical and social projects; in 1986 he was elected to the Chair\nof Comparative Epistemology at the Collège de France.\nThe research projects Granger started in Brazil continued after his\ntenure, especially thanks to the efforts of Oswaldo Porchat. \nIn 1964 a military coup led to government action eradicating academics\nsuspected of leftist sympathies, seriously disrupting many fields,\nincluding philosophy of science. Nevertheless, faculty groups were\nsoon able to restore activity. In 1970, at USP João Paulo\nMonteiro managed to start Ciência e Filosofia, a\njournal dedicated to logic and philosophy of science from a plurality\nof perspectives. Revitalization of the discipline continued throughout\nthe decade with timely research projects, often carried out in\nconjunction with international visits and courses, notably ones\norganized by Porchat, first at USP and after 1975 at State University\nof Campinas (UNICAMP), where he headed a new unit, Centro de\nLógica, Epistemologia e História da Ciência\n(CLE), whose members included Zeljko Loparic and other distinguished\nscholars. In 1977 CLE launched the prestigious journal\nManuscrito, supplemented in 1980 by Cadernos de Filosofia\ne História da Ciência, and in 1987 by a book series\n(Coleção CLE). CLE quickly became a symbol of\nhope for philosophers and historians of science as well as logicians.\nIn particular, CLE is involved in the articulation of\n“Paraconsistent Logic”, a field Newton C. da Costa began\nto develop in the late 1950s and early 1960s when he was working at\nFederal University of Paraná. Da Costa is one of the most\ncharismatic and energetic thinkers in Latin America, a world-class\nfigure in mathematics, logic, and philosophy of science, with a widely\nrecognized reputation for original works on non-classical logics, the\naxiomatization of scientific theories, and structuralist philosophy of\nscience, orientations that continue to be active in Brazil with such\nfigures as Itala D’Ottaviano and Walter Carnielli. \nIn philosophy of science CLE supports significant research on the\ncharacter and structure of modern science as well as its concepts and\ntheories—conducted from a variety of perspectives, including\ninvestigations in science teaching and the uses of philosophy of\nscience in education. Critical dialogue has been fostered through\nseminars, distinguished international visits, research funding,\nfaculty and student exchanges, interdisciplinary studies, and the\npublication of monographs and papers by Brazilian authors as well as\ntranslations of major works into Portuguese. Post-graduate studies and\npostdoctoral fellowships in logic and philosophy of science are\nthriving accordingly at UNICAMP. One scheme developed by CLE to\nattract promising faculty recently graduated from institutions\nworldwide produced excellent results. In the 1980s Michel Ghins and\nHarvey Brown energized analytic activity on space-time physics. Steven\nFrench did likewise in advancing the model-theoretic approach and the\nmetaphysics of quantum mechanics at Campinas. With the help of these\nand other recruits, philosophy of physics, mathematics, and formal\napproaches to the philosophy of science thrived. At Campinas, French\nand da Costa started a long-lasting collaboration that proved\nremarkably fertile, resulting in influential contributions to current\ndebates on the metaphysics of quantum mechanics, structuralism, and\nthe semantic approach to theories, as well as a fresher way of looking\nat the concept of truth (“pragmatic truth” and\n“partial truth”). These collaborations led to many papers\n(Da Costa and French 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993) as well as a book in\n2003, Science and Partial Truth: A Unitary Approach to Models and\nScientific Reasoning, which received international acclaim for\nthe light it casts on philosophical logic, structuralism, and\nrealism. Brown and French made Brazil their country, and it is easy to\nimagine how different the geography of philosophy of physics and\nmathematics might have turned out had circumstances in Brazil been a\nlittle kinder to academic life in the 1980s. Together with da Costa,\nthe international recruits and the local talents they began to nurture\nwould have probably turned CLE and USP (where Otávio Bueno had\nworked with da Costa) into top centers for philosophy of science in\nthe world. Destiny dictated otherwise, however; Ghins left to a\nprofessorship at Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium; Brown moved to a\ndistinguished career at Oxford, where he is now professor of the\nphilosophy of physics; and French went to the United States and then\nback to England where he is now professor of philosophy of science at\nthe University of Leeds and Editor-in-Chief of The British Journal\nfor the Philosophy of Science. Brown and French have each served\nterms as presidents of the prestigious British Society for the\nPhilosophy of Science. Happily, all these international old members\nmaintain productive ties with Brazilian groups. CLE has continued to\nprosper over the last two decades. \nPhilosophical activity has expanded in Brazil at many other\ninstitutions since the 1990s, as described in the following\nsections. \nAs with the previous countries, the field developed a presence in the\nAndean countries in the early days of professional philosophy of\nscience. \nIn Venezuela, Juan David García Bacca, a critic of Francisco\nFranco, was forced to leave Spain and arrived in Caracas in 1946 after\nperiods in Ecuador and Mexico. He led a productive career at the\nFaculty of Letters and Philosophy, Central University (Universidad\nCentral de Venezuela, UCV). In the mid-1930s, after completing a\ndoctoral dissertation on the logico-genetic structure of the physical\nsciences, García Bacca joined the Vienna Circle. In Latin\nAmerica he became a prolific writer, his works including\nTeoría de la relatividad (1941), La\nfísica (1962), Historia filosófica de la\nciencia (1963), Teoría y metateoría de la\nciencia, Vol. I (1977) and Vol II (1984). He remained a major\nforce in Caracas until 1971. In the 1970s and 1980s, Andrés\nKalnay led a small group interested in the foundations of quantum\nmechanics, first at UCV’s School of Physics and then at\nVenezuela’s leading center for scientific research,\nInstituto Venezolano de Investigaciones\nCientíficas. Presently UCV runs a master’s program\nin logic and philosophy of science coordinated by Franklin\nGalindo. \nPhilosophy of science in Colombia has long-enduring ties with\nContinental European schools, but analytic philosophy of science has\nnot been absent. Already in the 1950s Mario Laserna at Universidad\nde los Andes (Uniandes), Bogotá, promoted the study of\nlogic and the scientific philosophy of Hans Reichenbach. Subsequently,\nlocal groups, helped by international visitors, have played a\nconsistent role in the country, notably Gonzalo Munévar, a\nColombian philosopher of science now based in the United States, who\nvisits regularly his country. \nActivity in Peru started early in the 1950s, as attested by gatherings\norganized at Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (UNMSM,\nPeru’s oldest university) and Sociedad Peruana de\nFilosofía, both in Lima. Broad interest is also reflected\nin articles published in the 1950s and 1960s in the weekly literary\nsupplement of “El Comercio” by Oscar\nMiró-Quesada, Francisco Miró-Quesada, and other\nintellectuals interested in logic, science, and mathematics. Francisco\nMiró-Quesada, the country’s leading philosopher, was one\nof the pioneers in the development of modern philosophical logic and\nscience studies in Latin America, where he has indefatigably\nencouraged hope in the power of human reason. Miró-Quesada\ntaught at UNMSM for more than two decades, and then at Universidad\nCayetano Heredia (UPCH) and other centers in the country. He also\nheaded institutes for philosophical research, first at Universidad\nde Lima and subsequently at Universidad Ricardo Palma.\nMiró-Quesada was the author of numerous works in the area of\nphilosophy of science, including a book in the philosophy of\nmathematics, Filosofía de las Matemáticas\n(1954). He has also been a champion of research in logic in the region\n(it was Miró-Quesada who suggested to name Newton da\nCosta’s approach “paraconsistent logic”, which he\nhelped to promote). Miró-Quesada’s most heartfelt project\nfocused on the study of human reason, regarded as the capacity to\nreach truth, broadly understood, as outlined in his preliminary book\nApuntes para una Teoría de la Razón (1962),\nfollowed in 2013 by Esquema de una Teoría de la\nRazón, in which Miró-Quesada discusses the pursuit\nof rational validity in logic, science, metaphysics, and ethical\ntheory. In the early 1970s, young faculty trained in Europe and the\nUnited States expanded and updated the philosophical study of science\nin the country, particularly at UNMSM. Timely contributions were made,\nespecially by Luis Piscoya (philosophy of psychology and general\nphilosophy of science), Juan Abugattas (philosophy of science),\nJulio-Cesar Sanz-Elguera (philosophy of science), and David Sobrevilla\n(philosophy of the social sciences). Ever since, at San Marcos,\nLuís Piscoya has been working on the interface between\nphilosophy of science and education; he is the author of\nInvestigación Científica y Educacional: un Enfoque\nEpistemológico (1995), and numerous papers (e.g., Piscoya,\n1993). In the late 1970s, an innovative program in philosophy opened\nat UPCH, one of the leading research universities in the\nsubcontinent. Under Francisco Miró-Quesada, many international\nworkshops, seminars, and courses took place in Lima as part of this\nventure. From the late 1980s on, activity at UPCH continued through a\nprogram named “Scientific Thought”, headed by Alberto\nCordero, with the collaboration of Sandro D’Onofrio and other\nfaculty members. \nIn Chile, meanwhile, Gerold Stahl, Nathan Stemmer, and Augusto\nPescador made logic a major field in Chile in the 1960s. Later in the\ndecade, Roberto Torretti published a seminal book, Manuel Kant.\nEstudio sobre los Fundamentos de la Filosofía\nCrítica (1967; revised edition 2005). His subsequent work\non Kant led him to wider research on the philosophical history of\nscience, a field that had a growing audience, especially in Santiago.\nHowever, life in Chile became increasingly challenging as the decade\nprogressed. In 1970 Torretti left to Puerto Rico, where he continued\nto develop his philosophical work, especially on nineteenth-century\ngeometry and the theory of relativity. In 1973 a ruthless military\ndictatorship took over the government. It was a difficult time for\nacademia; Chile’s leading journal, Revista de\nFilosofía, ceased publication and remained dormant until\n1977. Although the institutional environment suffered greatly at most\ncenters, quality research continued in logic, as evidenced by\ninternationally acclaimed contributions during the period by Rolando\nChuaqui and others. \nNearly always based in Latin American centers (Chile and Puerto Rico),\nTorretti is an icon of rigor and philosophical sense and an author of\nworld-class level contributions; his writings are celebrated for his\ninsightful commentaries and educated perspectives on the rational\ndevelopment of ideas, especially in Galileo, Newton, Leibniz, Kant,\nnineteenth-century mathematics, Helmholtz, Poincaré, and\nEinstein. Torretti’s major publications on these subjects have a\nsecure place on the reading lists of leading seminars in philosophy of\nscience anywhere, in particular Philosophy of Geometry from\nRiemann to Poincaré (1978), Relativity and\nGeometry (1985), Creative Understanding: Philosophical\nReflections on Physics (1990), and The Philosophy of\nPhysics (1999), each an authoritative work in the philosophy and\nthe philosophical history of science. In the years that Torretti spent\nat the Rio Piedras Campus of Universidad de Puerto Rico, he\nled a fruitful career until his retirement in 1995. During most of\nthis period he was the editor of Diálogos, one of the\nleading philosophy journals in Latin America. \nOn the eastern side of the southern cone, developments of considerable\ninternational impact took place in Argentina between the 1940s and\n1970s. The arrival of Hans Lindemann in the 1940s marked a turning\npoint in analytic philosophy in Argentina where his discussions of\nthe philosophy of Bertrand Russell and the Vienna Circle (he had\nstudied under Moritz Schlick and been a member of the Circle)\nencouraged further activity, in particular research seminars and\ncourses by Mario Bunge, Gregorio Klimovsky, and Julio Rey Pastor.\nThroughout the 1950s, the Buenos Aires area enjoyed a decade of\noptimism about the academic and cultural possibilities of philosophy\nof science and its applications. Several centers prospered,\nparticularly two that were founded in 1952. In one of them,\nInstituto Libre de Estudios Superiores, Klimovsky and Rolando\nGarcía discussed the “logical empiricist” approach\nand gave courses that systematically presented the new philosophy to\nwider audiences. The other center was Círculo\nFilosófico, led by Bunge, where his book\nCausalidad (1959a) and other works of the period took shape,\nand their central materials were presented in lectures and\ndiscussions. Bunge and Klimovsky managed to secure chairs at\nUniversidad de Buenos Aires (UBA) in philosophy of science\nand logic, respectively. In the mid-1950s, their research and courses\nturned the university into a world-class place in the\nfield. Bunge’s administrative and cultural efforts during this\nperiod put a strong emphasis on making professional philosophical\nactivity possible in Argentina. A new association for logic and\nscientific philosophy, Agrupación Rioplatense de\nLógica y Filosofía Científica, was founded\nin 1956, aimed at drawing together thinkers from Argentina and Uruguay\nwho wanted to study philosophy in the rational and rigorous style of\nthe new approach, with Bunge, Klimovsky, Jorge Bosch, Gino Germani,\nand Rolando Garcia among its members. A consistent group began to\nform, resulting in such achievements as Cuadernos de\nEpistemología, a series that gave the whole of Latin\nAmerica and Spain access to key works in the field translated into\nSpanish. \nIn Causalidad, Bunge (1959a) focused on the empiricist\nconception of causality and its shortcomings, blaming the empiricist\noutlook for having created unnecessary confusion and pessimism in\nphilosophy. In this work Bunge distinguishes causal determination from\nother forms of determination (structural, teleological, dialectical,\nand statistical), telling apart three different senses in which the\nterm “causality” enters scientific discourse—as a\nlaw stating that same causes produce same effects, as a relation\nbetween cause and effect, and as a principle stating that everything\nhas a cause. The book came out in 1959, gaining considerable\ninternational reception, especially due to the realist conception it\narticulates. Causality also marks a turning point: philosophy\nbooks one may call “classics” were now coming out of Latin\nAmerica and finding a place in mainstream reading lists in the\nEnglish-speaking world and Europe. A citizen of the world, perhaps the\nmost universalist of philosophers in the subcontinent, Bunge is\nnonetheless very South American (it is hard to imagine him growing up\nanywhere else but in cosmopolitan Argentina). Bunge has always been a\nsocially engaged intellectual, a trend already present in his efforts\nas founder and secretary general of a college for workers,\nUniversidad Obrera Argentina, from 1938 until 1943. He has\nremained a spirited spokesman for the need to maintain in Latin\nAmerica cultural and educational institutions capable of promoting the\npractice of philosophy by minds free from ideological pressure,\nfinancial oppression, and political or governmental control. First in\nArgentina and then elsewhere, Bunge has been at “war”\nagainst, as he puts it, the kind of uncritical understanding of\nphilosophy he found prevailing at the Faculty of Philosophy and\nLetters when he joined in the 1950s, laboring to inspire a lasting\nsense of professional rigor in his students and collaborators. The\nseries he launched, Cuadernos de Epistemología, had a\nsubstantial impact on scientists, philosophers, and the educated\npublic in the Spanish-speaking world. Bunge’s production during\nthese years was remarkable; apart from Causality, other works\nof relevance are Bunge (1959b, 1960, 1961a, 1961b, 1962a, and\n1962b). Unfortunately, these accomplishments were not achieved without\nfriction with colleagues and groups sympathetic to alternative ideas\nBunge could not respect. In addition, the country’s political\nand economic conditions were deteriorating. Early in the 1960s,\ninternal fractions within the Argentine army began to make civic life\nincreasingly difficult. Bunge left the country in 1963, first to the\nUnited States (where the Vietnam War and other political developments\nmade him uncomfortable), then moving in 1966 to McGill University,\nMontreal, where he remains to this day. \nFew thinkers associated with analytic philosophy strive to produce a\ncomprehensive philosophical system. Bunge is one of them, a thinker\ntrying to integrate ontology, metaphysics, epistemology, semantics,\npsychology, and science coherently and fruitfully. Thus far\nBunge’s publications make more than fifty books and hundreds of\nphilosophical and scientific articles, mostly in English and Spanish;\nhis main works were also translated into German, Italian, Russian, French,\nHungarian, and Portuguese among other languages. His works of\ngreatest impact in mainstream philosophy of science are arguably\nCausality (1959a), The Myth of Simplicity (1963),\nand Foundations of Physics (1967). Bunge’s search for a\nnaturalist vision worth having was given systematic expression in his\nTreatise on Basic Philosophy (an eight-volume work published\nbetween 1974 and 1989). More recent publications by Bunge include\nEmergence and Convergence: Qualitative Novelty and the Unity of\nKnowledge (2003), Chasing Reality: Strife over Realism\n(2006), and Medical Philosophy: Conceptual Issues in Medicine\n(2013), as well as his much-awaited autobiography Memorias entre\nDos Mundos (2014), to mention a fraction of his abundant\nproduction.  In his oral presentations and seminars, Bunge pays forceful and\nparticular attention to the evaluation of the arguments at hand,\nchampioning the use of logic as an expediter of clarity of thought. He\nis renowned for his scathing critiques of positions that demean\nreason, the search for truth, and the universality of science,\nscientific naturalism, as well as positions that fail to respect human\nbeings as individuals. Bunge enthusiastically endorses the way in\nwhich the Enlightenment tried to disseminate conceptual and moral\ntools to revise and improve human thought and life in general.\nBunge’s works steadily emphasize the idea that science can lead\n(and has often led) to what he regards as the only sensible foundation\nfor social and political action: relevant knowledge of the world.\nImportantly, early on in Latin America Bunge played the role of a\nmuch-needed exemplar, a leading thinker who in the 1960s became a\n“possibility proof” that philosophers working in the\nsubcontinent could, despite the often bizarre difficulties academics\nface, stand up and join the philosophical conversation at the highest\nlevels. No Latin American philosopher had achieved anything comparable\nbefore in cosmopolitan philosophy. \nLosing Bunge was a major blow, one of many as the decade unfolded.\nWhen the military intervened the universities in 1966, many of the\nmost talented minds in science and the humanities fled the country.\nKlimovsky remained, however, and his presence helped keep the\ndiscipline active during this difficult period, first at UBA and then\nat Belgrano University from the late 1970s until his death. Philosophy\nof science did not stop in Argentina, young talent continuing to\narise, notably Alberto Coffa, at Universidad de la Plata until he too\nleft to the United States. The surrounding turmoil was a negative\nfactor, yet a remarkable period of expansion began at the end of the\ndecade, marked by the foundation of the Sociedad Argentina de\nAnálisis Filosofico (SADAF), a model institution supported\nby its own members, in which fellows and invited international guests\nmeet around topics of philosophical interest, including many of\ncentral importance in philosophy of science. A major journal saw the\nlight in Buenos Aires in 1975: Revista Latinoamericana de\nFilosofía, followed in 1981 by another important\nperiodical, Análisis Filosófico. \nActivity in philosophy of science has grown in the country since then,\nas the remaining sections of this article describe. \nAlthough Gregorio Klimovsky was one of the founding fathers of the\nphilosophy of science in Argentina, he was still active until the\nfirst decade of the twenty-first century. He introduced mathematical\nlogic and axiomatic set theory in Argentinian universities and\ndefended a hypothetico-deductive method close to that of Popper, not\nonly for natural sciences but also for social sciences. At the turn of\nthe century, he published three books that were very relevant in\nuniversity education (Klimovsky 1994, Klimovsky and Hidalgo 1998,\nKlimovsky and Boido 2005). Moreover, his autobiography (2008) presents\na vivid portrayal of the inception of analytic philosophy of science\nin Argentina. But perhaps the most important merit of Klimovsky was\nhaving been the teacher of several generations of Argentine logicians\nand philosophers of science such as Tomás Moro Simpson,\nRaúl Orayen, and Alberto Coffa. \nThe interest in Popper’s theses reappears in the work of Carlos\nVerdugo (2009). By contrast, Alejandro Cassini (2003) argues for the\nadvantages of the Bayesian theory of confirmation over the\nhypothetico-deductive method. \nThe semantic approach to scientific theory was studied by\nGermán Guerrero Pino (2008, 2010), who compared van\nFraassen’s proposal with that of the structuralist school. In\nturn, Juan Manuel Jaramillo Uribe (2009, 2014) builds a bridge\nbetween metatheoretical structuralism with other philosophical\nschools, such as French structuralism and structural realism. Pablo\nLorenzano has also developed sustained work in the field of\nmetatheoretical structuralism (Balzer and Lorenzano 2000, Lorenzano\nand Díez 2002, Lorenzano 2013), particularly applied to\nbiology, leading a research group with young members of different\nLatin American countries.  We noted that Francisco Miró-Quesada’s most heartfelt\nproject focused on the study of human reason, regarded as the capacity\nto reach truth in logic, science, metaphysics, and ethical theory\n(1962, 2013). In turn, from a perspective that defends rationality\nagainst the attacks of postmodern thought, Ricardo Gómez (2003)\ndevelops a strong criticism to Rorty’s arguments. A very radical\nposition is adopted by Gonzalo Munévar (1981) who considers the\nrationality of science a social property that should be understood in\nterms of biological performance. \nIn Mexico the interest in the rationality of science led to the\npublication of two relevant volumes on the subject, one compiled by\nAmbrosio Velasco (1997) and the other by Velasco and Ana Rosa\nPérez Ransanz, and Ambrosio Velasco (2011); the second contains\nmore than 40 contributions of Iberoamerican authors and offers a wide\npicture of the discussion on the matter in the region. In particular,\nSergio Martínez (2003) focused on the relationship between\nrationality and scientific practices.  More recently, problems of the empirical equivalence between\ntheories and the underdetermination of theory choice were addressed by\nPablo Acuña, particularly in the case of Lorentz’s ether\ntheory and Einstein’s special relativity (Acuña and Dieks\n2014, Acuña 2014a). Acuña (2014b) also analyses three\nartificial cases of empirical equivalence, arguing that they are not\nthe result of practice of real science but cooked up by philosophers\nof science. \nAs a consequence of his close collaboration with Jean Piaget (Piaget\nand García 1971, 1987), Rolando García became the author\nwho still represents genetic epistemology in Latin America (1997). In\nparticular, he developed with Piaget the idea of a parallelism between\npsychogenesis and the evolution of sciences (Piaget and García\n1983). More recently, García (2000) linked genetic epistemology\nwith the theory of complex systems.  Already in the nineties, Oscar Nudler began to develop a view of\nthe dynamics of science in terms of conflicts (1990). This view became\na well-articulated model based on what he called “controversy\nspace” (Nudler 2002, 2004): a dynamic structure composed of\ninter-related controversies, with a “focus”, composed by\nthe issues that are the main object of the disagreements, and a\n“common ground”, which consists of the commitments not\nsubject to discussion within the controversy space. Controversy spaces\ntypically change by re-focalization which occurs when certain\nassumptions move from the common ground to the focus. This model was\nsuccessfully applied to different scientific cases, such as the\norigins of chaos theory, the debate about the relations between\nchemistry and physics, the origins of molecular biology, and the\ndevelopment of twentieth century American linguistics, among others\n(see Nudler 2011). \nThe philosophy of Thomas Kuhn attracted the interest of many Latin\nAmerican philosophers of science. For instance, during the 1980s, some\nCuban scholars focused on the Kuhnian concept of scientific revolution\n(Núñez 1985, 1989). In Uruguay, Mario Otero (1997)\nedited a volume about Kuhn with contributions from his research\ngroup. After his retirement, the group was left in the hands of\nLucía Lewowicz, who continued that line of research (2004,\n2005), focusing particularly on the Kuhnian notion of taxonomic\ncategory (2007). In Colombia, the research group of Jaramillo Uribe\nalso compiled a collective volume devoted to the philosophy of Kuhn\n(Jaramillo Uribe et al. 1997) and, in a more recent book, Guerrero\nPino (2003) considered the relevance of the Kuhnian philosophy for\nscience education. In Argentina, Nélida Gentile (2013)\npublished a book on incommensurability commemorating the 50th\nanniversary of The Structure. The book Kuhn y el Cambio\nCientífico, by Ana Rosa Pérez Ransanz (1999),\ndeserves particular attention, for it has been much discussed in the\nSpanish-speaking world and, as a consequence, was reprinted two times\n(2000, 2012).  After getting his PhD under the supervision of Paul Feyerabend,\nGonzalo Munévar became one of the main international\nspecialists on the philosophy of the author (see the compilation of\nhis articles in Munévar 2006). Moreover, Munévar (1998)\nadvocates for an evolutionary philosophy that leads to a thorough\nevolutionary relativism of scientific knowledge which, nevertheless,\nis not an obstacle to a theory of relative truth.  Christián Carman worked extensively on the problem of\nrealism in science. He offered a detailed elucidation of the term\n“scientific realism” (2005a), and he considered the\ntheoretical-observational distinction in light of the problem of\nrealism (2005b). Carman also critically analyzed Harré’s\ninductive argument for scientific realism (2005c). Moreover, he\nreformulated the no-miracle argument in order to apply it to\nsimultaneous predictions (2010b), in particular in the context of\nPtolemy’s planetary theory (Carman and Díez 2015). \nRecently, some surveys of the arguments regarding the problem of\nrealism have been produced. For instance, Bruno Borge (2015)\nreconsiders the no-miracle argument 40 years after its formulation,\nand Borge and Gentile (2019) compiled a volume on the subject with\ncontributions from Latin American authors. \nAfter the strong influence of logical empiricism and its claim for the\n“unity of science”, in the last decades of the twentieth\ncentury many pluralist approaches were proposed from different\nperspectives. In Latin America, different pluralistic views have been\nadvanced. \nAlthough Félix Schuster was a student of Mario Bunge and\nGregorio Klimovsky, he directed his interest to social sciences. In\nthis field, he defends methodological pluralism as the way to access\nsocial reality (Schuster 1992). \nRoberto Torretti’s view of scientific knowledge finds its roots\nin his interpretation of Kant’s philosophy (Torretti 1967).\nAccording to Torretti, it does not follow from the transcendental\ndeduction of the categories that they are contained in a definitive\nand immutable list; by admitting that the patterns ruling the\nconstitution of the objects of knowledge may change, “Kant opens\na wide door to intellectual pluralism” (2008: 87). From this\nperspective, Torretti (2000) explicitly rejects the scientific realism\nthat conceives the aim of science as the development of a discourse\nthat “cuts reality at its joints”, and agrees with Hilary\nPutnam’s pragmatic realism (Putnam 1987) on the basis\nof some examples drawn from past and present scientific practice.  Also under the influence of Putnam, but now of his internal\nrealism (Putnam 1981), Olimpia Lombardi and Ana Rosa Pérez\nRansanz (2012) propose an ontological pluralism that, instead of being\napplied to the problem of theory change, finds its main fertility in a\nsynchronic sense: when theories embodying different conceptual schemes\nare simultaneously accepted, it must be admitted that different\nontologies may coexist since each one of them is constituted by its\ncorresponding theory. This view, which denies the ontological\ndependence of the supposedly “secondary” disciplines or\n“phenomenological” theories regarding those fields\nconceived as “fundamental”, has been applied to the\nrelationship between chemistry and physics with the purpose of\ndefending the ontological autonomy of the physical world (Lombardi and\nLabarca 2005); this view has sparked an intense debate in the field of\nthe philosophy of chemistry (it will be considered below, in the\nsubsection about the philosophy of chemistry). \nThe role played by models in science was studied in Latin America\nsince the first years of the twentieth century. In México,\nAlfredo López Austin (2005) compiled a volume including five\ncontributions that explore the meaning and the nature of scientific\nmodels. Recently, Mario Casanueva and Ximena\nGonzález-Grandón (2016) edited a special issue of the\njournal Scientiae Studia, whose articles fall into two\ngroups: those in the first group emphasize that models amplify our\ncapacities of representation, perception, and calculation; those in\nthe second stress the function of models in legitimating scientific\nknowledge.  Also very recently, Alejandro Cassini paid close attention to the\nnature of scientific models. In particular, he criticizes\nfictionalism, which conceives models as useful fictions (Cassini\n2013), and contends that every scientific model has a target against\nthose who claim that some models do not (Cassini 2018). In turn,\nHernán Accorinti (2015a, 2015b) discussed the problem of the\nautonomy of models with respect to theories, with applications to\nchemistry; in particular, to atomic and molecular models in quantum\nchemistry (Accorinti and Martínez González 2016,\nAccorinti, Fortin, and Martínez González 2018) and to\nthe different models of electronegativity (Accorinti 2019). \nAlthough not directly concerned with models, an interesting volume\nabout the epistemic role of images in science was published as the\nresult of a workshop held in Mexico D.F. in 2007 (Casanueva and\nBolaños 2009). In the introduction to the volume, the editors\nrefer to the “pictorial turn” to stress the\nincreasing relevance of pictorial representation as an epistemic\nvehicle for science, where “pictorial” includes not only\nvisual pictures but also tactile and auditory representations. \nAlthough Mario Bunge’s already classical book Causality\n(1959a) was a landmark in the study of causation, it was only several\ndecades later that the interest on causation took off in the region.\nEduardo Flichman developed a “deflationist” view of\ncausation according to which causation is not an ontological relation\nbetween events but an anthropomorphic asymmetric relation that\nspeakers project over reality. From this perspective, Flichman (1989)\ncriticized the counterfactual theory of causation proposed by David\nLewis (1973) by showing that clear cases of causation can be\nmeaningfully reversed and, therefore, challenge the supposed asymmetry\nof causation. \nThis criticism sparked an interesting debate in the Mexican journal\nCritica during the 1990s. Dorothy Edgington (1990) accepted\nFlichman’s criticism as an argument against the possibility of\nanalyzing the concept of causation. Horacio Abeledo (1995), in turn,\nshowed that there would be a “formal” way out of\nFlichman’s criticism, but with no philosophical support. From an\nopposite perspective, Helen Beebee (1997) explicitly responded to\nFlichman’s argument and to Abeledo’s conclusion by arguing\nthat the putative counter-example presented by Flichman is not in fact\na counter-example after all. Both Flichman and Abeledo reacted to\nBeebee’s paper. On the basis of a refutation of Beebee’s\nargument, Flichman (2000) elaborated on his criticism of Lewis’s\ntheory and his defense of an acausal position. Finally, Abeledo (2000)\noffered a clear and detailed summary of the whole controversy, adding\nnew arguments against Beebee’s view but stressing his\ndisagreements with Flichman’s position.  Other Latin American authors were interested in causation. For\nexample, Sergio Martínez (1997) provides a detailed review of\nthe role of causation in scientific explanation along the history of\nscience. In Santiago de Chile, Wilfredo Quezada Pulido leads a\nresearch group mainly devoted to study physical causation. In his\npublished works, Quesada Pulido (2002) compared the theories of causal\ntransference, of causal processes, and of conserved quantities, and\nanalyzed the manipulability theory of causation in the light of the\nproblem of anthropomorphism (2007). More recently, Fernanda Samaniego\nappeals to the manipulability approach to define a notion of\n“explanatory depth” (2014) and to account for spin-echo\nexperiments (2013, 2015).  His work on causation led Flichman (1990, 1995) to discuss the\nconcept of scientific law: according to him, the distinction between\nlaws of nature and accidental uniformities depends on the role they\nplay in a scientific theory; moreover “hard” and\n“soft” accidental uniformities must be carefully\ndistinguished because the latter are frequently confused with laws of\nnature. Pablo Lorenzano (1998, 2007) also reflects upon the concept of\nlaw of nature in relation to the existence of biological laws.  The history of science from a philosophical perspective has been\nextensively studied in Latin America. For instance, in Argentina\nGuillemo Boido has strongly promoted the area; his book on Galileo\n(Boido 1996) not only offers a historical narrative, but also explains\nhistoriographic discussions in light of the historical record. In\nColombia, Mauricio Nieto Olarte (2000, 2007) developed relevant\nresearch work on the origins of science in the region during the\ncolonial period. In Mexico, Laura Benítez published several\nworks on early science (e.g., Benítez 1993, 2000, 2004), and\ndeveloped a long and fruitful collaboration with José Antonio\nRobles about science in Modern times (e.g., Benítez and Robles\n2000, 2006; Robles and Benítez 2004). Also in México,\nGodfrey Guillaumin (2005) studied the historical evolution of the\nnotion of scientific evidence.  Some philosophers of science of the region also manifested their\ninterest in particular events of the history of science. For instance,\nPablo Mariconda analyzed Galileo’s tide theory (1999), the\nsimple machines designed by Galileo (2008), and Galileo’s\nargument for the autonomy of science (Lacey and Mariconda 2012). He\nalso studied the method of astronomy according to Kepler (Tossato and\nMariconda 2010).  In turn, Alejandro Cassini and Marcelo Levinas developed a\nfruitful collaboration studying different aspects of the history of\nphysics at the beginning of twentieth century, particularly regarding\nEinstein’s works: Einstein’s reinterpretation of\nMichelson-Morley experiment (Cassini and Levinas 2005), his\nexplanations of photoelectric effect (Cassini and Levinas 2008;\nCassini, Levinas, and Pringe 2015) and of the Compton effect (Cassini,\nLevinas, and Pringe 2013), his reinterpretation of Fizeau experiment\n(Cassini and Levinas 2019), as well as the role played by the ether in\nthe conceptual change to special relativity (Cassini and Levinas\n2009). In the quantum context, Olival Freire Jr. (2015) published a\nbook that traces the passionate foundational controversies that\naccompanied the ripening of quantum physics during the second half of\nthe twentieth century.  The works of Christián Carman deserve a special mention\nsince they make him a top-ranked international specialist in ancient\nastronomy due to their quantity and quality. His first works focused\non Ptolemy’s calculations and explanations (Carrman 2009, 2010a,\n2011, 2015; Recio and Carman 2018), but soon his interest expanded to\nother authors, such as Aristarchus (2014), Martianus Capella (2017a),\nCopernicus (2018), and Heraclides of Pontus (2017b). In an additional\nline of research, Carman collaborated with the renowned scholar James\nEvans in a detailed study of the Antikythera mechanism which resulted\nin several very relevant works (Evans, Carman, and Thorndike 2010;\nCarman, Thorndike, and Evans 2012; Carman and Evans 2014). Carman\ndeveloped further his analyses of the mechanism, in some cases in\nsingle-authored works and in other cases in collaborartion with other\ninternational scholars (Anastasiou, Seiradakis, Carman, and Efstathiou\n2014; Carman and di Cocco 2016; Carman 2017c). Finally, Carman has\nrecently extended his collaboration with Evans beyond the original\ninterest in the Antikythera mechanism, examining other issues in\nancient astronomy (Carman and Evans 2015). \nIn Latin America, the discussions about science and values have\ntraditionally focused on the question of the dependence of scientific\nresearch in Latin American countries on the agenda set by central\ncountries. Due to their local interest, most of the material was\nwritten in Spanish. In 1971, a debate, remembered until today for its\nphilosophical and political significance, confronted Oscar Varsavsky\nand Gregorio Klimovsky in Argentina. For Varsavsky (1971), since\nscience is essentially ideology-laden, ideology must appear explicitly\nin scientific policy as a guide toward a new social order. Klimovsky\n(1971), by contrast, advocated for a neutral basic science: politics\nappear mostly in the application of scientific knowledge. The original\ndebate was complemented with the contribution of other prominent\nArgentine thinkers, and appeared in 1975 as the book Ciencia y\nIdeología. Aportes polémicos (Klimovsky et\nal. 1975). In the same year, Jorge Sabato compiled a significant book\nwith articles by more than twenty specialists about ideology in\nscience, relations between science, technology, and society, the\nstructural scientific-technological dependence of Latin America, the\nproduction of technology, and the planning of scientific-technological\ndevelopment in Latin American countries. The lively debates of those\nyears were drastically interrupted by the military coup\nd’état in Argentina in 1976.  The claim for a Latin American science, guided by regional\ninterests and ideological views, is in resonance with those\nphilosophical and sociological studies, like that of Enrique Dussel\n(1995) which denounces the Eurocentric “myth of modernity”\nthat justifies the superiority of European culture over Native\nAmerican cultures. In turn, the need to contextualize scientific\nknowledge in the framework of social needs of a particular community\nalso appears in the works of Rolando García (1981) under the\nconcept of interdisciplinary research, that is, a research that\ncombines different theoretical approaches in the search for solving\nlocalized social requirements.  Whereas the above contributions focused mainly on natural science,\nthe interest in how social knowledge is produced in Latin America has\ngrown during the last decades. An example of this interest is the book\nof Leandro Rodríguez Medina (2014) which examines the\ncirculation of knowledge within globalization, focusing on the\ndifferences between centers and peripheries of knowledge production in\nthe social sciences, and in the ways in which foreign ideas shape\nperipheral fields.  Two philosophers of science, who are well-known in the Latin\nAmerican communities, were also very interested in issues connected\nwith social and political values in science, although from different\nperspectives. Since the 1990s, León Olivé (1988 [1993])\nstood at the interface between the philosophy and the sociology of\nknowledge, trying to explain the double nature of knowledge as a\nsocial construct and a representation of reality. More recently, his\ninterest focused on how technology has pervaded contemporary society,\nmodeling both knowledge and values (Olivé 2007).  Ricardo\nGómez, by contrast, develops his position in open confrontation\nwith neoliberalism (2002, 2017a). On this basis, he considers that the\nethical dimension of science and technology should stand against\nneoliberal principles from a clear political position (Gómez\n2017b). \nThe interaction between scientific activities and values has been the\ninterest of Pablo Mariconda (Lacey and Mariconda 2014a, 2014b). In\nparticular, Mariconda (2014) discusses the technological risks\nassociated with transgenic agriculture. Along the same lines, Guillemo\nFolgera analyzes the techno-scientific discourse regarding genetically\nmodified organisms (Folguera, Carrizo, and Massarini 2014) and\ndenounces the omission of risks in the use of such organisms (Francese\nand Folguera 2018).  In the context of science, society, and values, studies that\ncombine the reflection upon scientific knowledge with gender matters\nmust be mentioned. For instance, Fabrizzio (now Siobhan) Guerrero Mc\nManus (2016) provides Spanish-speaking readers with an overview of a\nfeminism that seeks to develop a critical framework aimed at\ndetecting, exposing, and correcting the many gender biases nowadays\npresent in the sciences. In this context, the works of Diana\nMaffía cannot be forgotten since she has critically analyzed\nthe links between gender and science in the past twenty years or so\n(e.g., Maffía 2001, 2005, 2006, 2007; Rietti and Maffía\n2005). \nAlthough Mario Bunge and Roberto Torretti were central figures for the\nphilosophy of physics in Latin America, their early emigration\nprevented them from starting research lines around their works. As a\nconsequence, the development of the philosophy of physics in the\nregion is relatively recent.  Quantum mechanics is one of the focuses of the research group led\nby Olimpia Lombardi which developed its work in two directions: the\ninterpretation of the theory and the analysis of the meaning of\ndecoherence. Regarding the first topic, Lombardi and Mario Castagnino\nproposed the modal-Hamiltonian interpretation of quantum mechanics: a\nrealist, non-collapse interpretation that endows the Hamiltonian with\na determining role. The interpretation proved to be effective in\nexplaining ideal and non-ideal measurements and many other well-known\nphysical situations such as hydrogen atom, Zeeman effect, fine\nstructure, etc. (Lombardi and Castagnino 2008). The interpretation was\nreformulated in a Galilean invariant form (Ardenghi, Castagnino, and\nLombardi 2009; Lombardi, Castagnino, and Ardenghi 2010), and was\napplied to further situations, such as the non-collapse account of\nconsecutive measurements in physics (Ardenghi, Lombardi, and Narvaja\n2013), the understanding of quantum decoherence (Lombardi, Ardenghi,\nFortin, and Castagnino 2011), the view of quantum measurement in\ninformational terms (Lombardi, Fortin, and López 2015), and the\nproblem of optical isomerism in chemistry (Fortin, Lombardi, and\nMartínez González 2016, 2018). In addition, the\nmodal-Hamiltonian interpretation proposes a bundle-of-properties\nontology that adequately accounts for contextuality and\nindistinguishability (da Costa, Lombardi, and Lastiri 2013; da Costa\nand Lombardi 2014), but without preventing the emergence of particles\nunder certain particular circumstances (Lombardi and Dieks 2016).  By stressing the distinction between collapse and decoherence,\nOsvaldo Pessoa (1997) criticized the assumption that decoherence\nsolves the measurement problem. Following Pessoa’s view,\nCastagnino, Sebastian Fortin, and Lombardi (2010) deepened the\ncriticisms of the orthodox approach to decoherence (see also Lombardi,\nFortin, and Castagnino 2012; Fortin and Lombardi 2014, 2017), proposed\na new approach for closed systems (Castagnino and Lombardi 2004;\nFortin and Lombardi 2018), and developed a general conceptual\nframework for decoherence in closed and open systems (Castagnino,\nLaura, and Lombardi 2007). On the basis of this new perspective, the\nresearch group offered a particular view of the classical limit of\nquantum mechanics (Castagnino and Lombardi 2005; Fortin and Lombardi\n2016) and applied it to the problem of defining the quantum ergodic\nhierarchy (Castagnino and Lombardi 2007; Gómez and Castagnino\n2014). \nIn the subtle frontier between logic and physics, Décio Krause\ndeveloped an impressive work related to the quantum challenges to\nthe notions of identity and individuality. Already in his PhD\ndissertation, under the supervision of Newton da Costa, Krause\nsupplied a semantics to the so-called “Schrödinger\nlogic” (da Costa and Krause 1994, 1997) designed to account for\nelementary quantum particles. This work led him to formulate his\nquasi-set theory (Krause 1991, 1992, 1996a, 1996b), according\nto which there are urelements for which identity makes no sense.\nKrause’s semi-extensional quasi-set theory was compared with the\nintensional quaset theory developed by Maria Luisa dalla Chiara and\nGiuliano Toraldo di Francia (dalla Chiara, Giuntini, and Krause 1998),\nand was applied to particular problems in the foundations of quantum\nmechanics (Sant’Anna and Krause 1997; Krause, Sant’Anna,\nand Volkov 1999; Krause 2000; Domenech, Holik, and Krause 2008). \nKrause also developed an intense collaboration with Steven French to\ndevelop a concept of individuality for the quantum ontology (Krause\nand French 1995, 2007; French and Krause 1995, 1999, 2003); they also\nadvanced some ideas about individuality in quantum field theory\n(French and Krause 2010). This collaboration gave rise to a very\nrelevant book on the matter (French and Krause 2006), which discusses\nthe problem of individuality in philosophy and in classical and\nquantum physics and articulates quasi-set theory as a theory for\nnon-individuals.  More recently, Krause produced a relevant collaborative work with\nJonas Arenhart, his former PhD student, about quantum\nnon-individuality (Krause and Arenhart 2012, 2016a) and its\ncompatibility with Einstein’s realism (Krause and Arenhart\n2014). They also examined the view of quantum particles as individuals\nin a primitive sense (Arenhart and Krause 2014a, 2014b). This\ncollaboration led to a recent book about the logical foundations of\nscientific theories (Krause and Arenhart 2016b). In recent years,\nKrause also worked with da Costa in the application of paraconsistent\nlogics to physics (da Costa and Krause 2014, 2016).  Still in the field of the interpretation of quantum mechanics,\nElías Okon and Daniel Sudarsky (2014a, 2014b) criticized Robert\nGriffiths’s consistent histories approach by arguing that it is\ninterpretively vague and does not solve the measurement problem. These\nworks were rebutted by Griffiths (2015), and the rebuttal was\nimmediately answered by Okon and Sudarsky (2015a) by claiming that the\nconsistent histories interpretation introduces anthropomorphic terms\nnot contained in the formalism. In turn, based on Okon and\nSudarsky’s criticism, Marcelo Losada and Lombardi (2018) defend\na “formalism of contextual histories” which is free from\nthe shortcomings of Griffiths’s proposal. \nGiven the need for an observer-independent interpretation of quantum\nmechanics for cosmology, Okon and Sudarsky (2014c) defended an\nobjective collapse theory for the application to cosmology and quantum\ngravity, and on this basis, they proposed an adaptation of objective\ncollapse models to a general relativistic context (2018a). The authors\nalso examined the black hole information loss paradox as a situation\nthat can be accounted for by collapse interpretations (Okon and\nSudarsky 2015b, 2017, 2018b).  Other aspects and interpretations of quantum mechanics have also\nbeen explored. For instance, Sergio Martínez explored the\nphysical content of the Luders Rule (1990, 1991), Pessoa (2005)\nproposed a modal logical treatment of quantum mechanics, and Pablo\nAcuña (2016b) pointed out the difficulties in defining the\nnotion of inertial trajectory in Bohmian mechanics which is considered\na different theory and not a different interpretation of quantum\nmechanics (Acuña forthcoming). In turn, Rodolfo Gambini, Luis\nPedro García-Pintos, and Jorge Pullin (2010, 2011) devised an\ninterpretation that offers a solution to the quantum measurement\nproblem based on the loss of coherence due to the use of realistic\nclocks. \nMatters not directly related to quantum mechanics have also been\nstudied by Latin American philosophers of physics. For instance,\nAcuña (2016a) critically assessed the debate concerning the\ndirection of explanation between Minkowski spacetime and the Lorentz\ninvariance of dynamical laws. Diego Romero-Maltrana (2015) analyzes\nthe relationship between symmetries and conserved quantities supported\nby Noether’s theorems in order to argue for the priority of\nconserved quantities over symmetries.  The problem of time’s arrow was addressed by Castagnino,\nLombardi and collaborators by elaborating on John Earman’s\nheresy (1974) according to which the arrow of time is a geometrical\nproperty of the universe (Castagnino, Lombardi, and Lara 2003). This\nglobal arrow is transferred to the local domain as an energy flow that\npoints to the same time direction on the entire spacetime (Castagnino\nand Lombardi 2009), which in turn supplies the foundations for local\nirreversible theories (Aiello, Castagnino, and Lombardi 2008).\nCastagnino and Lombardi also collaborated with Manuel Gadella, one of\nthe authors of the time-asymmetric quantum mechanics, in order to\nanalyze irreversibility and time’s arrow in the quantum realm\n(Castagnino, Gadella, and Lombardi 2006), a work recently followed by\nCristian López (2019). \nAlthough the philosophy of chemistry is a relatively young\nsubdiscipline in philosophy of science,it has attracted the interest\nof several researchers in Latin America. \nThe group led by Olimpia Lombardi worked on the topic since 2005 when\na paper advocating for the ontological autonomy of chemistry (Lombardi\nand Labarca 2005) was published. The paper sparked a hot debate which\nbegan with a criticism by Paul Needham (2006) that was immediately\nresponded by Lombardi and Labarca (2006), and was followed by many\nother authors. In the meantime, Labarca and Lombardi (2010) also argued for\nthe existence of orbitals in the ontology of chemistry relying on\nontological pluralism. On the basis of the impact of her view,\nLombardi (2014a) reviewed and organized the different criticisms and\noffered a systematic response to them; in turn, with Mariana\nCórdoba, she stressed the Kantian roots of her ontological\npluralism (Córdoba and Lombardi 2013). \nGiven her antireductionist perspective, Lombardi (2013, 2014b) also\ncriticized the book of Hinne Hettema (2012), Reducing Chemistry to\nPhysics, stressing the many difficulties that must be faced by\nthose who insist on the reduction of chemistry to physics; the papers\nreceived immediate replies from Hetterma (2014).  The problems regarding the relations between chemistry and physics\nwere addressed by Lombardi’s group from various perspectives. In\nparticular, they brought to light several interpretive issues of\nquantum mechanics that are not accommodated when the theory is used in\nchemistry (Lombardi and Castagnino 2010; Martínez\nGonzález, Fortin, and Lombardi 2019) and argued that quantum\ndecoherence does not solve the problem of isomerism (Fortin, Lombardi,\nand Martínez González 2016). They also began to examine\nthe issue of the relationship between chemistry and quantum mechanics\nfrom a theoretical perspective, such as the Quantum Theory of Atoms in\nMolecules (Jaimes Arriaga, Fortin, and Lombardi 2019) and Bohmian\nmechanics (Fortin, Lombardi, and Martínez González\n2017); this last paper was critically assessed by Giovanni Villani,\nElena Ghibaudi, and Luigi Cerruti (2018).  As a continuation of her previous work in Spanish, Lombardi (2012)\noffered a critical analysis of Ilya Prigogine’s proposals. In\nturn, with Lucía Lewowicz, she analyzed the ontological\ncategory of stuff as required by macro-chemistry (Lewowicz and\nLombardi 2013). The problem of the categories underlying the chemical\ndiscourse was also addressed in the context of the group by\nCórdoba and Alfio Zambon (2017) for the particular case of\nnano-materials. A particular mention is needed to Zambon’s\n(2018) completely new representation of the periodic system based on\natomic-number triads. \nGuillermo Restrepo focused his interest on how formal tools can be\napplied to chemistry. With José Luis Villaveces, he noted the\nresemblance between Leibniz’s and Lavoisier’s programs\nregarding a lingua philosophica for understanding nature\n(Restrepo and Villaveces 2011) and reviewed the origins of\nmathematical thinking in chemistry (Restrepo and Villaveces 2012).\nRestrepo also analyzed the mathematical aspects of the periodic law\n(Restrepo and Pachón 2007) and considered the different\nfoundational aspects of the field called “mathematical\nchemistry” (2013; Restrepo and Villaveces 2013). Restrepo has\nbeen working in Germany since 2014 where he still produces interesting\ncontributions to the philosophy of chemistry.  The development of the technological aspects of chemistry has been\nthe interest of José Antonio Chamizo (2013, 2017, 2019) with\napplications to chemistry education. \nThe philosophy of biology in the region has been developed in various\ndirections from the most traditional topics in the area to more\ninnovative questions. \nThe traditional topic of natural selection is treated in relation to\nits explanatory power by Pablo Lorenzano in collaboration with the\nSpanish philosopher José Díez (Díez and Lorenzano\n2013, 2015). Santiago Ginnobili (2016) offers a metatheoretical\nstructuralist reconstruction of Darwin’s theory with the purpose\nof elucidating the concept of ecological fitness, and Mario Casanueva\n(2011) proposes a structuralist reconstruction of the mechanism of\nnatural selection by means of graph resources. In turn, Gustavo Caponi\n(2013) studies the concepts of function, fitness, and adaptation in\nnatural selection theory.  Closely related with natural selection, the issue of evolution is\napproached from very different perspectives. For instance, Guillemo\nFolguera stresses the dependence of macroevolution on microevolution\neven in the criticisms of the synthesis since the seventies (Folguera\nand Lombardi 2012), and Maurizio Esposito (2011) supplies examples of\nhow Darwinism was used and adapted in different contexts. But the most\nextensive work on this issue has been developed by Edna\nSuárez-Díaz who focused specifically on molecular\nevolution. In this field, she studied the role played by the concept\nof informational molecule and by the idea of molecular evolution of\ninformational molecules in differentiating molecular from classical\nevolutionists and in the constitution of genomics\n(Suárez-Díaz 2009, 2010). Despite stressing the\nimportance of the molecular experimental approach in evolutionary\nbiology (Suárez-Díaz and Barahona 1996),\nSuárez-Díaz acknowledges the methodological and\nconceptual difficulties embedded in the use of molecular evidence to\nelaborate molecular phylogenies (Suárez-Díaz and\nAnaya-Muñoz 2008; Suárez-Díaz 2014a), and\nemphasizes the generative nature of experimentation\n(Suárez-Díaz 2013).  Heredity, always linked with biological knowledge, has been the\ntopic of interest of Carlos López-Beltrán who shows the\ntransformation of the concept from playing a metaphorical role to\nacquire a narrative role (1994) and subsequently being conceived in\nstatistical terms (2006). By relating heredity with genetics, Esposito\n(2017) emphasizes the longstanding relationships between the\nreductionist view of gene as hereditary unit, the idea of information\nencoded in DNA, and the prophecies about the power of controlling\ngenetic information. From a structuralist perspective, Lorenzano\noffers a metatheoretical reconstruction of classical genetics (Balzer\nand Lorenzano 2000), paying special attention to the Hardy-Weinberg\nlaw within population genetics (2014).  Mario Casanueva (1997)\nexplores the relationship among the sexual theory of reproduction,\nMendelian genetics, and Mendel’s hybridisation theory. In turn,\nJuan Manuel Torres (1997, 2002, 2006) focuses on the use of genetic\ntests in medical practice, and Anna Barahona (2007) considers how\ndifferent inheritance issues can be represented by genetic maps.  Fabrizzio (now Siobhan) Guerrero Mc Manus examines methodological\nproblems: the rational selection of an algorithm for phylogenetic\ninference (2009), and the limitations of mechanistic explanations when\ndealing with developmental mechanisms (2012). In turn, the issue of\ncausation is treated by Maximiliano Martínez in terms of the\nconcept of multi-level causation (Martínez and Moya 2011;\nMartínez and Esposito 2014). The ideas of a multiplicity of\nlevels and of downward causation appears repeatedly in the works of\nCharbel El-Hani (El-Hani and Pereira 1999; El-Hani and Emmeche 2000;\nQueiroz and El-Hani 2006), with the purpose of advocating for property\nand process emergence in biology.  In collaboration with El-Hani, João Queiroz has developed\nextensive work on the biosemiotic approach to biology (El-Hani,\nQueiroz, and Stjernfelt 2010; Queiroz, Emmeche, Kull, and El-Hani\n2011; Queiroz 2012; Queiroz, Stjernfelt, and El-Hani 2014), and its\nrelationship with genetic information (El-Hani, Queiroz, and Emmeche\n2006). From a completely different viewpoint,\nSuárez-Díaz (2007) discusses what she considers the\nmetaphor of information in molecular biology. \nOther non-classical but currently very relevant topics in life\nsciences are also treated in the region, such as environmental matters\n(Klier et al. 2017), ecology (Nunes-Neto, Moreno, and El-Hani 2014),\nand evo-devo (Baedke and Mc Manus 2018).  Finally, it is worth mentioning a recent trend that, in the\nconfluence among philosophy, anthropology, and biology, considers\npolitical issues in biological research (Wade et al. 2015;\nGarcía-Deister and López-Beltrán 2015; Delgado\n2018), studies genomic variations in Latin America\n(Suárez-Díaz 2014b; Anaya-Muñoz,\nGarcía-Deister, and Suárez-Díaz 2017), examines\nthe relationship among genetic research, nationalism, and the\nconstruction of collective social identities (Kent et al. 2015), and\nexplores the relationships among homosexuality, homophobia, and\nbiomedical sciences in the region (Mc Manus 2014). \nSometimes very close to logic itself, the philosophy of logic has an\nimportant presence in Latin American philosophy of science from\nmultiple perspectives. \nThe logical treatment of contradiction attracted great interest,\nmainly in the groups of Campinas and Buenos Aires, although with\ndifferent motivations. In Campinas, where one underlying interest was\nthe possibility of modeling contradictory information in scientific\npractice, Newton da Costa focused on the mathematical concept of\n“pragmatic truth” (Mikenberg, da Costa, and Chuaqui 1986)\nwith the purpose of showing that the logic of pragmatic truth is\nparaconsistent (da Costa, Bueno, and French 1998). In turn, Walter\nCarnielli and Marcelo Coniglio developed an approach in which the\ndistinction between logic and philosophy is not straightforward. On\nthe philosophical side, and following the path opened by da Costa,\nthey focused on the so-called “logics of formal\ninconsistency”, a family of paraconsistent logics that can\nexpress the notion of consistency within the object language\n(Carnielli, Coniglio, and Marcos 2007). Carnielli also developed\ndialogical and epistemic approaches to paraconsistency (Rahman and\nCarnielli 2000; Carnielli and Rodrigues 2019).  In the group led by Eduardo Barrio at Buenos Aires, works on\ninconsistency were motivated by semantic reasons, in particular, the\ntreatment of paradoxes (Barrio 2010; Picollo 2012; Barrio and Picollo\n2013). They studied non-transitivity as a solution of paradoxes\n(Barrio, Rosenblatt, and Tajer 2015; Barrio, Pailos, and Szmuc 2018),\nand considered non-traditional approaches to paradoxes (Da Ré\nand Rosenblatt 2018). Some members of the group were also interested\nin classical recapture in the contexts of paraconsistent logic\n(Teijeiro forthcoming) and of logics of formal inconsistency (Tajer\nforthcoming). Recently, Barrio and collaborators have begun to focus\nspecifically on paraconsistency in its different aspects (Barrio,\nPailos, and Szmuc 2017, forthcoming a; Barrio and Da Ré 2018b;\nBarrio, Clerbout, and Rahman forthcoming). \nThe strong contact between the groups of Campinas and Buenos Aires\nresulted in the publication of two special issues of the Logic\nJournal of the IGPL (Barrio and Carnielli forthcoming a,b)\ndevoted to logics of formal inconsistency. The interest in paradoxes\nand inconsistency also appeared in other authors of the region, such\nas Andrés Bobenrieth (1998).  Topics related to non-extensionality, in particular modal logics\nand Kripkean semantics, were also treated by some philosophers of\nlogic in Latin America (e.g., Mortari 2007; Marcos 2009; Estrada\nGonzález 2012; Rosenblatt and Szmuc 2014). In particular, Max\nFreund (2001, 2004, 2007, 2015) focused on modal logics with sortal\nquantifiers and wrote a collaborative book on modal logic\n(Cocchiarella and Freund 2008).  The question of the coexistence of different logics was\nadditionally addressed by the groups in Buenos Aires and\nCampinas. Whereas Barrio and collaborators discussed logical pluralism\n(Barrio, Pailos, and Szmuc forthcoming b), Carnielli and Coniglio\nfocused on the problems of translations between logics (Carnielli,\nConiglio, and D’Ottaviano 2009) and combinations of logics\n(Carnielli and Coniglio 2007 [2016]).  More traditional problems related with truth have also been\ntreated by the philosophers of logic of the region (e.g., Barrio and\nRodríguez-Pereyra 2015; Barrio and Da Ré 2018a). In\nparticular, Mario Gómez-Torrente (1998, 2000, 2002, 2008, 2006\n[2019]) developed a longstanding work on the notion of logical truth,\ntruth-preservation, and the relationships among logical truth,\nderivability, and model-theoretic validity. \nAlthough in the boundaries between logic and epistemology, the logic\nof belief revision and the works of Carlos Alchourrón\n(Alchourrón and Makinson 1981, 1982; Alchourrón 1996)\ncannot be forgotten: the AGM model (Alchourrón,\nGärdenfors, and Makinson 1985) is still the dominant theory of\nbelief revision (see entry logic\nof belief revision in this Encyclopedia). Andrés\nPáez (2006) uses the theory of belief revision to supply a\nconcept of explanation embodied with pragmatic conditions. Closely\nrelated with this topic, “defeasible reasoning” was\nextensively studied by Gustavo Bodanza and Fernando Tohmé\n(2005, 2009; Bodanza, Tohmé, and Simari 2016; Bodanza,\nTohmé, and Auday 2017; see also Bodanza 2002; Bodanza and\nAlessio 2017). Tohmé also supplied a category-theoretic\nrepresentation of abduction (Tohmé, Caterina, and Gangle 2015),\nand analyzed abduction in its application to economy (Crespo,\nTohmé, and Heymann 2010; Tohmé and Crespo\n2013). Abductive reasoning was also the main interest of Atocha\nAliseda (2003; Soler-Toscano, Nepomuceno-Fernández, and\nAliseda-Llera 2009), who applied abduction to medical diagnosis\n(Aliseda and Leonides 2013) and proposed a conditional logic to\nformalize abduction (Beirlaen and Aliseda 2014). She also published a\nbook completely devoted to abduction (Aliseda 2006), which not only\ndiscusses conceptual and formal matters, but also pays special\nattention to the epistemic applications of abductive reasoning. \nThe philosophy of cognitive sciences is a very complex field, mainly\ndue to the difficulty to distinguish it from other areas such as\nphilosophy of mind, epistemology, linguistics, philosophy of action,\nand logic.  The traditional topic of consciousness has been treated in its\nrelation to brain functions from a naturalized perspective by\nJosé Luis Díaz (1995, 2000) and more recently by Miguel\nAngel Sebastián (2014) on the basis of the neurophysiology of\ndreams; in turn, Beatriz Sorrentino Marques and Osvaldo Pessoa (2017)\nanalyze the role of consciousness in agent causation theories.\nAnother traditional topic, perception, is addressed by Juan Carlos\nGonzález who analyzes the process of perceptual recalibration\n(González, Bach-y-Rita, and Haase 2005) and the case of\nhallucinations (González 2010, 2016), and by Laura Danón\nand Daniel Kalpokas (2017) who offer an explanation of the direct\nperception of mental states of others. Juan Pablo Bermúdez, in\nturn, focuses on mental actions, supplying an account of skillful\naction that rejects both intellectualism and anti-intellectualism\n(2017) and claiming that remembering is not merely passive but must be\nviewed as a mental action (Arango-Muñoz and Bermúdez\n2018). In collaboration with Bermúdez, Alejandro Rosas stresses\nthe cognitive and non-cognitive roots of shared intentionality (Rosas\nand Bermúdez 2018) and the influence of cognitive dispositions\non weakness of will attribution (Rosas, Bermúdez, and\nGutiérrez 2018). \nIn addition to his collaborative work with Bermúdez, Rosas\ndeveloped an extensive work on the evolution of moral cognition and\nthe cognitive roots of cooperation (2002, 2008a). In particular, he\nclaims that altruism is selected both at the individual and at the\ngroup levels (2008b) and proposes a unified theory of human\ncooperation based on reciprocity (2010, 2012). Recently, with\ncolleagues coming from philosophy and from science, he has contributed\nto the research on moral judgment with moral dilemmas (Rosas and\nKoenigs 2014; Rosas, Viciana, Caviedes, and Arciniegas 2019).  An approach that received much attention in the region is that of\nembodied cognition and, in particular, enactivism (see González\n2013; Hutto and Satne 2017; Martínez, Español, and\nPérez 2018).  For instance, Ignacio Avila analyzes bodily\nawareness and its role in perceptual self-location (2014, 2017) and\nconsiders certain enactive accounts of perception (2015). Adrian\nCussins (2012) discusses the role that representation of the body\nplays in cognition. In turn, Maria Eunice Quilici González asks\nwhether embodied cognition can be applied to artificial systems as\nrobots (Haselager and González 2007a). \nAxel Barceló Aspeitia and Angeles Eraña focused their\nwork mainly on the modularity of mind in order to adapt the idea of\ndomain specificity (Barceló, Eraña, and Stainton 2010)\nand to compare the hypothesis of massive modularity to other views\nabout the structure of mind (Eraña 2012). In this context,\nClaudia Lorena García (2007) argues that the hypothesis of the\nmodularity of mind needs to be understood in terms of the evolutionary\nbiological concepts of variational independence (2007) and of\nfunctional homology and functional variation (2010).  Metacognition is the topic that attracted the interest of Santiago\nArango-Muñoz who distinguishes between the rationalizing level\nand the controlling level in metacognition (2011) and appeals to the\nconcepts of metamemory and metacognitive feelings to address the\ninteractions between the mind and the world (2013). Furthermore, he\nexplores the nature of the so-called “epistemic feelings”\nfrom a metacognitive perspective (2014, 2019).  Cognitive functions are approached from an informational\nperspective by M.E.Q. González, who analyzes mechanical models\nof intelligence (2005) and of reasoning (González, Broens, and\nD’Ottaviano 2007; Haselager and González 2007b). From the\nsame informational approach, Sebastián and Artiga (forthcoming)\nexplore metarepresentation. Other formal perspectives are adopted to\nverify the so-called cognitive task analysis (Laureano-Cruces and\nBarceló-Aspeitia 2002) and to analyze the agent’s\nresolution of conditional probability problems (Moro, Bodanza, and\nFreidin 2011). \nFrom a completely different viewpoint, several authors in the region\nprefer to understand cognitive phenomena in an analytical framework,\nspecifically in relation to language (e.g., Skidelsky 2013;\nGarcía-Ramírez 2011; García-Ramírez and\nShatz 2011) with affinity with research in philosophy of mind.  Certain methodological problems of social sciences have been\naddressed by Diego Ríos, who analyzed explanation with\nmechanistic and evolutionary models (2004; Kuchle and Ríos\n2015), and studied the relationship between methodological\nindividualism and methodological holism (Ríos 2005, 2009;\nRíos Pozzi 2007). In particular, the autonomy and\nirreducibility of economics has been discussed (Scarano 2012;\nGómez 2012). Nevertheless, almost all of the philosophy of\nsocial sciences in Latin America has been directed to theoretical\nissues in specific sciences or particular problems of the region.  A field that attracts great interest is the philosophy of history.\nElías Palti recalls the evolution and crisis of the area\n(2018), and distinguishes the so-called “politico-intellectual\nhistory” from the old “history of political ideas”\n(2010, 2014). Veronica Tozzi (2012a, 2016, 2018), in turn, proposes an\noriginal pragmatist approach to the philosophy of history, which\nappeals to Dewey’s notion of “practical meaning” in\nrelation to the knowledge of the past. Tozzi also focuses on the\nproblem of the roles memory and testimony play in representing the\nrecent past (2009, 2012b). In connection to these concepts, Esteban\nLythgoe (2011, 2014) analyzes how Paul Ricoeur articulates history,\nmemory, and testimony.  Other topics involved in the philosophy of history have also been\nconsidered: the historicity of the concept of subject (Palti 2004),\nthe ideas of progress (Ratto 2018), and of future (Belvedresi\n2018). In particular, María Inés Mudrovcic highlights\nthe different types of consciousness of temporality (2014) and\nanalyzes the political self-understanding of the present in terms of\nthe past in contemporary Western societies (2013). The impact of the\nphenomenon of globalization on historiographical paradigms (Brauer\n2018) and on the deformation of ethical and political concepts\n(Roldán 2018) are also examined. In turn, the idea of Global\nHistory is considered by Rosa Belvedresi (2012) who compares it with\nthe concept of universal history, and by Francisco Naishtat (2012) as\na framework for the Marxist debate on colonialism and\nmodernization. \nAt the crossroads between philosophy of politics and political\nphilosophy—if there is any difference between them—the\ncategories of equality and liberty (Hilb 1994), authority\n(Oyarzún 2012), and power (Oyarzún 2017) have been\nanalyzed. In this field, Naishtat has developed extensive research\nmainly directed to the critical evaluation of phenomena at the global\nscale. For instance, he analyzes the relationship between fragile\nsovereignties, global-intensive governance apparatuses, and a\nhorizon-less catastrophe-world (2010a), and argues that the political\ndimension of the global is global justice (2011). In turn, Naishtat\nstands in the context of recent political events, when he considers\nthe possibility of peace and rights transcending state frontiers in\nthe light of the 1990s Balkan wars (2000) and the\ndisplacement of the content of the terms “terror” and\n“terrorism” after 9/11 towards a meaning functional to\nglobalization (2010b).  Latin American themes are recurrent in the philosophy of social\nsciences of the region. Palti has been very active in this field: he\nstudied the nineteenth century Latin American intellectual history in\nthe context of the thesis of the essential contestability of concepts\n(2005), considered the limitations of the notion of “misplaced\nideas” by means of which Roberto Schwarz analyzed the dynamics\nof ideas in Latin America (2006), and critically examined the radical\ntransformation in the ways of conceiving the process leading to the\nbreak of colonial ties that linked Latin America with Spain\n(2009). Other authors share this interest in regional problems, such\nas Pablo Oyarzún (2007) who focused on Latin American\nsingularities, Gustavo Leyva (2014) who considered how the democratic\nproject was reformulated and radicalized in Latin America over the\nlast decades, and Ambrosio Velasco Gómez (2015) who proposes an\noriginal thesis about the intellectual roots of Mexican\nindependence. \nWhen Latin American themes are considered, the so-called Philosophy of\nLiberation cannot be forgotten: a philosophical movement that emerged\nin the late sixties in Argentina and spread through Latin America in\nthe following decades with authors such as Enrique Dussel, Leopoldo\nZea, Arturo Roig, Francisco Miró Quesada, Arturo Roig, and\nCarlos Cullen among many others. Nevertheless, here the topic will not\nbe treated because a complete entry of the Encyclopedia is devoted to\nit (Eduardo Mendieta,\n philosophy of liberation). \nThe philosophy of technology has attracted significant interest from\nLatin American researchers working from very different perspectives\nwhether ontological-epistemological or ethical-political. From a\ngeneral viewpoint, Ricardo Gómez (2010) offers a detailed\noverview of the philosophical ideas about technology.  Regarding the ontological status of technical artifacts and\nactions, Diego Lawler critically analyzes the functional and\nintentional theories about the nature of artifact kinks (Vega and\nLawler 2014) and proposes a praxeological approach to technological\npractices (Lawler 2018). In turn, Andrés Vaccari directs\ncriticisms to the functionalist assumptions underlying the dual nature\nof technical artifacts program (2013) and the extended cognition\ntheory applied to artifacts (2017), claiming that transhumanism has\nfailed in its aim to ground the transformation of the human condition\non technology (2015). The ontological status of artificial agents and\nartificial life was addressed by Mari González and Osvaldo\nPessoa (2008), who face the problem of whether life and autonomy could\nin principle be sustained with components other than carbon, and by\nDiego Parente (2018) who considers the challenges that these cases\npose to the traditional dichotomy between natural/artificial. Pablo\nRodríguez and Javier Blanco (2017), in turn, confront Gilbert\nSimondon’s theory of individuation with ideas coming from\ncybernetics. From an epistemological perspective Myriam Altamirano\nBustamante, Adalberto de Hoyos, and León Olivé (2011)\nargue that much of the tacit knowledge involved in technology can be\ntransmitted as explicit knowledge through patents. \nThe ethical and socio-political dimensions of technology are topics\nthat have received great attention in the region. For instance, Jorge\nLinares Salgado (2018) analyzes the ethical and societal consequences\nof the production of bio-artifacts derived from synthetic biology. A\nmore specific study is offered by Carlos Osorio Marulanda (2018), who\naddresses the problems related with drinking water production,\nespecially in rural areas of Latin America, from the perspective of\nscience, technology, and society (STS) studies. \nIn the area of STS studies, the extensive work of Hebe Vessuri\noccupies a relevant place. In the boundaries between sociology and\nphilosophy, Vessuri has addressed general problems from a regional\npoint of view. For example, she considers how the current admission of\nthe underlying ontological complexity of the world influences both the\nsocio-cognitive and the institutional organization of disciplinary\nknowledge, particularly in developing countries (2000) and how\nscience and technology can respond to the particular needs of Latin\nAmerican societies (2003). Vessuri also discusses the world\ndistribution of scientists, engineers, and technologists and the\nmovement of these personnel from peripheral countries to central\ncountries (de la Vega and Vessuri 2008). The readers interested in STS\nstudies in Latin America can turn to the article “Latin American\nscience, technology, and society. A historical and reflexive\napproach” (Kreimer and Vessuri 2018), which describes the\ndevelopment of STS in the region, its institutionalization and its\nspaces of interaction. \nFinally, two books in Spanish by León Olivé must be\nrecalled due to their impact in the Latin American community of\nphilosophers of science: whereas in the first (Olivé 2000)\nscience and technology are considered on a par, the second book\n(Olivé 2007) deals specifically with the different facets of\ntechnology. \nOther topics, not easily included in the traditional philosophies of\nparticular sciences, have also been addressed in Latin America.  What is now known as philosophy of information has been an\ninterest of Olimpia Lombardi and her research group from different\nperspectives. The meaning of the term “information” is\nelucidated from a general viewpoint (Lombardi 2004), paying particular\nattention to Shannon information (Lombardi 2005; Lombardi, Holik, and\nVanni 2016a), and arguing for a pluralistic interpretation of the\nconcept (Lombardi, Fortin, and Vanni 2015). By adopting a critical\nperspective regarding Christopher Timpson’s deflationary view of\ninformation (Lombardi, Fortin, and López 2016), it is argued\nthat there is no qualitative difference between Shannon and quantum\ninformation besides the difference in the way in which they are\nencoded (Lombardi, Holik, and Vanni 2016b). In turn, an\ninterpretational account of quantum measurement is offered (Lombardi,\nFortin, and López 2015). On the basis of this critical work,\nLombardi and Cristian López (2018) have elucidated the concept\nof information as used in Giulio Tononi’s Integrated Information\nTheory of consciousness, and have proposed a manipulation-based\ninterpretation of communicational information (López and\nLombardi 2019).  The philosophy of science as a resource for science education is a\ntopic that has acquired an increasing interest in Latin America during\nthe last decades. In this field, two authors have developed intensive\nwork. Agustín Adúriz-Bravo addressed the use of\nwell-known episodes from the history of science, such as the\nformulation of the pendulum law by Galileo (2004) and the discovery of\nradium by the Curies (Adúriz-Bravo and Izquierdo-Aymerich 2009)\nfor science education. Moreover, he applied the cognitive model of\nscience (Izquierdo-Aymerich and Adúriz-Bravo 2003;\nAdúriz-Bravo and Izquierdo-Aymerich 2005) and the semantic view\nof scientific theories (Adúriz-Bravo 2011, 2013) both to the\npractice of science teaching and to research on science education. He\nalso appealed to the so called “Nature of Science” view of\nscience for the education of science teachers (Adúriz-Bravo\n2007, 2014). On the basis of those theoretical bases,\nAdúriz-Bravo focuses on the philosophy of chemistry as a\nresource for the didactics of chemistry (Erduran, Adúriz-Bravo,\nand Mamlok Naaman 2007; Izquierdo-Aymerich and Adúriz-Bravo\n2009; Adúriz-Bravo, Merino, and Izquierdo-Aymerich 2012).  The interest of Charbel El-Hani is mainly centered on the\nphilosophy of biology for didactics of biology. He advocates for a\ntheory-centered approach to the concept of life (2008) and considers\nthe advantages of the dialogue between the students’\nethnobiological knowledge and biology school knowledge (Baptista and\nEl-Hani 2009). He also appeals to the works of Mendel and Darwin for\nteaching genetics and evolution (Bizzo and El-Hani 2009; El-Hani\n2015) and analyzes the different concepts of gene that often overlap\nin biology education (Dos Santos, Joaquim, and El-Hani 2012; Meyer,\nBomfim, and El-Hani 2013, Gericke, Hagberg, dos Santos, Joaquim, and\nEl-Hani 2014). Beyond the specific field of biology, El-Hani accounts\nfor the different ways in which individuals and societies represent\nconcepts (Aguiar Jr, Sevian, and El-Hani 2018), discusses how to deal\nwith the relations between different cultural perspectives in\nclassrooms (Moreira-dos-Santos and El-Hani 2017), and advocates for\nunderstanding as one of the major goals of science education\n(Ferreira, El-Hani, and da Silva Filho 2016). \nAfter reviewing the development of philosophy of science in Latin\nAmerica since its emergence in the mid-twentieth century, it can be\nsaid that there are some distinctive features in different countries.\nBut in the last decades, especially given the widespread use of the\nInternet and digital libraries by the mid-1990s, a growing\nintercommunication and collaboration can be verified as well as the\ntendency to form an academic community with an important international\npresence, which, at the same time, has certain characteristics of its\nown. Among the common features, the following deserve to be\nmentioned. \nFinally, it is worth stressing that the area strongly progressed in\nspite of the many obstacles that philosophical research faces in the\nregion; the erratic political situation and the cyclic economic crisis\nin Latin American countries influence research policies, and this\nplaces scholars in unstable and uncertain positions.  Nevertheless,\nregardless of the difficulties, at present a new generation of young\nphilosophers of science allows us to foresee that the philosophy of\nscience produced in Latin America will continue to grow in quantity\nand quality, increasing its already considerable international\npresence.","contact.mail":"perezransanz@yahoo.com","contact.domain":"yahoo.com"}]
