These dialogues are important in exhibiting Plato’s\nviews on method and metaphysics after he criticized his own most \nfamous contribution to the history of philosophy, the theory of \nseparate, immaterial forms in the Parmenides. The \nStatesman also offers a transitional statement of Plato’s \npolitical philosophy between the Republic and the \nLaws. The Sophist and Statesman show the \nauthor’s increasing interest in mundane and practical knowledge. In \nthis respect they seem more down-to-earth and Aristotelian in tone \nthan dialogues dated to Plato’s middle period such as the \nPhaedo and the Republic. This entry will focus on \nmethod and metaphysics.\n\n\n\nThe Sophist and Statesman represent themselves as\nthe first two members of a trilogy, which was to include a third\nmember, the Philosopher, a dialogue Plato never wrote. The\nconversations in the Sophist and Statesman take\nplace sequentially on a single day and are dramatically linked to the\nTheaetetus, which occurred on the previous day, shortly\nbefore Socrates’ trial and death (Theaetetus 210d,\nSophist 216a). The Theaetetus and Sophist\nare also linked more remotely to the Parmenides, a\nconversation Socrates says he had with the great philosopher of Elea,\nwhen Parmenides was old and he was very young (Theaetetus\n183e–184a, Sophist 217c). Socrates plays a minor role\nin the conversations in the Sophist and Statesman,\nobserving the proceedings but replaced as main speaker by a visitor\nfrom Elea, a follower of Parmenides, who converses with Theaetetus in\nthe Sophist and with a young man named Socrates (the Younger)\nin the Statesman. \n\nAlthough the Sophist and Statesman are dialogues, \nthe interaction between the Stranger and his two young interlocutors \nseems rather different from that between Socrates and his interlocutors\nin the Socratic dialogues, including the Theaetetus. In that\ndialogue Theaetetus distinguished himself as a highly promising \nstudent, who answered Socrates’ questions resourcefully. The \nrespondents in the Sophist and Statesman are \ndocile by comparison, readily accepting the Stranger’s arguments and \noccasionally asking him to explain, but rarely raising tough \nobjections or making good proposals of their own. Young Socrates in \nthe Statesman is particularly prone to misunderstandings and\nmistakes. Of all the respondents in Plato’s dialogues, the \ninterlocutors in the Sophist and Statesman most \nclosely resemble the respondent in the second part of the \nParmenides, a young man named Aristotle (not the famous \nphilosopher), who never objects when he should, and who gives his \nmost enthusiastic assents when Parmenides’ argument is most \nproblematic or obscure. \n\nThese dramatic features raise questions of philosophical importance. \nWhy does Plato connect the Sophist and Statesman \nwith the Theaetetus and Parmenides, dialogues \nwritten in all probability a good deal earlier? Why do the speakers \nkeep anticipating a third dialogue, the Philosopher \n(Sophist 216c–217b, 253c–254b; \nStatesman 257a–c, 258b), on a topic plainly dear to \nPlato’s heart, which he then never wrote? Why does Plato replace \nSocrates with the colorless visitor from Elea? Elsewhere Plato allows\nspeakers to give long speeches (e.g., Timaeus’ cosmogony \nin the Timaeus), so why does the visitor engage in question \nand answer, given that he does most of the talking and his respondents seem\nunprepossessing and are chosen precisely because they are young and \nso likely to cause least trouble (cf. Sophist 217d with \nParmenides 137b)? \n\nThe Sophist and Statesman strike many scholars as \nmore dogmatic than other Platonic dialogues. The Stranger sets out to\ndefine the sophist, the statesman, and the philosopher, claiming that\nthey are three distinct kinds (Sophist 217a–b); the two \nexisting dialogues appear to give successful definitions of their \ntarget kinds and to present and defend significant methodological and\nmetaphysical positions. The Sophist arguably solves the \nproblem of false statement, one of a family of problems that had \ndogged other Platonic dialogues, including the Theaetetus. \n\nPerhaps Plato replaces Socrates with the visitor from Elea because\nElea was the hometown of Parmenides, and in the Sophist Plato\nplans to criticize Parmenides’ dictum that we cannot speak or think of\nwhat-is-not (Sophist 237a). Perhaps, too, readers are meant\nto recall the Parmenides, a dialogue staged some fifty years\nearlier, in which Parmenides himself led the conversation. After\ncriticizing Plato’s middle period treatment of forms (inadequately\ndefended by a youthful Socrates), Parmenides announced that before\npositing forms Socrates should undertake rigorous philosophical\ntraining. In the second part of the dialogue, Parmenides then\ndemonstrated with a youthful respondent the sort of exercise he had in\nmind, focusing on another thesis for which he was famous, that there\nis only one thing (Parmenides 128a–b, 137b). By using a\nvisitor from Elea, Plato invites his audience to recall Parmenides’\nown positions and performance in that earlier dialogue. (For\ndiscussion of the dialogue form in these late works, cf. Frede 1996,\nRowe 1996, and C. Gill 1996). \n\nThe Sophist and Statesman each undertake a\nparticular task, the first to define a sophist, the second to define a\nstatesman. But they have a larger purpose. The Statesman\ngives many indications that the investigation of the statesman is\nbeing undertaken not primarily for its own sake but for the sake of a\ngreater project—our becoming better dialecticians\n(Statesman 285d, 286d–287a). \n\nThe Stranger makes this announcement, first reminding Young Socrates \nof a previous discussion about children learning their letters: \n\nNext the Stranger talks about examples, such as weaving, for which\nthere are perceptible likenesses, easy to understand, which an\ninstructor can point to when an inquirer has trouble grasping a verbal\naccount. But there are other things, described as greatest and most\nvaluable, that cannot be observed or imaged. It is for the sake of\nthose harder topics that the inquirers practice giving and receiving\nan account on simple examples, such as weaving, where they can fall\nback on perceptible instances. The Stranger says: \n\nWe first practice giving and receiving a verbal account on easy\nexamples like weaving, which can also be observed and imaged. Then we\npractice on difficult examples, such as the statesman. Here we must\ngive and receive a verbal account without relying on visual aids. But\nthe statesman is still part of the exercise. Our inquiry about him is\nitself undertaken to make us better dialecticians, able to deal with\nall such topics. If we can succeed with the statesman, we will have\nlearned a technique, or how to find a technique, that can be applied\nto other difficult cases, such as the philosopher. \n\nThe Statesman chiefly aims to demonstrate how to undertake \nall such inquiries. Its own inquiry stimulates the participants (and \nus readers) to recognize what mistakes to avoid and what paths are \nworth pursuing and why. But significantly, as one sees from comparing\nthe treatments of the sophist and statesman, different kinds of \nsubject matter demand different sorts of methods. So we cannot simply\nextend the methods of the Sophist and Statesman in \na mechanical way to the investigation of the philosopher and other \ngreat and difficult topics. These dialogues teach us how to go about \nphilosophical investigations. They do not offer a formula that can be\nsimply applied to further cases. \n\nIf the Sophist and Statesman are philosophical \nexercises, there may be a good reason why the final dialogue of the \ntrilogy, the Philosopher, is missing. Plato would spoil the \nlesson if he wrote it for us (cf. Dorter 1994, 236). If we have \nlearned how to investigate philosophical problems in the \nSophist and Statesman, Plato may be challenging his\naudience to search for the philosopher themselves, using the \ntechniques and recommendations these dialogues provide (M. L. Gill, 2012). \n\nThe Sophist and Statesman search for definitions, \nand both dialogues focus on the search. The Sophist speaks \noften of the hunt in which we are engaged and of the sophist as our \nquarry. In this hunt the sophist time and again eludes us, taking \ncover in the darkness of not-being, reappearing occasionally to \ndispute the very existence of the kind to which we wish to assign \nhim. How can we define the sophist at all, if we cannot get hold of \nhim or coherently characterize the kind to which he belongs? The \nStatesman repeatedly notices the road traveled—longer \nroads and shorter roads that will take us to our destination or lead \nus astray. The dialogue often reflects on better and worse methods of\nseeking the goal. The Sophist and the first part of the \nStatesman represent the search by means of an elaborate \ntree-like system of roads. The inquirers travel down these branching \nroads; at each fork they must choose which branch to take in the hope\nof finding their quarry, and that quarry alone, at the terminus. This\nmethod of discovery is called division, and in its most \nusual form it is the repeated dichotomy of a general kind into two\nsubordinate kinds. Inquirers use \ndivision to locate a target kind at the terminus of one branch of the\ndivision. A definition, when reached by this means, recounts the \nsteps of the journey. \n\nWhere does an investigation into a topic such as sophistry or\nstatesmanship begin? At the start of the search for the sophist, the\nEleatic visitor remarks that he and Theaetetus may share merely the\nname “sophist” in common but may mean quite different\nthings by the name. He aims to establish agreement about the kind to\nwhich they ascribe the name (Sophist 218b–c), and he\nwants to find a real definition—a definition that applies to all\nand only members of the kind, and one that explains why any\ninstance is an instance of that kind: the inquirers seek the\nessence of the target kind, the property or collection of\nproperties that make the kind what it is. \n\nAs a preliminary step in locating the essence of a kind, the \ninquirers must figure out what people understand by the name of that \nkind. This opening maneuver can occur in several ways: First, what \ndoes the name connote, and what associations does it conjure up? The \nword “sophist” is cognate with the word \nsophos, which means “wise \n man.”[1]\n That connection suggests that the sophist has some sort of wisdom \n(sophia) or expertise (technê) \n(Sophist 221c–d). This idea enables the inquirers to locate \nthe sophist’s ability and practice at the outset in the wide kind art\nor expertise (technê). The word \n“statesman” in Greek (politikos) is cognate with\nthe word “city” (polis), and so people associate\nthe statesman’s activity with affairs of a city (Statesman \n305e). In addition, the Stranger relates statesman and king (Statesman 258e) \nand relies on the Homeric epithet of Agamemnon as shepherd of the \npeople (cf. Miller 2004, 40–43). The image of a herdsman quietly \nguides the initial attempt to define the statesman, whom the Stranger\nidentifies in the opening division as herdsman of the human flock. \n\nSecond, what sorts of individuals does the name pick out, and what\nfeatures do those individuals share? Readers of the Socratic dialogues\nwill recall that when Socrates asks his “What is X?”\nquestion (e.g., “What is piety?” “What is\ncourage?” “What is knowledge?”), the respondent\nfrequently opens with some sort of list. Euthyphro, when asked what\npiety is, says: “I say that piety is doing what I’m doing right\nnow, prosecuting the wrongdoer, be it about murder or temple robbery\nor anything else, whether the wrongdoer is your father or your mother\nor anyone else” (Euthyphro 5d–e). Theaetetus,\nwhen asked what knowledge is, first replies: “I think the things\nsomeone might learn from Theodorus are knowledge—geometry and\nthe things you enumerated just now [arithmetic, astronomy,\nmusic]—and cobbling, too, and the arts (technai) of the\nother craftsmen; all of them together and each separately are simply\nknowledge” (Theaetetus 146c–d). Socrates\nregularly objects that the interlocutor has merely given him a list,\nwhereas he wants to know what all the items on the list have in common\nand what makes them all instances of one kind. Although he complains\nabout the list, it helps to orient the investigation, because\nreflection on the list equips the inquirers to see the common features\nshared by all the items enumerated. \n\nThe Phaedrus calls this technique collection, and it\nis used together with division (Phaedrus 265d–266b). A\ncollection can occur at the beginning of an investigation and at any\nstep of a division. By means of collection an inquirer brings together\na number of disparate things or kinds of things, often called by\ndifferent names, into one kind. The Statesman offers a good\nexample of a collection at the outset of its inquiry. The visitor\ngathers together several kinds of things, called by different names,\ninto one kind—the target kind to be defined: \n\nThe visitor remarks that although we call these people by different \nnames, they all have in common a power to maintain their rule by the \nstrength of their understanding with little use of their hands and \nbodies (Statesman 259c). This is a rough and ready description of the target \nkind the inquirers hope to find at the terminus of their \ndivision. This crude description enables them to pick out a wide kind\nto divide (knowledge, epistêmê), and to take a \nnumber of steps in the division. The Stranger first divides knowledge\ninto practical and theoretical and then seeks to locate the target kind at\nthe terminus stemming from theoretical knowledge. \n\nAt the beginning of the investigation into the sophist, the Stranger \nsays they need to practice their investigation on a paradigm \n(paradeigma), before they embark on the difficult and \ncontroversial topic before them. \n\nIn the Parmenides and elsewhere Plato speaks of separate, \nimmaterial forms as paradigms, and sensible \nparticulars as likenesses of them, which somehow fall short of the \noriginal. This notion of a paradigm recurs in the Sophist, in \nthe Stranger’s discussion of imitation (Sophist 235d–e), but\nthe Sophist and Statesman use another conception as\nwell. A paradigm involves a mundane example with a \nfeature—sometimes an essential feature—relevant to the \ndefinition of the more difficult kind under investigation. In the \nSophist, an angler, defined as a sort of hunter, guides the \ninitial search for the sophist, who is also identified as a sort of \nhunter. \n\nA paradigm is not merely an example (or paradigmatic example) of some\ngeneral kind, as angling is an example of hunting and more generally\nof expertise. The search for the definition of the example reveals a\nprocedure, which can be transferred to the harder case, independent of\ncontent. Different paradigms introduce different procedures. The\nangler introduces the method of dichotomous division, and the\ndefinition of the angler recounts the steps on one side of that\ndivision. Both the procedure and definitional structure are featured\nin the harder case. The Statesman’s main paradigm, weaving,\nis offered much later in the investigation, after an initial attempt\nto define the statesman by dichotomous division has led to an impasse.\nAgain, the example shares properties in common with the target\nkind—both the weaver and the statesman engage in the art of\nintertwining, among other things. The paradigm also introduces a\nprocedure that can be extended to the target. The Stranger calls the\nnew procedure division “by limbs” (Statesman\n287c). By means of such division he gradually marks off the kind to be\ndefined (weaver or statesman) from other sorts of experts related to\nit in various ways and operating in the same domain. Plato’s paradigms\nin the Sophist and Statesman typically reveal a\nproductive next move or series of moves in an investigation.  A\nparadigm indicates how to go on—how to take the opening steps in\nan investigation or how to get beyond an impasse. \n\nThe divisions in the Sophist and Statesman are \ndivisions of arts (angling, sophistry, weaving, statecraft), and only\nsecondarily of experts who possess those arts. The art makes \nthe expert the sort of expert he is. The initial attempts to define \nthe sophist and statesman, using the method of dichotomous division, \neach reveal a puzzle about the target kind, and that puzzle is then resolved in\nsome other way, or at least in conjunction with some other method. \nThe sophist is puzzling because his art turns up, not at a \nsingle terminus like angling, but at many different termini. \nReflection on this peculiarity enables the inquirers to recognize \nsomething they had previously missed—the essence of the \nsophist—which ties together the various previous appearances. \n\nThe paradigm of the angler demonstrates the method of dichotomous \ndivision and steers the first attempt to define the sophist. An \nangler has a humble profession, familiar to everyone \n(Sophist 218e): an angler hunts water creatures using a \nspecial sort of hook. The visitor arrives at his definition by first \nlocating the angler’s profession in a wide kind, art or expertise \n(technê). He divides art into two subordinate kinds, \nproductive and acquisitive, then continues to divide the acquisitive \nbranch until he reaches the terminus, where he finds angling marked \noff as what it is, apart from everything else. The sophist resembles \nthe angler in possessing expertise, but more intimately as well. He, \ntoo, is a sort of hunter, but one who hunts terrestrial creatures \nrather than aquatic. The Stranger first defines the sophist as a \nhired hunter of rich young men (Sophist 223b; 231d). \n\nSo far angling seems well suited to direct the inquirers toward their\ngoal. Set on the right track, they readily complete the rest of the \ndivision. But at the end of the first division, the Stranger remarks \nthat the sophist’s art is really quite complicated (Sophist 223c). He then \nturns his attention to a feature mentioned toward the end of that \ndivision. The sophist earns wages from those he hunts, and he has a \nproduct to sell. Returning to acquisitive art, the Stranger this time\nignores the branch that leads to hunting, and instead follows the \nother branch, beginning from the art of acquisition by exchange, and \ndefines the sophist as someone engaged in commerce, who sells \nproducts for the soul (Sophist 224c–d; 231d). In the pages following, the \nStranger focuses on various activities of the sophist and \ndefines him in five different ways. Each time the sophist turns up at\nthe tips of branches stemming from acquisitive art. Then on a sixth \nround the Stranger makes a fresh initial division of art, marking off\nthe art of separation, and finds the sophist at the terminus of a \nbranch originating from there. \n\nWhat should we make of the fact that the sophist turns up all over the\ntree, and not at a single terminus like the angler? The angler differs\nfrom the sophist in two main respects. First, the essence of the\nangler is evident from his activity and is easy to spell out using\ndichotomous division. As the Stranger says in the Statesman\n(see above § 2), some things are easily pictured: we can perceive\nthe angler’s essential activity, fishing by means of a special hook,\nand readily depict it. The essence of the sophist, too, might seem\neasy to picture from his activities. He engages in many observable\nactivities, so it seems appropriate to define him in a number of\nways. But the essence of the sophist, as we soon discover, is none of\nthose things. His essential activity cannot be pictured, as angling\ncan. Second, the nature of angling is uncontroversial, and the\nStranger and Theaetetus mean the same thing by the name\n(Sophist 218e). By contrast, people have various conceptions\nof what sophistry is, witnessed by the numerous divisions. They may\nalso disagree about what individuals fall under the kind. Because\nsophistry is a disputed notion, people may have different conceptions\nof it, and some conceptions may be simply mistaken. \n\nThe sophist is not unique in his tendency to turn up all over a tree.\nAnything, including very simple things, can do the same, because\npeople experience them in different ways and so have different\nconceptions of them. People tend to share the same concept of an\nangler, because he engages in a single observable activity. But\nanything of any complexity, engaged in several activities, is apt to\nbe conceived in different ways by different people. Some of those\nconceptions may capture the entity by a feature or activity essential\nto it, but many others will capture it in some accidental\nway. Division does not itself guarantee that one attends to essential\nfeatures. Furthermore, a dispute might arise about virtually any\nentity, but in many cases we can sort out disagreements by perception\nor by some straightforward decision-procedure (we can settle disputes\nabout number by counting, disputes about size or weight by measuring\nor weighing: Euthyphro 7b–c; cf. Phaedrus\n263a–b). In other cases there is no ready way to decide. \n\nThe anomalous sixth division of the sophist (Sophist\n226b–231b) reveals sophistry as a disputed concept. Whereas the\nfirst five divisions locate the sophist somewhere under acquisitive\nart, the sixth division locates him in a quite different place, under\nthe art of separation, marked off expressly from productive and\nacquisitive art, as a third kind under technê, to deal\nwith this case. The sixth sophist purifies souls of beliefs that\ninterfere with learning, and he looks a lot like Socrates. The\nStranger queries using the label “sophist” in this case\nand calls the art he has just uncovered the “noble” art of\nsophistry. The sixth division exploits the fact that many people\nmistook Socrates for a sophist (cf. Aristophanes’ depiction of\nSocrates in the Clouds and Socrates’ defense against the\ncharge in Plato’s Apology). This definition fails to capture\nthe sophist by even an accidental feature, but instead snares a\ndistinct kind called by the same name owing to a superficial\nresemblance. \n\nThe sophist is special not because he turns up in so many places, or\nbecause some conceptions pick out different kinds altogether that\nmerely share the same name. The sophist is unique because the\nmultiplicity in his case reflects not only something about us and our\nexperience, but also something about him and his art. The Stranger\nrestates the six definitions of the sophist (Sophist\n231c–e), and then observes: \n\nThe Stranger has defined the sophist as a hired hunter of rich young\nmen, as engaged in selling his own and other people’s wares for the\nsoul, as an expert in disputation about justice and injustice, and so\non. Why is the appearance not sound, and why does it indicate that we,\nwho experience that appearance, have failed to see that feature\n“toward which all these sorts of learning look”? People\ncall all six conceptions by the name “sophist.” Why does\nthe Stranger say that those who experience this unhealthy appearance\ncall the entity by many names instead of one? \n\nThe Stranger will go on to point out that the sophist makes people\nthink he knows things he doesn’t know (Sophist\n232b–233c). The sophist’s pretense would certainly explain the\nunhealthiness of the appearance of manifold expertise, but the\npreceding discussion and definitions leading up to the quoted passage\nhave not revealed the sophist’s pretense. One must look ahead in the\ndialogue to see that. Instead the unhealthy appearance seems to rest\non the very fact that the sophist, as so far defined, has so many\nsorts of expertise—he knows how to hunt, how to make a profit,\nhow to sell his own intellectual wares, how to dispute about justice\nand injustice, how to purify the soul of ignorance (cf. Notomi 1999,\n80). Our judgment is unsound because we, who experience the sophist’s\nappearance of manifold expertise, fail to detect that feature of his\nart “toward which all these sorts of learning\nlook”—something about the sophist that explains why he\nseems to know so much, something about him that would justify our\ncalling him by one name: “sophist.” \n\nWhat is that one thing still missing? As the discussion proceeds, the\nStranger argues that we are missing the feature of sophists that\nexplains how they can successfully appear wise to their\nstudents, when they are not in fact wise (Sophist\n233b–c). He and Theaetetus carefully defined the sophist in\nterms of many of his activities but none of those makes him what he\nis. They have so far missed the essence of the sophist, and for that\nreason they mistakenly call him by many names instead of one. \n\nThe visitor introduces a new paradigm (Sophist 233d) to\nunmask the special nature of the sophist’s art: the art of\nimitation. By means of imitation a painter can make products with the\nsame names as the originals and fool children into thinking he can\nmake anything he wants (Sophist 234b–c). The sophist\nachieves the same result with statements (logoi), making\nlarge things appear small, and easy things hard, and could fool young\npeople (Sophist 234c–235a). All the appearances are\nlinked together by the sophist’s skill at imitating people who truly\nknow the things he seems to know. \n\nWith that insight, the Stranger declares that they have nearly caught\nthe sophist and sets out in pursuit (he finally completes this seventh\ndivision at the end of the dialogue).  This time ignoring the entire\nbranch of acquisitive art from which the first five divisions set out,\nhe instead takes the branch of productive art down to image-making and\ndivides it into two parts, copy-making (eikastikê) and\nappearance-making (phantastikê). Whereas a copy-maker\npreserves the proportions of the paradigm (paradeigma in its\nmore usual sense), and keeps the appropriate colors and other details,\nan appearance-maker alters the true proportions of the original, so\nthat the image appears beautiful from a distance (Sophist\n235c–236c). The visitor’s proclaimed uncertainty about which\nkind includes the sophist takes him into the dialogue’s main project,\nthe investigation of not-being, an investigation needed to make sense\nof appearances and false statement. \n\nIn essence the sophist produces appearances, and \nmore precisely false appearances. So to understand the \nsophist, the inquirers have to make sense of appearances and their \nproduction. And to do that, the Stranger must take on Parmenides, who\nfamously said: \n\nTo define the sophist as an expert in deception, as someone who \nproduces false appearances by means of statements, the Stranger needs\nto show that Parmenides was wrong; he needs to demonstrate that it is\npossible to say and to think that things-that-are-not are, and to do \nso without contradiction. He starts with a series of puzzles about \nnot-being and then suggests that we may be in similar confusion about\nbeing. \n\nA false assumption about negation makes it seem impossible to think or\ntalk about not-being. The inquirers assume that a negation specifies\nthe opposite of the item negated (Sophist 240b,\n240d).  Think of opposites as polar incompatibles—a\npair of opposed terms that exclude each other. These include polar\ncontraries, such as black and white, or hot and cold, which have some\nintermediate between them; and contradictories, such as odd and even,\nlarge and not-large, or beautiful and not-beautiful, which do not (see\nKeyt 1973, 300 n. 33). If not-being is the opposite of being, then\nnot-being is nothing at all, and we cannot think about that. A second\nsource of trouble about not-being infects being as well. The speakers\nmistakenly assume that there is a one-to-one correspondence between a\nname and a thing: a name picks out something, different names pick out\ndifferent things, and each thing has one proper name. The Stranger\nlater attributes the idea to some people he derisively calls\nLate-Learners, who urge that we call a thing only by its own name and\nnot by any other. Thus they allow us to call a man “man”\nand the good “good,” but they do not allow us to call a\nman “good” (Sophist 251b–c) (for this\ninterpretation of the Late-Learners, see Moravcsik 1962, 57–59;\ncf. Bostock 1984, 99–100, Roberts 1986, 230, and Malcolm 2006a,\n278). \n\nGiven these assumptions, it seems impossible to talk about not-being\ncoherently (on the puzzles about not-being, cf. Owen 1971,\n241–44).  The first puzzle (Sophist 237b–e) shows\nthat we cannot meaningfully use the phrase “what-is-not,”\nbecause the phrase attempts and fails to pick out nothing. The second\npuzzle (Sophist 238a–c) shows that we cannot say\nanything meaningful about what-is-not (i.e., about nothing), because\nin using the words “what-is-not” we treat the referent as\none thing (by using the singular). The third puzzle (Sophist\n238d–239c) shows that we contradict ourselves even trying to\nstate the puzzles. If not-being is the opposite of being (i.e.,\nnothing), and if there is a one-to-one correspondence between a name\nand a thing, then Parmenides was right: we cannot coherently think or\ntalk about not-being. The Stranger still finds these puzzles\npersuasive at the end of the dialogue, because he says: “If a\nstatement is of nothing, it would not be a statement at all,\nfor we have shown that a statement that is a statement\n(logos) of nothing cannot be a statement”\n(Sophist 263c). In a final pair of puzzles (Sophist\n239c–240c; 240c–241b), the Stranger shows that Parmenides\nalso provides the sophist a means to escape his pursuers\n(Sophist 241a–c). The sophist does not say what-is-not\nafter all, because his images, while not the originals, are\nsomething—images like the originals—and not nothing. The\nspeakers later recognize that they made a mistake in assuming that\nnot-being is the opposite of being (Sophist 257b, 258e), but\nat this stage negation confounds them. \n\nThis entry skips over the puzzles about being, which aim to show that\nwe are in as much confusion about being as we are about not-being, a\nsituation that gives the Stranger hope: to the extent that he and\nTheaetetus get clear about being or not-being, they will get clear\nabout the other as well (Sophist 250e–251a) (Owen 1971,\n229–31, calls this claim the “Parity\nAssumption.”)[2] \n\nTo show that we can call one thing by many names and that some names\nspecify a thing but misdescribe it, the Stranger introduces some\nmachinery. He proposes that some kinds can partake of, or\nblend or associate with, other kinds (these terms\nappear to be synonyms and to introduce an asymmetrical relation\nbetween an entity and a property it has (pace Cornford 1935,\n255–57; see Ackrill 1957, 212–18), whereas some kinds\ncannot blend with each other (Sophist 251e–252e). Great\nkinds enable the blending of other kinds, much as vowels enable consonants\nto fit together (252e–253a). Just as one needs expertise to know\nhow letters combine, so one needs expertise to know how forms\ncombine—an expertise the Stranger calls dialectic and\nattributes to the philosopher (Sophist 253b–e). (For\ndifferent interpretations of the brief vexed passage on dialectic in\nthe Sophist, see Stenzel 1931 [1940], Gómez-Lobo 1977,\nand M. L. Gill 2012, ch. 7.) \n\nThe Stranger announces that there are five great kinds\n(Sophist 254b–c), and he will ask two questions about\nthem: (1) Of what sort are they? and (2) what capacity do they have to\nassociate with other things?  (Sophist 254c). The five kinds\nare change, rest, being, sameness and difference, and he will\neventually interpret not-being as difference (Sophist 257b,\n258e–259a). He does not say that these five are the only great\nkinds.  There are probably others, including likeness and unlikeness,\noneness and multitude (cf. Parmenides 129d–e and\n130b). The second part of the Parmenides investigates such\nkinds, especially oneness and multitude, being and not-being, but also\nsameness and difference, likeness and unlikeness, equality and\ninequality, and others. The visitor presumably selects the five he\ndoes in the Sophist, because for the present purpose he needs\na pair of opposites that exclude each other (change and rest,\ndescribed as “most opposite” [Sophist 250a],\nserve as mutually exclusive consonant forms) and three vowel\nforms—being, sameness, and difference—enabling kinds to\nfit together or to be marked off from others. \n\nThe central section of the Sophist has been much discussed\nand remains controversial. The distinction between consonant and vowel\nforms concerns the way kinds relate to other kinds, but different\ntypes of forms usually play these two roles. Consonant forms have\ncategorial content—that is, they can be organized into\ngenus-species trees, like entities in Aristotle’s Categories\nand like the kinds in the earlier divisions in the\nSophist. Vowel forms are empty of categorial content but have\nstructural content, and the greatest of the great kinds apply to\neverything. Philosophers in the Middle Ages would call such kinds\ntranscendentals, since they transcend Aristotle’s ten\ncategories (substance, quantity, quantity, and the other categories);\nGilbert Ryle called them syncategorematic. These entities are\nnot highly general kinds—viewed as such, they would be\ncategorial, since highest genera have (very general) categorial\ncontent. In Ryle’s words, the vowel forms “function not like the\nbricks but like the arrangement of the bricks in a building”\n(Ryle 1939 [1965], esp. 131, 143–44). They structure\nother kinds and enable them to relate to one another. Let us call them\nstructural kinds (do not take the label to suggest that\ncategorial kinds lack structure, only that structural kinds are purely\nstructural and derive categorial content through their\napplications). \n\nStructural kinds apply to categorial individuals and kinds on the\nbasis of other, ultimately categorial properties those entities have.\nFor instance, two objects are equal or unequal if they have some\ndefinite size or duration, or if they are numerable. Two objects are\nlike, if they have one or more properties in common. A red cube and a\nred ball are like because they share redness in common.  They are\nunlike, because they have different shapes. The nature of a structural\nkind is determined by its functional role in enabling categorial kinds\nto be what they are and/or to associate with or differ from one\nanother. \n\nThe great kinds change and rest are problematic, because they are\nsometimes treated as categorial kinds—for instance, in the\nParmenides change is divided into the species alteration and\nlocomotion, and locomotion is further divided into spinning in the\nsame place and moving from one place to another\n(Parmenides138b–c, cf.  Theaetetus\n181c–d)—whereas sometimes they are listed along with other\nstructural kinds, e.g., Parmenides 129d–e,\n136a–c. (For alternative interpretations of change and rest in\nthe Sophist, see Reeve 1985 and M. L. Gill 2012.) Whatever\nPlato ultimately thinks about the status of change and rest, in the\nsecond half of the Sophist his Stranger needs them to serve\nas opposed, mutually exclusive, consonant kinds and uses them\nrepeatedly in his arguments marking off the five great kinds from one\nanother. So we should construe them there as consonant/categorial\nkinds. \n\nIn the first part of this section (Sophist 254d–255e),\nthe Stranger addresses question (1): Of what sort is each of the great\nkinds? He distinguishes each of the five kinds from one another,\nstarting with being, change, and rest. Change and rest, as opposites,\ndo not associate with each other; but being applies to both, since we\nsay that both of them are. Being must be a third kind distinct from\nthem, for if being, which applies to both opposites, were the same as\neither of them—say change—then when being applies to rest,\nby substitution rest would partake of its own opposite, which is\nimpossible (Sophist 254d, with 249e–250c). The Stranger\nuses a similar argument to show that sameness and difference are\ndistinct from change and rest (Sophist\n254d–255b). Furthermore, being is distinct from sameness. They\nhave to be different, because if they were not, when we say that\nchange and rest both are, we could substitute “are” with\n“the same,” and change would be the same as rest\n(Sophist 255b–c). (Much more can be said about\nsameness: for discussion see, e.g., Lewis 1976, and de Vries\n1988.) \n\nFinally, the Stranger distinguishes difference from being. This \nargument introduces a crucial distinction between two senses or uses \nof “is” and deserves a separate subsection. \n\nThe Stranger uses an important distinction to \nmark off difference from being: \n\nSo the nature of difference is a fifth kind (Sophist 255d–e). \n\nDifference is distinct from being, because difference is always \nrelative to other things (pros alla), whereas being is both \nitself by itself (auto kath’ hauto) and relative to other \nthings (pros alla). \n\nWhat is it for something to be itself by itself and/or \nin relation to other things (for a detailed discussion of \nthis distinction, see Dancy 1999)? The traditional understanding of \nthe distinction relies on a passage from Diogenes Laertius (first \nhalf of the 3rd century CE). Diogenes uses the expression \n“in relation to something” (pros ti) in place of\n“in relation to other things” (pros alla): \n\nMany scholars think that, in saying that being is said both itself by\nitself (auto kath’ hauto) and in relation to other things\n(pros alla), Plato distinguishes different senses of the verb\n“to be”—a complete or absolute sense\n(“exists,” as in “The sea is”) and an\nincomplete sense (the “is” of predication, as in\n“the sea is blue” and/or the “is” of identity,\nas in “the sea is the sea”) (Cornford 1935; Ackrill\n1957). There is no separate verb “to exist” in classical\nGreek; existence was expressed by means of the verb “to\nbe.” \n\nIf the Stranger characterizes being as having two (or more) senses, we\nexpect Plato to mention two (or more) forms of being, one for each\nsense. Note that the Stranger introduces sameness as a distinct kind,\nwhich should take care of the “is” of identity, so the\nreal issue is whether Plato distinguishes two other senses of the verb\n“to be,” a complete existential sense and an incomplete\npredicative sense. Michael Frede (1967, 1992) and G. E. L. Owen (1971)\nargue that Plato does not mark off two senses of the verb “to\nbe,” but only different uses. There are significant differences\nbetween these scholars’ views, but their common ground, that Plato\nuses “being” only as an incomplete predicate, has been\nqueried. Sentences in the Sophist, such as “Change is,\nbecause it partakes of being” (Sophist 256a), are most\nnaturally construed as using “is” as a complete predicate\n(existence). \n\nBut if Plato does use the verb “to be” as a complete\npredicate, why does he not mention two forms, existence and a form\ndesignated by the incomplete “is” of predication? Lesley\nBrown (1986) has argued that there is no sharp semantic distinction\nbetween the two syntactically distinct uses of the verb “to\nbe” in “x is F” and “x\nis.” The “is” in “x is” is\ncomplete but allows a further completion. If Brown is right, Plato\nneed not distinguish two senses of “is,” and claims in the\nSophist, such as “Change is, because it partakes of\nbeing,” can also be accommodated. Change is (exists), because it\nis something—it has a property that makes it the very thing that\nit is: change. \n\nNotice that on this view the complete use of “is” in \nGreek does not correspond to existence in our modern sense: we say \nthat horses exist, whereas imaginary objects, such as Pegasus, do not. \nOn the proposed interpretation, anything describable is (exists). So \nPegasus is (exists), since we can describe him as a winged horse. On \nthe other hand, what-is-not is nothing at all—indescribable. It\nwas this notion of not-being—nothing—that was responsible\nfor the earlier puzzles about not-being in the Sophist. (For\ncriticisms of Brown’s view, see Malcolm 2006b, and for criticisms of \nMalcolm and Brown, see Leigh 2008.) \n\nSupposing that being is a structural kind that functions in two ways,\nlet us consider its operation with categorial and other structural\nkinds. Take some kind F-ness. F-ness is itself by itself\n(auto kath’ hauto), if being links F-ness to its own nature,\nto what F-ness is by (or because of) itself. For instance, change is\nchanging by itself, largeness is large by itself, heat is hot by\nitself, the one is one by itself. The associated statements are\nself-predications of the sort Plato’s characters mention in earlier\ndialogues (“largeness is large,” “justice is\njust;” for self-predications in the Sophist, see\n258b–c). Scholars disagree about how to understand\nself-predication in Plato. (For a view quite different from that\narticulated here, see the entry on\n Plato: middle period metaphysics and epistemology.)\n In self-predications the item specified by the\nsubject-expression and the item specified by the predicate are\nidentical, but the relation between them is participation\n(cf. Heinaman 1981). F-ness has its own nature by (or because of)\nitself. One might say that the property F-ness exhausts what\nF-ness is in its own right. \n\nF-ness is in relation to other things, if being links F-ness \nto something other than itself. For instance, change is \ndifferent from rest. Here being links change to difference, and \ndifference relates change to something other than change. Or change \nis the same as itself: “When we say change is the same\nas itself, we speak in this way because of its participation in \nthe same in relation to itself [pros \nheautên])” (Sophist 256a–b). Being links change to sameness,\nand sameness relates change to itself. \n\nNotice that Plato speaks often of participation and blending but \nmentions no distinct form of participation. He mentions no distinct \nform, because being simply is the form that links a subject to a \nproperty it has. \n\nDifference always operates in relation to something different (pros \nheteron) (Sophist 255d). Difference invariably relates the kind F-ness to \nsomething different from F-ness. \n\nAlthough difference as a structural kind always relates an entity\nF-ness to something other than F-ness, difference can itself be a\nsubject-kind and be related to itself (via being itself by\nitself). Difference is different by (or because of) itself\n(Sophist 259a–b, with 255e and 258b–c). Being and\ndifference admit of self-predication like any other kind. \n\nThe second part of the treatment of great kinds takes up question (2):\nWhat capacity do the five kinds have to associate with one another?\nThe Stranger carries out the analysis for one sample kind, change\n(Sophist 255e–256d), and argues systematically that\nchange is non-identical with each of the other four kinds (change is\nnot rest, not the same, and so on), but partakes of three of the\nfour—all but rest (for comprehensive analysis of the section,\nsee Brown 2008). Thus it turns out that change both is and\nis not each of the others (the Stranger even adds the\ncounterfactual: if change could partake of rest there would be nothing\nstrange about calling it resting [Sophist 256b]). The whole\nanalysis is implemented with two relations: non-identity (F-ness is\nnot G-ness, because F-ness partakes of difference from G-ness), and\npositive predication (F-ness is G, because F-ness partakes of\nG-ness). For example, change is not the same, because change partakes\nof difference from the same, but change is the same, because change\npartakes of sameness in relation to itself (Sophist\n256a–b). \n\nScholars have noted that the Stranger’s machinery, as so far \narticulated, seems insufficient to address the upcoming problem of \nfalse statement. The visitor has provided an analysis of identity \n(via being and sameness), non-identity (via being and difference), \nand positive predication (via being). What about negative \npredication, needed for Plato’s analysis of false statements, \nsuch as “Theaetetus is flying”? Isn’t this statement false, \nprecisely because the negative predication, “Theaetetus is not \nflying,” is true? Can Plato also handle negative predication? \n\nWith the main machinery in place for his analysis, the Stranger will \nshortly turn to false statement. But two preliminary topics remain: \n(1) How does negation work? (2) What is a statement? \n\nThe Stranger made a serious mistake about negation in the puzzles\nabout not-being earlier in the dialogue (highlighted at\nSophist 240b, 240d), in supposing that the negation in\n“not-being” indicates the opposite\n(enantion) of being. The opposite of being is\nnothing, and Parmenides is right that we cannot speak or\nthink about nothing: if we speak or think at all, we speak or think\nabout something. But Parmenides mistakenly thought that all\ntalk about not-being is attempted talk about nothing. \n\nThe Stranger solves the problem of not-being by recognizing two \nthings: (1) the negation operates on the predicate, not the \nsubject; (2) the negation need not specify the opposite of the item \nwhose name is negated but only something different from it. \n\nSome scholars think that the Stranger extends his machinery to include\nnegative predication, as well as non-identity, at the end of the\nsection on great kinds. He appears to switch his focus from the\nsubject-kind to the attribute, since he speaks of being and not-being\n“about” the subject. He sums up his conclusions about\nchange and generalizes to other kinds saying: “And so\nnecessarily not-being applies to (epi) change and\nto (kata) all the other kinds”\n(Sophist 256d); and then: “So about\n(peri) each of the forms the being is much and the not-being\nis unlimited in multitude” (Sophist 256e). Some\nscholars take the not-being applicable to change to include negative\nfeatures (e.g., not quick) as well as kinds it differs from (e.g.,\nrest) (for interpretations of this sentence, see McDowell 1982 and\nFrede 1992). \n\nThe Stranger calls attention to the mistake about negation and offers\na solution. Here too he focuses on the predicate: \n\nApparently, when one says, “Simmias is not large,” one \nindicates by the “not” merely something \ndifferent from large. Simmias could be equal or small in \ncomparison with someone else. \n\nNow there is a pressing interpretive question. Does the statement\n“Simmias is not large” assert that largeness is different\nfrom every attribute Simmias has (manhood, bravery, red-hair,\nblue-eyes, and so on)? (Keyt 1973 and Brown 2008 call this the\n“Oxford interpretation.” For a recent defense of it, see Crivelli 2012.) The discussion of “not\nlarge” itself suggests otherwise. “Different from\nlarge,” while not meaning the opposite of largeness (the polar\ncontrary smallness), means some size other than largeness\n(smallness being one possibility among others). The negation\ndesignates something within a wider kind, and the predicate negated\n(say “large”) indicates that wider kind. \n\nIn characterizing the nature of difference, the Stranger compares it\nto knowledge (Sophist 257c–d) (on this analogy, cf. Lee\n1972). Knowledge is a categorial kind, and many species of knowledge\ndiffer structurally from one another (cf. below § 7.2). Even so,\nthe comparison is instructive because some branches of knowledge, such\nas applied mathematics, are distinguished from one another, not by\nintrinsic differences in the structure of the expertise, but simply by\ndifferences in the objects to which the same expertise applies (e.g.,\ncalculation in surveying and navigation). Like varieties of applied\nmathematics, whose content derives from the domain to which the\nknowledge applies, parts of difference acquire their content from the\nitem whose name is negated. \n\nThe visitor gives a second example of negation, and the example helps\nto clarify his proposal. A part of difference called “the\nnot-beautiful” is set in opposition to the beautiful and differs\nfrom the nature of the beautiful (Sophist 257d). He says: \n\nThe Stranger mentions two kinds in addition to the not-beautiful,\nsince he marks off the not-beautiful from some one kind among beings,\nand then sets it in opposition to the nature of the beautiful. The\nnot-beautiful is not just anything other than beautiful, but something\nother than beautiful within a kind that covers both (call it\n“the aesthetic”). On this view a part of difference gets\nits categorial content in two ways from the item whose name is\nnegated. First, the part falls within a wider kind (such as size,\ntemperature, the aesthetic) determined by the positive attribute\nF-ness, and that wider kind is divided into subkinds which exclude one\nanother and jointly exhaust the genus; and second, the part has an\nattribute different from F-ness within that genus. All individuals\nlocated under the genus occupy one and only one subkind. The subkinds\ncan form an incompatibility range—an ordered continuum\nunder a covering kind, such as degrees of coldness and heat under\ntemperature or degrees of smallness and largeness under size—but\nthey need not constitute an ordered series. They can instead\nconstitute an incompatibility set, such as circle, square,\ntriangle, and other species under shape; or man, ox, horse, and other\nspecies under animal. The earlier mistake about negation was the\nassumption that “the not-F” specifies the opposite of\nF-ness. According to the new proposal “the not-F”\nspecifies the complement of F-ness under a wider\nkind—that is, all the disjoint subkinds under the wider kind\nother than F-ness. Any individual characterized as “not-F”\nfalls under the complement of F-ness and has some feature other than\nF-ness within the wider kind. Thus, for example, when you say\n“Simmias is not large,” you indicate that Simmias has some\ndefinite size other than largeness, either the polar contrary\nsmallness or some intermediate size. (Brown, 2008, calls this\ntreatment of negation the “incompatibility range”\ninterpretation; see also Ferejohn 1989, Szaif 1996, and M. L. Gill,\n2012, ch. 5.) \n\nMaking a statement (true or false) requires three steps (cf. Frede\n1992, who mentions two steps): first, the speaker must pick out an\nindividual or kind to say something about, since a statement must be\nabout something to be a statement at all; second, he must pick out an\nindividual, kind, or feature to relate to the original entity; and\nthird, he asserts a relation between the two items—identity,\nnon-identity, attribution, or non-attribution. A statement consists\nminimally of two parts, with one part (the grammatical subject)\nreferring to the entity the statement is about, and the other (the\npredicate) asserting something about that entity. Only if the\npredicate states something (that is or is not the case) about a\nsubject is there a complex—a statement—that can be true or\nfalse (Sophist 262e–263d). The Stranger distinguishes\nbetween names and verbs (Sophist\n261d–262a), saying that a verb is a sign set over actions, and a\nname a sign set over things that perform the actions. No statement\nconsists simply of a string of names or a string of verbs but must minimally fit a name together with a verb (Sophist\n262a–c). \n\nThe main idea about statements is simple: a statement has\nstructure and its parts perform different functions. The name\n(grammatical subject) refers to something, and if it fails to pick out\nanything the statement does not come off (Sophist 262e). The\nverb (predicate) ascribes to that thing an action (or property). If\nsomeone asserts of a subject a predicate ascribing to it something\nthat is (the case) about it (an action the thing is actually\nperforming or an attribute it actually has), the statement is\ntrue; whereas if he asserts of it a predicate ascribing\nsomething that is not (the case) about it (something\ndifferent from what is the case about it), then the statement\nis false (Sophist 263b). For instance, when the\nStranger says of Theaetetus, who is currently sitting,\n“Theaetetus is sitting,” his statement is true because it\nasserts something that is the case about Theaetetus; but when he says\nof Theaetetus (still sitting), “Theaetetus is flying,” his\nstatement is false, because “flying” specifies something\ndifferent from what is the case about Theaetetus (namely,\nsitting). \n\nThe statements the Stranger considers, “Man learns,” \n“Theaetetus is sitting,” and “Theaetetus is \nflying,” are all positive predications, the first two true, the\nthird false. But as noted above (§ 5.5), we need negative \npredication to analyze the false statement, “Theaetetus is \nflying.” Since the statement is false, the statement \n“Theaetetus is not flying” is true. \n\nNegative predication has received considerable attention in the\nscholarly literature on the Sophist (for helpful accounts of\nthe various interpretations, and their advantages and disadvantages,\nsee Keyt 1973 and Crivelli 2012). Some scholars think that Plato needs\na second notion of negation in addition to difference (understood as\ndistinctness or non-identity), such as incompatibility, to accommodate\nnegative predication. On this view, flying is incompatible with one of\nTheaetetus’ properties (namely sitting). The incompatibility\ninterpretation requires Plato to change the meaning of\nheteron from “different” to\n“incompatible,” and there is no evidence in the text that\nhe does. The Oxford interpretation (mentioned above § 6.1) has\nthe advantage of keeping a single meaning for heteron but\ncalls for universal quantification over properties: to analyze the\nstatement “Theaetetus is not flying,” one must show that\nflying is different from everything that Theaetetus is—a man,\nsnub-nosed, sitting, and so on. The Sophist does not provide\nevidence of such an approach (see Wiggins 1971; Bostock 1984, 113;\nWhite 1993, §§ 10, 11). \n\nIf Plato construes difference as a structural kind that operates in\nthe way we have discussed (the incompatibility range interpretation),\nhe can handle negative predication without introducing a second\nmeaning of heteron. We need not consider all of Theaetetus’\nproperties to explain the falsehood of “Theaetetus is\nflying.” The analysis of negative predication is complex: the\nitem negated in “Simmias is not large” indicates a\ndivision of the genus size, and the negation designates something\ndifferent (non-identical, distinct) from largeness within that\ngenus. In the case of Theaetetus’ imagined flight, we must find\nthat activity different from flying within the relevant\nincompatibility set, a set apparently consisting of our pair of\nconsonant forms: change/rest. Since Theaetetus is currently sitting (a\nspecies of rest), his current rest excludes flying (a species of\nchange). One can explain his not flying by appeal to his sitting. \n\nLike the Sophist, the opening division in the \nStatesman locates a problem with its target kind. Whereas \nthe sophist turned up all over the tree, the statesman turns up at a \nsingle terminus, but he is not alone, since many rivals have a claim \nto be there too. Just as the puzzle about the sophist revealed by the\nopening divisions indicated something significant about the essence \nof a sophist, so the competition at a single terminus indicates \nsomething significant about the essence of a statesman. \n\nThe Statesman embarks on its division without a new paradigm.\nApparently the angler from the previous dialogue serves as a viable\nguide for the method of dichotomous division itself. As we noted in\n§ 3.1, the Statesman opens its investigation with a\ncollection of kinds (king, statesman, household manager, slave-owner)\nthat share salient features in common, and this collection allows a crude\ndescription of the kind to be defined, which guides the inquiry. Since\ninstances of the target kind can direct and control other people by\nmeans of their understanding without physical manipulation, the\nStranger starts his division from the wide kind knowledge and\nimmediately divides it into practical and theoretical, and then looks\nfor the statesman down the branch originating from theoretical\nknowledge. The opening division takes place in two stages—a\nfirst stage focusing on the statesman’s knowledge, followed by a\nlecture on method, and a second stage focusing on the object of that\nknowledge. Both phases of the division are peculiar but in different\nways. \n\nConsider stage one. Having set off down the theoretical branch of\nknowledge in search for the statesman, the Stranger divides\ntheoretical knowledge into two sub-kinds. One kind recognizes\ndifference, judges things recognized and then leaves off (the art of\ncalculation is here); the other kind recognizes difference and judges\nthings recognized, and then directs on the basis of that judgment\n(statecraft is here) (Statesman 259d–260c). Directing\nsuggests practical, if not hands-on, knowledge, so keep in mind that\npractical knowledge was marked off from theoretical knowledge and\nabandoned at the start. Next he divides directive knowledge into two\nsorts, of which one passes on the directions of others (heralds are\nhere), while the other passes on its own directions for the sake of\ngeneration (the statesman is here) (Statesman\n260c–261b). Knowledge for the sake of generation/production\nagain suggests practical expertise, and the statesman’s knowledge\nlooks ever more practical as the division continues. At the next\ndivision one kind passes on its own directions to generate inanimate\nthings (the master-builder belongs here), while the other does so to\ngenerate animate things (the statesman belongs here)\n(Statesman 261b–d). The Stranger then divides this\nlatter kind into those who generate and rear single animate things\n(ox-drivers and grooms are here), and those who generate and rear them\nin herds (the statesman and herdsman are here) (Statesman\n261d). Once the statesman merges with the herdsman, the theoretical\nbranch has become thoroughly mixed up with the practical branch\noriginally discarded, since the knowledge of horse-breeders, cowherds,\nshepherds, and swineherds is practical and scarcely theoretical. No\nwonder the statesman will prove to have company at the terminus:\nfarmers, millers, physical trainers, doctors, and other experts also\ntake care of practical aspects of human life (Statesman\n267e–268a). \n\nAt the end of the first stage of the division, when the inquirers have\nreached herd-rearing, the Stranger invites Young Socrates to make the\nnext division himself. By now the boy sees where the division is\nheading and proposes to mark off the rearing of humans (statecraft)\nfrom the rearing of other animals (ordinary herding)\n(Statesman 262a). The Stranger stops him, objecting that such\na division is like dividing the human race into Greek and barbarian:\nbarbarian is not a proper kind because its members share only a\nnegative feature, being non-Greek speakers. The mistake is like\nmarking off all numbers other than 10,000 (Statesman\n262c–263a). The Stranger advises Young Socrates to divide\nthrough the middle of things and not break off one small part from a\nlarge part without a form (e.g., he should divide number into even and\nodd, and human into male and female [Statesman\n262e]). Someone hoping to encounter forms should, he says, make\ndivisions into parts that also have a form (Statesman\n262a–c). \n\nAlthough the Stranger admits that he is wandering from the topic and\nshould put off discussion of method until another occasion, he tarries\na little longer to give a lecture on the difference between mere parts\nof a kind and parts that are themselves genuine kinds\n(Statesman 263b). Apparently, real kinds include only members\nwith some positive feature in common, while other parts allow members\nsharing only a negative feature. Scholars have taken the Stranger’s\nlecture very seriously as indicating Plato’s views about proper\nprocedure and the metaphysics on which division relies, and they\nappeal especially to Plato’s Phaedrus, where the elder\nSocrates announces that someone engaging in correct procedure should\ndivide kinds at their natural joints, not hack off bits like a bad\nbutcher (Phaedrus 265e) (see Moravcsik 1973, Cohen 1973, and\nWedin 1987). Before we assess Young Socrates’ mistake and the\nStranger’s lecture, we ought to consider the second stage of the\ndivision, since it purports to demonstrate correct procedure. \n\nFirst the visitor retraces his steps and points out that in speaking\nof rearing animate things, he and Young Socrates had already in effect\ndivided living creatures into wild and tame (Statesman\n264a). All rearing deals with tame animals, and some of that rearing\ndevotes itself to tame animals in herds. He then divides herd-rearing\ninto aquatic and terrestrial (the branch he pursues), next marks off\nthe winged from the footed (the branch he pursues), then the horned\n(oxen, sheep) from the hornless (the branch he pursues), then the\ninterbreeding (horses, donkeys) from the non-interbreeding (the branch\nhe pursues), and finally the four-footed (just pigs are left) from the\ntwo-footed (humans). He now defines statecraft as rearing the\ntwo-footed, non-interbreeding, hornless, terrestrial, tame herd:\nhumans (Statesman 267a–c). \n\nThis division has given Platonic division a bad name, and there is\nmuch to query (see Dorter 1994: 181–91), but perhaps the most\nobviously dubious move comes at the end: according to the division,\nthe swineherd has more in common with the statesman than with the\ncowherd and shepherd. Later in the dialogue the visitor says that the\nstatesman differs from all other herdsman (including the swineherd) in\na crucial respect. No one disputes with the cowherd his claim to look\nafter all aspects of the life of his herd—he rears them; he is\ntheir doctor, their match-maker, their breeder and trainer—and\nthe same is true of all other herdsmen, with one exception: the\nherdsman of humans, the statesman. In his case alone many rivals\ncompete for the title of caretaker—farmers produce their food,\ndoctors cure their diseases, physical trainers guide their exercise,\nand other experts attend to other human needs (Statesman\n267e–268d). Given this difference, would it not have been better\nto distinguish humans from other herded animals at the outset, as\nYoung Socrates proposed? \n\nYoung Socrates’ division into the herding of humans and the herding of\nother animals seems in retrospect to have considerable merit and\nindeed to apply two lessons from earlier in the day (cf. § 6.1\nabove). First, the Stranger said in the Sophist that parts of\nknowledge derive their names from the objects they are set over\n(Sophist 257c–d), and that claim justifies identifying\nstatecraft—a mode of herding—as human herding. Second, a\nnegation specifies the complement of a form within a wider kind, and\nthat thesis justifies distinguishing herded animals into humans and\nother animals. In the Sophist, kinds designated by negations,\nsuch as the not-large and the not-beautiful, have their own\ndistinctive feature (not-large, not-beautiful), and one might construe\nthem as forms, though the Stranger does not explicitly identify them\nas such (Sophist 257e–258c). Evidence from the\nSophist thus encourages a division of animals herded into\nhumans and other animals, especially since the negative kind has a\npositive name: “beast.” \n\nYoung Socrates has in fact made an error, but the nature of his error\nbecomes evident only later in the dialogue. In his zeal to reach the\ndestination he makes two related mistakes, one about the\nobjects of human herding, and the other about the associated\nart. The Stranger exploits the first mistake in the second\nstage of the division by relying on the boy’s assumption that herding\nis a single undifferentiated activity with branches marked off by the\nphysical traits of the animals herded. But is statecraft concerned\nwith humans as biological specimens? Human biology studies our\nphysical traits, but the upcoming Myth in the Statesman\nreveals that the aspect of humans salient to statecraft is our way of\nlife, our culture and expertise (Statesman\n274b–d).[3]\nYoung Socrates seems to view the objects of statecraft from the wrong\nperspective. Second, in focusing on the objects of\nstatecraft, he ignores the art itself and fails to notice that many\narts—farming, medicine, physical training, as well as\nstatecraft—look after the needs of human beings\n(Statesman 267e–268a). As caretaker of humans, the\nstatesman has lots of competition. The manner of the\nstatesman’s care, rooted in the structure of his expertise,\ndistinguishes statecraft from other arts that look after human beings\n(Statesman 274e–275a; cf. Lane 1998, 44). \n\nWhat should we make of the Stranger’s lecture on parts and kinds,\ngiven that it overlooks the real faults in Young Socrates’ proposal\nand that the second stage of the division yields such odd results? The\nStranger probably suspects the nature of the boy’s confusion and\nadopts an approach to help him see his mistake. His lecture assumes\nthe boy’s point of view (that statecraft differs from other modes of\nherding because of the physical traits of the animals herded), advises\nhim to divide kinds into sub-kinds with roughly equal extension, and\nthen demonstrates in hilarious detail the results of that\nassumption. According to this interpretation, we should not take the\nStranger’s lecture to reveal Plato’s views on metaphysics and\nmethod. In the lecture itself the visitor appears to warn Young\nSocrates and the audience to beware of his advice (Statesman\n263b: “But be absolutely on your guard against ever thinking\nthat you have heard this [i.e., the difference between kind and part]\nclearly distinguished by me”). \n\nOur suspicions should increase when we reflect on the Stranger’s\npractice in the dichotomous divisions in the Sophist and\nearlier in the Statesman. At the beginning of the\nStatesman the visitor declares that his search for the\nstatesman will start from the same genus used in the search for the\nsophist, but he will cut it in a different place (Statesman\n258b–c). No one remarks on the fact that in the Sophist\nthe visitor divided the genus art or expertise\n(technê), whereas now he calls the genus\n“knowledge” (epistêmê); he blurs the\ndifference further by using the terms technê and\nepistêmê interchangeably in the\nStatesman. In the Sophist he cut the genus at step\none into productive and acquisitive (later he added separative), and\nthis time cuts it at step one into practical and theoretical. Recall\nthat in the Phaedrus the elder Socrates advises his\ninterlocutor to divide kinds at the natural joints: dividing at the\nnatural joints mattered in that dialogue, because Socrates was\nclassifying kinds in order to sort out an ambiguity between two senses\nof the word “love” (eros), a vulgar love on the\nleft and a heavenly love on the right (Phaedrus\n265e–266b). The Sophist and Statesman use\ndichotomous division for a different purpose and consequently ignore\nparts on the left once marked off: the Stranger aims to define a\nsingle kind at the bottom of the right-hand branch of a\ntree. The target (however vague or even misguided the initial\nconception of it) determines what genus to divide at the start, then a\nuseful first cut and relevant next steps. Different targets (the\nangler, the sophist, the noble sophist, the statesman) prompt the\ninvestigators to carve up kinds in different ways (cf. Ackrill 1970,\n384; Cavini 1995, 131; Lane 1998, 34–38), and what counts as an\nappropriate cut depends on the target of the investigation. We should\nnot expect genuine kinds at intermediate steps on either the left- or\nright-hand side of the division. \n\nThe Stranger’s lecture on parts and kinds and the second stage of the\ndichotomous division contribute to the overall impression that the\nStatesman is a philosophical exercise designed to train\nstudents to recognize, diagnose, and correct mistakes. The dialogue is\nfull of trial and error, with many mistakes noticed and corrected\nalong the way, while others go unremarked. This strategy provokes the\ninterlocutor and audience to see for themselves what has gone wrong\nand why. In this way they learn the methods of Platonic dialectic. \n\nEarlier we observed (§ 4.2) that the problems of definition to\nwhich the Sophist calls attention, though not unique to the\nsophist, are in his case partially explained by his essence. The same\nis true of the statesman. Why does the statesman have so many rivals?\nThat is the puzzle of the statesman. Reflection on the shortcomings of\nthe first division and the Myth eventually suggests a way\nforward. What is the special manner of the statesman’s care\nas opposed to theirs? We have noticed that the inquirers tangle the\nthreads of theoretical and practical knowledge. This difficulty\narises, because statecraft, as we finally learn, involves both\ntheoretical and practical knowledge (cf. Statesman 284c,\n289c–d, 305c–d, 311b–c). Because of the nature of\nhis expertise, the statesman is intimately connected with everyone\nengaged in the care of humans; he oversees and directs their\nactivities and uses their products and services in his own\nhigher-order activity. Perhaps the statesman somehow combines\ntheoretical and practical knowledge in managing the interactions of\nthe members of his flock. Indeed, perhaps his essence is or includes\nthe art of combining, like weaving (Statesman\n279a–b). The last part of the dialogue recognizes this\nconnection and takes weaving as its paradigm. \n\nThe Stranger quickly presents a dichotomous division that yields the\nart of weaving and defines it as the art in charge of clothes\n(Statesman 279c–280a). Like the definition of the\nstatesman reached in the first part of the dialogue, this definition,\nfor all its detail, is too general, since many arts compete for the\nsame title: carding, spinning, spindle-making, mending,\nclothes-cleaning, and others. The dichotomous division fails to\nisolate the mode of clothes-working peculiar to weaving. \n\nThe paradigm of weaving serves two main functions (on the paradigm of\nweaving, cf. El Murr 2002 and Blondell 2005). First, it introduces a\nnew procedure allowing the inquirers to differentiate the target from\nother arts akin to it, all located in the lowest kind reached by the\nprevious dichotomous division. As earlier noted (§ 3.2), the new\nprocedure is division “by limbs, like a sacrificial\nanimal” (Statesman 287c) (for a different view of the\nStranger’s strategy, see El Murr 2005). Whereas dichotomous division\nseparates a kind into two parts, and then ignores at each step the\npart that does not lead to the goal, division by limbs breaks off\npieces of an original whole, whose members are interrelated and\ncooperate in tending their common object. All the arts of\nclothes-working have clothes as their object. Many of the kindred arts\nprovide weaving with its tools or materials (these contributing arts\nare characterized as sunaitiai, “helping\ncauses”). The differentiation of weaving from various subsidiary\narts reveals a procedure to define statecraft in relation to the\nsubordinate arts. \n\nSecond, weaving exemplifies an essential feature shared with the\ntarget: both weaving and statecraft engage in intertwining. The\nstatesman weaves in a number of ways, and in particular weaves\ntogether into one fabric the virtues of courage and moderation, often\nat odds in a city. The statesman and the weaver have many other\nfeatures in common. Both are experts in measurement, measuring the\nmore and the less not merely in relation to each other but more\nimportantly in relation to some practical goal they aim to achieve\n(Statesman 284a–e) (on the arts of measurement, see\nLane 1998, Delcomminette 2005, Lafrance 2005, and Sayre\n2006). Furthermore, the arts of both experts control the subsidiary\narts, whose products they use in their own activity\n(Statesman 308d–e). The statesman directs the experts\nwho are, as it were, the practical arms of his expertise and\nespecially those identified as his closest kin: the orator, the\ngeneral, the judge, and the teacher. The statesman, an expert in\ntiming (see Lane 1998), determines when the general should go to war,\nthough he leaves it to the general to work out military strategy and\ncarry it out. He determines the good that rhetoric will serve but\nleaves the techniques and practice of persuasion to the\nrhetorician. He decides what is just and lawful but leaves it to the\njudges to implement his decisions (Statesman\n303e–305d). The statesman must further determine what mix of\ncourage and moderation will most advance the good in the city, but he\ncalls on the teachers to instill in the youth the right belief about\nwhat is good (Statesman 308e–310a). The visitor tells\nus that the statesman cares for every aspect of things in the city,\nweaving them together in the most correct way\n(Statesman 305e). \n\nIn the first part of the Parmenides, the youthful Socrates\nsets out a theory of forms reminiscent of forms in the Phaedo\nand the Republic, and the main speaker, Parmenides, puts his\ntheory to the test by focusing on two chief questions: What forms are\nthere? and what is the nature of the relation between sensible things and their features\nand forms—the relation known as participation? At the end of the\ninterrogation in Part I, when Socrates has failed to rescue his\ntheory, and we might think that Plato should simply junk it,\nParmenides comes to its defense, saying that if someone with an eye on\nall the difficulties denies that there are stable forms, he will have\nnowhere to turn his thought and will destroy the power of dialectic\nentirely (Parmenides 135b–c). Scholars look to the\nSophist and Statesman and other late dialogues in\nthe hope of finding Plato’s answer to the problems posed in the\nParmenides. Does Plato continue to treat forms as he did in\nthe Phaedo and Republic, despite the objections? Are\nthe objections answerable and was Socrates simply too inexperienced to\nanswer them adequately? Do the late dialogues record Plato’s on-going\nperplexity? Or do they seriously modify Plato’s earlier positions? \n\nOur investigation of the Sophist and Statesman\nprompts two observations. First, these two dialogues are engaged in\ndialectic from beginning to end, and the Statesman explicitly\nclaims that the exercise aims to make us better dialecticians\n(Statesman 285d, 286d–287a). So Plato clearly thinks\nthat dialectic remains possible, and his Stranger seems actively\nengaged in helping his young interlocutors practice and learn the\ntechniques. Many scholars think that the method of dichotomous\ndivision is the method of dialectic in Plato’s late\ndialogues. Certainly this method serves a valuable heuristic purpose,\noften revealing what makes a particular concept (e.g., sophist,\nstatesman) puzzling, but once the puzzle has come to light, the main\nspeaker reorients the discussion and introduces new tools and\ntechniques (e.g., five great kinds, division by limbs). Platonic\ndialectic employs numerous and varied techniques adjusted to the\nspecial topic being explored. \n\n\nSecond, the Sophist and Statesman say a lot about\nforms, and yet the forms discussed in these dialogues seem different\nin some key respects from those discussed in the Phaedo and\nfirst part of the Parmenides. Both the Sophist and\nStatesman search for the essence of their target kinds, the\nstable feature or collection of features that makes its possessor what\nit is. Each dialogue succeeds in revealing the essence of the kinds\ninvestigated. Are the sophist, the statesman, the angler, the weaver,\nand their arts separate forms of the sort discussed in the first part\nof the Parmenides? Strange if they were, since the arts are\nhuman inventions. The visitor does say (as noted in § 2 above)\nthat “immaterial things, being finest and greatest, are revealed\nclearly only by means of a verbal account (logos) and by\nnothing else,” and that “all things now said are for the\nsake of those” (Statesman 285e–286b). The sophist\nand the statesman rank among great and difficult things\n(Sophist 218c–d, Statesman 278e;\ncf. 279a–b), and their arts are immaterial, though immanent in\ntheir possessors. So the visitor’s statement need not refer to\nseparate forms. Still, the Timaeus (widely regarded as a late\ndialogue) speaks of separate immaterial forms, and such forms would be\nincluded in the Stranger’s statement. Whatever one makes of the\ntreatment of forms in the Timaeus, separate forms are absent\nfrom the Sophist and Statesman, with one notable\nexception: at Sophist 245e–249d (the Battle of Gods and\nGiants), the Stranger tries to reconcile two extreme positions about\nbeing, one of which features separate, immaterial and unchanging forms. \n\nWhat should we think about forms of negations, such as the not-large\nand the not-beautiful? Aristotle criticized Plato for commitment to\nsuch forms (Metaphysics A.9, 990b), but notoriously Aristotle\nwas not always fair in his criticisms. The Sophist explicitly\nspeaks of the form of not-being (Sophist 258d: to\neidos…tou mê ontos), and a number of scholars regard the\nnot-large and the not-beautiful as forms (e.g., Moravcsik 1962, Frede\n1967, 92–94, Szaif 1996, 439–45, Crivelli 2012,\n204–14). The Stranger’s lecture on parts and kinds in the\nStatesman, rejecting forms of barbarian and numbers other\nthan 10,000, poses a well-known problem for that view, yet as we saw\n(§ 7.1 above) the lecture and second stage of the dichotomous\ndivision are themselves puzzling. Not only that: the Stranger warns\nYoung Socrates not to think he has heard anything clear from him about\nthe difference between a kind and a part (Statesman\n263b). This warning could strengthen the hand of those who attribute\nto Plato a commitment to forms of negations. One question we should be\nasking, though: what function(s) do Platonic forms perform? Does Plato\nneed a form whenever people call several things by the same name (as\nstated perhaps at Republic 10.596a)? Or does he invoke only\nthose forms needed to explain the features of things? In the latter\ncase, perhaps he can do without a form of the not-large, because he\ncan explain that range of sizes by appeal to the form of largeness and the\nform of not-being. Perhaps he needs no form of mud/clay (rejected by\nSocrates as a separate form at Parmenides 130c–e),\nsince he can explain the mixture by appeal to forms of its\ningredients, earth and water, and the ratio of their combination\n(Parmenides 130c, with Theaetetus\n147a–c). Questions about the scope of forms in Plato remain far\nfrom settled. \n\nIn addition to categorial kinds such as the sophist and statesman, there\nare also the great kinds discussed in the \nSophist—change, rest, being, sameness, and difference. \nThese kinds were embraced in the Parmenides (esp. \nParmenides 130b), but they seem markedly \ndifferent from ordinary kinds like the sophist and statesman. The \nvowel forms—being, sameness, and difference—appear to \nstructure other kinds, enabling them to be what they are and to \nrelate to one another. Dialectic aims to discover and articulate \nthose structures. Structural kinds are closely tied to dialectic, as \nParmenides foretold, but both forms and dialectic seem to have \ndeveloped apace since the Phaedo and the Republic.","contact.mail":"Mary_Louise_Gill@brown.edu","contact.domain":"brown.edu"}]
