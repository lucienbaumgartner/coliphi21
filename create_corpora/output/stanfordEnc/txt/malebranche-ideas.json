The theological motivation for this doctrine is clear: Vision\nin God places us in immediate contact with God in our everyday\nexperience of the world and in some of our most private thoughts and\nmusings. Like his other signature doctrine,\n‘Occasionalism’ or the view that God is the only genuine\ncause, Vision in God is also rooted in Malebranche’s conviction that\nwe utterly depend on God in every way.\n\n\n\nAlthough Malebranche was widely revered by his contemporaries as one\nof their leading lights — an equal to Descartes, Locke, and\nLeibniz — the theological spirit of his philosophy tarnished his\nreputation among Anglo-American philosophers in the last\ncentury. Scholarship over the past thirty-five years, however, has\nbegun to restore his credentials as a philosopher of first rank by\nunveiling the philosophical motivations for his doctrines, and by\nstressing his ingenuity in solving problems bequeathed to him by his\ntwo great philosophical forebears, Augustine and Descartes. Both of\nthese virtues are manifest in the doctrine of Vision in God.\n\n\n\nThe doctrine of Vision in God is easily misunderstood. It is not the\nview that we see God’s essence — that vision in God is vision\nof God — though Malebranche’s chief critic, the\nCartesian Antoine Arnauld, charged that it was. It is also not the\nview that corporeal objects, such as olive trees and Old English\nsheepdogs, reside in God, or that God himself is corporeal. The former\nwould make Malebranche an idealist or an immaterialist, the latter a\nSpinozist, but he rejects all such epithets. \n\nTo appreciate Malebranche’s epistemological theory, one must remember\nthat he was an orthodox Cartesian dualist and an orthodox\nChristian. Like Descartes, he maintained that there are two kinds of\ncreated substance — minds and bodies — and that the\nessence of bodies is extension (or spatial dimension). God, in turn,\nis an infinite, all-perfect, spiritual being. On this traditional\nChristian conception, it would be heresy to identify God with his\ncreatures, to suppose that God was extended, or to pretend to fathom\nGod’s essence. Concerning the latter, Malebranche stressed that we\ndon’t see God as he is in himself, for God’s essence is perfectly\nsimple, and by his grace we see only the diversity of particular\nbeings.  God’s simplicity also entails that he is not extended: \n\nGod’s essence is his own absolute being, and minds do not see the\ndivine substance taken absolutely but only as relative to creatures\nand to the degree that they can participate in it. What they see in\nGod is very imperfect, whereas God is most perfect. They see matter\nthat is shaped, divisible, and so on, but there is nothing divisible\nor shaped in God, for God is all being, since he is infinite and\ncomprehends everything; but he is no being in particular. Yet what we\nsee is but one or more particular beings, and we do not understand\nthis perfect simplicity of God, which includes all beings\n(Search 3.2.6, OC 1:439; LO 231). \n\nHere Malebranche underscores another feature of God: the divine\nsubstance is not any particular being but ‘all being’ or\nwhat he elsewhere calls ‘being in general.’ We can see\nmaterial beings in God precisely because he is indeterminate; in\nseeing creatures we are seeing how they determinately\n‘participate in’ or ‘imitate’ his\nperfections. \n\nIn conceiving God as ‘being in general’ Malebranche\nborrows much from the thirteenth-century scholastic thinker St. Thomas\nAquinas. Aquinas also conceives God as simple and indeterminate, and\nthinks it follows from this that we, with our finite minds, cannot\nfathom God’s essence, and so must know him through his\neffects. Malebranche qualifies this last point somewhat by saying that\nwe know God through his possible (material) effects, that is,\nrelative to what he can produce. Indeed, Malebranche holds\nthat in God we see an infinity of possible worlds: \n\nWhen you contemplate…extension, you still see only the\narchetype both of the material world in which we live, and of an\ninfinity of other possible worlds. You are then actually seeing the\ndivine substance, for that alone is visible or capable of enlightening\nthe mind. But you do not see it in itself or as it really is. You see\nit only in its relation to material creatures, only as it is\nparticipable by or representative of them.  Consequently, it is not\nstrictly speaking God whom you see, but only the matter he can produce\n(Dialogue 2, OC 12:51; JS 21). \n\nAs we have seen, there are no particular beings in God, for God is\nsimple and general. But still Malebranche will insist that we\nsee material objects in God. How is this possible?  The\nanswer to this question involves another aspect of his doctrine not\nyet broached — the theory of ideas. Malebranche defends a\nrepresentational theory of ideas, which holds that we don’t see\nmaterial objects directly but only via the ideas that represent\nthem. On his version of this theory, material objects are\nunintelligible in themselves and can be known only via something\nspiritual and immediately present to the mind.  Malebranche was not\nalone in the seventeenth-century in endorsing representationalism; in\nfact, it is often thought that he inherited this position from\nDescartes. Where they clearly differ is in the ontological status they\naccord to ideas. Descartes develops a ‘Christianized’\nversion of the Platonic theory of innate ideas, according to which\nideas are created with us at birth and constitute the very structure\nof our mind. Malebranche, in contrast, vehemently denies that ideas\nare created or that they are modifications of finite minds, and\ninstead regards them as eternal, necessary, and immutable realities\nthat reside in God. To say, then, that we perceive material things in\nGod means that we immediately perceive ideas in God, and via these\nideas, we indirectly perceive corporeal objects. Ideas in God\nare the ‘archetypes’ or models that he uses to create\nthings. Thus, we can be assured that our knowledge of material things\nis of the highest order.  \n\nAs already noted, Malebranche restricts the doctrine of Vision in God\nto our sensory perception of material objects and their properties and\nto the abstract thought of mathematical essences. It does not\nencompass knowledge of God’s essence, for as we have seen he thinks we\nknow God only indirectly, by way of the material things that he can\ncreate. But what about our knowledge of other things, especially the\nself or the mind, or other minds?  Why is that sort of knowledge\nexcluded from the doctrine, especially since as a faithful Cartesian\ndualist he maintains that there are both bodies and minds?\n \n\nGiven his theory of divine archetypes for creation, Malebranche must\nallow that there is an idea of the mind in God, but he does not think\nGod gives us access to this idea. We lack, therefore, what Descartes\nwould call a clear and distinct idea of the mind. And since ideas for\nMalebranche are the essences or natures of things, he denies that we\nhave knowledge of the mind’s essence. To be sure, he endorses\nDescartes’ cogito, or the claim that one knows one’s own\nexistence. But here Malebranche distinguishes two kinds of knowledge\n— knowledge through ideas as afforded by Vision in God and\nknowledge through consciousness — the latter being inferior. I\nhave knowledge through consciousness of the existence of my mind and\nits modifications, which is just to say that I know them by an inner\nawareness (sentiment intérieur) that attends all of my\nthoughts, beliefs, sensations, passions, etc. But this awareness is\nlimited to their bare existence and fails to reveal their underlying\nnature. Indeed, although sensations and other such modifications of\nthe mind are typically strong and lively in their affects, they are\n‘confused modalities…full of darkness’ (Dialogue 3,\nOC 12:65; JS 33). Malebranche’s negative view of knowledge of the mind\nis the natural complement to his theory of Vision in God. Following\nAugustine, Malebranche often stresses that the human mind is not a\nlight unto itself, and that God (or what he sometimes calls\n‘universal Reason’) is the only true light, that is, the\nonly source of truth and knowledge: ‘Man is not a light unto\nhimself.  His substance, far from enlightening him, is itself\nunintelligible to him. He knows nothing except by the light of\nuniversal Reason which enlightens all minds, by the intelligible ideas\nwhich it discloses to them in its entirely luminous substance’\n(Dialogue 3, OC 12:64; JS 32). The human mind is so utterly devoid of\ncognitive resources, and thus so completely dependent on God, that it\ncannot even know its own nature. \n\nMalebranche thinks that knowledge of other minds is even more\nimpoverished (if this seems possible), for here we must rely on\nconjecture. Other minds are not immediately present to us in the way\nthat our own mind and its modifications are, and so they cannot even\nbe known by consciousness. Instead, we must conjecture, on the basis\nof our sensory perception of the behavior of bodies similar to our\nown, that they are united to minds and that these minds are affected\nwith the same sorts of sensations and passions as ours.  Such\nknowledge, however, is ‘very liable to error’\n(Search 3.2.7, OC 1:455; LO 239). One might wonder why\nMalebranche calls this ‘knowledge’ at all, and not\n‘opinion’ or ‘belief,’ in keeping with the\nphilosophical tradition. The simple answer is that he is using the\nterm broadly here to refer to ‘ways of perceiving things,’\nwhere by ‘things’ he means all the various substances that\nexist — God, bodies, the self, and other minds.   \n\nIn the last section, we learned that there are no particular things in\nGod, but what about particular ideas?  Malebranche sometimes\nwrites as if there are, and one commentator has argued that he was\ncommitted to such a view in the first edition of the Search\n(Gueroult 1955–9, vol. 1, 63f). This has since been disputed (see\nSchmaltz 2000, 72 and other references in note 39), but whatever the\ncase, Malebranche tends in later editions of the Search and\nin his later writings generally to treat ideas as general and\nabstract. This is true both of the various geometrical ideas that we\nsee in God and of the idea of extension: ‘when I said that we\nsee different bodies through the knowledge we have of God’s\nperfections that represent them, I did not exactly mean that there are\nin God certain particular ideas that represent each body\nindividually…’ (Elucidation 10, OC:154; LO\n627). Beginning with the Elucidations, Malebranche employs\nthe term ‘intelligible extension’ to denote the general\nidea of extension, and to distinguish it from actual extension, which\nagain is unintelligible in itself. In addition to being\ngeneral, ideas in God are also ‘pure’ in the sense that\nthey are non-sensuous. Intelligible extension, then, is\njust the idea of geometrical extension and its properties, or what in\nthe seventeenth-century came to be known as the ‘primary\nqualities.’ Malebranche reduces these to two — figure\n(i.e., size and shape) and motion.  \n\nThese two characteristic features of ideas raise the following\nquestions: \n\nIf intelligible extension is pure, then how can it represent\nsensible objects?  Following Descartes, Malebranche wanted to\nhighlight the intellectual character of sense perception, but has he\ndone so at the expense of its sensory component? \n\nSupposing that intelligible extension does represent sensible objects\nhow, as a general idea, can it represent particular\nobjects? \n\nTo answer these questions we must first uncover an important\ndistinction that Malebranche draws between ideas on the one hand and\nsensations on the other. As we have already discovered, ideas are in\nGod and are cosubstantial with his substance. Sensations of colors,\nsounds, odors, heat, pleasure, etc., on the other hand, are\nmodifications of finite minds. Another important difference is that\nideas are intrinsically representational, whereas sensations are\nnot. The idea of a pyramid, for example, represents an actual pyramid\nin the sense that it resembles it, but the sensation of pain that one\nexperience’s when, say, accidentally lacerating one’s arm, in no way\nresembles the wounded tissue. Ideas and sensations, then, are very\ndifferent kinds of entities, but Malebranche maintains that sense\nperception combines elements of each. \n\nWhen we perceive something sensible, two things are found in our\nperception: sensation and pure idea. The sensation\nis a modification of our soul, and it is God who causes it in us. As\nfor the idea found in conjunction with the sensation, it is in God,\nand we see it because it pleases God to reveal it to us\n(Search 3.2.6, OC 1:445; LO 234). \n\nThe composite character of sense perception provides answers to both\nof our questions. Malebranche explains: \n\nintelligible extension becomes visible and represents a certain body\nin particular only by means of color, because it is only by the\nvariety of colors that we judge the difference between the objects we\nsee…. [A]s the sensations of color are essentially different,\nby means of them we judge the variety of bodies. If I distinguish your\nhand from your coat and both from the air surrounding them, this is\nbecause the sensations of light or color that I have of them are very\ndifferent (Dialogue 1, OC 12:46–7; JS 17). \n\nwe see or sense a given body when its ideas, i.e., when some figure\ncomposed of intelligible and general extension, becomes sensible and\nparticular through color or some other sensible perception by which\nits idea affects the soul and that the soul ascribes to it, for the\nsoul almost always projects its sensations on an idea that strikes it\nin lively fashion (Elucidation 10, OC 3:152; LO 626). \n\nIn sense perception the mind ‘projects’ its sensations\nonto intelligible extension, or some determinate part of it, thereby\nrendering sensible what is otherwise abstract and general. It was a\ncommon view in the seventeenth century that sensations of color and\nlight, in particular, also serve another function in sense perception:\nthey enable us to discriminate shapes and, correlatively, individual\nbodies. As illusionists of the age were well aware, one can make a\nwoman appear headless if her head is covered with something that\nblends into the background (such as a black hood against a black\ncurtain) and she is dressed in clothing that is color-contrasting. In\nthese passages, Malebranche applies this general point to explain how\nthe sensations of color and light individuate intelligible extension\nand thereby yield sensory perceptions of particular\nobjects. Sensations both ‘sensualize’ and\n‘particularize’ intelligible extension, and thus make it\npossible for us to see particular sensible objects in it.  \n\nIn characterizing the relation between ideas and sensations here,\nMalebranche relies partially on metaphors. He speaks of\n‘projecting’ our sensations onto ideas and elsewhere he\ncompares intelligible extension to a canvas onto which sensations are\n‘painted’ (OC 6:78). Some commentators have attempted to\nunpack these metaphors and to offer a more specific account of the\nrelation between ideas and sensations in sense perception. They\nattribute an ‘adverbial theory’ of sensation to\nMalebranche. Since sensations are nonrepresentational, they do not\nconstitute an extra object of perception over and above the general\nidea of extension and the material objects they represent. In other\nwords, we do not perceive sensations; we directly perceive ideas and\nvia these ideas we indirectly perceive corporeal objects.  Given this\naccount of the intentionality of perception, sensations are best\nunderstood adverbially, that is, as a way of perceiving\nobjects in the world. For example, when observing the setting sun, it\nwould be most accurate to say not that one senses ‘red,’\nbut that one senses redly (see Jolley 2000, 37f; Nadler 1992, 64; Pyle\n2003, 57, 63–5 and Radner 1978, 89). However, more recent discussions\nhave cast serious doubts on whether Malebranche could be committed to\nan adverbial theory of sense perception, for a variety of different\nreasons (see Nolan 2012, Ott 2014, and Simmons 2009). \n\nIn addition to the roles already discussed, sensations play one other\nimportant function in Malebranche’s epistemology. They provide a kind\nof ‘natural revelation’ of the existence of bodies. It is\nimportant to remember here that the idea of extension in God does not\nreveal anything about the existence of bodies, only their\nessence. Speaking once again of the composite character of sense\nperception, he writes: ‘There is always a clear idea and a\nconfused sensation in the view we have of sensible objects.  The idea\nrepresents their essence, and the sensation informs us of their\nexistence’ (Dialogue 5, OC 12:113; JS 74). More strongly,\nsensations ‘make us judge’ that there is an object in the\nworld corresponding to our perception (Elucidation 10, OC 3:143; LO\n621). ‘God joins the sensation to the idea when objects are\npresent so that we may believe them to be present….’\n(Search, 6.2.6, OC 3:152; LO 234).  \n\nAlthough sensations provide a ‘strong propensity’ to\nbelieve in the existence of bodies, they do not provide conclusive\nproof or even evidence of their existence, for the senses often\ndeceive us (Elucidation 6, OC 3:55f; LO 569f).  Malebranche notes, for\nexample, that ‘our eyes represent colors to us on the surface of\nbodies and…our ears make us hear sounds as if spread out\nthrough the air and in the resounding bodies; and if we believe what\nthe senses report, heat will be in fire, sweetness will be in sugar,\nmusk will have an odor….’ (ibid., OC 3:55–6; LO\n569). Like many of the mechanical philosophers in the seventeenth\ncentury, Malebranche holds that so-called sensible qualities (colors,\nsounds, odors, heat and cold, etc.) are not in bodies — which\nagain are to be conceived in terms of geometrical extension alone\n— but are modifications of the mind. However, his point in the\npassage cited is that the senses deceptively entice us to attribute\nthem to bodies. If they deceive us in this way, then it is at least\npossible that they also sometimes deceive about the existence of\nbodies.  \n\nIf the senses do not provide absolute certainty about the existence of\nbodies, one might wonder why God uses them at all for this purpose,\nespecially since Malebranche also contends ‘faith obliges us to\nbelieve that there are bodies’ (ibid., OC 3:62; LO 573). Why\nthen don’t the revelations of Scripture suffice?  Why do we need the\n‘natural revelations’ of sense?  The answer is that like\nmost Cartesians, Malebranche holds that the main purpose of the senses\nis to aid and preserve one’s mind-body union. If a lion is chasing me\nor if I am in danger of being consumed by a raging fire, I do not need\nto be absolutely certain that the lion or the fire exists in order to\nknow that it is in my best interests to flee. So whereas faith obliges\nme to believe in the existence of bodies generally, sensations inform\nme of the existence of those particular bodies, such as my own body\nand those in its vicinity, which may affect it positively or\nnegatively. \n\nMalebranche’s philosophy generally owes much to the thought of\nDescartes and Augustine. This is particularly true in the case of\nVision in God, which bears a striking resemblance to Augustine’s\ntheory of divine illumination, but which is also informed by Cartesian\nviews about the role of ideas in cognition and the intellectual\ncharacter of sensory perception.  One way of gaining insight into the\ndoctrine of Vision in God then is by regarding it as a synthesis of\nDescartes and Augustine’s philosophies of cognition. By integrating\ntheir views, and using each as a corrective to the other, Malebranche\nproduces a new doctrine that attempts to preserve and extend their\nphilosophical insights while avoiding their limitations and\nproblems.  \n\nLet us pursue this inroad into Malebranche’s theory of cognition,\nbeginning with his Cartesian inheritance.  Descartes is often read as\nholding a representative theory of perception, according to which our\nperception of material objects is mediated by ideas. Ideas are the\nimmediate objects of perception and, via these ideas, we are able to\nperceive bodies in the world.  He encourages such a reading in the\nThird Meditation, where he famously says that all ideas are ‘as\nit were the images of things’ (CSM 2:25, AT 7:37). Descartes\nexplicitly denies that ideas are mental images; however, he\nsuggests here that they are like images in the sense that\nthey represent objects in the world. \n\nWhy would someone hold such a view, especially as it seems to violate\ncommonsense?  In cases where I am looking directly at an object that\nis before me, such as a tree, I am inclined to think that what I\nperceive directly is the tree itself, not some ideational proxy for\nthe tree. Proponents of the representative theory, however, are often\nmotivated by cases of non-veridical perception. In endorsing this\ntheory himself, Malebranche is no exception. When I hallucinate a pink\nelephant nothing in the world corresponds to my perception;\nnevertheless, my perception has an intentional character, i.e., it is\n‘of’ or ‘about’ some object. Indeed,\nMalebranche maintains that all thought takes an object, on the grounds\nthat ‘To see nothing is not to see; to think of nothing is not\nto think’ (OCM 2:99, LO:320). Call this ‘the principle of\nintentionality.’ If, in hallucinating the pink elephant, there\nwere not some object of my hallucination I would not be having a\nperception at all. Ideas are introduced as a way of explaining how my\nperception can be intentional even in such cases. Absent a material\nthing, there must be some immaterial surrogate — call it an\n‘idea’ — toward which my perception is immediately\ndirected.  \n\nHaving established this result in the case of hallucinations, dreams,\nsensory illusions, etc., the representationalist must find a ground\nfor extending this conclusion to veridical perception. For in\nveridical perception the principle of intentionality could be\npreserved without appealing to ideas. One could say that the immediate\nobject of my perception is some material thing in the\nworld. Malebranche eliminates this possibility by appealing to the\nprinciple that all the immediate objects of perception must be of the\nsame ontological kind. One set of perceptions cannot have ideas as\ntheir objects, while another set of perceptions is directed toward\nmaterial things. If non-veridical perceptions derive their intentional\ncharacter from being directed toward ideas, then so must all\nperceptions; otherwise this principle would be violated (see Nadler\n1992, 83). \n\nThe Argument from Properties: Establishing the representative\ntheory of perception is just one part of Malebranche’s task in\ndefending the doctrine of Vision in God. Having argued that ideas are\nthe immediate objects of perception and thought, he must now deal with\na further question: ‘where’ are ideas?  What is their\nlocus?  Malebranche’s answer of course is that ideas reside in God,\nbut in affirming this claim he is making his first important break\nwith Descartes. It is fair to say that this is one place where\nMalebranche sees himself as correcting Descartes and using Augustine\nto do so. Descartes had taught that ideas are modifications of human\nminds. Indeed, Descartes would say that the ideas that figure most\nprominently in Malebranche’s doctrine — viz. the idea\nof extension and the ideas of various mathematical objects — are\ninnate, part of the very structure of the mind bestowed upon us by\nGod.  This means that Cartesian ideas are 1) finite mental items and\n2) created. Malebranche rejects both of these claims but, ironically,\nhe does so on grounds that appear to be at least partially inspired by\nDescartes’ own writings. \n\nIn the Third Meditation, Descartes stresses that insofar as they\nrepresent things to us, ideas are real beings, even if the objects\nthey represent do not exist outside thought. The\n‘representational reality’ of ideas falls short of the\nactual being of things in the world but, nevertheless, it is not\nnothing (AT 7:41, CSM 2:29). He reaffirms this point in the Fifth\nMeditation and adds that the ideas of various geometrical figures have\n‘immutable and eternal’ essences, as is clear from the\nfact that these ideas resist efforts by our mind to deform them. For\nexample, once I have recognized that having angles equal to two right\nangles is part of the content of the idea of triangle, I am compelled\nto recognize this property ‘whether I want to or not’ (AT\n7:64, CSM 2:45). In general, Descartes holds that so-called\n‘clear and distinct ideas’ are such that I cannot add\nanything to them or subtract anything from them (AT 7:51, 117–8; CSM\n2:35, 83–4).  Although he does not mention Descartes as his source,\nMalebranche develops these points in a way that leads to some very\nanti-Cartesian conclusions. He too wishes to stress that ideas are\nreal beings and that they resist our mind’s efforts to alter them: \n\nI am thinking of a number, of a circle, of a room, of your chairs, in\na word, of particular beings. I am also thinking of being or of the\ninfinite, of undetermined being. All these ideas have some reality\nwhile I think of them. You do not doubt this, because nothingness has\nno properties and they do. (Dialogue 1, OC 12:37; JS:10) \n\nYou believe this floor exists because you feel it resist\nyou….But do you think your ideas do not resist you?  Find me\nthen two unequal diameters in a circle, or three equal ones in an\nellipse. Find me the square root of eight and the cube root of\nnine….[M]ake two feet of intelligible extension equal no more\nthan one. Certainly the nature of this extension cannot countenance\nthat. It resists your mind. Do not, therefore, doubt its reality\n(ibid., OC 12:41–2; JS:13–14). \n\nSo far, Malebranche has not said anything with which Descartes would\ndisagree: the fact that ideas have properties and resist our thought\ndemonstrates their reality. But Descartes also speaks of ideas as\n‘immutable and eternal.’ Malebranche concurs with this as\nwell, and adds that they are ‘necessary,’\n‘universal,’ and ‘infinite’. The idea of\nextension, for example, is ‘necessary, eternal, immutable, and\ncommon to all minds….’ (ibid., OC 12:42; JS:14) To say\nthat ideas are ‘necessary’ just means that ‘it is\nimpossible that they should not be as they are,’ and this is\nsomething that Malebranche thinks is discoverable in thought\n(Elucidation 10, OC 3:130; LO 614). Ideas are infinite in the sense\nthat they are ‘inexhaustible.’ One can discover in the\nidea of extension, for example, ‘infinite numbers of\nintelligible triangles, tetragons, pentagons, and other such\nfigures,’ as well as an infinite number of truths that can be\ndemonstrated of them (ibid.). The ideas of extension and the various\ngeometrical figures are also immutable (or unchanging) and eternal in\nthe sense that they did not come into being, and will not go out of\nbeing. And although cultural norms and tastes may vary among cultures,\nraces, and periods, the truths of mathematics are universal and common\nto all intelligences in the sense that all minds will, upon\nreflection, discover the same ones. Such truths are not the product of\nagreement but are intellectual givens that impose themselves on our\nthought. \n\nFrom the claim that ideas are necessary, eternal, immutable, etc.,\nMalebranche draws his first and most important anti-Cartesian\nconclusion, namely, that ideas must reside in God and be\n‘coeternal and consubstantial with Him’ (Elucidation 10,\nOC 3:131; LO 614). Indeed, since Descartes affirms some or all of\nthese properties himself, consistency would seem to require that he\nabandon his view that ideas are created modes of finite minds. If\nideas are necessary and eternal then they cannot be created, as\ncreated things are contingent and have a beginning. Ideas also cannot\nbe modes of the soul, for ‘it is clear that the soul’s modes are\nchangeable but ideas are immutable; that its modes are particular, but\nideas are universal and general to all intelligences; that its modes\nare contingent, but ideas are eternal and necessary….’\n(Search, OC 2:103; LO 322–3). Malebranche expresses his\npositive conclusion at times by referring to God once again as\n‘universal Reason’ or the intelligible realm of ideas:\n \n\nAlthough he appears to draw these results from tensions within\nDescartes’ theory of ideas, Malebranche finds additional support and\ninspiration for the doctrine of Vision in God in Augustine’s theory of\ndivine illumination.  Indeed, it is often said that Vision in God\ncombines Descartes’ representationalism with an Augustinian or\nNeoplatonic ontology of ideas. The exact degree to which Augustine\ndirectly influenced Malebranche here, however, is difficult to gauge\nand one commentator has argued that the influence was minimal at most\n(See Connell 1967). That having been said, Malebranche often writes as\nif the lineage was direct and tends to minimize his philosophical\ndifferences with Augustine over the nature of cognition: \n\nDespite what he regards as general agreement, Malebranche\ndifferentiates his view from Augustine’s in two ways. First, whereas\nAugustine spoke of seeing ‘truths’ in God, Malebranche\nspeaks primarily of (immediately) seeing ‘ideas.’ This\nminor difference stems from Malebranche’s tendency to privilege ideas\nand to understand truth in terms of them. Truth is but a relation\namong ideas, though on his scheme relations need not be anything real,\nover and above ideas, for in perceiving any two ideas we can also\ngrasp the relations between them.  \n\nMalebranche speaks rather baldly here. He seems to deny truths any\nreality whatsoever, but what he really wants is something\nweaker. Elsewhere he draws a distinction between real relations like\ntruth and imaginary relations such as falsehood. He denies reality\nonly to the latter, and wants to reduce real relations to ideas\n(Search 6.1.5, OC 2:286; LO 433). Thus, the difference\nbetween Augustine and Malebranche on whether we directly perceive\ntruths or ideas in God may be only nominal, for Malebranche is not\ndenying the reality of truths but merely reducing them to ideas.  \n\nSecond, and more significantly, Malebranche self-consciously extends\nAugustine’s theory of divine illumination to material things. Where\nAugustine limited his account to the intellectual apprehension of\ntruths that are eternal and necessary, Malebranche conceives Vision in\nGod as an all-encompassing theory of cognition that includes the\nsensory perception of sensible objects in the world. Malebranche\nbelieves that Augustine was prevented from seeing how the theory of\nillumination could be extended in this way as a result of two\nphilosophical prejudices. First, he maintained that we see bodies\ndirectly, without the aid of ideas. Second, like most philosophers\nprior to the scientific revolution he thought that colors, sounds,\npains, heat, and other sensory qualities are in bodies. But of course\nthese qualities change. If these two prejudices are combined, as\nMalebranche believed they were in Augustine’s thinking, then to say\nthat we see material things in God would mean that God contains\nobjects that are changeable and corruptible. But this violates God’s\nimmutability. Malebranche, however, thinks he has the resources for\navoiding this result: \n\nMalebranche is able to extend the scope of Augustine’s theory of\nillumination as a result of what were then two recent philosophical\ndevelopments, courtesy of Descartes. First, the representational\ntheory of ideas allowed Malebranche to say that what we see directly\nin God are not changeable objects but ideas or essences. In the case\nof material things we see intelligible extension, which is immutable\nand incorruptible, in keeping with the divine nature. Second,\nMalebranche took from Descartes the view that colors and the other\nso-called ‘secondary qualities’ are not qualities of\nbodies but sensations or modifications of the mind (whether Descartes\nactually held this position himself is controversial).  Since bodies\ndo not have these qualities, the idea of extension need not represent\nthem, and once again God is spared from having to accommodate\nchangeable entities. It is interesting to note here that by reducing\nsecondary qualities to sensations, Malebranche can also explain the\nvariations we see in the primary qualities of extension. Even if\nbodies are not colored, they still change their size, shape, motion,\nand position. How can intelligible extension represent those\nvariations without violating God’s immutability?  The answer is that\nit need not, for as we have already discussed, color and light\nsensations ‘particularize’ extension and enable the mind\nto discriminate shapes and, correlatively, all the other primary\nqualities — sizes, positions, motions, etc.  Sensations, then,\nare responsible for all the variations we see in material\nobjects.  \n\nIn the previous section, we examined Malebranche’s most mature\nargument for locating ideas in God in the Argument from\nProperties. This argument, which first appeared in Elucidations of\nThe Search After Truth, highlights the Neoplatonic and\nAugustinian character of Malebranchean ideas and reveals his efforts\nto correct Descartes.  When coupled with the Cartesian view that all\nperception is representational, it provides one of Malebranche’s\nstrongest supports for Vision in God.  \n\nWhen first introducing the doctrine of Vision in God in the\nSearch, however, he takes a different tack. There he presents\na negative, or eliminative, argument in which he enumerates five\ncompeting theories of how material objects are known, and then\nsystematically eliminates each one until only Vision in God\nremains. For such an argument to succeed, one must ensure that the\nenumeration is complete — that it exhausts all possible\ntheories. Malebranche clearly thinks that he satisfies this\nrequirement, though critics from John Locke onwards have complained\nthat it does not. Some recent commentators have attempted to show why\nMalebranche’s enumeration is, indeed, complete or at least why he\nthinks it is (Connell 1967, 162; Nadler 1992, 138–140). \n\nBut rather than pursue that line of thought, we might note something\nelse about Malebranche’s strategy: he does not rest content with the\nstandard structure of an eliminative argument. After raising doubts\nabout the four other theories, he marshals various positive arguments\nin support of vision in God.  One might think that Malebranche is\nsimply making as strong a case as possible for his preferred theory\nor, since he has these other arguments ready to hand, displaying them\nfor his readers’ edification. But when his positive arguments are\nexamined carefully, one finds that many of the same reasons are used\nto cast doubt upon the rival theories. It would appear that as much as\ntrying to convince the reader of Vision in God, the Argument from\nElimination lays the groundwork for that doctrine by prefiguring the\npositive reasons in favor of it or, to put it somewhat differently, by\nrevealing what is required for us to have knowledge of material\nobjects. Malebranche holds that once one appreciates the requirements\nor preconditions for knowledge, she will be forced to conclude that\nonly Vision in God satisfies all of them. Thus, behind the surface of\nMalebranche’s eliminative argument lies a deeper, more positive\napproach. Given this understanding of Malebranche’s strategy, and in\nthe interests of brevity, we shall focus here on the positive\narguments that he adduces in favor of Vision in God. \n\nMalebranche’s arguments appeal primarily (but not exclusively) to\nfacts about the divine nature and about the relation between God\n— the infinite substance — and his finite creation. This\nreflects the theological spirit of Malebranche’s philosophy generally,\nbut it is also a common strategy of the modern rationalists (most\nnotably, Descartes, Spinoza, Malebranche, and Leibniz) to derive\nconclusions about finite beings from considerations about infinite\nbeing. Malebranche identifies five main reasons in support of the\nclaim that ‘we see all things in God.’ Before developing\nthese reasons, however, he reminds the reader of two other\nconsiderations, introduced previously, that provide a prima facie case\nin favor of Vision in God. First, there must be ideas of all created\nbeings in God, for otherwise he would not have been able to\ncreate. The view that ‘blind creation’ is impossible is\npart of Malebranche’s Augustinian heritage, and relies on the\nintuition that in order to create something one must have models or\narchetypes of what one is going to create. Ideas, then, serve as these\narchetypes, but they must be in God himself prior to creation for\notherwise there would something external to God constraining what he\ncould create, which would violate his omnipotence or supreme\npower. God can have the ideas of all things within him because he\ncontains an infinite number of perfections and, as discussed in\nsection 2, he sees all possible beings by considering how his\nperfections can be imitated in finite ways. There is a deeper\nintuition here as well, and that is that if God is truly wise or\nomniscient then creation must be an intelligible and rational process\nwhereby God acts in accordance with certain standards. Malebranche\nrejects Descartes’ doctrine that the created universe is an arbitrary\nproduct of God’s indifferent will.  Ideas in God, then, constitute\nthese eternal and immutable standards.  \n\nSecond, Malebranche holds that created minds enjoy an intimate union\nwith God even in this life, as a result of our complete and utter\ndependence on the creator. As a result of this union, God is always\n‘present’ to our mind.  Speaking metaphorically,\nMalebranche says that God is, in a sense, the ‘place’ of\nminds as space is the place of bodies. On the basis of these two\nconsiderations, Malebranche concludes that God could, if he saw fit,\ncause finite minds to see all things in him: ‘the mind surely\ncan see what in God represents created beings, since what in God\nrepresents created beings is very spiritual, intelligible, and present\nto the mind. Thus, the mind can see God’s works in Him, provided that\nGod wills to reveal to it what in Him represents them’\n(Search 3.2.6, OC 1:437; LO 230). Since the ideas of all\nthings are already in God and our minds enjoy an intimate\nunion with him at all times, it is easy to see how God could make us\nsee all things in him. But, again, Malebranche does not intend these\nconsiderations to be decisive, only to show how Vision in God is\npossible and ‘conforms to reason’ (ibid., OC 1:438; LO\n230). The introduction of these considerations is primarily strategic,\nfor he then proceeds to develop and reinforce them in his five main\narguments, to which we now turn: The Simplicity of the Divine Ways: Having already\nhighlighted the rational character of creation in the first\nconsideration, Malebranche begins this argument with another such\npoint that once again underscores God’s wisdom. God always creates in\nthe simplest of ways. This is a consequence not only of his\nsimplicity, but also of his wisdom and power.  God never does in very complicated fashion what can be done in a\nvery simple and straightforward way. For God never does anything\nuselessly and without reason. His power and wisdom are not shown by\ndoing lesser things with greater means — that is contrary to\nreason and indicates a limited intelligence. Rather, they are shown by\ndoing greater things with very simple and straightforward means\n(ibid.).  How is Vision in God simpler?  And simpler than what?  One of the\nalternative theories that he considers in the Argument from\nElimination is that God creates a complete set of innate ideas within\neach mind. But our mind is capable of thinking of an infinite number\nof figures, numbers, etc. Thus, if this alternative theory were true,\nit would mean God would have to create an infinite set of ideas for\nevery finite mind. But as God already contains within his\nunderstanding a complete set of ideas or archetypes for creation, it\nis far simpler for him to reveal them to us, to allow us to see all\nthings in him.   One should not underestimate the intended force of this\nargument. Malebranche is not conceding that God could have\nstocked every mind with a complete set of innate ideas but just\nhappened to act in accordance with his simplicity. One commentator has\nnoted that in the first four editions of the Search,\nMalebranche begins the argument by saying, ‘although it is not\nabsolutely denied that God can make an infinity of infinite numbers of\nentities representative of things with each mind he creates,\nnevertheless one ought not to believe that he does….’\nDaisie Radner concludes on the basis of this statement that the appeal\nto simplicity is ‘not considered even by Malebranche to be one\nof the stronger arguments for seeing all things in God,’ for it\ndoes not rule out the alternative view, absolutely speaking (1978,\n52). But this conclusion misunderstands the sentence above that\nMalebranche subsequently excised in later editions. To get a grip on\nwhat he means we must compare similar language, and a similar point\nabout divine simplicity, to which Malebranche appeals in his theodicy\n(i.e., his solution to the problem of evil). He attempts to justify the\nexistence of evil in the world by saying that although God wished to\ncreate the best of all possible worlds absolutely speaking, he was\nconstrained to act in such ways as honor his attributes or perfections\n— especially his simplicity: ‘His ways must bear the\ncharacter of His attributes, as well as His work. It is not enough\nthat His work honor Him by its excellence; it is necessary in addition\nthat His ways glorify Him by their Divinity’ (Dialogue 9, OC\n12:214; JS 163).  For Malebranche, God’s works and his ways (or means\nof creating) must honor him; he therefore strikes a balance between\nthe ‘beauty of the work’ and the ‘simplicity of his\nways’ (Dialogue 9, OC 12:215; JS 164). This is not the best of\nall possible worlds that God could create, absolutely speaking, but it\nis the best relative to the simplicity of his ways (Jolley 2004). In\nmaking this point, Malebranche is not claiming that God could have\nmade a better world, for that would require violating his\nsimplicity. On the supposition that he is going to create anything,\nGod must act so as to honor his perfections; otherwise he would not be\nan all-perfect being, which is impossible. The same point applies to\nMalebranche’s epistemology; here too divine simplicity constitutes a\nside constraint on God’s actions, such that there is no genuine sense\nin which he could have created each mind with a complete set of\nideas. Divine simplicity demands Vision in God.   Dependence: It is a mark of Christian philosophy generally\nto stress the dependence of created beings on God. This emphasis\nmanifests itself primarily in the traditional doctrine of divine\nconcurrence, according to which God not only creates but also\ncontinually conserves finite minds and bodies in their existence.  But\nMalebranche thinks this doctrine has an air of mystery to it, and\nfails to capture the magnitude and character of our dependence:\n‘that general and confused term concourse, by means of\nwhich we would explain creatures’ dependence on God, rouses not a\nsingle distinct idea in an attentive mind’ (OC 1:440, LO 231). A\nproper conception of God entails that we depend on God in every way\npossible, not just ontologically but cognitively as well. Vision in\nGod is the only theory that does justice to the latter, for on this\naccount God not only causes us to see material objects but he is the\none in whom we see them: ‘He is truly the mind’s light and the\nfather of lights’ (ibid.). \n\nThe view that created beings depend completely on God informs\nMalebranche’s entire philosophy. Indeed, Malebranche acknowledges this\nat the end of the chapter we are discussing, where he returns to the\ntheme of dependence and invokes the words of St. Paul which he sees\nhis philosophy as vindicating: ‘In God we live, move, and have\nour being’ (Acts 17:28).  It is sometimes said that Vision in\nGod is the ‘epistemological correlate’ of Malebranche’s\nOccasionalism, according to which God is the only true cause\n(McCracken 1983, 66; Nadler 1992, 141; Pyle 2003, 56). Where\nOccasionalism stresses our dependence on God’s power, Vision in God\nunderscores our dependence on his wisdom. Without God, we are both\ncausally and cognitively impotent. Infinite Cognitive Capacity: In his first argument,\nMalebranche appealed to the fact that we are capable of thinking of an\ninfinite number of things, at least in principle, and this is obvious\nhe thinks from considerations of mathematical objects, which are\ninfinite in number. The question raised by the third argument —\nwhich Malebranche declares to be his ‘strongest’ —\nis how this infinite capacity is possible. He might have ended the\nargument here by concluding that we must see all things in God, for a\nfinite mind is incapable of containing an infinity of beings.\nInstead, he attempts to strengthen his case by observing a further\nwrinkle in the nature of cognition. Malebranche asserts that whenever\nwe desire to think of some particular object we must first survey all\nbeings and then focus on the object we wish to think about. If we did\nnot already have at least a general and confused apprehension of the\nobject we wished to consider, then we could not direct our attention\nto it. Malebranche takes this to be a datum of our experience, but the\nunderlying principle is of Platonic origin.  Plato famously argues in\nthe Meno that all knowledge is recollection, for it is\nimpossible to inquire about that of which one is ignorant. One must be\nat least dimly aware of all things one seeks to know, and thus\nlearning is more like remembering than discovering something entirely\nnew (cf. McCracken 1983, 66).  Augustine (On the\nTeacher10.33) had already adapted this argument for his own ends,\nand here Malebranche is following suit. \n\nSo each of us is capable of thinking of an infinite number of things\nand, more importantly, in thinking of any particular thing one must\ngrasp this infinity. It is at this point that Malebranche concludes\n(for the reason given above) that this infinity of beings must be in\nGod, and that it is only through our union with God that these beings\nare present to us in thought. How does God contain this infinity?  Not\nby literally being composed of an infinity of particular ideas, for\nagain God is perfectly simple. On Malebranche’s conception, God is\n‘being in general,’ ‘infinite being,’ or\n‘being without restriction’ (3.2.8, OC 1:456; LO 241). In\nhim, ‘all beings [are] contained in one’ precisely because\nhe is infinite and indeterminate. This point allows him to further\nclarify the nature of cognition: ‘not only does the mind have\nthe idea of the infinite, it even has it before that of the\nfinite…. In order for us to conceive of a finite being,\nsomething must necessarily be eliminated from this general notion of\nbeing, which consequently must come first’ (3.2.6, OC 1:441; LO\n232). Here Malebranche follows Descartes in affirming that the idea of\nthe infinite is conceptually prior to the idea of the finite, but then\nadds a twist that pushes him away from Descartes (and closer to\nSpinoza), namely that we conceive particular things by limiting or\nnegating the idea of the infinite. Causal Efficacy: In this argument, Malebranche begins by\nnoting that ideas are causally efficacious ‘since they act upon\nthe mind and enlighten it’ and ‘make it happy or unhappy\nthrough pleasant or unpleasant perceptions by which they affect\nit’ (3.2.6, OC 1:442; LO 232). To establish that these ideas are\nin God, he then invokes an Augustinian principle, namely that\n‘nothing can act immediately upon the mind unless it is superior\nto it.’ To make sense of this principle, one must envisage, as\nAugustine did, a hierarchy of being in which minds are higher than\nbodies and God constitutes the upper limit of moral perfection. For\nMalebranche, these are the only substances there are. So it follows\nthat only God can act on the soul and, insofar as they are\nefficacious, ideas must be the very substance of God. The Purpose of Creation: In his final argument,\nMalebranche appeals once again to creation, focusing this time on its\npurpose. He maintains that as an absolutely perfect being, God can act\nonly for his own glory. There is nothing that he lacks for which\ncreated beings somehow compensate. Thus, God created the universe so\nthat his works would reflect his perfections and, as much as possible,\nbe directed toward him. As conscious beings whose thoughts point\nbeyond themselves, minds are especially well suited to this purpose\nfor only they are capable of knowing his perfections. But don’t we\nknow other things besides God?  Yes, Malebranche will answer, but\ngiven God’s aim in creation we can know his works only if we also see\nhim to some extent (3.2.6, OC 1:442–3; LO 233). Vision in God\nsatisfies this requirement, for it affirms that we see all things in\nGod by way of ideas that are identical with his substance. \n\nMalebranche is a philosopher whose thought developed markedly over\ntime. In part this was due to his lively engagement with critics and\nhis attempts to respond to their objections, and also to his\nrecognition that his doctrines required further articulation than he\nhad provided in earlier writings. One of the most significant\ndevelopments to the theory of Vision in God was the view that ideas\nare causally efficacious. Malebranche had already argued that ideas\nhave properties — necessity, eternality, immutability,\nuniversality, etc. — but in response to an objection by his\nCartesian critic Pierre-Sylvain Régis, he came to ascribe\ncausal powers to them as well. This new theory is introduced in the\ncontext of the claim that the mind is united to God, even in this\nlife. It is because of this union, Malebranche maintains, that Vision\nin God is possible. We are always in immediate contact with being in\ngeneral and so can focus our attention on the idea of intelligible\nextension at any time or immediately perceive it in sense\nperception.  \n\nRégis was rightly curious about the nature of this union with\nGod. Malebranche had spoken metaphorically of the\n‘presence’ of God to the mind, but without ever specifying\nwhat he meant. Régis noted that this union cannot be understood\non the model of the union of one body with another, for that requires\nactual physical contact; nor should it be thought to resemble the\nmind’s union with the body, for that would make the mind and God\nmutually dependent on each other, and the infinite being depends on\nnothing. No, Régis argued, the only viable way to understand\nthe God-mind union is on the model of cause to effect, respectively.\nAt this point he uncovers an important objection that he had been\nanticipating: if mind-God union is to be understood causally, then it\nis still possible that we perceive bodies by means of ideas that are\nin us, but caused by bodies themselves, as Descartes himself had\ntaught(SG 1:188; also see Schmaltz 2000, 76–7). \n\nIn his response, Malebranche attempts to exploit Régis’\nsuggestion but without leaving the door open to Cartesianism. Lacking\ncausal efficacy and being ‘invisible’ in themselves,\nbodies cannot act directly on the mind in the way that Régis\nhad indicated. In virtue of being in God, however, the idea of\nextension can ‘affect’ or ‘touch’ the mind in\nvarious ways (OC 17–1, 282–3). In changes made to previously published\nworks, two years later (1695), Malebranche even more explicitly ties\nthe intelligibility of ideas to their causal efficacy (Robinet 1965,\n259, note 2). Readers are told for the first time that the reason\nideas are intelligible and bodies are not is because only the former\ncan act on the mind.  \n\nThe theory that ideas are efficacious becomes Malebranche’s mature\nposition, and to mark this development changes are made to later\neditions of the Search and to other writings. With the advent\nof this theory, it becomes easier to see the relation between Vision\nin God and Malebranche’s other main doctrine of Occasionalism, or the\nview that God is the only genuine cause. Indeed, one can regard Vision\nin God as a corollary to Occasionalism. As the only true cause, God\nproduces minds, bodies, and the various changes they endure. The\nmind’s nature is to think and to perceive, and God produces those\nmodifications via ideas, which are the instruments by which he\nenlightens us. \n\nMake no mistake about it, the theory of efficacious ideas marks a\nsignificant development in the doctrine of Vision in God. One\ncommentator aptly notes that Malebranche’s epistemology shifts from\nbeing a vision in God to a vision by God\n(Alquié 1974, 209). Ideas are no longer the direct objects of\nperception, passively awaiting our reflection upon them, but the\nactive agents of cognition.  Moreover, whereas on Malebranche’s\nearlier view ideas figured exclusively in the intellectual side of\nperception, on the new version of the doctrine they cause both our\nsensations and what he came to call our ‘pure perceptions’\n(perceptions pures).  Malebranche had been reluctant\npreviously to say that ideas are ‘sensible’ lest he\nattribute colors and other sensible qualities to God. But on the\nrevamped doctrine he can say that ideas are both sensible and\nintelligible insofar as they causally affect our mind in different\nways (Schmaltz 2000, 80).  ‘When the idea of extension affects\nor modifies the soul with a pure perception, then the soul conceives\nsimply this extension. But when the idea of extension touches the soul\nmore sharply, and affects it with a sense perception, then the soul\nsees, or senses extension’ (Christian Conversations3,\nOC 4:75–6). Thus, the theory of efficacious ideas enables Malebranche\nto offer a more unified theory of cognition. \n\nOne of the hallmarks of Descartes’ epistemological project is its\nobsession with refuting skepticism. Descartes begins his\nMeditations by entertaining the widest and most radical\ndoubts possible so that he can defeat them once and for all. Some\ncommentators have suggested that Malebranche’s doctrine of Vision in\nGod is also designed to refute skepticism, at least concerning our\nknowledge of the essence of material things, but in fact the relation\nof his epistemology to skepticism is more complex, and he is best read\nas aiming for something more modest. Although Malebranche is as\nobsessed as Descartes with finding the correct method for discovering\nthe truth, nothing like the Cartesian method of universal doubt can be\nfound in his writings. There is a very simple reason for this:\nMalebranche refuses to take seriously some of the more radical forms\nof skepticism. He never doubts that certain types of knowledge are\npossible. The task of the doctrine of Vision in God then is not to\nrefute skepticism, but to show how such knowledge is\npossible.  The problem with rival theories of cognition, especially\nDescartes’, is that they encourage skepticism and fail to account for\nthe knowledge we clearly have. \n\nAt times, Descartes seems to allow that there are some truths —\nsuch as the simple propositions of mathematics — that can never\nbe doubted, but in darker moods that carry the day he worries whether\nan omnipotent deceiver might beguile us even about these. Malebranche,\nhowever, is more impressed by Descartes’ first inclination.  That I\nexist, that I have various thoughts, and that twice two equals four\nare not subject to deception but are known by what Malebranche calls\n‘simple perception,’ by which the mind ‘perceives a\nsimple thing without any relation to anything else whatsoever’\n(Search 1.2, OC 1:49; LO 7). He opposes simple perception to\nreasoning or inference: whereas the former consists in a direct or\nimmediate grasp of something, reasoning constitutes an indirect\napprehension and involves more than one mental act (Schmaltz 1996,\n24). Because of the latter, reasoning requires the use of memory,\nwhich is subject to error and deception: \n\nFor when we reason, the memory acts; and where there is memory, there\ncan be error, should there be some evil genius on whom we depend in\nour knowledge who amuses himself by deceiving us… [But] I am\nquite persuaded that he could not deceive me in my knowledge through\nsimple perception…. For even if I should really suppose such a\nGod, a God as powerful as I can imagine, I feel that in this\nextravagant supposition I could not doubt that I am, or that twice two\nequals four, because I perceive these things through simple perception\nwithout the use of memory (Search 6.2.6, OC 2:370; LO\n480–1). \n\nMalebranche does not quite say here why he thinks things known through\nsimple perception are impervious to the omnipotent-deceiver doubt,\nthough his examples provide some indication. Descartes himself had\nsaid that even a malicious demon could not make him doubt his own\nexistence, at least while he is presently attending to this\nquestion. Such doubts are self-defeating: if the demon deceives\nme about anything then I must exist in order to be deceived. Rather\nthan offering an explanation of this kind, Malebranche is content here\nsimply to report on his own psychological response to the\n‘extravagant supposition’ of a deceiving God, which fails\nto instill doubts in him about such simple truths. This supposition,\nhowever, does cause him to doubt things that depend on inference and\nhere he is quite explicit that this is due to the fallibility of\nmemory. \n\nTo defeat doubts of the latter variety, Malebranche thinks, ‘It\nis…necessary to know by simple perception and not by inference\nthat God is not a deceiver, because reasoning can always be mistaken\nif we assume God to be a deceiver’ (ibid., OC 2:371; LO\n481). Malebranche is indicating here his own analysis of, and solution\nto, the infamous Cartesian Circle. As he sees it, the Circle results\nfrom ‘ordinary proofs of the existence and the perfections of\nGod’ that involve inferences and hence are subject to the very\ndoubts that their conclusions are designed to dispel. Since on his\nview, simple perceptions are not subject to doubts of this or any\nkind, the only way to defeat the omnipotent deceiver doubt is by\nestablishing that God exists and is perfectly benevolent from\n‘proofs’ by simple perception. The term\n‘proofs’ here may seem confusing, given Malebranche’s\ndistinction between simple perception and inference, but he uses it\nloosely to refer to his version of the ontological\n‘argument,’ where God’s existence is established directly\nfrom the idea of an infinite or supremely perfect being. Malebranche\nthinks that one of the virtues of the doctrine of Vision in God is\nthat it provides such a proof by simple perception. Recall from our\nearlier discussion in section 4 that Malebranche thinks we have an\ninfinite cognitive capacity; for example, we can think of any one of\nan infinite number of geometrical figures. A precondition for this\ncapacity, he maintains, is that we be in constant and immediate union\nwith the idea of being in general, which we then delimit in various\nways when thinking ‘square,’ ‘circle,’\netc. But the idea of being in general or the infinite can’t be in any\nfinite thing such as our mind. It can only be in God — more\nprecisely, it can only be God himself, for there can be only\none infinite or all-encompassing being: \n\nwe can only apprehend the infinite in the infinite itself…. For\nthe first principle of our knowledge is that nothingness is not\nperceptible, whence if follows that, if we think of the infinite, it\nmust exist. We also see that God is not a deceiver, because, knowing\nthat He is infinitely perfect and that the infinite cannot lack any\nperfection, we clearly see that He does not want to beguile\nus….’ (ibid., OC 2:372; LO 481–2). \n\nAlthough Malebranche sometimes refers to the ‘idea’ of\nGod, strictly speaking, ‘The infinite is its own idea’\n(Dialogue 2, OC 12:53; JS 23). And we can explain our infinite\ncognitive capacity only by our union with this infinite being, who\nmust therefore exist.  \n\nIn addition to thinking that there are some truths that are impervious\nto doubt, Malebranche also has a different understanding of Descartes’\nprinciple that whatever one clearly and distinctly is true. Descartes\nmaintains that when I clearly and distinctly perceive something my\nwill is causally compelled to affirm it. So, for example, if I\nunderstand the proposition that five is the sum of two added to three\nthen I will spontaneously affirm its truth. But as one commentator has\nnoted, Malebranche has a normative, rather than a causal-psychological\nconception, of clear and distinct perceptions (Lennon 2000). Reason\n‘obliges,’ rather than causally compels, my will to\nassent. Indeed, I can resist a clear and distinct perception, but only\nat the risk of ‘feeling an inward pain and the secret reproaches\nof reason’ (Search 1.2, OC 1:55; LO 10). This is\nsignificant because it explains why Malebranche refuses to take some\nforms of skepticism seriously: skepticism with respect to things\nperceived through clear and distinct perceptions is simply perverse,\nfor it violates norms to which reason demands adherence (Lennon 2000,\n19). \n\nSo far, we have seen that Malebranche is concerned to defeat some\nforms of skepticism and is contemptuous and dismissive of others.\nAlthough Vision in God plays a prominent role in defeating skepticism\nof the first variety, regarding inference, its more primary task is to\nexplain how knowledge is possible. This point is evident in some of\nthe demonstrations that Malebranche marshals in support of the\ndoctrine, which have the character of ‘transcendental\narguments.’ Transcendental arguments typically begin with some\nclaim about knowledge that is taken as given. The transcendental move\nthen involves showing that such knowledge is possible only if some\ncondition, or set of conditions, has been satisfied. We might view the\nArgument from Properties, discussed in section 3, as an example of\nsuch an argument. Malebranche argues that the condition for the\npossibility of knowledge of truths that are necessary, immutable, and\ncommon to all minds or intelligences is that we see all things in\nGod: \n\nNo one disagrees that all men can know the truth, and even the least\nenlightened of philosophers agree that man participates in a certain\nReason that they do not determine….I see, for example,\nthat twice two is four, and that my friend is to be valued more than\nmy dog; and I am certain that no one in the world does not see this as\nwell as I….There must, therefore, be a universal Reason that\nenlightens me and all other intelligences.  For if the reason I\nconsult were not the same that answers the Chinese, it is clear that I\ncould not be as certain as I am that the Chinese see the same truths\nas I do (Elucidation 10, OC 3:129; LO 613). \n\nMalebranche begins here by assuming that we have knowledge of\nmathematical and moral truths. The problem involves showing\nhow this knowledge is possible, and he resolves it by\nappealing to Vision in God. The Argument from Properties is not the\nonly demonstration in Malebranche’s arsenal that has a transcendental\nflavor. Indeed, one can view all of his positive arguments for Vision\nin God, including those discussed in section 4, as constituting an\nover-arching transcendental argument. Viewed in this way, each of the\nconsiderations that he puts forth are not so much separate arguments\nas they are separate conditions for the possibility of knowledge that\nonly Vision in God can jointly satisfy. \n\nMalebranche’s primary objection to other theories of cognition, then,\nis that they fail to satisfy these conditions and, in the case of\nDescartes’ theory in particular, encourage the skeptic’s claim that we\nlack knowledge. Descartes’ very conception of ideas as perceptions, or\nmodifications of finite minds, makes it impossible to guarantee that\nthey accurately represent their objects: \n\nFor if our ideas were only our perceptions, if our modes were\nrepresentative, how would we know that things correspond to our ideas,\nsince God does not think, and consequently does not act, according to\nour perceptions but according to His own; and therefore He did not\ncreate the world according to our perceptions but in accordance with\nHis ideas, on its eternal model that He finds in His essence\n(Search 4.11, OC 2:99; LO 320). \n\n[T]o maintain that ideas that are eternal, immutable, and common to\nall intelligences, are only perceptions or momentary particular\nmodifications of the mind, is to establish Pyrrhonism and to make room\nfor the belief that what is moral or immoral is not necessarily so,\nwhich is the most dangerous error of all (Elucidation 10, OC 3:140; LO\n620). \n\nAs discussed in section 3, Descartes insists that our ideas of\ngeometrical figures and the like are ‘eternal’ and\n‘immutable’ (and Malebranche takes him also to hold that\nthey are ‘common to all intelligences’), but Malebranche\nwonders here how this can be possible if they are merely fleeting\nmodes of finite minds. To identify ideas with such modes suggests that\nthey are merely subjective representations that vary among perceivers,\nand whose correspondence to reality can never be established. It thus\ninvites skepticism (or ‘Pyrrhonism,’ an ancient form of\nskepticism, though here the term just means radical or universal\nskepticism) regarding our knowledge of the essences of created\nthings.  \n\nAgain, the virtue of Vision in God is that rather than encouraging\nskepticism, it shows how knowledge is possible. If ideas are eternal\nand immutable realities in God that serve as his archetypes for\ncreation, then there is no problem about whether they conform to their\nobjects. On the contrary, created objects must conform to them:  \n\nIt is certain that things conform to the idea that God has of\nthem. For since God created them, He can only have made them according\nto the idea that He has of them. Now according to the opinion that I\nmaintain, the idea that I have of extension in length, breadth, and\ndepth is not a modification of my soul: it is eternal, immutable,\nnecessary, common to God and all intelligences, and this idea is the\nmodel of created extension from which all bodies are formed. I can\nthus affirm with truth of created extension what I see contained in\nthis uncreated idea (OCM 9:925–6). \n\nAlthough Malebranche had his share of admirers and imitators, he also\nhad his share of critics. The theory of Vision in God was subjected to\nsevere and sometimes bitter attacks by some of his contemporaries,\nespecially Cartesians such as Arnauld and Régis who saw\nthemselves as defending the legacy of Descartes against a corrupting\ninfluence. Fortunately for us, Malebranche was eager to defend himself\nand his replies to criticisms often help elucidate and amplify his\noriginal doctrine, as stated in the first edition (1674) of the\nSearch After Truth. In some cases, these replies are quite\nextensive. Although the dispute with Arnauld ranged over other topics,\nand was originally sparked by theological differences, it lasted some\n11 years and occupies several volumes (four of Malebranche’s, two of\nArnauld’s) of their collected works. Some of Malebranche’s critics\nwere dismissive of his doctrine. ‘[Vision in God] is an opinion\nthat spreads not and is like to die of itself, or at least do no great\nharm,’ John Locke was reported as saying three days before his\ndeath (quoted in Cranston 1957, 478). Malebranche, however, could be\nequally disparaging of his opponents. To his critic Simon Foucher, he\nquipped: ‘When one criticizes a book, it seems to me necessary\nat least to have read it’ (OC 2:496). But once the dust from the\nad hominems settled, several important philosophical issues\nbecame apparent. We shall begin here by discussing objections to the\ndoctrine that were prevalent in Malebranche’s own time and his replies\nto them. We’ll focus on internal criticisms, that is,\nobjections that purport to expose incoherencies, unsound arguments,\nand inconsistencies with larger aspects of his philosophy (as opposed\nto complaints, for example, about his Cartesian infidelities). Toward\nthe end of this section, we shall examine a few objections that have\nbeen raised by recent commentators. Let’s begin with an objection that may have already occurred to the\nreader. Malebranche claims that the idea of the infinite cannot be a\nmodification of our mind, for our mind is finite; it can only reside\nin God, the sole infinite being. But anyone familiar with Descartes’\ncausal argument for God’s existence, from the Third Meditation, knows\nthat he argued otherwise. We have an innate idea of an actually\ninfinite being that has been implanted in us by God himself. How, as\nfinite beings, can we contain such an idea?  To answer this question,\nDescartes drew an important distinction between two aspects of an idea\n— its so-called ‘formal’ being and its\n‘objective,’ or representational, being. Formal being is\nthe kind of being or reality that ideas have in virtue of being modes\nor modifications of one’s mind. As such, they all have the same degree\nof finite reality. Whether I am thinking of the sun, my own mind, or\nan infinite substance, my ideas in this case are all finite, formally\nspeaking. However, insofar as they represent different things to my\nmind, my ideas have different degrees of what he calls\n‘objective reality,’ exploiting a notion prevalent among\nscholastic philosophers. The idea of myself as a thinking thing, for\nexample, has a finite degree of objective reality, while the idea of\nGod has an infinite degree of such reality. The level of objective\nreality of an idea is determined by the level of reality that the\nobject it represents has formally. So Descartes thought that as a\nfinite being, my ideas must all have a finite degree of formal\nreality, but they can have varying degrees of objective reality all\nthe way up to the infinite level. He would thus reject Malebranche’s\nclaim that insofar as my ideas represent something infinite, they must\nreside in God.  \n\nOne should not suppose that Malebranche was unaware of Descartes’\ndistinction between formal and objective reality. On the contrary, he\ncasts the distinction in even starker terms: the mind’s perceptions\nhave formal reality, and only formal reality, for they do not\nrepresent anything beyond themselves. Objective reality is reserved\nfor ideas in God, the only representative beings. But why can’t ideas\nbe perceptions in finite minds?  In particular, why can’t our mind\nhave an idea with infinite objective reality?  As faithful Cartesians,\nArnauld and Régis both raise this objection against\nMalebranche, though using slightly different technical\nvocabulary. Instead of speaking of formal and objective reality, they\nspeak of something being finite or infinite in essendo as\nopposed to finite or infinite in repraesentando,\nrespectively. Addressing Malebranche directly, Arnauld writes: \n\n[I]t is not true that a modality of our soul, which is finite, cannot\nrepresent an infinite thing; and it is true, on the contrary, that\nhowever finite our perceptions may be, there are some which must pass\nfor infinite in this sense, that they represent the infinite. This is\nwhat M. Régis correctly maintained to you, and what he meant by\nthese terms, that they are finite in essendo, and infinite\nin repraesentando. You are not happy with this\ndistinction. Too bad for you (OA 40:88–9; also see Régis SG\n1:194). \n\nMalebranche responds: \n\n[S]ince [the modalities of our soul] are finite, we cannot find the\ninfinite there, since nothingness is not visible, and one cannot\nperceive in the soul what is not there. Similarly, from the fact that\nI perceive in a circle an infinity of equal diameters, or rather, from\nthe fact that there are equal diameters therein in\nrepraesentando, I must concede that they are really there in\nessendo. For, in effect, a circle contains the reality of an\ninfinity of diameters. In order, then for a reality to be present to\nthe mind, for it to affect the mind, for the mind to perceive or\nreceive it, it necessarily must really be there (OC 9:954). \n\nMalebranche’s reply is subtle and lends itself to multiple\ninterpretations (see e.g., Nadler 1992, 41f; Radner 1978, 107–8, 110–18\nand Schmaltz 2000, 73). One way to understand it is to compare it to a\ncausal principle that Descartes invokes in his argument for God’s\nexistence in the Third Meditation. He claims that the objective\nreality of an idea (such as that of God) must have a cause with at\nleast as much formalreality. Using this principle, he\nconcludes that only a being with infinite formal reality can be the\ncause of the (infinite) objective reality of my idea of such\nbeing. Now, Malebranche is not concerned with causes in this context\nbut with what is required for something to be present to the mind;\nnevertheless, he is making the same general point: something cannot\ngive what reality it does not have. In perceiving a general idea, such\nas a circle, we are able to perceive an infinite number of possible\ndiameters (and thus an infinity of possible particular circles). Thus,\nthe general idea of circle contains an infinite degree of reality. If\nthis idea were a modification of my mind, my mind itself would have to\nbe infinite, which it clearly is not.  \n\nHow should we assess Malebranche’s reply?  To the contemporary reader,\nthe suggestion that ideas and things can have different levels of\nreality or being sounds bizarre, but to his seventeenth-century\nreaders, especially his Cartesian adversaries, this was a common\nview. Evaluated from that perspective, Malebranche’s response holds up\nwell.  \n\nLet us now consider a second objection, related to the first.  A good\ngeneral source of objections to Vision in God is Malebranche’s own\nElucidations, which was first appended to the Search\nin 1678, only four years after the original edition. There he faces\nobjections that had already been raised against the doctrine, but also\nanticipates criticisms that were to be developed later, such as\nArnauld’s worry that Vision in God reduces to Vision of God,\nwhich we have already discussed. One of the objections canvassed there\nraises a cluster of difficulties. Malebranche claims that God is the\nlocus of intelligibility, but why couldn’t this ‘intelligible\nworld’ (monde intelligible) reside in our own mind? God\nsupposedly sees all possible creatures in his own perfections, but why\ncouldn’t the mind see extension at least in its own being?\nMalebranche subscribes to what might be called a ‘cognitive\nresemblance thesis,’ which holds that the immediate object of\ncognition must have the same nature as the mind, which is immaterial\nor spiritual. According to this principle, in order for the mind to\nsee material things in themselves, it would have to be material. But\nhow is God any better off here, as he too is immaterial?  ‘The\nsoul is not material, admitted. But God, though he is a pure spirit,\nsees bodies in himself; why could not the soul, then, see them by\nconsidering itself, even though it itself is spiritual?’ (OC\n3:147, LO 624).  \n\nTo answer this objection, Malebranche stresses the distinction between\ninfinite and finite natures, as he understands it: whereas the mind is\na limited, particular being, God is ‘universal being’ or\n‘being without restriction’ that consists of an infinity\nof perfections. Because he is infinite and indeterminate, God can\ncontain the perfections of materials things in an\n‘eminent’ or higher sense, without thereby becoming\nextended. ‘But as the soul is a particular being, a limited\nbeing, it cannot have extension in it without becoming material,\nwithout being composed of two substances’ (OC 3:148, ibid.). The\nthesis that God contains the perfections of created beings\n‘eminently,’ as opposed to ‘formally’ or\nliterally, is one that Malebranche borrows from Descartes, but he puts\nhis own spin on it by conceiving God as a general being. Recall that\nMalebranche appropriates this conception from St. Thomas Aquinas and,\nindeed, invokes the saint’s name here: \n\nGod’s ideas of creatures are, as Saint Thomas says, only his essence,\ninsofar as it is participable or imperfectly imitable, for God\ncontains every creaturely perfection, though in a divine and infinite\nway; he is one and he is all…. But the soul… is a\nparticular being, a very limited and imperfect being. Certainly it\ncannot see in itself what is not there in any way at all. How could we\nsee in one species of being all species of being, or in a finite and\nparticular being a triangle in general and infinite triangles? (OC\n3:149, LO 625). \n\nThe claim that God is ‘being in general,’ however, invites\nfurther objections, both theological and philosophical. The God of\nChristianity is supposed to be a personal savior who hears our prayers\nand absolves us of sin, not an abstract\n universal.[1]\n It may be difficult to save Malebranche (or Aquinas) from this\nobjection, but one should note that the ‘God of the\nphilosophers,’ conceived of in purely intellectual terms as an\ninfinite and all perfect being, is already removed from the more\nchurchly conception. To add that God is universal being takes us even\nfurther from that conception, though the Christian philosopher can\nalways insist that scripture need not be taken literally. Malebranche\nhimself maintains that his view of God follows from divine infinity,\nwhich of course has a scriptural basis.  \n\nThe conception of God as being in general also offended the\nphilosophical sensibilities of the seventeenth century, which tended\nto favor a nominalist or conceptualist account of universals.\nAccording to this anti-Platonistic view, which had adherents among\nrationalists (e.g., Descartes) and empiricists (e.g., Locke) alike,\nthe only things that exist are particulars, and so-called universals\nsuch as numbers or geometric objects are merely concepts or names. To\nconceive God as a universal violates this creed and, in the view of\nLocke specifically, makes God a bare abstraction (McCracken 1983,\n139). Malebranche, however, maintains that the existence of God or\nbeing in general is necessary to explain the very possibility of\nabstract thought:  \n\nthe mind would be incapable of representing universal ideas of genus,\nspecies, and so on, to itself had it not seen all beings contained in\none…. [S]ense can be made of the way the mind knows certain\nabstract and general truths only through the presence of Him who can\nenlighten the mind in an infinity of different ways (Search\n3.2.6, OC 1:441; LO 232). \n\nIt is not clear, however, that the possibility of abstract cognition\ndemands Vision in God. Some rival theories of abstract\ncognition, prevalent in the period, did not require a Platonistic\nontology, and arguably were more philosophically satisfying.  \n\nThis brings us to yet another objection, concerning the ontology of\nideas in God. Following Descartes, Malebranche proclaims throughout\nhis work that everything that exists is either a substance or a\nmodification of a substance. Thus, it would seem that if ideas are in\nGod then they too must be either substances in their own right or\ndivine modifications. Malebranche explicitly denies the latter, for\nGod is immutable and thus ‘incapable of modifications’\n(Elucidation 10, OC 3:149; LO 625).  But they cannot be substances\neither for that would violate the theological doctrine that God is\nperfectly simple (more on this below). Malebranche, it would appear,\nis forced to abandon his substance-mode ontology: ‘I believe\nthat intelligible extension is neither a substance nor a modification\nof substance, notwithstanding the axiom of the Philosophers [that\neverything is a either a substance or a mode]’ (OC 6:245). One\nmust be careful, however, not to read this remark as conceding defeat,\nfor in the continuation of this reply to Arnauld and in the passage\nabove, he identifies ideas with God’s substance: ‘God’s ideas of\ncreatures are…only His essence, insofar as it is participable\nor imperfectly imitable’ (Elucidation 10, OC 3:149; LO\n625). Perhaps Malebranche is not inconsistent after all for, as it\nturns out, ideas are substances, just not distinct substances. They\nare God’s substance conceived of in a certain way. The problem,\nunfortunately, goes beyond the issue of whether Malebranche is\ninconsistent. We are never given a clear account of the ontology of\nideas; even in identifying them with God he must rely on the Platonic\nmetaphor of participation.  \n\nThere is also considerable pressure in Malebranche’s philosophy\nagainst identifying ideas with God (even with all of the\nqualifications that identification usually assumes). In holding that\nGod creates via archetypes, Malebranche seems committed to the\nposition that ideas are discrete, and not just as we perceive them but\nfor God himself.  This may only require one idea of extension, but\nthere also must be an idea of the mind. This again raises the problem\nof reconciling the theory of ideas with divine simplicity, a doctrine\nto which Malebranche is strongly committed and, ironically, to which\nhe appeals in arguing for Vision in God (see section 4). Even two\ndiscrete ideas in God would be sufficient to violate his simplicity,\nand sometimes Malebranche speaks as if there are more. He recognizes\nthat there is a problem here: ‘there is a great deal of\ndifficulty in reconciling the Divine Being’s simplicity with this\nvariety of intelligible ideas that He contains in His wisdom’\n(ibid., OC 3:137, LO 618). But his only solution is to appeal to\ndivine incomprehensibility.  ‘[T]he divine substance in its\nsimplicity…is beyond our reach….’ (Dialogue 2, OC\n12:52; JS 22). \n\nFar from trying to reconcile divine simplicity with his theory of\nideas, Malebranche seems to exacerbate the problem in some of the ways\nhe characterizes ideas. In Elucidation 10 and elsewhere, for example,\nhe speaks of the ‘parts’ of intelligible extension (see\ne.g., Elucidation 10, OC 3:152–3; LO 627). This locution led Arnauld\nand others to worry not just about divine simplicity but whether\nMalebranche was a Spinozistic pantheist who identified God with\nextension. Malebranche replied that by ‘parts’ he meant\nintelligible parts, not spatial ones (Dialogue 4, OC 12:95,\nJS 58), but it is not clear how this solves the problem, especially\nsince these so-called intelligible parts continue to function like\nspatial ones within his theory, becoming larger or smaller depending\non the object we are perceiving and our perspective on it (Radner\n1978, 117f). The charge of Spinozism would continue to haunt\nMalebranche throughout his career and was developed with even greater\nzeal by a former student named Dortuous de Mairan toward the end of\nhis life.  \n\nOne recent commentator has tried to make sense of Malebranche’s talk\nof intelligible parts, in a way that preserves God’s simplicity and\navoids the dangers of pantheism, by conceiving intelligible extension\nas a set of “point-like entities” that correspond to\nmaterial extension.  Jasper Reid stresses that the former are not real\npoints and that the relation between them is not one of actual\ndistance.  Indeed, he maintains that these intelligible points are\npoints only in relation to the intellect that conceives intelligible\nextension in a partial manner.  One virtue of this interpretation, he\nargues, is that it establishes an isomorphism or identity of structure\nbetween intelligible extension and the corporeal world without making\nthe former materially extended (2003, 600).  Reid’s view is motivated\nin part by the conviction that Malebranche conceived representation in\nterms of resemblance.  Intelligible extension can represent the\nmaterial world only if it resembles it in some way.  He sees\nMalebranche’s talk of intelligible parts as gesturing at the\naforementioned structural resemblance.  Reid’s view is very ingenious\nbut it suffers from philosophical and textual shortcomings.  Although\none other commentator (Watson 1966) has argued that Malebranche\nconceived representation in terms of resemblance, the textual basis\nfor such a claim is rather dubious (see Nadler 1992, 46f).  More\nfatally, Reid’s view requires that one conceive of material extension as\nconsisting of a system of extensionless points, but, like other\nmathematical objects, points are abstractions or idealizations that do\nnot exist in nature.  As Malebranche notes in the Search,\n“Nature is not abstract: the levers and balls of mechanics are\nnot the lines and circles of mathematics” (OC 2:277; LO 428).\nIn short, Reid’s view works only if one idealizes material extension,\nsomething Malebranche refuses to do.\n\n \n\nRecent commentators have developed some of the traditional criticisms\nof the doctrine of Vision in God and proposed new ones of their\nown. These days many commentators are impressed by the link between\nMalebranchean ideas and logical concepts (e.g., Jolley 1990, McCracken\n1983, Nadler 1992, Pyle 2003).  Whereas Cartesian ideas were\npsychological entities or modes of finite minds, Malebranchean ideas\nare abstract, logical entities residing in a third realm (over and\nabove minds and bodies). The virtue of this conception is that it\nexplains how two or more people can be said to be thinking of the same\nabstract object, such as the number ‘two,’ and how various\nproperties, such as the Pythagorean Theorem, can be said to follow\nlogically from the idea of a right triangle. It also pushes\nMalebranche closer to Frege, Kant, and other more recent philosophical\nheroes, and makes him appear prescient with respect to certain\ninsights characteristic of contemporary analytic philosophy.  \n\nOn the other hand, it also resurrects with renewed vigor some of the\nproblems considered above. Most notably, if ideas are abstract,\nlogical entities, then they are even more difficult to reconcile with\nMalebranche’s substance-mode ontology. Indeed, one commentator has\nargued that, to avoid inconsistency, Malebranche ought to have made a\nclean break with the Cartesian assumption that everything is either a\nsubstance or a mode in favor of a more ‘trialistic’ view\nthat grants that ideas, qua third realm entities, are sui\ngeneris (Jolley 1990, 79). As abstract entities, it is also\ndifficult to understand how ideas can have causal powers, in keeping\nwith the doctrine of efficacious ideas, or how they can be identical\nwith God’s substance (Jolley 1990, 76f). In Malebranche’s defense, one\nmight note that the latter problem arises only from regarding ideas as\nlogical entities. Perhaps ideas in God should not be conceived in this\nmanner (Pepper-Bates 2005, 93). \n\nAmong recent objections to Vision in God, one of the most important\nconcerns the relation of intelligible extension to sensations. As we\nhave seen, Malebranche draws an important distinction between these\nbut also thinks that sense perception combines elements of each.  To\nthe sensory component Malebranche accords a crucial role in explaining\nhow intelligible extension is ‘particularized’ or\nindividuated, so as to represent a material object in the\nworld. Sensations of color and light, he says, are\n‘projected’ or ‘painted’ onto intelligible\nextension as if it were an artist’s canvas. The problem, however, is\nin understanding how these radically disparate entities — ideas\nand sensations — can have any commerce with each other. Even if\nwe reject the reading that ideas are logical entities, they are\nnevertheless general and pure, and thus different in kind from\nsensations. \n\nOne proposed solution to this difficulty involves the notion of\n‘seeing as’ (see Nolan 2012, 27–32). Malebranche’s\npainting analogy is merely a metaphor. Sensations of course are not\nliterally painted onto intelligible extension. In fact, intelligible\nextension is not altered by our perception of it since, like all\nthings in God, it is immutable. Rather, we see intelligible\nextension as a particular object, such as a tree or a\nmountain, even though its intrinsic nature is very different. These\ndifferent ways of perceiving nevertheless qualify as cases of seeing\nintelligible extension because, according to the doctrine of\nefficacious ideas, it causes us to perceive it in these different\nways. In fact, when intelligible extension affects our mind with one\nset of sensations, we see it as a mountain; when it produces another\nset of sensations in us, we see it as a white-winged bird flying\nagainst a blue sky, etc. Malebranche writes: \nthere need be in God no sensible bodies or real figures in\nintelligible extension in order for us to see them in God or for God\nto see them in Himself. It is enough that His substance, insofar as\nthe corporeal creature can participate in it, should be able to be\nperceived in different ways (Elucidation 10, OC 3:152; LO 626;\nemphasis added). \n\nLater in the same work he adds: “we see all things in God\nthrough the efficacy of his substance, and particularly sensible\nthings, through God’s applying intelligible extension to our mind in a\nthousand different ways” (OC 3:154, LO 628). \n\nOne attraction of this interpretation is that it also provides a\nsatisfying reply to de Mairan’s objection, considered above, that\nMalebranche succumbs to Spinozism by ascribing parts to intelligible\nextension. Once again, Malebranche could avail himself of the notion\nof seeing as: we see intelligible extension as having parts even\nthough it lacks real parts because it causes us to do so. Given\nMalebranche’s representationalism, seeing intelligible extension in\nthis way explains how we see the material world as divided into\ndiscrete bodies (see Nolan 2012, 35–37).","contact.mail":"lawrence.nolan@csulb.edu","contact.domain":"csulb.edu"}]
