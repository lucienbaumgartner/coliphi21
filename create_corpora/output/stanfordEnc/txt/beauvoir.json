There are\nothers whose philosophical place is forever contested (e.g.,\nNietzsche); and there are those who have gradually won the right to be\nadmitted into the philosophical fold. Simone de Beauvoir is one of\nthese belatedly acknowledged philosophers. Identifying herself as an\nauthor rather than as a philosopher and calling herself the midwife of\nSartre’s existential ethics rather than a thinker in her own\nright, Beauvoir’s place in philosophy had to be won against her\nword. That place is now uncontested. The international conference\ncelebrating the centennial of Beauvoir’s birth organized by\nJulia Kristeva is one of the more visible signs of Beauvoir’s\ngrowing influence and status. Her enduring contributions to the fields\nof ethics, politics, existentialism, phenomenology and feminist theory\nand her significance as an activist and public intellectual is now a\nmatter of record. Unlike her status as a philosopher, Simone de\nBeauvoir’s position as a feminist theorist has never been in\nquestion. Controversial from the beginning, The Second\nSex’s critique of patriarchy continues to challenge social,\npolitical and religious categories used to justify women’s\ninferior status. Though readers of the English translation of The\nSecond Sex have never had trouble understanding the feminist\nsignificance of its analysis of patriarchy, they might be forgiven for\nmissing its philosophical importance so long as they had to rely on an\narbitrarily abridged version of The Second Sex that was\nquestionably translated by a zoologist who was deaf to the\nphilosophical meanings and nuances of Beauvoir’s French terms.\nThe 2010 translation of The Second Sex changed that. In\naddition to providing the full text, this translation’s\nsensitivity to the philosophical valence of Beauvoir’s writing\nmakes it possible for her English readers to understand the\nexistential-phenomenological grounds of her feminist analysis of the\nforces that subordinate women to men and designate her as the\nOther.\n\nSome have found Beauvoir’s exclusion from the domain of\nphilosophy more than a matter of taking Beauvoir at her word. They\nattribute it to an exclusively systematic view of philosophy which,\ndeaf to the philosophical methodology of the metaphysical novel,\nignored the ways that Beauvoir embedded phenomenological-existential\narguments in her literary works. Between those who did not challenge\nBeauvoir’s self-portrait, those who did not accept her\nunderstanding of the relationship between literature and philosophy,\nand those who missed the unique signature of her philosophical essays,\nBeauvoir the philosopher remained a lady-in-waiting.  \nSome have argued that the belated admission of Beauvoir into the ranks\nof philosophers is a matter of sexism on two counts. The first\nconcerns the fact that Beauvoir was a woman. Her philosophical\nwritings were read as echoes of Sartre rather than explored for their\nown contributions because it was only “natural” to think\nof a woman as a disciple of her male companion. The second concerns\nthe fact that she wrote about women. The Second Sex,\nrecognized as one of the hundred most important works of the twentieth\ncentury, would not be counted as philosophy because it dealt with sex,\nhardly a burning philosophical issue (so it was said). This\nencyclopedia entry shows how much things have changed. Long overdue,\nBeauvoir’s recognition as a philosopher is now secure.  \nSimone de Beauvoir was born on January 9, 1908. She died seventy-eight\nyears later, on April 14, 1986. At the time of her death she was\nhonored as a crucial figure in the struggle for women’s rights,\nand as an eminent writer, having won the Prix Goncourt, the\nprestigious French literary award, for her novel The\nMandarins (1954). She was also famous for being the life-long\ncompanion of Jean Paul Sartre. Active in the French intellectual scene\nall of her life, and a central player in the philosophical debates of\nthe times both in her role as an author of philosophical essays,\nnovels, plays, memoirs, travel diaries, and newspaper articles, and as\nan editor of Les Temps Modernes, Beauvoir was not considered\na philosopher in her own right at the time of her death.  \nBeauvoir would have appreciated the fact that her current\nphilosophical status reflects our changed understanding of the domain\nof philosophy and the changed situation of women, for it confirms her\nidea of situated freedom—that our capacity for agency and\nmeaning-making, that whether or not we are identified as agents and\nmeaning-makers, is constrained, though never determined, by our\nsituation. She would also have appreciated the fact that while her\nworks were instrumental in effecting these changes, their lasting\neffect is a tribute to the ways that others have taken up her\nphilosophical and feminist legacies; for one of her crucial\ncontributions to our ethical and political vocabularies is the concept\nof the appeal—that the success of our projects depends on the\nextent to which they are adopted by others \nBeauvoir detailed her phenomenological and existential critique of the\nphilosophical status quo in her 1946 essay Literature and\nthe Metaphysical Essay, and her 1965 and 1966 essays Que Peut\nla Littérature? and Mon Expérience\nd’écrivain. This critique, influenced by both\nHusserl and Heidegger, focused on the significance of lived experience\nand on the ways that the meanings of the world are revealed in\nlanguage. Heidegger turned to the language of poetry for this\nrevelation. Beauvoir, Camus and Sartre turned to the language of the\nnovel and the theater. They looked to Husserl to theorize their turn\nto these discourses by insisting on grounding their theoretical\nanalyses in the concrete particulars of lived experience. They looked\nto Heidegger to challenge the privileged position of abstract\ndiscourses. For Beauvoir, however, the turn to literature carried\nethical and political as well as philosophical implications. It\nallowed her to explore the limits of the appeal (the activity of\ncalling on others to take up one’s political projects); to\nportray the temptations of violence; to enact her existential ethics\nof freedom, responsibility, joy and generosity, and to examine the\nintimacies and complexities of our relationships with others. \nBeauvoir’s challenge to the philosophical tradition was part of\nthe existential-phenomenological project. Her challenge to the\npatriarchal status quo was more dramatic. It was an event.\nNot at first, however, for at its publication The Second Sex\nwas regarded more as an affront to sexual decency than a political\nindictment of patriarchy or a phenomenological account of the meaning\nof “woman”. The women who came to be known as second-wave\nfeminists understood what Beauvoir’s first readers missed. It\nwas not sexual decency that was being attacked but patriarchal\nindecency that was on trial. The Second Sex expressed their\nsense of injustice, focused their demands for social, political, and\npersonal change and alerted them to the connections between private\npractices and public policies. The Second Sex remains a\ncontentious book. No longer considered sexually scandalous, its\nanalysis of patriarchy and its proposed antidotes to women’s\ndomination are still debated. What is not contested, however, is the\nfact that feminism as we know it remains in its debt.  \nAs The Second Sex became a catalyst for challenging\nwomen’s situations, Beauvoir’s political and intellectual\nplace was also reset. With regard to feminism, she herself was\nresponsible for the change. After repeatedly refusing to align herself\nwith the feminist movement, Beauvoir declared herself a feminist in a\n1972 interview in Le Nouvel observateur and joined other\nMarxist feminists in founding the journal Questions\nféministes. With regard to the philosophical field it took\nthe efforts of others to get her a seat at the table; for though\nBeauvoir belatedly identified herself as a feminist, she never called\nherself a philosopher. Her philosophical voice, she insisted, was\nmerely an elaboration of Sartre’s. Those denials coupled with\nthe fact of her life-long intimate relationship with Sartre positioned\nher in the public and philosophical eye as his alter ego. Decoupling\nBeauvoir from Sartre became the first priority of those interested in\nestablishing her independent philosophical credentials. Sometimes the\nissue concerned Sartre’s originality: Were the ideas of his\nBeing and Nothingness (1943) stolen from Beauvoir’s She Came to\nStay (1943)? Sometimes they concerned matters of influence: What\nhappened in their discussions and critiques of each other’s\nwork? Eventually these arguments abated and scholars turned from\nexclusive attention to the matter of Sartre’s influence to the\nmore fruitful question of influence in the broader sense. They began\nto trace the ways that she, like her existential-phenomenological\ncontemporaries, took up and reconfigured their philosophical heritage\nto reflect their shared methodology and unique insights. We now\nunderstand that to fully appreciate the rich complexities of\nBeauvoir’s thought, we need to attend to the fact that her\ngraduate thesis was on Leibniz; that her reading of Hegel was\ninfluenced by the interpretations of Kojève; that she was\nintroduced to Husserl and Heidegger by her teacher Baruzi; that Marx\nand Descartes were familiar figures in her philosophical vocabulary;\nand that Bergson was an early influence on her thinking.  \nThough Beauvoir’s first philosophical essay was Pyrrhus and\nCinéas (1944) many of her interpreters identify She\nCame to Stay (1943) as her inaugural philosophical foray. It is a\nclear example of what Beauvoir calls the metaphysical novel. The\nletters between Sartre and Beauvoir and Beauvoir’s diaries of\nthat period (published in the 1980s), show that both Beauvoir and\nSartre were concerned with the question of the other, the issue of bad\nfaith and the dynamics of desire. They were also examining the\nrelationship and tensions between our singular existential status and\nthe social conditions within which our singularity is lived. She\nCame to Stay is packed with philosophical\nreflections—reflections on our relationship to time, to each\nother, to ourselves. These reflections are never, however, presented\nin systematic arguments or brought to closure. They are lived in the\nconcrete, ambiguously triangulated lives of Pierre, Xavière and\nFrançoise. Opening with a quote from Hegel, “Each\nconscience seeks the death of the other”, and ending with\nFrançoise’s murder of Xavière, which Beauvoir\nnarrates as an act in which Françoise confronts her solitude\nand announces her freedom, the novel does not necessarily confirm\nHegel’s claim; for the point of the murder was not to eliminate\nthe other per se but to destroy a particular other,\nXavière, the other who threatened to leave Françoise\nwithout the other she loved, Pierre. Existential ambiguity trumps\nHegelian clarity. The issues raised in this first novel, however, the\nambiguity regarding the responsibilities and limits of freedom, the\nlegitimacy of violence, the tension between our experience of\nourselves as simultaneously solitary and intertwined with others, the\ntemptations of bad faith and the examination of the existentially\nfaithful relationship to time will pervade Beauvoir’s subsequent\nreflections. \nPyrrhus and Cinéas (1944), published one year after\nShe Came To Stay, is Beauvoir’s first philosophical\nessay. It addresses such fundamental ethical and political issues as:\nWhat are the criteria of ethical action? How can I distinguish ethical\nfrom unethical political projects? What are the principles of ethical\nrelationships? Can violence ever be justified? It examines these\nquestions from an existential-phenomenological perspective. Taking the\nsituation of the concrete existing individual as its point of\ndeparture, it provides an analysis of the ways that as particular\nsubjects we are necessarily embedded in the world, and inescapably\nrelated to others. Though not feminist in any identifiable sense,\nPyrrhus and Cinéas raises such compelling feminist\nquestions as: Under what conditions, if any, may I speak for/ in the\nname of another? \nAfter opening Pyrrhus and Cinéas with Plutarch’s\naccount of a conversation between Pyrrhus and Cinéas, where the\njustification of action is questioned, Beauvoir, finding the\nrecommendation to be passive inconsistent with the realities of human\nnature and desire, asks three questions: What is the measure of a\nperson? What goals can one set for oneself? What hopes are permitted\nto us? She then divides the text into two parts. Part one moves from\nthe ontological truth—that I am a finite freedom whose endings\nare always and necessarily new beginnings—to the existential\nquestions: How can I desire to be what I am? How can I live my\nfinitude with passion? These existential questions lead to moral and\npolitical ones: What actions express the truth and passion of our\ncondition? How can I act in such a way as to create the conditions\nthat sustain and support the humanity of human beings? Part I\nconcludes with the observation that: “A man alone in the world\nwould be paralyzed by … the vanity of all of his goals. But man\nis not alone in the world” (PhilW 115, cf. P&C 42). Beauvoir opens Part II\nwith the properly ethical question: What is my relation to the other?\nHere the analysis is dominated by the problem created by\nBeauvoir’s insistence on the radical nature of freedom.\nAccording to Beauvoir, the other, as free, is immune to my power.\nWhatever I do—if as master I exploit slaves, or as executioner I\nhang murderers—I cannot violate their inner subjective freedom.\nSubstituting the inner-outer difference for the Cartesian mind-body\ndistinction, Beauvoir argues that we can never directly touch the\nfreedom of others. Our relationships are either superficial, engaging\nonly the outer surface of each other’s being, or mediated\nthrough our common commitment to a shared goal or value. As free, I am\nsaved from the dangers of intimacy and the threat of\ndehumanization. \nThis line of argument would seem to lead either to benign Stoic\nconclusions of mutual indifference, or to the finding that tyrants and\nterrorists pose no threat to individual freedom. Beauvoir does not,\nhowever, let it drift in these directions. Instead she uses the\ninner-outer distinction and the idea that I need others to take up my\nprojects if they are to have a future, to introduce the ideas of the\nappeal and risk. She develops the concept of freedom as transcendence\n(the movement toward an open future and indeterminate possibilities)\nto argue that we cannot be determined by the present. The essence of\nfreedom as transcendence aligns freedom with uncertainty and risk. To\nbe free is to be radically contingent. Though I find myself in a world\nof value and meaning, these values and meanings were brought into the\nworld by others. I am free to reject, alter or endorse them for the\nmeaning of the world is determined by human choices. Whatever choice I\nmake, however, I cannot support it without the help of others. My\nvalues will find a home in the world only if others embrace them; only\nif I persuade others to make my values theirs.  \nAs radically free I need the other. I need to be able to appeal to\nothers to join me in my projects. The knot of the ethical problem lies\nhere: How can I, a radically free being who is existentially severed\nfrom all other human freedoms, transcend the isolations of freedom to\ncreate a community of allies? Given the necessity of appealing to the\nother’s freedom, under what conditions is such an appeal\npossible? \nIn answering these questions Beauvoir turns the inner-outer\ndistinction to her advantage as she develops the concept of situated\nfreedom. Though I can neither act for another nor directly influence\ntheir freedom, I must, Beauvoir argues, accept responsibility for the\nfact that my actions produce the conditions within which the other\nacts. However irrelevant my conduct may be for the other’s inner\nfreedom, it concerns mine. “I am”, Beauvoir writes, “the\nface of the other’s misery... I am the facticity of their\nsituation” (PhilW 126, cf. P&C 58). Pursuing this difference between my power to\neffect the other’s freedom and my responsibility for their\nsituation, and exploring the conditions under which my appeal to the\nother can/will be heard, Beauvoir determines that there are two\nconditions of the appeal. First, I must be allowed to call to the\nother and must struggle against those who try to silence me. Second,\nthere must be others who can respond to my call. The first condition\nmay be purely political. The second is political and material. Only\nequals, Beauvoir argues, can hear or respond to my call. Only those\nwho are not consumed by the struggle for survival, only those who\nexist in the material conditions of freedom, health, leisure and\nsecurity can become my allies in the struggle against injustice. The\nfirst rule of justice, therefore, is to work for a world where the\nmaterial and political conditions of the appeal are secured. \nViolence is not ruled out. Given that Beauvoir has argued that we can\nnever reach the other in the depths of their freedom, she cannot call\nit evil. She does not, however, endorse it. Neither does she envision\na future without conflict. The fact that we are differently situated\nand engage in the work of transcendence from different historical,\neconomic, sexed and racial positions ensures that some of us will\nalways be an obstacle to another’s freedom. “We are”, Beauvoir\nwrites, “condemned to violence” (PhilW 138, cf. P&C 77). As neither\nevil nor avoidable, violence, she argues, is “the mark of a\nfailure which nothing can offset” (PhilW 138, cf. P&C 77). It is the\ntragedy of the human condition. \nThe argument of Pyrrhus and Cinéas ends on an uneasy\nnote. As ethical, we are obliged to work for the conditions of\nmaterial and political equality. In calling on others to take up our\nprojects and give these projects a future, we are precluded from\nforcing others to become our allies. We are enjoined to appeal to\ntheir freedom. Where persuasion fails, however, we are permitted the\nrecourse to violence. The ambiguity of our being as subjects for\nourselves and objects for others in the world is lived in this dilemma\nof violence and justice. Becoming lucid about the meaning of freedom,\nwe learn to live our freedom by accepting its finitude and\ncontingency, its risks and its failures. \nIt is impossible to know where Simone de Beauvoir’s thinking\nwould have gone had she been spared the cold, the hunger and the fear\nof living in Nazi occupied Paris. What we do know is that coming face\nto face with forces of injustice beyond her control, the questions of\nevil and the Other took on new urgency. Beauvoir speaks of the war as\ncreating an existential rupture in time. She speaks of herself as\nhaving undergone a conversion. She can no longer afford the luxury of\nfocusing on her own happiness and pleasure. The question of evil\nbecomes a pressing concern. One cannot refuse to take a stand. One is\neither a collaborator or not. In writing The Ethics of\nAmbiguity, Beauvoir takes her stand. She identifies herself as an\nexistentialist and identifies existentialism as the philosophy of our\n(her) times because it is the only philosophy that takes the question\nof evil seriously. It is the only philosophy prepared to counter\nDostoevsky’s claim that without God everything is permissible.\nThat we are alone in the world and that we exist without guarantees,\nare not, however, the only truths of the human condition. There is\nalso the truth of our freedom and this truth, as detailed in The\nEthics of Ambiguity, entails a logic of reciprocity and\nresponsibility that contests the terrors of a world ruled only by the\nauthority of power. \nThe Ethics of Ambiguity, published in 1947, reconsiders the\nPyrrhus and Cinéas idea of invulnerable freedom.\nDropping the distinction between the inner and outer domains of\nfreedom and deploying a unique understanding of consciousness as an\nintentional activity, Beauvoir now finds that I can be alienated from\nmy freedom. Similar to She Came To Stay, which bears the\nimprint of Hegel’s account of the fight to the death that sets\nthe stage for the master-slave dialectic, and Pyrrhus and\nCinéas, which works through the Cartesian implications of\nour existential situation, The Ethics of Ambiguity redeploys\nconcepts of canonical philosophical figures. Here Beauvoir takes up\nthe phenomenologies of Husserl and Hegel to provide an analysis of\nintersubjectivity that accepts the singularity of the existing\nindividual without allowing that singularity to justify an\nepistemological solipsism, an existential isolationism or an ethical\negoism. The Hegel drawn on here is the Hegel who resolves the\ninequalities of the master-slave relationship through the justice of\nmutual recognition. The Husserl appealed to is the Husserl who\nintroduced Beauvoir to the thesis of intentionality. \nThe Ethics of Ambiguity opens with an account of\nintentionality which designates the meaning-disclosing, meaning-making\nand meaning-desiring activities of consciousness as both insistent and\nambiguous—insistent in that they are spontaneous and\nunstoppable; ambiguous in that they preclude any possibility of\nself-unification or closure. Beauvoir describes the intentionality of\nconsciousness as operating in two ways. First there is the activity of\nwanting to disclose the meaning of being. Second there is the activity\nof bringing meaning to the world. In the first mode of activity\nconsciousness expresses its freedom to discover meaning. In the\nsecond, it uses its freedom to become the author of the meaning of the\nworld. Beauvoir identifies each of these intentionalities with a mood:\nthe first with the mood of joy, the second with the dual moods of hope\nand domination. Whether the second moment of intentionality becomes\nthe ground of projects of liberation or exploitation depends on\nwhether the mood of hope or domination prevails. \nDescribing consciousness as ambiguous, Beauvoir identifies our\nambiguity with the idea of failure. We can never fulfill our passion\nfor meaning in either of its intentional expressions; that is, we will\nnever succeed in fully revealing the meaning of the world, and never\nbecome God, the author of the meaning of the world. These truths of\nintentionality set the criteria of Beauvoir’s ethics. Finding\nthat ethical systems and absolutes, insofar as they claim to give\nfinal answers to our ethical dilemmas and authoritarian justifications\nfor our actions, offer dangerous consolations for our failure to be\nthe absolute source of the world’s meaning or being, Beauvoir\nrejects these systems of absolutes in favor of ethical projects that\nacknowledge our limits and recognize the future as open. From this\nperspective her ethics of ambiguity might be characterized as an\nethics of existential hope. \nBeauvoir’s Ethics of Ambiguity is a secularism that\nrejects the ideas of God and Humanity. Their apparent differences\nconceal a common core: both claim to have identified an absolute\nsource for, and justifications of our beliefs and actions. They allow\nus to evade responsibility for creating the conditions of our\nexistence and to flee the anxieties of ambiguity. Whether it is called\nthe age of the Messiah or the classless society, these appeals to a\nutopian destiny encourage us to think in terms of ends which justify\nmeans. They invite us to sacrifice the present for the future. They\nare the stuff of inquisitions, imperialisms, gulags and Auschwitz.\nPrivileging the future over the present they pervert our relationship\nto time, each other and ourselves. Insisting that the future is\nundecided and that its form will be shaped by our present decisions\nBeauvoir argues that it is only by insisting on the dignity of\ntoday’s human beings that the dignity of those to come can be\nsecured. \nBeauvoir rejects the familiar charge against secularism made famous by\nDostoevsky’s Grand Inquisitor: “If God is dead everything\nis permitted”. As she sees it, without God to pardon us for our\n“sins” we are totally and inexcusably responsible for our\nactions. Dostoevsky was mistaken. The problem of secularism is not\nthat of license, it is the problem of the “we”. Can\nseparate existing individuals be bound to each other? Can they forge\nlaws binding for all? The Ethics of Ambiguity insists that\nthey can. It does this by arguing that evil resides in the denial of\nfreedom (mine and others), that we are responsible for ensuring the\nexistence of the conditions of freedom (the material conditions of a\nminimal standard of living and the political conditions of uncensored\ndiscourse and association), and that I can neither affirm nor live my\nfreedom without also affirming the freedom of others. \nBeauvoir’s argument for ethical freedom begins by noting a\nfundamental fact of the human condition. We begin our lives as\nchildren who are dependent on others and embedded in a world already\nendowed with meaning. We are born into the condition that Beauvoir\ncalls the “serious world”. This is a world of ready made\nvalues and established authorities. This is a world where obedience is\ndemanded. For children, this world is neither alienating nor stifling\nfor they are too young to assume the responsibilities of freedom. As\nchildren who create imaginary worlds, we are in effect learning the\nlessons of freedom—that we are creators of the meaning and value\nof the world. Free to play, children develop their creative capacities\nand their meaning-making abilities without, however, being held\naccountable for the worlds they bring into being. Considering these\ntwo dimensions of children’s lives, their imaginative freedom\nand their freedom from responsibility, Beauvoir determines that the\nchild lives a metaphysically privileged existence. Children, she says,\nexperience the joys but not the anxieties of freedom. Beauvoir also,\nhowever, describes children as mystified. By this she means that they\nbelieve that the foundations of the world are secure and that their\nplace in the world is naturally given and unchangeable. Beauvoir marks\nadolescence as the end of this idyllic era. It is the time of moral\ndecision. Emerging into the world of adults, we are now called upon to\nrenounce the serious world, to reject the mystification of childhood\nand to take responsibility for our choices. \nAll of us pass through the age of adolescence; not all of us take up\nits ethical demands. The fact of our initial dependency has moral\nimplications, for it predisposes us to the temptations of bad faith,\nstrategies by which we deny our existential freedom and our moral\nresponsibility. It sets our desire in the direction of a nostalgia for\nthose lost Halcyon days. Looking to return to the security of that\nmetaphysically privileged time, some of us evade the responsibilities\nof freedom by choosing to remain children, that is, to submit to the\nauthority of others. \nBeauvoir does not object to the mystification of childhood. She\nacknowledges that parental authority is necessary for the\nchild’s survival. To treat adults as children, however, is\nimmoral and evil. To choose to remain a child is an act of bad faith.\nIf we are exploited, enslaved or terrorized, however, our submission\nto authority of the other cannot be counted as an act of bad faith.\nAbsent these conditions, Beauvoir holds us accountable for our\nresponse to the experience of freedom. We cannot use the anxieties of\nfreedom either as an excuse for our active participation in, or our\npassive acceptance of the exploitation of others. Hiding behind the\nauthority of others or establishing ourselves as authorities over\nothers are culpable offenses.  \nBeauvoir portrays the complexity of the ways that we either avoid or\naccept the responsibilities of freedom in the imaginary and\n(sometimes) historical figures of the sub-man, the serious man, the\nnihilist, the adventurer, the passionate man, the critical thinker and\nthe artist-writer. The point of delineating these human types is\nseveral fold. It is a way of distinguishing between two kinds of\nunethical positions. One, portrayed in the portraits of the sub-man\nand the serious man, refuses to recognize the experience of freedom.\nThe other, depicted in the pictures of the nihilist, the adventurer\nand the maniacally passionate man, misreads the meanings of freedom.\nThe ethical person, as portrayed by Beauvoir, is driven by passion.\nUnlike the egoistic, maniacal passion of the tyrant, however, the\nethical passion of the artist-writer is defined by its\ngenerosity—specifically the generosity of recognizing the\nother’s singularity and protecting the other in their difference\nfrom becoming an object of another’s will. \nIn describing the different ways that freedom is evaded or misused,\nBeauvoir distinguishes ontological from ethical freedom. She shows us\nthat acknowledging our freedom is a necessary but not a sufficient\ncondition for ethical action. To meet the conditions of the ethical,\nfreedom must be used properly. It must, according to Beauvoir, embrace\nthe ties that bind me to others, and take up the appeal—an act\nwhereby I call on others, in their freedom, to join me in bringing\ncertain values, projects, conditions into being. Artists and writers\nembody the ethical ideal in several respects. Their work expresses the\nsubjective passion that grounds the ethical life. They describe the\nways that the material and political complexities of our situations\ncan either alienate us from our freedom or open us to it. By\nenvisioning the future as open and contingent, artists and writers\nchallenge the mystifications that validate sacrificing the present for\nthe future. They establish the essential relationship between my\nfreedom and the freedom of others. \nThe Ethics of Ambiguity does not avoid the question of\nviolence. Determining that violence is sometimes necessary, Beauvoir\nuses the example of the young Nazi soldier to argue that to liberate\nthe oppressed we may have to destroy their oppressors. She distances\nherself from the argument of Pyrrhus and Cinéas; now\nshe identifies violence as an assault on the other’s freedom\n(however misused) and as such this violence marks our failure to\nrespect the “we” of our humanity. Thus, The Ethics of\nAmbiguity provides an analysis of our existential-ethical\nsituation that joins a hard-headed realism (violence is an unavoidable\nfact of our condition) with demanding requirements. It is unique,\nhowever, in aligning this realism and these requirements with the\npassion of generosity and a mood of joy.  \nIn her memoir The Force of Circumstance (1963), Beauvoir\nlooks back at The Ethics of Ambiguity and criticizes it for\nbeing too abstract. She does not repudiate the arguments of her text,\nbut finds that it erred in trying to define morality independent of a\nsocial context. The Second Sex may be read as correcting this\nerror—as reworking and materially situating the analyses of\nThe Ethics of Ambiguity. Imaginary caricatures will be\nreplaced by phenomenological descriptions of the situations of real\nwomen.  \nWhere Beauvoir’s earlier works blurred the borders separating\nphilosophy and literature, her later writings disrupt the boundaries\nbetween the personal, the political and the philosophical. Now,\nBeauvoir takes herself, her situation, her embodiment and the\nsituations and embodiments of other women, as the subjects of her\nphilosophical reflections. Where The Ethics of Ambiguity\nconjured up images of ethical and unethical figures to make its\narguments tangible, the analyses of The Second Sex are\nmaterialized in Beauvoir’s experiences as a woman and in\nwomen’s lived realities. Where The Ethics of Ambiguity\nspeaks of mystification in a general sense, The Second Sex\nspeaks of the specific ways that the natural and social sciences and\nthe European literary, social, political and religious traditions have\ncreated a world where impossible and conflicting ideals of femininity\nproduce an ideology of women’s “natural” inferiority\nto justify patriarchal domination.  \nBeauvoir’s self criticism suggests that her later works mark a\nbreak with her earlier writings. We should, however, resist the\ntemptation to take this notion of discontinuity too far. Rather than\nthinking in terms of breaks it is more fruitful to see The Second\nSex in terms of a more radical commitment to the phenomenological\ninsight that it is as embodied beings that we engage the world. Our\naccess to, awareness of, and possibilities for world engagement cannot\nbe considered absent a consideration of the body. \nBefore The Second Sex, the sexed/gendered body was not an\nobject of phenomenological investigation. Beauvoir changed that. Her\nargument for sexual equality takes two directions. First, it exposes\nthe ways that masculine ideology exploits the sexual difference to\ncreate systems of inequality. Second, it identifies the ways that\narguments for equality erase the sexual difference in order to\nestablish the masculine subject as the absolute human type. Here Plato\nis her target. Plato, beginning with the premise that sex is an\naccidental quality, concludes that women and men are equally qualified\nto become members of the guardian class. The price of women’s\nadmission to this privileged class, however, is that they must train\nand live like men. Thus the discriminatory sexual difference remains\nin play. Only men or those who emulate them may rule. Beauvoir’s\nargument for equality does not fall into this trap. She insists that\nwomen and men treat each other as equals and that such treatment\nrequires that their sexual differences be validated. Equality is not a\nsynonym for sameness.  \nThe Second Sex argues against the either/or frame of the\nwoman question (either women and men are equal or they are different).\nIt argues for women’s equality, while insisting on the reality\nof the sexual difference. Beauvoir finds it unjust and immoral to use\nthe sexual difference as an argument for women’s subordination.\nShe finds it un-phenomenological, however, to ignore it. As a\nphenomenologist she is obliged to examine women’s unique\nexperiences of their bodies and to determine how these experiences are\nco-determined by what phenomenology calls the everyday attitude (the\ncommon-sense assumptions that we unreflectively bring to our\nexperience). As a feminist phenomenologist assessing the meanings of\nthe lived female body, Beauvoir explores the ways that cultural\nassumptions frame women’s experience of their bodies and\nalienate them from their body’s possibilities. For example, it\nis assumed that women are the weaker sex. What, she directs us to ask,\nis the ground of this assumption? What criteria of strength are used?\nUpper body power? Average body size? Is there a reason not to consider\nlongevity a sign of strength? Using this criterion, would women still\nbe considered the weaker sex? A bit of reflection exposes the biases\nof the criteria used to support the supposedly obvious fact of\nwomen’s weakness and transforms it from an unassailable reality\nto an unreliable assumption. Once we begin this questioning, it is not\nlong before other so-called facts fall to the side of “common\nsense” in the phenomenological sense.  \nWhat is perhaps the most famous line of The Second Sex, “On ne naît pas femme: on le devient” (1949, 13), translated in 1953 as  “One is not born but becomes a woman” (1953, 267) and in 2010 as “One is not born but becomes woman”, is credited by many as alerting us to the sex-gender distinction. Whether or not Beauvoir understood herself to be inaugurating this\ndistinction, whether or not she followed this distinction to its\nlogical/radical conclusions, or whether or not radical conclusions are\njustified are currently matters of feminist debate. What is not a\nmatter of dispute is that The Second Sex gave us the\nvocabulary for analyzing the social constructions of femininity and a\nmethod for critiquing these constructions. By not accepting the common\nsense idea that to be born with female genitalia is to be born a woman\nthis most famous line of The Second Sex pursues the first\nrule of phenomenology: identify your assumptions, treat them as\nprejudices and put them aside; do not bring them back into play until\nand unless they have been validated by experience. \nTaken within the context of its contemporary philosophical scene,\nThe Second Sex was a phenomenological analysis waiting to\nhappen. Whether or not it required a woman phenomenologist to discover\nthe effects of sex/gender on the lived body’s experience cannot\nbe said. That it was a woman who taught us to bracket the assumption\nthat the lived body’s sex/gender was accidental to its lived\nrelations, positions, engagements, etc. is a matter of history. What\nwas a phenomenological breakthrough became in The Second Sex\na liberatory tool: by attending to the ways that patriarchal\nstructures used the sexual difference to deprive women of their\n“can do” bodies, Beauvoir made the case for declaring this\ndeprivation oppressive. Taken within the context of the feminist\nmovement, this declaration of oppression was an event. It opened the\nway for the consciousness-raising that characterized second-wave\nfeminism; it validated women’s experiences of injustice. What\nfrom an existential-phenomenological perspective, was a detailed\nanalysis of the lived body, and an ethical and political indictment of\nthe ways that patriarchy alienated women from their embodied\ncapacities, was, from a feminist perspective, an appeal that called on\nwomen to take up the politics of liberation. \nSeveral concepts are crucial to the argument of The Second\nSex. The concept of the Other is introduced early in the text and\ndrives the entire analysis. It has also become a critical concept in\ntheories that analyze the oppressions of colonized, enslaved and other\nexploited people. Beauvoir will use it again in her last major work,\nThe Coming of Age (1970), to structure her critique of the\nways that the elderly are “othered” by society. \nBeauvoir bases her idea of the Other on Hegel’s account of the\nmaster-slave dialectic. Instead of the terms “master” and\n“slave”, however, she uses the terms “Subject”\nand “Other”. The Subject is the absolute. The Other is the\ninessential. Unlike Hegel who universalized this dialectic, Beauvoir\ndistinguishes the dialectic of exploitation between historically\nconstituted Subjects and Others from the exploitation that ensues when\nthe Subject is Man and the Other is Woman. In the first case those\nmarked as Other experience their oppression as a communal reality.\nThey see themselves as part of an oppressed group. Here, oppressed\nOthers may call on the resources of a common history and a shared\nabusive situation to assert their subjectivity and demand recognition\nand reciprocity. \nThe situation of women is comparable to the condition of the Hegelian\nOther in that men, like the Hegelian Master, identify themselves as\nthe Subject, the absolute human type, and, measuring women by this\nstandard of the human, identify them as inferior. Women’s\nso-called inadequacies are then used as justification for seeing them\nas the Other and for treating them accordingly. Unlike the Hegelian\nOther, however, women are unable to identify the origin of their\notherness. They cannot call on the bond of a shared history to\nreestablish their lost status as Subjects. Further, dispersed among\nthe world of men, they identify themselves in terms of the differences\nof their oppressors (e.g., as white or black women, as working-class\nor middle-class women, as Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist or Hindu\nwomen) rather than with each other. They lack the solidarity and\nresources of the Hegelian Other for organizing themselves into a\n“we” that demands recognition. Finally, their conflict\nwith men is ambiguous. According to Beauvoir, women and men exist in a\n“primordial Mitsein” (SS: 2010, 9, cf. 1949, 22): there is a unique bond\nbetween this Subject and its Other. In contesting their status as\ninessential, women must discover their “we” and take\naccount of the Mitsein. Beauvoir uses the category of the\nInessential Other to designate the unique situation of women as the\nambiguous Other of men. Unlike the Other of the master-slave\ndialectic, women are not positioned to rebel. As Inessential Others,\nwomen’s routes to subjectivity and recognition cannot follow the\nHegelian script (SS: 2010, 6–9, cf. 1949, 18–22 ). \nThis attention to what Beauvoir, borrowing from Heidegger, calls a\n“primordial Mitsein” may be why she does not\nrepeat her earlier argument that violence is sometimes necessary for\nthe pursuit of justice in The Second Sex. Often criticized as\none mark of Beauvoir’s heterosexism, this reference to the\nMitsein is not made in ignorance of lesbian sexuality and is\nnot a rejection of non-heterosexual sexualities. It is a recognition\nof the present state of affairs where the heterosexual norm prevails.\nIf patriarchy is to be dismantled we will have to understand how\nheteronormative sexuality serves it. We will have to denaturalize it.\nTo Beauvoir’s way of thinking, however, the institutional\nalienations of heterosexuality ought not be confused with the erotics\nof heterosexual desire. The realities of this desire and the bond of\nthe “primordial Mitsein” that it forges must be\ntaken into account: not only is it used to enforce women’s\nisolation and to support their inability to identify a common history,\nit is also responsible for the value and relationship that Beauvoir\ncalls the “bond”, a situation-specific articulation of the\nappeal found in in The Ethics of Ambiguity. \nA brief but packed sentence that appears early in the The Second\nSex alerts us to the ways that Beauvoir used existential and\nMarxist categories to analyze the unique complexities of women’s\nsituation. It reads,  \nHence woman makes no claim for herself as subject because she lacks\nthe concrete means, because she senses the necessary link connecting\nher to man without positing its reciprocity, and because she often\nderives satisfaction from her role as the Other. (SS: 2010, 10, cf. 1949, 24) \nThis statement needs to be read in the context of Beauvoir’s\nethical-political question, “How can a human being in a\nwoman’s situation attain fulfillment?” \nBetween the statement and the question we discover that the\nethical-political issue of fulfillment does not concern a\nwoman’s happiness. Happiness may be chosen or accepted in\nexchange for the deprivations of freedom. Recalling the argument of\nThe Ethics of Ambiguity we know why. As Others, women are\nreturned to the metaphysically privileged world of the child. They\nexperience the happiness brought about by bad faith—a happiness\nof not being responsible for themselves, of not having to make\nconsequential choices. From this existential perspective women may be\nsaid to be complicitious in their subjugation. But this is not the\nwhole story. If women are happy as the other, it may be because this\nis the only avenue of happiness open to them given the material and\nideological realities of their situation. Beauvoir’s existential\ncharge of bad faith must be understood within her Marxist analysis of\nthe social, economic and cultural structures that frame women’s\nlives. Though Beauvoir will not argue that these structures deprive\nwomen of their freedom, neither will she ignore the situations that\nmake the exercise of that freedom extremely difficult. Her assertion\nthat woman feels a necessary bond with man regardless of a lack of\nreciprocity, however, escapes existential and Marxist categories. It\nis crucial to Beauvoir’s analysis of women’s condition and\ndraws on the notion of the appeal developed in The Ethics of\nAmbiguity. In making an appeal to others to join me in my pursuit\nof justice I validate myself and my values. Given that my appeal must\nbe an appeal to the other in their freedom, I must allow for the fact\nthat the other may reject it. When this happens, I must (assuming that\nthe rejection is not a threat to the ground value of freedom)\nrecognize the other’s freedom and affirm the bond of humanity\nthat ties us to each other. In the case of women, Beauvoir notes, this\naspect of the appeal (the affirmation of the bond between us)\ndominates. She does not approve of the way that women allow it to\neclipse the requirement that they be recognized as free subjects, but\nshe does alert us to the fact that recognition in itself is not the\nfull story of the ethical relationship. To demand recognition without\nregard for the bond of humanity is unethical. It is the position of\nthe Subject as master. \nMoving between the statement that women are pleased with their\nalienated status as the Other and the question, “How can women\nachieve human fulfillment?”, Beauvoir argues that women’s\nexploitation is historical, and therefore amenable to change. As an\nexistential situation, however, women are responsible for changing it.\nLiberation must be women’s work. It is not a matter of appealing\nto men to give women their freedom, but a matter of women discovering\ntheir solidarity, rejecting the bad faith temptations of happiness and\ndiscovering the pleasures of freedom. Further, though Beauvoir alerts\nus to the tensions and conflicts that this will create between men and\nwomen, she does not envision a permanent war of the sexes. Here her\nHegelian-Marxist optimism prevails. Men will (ultimately) recognize\nwomen as free subjects. \nThe last chapters of The Second Sex, “The Independent\nWoman” and the “Conclusion”, speak of the current\n(1947) status of women’s situation—what has changed and\nwhat remains to be done. Without ignoring the importance of\nwomen’s gaining the right to vote and without dismissing the\nnecessity of women attaining economic independence, Beauvoir finds\nthese liberal and Marxist solutions to women’s situation\ninadequate. They ignore the effects of women’s socialization\n(the subject of volume two of The Second Sex) and they are\ninattentive to the ways that the norm of masculinity remains the\nstandard of the human. The liberated woman must free herself from two\nshackles: first, the idea that to be independent she must be like men,\nand second, the socialization through which she becomes feminized. The\nfirst alienates her from her sexuality. The second makes her adverse\nto risking herself for her ideas/ideals. Attentive to this current\nstate of affairs, and to the phenomenology of the body, Beauvoir sets\ntwo prerequisites for liberation. First, women must be socialized to\nengage the world. Second, they must be allowed to discover the unique\nways that their embodiment engages the world. In short, the myth of\nwoman must be dismantled. So long as it prevails, economic and\npolitical advances will fall short of the goal of liberation. Speaking\nin reference to sexual difference, Beauvoir notes that disabling the\nmyth of woman is not a recipe for an androgynous future. Given the\nrealities of embodiment, there will be sexual differences. Unlike\ntoday, however, these differences will not be used to justify the\ndifference between a Subject and his inessential Other. \nThe goal of liberation, according to Beauvoir, is our mutual\nrecognition of each other as free and as other. She finds one\nsituation in which this mutual recognition (sometimes) exists today,\nthe intimate heterosexual erotic encounter. Speaking of this intimacy\nshe writes, “the dimension of the other\nremains; but the fact is that alterity no longer has a hostile\ncharacter” (SS: 2010, 415, cf. 1949, 189). Why? Because lovers experience\nthemselves and each other ambiguously, that is as both subjects and\nobjects of erotic desire rather than as delineated according to\ninstitutionalized positions of man and woman. In Beauvoir’s\nwords,  \nThe erotic experience is one that most poignantly reveals to human\nbeings their ambiguous condition; they experience it as flesh and as spirit, as the other and as  subject.(SS: 2010, 416, cf. 1949, 190)  \nThe concept of ambiguity, developed abstractly in The Ethics of\nAmbiguity, is erotically embodied in The Second Sex and\nis identified as a crucial piece of the prescription for transcending\nthe oppressions of patriarchy. This description of the liberating\npossibilities of the erotic encounter is also one of those places\nwhere Beauvoir reworks Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology of\nembodiment. For in drawing on Merleau-Ponty’s descriptions of\nthe ways that we are world-making and world-embedded subject-objects,\nshe reveals the ways that it is as subject-objects “for the\nworld”, “to the world”, and “in the\nworld” that we are passionately drawn to each other.  \nWe are a long way away from Pyrrhus and Cinéas, where\nBeauvoir declared our freedom immune from assault. In that early work,\nour freedom insulated us from the risks of intimacy. In The Second\nSex, avoiding these risks remains possible, but now this\navoidance is identified as a mark of our moral failure to live the\nambiguity of our condition. Beauvoir’s essay, “Must We\nBurn Sade?” (1951–52), written in response to a request to\nwrite an introduction to Sade’s Justine, details the\neffects Beauvoir’s changed position on the relationship between\nfreedom and intimacy has on her ethical reflections. The central\nethical question, “the problem of the true relation between man\nand man”, remains unchanged (Bergoffen 2012a, 41, cf. 2012b, 95). Indeed what interests Beauvoir\nabout Sade is that, “[he] posed the problem of the\nother in its most extreme terms”(1965[1963], 243, cf. 1963, 333). What has changed is\nBeauvoir’s understanding of the drama of intersubjectivity.\nMarking this change, this essay also marks a return to the question of\nthe responsibility of the artist raised in The Ethics of\nAmbiguity. \n“Must we Burn Sade?” identifies the Marquis’s\ndecision to write as an existential project, an authentic ethics and a\npolitics of rebellion. Beauvoir credits Sade with uncovering the\ndespotic secrets of the patriarchal political machine. She is\nsympathetic to his utopian appeal to freedom. She finds, however, that\nSade perverted the meaning of freedom. Thus Beauvoir identifies Sade\nas a great moralist who endorsed an unsatisfactory ethics. \nSade is Beauvoir’s Janus-faced ally. She does not refute his\nclaim that cruelty establishes a relationship between the self and the\nother. Sade is correct. Cruelty reveals us to each other in the\nparticularities and ambiguities of our conscious and fleshed\nexistence. The tyrant and victim, Beauvoir tells us, are a genuine\ncouple. They are united by the bonds of the flesh and freedom. \nSade is the epitome of maniacal passion dedicated to the project of\ncruelty. Because he takes full responsibility for his choices, he must\nbe credited with choosing freedom and accepted as being authentically\nethical. This does not, however, make him either an ethical or moral\nfigure; for his choices destroy the intersubjective bonds of humanity.\nThough his account of the power of cruelty provides a convincing\ncritique of our social, political and personal hypocrisies, it does\nnot critique the ways that cruelty is a perversion of freedom and an\nexploitation of the vulnerability of the flesh. Thus his descriptions\nof the powers of cruelty and the meaning of torture are incomplete and\ninadequate. The case of the Marquis de Sade makes it clear that\nauthenticity, assuming responsibility for one’s choices, is a\nnecessary, but not sufficient, condition of an existential ethics of\nfreedom.  \nIn the end, Beauvoir finds that Sade was misled (which does not mean\nthat he was innocent). He mistook power for freedom and misunderstood\nthe meanings of the erotic. In his fascination with the conflict\nbetween consciousness and the flesh, Sade exposed the failure of the\nsadistic enterprise; for in attempting to lose himself in the\npleasures of the flesh and in this way to experience both the\nambiguity of his being as consciousness made flesh (or flesh made\nconsciousness) and the reality of his being for and with others, Sade\nsubstitutes the spectacle for the lived experience and accepts\ncounterfeit transactions of domination and assimilation/incorporation\nfor genuine relationships of reciprocity and gratuitous generosity. He\nnever reaches the other. \nCentering his life in the erotic, Sade missed the truth of the erotic.\nThis truth, Beauvoir tells us, can only be found by those who abandon\nthemselves to the risks of emotional intoxication. Living this\nintoxication we discover the ways that the body turned flesh dissolves\nall arguments against the immediacy of our bonds with each other and\ngrounds an ethic of the appeal, risk and mutual vulnerability. \nBetween the early Pyrrhus and Cinéas and the later\n“Must We Burn Sade?” we discern the impact of what might\nbe called Beauvoir’s phenomenological turn to the body. Once she\nabandons the idea that our freedom, as absolutely internal, is immune\nfrom an assault by the other, and accepts the radical vulnerability of\nour lived embodiment, questions of violence and desire cannot be\nsevered from the question of our shared humanity or questions of\nethics and justice. In condemning Sade for his perversion of the\nerotic, Beauvoir also faults him as an artist. Though she accuses him\nof being a technically poor writer, the heart of her criticism is\nethical not aesthetic. Sade, according to Beauvoir, violated his\nobligations as an author. Instead of revealing the world to us in its\npromise and possibilities, and instead of appealing to us to work for\njustice, he took refuge in the imaginary and developed metaphysical\njustifications for suffering and cruelty. In the end, Beauvoir accuses\nSade of being the serious man described in her Ethics of\nAmbiguity. \nIn 1962, Beauvoir and Gisile Halimi co-authored the story of Djamila\nBoupacha, an Algerian girl accused of being a terrorist and tortured\nby the French during the French-Algerian War. This book may be read as\nan extension of Beauvoir’s critique of the Marquis de Sade.\nInstead of fleeing from the horrors of the real into the safety of the\nimaginary, Beauvoir takes up her responsibility as an author to expose\nand confront realities that the state would rather hide. Her purpose\nin writing is concrete and political. The book is both a protest and\nan appeal. Countering Sade, Beauvoir and Halimi show that the truth of\ntorture lies in the unjustifiable politics of abusive power.  \nThe ways that the phenomenological turn to the body becomes\nincreasingly important in Beauvoir’s work, and the ways that\nthis turn heightens Beauvoir’s sensitivity to the materialities\nof our situated freedom and to the power of the category of the Other,\nmay be traced in Beauvoir’s attention to the question of human\nfinitude. This question is raised early in her 1946 novel, All Men\nAre Mortal, the story of Fosca, a man who chooses to cheat death.\nHis desire for immortality, however, is driven by his desire to\nrealize the abstract ideal of humanism. Fosca does not embrace\nimmortality to escape the ambiguities of the flesh and embodiment. His\ndecision is motivated by his desire to save the world. He believes\nthat time is his enemy so long as his time is limited. He believes\nthat with sufficient time he can take the humanist a project, bring it\nto closure and secure it from failure.  \nFosca learns, however, that contrary to his initial belief, time\nbecomes his enemy when it stretches endlessly before him. It is not\ntime that he needs to secure his vision, but the commitment of others.\nNo amount of time can secure that. As immortal, Fosca confronts the\ninevitability of failure that haunts humanity. Unlike mortals,\nhowever, who, confronted with the constraints of time, take up their\nfailures with passion, Fosca becomes immobilized. Indifference to life\nreplaces the passion for life. In the end, he discovers the crucial\ntruth of ethical action from his many-generations-removed grandson,\nArmand. Understanding that the future belongs to others who may or may\nnot take up his projects, Armand commits himself to the concrete\npossibilities of the present. His passion is embodied in the appeal to\nothers, not in an abstract goal that, however just it might seem,\nwould deny future generations the right to determine their own\ndestiny.  \nIn All Men Are Mortal the givenness of finitude and death\nconcerns our relationship to time. Eighteen years later, writing about\nthe dying and death of her mother in A Very Easy Death\n(1964); six years after that, analyzing the situation of the aged in\nComing of Age (1970), and eleven years subsequent to that,\nchronicling Sartre’s last days in Adieux: A Farewell to\nSartre (1981), it is not so much our relationship to time but\nmore a matter of our embodiment that concerns Beauvoir. In A Very\nEasy Death and Adieux, Beauvoir assumes the position of\nthe phenomenological witness. The bodies of her mother and Sartre are\ngiven to us in all their disturbing breakdowns and deteriorations.\nSome have found these works cold, insensitive and even cruel. They\nmiss Beauvoir’s point. She is showing us who we are. The\n“I can” body revealed by other phenomenologists as a\ncrucial mark of embodiment is the limited condition of the mature\nhealthy body. It is but one phase of the life of the body. In its\nearly days the body is still learning its “I can’s”.\nAs we age, the body begins losing them. It is one thing, as with the\nmyth of woman, to alienate an “I can” from its capacities.\nIt is quite another to refuse to attend to the full range of embodied\nlife and to assess the value of that life in terms of its I can\npossibilities. \nWe need to read A Very Easy Death and Adieux within\nthe context of the analyses of The Coming of Age to fully\nappreciate Beauvoir’s role as witness. The project of The\nComing of Age is similar to that of The Second Sex. Like\nThe Second Sex, it focuses on a group of people designated as\nOther; like The Second Sex it exposes the mythical status of\nthe “facts” about aging and the aged; and like The\nSecond Sex it indicts society for its dehumanization of those it\ndesignates as Other. The Coming of Age also emulates The\nSecond Sex in its method and scope. It trains a phenomenological\nlens on biological, psychological and sociological factors in order to\nunderstand the phenomenon of marginalized otherness. In many ways,\nhowever, The Coming of Age corrects what Beauvoir sees as the\nflaw of The Second Sex. \nIn reflecting on The Second Sex, Beauvoir says that were she\nto write it again she would pay less attention to the abstract issue\nof consciousness and more attention to the material conditions of\nscarcity. Though it is impossible to say what a revised version of\nThe Second Sex would look like, The Coming of Age\ngives us some idea of how it might read. There is no talk here of the\naged. Reminding us that old age is our universal destiny, Beauvoir\ntells us that its lived meaning is specific to our historical, class\nand cultural situations. Where The Second Sex identifies the\nways that the myth of woman hides the diversity of women and does not\nseem to see that the single category of the inessential Other may not\ncapture the diverse meanings of women’s situations, The\nComing of Age keeps making the point that if we speak of old age\nas a universal category we will miss the crucial differences among the\naged that the myths and images of aging hide. \nComparing the status of the aged to that of women as woman, Beauvoir\nnotes that both occupy the position of the Other and that as Other\nboth are subject to the powers of mythical, exploitive biologies.\nThough The Coming of Age pays closer attention to the\ndiversity behind the unifying myths and works with a somewhat\ndifferent conception of otherness, it sounds remarkably similar to\nThe Second Sex as it traces the sources of the marginal\nstatus of the aged. While The Second Sex accused patriarchy\nof depriving women of their subject status by barring them from the\nproject and devaluating the fleshed experience of the erotic, The\nComing of Age argues that the non-subject status of the aged can\nbe traced to the fact that they are barred from their projects and\ntheir erotic possibilities. “The old man”, Beauvoir writes, “looks to active members of the community like one of a ‘different species’” because he is not engaged in a\nproject (1972[1970], 217, cf. 1970, 231).  \nLike The Second Sex, which attended to the givens of biology\nwithout allowing them to determine the meaning of the subject, The\nComing of Age also gives biology its due. The lack of engagement\nof the aged, Beauvoir notes, is in part imposed from without and in\npart comes from within; for as we age, the body is transformed from an\ninstrument that engages the world into a hindrance that makes our\naccess to the world difficult. The point of The Coming of\nAge, however, is that it is unjust to use these difficulties to\njustify reducing the aged to the status of the Other.\nAdieux’s witnessing makes this point clearly. However\ndiminished Sartre’s body became, it never severed him from his\nprojects. He could not have sustained his work by himself, but he was\nin a situation where others refused to marginalize him. They did not\nequate his diminished bodily capacities with a diminished humanity.\nThe Coming of Age argues that the situation of a privileged\nSartre ought to be our common destiny. \nIn a world which recognized the phenomenological truth of the body,\nthe existential truth of freedom, the Marxist truth of exploitation\nand the human truth of the bond, the derogatory category of the Other\nwould be eradicated. Neither the aged nor women, nor anyone by virtue\nof their race, class, ethnicity or religion would find themselves\nrendered inessential. Beauvoir knows that it is too much to hope for\nsuch a world. She understands the lures of domination and violence.\nThroughout her career, however, she used philosophical and literary\ntools to reveal the possibilities of such a world and appealed to us\nto work for it.","contact.mail":"burkemeg@sonoma.edu","contact.domain":"sonoma.edu"}]
