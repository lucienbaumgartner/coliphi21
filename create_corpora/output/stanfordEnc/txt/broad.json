Broad’s early interests were in science and\nmathematics. Despite being successful in these he came to believe that\nhe would never be a first-rate scientist, and turned to philosophy.\nBroad’s interests were exceptionally wide-ranging. He devoted his\nphilosophical acuity to the mind-body problem, the nature of\nperception, memory, introspection, and the unconscious, to the nature\nof space, time and causation. He also wrote extensively on the\nphilosophy of probability and induction, ethics, the history of\nphilosophy and the philosophy of religion. The ample scope and scale of\nBroad’s work is impressive In addition he nourished an interest\nin parapsychology—a subject he approached with the\ndisinterested curiosity and scrupulous care that is characteristic of\nhis philosophical work.\n\n\n\nBroad did not have “a philosophy”—if by that\nphrase is meant highly original philosophical theories, and a highly\noriginal way of approaching philosophical problems. He writes: “I\nhave nothing worth calling a system of philosophy of my own, and there\nis no philosopher of whom I should be willing to reckon myself a\nfaithful follower” (1924, p. 77). The reader is nonetheless\nlikely to reap philosophical insights from Broad’s manner of\nmeticulously setting out and carefully assessing the theories that\nprima facie provide solutions to a given philosophical\nproblem. This feature of his writings is aptly described by A. J. Ayer:\n“The subject is discussed from every angle, the various\npossibilities judiciously set out, the precedents cited, the fallacious\narguments exposed: nothing is skimped: looking for reason, we are not\nfobbed off with rhetoric” (Part of my Life, 1977, pp.\n117–8). Broad combines fairness, astuteness as well as rare powers of\nobservation.\n\n\n\nPhilosophers who influenced Broad were (apart from the great\nphilosophers of the past) his teachers at Cambridge, Russell and Moore,\nand J. M. E. McTaggart and W. E. Johnson; at St. Andrew’s he\nreceived important additional influence from G. F. Stout and A. E.\nTaylor. The diversity of their thought is mirrored in Broad’s own\nexceptional range of interests.\n\n\n\nBroad led a relatively uneventful life—“not unlike,”\nhe says in his “Autobiography,” “that of a monk in a\nmonastery” (1959b, p. 67). He hadn’t been out of the British\nIsles until 1946 when he visited Sweden—a country he “fell\nin love with,” and returned to nearly every year. On a\nprofessional level he made acquaintances with several Swedish\nphilosophers (such as Konrad-Marc Wogau at Uppsala University).  In\nthe academic year 1953–4 Broad visited the University of\nMichigan at Ann Arbor and the University of California at Los\nAngeles. He writes with great warmth of the “kindness and\nhospitality” with which he was received, and adds with\ncharacteristic modesty: “It was good fun to be treated as a\ngreat philosopher” (1959b). Broad was a homosexual, and never\nmarried.\n\n\n\nBroad dealt with perception in several works. He is well known as an\nadvocate of The Theory of Representational Realism, according to which\nour perceptions are indirect cognitive transactions with the\nworld: a perceptual experience of a worldly object is not an immediate\nawareness of the object itself, but mediated by an immediate awareness\nof a sensum. For example, when we see a coin from a certain\nangle we are immediately aware of an elliptical sensum. \n\nBroad’s treatment of perception in The Mind and Its Place\nin Nature sets off with a careful description of Naïve\nRealism. And this seems a suitable place to begin our exposition of his\ntheory of perception. What, then, does Naïve Realism say? To\npre-philosophical reflection perception seem to provide us with some\nsort of immediate cognitive contact with a physical object, for example\na bell. Consider a situation where we perceive a bell. Compare this\nsituation with one where we are merely thinking of a bell. There is a\ndeep difference between the situations. We could “vaguely express\none part of this difference by saying that in the perceptual situation\nwe are ‘in more immediate touch with’ the bell than in the\nthought-situation” (1925, p. 144). \n\nThis rough and ready picture of the Naïve Realist view must,\nhowever, be slightly modified. Suppose we visually perceive an apple.\nClearly there is a sense in which we do not perceive “all”\nof the apple. There is a sense in which we are aware of only a\npart of its surface; and we are (in that sense) aware only of\nthe sensible colour of that part but not of its sensible temperature.\nThus perception provides us with a cognitive contact a part of the\napple, but no more. It is, then, strictly speaking only a part of the\napple with which we are acquainted; it is only a part of the\napple that is sensuously manifested to us. (1925, pp.\n148–50.) \n\nBroad does not equate or identify the perception of a worldly object\nwith the sort of immediate acquainting awareness we have (or seem to\nhave) with its facing surface (pace Chisholm, 1957, p. 154).\nHe is, on the contrary, careful to point out that the experience\nfeatures more than this awareness: it also has an intentional\ncontent. Broad designates this the external reference of\nthe experience. By virtue of its external reference the experience of\nthe apple represents the sensuously manifested constituent as an\nintegral part of a larger spatio-temporal whole, having a whole array\nof properties not sensuously manifested to us. (1925, pp. 150–4.) \n\nWhat is the nature of the external reference? Broad warns against\nthe risk of unduly “intellectualising” perception. The\nexternal reference is not reached by inference from what is\nsensuously manifested; nor is it a belief or\njudgement simply accompanying the awareness of the manifested\nconstituent: “At the purely perceptual level, people do not have\nthe special experience called ‘belief’ or\n‘judgment’” (1925, p.\n 153).[1] \n\nWhen we visually perceive the apple we have an experience in which\nits facing red surface is a sensuously manifested objective\nconstituent; we perceive the apple but are, strictly speaking, only\nacquainted with a portion of\n it.[2]\nBroad sometimes prefers to say that we\nprehend the facing surface (or ostensibly prehend the\nsurface). Now the notion of prehension is fundamental for an\nunderstanding of Naïve Realism as well as Representational\nRealism, so it seems advisable to briefly take a somewhat closer look\non Broad’s account of it. \n\nBroad does not think it is possible to give a strict definition of\nphrases such as “S prehends x as red” or\nthe equivalent phrase “x sensibly presents itself to\nS as\n red”.[3]\nWhat one can do is to contrast the notion of\nprehension with other notions: “The meaning of these phrases\ncannot be defined, it can only be exemplified. One thing that is\ncertain is that to prehend x as red is utterly different from\njudging that it is red or knowing that it is\nred” (1952a, p. 13; italics in original). For example, in the\ndark and with my eyes shut I may very well judge (or know) that the\napple is red. But in such conditions I am “not prehending\nanything as red, or, what is precisely equivalent, nothing is sensibly\npresented to me as red” (ibid, p. 14). Broad notes that\nthis is substantiated by the fact that a cat or a dog that lacked\nconcepts might, it seems, have a prehension of something as red even\nthough it cannot (lacking the requisite concepts) literally know or\njudge that it is red. \n\nPrehension is, however, intimately related to knowledge. Broad asks\nus to consider a subject “which has appropriate general concepts\nand is capable of making judgements and knowing facts”. Suppose\nthis subject prehends a certain particular object as red. Then this\n“suffices to enable him to know the fact that it is red.\nWhether he does or does not actually contemplate this fact at\nthe time depends on various contingent circumstances” (1952a, p.\n14; Broad’s\n emphasis).[4] \n\nNaïve Realism, properly articulated, says that when we perceive\na physical object it is only a part of the apple that is sensuously\nmanifested to us: this, and only this, is an objective constituent in\nthe perceptual situation. Now can this view be defended? Broad does not\nthink so. He levels several arguments against Naïve Realism, two\nof which will receive attention here. \n\nThe Argument from Hallucination. Consider a\nveridical perception and compare it with a subjectively\nindistinguishable delusive or hallucinatory perception, for example\nthat of a drunkard hallucinating a pink rat. Neither a pink rat nor a\npart of a pink rat could be a sensuously manifested constituent in the\ndelusive situation. \n\nIt might be held that the subjective indistinguishability of a\nveridical perceptual and a hallucinatory situation entails\nthat the experiences have an identical constitution (and that,\ntherefore, no material object is a constituent even in the veridical\nsituation). That is, however, not Broad’s position: it\ncould be that a material object is an objectively\nmanifested constituent in a veridical situation (whilst not in the\nindistinguishable hallucinatory situation). He holds, however, that\nthat is not the more reasonable view of the matter. \n\nThe Argument from Illusion. Consider a person perceiving a\npenny from a series of slightly different angles and distances. He\nwould unhesitatingly assume that in each of the slightly differing\nperceptual situations the facing brownish surface of a certain penny is\nsensuously manifested to him. But in Broad’s view this could not\nbe so: “If he carefully inspects the objective constituents of\nthese perceptual situations he will certainly find that they seem to be\nof different shapes and sizes” (1925, p. 158). The objective\nconstituent will in most of the situations seem elliptical\nrather than circular. This indicates, Broad claims, that in each\nperceptual situation, the constituent—the sensuously manifested\nitem—cannot be the top of the penny. What happens is that\ninstead of being immediately aware of the circular surface of the penny\n(as he takes himself to be) he is immediately aware of an elliptical\nitem, an elliptical sensum. Hence it is an elliptical sensum rather\nthan the circular surface of the penny that is manifested to the\nsubject. The same holds mutatis mutandis when we perceive a\nwhite sheet of paper dimly lit by a candle. On careful consideration it\nseems clear that the paper looks yellowish to us. So what we are\nimmediately aware of is a yellowish sensum rather than the white sheet\nof paper we are looking at. \n\nIn order to bring out at least some of the facets of Broad’s\ntheory it seems advisable to turn to a few of the many objections that\nhave been raised against it. \n\n(1) It has sometimes been objected that the argument from illusion\nis flawed from the start since there is usually no risk of anyone being\ntaken in by the situation. Broad’s response to this objection is\nclear. When we look at the penny from an oblique angle it appears\nelliptical, but not in the sense that anyone is taking in by\nthe situation, and mistakenly comes to believe or judge that the penny\nis elliptical. He is explicit on the point: “‘looking\nelliptical to me’ stands for a peculiar experience, which,\nwhatever the right analysis of it may be, is not just a mistaken\njudgement about the shape” (1923, p. 237). The penny sensibly\nappears elliptical. And it is this rather than any supposed\ntendency to be deceived which creates problem for Naïve Realism\n(pace Austin 1962, p. 26). \n\n(2) It has often been objected that philosophers who have made use\nof the argument from illusion that they neglect the fact of\nperceptual constancy. In his later works Broad admits that\nthis complaint is justified. However, the “recognition of the\nphenomenon of constancy merely shifts the point of application of the\nargument” (1947b, p. 112). There is a class of perceptual\nexperiences of a material object, X, where constancy holds;\nthere is also a class of experiences of X where constancy\nbreaks down. In theory it is logically possible to hold that the facing\nsurface of X is sensuously presented in the perceptual\nexperiences belonging to the first class but not in the experiences\nbelonging to the second class. “But, in view of the continuity\nbetween the most normal and the most abnormal cases of seeing, such a\ndoctrine would be utterly implausible and could be defended only by the\nmost desperate special pleading” (1952a, p. 9). \n\nWhat I just said might create the impression that Broad’s\nphenomenology is rather unsophisticated or crude. On the whole that is\ncertainly not the case. For example, he points out that “the\nvisual field” is three-dimensional: “A sphere does\nlook different from a circle, just as a circle looks different\nfrom an ellipse” (1923, p. 290; Broad’s emphasis). And the\nsame holds, mutatis mutandis, for the intimately related\ncharacteristics distance and depth; these are also purely visual\ncharacteristics of the visual field (pp.\n 295–300).[5] \n\n(The constancy objection to any argument of illusion that appeals to\ncases such as the penny seen obliquely is a compelling one, to say the\nleast. In spite of that I will, for convenience of exposition,\noccasionally make use of the example below.) \n\n(3) A stock objection to sense-data theories has been that they\ninvite scepticism with regard to the external world. Broad regrets the\nsceptical consequences but—given the strength of the case for\nthe sense-datum theory—does not consider them sufficient\ngrounds for dismissal. Seeking to preserve as much as possible of the\ncommon sense notion of material objects he argues for the existence of\nsuch objects conceived of as having “primary qualities”\nsuch as shape, size, and position (apart from such properties as\nelectric charge and mass). (1925, pp. 195–204.) Not surprisingly, he\nrejects the idea that material objects have “secondary\nproperties” such as (phenomenal) redness or (phenomenal) hotness.\nBroad is perfectly clear that it does not follow from the fact\nthat such properties are never sensuously manifested in our perceptual\nexperiences that the material objects causing our experiences lack\nthese properties: it does remain possible that there are red and green,\nhot and cold material objects even though they are not objects of\nacquaintance. He argues, however, that there is no reason to believe\nthat material objects have these properties. (1925, pp. 205–6.) \n\nNow Broad is perfectly clear that the sensum analysis of perception\ncannot be established simply by pointing to such phenomena as the penny\nseen obliquely. He does not for a moment suppose that it is possible to\nlogically infer that there is an elliptical sensum from the proposition\nthat something sensibly appears elliptical (pace Barnes 1945,\np. 113). What he claims is that there are considerations that can be\nadduced in support of the sensum analysis. When we look at the penny\nfrom the side we certainly seem to be aware of something\nelliptical. So we certainly seem to have before our minds something\nthat is elliptical. Obviously “we can quite well mistakenly\nbelieve a property to be present which is really absent, when\nwe are dealing with something that is only known to us indirectly, like\nJulius Cæsar or the North Pole” (1923, p. 241;\nBroad’s emphasis). But there are phenomenological differences\nbetween perception and belief (or thought) that seem to call for\ndifferent accounts of their nature. In perception we seem to be dealing\nwith properties that are presented to us. Consider the case of\nperceiving a stick half immersed in water. Here \n\nI believe that what Broad is driving at here is that perceptual\nconsciousness has a presentational nature, and it is this that\nmakes it plausible to regard it as involving the literal presence of\nobjects with various qualities, such as colours in the case of visual\nperception, sounds in auditory, etc. \n\nBroad’s theory of perception employs an act-object analysis of\nsensations. Lest it should be thought that he should be incapable to\nthink of any alternative account it should be noted that he examines\nsuch an analysis as early as in 1921. G. F. Stout and H. A. Prichard\ndefended such an alternative (both of whom Broad held in the highest\nregard). Their account could be considered an early version of the\nadverbial analysis of sensations. Broad asks us to consider a\nheadache. “It is by no means clear that a headache means a state\nof mind with a headachy object [i.e. an act with a certain object]; it\nseems on the whole more plausible to say that that it is just a\nheadachy state of mind” (1921b, p. 392). To have a headache is\nnot to be aware of a headachy object but to feel in a certain\n way.[6]\nThe alternative\naccount claims that this holds mutatis mutandis for\nany type of sensation. Thus what is described as ‘a\nsensation of red’ is a unitary state of mind, and strictly\nspeaking not a state which decomposes into an act of sensing and a\nsensed red patch. \n\nBroad provides a fairly thorough discussion of the relative merits\nof the adverbial and the act-object analysis. In a nutshell, his\nconclusion is that although the adverbial analysis is highly plausible\nregarding such mental phenomena as bodily feelings; but it is\nimplausible when it comes to those of visual and auditory experiences:\nthe act-object analysis is the more plausible account of such\nexperiences, in Broad’s opinion. (See Broad 1923, pp.\n 252–7.)[7] \n\nSo much for sensations. What about sensa? What are they on\nBroad’s account? A brief answer must suffice here. Sensa are a\ncertain kind of transitory particulars, which in the case of visual\nperception have such properties as shape, size, colour, etc (1925,\np.\n 181f.).[8] \n\nThe position Broad reaches is the following. A perceptual experience\nhas a certain intentional content. It differs from thought- and\nbelief-episodes by including a sensory phase, and it is primarily this\nthat is responsible for the distinctive phenomenology of perception.\nThe sensory phase consists of sensations. These decompose into acts of\nsensing and object sensed, sensa. A sensum has the phenomenal\nproperties that the perceived object (sensibly) appears to\nhave—red or warm or squeaky. An act of sensing a sensum\nconstitutes an immediate acquainting awareness of the sensum in\nquestion. Although our perceptual experiences seem to grant\nus an acquaintance with the facing surfaces of material objects, sensa\nare the only items we are acquainted with. \n\nThe intentional content—the external reference—of a\nperceptual experience is in a certain sense based upon sensa\n(thought not in the sense that there is a train of swift\ninference leading from the presence of a sensum to the mind to a\ncertain perceptual belief). (1923, pp. 246–7.) It is this content which\nrepresents the environment as featuring a physical object so-and-so.\nSensa are clearly incapable of carrying such content. Furthermore, from\nthe very nature of the case the general notion of physical object\n“cannot have been derived by abstraction from observed\ninstances of it, as the notion of ‘red’ no doubt\nhas\n been.”[9]\nIn\nfact, general concept of a physical object “is not ‘got out\nof’ experience until it has been ‘put into’\nexperience. It is best described as an innate principle of\ninterpretation which we apply to the data of sense-perception”\n(1925, p. 217). \n\nIt is possible to distinguish roughly three different phases in\nBroad’s philosophy of time. \n\nIn his (1921a) Broad defends a Russellian theory of time. On this\nEternalist view past, present, and future are equally real.\nThere is nothing ontologically special about the present: the present\nis no more real than the past or the future. Accordingly Broad rejects\nPresentism—the view that only the present is real—as\n“mere rhetoric rooted in confusion” (1921a, p. 226).\nPresentism has its roots in two errors. One of these errors is to\nequivocate between two different senses of “co-existence”.\n“In one sense the parts of any related whole co-exist; in another\nonly those events that occupy the same moment of time co-exist.”\nThe whole course of the history obviously cannot co-exist in the latter\nsense, but this does not “prevent it from co-existing in the\nfirst”. The other error is to believe that “past, present,\nand future are essential characteristics of objects in time in the same\nway as before and after are, instead of being analysable into the\ntemporal relations of states of mind and their objects” (p. 337).\nThus Broad rejects the view that past, present, and future are\ncharacteristics possessed by objects in time. These\n“characteristics” are a mere reflection of our subjective\nperspective on objects. Some of our mental states are essentially\ncontemporary or simultaneous with their objects, e.g. our\nimmediate awareness of sense data. Other states are essentially\nlater than their objects, e.g. memories. (Cf. p. 336.) A\nrelated, and perhaps more important facet of Broad’s (1921a)\nposition here, is his adoption of a Russellian analysis of tensed\ndiscourse. According to this analysis—versions of which were\nlater to become orthodox—the function of tensed verbs or\ntemporal adjectives in tensed statements is performed in the analysans\nby a tenseless copula, IS, and a temporal relation—earlier\nthan, simultaneous with, or later than. Thus\n“It is raining” (or “It is raining now”) is\nunpacked as “It IS raining at a moment simultaneous with my\nassertion that it is raining”; “It has rained” (or\n“It rained in the past”) is analysed as “It IS\nraining at a moment earlier than my assertion that it has\nrained”; “It will rain” (or “It will rain in\nthe future”) is read as “It IS raining at a moment later\nthan my assertion that it will rain”. (Cf. p. 331.) \n\nIn Scientific Thought (1923) Broad rejects the Eternalism\nhe had defended in his (1921a) article. He now advances a theory that\n“accepts the reality of the present and the past, but holds that\nthe future is simply nothing at all” (1923, p. 66). An\nall-important corollary of this Growing Block Theory is the\nthesis that temporal passage is a fundamental feature of\nreality. This feature is accounted for in terms of what Broad holds is\nthe most fundamental form of change, becoming. Becoming is the\ncoming into existence of events. \n\nAn  event is present by virtue of being the most recent\nincrement of reality; when the event is present there is, as Broad\nsays, nothing to which it stands in the relation of precedence. The\nevent becomes past by virtue of acquiring new relations, and\nit acquires these relations because the sum total of existence has been\nincreased by the addition of fresh slices of reality. Temporal passage\nis the continual growth of the sum total of existence. \n\nOne of the rivalling views on time Broad discusses is a theory that\nmight be labeled The Moving Spotlight Theory. The Moving\nSpotlight Theory accepts the eternalist view that the past, the\npresent, and the future are equally real; it regards “the history\nof the world as existing eternally in a certain order of events.”\nBut it differs from the Russellian theory in that it accepts presentness\nas an irreducible feature of reality. So the fact that the leaf is\nfalling now is not to be analysed as the fact that the event is\nsimultaneous with an utterance or a specific type of mental state. The\ntheory claims that presentness is a characteristic moving along the\norder of events: “Along [the order of events], and in a fixed\ndirection, […] the characteristic of presentness [is] moving,\nsomewhat like the spot of light from a policeman’s\nbull’s-eye traversing the fronts of the houses in a street. What\nis illuminated is the present, what has been illuminated is the past,\nand what has not yet been illuminated is the future” (1923, p.\n59). \n\nBroad is critical of this theory. To understand the nature of time,\nThe Moving Spotlight Theory makes use of a spatial analogy. Such\nanalogies “may be useful for some purposes, but it is clear that\nthey explain nothing.” Firstly, Broad asks us to consider the\nsuccessive lighting of presentness—now on one event and now on\nanother, and so on. This is itself an event (or a series of\nevents), “and ought therefore to be a part of the series of\nevents, and not simply something that happens to the latter from\noutside” (1923, p. 60). If we suppose (as we seem compelled to)\nthat it is not a part of the original series of events, we are\nlaunched on a vicious regress of time-dimensions. For then the\nsuccessive lightning of later events would have to be conceived of as\nan event of the second order—happening in a\ntime-dimension different from the original one formed by the series of\nfirst-order events. Secondly he presents a related line of\nreasoning—sometimes termed The Rate of Passage\nArgument: If anything moves, it must move with some determinate\nvelocity. It will always be sensible to ask ‘How fast does it\nmove?’ But since the series along which presentness is supposed\nto move is itself temporal, this question becomes: ‘how great a\nlapse of time 1 does presentness traverse in a unit of time 2?’\nAgain, a regress of time-dimensions is imminent. (Both of these\narguments receive a clearer formulation and more extensive treatment\nin Broad (1938).)[10] \n\nBroad’s later account of time differs in some significant\nrespects from both of the earlier accounts. He now views what he calls\nabsolute becoming as “the rock-bottom peculiarity of\ntime”. Absolute becoming manifests itself “as the continual\nsupersession of what was the latest phase by a new phase,\nwhich will in turn be superseded by another new one. This seems to me\nto be the rock-bottom peculiarity of time, distinguishing temporal\nsequence from all other instances of one-dimensional order, such\nas that of points on a line, numbers in order of magnitude, and so\non” (1959, p. 766). \n\nThis theory has, in Broad’s opinion, various advantages. One\nadvantage mentioned is that it seems to avoid the difficulties with the\nrate of times passage—difficulties which besets\nthe Moving Spotlight Theory, but arguably also the Growing Block\nTheory. The proposed theory also avoids presupposing that “what\nhas not yet supervened and what has already been superseded in some\nsense ‘co-exist’ with each other and with what is now\noccurring,” which he views as a defect of the Moving Spotlight\nTheory. More interestingly, it avoids what Broad now regards as a\ndefect of the Growing Block Theory, viz. that of presupposing\n“that phases, which have already supervened and been superseded,\nin some sense ‘co-exist’ with each other and with that\nwhich is now happening” (1959, p. 767). \n\nBroad discusses the topic of free will in his inaugural lecture\n“Determinism, Indeterminism, and Libertarianism” (1934). In\nthis rather dense lecture he approaches the issue by associating free\nwill with moral responsibility. More specifically, he frames it in\nterms of the conditions necessary and sufficient for the applicability\nof ‘ought’ and ‘ought not’ to actions. Everyone\nadmits, he says, that there is some sense of ‘could’ in\nwhich ‘ought’ and ‘ought not’ entail\n‘could’. The question revolves around the sense of\n‘could’ involved here: in precisely what sense of\n‘could’ is it that if you to ought to perform an action you\ncould perform that action? \n\nLet us introduce a couple of Broad’s stipulative definitions.\nAn action is obligable if and only if it is an action of which\n‘ought to be done’ or ‘ought not to be done’\ncan be predicated. An action is substitutable if either it was\ndone but could have been left undone, or was left undone but could have\nbeen done. \n\nAn action is obligable if and only if it is, in a certain sense,\nsubstitutable. There are several different senses of\n‘could’ and hence of substitutability. Initially Broad\nfocuses on a sense of ‘could’ which he calls voluntary\nsubstitutability. Consider an action A that was not\nperformed. Suppose that if the agent had willed (chosen,\ndecided) to do A she would have done it. In that case\nA is voluntarily substitutable. Suppose, however, that she\nwould not have done A even if she had willed to do it. If\nthat’s the case, A is not voluntarily substitutable.\nBroad takes it as evident that voluntary substitutability is a\nnecessary condition for obligability. That is, he takes it as evident\nthat, \n\nBut is it also a sufficient condition? Is it also true\nthat, \n\nBroad presents an argument in favour of a negative answer, i.e. in\nfavour of the answer that it could very well be true that someone would\nhave done an action if he had willed to do it, while it is nonetheless\nfalse that the action is obligable (and hence false that it is\nvoluntarily substitutable). We are asked to consider a person who\ngradually becomes addicted to a drug like morphine. At the earlier\nstages he could have willed with sufficient strength to ensure that the\ntemptation would have been resisted. At the later stages he could not.\n“Now at every stage, from the earliest to the latest, the\nhypothetical proposition would be true: ‘If he had willed with a\ncertain degree of force and persistence to avoid taking morphine, he\nwould have avoided taking it’. Yet we would say at the earlier\nstages that he ought to have resisted, whilst at the final stages we\nshould be inclined to say that ‘ought’ and ‘ought\nnot’ have ceased to apply” (1934, p. 200). In other words,\nin the later stages we are inclined to hold that the action of\nabstaining from morphine has ceased to be obligable, in spite of the\nfact that it remains true that if he had willed with\nsufficient force and persistence to abstain he would have\nabstained. \n\nThis is Broad’s version of an argument sometimes raised\nagainst the classical compatibilist conditional analysis of\n‘S could have done\n otherwise’.[11]\nAccording to the classical\ncompatibilist analysis this is to be understood simply as ‘if\nS had willed to act differently S would have acted\ndifferently’. The argument shows that this will not do: there are\nsituations where an agent would have acted otherwise if she\nhad willed differently but nonetheless could not have acted differently\nsimply because she could not have willed to act\n differently.[12] \n\nSo voluntary substitutability is not sufficient for obligability:\nfor an action to be obligable it is not sufficient that the agent would\nhave acted otherwise if she had willed otherwise. It is also clear that\na further condition must be fulfilled, viz. that she could have\nwilled to act otherwise. This leads us to the question as to the\ncorrect analysis of ‘could have willed differently’. Broad\nexamines a conditional analysis according to which this means: \n\nCan we perhaps claim an action to be obligable if (a) it is\nvoluntarily substitutable, and (b) the agent could have willed to do\nit, in the specified conditional sense of ‘could have\nwilled’? In other words, is the joint condition of (a) and (b)\nsufficient for obligability? Broad rejects this proposal. Suppose the\nagent could not have willed differently in the past (say six\nmonths ago). It is “surely irrelevant to say that, if he\nhad done so his conative dispositions would have been\ndifferent at a later stage from what they in fact were then, and that\nhe would have willed otherwise than he then did” (1934,\np. 204). As he points out, at this juncture it is tempting to refer to\nstill earlier volitions (say twelve months ago). He contends, however,\nthat this is useless since the very same difficulty will reappear. \n\nBroad holds, then, that neither ‘could have acted\ndifferently’ nor ‘could have willed\ndifferently’ can be given a conditional analysis. Having\ndiscarded conditional types of substitutability he turns to\ncategorical substitutability. If an action is obligable it\nmust be substitutable in a categorical sense. “We must be able to\nsay of an action, which was done, that it could have been avoided, in\nsome sense of ‘could’ which is not definable in terms of\n‘would have, if’” (1934, p. 204). Note that the\nquoted passage merely states that categorical substitutability is a\nnecessary condition of obligability. It is clear, however,\nthat Broad also takes it to be a sufficient condition. Thus, his\nposition is that, \n\nNow precisely what is categorical substitutability? As we\nshall presently see, Broad claims that this notion is only partly\nintelligible. \n\nCategorical substitutability involves a negative and a positive\ncondition. These are necessary and jointly sufficient for obligability.\nThe negative condition says that the agent’s willing of\na certain action was not completely determined by the nomic and\nsingular conditions which existed at the time of willing. Not\nsurprisingly, Broad regards an action that merely fulfils this\ncondition as “an accident, lucky or unlucky as the case\nmay be.” Neither the agent nor “anything else in the\nuniverse can properly be praised or blamed for it” (1934, p.\n212; Broad’s italics). \n\nThe positive condition (which must also be fulfilled) says\nthat the willing of the action is “literally determined by the\nagent or self, considered as a substance or continuant, and not by a\ntotal cause which contains as factors events in and\ndispositions of the agent” (1934, p. 214–5;\nBroad’s italics). Thus a free action is an action that is caused\nby the agent. \n\n(Note that the view that there are agent-caused effects is a form of\nindeterminism, since it says that there are certain events\nwhich, although they are indeed caused, are not fixed as a matter of\nnatural law.) \n\nBroad rejects the idea of agent-causation as unintelligible. \n\nIf an agent wills to perform an action at a certain time there must\nbe a process or event that occurs at that time (or the moment before).\nThus there must be something about the agent that explains why the\nwilling of the action started precisely at that time rather than at a\nslightly earlier or later time. The agent per se will not\ndo. \n\nThe position Broad reaches is a version of what is sometimes called\nfree will pessimism: free will is incompatible with\ndeterminism, but there is no viable form of indeterminism\nwhich leaves room for free will, either; therefore, free will does not\nexist—indeed could not exist. \n\nIn the last chapter of his monumental The Mind and Its Place in\nNature Broad defends an Emergentist position with respect to the\nrelation between mind and matter: mental properties are, in his\nopinion, distinct from physical properties; they are properties that\nemerge when neurophysiological processes have attained a\nsufficiently high degree of complexity. His discussion and defense of\nEmergentism features two chief elements. Firstly, there is a meticulous\nexamination of the concept of emergence as such; secondly, there is a\ndiscussion of whether there is reason to think that emergent phenomena\nactually exist. \n\nChapter Two of The Mind and its Place in Nature is devoted\nto a thorough discussion of the notion of emergence. In this\nchapter Broad is primarily interested in the notion or concept of\nemergence per se. Thus he is there not so much interested in\nthe actual existence of emergent phenomena. \n\nAn emergent property of an aggregate or a whole is, very\nroughly, a property that is something over and above the properties of\nits parts and the way they are arranged in the aggregate. Broad prefers\nto capture this in epistemic terms: an emergent property of a whole is\na property that it is impossible to logically infer from even the most\ncomplete knowledge of the properties of the parts of the whole. A\nproperty that can be so inferred is a reducible\nproperty. He captures the contrast between emergent and reducible\nproperties in the following passage. \n\n‘The mechanistic theory’ is Broad’s label for the\ntheory that today is termed ‘physicalism.’ \n\nSuppose a certain biological feature, e.g. the capacity for\nnutrition, is an emergent property. This means that the property is not\na mere result of an immensely high degree of organisational complexity\nat the chemical level. The property is, to be sure, nomically dependent\non the chemical level, but it is not a mere resultant of the\nproperties, relations, and laws operative at that level. If nutrition\nwere a mere resultant property it would be a reducible\nproperty; it would be a property that theoretically can be\ninferred from features at the chemical level (i.e. the properties,\nrelations and laws which characterise the constituents in isolation or\nin other wholes than the one in question). \n\nBroad’s concept of emergence is weakly epistemic; his\nnotion is at heart metaphysical: the epistemic predicament that we are\nin vis-à-vis an emergent property reflects an important\nmetaphysical fact about the property in question, viz. that it is\nneither identical with nor constituted by the properties and relations\nof the constituents of the whole in question. Thus Broad’s notion\nof emergence contrasts with a strongly epistemic notion which,\nvery roughly, says that a property is emergent for a finite epistemic\nsubject when provided with fairly extensive information about the\nproperties and relations of the constituents the subject is still\nunable logically to infer that property from the information in\nquestion although the property in fact is reducible to the\nfeatures of the constituents. \n\nHempel and Oppenheim (1948) raise several objections to Emergentism.\nBrief attention to two of their objections will help bring out at least\na couple of the many facets of Broad’s subtle account. Firstly,\nto assume that emergent phenomena exist is to assume that there are\ncertain phenomena that have “a mysterious quality of absolute\nunexplainability”. They confidently assert that “emergence\n[…] is not an ontological trait inherent in some phenomena;\nrather it is indicative of the scope of our knowledge at a given\ntime” (p. 119). This objection in effect implies that the\nmetaphysical notion of emergence is dismissed in favour of a strongly\nepistemic notion. \n\nBroad stresses that it is an empirical question whether a certain\nbiological or chemical phenomenon is emergent or not. It is always\npossible that what strikes us as an emergent property of a biological\nof chemical phenomenon “is due to our imperfect knowledge of\nmicroscopic structure or to our mathematical incompetence” (1925,\np. 81). He also emphasises the practical importance of seeking to\ndevise reductions for as many properties as possible: that ambition is\n“the natural and proper ambition of the scientists” (1933,\np. 268). \n\nIt should perhaps also be added that although emergent properties\nare indeed “unexplainable” in the sense that that they are\nnot susceptible to a reductive explanation, this does not mean\nthat they are “unexplainable” in every sense: the inherence\nof an emergent property in a particular whole does admit of an\nexplanation by nomic subsumption. We can explain its\ninherence in terms of the nature of the whole and an emergent law. The\nlaw of course remain a brute fact. But surely, so do some laws on\nany account of the world. \n\nHempel and Oppenheim also object that Emergentists are erroneously\ncommitted to regard the mass or weight of a whole as an emergent\nproperty. (Weight is, of course, a reducible characteristic if\nthere ever was one!) The reason they give for this is that not even the\nweight of a whole can be logically inferred from premises that solely\ncontain propositions about the weight of the parts; in addition a law\nis needed which expresses the weight of the whole as some specific\nmathematical function of the weight of the constituent (1948, p. 119).\nHowever, Broad’s account clearly anticipates the objection. He\nprovides the reason why a property such as weight (or mass) should not\nbe conceived as an emergent property. To “explain the behaviour\nof any whole in terms of its structure and components we\nalways need two independent kinds of information. (a) We need\nto know how the parts would behave separately. And (b) we need to know\nthe law or laws according to which the behaviour of the separate parts\nis compounded when they are acting together in any proportion and\narrangement” (1925, p. 61; Broad’s italics). So to know\nabout the mass of a whole X we need to know the mass of\nX’s parts and the principle according to which\nthe mass of a whole is determined by the mass of the parts. It is\nthrough experience that we have found that the mass of a whole is the\nmathematical sum of the mass of the parts; and it is through experience\nwe have found that the very same principle (or law of\ncomposition) is applicable to any type of whole. To see this,\nconsider the last clause of Broad’s characterisation of emergent\nproperties above. The clause says that an emergent property of a\ncertain whole cannot, even in theory, be logically inferred from the\nmost complete knowledge of the properties of the parts in isolation\nor in other wholes which are not of the form to be found the whole\nin question. Is this applicable to the mass of a certain whole? Is it\napplicable to the mass of X? No, certainly not: we\nare able to logically infer the mass of any whole, including\nX, from knowledge of the masses of parts in isolation or in\nwholes other than X. \n\nIt is one thing to delineate the contours of the notion of\nemergence, another to argue that emergent phenomena actually exist. A\nwide variety of phenomena have been held to be emergent. Apart from\nconsciousness, various chemical and biological phenomena have been held\nto be emergent. Broad is not willing to rule out a physicalistic\nreduction of chemistry and biology to physics: chemical and biological\nphenomena might, he believes, very well be reducible to complex\nmicrophysical processes. In his opinion, however, consciousness is a\ndifferent matter. We will turn to consciousness in a moment. When it\ncomes to biology and chemistry he declares that he does not see any\n“a priori impossibility in a mechanistic biology or\nchemistry” (1925, p. 72). He stresses that it is in practice\nenormously difficult to know whether, say, a certain biological feature\nsuch as nutrition is emergent or not. It is evident from what Broad\nsays that he recognises that the Emergentist stance has its dangers in\nthat it tends to encourage acceptance of laws and properties as\nultimate and irreducible. There is a danger in this because, as he\nnotes, reductive explanations have proved remarkably successful in the\npast, and there is the possibility that what we take to be an emergent\nphenomenon is in fact reducible. \n\nIn the last chapter of his book Broad presents a taxonomy of no less\nthan seventeen different theories which are “possible\ntheoretically on the relation between Mind and Matter” (1925, p.\n607). By a process of elimination Broad arrives at a more wieldy\nnumber of theories. Two of the remaining rivalling theories are\nPhysicalism—in Broad’s terminology,\n“Mechanism”—and Emergentism. Let us now take a\ncloser look at his case for Emergentism. \n\nBroad adduces a version of what has come to be known as The\nKnowledge Argument in favour of an Emergentist position with\nrespect to the place of consciousness in nature. He asks us to assume\nthat there is a mathematical archangel. The archangel’s\nmathematical and logical capability is unlimited; in addition he is\ngifted with the capacity to perceive “the microscopic structure\nof atoms as easily as we can perceive hay-stacks”. Now would\nthere be any limit to the archangel’s knowledge of the world?\nBroad’s answer is Yes. \n\nThe archangel knows all the physicalistic (mechanistic) truths.\nThere are, however, some truths that he does not know. But if\nPhysicalism were true the archangel should know all truths.\nPhysicalism is, therefore, false. \n\nIf sound, Broad’s argument establishes the negative conclusion\nthat mental phenomena are distinct from neurophysiological processes.\nBy itself it does not establish the Emergentist position, since the\nconclusion is consistent with the truth of, say, Substance Dualism (or\nwhat Broad calls “Dualism of incompatibles”). Broad’s\noverall argumentation for Emergentism, however, also includes a fairly\nthorough discussion that seeks to undermine various lines of argument\nto the effect that mental properties and physical properties are\nincompatible, i.e. arguments to the effect that a material\nwhole such as a nervous system could not possibly have mental\nproperties. These are arguments that, if successful, would rule out\nEmergentism (which is a form of property dualism) in favour of\nsubstance dualism. Broad’s case for Emergentism, then, includes\nmore than his knowledge argument and the simple methodological point\nthat Emergentism is a more ontologically economical position than\nsubstance dualism. \n\nBroad distinguishes two chief aspects of philosophical thinking. He\nlabels these critical philosophy and speculative philosophy.\nCritical philosophy has two chief tasks, one of which is to\nanalyse “certain very general concepts such as number, thing,\nquality, change, cause, etc.” (1924, p. 82). We make use of these\nand a whole host of other concepts in science and ordinary life.\nAlthough we are typically able to apply them fairly consistently, we\nare not able to analyse them. Nor are we able to state their precise\nrelations to each other. One task of critical philosophy is to provide\nanalyses of such concepts. It becomes evident that this is an important\ntask as soon as it is realized that when we seek to apply these\nconcepts to odd or exceptional cases we are often uncertain whether\nthey are applicable. For example, it might be unclear whether a certain\nindividual with a multiple personality disorder is a person\nor\n not.[13]\nSuch\ndifficulties arise because “we are not clear as to what we mean\nby ‘being a person’” (1924, p. 83). There is,\ntherefore, a need for an intellectual discipline that seeks to analyse\nand define this and many other concepts. \n\nIn science and in daily life we do not merely use unanalysed\nconcepts. “We also assume uncritically a number of very\nfundamental propositions. In all our arguments we assume the truth of\ncertain principles of reasoning. Again, we always assume that every\nchange has a cause. And in induction we certainly assume\nsomething—it is hard to say what—about the fundamental\n‘make-up’ of the existent world” (1924, p. 84). \n\nThe second task of critical philosophy is to examine these and other\nfundamental assumptions; it is “to take these propositions which\nwe uncritically assume in science and daily life and to subject them to\n criticism” (ibid.).[14] \n\nIn order to analyse a proposition we must seek to attain a clearer\ngrasp of the concepts featured in the proposition. Thus the analysis\nand criticism of a proposition depends on the analysis of concepts. And\nvice versa: by reflecting on the propositions in which a\ncertain concept occurs we clear up the meaning of it. \n\nNow, critical philosophy is one part or aspect of philosophical\nthinking. But critical philosophy “does not include all that is\nunderstood by philosophy. It is certainly held to be the function of a\nphilosopher to discuss the nature of Reality as a whole, and to\nconsider the position and prospects of men in it” (1924, p. 96).\nThis aspect of philosophical thinking is speculative\nphilosophy. \n\nSpeculative philosophy seeks to work out a view of reality as a whole\nby taking into account the whole range of human\nexperience—scientific, social, ethical, æsthetic, and\nreligious: “Its business is to take over all aspects of human\nexperience, to reflect upon them, and to try to think out a view of\nReality as a whole which shall do justice to all of them” (1924,\np. 96). \n\nBroad’s idea is that the various aspects of human experience\nand (putative) facts linked to these provide a point of departure for\nphilosophical reflection—an exceedingly important sort of\nreflection aiming at a reasoned view of Reality as a whole. \n\nAs can be gathered from the above, philosophical thinking features,\naccording to Broad, a distinctive type of birds-eye view. He calls it\nsynopsis. Let us take a somewhat closer look at this. The\nplain man as well as the professional scientist or scholar \n\nOn reflection it is clear that the synoptic stance is necessary for\nthe discovery of various inadequacies in our picture of reality,\ninadequacies resulting from a far too insular perspective on reality.\nThe synoptic stance will, in effect, lead to the discovery of latent\nphilosophical problems: “It is synopsis, revealing prima\nfacie incoherence, which is the main motive to philosophical\nactivity” (1958, p. 121; cf. 1947a, p. 16). And it is clearly\nonly after we have discovered and successfully addressed these problems\nthat we may lay claim to a satisfactory picture of reality as a\nwhole. \n\nBroad gives several examples of how synopsis is featured in\nphilosophical thinking. One of these is taken from the free will\nproblem (1947a, pp. 8–11). In a very condensed form the main facts\ngermane to the problem are these: (i) When we consider a situation in\nwhich we did a certain action, we are quite convinced that we could\nhave done otherwise: we could have performed an alternative action. On\nreflection it seems clear that ‘could’ is used in some\nsense that is not analysable in terms of ‘would have, if’.\n(ii) Our moral judgments seem to presuppose that a person who in fact\nwilled to do a certain action could have willed otherwise. (iii) Given\nthe past, the actual situation and the laws of nature it seems\nimpossible that anything other should have happened than what in fact\ndid happen. If so, how can our volitions be other than completely\ndetermined? (iv) It is difficult, then, to reconcile the notions of\nmoral responsibility with the view that our volitions are completely\ndetermined. \n\nThe problem of free will is discovered when we look at (i) and (ii)\nin the light of (iii) In other words, the very problem is discerned\nonly because we have envisaged these facts together, i.e. because we\nhave taken a synoptic view of the facts. \nProbability and Induction. Broad dealt with problems\nregarding induction—“the glory of science and the\nscandal of\n philosophy”[15]\n—in a number of papers. A sample\nof his work on the subject is the two early papers entitled “The\nRelation Induction and Probability” (1918, 1920). Broad’s\nfocus is on the nature and justification of inductive inferences. He\nargues that unless the conclusions of such inferences are cast in\nterms of probability they all involve a formal fallacy. However in\norder to arrive at justified inductive conclusions we cannot simply\nplace our confidence in any of the known principles of probability\ntheory (such as those we employ in reasoning with regard to artificial\nsituations with bags containing red and white balls, and the like): we\nneed some further premise. Unfortunately, this premise is\n“extremely difficult to state […] so that it shall be at\nonce plausible and non-tautologous” (1918, p. 389). Broad\nattempts to articulate the supreme principle needed. He argues at\nlength that the principle needed says not simply (and crudely):\n“there is uniformity in nature.” It also says that the\nparticular things or substances in the world subject to uniformity\nbelong to a variety of natural kinds. Indeed, on closer\nreflection it is clear that “[t]he notions of permanent\nsubstances, genuine natural kinds, and universal causation are parts\nof a highly complex and closely interwoven whole and any of them\nbreaks down hopelessly without the rest” (1920, p. 44).\nNotable also is the logic of conditions that Broad’s formulates\nin “The Principles of Demonstrative Induction” (1930b). He\nmay quite well be the first who gave systematic attention to this\ntopic.[16] \nCausation. Causation is dealt with in several of Broad’s\nworks (beginning as early as his first book, Perception, Physics\nand Reality, 1914). The logic of conditions formulated in (1930b)\nwould square well with some version of the regularity theory of\ncausation. However, in several works rather penetrating criticism of\nthat theory is offered (e.g., in Ch. 3, 1925). In (1933) he tries to\nformulate an alternative. Causality involves something between\nregularity and logical entailment; there is some form of necessity,\nbut not the kind involved in logical entailment. The latter is an\nabsolute necessity. Consider the proposition ’Anything that has shape\nwould have extension’. This is not only true in the actual world: it\nis true in all logically possible worlds; there could not have been a\nworld in which there were things that had shape but lacked\nextension. Now compare the proposition ’Anything that had inertial\nmass would have gravitational mass’. There could not be things in\nthe actual world which had inertial mass but lacked\ngravitational mass. But there could have been a world in which there\nwere things that had inertial mass but lacked gravitational mass. The\nkind of necessity involved here is a contingent necessity. (Cf. 1933,\npp. 242–3.) Broad is, however, rather skeptical of the\nalternative he has sought to formulate. He says with characteristic\ncandor that the notion of a necessity which is contingent might very\nwell be “sheer nonsense”.\n\n \nThe Unconscious. Broad examines issues\nsurrounding “the unconscious” at some length in The\nMind and Its Place in Nature. His objective is to capture a\n(literal) sense in which an experiential mental state may be said to be\nunconscious. Although he rejects the view that the notion of\nunconscious experience is incoherent he argues that there is no\ncompelling reason to assume that such actually exist. The assumption\nthat there is a pure neural state with causal properties that are\nsimilar to those of a certain mental state is sufficient to explain the\nfacts. Time Consciousness. Broad\ngave two different accounts of temporal\n experience.[17]\nConsider an experience of a\nsuccession of notes: Do–Re–Mi.\nThe earlier account claims that what one is aware of is temporally\nextended; it includes the present note as well as the immediate\npast ones: “what is sensed at any moment stretches a little way\nback behind that moment” (1923, p. 348). What you are aware of\nwhen Mi is present extends to, and so includes the past notes\nRe and Do. On the later account we are strictly\nspeaking aware only of the present note, Mi. But this\nawareness is coupled with a representation of the past notes under a\ndistinctive mode of temporal presentation. Broad introduces the notion\nof presentedness. When you are aware of the present note\nMi it is apprehended as possessing the maximum degree of\npresentedness, while the note Re is represented as possessing\na less degree of presentedness, and Do a still lesser\ndegree. The Philosophy of Parapsychology.\nParapsychology is the study of apparently paranormal events. Broad\nseeks to capture the nature and importance of the subject. A paranormal\nevent is an event that seems prima facie to conflict with what\nhe terms a basic limiting principle, i.e. a principle that\n“we unhesitatingly take for granted as the framework within which\nall our practical activities and our scientific theories are\nconfined” (1953, p. 7). There are a number of such principles.\nOne says that an event cannot begin to have any effect before it has\noccurred; another that knowledge of the future is impossible except in\ncertain familiar manners, such as by inference from present facts. The\nbasic limiting principles seem to “cover very satisfactorily an\nenormous range of well-established facts of the most varied\nkinds”. We are therefore “naturally inclined to think that\nthey must be all-embracing” (p. 8). And for that reason these\nprinciples are of immense importance to our overall view of the\nuniverse and our place in it. But just in proportion to this importance\nis “the philosophic importance of any well-established exception\nto them” (p. 9). \nThe Philosophy of Religion. Broad’s writings on this subject\nhave the virtues characteristic of everything he\nwrote—thoroughness, lucidity and fairness. Broad rejects the\ntraditional arguments for the existence of God. His essay\n“Arguments for The Existence of God” (1939) features a\nsearching critique of the cosmological argument and the ontological\nargument (regarding the argument from design, Broad states that he has\nnothing to add to the critique of Hume and Kant). He argues inter\nalia that the conclusion of the cosmological argument has a\nconsequence that few would stomach, viz. that there are no really\ncontingent facts, although many facts “seem contingent relative\nto our ignorance”. As to the ontological argument Broad claims\nthat the notion of the greatest possible being is “meaningless\nverbiage” unless the properties that are essential to the notion\nof God admit of an\nintrinsic maximum. He argues that that condition is not\nsatisfied. Therefore, the argument is “wrecked before ever it\nleaves port.” In the latter part of his essay Broad turns to the\nargument from religious experience (in what might quite well be the\nfirst systematic treatment of the argument). The position he takes is,\nin a nutshell, this. If a person has an experience that she takes to be\nan experience of an X, it is reasonable to conclude that she\ndid experience an X unless there is some positive reason to\nthink otherwise. To refuse to apply this principle to religious\nexperiences is not reasonable. The question then is whether there is\nsome positive reason to think that religious experiences are delusive.\nBut on reflection it turns out there is no such reason. We may\ntherefore conclude that religious experiences are probably\nveridical. \nEthics. In writings up to, and\nincluding Five Types of Ethical Theory Broad assumes that\nethical sentences express judgements. He favours an intuitionist or\nnon-naturalist analysis. In later works, however, he is undecided: it\ncould be that ethical sentences express judgements; but, alternatively,\nthey may express emotions or commands. Notwithstanding this, Broad\nfruitfully (and indefatigably!) classifies alternative types of ethical\ntheories, uncovers their underlying assumptions, and draws out their\nlogical consequences. As to normative ethics, Broad does not think the\nutilitarian view that there is one and only one criterion of right\naction can be sustained. Neither did he accept hedonism. There are, he\nargues, other bearers of intrinsic value and disvalue than pleasure and\npain. \n\nBroad made many specific contributions to the subject of moral\nphilosophy that could be mentioned. Here are three of these. (i) There\nis a fine discussion of psychological egoism (a discussion where he, as\nhe quite correctly says, gives the psychological egoist “the\nlongest possible run for his\n money”).[18]\nAfter Butler there is hardly\nneed of further nails in the coffin of that theory. But because of its\nshrewd and perceptive treatment of human motivation Broad’s essay\nis nonetheless of remaining interest. (ii) In Five Types Broad\ntentatively suggests a version of what is currently known as the\nThe Fitting Attitude Analysis of value. He writes with\ncharacteristic cautiousness: “I am not sure that\n‘X is good’ could not be defined as meaning that\nX is such that it would be a fitting object of desire to any\nmind which had an adequate idea of its non-ethical\ncharacteristics” (p.\n 283).[19]\n(iii) In an early paper (1916), Broad seems to anticipate ideas\ngaining currency much later among moral and political philosophers. He\nsuggests that the goodness of a complex state of affairs is not merely\na function of the value of its parts. Its goodness is restrained by a\ncondition which says, roughly, that the best possible state of affairs\nis one where the producers of some good are as nearly as possible\nidentical with the enjoyers of that good. The principle says that the\ncontributors to a cooperative scheme is bound by a duty\nof fairness. The principle Broad alludes to could be seen as\nan early version of the Principle of Fairness (later to be found in\nthe work of H. L. A. Hart and John\nRawls).[20] \nThe History of Philosophy. Broad wrote on a\nvariety of scattered figures in the history of philosophy, e.g. Bacon,\nButler, Berkeley, Newton, Leibniz and Kant. A notable work is Five\nTypes of Ethical Theory that (alongside careful discussions of\nsuch philosophers as Spinoza and Hume) includes a pioneering study of\nHenry Sidgwick’s The Methods of Ethics (1874), written\nat a time when Sidgwick’s work had passed into nearly\ncomplete oblivion. Noteworthy here also are \nthe two posthumously published book length\nstudies on Leibniz and Kant, respectively. Both of these contain shrewd\nphilosophical comment that are of general philosophical interest."}]
