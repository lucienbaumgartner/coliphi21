He synthesized early modern rationalism and empiricism,\nset the terms for much of nineteenth and twentieth century philosophy,\nand continues to exercise a significant influence today in\nmetaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, aesthetics,\nand other fields. The fundamental idea of Kant’s “critical\nphilosophy” – especially in his three Critiques: the\nCritique of Pure Reason (1781, 1787), the Critique of Practical Reason\n(1788), and the Critique of the Power of Judgment (1790) – is\nhuman autonomy. He argues that the human understanding is the source\nof the general laws of nature that structure all our experience; and\nthat human reason gives itself the moral law, which is our basis for\nbelief in God, freedom, and immortality. Therefore, scientific\nknowledge, morality, and religious belief are mutually consistent and\nsecure because they all rest on the same foundation of human autonomy,\nwhich is also the final end of nature according to the teleological\nworldview of reflecting judgment that Kant introduces to unify the\ntheoretical and practical parts of his philosophical system. \n\n\n\nImmanuel Kant was born April 22, 1724 in Königsberg, near the\nsoutheastern shore of the Baltic Sea. Today Königsberg has been\nrenamed Kaliningrad and is part of Russia. But during Kant’s lifetime\nKönigsberg was the capital of East Prussia, and its dominant\nlanguage was German. Though geographically remote from the rest of\nPrussia and other German cities, Königsberg was then a major\ncommercial center, an important military port, and a relatively\ncosmopolitan university\n town.[1] \n\nKant was born into an artisan family of modest means. His father was\na master harness maker, and his mother was the daughter of a harness\nmaker, though she was better educated than most women of her social\nclass. Kant’s family was never destitute, but his father’s trade was in\ndecline during Kant’s youth and his parents at times had to rely on\nextended family for financial support.  \n\nKant’s parents were Pietist and he attended a Pietist school, the\nCollegium Fridericianum, from ages eight through fifteen. Pietism was\nan evangelical Lutheran movement that emphasized conversion, reliance\non divine grace, the experience of religious emotions, and personal\ndevotion involving regular Bible study, prayer, and\nintrospection. Kant reacted strongly against the forced soul-searching\nto which he was subjected at the Collegium Fridericianum, in response\nto which he sought refuge in the Latin classics, which were central to\nthe school’s curriculum. Later the mature Kant’s emphasis on reason\nand autonomy, rather than emotion and dependence on either authority\nor grace, may in part reflect his youthful reaction against\nPietism. But although the young Kant loathed his Pietist schooling, he\nhad deep respect and admiration for his parents, especially his\nmother, whose “genuine religiosity” he described as\n“not at all enthusiastic.” According to his biographer,\nManfred Kuehn, Kant’s parents probably influenced him much less\nthrough their Pietism than through their artisan values of “hard\nwork, honesty, cleanliness, and independence,” which they taught\nhim by example.[2] \n\nKant attended college at the University of Königsberg, known as\nthe Albertina, where his early interest in classics was quickly\nsuperseded by philosophy, which all first year students studied and\nwhich encompassed mathematics and physics as well as logic,\nmetaphysics, ethics, and natural law. Kant’s philosophy professors\nexposed him to the approach of Christian Wolff (1679–1750), whose\ncritical synthesis of the philosophy of G. W. Leibniz (1646–1716) was\nthen very influential in German universities. But Kant was also exposed\nto a range of German and British critics of Wolff, and there were\nstrong doses of Aristotelianism and Pietism represented in the\nphilosophy faculty as well. Kant’s favorite teacher was Martin Knutzen\n(1713–1751), a Pietist who was heavily influenced by both Wolff and the\nEnglish philosopher John Locke (1632–1704). Knutzen introduced Kant to\nthe work of Isaac Newton (1642–1727), and his influence is visible in\nKant’s first published work, Thoughts on the True Estimation of Living\nForces (1747), which was a critical attempt to mediate a dispute in\nnatural philosophy between Leibnizians and Newtonians over the proper\nmeasurement of force. \nAfter college Kant spent six years as a private tutor to young children\noutside Königsberg. By this time both of his parents had died and\nKant’s finances were not yet secure enough for him to pursue an\nacademic career. He finally returned to Königsberg in 1754 and\nbegan teaching at the Albertina the following year. For the next four\ndecades Kant taught philosophy there, until his retirement from\nteaching in 1796 at the age of seventy-two. \nKant had a burst of publishing activity in the years after he returned\nfrom working as a private tutor. In 1754 and 1755 he published three\nscientific works – one of which, Universal Natural History and Theory\nof the Heavens (1755), was a major book in which, among other things,\nhe developed what later became known as the nebular hypothesis about\nthe formation of the solar system. Unfortunately, the printer went\nbankrupt and the book had little immediate impact. To secure\nqualifications for teaching at the university, Kant also wrote two\nLatin dissertations: the first, entitled Concise Outline of Some\nReflections on Fire (1755), earned him the Magister degree; and the\nsecond, New Elucidation of the First Principles of Metaphysical\nCognition (1755), entitled him to teach as an unsalaried lecturer. The\nfollowing year he published another Latin work, The Employment in\nNatural Philosophy of Metaphysics Combined with Geometry, of Which\nSample I Contains the Physical Monadology (1756), in hopes of\nsucceeding Knutzen as associate professor of logic and metaphysics,\nthough Kant failed to secure this position. Both the New Elucidation,\nwhich was Kant’s first work concerned mainly with metaphysics, and the\nPhysical Monadology further develop the position on the interaction of\nfinite substances that he first outlined in Living Forces. Both works\ndepart from Leibniz-Wolffian views, though not radically. The New\nElucidation in particular shows the influence of Christian August\nCrusius (1715–1775), a German critic of\n Wolff.[3] \n\nAs an unsalaried lecturer at the Albertina Kant was paid directly by\nthe students who attended his lectures, so he needed to teach an\nenormous amount and to attract many students in order to earn a living.\nKant held this position from 1755 to 1770, during which period he would\nlecture an average of twenty hours per week on logic, metaphysics, and\nethics, as well as mathematics, physics, and physical geography. In his\nlectures Kant used textbooks by Wolffian authors such as Alexander\nGottlieb Baumgarten (1714–1762) and Georg Friedrich Meier (1718–1777),\nbut he followed them loosely and used them to structure his own\nreflections, which drew on a wide range of ideas of contemporary\ninterest. These ideas often stemmed from British sentimentalist\nphilosophers such as David Hume (1711–1776) and Francis Hutcheson\n(1694–1747), some of whose texts were translated into German in the\nmid-1750s; and from the Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau\n(1712–1778), who published a flurry of works in the early 1760s. From\nearly in his career Kant was a popular and successful lecturer. He also\nquickly developed a local reputation as a promising young intellectual\nand cut a dashing figure in Königsberg society. \nAfter several years of relative quiet, Kant unleashed another burst of\npublications in 1762–1764, including five philosophical works. The\nFalse Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic Figures (1762) rehearses\ncriticisms of Aristotelian logic that were developed by other German\nphilosophers. The Only Possible Argument in Support of a Demonstration\nof the Existence of God (1762–3) is a major book in which Kant drew on\nhis earlier work in Universal History and New Elucidation to develop an\noriginal argument for God’s existence as a condition of the internal\npossibility of all things, while criticizing other arguments for God’s\nexistence. The book attracted several positive and some negative\nreviews. In 1762 Kant also submitted an essay entitled Inquiry\nConcerning the Distinctness of the Principles of Natural Theology and\nMorality to a prize competition by the Prussian Royal Academy, though\nKant’s submission took second prize to Moses Mendelssohn’s winning\nessay (and was published with it in 1764). Kant’s Prize Essay, as it is\nknown, departs more significantly from Leibniz-Wolffian views than his\nearlier work and also contains his first extended discussion of moral\nphilosophy in print. The Prize Essay draws on British sources to\ncriticize German rationalism in two respects: first, drawing on Newton,\nKant distinguishes between the methods of mathematics and philosophy;\nand second, drawing on Hutcheson, he claims that “an unanalysable\nfeeling of the good” supplies the material content of our moral\nobligations, which cannot be demonstrated in a purely intellectual way\nfrom the formal principle of perfection alone\n (2:299).[4] \n These themes\nreappear in the Attempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Magnitudes\ninto Philosophy (1763), whose main thesis, however, is that the real\nopposition of conflicting forces, as in causal relations, is not\nreducible to the logical relation of contradiction, as Leibnizians\nheld. In Negative Magnitudes Kant also argues that the morality of an\naction is a function of the internal forces that motivate one to act,\nrather than of the external (physical) actions or their consequences.\nFinally, Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and the Sublime\n(1764) deals mainly with alleged differences in the tastes of men and\nwomen and of people from different cultures. After it was published,\nKant filled his own interleaved copy of this book with (often\nunrelated) handwritten remarks, many of which reflect the deep\ninfluence of Rousseau on his thinking about moral philosophy in the\nmid-1760s. \nThese works helped to secure Kant a broader reputation in Germany, but\nfor the most part they were not strikingly original. Like other German\nphilosophers at the time, Kant’s early works are generally concerned\nwith using insights from British empiricist authors to reform or\nbroaden the German rationalist tradition without radically undermining\nits foundations. While some of his early works tend to emphasize\nrationalist ideas, others have a more empiricist emphasis. During this\ntime Kant was striving to work out an independent position, but before\nthe 1770s his views remained fluid. \nIn 1766 Kant published his first work concerned with the possibility of\nmetaphysics, which later became a central topic of his mature\nphilosophy. Dreams of a Spirit-Seer Elucidated by Dreams of\nMetaphysics, which he wrote soon after publishing a short Essay on\nMaladies of the Mind (1764), was occasioned by Kant’s fascination with\nthe Swedish visionary Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), who claimed to\nhave insight into a spirit world that enabled him to make a series of\napparently miraculous predictions. In this curious work Kant\nsatirically compares Swedenborg’s spirit-visions to the belief of\nrationalist metaphysicians in an immaterial soul that survives death,\nand he concludes that philosophical knowledge of either is impossible\nbecause human reason is limited to experience. The skeptical tone of\nDreams is tempered, however, by Kant’s suggestion that “moral faith”\nnevertheless supports belief in an immaterial and immortal soul, even\nif it is not possible to attain metaphysical knowledge in this domain\n(2:373). \nIn 1770, at the age of forty-six, Kant was appointed to the chair in\nlogic and metaphysics at the Albertina, after teaching for fifteen\nyears as an unsalaried lecturer and working since 1766 as a\nsublibrarian to supplement his income. Kant was turned down for the\nsame position in 1758. But later, as his reputation grew, he declined\nchairs in philosophy at Erlangen (1769) and Jena (1770) in hopes of\nobtaining one in Königsberg. After Kant was finally promoted, he\ngradually extended his repertoire of lectures to include anthropology\n(Kant’s was the first such course in Germany and became very popular),\nrational theology, pedagogy, natural right, and even mineralogy and\nmilitary fortifications. In order to inaugurate his new position, Kant\nalso wrote one more Latin dissertation: Concerning the Form and\nPrinciples of the Sensible and Intelligible World (1770), which is\nknown as the Inaugural Dissertation. \nThe Inaugural Dissertation departs more radically from both Wolffian\nrationalism and British sentimentalism than Kant’s earlier work.\nInspired by Crusius and the Swiss natural philosopher Johann Heinrich\nLambert (1728–1777), Kant distinguishes between two fundamental\npowers of cognition, sensibility and understanding (intelligence),\nwhere the Leibniz-Wolffians regarded understanding (intellect) as the\nonly fundamental power. Kant therefore rejects the rationalist view\nthat sensibility is only a confused species of intellectual cognition,\nand he replaces this with his own view that sensibility is distinct\nfrom understanding and brings to perception its own subjective forms\nof space and time – a view that developed out of Kant’s earlier\ncriticism of Leibniz’s relational view of space in Concerning the\nUltimate Ground of the Differentiation of Directions in Space (1768).\nMoreover, as the title of the Inaugural Dissertation indicates, Kant\nargues that sensibility and understanding are directed at two\ndifferent worlds: sensibility gives us access to the sensible world,\nwhile understanding enables us to grasp a distinct intelligible\nworld. These two worlds are related in that what the understanding\ngrasps in the intelligible world is the “paradigm” of\n“NOUMENAL PERFECTION,” which is “a common measure\nfor all other things in so far as they are realities.”\nConsidered theoretically, this intelligible paradigm of perfection is\nGod; considered practically, it is “MORAL PERFECTION”\n(2:396). The Inaugural Dissertation thus develops a form of Platonism;\nand it rejects the view of British sentimentalists that moral\njudgments are based on feelings of pleasure or pain, since Kant now\nholds that moral judgments are based on pure understanding alone. \nAfter 1770 Kant never surrendered the views that sensibility and\nunderstanding are distinct powers of cognition, that space and time are\nsubjective forms of human sensibility, and that moral judgments are\nbased on pure understanding (or reason) alone. But his embrace of\nPlatonism in the Inaugural Dissertation was short-lived. He soon denied\nthat our understanding is capable of insight into an intelligible\nworld, which cleared the path toward his mature position in the\nCritique of Pure Reason (1781), according to which the understanding\n(like sensibility) supplies forms that structure our experience of the\nsensible world, to which human knowledge is limited, while the\nintelligible (or noumenal) world is strictly unknowable to us. Kant\nspent a decade working on the Critique of Pure Reason and published\nnothing else of significance between 1770 and 1781. But its publication\nmarked the beginning of another burst of activity that produced Kant’s\nmost important and enduring works. Because early reviews of the\nCritique of Pure Reason were few and (in Kant’s judgment)\nuncomprehending, he tried to clarify its main points in the much\nshorter Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Come\nForward as a Science (1783). Among the major books that rapidly\nfollowed are the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785), Kant’s\nmain work on the fundamental principle of morality; the Metaphysical\nFoundations of Natural Science (1786), his main work on natural\nphilosophy in what scholars call his critical period (1781–1798); the\nsecond and substantially revised edition of the Critique of Pure Reason\n(1787); the Critique of Practical Reason (1788), a fuller discussion of\ntopics in moral philosophy that builds on (and in some ways revises)\nthe Groundwork; and the Critique of the Power of Judgment (1790), which\ndeals with aesthetics and teleology. Kant also published a number of\nimportant essays in this period, including Idea for a Universal History\nWith a Cosmopolitan Aim (1784) and Conjectural Beginning of Human\nHistory (1786), his main contributions to the philosophy of history; An\nAnswer to the Question: What is Enlightenment? (1784), which broaches\nsome of the key ideas of his later political essays; and What Does it\nMean to Orient Oneself in Thinking? (1786), Kant’s intervention in the\npantheism controversy that raged in German intellectual circles after\nF. H. Jacobi (1743–1819) accused the recently deceased G. E. Lessing\n(1729–1781) of Spinozism. \nWith these works Kant secured international fame and came to dominate\nGerman philosophy in the late 1780s. But in 1790 he announced that the\nCritique of the Power of Judgment brought his critical enterprise to an\nend (5:170). By then K. L. Reinhold (1758–1823), whose Letters on the\nKantian Philosophy (1786) popularized Kant’s moral and religious ideas,\nhad been installed (in 1787) in a chair devoted to Kantian philosophy\nat Jena, which was more centrally located than Königsberg and\nrapidly developing into the focal point of the next phase in German\nintellectual history. Reinhold soon began to criticize and move away\nfrom Kant’s views. In 1794 his chair at Jena passed to J. G. Fichte,\nwho had visited the master in Königsberg and whose first book,\nAttempt at a Critique of All Revelation (1792), was published\nanonymously and initially mistaken for a work by Kant himself. This\ncatapulted Fichte to fame, but soon he too moved away from Kant and\ndeveloped an original position quite at odds with Kant’s, which Kant\nfinally repudiated publicly in 1799 (12:370–371). Yet while German\nphilosophy moved on to assess and respond to Kant’s legacy, Kant\nhimself continued publishing important works in the 1790s. Among these\nare Religion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason (1793), which drew a\ncensure from the Prussian King when Kant published the book after its\nsecond essay was rejected by the censor; The Conflict of the Faculties\n(1798), a collection of essays inspired by Kant’s troubles with the\ncensor and dealing with the relationship between the philosophical and\ntheological faculties of the university; On the Common Saying: That May\nbe Correct in Theory, But it is of No Use in Practice (1793), Toward\nPerpetual Peace (1795), and the Doctrine of Right, the first part of\nThe Metaphysics of Morals (1797), Kant’s main works in political\nphilosophy; the Doctrine of Virtue, the second part of The Metaphysics\nof Morals (1797), Kant’s most mature work in moral philosophy, which he had been planning for\nmore than thirty years; and Anthropology From a Pragmatic Point of View\n(1798), based on Kant’s anthropology lectures. Several other\ncompilations of Kant’s lecture notes from other courses were published\nlater, but these were not prepared by Kant himself. \nKant retired from teaching in 1796. For nearly two decades he had lived\na highly disciplined life focused primarily on completing his\nphilosophical system, which began to take definite shape in his mind\nonly in middle age. After retiring he came to believe that there was a\ngap in this system separating the metaphysical foundations of natural\nscience from physics itself, and he set out to close this gap in a\nseries of notes that postulate the existence of an ether or caloric\nmatter. These notes, known as the Opus Postumum, remained unfinished\nand unpublished in Kant’s lifetime, and scholars disagree on their\nsignificance and relation to his earlier work. It is clear, however,\nthat some of these late notes show unmistakable signs of Kant’s mental decline,\nwhich became tragically precipitous around 1800. Kant died February 12,\n1804, just short of his eightieth birthday. \n\nThe main topic of the Critique of Pure Reason is the possibility of\nmetaphysics, understood in a specific way. Kant defines metaphysics in\nterms of “the cognitions after which reason might strive\nindependently of all experience,” and his goal in the book is to\nreach a “decision about the possibility or impossibility of a\nmetaphysics in general, and the determination of its sources, as well\nas its extent and boundaries, all, however, from principles”\n(Axii. See also Bxiv; and 4:255–257). Thus metaphysics for Kant\nconcerns a priori knowledge, or knowledge whose justification does not\ndepend on experience; and he associates a priori knowledge with reason.\nThe project of the Critique is to examine whether, how, and to what\nextent human reason is capable of a priori knowledge. \n\nTo understand the project of the Critique better, let us consider\nthe historical and intellectual context in which it was\nwritten.[5] \n Kant wrote the\nCritique toward the end of the Enlightenment, which was then in a state\nof crisis. Hindsight enables us to see that the 1780’s was a\ntransitional decade in which the cultural balance shifted decisively\naway from the Enlightenment toward Romanticism, but Kant did\nnot have the benefit of such hindsight. \nThe Enlightenment was a reaction to the rise and successes of modern\nscience in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The spectacular\nachievements of Newton in particular engendered widespread confidence\nand optimism about the power of human reason to control nature and to\nimprove human life. One effect of this new confidence in reason was\nthat traditional authorities were increasingly questioned. Why\nshould we need political or religious authorities to tell us how to\nlive or what to believe, if each of us has the capacity to figure these\nthings out for ourselves? Kant expresses this Enlightenment commitment\nto the sovereignty of reason in the Critique: \nEnlightenment is about thinking for oneself rather than letting others\nthink for you, according to What is Enlightenment? (8:35). In this\nessay, Kant also expresses the Enlightenment faith in the inevitability\nof progress. A few independent thinkers will gradually inspire a\nbroader cultural movement, which ultimately will lead to greater\nfreedom of action and governmental reform. A culture of enlightenment\nis “almost inevitable” if only there is “freedom to make public use of\none’s reason in all matters” (8:36). \nThe problem is that to some it seemed unclear whether progress would in\nfact ensue if reason enjoyed full sovereignty over traditional\nauthorities; or whether unaided reasoning would instead lead straight\nto materialism, fatalism, atheism, skepticism (Bxxxiv), or even\nlibertinism and authoritarianism (8:146). The Enlightenment commitment\nto the sovereignty of reason was tied to the expectation that it would\nnot lead to any of these consequences but instead would support certain\nkey beliefs that tradition had always sanctioned. Crucially, these\nincluded belief in God, the soul, freedom, and the compatibility of\nscience with morality and religion. Although a few intellectuals\nrejected some or all of these beliefs, the general spirit of the\nEnlightenment was not so radical. The Enlightenment was about replacing\ntraditional authorities with the authority of individual human reason,\nbut it was not about overturning traditional moral and religious\nbeliefs. \nYet the original inspiration for the Enlightenment was the new physics,\nwhich was mechanistic. If nature is entirely governed by mechanistic,\ncausal laws, then it may seem that there is no room for freedom, a\nsoul, or anything but matter in motion. This threatened the traditional\nview that morality requires freedom. We must be free in order to choose\nwhat is right over what is wrong, because otherwise we cannot be held\nresponsible. It also threatened the traditional religious belief in a\nsoul that can survive death or be resurrected in an afterlife. So\nmodern science, the pride of the Enlightenment, the source of its\noptimism about the powers of human reason, threatened to undermine\ntraditional moral and religious beliefs that free rational thought was\nexpected to support. This was the main intellectual crisis of the\nEnlightenment.\n \nThe Critique of Pure Reason is Kant’s response to this crisis. Its main\ntopic is metaphysics because, for Kant, metaphysics is the domain of\nreason – it is “the inventory of all we possess through pure\nreason, ordered systematically” (Axx) – and the authority of\nreason was in question. Kant’s main goal is to show that a critique of\nreason by reason itself, unaided and unrestrained by traditional\nauthorities, establishes a secure and consistent basis for both\nNewtonian science and traditional morality and religion. In other\nwords, free rational inquiry adequately supports all of these essential\nhuman interests and shows them to be mutually consistent. So reason\ndeserves the sovereignty attributed to it by the Enlightenment. \n\nTo see how Kant attempts to achieve this goal in the Critique, it\nhelps to reflect on his grounds for rejecting the Platonism of the\nInaugural Dissertation. The Inaugural Dissertation also tries\nto reconcile Newtonian science with traditional morality and religion in a way,\nbut its strategy is different from that of the Critique. According to\nthe Inaugural Dissertation, Newtonian science is true of the sensible\nworld, to which sensibility gives us access; and the understanding\ngrasps principles of divine and moral perfection in a distinct\nintelligible world, which are paradigms for measuring everything in the\nsensible world. So on this view our knowledge of the intelligible world\nis a priori because it does not depend on sensibility, and this a\npriori knowledge furnishes principles for judging the sensible world\nbecause in some way the sensible world itself conforms to or imitates\nthe intelligible world. \nSoon after writing the Inaugural Dissertation, however, Kant expressed\ndoubts about this view. As he explained in a February 21, 1772 letter\nto his friend and former student, Marcus Herz: \nHere Kant entertains doubts about how a priori knowledge of an\nintelligible world would be possible. The position of the Inaugural\nDissertation is that the intelligible world is independent of the human\nunderstanding and of the sensible world, both of which (in different\nways) conform to the intelligible world. But, leaving aside questions\nabout what it means for the sensible world to conform to an\nintelligible world, how is it possible for the human understanding to\nconform to or grasp an intelligible world? If the intelligible world is\nindependent of our understanding, then it seems that we could grasp it\nonly if we are passively affected by it in some way. But for Kant\nsensibility is our passive or receptive capacity to be affected by\nobjects that are independent of us (2:392, A51/B75). So the only way we\ncould grasp an intelligible world that is independent of us is through\nsensibility, which means that our knowledge of it could not be a\npriori. The pure understanding alone could at best enable us to form\nrepresentations of an intelligible world. But since these intellectual\nrepresentations would entirely “depend on our inner activity,” as Kant\nsays to Herz, we have no good reason to believe that they would conform to an\nindependent intelligible world. Such a priori intellectual\nrepresentations could well be figments of the brain that do not\ncorrespond to anything independent of the human mind. In any case, it\nis completely mysterious how there might come to be a correspondence\nbetween purely intellectual representations and an independent\nintelligible world. \nKant’s strategy in the Critique is similar to that of the Inaugural\nDissertation in that both works attempt to reconcile modern science\nwith traditional morality and religion by relegating them to distinct\nsensible and intelligible worlds, respectively. But the Critique gives\na far more modest and yet revolutionary account of a priori knowledge.\nAs Kant’s letter to Herz suggests, the main problem with his view in\nthe Inaugural Dissertation is that it tries to explain the possibility\nof a priori knowledge about a world that is entirely independent of the\nhuman mind. This turned out to be a dead end, and Kant never again\nmaintained that we can have a priori knowledge about an intelligible\nworld precisely because such a world would be entirely independent of\nus. However, Kant’s revolutionary position in the Critique is that we\ncan have a priori knowledge about the general structure of the sensible\nworld because it is not entirely independent of the human mind. The\nsensible world, or the world of appearances, is constructed by the\nhuman mind from a combination of sensory matter that we receive\npassively and a priori forms that are supplied by our cognitive\nfaculties. We can have a priori knowledge only about aspects of the\nsensible world that reflect the a priori forms supplied by our\ncognitive faculties. In Kant’s words, “we can cognize of things a\npriori only what we ourselves have put into them” (Bxviii). So\naccording to the Critique, a priori knowledge is possible only if and\nto the extent that the sensible world itself depends on the way the\nhuman mind structures its experience. \nKant characterizes this new constructivist view of experience in the\nCritique through an analogy with the revolution wrought by Copernicus\nin astronomy: \nAs this passage suggests, what Kant has changed in the Critique is\nprimarily his view about the role and powers of the understanding,\nsince he already held in the Inaugural Dissertation that sensibility\ncontributes the forms of space and time – which he calls pure (or a\npriori) intuitions (2:397) – to our cognition of the sensible world.\nBut the Critique claims that pure understanding too, rather than giving\nus insight into an intelligible world, is limited to providing forms –\nwhich he calls pure or a priori concepts – that structure our cognition\nof the sensible world. So now both sensibility and understanding work\ntogether to construct cognition of the sensible world, which therefore\nconforms to the a priori forms that are supplied by our cognitive\nfaculties: the a priori intuitions of sensibility and the a priori\nconcepts of the understanding. This account is analogous to the\nheliocentric revolution of Copernicus in astronomy because both require\ncontributions from the observer to be factored into explanations of\nphenomena, although neither reduces phenomena to the contributions of\nobservers\n alone.[6]\n The way celestial\nphenomena appear to us on earth, according to Copernicus, is affected\nby both the motions of celestial bodies and the motion of the earth,\nwhich is not a stationary body around which everything else revolves.\nFor Kant, analogously, the phenomena of human experience depend on both\nthe sensory data that we receive passively through sensibility and the\nway our mind actively processes this data according to its own a priori\nrules. These rules supply the general framework in which the sensible\nworld and all the objects (or phenomena) in it appear to us. So the\nsensible world and its phenomena are not entirely independent of the\nhuman mind, which contributes its basic structure. \nHow does Kant’s Copernican revolution in philosophy improve on the\nstrategy of the Inaugural Dissertation for reconciling modern science\nwith traditional morality and religion? First, it gives Kant a new and\ningenious way of placing modern science on an a priori foundation. He\nis now in a position to argue that we can have a priori knowledge about\nthe basic laws of modern science because those laws reflect the human\nmind’s contribution to structuring our experience. In other words, the\nsensible world necessarily conforms to certain fundamental laws – such\nas that every event has a cause – because the human mind constructs it\naccording to those laws. Moreover, we can identify those laws by\nreflecting on the conditions of possible experience, which reveals that\nit would be impossible for us to experience a world in which, for\nexample, any given event fails to have a cause. From this Kant\nconcludes that metaphysics is indeed possible in the sense that we can\nhave a priori knowledge that the entire sensible world – not just our\nactual experience, but any possible human experience – necessarily\nconforms to certain laws. Kant calls this immanent metaphysics or the\nmetaphysics of experience, because it deals with the essential\nprinciples that are immanent to human experience. \nBut, second, if “we can cognize of things a priori only what we\nourselves have put into them,” then we cannot have a priori\nknowledge about things whose existence and nature are entirely\nindependent of the human mind, which Kant calls things in themselves\n(Bxviii). In his words: “[F]rom this deduction of our faculty of\ncognizing a priori […] there emerges a very strange result […],\nnamely that with this faculty we can never get beyond the boundaries\nof possible experience, […and] that such cognition reaches\nappearances only, leaving the thing in itself as something actual for\nitself but uncognized by us” (Bxix–xx). That is, Kant’s\nconstructivist foundation for scientific knowledge restricts science\nto the realm of appearances and implies that transcendent metaphysics\n– i.e., a priori knowledge of things in themselves that transcend\npossible human experience – is impossible. In the Critique\nKant thus rejects the insight into an intelligible world that he\ndefended in the Inaugural Dissertation, and he now claims that\nrejecting knowledge about things in themselves is necessary for\nreconciling science with traditional morality and religion. This is\nbecause he claims that belief in God, freedom, and immortality have a\nstrictly moral basis, and yet adopting these beliefs on moral grounds\nwould be unjustified if we could know that they were\nfalse. “Thus,” Kant says, “I had to deny knowledge\nin order to make room for faith” (Bxxx). Restricting knowledge\nto appearances and relegating God and the soul to an unknowable realm\nof things in themselves guarantees that it is impossible to disprove\nclaims about God and the freedom or immortality of the soul, which\nmoral arguments may therefore justify us in believing. Moreover, the\ndeterminism of modern science no longer threatens the freedom required\nby traditional morality, because science and therefore determinism\napply only to appearances, and there is room for freedom in the realm\nof things in themselves, where the self or soul is located. We cannot\nknow (theoretically) that we are free, because we cannot know anything\nabout things in themselves. But there are especially strong moral\ngrounds for the belief in human freedom, which acts as “the\nkeystone” supporting other morally grounded beliefs\n(5:3–4). In this way, Kant replaces transcendent metaphysics\nwith a new practical science that he calls the metaphysics of\nmorals. It thus turns out that two kinds of metaphysics are possible:\nthe metaphysics of experience (or nature) and the metaphysics of\nmorals, both of which depend on Kant’s Copernican revolution in\nphilosophy. \n\nPerhaps the central and most controversial thesis of the Critique of\nPure Reason is that human beings experience only appearances, not\nthings in themselves; and that space and time are only subjective forms\nof human intuition that would not subsist in themselves if one were to\nabstract from all subjective conditions of human intuition. Kant calls\nthis thesis transcendental\n idealism.[7]\nOne of his best summaries of it is arguably the following: \nKant introduces transcendental idealism in the part of the Critique\ncalled the Transcendental Aesthetic, and scholars generally agree that\nfor Kant transcendental idealism encompasses at least the following\nclaims: \n\nBut scholars disagree widely on how to interpret these claims, and\nthere is no such thing as the standard interpretation of Kant’s\ntranscendental idealism. Two general types of interpretation have been\nespecially influential, however. This section provides an overview of\nthese two interpretations, although it should be emphasized that much\nimportant scholarship on transcendental idealism does not fall neatly\ninto either of these two camps. \n\nThe two-objects reading is the traditional interpretation of Kant’s\ntranscendental idealism. It goes back to the earliest review of the\nCritique – the so-called Göttingen review by Christian Garve\n(1742–1798) and J. G. Feder\n (1740–1821)[9] –\n and it was the\ndominant way of interpreting Kant’s transcendental idealism during his\nown lifetime. It has been a live interpretive option since then and\nremains so today, although it no longer enjoys the dominance that it\nonce\n did.[10] \nAccording to the two-objects interpretation, transcendental idealism is\nessentially a metaphysical thesis that distinguishes between two\nclasses of objects: appearances and things in themselves. Another name\nfor this view is the two-worlds interpretation, since it can also be\nexpressed by saying that transcendental idealism essentially\ndistinguishes between a world of appearances and another world of\nthings in themselves. \nThings in themselves, on this interpretation, are absolutely real in\nthe sense that they would exist and have whatever properties they have\neven if no human beings were around to perceive them. Appearances, on\nthe other hand, are not absolutely real in that sense, because their\nexistence and properties depend on human perceivers. Moreover, whenever\nappearances do exist, in some sense they exist in the mind of human\nperceivers. So appearances are mental entities or mental\nrepresentations. This, coupled with the claim that we experience only\nappearances, makes transcendental idealism a form of phenomenalism on\nthis interpretation, because it reduces the objects of experience to\nmental representations. All of our experiences – all of our\nperceptions of objects and events in space, even those objects and\nevents themselves, and all non-spatial but still temporal thoughts and\nfeelings – fall into the class of appearances that exist in the\nmind of human perceivers. These appearances cut us off entirely from\nthe reality of things in themselves, which are non-spatial and\nnon-temporal. Yet Kant’s theory, on this interpretation, nevertheless\nrequires that things in themselves exist, because they must transmit to\nus the sensory data from which we construct appearances. In principle\nwe cannot know how things in themselves affect our senses, because our\nexperience and knowledge is limited to the world of appearances\nconstructed by and in the mind. Things in themselves are therefore a\nsort of theoretical posit, whose existence and role are required by the\ntheory but are not directly verifiable. \nThe main problems with the two-objects interpretation are\nphilosophical. Most readers of Kant who have interpreted his\ntranscendental idealism in this way have been – often very\n– critical of it, for reasons such as the following: \nFirst, at best Kant is walking a fine line in claiming on the one hand\nthat we can have no knowledge about things in themselves, but on the\nother hand that we know that things in themselves exist, that they\naffect our senses, and that they are non-spatial and non-temporal. At\nworst his theory depends on contradictory claims about what we can and\ncannot know about things in themselves. This objection was\ninfluentially articulated by Jacobi, when he complained that\n“without that presupposition [of things in themselves] I could\nnot enter into the system, but with it I could not stay within\nit” (Jacobi 1787, 336). \nSecond, even if that problem is surmounted, it has seemed to many that\nKant’s theory, interpreted in this way, implies a radical form of\nskepticism that traps each of us within the contents of our own mind\nand cuts us off from reality. Some versions of this objection proceed\nfrom premises that Kant rejects. One version maintains that things in\nthemselves are real while appearances are not, and hence that on Kant’s\nview we cannot have experience or knowledge of reality. But Kant denies\nthat appearances are unreal: they are just as real as things in\nthemselves but are in a different metaphysical class. Another version\nclaims that truth always involves a correspondence between mental\nrepresentations and things in themselves, from which it would follow\nthat on Kant’s view it is impossible for us to have true beliefs about\nthe world. But just as Kant denies that things in themselves are the\nonly (or privileged) reality, he also denies that correspondence with\nthings in themselves is the only kind of truth. Empirical judgments are\ntrue just in case they correspond with their empirical objects in\naccordance with the a priori principles that structure all possible\nhuman experience. But the fact that Kant can appeal in this way to an\nobjective criterion of empirical truth that is internal to our\nexperience has not been enough to convince some critics that Kant is\ninnocent of an unacceptable form of skepticism, mainly because of his\ninsistence on our irreparable ignorance about things in themselves. \nThird and finally, Kant’s denial that things in themselves are spatial\nor temporal has struck many of his readers as incoherent. The role of\nthings in themselves, on the two-object interpretation, is to affect\nour senses and thereby to provide the sensory data from which our\ncognitive faculties construct appearances within the framework of our a\npriori intuitions of space and time and a priori concepts such as\ncausality. But if there is no space, time, change, or causation in the\nrealm of things in themselves, then how can things in themselves affect\nus? Transcendental affection seems to involve a causal relation between\nthings in themselves and our sensibility. If this is simply the way we\nunavoidably think about transcendental affection, because we can give\npositive content to this thought only by employing the concept of a\ncause, while it is nevertheless strictly false that things in\nthemselves affect us causally, then it seems not only that we are\nignorant of how things in themselves really affect us. It seems,\nrather, to be incoherent that things in themselves could affect us at\nall if they are not in space or time. \n\nThe two-aspects reading attempts to interpret Kant’s transcendental\nidealism in a way that enables it to be defended against at least some\nof these objections. On this view, transcendental idealism does not\ndistinguish between two classes of objects but rather between two\ndifferent aspects of one and the same class of objects. For this reason\nit is also called the one-world interpretation, since it holds that\nthere is only one world in Kant’s ontology, and that at least some\nobjects in that world have two different aspects: one aspect that\nappears to us, and another aspect that does not appear to us. That is,\nappearances are aspects of the same objects that also exist in\nthemselves. So, on this reading, appearances are not mental\nrepresentations, and transcendental idealism is not a form of\n phenomenalism.[11] \nThere are at least two main versions of the two-aspects theory. One\nversion treats transcendental idealism as a metaphysical theory\naccording to which objects have two aspects in the sense that they have\ntwo sets of properties: one set of relational properties that appear to\nus and are spatial and temporal, and another set of intrinsic\nproperties that do not appear to us and are not spatial or temporal\n(Langton 1998). This property-dualist interpretation faces\nepistemological objections similar to those faced by the two-objects\ninterpretation, because we are in no better position to acquire\nknowledge about properties that do not appear to us than we are to\nacquire knowledge about objects that do not appear to us. Moreover,\nthis interpretation also seems to imply that things in themselves are\nspatial and temporal, since appearances have spatial and temporal\nproperties, and on this view appearances are the same objects as things\nin themselves. But Kant explicitly denies that space and time are\nproperties of things in themselves. \nA second version of the two-aspects theory departs more radically from\nthe traditional two-objects interpretation by denying that\ntranscendental idealism is at bottom a metaphysical theory. Instead, it\ninterprets transcendental idealism as a fundamentally epistemological\ntheory that distinguishes between two standpoints on the objects of\nexperience: the human standpoint, from which objects are viewed\nrelative to epistemic conditions that are peculiar to human cognitive\nfaculties (namely, the a priori forms of our sensible intuition); and\nthe standpoint of an intuitive intellect, from which the same objects\ncould be known in themselves and independently of any epistemic\nconditions (Allison 2004). Human beings cannot really take up the\nlatter standpoint but can form only an empty concept of things as they\nexist in themselves by abstracting from all the content of our\nexperience and leaving only the purely formal thought of an object in\ngeneral. So transcendental idealism, on this interpretation, is\nessentially the thesis that we are limited to the human standpoint, and\nthe concept of a thing in itself plays the role of enabling us to chart\nthe boundaries of the human standpoint by stepping beyond them in\nabstract (but empty) thought. \nOne criticism of this epistemological version of the two-aspects theory\nis that it avoids the objections to other interpretations by\nattributing to Kant a more limited project than the text of the\nCritique warrants. There are passages that support this\n reading.[12] \n But there are\nalso many passages in both editions of the Critique in which Kant\ndescribes appearances as representations in the mind and in which his\ndistinction between appearances and things in themselves is given not\nonly epistemological but metaphysical\n significance.[13]\n It is unclear\nwhether all of these texts admit of a single, consistent\ninterpretation.  \n\nThe transcendental deduction is the central argument of the Critique\nof Pure Reason and one of the most complex and difficult texts in the\nhistory of philosophy. Given its complexity, there are naturally many\ndifferent ways of interpreting the\n deduction.[14] This\n brief\noverview provides one perspective on some of its main ideas. \nThe transcendental deduction occurs in the part of the Critique called\nthe Analytic of Concepts, which deals with the a priori concepts that,\non Kant’s view, our understanding uses to construct experience together\nwith the a priori forms of our sensible intuition (space and time),\nwhich he discussed in the Transcendental Aesthetic. Kant calls these a\npriori concepts “categories,” and he argues elsewhere (in the so-called\nmetaphysical deduction) that they include such concepts as substance\nand cause. The goal of the transcendental deduction is to show that we\nhave a priori concepts or categories that are objectively valid, or\nthat apply necessarily to all objects in the world that we experience.\nTo show this, Kant argues that the categories are necessary conditions\nof experience, or that we could not have experience without the\ncategories. In Kant’s words: \n The transcendental deduction of all a priori concepts therefore has a\nprinciple toward which the entire investigation must be directed,\nnamely this: that they must be recognized as a priori conditions of\nthe possibility of experiences (whether of the intuition that is\nencountered in them, or of the thinking). Concepts that supply the\nobjective ground of the possibility of experience are necessary just\nfor that reason. (A93–94/B126) \nThe strategy Kant employs to argue that the categories are conditions\nof experience is the main source of both the obscurity and the\ningenuity of the transcendental deduction. His strategy is to argue\nthat the categories are necessary specifically for self-consciousness,\nfor which Kant often uses the Leibnizian term “apperception.” \n\nOne way to approach Kant’s argument is to contrast his view of\nself-consciousness with two alternative views that he rejects. Each of\nthese views, both Kant’s and those he rejects, can be seen as offering\ncompeting answers the question: what is the source of our sense of an\nongoing and invariable self that persists throughout all the changes in\nour experience? \nThe first answer to this question that Kant rejects is that\nself-consciousness arises from some particular content being present in\neach of one’s representations. This material conception of\nself-consciousness, as we may call it, is suggested by\nLocke’s account of personal identity. According to Locke, “it\nbeing the same consciousness that makes a Man be himself to himself,\npersonal Identity depends on that only, whether it be annexed only to\none individual Substance, or can be continued in a succession of\nseveral Substances” (Essay 2.27.10). What Locke calls “the same\nconsciousness” may be understood as some representational content that\nis always present in my experience and that both identifies any\nexperience as mine and gives me a sense of a continuous self by virtue\nof its continual presence in my experience. One problem with this view,\nKant believes, is that there is no such representational content that\nis invariably present in experience, so the sense of an ongoing self\ncannot possibly arise from that non-existent content (what Locke calls\n“consciousness”) being present in each of one’s representations. In\nKant’s words, self-consciousness “does not yet come about by my\naccompanying each representation with consciousness, but rather by my\nadding one representation to the other and being conscious of their\nsynthesis. Therefore it is only because I can combine a manifold of\ngiven representations in one consciousness that it is possible for me\nto represent the identity of the consciousness in these\nrepresentations” (B133). Here Kant claims, against the Lockean\nview, that self-consciousness arises from combining (or synthesizing)\nrepresentations with one another regardless of their content. In short,\nKant has a formal conception of self-consciousness rather than a\nmaterial one. Since no particular content of my experience is\ninvariable, self-consciousness must derive from my experience having an\ninvariable form or structure, and consciousness of the identity of\nmyself through all of my changing experiences must consist in awareness\nof the formal unity and law-governed regularity of my experience. The\ncontinuous form of my experience is the necessary correlate for my\nsense of a continuous self. \nThere are at least two possible versions of the formal conception of\nself-consciousness: a realist and an idealist version. On the realist\nversion, nature itself is law-governed and we become self-conscious by\nattending to its law-governed regularities, which also makes this an\nempiricist view of self-consciousness. The idea of an identical self\nthat persists throughout all of our experience, on this view, arises\nfrom the law-governed regularity of nature, and our representations\nexhibit order and regularity because reality itself is ordered and\nregular. Kant rejects this realist view and embraces a conception of\nself-consciousness that is both formal and idealist. According to Kant,\nthe formal structure of our experience, its unity and law-governed\nregularity, is an achievement of our cognitive faculties rather than a\nproperty of reality in itself. Our experience has a constant form\nbecause our mind constructs experience in a law-governed way. So\nself-consciousness, for Kant, consists in awareness of the mind’s\nlaw-governed activity of synthesizing or combining sensible data to\nconstruct a unified experience. As he expresses it, “this unity of\nconsciousness would be impossible if in the cognition of the manifold\nthe mind could not become conscious of the identity of the function by\nmeans of which this manifold is synthetically combined into one\ncognition” (A108). \nKant argues for this formal idealist conception of self-consciousness,\nand against the formal realist view, on the grounds that “we can\nrepresent nothing as combined in the object without having previously\ncombined it ourselves” (B130). In other words, even if reality in\nitself were law-governed, its laws could not simply migrate over to our\nmind or imprint themselves on us while our mind is entirely passive. We\nmust exercise an active capacity to represent the world as combined or\nordered in a law-governed way, because otherwise we could not represent\nthe world as law-governed even if it were law-governed in itself.\nMoreover, this capacity to represent the world as law-governed must be\na priori because it is a condition of self-consciousness, and we would\nalready have to be self-conscious in order to learn from our experience\nthat there are law-governed regularities in the world. So it is\nnecessary for self-consciousness that we exercise an a priori capacity\nto represent the world as law-governed. But this would also be\nsufficient for self-consciousness if we could exercise our a priori\ncapacity to represent the world as law-governed even if reality in\nitself were not law-governed. In that case, the realist and empiricist\nconception of self-consciousness would be false, and the formal\nidealist view would be true. \nKant’s confidence that no empiricist account could possibly explain\nself-consciousness may be based on his assumption that the sense of\nself each of us has, the thought of oneself as identical throughout all\nof one’s changing experiences, involves necessity and universality,\nwhich on his view are the hallmarks of the a priori. This assumption is\nreflected in what we may call Kant’s principle of apperception: “The I\nthink must be able to accompany all my representations; for otherwise\nsomething would be represented in me that could not be thought at all,\nwhich is as much as to say that the representation would either be\nimpossible or else at least would be nothing for me”\n (B131–132).[15] \n Notice the\nclaims about necessity and universality embodied in the words “must”\nand “all” here. Kant is saying that for a representation to count as\nmine, it must necessarily be accessible to conscious awareness in some\n(perhaps indirect) way: I must be able to accompany it with “I\nthink….” All of my representations must be accessible to\nconsciousness in this way (but they need not actually be conscious),\nbecause again that is simply what makes a representation count as mine.\nSelf-consciousness for Kant therefore involves a priori knowledge about\nthe necessary and universal truth expressed in this principle of\napperception, and a priori knowledge cannot be based on experience. \nKant may have developed this thread of his\nargument in the transcendental deduction after reading Johann Nicolaus\nTetens (1736–1807) rather than through a direct encounter with\nLocke’s texts (Tetens 1777, Kitcher 2011). On the subject of\nself-consciousness, Tetens was a follower of Locke and also engaged\nwith Hume’s arguments for rejecting a continuing self. So Kant’s\nactual opponents in the deduction may have been Lockean and Humean\npositions as represented by Tetens, as well as rationalist views that\nKant would have encountered directly in texts by Leibniz, Wolff, and\nsome of their followers. \n\nOn the basis of this formal idealist conception of\nself-consciousness, Kant’s argument (at least one central thread of it)\nmoves through two more conditions of self-consciousness in order to\nestablish the objective validity of the categories. The next condition\nis that self-consciousness requires me to represent an objective world\ndistinct from my subjective representations – that is, distinct from my\nthoughts about and sensations of that objective world. Kant uses this\nconnection between self-consciousness and objectivity to insert the\ncategories into his argument. \nIn order to be self-conscious, I cannot be wholly absorbed in the\ncontents of my perceptions but must distinguish myself from the rest of\nthe world. But if self-consciousness is an achievement of the mind,\nthen how does the mind achieve this sense that there is a distinction\nbetween the I that perceives and the contents of its perceptions?\nAccording to Kant, the mind achieves this sense by distinguishing\nrepresentations that necessarily belong together from representations\nthat are not necessarily connected but are merely associated in a\ncontingent way. Consider Kant’s example of the perception of a house\n(B162). Imagine a house that is too large to fit into your visual field\nfrom your vantage point near its front door. Now imagine that you walk\naround the house, successively perceiving each of its sides. Eventually\nyou perceive the entire house, but not all at once, and you judge that\neach of your representations of the sides of the house necessarily\nbelong together (as sides of one house) and that anyone who denied this\nwould be mistaken. But now imagine that you grew up in this house and\nassociate a feeling of nostalgia with it. You would not judge that\nrepresentations of this house are necessarily connected with feelings\nof nostalgia. That is, you would not think that other people seeing the\nhouse for the first time would be mistaken if they denied that it is\nconnected with nostalgia, because you recognize that this house is\nconnected with nostalgia for you but not necessarily for everyone. Yet\nyou distinguish this merely subjective connection from the objective\nconnection between sides of the house, which is objective because the\nsides of the house necessarily belong together “in the object,” because\nthis connection holds for everyone universally, and because it is\npossible to be mistaken about it. The point here is not that we must\nsuccessfully identify which representations necessarily belong together\nand which are merely associated contingently, but rather that to be\nself-conscious we must at least make this general distinction between\nobjective and merely subjective connections of representations. \nAt this point (at least in the second edition text) Kant introduces the\nkey claim that judgment is what enables us to distinguish objective\nconnections of representations that necessarily belong together from\nmerely subjective and contingent associations: “[A] judgment is nothing\nother than the way to bring given cognitions to the objective unity of\napperception. That is the aim of the copula is in them: to distinguish\nthe objective unity of given representations from the subjective. For\nthis word designates the relation of the representations to the\noriginal apperception and its necessary unity” (B141–142). Kant is\nspeaking here about the mental act of judging that results in the\nformation of a judgment. Judging is an act of what Kant calls\nsynthesis, which he defines as “the action of putting different\nrepresentations together with each other and comprehending their\nmanifoldness in one cognition” (A77/B103). In other words, to\nsynthesize is in general to combine several representations into a\nsingle (more) complex representation, and to judge is specifically to\ncombine concepts into a judgment – that is, to join a subject concept\nto a predicate concept by means of the copula, as in “the body is\nheavy” or “the house is four-sided.” Judgments need not be true, of\ncourse, but they always have a truth value (true or false) because they\nmake claims to objective validity. When I say, by contrast, that “If I\ncarry a body, I feel a pressure of weight,” or that “if I see this\nhouse, I feel nostalgia,” I am not making a judgment about the object\n(the body or the house) but rather I am expressing a subjective\nassociation that may apply only to me\n (B142).[16] \nKant’s reference to the necessary unity of apperception or\nself-consciousness in the quotation above means (at least) that the\naction of judging is the way our mind achieves self-consciousness. We\nmust represent an objective world in order to distinguish ourselves\nfrom it, and we represent an objective world by judging that some\nrepresentations necessarily belong together. Moreover, recall from\n 4.1\n that, for Kant, we must have an a priori capacity\nto represent the world as law-governed, because “we can represent\nnothing as combined (or connected) in the object without having\npreviously combined it ourselves” (B130). It follows that objective\nconnections in the world cannot simply imprint themselves on our mind.\nRather, experience of an objective world must be constructed by\nexercising an a priori capacity to judge, which Kant calls the faculty\nof understanding (A80–81/B106). The understanding constructs experience\nby providing the a priori rules, or the framework of necessary laws, in\naccordance with which we judge representations to be objective. These\nrules are the pure concepts of the understanding or categories, which\nare therefore conditions of self-consciousness, since they are rules\nfor judging about an objective world, and self-consciousness requires\nthat we distinguish ourselves from an objective world. \nKant identifies the categories in what he calls the metaphysical\ndeduction, which precedes the transcendental\n deduction.[17] Very\nbriefly, since the categories are a priori rules for judging, Kant\nargues that an exhaustive table of categories can be derived from a\ntable of the basic logical forms of judgments. For example, according\nto Kant the logical form of the judgment that “the body is heavy” would\nbe singular, affirmative, categorical, and assertoric. But since\ncategories are not mere logical functions but instead are rules for\nmaking judgments about objects or an objective world, Kant arrives at\nhis table of categories by considering how each logical function would\nstructure judgments about objects (within our spatio-temporal forms of\nintuition). For example, he claims that categorical judgments express a\nlogical relation between subject and predicate that corresponds to the\nontological relation between substance and accident; and the logical\nform of a hypothetical judgment expresses a relation that corresponds\nto cause and effect. Taken together with this argument, then, the\ntranscendental deduction argues that we become self-conscious by\nrepresenting an objective world of substances that interact according\nto causal laws. The final condition of self-consciousness that Kant adds to the\npreceding conditions is that our understanding must cooperate with\nsensibility to construct one, unbounded, and unified space-time to\nwhich all of our representations may be related.  \nTo see why this further condition is required, consider that so far we\nhave seen why Kant holds that we must represent an objective world in\norder to be self-conscious, but we could represent an objective world\neven if it were not possible to relate all of our representations to\nthis objective world. For all that has been said so far, we might\nstill have unruly representations that we cannot relate in any way to\nthe objective framework of our experience. On Kant’s view, this would\nbe a problem because, as we have seen, he holds that\nself-consciousness involves universality and necessity: according to\nhis principle of apperception, “the I think must be able to\naccompany all my representations” (B131). Yet if, on the one\nhand, I had representations that I could not relate in some way to an\nobjective world, then I could not accompany those representations with\n“I think” or recognize them as my representations, because\nI can say “I think…” about any given representation only\nby relating it to an objective world, according to the argument just\ndiscussed. So I must be able to relate any given representation to an\nobjective world in order for it to count as mine.  On the other hand,\nself-consciousness would also be impossible if I represented multiple\nobjective worlds, even if I could relate all of my representations to\nsome objective world or other. In that case, I could not become\nconscious of an identical self that has, say, representation 1 in\nspace-time A and representation 2 in space-time B. It may be possible\nto imagine disjointed spaces and times, but it is not possible to\nrepresent them as objectively real. So self-consciousness requires\nthat I can relate all of my representations to a single objective\nworld. \nThe reason why I must represent this one objective world by means of a\nunified and unbounded space-time is that, as Kant argued in the\nTranscendental Aesthetic, space and time are the pure forms of human\nintuition. If we had different forms of intuition, then our experience\nwould still have to constitute a unified whole in order for us to be\nself-conscious, but this would not be a spatio-temporal whole. Given\nthat space and time are our forms of intuition, however, our\nunderstanding must still cooperate with sensibility to construct a\nspatio-temporal whole of experience because, once again, “we can\nrepresent nothing as combined in the object without having previously\ncombined it ourselves,” and “all combination […] is an action of the\nunderstanding” (B130). So Kant distinguishes between space and time as\npure forms of intuition, which belong solely to sensibility; and the\nformal intuitions of space and time (or space-time), which are unified\nby the understanding (B160–161). These formal intuitions are the\nspatio-temporal whole within which our understanding constructs\nexperience in accordance with the\n categories.[18] \nThe most important implication of Kant’s claim that the understanding\nconstructs a single whole of experience to which all of our\nrepresentations can be related is that, since he defines nature\n“regarded materially” as “the sum total of all\nappearances” and he has argued that the categories are\nobjectively valid of all possible appearances, on his view it follows\nthat our categories are the source of the fundamental laws of nature\n“regarded formally” (B163, 165). So Kant concludes on this\nbasis that the understanding is the true law-giver of nature. In his\nwords: “all appearances in nature, as far as their combination\nis concerned, stand under the categories, on which nature (considered\nmerely as nature in general) depends, as the original ground of its\nnecessary lawfulness (as nature regarded formally)” (B165). Or\nmore strongly: “we ourselves bring into the appearances that\norder and regularity that we call nature, and moreover we would not be\nable to find it there if we, or the nature of our mind, had not\noriginally put it there. […] The understanding is thus not merely a\nfaculty for making rules through the comparison of the appearances: it\nis itself the legislation for nature, i.e., without understanding\nthere would not be any nature at all” (A125–126).  \n\nHaving examined two central parts of Kant’s positive project in\ntheoretical philosophy from the Critique of Pure Reason, transcendental\nidealism and the transcendental deduction, let us now turn to his\npractical philosophy in the Critique of Practical\n Reason.\n Since Kant’s\nphilosophy is deeply systematic, this section begins with a preliminary\nlook at how his theoretical and practical philosophy fit together (see\nalso section\n 7). \n\nThe fundamental idea of Kant’s philosophy is human autonomy. So far\nwe have seen this in Kant’s constructivist view of experience,\naccording to which our understanding is the source of the general laws\nof nature. “Autonomy” literally means giving the law to oneself, and on\nKant’s view our understanding provides laws that constitute the a\npriori framework of our experience. Our understanding does not provide\nthe matter or content of our experience, but it does provide the basic\nformal structure within which we experience any matter received through\nour senses. Kant’s central argument for this view is the transcendental\ndeduction, according to which it is a condition of self-consciousness\nthat our understanding constructs experience in this way. So we may\ncall self-consciousness the highest principle of Kant’s theoretical\nphilosophy, since it is (at least) the basis for all of our a priori\nknowledge about the structure of nature. \nKant’s moral philosophy is also based on the idea of autonomy. He holds\nthat there is a single fundamental principle of morality, on which all\nspecific moral duties are based. He calls this moral law (as it is\nmanifested to us) the categorical imperative (see\n 5.4).\n The moral law is a product of reason, for Kant, while\nthe basic laws of nature are products of our understanding. There are\nimportant differences between the senses in which we are autonomous in\nconstructing our experience and in morality. For example, Kant regards\nunderstanding and reason as different cognitive faculties, although he\nsometimes uses “reason” in a wide sense to cover\n both.[19] \n The categories\nand therefore the laws of nature are dependent on our specifically\nhuman forms of intuition, while reason is not. The moral law does not\ndepend on any qualities that are peculiar to human nature but only on\nthe nature of reason as such, although its manifestation to us as a\ncategorical imperative (as a law of duty) reflects the fact that the\nhuman will is not necessarily determined by pure reason but is also\ninfluenced by other incentives rooted in our needs and inclinations;\nand our specific duties deriving from the categorical imperative do\nreflect human nature and the contingencies of human life. Despite these\ndifferences, however, Kant holds that we give the moral law to\nourselves, as we also give the general laws of nature to\nourselves, though in a different sense. Moreover, we each necessarily give the same\nmoral law to ourselves, just as we each construct our experience in\naccordance with the same categories. To summarize: \n\nSo both parts of Kant’s philosophy are about autonomously\nconstructing a world, but in different senses. In theoretical\nphilosophy, we use our categories and forms of intuition to construct a\nworld of experience or nature. In practical philosophy, we use the\nmoral law to construct the idea of a moral world or a realm of ends\nthat guides our conduct (4:433), and ultimately to transform the\nnatural world into the highest good. Finally, transcendental idealism\nis the framework within which these two parts of Kant’s philosophy fit\ntogether (20:311). Theoretical philosophy deals with appearances, to\nwhich our knowledge is strictly limited; and practical philosophy deals\nwith things in themselves, although it does not give us knowledge about\nthings in themselves but only provides rational justification for\ncertain beliefs about them for practical purposes. To understand Kant’s arguments that practical philosophy justifies\ncertain beliefs about things in themselves, it is necessary to see\nthem in the context of his criticism of German rationalist\nmetaphysics. The three traditional topics of Leibniz-Wolffian special\nmetaphysics were rational psychology, rational cosmology, and rational\ntheology, which dealt, respectively, with the human soul, the\nworld-whole, and God. In the part of the Critique of Pure Reason\ncalled the Transcendental Dialectic, Kant argues against the\nLeibniz-Wolffian view that human beings are capable of a priori\nknowledge in each of these domains, and he claims that the errors of\nLeibniz-Wolffian metaphysics are due to an illusion that has its seat\nin the nature of human reason itself. According to Kant, human reason\nnecessarily produces ideas of the soul, the world-whole, and God; and\nthese ideas unavoidably produce the illusion that we have a priori\nknowledge about transcendent objects corresponding to them. This is an\nillusion, however, because in fact we are not capable of a priori\nknowledge about any such transcendent objects. Nevertheless, Kant\nattempts to show that these illusory ideas have a positive, practical\nuse. He thus reframes Leibniz-Wolffian special metaphysics as a\npractical science that he calls the metaphysics of morals. On Kant’s\nview, our ideas of the soul, the world-whole, and God provide the\ncontent of morally justified beliefs about human immortality, human\nfreedom, and the existence of God, respectively; but they are not\nproper objects of speculative\n knowledge.[20] \n\nThe most important belief about things in themselves that Kant\nthinks only practical philosophy can justify concerns human freedom.\nFreedom is important because, on Kant’s view, moral appraisal\npresupposes that we are free in the sense that we have the ability to\ndo otherwise. To see why, consider Kant’s example of a man who commits\na theft (5:95ff.). Kant holds that in order for this man’s action to be\nmorally wrong, it must have been within his control in the sense that\nit was within his power at the time not to have committed the theft. If\nthis was not within his control at the time, then, while it may be\nuseful to punish him in order to shape his behavior or to influence\nothers, it nevertheless would not be correct to say that his action was\nmorally wrong. Moral rightness and wrongness apply only to free agents\nwho control their actions and have it in their power, at the time of\ntheir actions, either to act rightly or not. According to Kant, this is\njust common sense. \nOn these grounds, Kant rejects a type of compatibilism that he calls\nthe “comparative concept of freedom” and associates with\nLeibniz (5:96–97). (Note that Kant has a specific type of\ncompatibilism in mind, which I will refer to simply as\n“compatibilism,” although there may be other types of\ncompatibilism that do not fit Kant’s characterization of that\nview). On the compatibilist view, as Kant understands it, I am free\nwhenever the cause of my action is within me. So I am unfree only when\nsomething external to me pushes or moves me, but I am free whenever\nthe proximate cause of my body’s movement is internal to me as an\n“acting being” (5:96). If we distinguish between\ninvoluntary convulsions and voluntary bodily movements, then on this\nview free actions are just voluntary bodily movements. Kant ridicules\nthis view as a “wretched subterfuge” that tries to solve\nan ancient philosophical problem “with a little quibbling about\nwords” (ibid.). This view, he says, assimilates human freedom to\n“the freedom of a turnspit,” or a projectile in flight, or\nthe motion of a clock’s hands (5:96–97). The proximate causes of\nthese movements are internal to the turnspit, the projectile, and the\nclock at the time of the movement. This cannot be sufficient for moral\nresponsibility. \nWhy not? The reason, Kant says, is ultimately that the causes of these\nmovements occur in time. Return to the theft example. A compatibilist\nwould say that the thief’s action is free because its proximate cause\nis inside him, and because the theft was not an involuntary convulsion\nbut a voluntary action. The thief decided to commit the theft, and his\naction flowed from this decision. According to Kant, however, if the\nthief’s decision is a natural phenomenon that occurs in time, then it\nmust be the effect of some cause that occurred in a previous time. This\nis an essential part of Kant’s Newtonian worldview and is grounded in\nthe a priori laws (specifically, the category of cause and effect) in\naccordance with which our understanding constructs experience: every\nevent has a cause that begins in an earlier time. If that cause too was\nan event occurring in time, then it must also have a cause beginning in\na still earlier time, etc. All natural events occur in time and are\nthoroughly determined by causal chains that stretch backwards into the\ndistant past. So there is no room for freedom in nature, which is\ndeterministic in a strong sense. \nThe root of the problem, for Kant, is time. Again, if the thief’s\nchoice to commit the theft is a natural event in time, then it is the\neffect of a causal chain extending into the distant past. But the past\nis out of his control now, in the present. Once the past is past, he\ncan’t change it. On Kant’s view, that is why his actions would not be\nin his control in the present if they are determined by events in the\npast. Even if he could control those past events in the past, he cannot\ncontrol them now. But in fact past events were not in his control in\nthe past either if they too were determined by events in the more\ndistant past, because eventually the causal antecedents of his action\nstretch back before his birth, and obviously events that occurred\nbefore his birth were never in his control. So if the thief’s choice to\ncommit the theft is a natural event in time, then it is not now and\nnever was in his control, and he could not have done otherwise than to\ncommit the theft. In that case, it would be a mistake to hold him\nmorally responsible for it. \nCompatibilism, as Kant understands it, therefore locates the issue in\nthe wrong place. Even if the cause of my action is internal to me, if\nit is in the past – for example, if my action today is\ndetermined by a decision I made yesterday, or from the character I\ndeveloped in childhood – then it is not within my control\nnow. The real issue is not whether the cause of my action is internal\nor external to me, but whether it is in my control now. For Kant,\nhowever, the cause of my action can be within my control now only if\nit is not in time. This is why Kant thinks that transcendental\nidealism is the only way to make sense of the kind of freedom that\nmorality requires. Transcendental idealism allows that the cause\nof my action may be a thing in itself outside of time: namely, my\nnoumenal self, which is free because it is not part of nature. No\nmatter what kind of character I have developed or what external\ninfluences act on me, on Kant’s view all of my intentional, voluntary\nactions are immediate effects of my noumenal self, which is causally\nundetermined (5:97–98). My noumenal self is an uncaused cause\noutside of time, which therefore is not subject to the deterministic\nlaws of nature in accordance with which our understanding constructs\nexperience. \nMany puzzles arise on this picture that Kant does not resolve. For\nexample, if my understanding constructs all appearances in my\nexperience of nature, not only appearances of my own actions, then why\nam I responsible only for my own actions but not for everything that\nhappens in the natural world? Moreover, if I am not alone in the world\nbut there are many noumenal selves acting freely and incorporating\ntheir free actions into the experience they construct, then how do\nmultiple transcendentally free agents interact? How do you integrate my\nfree actions into the experience that your understanding\n constructs?[21]\n In spite of these\nunsolved puzzles, Kant holds that we can make sense of moral appraisal\nand responsibility only by thinking about human freedom in this way,\nbecause it is the only way to prevent natural necessity from\nundermining both. Finally, since Kant invokes transcendental idealism to make sense\nof freedom, interpreting his thinking about freedom leads us back to\ndisputes between the two-objects and two-aspects interpretations of\ntranscendental idealism. On the face of it, the two-objects\ninterpretation seems to make better sense of Kant’s view of\ntranscendental freedom than the two-aspects interpretation. If\nmorality requires that I am transcendentally free, then it seems that\nmy true self, and not just an aspect of my self, must be outside of\ntime, according to Kant’s argument. But applying the two-objects\ninterpretation to freedom raises problems of its own, since it\ninvolves making a distinction between noumenal and phenomenal selves\nthat does not arise on the two-aspects view. If only my noumenal self\nis free, and freedom is required for moral responsibility, then my\nphenomenal self is not morally responsible. But how are my noumenal\nand phenomenal selves related, and why is punishment inflicted on\nphenomenal selves? It is unclear whether and to what extent appealing\nto Kant’s theory of freedom can help to settle disputes about the\nproper interpretation of transcendental idealism, since there are\nserious questions about the coherence of Kant’s theory on either\ninterpretation. Can we know that we are free in this transcendental sense? Kant’s\nresponse is tricky. On the one hand, he distinguishes between\ntheoretical knowledge and morally justified belief\n(A820–831/B848–859).  We do not have theoretical knowledge\nthat we are free or about anything beyond the limits of possible\nexperience, but we are morally justified in believing that we are free\nin this sense. On the other hand, Kant also uses stronger language\nthan this when discussing freedom. For example, he says that\n“among all the ideas of speculative reason freedom is the only\none the possibility of which we know a priori, though without having\nany insight into it, because it is the condition of the moral law,\nwhich we do know.” In a footnote to this passage, Kant explains\nthat we know freedom a priori because “were there no freedom,\nthe moral law would not be encountered at all in ourselves,” and\non Kant’s view everyone does encounter the moral law a priori\n(5:4). For this reason, Kant claims that the moral law\n“proves” the objective, “though only practical,\nundoubted reality” of freedom (5:48–49). So Kant wants to\nsay that we do have knowledge of the reality of freedom, but that this\nis practical knowledge of a practical reality, or cognition\n“only for practical purposes,” by which he means to\ndistinguish it from theoretical knowledge based on experience or\nreflection on the conditions of experience (5:133). Our practical\nknowledge of freedom is based instead on the moral law. The difference\nbetween Kant’s stronger and weaker language seems mainly to be that\nhis stronger language emphasizes that our belief or practical\nknowledge about freedom is unshakeable and that it in turn provides\nsupport for other morally grounded beliefs in God and the immortality\nof the soul.  \nKant calls our consciousness of the moral law, our awareness that the\nmoral law binds us or has authority over us, the “fact of\nreason” (5:31–32, 42–43, 47, 55). So, on his view,\nthe fact of reason is the practical basis for our belief or practical\nknowledge that we are free.  Kant insists that this moral\nconsciousness is “undeniable,” “a priori,” and\n“unavoidable” (5:32, 47, 55). Every human being has a\nconscience, a common sense grasp of morality, and a firm conviction\nthat he or she is morally accountable. We may have different beliefs\nabout the source of morality’s authority – God, social\nconvention, human reason. We may arrive at different conclusions about\nwhat morality requires in specific situations. And we may violate our\nown sense of duty. But we all have a conscience, and an unshakeable\nbelief that morality applies to us. According to Kant, this belief\ncannot and does not need to be justified or “proved by any\ndeduction” (5:47). It is just a ground-level fact about human\nbeings that we hold ourselves morally accountable. But Kant is making\na normative claim here as well: it is also a fact, which cannot and\ndoes not need to be justified, that we are morally accountable, that\nmorality does have authority over us.  Kant holds that philosophy\nshould be in the business of defending this common sense moral belief,\nand that in any case we could never prove or disprove it (4:459). \nKant may hold that the fact of reason, or our consciousness of moral\nobligation, implies that we are free on the grounds that ought implies\ncan. In other words, Kant may believe that it follows from the fact\nthat we ought (morally) to do something that we can or are able to do\nit. This is suggested, for example, by a passage in which Kant asks us\nto imagine someone threatened by his prince with immediate execution\nunless he “give[s] false testimony against an honorable man whom the\nprince would like to destroy under a plausible pretext.” Kant says that\n“[h]e would perhaps not venture to assert whether he would do it or\nnot, but he must admit without hesitation that it would be possible for\nhim. He judges, therefore, that he can do something because he is aware\nthat he ought to do it and cognizes freedom within him, which, without\nthe moral law, would have remained unknown to him” (5:30). This is a\nhypothetical example of an action not yet carried out. It seems that\npangs of guilt about the immorality of an action that you carried out\nin the past, on this reasoning, would imply more directly that you have\n(or at least had) the ability to act otherwise than you did, and\ntherefore that you are free in Kant’s sense. \n\nIn both the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals and the Critique\nof Practical Reason, Kant also gives a more detailed argument for the\nconclusion that morality and freedom reciprocally imply one another,\nwhich is sometimes called the reciprocity thesis (Allison 1990). On\nthis view, to act morally is to exercise freedom, and the only way to\nfully exercise freedom is to act morally. Kant’s arguments for this\nview differ in these texts, but the general structure of his argument\nin the Critique of Practical Reason may be summarized as follows. \nFirst, it follows from the basic idea of having a will that to act at\nall is to act on some principle, or what Kant calls a maxim. A maxim\nis a subjective rule or policy of action: it says what you are doing\nand why. Kant gives as examples the maxims “to let no\ninsult pass unavenged” and “to increase my wealth by every\nsafe means” (5:19, 27).  We may be unaware of our maxims, we may\nnot act consistently on the same maxims, and our maxims may not be\nconsistent with one another. But Kant holds that since we are rational\nbeings our actions always aim at some sort of end or goal, which our\nmaxim expresses. The goal of an action may be something as basic as\ngratifying a desire, or it may be something more complex such as\nbecoming a doctor or a lawyer. In any case, the causes of our actions\nare never our desires or impulses, on Kant’s view. If I act to gratify\nsome desire, then I choose to act on a maxim that specifies the\ngratification of that desire as the goal of my action. For example, if\nI desire some coffee, then I may act on the maxim to go to a cafe and\nbuy some coffee in order to gratify that desire. \nSecond, Kant distinguishes between two basic kinds of principles or\nrules that we can act on: what he calls material and formal principles.\nTo act in order to satisfy some desire, as when I act on the maxim to\ngo for coffee at a cafe, is to act on a material principle (5:21ff.).\nHere the desire (for coffee) fixes the goal, which Kant calls the\nobject or matter of the action, and the principle says how to achieve\nthat goal (go to a cafe). Corresponding to material principles, on\nKant’s view, are what he calls hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical\nimperative is a principle of rationality that says I should act in\na certain way if I choose to satisfy some desire. If maxims in general\nare rules that describe how one does act, then imperatives in general\nprescribe how one should act. An imperative is hypothetical if it says\nhow I should act only if I choose to pursue some goal in order to\ngratify a desire (5:20). This, for example, is a hypothetical\nimperative: if you want coffee, then go to the cafe. This hypothetical\nimperative applies to you only if you desire coffee and choose to\ngratify that desire. \nIn contrast to material principles, formal principles describe how one\nacts without making reference to any desires. This is easiest to\nunderstand through the corresponding kind of imperative, which Kant\ncalls a categorical imperative. A categorical imperative commands\nunconditionally that I should act in some way. So while hypothetical\nimperatives apply to me only on the condition that I have and set the\ngoal of satisfying the desires that they tell me how to satisfy,\ncategorical imperatives apply to me no matter what my goals and desires\nmay be. Kant regards moral laws as categorical imperatives, which apply\nto everyone unconditionally. For example, the moral requirement to help\nothers in need does not apply to me only if I desire to help others in\nneed, and the duty not to steal is not suspended if I have some desire\nthat I could satisfy by stealing. Moral laws do not have such\nconditions but rather apply unconditionally. That is why they apply to\neveryone in the same way. \nThird, insofar as I act only on material principles or hypothetical\nimperatives, I do not act freely, but rather I act only to satisfy some\ndesire(s) that I have, and what I desire is not ultimately within my\ncontrol. To some limited extent we are capable of rationally shaping\nour desires, but insofar as we choose to act in order to satisfy\ndesires we are choosing to let nature govern us rather than governing\nourselves (5:118). We are always free in the sense that we always have\nthe capacity to govern ourselves rationally instead of letting our\ndesires set our ends for us. But we may (freely) fail to exercise that\ncapacity. Moreover, since Kant holds that desires never cause us to\nact, but rather we always choose to act on a maxim even when that maxim\nspecifies the satisfaction of a desire as the goal of our action, it\nalso follows that we are always free in the sense that we freely choose\nour maxims. Nevertheless, our actions are not free in the sense of\nbeing autonomous if we choose to act only on material principles, because in\nthat case we do not give the law to ourselves, but instead we choose to\nallow nature in us (our desires) to determine the law for our\nactions.     \nFinally, the only way to act freely in the full sense of exercising\nautonomy is therefore to act on formal principles or categorical\nimperatives, which is also to act morally. Kant does not mean that\nacting autonomously requires that we take no account of our desires,\nwhich would be impossible (5:25, 61). Rather, he holds that we\ntypically formulate maxims with a view to satisfying our desires, but\nthat “as soon as we draw up maxims of the will for\nourselves” we become immediately conscious of the moral law\n(5:29). This immediate consciousness of the moral law takes the\nfollowing form: \nIn other words, to assess the moral permissibility of my maxim, I ask\nwhether everyone could act on it, or whether it could be willed as a universal\nlaw. The issue is not whether it would be good if everyone acted on my\nmaxim, or whether I would like it, but only whether it would be\npossible for my maxim to be willed as a universal law. This gets at the form, not\nthe matter or content, of the maxim. A maxim has morally permissible\nform, for Kant, only if it could be willed as a universal law. If my maxim fails\nthis test, as this one does, then it is morally impermissible for me to\nact on it. \nIf my maxim passes the universal law test, then it is morally\npermissible for me to act on it, but I fully exercise my autonomy only\nif my fundamental reason for acting on this maxim is that it is\nmorally permissible or required that I do so. Imagine that I am moved\nby a feeling of sympathy to formulate the maxim to help someone in\nneed. In this case, my original reason for formulating this maxim is\nthat a certain feeling moved me. Such feelings are not entirely within\nmy control and may not be present when someone actually needs my\nhelp. But this maxim passes Kant’s test: it could be willed as a\nuniversal law that everyone help others in need from motives of\nsympathy. So it would not be wrong to act on this maxim when the\nfeeling of sympathy so moves me.  But helping others in need would not\nfully exercise my autonomy unless my fundamental reason for doing so\nis not that I have some feeling or desire, but rather that it would be\nright or at least permissible to do so. Only when such a purely formal\nprinciple supplies the fundamental motive for my action do I act\nautonomously. \nSo the moral law is a law of autonomy in the sense that “freedom\nand unconditional practical law reciprocally imply each another”\n(5:29).  Even when my maxims are originally suggested by my feelings\nand desires, if I act only on morally permissible (or required) maxims\nbecause they are morally permissible (or required), then my actions\nwill be autonomous. And the reverse is true as well: for Kant this is\nthe only way to act\n autonomously.[22] \n\nKant holds that reason unavoidably produces not only consciousness\nof the moral law but also the idea of a world in which there is both\ncomplete virtue and complete happiness, which he calls the highest\ngood. Our duty to promote the highest good, on Kant’s view, is the sum\nof all moral duties, and we can fulfill this duty only if we believe\nthat the highest good is a possible state of affairs. Furthermore, we\ncan believe that the highest good is possible only if we also believe\nin the immortality of the soul and the existence of God, according to\nKant. On this basis, he claims that it is morally necessary to believe\nin the immortality of the soul and the existence of God, which he calls\npostulates of pure practical reason. This section briefly outlines\nKant’s view of the highest good and his argument for these practical\npostulates in the Critique of Practical Reason and other works. \n\nIn the previous section we saw that, on Kant’s view, the moral law is\na purely formal principle that commands us to act only on maxims that\nhave what he calls lawgiving form, which maxims have only if they can\nbe willed as universal laws. Moreover, our fundamental reason for\nchoosing to act on such maxims should be that they have this lawgiving\nform, rather than that acting on them would achieve some end or goal\nthat would satisfy a desire (5:27). For example, I should help others\nin need not, at bottom, because doing so would make me feel good, even\nif it would, but rather because it is right; and it is right (or\npermissible) to help others in need because this maxim can be willed\nas a universal law. \nAlthough Kant holds that the morality of an action depends on the\nform of its maxim rather than its end or goal, he nevertheless claims\nboth that every human action has an end and that we are unavoidably\nconcerned with the consequences of our actions (4:437; 5:34; 6:5–7,\n385). This is not a moral requirement but simply part of what it means\nto be a rational being. Moreover, Kant also holds the stronger view\nthat it is an unavoidable feature of human reason that we form ideas\nnot only about the immediate and near-term consequences of our actions,\nbut also about ultimate consequences. This is the practical\nmanifestation of reason’s general demand for what Kant calls “the\nunconditioned”\n (5:107–108).[23]\n In particular, since\nwe naturally have desires and inclinations, and our reason has “a\ncommission” to attend to the satisfaction of our desires and\ninclinations, on Kant’s view we unavoidably form an idea of the maximal\nsatisfaction of all our inclinations and desires, which he calls\nhappiness (5:61, 22, 124). This idea is indeterminate, however, since\nnobody can know “what he really wishes and wills” and thus what would\nmake him completely happy (4:418). We also form the idea of a moral\nworld or realm of ends, in which everyone acts only in accordance with\nmaxims that can be universal laws (A808/B836, 4:433ff.). \nBut neither of these ideas by itself expresses our unconditionally\ncomplete end, as human reason demands in its practical use. A perfectly\nmoral world by itself would not constitute our “whole and complete good\n[…] even in the judgment of an impartial reason,” because it is human\nnature also to need happiness (5:110, 25). And happiness by itself\nwould not be unconditionally good, because moral virtue is a condition\nof worthiness to be happy (5:111). So our unconditionally complete end\nmust combine both virtue and happiness. In Kant’s words, “virtue and\nhappiness together constitute possession of the highest good in a\nperson, and happiness distributed in exact proportion to morality (as\nthe worth of a person and his worthiness to be happy) constitutes the\nhighest good of a possible world” (5:110–111). It is this ideal world\ncombining complete virtue with complete happiness that Kant normally\nhas in mind when he discusses the highest good. \nKant says that we have a duty to promote the highest good, taken in\nthis sense (5:125). He does not mean, however, to be identifying some\nnew duty that is not derived from the moral law, in addition to all the\nparticular duties we have that are derived from the moral\n law.[24]\n For example, he\nis not claiming that in addition to my duties to help others in need,\nnot to commit theft, etc., I also have the additional duty to represent\nthe highest good as the final end of all moral conduct, combined with\nhappiness, and to promote that end. Rather, as we have seen, Kant holds\nthat it is an unavoidable feature of human reasoning, instead of a\nmoral requirement, that we represent all particular duties as leading\ntoward the promotion of the highest good. So the duty to promote the\nhighest good is not a particular duty at all, but the sum of all our\nduties derived from the moral law – it “does not increase the number of\nmorality’s duties but rather provides these with a special point of\nreference for the unification of all ends” (6:5). Nor does Kant mean\nthat anyone has a duty to realize or actually bring about the highest\ngood through their own power, although his language sometimes suggests\nthis (5:113, 122). Rather, at least in his later works Kant claims that\nonly the common striving of an entire “ethical community” can actually\nproduce the highest good, and that the duty of individuals is to\npromote (but not single-handedly produce) this end with all of their\nstrength by doing what the moral law commands (6:97–98,\n 390–394).[25] \nFinally, according to Kant we must conceive of the highest good as a\npossible state of affairs in order to fulfill our duty to promote it.\nHere Kant does not mean that we unavoidably represent the highest good\nas possible, since his view is that we must represent it as possible\nonly if we are to fulfill our duty of promoting it, and yet we may fail at\ndoing our duty. Rather, we have a choice about whether to conceive of\nthe highest good as possible, to regard it as impossible, or to remain\nnoncommittal (5:144–145). But we can fulfill our duty of promoting the\nhighest good only by choosing to conceive of the highest good as\npossible, because we cannot promote any end without believing that it\nis possible to achieve that end (5:122). So fulfilling the sum of all\nmoral duties to promote the highest good requires believing that a\nworld of complete virtue and happiness is not simply “a phantom of the\nmind” but could actually be realized (5:472). \n\nKant argues that we can comply with our duty to promote the highest\ngood only if we believe in the immortality of the soul and the\nexistence of God. This is because to comply with that duty we must\nbelieve that the highest good is possible, and yet to believe that the\nhighest good is possible we must believe that the soul is immortal and\nthat God exists, according to\n Kant.[26] \nConsider first Kant’s moral argument for belief in immortality. The\nhighest good, as we have seen, would be a world of complete morality\nand happiness. But Kant holds that it is impossible for “a rational\nbeing of the sensible world” to exhibit “complete conformity of\ndispositions with the moral law,” which he calls “holiness,” because we\ncan never extirpate the propensity of our reason to give priority to\nthe incentives of inclination over the incentive of duty, which\npropensity Kant calls radical evil (5:122, 6:37). Kant claims that\nthe moral law nevertheless requires holiness, however, and that it therefore\n“can only be found in an endless progress toward that complete\nconformity,” or progress that goes to infinity (5:122). This does not\nmean that we can substitute endless progress toward complete conformity\nwith the moral law for holiness in the concept of the highest good, but\nrather that we must represent that complete conformity as an infinite\nprogress toward the limit of holiness. Kant continues: “This endless\nprogress is, however, possible only on the presupposition of the\nexistence and personality of the same rational being continuing\nendlessly (which is called the immortality of the soul). Hence the\nhighest good is practically possible only on the presupposition of the\nimmortality of the soul, so that this, as inseparable with the moral\nlaw, is a postulate of pure practical reason” (ibid.). Kant’s idea is\nnot that we should imagine ourselves attaining holiness later although\nwe are not capable of it in this life. Rather, his view is that we must\nrepresent holiness as continual progress toward complete conformity of\nour dispositions with the moral law that begins in this life and\nextends into infinity. \nKant’s moral argument for belief in God in the Critique of Practical\nReason may be summarized as follows. Kant holds that virtue and\nhappiness are not just combined but necessarily combined in the idea of\nthe highest good, because only possessing virtue makes one worthy of\nhappiness – a claim that Kant seems to regard as part of the content of\nthe moral law (4:393; 5:110, 124). But we can represent virtue and\nhappiness as necessarily combined only by representing virtue as the\nefficient cause of happiness. This means that we must represent the\nhighest good not simply as a state of affairs in which everyone is both\nhappy and virtuous, but rather as one in which everyone is happy\nbecause they are virtuous (5:113–114, 124). However, it is beyond the\npower of human beings, both individually and collectively, to guarantee\nthat happiness results from virtue, and we do not know any law of\nnature that guarantees this either. Therefore, we must conclude that\nthe highest good is impossible, unless we postulate “the existence of a\ncause of nature, distinct from nature, which contains the ground of\nthis connection, namely the exact correspondence of happiness with\nmorality” (5:125). This cause of nature would have to be God since it\nmust have both understanding and will. Kant probably does not\nconceive of God as the efficient cause of a happiness that is rewarded\nin a future life to those who are virtuous in this one. Rather, his\nview is probably that we represent our endless progress toward\nholiness, beginning with this life and extending into infinity, as the\nefficient cause of our happiness, which likewise begins in this life\nand extends to a future one, in accordance with teleological laws that\nGod authors and causes to harmonize with efficient causes in nature\n(A809–812/B837–840; 5:127–131, 447–450). \nBoth of these arguments are subjective in the sense that, rather than\nattempting to show how the world must be constituted objectively in\norder for the highest good to be possible, they purport to show only\nhow we must conceive of the highest good in order to be subjectively\ncapable both of representing it as possible and of fulfilling our duty\nto promote it. But Kant also claims that both arguments have an\nobjective basis: first, in the sense that it cannot be proven\nobjectively either that immortality or God’s existence are impossible;\nand, second, in the sense that both arguments proceed from a duty to\npromote the highest good that is based not on the subjective character\nof human reason but on the moral law, which is objectively valid for\nall rational beings. So while it is not, strictly speaking, a duty to\nbelieve in God or immortality, we must believe both in order to fulfill\nour duty to promote the highest good, given the subjective character of\nhuman reason. \nTo see why, consider what would happen if we did not believe in God or\nimmortality, according to Kant. In the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant\nseems to say that this would leave us without any incentive to be\nmoral, and even that the moral law would be invalid without God and\nimmortality (A813/B841, A468/B496). But Kant later rejects this view\n(8:139). His mature view is that our reason would be in conflict with\nitself if we did not believe in God and immortality, because pure\npractical reason would represent the moral law as authoritative for us\nand so present us with an incentive that is sufficient to determine our\nwill; but pure theoretical (i.e., speculative) reason would undermine\nthis incentive by declaring morality an empty ideal, since it would not\nbe able to conceive of the highest good as possible (5:121, 143,\n471–472, 450–453). In other words, the moral law would remain valid and\nprovide any rational being with sufficient incentive to act from duty,\nbut we would be incapable of acting as rational beings, since “it is a\ncondition of having reason at all […] that its principles and\naffirmations must not contradict one another” (5:120). The only way to\nbring speculative and practical reason “into that relation of equality\nin which reason in general can be used purposively” is to affirm the\npostulates on the grounds that pure practical reason has primacy over\nspeculative reason. This means, Kant explains, that if the capacity of\nspeculative reason “does not extend to establishing certain\npropositions affirmatively, although they do not contradict it, as soon\nas these same propositions belong inseparably to the practical interest\nof pure reason it must accept them […,] being mindful, however, that\nthese are not its insights but are yet extensions of its use from\nanother, namely a practical perspective” (5:121). The primacy of\npractical reason is a key element of Kant’s response to the crisis of\nthe Enlightenment, since he holds that reason deserves the sovereign\nauthority entrusted to it by the Enlightenment only on this basis. \n\nThis final section briefly discusses how Kant attempts to unify the\ntheoretical and practical parts of his philosophical system in the\nCritique of the Power of Judgment. \n\nIn the Preface and Introduction to the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment, Kant announces that his goal in the work is to “bring\n[his] entire critical enterprise to an end” by bridging the\n“gulf” or “chasm” that separates the domain of\nhis theoretical philosophy (discussed mainly in the Critique of Pure\nReason) from the domain of his practical philosophy (discussed mainly\nin the Critique of Practical Reason) (5:170, 176, 195). In his words:\n“The understanding legislates a priori for nature, as object of\nthe senses, for a theoretical cognition of it in a possible\nexperience. Reason legislates a priori for freedom and its own\ncausality, as the supersensible in the subject, for an unconditioned\npractical cognition. The domain of the concept of nature under the one\nlegislation and that of the concept of freedom under the other are\nentirely barred from any mutual influence that they could have on each\nother by themselves (each in accordance with its fundamental laws) by\nthe great chasm that separates the supersensible from the\nappearances” (5:195). \nOne way to understand the problem Kant is articulating here is to\nconsider it once again in terms of the crisis of the\n Enlightenment.[27]\n The crisis was that\nmodern science threatened to undermine traditional moral and religious\nbeliefs, and Kant’s response is to argue that in fact these essential\ninterests of humanity are consistent with one another when reason is\ngranted sovereignty and practical reason is given primacy over\nspeculative reason. But the transcendental idealist framework within\nwhich Kant develops this response seems to purchase the consistency of\nthese interests at the price of sacrificing a unified view of the world\nand our place in it. If science applies only to appearances, while\nmoral and religious beliefs refer to things in themselves or “the\nsupersensible,” then how can we integrate these into a single\nconception of the world that enables us to transition from the one\ndomain to the other? Kant’s solution is to introduce a third a priori\ncognitive faculty, which he calls the reflecting power of judgment,\nthat gives us a teleological perspective on the world. Reflecting\njudgment provides the concept of teleology or purposiveness that\nbridges the chasm between nature and freedom, and thus unifies the\ntheoretical and practical parts of Kant’s philosophy into a single\nsystem (5:196–197). \nIt is important to Kant that a third faculty independent of both\nunderstanding and reason provides this mediating perspective, because\nhe holds that we do not have adequate theoretical grounds for\nattributing objective teleology to nature itself, and yet regarding\nnature as teleological solely on moral grounds would only heighten the\ndisconnect between our scientific and moral ways of viewing the world.\nTheoretical grounds do not justify us in attributing objective\nteleology to nature, because it is not a condition of\nself-consciousness that our understanding construct experience in\naccordance with the concept of teleology, which is not among Kant’s\ncategories or the principles of pure understanding that ground the\nfundamental laws of nature. That is why his theoretical philosophy\nlicenses us only in attributing mechanical causation to nature itself. To this limited extent, Kant is sympathetic to the dominant strain in modern\nphilosophy that banishes final causes from nature and instead treats\nnature as nothing but matter in motion, which can be fully described\nmathematically. But Kant wants somehow to reconcile this mechanistic\nview of nature with a conception of human agency that is essentially\nteleological. As we saw in the previous section, Kant holds that\nevery human action has an end and that the sum of all moral duties is\nto promote the highest good. It is essential to Kant’s approach,\nhowever, to maintain the autonomy of both understanding (in nature)\nand reason (in morality), without allowing either to encroach on the\nother’s domain, and yet to harmonize them in a single system. This\nharmony can be orchestrated only from an independent standpoint, from\nwhich we do not judge how nature is constituted objectively (that is\nthe job of understanding) or how the world ought to be (the job of\nreason), but from which we merely regulate or reflect on our cognition\nin a way that enables us to regard it as systematically unified.\nAccording to Kant, this is the task of reflecting judgment, whose a\npriori principle is to regard nature as purposive or teleological,\n“but only as a regulative principle of the faculty of\ncognition” (5:197). \n\nIn the Critique of the Power of Judgment, Kant discusses four main\nways in which reflecting judgment leads us to regard nature as\npurposive: first, it leads us to regard nature as governed by a system\nof empirical laws; second, it enables us to make aesthetic judgments;\nthird, it leads us to think of organisms as objectively purposive; and,\nfourth, it ultimately leads us to think about the final end of nature\nas a\n whole.[28] \nFirst, reflecting judgment enables us to discover empirical laws of\nnature by leading us to regard nature as if it were the product of\nintelligent design (5:179–186). We do not need reflecting judgment to\ngrasp the a priori laws of nature based on our categories, such as that\nevery event has a cause. But in addition to these a priori laws nature\nis also governed by particular, empirical laws, such as that fire\ncauses smoke, which we cannot know without consulting experience. To\ndiscover these laws, we must form hypotheses and devise experiments on\nthe assumption that nature is governed by empirical laws that we can\ngrasp (Bxiii–xiv). Reflecting judgment makes this assumption through\nits principle to regard nature as purposive for our understanding,\nwhich leads us to treat nature as if its empirical laws were designed\nto be understood by us (5:180–181). Since this principle only regulates\nour cognition but is not constitutive of nature itself, this does not\namount to assuming that nature really is the product of intelligent\ndesign, which according to Kant we are not justified in believing on\ntheoretical grounds. Rather, it amounts only to approaching nature in\nthe practice of science as if it were designed to be understood by us.\nWe are justified in doing this because it enables us to discover\nempirical laws of nature. But it is only a regulative principle of\nreflecting judgment, not genuine theoretical knowledge, that nature is\npurposive in this way. \nSecond, Kant thinks that aesthetic judgments about both beauty and\nsublimity involve a kind of purposiveness, and that the beauty of\nnature in particular suggests to us that nature is hospitable to our\nends. According to his aesthetic theory, we judge objects to be\nbeautiful not because they gratify our desires, since aesthetic\njudgments are disinterested, but rather because apprehending their form\nstimulates what he calls the harmonious “free play” of our\nunderstanding and imagination, in which we take a distinctively\naesthetic pleasure (5:204–207, 217–218, 287). So beauty is not a\nproperty of objects, but a relation between their form and the way our\ncognitive faculties work. Yet we make aesthetic judgments that claim\nintersubjective validity because we assume that there is a common sense\nthat enables all human beings to communicate aesthetic feeling\n(5:237–240, 293–296). Beautiful art is intentionally created to\nstimulate this universally communicable aesthetic pleasure, although it\nis effective only when it seems unintentional (5:305–307). Natural\nbeauty, however, is unintentional: landscapes do not know how to\nstimulate the free play of our cognitive faculties, and they do not\nhave the goal of giving us aesthetic pleasure. In both cases, then,\nbeautiful objects appear purposive to us because they give us aesthetic\npleasure in the free play of our faculties, but they also do not appear\npurposive because they either do not or do not seem to do this\nintentionally. Kant calls this relation between our cognitive faculties\nand the formal qualities of objects that we judge to be beautiful\n“subjective purposiveness” (5:221). Although it is only subjective, the\npurposiveness exhibited by natural beauty in particular may be\ninterpreted as a sign that nature is hospitable to our moral interests\n(5:300). Moreover, Kant also interprets the experience of sublimity in\nnature as involving purposiveness. But in this case it is not so much\nthe purposiveness of nature as our own purpose or “vocation” as moral\nbeings that we become aware of in the experience of the sublime, in which the\nsize and power of nature stand in vivid contrast to the superior\npower of our reason (5:257–260, 267–269). \nThird, Kant argues that reflecting judgment enables us to regard living\norganisms as objectively purposive, but only as a regulative principle\nthat compensates for our inability to fully understand them mechanistically,\nwhich reflects the limitations of our cognitive faculties rather than\nany intrinsic teleology in nature. We cannot fully understand organisms\nmechanistically because they are “self-organizing” beings, whose parts\nare “combined into a whole by being reciprocally the cause and effect\nof their form” (5:373–374). The parts of a watch are also possible only\nthrough their relation to the whole, but that is because the watch is\ndesigned and produced by some rational being. An organism, by contrast,\nproduces and sustains itself, which is inexplicable to us unless we\nattribute to organisms purposes by analogy with human art (5:374–376).\nBut Kant claims that it is only a regulative principle of reflecting\njudgment to regard organisms in this way, and that we are not justified\nin attributing objective purposiveness to organisms themselves, since\nit is only “because of the peculiar constitution of my cognitive\nfaculties [that] I cannot judge about the possibility of those things\nand their generation except by thinking of a cause for these acts in\naccordance with intentions” (5:397–398). Specifically, we cannot\nunderstand how a whole can be the cause of its own parts because we\ndepend on sensible intuition for the content of our thoughts and\ntherefore must think the particular (intuition) first by subsuming it\nunder the general (a concept). To see that this is just a limitation of\nthe human, discursive intellect, imagine a being with an intuitive\nunderstanding whose thought does not depend, as ours does, on receiving\nsensory information passively, but rather creates the content of its\nthought in the act of thinking it. Such a (divine) being could\nunderstand how a whole can be the cause of its parts, since it could\ngrasp a whole immediately without first thinking particulars and then\ncombining them into a whole (5:401–410). Therefore, since we have a\ndiscursive intellect and cannot know how things would appear to a being\nwith an intuitive intellect, and yet we can only think of organisms\nteleologically, which excludes mechanism, Kant now says that we must\nthink of both mechanism and teleology only as regulative principles\nthat we need to explain nature, rather than as constitutive principles\nthat describe how nature is intrinsically constituted (5:410ff.). \nFourth, Kant concludes the Critique of the Power of Judgment with a\nlong appendix arguing that reflecting judgment supports morality by\nleading us to think about the final end of nature, which we can only\nunderstand in moral terms, and that conversely morality reinforces a\nteleological conception of nature. Once it is granted on theoretical\ngrounds that we must understand certain parts of nature (organisms)\nteleologically, although only as a regulative principle of reflecting\njudgment, Kant says we may go further and regard the whole of nature as\na teleological system (5:380–381). But we can regard the whole of\nnature as a teleological system only by employing the idea of God,\nagain only regulatively, as its intelligent designer. This involves\nattributing what Kant calls external purposiveness to nature – that is,\nattributing purposes to God in creating nature (5:425). What, then, is\nGod’s final end in creating nature? According to Kant, the final end of\nnature must be human beings, but only as moral beings (5:435, 444–445).\nThis is because only human beings use reason to set and pursue ends,\nusing the rest of nature as means to their ends (5:426–427). Moreover,\nKant claims that human happiness cannot be the final end of nature,\nbecause as we have seen he holds that happiness is not unconditionally\nvaluable (5:430–431). Rather, human life has value not because of what\nwe passively enjoy, but only because of what we actively do (5:434). We\ncan be fully active and autonomous, however, only by acting morally,\nwhich implies that God created the world so that human beings could\nexercise moral autonomy. Since we also need happiness, this too may be\nadmitted as a conditioned and consequent end, so that reflecting\njudgment eventually leads us to the highest good (5:436). But\nreflection on conditions of the possibility of the highest good leads\nagain to Kant’s moral argument for belief in God’s existence, which in turn reinforces the teleological\nperspective on nature with which reflecting judgment began. \nThus Kant argues that although theoretical and practical philosophy\nproceed from separate and irreducible starting points –\nself-consciousness as the highest principle for our cognition of\nnature, and the moral law as the basis for our knowledge of freedom –\nreflecting judgment unifies them into a single, teleological worldview\nthat assigns preeminent value to human autonomy.","contact.mail":"rohlf@cua.edu","contact.domain":"cua.edu"}]
