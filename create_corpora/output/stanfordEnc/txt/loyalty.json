It is\nconstituted centrally by perseverance in an association to which a\nperson has become intrinsically committed as a matter of his or her\nidentity. Its paradigmatic expression is found in close friendship, to\nwhich loyalty is integral, but many other relationships and\nassociations seek to encourage it as an aspect of affiliation or\nmembership: families expect it, organizations often demand it, and\ncountries do what they can to foster it. May one also have loyalty to\nprinciples or other abstractions? Derivatively. Two key issues in the\ndiscussion of loyalty concern its status as a virtue and, if that\nstatus is granted, the limits to which loyalty ought to be\nsubject.\n\n\n\nUntil recently, loyalty did not attract much attention in Western\nphilosophical writing. Most of the detailed engagement with loyalty\ncame from creative writers (Aeschylus, Galsworthy, Conrad), business\nand marketing scholars (Goman; Jacoby & Chestnut), psychologists\n(Zdaniuk & Levine), psychiatrists\n(Böszörményi-Nagy), sociologists (Connor), religion\nscholars (Sakenfeld; Spiegel), political economists (Hirschman),\nand—pre-eminently—political theorists, who took a\nparticular interest in nationalism, patriotism and loyalty oaths\n(Grodzins, Schaar, Guetzkow). Because of its focus on familial\nrelations, Confucian thought has long been interested in loyalty\n(Goldin). The grand Western philosophical exception has been Josiah\nRoyce, who, influenced by eastern philosophy (Foust, 2012b, 2015),\ncreated an ethical theory centering on “loyalty to\nloyalty.” Royce has generated a steady but specialized interest\n(see, esp. Foust, 2012a, 2011).  Since the 1980s, though, some\nindependent philosophical discussion has begun to emerge (Baron,\nFletcher, Oldenquist, MacIntyre, Nuyen, Keller, Jollimore, Felten,\nKleinig), not only generally and in the context of political theory,\nbut also in the areas of occupational and professional ethics\n(McChrystal, Trotter, Hajdin, Hart & Thompson, Schrag, Coleman),\nwhistleblowing (Martin, Varelius), friendship (Bennett), and virtue\ntheory (Ewin). \n\nAlthough the term “loyalty” has its immediate philological\norigins in Old French, its older and mostly abandoned linguistic roots\nare in the Latin lex. Nevertheless, dimensions of the\nphenomenon that we now recognize as loyalty are as ancient as human\nassociation, albeit often manifested in its breaches (disloyalty,\nbetrayal).  The Old Testament writers were continually occupied with\nthe fickleness of human commitments, whether to God or to each\nother. To characterize it they tended to use the language of\n(un)faithfulness, though nowadays we might be inclined to use the more\nrestricted language of (in)fidelity, which has regard to specific\ncommitments. In medieval to early modern uses of the term, loyalty\ncame to be affirmed primarily in the oath or pledge of fealty or\nallegiance sworn by a vassal to his lord. That had an interesting\noffshoot as monarchical feudalism lost sway: loyal subjects who were\ntorn by the venality of sitting sovereigns found it necessary—as\npart of their effort to avoid charges of treason—to distinguish\ntheir ongoing loyalty to the institution of kingship from their\nloyalty to a particular king. \n\nAs a working definition, loyalty can be characterized as a practical\ndisposition to persist in an intrinsically valued (though not\nnecessarily valuable) associational attachment, where that involves a\npotentially costly commitment to secure or at least not to jeopardize\nthe interests or well-being of the object of loyalty. For the most part, an association that we come to value for its own sake is also one with which we come to identify (as mine or ours). \n\nThe nature of loyal attachment is a matter of debate. The strong\nfeelings and devotion often associated with loyalty have led some to\nassert that loyalty is only or primarily a feeling or\nsentiment—an affective bondedness that may express itself in\ndeeds, the latter more as an epiphenomenon than as its core. As Ewin\nputs it, it is an “instinct to sociability” (Ewin, 1990,\n4; cf. Connor). But feelings of loyalty are probably not constitutive\nof loyalty, even if it is unusual to find loyalty that is\naffectless. Arguably, the test of loyalty is conduct rather than\nintensity of feeling, primarily a certain “stickingness”\nor perseverance—the loyal person acts for or stays with or\nremains committed to the object of loyalty even when it is likely to\nbe disadvantageous or costly to the loyal person to do so. \n\nThose who focus on loyalty as a sentiment often intend to deny that\nloyalty might be rationally motivated. But even though expressions of\nloyalty are not maximizing (in cost-benefit terms), the decision to\ncommit oneself loyally may be rational, for one need not (indeed, ought\nnot to) enter into associations blindly, or—even when they are\ninitially unavoidable (as with familial or national ones)—accept their\ndemands unthinkingly. Moreover, once made, such commitments may be\nforfeited by the objects of loyalty should there be serious failure on\ntheir part, or they may be overridden in the face of significantly\ngreater claims. One loyalty may trump another. \n\nUnsentimental loyalties, such as the zealous but unsentimental\nprofessional loyalty of a lawyer to a client, are not unthinking, but\nhave their rationale in professional or associational tele,\nsuch as that of the adversarial system (however, see McConnell). It is\nto this shared professional commitment that the lawyer is ultimately\ncommitted, not as a matter of mere sentiment but of deliberated\nchoice. \n\nPosing the issue as one of either “practical\ndisposition” or “sentiment” is probably too stark.\nSome evolutionary biologists/psychologists see loyalty as a genetically\ntransmitted adaptive mechanism, a felt attachment to others that has\nsurvival value (Wilson, 23). Given what is often seen as the\nself-sacrificial character of individual loyalty, such loyalty is taken\nto be directed primarily to group survival (West, 218). But it is not\nclear what any such explanatory account shows. What\n“loyalty” may have begun as (defense of the group against threat) and what it has come to be for\nreflective beings need not be the same. Nor would it impugn what\nloyalty has come to be that it began as a survival mechanism (presuming\nan adaptive account to be correct). \n\nAlthough we often speak of loyalty as though it were a relatively\nfree-floating practical disposition—which it occasionally is—it\nis more common to associate loyalty with certain natural or\nconventional groupings. Our loyalty tends to be expressed in\nloyalties. That is, it is not just a general affiliational\nattachment, but one that is tied to certain kinds of natural\nor conventional associations, such as friendships, families,\norganizations, professions, countries, and religions. There is a\nreason for this. Associations that evoke and exact our loyalty tend to\nbe those with which we have become deeply involved or\nidentified. This is implicit in the working\ndefinition’s reference to “intrinsically valued\nassociational attachments.” Intrinsically valued associational\nattachments are usually those to which we have developed a form of\nsocial identification. We have come to value the associational bond\nfor its own sake (whatever may have originally motivated it). Our\nloyalties are not just to any groups that may exist, or even to any\ngroup with which we have some association, but only to those to which\nwe are sufficiently closely bound to call ours. My loyalties\nare to my friends, my family, my\nprofession, or our country, not yours, unless yours are also\nmine. In such identifications, the fate or well-being of the objects\nof loyalty become bound up with one’s own. We feel shame or\npride in their doings. We will take extra risks or bear special burdens for\nthem. \n\nAlthough our primary loyalties tend to be associations or groupings\nthat are socially valued, such that loyalty may seem to be an important\npractical disposition, this need not be the case. For in theory, any\nassociation can become intrinsically important to us, whether or not it\nis generally valued, and it may do so even if it is socially despised.\nFootball teams and coffee chains, gangs and crime families, may become\nobjects of loyalty no less than professional associations and\nsiblings. \n\nThis raises the important question whether judgments about the worth\nof loyalty are reducible to judgments about the worth of the\nassociations to which loyalty is given or the legitimacy of what is\ndone as a result of them. Does loyalty have any value independent of\nthe particular associational object with which it is connected or is\nits value bound up exclusively with the object of loyalty? There is\ndisagreement on this (paralleling disagreements about the\nobligatoriness of promise keeping). Some would argue that loyalty is\nvirtuous or vicious depending on what is done out of loyalty. Others\nwould argue that loyalty is always virtuous, though overridden when\nassociated with immoral conduct. Consider the complicated case of a\nloyal Nazi. Ewin would argue that because a Nazi can be loyal, loyalty\ncould not be a virtue, for the virtues are internally linked to the\nidea of good judgment. Whether that follows can be disputed. The loyal\nNazi might express that loyalty in a number of ways (as a husband and\nfather, as a compassionate co-worker, or as a scourge of Jews) and in\nat least some of these ways loyalty would appear to function as a\nvirtue (unless, perhaps, there is some special Nazi way of being a\nhusband). In the more interesting case of a loyal Nazi whose loyalty\nexpresses itself in anti-semitic forms, we could respond in one of two\nways. On the one hand, we could point to the fact that the loyalty is\nlikely to aggravate the harm caused. On the other hand, were such a\nNazi to act disloyally by allowing Jews who bribed him to escape, we\ncould argue that he is doubly deficient—self-serving and\ndefective in his capacity to form close bonds. Certainly the value of\nparticular associations is of importance to how we value loyalty to\nthem; but it is doubtful whether the value of loyalty is simply\nreducible to the value of the association in question.  \n\nIt has sometimes been suggested that “A can be loyal to\nB only if there is a third party C … who\nstands as a potential competitor to B” (Fletcher,\n8). It is true that many, if not most, expressions of loyalty occur\nagainst the background of some challenge to B’s interests\nwhose protection by A will be at some cost to\nA. Failures of loyalty often result in betrayal (of\nB, sometimes to C). Defending one’s\nspouse in the face of criticism may also subject oneself to\nvilification. Refusing to leave one’s university for another may\ninvolve a sacrifice of pay and opportunities. Patriotic loyalty may\ninvolve volunteering for military service when one’s country is\nattacked. Sometimes, though, the loyal friend will simply manifest the\nloyalty by being responsive to B’s need at some\ninconvenience. The loyal A will get up at 2.00am to fetch\nB when B’s car has broken down or will agree to be\nbest man at B’s wedding even though it will involve a long\nflight and great expense. No third party is involved, but there will\nbe a cost to A. The essence of disloyalty is more likely to be found in the blandishments of self-interest or self-maximization than in external temptations (C). \n\nSome defenders and critics of loyalty take the frequent presence of\nC as a reason for seeing loyalty as inherently\nexclusionary. To put it in the words of the political consultant,\nJames Carville, “sticking with” B requires\n“sticking it to” C (Carville). No doubt some\nloyalties—especially political ones—frequently express\nthemselves in such terms. But jingoism is not necessary to patriotic\nloyalty (pace Tolstoy), and in most contexts the privileging\nof an object of loyalty (B) does not require treating others\n(C) badly. Loyalty to one’s own children need not involve\nthe disparagement of others’ children. \n\nLoyalty is generally seen as a particularistic virtue. That is, it\nprivileges certain groups or individuals. Although Royce made\n“loyalty to loyalty” into a universalistic principle,\nthere has been much debate concerning the relation between\nparticularistic obligations, such as those associated with loyalty and\ngratitude, and universalistic obligations owed to all by virtue of\ntheir humanity. Are particularistic obligations subsumable under\nuniversalistic ones (honor your father and mother) or are they\nindependently derived? If the latter, do they stand in permanent\ntension (obligations to the poor vs. obligations to one’s\nchildren)? How, if at all, are conflicts to be resolved?  The\ndiscussion has its modern roots in Enlightenment ideas of equal\nrespect and of what is therefore owed to all by virtue of their common\nhumanity. Both consequentialist and Kantian universalism have some\ndifficulty in accommodating particularist virtues such as loyalty, and\non occasion have eschewed the latter. As Godwin notoriously asked:\n“What magic is there in the pronoun ‘my,’ that\nshould justify us in overturning the decisions of impartial\ntruth?” (Godwin, vol. 1, 127). \n\nAlthough most classical theorists have tended to accord moral\npriority to universalistic values, there have been important\nexceptions. Andrew Oldenquist has argued for the primacy of certain\ncommunal domains defined by our loyalties (“all morality is\ntribal morality”), within which considerations of impartiality\nmay operate: “our wide and narrow loyalties define moral\ncommunities or domains within which we are willing to universalize\nmoral judgments, treat equals equally, protect the common good, and in\nother ways adopt the familiar machinery of impersonal morality”\n(Oldenquist, 178, 177). Although Oldenquist denies that there is a\nnontribal, universalist morality, thus seeking to deprive the\nuniversalist of any independent traction, he does not do much to\nestablish the primacy of the tribal apart from its temporal\npriority. \n\nBernard Williams has argued that if the claims of universalism\n(whether of the consequentialist or Kantian kind) are given\npre-eminence, they will alienate people from their “ground\nprojects,” where the latter include the deep attachments\nassociated with loyalties. Williams obviously has a point, though even\nhe concedes that such projects are not impervious to universalistic\nchallenges (Williams, 17–18). \n\nMany systematic moral theorists attempt to anchor particularistic\nvirtues such as loyalty in larger universalistic premises. R.M. Hare,\nfor example, adopts a two-tiered consequentialist position that seeks\nto justify the particularistic obligations of loyalty within a broader\nconsequentialist schema: we contribute more effectively to overall\nwell-being if we foster particularistic obligations. Reflecting on the\nparticularism of mother love and loyalty, he writes: “If mothers\nhad the propensity to care equally for all the children in the world,\nit is unlikely that children would be as well provided for even as they\nare. The dilution of the responsibility would weaken it out of\nexistence” (Hare, 1981, 137). Unfortunately, simply being aware\nof the larger schema may be sufficient to evacuate the particularistic\nobligation of much of its power—and, indeed, to call it into\nquestion. Moreover, it may overlook the distinctive source of the\nparticularistic obligation—not in the needs of children so much\nas in their being one’s own. \n\nPeter Railton has attempted to find a place for loyalties within a\nbroadly consequentialist framework that avoids both alienation and the\nproblem confronting Hare’s two-tiered system. According to\nRailton, there are good consequentialist reasons for particularistic\npreferences, consequentialist reasons that do not undercut but honor\nthe particularism of those preferences. Railton’s defense trades\non a distinction between subjective and objective consequentialism, the\nobjective consequentialist (whom he supports) being committed to the\ncourse of action available to an agent that would maximize the good\n(Railton, 152). That, he believes, does not require that the agent\nsubjectively decide to maximize the good—indeed, it may require\nthat the agent not make such calculations. Overall, then, a loyalty to\nfriends and family, and commitment to ground projects may maximize\ngood, even though, were one to make a subjective calculation, it would\nundermine the loyalty or commitment. Although there is some debate\nabout the success of this strategy (Wilcox; Conee), it goes some way to\ncountering the common perception that universalistic (or impersonal)\ntheories can find no place for particularist obligations. \n\nAnother two-tiered system, but of a nonconsequentialist variety, is\nsuggested by Alan Gewirth, who accords primacy to the principle that it\nis a necessary condition for human agency that all be accorded equal\nrights to freedom and well-being. That commitment, he believes, will\nalso be sufficient to ground special obligations such as those finding\nexpression in personal, familial, and national loyalties. It serves as\nsuch a ground because the commitment to individual freedom permits the\nformation of voluntary associations, including “exclusive”\nones, as long as they do not interfere with others’ basic\nfreedom. Such voluntary associations are formed not merely for\ninstrumental purposes, as contributions to our freedom, but are\nexpressive of it. A persisting problem for this account concerns the\nresolution of conflicts between obligations that arise out our\nassociational commitments (say, our families) and those that arise\ndirectly out of the general principle (say, to assist the world’s\nneedy). This is of course a general problem, and not just one for\nGewirth; but it puts a question mark against the success of\nGewirth’s distinctive project, which was to develop a systematic\nalternative to the moral pluralism that he associates with Isaiah\nBerlin, Michael Walzer, and Thomas Nagel. \n\nIt may be that particularistic obligations such as those of loyalty\nhave to be considered as sui generis, products not simply of our common\nhumanity but of our sociality, of the self-realizing significance of\nassociational bonds—most particularly friendships, but also\nvarious other associational connections that come to be constitutive of\nour identity and ingredients in our flourishing. That leaves, of\ncourse, the problem of resolving conflicts with universalistic\nobligations when they occur. We may, with Scheffler, wish to argue that\nthe reasons generated by particularistic associations are\n“presumptively decisive” in cases in which conflict arises\n(Scheffler, 196), though that would need to be integrated in some way with judgments about the value to be attributed to particular associations. \n\nThe primary subjects of loyalty tend to be individual persons, but\nloyalty is not restricted to these. Mutuality is a feature of many\nloyalties, and it is often a normative expectation of the loyal individual that\nthe collectivity to which the individual is loyal will also be loyal\nin return (Ogunyemi). Just as we personify organizations, regarding them as in\nsome sense responsible actors, so we can attribute loyalty to them \nor—more often—bemoan their lack of loyalty to those who\nhave been loyal to them. \n\nMay animals be loyal? Tales of canine loyalty are legion, and even\namong wild animals, especially those that move in social groups,\nloyalty is often said to be shown. To the extent that loyalty is seen\nas an adaptive sentiment, we may think that animals are capable of\nloyalty. That may be a convenient way of characterizing animal\nbehavior (what Aristotle refers to as a \"natural\" virtue), though, as Fletcher observes, the kind of loyalty shown is\nlimited because such loyalty cannot be betrayed. The dog who is\ndistracted by the burglar’s steak does not betray its owner; its\ntraining has simply been inadequate. It is the kind of loyalty that, if\ndisplayed by humans, would be characterized as “blind” and\ntherefore likely to expose one to moral peril (Blamires, 24). \n\nAs noted, the primary objects of loyalty tend to be\npersons, personal collectivities, or quasi-persons such as\norganizations or social groups. Some argue that it is only to such\nthat we can be loyal (Ladd; Baron). But that is at odds with the view\nthat almost “anything to which one’s heart can become\nattached or devoted” may also become an object of \nloyalty—principles, causes, brands, ideas, ideals, and ideologies\n(Konvitz, 108). Royce himself argued that loyalty is the\n“willing and practical and thoroughgoing devotion of a person to\na cause” (Royce, 1908, 16–17). In response, those who\npersonalize the objects of loyalty point out that we have equally\navailable to us the language of commitment or devotion and, in the\ncase of what is spoken of as “loyalty to one’s\nprinciples,” we have the language of integrity. \n\nThere is some reason to favor the more restrictive focus for\nloyalty. Our core loyalties, which also happen to be those that are\npsychologically more powerful (Walzer, 5), tend to secure the\nintegrity of our particular human associations. To the extent that our\nmoral obligations encompass not only our relations with other human\nbeings in general but also our relationships with particular\nothers—our friends, families, fellow citizens, and so\non—loyalty will be partially constitutive and sustaining of\nthese particular others in contexts in which narrow or short-term\nself-interest is likely to be better served by abandoning them. If we\nfurther argue that the core of morality is concerned with the quality\nof relationships that people have with each other, both as fellow\nhumans and in the various associative groups that they form, then\nloyalty will constitute an important dimension of that relational\nnetwork. Even the “cause” with which Royce associates\nloyalty is ultimately articulated in terms of devotion to a community\n(Royce, 1908, 20; 1913, vol. 1, xvii). \n\nAlthough the particularism of loyalty is sometimes thought to be\nmorally problematic, there is nothing in theory that prevents the\nparticular group being the whole human race (pace Ladd). A\nuniversalist particularism can be found in some environmental contexts,\nwhen the future of humanity is up for consideration, or—as it\nwas nicely illustrated in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein—when \nVictor Frankenstein decided not to jeopardize the human\nrace by creating a companion for his monster (Shelley, 187). In\ncontexts in which the human race can itself be viewed as a\ncollectivity, loyalty to it may sometimes be attributed. \n\nThere is, perhaps, a deeper point to the view that the primary\nobject of loyalty is “personal,” a point that may also help\nto explain why we are tempted to move from loyalty to people to loyalty\nto ideals. In identifying with the object of our loyalty, there is\nusually implicit in our loyalty a judgment that its object\nmeshes with that for which we stand. That is, embedded in those\nassociations to which our loyalty is given are certain presumptions\nabout the compatibility of the basic values attributable to the object\nof loyalty with those to which we are committed (not that the values\nthemselves are what ground the loyalty, for that might suggest that the\nloyalty is to the values). To the extent that we discover it to be\notherwise we have a reason for taking some action—either to try\nto bring about a change in the object of our loyalty (what Albert\nHirschman calls giving voice) or to abandon it (Hirschman’s exit\noption) on the ground that it has forfeited its claim to our\nloyalty. There may, of course, be some sort of persistence of\nloyalty despite a recognition that the object of loyalty is no longer\nworthy of it. In such cases, the loyalty seems to ride on some\ncommitment to an associational ideal (“He will always be our\nson.”). Nevertheless, though it may sometimes appear to allow for\nattributions of loyalty to the supposedly embedded values, our loyalty\nis primarily to the affiliational object or person, and not to the\nparticular values that it instantiates. The loyalty is to the\nobject of an association or relationship, that is, the person or\ncollectivity-in-relation. \n\nMark Twain and Graham Greene (“the virtue of\ndisloyalty”) notwithstanding, there is greater agreement that\ndisloyalty is a vice than that loyalty is a virtue. Perhaps the\nfrequency with which the demand for loyalty is used to\n“justify” engagement in unethical conduct has led to\ncynicism about its value. There is a certain resonance to the saying\nthat “when an organization wants you to do right, it asks for\nyour integrity; when it wants you to do wrong, it demands your\nloyalty.” What might it be about loyalty that makes it vulnerable\nto such uses? \n\nThere are those who, on the basis of their particular theory of\nvirtue, deny that loyalty could be a virtue. Ewin, for example, argues\nthat because loyalty can be badly placed and because, once formed, it\nrequires us not merely to suspend our own judgment about its object but\neven to set aside good judgment (Ewin, 1992, 403, 411), its pretensions\nto the status of a virtue are undermined, for the virtues are, he\nargues, internally linked to some idea of good judgment. \n\nThere are two problems with this account. First, the understanding of\nthe virtues may be thought too restrictive. As with loyalty,\nconscientiousness and sincerity can be directed to unworthy objects,\nbut conscientiousness and sincerity do not for that reason fail as\nvirtues.  It is arguable that had Ewin given consideration to the view\nthat virtues are not just practical dispositions that make possible\nand tolerable some form of common life but do so in a particular\nway—by operating, as Philippa Foot puts it, “at a point at\nwhich there is some temptation to be resisted or deficiency of\nmotivation to be made good” (Foot, 8)—he might have been\nable to accommodate them within a catalogue of virtues. \n\nThe second problem has to do with the idea that loyalty may require us\nto set aside good judgment. No doubt something of that kind is\nattempted by those who seek to exploit loyalty (and other virtues such\nas generosity and kindness). But the well-established idea of a\n“loyal opposition” should give pause to the suggestion\nthat loyalty requires complaisance or servility. Certainly, the loyal\nperson does not normally address radical questions to the object of\nloyalty, but limits them instead to what is seen as compatible with\nthat object’s interests. But the radical questions need not be\nforeclosed, even if a well-formulated challenge is needed to generate\nthem. If the setting aside of good judgment is sought, there is\nnothing to stop a person—albeit with a heavy heart—from\nquestioning whether the object of loyalty may have forfeited claims to\nit. The trust that tends to accompany loyalty need not encompass\ngullibility and credulity.In the ordinary course of events, the trust\nthat accompanies loyalty has a judgment of trustworthiness as its\nbackground. \n\nThe virtues are a mixed bag, conceptually and normatively. There are,\nfor example, moral and intellectual virtues, Christian and pagan\nvirtues. In the instant case, there is a distinction between\nsubstantive and executive virtues. \nInter alia, the substantive virtues include compassion,\nfellow-feeling, kindness, and generosity, whereas the executive\nvirtues include sincerity, courage, industriousness, and\nconscientiousness. Substantive virtues motivate us to act well, that\nis, to do good, and are critical to our moral relations with others\n(and, in the case of prudence, to our own interests as well). The\nexecutive virtues, or, as they are sometimes known, virtues of the\nwill, are important to the implementation of what the substantive\nvirtues require of us—sincerity in our compassion, courage in\nour kindness, conscientiousness in our generosity. They help us to\nsurmount obstacles to our doing good. Loyalty, like sincerity, is an\nexecutive virtue, and its worth in a particular case is especially\nsensitive to the value of its object. Like other executive virtues, it\ncan become attached to unworthy objects—one may be a loyal Nazi\nor sincere racist. But that does not make the executive virtues merely\ncontingent or optional. A world or person without sincerity or\nconscientiousness or loyalty would be a seriously deficient one. \n\nThe executive virtues are an important ingredient in human excellence,\nbut they should not be cultivated in isolation from other virtues,\nparticularly the substantive ones. When Aristotle discussed the\nvirtues, he argued for the importance of phronesis or\npractical wisdom in the application of the virtues so that they would\nnot be deficient, excessive, or misplaced. The virtues were never\nmeant to be possessed in isolation but as a cluster—one of the\nthings the ancients were plausibly getting at when they spoke of the\nunity of the virtues. \n\nThere is sometimes a further question about whether loyalty, even if a\nvirtue, should be seen as a moral virtue. Loyalty may be thought\nexcellent to have—even a component of a good life—but is\nit essentially a moral disposition? The divisions among virtues (say,\nintellectual, moral, personal, and social) are, however, at best\nunclear and probably overlapping. Kindness is almost always morally\ncommendable, but imaginativeness (often said to be an intellectual\nvirtue), courage (usually categorized as a personal virtue) and\nreliability (sometimes called a social virtue) may be shown on the\nsports field or by enemy soldiers as well as in contexts that render\nthem morally commendable. There may be no great value in attempts to\ndifferentiate loyalty (and other virtues) into rigid and exclusive\ncategories. What is almost certainly arguable is that a person who is\ncompletely devoid of loyalties would be deficient as a person\nunderstood inter alia as a moral agent. \n\nThere is a great deal of contingency to the development of\nloyalties. The loyalties we develop to family, tribe, country, and\nreligion often emerge almost naturally out of the process of nurture as\nwe become increasingly aware of the environmental factors that have\nformed us. Our identifications can be very deep, and are often\nunquestioning. For some writers, this unchosenness is what\ndistinguishes loyalty from other commitments such as fidelity (Allen).\nBut usually loyalty can be extended to consciously acquired relational\ncommitments, as we choose to associate with particular people, groups,\nand institutions. Here again, the loyalties may or may not develop,\ndepending on the extent to which those associations acquire some\nintrinsic significance for us beyond any instrumental value that may\nhave first attracted us to them. Such explanatory accounts, however, do\nnot justify the loyalties we form or may be inclined to form. Yet,\nbecause loyalties privilege their objects, the provision of a\njustification is important. \n\nFor some writers, the distinction between chosen and unchosen\nloyalties is critical. Simon Keller, for example, considers that our\ngeneral unwillingness to question unchosen loyalties exhibits the lack\nof integrity often referred to as bad faith. Once we have such\nloyalties—he focuses on patriotic loyalties—we are\nresistant to their scrutiny and self-defensively discount challenges to\nthem (Keller, 2005; 2007). There may be some truth to the view that we are\nmore likely to show bad faith as far as our unchosen loyalties are\nconcerned, but it may be difficult to offer that as a general comment\non unchosen loyalties. There may be no more reason not to call our\npatriotism into question when we see how our country is behaving than\nthere is not to call a friendship into question when we see how our\nfriend is behaving. It may be psychologically harder (and a moral hazard associated with loyalties), but that\ndoes not sustain a general judgment about unchosen loyalties. \n\nSome have treated arguments for associational loyalty as though they\nwere cut from the same cloth as general arguments for associational\nobligations. They have, therefore, embedded claims for loyalty in\n“fair-play” or “natural duty to support just\ninstitutions” arguments for associational obligations. But\nwhatever the merits of such arguments as grounds for general\ninstitutional obligations, they do not provide grounds for the\nparticularistic obligations that we connect with loyalty. They do not\ncapture the particularity of such obligations. Even consent-based\narguments are insufficiently particularistic. Leaving aside the\npossibility that our basic political or parental or other associational\nobligations may also include an obligation to be loyal, we may usually\nfulfil what we take those obligations to be without any sense of\nloyalty to their objects. Obligations of loyalty presuppose an\nassociational identification that more general institutional or\nmembership obligations do not. \n\nBut as valuable as loyalty may be for associational recuperation, it\nis not clear that we can link its justification only to its\nrecuperative potential. For even within a generally consequentialist\nframework loyalty may play a more positive role. The loyal alumnus who\ndonates $100 million to an already healthy endowment fund is\ncontributing to institutional advancement rather than stemming\ninstitutional decline. In such a case the loyalty expresses a desire to\nfurther institutional interests rather than restore them. The donation\nis seen as an expression of loyalty because it expresses a commitment\nto the institution in the face of (presumably) more narrowly self-serving\nalternatives available to the donor. An outside philanthropist might,\nhowever, choose to donate the same amount, though not out of loyalty to\nthe institution. \n\nMore critically, if loyalty is viewed simply in terms of the goods\nthat the associative object is able to secure or produce, the\nintrinsic value that the association has come to have for the loyal\nperson is overlooked, along with the sense of identification that it\nexpresses. It is out of that sense of identification that loyalty\narises. We return to this in c.  below. \n\nBut obligations of gratitude are not ipso facto obligations of\nloyalty: the brutalized Jew who was rescued by the Good Samaritan may\nhave had a debt of gratitude but he had no debt of loyalty (Luke\n10:25–37). Loyalty, moreover, may be owed where there is no\nreason for gratitude: as may be the case between friends.  Obligations\nof gratitude are recompensive, whereas obligations of loyalty are\nassociative. \n\nA broad justification such as this leaves unstated what associations\nmight be constitutive of human flourishing. Perhaps there is no\ndefinitive list. But most would include friendships, familial\nrelationships, and some of the social institutions that foster,\nsustain, and secure the social life in which we engage as part of our\nflourishing. To the extent that we accept that engagement with or in a\nparticular form of association or relation is constitutive of our\nflourishing, to that extent we will consider loyalty to it to be\njustified—even required. \n\nThe arguments that justify loyalty do not ipso facto justify absolute\nloyalty, though they do not rule out the possibility that, for\nexample, a person might legitimately be willing, out of loyalty, to\nlay down his life for another. That is often the case in wartime and\nmay also be true of some friendships. The strength of the claims of\nloyalty will depend on the importance of the association to the person\nwho has the association and, of course, on the legitimacy of the\nassociation in question. Not only may some associative relations be\nillegitimate, but the expectations of one association may come into\nconflict with those of another: we may have conflicts of loyalty. If\nthe conflict is resolved by giving one loyalty precedence over\nanother, it does not necessarily follow that loyalty to the one is\ndisloyalty to the other. It is no disloyalty to a friend who is\ncounting on me if instead I attend to my dying mother’s\nneeds. Sometimes such priorities will be straightforward; at other\ntimes not. Prioritization may, nevertheless, call for an apology and\ncompensation in respect of the disappointed party. Even if we decide\nunwisely (as did Robert E. Lee), our decision will not ipso facto\ncount as disloyalty.  Disloyalty is more often associated with the\nself-serving or hypocritical abandonment of loyalty. \n\nRoyce, who sometimes appears absolutist about loyalty, seeks to avoid\nthe problems of absolutism in two ways. First, he construes the\nloyalty that he considers central to the possession of a life over\nwhich one is sovereign as some reasonably chosen cause: unchosen\ncauses do not qualify as causes in Royce’s sense. And second, he\nthinks that his overarching ethical principle, “loyalty to\nloyalty,” will exclude the formation of loyalties that manifest\nthemselves in the invasion of other loyalties (see also Foust, 2012a;\nMullin). But the formality of Royce’s position gives relatively little\nguidance as to the content of loyalties that won’t interfere with\nother loyalties or even to some lexical ordering that would resolve\npotential conflicts. \n\nIt has already been noted that it is not part of loyalty to be\ncomplaisant or servile, though loyalty may be corrupted into such. In\nany plausible account of loyalty as a virtue there must be openness to\ncorrective criticism on the part of both the subject and object of\nloyalty. The “corrective” qualification is important. Not\nany opposition is permissible. A loyal opponent is not just an\nopponent, but one who remains loyal. What that entails is that the\nopposition stays within bounds that are compatible with the well-being\nor best interests or flourishing of the object of loyalty. Generally\nspeaking, a loyal opposition will not advocate (the equivalent of)\nrebellion or revolution for the latter would jeopardize the object of\nloyalty (and perhaps lead to its replacement by an alternative object of\nloyalty). \n\nIt is the commitment to opposition within (what are judged to be) the\nprevailing structures that has led some radical critics of loyalty\n(e.g., Agassi, Greene) to see it as—at bottom—a\nconservative virtue. It is conservative, though in a positive\nsense of that word: it involves a commitment to securing or preserving\nthe interests of an associational object, an object that is, or has\ncome to be, valued for its own sake (whatever else it may be valued\nfor). Nevertheless, the existence of a loyal opposition need not\npreclude the possibility that a more radical opposition might and\nindeed should subsequently be mounted. If the loyal opposition proves\nincapable of “reforming” the object of loyalty, the exit\noption (or something stronger) might be taken. In such cases it could\nbe argued that the object of loyalty was no longer worthy of it or had\nforfeited its claim to it. It is only if we mistakenly or misguidedly\nthink of loyalty as making an absolute claim on us that a derogatory\ncharge of conservatism against a loyal opposition will have\ntraction. \n\nFor heuristic purposes, we can probably distinguish a double focus\nfor loyalty—either a type of association (such as a state)\nor a particular instantiation of the type (such as the United States).\nStrictly, loyalty will be only to the latter, though it assists in\nunderstanding the limits of loyalty if we make the distinction.\nIf the type of institution is thought to be critical to human\nflourishing, then loyalty to it will be expected. But if the\ninstitution is of relatively minor significance, the development of\ninstantiations of it, along with loyalty to them, will be relatively\nunimportant (though not necessarily to those who develop such\nloyalties). Whether, for example, patriotism (that is, patriotic\nloyalty) is justified will depend in part on the importance to be\naccorded to a state or country. If we are social contractarians, then\nthe state (broadly conceived) offers a significant solution to some of\nthe problems of human association as well as an arena for social\nidentification. We might think that both a state and loyalty to it are\nimportant. That, however, needs to be embodied in a particular state,\nand that state may be such that the loyalty it should garner\nis forfeited by how it acts. \n\nLoyalty to a particular object is forfeited—that is, its\nclaims for the protection and reinforcement of associative identity and\ncommitment run out—when the object shows itself to be no longer\ncapable of being a source of associational satisfaction or\nidentity-giving significance. That is, the claims run out for the\nonce-loyal associate. (Others, of course, may dispute this.) But\nwhether or not loyalty is thought to be justifiably forfeited, the\nbreakpoint may differ for different people. Consider the case of\ninfidelity. For one woman, a husband’s infidelity may be a\nchallenge to the future of the relationship but not automatically\ndestructive of it. The relationship will be considered reparable. The\nissues of trust that are involved may be addressed and the relationship\nrepaired. But for another, such infidelity may collapse the structure\nin which the relationship has been housed. Essential trust will have\nbeen smashed like Humpty Dumpty. \n\nIs there a right and a wrong in such cases? Does the first woman\nlack an appreciation of the “sanctity” of\nmarriage/intimacy? Does the second fail to appreciate our shared\nfrailty and the possibilities for redemption and renewal? We should\nprobably not acquiesce in the relativistic view that what is right for\none is wrong for the other. At the same time, however, there may be no\neasy answer. The two positions constitute the beginnings of a\nconsideration of the nature of intimacy, what it reasonably demands of\nus, and how we should respond to transgressions of its expectations. \n\nThe same may be true of other loyalties. Our approach may be assisted\nby utilizing the earlier heuristic distinction between the general\nform of an association and its particular instantiation. We may be\nable to reach some general consensus on what a state might reasonably\nexpect of us. However, in any actual association with a particular\nstate the content of the bond may be individualized. \n\nThe issue of loyalty’s limits is usefully illustrated by the\nphenomenon of “whistle blowing.” Although there is some\ndebate about its scope, whistle blowing can be helpfully (if not\nfully) characterized as the activity of an employee within an\norganization—public or private—who alerts a wider group to\nsetbacks to their interests as a result of waste, corruption, fraud,\nor profit-seeking (Westin; Bowman; Miethe).  Because such employees\nare generally considered disloyal, it has been common to characterize\nthem as traitors, snitches, weasels, squealers, or\nrats. “Whistle blower” offers a more neutral way of\nreferring to such people, and permits an inquiry into the proper\nlimits of employee loyalty. \n\nThe normative background to whistle blowing is a belief that\nemployees owe loyalty to their employing organizations. Such loyalty\nwill include an expectation that employees not jeopardize their\norganization’s interests by revealing certain kinds of\ninformation to people outside it. If employees have grievances, they\nshould be dealt with within the organization (“we wash our own\nlaundry”). The case for whistle blowing, then, is driven by the\nrecognition, first of all, that internal mechanisms often fail to deal\nadequately with an organization’s failures, and second, that\nbecause the interests jeopardized by those failures often include those\noutside the organization, a wider group has a prima facie right to know\nof the costs that it faces or that have been imposed on it. \n\nBlowing the whistle frequently creates significant disruption within\nan organization—it may lose control of its affairs as it is\nsubjected to external inquiries and constraints; it may find itself\ncrippled by costs or other restrictions; and many within it who are\nlittle more than innocent bystanders may suffer from the repercussions\nof an externally mounted investigation. Because the whistle blowing\njeopardizes the organization’s interests (at least as they are\nunderstood within the organization), whistle blowing is therefore seen\nas a significant act of disloyalty. Whistle blowers themselves will\noften argue that owed loyalty has been forfeited (or at least\noverridden), so that no disloyalty has been perpetrated. Occasionally they will argue that whistle blowing can be an act of loyalty. \n\nA resolution to such conflicting assessments must address the issue\nof loyalty’s limits and, in the case of whistle blowing, it must\ntake cognizance of several considerations: (i) Because of the\ndisruption it threatens, the whistle should be blown only as a matter\nof last resort. (ii) For the same reason the organizational\nwrongdoing should be sufficiently serious. (iii) The public\ncomplaint should be well-grounded—the reasons that\nsupport it should be strong enough to be publicly defensible. (iv) A\npotential whistleblower should consider whether he or she has a special\nrole-related obligation to take some action. Although any\nmember of an organization might have some responsibility for what is\ndone in its name, some members will be better placed to make\nappropriate assessments of seriousness and may be more responsible for\nthe way in which the organization conducts its activities. (v) Because\nthe purpose of blowing the whistle is to bring about change, the\npotential for the whistle blowing to be effective ought to be\nconsidered. (vi) It is sometimes argued that the act of whistle blowing\nneeds to be appropriately motivated—it must at least be done\nout of concern for those whose interests are being jeopardized. This\nconsideration, however, may have more to do with the whistle\nblower’s praiseworthiness than with the justifiability of blowing\nthe whistle. A morally compromised whistleblower, however, may find his\nor her credibility undermined and the exposé rendered\nineffective. \n\nEven if the foregoing considerations are satisfactorily addressed,\nthere remains a question whether blowing the whistle is obligatory or\nmerely permissible. As omissions, failures to blow the whistle must\nengage with debates about the moral obligatoriness of our acting to\nprevent harm. Even if it is morally obligatory, though, there may be\nreasons for not making whistle blowing legally mandatory. In addition,\nthe potential costs to a whistleblower may excuse even legally mandated\nreporting of organizational wrongdoing (Glazer & Glazer; Martin).\nAlthough legal protections for whistle blowers have been instituted\nin some jurisdictions, they have often proved inadequate (Glazer &\nGlazer). \n\nAnonymous whistle blowing represents a possible solution; it opens\nthe door, however, to disruptive whistles being blown for the wrong reasons or\nafter careless investigation (cf. Elliston; Coulson). \n\nIn sum, the case of whistle blowing illustrates not only the\nimportance of loyalty to many organizations but also the care that\nneeds to be exercised when it is claimed that obligations of loyalty\nare justifiably overridden or forfeited.","contact.mail":"jkleinig@jjay.cuny.edu","contact.domain":"jjay.cuny.edu"}]
