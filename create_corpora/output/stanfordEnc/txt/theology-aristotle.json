Long\nsections of this translation went under the title Theology\nof Aristotle. The attribution of the work to Aristotle helped\nthe text to become an influential source of Neoplatonic ideas in the\nArabic-speaking world. But the Arabic Plotinus materials are important\nnot only as a conduit for Plotinus’ ideas; they also differ on\nnumerous points from their ultimate source. Thus the\nTheology, along with other texts derived from the Arabic\nversion of Plotinus, in fact constitute an interpretation of\nPlotinus’ thought, and not just a translation. The\nTheology in turn becomes the chief text conveying Plotinian\nideas to the Arabic-speaking tradition.\n\nThe so-called Theology of Aristotle is the longest, and most\nfamous, text to preserve an Arabic version of the Enneads of\nPlotinus. The Theology is split into ten sections (each\ncalled a mimar, a Syriac word for ‘chapter’). It\nalso has, at its beginning, a preface and some mysterious\n‘headings’ which seem to itemize points drawn from a\nstretch of Enneads IV.4. The preface begins with an important\nstatement of the provenance of the text, and is the source for the\ntitle Theology of Aristotle. More on this below in\n§2. \nIn addition to the Theology, there are two other extant\nsources for the Arabic Plotinus materials. First, the so-called\nLetter on Divine Science, falsely ascribed to al-Farabi but\nin fact based on passages from the fifth Ennead of Plotinus.\nSecond, a group of fragments or sayings ascribed to a ‘Greek\nsage’. Both the sayings of the Greek sage and the Letter on\nDivine Science have been shown to derive from the same Arabic\nversion of Plotinus as the Theology. In fact there are\npassages that show verbatim overlap between the Theology and\nthe sayings. \nThus one may speak more generally of ‘the Arabic\nPlotinus’, where this refers to the entire body of Arabic\nversions of Plotinus’ works. The original version of the Arabic\nPlotinus would have been more extensive than what is covered by our\nextant materials, since these materials sometimes break off in a\nfragmentary fashion. However there is no direct textual evidence for\nan Arabic version of any part of the first three of Plotinus’\nsix Enneads. That is, the texts just mentioned are based\nentirely on passages from Enneads IV, V and VI. These\npassages do not follow the order of the Enneads. Rather the\nextant translation jumps around from one part of the Enneads\nto another. This re-ordering may be an intentional or unintentional\nchange to an original Arabic version, which could have followed the\norder of the Greek. It is thus quite possible that the original\ntranslation covered most or all of the second half of the\nEnneads. But the coverage provided by the extant materials is\npatchy. \nIn fact the term ‘translation’ is somewhat misleading.\nAlthough the Arabic Plotinus does translate Plotinus’ Greek, it\nis often a free paraphrase. Also there are frequent interpolations,\nwith passages (sometimes as long as a whole paragraph) appearing in\nthe midst of the text with no direct basis in the Greek. These\ninterpolations, and in many cases the way the Greek original is\ntranslated or paraphrased, bring new philosophical ideas and concerns\ninto the text (see below, §4). Thus the Arabic Plotinus is an\ninterpretation or reworking of Plotinus, and not just a translation.\nThe interest of the texts lies in this philosophical reworking, which\nneeds to be borne in mind when assessing the historical influence\nexercised by Plotinus in his Arabic guise (see below, §5). \nThere is an Arabic edition of the Arabic Plotinus materials in Badawi\n1947a, and an English version (with the exception of some of the\nsayings ascribed to the ‘Greek sage’) in Henry and\nSchwyzer 1959. Gutas 2007 announces the project of re-editing the\nTheology. \nThe most thorough inquiry into the provenance and history of the texts\nis to be found in Zimmermann 1986, and his major conclusions have been\naccepted in most subsequent work on the Theology. Yet much\nremains a matter of doubt and speculation. \nOne thing that seems certain is that the Arabic version was produced\nin the circle of al-Kindi, a ninth century philosopher who guided the\nwork of several translators. Endress 1973, in a groundbreaking study,\nshowed that the Arabic Plotinus materials can be grouped\nlinguistically and thematically with other works produced by this\ncircle (see further below, §3). Furthermore, there is the\nevidence of the preface of the Theology itself. The preface\nbegins: \nAhmad ibn al-Mu‘tasim is the son of the ‘Abbasid caliph\nwho reigned from 833–842 AD, so this gives us a fairly reliable\ndate for the production of the Theology, or at least for\nal-Kindi’s ‘correction’ of it. This date may in fact\napply to the whole original Arabic translation of Plotinus. It is\nworth noting that this makes the Greek exemplar on which the\ntranslation was based earlier than our oldest Greek manuscripts of the\nEnneads. In fact we know that the Greek basis of the Arabic\nversion represented an independent branch of the tradition, since all\nour Greek manuscripts lack a section (at Enn. IV.7.8) from the\nEnneads that is transmitted indirectly by Eusebius, but is\nfound in the Arabic translation (in chapter three of the\nTheology). \nWe know of Ibn Na‘ima al-Himsi from other sources, too: he was a\ntranslator of the Kindi circle, and also rendered Aristotle (the\nSophistical Refutations and parts of the Physics)\ninto Arabic. Al-Himsi, like many translators of the period, was a\nSyrian Christian. This raises the question of whether he translated\ndirectly from Greek or from an intermediary Syriac version, which was\na common practice in the Arabic translation movement. Zimmermann\nargues that there is no need to postulate a Syriac intermediary,\nthough this has been questioned more recently (Bucur and Bucur 2006,\nbut against postulating a Syriac intermediary Brock 2007). \nMore provocative is the mention of Porphyry. He was a student of\nPlotinus and edited the latter’s works into the six groupings of\nnine that are known as the Enneads. We know that the\nTheology depends on this edition, because it preserves breaks\nimposed by Porphyry as he split up longer treatises in order to get\nthe number of Plotinian works up to 54. So when the preface suggests\nthat we are dealing with a commentary or ‘exposition’ of\nthe Enneads by Porphyry, this might just refer to the fact\nthat the original Arabic version was based on his edition. But since\nPorphyry tells us himself that he wrote comments on Plotinus, some\nhave wished to see in the Arabic Plotinus a translation of a work by\nPorphyry, which would be a reworking of his master’s thought\neven more closely based on the text of the Enneads than\nPorphyry’s extant Sentences. If this is right, the\naforementioned paraphrasing and philosophical additions would be an\nimportant body of evidence for Porphyry’s thought and his\nunderstanding of the thought of his teacher, Plotinus. However, this\nPorphyrian hypothesis was rejected by Zimmermann, and in this he has\nagain been followed by later scholarship. It may however be that the\nso-called ‘headings’ do stem from Porphyry. It has been\nnoted that these show a familiarity with Plotinus’ system that\nwould fit with Porphyrian authorship, and that there is philosophical\nand philological evidence to suggest that Porphyry’s lost index\nof main points in the Enneads could well stand behind this\nelement of the Arabic Plotinus (D’Ancona 2012a, Chase 2021). \nSuppose then that the Arabic Plotinus is based directly on the Greek\nof the Enneads, and not a Syriac version or a Greek\nparaphrase by Porphyry or anyone else. This would leave us with the\nsimpler hypothesis that al-Kindi’s circle itself was responsible\nfor the re-working of the Enneads. But even here, a question\ncould be raised: which member of al-Kindi’s circle is to be\ncredited with transforming Plotinian thought in this fashion? One\nmight further wonder whether the rather chaotic order of the passages\nin the Theology and Letter on Divine Science is\nmerely the result of textual catastrophe (with loose sections stitched\nback together to form the chapters of the Theology), or also\npreserves some deliberate re-ordering of the text. Both of these\nissues are matters of dispute. Thus Zimmermann 1986 and Adamson 2002\nthink that al-Himsi is primarily responsible for the text, with\nal-Kindi having contributed relatively little; D’Ancona 1995,\n2001 has suggested that al-Kindi may have played a larger role.\nHowever Adamson and D’Ancona, but not Zimmermann, believe that\nthere may have been deliberate selection and re-ordering of the text\nat an early stage. One reason to suspect this is that the individual\nchapters do seem to have internal thematic unity, though the order of\nchapters does not match the order of topics set out in the preface\n(D’Ancona 2011a). \nFinally, and most famously, there is the preface’s claim that\nthe work before us is ‘the book of Aristotle.’ While it is\nsometimes suggested that this misattribution was intentional—an\nattempt to win wider readership for the work or to give it authority\nunder false pretences—Zimmermann hypothesized that it is just a\nlater, ill-informed addition, based on a misunderstanding of the rest\nof the preface. After providing the information quoted above, the\npreface goes on to suggest how the Theology could be\nintegrated into Aristotelian philosophy. Essentially, the preface\ngives us to understand that the Theology will say more about\nGod and His relation to the world, and about the immaterial soul, than\nis divulged by Aristotle himself. On this plausible account, the Kindi\ncircle saw Plotinus’ thought as compatible with, and even\ncompleting, Aristotle’s thought; but they did not actually think\nit was by Aristotle. \nThis hypothesis would fit well with what we know about the Kindi\ncircle, which was devoted to the promotion and Islamicization of Greek\nphilosophy and science. Part of this project was the presentation of\nGreek thought as a coherent whole, and as relevant to the concerns of\nal-Kindi’s own time (see Adamson 2007a, ch.2). Towards this end\nthe Kindi circle translated not only Plotinus and works of Aristotle\n(including a painfully literal version of the Metaphysics,\nand a paraphrase version of the De Anima which takes\nliberties with the text in a way reminiscent of the Arabic Plotinus).\nThey also translated Proclus. \nThe story of Proclus in Arabic is similar ways to that of the Arabic\nPlotinus. It would seem that there was an original version of\nProclus’ Elements of Theology in Arabic, which is\npreserved now only in the form of later partial redactions and\nre-workings (on this see most recently Wakelnig 2006; the pioneering\nstudy is Endress 1973). Again, the most famous text to derive from the\nArabic Proclus is a pseudo-Aristotelian work: the Book on the Pure\nGood, known in Latin as the Book of Causes (Liber de\nCausis). Though not particularly influential in Arabic, the\nBook of Causes was a major source for Neoplatonic ideas in\nthe Latin west. It was announced as being based on Proclus, and not\nAristotle, by none other than Thomas Aquinas. \nThe Arabic Plotinus and Proclus not only have a similar textual\nhistory, but also overlap to a surprising degree philosophically. It\nhas been persuasively argued (see especially the pieces collected in\nD’Ancona 1995; for the context of the Arabic Proclus in the\nKindī circle see Taylor 2021) that this is no accident: the\nArabic Plotinus exerted a direct influence on the Arabic Proclus. To\ngive one obvious example, the more baroque system set forth in\nProclus’ Elements is simplified in the Book of the\nPure Good to yield a hierarchy identical to that of the Arabic\nPlotinus (God, Intellect, Soul, material world). On the other hand it\nhas been suggested (D’Ancona 2011a) that the Elements\nhelped to inspire the program of study outlined in the preface to the\nTheology. \nZimmermann hypothesized that the Arabic Plotinus and Proclus would\nhave formed parts of a large ‘metaphysics file’ (also\ncontaining works of Alexander of Aphrodisias) assembled by the Kindi\ncircle. Our preface might actually have been appended to the file as a\nwhole, and not just the Plotinian materials. This file would have\ncatered to the contemporary need to see how Greek philosophy was\nrelevant to the Islamic milieu. In particular, Plotinus and Proclus\nspeak at length about the unity of God and the way that God relates to\nHis creation, as well as about the human soul, its immortality and\nimmateriality. \nSince the Arabic Plotinus is first and foremost just that—an\nArabic version of Plotinus—philosophical ideas are primarily\nintroduced into the text by means of subtle, but deliberate, variation\nfrom the original text. Here is a particularly clear example,\njuxtaposing the first sentences of Enneads V.2 and of the\ntenth chapter of the Theology: \nThe One is all things and no one of them (to hen panta kai oude\nhen) (Plotinus, Enneads V.2.1.1). \nThe pure One is the cause of all things and is not like any of them\n(Theology of Aristotle, Badawi 1947a, 134). \nHere the notion of ‘cause’ and the idea that the One is\nnot ‘like (ka-)’ its effects are worked into the\ntranslation. The translation is still true to Plotinus’ thought.\nIndeed, in what immediately follows both Plotinus and the Arabic\ndescribe the One as a ‘principle,’ which in the Arabic\nbecomes a kind of gloss on calling it a ‘cause’. Yet the\nchanges soften the paradoxical effect of this opening sentence (which\nis itself based on Plato’s Parmenides, 160B). Nor is\nthis an isolated case. We frequently find interesting, if subtle,\nchanges introduced in the way that Plotinus is translated. \nA more obvious sort of change comes in the form of interpolated\nexcurses that have no direct basis in the Greek. A good example is\nfound at the conclusion of the first mimar of the\nTheology (Badawi 1947a, 27–8). This interpolation\ndefends a ‘non-literal’ understanding of Plato’s\naccount of the creation of the physical universe. We are told that,\nalthough Plato speaks as if the world came into being with a first\nmoment of time, actually this is misleading. He speaks in this fashion\nonly because of the difficulty of expressing causal priority without\nexpressions that imply temporal priority. The passage would seem to\nrelate to ancient Platonist treatments of the Timaeus, though\nthat text is not mentioned explicitly here (for the Arabic Plotinus\nand Timaeus see D’Ancona 2003). \nAgain, this raises questions about the provenance of the text. Despite\nthe continuity of vocabulary and style between the paraphrase and the\ninterpolations, one cannot exclude the possibility that the\ninterpolations are the work of a different author than the paraphrase.\nThe interpolation just mentioned is particularly intriguing, since the\nnon-temporal account of creation would fit badly with al-Kindi’s\nwell-known rejection of the eternity of the world (Adamson 2007a,\nch.4). \nAs shown by the examples just given, distinctive features of the\nArabic Plotinus often have to do with the One or First Principle. In\nArabic, the One is very clearly conceived as a creating God,\nfrequently given epithets like ‘originator’ and\n‘creator.’ On the other hand, the Arabic Plotinus\nacknowledges no tension between this idea of God as creator and the\nPlotinian metaphor of ‘emanation’ (Arabic words that mean\n‘emanation’ or ‘flowing,’ such as\nfayd, are prominent throughout the text). In general the\nArabic Plotinus agrees with Plotinus himself that God makes (creates)\nintellect directly, and then makes all other things ‘through the\nintermediary of intellect’ (on this see D’Ancona 1992,\nAdamson 2002, 137–42). On the other hand, it has been noted that\nthe Arabic version frequently assimilates Plotinian nous to\nthe One. The Arabic version embraces the idea that the First Cause\nthinks or is an intellect—an idea either rejected or mentioned\nonly with great circumspection by Plotinus (see D’Ancona 1997).\nHere we see the Arabic version undoing, to some extent,\nPlotinus’ distinction between Aristotle’s self-thinking\nintellective god and the truly first, highest principle. This also\naffects the way that the ‘return to the One’ is conceived:\nthe Arabic Plotinus tends to conflate this with the idea of returning\nto Intellect (Somma 2021, 87). \nThis is only one example of the Arabic version’s\nAristotelianizing tendencies. Another case, again having to do with\nGod, is a passage describing God as ‘pure actuality’\n(al-fi‘l al-mahd, at Badawi 1947a, 51-2) which\nintellect strives to imitate. This passage seems to betray the\ninfluence of Aristotle’s Metaphysics, book 12—and\nhere it is apposite to reiterate that the Kindi circle produced an\nArabic version of that work. On the other hand, one might argue that\nin such passages the Arabic version simply brings out the Aristotelian\naspects of Plotinus himself. After all, he too occasionally\n(especially in the unusual treatise Enneads VI.8) flirts with\nthe idea that the One thinks or is to be described as actuality. And\nPorphyry famously remarks in his Life of Plotinus (§14)\nthat the whole of Aristotle’s Metaphysics is present in\ncompressed fashion in the Enneads. \nAristotle’s views on god as actuality may have encouraged the\nauthor of the Arabic Plotinus in making the further claim that God is\nnot just pure actuality, but pure being, in Arabic\nanniyya faqat (D'Ancona 2011b). The etymology of the term\nanniyya has been a matter of some debate, and the influence\nof the idea that God is ‘pure being’ has been traced as\nfar forward as Aquinas (Taylor 1998). \nA final theological theme in the Arabic Plotinus is the notion of\ndivine ‘attributes’ (sifat). Some passages in the\ntext deny attributes to God, while others claim that the attributes\ncan be ascribed to God ‘in the manner of a cause’ or\n‘in a higher way’ (see e.g. Badawi 1947a, 130,\n156–7, 183, 185). It has been suggested that this theme relates\nto theological controversies in ninth century Islam (Adamson 2002,\nch.5) or to the negative theology of the Pseudo-Dionysius\n(D’Ancona 1995). \nThe problem of divine attributes and negative theology is closely\nrelated to one of the most striking interpolations in the Arabic\nPlotinus, which appears in the second mimar of the\nTheology of Aristotle (Badawi 1947a, 37): \nThis text is only part of an longer insertion which deals with an\n‘ignorance higher than knowledge.’ (This is often\nassociated with the idea of ‘learned ignorance’ or\ndocta ignorantia, though the phrase does not appear in our\ntext.) In fact, the interpolation describes two forms of ignorance,\nboth of which are superior to understanding or knowledge, albeit in\ndifferent ways. The first sort of ignorance is the ignorance a higher\nprinciple has of what is lower than it. It is better for the soul\nnot to remember or be aware of the lower world, for if it\ndirects its attention to the lower world it will fall away from the\nintelligibles. The second sort of ignorance is the ignorance the lower\nhas of the higher. For example, the intellect is necessarily ignorant\nof the One. If it had understanding or knowledge\n(ma‘rifa) of the One, it would have to be superior to\nthe One, in the sense of being causally prior to it. And this, as the\ntext adds in what follows, would be ‘very repugnant.’ \nOne might again detect Aristotelian ideas behind the argument: if,\nwith Aristotle, we believe that knowledge of something is the grasp of\nthe cause or explanation of that thing, and, again with Aristotle,\nthat intellect knows by being identical with what it knows, then the\nonly way intellect could grasp the One would be for intellect to be\nits cause. Having said that, the strikingly paradoxical way the\ndoctrine is presented has no parallel in Aristotle, and some have\nwanted to see in the passage some role or influence on the part of\nPorphyry (see Thillet 1971) or the Pseudo-Dionysius (see\nD’Ancona 1993). \nThe subject given most coverage in the extant Arabic Plotinus\nmaterials is the soul. Unsurprisingly, on this topic too it is worth\ncomparing and contrasting our text to the original Plotinus. Like its\nsource, the Arabic Plotinus recognizes various types or levels of\nsoul. The paraphrase is notably faithful to the idea of a world soul,\nwhich tends to drop out of the cosmologies of other Arabic\nphilosophers (including already al-Kindi). It has been pointed out\nthat the text maintains a clear distinction between world soul and\nintellect. This is a point of contrast with Porphyry and thus an\nadditional reason to reject the idea that our text represents a\nPorphyrian reworking of Plotinus (see D’Ancona 1999). \nAt the beginning of the third mimar of the Theology,\nthen, the world or ‘universal’ soul is listed as the first\nof four types of soul. The other three are rational soul, bestial\nsoul, and nutritive soul (Badawi 1947a, 45). Already here we see a\ngesture in the direction of Aristotle’s theory of soul. In\nanother passage too, a Plotinian allusion to Plato’s tripartite\nsoul is explained in an Aristotelian manner. Instead of giving the\nPlatonic tripartition of soul into reason, spirit and appetite, the\ntext glosses Plotinus’ remark by listing Aristotle’s three\nkinds of soul, namely reason, animal or sensitive, and vegetative or\nnutritive (Badawi 1947a, 20). \nSympathy for Aristotle’s theory of soul is apparent too in the\nArabic version of Enneads IV.7.85. In this\nchapter, Plotinus criticizes Aristotle’s doctrine that the soul\nis a perfection or entelecheia of the body. The Arabic\nversion, preserved in the third chapter of the Theology, by\ncontrast says that it is the ‘most excellent philosophers’\nwho described the soul as an entelecheia (using an Arabic\ntransliteration of the Greek word), and therefore sets out to discover\nin what sense this doctrine is to be understood. In other words, the\nArabic version takes it for granted that Aristotle’s position is\ncorrect, and that this position must therefore somehow be compatible\nwith the Plotinian position (on this see Adamson 2002, ch.3). The\nsolution, in brief, is that only the rational soul is the true soul,\nand it is independent from body. But soul is nevertheless, as\nAristotle thinks, ‘the form of the body,’ insofar as it is\nthe source of body’s form or perfection. \nBecause of all these differences between Plotinus and the Arabic\nPlotinus—and only a few of the most important have been\nmentioned here—it is worth bearing in mind that it was this\nreworked version used by later authors in the Arabic tradition. In\nlight of the Aristotelianizing tendencies of the Arabic version, it is\nappropriate that the Theology is cited in the Harmony of\nthe Two Sages, Plato and Aristotle, a work ascribed to al-Farabi.\nThe Harmony cites the Theology in support of the\ncompatibility of Platonic and Aristotelian metaphysics, on the issues\nof the a-temporal creation of the universe and the existence of\nPlatonic Forms (Adamson 2021). When al-Farabi refers here to the\nTheology, he evidently has in mind a more capacious work than\nour Theology of Aristotle, because he includes propositions\nfrom the Arabic Proclus under this title. \nWhether or not the Theology was by Aristotle, it was destined\nto become the key source for Neoplatonic ideas in Arabic. We see its\ninfluence over a period of many centuries, starting immediately with\nother versions of Greek texts produced in the ninth century. As\nmentioned above (§3) it was a chief influence on the Book of\nCauses, the Kindi circle adaptation of Proclus’\nElements of Theology. It also seems to have influenced the\nroughly contemporaneous version of Aristotle’s De\nAnima, and the treatment of the soul’s immateriality by the\nninth-century Christian author Qusṭā Ibn Lūqā\n(Giommoni 2019). \nThe high-water mark of its influence may have been the tenth century,\nabout one century after it was probably written. During this period,\nseveral Isma‘ili authors, such as Abu Ya‘qub al-Sijistani\nand al-Kirmani, adapt Plotinus’ hierarchy for their own\nNeoplatonizing metaphysics, and associate the levels of the hierarchy\nwith elements of Islamic theology. Al-Sijistani goes the negative\ntheology of the Arabic Plotinus one better, insisting that when\nspeaking of God we must negate even negation (see further Walker\n2005). Around the same time, Neoplatonic authors like al-‘Amiri\nand Miskawayh were influenced, directly or indirectly, by the Arabic\nPlotinus. The Shorter Healing (al-Fawz al-Asghar) of\nMiskawayh is full of terminology and doctrine from the Arabic Plotinus\n(see Adamson 2007b), and a compilation of philosophical material\nproduced in his circle draws on the text too (Wakelnig 2014).\nAl-‘Amiri, meanwhile, is one of the authors to transmit the\nPlotinian version of materials from Proclus (see Wakelnig 2006).\nNeoplatonic ideas related to our text also appear in authors like Abu\nSulayman al-Sijistani and his circle (on whom see Kraemer 1986).\nSomewhat earlier in the tenth century the Jewish philosopher Isaac\nIsraeli drew on the Arabic Plotinus, as well as works by al-Kindi\nhimself (see Altmann and Stern 1958). \nPerhaps during this same period, a text was written which re-worked\nthe Theology much in the way that the Theology\nre-worked Plotinus. This is the so-called ‘Long Version’\nof the Theology, which may emanate from an Isma‘ili\ncontext. It introduces yet further philosophical ideas to the text,\npostulating for instance a logos or ‘word’ that\nmediates between God and the first intellect. (On the Longer Version\nsee Stern 1983, Fenton 1986 and Zimmermann 1986.) The Longer Version\nwas the basis for the Latin translation of the Theology,\nwhich was produced in the sixteenth century. \nContrary to what one might expect, the Theology’s\nstatus as an Aristotelian work was not necessarily the key to its\ninfluence and transmission. Avicenna, for instance, expressed some\ndoubt as to its authenticity, yet he also composed a set of notes\ncommenting on the text. These are based on our shorter version (for\nthe notes see Badawi 1947b, 37–84, translated into French in\nVajda 1951 and discussed in Adamson 2004a and 2004b). The text went on\nto be influential in post-Avicennan philosophy. The twelfth-century\nthinker Suhrawardi ascribes material clearly drawn from the\nTheology to Plato, most likely because Plato is prominently\nmentioned in the Theology itself, at the end of the first\nchapter (D’Ancona 2004). Slightly later, the twelfth-thirteenth\ncentury author ‘Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi provides us with the\nchief evidence for the original ‘metaphysics file’ that\ncontained the Arabic Plotinus (see Zimmermann 1986 and above,\n§3). He paraphrased several works from this collection including\nthe Book of Causes (see further Martini Bonadeo 2013). \nFinally, we can mention the influence of the Theology in the\nSafavid period. Many of our manuscripts of the work were produced in\nIran under the Safavids and Qajars. It seems to have been read eagerly\nfrom early in the Safavid age, as we can tell from a preface added to\nthe text by the important early sixteenth-century philosopher\nGhiyat-al-Din Dashtaki, who may also have written a commentary to the\ntext (Di Branco 2014). It was also used by al-Nayrizi, a student of\nDashtaki (on him see Pourjavady 2011). Commentaries to the text were\nwritten by later Safavid thinkers: the famous Mulla Sadra (for a work\ndrawing on the Arabic Plotinus see Nasr 2014), and the seventeenth\ncentury by Sa‘id al-Qummi (for the latter see Rizvi 2007).","contact.mail":"peter.adamson@lrz.uni-muenchen.de","contact.domain":"lrz.uni-muenchen.de"}]
