There is no\ndifference in anything like the shape, size, or mass of objects. There\nis no difference in the number of entities. Even so, there is\na non-qualitative difference and it concerns you in\nparticular. According to this alternative history, you fail to\nexist. In your place, there is a distinct individual, Double. Double\nhas all the qualitative properties, whether mental or physical, you\nactually have, but, despite all these similarities, you and Double are\ndistinct individuals. So, according to this alternative history, you\ndo not exist.\n\nIs this alternative history of the world a possible one? And what\nshould we make of other alleged qualitatively indiscernible\npossibilities? For example, is it possible for a pair of siblings to\nswap their actual qualitative roles—i.e., where the actually\nfirstborn twin is born second and vice versa—but where\nno qualitative features of the world are altered? In a similar vein,\nsuppose, following Black (1952), that there could be a world\ncontaining only two qualitatively indiscernible iron spheres. Are\nthere yet other possible worlds where these spheres “swap”\ntheir respective spatial locations or are “replaced” by\nnumerically distinct yet qualitatively indiscernible\ndoppelgängers?\n\nAn affirmative answer to these questions\nentails haecceitism, according to which the world could\ndiffer non-qualitatively without differing qualitatively. So, if the\nalternative history described above where Double replaces you is a\ngenuine possibility, it is a maximal possibility—i.e.,\na total way the world could be—that differs\nhaecceitistically from actuality. Similarly, if it is possible\nfor twins to swap their birth orders while leaving all qualitative\nmatters unchanged, that maximal possibility also differs\nhaecceitistically from actuality.\n\nAccording to anti-haecceitism, there are no haecceitistic\ndifferences between maximal possibilities. Anti-haecceitism therefore\nholds that the world could not be haecceitistically different without\nbeing qualitatively different. So, for anti-haecceitists, the\nalternative history of the world described above is not possible nor\nare there are distinct maximal possibilities that differ solely in\nterms of individuals “swapping” their qualitative roles or\nbeing “replaced” by non-actual individuals.\n\nThis entry is a general overview of the issues raised by\nhaecceitism and anti-haecceitism. In Sections One through Three,\nvarious formulations of haecceitism are presented and the connections\nbetween haecceitism, haecceities, and essentialism are examined. In\nSections Four and Five, arguments for and against haecceitism are\nsurveyed. Section Six discusses the scope of haecceitistic differences\nand the prospects for accepting only certain kinds of haecceitistic\ndifferences. Finally, Section Seven briefly notes the significance of\nhaecceitism and its denial within various areas of metaphysics.\n\nHaecceitism is a modal thesis. Like other modal theses, there are\ncompeting metaphysical frameworks in which it might be expressed. Some\nof these frameworks involve a commitment to possible worlds or maximal\npossibilities, while other frameworks aim to do without these\ncommitments. To further complicate matters, some frameworks\ndistinguish possible worlds from the maximal possibilities they\nrepresent, while other frameworks collapse this putative distinction\nby identifying maximal possibilities with possible worlds. This\nsection surveys some of the options for formulating and interpreting\nhaecceitism, but, as Skow (2008, 2011) argues, any formulation of\nhaecceitism that employs the framework of possible worlds will\ntendentiously presuppose something about the nature of possibilities\nor possible worlds. For this reason, the proper formulation of\nhaecceitism is itself a matter of controversy. For modalists, the correct analysis of modality involves no\nquantification over possibilities or possible worlds. (On modalism,\nsee Forbes (1992), Melia (2003: 81–98) and Peacocke (1999:\n155–159).) Instead, modal notions are properly understood in\nterms of primitive modal operators like the box and diamond of modal\nlogic. Since modalists do without quantification over possibilities or\npossible worlds, haecceitism and anti-haecceitism cannot be expressed\nin terms of differences between such entities. But, following Skow\n(2008), the modalist can nevertheless characterize anti-haecceitism as\nfollows: Modalist Anti-Haecceitism:\nNecessarily, the world could not be non-qualitatively different\nwithout being qualitatively different. Within the modalist framework, haecceitism is therefore equivalent\nto the denial of Modalist Anti-Haecceitism. Those who reject the expressive limitations of modalism can help\nthemselves to richer ontological resources in characterizing\nhaecceitism. For example, if quantification over possibilities is\nallowed for, two distinctions among possibilities prove especially\nhelpful for formulating haecceitism. According to the first\ndistinction, some possibilities are maximal: they are total\nways the entire world could have been. So, for any possibility, a\nmaximal possibility includes that possibility or its negation. (On\nsome views, talk of possibilities including other possibilities is\nunderstood in terms of entailment. On other views,\n“inclusion” is understood in terms of set\nmembership—e.g., membership relations between sets of\npropositions. Here, inclusion is taken as a neutral bit of\nterminology.) In contrast, non-maximal possibilities like the\npossibility that Obama is human are less than total ways things could\nhave been. A second distinction among possibilities\ndivides non-qualitative possibilities, which are ways\nspecific individuals like Napoleon or Nefertiti could have been,\nfrom qualitative possibilities, which are not tied to any\nspecific individuals. So, for example, the possibility that Napoleon\nescapes Elba is non-qualitative, while the possibility that there are\nfour red objects is a qualitative possibility. (On some views, the\ndistinction between qualitative and non-qualitative possibilities can\nbe identified with or analyzed in terms of the distinction\nbetween de dicto and de re possibilities.) Granted\nthese two distinctions among possibilities, haecceitism can be\ncharacterized as follows: Possibility Haecceitism: There are distinct\nmaximal possibilities that differ only with respect to the\nnon-qualitative possibilities they include. According to Possibility Haecceitism, maximal possibilities\nthat differ haecceitistically include the very same\nqualitative possibilities and differ only in terms of the\nnon-qualitative possibilities they include. (While most everyone holds\nthat there are maximal possibilities that differ\nqualitatively and non-qualitatively from actuality,\nhaecceitistic differences are distinctive insofar as the divide\nmaximal possibilities that differ only non-qualitatively.) Although Possibility Haecceitism requires quantification over\npossibilities, it remains silent about possible worlds. But, for most\nrealists about possible worlds, quantification over maximal\npossibilities requires or is simply equivalent to quantification over\npossible worlds. Typically, such realist views of possible worlds\nidentify each maximal possibility with a unique possible world and\nnon-maximal possibilities with sets of possible worlds. And, while\nviews that reduce possibilities to possible worlds can employ\nPossibility Haecceitism to express haecceitism, some might be tempted\nto interpret haecceitism as a thesis about qualitatively indiscernible\nworlds. Such a view would attempt to formulate haecceitism as the\nfollowing thesis: World Indiscernibility: There are distinct\npossible worlds that are qualitatively indiscernible. As Lewis (1986: 220–247) and Skow (2008) point out, however,\nWorld Indiscernibility is a misleading way to express haecceitism\ngiven certain views of possible worlds. According to ersatzist views, which identify possible\nworlds with abstract entities like sentence-types, properties,\npropositions, or sets, the truth of World Indiscernibility will turn,\nnot on whether there are distinctively haecceitistic possibilities,\nbut on whether such entities are qualitatively indiscernible from one\nanother. (Qualitatively indiscernible entities share all\ntheir qualitative properties, while qualitative duplicates\nshare only their intrinsic qualitative properties.) So, if one holds\nthat sets or propositions have no qualitative features, then World\nIndiscernibility is true, regardless of one’s views about what\nis and what is not possible. So, for many ersatzists, the status of\nWorld Indiscernibility does not depend upon any distinctive modal\ncommitments, but is settled by apparently orthogonal questions\nregarding the nature of the entities with which possible worlds are\nidentified. (The inadequacy of World Indiscernibility as a formulation\nof haecceitism within the Lewisian modal realist framework is\nexplained below. Crucially, Lewis (1986) takes the issue of\nhaecceitism to turn, not on issues regarding qualitatively\nindiscernibility, but on how possible worlds represent de re\npossibilities.) In light of disagreement about which entities play the role of\npossible worlds, no characterization of haecceitism that makes\nsubstantive assumptions about the nature of possible worlds will prove\nacceptable to all ersatzists. (On ersatzism, see Lewis (1986:\n136–142), Divers (2002: 167–292), and Sider (2002).)\nDespite this, competing ersatzist views can employ their own\ndistinctive resources to provide formulations of haecceitism. For\ninstance, if possible worlds are identified with maximal consistent\nsets of propositions, haecceitism can be taken as the claim that there\nare distinct maximal consistent sets of propositions that include the\nsame qualitative propositions but different non-qualitative\npropositions. For other versions of ersatzism, alternative strategies\nfor formulating haecceitism that appeal to properties, sets, or other\nentities are available, but none that deploy contentious metaphysical\ncommitments will have a plausible claim to being a canonical\nexpression of haecceitism. Although formulations of haecceitism tailored to various ersatzist\nviews differ significantly, they typically share a commitment to a\none-one correspondence between possible worlds and maximal\npossibilities. This correspondence allows ersatzists to treat talk of\nmaximal possibilities and possible worlds as largely interchangeable\nfor most theoretical purposes. Ersatzists who accept Possibility\nHaecceitism therefore commonly endorse the following thesis: World Haecceitism: There are distinct maximal\npossibilities that differ only haecceitistically and there is a\none-to-one correspondence between possible worlds and the maximal\npossibilities they represent. Erzatzists can, however, reject World Haecceitism, and, as\nwe’ll see, the resulting view is an analogue of the Lewisian\nmodal realist’s “cheap haecceitism.” But, as should\nbe clear from the preceding, whether a given formulation of\nhaecceitism is an apt one greatly depends upon the background\nmetaphysics of possibilities and possible worlds. On issues that arise in formulating haecceitism, see Lewis (1986:\n220–247), Russell (2013a), Skow (2008, 2011), and Stalnaker\n(2011). Kaplan (1975) is an importantly early contribution where,\namong other things, Kaplan attributes the use of the label\n‘haecceitism’ to R.M. Adams. On the ways in which\nKaplan’s use of ‘haecceitism’ departs from\nnow-standard uses, see Stalnaker (2011: 54–62). For other issues\nin characterizing haecceitism, see Graff Fara (2009) and Torza\n(2012). While ersatzist views identify possible worlds with abstract\nentities, Lewisian modal realism identifies possible worlds with\nmaximal sums of (analogically) spatiotemporally interrelated\nentities. According to Lewisian modal realism, for any way things\ncould have been, there is some possible world that represents that\npossibility. Moreover, these possible worlds are no less\n“real” or concrete than our actual world. (Lewis\ncharacterizes these possible worlds as “concrete” only\nwith reservation, given competing, non-equivalent conceptions of the\nabstract-concrete distinction.) Within Lewisian modal realism, de re modality is analyzed\nin terms of Lewis’ distinctive and controversial counterpart\ntheory. According to counterpart theory, ordinary individuals are\nnot numerically identical or “bilocated” across possible\nworlds. Instead, possible individuals are worldbound, existing in only\none world, and possess their de re modal properties in virtue\nof bearing counterpart relations to other possible entities. Roughly\nput, counterpart theory holds that an individual \\(a\\) is possibly\n\\(F\\) if and only if \\(a\\) has a counterpart that is \\(F\\), where\ncounterpart relations are relations of qualitative resemblance between\npossible individuals. So, according to Lewis’\ncounterpart-theoretic treatment of de re modality, it is true\nthat Obama could have been a doctor if and only if there is some\npossible individual that appropriately resembles Obama and is a\ndoctor. De re modality is therefore a matter of resemblance\nrelations between parts of possible worlds although the relevant\nresemblance relations vary from context to context. (Lewis’\nviews on counterpart theory and counterpart relations change over\ntime, see Lewis (1968, 1986). On counterpart theory, see Graff Fara\n(2009), Fara and Williamson (2005), and Hazen (1979).) Since Lewis analyzes de re representation—i.e., the\nway in which entities represent de re possibilities—in\nterms of qualitative resemblance, counterpart relations never divide\nqualitatively indiscernible entities (i.e., for any qualitatively\nindiscernible entities \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in a given context, \\(x\\) is a\ncounterpart of \\(z\\) if and only if \\(y\\) is a counterpart of\n\\(z)\\). This commitment has serious consequences for the modal realist\ntreatment of haecceitism. In particular, it guarantees that\nqualitatively indiscernible possible worlds do not differ in terms of\nwhat de re possibilities they represent. Lewis therefore\nendorses the following thesis about the connection between qualitative\nproperties and what de re possibilities a world\nrepresents: Qualitative Supervenience: Facts about what worlds\nrepresent de re supervene upon facts about the qualitative\nproperties of worlds. As Lewis uses “haecceitism”, it is the denial of\nQualitative Supervenience and therefore the claim that non-qualitative\nfeatures of worlds at least partially determine what worlds\nrepresent de re. (On the relation of supervenience, see the\nentry by McLaughlin and Bennett.) For modal realists who would reject\nQualitative Supervenience, qualitatively indiscernible possible worlds\ncan differ with respect to which de re possibilities they\nrepresent. Non-Lewisian modal realists of this sort can\ntherefore hold qualitatively indiscernible possible worlds to\nrepresent maximal possibilities that differ haecceitistically. But,\nsince Lewis endorses Qualitative Supervenience, he claims that\nqualitatively indiscernible worlds represent the very same\npossibilities. Positing qualitative indiscernible worlds therefore\nprovides Lewis with no additional resource for making sense of\nhaecceitistic differences. (Lewis is officially agnostic about whether\nthere are any qualitatively indiscernible worlds. See Lewis (1986:\n224).) As a consequence, Lewis holds that we go wrong in assimilating\nquestions of haecceitism to questions about qualitatively\nindiscernible. For Lewis, haecceitism is an issue regarding how\npossible worlds represent de re possibilities. So, even if\nLewis were to posit distinct yet qualitatively indiscernible worlds,\nthey would differ non-qualitatively but not haecceitistically\nin the Lewisian sense. In this way, the Lewis’ concern with\nhaecceitism places question of representation rather than qualitative\nindiscernibility at the forefront. Since qualitatively indiscernible worlds are no help to Lewis in\naccounting for haecceitistic possibilities—e.g., where two twins\nswap their qualitative roles—and Lewis takes these to be genuine\npossibilities, he offers an important modification to his earlier\nversion of counterpart theory with the aim of explaining how such\nhaecceitistic possibilities are represented. Lewis’ modified\ncounterpart theory permits individuals to have multiple counterparts\nwithin the actual world. (See Lewis (1967, 1983, and 1986).) So, in\nthe case of our two twins, the firstborn twin has its second-born twin\nas one of its counterparts. In certain contexts, the second-born twin\ntherefore represents a possibility for the firstborn—namely, the\npossibility of occupying precisely the qualitative role of the\nsecond-born twin. In this way, the actual world and its parts will, in\nsuitable contexts, represent, not only the actualized maximal\npossibility, but also maximal possibilities that differ\nhaecceitistically from the actualized maximal possibility. Context\npermitting, each possible world can therefore represent a plurality of\nmaximal possibilities each of which differ haecceitistically from one\nanother. And, since Lewis’ modified counterpart theory holds a\nsingle possible world and its parts to represent distinct maximal\npossibilities that differ haecceitistically, it accommodates the\nrepresentation of such possibilities without multiplying possible\nworlds. Accordingly, Lewis describes it as “haecceitism on the\ncheap.” Understood in terms set out above, this “cheap\nsubstitute for haecceitism” entails Possibility Haecceitism yet\nrejects World Haecceitism. In denying World Haecceitism, Lewis forgoes a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between maximal possibilities and possible worlds. This\nfeature proves significant in several discussions about the tenability\nof “cheap haecceitism.” Graff Fara (2009) argues that, by\nrejecting World Haecceitism, cheap haecceitism cannot satisfactorily\ninterpret modal logic enriched with an actuality operator. Kment\n(2012) also argues that cheap haecceitism delivers an inadequate\ntreatment of chances and counterfactuals, while Stalnaker (2008:\n69–71) suggests that semantic considerations support World\nHaecceitism over cheap haecceitism. On early challenges to counterpart\ntheory, see Kripke (1980) and Hazen (1979). On counterpart theory,\nactuality, and haecceitism, see Baltimore (2014), Cowling (2013), and\nRussell (2013a, 2013b). This section discusses the connection between haecceitism and\nhaecceities as well as some of the central issues regarding\nhaecceities and other non-qualitative properties. Consider once again the haecceitistic possibility according to\nwhich you do not exist and a different individual, Double,\ninstantiates all of your actual qualitative properties. A natural way\nto describe this possibility is as one where the distribution\nof qualitative properties is just as it actually is, but\nwhere non-qualitative properties are distributed\ndifferently. In particular, this alleged possibility is one according\nto which your haecceity goes uninstantiated and the haecceity\nof a non-actual individual, Double, is instantiated in its place. Since haecceities like being Napoleon and being\nidentical to Socrates are properties uniquely tied to specific\nindividuals, haecceitistic differences are naturally explained in\nterms of differences in the distribution of haecceities. These\nproperties, sometimes called “thisnesses” or\n“individual essences”, are typically thought to have the\nexistence of the relevant individuals as a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for their instantiation. So, for example, if Napoleon\nexists, then, necessarily, exactly one thing, Napoleon,\ninstantiates being Napoleon and, if Napoleon does not exist,\nnothing instantiates being Napoleon. In addition, facts about\nthe distribution of other non-qualitative\nproperties—e.g., being five feet from\nNapoleon—are necessitated by the distribution of\nhaecceities and qualitative properties. (Here, talk of\n‘properties’ should be interpreted in the broad sense\nincluding monadic properties as well as \\(n\\)-adic relations.) Most\nhaecceitistic differences will therefore involve differences in the\ndistribution of haecceities as well as additional non-qualitative\nproperties like being five feet from Napoleon. While haecceitistic differences are commonly explained in terms of\nthe distribution of haecceities, haecceitism is not merely the view\nthat haecceities exist. To see why, notice that nominalists who deny\nthe existence of properties might nevertheless accept the modal\ncommitments of haecceitism, claiming that things could have been\ndifferent non-qualitatively without being different qualitatively. In\naddition, those who affirm the existence of haecceities and other\nnon-qualitative properties might still go on to reject the distinctive\nmodal commitments of haecceitism (e.g., denying that things could\ndiffer non-qualitatively without differing qualitatively). So,\nalthough it is common for haecceitists to posit haecceities and employ\nthem in characterizing haecceitistic differences, haecceitism is, in\nprinciple, independent of realism about haecceities given\nhaecceitism’s ineliminable modal component. Although haecceitism is not merely realism about haecceities, the\nmetaphysics of haecceities and non-qualitative properties is still\nrelevant for understanding haecceitism. Perhaps most importantly, some\naccount of the qualitative/non-qualitative distinction is needed to\ninterpret the thesis of haecceitism. Typically, this distinction is\nintroduced by way of example with haecceities like being\nNapoleon taken as paradigmatic non-qualitative properties and\nproperties like mass and charge taken as\nparadigmatic qualitative properties. When moving beyond these\nexamples, other non-qualitative properties are usually held to share\nhaecceities’ dependence upon specific individuals. For\nexample, being five feet from Napoleon is plausibly thought\nto require the existence of Napoleon while a qualitative property\nlike being five grams mass requires the existence of no\nspecific individual. Terminologically, non-qualitative properties\nexhibiting this kind of dependence are sometimes labeled “impure\nproperties”, “identity properties”, or\n“haecceitistic properties”, where “haecceity”\nis usually reserved properties like being Napoleon. Attempts at a philosophical analysis of the\nqualitative/non-qualitative distinction often take the connection\nbetween non-qualitative properties and specific individuals as a\nstarting point. For example, Hawthorne (2006: 8) says:\n“haecceitistic properties—such as being identical to\nJohn or being the daughter of Jim—are those which,\nin some intuitive way, make direct reference to a particular\nindividual(s).” But, while rough characterizations of this sort\nleave the (non-)qualitative status of other kinds of properties\nindeterminate or unclear, reductive analyses have been proposed with\nthe aim of providing a comprehensive account of the distinction. Adams\n(1979: 7–9) considers an account of the distinction that ties\nnon-qualitative properties to certain kinds of linguistic items. Lewis\n(1986, 2002) endorses views on which qualitative properties supervene\nupon or are appropriately definable in terms of a distinctive class of\n“perfectly natural properties.” Still other\nviews—e.g., Rosenkrantz (1979)—aim to analyze the\ndependence of non-qualitative properties on individuals and\ndistinguish non-qualitative properties in terms of this dependence. In\ncontrast, Diekemper (2009) and Cowling (2015) endorse primitivism\nabout the distinction between qualitative and non-qualitative\nproperties, taking it instead as irreducible or metaphysically\nfundamental. But, regardless of one’s preferred view of the\ndistinction, some account is owed of the qualitative status of\nnon-paradigmatic cases including modal properties like being\npossibly a statue, broadly logical properties like being\nself-identical, and, for those impressed by the analogies between\nindividuals and species, certain kind properties like being a\ntiger. Debates about the metaphysical status of haecceities are also bound\nup with more general debates about the nature of\nproperties—e.g., whether properties are universals or\ntropes, in re or ante rem entities, sparse or\nabundant, and so on. But, regardless of one’s preferred view\nabout the metaphysics of properties, haecceities do seem to have some\ndistinctive features. Unlike most other properties, haecceities are\nnot typically thought to be multiply instantiable—i.e., there is\nexactly one possible object that can instantiate being\nNapoleon—and, as commonly conceived, haecceities do not\n(without auxiliary assumptions) ground qualitative resemblance. So, if\none holds that all properties must be multiply instantiable or ground\nqualitative resemblance, then one must either reject haecceities or\nopt for a disunified metaphysics of properties. (On some competing\nviews of the metaphysical role of haecceities, see Diekemper\n(2015).) Within leading views of properties, various options are available\nfor developing a metaphysics of haecceities. For example, in an effort\nto assimilate haecceities into a class nominalist ontology where\nproperties are identified with sets, Lewis (1986: 225) characterizes\nhaecceities as follows: “So we get properties that are in no way\nqualitatively delineated, and some of these are haecceities of this-\nand other-worldly individuals. A unit set of an individual is one\nespecially stringent haecceity. Also, for any individual and any\ncounterpart relation, there is the set of that individual together\nwith all its counterparts, and this is a less strict sort of\nhaecceity.” The resulting view takes our talk of haecceities to\nslide between talk of properties distinctive to each worldbound\nindividual and talk of properties shared by individuals unified by a\ncommon counterpart relation. (On the broader conception, haecceities\nare non-qualitative in nature, while, on the narrower conception,\nhaecceities end up being qualitative, provided there are no\nqualitatively indiscernible worlds.) In contrast to this Lewisian\nview, other views attribute a more significant metaphysical role to\nhaecceities, taking haecceities to individuate or determine the\nidentity of entities and therefore figure into a metaphysical\nexplanation of facts about identity and individuation. Views that take haecceities to provide metaphysical explanations of\nthe identity of individuals suggest a noteworthy connection between\nhaecceitism and fundamentality. In particular, if we assume that the\nstock of the world’s fundamental properties (provided there are\nsuch properties) suffices to fix the distribution of absolutely all\nproperties, then haecceitism guarantees that qualitative properties\ncannot, on their own, fix the distribution of non-qualitative\nproperties like haecceities. As a consequence, haecceitism points\ntoward the conclusion that some non-qualitative properties are\nfundamental. So, for those who hold that fundamental properties are\nexclusively qualitative, either the assumed conception of\nfundamentality or haecceitism must be rejected. For the committed\nhaecceitist, a remaining option admits fundamental qualitative as well\nas fundamental non-qualitative properties. A further notable debate about the metaphysics of haecceities\nconcerns their modal status. Some, like Plantinga (1974), take\nhaecceities to exist necessarily. So, while being Napoleon\ngoes uninstantiated in possible worlds without Napoleon, it\nnevertheless exists in such worlds. According to other views like that\nof Adams (1981), haecceities are contingent existents, existing only\nin those worlds where their bearers exist. So, although being\nNapoleon actually exists, it neither exists nor is instantiated\nat worlds without Napoleon. For discussion of this debate and cognate\nones, see Diekemper (2015). On the general metaphysics of haecceities, see Adams (1979, 1981),\nCover and O’Leary-Hawthorne (1997), Cowling (2015), Lewis\n(1986), Swinburne (1995), and Rosenkrantz (1993). On epistemological\nand metaphysical issues about haecceities—e.g., whether\nindividuals can be acquainted with the haecceities of other\nindividuals—see Rosenkrantz (1993). On haecceities and the\nidentity of indiscernibles, see Robinson (2000). On haecceities of\nmathematical entities and their role in mathematical structuralism,\nsee Shapiro (2006: 139). Haecceitism and essentialism are controversial theses about de\nre modality. This section briefly introduces essentialism and\nthen examines its interaction with haecceitism. The essential properties of an individual are properties\nit cannot exist without instantiating. In contrast,\nits accidental properties are those properties that are not\nessential to it. (According to the modal view of essence, this modal\ncharacterization of essential properties provides necessary and\nsufficient conditions for essentiality. On non-modal views, this\ncharacterization merely captures a necessary condition. See Fine\n(1994) for the case against the modal view.) Essentialist theses claim that certain kinds of properties are\nessential to certain kinds of individuals. For example, according\nto origin essentialism, biological individuals have their\nbiological origins essentially. Origin essentialism therefore requires\nthat an individual like George W. Bush have his actual biological\norigins—in this case, Barbara and George Bush—in any\npossible world in which it exists. (On origin essentialism, see Kripke\n(1979) and Robertson (1998). On other essentialisms, see Cartwright\n(1968) and Mackie (2006).) Essentialist theses come in “stronger” and\n“weaker” forms. Weaker, less interesting forms of\nessentialism require that all individuals instantiate indiscriminate\nproperties like being self-identical or being such that\n\\(2+2=4\\). (Again, non-modalists like Fine (1994) deny these\nnecessary properties are properly counted as essential to all entities\neven while being such that \\(2+2=4\\) might be essential the\nnumber two.) Stronger, more interesting versions of essentialism like\norigin essentialism ascribe distinctive essential properties to\nindividuals. The strongest form of essentialism\nis hyperessentialism, according to which each individual has\nall of its properties essentially. So, for any individual, there is\nonly way that that individual can be. Intuitively, essentialism limits the de re possibilities\nfor individuals, while haecceitism extends the de re\npossibilities for individuals by admitting contentious\npossibilities—e.g., the possibility where you swap qualitative\nroles with Obama. It is important to note, however, that even the\nstrongest versions of essentialism, hyperessentialism, do not rule out\nhaecceitism. For, while hyperessentialism does rule out haecceitistic\ndifferences where you have different properties, it does not\nrule out a “mass replacement”—i.e., an alternative\nmaximal possibility where wholly different individuals occupy each of\nthe qualitative roles occupied in the actual world. These maximal\npossibilities differ haecceitistically even while there is no\nviolation of essence, since no individual exists according to more\nthan a single world. (Those who reject possibilities involving\nnon-actual or “alien” individuals would, however, have the\nmakings of an argument from hyperessentialism to anti-haecceitism.)\nAlthough essentialism provides no direct argument against haecceitism,\nhyperessentialism and other strong versions of essentialism do\npreclude certain kinds of haecceitistic differences where individuals\n“swap” qualitative roles. For example, just as\nhyperessentialism rules out any haecceitistic possibilities where you\nhave a different qualitative role, origin essentialism rules out\nhaecceitistic differences that involve organisms having anything other\nthan their actual biological origins. For this reason, a commitment to\nstrong versions of essentialism will constrain the range of admissible\nhaecceitistic differences. Weak forms of essentialism have few consequences for\nhaecceitism. Moreover, the thesis that individuals have their\nhaecceities essentially is often taken as a prerequisite for a\ncommitment to haecceitism, since the thesis sometimes called\n“extreme haecceitism” holds that haecceities are\nthe only essential properties of individuals aside from\nperfectly general properties instantiated by all entities\n(e.g., being self-identical). According to extreme\nhaecceitists, not only could Napoleon have been a poached egg, the\nworld could have been qualitatively just as it actually is but such\nthat a poached egg and Napoleon swap their respective qualitative\nroles. Extreme haecceitism is therefore among the most permissive\nviews about de re modality and admits possibilities where you\noccupy the qualitative roles of a poached egg. For this reason,\nextreme haecceitism is typically (albeit confusingly) classified as a\nversion of “anti-essentialism”, by virtue of denying that\nindividuals have distinctive essences apart from their respective\nhaecceities. (On anti-essentialism and extreme haecceitism, see Heller\n(2005), Stalnaker (1979), and Lewis (1986). See Mackie (2006) for a\ndefense of “minimal essentialism”, according to which\nindividuals have their haecceities and belong to their ontological\ncategories like property or object essentially.) At\nthe same time, extreme haecceitism is typically paired with a\ncommitment to the necessity of identity and distinctness and therefore\nrules out possibilities according to which actually distinct objects\nare one and the same. A yet more permissive view about de re\nmodality might abandon this commitment, taking even the identity and\ndistinctness of individuals as accidental. (On whether\nanti-essentialism is best paired with the necessity of identity and\ndistinctness, see Nelson (2006).) Finally, while essentialism holds certain properties\nas necessary for being a specific individual, related\n“sufficiency” theses might hold certain properties to\nbe sufficient for being a particular individual. If, for\nexample, we take Obama’s actual qualitative role to be a\nsufficient condition for an object to be identical to Obama, we\nthereby rule out possibilities according to which some other\nindividual occupies Obama’s qualitative role. (Sufficiency\ntheses of this sort can be hammered into essentialist theses by\nholding individuals like Obama to have essential properties\nlike occupying the qualitative role of the President in 2014 if\nthe world is qualitatively as it actually is.) Theses of this\nkind play a notable role in certain essentialist arguments—e.g.,\nin certain arguments for origin essentialism—but it remains\nunclear how such principles might be used to offer a\nnon-question-begging argument against haecceitism. (For discussion of\nsufficiency principles, see McKay (1986) and Robertson (1998).) As just noted, no familiar version of essentialism provides a\ndirect argument against absolutely all haecceitistic differences,\nalthough strong versions of essentialism will limit the range of\nadmissible haecceitistic differences. In addition, haecceitists\ntypically assume at least a modest form of essentialism insofar as\nindividuals are taken to have their haecceities essentially. This section surveys arguments for haecceitism. The most familiar\nof these are conceivability arguments, which appeal to the apparent\nconceivability or imaginability of maximal possibilities that differ\nhaecceitistically. Another line of defense takes the form of an\nargument usually called “Chisholm’s Paradox”, which\nexploits incremental modal variations in order to defend haecceitistic\ndifferences. In addition, one might endorse haecceitism, not on the\nstrength of any distinctive argument, but by a more general appeal to\nmodal intuition, according to which haecceitistic differences\nsimply seem possible. This survey of arguments leaves aside\nthe general issues in modal epistemology raised by appeals to modal\nintuition, focusing instead on conceivability arguments for\nhaecceitism and Chisholm’s Paradox. Note, also, that these arguments are most naturally taken as\narguments for Possibility Haecceitism rather than, say, World\nHaecceitism. So understood, the Lewisian “cheap\nhaecceitist” can, in principle, accept the conclusions of these\narguments even while denying such arguments establish the existence of\nqualitatively indiscernible possible worlds. Conceivability arguments for haecceitism have two steps. The first\nstep requires our success in conceiving or imagining certain states of\naffairs. The second step requires an inference from the relevant\nconceiving or imagining to the possibility of the states of affairs in\nquestion. Among the wide variety of conceivability arguments for\nhaecceitism, some vary with respect to the kind of conceivability or\nimagination required, while others vary with respect to the kinds of\nstates of affairs involved. This section sets out some conceivability\narguments offered in the literature with some limited remarks about\ntheir salient differences. Black (1952) offers a now-famous conceivability argument against\nthe Identity of Indiscernibles, which appeals to the apparent\nconceivability of a world containing only two indiscernible iron\nspheres. In defending haecceitism, a natural strategy is to extend\nBlack’s case by arguing that, not only can we conceive of a\nworld containing only two indiscernible iron spheres, we can conceive\nof distinct worlds that differ only insofar as these spheres swap\ntheir spatial locations. (Jubien (1993: 41–42) discusses an\nargument of this sort.) A closely related argument holds that we can\nconceive of a pair of worlds in which some pair of spheres has been\nreplaced by some other pair of spheres. Granted the conceivability of\nthe states of affairs in question, haecceitism follows. (A related\nline of argument, owing to Adams (1979), is considered below.) Other arguments appeal to similar states of affairs featuring\nqualitatively indiscernible objects or regions. For example, Melia\n(2003: 162) presents a conceivability argument that requires us to\nconceive of a world that contains a single cylinder on a qualitatively\nhomogeneous plane. Intuitively, there are many possible directions in\nwhich the cylinder could fall, but, since there is no qualitative\nvariation between these possibilities, they can be distinguished only\nhaecceitistically—i.e., with respect to the identity of which\nregions of the plane are occupied by the fallen cylinder. Unlike the preceding arguments, some conceivability arguments\ninvolve a kind of “inside” or “first-personal”\nimagination that requires imagining a state of affairs from the\nperspective of a specific conscious individual. Compare, for example,\nthe act of imagining Napoleon defeated at Waterloo “from\nabove” with the act of imagining being Napoleon\ndefeated at Waterloo from the perspective of Napoleon. The distinction\nbetween these imaginative acts is commonly taken as a distinction\nbetween imagining from the outside and imagining from the inside. If\nwe help ourselves to this distinction, it is plausible to view several\nconceivability arguments as relying upon imagination from the inside\nrather than imagination from the outside. (On the distinction between\ninside and outside imagination, see Nichols (2008), Ninan (2009),\nPeacocke (1985), and Velleman (1996).) Lewis (1986: 227) offers an argument of this sort, which we can\ntake to involve our imagining a world of one-way eternal recurrence\nwhere the history of the actual world repeats itself ad\ninfinitum. Lewis then suggests that we can successfully imagine\nourselves occupying different “epochs”—specific\nrecurrences of history from the inside. And, since we can imagine\nourselves occupying different epochs, he concludes that some\npossibilities differ solely with respect to whether one lives in, say,\nthe seventeenth rather than the fortieth epoch. In addition, Lewis\n(1983, 1986: 239) suggests another conceivability argument that is\nplausibly taken to require us imagining living the life of one of a\npair of twins. (Whether Lewis thinks any robust imaginative\nundertaking is required here is unclear, but the general features of\nthis particular kind of conceivability argument is our interest here.)\nAnd, since we can equally well imagine living the life of the\nfirstborn twin and that of the second-born twin, while holding the\nqualitative character of the world fixed, it seems that we can\nsuccessfully imagine possibilities that differ only\nhaecceitistically. Another kind of conceivability argument, like the Double case\noffered above, requires us to imagine our nonexistence in a world\nqualitatively indiscernible from actuality. Different views of\nimagination will deliver importantly different verdicts about how, if\nat all, we might succeed in this imaginative undertaking. (It is hard,\nfor example, to see how we might successfully imagine our own\nnonexistence from the inside.) But, among others, Bricker (2007: 130)\nsuggests that a plausible view of de re modality must\naccommodate the possibility of oneself failing to exist even while\nthings are qualitatively just as they actually are. (On\nBricker’s view, this requires only a sufficiently rich account\nof counterpart relations rather than, say, qualitatively indiscernible\npossible worlds. On imagining one’s own nonexistence, see\nNichols (2007).) A final conceivability argument usefully illustrates the intuitive\ndifference between arguments that rely solely upon outside imagination\nand those invoking inside imagination. Adams (1979: 22) presents the\nfollowing conceivability argument: Adams explicitly marks the move from outside to inside imagination,\nnoting that the haecceitistic difference “becomes vividly\nclear” when we imagine the relevant states of affairs from the\nperspective of the individuals involved. (See Melia (1999: 650) for a\nsimilar argument.) If we take \\(Q\\) to be a purely qualitative description of the\nrelevant states of affairs, we can present a more formal rendering of\nAdams’ conceivability argument: In addressing these and other conceivability arguments for\nhaecceitism, anti-haecceitists have two primary lines of\ndefense. According to the first kind of response, the evidential\nconnection between conceivability and possibility is\nrejected—e.g., by denying that conceivability of the relevant\nstate of affairs is grounds for taking the state of affairs in\nquestion to be possible. Responses of this sort reject premises like\nP3 or P4 and, in doing so, take sides on a key issue in modal\nepistemology. According to a second line of response, the apparent conceivability\nof the relevant states of affairs is merely apparent. To this end, the\nanti-haecceitist denies that individuals successfully conceive of or\nimagine the states of affairs required to establish\nhaecceitism. Responses of this sort hold agents to be mistaken about\nthe content of their imaginings and, as a consequence, mistaken in\nbelieving themselves to conceive of states of affairs that differ\nhaecceitistically. Responses of this sort reject premises P1 or P2 or\ntheir analogues. Chisholm’s Paradox, presented in Chisholm (1967), begins\ninnocuously enough. Suppose that individuals are identical across\npossible worlds such that de re modal claims like “Fred\ncould have been taller” are true only in case there is some\npossible world where the very same individual, in this case, Fred, is\ntaller than he is in the actual world. Now, consider that two actual\nindividuals, Adam and Noah, could have had slightly different\nqualitative properties. For example, Adam, instead of dying at age\n930, could have died at age 931. Similarly, Noah, instead of dying at\nage 950, could have died at age 949. If Adam and Noah can tolerate\nthese incremental “changes” to each of their qualitative\nprofiles, it seems that had they been a different way than they\nactually are, they could have tolerated even further incremental\nchanges. Now, if we allow incremental possible changes to the ways that Adam\nand Noah could have been and accept the transitivity of identity, we\nare committed to a finite series of incremental changes that ends in a\npossible world where Adam has all the qualitative properties Noah\nactually has and Noah has all the qualitative properties that Adam\nactually has. This is because the relevant iterated modal claim\n“Adam could have been such that he could have been such that he\ncould have been such” is, by our initial assumption, true in\nvirtue of one and the same individual, Adam, existing at different\npossible worlds. So, if Adam and Noah could be incrementally different\nand the individuals they could have been could also be incrementally\ndifferent, we must accept that Adam and Noah could “swap”\ntheir respective qualitative properties. And, if so, there is a\nmaximal possibility that differs from actuality only in haecceitistic\nterms—that is, it differs only in terms of which individuals\ninstantiate which qualitative profiles. We can clarify Chisholm’s Paradox as a particular schema of\nmodal inference. This schema involves a two-place predicate that\nrelates an individual and either their actual qualitative properties\n(represented as \\(p_{1})\\) or their possible qualitative properties\n(represented as successors up to \\(p_{n})\\), where differences between\n\\(p_{X}\\) and \\(p_{X+1}\\) are small increments of qualitative\nproperties. In this way, Chisholm’s Paradox purports to\nestablish that a particular individual might have had different\nqualitative properties and, through iteration and the transitivity of\nidentity, that it might have had precisely the qualitative properties\nsome other individual actually has. Following Salmon (1986) and Forbes\n(1984), we can present Chisholm’s Paradox as follows: In the version presented in Chisholm (1967), \\(M\\) is the\nrelation instantiates each member of; \\(a\\) is the individual\nAdam; \\(p_{1}\\) is the set of Adam’s actual qualitative\nproperties; \\(p_{n}\\) is the set of Noah’s actual qualitative\nproperties. Chisholm’s Paradox therefore involves If Chisholm’s Paradox is sound, the conclusion that Adam\ncould occupy Noah’s qualitative role entails haecceitism. This\nis because Noah’s qualitative properties include, not only\nNoah’s intrinsic properties, but also Noah’s extrinsic\nproperties (e.g., being such that there are seven\ncontinents), which suffice to fix the qualitative character of\nthe world. As result, if Adam could instantiate Noah’s actual\nqualitative properties, then the world in which he does so must be\nqualitatively just like the actual world. Such a possibility therefore\nentails that some maximal possibilities differ haecceitistically. If successful, Chisholm’s Paradox seems to establish not only\nhaecceitism, but also an extreme form of\n“anti-essentialism” like extreme haecceitism. Since we can\nconstruct a “Chisholm-sequence” with any two individuals,\nunqualified endorsement of Chisholm’s Paradox guarantees that,\nfor any individuals, there is a possible world where those individuals\nswap their qualitative profiles. For instance, there would be a\npossible world where Obama occupies the qualitative profile of the\nEiffel Tower and vice versa. As a result, neither the Eiffel\nTower nor Obama can have any distinctive qualitative properties\nessentially. While some have taken haecceitism and this anti-essentialism (or\n“minimal essentialism”) to be a natural package, it is\nimportant to note that they are separate conclusions. One might reject\ncertain instances of Chisholm’s Paradox that require teacups to\nswap qualitative roles with tornadoes, but admit that other instances\nsucceed in showing that distinct teacups might have swapped\nqualitative roles. Despite this, responses to Chisholm’s Paradox\nare typically motivated by efforts to sustain a commitment to\nessentialism rather than avoid commitment to haecceitism. To this end,\nsome follow Salmon (1986) in holding the assumption of an\n\\(\\mathbf{S5}\\) modal logic that validates \\(\\Diamond P\\rightarrow\n\\Box \\Diamond P\\) as the underlying culprit. (Salmon (1989, 1993)\nrejects, not only \\(\\mathbf{S5}\\), but \\(\\mathbf{S4}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\) axioms.) Such responses opt for a weaker logic that\navoids (at least) the transitivity of the accessibility relation\nbetween possible worlds. Other responses turn on the finer points\nof de re representation. For example, while Lewis’\ncounterpart theory can, in non-standard contexts, accommodate\nanti-essentialism, the fact that our ordinary contextual standards\nrule out extreme de re possibilities is explained by the\nintransitivity of the counterpart relation between\nindividuals. Another potential response to Chisholm’s Paradox\nwould be akin to those offered in dealing with\nthe sorites—e.g., holding that some premises of\nChisholm’s Paradox are false even while we are in no position to\nspecify precisely which ones. Yet another line of response takes\nChisholm’s Paradox to deliver the correct verdict: there are no\ninteresting qualitative essential properties of individuals. For\nexample, some like Mackie (2006) take Chisholm’s Paradox to lend\nsupport to a minimal essentialist view, according to which any object\nmight occupy any given qualitative role, provided it retains its\nnon-qualitative haecceity. This section surveys arguments for anti-haecceitism. It is worth\nnoting, however, that for many anti-haecceitists, the denial that any\nmaximal possibilities differ haecceitistically issues from a broader\ncommitment regarding ontology or modality. (Anti-haecceitists include\nDasgupta (2009), Forbes (1985), and Robinson (1989: 400).) Consider,\nfor example, generalism, according to which there are no\nindividuals. Instead, the world is exhaustively general, comprising\nfacts about the distribution of qualitative properties without any\nfacts about individuals. Since haecceitism presupposes that there are\nmaximal possibilities that differ solely regarding the identity of\nindividuals, generalism thereby rules out haecceitism. (On generalism,\nsee Dasgupta (2009) and Turner (forthcoming).) Similarly,\nnecessitarians hold that there are no non-actual maximal\npossibilities. Consequently, all truths are necessarily true, so there\nis only one way things could have been. And, since haecceitism\nrequires that there are distinct maximal possibilities,\nnecessitarianism rules out haecceitism. Other broad metaphysical\ncommitments have also been claimed to support\nanti-haecceitism. (Armstrong (1989: 57–61) claims that\nanti-haecceitism best squares with his antecedent naturalist and\ncombinatorialist commitments.) And, just as modal intuition is\ncommonly taken as the grounds for endorsing haecceitism, modal\nintuition is very often taken as grounds for endorsing\nanti-haecceitism. For example, while Hofweber (2005: 27) is officially\nneutral on haecceitism, he nicely summarizes the standard\nanti-haecceitist appeal to modal intuition: Anti-haecceitists who appeal to modal intuitions in this way owe\nsome response to the arguments set out in the previous\nsection. Moreover, since modal intuitions of haecceitists and\nanti-haecceitists are at direct odds, assessing the evidential weight\nand proper assessment of these intuitions points towards deep\nmethodological waters. But, rather than taking up these issues, it\nwill be useful to focus on two direct lines of arguments for\nanti-haecceitism. One important argument against haecceitism turns on issues about\nthe grounding of identity facts—i.e., facts about the identity\nof individuals. Set out in Forbes (1985: 128), this argument holds\nhaecceitism to require what we can call bare identity facts,\nwhere such facts concern the identity of individuals but are not\ngrounded in the qualitative features of the world. Since these\nidentity facts can vary without any difference in qualitative\ncharacter, they are alleged to resist metaphysical explanation. On\nthis front, Forbes remarks as follows: On one construal of Forbes’ argument, haecceitistic\ndifferences are unintelligible and therefore objectionable because all\nidentity facts must be grounded in facts about the qualitative\ncharacter of the world. Accordingly, Forbes’ argument requires a\ncommitment to the sufficiency of qualitative facts to account for all\nfacts about the identity of individuals. Such a commitment rules out\nhaecceitistic differences, but raises questions about the tenability\nof the relevant constraint on identity facts. What, if anything, can\nbe taken to ground the facts about the identity of qualitative\nproperties? And, if there are at least some ungrounded identity facts,\nwhat precisely makes bare identity facts objectionable? (On\nForbes’ argument, see Bricker (1988), Yablo (1988), and Mackie\n(2007).) And, while the denial of bare identities is not strictly\nequivalent to the denial of haecceitism, it is plainly a very small\nstep from the former to the latter. Accordingly, some commentators\nhave raised concerns that an argument for anti-haecceitism from the\ndenial of bare identities is tantamount to begging the question. More\ngenerally, if one accepts the ban on bare identity facts, the\nchallenge arises of explaining how all identity facts might be\ngrounded in qualitative facts without doing violence to our modal\nintuitions. The Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles (hereafter, PII)\nholds that, if any objects share all the same properties, these\nobjects are identical. To avoid triviality, PII is typically\ninterpreted with the domain of properties restricted to what are\nusually taken to be qualitative properties. (On PII, see\nRodriguez-Pererya (2010), Hawley (2009) and Della Rocca (2005).) Since haecceitistic differences concern qualitatively indiscernible\npossibilities, it is tempting to think that, since PII rules out the\nexistence of qualitatively indiscernible objects, it thereby\nundermines haecceitism. Assessing this line of argument raises issues\nabout the proper formulation of PII as well as radically different\nviews about the nature of possible worlds. To see how these issues\nhang together, it is useful to first consider how PII might be used to\nargue against haecceitism within the context of Lewisian Modal\nRealism. In doing so, two versions of PII need to be\ndistinguished. According to the first version regarding objects within a given\nworld, PII-Objects, there are no qualitatively indiscernible\nobjects within a single possible world. PII-Objects therefore rules\nout states of affairs like those suggested in Black (1952) involving\nqualitatively indiscernible iron spheres. Although PII-Objects ensures\nthat no object has a qualitatively indiscernible worldmate, it is\nneutral on whether or not there are qualitatively indiscernible\nworlds, leaving open whether there are distinct yet qualitatively\nindiscernible worlds. A second version of PII, PII-Worlds, concerns possible\nworlds themselves rather than the individuals within them. It holds\nthat there are no distinct yet qualitatively indiscernible worlds, but\nit is neutral on whether there are qualitatively indiscernible\nindividuals within a single world. PII-Worlds therefore leaves open\nwhether there are worlds like Blacks’ two sphere scenario in\nwhich there are distinct qualitatively indiscernible objects. Having now distinguished these principles, we can consider whether\neither provides an argument against haecceitism. As Lewis (1986: 224)\nnotes, PII-Objects leaves haecceitism untouched, since it is\ncompatible with the possibility of qualitatively indiscernible worlds\nthat differ haecceitistically. And, while PII-Worlds rules out\nqualitatively indiscernible worlds rather than objects within worlds,\nLewis’ cheap haecceitism still permits the representation of\nmaximal possibilities that differ haecceitistically even without\npositing qualitatively indiscernible worlds. It looks, then, like PII\nis not a plausible starting point for a case against Possibility\nHaecceitism within Lewisian Modal Realism. Does an argument against haecceitism on the basis of PII fare any\nbetter within an ersatz view of possible worlds? It’s tough to\nsay. As noted in Section One, different versions of ersatzism deliver\ndifferent verdicts about whether possible worlds are qualitatively\nindiscernible from one another. For example, if one holds that all\npropositions are qualitatively indiscernible, an unrestricted\napplication of PII will cause broad problems for such a\nview—e.g., by ruling out the existence of more than a single\npossible world. On other ersatzist views, according to which possible\nworlds have distinctive qualitative characters even while they\nrepresent maximal possibilities that differ haecceitistically, PII\nwill not rule out a commitment to haecceitism. In light of these\nconsequences, PII would need to be applied, not to the possible worlds\nof the ersatzist, but, rather, to the possibilities they\nrepresent. And, of course, if the ersatzist denies that there are\nmaximal possibilities that differ without differing qualitatively,\nthey reject haecceitism. But, since the relevant principle used to\nundercut haecceitism is not, strictly speaking, PII regarding objects\nor worlds but instead possibilities, it is unclear whether it merely\ncollapses into the straightforward denial of haecceitism. A worry,\nthen, is that the version of PII that suffices to undercut haecceitism\nis so close to the thesis of anti-haecceitism that any argument that\nproceeds from such a principle merely begs the question. In addition,\nit is unclear if such a principle can be plausibly motivated without\nleading to objectionable modal commitments by requiring one to reject\nthe kinds of possibilities that Black (1952) notes. (On the case for\nBlack-style possibilities involving qualitatively indiscernible\nobjects, see Adams (1979: 17–19).) The preceding arguments aim to show that there are no haecceitistic\ndifferences of any kind between maximal possibilities. Other arguments\nare narrower in scope and aim to establish a weaker thesis: that\ncertain kinds of haecceitistic differences are spurious. If\nsuccessful, these arguments will rule out only some kinds of\nhaecceitistic differences while falling short of providing a perfectly\ngeneral case against haecceitism. To get a sense of restricted or\ndomain-specific (anti-)haecceitisms, it will be useful to focus on one\nexample where restricted, domain-specific theses of haecceitism or\nanti-haecceitism play a notable role in a core metaphysical\ndebate. Consider the kind of possibility exploited in a rough approximation\nof Leibniz’s shift argument against absolute space: If absolute\nspace exists, then there is a non-actual possibility, according to\nwhich all actual objects are uniformly shifted five feet from their\nactual spatial positions. Such a possibility—let us\nsuppose—differs only haecceitistically from actuality. (For more\non haecceitism and spacetime, see Section 7 and the references\ntherein. On Leibnizian shift arguments, see Russell (2014).) In considering this alleged possibility, a range of responses are\navailable: For those who believe realism about space requires\naccepting such possibilities, but find such possibilities incredible,\nthe denial of absolute space is an available response. For other\nrealists about absolute space unbothered by haecceitistic differences,\nthe possibility in question poses no challenge. Still others might\nretain realism about absolute space yet deny this apparent possibility\nis a genuine one. The most natural strategy here is to claim that\ncertain kinds of haecceitistic differences—specifically, those\nthat involve merely a shift in spatial position—do not\ncorrespond to genuinely distinct possibilities. Importantly, this\nthird strategy does not rule out haecceitistic differences per\nse, but requires at least a domain-specific anti-haecceitism,\naccording to which there are no haecceitistic differences regarding\nregions of absolute space. In response to arguments that broach the question of haecceitism in\na limited domain, useful debate requires us to distinguish the scope\nof different versions of haecceitism and the distinctive motivations\nof domain-specific (anti-)haecceitisms. Naturally, one might accept\ncertain kinds of haecceitistic differences while rejecting\nothers. Moreover, almost any haecceitist will reject at least some\nputative haecceitistic differences. For example, while one might\naccept possibilities according to which two twins swap qualitative\nroles, one might deny that you and Obama could swap their respective\nroles. In addition, even those who accept these haecceitistic\ndifferences regarding humans will likely deny that you might have\nswapped qualitative roles with your singleton set or some other\nmathematical entity. The question that arises for those unswayed by\nblanket arguments against haecceitism is to determine which putative\nhaecceitistic differences between possibilities are to be admitted. It\nis, however, no small matter to adequately characterize the scope of\nhaecceitistic differences one admits. For, while a ban on\nhaecceitistic differences regarding certain ontological categories\n(e.g., spatial regions) is easy enough to state, nuanced views that\naccept only certain kinds of haecceitistic differences concerning\nmaterial objects are challenging to plausibly or definitively\nformulate. In this way, characterizing this or that view as committed\nto haecceitism simpliciter can prove unhelpful without a\nspecification of the precise haecceitistic differences admitted. Haecceitism has consequences for a range of issues in metaphysics\nand the philosophy of language. This section provides a brief overview\nof some of the ways in which haecceitism proves most significant. Quidditism is the property-theoretic analogue of\nhaecceitism. (Armstrong (1989: 59) seems to coin the term\n‘quidditism.’) But, while distinctively haecceitistic\npossibilities involve individuals being “swapped” or\n“replaced” without any qualitative difference,\ndistinctively quidditistic possibilities involve properties swapping\nor replacing one another in the world’s causal-nomic\nstructure. If, for example, there is a maximal possibility, otherwise\nindiscernible from actuality, where mass and charge\nswap their respective causal-nomic roles (e.g., where objects resist\nacceleration in virtue of their charge), this maximal possibility\nwould differ quidditistically from actuality. Similarly, if there is a\nmaximal possibility according to which all actual causal-nomic facts\nare the same except that some actually uninstantiated\nproperty, schmass, occupies the causal and nomic role\nof mass, this maximal possibility would also differ\nquidditistically from actuality. (Typically, quidditism is taken as a\nthesis about fundamental or “sparse” properties\nlike mass and charge rather than as a thesis about\nall properties whatsoever.) Like haecceitism, quidditism’s proper formulation is\ncontentious and depends heavily upon background metaphysical\nassumptions. Some formulations of quidditism invoke either maximal\npossibilities or possible worlds, while modalist formulations of\nquidditism do without either resource. Additionally, there is a\nquidditistic analogue of cheap haecceitism, according to which a given\npossible world represents various maximal possibilities that differ\nonly quidditistically. (On formulations of quidditism and property\ncounterpart theory, see Hawthorne (2002b) and Heller (2002,\n2005).) Arguments for quidditism have notable parallels with arguments for\nhaecceitism. Some quidditists suggest that our pedestrian modal\njudgments support quidditism (see, e.g., Lewis (2009: 209), while\nother defenses of quidditism can appeal to the apparent conceivability\nof scenarios where properties swap their causal-nomic\nroles. Additionally, Bird (2007: 74–76) considers but rejects a\nproperty-theoretic analogue of Chisholm’s Paradox that, if\nsuccessful, establishes quidditism. A different line of argument,\nwhich has no direct analogue in the case of haecceitism, appeals to\ncombinatorial principles regarding the nature of modality. These\ncombinatorial principles hold that various permutations of fundamental\nproperties across, say, causal nomic roles, correspond to distinct\nmaximal possibilities, which, if genuine, would differ only\nquidditistically. (See Lewis (2009: 209) for the combinatorial\nargument and Locke (2010) and Schaffer (2005: 10) for discussion.) Arguments against quidditism also appeal to modal intuitions. Black\n(2000: 94) says, for example, that quidditistic differences are\n“distinctions which my intuitions tell me are distinctions\nwithout differences… My intuition is that to play the\nnomological role of some colour or flavour is to be that colour or\nflavour, at that the idea of two qualities swapping nomological roles\nis thus unintelligible.” Other anti-quidditist arguments turn on\nits purported epistemological consequences. On this front, some\nanti-quidditists (as well as some quidditists) hold that quidditism\nentails that we are irremediably ignorant of the distribution of the\nworld’s fundamental properties. (Lewis (2009) labels the\nresulting view, “Ramseyan Humility.” On quidditism and\nhumility, see also Bird (2007: 79), Hawthorne (2002b), Locke (2009),\nSchaffer (2005), Shoemaker (1980), and Whittle (2006).) Additional\ncomplaints and concerns about quidditism are diverse in\ncharacter. Locke (2012) discusses Ockhamist worries about the ontology\nof quidditism and, specifically, second-order quiddities. Whittle\n(2006) worries about the epiphenomenal intrinsic nature of properties,\ngiven quidditism’s alleged modal consequences. Black (2000)\noffers a cardinality argument against quidditism, which holds its\nmodal commitments to demand the existence of proper class-many\npossible worlds. Hawthorne (2002b) considers whether quidditism might\nultimately require a kind of “hyperstructuralism”,\naccording to which absolutely any property might swap roles with any\nother property including the relation of causal necessitation\nitself. The resulting bizarre possibilities—e.g.,\nwhere mass and causal necessitation swap\nroles—would deliver a reductio of quidditism should\nthey prove unavoidable. Although haecceitism and quidditism are independent theses, since\nneither strictly entails the other, their evidential relationship is\nan interesting one. Given the parallels between the arguments for and\nagainst them, it is unclear whether haecceitists ought to be\nquidditists and vice versa or if the metaphysical\ndisanalogies between properties and individuals justifying endorsing\none but not the other. (On the analogies and disanalogies between\nhaecceitism and quidditism, see Schaffer (2005: 15–16).) Debates about personal identity relate to haecceitism in diverse\nand complex ways. Perhaps most notably, some arguments for the\n“Simple View” of personal identity (alternatively, the\n“Further Fact view”), according to which facts about the\nidentity of persons over time are irreducible and non-qualitative, are\nplausibly taken as arguments for haecceitism. (On anti-reductionism\nand the Simple View, see Parfit (1984: 210) and Olson (2012).) These\narguments exploit so-called “fission cases”, which involve\nan individual that apparently splits into distinct individuals but\nwithout principled grounds for identifying one rather than another of\nthe post-fission individuals with the pre-fission\nindividual. According to some proponents of the Simple View, it seems\npossible that that the pre-fission individual be identical to one of\nthe post-fission individuals while, in other physically and\npsychologically indiscernible worlds, the pre-fission individual is\nidentical to an apparently different post-fission individual. If,\nhowever, these are each genuine possibilities, facts about the\nidentity of persons over time do not supervene upon any physical or\npsychological facts. And, since these are the qualitative facts\ntypically held to be relevant to personal identity over time, such\ncases suggest that facts about personal identity over time do not\nsupervene upon qualitative features. In this way, the Simple View\nlends support to the more general thesis that non-qualitative facts\nabout the identity of persons do not supervene upon qualitative\nfacts. In addition to its connection to the Simple View, a broader\nmethodological connection unites haecceitism and inquiries into\npersonal identity: a focus on the qualitative/non-qualitative\ndistinction. In debates about personal identity, appeal to exclusively\nqualitative properties and relations (e.g., having such-and-such\npsychological features) rather than non-qualitative properties\nand relations (e.g., having Bob’s memories) is commonly\ntaken as a constraint on a genuinely reductive analysis of personal\nidentity over time. So, just as haecceitism requires clarifying the\nnature of this metaphysical distinction, criteria for distinguishing\nthe reductive and non-reductive approaches to personal identity also\nrely heavily on the idea that certain properties are uniquely tied to\nthe identity of individuals. On the connection between haecceitism,\nthe Simple View, and (anti-)reductionist approaches to personal\nidentity, see Ninan (2009). The connection between haecceitism and physicalism is\ncontroversial. If we understand physicalism as the unqualified thesis\nthat physical properties like mass and charge\nexhaustively fix all other properties, haecceitistic differences\npresent a prima facie challenge. For, if some worlds differ\nhaecceitistically but are alike with respect to the distribution of\nphysical properties, then, contrary to physicalism, possible worlds or\nmaximal possibilities can be physically indiscernible yet fail to be\nindiscernible simpliciter. Moreover, some follow Hofweber\n(2005) in taking the irreducibility of haecceities and other\nnon-qualitative properties to physical properties to constitute a\nchallenge to more sophisticated conceptions of physicalism. (See Daly\nand Liggins (2012) and Almotahari and Rochford (2012) on\nHofweber’s argument. See Ninan (2009: 433) on haecceitism and\nits relation to physicalism.) A different assessment denies that haecceitism and physicalism are\nin tension with one another by taking the scope of physicalism to be\nrestricted to qualitative properties. So understood, haecceitism has\nno significance for the fate of physicalism, since haecceitistic\ndifferences are purely non-qualitative in character. For those who\ncharacterize physicalism as the thesis that worlds that are physical\nduplicates of one another are duplicates simpliciter, this\nresponse is especially plausible, since talk of\n“duplication” is typically restricted to qualitative\nproperties. (See Stoljar (2010: 136) on the options for formulating\nphysicalism.) Given the complex interaction between haecceitism and physicalism,\na natural strategy for circumventing this issue simply sets aside the\nquestion of haecceitism in investigating the status of\nphysicalism. For example, in characterizing physicalism, Chalmers\n(1996: 367) says: “I will always be considering worlds\n‘qualitatively’, and abstracting away from question of\n‘haecceity.’ That is, I will count two worlds that are\nqualitatively identical as identical and will not be concerned with\nquestions about whether individuals in those worlds might have\ndifferent ‘identities.’” The merits of bracketing\nthe uncertain compatibility of haecceitism and physicalism are\nsignificant, but, for views that do hold them to be incompatible, no\nsuch strategy will ultimately prove plausible. The Hole Argument against substantivalism purports to show that,\ngiven some auxiliary assumptions, substantivalism illicitly requires\nthe truth of indeterminism. (See Norton’s entry on the Hole\nArgument.) Defenders of the Hole Argument take this commitment to\nindeterminism to be a consequence of accepting certain models of\ngeneral relativity as genuinely distinct possibilities for\nsubstantival spacetime. The possible models in question are typically\nheld to differ only haecceitistically, so, for substantivalists,\nanti-haecceitism provides a route for rejecting the possibilities that\nare alleged to require indeterminism. For committed haecceitists who\nendorse substantivalism, some alternative strategy is required. One\navailable option is to revise the relevant conception of determinism\nby taking it as a thesis about qualitatively discernible possibilities\nrather than possibilities in general. On the resulting revision,\nindeterminism requires the availability of qualitatively discernible\npossibilities. As a consequence, admitting possibilities that differ\nonly haecceitistically would have no implications for the status of\ndeterminism. Careful attention to the status and scope of haecceitism\ntherefore proves crucial for assessing this leading argument against\nsubstantivalism. In addition to Norton’s entry on the Hole Argument, see\nPooley (2006) for a defense of anti-haecceitism. See Dasgupta (MS) and\nRussell (2013b) on anti-haecceitism about spacetime, and Brighouse\n(1994, 1997) and Melia (2009) on haecceitism and determinism. Haecceitism informs several issues in the philosophy of language\nprimarily through its conventional connection to realism about\nhaecceities. Since haecceities uniquely correspond to individuals,\nrealists about haecceities have a distinctive metaphysical resource\nfor the development of semantic theories. In addition, for realists\nabout haecceities who believe that all properties exist necessarily,\nhaecceities of nonexistent individuals provide an especially natural\nmetaphysical surrogate when explaining the possibility of true and\nmeaningful claims about the individuals in question. So, for example,\nif one holds that singular terms like ‘Obama’ contribute\nthe haecceity being Obama to the singular proposition expressed by\nsentences that include ‘Obama’, one can make sense of the\ntruth and meaningfulness of claims regarding Obama in worlds in which\nObama does not exist. (On this strategy, see Plantinga (1978: 132).)\nThe general strategy of using haecceities as metaphysical surrogates\nfor individuals has surfaced in debates about the philosophy of time,\nwhere, e.g., Markosian (2004: 54–56), considers appropriating\nhaecceities of non-present individuals to address objections to\npresentism. Some appeals to haecceities in the philosophy of language are more\nlimited and nuanced—e.g., Hawthorne and Manley (2012: 204)\nconsider the deployment of haecceities and other non-qualitative\nproperties in a semantics for demonstratives—while other\napplications are more general in scope—e.g., analyses of de\nre senses or individual concepts in terms of haecceities.
