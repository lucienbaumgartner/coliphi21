This is true despite the fact that many earlier Greek\nnatural philosophers occasionally speculated on the origins of living\nthings and much of the Hippocratic medical corpus, which was written\nbefore or during Aristotle’s lifetime, displays a serious\ninterest in human anatomy, physiology and pathology. Even Plato has\nTimaeus devote a considerable part of his speech to the human body and\nits functions (and malfunctions). Nevertheless, before Aristotle, only\na few of the Hippocratic treatises are both systematic and empirical,\nand their focus is almost exclusively on human health and disease.\n\n\nBy contrast, Aristotle considered the investigation of living things,\nand especially animals, central to the theoretical study of nature.\nConstituting roughly 25% of the extant corpus, his zoological writings\nprovide a theoretical defense of the proper method for\nbiological investigation; and they provide a record of the first\nsystematic and comprehensive study of animals. There was nothing of\nsimilar scope and sophistication again until the 16th\ncentury. In the nineteenth century the great anatomist Richard Owen\nintroduced a two lecture survey of Aristotle’s zoological\nstudies by declaring that “Zoological Science sprang from his\n[Aristotle’s] labours, we may almost say, like Minerva from the\nHead of Jove, in a state of noble and splendid maturity” (Owen\n1992, 91). Before examining this remarkable achievement, a few words\nabout its creator are in\n order.[1].\n \nAristotle was born in Stagira on the northern Aegean coast in 384BCE.\nHis father Nicomachus was physician to King Amyntas III of Macedon,\nand his mother was of a wealthy family from the island of Euboea. He\nwas sent at the age of 17 to Athens, where he studied in Plato’s\nAcademy for 20 years, until Plato’s death in 347. By then he had\ndeveloped his own distinctive philosophical ideas, including his\npassion for the study of nature. He joined a philosophical circle in\nAssos on the coast of Asia Minor, but soon moved to the nearby island\nof Lesbos where he met Theophrastus, a young man with similar\ninterests in natural science. Between the two of them they originated\nthe science of biology, Aristotle carrying out a systematic\ninvestigation of animals, Theophrastus doing the same for plants. \nIn 343 Aristotle was asked by Philip II of Macedon to tutor his son\nAlexander. By 335 he had returned to Athens, now under the control of\nhis former student Alexander. With Theophrastus he founded a\n‘school’ in a public sanctuary known as the Lyceum. He\nheaded the Lyceum until the death of Alexander the Great in 323. With\nanti-Macedonian feelings running high in Athens, Aristotle retired to\nhis mother’s birthplace. He died there in 322BCE. \nThe surviving corpus of Aristotle derives from medieval manuscripts\nbased on a 1st century BCE edition. There were no\ncommentaries on the biological works written until they were\ncollectively translated into Arabic. The first appearance of\nAristotle’s biological writings in the West are Latin\ntranslations of an Arabic edition by Michael Scot, which forms the\nbasis of Albertus Magnus’ De animalibus. In the\n13th century William of Moerbeke produced a Latin\ntranslation directly from the Greek. The first printed editions and\ntranslations date to the late 15th century, the most widely\ncirculated being that of Theodorus Gaza. In addition to the three\nworks traditionally referred to as History of Animals\n(HA), Parts of Animals (PA) and\nGeneration of Animals (GA), there are a number of\nbriefer ‘essays’ on more specialized topics: On animal\nmotion, On animal locomotion, On respiration,\nOn life and death, On youth and old age, On\nlength and shortness of life, On sleeping and waking,\nOn the senses and their objects (the last six being included\nin the so-called Parva naturalia). Whether one should\nconsider De Anima (On the soul) part of this project\nor not is a difficult question. What is certainly clear, however, is\nthat there are important connections between the theoretical approach\nto the relationship between body and soul defended in that work and\nthe distinctive way that Aristotle approaches the investigation of\nanimals. \nIn order to understand Aristotle’s distinctive approach to the\nstudy of living things, it is imperative to situate it within his\nnatural philosophy and his philosophy of science. The first book of\nAristotle’s Parts of Animals is, in fact, largely\ndevoted to doing just that, and after a brief discussion of\nAristotle’s general views about scientific inquiry and\nexplanation, we will turn to it. \nAristotle was able to accomplish what he did in biology because he had\ngiven a great deal of thought to the nature of scientific inquiry. How\ndoes one progress from the superficial and unorganized state of\neveryday experience toward organized scientific understanding? To\nanswer this question, you need a concept of the goal to be achieved,\nand Aristotle developed such a concept in his Prior and\nPosterior Analytics (henceforth abbreviated as APr.\nand APo., respectively). The goal of inquiry, he argued, was\na system of concepts and propositions organized hierarchically,\nultimately resting on knowledge of the essential natures of the\nobjects of study and certain other necessary first principles. These\ndefinitions and principles form the basis of causal explanations of\nall the other universal truths within the domain of study. Those other\nuniversal truths should identify attributes belonging to a subject\nper se, in virtue of that subject’s nature. The example\nhe uses when he introduces his account of demonstration to illustrate\nsuch propositions is from geometry: having interior angles equal to\ntwo right angles belongs to all and only triangles in virtue of their\nbeing triangles (APo. I 4, 5). This attribute belongs to all\nequilateral triangles as well—not, however, because\nthey are equilateral, but because they are triangles. Thus a\nscientific understanding of such a proposition, an understanding that\ndisplays the reason why any triangle has this property, must explain\nwhy this property belongs to triangles as such. The\nexplanation, of course, will appeal to the essential character of\nthree-sided rectilinear plane figures, i.e. to what it is to be a\ntriangle. \nThe second book of the Posterior Analytics discusses\nhow to achieve this goal of scientific knowledge, one central\nconcern being how knowledge of essences, expressed in definitions, is\nrelated to explanations expressed in the form of demonstrations. Plato\nhad formulated a famous paradox of inquiry in his dialogue\nMeno: either you know the object of your inquiry, in which\ncase inquiry is unnecessary; or you don’t know the object of\nyour inquiry, in which case inquiry is impossible (Meno\n80d5-e5). Aristotle reminds us of this paradox in the first chapter of\nthe Posterior Analytics, but his full solution only emerges\nin book II. There, he argues that perceptual experience gives us a\ngrasp of the target of inquiry that, though it does not count as\nscientific knowledge, does serve to direct further inquiry. He begins\nthe discussion by presenting us with a claim about how objects of\ninquiry are linked to objects of scientific understanding. \nAristotle conceives of these four inquiries as paired, and\nthere is a natural sequence in each pair. Knowing that some\nstate of affairs is the case, we can inquire into the reason why it is\nthe case. \nSimilarly, if we conclude an inquiry into whether something exists, we\ncan go on to investigate its nature, what it is. \nThe examples reveal a distinction that structures much of the\ndiscussion for the next ten chapters. For it looks as if\n‘factual’ inquiries concern whether some attribute belongs\nto some subject (movement to the earth, eclipse to the moon), and the\nsearch for the reason why will be a search for the causal explanation\nof the attribute belonging to that subject. By contrast, it looks like\nthe move from ‘if’ to ‘what’ is a move from\nestablishing the existence of some subject (‘god’,\n‘man’) to establishing what it is. \nHowever, the distinction is not, it turns out, so clear-cut. Having\nbegun to illustrate the distinction between inquiry if or\nwhether something is and what it is with the\nquestion ‘whether there is or is not a centaur or a god’,\nhe then characterizes the knowledge achieved as ‘knowing\nthat it is’. And in the second chapter, he begins to\nlink the two sequences of inquiry by means of his syllogistic concept\nof “middle term,” the term that is common to the two\npremises in a syllogistic proof. \nThat is, in any valid syllogistic inference, the middle term shared by\nthe premises is the warrant for the conclusion. In scientific\nexplanation, however, the middle term must also identify the\ncause of the fact given in the conclusion—what that term\nidentifies is the causal link between the subject and attribute. To\nuse another of his common examples, if we seek to explain the periodic\nsound of noise in the clouds, the middle term must identify the cause\nof the connection between that noise and those clouds. Moreover, on\nAristotle’s account of the relationship between causal\ndemonstration and scientific definition, knowing the cause of\nthunder is at the same time knowing the essence of thunder,\nwhat thunder really is. \nIn the APo., Aristotle returns regularly to such standard\nexamples of natural phenomena as thunder and eclipses—but he\nalso, and importantly, provides an extended biological example, the\nseasonal loss of leaves in broad-leafed\n plants.[2]\n In ch. 16, Aristotle imagines an inquiry that begins with questions\nsuch as ‘Why do fig trees and grape vines lose their\nleaves?’. The model answer is ‘Because they are both\nbroad-leafed.’ That is, the inquiry seeks some other feature,\ncommon to both kinds, related to the target of inquiry, the\nseasonal loss of leaves. The ‘because’ is, however,\npreliminary—it is best to see being broad-leafed as a step\ntoward causal explanation. Chapter 17 picks up the example, in the\ncontext of arguing that basic scientific inquiry seeks, wherever\npossible, co-extensive predications, which those between leaf\nloss and fig trees, or leaf loss and grape vines, are not. The\ncandidate major premise, however—‘Whatever is broad-leafed\nloses its leaves’—does identify a co-extensive\nrelationship between subject and predicate. It may thus serve as a\nproper scientific explanandum, and ‘broad-leafed’\ncan serve to identify a kind, all and only the members of which lose\ntheir\n leaves.[3]\n Thus, the middle term of the preliminary explanation becomes the\nsubject of a more basic, co-extensive predication. The cause\nof broad-leafed trees losing their leaves will, then, be something\nmore fundamental about broad-leafed trees, here identified as the\nsolidification of moisture at the leaf juncture, which can thus serve\nas the middle term in a causal explanation of this fact. But it will\nalso serve as part of a definition of leaf loss. \nThat is, we will have, if our research goes well, an account of what\nloss of leaves is. Along the way a process of identifying the kind,\nall and only the members of which will lose their leaves due to sap\ncoagulation, is assumed. Yet the Analytics provides no\nsystematic discussion about whether there are general criteria for\nidentifying these basic scientific kinds. As we will see, this is the\ntopic of one of the most interesting sections of On the Parts of\nAnimals, book I. \nThere are two quite different questions we need to ask about how these\nideas about inquiry and explanation in the Analytics are\nrelated to Aristotle’s investigations of animals: first, how is\nthe philosophy of biology presented in PA I related\nto the general account of explanation, definition and inquiry in the\nPosterior\n Analytics[4];\n and second, to what extent do the treatises reporting his actual\ninvestigations of animals conform either to his general account of\nscientific knowledge and inquiry in APo., or to the norms\nregarding the study of animals laid down in PA I. The\nremainder of this entry will be organized around these two\nquestions. \nFirst some preliminary remarks are in order about what we\nare—and are not—discussing. It seems obvious, once stated,\nthat the actual activity of studying animals is different from the\nactivity of writing or teaching about animals based on that study. We\nhave access to a number of Aristotle’s systematically organized\nwritings on animals; we do not have direct access to his\nactual investigations. Some authors in the history of science discuss,\nin their written work, the methods they used to gather the information\nand work out their theoretical ideas and even provide\n‘diaries’ describing their day-to-day\nstudies—Aristotle is not one of them. Nor did anyone else report\nobserving Aristotle carrying out his studies. There are reasonable\ninferences we can make from his writings, for example that he\nconsulted with bee-keepers, fishermen and sponge divers, that he\nperformed a great many dissections on a wide variety of animals, that\nthere were at least some diagrams based on these dissections, and so\non. Moreover, on the question of how he reasoned to specific\nexplanations we can make some reasonable inferences from things he\nsays about proper methods of biological inquiry. But it is important\nto keep in mind that we are studying texts that present, in a highly\nstructured and theoretical manner, the results of an actual\ninvestigation, the details of which we know very little. \nIt is also unclear what is the intent of the texts we do have\nthat report on these investigations. It is sometimes said they are\n‘lecture notes’. That seems pretty clearly wrong; they are\ntoo carefully written and structured. But it does seem clear, from\ncross-references, that some of them were to be studied in a certain\norder, and this order may conform to a course of study in the\nLyceum. Interestingly, while all of the other biological treatises\nrefer for further information to ‘the animal inquiries’,\noften in conjunction with ‘the dissections’, our\nHistoria Animalium has no references to the other,\nexplanatory studies. This suggests that the ‘inquiries and\ndissections’ had a different function in such a course of study,\nperhaps something akin to ‘reference works’. \nFinally, it is also worth recalling that the series of treatises we\nhave was likely compiled hundreds of years after Aristotle’s\ndeath from whatever he left. It seems unlikely we will ever be able to\ndetermine the exact relationship between the so-called\n‘Andronican’ edition, the likely source of our texts, and\nwhat was produced during Aristotle’s lifetime. \nThese three caveats place constraints on what I can reasonably claim\nto be doing. I will be discussing the treatises that report the\nresults of Aristotle’s investigations of animals. I will assume\nthat texts that have been passed down to us reflect what he wrote on\nthis subject, and that the cross-references in those texts are his and\nreflect his own views about how these various studies are related to\neach other. \nOn the Parts of Animals, book I (PA I) begins by\noutlining its purpose, which is to establish a set of standards for\njudging natural investigations (639a15). Its five chapters pursue this\npurpose, discussing the appropriate level of generality for such\nstudies, the modes of causality and of necessity to be used in\nbiological explanations, the relation of form to matter in living\nthings, the proper method of division for this subject matter, the\nmeans of identifying kinds and their activities at the proper level of\nabstraction, and much more. Two sorts of evidence support the\nconclusion that this book is intended to deal with problems and\nquestions that arise in the application of the general philosophy of\nscience found in the Posterior Analytics to the theoretical\ninvestigation of living nature. \nThe following passage from the History of Animals (a better\nthough less familiar translation would be Animal Inquiries)\nsuggests that the entire biological project is organized in accordance\nwith the theory of inquiry developed in APo. II. This passage\ncomes near the end of chapter six in the first book of HA.\nAfter five chapters in which Aristotle lays out the kinds of\nsimilarities and differences among animals to be studied and sketches\nthe ways in which these differences are to be investigated, he makes\nthe following sweeping programmatic statement about the investigation\nto come, and where it fits in the entire scientific study of\nanimals. \nThe natural way to proceed, then, is to begin with inquiry\n(historia), with the aim of grasping the differences between,\nand attributes of, all the animals; and then to attempt to\ndiscover their causes. This is natural because, given that our goal is\ndemonstrative understanding, we want to end up with a clear\ndistinction between the facts to be explained (the peri\nhôn) and their explanation (the ex\nhôn). This statement echoes the summary, in\nAPo. I 10, of the components of demonstrative knowledge: \nThe History of Animals characterizes itself as establishing\nthe attributes and the differences that belong to all animals, and\nclaims that by carrying out this inquiry we are prepared to go on to\nsearch for the causes. Indeed, he appears to suggest that a successful\nhistoria or factual inquiry will prepare us to grasp the\ndifference between those facts that need to be explained and those\nthat will be invoked in our explanations. In the language of the\nPosterior Analytics: HA establishes the\nfact, e.g. that all animals with lungs have\nwindpipes, or that all cetacea have lungs and are viviparous,\ntypically seeking to identify groups by means of discovering\nco-extensive differentiae with the aid of the method of\n division.[5]\n The proper use of division, moreover, will give clear indications of\nwhich predications are basic and which derivative. Works such as\nParts of Animals or Generation of Animals, on the\nother hand, seek to establish the reason why—the cause—of\nthe fact. If Aristotle is following the method described in the\nAnalytics, these causal explanations should at the same time\npoint us to essential definitions of what it is to be a windpipe or to\nbe viviparous. It is a question currently much debated whether\ndefinition was, in fact, an explicit goal of HA or simply a\nconsequence of the explanatory goal clearly identified in the above\npassage from HA I 6; and if so, whether definitions of animal\nkinds were sought, or only definitions of their attributes.\nAs we will see, there are a number of chapter summaries in the\nexplanatory treatises that make a point of claiming that both\nan explanation of why a part is found in those animals that\nhave it, and an account of what that part is, have\nbeen provided; but one must work very hard to reconstruct any\ndefinitions of animal kinds in those treatises.\n [6] \nA number of texts in Aristotle’s causal investigations reinforce\nthe message of HA I 6, stressing that the preliminary work of\ninquiries that establish and organize the facts at various levels of\ngenerality has been accomplished; and they regularly refer to\nsomething like what is reported in our HA as the place to\nlook for the results of this preliminary work. Two explicit statements\nto that effect follow, one from the beginning of his study of the\ncauses of the differences in animal locomotion, one from the beginning\nof his study of the causes of the differences among the parts of\nanimals. \nEach of these passages explicitly describes the study of animals with\nwhich Aristotle is engaged in the language of Aristotle’s theory\nof research in APo. II 1. Indeed, the passage from\nHA I 6 does so by insisting that the natural\nmethod to use is to first get clear on the differences and\nattributes to be demonstrated (‘establish the fact\nthat…’) before going on to find the causes\n(‘the reason why, i.e. the cause’) to be appealed to in\nthese demonstrations. Animal historiai are a kind of\nhoti inquiry—that is, the History of Animals\npresents the facts to be explained organized so as to be prepared for\ncausal\n demonstration.[7] \nThe IA and PA, on the other hand, refer to\nthemselves as pursuing a causal inquiry into the reason\nwhy the various kinds of animals are differentiated as they\nare, and they acknowledge that they are able to do this precisely\nbecause the factual investigation into the locomotion and parts of\nanimals has been accomplished. In both cases Aristotle emphasizes the\ndistinction on which we are focused, making it all but certain that he\nis reminding us of his philosophy of scientific research. \nThere is a second line of evidence, quite independent of these\nprogrammatic statements, which leads to the same conclusion. The\ntopics covered in PA I take the form of specifications of the\ncentral topics of the Posterior Analytics. These\nspecifications are required because animals are [a] complex unities of\nmatter (body) and form (soul); [b] arise by a complex process of\ndevelopment; [c] the end—that for the sake of which the\ndevelopment occurs— is both causally and definitionally prior to\nthat process; [d] a distinctive kind of necessity, conditional\nnecessity, is operative; and [e] a special method of\nmulti-differentiae division is required. Such a discussion is required\nby the fact that although the Posterior Analytics intends its\nepistemic standards to be applicable to natural science – as is\nclear from the many examples drawn from natural science in book II\n– it provides no details as to how this application is to be\naccomplished. \nWhat, then, does PA I tell us about the proper way to\ninvestigate animals? Aristotle begins by posing a problem about how to\nidentify the proper objects of investigation. Should we focus on\naccounting for the features of groups close to the level of\nperception, such as human beings, horses, dogs and such, or should we\nlook for attributes that ‘belong in common according to kind,\nand then later study their distinctive attributes’\n(639b4–5). He notes that since there are many attributes that\nare common to many of these more concrete kinds, focusing our study on\nthem will have the result of our repeating ourselves—much as if\nwe were to remain at the level of ‘olive trees lose their\nleaves’, ‘grape vines lose their leaves’. Among\nthese common attributes Aristotle distinguishes those that seem not to\ndiffer across the kinds that have them (he cites respiration and\ndeath) from those that are ‘ distinctive in form ’ such as\nlocomotion: “it is apparent that locomotion is not one in form,\nbecause flying, swimming, walking, and crawling differ”\n(639b1–2). Aristotle deals with this question, so reminiscent of\nAPo. I 4–5, in PA I 4, but only after he has\nintroduced a new way of thinking about differentiae and division.\nAfter discussing his recommendations regarding the use of division in\nbiology, we will return to look at his answer. \nAnimals are complex structures organized so as to be able to perform\nan integrated set of functions and activities; yet the Posterior\nAnalytics provides one with very little guidance as to how to\napply its norms to such things. Again PA I, and especially\nchapters 1 and 5, appears designed to provide that guidance. It seeks\nto establish [a] the priority of goal-causation to motive-causation,\n[b] the priority of the study of an animal’s form (which, he\nargues, should be identified with its soul) to the study of its\nmaterial constituents (i.e. its body), and [c] the presence of a\nspecial kind of necessity operative where goals and form take\npriority, namely hypothetical or conditional necessity (cf.\nPA I 1, 640a10–641a32, 642a1–31). \nThe argument is complicated in virtue of its manner of presentation.\nFirst, it is a narrative in which Aristotle gradually develops his own\nviews by exposing the errors of those who investigated nature before\nhim; it is structured as presenting an alternative to views expressed\nby Empedocles and Democritus, and as in the spirit of Socrates\n(642a24–31). Second, as is so typical of him, what initially may\nappear to be three separate narratives turn out to be a single,\ncomplex case for emphasizing the study of form, teleological\nexplanation, and conditional necessity. Form, in the case of living\nthings, turns out to be capacity to perform living functions, i.e.\nsoul; and thus the form of a living thing is causally prior to the\nmatter, because it is the goal for the sake of which the parts of the\nanimal—its matter—come to be and exist. This, in turn,\nprovides us with the appropriate way to understand ‘conditional\nnecessity’—parts and the processes that produce them do\nnot necessitate the outcome; on the contrary, the outcome necessitates\nthat the developmental processes bring about the parts that are\nnecessary for the organism to live its life, and do so in a temporally\nand spatially coordinated manner (cf. GA II 4,\n740b19–34; II 6, 743a16–36). \nChapters 2 and 3 have a similar narrative structure. Gradually, a\npositive theory of biological division emerges from the ashes of a\ndetailed critical analysis of those (Plato and certain of his\nstudents) who “attempt to grasp the particular by dividing the\nkind into two differences” (642b5), a practice he finds in\n“the written divisions.” (642b11) The method he is\ncriticizing combines two basic techniques that lead to things being\ngrouped together that are fundamentally different and things being\ngrouped separately that are similar: dichotomy and division by\nnon-essentials. Dichotomy is the method of dividing the higher\ndifferentia into two exhaustive alternatives, which often entails that\none of the alternatives is simply the privation of the other (winged,\nwingless). Division by non-essentials is the technique of dividing a\nprior differentia-class by means of an unrelated difference. For\nexample, you might first divide animals into wild and tame, and then\ndivide the tame animals into footed and footless. \nTo avoid the problems created by this dichotomous and arbitrary\nmethod, Aristotle recommends a method that divides each differentia by\nmore and more determinate forms of that differentia, and does so\nsimultaneously on as many differentiae as are correlated at a given\nlevel of universality. \nThus, if all birds have beaks, feathers, wings of a sort, are bipedal,\netc. , the biologist needs to perform the proper sort of division on\nall of these in order to grasp the various sub-kinds of bird. This\nwill not, of course, give us demonstrative knowledge; but it will help\nus to grasp the co-extensively correlated features, at each level of\nspecificity, that are the proper things about which to seek\ndemonstrative knowledge. \nAn interesting feature of this extended criticism of dichotomous,\narbitrary division and the development of a systematic,\nmulti-differentiae alternative is that it takes for granted the\n‘naturalness’ of certain kinds that ‘the many’\nhave identified. As he says above, ‘these [birds and fish] have\nbeen defined by many differences’; earlier he had said that the\nterms ‘bird’ and ‘fish’ name a\n‘similarity’, a group ‘alike in kind’ that\ndichotomous division inappropriately tears apart (642b13–19).\nDuring the discussion of division there is very little clarification\nof what underlies this notion of similarity or likeness in kind.\nHowever, armed with a method of division suited to the study of\nanimals, the discussion quickly turns to the question of what it is\nthat makes it appropriate to treat bird and fish as a kind, and to the\nspecification of rules for identifying other such kinds. What\n‘bird’ and ‘fish’ name are, he claims, kinds\nwith “common natures, and forms not very far apart”\n(644b2–3). Prior to understanding these kinds through a\nscientific account of this common nature, we can—as the\nPosterior Analytics argues—grasp these kinds, i.e.\ngrasp that all birds have a common\n nature.[8]\n We do this by noting that they have many general differences that\nvary in measurable ways—by the more and less, as he puts it. \nIt is with this very topic of different levels of similarity and\ndifference of parts that the Historia Animalium begins,\nextending the method immediately to differences in activities, ways of\nlife and traits of character. (HA I 1, 486a5–487a13)\nThis is, then, clearly a discussion of how one achieves\n‘knowledge of the fact’, rather than ‘knowledge of\nthe reason why’. \nThe closing section of PA I (treated since the Renaissance as\nits fifth chapter) is often thought of as having two, essentially\nunrelated parts. And there is some justification for this; one could\neasily remove the first half of the chapter and be left with a very\ncoherent narrative. At that point, Aristotle states that once one has\nmade an initial division of the attributes that belong to all the\nanimals per se, the next step is to an attempt “to\ndivide their causes,” after which he applies the analysis of\nsameness and difference from the previous discussion of parts to\nactivities. He then closes the discussion by arguing that the\ndifferences we find in animal parts are to be explained by reference\nto differences found among their activities. Thus a proper division of\nactivities is a division of the causes of the parts of animals. \nNevertheless, a good case can be made that this ‘chapter’\nforms a coherent whole, a sort of culmination of the book. It begins\nwith perhaps the best known passage in Aristotle’s biological\nworks, a stirring and beautifully crafted encomium to the joys of\nstudying animals, even the most lowly. An elegant introduction divides\nnatural beings into those that are eternal and those that partake of\ngeneration and perishing, noting that there are attractions to\nstudying both: though access to information about the former is\nlimited, he likens it to “…a chance, brief glimpse of the\nones we love”; on the other hand the latter, perishable things\n“take the prize in respect of understanding because we know more\nof them and know them more fully” and they are “more of\nour own nature” (644b23–645a3). He then elaborates on the\nvalue of the study of the living things around us. \nSince we have completed stating the way things appear to us about the\ndivine things, it remains to speak about animal nature, omitting\nnothing in our power, whether of less or greater esteem. For even in\nthe study of animals disagreeable to perception, the nature that\ncrafted them likewise provides extraordinary pleasures to those able\nto know their causes and who are by nature philosophers. Surely it\nwould be unreasonable, even absurd, for us to enjoy studying\nlikenesses of animals—on the ground that we are at the same time\nstudying the art, such as painting and sculpture, that made\nthem—while not prizing even more the study of things constituted\nby nature, at least when we can behold their causes. \nFor this reason we should not be childishly disgusted at the\nexamination of the less valuable animals. For in all natural things\nthere is something marvelous. Even as Heraclitus is said to have\nspoken to those strangers who wished to meet him but stopped as they\nwere approaching when they saw him warming himself at the\noven—he bade them to enter without fear, ‘For there are\ngods here too’—so too one should approach research about\neach of the animals without disgust, since in every one there is\nsomething natural and good. For what is not haphazard but rather for\nthe sake of something is in fact present most of all in the works of\nnature; the end for the sake of which takes the place of the good. If\nsomeone considered the study of the other animals to lack value, he\nought to think the same thing about himself as well; for it is\nimpossible to look at that from which mankind has been\nconstituted—blood, flesh, bones, blood vessels, and other such\nparts—without considerable disgust. Just as one who discusses\nthe parts or equipment of anything should not be thought of as doing\nso in order to draw attention to the matter, nor for the sake of the\nmatter, but rather in order to draw attention to the overall shape\n(e.g. to a house rather than bricks, mortar, and timbers); likewise\none should consider the discussion of nature to be referring to the\ncomposite and the overall substantial being rather than to those\nthings which do not exist when separated from their substantial being.\n(PA I 5, 645a4–36) \nReaders, often carried away by the rhetoric of this passage, fail to\nnotice that there is an argument, with two key conclusions. The first\nis that, while studying the eternal objects of the heaven may be a\nnoble pursuit, if scientific understanding is your goal, you are much\nmore likely to achieve it in the study of animals and plants:\n“…anyone wishing to labor sufficiently can grasp many\nthings about each kind…we know more of them and we know them\nmore fully…they are nearer to us and more of our own\nnature…” (excerpted from 644b29–645a3). The second\nis that if one has the proper philosophical focus, then one realizes\nthat the somewhat unpleasant task of dissecting blood vessels and the\nlike, is a means to understanding that for the sake of which\nand soul, those objects of inquiry argued to be primary in\nchapter 1. For the lesson of chapter 1 is that understanding living\nmatter is achieved primarily by means of an understanding of the\nfunctional goals served by the parts. As he puts it here: “in\nevery animal there is something natural and good; that which is for\nthe sake of something is present most of all in the works of nature;\nand the end for the sake of which each animal has been constituted\ntakes the place of the good” (645a21–25). \nThe remainder of the chapter recommends approaching the\nactivities associated with animals and their parts in a\nmanner exactly analogous to the approach to the study of parts\nrecommended in chapter 4 (645b1–14); and it concludes with a\nschematic discussion of the variety of teleological relationships that\nhold among parts, between parts and their\nactivities, and among activities. Aristotle encourages us to\nconceive of these relationships in a yet more unified way, as\na single complex relationship between a single complex activity\n(living, I suppose) and a single complex instrument, the\nanimal’s body. (645b15–36) \nIn the first book of On the Parts of Animals, then, we have a\nsystematic philosophy of biology, which in many respects seems to\nprovide what is missing in the Analytics regarding the\napplication of its program to the study of living nature. But does\nAristotle’s biological practice carry through on this program?\nIt is worthwhile keeping that question in mind as we survey those\nbooks that report the results of Aristotle’s animal studies.\n \nAs we saw earlier, Aristotle introduces his systematic study of the\ndifferences and attributes of animals as a\nhoti-investigation, a factual investigation preliminary to\nthe search for causal demonstrations. By studying it, then, we ought\nto be able to develop a rich picture of what this theoretically\nmotivated, preliminary stage of investigation aims to achieve, and\nperhaps a glimpse of what such an investigation entails. \nAs many studies, following up on the pioneering work of David Balme\n(1961, 1987b) have now established, the History of Animals\n(HA) is a work that from first to last displays and builds\nupon multi-differentiae division of animal differences (see Gotthelf\n1988, 1997b; Lennox 2001b, chs. 1, 2; Pellegrin 1986). It is organized\nas a study of four kinds of animal differences first mentioned in\nHA’s first chapter as the principal objects of study\n(at 486b22–487a14)—differences in parts (the topic of\nBooks I–IV), in modes of activity and ways of life (those\nrelated to generation in Books V-VI--and human generation in\nIX--others in Book VII) and in characters (Book VIII). These in turn\nare sub-divided; for example, discussion of the non-uniform\nparts (organs, as we say) of animals with blood (I 7-III 1) is\nfollowed by that of their uniform parts (tissues, III\n2–22). A discussion of the parts of animals without blood then\nconcludes the discussion of differences in parts (IV 1–8). Book\nIV concludes with a discussion of differences in sensory faculties,\nvoice, and differences related to\n sex.[9] \nIt is only once Aristotle begins to distinguish differences\namong, say, uniform parts that various groupings of animals play an\nimportant role in organizing the discussion. And in so far as there\nare relatively stable general groupings of animals, these are\nidentified by noting their possession of stable correlations among\ndifferentiae—for example, there are a large number of different\nanimals all of which have wings, feathers, beaks, and two fleshless\nlegs, and this group of animals has been given the designation\n ‘bird’.[10]\n In other cases, such groups have not been generally recognized, and\nAristotle simply refers to them by means of some of their most\nimportant correlated differences—the four-legged and\nlive-bearing animals, for example. \nWhat is clear from the practice of the History of Animals is\nboth the value of division and its limitations. Division by itself\ndoes not provide you with the axes of division; rather they\nare presupposed. Division does not give you animal kinds; as we saw in\nthe previous section, one needs to turn to PA I 4 and\nHA I 6 for Aristotle’s thoughts on how those kinds are\nestablished. Something besides division is needed in order for a\nresearcher to recognize theoretically significant\nkinds. Why group animals together based on their possession of four\nlegs and the ability to produce living offspring (rather than eggs)?\nCertainly each of these traits is the product of a division, one of\nmodes of locomotion and one of modes of reproduction. But those\ndivisions do not tell you that animals with four legs that bear living\nyoung constitute a scientifically significant group. \nA second limitation of division is its indifference to the distinction\nbetween causally fundamental characteristics and proper attributes, to\nuse the language of the Analytics. Yet, being able to\ndistinguish these is absolutely fundamental to Aristotelian science. A\ncareful comparative study of the History of Animals, on the\none hand, and works such as On the Parts or On the\nGeneration of Animals, on the other, provides insight into how\nAristotle understands and deploys this distinction in his actual\nscientific practice. And as we have seen above, Aristotle draws\nexplicit attention to its importance for his biological investigations\nin a number of key texts within those investigations themselves. To\nstudy in detail the interplay between definition, causal demonstration\nand division in the biology is to see Aristotle working through just\nthose problems which form the central question of Posterior\nAnalytics II—how precisely are definition, causal\ndemonstration and division related to one another in the quest for,\nand achievement of, scientific understanding? \nIt is impossible to present even a hint of the richness of the\nempirical content of the Historia Animalium here. Before\ngoing on to a discussion of the works that report the results of\nAristotle’s causal investigations of animal parts and animal\ngeneration, however, two examples of reports from HA are\nprovided for comparison with corresponding discussions in PA\nand GA. The first example discusses the organs of respiration\nin blooded animals; these are the first internal organs\ndiscussed after Aristotle has concluded his review of their\nexternal parts. \nSo, then, the number and character of the external parts of the\nblooded animals and how they differ from one another has been stated.\nWe must now discuss how the internal parts are situated, first in the\nblooded animals. \nAs many as (hosa) are four legged and live-bearing all\n(panta) have an esophagus and windpipe, arranged just as in\nhuman beings; it is also arranged similarly in as many of the four\nlegged animals as lay eggs, and in the birds; but they differ in the\nforms (tois eidesi) of these parts. Generally, all and only\n(panta hosa) those receiving air by inhaling and exhaling in\nevery case (panta) have a lung, windpipe and esophagus; and\nthe position of the esophagus and windpipe is alike in all,\nbut the organs are not, while lung is neither alike in all nor is it\npositioned in a like manner. And again as many as (hosa) have\nblood all (panta) have a heart… . But not all [blooded\nanimals] have a lung, for instance fish do not, nor any other animal\nthere might be that has gills. (505b23–506a12, excerpts) \nThere are a number of features in this passage that are common\nthroughout the Historia Animalium and provide insight into\nits methods and aims. First is the syntactically redundant linguistic\npattern hosa…panta (“as many as...all”),\nvariants of which are common in this treatise. Aristotle appears to\nuse the sentence form “As many as are X, all have Y” for a\nquite specific reason. It is not just to note a universal\ncorrelation; it is to do so while leaving the extension of the\ncorrelation open—a brilliant methodological innovation. New\nanimals with the correlation can be discovered, but the generalization\nwill not change, since it is about the universal correlation among\ndifferentiae—in this case internal organs—not about the\nkinds that exemplify it. It appears that when Aristotle intensifies\nthe expression by writing panta hosa, as he does once here,\nhe means to signal a convertible universal, an\n‘entailment’ as we would say. Aristotle first lists a\nnumber of distinct groups, all the members of which have the three\norgans being discussed, windpipe, lung and esophagus. Then, using the\nterm ‘generally’ to signal what he is about to do, he\nidentifies a differentia that all these groups have in common, and\nwhich is coextensive with these three organs—inhaling\nand exhaling air. The inductive pattern has the following form: \n‘As many as are P all have Y; As many as are\nQ all have Y… . \nGenerally, all and only those that are X (a feature common to\nP, Q…) have Y’. \nBy going on to note that as many as have blood have a heart, he\nimplicitly is warning the reader about a potential false inference one\nmight draw from the examples so far: that all blooded animals have a\nlung. He mentions fish as an example of blooded animals without a\nlung, but immediately identifies the relevant differentia:\n‘those blooded animals that have gills do not have\nthese organs [the lung and its associated parts]’. He is careful\nnot to restrict the universal to a kind—the relevant correlation\nis with gills, in whichever animals they might be found. \nWhile the inductive strategy of this work, directing us to high-level,\nconvertible universals is, I hope, now clear, it is also important to\nnote what is completely absent. Aristotle rarely in this work\nclaims any of these correlations is necessary, or that others\nare impossible. He does not distinguish features that are\npart of the essence of a kind from others that are mere\nattributes; and he carefully avoids any hint of causal\nexplanation. All of this is to be expected, given the\nmethodological guidelines for historia that we discussed\nearlier—historia is preliminary to causal investigation\nand prepares us for it. In the passage we are currently considering,\nfor example, it is striking that he notes the convertible correlation\nbetween lung, windpipe and esophagus, on the one hand, and inhaling\nand exhaling of air, on the other, but does not claim that\ntwo of the organs are present for the sake of breathing. (In fact, the\nword for ‘breathing’ is never used!) Though he uses the\nterm ‘nature’ regularly in HA, he does\nnot, as he does so often in his causal investigations, claim\nthat nature does nothing in vain, or that it always does what is best\nfor each organism. Nor does he talk about the parts of an animal as\nits material nature, nor about its living capacities as aspects of its\nformal nature. Indeed there is virtually no mention of the matter-form\ndistinction in HA. It is only when we turn to the various\nbiological treatises devoted to causal investigation that this\nlanguage associated with the search for definitions and demonstrations\ncomes to the fore. \nThe aim of this brief analysis of one small passage is to convey a\ntaste of the methodological depth and complexity of this great\nscientific treatise, so often misunderstood as a poorly organized\ncompendium of nature lore. One more example from the books dealing\nwith generation must be given, so that we may compare it with a\ncorresponding discussion in De Generatione\nAnimalium. \nHA V-VI discuss all aspects of animal generation, moving from\nconsideration of differences in modes and timing of copulation and\nreproduction to the actual process of generation (or\n‘development’, as we more often say). As in his discussion\nof parts, he moves through the various blooded kinds and then\ndiscusses generation in bloodless kinds and from identifying the\nuniversals common to all members of a group to identifying the\npeculiarities of more specific kinds. At HA VI 3, having\npreviously described the common and peculiar characteristics of\ncopulation in birds, he turns to recording his observations of the\ndevelopment of the chick at the critical fourth day after the egg has\nbeen laid. \nHe begins with a wide generalization about all birds, followed by a\n‘more and less’ correlation between the size of\nthe bird and the rate of development. This device allows\nAristotle to use the careful description of the chick egg opened on\nday four as a universal description of development; the reader is\nlicensed to infer that the same stage of development will occur in all\nbirds, but may occur either earlier or later, depending on whether\nthey are larger or smaller than the domestic chicken.\nAristotle’s description of this classic experiment led to its\nbeing repeated many times in the\n Renaissance.[11]\n Anyone who has seen modern films of the chick at this stage of\ndifferentiation can appreciate the accuracy of Aristotle’s\ndescription, especially when one takes into account the size of the\nchick embryo at this stage of growth. \nFor Aristotle, ‘historia’, which corresponds\nroughly to our systematics—the scientific organization of\ninformation about animals—serves the goal of causal explanation;\nand explanation by reference to goals and functions is the primary\nform of causal explanation in biology. \nOn the Parts of Animals II-IV presents Aristotle’s\nattempt to provide causal understanding about the sort of information\none finds organized in HA I-IV, information about the uniform\nand non-uniform parts of animals. (PA I, it will be recalled,\nis a presentation of philosophical principles for the study of\nanimals; see section 4, above.) Here, I will be narrowly focused on\njust a couple of passages in PA II-IV, but will begin with a\nvery brief sketch of its overall structure. It begins (PA II\n1–2) with a careful and complex discussion of the causal\nrelationships between uniform and non-uniform parts (roughly, this\ndistinction corresponds to our distinction between tissues and\norgans), stressing the teleological priority of the whole organism to\nthe parts, and among parts the priority of the non-uniform to the\nuniform. PA II 3–10 then discusses the uniform parts,\nbeginning with that out of which all the others are nourished, blood,\nand ending with flesh, bones, and analogous materials (nail, horn,\nhoof). From II 10 to III 3, Aristotle discusses the external parts of\nblooded animals associated with the head. But when he gets to the\nneck, he turns to the internal parts, and from III 3 to IV 4 he\ndiscusses the ‘innards’ of the blooded animals. From IV 5\nto 9 he discusses the parts, both internal and external, of the\n‘bloodless’ animals, i.e. the crustaceans, testaceous\nmollusks, cephalopods and insects. Finally, at IV 10, he returns to\nthe external parts associated with the torso and limbs of the live\nbearing and egg laying quadrupeds (10-11), birds (12), and fish (13);\nand ends by discussing a number of animals that ‘dualize’\nbetween being land-dwellers and water dwellers or flyers. \nIn order to compare the methods of this treatise with the discussion\nof the parts in HA, it will be useful to look briefly at\nPA III 3, a discussion of the lung, windpipe and\nesophagus. \nNot all animals have a neck, but only those with the parts for the\nsake of which the neck is naturally present—these\nare the windpipe and the part known as the esophagus. Now the larynx\nis present by nature for the sake of breathing; for it is\nthrough this part that animals draw in and expel air when they inhale\nand exhale. This is why those without a lung have no neck,\ne.g. the kind consisting of the fish. The esophagus is the part\nthrough which nourishment proceeds to the gut; so that animals without\nnecks manifestly do not have an esophagus. But it is not\nnecessary to have the esophagus for the sake of\nnutrition; for it concocts nothing. And further, it is\npossible for the gut to be placed right next to the position\nof the mouth, while for the lung this is impossible. For\nthere needs first to be something common like a conduit,\nwhich then divides in two and through which the air is separated into\npassages—in this way the lung may best accomplish\ninhalation and exhalation. \nSo, then, the organ connected with breathing from necessity\nhas length; therefore it is necessary for there to be an\nesophagus between the mouth and the stomach. The esophagus is fleshy,\nwith a sinuous elasticity—sinuous so that it\nmay dilate when food is ingested, yet fleshy so that\nit is soft and yielding and is not damaged when it is scraped by the\nfood going down. (664a14–34) \nI have highlighted the language of nature, necessity, possibility\n(and impossibility), and being for the sake of in this passage in\norder to highlight the contrast with the discussion of the same\norganic correlations in the corresponding HA passage. Here\nthe goal is explanation—parts are present and have the\ncharacter they do primarily due to the conditional necessity imposed\nby the organism’s functional requirements. One sees here the\nAristotle that so impressed the great French naturalist Georges\nCuvier: Aristotle is not only systematically discussing the adaptive\nfunctions of each of these organs; he is also displaying the complex\nway in which the internal parts of animals constitute an organic\nsystem. \nThe lack of names for animal kinds is also noteworthy; as in the\ncorresponding passage from HA II, fish are mentioned once as\nan instance of blooded animals that lack the organs in question; but\nthe stress throughout is on this particular system of organs in\nwhichever blooded animals have them. Aristotle’s goal is to\nexplain why it is that certain animals have these organs, and why it\nis that, if they have one of these organs, they must\nhave the others. Some, but not all, of the explanations specify the\nfunction for the sake of which the parts are present; and even the\nmaterial nature of the tissues, whether fleshy or sinuous, may be\nexplained in functional terms. This discussion also displays a\nhierarchy of teleological connections of the sort described\nat the close of PA I 5, 645b28–33—one activity is\npresent for the sake of another more basic one; a part that performs a\nsubordinate activity is present for the sake of a part that performs a\nmore important activity. Inhaling and exhaling are for the sake of\nrespiration (which is for the sake of cooling the blood); a windpipe\nis present for the sake of transporting air to and from the lung; a\nneck is present to protect the windpipe. \nFor reasons that will become clear, the relationship between the books\nof the Historia Animalium dealing with generation and On\nthe Generation of Animals is somewhat more complex. GA\nhas a reasonably clear organization of its own; but its central\n(though not only) projects of explaining the causal roles of\nthe male and female in sexual generation and the causality of\nembryological development raises a host of topics and problems well\nbeyond the scope of HA. But a study of how the two works are\nrelated is nonetheless illuminating. The discussion of\nAristotle’s biological practice will thus close by considering\nthe causal explanation of embryological development and in particular\nthe explanation for the early appearance of the heart, with a final\nlook at the application of this explanation to the case of embryonic\nbirds. \nAs I noted earlier, taken on its own terms, GA has a\nreasonably clear structure. Here again, as with PA II-IV, I will begin\nwith a brief sketch of its overall structure, before focusing narrowly\non its method as applied to one problem. It begins (715a1–18) by\nnoting that it will explain two sets of facts left unexplained in\nPA: the differences among the parts related to generation;\nand the generation of the parts generally. Though he\nacknowledges that some animals do not have males and females, he\ntreats sexual generation as his central topic. Initially he provides a\ntheoretically ‘neutral’ account of the distinction: the\nmale is what generates in another, the female what generates in itself\n(716a14–15). It is not until late in book I that he begins to\ndevelop his own detailed theory of their distinctive contributions to\ngeneration. \nThe first 13 chapters characterize the reproductive organs in the\nmales and females of blooded animals, while 14–16 do the same\nfor the bloodless animals that have males and females. Beginning in\nchapter 17, the discussion turns to the relevant uniform\nparts related to generation, sperma (roughly\n‘seed’) and milk, but the discussion of milk is postponed\nuntil book IV. This immediately raises the contentious issue of\nwhether both male and female contribute sperma, and\nif both, then what the nature of their respective contributions is.\nThis is a large part of the discussion from I 17-II 5, one of the most\ndifficult stretches of text in the Aristotelian corpus, and the one on\nwhich our attention will be focused. But to continue our overview: the\nremainder of book II (from chapter 5 on) discusses the causes of the\nembryological development of live-bearing animals, while the\negg-laying animals are the primary focus in book III, which closes\nwith a discussion of animals that are not sexually generated,\nincluding those that arise ‘spontaneously.’ GA IV\nturns to the development of inherited differences within kinds,\nbeginning with the most important intra-specific difference for his\ntheory of generation, the difference between male and female. From\nthere it moves on to family resemblance, differences in the number of\noffspring produced and to the causes of deformities. GA V\naims to explain ‘more and less’ variations within kinds\nthat appear late in development and that may be fully accounted for by\nidentifying material level causal interactions—differences\nwithin a kind in the color, texture or density of a part, for\nexample. \nThe remainder of this discussion will focus on the general causal\ntheory of animal generation developed in the first half of GA\n II.[12]\n In the closing chapters of book I, Aristotle argues that both the\nmale and female contributions are formed from a ‘useful\nresidue’ of blood by a concocting process, the male’s\nbeing more fully concocted than the female’s. From this point on\nthe male’s contribution is typically termed gonê\n(semen), and the female’s katamenia (menses). Aristotle\nis not entirely consistent, however: occasionally he uses the generic\nterm sperma for the male contribution and explicitly\ncontrasts it with katamenia (727a27–30); while at other\ntimes he refers to katamenia as a sort of sperma\n(728a26–29). \nThe two contributions are variously described. The male contributes a\nsource of movement or dunamis (power), which, as the argument\nunfolds, turns out to be a special sort of capacity to heat present in\nthe semen’s pneuma or air, which is part of its nature.\n(This gets fully worked out in GA II 2–3) The semen\nitself is mere a vehicle for delivering this warmth; the male makes no\nmaterial contribution to the offspring. The female contributes what\nmight be called ‘prepared matter’; all it needs is the\npresence within it of the heat from the male and it begins a more or\nless lengthy and complicated developmental process, which he\nanalogizes to a sort of automaton performing a complex set of\ncoordinated movements once it is set in motion. \nHe relies at several points in the argument on an analogy with crafts,\nsuch as house building: \nThis obscure analogy gradually gets unpacked in the first four\nchapters of GA II. The general principle common to art and\nnature is this: \nIt is the prepared portion of the female’s katamenia\nthat is potentially such as the contributor of semen is actually. And\nthe semen conveys to it a movement or power, such that “when the\nmovement ceases each of the parts comes to be and is ensouled\n(734b24–25).” That is, in embryological development, a\npart emerges within a system that is organized to provide nutrition\nfor its growth, and that is guided by a complex ‘program’\nfor development. Notice that as the part comes to be it already has\nthe functional capacity associated with it—it comes to be\nand is ensouled. \nThis passage comes immediately after Aristotle has stressed two\nrelated points: that the uniform parts and the instrumental parts\narise simultaneously; and that even flesh and bone have a function to\nperform. These points are tightly connected. The defining features of\ntissues are not merely their affective qualities, but their biological\nfunctions; and their biological functions are intimately connected to\ntheir roles in constituting—and being able to play\nfunctional roles in—instrumental parts; many, if not all,\nof their affective qualities are a consequence of their biological\nroles. \nIn the process of making this argument, Aristotle also stresses a\ncrucial and problematic dis-analogy: Natural things, once\ntheir generation begins, ‘grow by means of themselves’\n(735a13–14). This is the most fundamental difference between art\nand nature for Aristotle; a nature is a source of change within the\nthing itself (Physics II. 1). Natural development, then,\nthough initiated by the warmth of the male parent, must internalize\nthat source of change. The carpenter may not mix any of his own\nmaterial in his buildings; but he must be continuously, physically\ninvolved in the movements that create those buildings. Not so with the\nmale parent in natural generation. So how does a complex process that\nhas its origins in an external generator become a natural process of\ndevelopment? \nFor Aristotle, the heart (or its analogue in bloodless animals) is\ncrucial. It is the first part created by the heat derived from the\nsemen of the male parent, and henceforth it is the primary internal\nsource of that heat and thus of further development (735a16–26).\nThe following explanation begins to bring us into contact with our\npassage on generation from the History of Animals. \nHaving developed this general explanation during his discussion of his\ncentral case, viviparous development, in GA II, Aristotle\nmoves on to egg-laying animals in book III. GA III 1 carries\nover to them whatever is common to the two cases, with discussion of\nthe development of birds in their eggs beginning in GA III 2.\nA recurring aspect of his argument, here as in PA, is to\nrefer us for descriptive details to the histories (presumably\nthe basis of our HA) and to a collection of representations\nof dissections (tragically not preserved). \nThe most general differences among egg-layers relate to the\n‘completeness’ of the egg when laid. Because birds lay\neggs that become hard as soon as they are exposed to the air\n(752a30-b2), they are taken to be better prepared when laid than the\neggs of other egg-laying animals. Ignoring much interesting and\nimportant detail, we will take up the discussion of development within\nthe eggs of birds as they incubate. Aristotle distinguishes the\n‘white’ and the ‘yolk’, not descriptively as\nhe did in HA, but functionally (752b18–28). \nIn this case (though not always) one does get far more detail in\nHA. These references to histories and dissections can be\nmisleading unless one takes into account the differences in the aims,\nand thus in the organization, of these treatises. In this case, for\nexample, nothing is said in GA about the heart ‘beating\nand moving as though it were alive’. As we saw, however,\nGA II stresses that in the development of live-bearing\nanimals, the heart is first to be formed, is ensouled from the start,\nand is the source of development for all the other parts—a much\nmore ‘theory-laden’ characterization that stresses the\nheart’s causal role. And because of the organizational structure\nof GA, much of what is said in his discussion of the\nlive-bearing animals (those that are ‘more complete’ when\nthey are born) is assumed to apply to animals that lay eggs (that are\n‘less complete’ when born). \nRecall the stunningly accurate discussion of the head and eyes of the\n4th day chick embryo in HA (in section 5.1,\nabove). This is not discussed in GA III 2; however in\nGA II 6, in a long discussion of early organ formation in\nlive-bearing animals, Aristotle has a good deal to say on the\nsubject: \nThe full explanation goes on much longer, but we need not follow it\nout for the purposes of making two important points about the\nrelationship of GA to HA. The first is that the\norganization of GA dictates that for the explanation of facts\nof wide generality such as this one, we must look in book\nII—notice that he claims that this explanation for the large\nsize of eyes early in development and for their subsequent contraction\napplies to all land, air and water animals. The second point to be\nstressed is the relentlessly causal/explanatory focus of the\nGA discussion, a feature (properly) completely absent in the\ncorresponding discussions in HA. As impressive as the\ndescriptive accuracy of the embryological passage cited earlier from\nHA is, we again need to remember what is absent from\nthat discussion. For the equally impressive embryological\ntheory, the reader of Aristotle’s biology must turn to\nthe Generation of Animals. \nThis entry on Aristotle’s biology and its philosophy closes with\na puzzle about the organization of the biological works when compared\nwith the remainder of the corpus. I began by noting that it is a\nfundamental aspect of Aristotle’s theory of science that\ninvestigation proceeds from a stage where one establishes the\nexistence of the things being studied and facts about them to a stage\nwhere the focus is on causal explanations by reference to the natures\nand essences of things. It seems clear that the biological works honor\nthis distinction, and do so self-consciously. Yet Aristotle never\nsuggests, in the Posterior Analytics or anywhere else, that\nthese stages should be represented by distinct treatises\ndevoted to the same subject. Indeed, in no other domain does Aristotle\ndo this: whether we look to meteorology, cosmology, psychology,\nethics, drama or rhetoric, we find single treatises presenting both\nthe facts and their explanation. Nor can this puzzle be easily\ndismissed as an artifact of later editing—as I have pointed out\na number of times, these treatises have a most interesting and\nconsistent pattern of cross-referencing. The treatises that report the\nresults of causal investigations regularly refer to HA (and\nthe dissections) for more detail regarding the facts being explained;\nthe HA, in contrast, never refers to the causal\ntreatises. Moreover, the striking avoidance in the Historia\nAnimalium of all of the concepts associated with\ndefinition and explanation cannot reasonably be laid at the feet of\nsome imagined later editor. We are left, then, to ponder what it was\nabout the investigation of animals that led Aristotle to take a\nmethodological distinction regarding stages of investigation\nand reify it in methodologically distinct treatises devoted to these\ndifferent stages.","contact.mail":"jglennox+@pitt.edu","contact.domain":"pitt.edu"}]
