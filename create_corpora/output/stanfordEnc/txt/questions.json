Scientific\ninvestigation and explanation proceed in part through the posing and\nanswering of questions, and human-computer interaction is often\nstructured in terms of queries and answers.\n\n\nAfter going over some preliminaries we will focus on three lines of\nwork on questions: one located at the intersection of philosophy of\nlanguage and formal semantics, focusing on the semantics of what\nBelnap and Steel (1976) call elementary questions; a second\nlocated at the intersection of philosophy of language and philosophy\nof science, focusing on why-questions and the notion of explanation;\nand a third located at the intersection of philosophy of language and\nepistemology, focusing on embedded or indirect questions.\n\nR.G. Collingwood (1939) was an early advocate of taking questions\nseriously. In the decades since the publication of Collingwood’s\nautobiography the topic of questions has regularly received attention\nfrom linguists, logicians, and philosophers of language, but few have\njoined Collingwood (1939, 36–37) in suggesting that\npropositional logic be replaced by a logic of question and answer in\nwhich neither question nor proposition is more basic. Instead, most\nwork on questions since the Second World War fits squarely within the\nFregean paradigm where propositions, declarative sentences, and\nassertion have primacy. The primacy of the assertoric is evident in\nthe work of many who write on the semantics of what Belnap and Steel\n(1976) call elementary questions and who regard any such question as\nbeing identifiable with a set or function involving the propositions\nthat are the question’s answers. \nFamiliar considerations from the philosophy of language make it clear\nthat one should distinguish interrogative sentences from their\ncontents and distinguish both of these from the speech acts that can\nbe performed via the utterance of interrogative sentences. For\nexample, Belnap and Steel (1976, 3) understand a question to be an\nabstract thing for which an interrogative sentence is a piece of\nnotation. This parallels the distinction between propositions and the\ndeclarative sentences that express them. The structure and composition\nof a question (understood as the abstract content of an interrogative\nsentence) vary from theory to theory. The speech act of asking a\nquestion is standardly regarded, e.g., by Searle (1969, 69), as a\nspecial case of the illocutionary act of requesting. Searle\ndistinguishes requesting information (asking a real question) from\nrequesting that the hearer display knowledge (asking an exam\nquestion). Åqvist (1965) connects questions with speaker\nknowledge rather than hearer knowledge by proposing that to ask a\nquestion is to command the hearer to cause the speaker to know the\nquestion’s answer. \nAs is already clear, an important concept in the theory of questions\nis that of an answer, sometimes called a direct answer.\nTheorists generally agree that an answer is a piece of language or\nsemantic object that, as Belnap and Steel (1976, 3) put it,\n“completely, but just completely, answers the question.” A\nsentence or proposition need not be true to be a direct answer.\nWhether each question can be associated with a definite set of direct\nanswers is a controversial matter, however. Most authors require\nanswers to be sentences or propositions, so that answers to a question\nare the kind of thing that is true or false. Tichy (1978) is a\nstriking exception and argues that answers can be of any logical type.\nConsider this example: \nMost theorists would say that (1a) is the correct answer to (1), that\n(1b) is an answer but not the correct answer, and that (1c–e)\nare not answers to (1) at all. Tichy would say that, among\n(1a–e), only (1c–d) are answers, and (1c) is the correct\nanswer. Braun (2006) would count (1a–b) as answers and include\n(1e) as both an answer and a correct answer. \nA second important basic concept connected with questions is that of a\npresupposition. Belnap and Steel (1976, 5) define a question\nas presupposing a statement if and only if the truth of the statement\nis a logically necessary condition for there being a true (i.e.,\ncorrect) answer to the question. For example, (1a) presupposes the\nfollowing: \nTo deny a presupposition of a question is to give a corrective\nanswer to the question, but most theorists join Belnap and Steel\nin not counting corrective answers as direct answers. \nSeveral kinds of questions have been distinguished in the\nliterature. \nWhether-questions are questions like ‘Was there a\nquorum at the meeting?’ and ‘Does Jones live in Italy, in\nSpain, or in Germany?’. These examples illustrate that\nwhether-questions come in two varieties: a whether-question may be of\nthe yes-or-no variety, or it may present two or more alternative\ndirect answers other than yes and no. In either case, a\nwhether-question explicitly presents a finite number of direct\nanswers. Consider the first example: \nThe answers to (3) are (3a–b), and (3) presupposes that the\nmeeting occurred. Thus (4) is a corrective answer to (3): \nQuestion (5) is ambiguous: \nQuestion (5) can be read as a yes-no question having two direct\nanswers, but it also has a reading on which it presents exactly three\ndirect answers, namely (5a–c). On the latter reading, (5)\npresupposes that Jones lives in Italy, in Spain, or in Germany; thus\n(6) is a corrective answer to (5): \nWhich-questions are questions like ‘What is the\nsmallest prime number greater than 12?’, ‘Which cardinal\nwas elected Pope in 2013?’, and ‘Who shot J.R.?’\nUnlike a whether-question, a which-question may have an indefinite or\ninfinite number of direct answers. \nBelnap and Steel (1976) refer to whether- and which-questions as\nelementary questions. We consider these kinds of questions in\ndetail in section 2. \nAnother major category of questions are why-questions. It has\nlong been recognized that why-questions are intimately linked with the\nconcept of explanation. For example, Hempel and Oppenheim (1948, 334)\nwrite as follows: \nWe consider why-questions in detail in section 3. \nYet another major category of questions are embedded or\nindirect questions, which occur as wh-complements in\ndeclarative sentences: \nThe issue of how to understand embedded questions lies at the\nintersection of the philosophy of language and epistemology and will\nbe treated in section 4. \nThis section provides an overview of some of the most prominent\ntreatments of elementary questions at the intersection of philosophy\nof language and formal semantics. \nA common starting point for many formal semantic treatments of\nquestions is the idea that “questions set up a choice-situation\nbetween a set of propositions, namely those propositions that count as\nanswers to it” (Hamblin 1973, 48). One way to implement this\nidea is to take a question to denote, in a world \\(w\\), the set of\npropositions that correspond to a possible answer to the question\n(Hamblin 1973). Another way to implement the same idea is to let a\nquestion denote, in a world \\(w\\), the set of propositions that\ncorrespond to its true answers in \\(w\\) (Karttunen 1977).\nIn both systems, the meaning of a question is a function from\nworlds to sets of propositions. In Hamblin’s system, this\nfunction maps every possible world to the same set of propositions,\ncorresponding to the set of all possible answers; in Karttunen’s\nsystem, every world is mapped to a subset of all possible answers,\nnamely those that are true in the given world. As acknowledged by\nKarttunen (1977, 10), the difference is inessential. In both cases,\nthe meaning of a question is fully determined by—and could be\nidentified with—the set of all propositions that correspond to a\npossible answer. \nA fundamental problem with these accounts is that they do not specify\nin more detail what “possible answers” are supposed to be.\nOf course, they do provide a compositional semantics for a fragment of\nEnglish, and thereby specify what they take to be the possible answers\nto the questions in that fragment. But in order for these theories to\nbe evaluated, we first need to know what the notion of a\n“possible answer” is intended to capture. To illustrate\nthis point, consider the following example: \nIn principle, all the responses in (8a–d) could be seen as\npossible answers to (8). For Hamblin and Karttunen, only (8a) counts\nas such. However, it is not clear what the precise criteria are for\nbeing considered a possible answer, and on which grounds (8a) is to be\ndistinguished from (8b–d). \nGroenendijk and Stokhof (1984) take a question to denote, in each\nworld, a single proposition embodying the true exhaustive\nanswer to the question in that world. For instance, if \\(w\\) is a\nworld in which Paul and Nina are coming for dinner, and nobody else is\ncoming, then the denotation of (8) in \\(w\\) is the proposition\nexpressed by (8b). \nThe meaning of a question, then, is a function from worlds to\npropositions. These propositions have two special properties: they are\nmutually exclusive (since two different exhaustive answers\nare always incompatible), and together they form a cover of\nthe entire logical space (since every world is compatible with at\nleast one exhaustive answer). So the meaning of a question can be\nidentified with a set of propositions which form a partition\nof the logical space. \nIn many cases, it is intuitively clear what the “true exhaustive\nanswer” to a question in a given world is, at least much clearer\nthan what all the “possible answers” to that question are.\nThis means that a partition semantics can in many cases be tested\nagainst clear intuitions, unlike a Hamblin semantics. \nHowever, in some cases it is not so clear what the “true\nexhaustive answer” to a question in a given world is. Consider\nthe following examples (in (10) we use \\(\\uparrow\\) and \\(\\downarrow\\) to indicate\nrising and falling intonation, respectively): \nWhat is the true exhaustive answer to (9) in a world where Ann is\ncoming and Bill is coming as well? One option is the proposition\n\\(\\{w\\): Ann and Bill are both coming in \\(w\\}\\), but another\noption is the proposition \\(\\{w\\): if Ann is coming in \\(w\\) then\nBill is also coming in \\(w\\}\\). It is not quite clear\npre-theoretically which of these two options is more suitable. Notice\nthat if we pick the second option, then we must assume that the true\nexhaustive answer to (9) in a world where Ann is coming but Bill is\nnot coming is \\(\\{w\\): if Ann is coming in \\(w\\) then Bill is not\ncoming in \\(w\\}\\). And this would mean that these two\n‘exhaustive’ answers actually overlap (they both contain\nall worlds where Ann is not coming) and thus do not form a partition.\nThis may be considered a reason to pick the first option instead.\nHowever, this line of reasoning is purely theory-internal; it seems\nimpossible to decide on theory-external grounds what the true\nexhaustive answers to a conditional question should be taken to be.\n \nConditional questions like (9) also present another challenge for a\npartition semantics, concerning answers that deny the antecedent of\nthe conditional (in this case the answer that Ann is not coming).\nIntuitively, such answers dispel the issue raised by the question, but\ndo not resolve the issue as intended. Their status differs from\nanswers that do resolve the issue as intended (in this case the answer\nthat Bill is coming if Ann is coming, and the answer that Bill is not\ncoming if Ann is coming). In a basic partition semantics it is\nimpossible to capture this. In worlds where Ann is not coming, the\nanswer that Ann is not coming presumably is the true exhaustive\nanswer. Its special status, however, cannot be captured. \nA similar problem arises with alternative questions like (10). In this\ncase, the answer that neither Ann nor Bill is coming and the answer\nthat Ann and Bill are both coming have a different status than the\nanswer that only Ann is coming and the answer that only Bill is\ncoming. Again, this difference in status cannot be captured in a\nsimple partition semantics. \nWe now turn our attention to a line of work that aims to capture the\nsemantics of questions in a dynamic framework. The first\ntheories in this line of work were developed by Jäger (1996),\nHulstijn (1997), and Groenendijk (1999). Aloni et al. (2007b)\ncontains a collection of papers elaborating on these early proposals.\nAll these theories essentially reformulate the partition theory of\nquestions in the format of an update semantics (Veltman 1996). This\nmeans that they explicitly identify meanings with context change\npotentials, i.e., functions over discourse contexts. However,\nunlike a simple update semantics where discourse contexts are modeled\nas sets of worlds—embodying the information established in the\ndiscourse so far—these theories provide a more refined model of\ndiscourse contexts, one that also embodies the issues that have been\nraised so far. More specifically, a discourse context is modeled as an\nequivalence relation \\(R\\) over a set of worlds \\(C\\).\nThe set of worlds \\(C\\), i.e., the domain of \\(R\\), can be\nthought of as the context set, i.e., the set of all worlds\nthat are compatible with the information established in the discourse\nso far. \\(R\\) itself induces a partition on \\(C\\), and can thus\nbe taken to encode the issues that have been raised so far. More\nspecifically, we can think of \\(R\\) as relating two worlds \\(w\\)\nand \\(v\\) just in case the difference between \\(w\\) and \\(v\\)\nis not (yet) at issue, i.e., the discourse participants have not yet\nexpressed an interest in information that would distinguish between\n\\(w\\) and \\(v\\). In other words, \\(R\\) can be conceived of as\na relation encoding indifference (Hulstijn 1997). \nBoth assertions and questions can then be taken to have the potential\nto change the context in which they are uttered. Assertions restrict\nthe context set \\(C\\) to those worlds in which the asserted\nsentence is true (strictly speaking, they remove all pairs of worlds\n\\(\\langle w,v\\rangle\\) from \\(R\\) such that the asserted\nsentence is false in at least one of the two worlds). Questions\ndisconnect worlds, i.e., they remove a pair\n\\(\\langle w,v\\rangle\\) from \\(R\\) just in case the true\nexhaustive answer to the question in \\(w\\) differs from the true\nexhaustive answer to the question in \\(v\\). \nThus, the dynamic framework of Jäger (1996), Hulstijn (1997), and\nGroenendijk (1999) provides a notion of context and meaning that\nembodies both informative and inquisitive content in a uniform way.\nHowever, the framework inherits several issues from the classical\npartition theory of questions, in particular those discussed above\nconcerning conditional and alternative questions. \nMoreover, there is a conceptual issue concerning the equivalence\nrelation \\(R\\). Namely, if \\(R\\) is primarily thought of as a\nrelation encoding indifference, then it is not clear why it\nshould always be an equivalence relation. In particular, it\nis not clear why \\(R\\) should always be transitive. The\ndiscourse participants could very well be interested in information\nthat distinguishes \\(w\\) from \\(v\\), while they are not\ninterested in information that distinguishes either \\(w\\) or\n\\(v\\) from a third world \\(u\\). To model such a situation, we\nwould need an indifference relation \\(R\\) such that\n\\(\\langle w,u\\rangle \\in R\\) and\n\\(\\langle u,v\\rangle \\in R\\) but\n\\(\\langle w,v\\rangle \\not\\in R\\). This is impossible if we\nrequire \\(R\\) to be transitive. \nThese concerns have been addressed by Groenendijk (2009) and\nMascarenhas (2009). The overall architecture of their system is very\nmuch like that of the early dynamic systems discussed above, only\nindifference relations are no longer defined as equivalence relations,\nbut rather as reflexive and symmetric (not necessarily transitive)\nrelations. \nGroenendijk and Mascarenhas argued that this adjustment, besides\naddressing the conceptual issue concerning indifference relations\ndiscussed above, also allows for a better analysis of conditional\nquestions and alternative questions. However, Ciardelli (2009) and\nCiardelli and Roelofsen (2011) show that, although the proposed system\nindeed behaves better for simple cases, it does not scale up to more\ncomplex cases in a suitable way. In particular, whereas alternative\nquestions with two disjuncts, like (10) above, are dealt with\nsatisfactorily, or at least more satisfactorily than in a partition\nsemantics, alternative questions with three or more disjuncts are\nstill problematic. \nThe gist of the problem can be illustrated with a simple example.\nConsider a language with three atomic sentences, \\(p, q\\),\nand \\(r\\), and an information state consisting of three worlds,\n\\(w_{pq}, w_{qr}\\), and\n\\(w_{pr}\\), where the subscripts of each world\nindicate which atomic sentences are true at that world. Note that in\nthis information state none of the atomic sentences is known to hold.\nNow consider an issue which is resolved just in case at least one of\nthe atomic sentences is established, i.e., just in case we know that\nthe actual world is located within one of the ovals depicted in figure\n1. \nFigure 1: An issue that cannot be\nrepresented in the pair-semantics. \nThe problem with the system of Groenendijk (2009) and Mascarenhas\n(2009) is manifested by the fact that this issue cannot be represented\nby means of an indifference relation. An indifference relation over\nthe information state\n\\(\\{w_{pq},w_{qr},w_{pr}\\}\\)\nnecessarily contains all reflexive world-pairs, and possibly one, two,\nor three non-reflexive pairs. In either case, however, the resulting\nissue does not correspond to the one depicted in Figure 1. \nThe general conclusion that has been drawn from this problem, as\ndiscussed in detail by Ciardelli and Roelofsen (2011), is that\nquestion meanings cannot be suitably modeled in terms of indifference\nrelations, even if these indifference relations are allowed to be\nnon-transitive. This insight has led to the development of an\nalternative logical notion of question meanings, which forms the\ncornerstone of the framework of inquisitive semantics, to be\ndiscussed below. \nRecall from section 2.1.1 that a fundamental problem with the\nclassical semantic theories of Hamblin (1973) and Karttunen (1977) is\nthat they do not specify clear criteria for when a response should\ncount as a “possible answer”. Partition semantics\n(Groenendijk and Stokhof 1984) does specify explicitly which responses\nshould count as possible answers, namely only those that are true and\nexhaustive. In many cases, it is clear what the true and exhaustive\nresponses to a given question are. However, this is not always the\ncase, as witnessed by conditional and alternative questions. A natural\nway to proceed, then, is to consider another criterion for what should\ncount as a possible answer. \nOne natural criterion is the following. We could say that a response\nto a question counts as a proper answer just in case it\nresolves the issue that the question raises. If we adopt this\ncriterion then we also have to impose a certain condition on\nquestion-meanings. That is, question-meanings cannot just be defined\nas arbitrary sets of propositions, as in the theories of Hamblin\n(1973) and Karttunen (1977). Rather, they should be defined as\ndownward closed sets of propositions. That is, if a question\nmeaning contains a certain proposition \\(\\alpha\\), then it must also\ncontain all stronger propositions \\(\\beta \\subseteq \\alpha\\). After all,\nsuppose that \\(\\alpha\\) is an element of the meaning of a question\n\\(Q\\). Given our answerhood criterion, this means that \\(\\alpha\\)\ncorresponds to an issue-resolving response to \\(Q\\). But then every\n\\(\\beta \\subseteq \\alpha\\) corresponds to an even more informative, and\ntherefore also issue-resolving response. So, given our answerhood\ncriterion, \\(\\beta\\) must also be an element of the meaning of\n\\(Q\\). \nThis conception of question meanings forms the cornerstone of the most\nbasic implementation of inquisitive semantics, the system\n\\(\\Inq_B\\) (Groenendijk and Roelofsen 2009, Ciardelli 2009, Ciardelli\nand Roelofsen 2011, Roelofsen 2013, Ciardelli et al. 2013,\nCiardelli 2016). In this system, question meanings are defined as\ndownward closed sets of propositions that together cover the entire\nlogical space.[1]\nWe will refer to such sets as inquisitive question\n meanings.[2] \nPartitions correspond to a specific kind of inquisitive question\nmeanings. That is, for every partition \\(\\rP\\), there is a corresponding\ninquisitive question meaning \\(I_{\\rP}\\), consisting\nof all propositions that are contained in one of the blocks in \\(\\rP\\): \n\\(I_{\\rP} : = \\{\\alpha \\subseteq \\beta \\mid \\beta \\in \\rP\\}\\)\n \nHowever, not every inquisitive question meaning corresponds to a\npartition. In fact, an inquisitive question meaning \\(I\\)\ncorresponds to a partition if and only if for every subset\n\\(I'\\subseteq I\\) such that \\(\\cap I'\\ne \\varnothing\\),\n\\(\\cup I'\\) is also in \\(I\\). There are many inquisitive\nquestion meanings that do not have this special property. Thus, the\nnotion of question meanings in \\(\\Inq_B\\)\nis more general than the\nnotion of question meanings in partition semantics. The interested\nreader is referred to Ciardelli et al. (2015) for a\ndiscussion of several systems that fall between \\(\\Inq_B\\)\nand\npartition semantics in terms of expressive power. \nThe set of all meanings in \\(\\Inq_B\\),\ntogether with a suitable\nnotion of entailment, form a Heyting algebra, just like the set of all\nmeanings in classical logic ordered by classical entailment (Roelofsen\n2013). Thus, the basic connectives (disjunction, conjunction,\nimplication, and negation) can be associated with the basic algebraic\noperations on meanings (join, meet, and (relative)\npseudo-complementation), just as in classical logic. This is indeed\nhow the connectives are treated in \\(\\Inq_B\\),\nalthough other treatments\nof the connectives are also conceivable in this setting (see, e.g.,\nCiardelli et al. 2015). \nIn recent work, the basic system sketched above has been extended in\nseveral directions. Below are pointers to some of these\nextensions. \nCiardelli et al. (2012) consider a notion of meaning that is\nvery much like the one adopted in \\(\\Inq_B\\),\nbut also has a\npresuppositional component. Such a notion of meaning is\nneeded to suitably deal with alternative questions and\nwhich-questions. \nCiardelli et al. (2017) develop a type-theoretic inquisitive\nsemantics, which is needed for a compositional semantic analysis of\nquestions. \nRoelofsen and Farkas (2015) develop an inquisitive semantics in which\nthe meaning of a question does not only capture what is needed to\nresolve the issue raised by that question, but also which propositions\nare made available by the question for subsequent anaphoric reference.\nThese propositions may serve as antecedents for polarity particles\n(e.g. Is Paul coming? Yes/No ) and other anaphoric\nexpressions (e.g. Is Paul coming? Then/otherwise I’ll make\npasta ). \nFarkas and Roelofsen (2017) integrate inquisitive semantics with a\ncommitment-based model of discourse, in order to capture the special\ndiscourse effects of non-canonical types of questions, such as\ntag-questions (Paul is coming, isn’t he? ) and\ndeclarative questions (Paul is coming? ). \nFinally, Ciardelli and Roelofsen (2015), Ciardelli (2016), and van\nGessel (2016) develop a system that integrates inquisitive semantics\nwith dynamic epistemic logic (van Ditmarsch et al.\n2007), in order to formally model the information states and\ninquisitive states of the participants of a discourse, and how these\nstates change when a question is asked or a statement is made. It also\nprovides a semantics for question-embedding predicates like\n‘know’ and ‘wonder’ (see also section 4). \nThe theories discussed above all construe question meanings as sets of\npropositions, and are therefore referred to as proposition\nset theories. It has been argued that question meanings as\nconstrued by proposition set theories are all too coarse-grained to\naccount for certain linguistic phenomena. In order to address this\nissue, several theories have been developed that adopt more\nfine-grained, structured notions of question meanings. Such\ntheories have been couched in different semantic frameworks, which are\nall more fine-grained than the standard possible world framework. For\ninstance, the proposal of Krifka (2001) is couched in a structured\nmeanings framework, that of Ginzburg and Sag (2000) in situation\nsemantics, that of Ginzburg (2005), Cooper and Ginzburg (2012) in type\ntheory with records, that of Aloni et al. (2007a) in dynamic\nsemantics, and that of Blutner (2012) in ortho-algebraic semantics. We\nwill illustrate the general approach here by focusing on the proposal\nof Krifka (2001), which in turn has its roots in earlier work of Hull\n(1975), Tichy (1978), Hausser (1978), von Stechow and Zimmermann\n(1984), von Stechow (1991), and Ginzburg (1992). \nThe central idea is that question meanings are pairs\n\\(\\langle B,R\\rangle\\), where \\(B\\) is called the\nbackground and \\(R\\) the restriction. \\(B\\) is\na function that, when applied to the semantic value of an appropriate\nterm answer to the question, yields a proposition. \\(R\\) specifies\nwhat appropriate term answers are, i.e., what the semantic entities\nare that \\(B\\) can be applied to. \nFor instance, the meaning assigned to (11a) is\n (11b):[3] \nIn this case, \\(B\\) is a function that maps every individual\n\\(x\\) to the proposition \\(\\{w: x\\) called in \\(w\\}\\),\nand \\(R\\) is the set of students. In the case of a polar question,\n\\(R\\) is taken to be a set consisting of two functions on\npropositions, the identity function and the function that maps every\nproposition to its complement, which are assumed to be expressed by\nyes and no, respectively. For instance: \nFrom a structured question meaning it is always possible to obtain the\ncorresponding proposition set meaning, by applying \\(B\\) to all the\nelements of \\(R\\) (and taking the downward closure of the resulting\nset of propositions in case we want an inquisitive question meaning in\nthe sense of \\(\\Inq_B\\).\nIt is not possible to go in\nthe other direction, which means that structured question meanings\nhave strictly more expressive power than proposition set meanings\n(e.g., von Stechow 1991, Krifka 2001).  \nThis additional expressive power is needed to account for certain\nphenomena. For instance, the questions in (13) and (14) have exactly\nthe same set of exhaustive/resolving answers, which means that they\nreceive exactly the same semantic value in any of the proposition set\naccounts discussed above. \nYet, the two questions differ in that the first licenses polarity\nparticle responses while the second doesn’t. In a\nstructured-meanings approach, the two questions are semantically\ndistinguishable. This additional semantic fine-grainedness forms the\nbasis for an account of polarity particle responses. \nNote that some of the extended implementations of inquisitive\nsemantics (e.g., Roelofsen and Farkas 2015) are also fine-grained\nenough to account for polarity particle responses. As mentioned above,\nin these implementations the meaning of a question does not only\ncapture what is needed to resolve the issue that the question raises,\nbut also which propositions are made available by the question for\nsubsequent anaphoric reference, for instance by polarity particles. In\neffect, capturing anaphoric potential also adds structure to question\nmeanings. Thus, these implementations maintain a proposition set\nperspective, but at the same time address the need for richer semantic\nstructures as well. Such a synthesis is also achieved in Aloni et\nal. (2007a). \nThe overview provided here of semantic theories of elementary\nquestions is of course not exhaustive. There are a number of excellent\nrecent handbook articles, each focusing on different aspects.\nGroenendijk and Stokhof (1997) provide a thorough review of the\nliterature up to 1997, focusing on the partition theory, but also\nsupplying an in-depth discussion of the epistemic-imperative approach\n(Åqvist 1965, Hintikka 1976, Hintikka 1983) and the treatment of\nquestions in speech act theory (Searle 1969, Vanderveeken 1990). \nGinzburg (2010) provides a concise overview of several more recent\nanalyses of questions, including, besides the ones discussed here, the\ninferential erotetic logic of Wisniewski (2001), the\ntreatment of questions in modal logic by Nelken and Francez (2002) and\nNelken and Shan (2006), the dialogue-based approach of Ginzburg\n(1996), Ginzburg (2012), Roberts (1996), Larsson (2002), among others,\nthe SDRT based approach of Asher and Lascarides (1998), and the\ntreatment of questions in dynamic epistemic logic developed\nby van Benthem and Minică (2012). For comparison of the latter\napproach with inquisitive semantics, see Ciardelli and Roelofsen\n(2015) and Ciardelli (2016). \nFinally, Krifka (2011) provides an overview of the classical\nproposition set accounts, early implementations of inquisitive\nsemantics, and the structured meanings approach, taking a more\nlinguistic perspective than other overview articles. Krifka does not\nonly discuss the semantics of questions, but also their possible\nsyntactic configurations and intonation patterns, supplying examples\nfrom a wide range of languages. \nFor whether-questions (indeed, for all elementary questions in the\nview of some), the question-answer relationship can be defined in\npurely formal terms. One approach to why-questions is to try to make\nthe question-answer relationship formal in that case, too, or at least\nas formal as possible. The main proponent of this approach is\nBromberger (1966), whose account is also the first influential account\nof why-questions. Van Fraassen (1980) takes an opposite view,\ntheorizing that the question-answer relationship is almost purely\npragmatic. We consider both theories in some detail below. \nIf we follow Hempel in regarding an explanation as an answer to a\nwhy-question, Bromberger’s theory of why-questions can be seen\nalso as a theory of explanation, indeed, one that incorporates\nHempel’s deductive-nomological model while aiming to improve on\nit. \nBromberger introduces several concepts for use in his account: the\npresupposition of a why-question, abnormic laws and\ntheir antonymic predicates, and general rules,\nfocusing especially on general rules that are completed by\nabnormic laws. \nBromberger supposes that (15) is the general form of a\nwhy-question: \nThe presupposition of (15) is \\(p\\), and this agrees with the usual\nconcept of presupposition for questions, since if \\(p\\) is not the\ncase then (15) has no correct answer. A general rule is a\n(true or false) law-like statement of the form: \nwhere \\(Fx\\) and \\(Gx\\) may, in the general case, be\nconjunctions. A special abnormic law is a true, law-like\nstatement of the form: \nSpecial abnormic laws satisfy five additional conditions of\nnon-triviality and non-redundancy that we need not get into, and\nBromberger (1966, 98) introduces the more complicated notion of a\ngeneral abnormic law, which we may also ignore for present purposes.\nThe predicate \\(E\\) appearing in a special abnormic law and\n\\(E\\)’s negation are the antonymic predicates of the\nabnormic law. Bromberger (1966, 98) illustrates the concept of an\nabnormic law with the following example: \nThe antonymic predicates of this special abnormic law are\n‘expands’ and ‘does not expand’, and the\nlogical form that Bromberger’s theory postulates for this\nabnormic law is as\n follows:[4] \nBromberger (1966, 99) defines the completion of a general rule by an\nabnormic law as follows: \nAbnormic law (16) is the completion of the (false) general rule\n‘No gas expands’: \nBromberger (1966, 100) goes on to define the correct answer to a why\nquestion as follows: \\(q\\) is the correct answer to (15) if and\nonly if (i) there is an abnormic law \\(L\\) (which may be general or\nspecial) and \\(p\\) is the proposition that results from predicating\nof some individual one of the antonymic predicates of \\(L\\); and\n(ii) \\(q\\) together with \\(L\\) and other premises\n\\(r_1 ,\\ldots ,r_j\\) constitute a\ndeductive-nomological explanation with conclusion \\(p\\); and (iii)\nthere is a false proposition \\(s\\) such that \\(s\\) and \\(p\\)\nare contraries and, were it not for the falsity of \\(s\\) and\n\\(L\\), premises\n\\(r_1 ,\\ldots ,r_j\\) and the\ngeneral rule completed by \\(L\\) would count as a\ndeductive-nomological explanation of \\(s\\); and (iv) the general\nrule completed by \\(L\\) is such that if one of the conjuncts of its\nantecedent is removed, the resulting general rule cannot be completed\nby an abnormic law. \nHere is an illustration of Bromberger’s theory based on abnormic\nlaw (16). Suppose \\(a\\) is a sample of gas that expanded, and\nsuppose its pressure was kept constant but its temperature increased,\ni.e., \\(Ga\\), \\(Ea\\), and \\(Pa\\) are all true. Now consider\nthe question: \nOn Bromberger’s theory, the correct answer is \\(Pa\\), i.e.,\n \nThis is the correct answer because \\(Pa\\), along with \\(Ga\\) and\nabnormic law (16) form the premises of a deductive-nomological\nexplanation with conclusion \\(Ea\\), but when \\(Pa\\) is deleted\nas a premise (leaving \\(Ga\\) as a premise) and general rule (17) is\nsubstituted for abnormic law (16) as a premise, we obtain argument\n(20), which would count as a deductive-nomological explanation of\n\\(\\neg Ea\\), were it not for the fact that (17) and\n\\(\\neg Ea\\) are not true:  \nSo, in this application of Bromberger’s theory, \\(p\\) is\n\\(Ea\\), \\(q\\) is \\(Pa\\), \\(L\\) is (16), the general rule\ncompleted by \\(L\\) is (17), \\(r_1\\) is \\(Ga\\), and\n\\(s\\) is \\(\\neg Ea\\). \nIntuitively, Bromberger’s account makes \\(Pa\\) the correct\nanswer to (18) in virtue of the idea that \\(Pa\\) is a full\nspecification of the special (or “abnormal”) circumstances\ntriggering the expansion of \\(a\\). Notice that one of the premises\nof the deductive-nomological explanation of \\(Ea\\), namely\n\\(Ga\\), is not part of the triggering package and is not part of\nthe correct answer to (18). Two factors in Bromberger’s account\njointly keep \\(Ga\\) from being included. The first is that\n\\(Ga\\) is a premise not only in the actual deductive-nomological\nexplanation of \\(Ea\\) but also in the fictitious\ndeductive-nomological explanation (20) of \\(\\neg Ea\\). So\nrelative to (16) and (17), \\(Ga\\) is not a special or abnormal\ncircumstance. Is there another abnormic law/general rule pair relative\nto which \\(Ga\\) would be included in the correct answer to (18)?\nApparently not, which brings us to the second factor excluding\n\\(Ga\\) from the correct answer to (18): if \\(Gx\\) is dropped\nfrom (17) we obtain the general rule ‘Nothing expands’,\nwhich it seems that no abnormic law\n completes.[5]. \nBromberger’s theory was aimed at saving certain intuitions about\nwhat should and should not count as correct answers to why-questions.\nFor example, consider a straight, 40-foot high utility pole standing\nperpendicular to the ground. A taut 50-foot wire is fastened to the\ntop of the pole and to a point on the ground 30 feet from the base of\nthe pole. Now consider the question: \nand the intuitively incorrect answer  \nBromberger (1966, 105) argues that (22) does not count as a correct\nanswer to (21) on his theory in part because the following is not an\nabnormic law: \nNor would (23) become an abnormic law if additional disjuncts were\nadded after ‘unless’. \nTeller (1974) argues that while (22) may not count as a correct answer\nto (21) on Bromberger’s theory, other answers that are as\nobjectionable as (22) do get counted as correct answers, such as this\n“dispositional” answer to (21): \nTeller (1974, 375) argues that Bromberger’s theory requires that\n(24) count as a correct answer in virtue of the following abnormic\nlaw: \nTeller proposes other counterexamples by devising a method for turning\nexamples showing that Hempel’s deductive-nomological theory of\nexplanation is too permissive into examples showing that\nBromberger’s theory of why-questions is also too permissive.\nTeller’s method exploits the fact that when abnormic laws are\nrewritten in certain logically equivalent ways, the resulting\nstatements must then also count as abnormic laws. \nA second major development in the theory of why-questions is the\naccount of van Fraassen (1980, ch. 5). Van Fraassen’s theory is\nmotivated by the idea that explanation is not a special relationship\nbetween theory and reality. Rather, an explanation is just a\ndescription of reality that serves a contextually determined\npurpose, namely that of answering a why-question. Van Fraassen’s\ntheory is thus an erotetic (i.e., question-theoretic) theory of\nexplanation, as opposed to an account of why-questions in terms of\nexplanation. He offers this theory in the context of developing his\naccount of Constructive Empiricism.  \nFor van Fraassen, a why-question \\(Q\\) can be identified with a\ntriple \\(\\langle P,X,R\\rangle\\), where \\(P\\) is a\ntrue proposition (the topic of the question); \\(X\\) is a\nset of propositions to which \\(P\\) belongs and of which \\(P\\) is\nthe only member that is true (the contrast class of\n\\(Q)\\); and \\(R\\) is a contextually determined relation of\nexplanatory relevance, which holds between a proposition and the\ntopic/contrast-class pair \\(\\langle P,X\\rangle\\). The standard\nlinguistic expression of \\(Q\\) is: \nFor example, consider ‘Why do birds in the northern hemisphere\ngo south for the winter, whereas mammals and reptiles do not?’\nIn this case, \\(P\\) is the proposition that birds in the northern\nhemisphere go south for the winter, and \\(X\\) is the set containing\n\\(P\\) along with the proposition that mammals in the northern\nhemisphere go south for the winter and the proposition that reptiles\nin the northern hemisphere go south for the winter. The contrast class\nparameter allows one to distinguish different why-questions that have\nthe same topic. Thus one can ask why northern hemisphere\nbirds (rather than mammals or reptiles) go south for the\nwinter, and this is different from asking why northern hemisphere\nbirds go south (rather than north or west) for the winter.\nUntil one specifies a contrast class, van Fraassen argues, a\nparticular why-question has not been identified or posed. Like van\nFraassen, Garfinkel (1981) advances a view on which explanatory\ncontrast takes center stage, but we will focus here on the details of\nvan Fraassen’s account. See Temple 1988 for a comparison of van\nFraassen’s and Garfinkel’s respective treatments of\nexplanatory contrast. \nSuppose that\n\\(X=\\{P,P_1 ,\\ldots ,P_k,(\\ldots)\\}\\),\nand that \\(P\\) is not one of the \\(P_k\\)s.\n(Note that \\(X\\) may be finite or infinite.) Then, where \\(A\\)\nis any proposition, van Fraassen (1980, 144) defines a direct answer\nto \\(Q\\) to be any proposition having the following truth\nconditions: \nThe standard wording of a direct answer (28) to \\(Q\\) uses the word\n‘because’ in place of the second ‘and’ in\n(27): \nOn van Fraassen’s view, the contribution of\n‘because’ to the truth conditions of (28) is simply\nboolean conjunction, as reflected in (27). The role of\n‘because’ in (28) is to perform the pragmatic function of\nindicating that (27) is being used for an explanatory purpose, not to\ngive a non-truth-functional dimension to the truth conditions of (28).\nProposition \\(A\\) (the core of answer (27)/(28)) is said to be\nrelevant to \\(Q\\) iff \\(A\\) bears the relevance relation\n\\(R\\) to \\(\\langle P,X\\rangle\\). In general, to ask why is\nto ask for a reason, and \\(R\\) varies according to the kind of\nreason that is being requested in a given context. One can ask why in\norder to request causal factors, to request a justification, to\nrequest a purpose, to request a motive, to request a function, and so\non. \nA why-question, according to van Fraassen (1980, 144–145)\npresupposes (i) that its topic is true, (ii) that, in its contrast\nclass, only its topic is true, and (iii) that at least one proposition\nbearing the explanatory relevance relation to the topic/contrast-class\npair is true. When the first or second presupposition fails (because\nthe contextually determined body of background knowledge in play does\nnot entail both (i) and (ii)), the why-question does not\narise. When the third presupposition fails, the why-question has\nno answer even if it arises. For example, suppose that paresis\nindeterministically strikes some people who have untreated syphilis.\nThen, if ten people have untreated syphilis, and exactly one of them,\nJohn, goes on to contract paresis, there may be no answer to the\nquestion ‘Why did John, in contrast to the other nine, contract\nparesis?’ Since paresis develops indeterministically from\nsyphilis, nothing favors John (in contrast to the other nine syphilis\npatients) as being likely to develop paresis. On the other hand, if\nBill and Sarah never had syphilis, the question ‘Why did John,\nin contrast to Bill and Sarah, develop paresis?’ does have an\nanswer: ‘John developed paresis, in contrast to Bill and Sarah,\nbecause John had syphilis but Bill and Sarah did not.’ In this\ncase, as in the first, the why-question requests causal factors that\nled to John’s getting paresis while the others mentioned in the\ncontrast class did not. In both cases, then, the same relevance\nrelation \\(R\\) is in play because the same kind of information is\nrequested, namely causal factors leading to the truth of the topic in\ncontrast to the other members of the contrast class. If there are no\nsuch causal factors, as in the first version of the paresis case, the\nquestion is to be rejected. If, as in the second version of the\nparesis case, there are such factors, so that at least one proposition\nbears the relevance relation to the topic/contrast-class pair, then a\ncandidate answer \\(A\\) is evaluated according to three criteria:\nhow acceptable or likely \\(A\\) is, the degree to which \\(A\\)\nfavors \\(P\\) over other members of \\(X\\), and whether \\(A\\)\nis made irrelevant by other answers. \nVan Fraassen’s theory of why-questions is intended as a theory\nof explanation, but why-explanation seems not to be the only kind of\nexplanation there is. Cross (1991) argues that answers to\nhow-questions are explanations, too, and, building on van\nFraassen’s theory of why-questions, Cross offers a theory of\nhow-questions that ultimately unifies why- and how-explanation in a\nsingle theory of explanatory questions. \nFirstly, it must be noted that not every how-question requests an\nexplanation. For example, ‘How far is it to Cleveland?’\nasks for a distance, not an explanation. In general, according to\nCross (1991, 248), a how-question is explanation-seeking whenever\n‘how’ can be paraphrased as ‘in what way’. \nSecondly, ways, like reasons, come in a variety of kinds (Cross 1991,\n248–9): \nThirdly, Cross argues that one can see phenomena of explanatory\ncontrast in how-questions in such examples as the following:  \nThe linguistic form (31) of a how-question and its answer (32),\naccording to Cross, are as follows, where, as in van Fraassen’s\ntheory, the contrast class \\(X\\) is a set of propositions\ncontaining \\(P\\):  \nNotice, however, that whereas in (30a) the propositions in \\(X\\)\nother than \\(P\\) are false, in (30b) all three members of \\(X\\)\nare true: birds, mammals, and reptiles reproduce. This, Cross argues,\nreflects the fact that how-questions can exhibit two different kinds\nof explanatory contrast. By asking (30a) one requests an answer that\nhighlights those special qualities of DNA that enable it to replicate\nand that benzene and hexane do not possess. By asking (30b), on the\nother hand, one requests an answer that highlights the differences\nbetween the way in which reptiles reproduce and the ways in which\nmammals and birds reproduce. The latter kind of explanatory contrast\nalso appears to be at play when (30b) is re-worded this way: \nIn view of this, Cross introduces a contextual parameter in his\naccount of how-questions to indicate whether a given how-question\npresupposes that all members of the contrast class are true or whether\nit presupposes that all members of the contrast class other than\n\\(P\\) are false. In the resulting account, a how-question is an\nordered quadruple \\(\\langle P,X,R,n\\rangle\\),\nwhere \\(P\\) is the topic of the question; \\(X\\) is the contrast\nclass, which is a set of propositions to which \\(P\\) belongs;\n\\(R\\) is a contextually determined relation of explanatory\nrelevance, which holds between a proposition and the\ntopic/contrast-class pair \\(\\langle P,X\\rangle\\), and \\(n\\)\nis the contrast value 0 or 1. If \\(n = 0\\), the question\npresupposes that in \\(X\\) only \\(P\\) is true; if \\(n = 1\\),\nthe question presupposes that all of the members of \\(X\\) are true.\nThe explanatory relevance relation \\(R\\) is to be understood as\nvarying from context to context depending on what kind of way is being\nrequested in that context. Finally, Cross (1991, 252) defines a direct\nanswer to a how-question as follows: \nHaving found examples in which how-questions have contrast value 1,\nCross argues that why-questions, too, can presuppose that the other\nmembers of their contrast classes are true. Consider a therapy meeting\nfor alcoholics in which each member of the group is asked the\nfollowing question: \nIn this case it appears that the asker is requesting an answer that\nhighlights factors that distinguish the alcoholism of the person to\nwhom the question is addressed from that of the others in the group.\nThis and other evidence leads Cross to conclude that how- and\nwhy-questions are the same kind of question—both are\nexplanatory questions—and both can be represented as\nhaving the structure \\(\\langle P,X,R,n\\rangle\\).\nIf a proposition \\(A\\) must be a reason for \\(P\\) (in\ncontrast to the rest of \\(X)\\) in order to bear relation \\(R\\)\nto \\(\\langle P,X,n\\rangle\\), then the question is worded\nwith ‘why’ and the answer with ‘because’; if\n\\(A\\) must be a way for \\(P\\) to be the case (in\ncontrast to the rest of \\(X)\\) in order to bear relation \\(R\\)\nto \\(\\langle P,X,n\\rangle\\), then the question is worded\nwith ‘how’ and the answer with ‘by’, ‘in\nthis way’, or similar wording.  \nIt is possible to accept Cross’s theory as a theory of\nhow-questions only and to resist the final move of unifying how- and\nwhy-questions into a single species of question. The unification that\nCross proposes assumes that why-questions can have contrast value 1,\nbut Risjord (2000, 73–4) argues that instead of accepting that\n(35) is a why-question with contrast value 1, one can instead analyze\nit as a why-question with contrast value 0 that makes reference to the\ntopics of other why-questions (also having contrast value 0) that have\nbeen or could be raised in the given context. \nKitcher and Salmon (1987) were early critics of van Fraassen’s\ntheory of why-questions as a theory of explanation. They object (1987,\n319) that the lack of constraints on the relevance relation \\(R\\)\n“allows just about anything to count as the answer to just about\nany [why-]question.” Other critics of van Fraassen’s\ntheory include Ruben (1987) and Temple (1988), who argue that\nexplanatory contrast is an unnecessary complication because any\ncontrastive why-question ‘why \\(P\\) (in contrast to\n\\(Q)\\)?’ is equivalent to the non-contrastive why-question\n‘why P&\\(\\neg\\)Q?’. Risjord (2000, 70) rebuts this\nreduction of the contrastive to the non-contrastive by arguing that it\nleads to the untenable result that whenever \\(P\\) entails both\n\\(\\neg\\)Q and \\(\\neg\\)R, ‘why \\(P\\) (in contrast to\n\\(Q)\\)?’ must then be logically equivalent to ‘why\n\\(P\\) (in contrast to \\(R)\\)?’, since\n\\(P \\amp \\neg Q\\) is logically equivalent to\n\\(P \\amp \\neg R\\) if \\(P\\) entails \\(\\neg Q\\) and\n\\(\\neg R\\). But questions of these forms need not be equivalent,\nsince they may call for different answers. For example, if Art is a\nvegan and is allergic to chocolate, a correct answer to ‘Why did\nArt eat fruit for dessert (rather than eating ice cream and skipping\nthe fruit)?’ will cite his being a vegan and not his chocolate\nallergy, whereas a correct answer to ‘Why did Art eat fruit for\ndessert (rather than eating chocolate and skipping the fruit)?’\nwill cite his chocolate allergy but not his being a vegan. \nWhere van Fraassen’s theory places few restrictions on the\ncontrast class or foils of a why-question, some authors have\nargued that the set of possible foils is constrained in various ways.\nOne example is Sober (1986), who contends that the presuppositions of\n‘Why \\(P\\) rather than \\(Q\\)?’ include a two-part\ncommon cause presupposition, namely that (1) the truth of \\(P\\) and\nthe falsity of \\(Q\\) trace back to a common cause, and (2) the\ncommon cause discriminates \\(P\\) from \\(Q\\) in the sense that it\nmakes \\(P\\) more likely than \\(Q\\). Both presuppositions fail\nfor Sober’s (1986, 145) example of the unanswerable question,\n‘Why is Kodaly a Hungarian rather than a vegetarian?’\nAnother author who argues for additional constraints on foils is\nLipton (1990), who aims in part to improve on Lewis’s (1986)\naccount of causal explanation. Lipton contends that a causal answer to\n‘Why \\(P\\) rather than \\(Q\\)?’ must cite a cause of\n\\(P\\) and the absence of a corresponding event in the history of\n\\(\\neg Q\\), i.e., a causal difference between \\(P\\) and\n\\(\\neg Q\\). Lipton (1990, 256) calls this The Difference Condition.\nThe central requirement for a sensible contrastive question is that\nfact and (negated) foil have a similar causal history against which\nthe differences stand out (Lipton 1990, 258). According to Barnes\n(1994), Lipton is correct that fact and (negated) foil must have a\nsimilar causal history, but Barnes goes further and claims that a\nwhy-question presupposes that the fact and foil can be viewed as\nculminating outcomes of some single type of natural causal process\n(Barnes 1994, 50). \nIn recent years the topic of why-questions has been somewhat neglected\nby philosophers, at least compared to other topics in the theory of\nquestions. One notable exception to this is Hintikka and Halonen 1995,\nwhich develops a theory of why-questions in the context of\nHintikka’s interrogative model of inquiry. Another notable\ndevelopment is Skow 2016, which begins with two key ideas: first, that\na theory of explanation ought to be a theory of answers to\nwhy-questions, and, second, that a theory of answers to why-questions\nis a theory of reasons-why. Skow goes on to defend the view that\nreasons-why are causes or grounds, and he argues that reasons-why come\nin levels. For example, at one level there are reasons why \\(P\\),\nand at a different level there are reasons why \\(Q\\) is a reason\nwhy \\(P\\). \nInterrogative expressions can be embedded (as wh-complements or\nindirect questions) into attitude contexts to form sentences that are\ndeclarative, as when someone is said to know, tell, care, or wonder\nwho, what, whether, how, or why. Where the attitude in question is\nknowledge, these sorts of examples are called knowledge-wh.\nKnowledge-how in the sense of skill-possession, as in ‘Smith\nknows how to ride a bicycle’, has generated a literature of its\nown and is treated elsewhere (see the entry on\n knowledge how).\n  \nThe discussion of knowledge-wh has focused mostly on whether-, what-,\nwhich-, and who-complements, as in these examples: \nGroenendijk and Stokhof (1982) provide a rich source of examples of\nintuitively valid and invalid inferences involving wh-complements,\nsuch as the following intuitively valid inference (179): \nKnowledge-wh figures explicitly in the imperative-epistemic theory\nof wh-questions developed by Åqvist (1965). The\nimperative-epistemic account is further developed by Hintikka (1975,\n1976) and has been influential among philosophers of science\ninterested in models of inquiry and discovery, such as Kleiner\n(1993). \nAccording to the imperative-epistemic account, to ask a question is to\nissue an imperative requiring the addressee to bring it about that the\nspeaker knows the answer to the question. Knowledge-wh comes into it\nbecause to know the answer is to be in a state that can be described\nusing a knowledge-wh sentence. For example, according to the\nimperative-epistemic account, question (41) is to be understood as\nimperative (42): \nand question (43) is to be understood as imperative (44): \nIs a wh-complement occurring in a longer sentence a meaningful unit?\nIf so, what does it denote? Several early approaches to wh-complements\ncan be organized around answers to these questions. \nAssuming that wh-complements are meaningful units of the sentences in\nwhich they occur, one option (Groenendijk and Stokhof 1982) is to take\nwh-complements to denote individual propositions. A second option\n(Karttunen 1977) is to take wh-complements to denote sets of\npropositions. In either case, John’s knowing who walks consists\nin the obtaining of a relation between John and the denotation of the\nexpression ‘who walks’. On the view that wh-complements\ndenote individual propositions, wh-complements and that-complements\nare treated uniformly, and Groenendijk and Stokhof (1982) contend that\nthis uniform treatment is a virtue of their theory. Lewis (1982)\nfavors the same sort of account, but Lewis applies it only to\nwhether-complements. \nKarttunen, a proponent of the second option, takes wh-complements to\ndenote sets of true propositions, so that ‘what John\nreads’ denotes (Karttunen 1977, 20) “a set which contains,\nfor each thing that John reads, the proposition that he reads\nit.” On Groenendijk and Stokhof’s account, by contrast,\n‘what John reads’ denotes the proposition that is true in\na possible world if and only if the set of things that John reads in\nthat world equals the set of things John in fact reads. That is,\n‘what John reads’ denotes a proposition that entails for\neach thing John reads that he reads it and for each thing John does\nnot read that he does not read it. Thus if one knows what John reads,\nit follows on Groenendijk and Stokhof’s account (but not on\nKarttunen’s) that one knows what John does not read. Also, on\nGroenendijk and Stokhof’s account, the difference between\nknowing-that and knowing-wh amounts to a difference in what we might\ncall the rigidity of the complement. Consider the claim that\nI know that John reads Moby Dick and the claim that I know\nwhat John reads. The term ‘that John reads Moby Dick\n’ refers to the same proposition at every possible world; the\nterm ‘what John reads’ refers to different propositions at\nworlds at which John reads different things (and refers to the\nproposition that John reads Moby Dick at those worlds at\nwhich Moby Dick is the one and only thing that John reads).\n \nIf wh-complements are not meaningful units of the sentences in which\nthey occur, one option is to interpret wh-complements\n“contextually”, as Russell interpreted definite\ndescriptions. Indeed, Hintikka (1976, Chapter 4) argues that\nknowledge-wh sentences like (37)-(39) are ambiguous between two\nreadings: a universal reading and an existential reading. In the case\nof (37), Hintikka’s two readings are as follows:  \nKarttunen (1977, 7) disputes the existence of Hintikka’s\nambiguity.  \nBraun (2006) offers a very different account of knowledge-wh on which\nthe question-answer relationship underlying knowledge-wh is much less\nformal, and this makes it very easy to have knowledge-wh on\nBraun’s account. \nConsider this example: \nExamples like (46) are identity questions, which seem\nintuitively to call for a dimension of context-dependence that\nstandard theories of the question-answer relationship do not\naccommodate. The idea is that different ways of identifying Hong Oak\nYun are relevant in different contexts; accordingly, different\npropositions count as answers (or as correct answers) to (46) in\ndifferent contexts. Aloni (2005) provides a recent example of a theory\ndesigned to accommodate this intuition. Braun (2006) rejects the\nintuition entirely.  \nAccording to Braun’s (2006, 26) information provision\naccount of questions, “to answer a question is simply to provide\ninformation about the subject matter of the question.” That is,\n(46) is answered by any proposition that provides information about\nHong Oak Yun, even the proposition expressed by ‘Hong Oak Yun is\na person who is over three inches tall’. This answer may not\nsatisfy or be useful to or be informative for the speaker who poses\n(46), but it counts as an answer despite these purely pragmatic\nfailings, according to Braun’s theory. To know who Hong Oak\nYun is, according to Braun, is simply to know the truth of a\nproposition that answers (46), which is to say, to know the truth of\nany proposition that provides information about Hong Oak Yun.\nBraun’s view contrasts with the contextualism of Boër and\nLycan (1986) according to which knowing who Hong Oak Yun is requires\nknowing a proposition that provides contextually relevant information\nabout Hong Oak Yun. Another contextualist alternative to Braun’s\nview is the view of Masto (2010), according to which (46) denotes a\ncontextually determined set of possible answers, and knowing who Hong\nOak Yun is consists in being able to choose or recognize the correct\nanswer from that contextually determined set. \nWhere Boër and Lycan view knowing-wh as context-relative,\nSchaffer (2007) views it as question-relative. The problem, according\nto Schaffer, is that if knowledge-wh is reduced to knowledge-that and\nis not question-relative, then cases of knowledge-wh that should be\ndistinguished will not be distinguished. Schaffer calls this the\nProblem of Convergent Knowledge. For example, suppose that (47) is\ntrue: \nOn a non-question-relative account of knowledge-wh that reduces\nknowledge-wh to knowledge-that, all three of the following will be\nequivalent because all three can be reduced to (47):  \nSchaffer argues that sentences like (48a–c) are not equivalent.\nAccording to Schaffer’s account, assuming the cat is indeed on\nthe mat, to know where the cat is is to know that the cat is on the\nmat relative to the question ‘Where is the cat?’, whereas\nto know what is on the mat is to know that the cat is on the mat\nrelative to the question ‘What is on the mat?’. Schaffer\nargues, in the end, that all knowledge, including knowledge-that, is\nquestion-relative. Aloni and Égré (2010) offer a\ndifferent take on Schaffer’s Problem of Convergent Knowledge,\narguing that it reveals a pragmatic ambiguity concerning what it means\nto know the answer to a wh-question.  \nBrogaard (2009) rejects both reductionist views (which, like\nHintikka’s, reduce knowledge-wh to knowledge-that) and\nanti-reductionist views (which, like Schaffer’s, analyze\nknowledge-wh as question-relative knowledge-that), arguing instead\nthat wh-complements are predicates and knowledge-wh is a special kind\nof de re knowledge. For example, on Brogaard’s view, the logical\nform of (48c) is: \nKnowledge-wh is only one of a broader category of attitudes\ncorresponding to what Lahiri (2002) calls responsive\npredicates. It is characteristic of responsive predicates that\nthey can accept both interrogative and declarative complements, as in\n‘Mary knows/remembers/forgets who runs’ and ‘Mary\nknows/remembers/forgets that John runs’. Responsive predicates\ncontrast with what Lahiri (2002) calls rogative predicates,\nsuch as ‘wonder’, ‘be curious’, and\n‘inquire’. Rogative predicates can accept interrogative\ncomplements but cannot accept declarative complements. For example,\none can inquire who ate the last doughnut, but one cannot inquire that\nJohn ate the last doughnut. The distinction between rogative and\nresponsive predicates turns out to have epistemological as well as\nsemantic significance, as it underlies Friedman’s (2013)\nargument that there is a category of attitudes that have\nquestions, not propositions, as their contents. Friedman\ncalls these the interrogative attitudes, and they are\nprecisely the attitudes denoted by rogative predicates.  \nWithin the category of responsive predicates Lahiri (2002, 287)\ndistinguishes the veridical from the non-veridical.\nVeridical-responsive predicates include ‘know’,\n‘remember’, and ‘forget’;\nnon-veridical-responsive predicates include ‘be certain’,\n‘agree (about)’, and ‘conjecture (about)’.\nWhereas a veridical-responsive predicate expresses a relation to the\ncorrect answer to its interrogative complement, a\nnon-veridical-responsive predicate expresses a relation to a possible\n(but not necessarily the correct) answer. For example, ‘Jane\nremembers who won the lottery’ entails that Jane has knowledge\nthat correctly answers the question ‘Who won the\nlottery?’, whereas ‘Jane is certain about who won the\nlottery’ entails that Jane is certain of the truth of a\nproposition that may or may not correctly answer that same question.\nOther classifications of question-embedding verbs exist and are\nsurveyed by Lahiri (2002, 284–291).  \nFor a detailed critique of the recent literature on knowledge-wh, see\nChapter 2 of Stanley 2011. Parent (2014) provides a survey of the\nrecent literature about knowledge-wh organized around three issues:\nthe reducibility of knowledge-wh to knowledge-that, the relativity of\nknowledge-wh to a contrast proposition, and the issue of whether the\ncontext-sensitivity of knowing-wh is to be understood as a semantic or\na pragmatic phenomenon. The Uegaki manuscript listed below under Other\nInternet Resources provides an overview of recent work on the\nsemantics of responsive predicates generally and is organized around\nfour approaches: the reduction of questions to propositions, the\nreduction of propositions to questions, the uniformity approach (on\nwhich declarative and interrogative complements of a responsive\npredicate are of the same semantic type), and the ambiguity approach\n(which postulates distinct proposition-taking and question-taking\nreadings of a given responsive predicate).

Scientific\ninvestigation and explanation proceed in part through the posing and\nanswering of questions, and human-computer interaction is often\nstructured in terms of queries and answers.\n\n\nAfter going over some preliminaries we will focus on three lines of\nwork on questions: one located at the intersection of philosophy of\nlanguage and formal semantics, focusing on the semantics of what\nBelnap and Steel (1976) call elementary questions; a second\nlocated at the intersection of philosophy of language and philosophy\nof science, focusing on why-questions and the notion of explanation;\nand a third located at the intersection of philosophy of language and\nepistemology, focusing on embedded or indirect questions.\n\nR.G. Collingwood (1939) was an early advocate of taking questions\nseriously. In the decades since the publication of Collingwood’s\nautobiography the topic of questions has regularly received attention\nfrom linguists, logicians, and philosophers of language, but few have\njoined Collingwood (1939, 36–37) in suggesting that\npropositional logic be replaced by a logic of question and answer in\nwhich neither question nor proposition is more basic. Instead, most\nwork on questions since the Second World War fits squarely within the\nFregean paradigm where propositions, declarative sentences, and\nassertion have primacy. The primacy of the assertoric is evident in\nthe work of many who write on the semantics of what Belnap and Steel\n(1976) call elementary questions and who regard any such question as\nbeing identifiable with a set or function involving the propositions\nthat are the question’s answers. \nFamiliar considerations from the philosophy of language make it clear\nthat one should distinguish interrogative sentences from their\ncontents and distinguish both of these from the speech acts that can\nbe performed via the utterance of interrogative sentences. For\nexample, Belnap and Steel (1976, 3) understand a question to be an\nabstract thing for which an interrogative sentence is a piece of\nnotation. This parallels the distinction between propositions and the\ndeclarative sentences that express them. The structure and composition\nof a question (understood as the abstract content of an interrogative\nsentence) vary from theory to theory. The speech act of asking a\nquestion is standardly regarded, e.g., by Searle (1969, 69), as a\nspecial case of the illocutionary act of requesting. Searle\ndistinguishes requesting information (asking a real question) from\nrequesting that the hearer display knowledge (asking an exam\nquestion). Åqvist (1965) connects questions with speaker\nknowledge rather than hearer knowledge by proposing that to ask a\nquestion is to command the hearer to cause the speaker to know the\nquestion’s answer. \nAs is already clear, an important concept in the theory of questions\nis that of an answer, sometimes called a direct answer.\nTheorists generally agree that an answer is a piece of language or\nsemantic object that, as Belnap and Steel (1976, 3) put it,\n“completely, but just completely, answers the question.” A\nsentence or proposition need not be true to be a direct answer.\nWhether each question can be associated with a definite set of direct\nanswers is a controversial matter, however. Most authors require\nanswers to be sentences or propositions, so that answers to a question\nare the kind of thing that is true or false. Tichy (1978) is a\nstriking exception and argues that answers can be of any logical type.\nConsider this example: \nMost theorists would say that (1a) is the correct answer to (1), that\n(1b) is an answer but not the correct answer, and that (1c–e)\nare not answers to (1) at all. Tichy would say that, among\n(1a–e), only (1c–d) are answers, and (1c) is the correct\nanswer. Braun (2006) would count (1a–b) as answers and include\n(1e) as both an answer and a correct answer. \nA second important basic concept connected with questions is that of a\npresupposition. Belnap and Steel (1976, 5) define a question\nas presupposing a statement if and only if the truth of the statement\nis a logically necessary condition for there being a true (i.e.,\ncorrect) answer to the question. For example, (1a) presupposes the\nfollowing: \nTo deny a presupposition of a question is to give a corrective\nanswer to the question, but most theorists join Belnap and Steel\nin not counting corrective answers as direct answers. \nSeveral kinds of questions have been distinguished in the\nliterature. \nWhether-questions are questions like ‘Was there a\nquorum at the meeting?’ and ‘Does Jones live in Italy, in\nSpain, or in Germany?’. These examples illustrate that\nwhether-questions come in two varieties: a whether-question may be of\nthe yes-or-no variety, or it may present two or more alternative\ndirect answers other than yes and no. In either case, a\nwhether-question explicitly presents a finite number of direct\nanswers. Consider the first example: \nThe answers to (3) are (3a–b), and (3) presupposes that the\nmeeting occurred. Thus (4) is a corrective answer to (3): \nQuestion (5) is ambiguous: \nQuestion (5) can be read as a yes-no question having two direct\nanswers, but it also has a reading on which it presents exactly three\ndirect answers, namely (5a–c). On the latter reading, (5)\npresupposes that Jones lives in Italy, in Spain, or in Germany; thus\n(6) is a corrective answer to (5): \nWhich-questions are questions like ‘What is the\nsmallest prime number greater than 12?’, ‘Which cardinal\nwas elected Pope in 2013?’, and ‘Who shot J.R.?’\nUnlike a whether-question, a which-question may have an indefinite or\ninfinite number of direct answers. \nBelnap and Steel (1976) refer to whether- and which-questions as\nelementary questions. We consider these kinds of questions in\ndetail in section 2. \nAnother major category of questions are why-questions. It has\nlong been recognized that why-questions are intimately linked with the\nconcept of explanation. For example, Hempel and Oppenheim (1948, 334)\nwrite as follows: \nWe consider why-questions in detail in section 3. \nYet another major category of questions are embedded or\nindirect questions, which occur as wh-complements in\ndeclarative sentences: \nThe issue of how to understand embedded questions lies at the\nintersection of the philosophy of language and epistemology and will\nbe treated in section 4. \nThis section provides an overview of some of the most prominent\ntreatments of elementary questions at the intersection of philosophy\nof language and formal semantics. \nA common starting point for many formal semantic treatments of\nquestions is the idea that “questions set up a choice-situation\nbetween a set of propositions, namely those propositions that count as\nanswers to it” (Hamblin 1973, 48). One way to implement this\nidea is to take a question to denote, in a world \\(w\\), the set of\npropositions that correspond to a possible answer to the question\n(Hamblin 1973). Another way to implement the same idea is to let a\nquestion denote, in a world \\(w\\), the set of propositions that\ncorrespond to its true answers in \\(w\\) (Karttunen 1977).\nIn both systems, the meaning of a question is a function from\nworlds to sets of propositions. In Hamblin’s system, this\nfunction maps every possible world to the same set of propositions,\ncorresponding to the set of all possible answers; in Karttunen’s\nsystem, every world is mapped to a subset of all possible answers,\nnamely those that are true in the given world. As acknowledged by\nKarttunen (1977, 10), the difference is inessential. In both cases,\nthe meaning of a question is fully determined by—and could be\nidentified with—the set of all propositions that correspond to a\npossible answer. \nA fundamental problem with these accounts is that they do not specify\nin more detail what “possible answers” are supposed to be.\nOf course, they do provide a compositional semantics for a fragment of\nEnglish, and thereby specify what they take to be the possible answers\nto the questions in that fragment. But in order for these theories to\nbe evaluated, we first need to know what the notion of a\n“possible answer” is intended to capture. To illustrate\nthis point, consider the following example: \nIn principle, all the responses in (8a–d) could be seen as\npossible answers to (8). For Hamblin and Karttunen, only (8a) counts\nas such. However, it is not clear what the precise criteria are for\nbeing considered a possible answer, and on which grounds (8a) is to be\ndistinguished from (8b–d). \nGroenendijk and Stokhof (1984) take a question to denote, in each\nworld, a single proposition embodying the true exhaustive\nanswer to the question in that world. For instance, if \\(w\\) is a\nworld in which Paul and Nina are coming for dinner, and nobody else is\ncoming, then the denotation of (8) in \\(w\\) is the proposition\nexpressed by (8b). \nThe meaning of a question, then, is a function from worlds to\npropositions. These propositions have two special properties: they are\nmutually exclusive (since two different exhaustive answers\nare always incompatible), and together they form a cover of\nthe entire logical space (since every world is compatible with at\nleast one exhaustive answer). So the meaning of a question can be\nidentified with a set of propositions which form a partition\nof the logical space. \nIn many cases, it is intuitively clear what the “true exhaustive\nanswer” to a question in a given world is, at least much clearer\nthan what all the “possible answers” to that question are.\nThis means that a partition semantics can in many cases be tested\nagainst clear intuitions, unlike a Hamblin semantics. \nHowever, in some cases it is not so clear what the “true\nexhaustive answer” to a question in a given world is. Consider\nthe following examples (in (10) we use \\(\\uparrow\\) and \\(\\downarrow\\) to indicate\nrising and falling intonation, respectively): \nWhat is the true exhaustive answer to (9) in a world where Ann is\ncoming and Bill is coming as well? One option is the proposition\n\\(\\{w\\): Ann and Bill are both coming in \\(w\\}\\), but another\noption is the proposition \\(\\{w\\): if Ann is coming in \\(w\\) then\nBill is also coming in \\(w\\}\\). It is not quite clear\npre-theoretically which of these two options is more suitable. Notice\nthat if we pick the second option, then we must assume that the true\nexhaustive answer to (9) in a world where Ann is coming but Bill is\nnot coming is \\(\\{w\\): if Ann is coming in \\(w\\) then Bill is not\ncoming in \\(w\\}\\). And this would mean that these two\n‘exhaustive’ answers actually overlap (they both contain\nall worlds where Ann is not coming) and thus do not form a partition.\nThis may be considered a reason to pick the first option instead.\nHowever, this line of reasoning is purely theory-internal; it seems\nimpossible to decide on theory-external grounds what the true\nexhaustive answers to a conditional question should be taken to be.\n \nConditional questions like (9) also present another challenge for a\npartition semantics, concerning answers that deny the antecedent of\nthe conditional (in this case the answer that Ann is not coming).\nIntuitively, such answers dispel the issue raised by the question, but\ndo not resolve the issue as intended. Their status differs from\nanswers that do resolve the issue as intended (in this case the answer\nthat Bill is coming if Ann is coming, and the answer that Bill is not\ncoming if Ann is coming). In a basic partition semantics it is\nimpossible to capture this. In worlds where Ann is not coming, the\nanswer that Ann is not coming presumably is the true exhaustive\nanswer. Its special status, however, cannot be captured. \nA similar problem arises with alternative questions like (10). In this\ncase, the answer that neither Ann nor Bill is coming and the answer\nthat Ann and Bill are both coming have a different status than the\nanswer that only Ann is coming and the answer that only Bill is\ncoming. Again, this difference in status cannot be captured in a\nsimple partition semantics. \nWe now turn our attention to a line of work that aims to capture the\nsemantics of questions in a dynamic framework. The first\ntheories in this line of work were developed by Jäger (1996),\nHulstijn (1997), and Groenendijk (1999). Aloni et al. (2007b)\ncontains a collection of papers elaborating on these early proposals.\nAll these theories essentially reformulate the partition theory of\nquestions in the format of an update semantics (Veltman 1996). This\nmeans that they explicitly identify meanings with context change\npotentials, i.e., functions over discourse contexts. However,\nunlike a simple update semantics where discourse contexts are modeled\nas sets of worlds—embodying the information established in the\ndiscourse so far—these theories provide a more refined model of\ndiscourse contexts, one that also embodies the issues that have been\nraised so far. More specifically, a discourse context is modeled as an\nequivalence relation \\(R\\) over a set of worlds \\(C\\).\nThe set of worlds \\(C\\), i.e., the domain of \\(R\\), can be\nthought of as the context set, i.e., the set of all worlds\nthat are compatible with the information established in the discourse\nso far. \\(R\\) itself induces a partition on \\(C\\), and can thus\nbe taken to encode the issues that have been raised so far. More\nspecifically, we can think of \\(R\\) as relating two worlds \\(w\\)\nand \\(v\\) just in case the difference between \\(w\\) and \\(v\\)\nis not (yet) at issue, i.e., the discourse participants have not yet\nexpressed an interest in information that would distinguish between\n\\(w\\) and \\(v\\). In other words, \\(R\\) can be conceived of as\na relation encoding indifference (Hulstijn 1997). \nBoth assertions and questions can then be taken to have the potential\nto change the context in which they are uttered. Assertions restrict\nthe context set \\(C\\) to those worlds in which the asserted\nsentence is true (strictly speaking, they remove all pairs of worlds\n\\(\\langle w,v\\rangle\\) from \\(R\\) such that the asserted\nsentence is false in at least one of the two worlds). Questions\ndisconnect worlds, i.e., they remove a pair\n\\(\\langle w,v\\rangle\\) from \\(R\\) just in case the true\nexhaustive answer to the question in \\(w\\) differs from the true\nexhaustive answer to the question in \\(v\\). \nThus, the dynamic framework of Jäger (1996), Hulstijn (1997), and\nGroenendijk (1999) provides a notion of context and meaning that\nembodies both informative and inquisitive content in a uniform way.\nHowever, the framework inherits several issues from the classical\npartition theory of questions, in particular those discussed above\nconcerning conditional and alternative questions. \nMoreover, there is a conceptual issue concerning the equivalence\nrelation \\(R\\). Namely, if \\(R\\) is primarily thought of as a\nrelation encoding indifference, then it is not clear why it\nshould always be an equivalence relation. In particular, it\nis not clear why \\(R\\) should always be transitive. The\ndiscourse participants could very well be interested in information\nthat distinguishes \\(w\\) from \\(v\\), while they are not\ninterested in information that distinguishes either \\(w\\) or\n\\(v\\) from a third world \\(u\\). To model such a situation, we\nwould need an indifference relation \\(R\\) such that\n\\(\\langle w,u\\rangle \\in R\\) and\n\\(\\langle u,v\\rangle \\in R\\) but\n\\(\\langle w,v\\rangle \\not\\in R\\). This is impossible if we\nrequire \\(R\\) to be transitive. \nThese concerns have been addressed by Groenendijk (2009) and\nMascarenhas (2009). The overall architecture of their system is very\nmuch like that of the early dynamic systems discussed above, only\nindifference relations are no longer defined as equivalence relations,\nbut rather as reflexive and symmetric (not necessarily transitive)\nrelations. \nGroenendijk and Mascarenhas argued that this adjustment, besides\naddressing the conceptual issue concerning indifference relations\ndiscussed above, also allows for a better analysis of conditional\nquestions and alternative questions. However, Ciardelli (2009) and\nCiardelli and Roelofsen (2011) show that, although the proposed system\nindeed behaves better for simple cases, it does not scale up to more\ncomplex cases in a suitable way. In particular, whereas alternative\nquestions with two disjuncts, like (10) above, are dealt with\nsatisfactorily, or at least more satisfactorily than in a partition\nsemantics, alternative questions with three or more disjuncts are\nstill problematic. \nThe gist of the problem can be illustrated with a simple example.\nConsider a language with three atomic sentences, \\(p, q\\),\nand \\(r\\), and an information state consisting of three worlds,\n\\(w_{pq}, w_{qr}\\), and\n\\(w_{pr}\\), where the subscripts of each world\nindicate which atomic sentences are true at that world. Note that in\nthis information state none of the atomic sentences is known to hold.\nNow consider an issue which is resolved just in case at least one of\nthe atomic sentences is established, i.e., just in case we know that\nthe actual world is located within one of the ovals depicted in figure\n1. \nFigure 1: An issue that cannot be\nrepresented in the pair-semantics. \nThe problem with the system of Groenendijk (2009) and Mascarenhas\n(2009) is manifested by the fact that this issue cannot be represented\nby means of an indifference relation. An indifference relation over\nthe information state\n\\(\\{w_{pq},w_{qr},w_{pr}\\}\\)\nnecessarily contains all reflexive world-pairs, and possibly one, two,\nor three non-reflexive pairs. In either case, however, the resulting\nissue does not correspond to the one depicted in Figure 1. \nThe general conclusion that has been drawn from this problem, as\ndiscussed in detail by Ciardelli and Roelofsen (2011), is that\nquestion meanings cannot be suitably modeled in terms of indifference\nrelations, even if these indifference relations are allowed to be\nnon-transitive. This insight has led to the development of an\nalternative logical notion of question meanings, which forms the\ncornerstone of the framework of inquisitive semantics, to be\ndiscussed below. \nRecall from section 2.1.1 that a fundamental problem with the\nclassical semantic theories of Hamblin (1973) and Karttunen (1977) is\nthat they do not specify clear criteria for when a response should\ncount as a “possible answer”. Partition semantics\n(Groenendijk and Stokhof 1984) does specify explicitly which responses\nshould count as possible answers, namely only those that are true and\nexhaustive. In many cases, it is clear what the true and exhaustive\nresponses to a given question are. However, this is not always the\ncase, as witnessed by conditional and alternative questions. A natural\nway to proceed, then, is to consider another criterion for what should\ncount as a possible answer. \nOne natural criterion is the following. We could say that a response\nto a question counts as a proper answer just in case it\nresolves the issue that the question raises. If we adopt this\ncriterion then we also have to impose a certain condition on\nquestion-meanings. That is, question-meanings cannot just be defined\nas arbitrary sets of propositions, as in the theories of Hamblin\n(1973) and Karttunen (1977). Rather, they should be defined as\ndownward closed sets of propositions. That is, if a question\nmeaning contains a certain proposition \\(\\alpha\\), then it must also\ncontain all stronger propositions \\(\\beta \\subseteq \\alpha\\). After all,\nsuppose that \\(\\alpha\\) is an element of the meaning of a question\n\\(Q\\). Given our answerhood criterion, this means that \\(\\alpha\\)\ncorresponds to an issue-resolving response to \\(Q\\). But then every\n\\(\\beta \\subseteq \\alpha\\) corresponds to an even more informative, and\ntherefore also issue-resolving response. So, given our answerhood\ncriterion, \\(\\beta\\) must also be an element of the meaning of\n\\(Q\\). \nThis conception of question meanings forms the cornerstone of the most\nbasic implementation of inquisitive semantics, the system\n\\(\\Inq_B\\) (Groenendijk and Roelofsen 2009, Ciardelli 2009, Ciardelli\nand Roelofsen 2011, Roelofsen 2013, Ciardelli et al. 2013,\nCiardelli 2016). In this system, question meanings are defined as\ndownward closed sets of propositions that together cover the entire\nlogical space.[1]\nWe will refer to such sets as inquisitive question\n meanings.[2] \nPartitions correspond to a specific kind of inquisitive question\nmeanings. That is, for every partition \\(\\rP\\), there is a corresponding\ninquisitive question meaning \\(I_{\\rP}\\), consisting\nof all propositions that are contained in one of the blocks in \\(\\rP\\): \n\\(I_{\\rP} : = \\{\\alpha \\subseteq \\beta \\mid \\beta \\in \\rP\\}\\)\n \nHowever, not every inquisitive question meaning corresponds to a\npartition. In fact, an inquisitive question meaning \\(I\\)\ncorresponds to a partition if and only if for every subset\n\\(I'\\subseteq I\\) such that \\(\\cap I'\\ne \\varnothing\\),\n\\(\\cup I'\\) is also in \\(I\\). There are many inquisitive\nquestion meanings that do not have this special property. Thus, the\nnotion of question meanings in \\(\\Inq_B\\)\nis more general than the\nnotion of question meanings in partition semantics. The interested\nreader is referred to Ciardelli et al. (2015) for a\ndiscussion of several systems that fall between \\(\\Inq_B\\)\nand\npartition semantics in terms of expressive power. \nThe set of all meanings in \\(\\Inq_B\\),\ntogether with a suitable\nnotion of entailment, form a Heyting algebra, just like the set of all\nmeanings in classical logic ordered by classical entailment (Roelofsen\n2013). Thus, the basic connectives (disjunction, conjunction,\nimplication, and negation) can be associated with the basic algebraic\noperations on meanings (join, meet, and (relative)\npseudo-complementation), just as in classical logic. This is indeed\nhow the connectives are treated in \\(\\Inq_B\\),\nalthough other treatments\nof the connectives are also conceivable in this setting (see, e.g.,\nCiardelli et al. 2015). \nIn recent work, the basic system sketched above has been extended in\nseveral directions. Below are pointers to some of these\nextensions. \nCiardelli et al. (2012) consider a notion of meaning that is\nvery much like the one adopted in \\(\\Inq_B\\),\nbut also has a\npresuppositional component. Such a notion of meaning is\nneeded to suitably deal with alternative questions and\nwhich-questions. \nCiardelli et al. (2017) develop a type-theoretic inquisitive\nsemantics, which is needed for a compositional semantic analysis of\nquestions. \nRoelofsen and Farkas (2015) develop an inquisitive semantics in which\nthe meaning of a question does not only capture what is needed to\nresolve the issue raised by that question, but also which propositions\nare made available by the question for subsequent anaphoric reference.\nThese propositions may serve as antecedents for polarity particles\n(e.g. Is Paul coming? Yes/No ) and other anaphoric\nexpressions (e.g. Is Paul coming? Then/otherwise I’ll make\npasta ). \nFarkas and Roelofsen (2017) integrate inquisitive semantics with a\ncommitment-based model of discourse, in order to capture the special\ndiscourse effects of non-canonical types of questions, such as\ntag-questions (Paul is coming, isn’t he? ) and\ndeclarative questions (Paul is coming? ). \nFinally, Ciardelli and Roelofsen (2015), Ciardelli (2016), and van\nGessel (2016) develop a system that integrates inquisitive semantics\nwith dynamic epistemic logic (van Ditmarsch et al.\n2007), in order to formally model the information states and\ninquisitive states of the participants of a discourse, and how these\nstates change when a question is asked or a statement is made. It also\nprovides a semantics for question-embedding predicates like\n‘know’ and ‘wonder’ (see also section 4). \nThe theories discussed above all construe question meanings as sets of\npropositions, and are therefore referred to as proposition\nset theories. It has been argued that question meanings as\nconstrued by proposition set theories are all too coarse-grained to\naccount for certain linguistic phenomena. In order to address this\nissue, several theories have been developed that adopt more\nfine-grained, structured notions of question meanings. Such\ntheories have been couched in different semantic frameworks, which are\nall more fine-grained than the standard possible world framework. For\ninstance, the proposal of Krifka (2001) is couched in a structured\nmeanings framework, that of Ginzburg and Sag (2000) in situation\nsemantics, that of Ginzburg (2005), Cooper and Ginzburg (2012) in type\ntheory with records, that of Aloni et al. (2007a) in dynamic\nsemantics, and that of Blutner (2012) in ortho-algebraic semantics. We\nwill illustrate the general approach here by focusing on the proposal\nof Krifka (2001), which in turn has its roots in earlier work of Hull\n(1975), Tichy (1978), Hausser (1978), von Stechow and Zimmermann\n(1984), von Stechow (1991), and Ginzburg (1992). \nThe central idea is that question meanings are pairs\n\\(\\langle B,R\\rangle\\), where \\(B\\) is called the\nbackground and \\(R\\) the restriction. \\(B\\) is\na function that, when applied to the semantic value of an appropriate\nterm answer to the question, yields a proposition. \\(R\\) specifies\nwhat appropriate term answers are, i.e., what the semantic entities\nare that \\(B\\) can be applied to. \nFor instance, the meaning assigned to (11a) is\n (11b):[3] \nIn this case, \\(B\\) is a function that maps every individual\n\\(x\\) to the proposition \\(\\{w: x\\) called in \\(w\\}\\),\nand \\(R\\) is the set of students. In the case of a polar question,\n\\(R\\) is taken to be a set consisting of two functions on\npropositions, the identity function and the function that maps every\nproposition to its complement, which are assumed to be expressed by\nyes and no, respectively. For instance: \nFrom a structured question meaning it is always possible to obtain the\ncorresponding proposition set meaning, by applying \\(B\\) to all the\nelements of \\(R\\) (and taking the downward closure of the resulting\nset of propositions in case we want an inquisitive question meaning in\nthe sense of \\(\\Inq_B\\).\nIt is not possible to go in\nthe other direction, which means that structured question meanings\nhave strictly more expressive power than proposition set meanings\n(e.g., von Stechow 1991, Krifka 2001).  \nThis additional expressive power is needed to account for certain\nphenomena. For instance, the questions in (13) and (14) have exactly\nthe same set of exhaustive/resolving answers, which means that they\nreceive exactly the same semantic value in any of the proposition set\naccounts discussed above. \nYet, the two questions differ in that the first licenses polarity\nparticle responses while the second doesn’t. In a\nstructured-meanings approach, the two questions are semantically\ndistinguishable. This additional semantic fine-grainedness forms the\nbasis for an account of polarity particle responses. \nNote that some of the extended implementations of inquisitive\nsemantics (e.g., Roelofsen and Farkas 2015) are also fine-grained\nenough to account for polarity particle responses. As mentioned above,\nin these implementations the meaning of a question does not only\ncapture what is needed to resolve the issue that the question raises,\nbut also which propositions are made available by the question for\nsubsequent anaphoric reference, for instance by polarity particles. In\neffect, capturing anaphoric potential also adds structure to question\nmeanings. Thus, these implementations maintain a proposition set\nperspective, but at the same time address the need for richer semantic\nstructures as well. Such a synthesis is also achieved in Aloni et\nal. (2007a). \nThe overview provided here of semantic theories of elementary\nquestions is of course not exhaustive. There are a number of excellent\nrecent handbook articles, each focusing on different aspects.\nGroenendijk and Stokhof (1997) provide a thorough review of the\nliterature up to 1997, focusing on the partition theory, but also\nsupplying an in-depth discussion of the epistemic-imperative approach\n(Åqvist 1965, Hintikka 1976, Hintikka 1983) and the treatment of\nquestions in speech act theory (Searle 1969, Vanderveeken 1990). \nGinzburg (2010) provides a concise overview of several more recent\nanalyses of questions, including, besides the ones discussed here, the\ninferential erotetic logic of Wisniewski (2001), the\ntreatment of questions in modal logic by Nelken and Francez (2002) and\nNelken and Shan (2006), the dialogue-based approach of Ginzburg\n(1996), Ginzburg (2012), Roberts (1996), Larsson (2002), among others,\nthe SDRT based approach of Asher and Lascarides (1998), and the\ntreatment of questions in dynamic epistemic logic developed\nby van Benthem and Minică (2012). For comparison of the latter\napproach with inquisitive semantics, see Ciardelli and Roelofsen\n(2015) and Ciardelli (2016). \nFinally, Krifka (2011) provides an overview of the classical\nproposition set accounts, early implementations of inquisitive\nsemantics, and the structured meanings approach, taking a more\nlinguistic perspective than other overview articles. Krifka does not\nonly discuss the semantics of questions, but also their possible\nsyntactic configurations and intonation patterns, supplying examples\nfrom a wide range of languages. \nFor whether-questions (indeed, for all elementary questions in the\nview of some), the question-answer relationship can be defined in\npurely formal terms. One approach to why-questions is to try to make\nthe question-answer relationship formal in that case, too, or at least\nas formal as possible. The main proponent of this approach is\nBromberger (1966), whose account is also the first influential account\nof why-questions. Van Fraassen (1980) takes an opposite view,\ntheorizing that the question-answer relationship is almost purely\npragmatic. We consider both theories in some detail below. \nIf we follow Hempel in regarding an explanation as an answer to a\nwhy-question, Bromberger’s theory of why-questions can be seen\nalso as a theory of explanation, indeed, one that incorporates\nHempel’s deductive-nomological model while aiming to improve on\nit. \nBromberger introduces several concepts for use in his account: the\npresupposition of a why-question, abnormic laws and\ntheir antonymic predicates, and general rules,\nfocusing especially on general rules that are completed by\nabnormic laws. \nBromberger supposes that (15) is the general form of a\nwhy-question: \nThe presupposition of (15) is \\(p\\), and this agrees with the usual\nconcept of presupposition for questions, since if \\(p\\) is not the\ncase then (15) has no correct answer. A general rule is a\n(true or false) law-like statement of the form: \nwhere \\(Fx\\) and \\(Gx\\) may, in the general case, be\nconjunctions. A special abnormic law is a true, law-like\nstatement of the form: \nSpecial abnormic laws satisfy five additional conditions of\nnon-triviality and non-redundancy that we need not get into, and\nBromberger (1966, 98) introduces the more complicated notion of a\ngeneral abnormic law, which we may also ignore for present purposes.\nThe predicate \\(E\\) appearing in a special abnormic law and\n\\(E\\)’s negation are the antonymic predicates of the\nabnormic law. Bromberger (1966, 98) illustrates the concept of an\nabnormic law with the following example: \nThe antonymic predicates of this special abnormic law are\n‘expands’ and ‘does not expand’, and the\nlogical form that Bromberger’s theory postulates for this\nabnormic law is as\n follows:[4] \nBromberger (1966, 99) defines the completion of a general rule by an\nabnormic law as follows: \nAbnormic law (16) is the completion of the (false) general rule\n‘No gas expands’: \nBromberger (1966, 100) goes on to define the correct answer to a why\nquestion as follows: \\(q\\) is the correct answer to (15) if and\nonly if (i) there is an abnormic law \\(L\\) (which may be general or\nspecial) and \\(p\\) is the proposition that results from predicating\nof some individual one of the antonymic predicates of \\(L\\); and\n(ii) \\(q\\) together with \\(L\\) and other premises\n\\(r_1 ,\\ldots ,r_j\\) constitute a\ndeductive-nomological explanation with conclusion \\(p\\); and (iii)\nthere is a false proposition \\(s\\) such that \\(s\\) and \\(p\\)\nare contraries and, were it not for the falsity of \\(s\\) and\n\\(L\\), premises\n\\(r_1 ,\\ldots ,r_j\\) and the\ngeneral rule completed by \\(L\\) would count as a\ndeductive-nomological explanation of \\(s\\); and (iv) the general\nrule completed by \\(L\\) is such that if one of the conjuncts of its\nantecedent is removed, the resulting general rule cannot be completed\nby an abnormic law. \nHere is an illustration of Bromberger’s theory based on abnormic\nlaw (16). Suppose \\(a\\) is a sample of gas that expanded, and\nsuppose its pressure was kept constant but its temperature increased,\ni.e., \\(Ga\\), \\(Ea\\), and \\(Pa\\) are all true. Now consider\nthe question: \nOn Bromberger’s theory, the correct answer is \\(Pa\\), i.e.,\n \nThis is the correct answer because \\(Pa\\), along with \\(Ga\\) and\nabnormic law (16) form the premises of a deductive-nomological\nexplanation with conclusion \\(Ea\\), but when \\(Pa\\) is deleted\nas a premise (leaving \\(Ga\\) as a premise) and general rule (17) is\nsubstituted for abnormic law (16) as a premise, we obtain argument\n(20), which would count as a deductive-nomological explanation of\n\\(\\neg Ea\\), were it not for the fact that (17) and\n\\(\\neg Ea\\) are not true:  \nSo, in this application of Bromberger’s theory, \\(p\\) is\n\\(Ea\\), \\(q\\) is \\(Pa\\), \\(L\\) is (16), the general rule\ncompleted by \\(L\\) is (17), \\(r_1\\) is \\(Ga\\), and\n\\(s\\) is \\(\\neg Ea\\). \nIntuitively, Bromberger’s account makes \\(Pa\\) the correct\nanswer to (18) in virtue of the idea that \\(Pa\\) is a full\nspecification of the special (or “abnormal”) circumstances\ntriggering the expansion of \\(a\\). Notice that one of the premises\nof the deductive-nomological explanation of \\(Ea\\), namely\n\\(Ga\\), is not part of the triggering package and is not part of\nthe correct answer to (18). Two factors in Bromberger’s account\njointly keep \\(Ga\\) from being included. The first is that\n\\(Ga\\) is a premise not only in the actual deductive-nomological\nexplanation of \\(Ea\\) but also in the fictitious\ndeductive-nomological explanation (20) of \\(\\neg Ea\\). So\nrelative to (16) and (17), \\(Ga\\) is not a special or abnormal\ncircumstance. Is there another abnormic law/general rule pair relative\nto which \\(Ga\\) would be included in the correct answer to (18)?\nApparently not, which brings us to the second factor excluding\n\\(Ga\\) from the correct answer to (18): if \\(Gx\\) is dropped\nfrom (17) we obtain the general rule ‘Nothing expands’,\nwhich it seems that no abnormic law\n completes.[5]. \nBromberger’s theory was aimed at saving certain intuitions about\nwhat should and should not count as correct answers to why-questions.\nFor example, consider a straight, 40-foot high utility pole standing\nperpendicular to the ground. A taut 50-foot wire is fastened to the\ntop of the pole and to a point on the ground 30 feet from the base of\nthe pole. Now consider the question: \nand the intuitively incorrect answer  \nBromberger (1966, 105) argues that (22) does not count as a correct\nanswer to (21) on his theory in part because the following is not an\nabnormic law: \nNor would (23) become an abnormic law if additional disjuncts were\nadded after ‘unless’. \nTeller (1974) argues that while (22) may not count as a correct answer\nto (21) on Bromberger’s theory, other answers that are as\nobjectionable as (22) do get counted as correct answers, such as this\n“dispositional” answer to (21): \nTeller (1974, 375) argues that Bromberger’s theory requires that\n(24) count as a correct answer in virtue of the following abnormic\nlaw: \nTeller proposes other counterexamples by devising a method for turning\nexamples showing that Hempel’s deductive-nomological theory of\nexplanation is too permissive into examples showing that\nBromberger’s theory of why-questions is also too permissive.\nTeller’s method exploits the fact that when abnormic laws are\nrewritten in certain logically equivalent ways, the resulting\nstatements must then also count as abnormic laws. \nA second major development in the theory of why-questions is the\naccount of van Fraassen (1980, ch. 5). Van Fraassen’s theory is\nmotivated by the idea that explanation is not a special relationship\nbetween theory and reality. Rather, an explanation is just a\ndescription of reality that serves a contextually determined\npurpose, namely that of answering a why-question. Van Fraassen’s\ntheory is thus an erotetic (i.e., question-theoretic) theory of\nexplanation, as opposed to an account of why-questions in terms of\nexplanation. He offers this theory in the context of developing his\naccount of Constructive Empiricism.  \nFor van Fraassen, a why-question \\(Q\\) can be identified with a\ntriple \\(\\langle P,X,R\\rangle\\), where \\(P\\) is a\ntrue proposition (the topic of the question); \\(X\\) is a\nset of propositions to which \\(P\\) belongs and of which \\(P\\) is\nthe only member that is true (the contrast class of\n\\(Q)\\); and \\(R\\) is a contextually determined relation of\nexplanatory relevance, which holds between a proposition and the\ntopic/contrast-class pair \\(\\langle P,X\\rangle\\). The standard\nlinguistic expression of \\(Q\\) is: \nFor example, consider ‘Why do birds in the northern hemisphere\ngo south for the winter, whereas mammals and reptiles do not?’\nIn this case, \\(P\\) is the proposition that birds in the northern\nhemisphere go south for the winter, and \\(X\\) is the set containing\n\\(P\\) along with the proposition that mammals in the northern\nhemisphere go south for the winter and the proposition that reptiles\nin the northern hemisphere go south for the winter. The contrast class\nparameter allows one to distinguish different why-questions that have\nthe same topic. Thus one can ask why northern hemisphere\nbirds (rather than mammals or reptiles) go south for the\nwinter, and this is different from asking why northern hemisphere\nbirds go south (rather than north or west) for the winter.\nUntil one specifies a contrast class, van Fraassen argues, a\nparticular why-question has not been identified or posed. Like van\nFraassen, Garfinkel (1981) advances a view on which explanatory\ncontrast takes center stage, but we will focus here on the details of\nvan Fraassen’s account. See Temple 1988 for a comparison of van\nFraassen’s and Garfinkel’s respective treatments of\nexplanatory contrast. \nSuppose that\n\\(X=\\{P,P_1 ,\\ldots ,P_k,(\\ldots)\\}\\),\nand that \\(P\\) is not one of the \\(P_k\\)s.\n(Note that \\(X\\) may be finite or infinite.) Then, where \\(A\\)\nis any proposition, van Fraassen (1980, 144) defines a direct answer\nto \\(Q\\) to be any proposition having the following truth\nconditions: \nThe standard wording of a direct answer (28) to \\(Q\\) uses the word\n‘because’ in place of the second ‘and’ in\n(27): \nOn van Fraassen’s view, the contribution of\n‘because’ to the truth conditions of (28) is simply\nboolean conjunction, as reflected in (27). The role of\n‘because’ in (28) is to perform the pragmatic function of\nindicating that (27) is being used for an explanatory purpose, not to\ngive a non-truth-functional dimension to the truth conditions of (28).\nProposition \\(A\\) (the core of answer (27)/(28)) is said to be\nrelevant to \\(Q\\) iff \\(A\\) bears the relevance relation\n\\(R\\) to \\(\\langle P,X\\rangle\\). In general, to ask why is\nto ask for a reason, and \\(R\\) varies according to the kind of\nreason that is being requested in a given context. One can ask why in\norder to request causal factors, to request a justification, to\nrequest a purpose, to request a motive, to request a function, and so\non. \nA why-question, according to van Fraassen (1980, 144–145)\npresupposes (i) that its topic is true, (ii) that, in its contrast\nclass, only its topic is true, and (iii) that at least one proposition\nbearing the explanatory relevance relation to the topic/contrast-class\npair is true. When the first or second presupposition fails (because\nthe contextually determined body of background knowledge in play does\nnot entail both (i) and (ii)), the why-question does not\narise. When the third presupposition fails, the why-question has\nno answer even if it arises. For example, suppose that paresis\nindeterministically strikes some people who have untreated syphilis.\nThen, if ten people have untreated syphilis, and exactly one of them,\nJohn, goes on to contract paresis, there may be no answer to the\nquestion ‘Why did John, in contrast to the other nine, contract\nparesis?’ Since paresis develops indeterministically from\nsyphilis, nothing favors John (in contrast to the other nine syphilis\npatients) as being likely to develop paresis. On the other hand, if\nBill and Sarah never had syphilis, the question ‘Why did John,\nin contrast to Bill and Sarah, develop paresis?’ does have an\nanswer: ‘John developed paresis, in contrast to Bill and Sarah,\nbecause John had syphilis but Bill and Sarah did not.’ In this\ncase, as in the first, the why-question requests causal factors that\nled to John’s getting paresis while the others mentioned in the\ncontrast class did not. In both cases, then, the same relevance\nrelation \\(R\\) is in play because the same kind of information is\nrequested, namely causal factors leading to the truth of the topic in\ncontrast to the other members of the contrast class. If there are no\nsuch causal factors, as in the first version of the paresis case, the\nquestion is to be rejected. If, as in the second version of the\nparesis case, there are such factors, so that at least one proposition\nbears the relevance relation to the topic/contrast-class pair, then a\ncandidate answer \\(A\\) is evaluated according to three criteria:\nhow acceptable or likely \\(A\\) is, the degree to which \\(A\\)\nfavors \\(P\\) over other members of \\(X\\), and whether \\(A\\)\nis made irrelevant by other answers. \nVan Fraassen’s theory of why-questions is intended as a theory\nof explanation, but why-explanation seems not to be the only kind of\nexplanation there is. Cross (1991) argues that answers to\nhow-questions are explanations, too, and, building on van\nFraassen’s theory of why-questions, Cross offers a theory of\nhow-questions that ultimately unifies why- and how-explanation in a\nsingle theory of explanatory questions. \nFirstly, it must be noted that not every how-question requests an\nexplanation. For example, ‘How far is it to Cleveland?’\nasks for a distance, not an explanation. In general, according to\nCross (1991, 248), a how-question is explanation-seeking whenever\n‘how’ can be paraphrased as ‘in what way’. \nSecondly, ways, like reasons, come in a variety of kinds (Cross 1991,\n248–9): \nThirdly, Cross argues that one can see phenomena of explanatory\ncontrast in how-questions in such examples as the following:  \nThe linguistic form (31) of a how-question and its answer (32),\naccording to Cross, are as follows, where, as in van Fraassen’s\ntheory, the contrast class \\(X\\) is a set of propositions\ncontaining \\(P\\):  \nNotice, however, that whereas in (30a) the propositions in \\(X\\)\nother than \\(P\\) are false, in (30b) all three members of \\(X\\)\nare true: birds, mammals, and reptiles reproduce. This, Cross argues,\nreflects the fact that how-questions can exhibit two different kinds\nof explanatory contrast. By asking (30a) one requests an answer that\nhighlights those special qualities of DNA that enable it to replicate\nand that benzene and hexane do not possess. By asking (30b), on the\nother hand, one requests an answer that highlights the differences\nbetween the way in which reptiles reproduce and the ways in which\nmammals and birds reproduce. The latter kind of explanatory contrast\nalso appears to be at play when (30b) is re-worded this way: \nIn view of this, Cross introduces a contextual parameter in his\naccount of how-questions to indicate whether a given how-question\npresupposes that all members of the contrast class are true or whether\nit presupposes that all members of the contrast class other than\n\\(P\\) are false. In the resulting account, a how-question is an\nordered quadruple \\(\\langle P,X,R,n\\rangle\\),\nwhere \\(P\\) is the topic of the question; \\(X\\) is the contrast\nclass, which is a set of propositions to which \\(P\\) belongs;\n\\(R\\) is a contextually determined relation of explanatory\nrelevance, which holds between a proposition and the\ntopic/contrast-class pair \\(\\langle P,X\\rangle\\), and \\(n\\)\nis the contrast value 0 or 1. If \\(n = 0\\), the question\npresupposes that in \\(X\\) only \\(P\\) is true; if \\(n = 1\\),\nthe question presupposes that all of the members of \\(X\\) are true.\nThe explanatory relevance relation \\(R\\) is to be understood as\nvarying from context to context depending on what kind of way is being\nrequested in that context. Finally, Cross (1991, 252) defines a direct\nanswer to a how-question as follows: \nHaving found examples in which how-questions have contrast value 1,\nCross argues that why-questions, too, can presuppose that the other\nmembers of their contrast classes are true. Consider a therapy meeting\nfor alcoholics in which each member of the group is asked the\nfollowing question: \nIn this case it appears that the asker is requesting an answer that\nhighlights factors that distinguish the alcoholism of the person to\nwhom the question is addressed from that of the others in the group.\nThis and other evidence leads Cross to conclude that how- and\nwhy-questions are the same kind of question—both are\nexplanatory questions—and both can be represented as\nhaving the structure \\(\\langle P,X,R,n\\rangle\\).\nIf a proposition \\(A\\) must be a reason for \\(P\\) (in\ncontrast to the rest of \\(X)\\) in order to bear relation \\(R\\)\nto \\(\\langle P,X,n\\rangle\\), then the question is worded\nwith ‘why’ and the answer with ‘because’; if\n\\(A\\) must be a way for \\(P\\) to be the case (in\ncontrast to the rest of \\(X)\\) in order to bear relation \\(R\\)\nto \\(\\langle P,X,n\\rangle\\), then the question is worded\nwith ‘how’ and the answer with ‘by’, ‘in\nthis way’, or similar wording.  \nIt is possible to accept Cross’s theory as a theory of\nhow-questions only and to resist the final move of unifying how- and\nwhy-questions into a single species of question. The unification that\nCross proposes assumes that why-questions can have contrast value 1,\nbut Risjord (2000, 73–4) argues that instead of accepting that\n(35) is a why-question with contrast value 1, one can instead analyze\nit as a why-question with contrast value 0 that makes reference to the\ntopics of other why-questions (also having contrast value 0) that have\nbeen or could be raised in the given context. \nKitcher and Salmon (1987) were early critics of van Fraassen’s\ntheory of why-questions as a theory of explanation. They object (1987,\n319) that the lack of constraints on the relevance relation \\(R\\)\n“allows just about anything to count as the answer to just about\nany [why-]question.” Other critics of van Fraassen’s\ntheory include Ruben (1987) and Temple (1988), who argue that\nexplanatory contrast is an unnecessary complication because any\ncontrastive why-question ‘why \\(P\\) (in contrast to\n\\(Q)\\)?’ is equivalent to the non-contrastive why-question\n‘why P&\\(\\neg\\)Q?’. Risjord (2000, 70) rebuts this\nreduction of the contrastive to the non-contrastive by arguing that it\nleads to the untenable result that whenever \\(P\\) entails both\n\\(\\neg\\)Q and \\(\\neg\\)R, ‘why \\(P\\) (in contrast to\n\\(Q)\\)?’ must then be logically equivalent to ‘why\n\\(P\\) (in contrast to \\(R)\\)?’, since\n\\(P \\amp \\neg Q\\) is logically equivalent to\n\\(P \\amp \\neg R\\) if \\(P\\) entails \\(\\neg Q\\) and\n\\(\\neg R\\). But questions of these forms need not be equivalent,\nsince they may call for different answers. For example, if Art is a\nvegan and is allergic to chocolate, a correct answer to ‘Why did\nArt eat fruit for dessert (rather than eating ice cream and skipping\nthe fruit)?’ will cite his being a vegan and not his chocolate\nallergy, whereas a correct answer to ‘Why did Art eat fruit for\ndessert (rather than eating chocolate and skipping the fruit)?’\nwill cite his chocolate allergy but not his being a vegan. \nWhere van Fraassen’s theory places few restrictions on the\ncontrast class or foils of a why-question, some authors have\nargued that the set of possible foils is constrained in various ways.\nOne example is Sober (1986), who contends that the presuppositions of\n‘Why \\(P\\) rather than \\(Q\\)?’ include a two-part\ncommon cause presupposition, namely that (1) the truth of \\(P\\) and\nthe falsity of \\(Q\\) trace back to a common cause, and (2) the\ncommon cause discriminates \\(P\\) from \\(Q\\) in the sense that it\nmakes \\(P\\) more likely than \\(Q\\). Both presuppositions fail\nfor Sober’s (1986, 145) example of the unanswerable question,\n‘Why is Kodaly a Hungarian rather than a vegetarian?’\nAnother author who argues for additional constraints on foils is\nLipton (1990), who aims in part to improve on Lewis’s (1986)\naccount of causal explanation. Lipton contends that a causal answer to\n‘Why \\(P\\) rather than \\(Q\\)?’ must cite a cause of\n\\(P\\) and the absence of a corresponding event in the history of\n\\(\\neg Q\\), i.e., a causal difference between \\(P\\) and\n\\(\\neg Q\\). Lipton (1990, 256) calls this The Difference Condition.\nThe central requirement for a sensible contrastive question is that\nfact and (negated) foil have a similar causal history against which\nthe differences stand out (Lipton 1990, 258). According to Barnes\n(1994), Lipton is correct that fact and (negated) foil must have a\nsimilar causal history, but Barnes goes further and claims that a\nwhy-question presupposes that the fact and foil can be viewed as\nculminating outcomes of some single type of natural causal process\n(Barnes 1994, 50). \nIn recent years the topic of why-questions has been somewhat neglected\nby philosophers, at least compared to other topics in the theory of\nquestions. One notable exception to this is Hintikka and Halonen 1995,\nwhich develops a theory of why-questions in the context of\nHintikka’s interrogative model of inquiry. Another notable\ndevelopment is Skow 2016, which begins with two key ideas: first, that\na theory of explanation ought to be a theory of answers to\nwhy-questions, and, second, that a theory of answers to why-questions\nis a theory of reasons-why. Skow goes on to defend the view that\nreasons-why are causes or grounds, and he argues that reasons-why come\nin levels. For example, at one level there are reasons why \\(P\\),\nand at a different level there are reasons why \\(Q\\) is a reason\nwhy \\(P\\). \nInterrogative expressions can be embedded (as wh-complements or\nindirect questions) into attitude contexts to form sentences that are\ndeclarative, as when someone is said to know, tell, care, or wonder\nwho, what, whether, how, or why. Where the attitude in question is\nknowledge, these sorts of examples are called knowledge-wh.\nKnowledge-how in the sense of skill-possession, as in ‘Smith\nknows how to ride a bicycle’, has generated a literature of its\nown and is treated elsewhere (see the entry on\n knowledge how).\n  \nThe discussion of knowledge-wh has focused mostly on whether-, what-,\nwhich-, and who-complements, as in these examples: \nGroenendijk and Stokhof (1982) provide a rich source of examples of\nintuitively valid and invalid inferences involving wh-complements,\nsuch as the following intuitively valid inference (179): \nKnowledge-wh figures explicitly in the imperative-epistemic theory\nof wh-questions developed by Åqvist (1965). The\nimperative-epistemic account is further developed by Hintikka (1975,\n1976) and has been influential among philosophers of science\ninterested in models of inquiry and discovery, such as Kleiner\n(1993). \nAccording to the imperative-epistemic account, to ask a question is to\nissue an imperative requiring the addressee to bring it about that the\nspeaker knows the answer to the question. Knowledge-wh comes into it\nbecause to know the answer is to be in a state that can be described\nusing a knowledge-wh sentence. For example, according to the\nimperative-epistemic account, question (41) is to be understood as\nimperative (42): \nand question (43) is to be understood as imperative (44): \nIs a wh-complement occurring in a longer sentence a meaningful unit?\nIf so, what does it denote? Several early approaches to wh-complements\ncan be organized around answers to these questions. \nAssuming that wh-complements are meaningful units of the sentences in\nwhich they occur, one option (Groenendijk and Stokhof 1982) is to take\nwh-complements to denote individual propositions. A second option\n(Karttunen 1977) is to take wh-complements to denote sets of\npropositions. In either case, John’s knowing who walks consists\nin the obtaining of a relation between John and the denotation of the\nexpression ‘who walks’. On the view that wh-complements\ndenote individual propositions, wh-complements and that-complements\nare treated uniformly, and Groenendijk and Stokhof (1982) contend that\nthis uniform treatment is a virtue of their theory. Lewis (1982)\nfavors the same sort of account, but Lewis applies it only to\nwhether-complements. \nKarttunen, a proponent of the second option, takes wh-complements to\ndenote sets of true propositions, so that ‘what John\nreads’ denotes (Karttunen 1977, 20) “a set which contains,\nfor each thing that John reads, the proposition that he reads\nit.” On Groenendijk and Stokhof’s account, by contrast,\n‘what John reads’ denotes the proposition that is true in\na possible world if and only if the set of things that John reads in\nthat world equals the set of things John in fact reads. That is,\n‘what John reads’ denotes a proposition that entails for\neach thing John reads that he reads it and for each thing John does\nnot read that he does not read it. Thus if one knows what John reads,\nit follows on Groenendijk and Stokhof’s account (but not on\nKarttunen’s) that one knows what John does not read. Also, on\nGroenendijk and Stokhof’s account, the difference between\nknowing-that and knowing-wh amounts to a difference in what we might\ncall the rigidity of the complement. Consider the claim that\nI know that John reads Moby Dick and the claim that I know\nwhat John reads. The term ‘that John reads Moby Dick\n’ refers to the same proposition at every possible world; the\nterm ‘what John reads’ refers to different propositions at\nworlds at which John reads different things (and refers to the\nproposition that John reads Moby Dick at those worlds at\nwhich Moby Dick is the one and only thing that John reads).\n \nIf wh-complements are not meaningful units of the sentences in which\nthey occur, one option is to interpret wh-complements\n“contextually”, as Russell interpreted definite\ndescriptions. Indeed, Hintikka (1976, Chapter 4) argues that\nknowledge-wh sentences like (37)-(39) are ambiguous between two\nreadings: a universal reading and an existential reading. In the case\nof (37), Hintikka’s two readings are as follows:  \nKarttunen (1977, 7) disputes the existence of Hintikka’s\nambiguity.  \nBraun (2006) offers a very different account of knowledge-wh on which\nthe question-answer relationship underlying knowledge-wh is much less\nformal, and this makes it very easy to have knowledge-wh on\nBraun’s account. \nConsider this example: \nExamples like (46) are identity questions, which seem\nintuitively to call for a dimension of context-dependence that\nstandard theories of the question-answer relationship do not\naccommodate. The idea is that different ways of identifying Hong Oak\nYun are relevant in different contexts; accordingly, different\npropositions count as answers (or as correct answers) to (46) in\ndifferent contexts. Aloni (2005) provides a recent example of a theory\ndesigned to accommodate this intuition. Braun (2006) rejects the\nintuition entirely.  \nAccording to Braun’s (2006, 26) information provision\naccount of questions, “to answer a question is simply to provide\ninformation about the subject matter of the question.” That is,\n(46) is answered by any proposition that provides information about\nHong Oak Yun, even the proposition expressed by ‘Hong Oak Yun is\na person who is over three inches tall’. This answer may not\nsatisfy or be useful to or be informative for the speaker who poses\n(46), but it counts as an answer despite these purely pragmatic\nfailings, according to Braun’s theory. To know who Hong Oak\nYun is, according to Braun, is simply to know the truth of a\nproposition that answers (46), which is to say, to know the truth of\nany proposition that provides information about Hong Oak Yun.\nBraun’s view contrasts with the contextualism of Boër and\nLycan (1986) according to which knowing who Hong Oak Yun is requires\nknowing a proposition that provides contextually relevant information\nabout Hong Oak Yun. Another contextualist alternative to Braun’s\nview is the view of Masto (2010), according to which (46) denotes a\ncontextually determined set of possible answers, and knowing who Hong\nOak Yun is consists in being able to choose or recognize the correct\nanswer from that contextually determined set. \nWhere Boër and Lycan view knowing-wh as context-relative,\nSchaffer (2007) views it as question-relative. The problem, according\nto Schaffer, is that if knowledge-wh is reduced to knowledge-that and\nis not question-relative, then cases of knowledge-wh that should be\ndistinguished will not be distinguished. Schaffer calls this the\nProblem of Convergent Knowledge. For example, suppose that (47) is\ntrue: \nOn a non-question-relative account of knowledge-wh that reduces\nknowledge-wh to knowledge-that, all three of the following will be\nequivalent because all three can be reduced to (47):  \nSchaffer argues that sentences like (48a–c) are not equivalent.\nAccording to Schaffer’s account, assuming the cat is indeed on\nthe mat, to know where the cat is is to know that the cat is on the\nmat relative to the question ‘Where is the cat?’, whereas\nto know what is on the mat is to know that the cat is on the mat\nrelative to the question ‘What is on the mat?’. Schaffer\nargues, in the end, that all knowledge, including knowledge-that, is\nquestion-relative. Aloni and Égré (2010) offer a\ndifferent take on Schaffer’s Problem of Convergent Knowledge,\narguing that it reveals a pragmatic ambiguity concerning what it means\nto know the answer to a wh-question.  \nBrogaard (2009) rejects both reductionist views (which, like\nHintikka’s, reduce knowledge-wh to knowledge-that) and\nanti-reductionist views (which, like Schaffer’s, analyze\nknowledge-wh as question-relative knowledge-that), arguing instead\nthat wh-complements are predicates and knowledge-wh is a special kind\nof de re knowledge. For example, on Brogaard’s view, the logical\nform of (48c) is: \nKnowledge-wh is only one of a broader category of attitudes\ncorresponding to what Lahiri (2002) calls responsive\npredicates. It is characteristic of responsive predicates that\nthey can accept both interrogative and declarative complements, as in\n‘Mary knows/remembers/forgets who runs’ and ‘Mary\nknows/remembers/forgets that John runs’. Responsive predicates\ncontrast with what Lahiri (2002) calls rogative predicates,\nsuch as ‘wonder’, ‘be curious’, and\n‘inquire’. Rogative predicates can accept interrogative\ncomplements but cannot accept declarative complements. For example,\none can inquire who ate the last doughnut, but one cannot inquire that\nJohn ate the last doughnut. The distinction between rogative and\nresponsive predicates turns out to have epistemological as well as\nsemantic significance, as it underlies Friedman’s (2013)\nargument that there is a category of attitudes that have\nquestions, not propositions, as their contents. Friedman\ncalls these the interrogative attitudes, and they are\nprecisely the attitudes denoted by rogative predicates.  \nWithin the category of responsive predicates Lahiri (2002, 287)\ndistinguishes the veridical from the non-veridical.\nVeridical-responsive predicates include ‘know’,\n‘remember’, and ‘forget’;\nnon-veridical-responsive predicates include ‘be certain’,\n‘agree (about)’, and ‘conjecture (about)’.\nWhereas a veridical-responsive predicate expresses a relation to the\ncorrect answer to its interrogative complement, a\nnon-veridical-responsive predicate expresses a relation to a possible\n(but not necessarily the correct) answer. For example, ‘Jane\nremembers who won the lottery’ entails that Jane has knowledge\nthat correctly answers the question ‘Who won the\nlottery?’, whereas ‘Jane is certain about who won the\nlottery’ entails that Jane is certain of the truth of a\nproposition that may or may not correctly answer that same question.\nOther classifications of question-embedding verbs exist and are\nsurveyed by Lahiri (2002, 284–291).  \nFor a detailed critique of the recent literature on knowledge-wh, see\nChapter 2 of Stanley 2011. Parent (2014) provides a survey of the\nrecent literature about knowledge-wh organized around three issues:\nthe reducibility of knowledge-wh to knowledge-that, the relativity of\nknowledge-wh to a contrast proposition, and the issue of whether the\ncontext-sensitivity of knowing-wh is to be understood as a semantic or\na pragmatic phenomenon. The Uegaki manuscript listed below under Other\nInternet Resources provides an overview of recent work on the\nsemantics of responsive predicates generally and is organized around\nfour approaches: the reduction of questions to propositions, the\nreduction of propositions to questions, the uniformity approach (on\nwhich declarative and interrogative complements of a responsive\npredicate are of the same semantic type), and the ambiguity approach\n(which postulates distinct proposition-taking and question-taking\nreadings of a given responsive predicate).
