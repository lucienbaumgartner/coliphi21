Its supposed connection with disjunctive words of natural\nlanguage like or has long intrigued philosophers, logicians\nand linguists. In this entry we give an overview of logical and\nlinguistic analyses of disjunction with focus on developments at the\ninterface between logic and language. Sections 1 and 2 present\ndisjunction as a binary connective in classical logic and in a number\nof non-classical interpretations. Section 3 discusses some basic facts\nconcerning disjunctive words in natural language, and introduces a\ngeneralized, cross-categorial notion of disjunction as the\njoin operator in a (Boolean) algebra. Section 4 and 5 present\nGrice’s account of the use of or in conversation and\nrecent developments in the discussion on inclusive and exclusive uses\nof linguistic disjunctive words. Finally, sections 6 and 7 introduce\ntwo recent non-classical accounts of linguistic disjunction and\ndiscuss applications to phenomena of free choice, disjunctive\nquestions and counterfactuals with disjunctive antecedents.\n\nIn classical logic, disjunction (\\(\\vee\\)) is a binary sentential\noperator whose interpretation is given by the following truth\ntable: \nA disjunction \\((\\phi \\vee \\psi)\\) is true iff at least one of the\ndisjuncts is true. \nAdopting a natural deduction system, the proof-theoretical\ncontribution of disjunctive formulas can be defined by the following\ntwo rules, which regulate (i) how disjunctions can be drawn as\nconclusions (disjunction introduction rule, \\(I_{\\vee}\\), also known\nas addition) and (ii) how conclusions can be drawn from\ndisjunctions (disjunction elimination rule, \\(E_{\\vee}\\), also known\nas reasoning by cases): \nIntuitively, the former tells us that we can conclude \\((\\phi \\vee\n\\psi)\\) on the basis of \\(\\phi\\) (or of \\(\\psi\\)), while the latter\nstates that \\(\\theta\\) will follow from a disjunction \\((\\phi \\vee\n\\psi)\\) if it can be derived from \\(\\phi\\) and also from \\(\\psi\\). \nOne of the goals of a logical system is to arrive at a rigorous\ncharacterization of the notion of validity. In a logical system, which\nnormally consists of a language, a proof-theory and a semantics,\nvalidity can be defined proof-theoretically or semantically.\nProof-theoretically, validity is defined in terms of formal proofs. An\nargument is proof-theoretically valid (\\(\\vdash\\)) if there is a proof\nfrom some or all of its premises to its conclusion. Semantically or\nmodel-theoretically, validity is normally defined in terms of\ntruth-preservation. An argument is model-theoretically valid\n(\\(\\models\\)) if there is no interpretation (in the semantics) in\nwhich its premises are all true and its conclusion false. In classical\nlogic, the proof-theoretical and the model-theoretical perspectives\nhave been proven to characterize exactly the same notion of validity\n(soundness and completeness theorems): an argument is\nproof-theoretically valid iff it is model-theoretically valid. \nBelow are some of the principles involving disjunction that classical\nlogic validates. In the list we adopt the model-theoretic notation\n(\\(\\models\\)) because such perspective will be more prominent in the\nfollowing section. \\(\\models \\phi\\) means \\(\\phi\\) is true in all\ninterpretations. The last two principles in the list are\nmodel-theoretic analogues of disjunction introduction and elimination,\nrespectively. \nThese principles have been widely discussed and, at times, rejected in\nthe logical-philosophical literature. The following section briefly\nsummarizes parts of these discussions focusing on which alternative\ninterpretation of \\(\\vee\\) these discussions have led to. \nThe law of excluded middle (LEM) states that any proposition of the\nform \\((\\phi \\vee \\neg \\phi)\\) is logically valid. The semantic\nprinciple of bivalence states that every proposition is either true or\nfalse (and not both). Bivalence and LEM collapse in classical logic,\nbut are distinguished for example in supervaluationism (van Fraassen\n1966), which rejects the former, while retaining the latter. Since\nAristotle, who was the first to state these principles, bivalence and\nLEM have been criticized on various grounds. This section first\ndiscusses intuitionistic logic, which invalidates LEM (and part of the\nDe Morgan laws); and then presents some canonical arguments against\nbivalence and discuss how \\(\\vee\\) is interpreted in a number of\nnon-bivalent systems including many-valued logic, dynamic semantics,\nsupervaluationism, as well as quantum logic, which besides bivalence\nalso invalidates the classical distributive laws. \nLEM has been rejected in constructivism, in particular in\nintuitionistic logic (see the entry on\n intuitionistic logic).\n The standard informal interpretation of logical operators in\nintuitionistic logic is the so-called proof-interpretation or\nBrouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov (BHK). On such interpretation the meaning\nof a statement \\(\\phi\\) is given by explaining what constitutes a\nproof of \\(\\phi\\) rather than in terms of its truth. The BHK\ninterpretation of disjunction reads as follows: \nOn such interpretation, the question concerning the validity of LEM is\nthen equivalent to the question of the possibility of unsolvable\n(mathematical) problems (Brouwer 1908, translated in Heyting (ed)\n1975): LEM\nshould then fail because it is doubtful that for any mathematical\nstatement \\(\\phi\\), either there is a proof of \\(\\phi\\) or a proof of\n\\(\\neg\n \\phi\\).[1] \nIntuitionistic logic can be described as classical logic without LEM\n(or the principle of double negation \\((\\neg \\neg \\phi \\to \\phi)\\)),\nbut with the classical law of contradiction \\(((\\phi \\to \\psi) \\to\n((\\phi \\to \\neg \\psi) \\to \\neg \\phi))\\) and ex falso\nquodlibet \\((\\neg \\phi \\to (\\phi \\to \\psi))\\). Related to its\nrejection of LEM, intuitionistic logic satisfies the disjunction\nproperty (Gödel 1932). A logic is said to have the\ndisjunction property if whenever \\((\\phi \\vee \\psi)\\) is provable in\nthe logic, so is at least one of \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\). Classical\nlogic does not have such property (\\(\\vdash_{CL} (p \\vee \\neg p)\\),\nwithout \\(\\vdash_{CL} p \\) or \\(\\vdash_{CL} \\neg p\\)) but has a weaker\nproperty called Halldén-completeness: every provable\ndisjunction whose disjuncts don’t share any propositional\nvariables has at least one of those disjuncts provable. \nThe rejection of LEM in intuitionistic logic also implies the\nrejection of classical reductio ad absurdum as a legitimate\nmethod of (mathematical) proof. Intuitionistically, ad\nabsurdum one can only prove negative statements (via negation\nintroduction \\((\\phi \\to \\bot) \\to \\neg \\phi\\)). This is because the\nprinciple of double negation (\\(\\neg \\neg \\phi \\to \\phi\\)) does not\nhold in intuitionistic logic. If it did, LEM would follow by modus\nponens from the intuitionistically provable \\(\\neg \\neg (\\phi\n\\vee \\neg \\phi)\\) (in general it holds that if \\(\\phi\\) is classically\nprovable, then \\(\\neg\\neg \\phi\\) is intuitionistically provable). \nFinally note that only one of the De Morgan laws is intuitionistically\nvalid, of the other only one half still holds: \nIntuitively, \\( \\neg (\\phi \\wedge \\psi) \\) intuitionistically asserts\nthat an effective method has been given, which would convert any proof\nof \\((\\phi \\wedge \\psi)\\) into a proof of a contradiction. But this\ndoes not imply that either a proof of \\(\\neg \\phi\\) (i.e., an\nalgorithm which would convert any proof of \\(\\phi\\) into a proof of a\ncontradiction) or a proof of \\(\\neg \\psi\\) has been given, which is\nwhat \\((\\neg \\phi \\vee \\neg \\psi)\\) intuitionistically asserts. \nThe semantic principle of bivalence states that every proposition is\neither true or false (and not both). Early arguments against bivalence\nwere linked to the problem of determinism. In De\nInterpretatione (part 9), Aristotle discusses the status of\nstatements about contingent future events, and seems to conclude that\nfor these statements the principle of bivalence should be rejected,\notherwise determinism would follow. His argument can be reconstructed\nas follows. Consider the statement A sea battle will be fought\ntomorrow. If the statement is true, then the sea battle will\nnecessarily take place. If the sentence is false, then it will be\nimpossible for the sea battle to take place. Assuming that statements\nare either true or false, one concludes that the sea battle is either\nnecessary or impossible. To escape this fatalistic conclusion\nAristotle rejects the principle of bivalence (while possibly retaining\nthe law of excluded middle, see van Fraassen 1966: 493–495, and\nthe entry on\n fatalism).\n Aristotle’s sea battle argument, although criticized by many,\nconstituted one of Łukasiewicz’ original motivations for the\ndevelopment of his trivalent logic (Łukasiewicz 1920,\ntranslated in McCall 1967). Since then various multi-valued logics have been\ndeveloped where formal disjunction \\(\\vee\\) receives a non-classical\ninterpretation. In Łukasiewicz’ original system, but also\nin strong Kleene three-valued logic (Kleene 1952), disjunction is\ninterpreted according to the following truth table, where # stands\nfor indefinite or possible in Łukasiewicz, and\nfor undefined in Kleene (Łukasiewicz’s and\nKleene’s system differ in their interpretation of implication,\nwe will disregard this issue here).  Priest’s (1979) Logic of\nParadox (LP) also adopts the following table for disjunction. There #\nshould be read as both true and false: \nOn this interpretation, a disjunction is true if at least one of the\ndisjuncts is true, false if both disjuncts are false, undefined\notherwise. \nIn Bochvar’s internal three-valued logic, also known as\nKleene’s weak three-valued logic, disjunction receives a\ndifferent interpretation. The symbol # should be read here as\nmeaningless: \nWhile on a strong Kleene interpretation, a disjunction can be true\neven if one of the disjuncts is undefined, on a weak Kleene\ninterpretation, if one of the disjuncts is meaningless, the whole\ndisjunction is meaningless as well. \nNegation receives the following interpretation in these systems: \nIn both strong and weak Kleene logics then, \\((\\phi \\vee \\neg \\phi)\\)\nnever has value \\(0\\), but it doesn’t always have value \\(1\\)\neither: if \\(\\phi\\) is assigned value #, so is its negation, but then\n\\((\\phi \\vee \\neg \\phi)\\) will also have value # on both the strong\nand weak interpretations of \\(\\vee\\). Thus \\((\\phi \\vee \\neg \\phi)\\)\nfails to be logically valid in these systems (unless both \\(1\\) and #\nare taken to be designated values, as in Priest’s LP, which\nvalidates LEM. Priest’s notion of validity is defined later in\nthis section). Other many-valued logics, such as the Łukasiewicz\ncontinuum-valued logic, also fail to validate LEM, for similar\nreasons. In continuum-valued logic, the set of truth values is the set\nof real numbers between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), where \\(1\\) stands for\ncompletely true, \\(0\\) for completely false, \\(0,5\\) for half true,\netc. Disjunction and negation are analyzed as \\(F_{\\vee}(x,\ny)=max(x,y) \\) and \\(F_{\\neg} (x)= 1-x\\) respectively, where \\(max\\)\nmeans “the maximum of”. But then since \\(max(x, 1-x)\\)\nneed not be equal to \\(1\\), \\((\\phi \\vee \\neg \\phi)\\) can fail to be\ncompletely true in this system. \nThe difference between the strong and weak Kleene’s treatment of\ndisjunction can be better appreciated by looking at the phenomenon of\npresupposition, which constitutes one of the most well-known\nlinguistic motivations for the rejection of bivalence (other common\nmotivating phenomena include the semantic paradoxes and vagueness, see\nthe entries on\n liar paradox\n and\n sorites paradox,\n and\n section 2.1.4\n below). Consider Russell’s (1905) example:  \nAccording to bivalence,\n (8)\n must be either true or false. Which is it? Russell’s answer is\nwell known. According to his theory of descriptions\n (8)\n expresses the conjunction “there is a unique king of France and\nhe is bald” of which the first conjunct is false, and therefore\nthe whole sentence is false. Strawson (1950) however criticized\nRussell’s analysis and argued that the existence and uniqueness\nof the king of France is not part of what is asserted by an utterance\nof\n (8)\n rather it is part of what is taken for granted or\npresupposed. If there is no king of France, the sentence is\nnot false, rather it is neither true nor false. Adopting a\nthree-valued logic we can assign to\n (8)\n value #. Consider now the following three examples where\n (8)\n occurs in a disjunction. \nBoth strong and weak Kleene systems predict\n (9)\n to be undefined/meaningless, since both disjuncts are\nundefined/meaningless. However, the predictions of the two systems\nwith respect to\n (10)\n and\n (11)\n diverge: the strong Kleene system predicts both\n (10)\n and\n (11)\n to be true since at least one of the disjuncts is true (assuming\nBarack Obama is in fact tall), while the weak system predicts both\n (10)\n and\n (11)\n to be meaningless since at least one of the disjuncts is meaningless.\nIntuitively, however,\n (10)\n is true while\n (11)\n is more readily judged as undefined/meaningless. Thus the predictions\nof neither systems are in agreement with common sense judgments.\nLinguists have observed that the intuitive difference between\n (10)\n and\n (11)\n is that in the former, but not in the latter the existence of a\nunique king of France (the presupposition of one of the disjuncts) is\nentailed by the negation of the other disjunct. Karttunen (1973), who\nsystematically studied the projection behavior of presuppositions\n(i.e., how the presupposition of a constituent projects at the level\nof the complex sentence), described disjunction as a filter.\nIn his taxonomy of embedding operators, plugs block all\npresuppositions in their scope (an example is told that),\nholes allow presupposition to project freely (e.g.,\nnegation), while filters allow only some presuppositions to\nproject. Various analyses have been proposed attempting to capture how\npresuppositions project when embedded in disjunctions or other complex\nsentences. A prominent example is Peters (1979), who showed how\nKarttunen’s observations can be accounted for within a\nmulti-valued logic with special non-symmetric connectives (see the\nentry on\n presupposition\n for an overview). \nAnother influential attempt to formalize Karttunen’s\ngeneralization with respect to presupposition projection, is the\ndynamic account of Heim (1983), further developed in Beaver (2001). In\na dynamic semantics, the interpretation of sentences is given in terms\nof their context change potentials rather than their truth conditions\n(see the entry on\n dynamic semantics).\n A context (or information state) \\(c\\) is defined as a set of\npossible worlds, the worlds compatible with the information available\nto the conversationalists, along the lines of Stalnaker’s (1978)\nnotion of a context set. The meaning of an atomic sentence \\(p\\) is\nidentified with its potential to update the input context \\(c\\), i.e.,\nits potential to eliminate all non-\\(p\\) worlds from \\(c\\): \\(c[p]=\\{w\n\\in c \\mid w(p) =1\\}\\). Here is the dynamic clause for\ndisjunction. \nThe result of updating a context \\(c\\) with a disjunction \\((\\phi \\vee\n\\psi)\\) consists in the union of (i) the result of updating \\(c\\) with\n\\(\\phi\\) and (ii) the result of updating with \\(\\psi\\) the context \\(c\n\\setminus c [\\phi]\\) obtained by subtracting from \\(c\\) all worlds\nwhich verify \\(\\phi\\). By defining the presupposition of a sentence as\nwhat has to be true (or supported) in a context \\(c\\) in order for an\nupdate with the sentence to be defined in \\(c\\), the dynamic account\nof disjunction captures the pattern in\n (9)–(11).\n Simplifying, suppose \\(c\\) does not support the information that\nthere is a king of France, then\n (9)\n and\n (11)\n will be undefined in \\(c\\), because \\(c [\\phi]\\) and/or \\((c\n\\setminus c [\\phi])[\\psi]\\) will be undefined. But\n (10)\n will be defined. This is because the second disjunct in\n (10),\n which presupposes that there is a king of France, is interpreted here\nwith respect to the local context \\((c \\setminus c [\\phi])\\) which is\nthe context obtained by subtracting from \\(c\\) all worlds which verify\nthe first disjunct, i.e., all worlds in which there is no king of\nFrance. Such local context will support the information that there is\na king of France. So the whole disjunction does not presuppose\nanything. The ordering between disjuncts however matters in a dynamic\naccount and so the analysis predicts a difference in presupposition\nbetween\n (10)\n and the following variant where the presupposition trigger occurs in\nthe first disjunct rather than the second: \nThis prediction however does not seem to be borne out. \nA related discussion concerns the behavior of anaphora in the context\nof disjunction and in particular the challenge presented by the\nso-called “bathroom” example\n (14)\n from Barbara Partee, where the anaphoric pronoun it in the\nsecond disjunct refers back to the negative indefinite no\nbathroom in the first disjunct, while negative indefinites are\nnormally inaccessible to subsequent pronouns as illustrated in\n (15): \nThe contrast between\n (14)\n and\n (15)\n seems to provide evidence for the analysis of disjunction presented\nin\n (12)\n according to which the second disjunct must be interpreted with\nrespect to a context supporting the negation of the first disjunct (so\na context supporting the information that there is a bathroom in the\nhouse). Note however that the principle of double negation \\((\\neg\n\\neg \\phi \\to \\phi)\\) is invalidated in standard dynamic semantics for\nanaphora (Groenendijk and Stokhof 1991) and so a full account of these\nexamples requires some adjustment. Various solutions have been\nproposed (e.g., Simons 1996), but the discussion about anaphora (and\npresupposition projection) in disjunctions has not been settled\nyet. \nIt is easy to see that a dynamic semantics with presuppositions does\nnot validate LEM, because, if \\(\\phi\\) contains a presupposition\ntrigger, \\((\\phi \\vee \\neg \\phi)\\) will be undefined in any context in\nwhich the presuppositions of \\(\\phi\\) are not satisfied. For the\nfragment without presuppositions, however, LEM is validated, but there\nis a non-trivial sense in which bivalence is still rejected: truth and\nfalsity in dynamic semantics are defined relative to a context, for\nexample, \\(\\phi\\) is true (or supported) in \\(c\\) iff \\(c[\\phi]=c\\);\nand \\(\\phi\\) is false in \\(c\\) iff \\(c[\\phi]=\\emptyset\\). But then\n\\(p\\) might be neither true nor false in a context \\(c\\) (e.g., if\n\\(c\\) contains both \\(p\\) worlds and non-\\(p\\) worlds), while, for all\n\\( c\\), it holds that \\((p \\vee \\neg p)\\) is true in \\(c\\). \nAnother system which rejects bivalence while validating LEM is\nsupervaluationism (van Fraassen 1966). Let \\(V\\) be a set of classical\nvaluations \\(v\\), where a classical valuation is a function assigning\nT(rue) or F(alse) to any statement in the relevant language. A\nsupervaluation \\(s_V\\) is then a function assigning T (F) to exactly\nthose statements assigned T (F) by all valuations in \\(V\\). Since\n\\(V\\) can contain classical valuations that assign different values to\none and the same statement (e.g., if \\(v_1(p)\\)=T and \\(v_2(p)=\\)F for\n\\(v_1,v_2 \\in V\\)), supervaluations have truth-value gaps (\\(s_V(p)\\)\nis undefined), so the law of bivalence fails. LEM, by contrast, is\nvalidated, since \\(v(\\phi \\vee \\neg \\phi)\\)=T for all \\(\\phi\\) and\nclassical \\(v\\), and thus \\(s_V(\\phi \\vee \\neg \\phi)\\) = T, for any\n\\(s_V\\). Thus, in supervaluationism, a disjunction can be supertrue\n(i.e., can be assigned T in some \\(s_V\\)) without any of its disjuncts\nbeing supertrue. \nSupervaluational semantics has been largely applied to explain\nphenomena of vagueness (Lewis 1970; Fine 1975b; Kamp 1975; see also the entry on\n vagueness). A predicate \\(P\\) is vague if it exhibits borderline\ncases for which it is not clear whether \\(P\\) truly applies or not.\nProminent examples of vague predicates are relative adjectives like\ntall or clever, while adjectives like prime\nas in 3 is a prime number are normally taken not to be vague.\nThe basic insight of any supervaluational account of vagueness is that\na vague language admits of several precisifications (formalized as a\nset \\(V\\) of classical valuations) and the semantic value of a\nstatement is fixed only insofar as all those precisifications agree: a\nstatement \\(\\phi\\) is true if it is supertrue (\\(s_V(\\phi)=T\\)), that\nis, true on every admissible precisification (\\(v(\\phi)=T\\), for all\n\\(v\\in V\\)), and it is false if it is superfalse (\\(s_V(\\phi)=F\\)),\nthat is, false on every admissible precisification (\\(v(\\phi)=F\\), for\nall \\(v\\in V\\)); otherwise it has no semantic value. A common argument\nin favor of supervaluationism relies on the observation that while a\npredicate like tall may be vague, the compound predicates\ntall or not tall and tall and not tall are not\nvague, the former being true and the latter being false of all\nentities in the predicate application domain. Thus, while \\(a\\) is\ntall may fail to be true or false (and the same goes for its\nnegation), \\(a\\) is either tall or not tall and \\(a\\) is\ntall and not tall are always true and false respectively, as\npredicted by a supervaluational semantics. More recent experimental\nwork, however, has cast some doubts on these observations (e.g.,\nRipley 2011). Supervaluationism has further been criticized for giving\nrise to counterexamples to familiar inference-patterns (Williamson\n1994: 151–152 and 162–163), (see also Keefe 2000; Williams\n2008 for further discussion). For example, it is easy to see that in\nthis framework, one loses the disjunction elimination rule, at least\nin languages with a determinately/supertrue operator \\(D\\). Given a\nclass \\(V\\) of classical valuations, we can introduce the operator\n\\(D\\) with the stipulation that \\(v(D \\phi)=1\\) iff \\(v_1(\\phi)=1 \\),\nfor all \\(v_1\\) in \\(V\\). Defining supervalidity, \\(\\models_{sv}\\), in\nterms of preservation of supertruth, we have that \\(p \\models_{sv} D\np\\), \\(\\neg p \\models_{sv} D \\neg p\\) and \\(\\models_{sv} p \\vee \\neg\np\\), but \\(\\not\\models_{sv} Dp \\vee D \\neg p\\). So the disjunction\nelimination rule does not preserve supervalidity in this language (see\nalso Humberstone, chapter 6, pages 830–833). Whether\nsupervalidity is the right notion of validity from a supervaluational\nperspective is however controversial (e.g., Varzi 2007). \nAnother logic which lacks bivalence is quantum logic, which also\ntypically rejects the distributive laws of classical logic (Birkhoff\nand von Neumann 1936; Putnam 1968). Quantum logic was started by\nBirkoff and von Neumann for studying the relation among physical\nobservables in quantum physics. Quantum logic rejects bivalence\nbecause a state in a quantum system typically assigns probability\nvalues to experimental propositions rather than plain true or false.\nTo see why quantum physics can be taken to provide evidence against\nthe distributive laws of classical logic consider a particle moving on\na line. Suppose \\(p\\) asserts that the particle’s momentum is\nwithin a certain interval, while \\(q\\) and \\(r\\) assert that the\nparticle’s position is in the intervals \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\)\nrespectively. Suppose the statement \\(p \\wedge (q \\vee r)\\) is\nconfirmed by our observation, so is true (or has value 1). By the\ndistributive laws we can classically conclude \\((p \\wedge q) \\vee (p\n\\wedge r)\\). But in quantum theory the latter might still be false\n(have value 0), since both conjunctions \\((p \\wedge q)\\) and \\((p\n\\wedge r)\\) might assert tighter restrictions on simultaneous values\nof position and momentum than is allowed by Heisenberg’s\nuncertainty principle (see the entry on\n the uncertainty principle).\n So in the “logic of quantum physics” a disjunction \\((q\n\\vee r)\\) can have value 1 in a state without any of the disjuncts\nhaving value 1: if \\(q\\) has value 1 or \\(r\\) has value 1, then \\((q\n\\vee r)\\) has value 1, but the other direction fails. \nVarious ways have been proposed to develop a quantum logic which\nrejects the distributive laws while saving as much as possible of\nclassical logic. One way discussed by Dummett (1978) (who was not a\nproponent of quantum logic) involves restricting the elimination rule\nfor disjunction so that the distributive laws are no longer derivable\n(see Humberstone 2011: 298–302 and 918–922 for more\ndetails). Arguably more natural characterizations of quantum logic use\nalgebraic semantics and probability theory (see the entry\n quantum logic and probability theory). \nDisjunctive Syllogism (DS) states that we can infer \\(\\psi\\) from \\(\n(\\phi \\vee \\psi) \\) and \\(\\neg \\phi\\). DS, which is valid in classical\nlogic, but also in intuitionistic logic and in the multi-valued logics\ndiscussed in the previous section (with the exception of PL), has\nhowever been rejected in relevance logics (Anderson and Belnap 1962,\n1975). Relevance logics are non-classical logical systems developed to\navoid the paradoxes of material and strict implication (see the entry\non\n relevance logic).\n These are classically valid principles, like \\(p \\to (q \\vee \\neg\nq)\\), which however strike us as counterintuitive. This is so because,\naccording to the relevantist, they involve a fallacy of relevance: in\nthese cases the antecedent is typically irrelevant to the consequent.\nBelnap’s formal criteria of relevance (also known as variable\nsharing principle) is that in any provable implication, the antecedent\nand the consequent should share at least one propositional variable, and that no\ninference can be shown valid if the premises and conclusion do not\nshare at least one propositional variable. \nHistorically, relevance logic rejected DS because of the role it plays\nin C.I. Lewis “independent” proof of the fact that an\nimpossible proposition \\((A \\wedge \\neg A)\\) can lead to any\nproposition whatsoever, which is one of the paradoxes of strict\nimplication: \nAccording to Anderson and Belnap “the inference from \\(\\neg A\\)\nand \\(A\\vee B\\) to \\(B\\) is an error: […] a fallacy of\nrelevance” (Anderson and Belnap 1962: 19). Formally, the\ninference is rejected because according to Anderson and Belnap’s\nnotion of tautological entailment (see their system E) \\(\\neg A \\wedge\n(A\\vee B)\\) entails \\(B\\) if and only if \\((\\neg A \\wedge A) \\vee\n(\\neg A \\wedge B)\\) entails \\(B\\), only if \\((\\neg A \\wedge A)\\)\nentails \\(B\\), which fails since the premise \\((\\neg A \\wedge A)\\) is\nnot relevant to the conclusion \\(B\\) (no shared propositional\nvariables). Anderson and Belnap further argued that we can still have\na version of disjunctive syllogism involving an intensional notion of\ndisjunction \\(\\vee_i\\), for which addition wouldn’t hold.\nIntensional disjunction is defined as follows: \\((A\\vee_i B):= (\\neg A\n\\to_i B) \\), where \\(\\to_i\\) is an intensional implicational\nconnective, i.e., one satisfying the formal criterion of relevance\nintroduced above. The English or would then be ambiguous\nbetween intensional and extensional (truth-functional) disjunction,\nand only for the latter would addition hold. Intuitively, the\nintensional variety of or would be one requiring\n“relevance” between the disjuncts. On the intensional\nreading, “\\(A\\) or \\(B\\)” would entail that \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) are so related that we are entitled to say “If\n\\(A\\) had not been true, \\(B\\) would have been true” or\n“If \\(B\\) had not been true, \\(A\\) would have been\ntrue” or the like. A disjunction like Either Napoleon was\nborn in Corsica or else the number of the beast is perfect\nclearly fails to have this property and therefore is of the\ntruth-functional kind. Whereas That is either Drosophilia\nMelanogaster or D. virilis, I’m not sure which appears to\nentail that if it is not the one then it is the other, and thus is of\nthe intensional kind. The distinction between intensional and\nextensional disjunction has been criticized by various scholars,\nincluding Burgess (1981, 1983), but has been defended by Read (1981,\n1983) who proposed the following example as a clear case of\ntruth-functional disjunction, for which addition is valid: You\nqualify for a grant if either you are over 65 or you can earn less\nthan 2000 pounds a year (Read 1981: 68). Now if English\nor had an intensional and an extensional sense, it should be\npossible to find both in a large variety of linguistic contexts. On a\ncloser inspection however it appears that it is quite hard to find\nclear cases of intensional disjunction in embedded positions like in\nthe antecedent of a conditional (as in Read’s example), or under\nnegation. For example, That is not Drosophilia Melanogaster or D.\nvirilisit, on its most natural reading, simply means that that is\nnot either, but then or must be extensional here because to\nderive “not \\(A\\) and not \\(B\\)” from “not\n(\\(A\\) or \\(B\\))” addition is needed. This seems to\nsuggest that phenomena of relevance should be captured on a pragmatic\nlevel rather than on the level of logic (Grice 1989). An explicit\nGricean account of relevance of disjunctive sentences has been indeed\nproposed by Simons (2001), who observes that felicitous utterances of\n“\\(A\\) or \\(B\\)” require the disjuncts to be\nrelevant alternatives, and argues that such condition, which she calls\nthe relatedness condition, can be derived from general principles of\nconversation interacting with truth functional interpretation of\nor. In “Further Notes on Logic and Conversation”\nGrice had suggested that to felicitously use a disjunctive sentence\n“\\(A\\) or \\(B\\)”, a speaker must be in possession of\na reasonable argument with “\\(A\\) or \\(B\\)” as\nconclusion [by Quality] which does not contain one of the disjuncts as\na step [by Quantity] (Grice 1989: 44). According to Simons to arrive\nat such a kind of evidence is almost certainly impossible in case the\ndisjuncts are not (contextually) related to each other (as they were\nfor example in Belnap and Anderson’s Napoleon example, which\nindeed requires a special context to be acceptable). Simons (2001)\nalso discusses a second requirement that a disjunction needs to\nsatisfy in order to constitute a felicitous contribution to an\nordinary conversation, namely what she calls the distinctness\ncondition (aka known as Hurford’s constraint, from Hurford\n1974), which states that the disjuncts in a clausal disjunction must\nbe distinct alternatives. The following, which does not satisfy such a\nconstraint since one of the disjunct entails the other, is indeed\nhighly anomalous (Simons 2001: example (2)): \nHurford’s constraint has more recently received some attention\nin the semantic/pragmatic literature because of its role in the debate\nbetween localist and globalist analysis of scalar implicatures (e.g.,\nChierchia, Fox, and Spector 2012).\n \nDisjunctive syllogism is also invalid (or better quasi-valid) in\nPriest’s Logic of Paradox (LP). In PL both \\(1\\) and \\(\\#\\) are\ndesignated values (i.e., preserved in valid inferences), where #\nstands for both true and false. More formally, validity is defined as\nfollows: \\(\\Sigma \\models \\phi\\) iff there is no valuation \\(v\\) such\nthat for all \\(\\psi \\in \\Sigma: v(\\psi) = 1\\) or # and \\(v(\\phi) =0\\).\nAdopting the strong Kleene tables for disjunction and negation\npresented above, we obtain that \\(\\phi, (\\neg \\phi \\vee \\psi)\n\\not\\models \\psi\\), because \\(\\phi\\) and thus also \\((\\neg \\phi \\vee\n\\psi)\\) might be both true and false, while \\(\\psi\\) is false. The\nschema \\(\\phi , (\\neg \\phi \\vee \\psi) \\models \\psi\\) however only\nfails in case \\(\\phi\\) is a dialetheia (both true and false),\nin this sense is the scheme quasi-valid. Priest (2006: ch. 8) then argues that applications\nof disjunctive syllogism can be justified/are reasonable in case\n\\((\\phi \\wedge \\neg \\phi)\\) is rationally rejectable.\n \nWe conclude this section with a final remark on addition, which\naccording to Anderson and Belnap does not hold for intensional\ndisjunction. The validity of addition has also been disputed in\nrelation to imperative logic. We don’t seem to be able to\nconclude\n (18)\n from\n (17)\n (Ross’ (1941) paradox): \nOne way to tackle this would be to treat or in\n (18)\n as a case of intensional disjunction. This solution however would\nfail to account for a characteristic aspect of the interpretation of\ndisjunctive imperatives which arguably explains the failure of\naddition in these cases, namely their choice offering potential. The\nmost natural interpretation of disjunctive imperatives is as one\npresenting a choice between different actions:\n (18)\n implies that you may post the letter and you may burn it (a free\nchoice inference). Imperative\n (17)\n then cannot imply\n (18)\n otherwise when told the former one would be justified in burning the\nletter rather than posting it (e.g., Mastop 2005; Aloni 2007; Aloni\nand Ciardelli 2013). More on free choice in\n section 6. \nFrom a linguistic point of view disjunction is a kind of coordination,\nwhere coordination refers to syntactic constructions in which two or\nmore units of the same type are combined into a larger unit and still\nhave the same semantic relations with other surrounding elements\n(Haspelmath 2007). An open question is whether disjunctive\ncoordination is a universal that can be found in all languages. All\nlanguages appear to possess coordination constructions of some kind,\nbut not all languages seem to have explicit coordinators like\nand and or. For example, Maricopa (a Yuman language\nof Arizona described by Gill 1991) and Dyribal (an Australian\nAboriginal language described by Dixon 1972) seem to lack explicit\ncoordination structures, so in these languages there is no word\ncorresponding to or (see also Winter 1995). This does not\nnecessarily mean however that these languages lack a way to express\ndisjunctive meanings. Maricopa and Dyribal appear to be able to convey\n“\\(A\\) or \\(B\\)”, without explicit disjunctive\ncoordinator, by adding a suffix/particle expressing uncertainty to the\nmain verb.\n (19)\n illustrates this strategy for Maricopa (from Gil 1991: 102): \nThat it is the “uncertainty” suffix šaa\nwhich is responsible for the disjunctive interpretation is evidenced\nby the fact that if omitted the interpretation of the sentence becomes\nconjunctive (Gil 1991). The close connection between linguistic\ndisjunction and uncertainty (or ignorance) will be further scrutinized\nin the following sections. Let us now turn to languages which do have\nspecialized disjunctive words like or. A first difference\nbetween logical disjunction (\\(\\vee\\)) and disjunctive words in human\nlanguages is that while the former is a binary operator, there is no\ntheoretical finite limit to the number of units that the latter can\njoin. Another striking difference is that while logical disjunction is\na sentential operator, linguistic disjunction is typically\ncross-categorial. For example, English or can coordinate\nexpressions of different syntactic category as illustrated below,\nwhere the units are noun phrases in\n (20a)\n and verb phrases in\n (20b): \nAdopting an algebraic perspective Keenan and Faltz (1985) showed that\nwe can capture all these uses identifying disjunction with the join\noperator in a Boolean algebra (or, simplifying a bit, set union). In\nthe special case of disjunction at the sentence level, the Boolean\noperator boils down to the classical propositional operator on truth\nvalues (see\n section 7.1\n for a recent account which identifies disjunction with the join\noperator in a Heyting algebra, which at the sentence level yields a\nnon-classical (inquisitive) propositional operator). As an\nillustration consider the following interpretation of generalized,\ncross-categorial or in terms of generalized union, adapted\nfrom Gazdar (1980) (see also Winter 2001). The crucial assumption\nbehind this definition is that noun phrases like John or\nevery man denote sets or functions rather than individuals\n(as in Montague 1973). \nAssume that (i) verb phrases (VPs) denote functions from individuals\ninto truth values (type \\(\\langle e,t\\rangle\\)), (ii) noun phrases\ndenote functions from VP denotations into truth values (type\n\\(\\langle\\langle e,t\\rangle, t\\rangle\\)), and (iii) sentences denote\ntruth values (type \\(t\\)). Then, talking about characteristic\nfunctions as if they were sets, we have that John denotes the\nset of all John’s properties, Mary denotes the set of\nall Mary’s properties, and sang denotes the set of all\nindividuals that sang. Given\n (22),\n John or Mary denotes the union of John’s properties\nwith Mary’s properties, i.e., the set consisting of exactly\nthose properties that pertain to either John or Mary. So John or\nMary sang will come out true just in case this union has as a\nmember the property of singing. This is the case only if either John\nsang or Mary sang (see\n 23a).\n On the other hand, given\n (22),\n sang or danced denotes the union of the set of individuals\nthat sang with the set of individuals that danced. So every man sang\nor danced will come out true just in case this union is a member of\nthe property-set denoted by every man. From this we cannot infer that\neither every man sang or every man danced (see 23b). \nOne of the assumptions behind this cross-categorial analysis is that\nthe input to the semantic component of grammar involves the units as\ncoordinated at “surface structure” (i.e., no syntactic\nconjunction reduction, mapping non-sentential coordination to\nsentential coordination at “deep structure”). This is\ncrucial for example to capture example (23b) where non-sentential\ndisjunction could not be syntactically reduced to sentential\ndisjunction without change of meaning. Rooth and Partee (1982) however\ndiscussed a number of counterexamples to such an analysis involving\ncases of wide-scope or in opaque contexts. Their famous\nexample is repeated below (Rooth and Partee 1982: example (13)): \nAs Rooth and Partee observed the sentence has three readings: (i) the\nnormal de dicto reading, according to which Mary would be\nsatisfied if she found any maid and she would also be satisfied if she\nfound any cook (this reading can be generated by combining the verb\ndirectly with the disjunctive noun phrase a maid or a cook);\n(ii) the normal de re reading according to which Mary is\nlooking for a specific person and this person is either a maid or a\ncook (this reading can be generated by quantifying in the disjunctive\nnoun phrase into the translation of the sentence Mary is looking\nfor him\\(_1\\)); but also (iii) a wide scope or de\ndicto reading in which either Mary is looking for a maid, any\nmaid, or she is looking for a cook, any cook, we don’t know\nwhich of the two. The latter reading cannot be generated by the\nstandard Montagovian techniques. To capture these readings Rooth and\nPartee (1982) proposed a dynamic analysis of disjunction, while Winter\n(2000), building on Larson (1985), proposed a syntactic account where\nor can move to various positions correlated to the positions\nwhere overt either can occur. \nThere are various conclusions one normally draws from the assertion of\na disjunctive sentence like\n (25): \nSince only (25a) follows from the classical truth-functional account\nof disjunction, there seem to be a divergence in meaning between\n\\(\\vee\\) from classical logic and its natural language counterpart.\nGrice influentially argued that the assumption that such divergence\ndoes in fact exist is a mistake originating “from inadequate\nattention to the nature and importance of the conditions governing\nconversation” (Grice 1989: 24). \nExpanding on parts of Grice’s celebrated argument (Grice 1989:\n44–46), suppose one would propose to analyze or in such\na way that not only (25a) would logically follow from\n (25)\n but also (25b) and/or (25c). A major problem for such a strong\nanalysis of or is that it would fail to account for the fact\nthat both the exclusive and the ignorance inferences are easily\ncancellable. One can say Mary invited John or Bill or both\n(cancellation of exclusive inference), or The prize is either in\nthe attic or in the garden. I know that because I know where I put it,\nbut I am not going to tell you (cancellation of ignorance-modal\ninference, from Grice 1989: 45). A strong theorist could then respond\nthat there are two senses of or, a strong one and a weak\n(truth-functional) one, with the latter employed in the previous cases\nof cancelation. But as Grice replied,  \nif or is supposed to possess a strong sense, then it should\nbe possible for it (or) to bear this sense in a reasonably\nwide range of linguistic settings, for example it should be possible\nto say It is not the case that A or B where we are denying\nthat \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) (in the strong sense of or). (Grice\n1989: 45) \nThat this is not possible is illustrated by the oddity of the\nfollowing two cases: It is not the case that Mary invited John or\nBill, because she invited both or It is not the case that the\nprize is either in the attic or in the garden, because I know that it\nis in the garden. Since strong senses of or seem to be\nrestricted to “unenclosed” uses for which an alternative\nexplanation is available, Grice’s conclusion is that only\n (25a)\n should be taken as part of the semantic contribution of the sentence\n(what is said). The exclusive and ignorance inferences in\n (25b)\n and\n (25c)\n are merely pragmatic effects (conversational implicatures) which\nderive from interactions between a weak (truth-functional)\ninterpretation of or with general principles of\nconversation. \nOn Grice’s account, conversation is a purposeful and cooperative\nenterprise governed by what he calls the Cooperative Principle: \nSubsumed under this general principle, Grice distinguishes four\ncategories of more specific maxims, including the maxim of Quantity\n(here simplified). \nConversational implicatures are pragmatic inferences arising from the\ninterplay between basic (weak) semantic content and these principles\nof social interaction. A speaker conversationally implicates what she\nmust be assumed to believe in order to preserve the assumption that\nshe is adhering to the CP and maxims. \nGricean reasonings leading from the assertion of a disjunction to the\nignorance and exclusive inference can be summarized as follows: \nThe assumption in\n (27)\n that the speaker must be opinionated about the conjunctive statement\nis however problematic. Given that the use of or implicates\nthat the speaker doesn’t know which, why should there be any\npressure to think that the speaker would know both if it were true? A\nnumber of authors have indeed argued that Gricean implicatures are\nalways epistemically modalized: so in\n (27)\n only the proposition that the speaker doesn’t know\nthat Mary is patriotic and quixotic is derivable by Gricean means\ncontra the predictions of the classical formalisation of\nGricean implicatures of Gazdar (1979) (see Soames 1982: 521 and Horn\n1989: 543). Many other attempts to formalization of (variations) of\nGricean reasonings have been proposed in the literature, including\nHorn (1984) but also the more recent Sauerland (2004), van Rooij and\nSchulz (2004) and Franke (2011). All these formalizations assume a\ntruth-functional analysis of disjunction and other connectives, as the\nbaseline for the pragmatic reasoning. In what follows we will discuss\nrecent developments in linguistic analysis of disjunction, including\nalso challenges to a Gricean pragmatic view. \nWhile the Gricean argument in the previous section quite conclusively\nexcludes that English or is ambiguous between an inclusive\nand an exclusive interpretation (contra, for example, Tarski\n1939:\n 21),[2]\n recently some linguists have observed that some disjunctive\nconstructions in languages other than English seem to force exclusive\nuses. Szabolcsi (2002, 2015) discusses the case of Hungarian\nvagy–vagy and Spector (2014) the case of\nFrench soit–soit. Russian ili–ili,\nItalian o–o, French ou –ou and German\nentweder–oder seem to behave in a similar\nfashion. These are all cases of fully-iterated disjunctions, with a\ndisjunctive particle preceding each disjunct. Note however that not\nall fully-iterated disjunctive constructions are of these kinds, for\nexample English either–or constructions are not always\nexclusive (Nobody ate either rice or beans simply means\nnobody ate either), and iterated disjunctive constructions in Sinhala\nand Malayalam are not exclusive at all (see Szabolcsi 2015). Finally\nalso Latin aut, which is often taken as a paradigmatic\nexample of exclusive disjunction (e.g., Copi\n 1971),[3]\n has been shown to have inclusive uses (at least in its not iterated\nvariant), for example Nemo timebat tribunos aut plebes (No one\nfeared the magistrates or the mob) just means no one feared\neither. See Dik (1968: 274–276) and Jennings (1994:\n239–251) for discussion and more examples. \nTo show that French soit-soit constructions tend to\nforce exclusivity inferences, while French plain disjunction\nou doesn’t, Spector discusses the following examples.\nThe reply in both\n (28)\n and\n (29)\n contradicts the exclusive inference, but at the same time asserts that\nthe first sentence is true. According to Spector, the fact that such a\nreply is infelicitous in\n (29)\n shows that the exclusive inference is obligatory in this case. \nIt is important to notice at this point that logic textbook exclusive\ndisjunction, represented as \\(\\infty\\) in the following truth table,\nwould not deliver the correct results for these constructions. \nFirst of all, it is well known that using \\(\\infty\\) would give wrong\npredictions for the cases with more than two disjuncts. For example,\n\\(\\alpha \\infty (\\beta \\infty \\gamma)\\) is true, if all disjuncts are\ntrue, but Marie ira au cinéma soit lundi soit mardi soit\nmercredi is not (see Reichenbach 1947; Simons 2000). Secondly,\nthe use of exclusive disjunction would also fail to explain certain\nembedded uses of soit-soit constructions. While\nthese constructions are ungrammatical under negation, making therefore\nhard to apply the Gricean argument of the previous section to these\ncases, they are licensed in the scope of a universal quantifier, but\nthe inferences corresponding with the exclusive reading are no longer\npresent in such cases: \nOn the other hand, Spector notices that the following would be deviant\nas a reply to (30a): \nNotice that\n (31)\n negates the exclusive (scalar) implicature derived from\n (30a)\n by Gricean reasoning using\n (32)\n as a relevant alternative: \nThe generalization suggested by Spector is then that\nsoit-soit and other iterated disjunctions\nobligatorily trigger the Gricean exclusive inferences which\nare normally optionally triggered by plain disjunction. \nAs mentioned above, besides conveying obligatory exclusive effects,\nthese iterated disjunctions are ungrammatical under negation. Let me\nconclude this section with a note on the interaction between\ndisjunction and negation. Interactions between disjunction,\nconjunction and negation in classical logic are regulated by the de\nMorgan laws. English or seems to validate the second de\nMorgan law \\(\\neg (\\phi \\vee \\phi)\\) \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) \\((\\neg \\phi\n\\wedge \\neg \\psi)\\). On its preferred reading,\n (33)\n means that we didn’t close the door and we didn’t close\nthe window. \nSentence\n (33)\n however has also a second reading, on which it means we did not close\nthe door or did not close the window, but I am not sure which. As\nSzabolcsi (2002) observed, speakers in many languages including\nHungarian, Russian, Italian and French find that their counterpart of\n (33)\n only has this second reading. On this reading disjunction scopes over\nnegation, and so Szabolcsi proposes to treat disjunction words in\nthese languages as positive polarity items, i.e., roughly, expressions\nthat cannot be interpreted (anti-licensed) in the immediate scope of a\nnegation, unless the negation is itself in a negative or more\ngenerally downward entailing (DE) context. Spector introduces a\ndistinction between local and global positive polarity items and\nargues that single disjunction in French and other languages are local\npositive polarity items (anti-licensed in the immediate scope of\nnegation, unless certain constraints are met) as Szabolcsi had\nproposed, but the iterated disjunctive constructions discussed above\nare global polarity items (anti-licensed under the scope of negation,\nhowever distant the negation is, unless certain constraints\nare met). \nWe can think of disjunction as a means of entertaining different\nalternatives. If I say either it is raining or it is snowing,\nI normally convey that both alternatives are open options for me.\nGrice, as we just saw, argued against a semantic account of such\neffects, which he labeled as the non truth-functional ground of\ndisjunction (Grice 1989). Zimmermann (2000), by contrast, proposes a\nmodal analysis of linguistic disjunction which identifies the semantic\ncontribution of or with precisely these epistemic effects\n(see also Geurts 2005 for a further development of this idea). On\nZimmermann’s account linguistic disjunctions should be analyzed\nas conjunctive lists of epistemic possibilities: \nSomeone uttering a sentence of the form “\\(S_1\\) or…or\n\\(S_n\\)” generally conveys that (i) any of the \\(S_1,\\dots,\nS_n\\) may be true (genuineness) and (ii) that between them, the\n\\(S_1,\\dots, S_n\\) covers all the relevant possibilities\n(exhaustivity). While on a standard truth-functional analysis only\n(ii) is part of the meaning of or, Zimmermann identifies (i)\nas the essential contribution of linguistic disjunction with\nexhaustivity being conveyed by intonation or other devices, for\nexample either … or. Evidence for this division of labor\ncomes from the cases of so-called “open” disjunctions,\ni.e., disjunction with a terminal rise. In the following examples\n\\(\\uparrow\\) and \\(\\downarrow\\) indicate rising and falling pitch\ncontours respectively. \nWhile the terminal fall in the closed disjunction\n (35a)\n indicates that the speaker consider her list of options to be\nexhaustive, the terminal rise in\n (35b)\n conveys the opposite effect. On Zimmermann’s analysis is then\nthe terminal fall which contributes exhaustivity and not\nor. \nThe main motivation behind Zimmermann’s modal analysis however\ncomes from phenomena of free choice. Sentences of the form “You\nmay \\(A\\) or \\(B\\)” are normally understood as implying\n“You may A and you may B”. The following, however, is not\na valid principle in standard deontic logic, e.g., von Wright\n(1968). \nAs Kamp (1973) pointed out, plainly making the Free Choice principle\nvalid, for example by adding it as an axiom, would not do because it\nwould allow us to derive \\(P q\\) from \\(P p\\) as shown in\n (37),\n which is clearly unacceptable: \nThe step leading to 2 in\n (37)\n uses the following principle which holds in standard deontic\nlogic: \nIntuitively, however,\n (38)\n seems invalid (You may go to the beach doesn’t seem to\nimply You may go to the beach or the cinema), while\n (36)\n seems to hold, in direct opposition to the principles of deontic\nlogic. Von Wright (1968) labeled this the paradox of free choice\npermissions. Similar paradoxes arise also for imperatives (see\nRoss’ paradox, introduced in\n section 2),\n epistemic modals (Zimmermann 2000), and other modal\nconstructions. \nVarious solutions have been proposed to the paradox of free choice.\nMany have argued that what we called the Free Choice Principle is\nmerely a pragmatic inference and therefore the step leading to 3 in\n (37)\n is unjustified. One argument in favor of such a pragmatic account\ncomes from the observation that free choice effects disappear in\nnegative contexts. For example, No one is allowed to eat the cake\nor the ice-cream cannot merely mean that no one is allowed to eat\nthe cake and the ice-cream, as would be expected if free choice\neffects were semantic entailments rather than pragmatic implicatures\n(Alonso-Ovalle 2006). Various ways of deriving free choice inferences\nas implicatures have been proposed (e.g., Gazdar 1979; Kratzer and Shimoyama 2002; Schulz\n2005; Fox 2007 and Franke 2011; see however Fusco 2014 for a critical\ndiscussion of pragmatic accounts to free choice). \nOthers have proposed modal systems where the step leading to 3 in\n (37)\n is justified while the step leading to 2 is no longer valid, e.g.,\nAloni 2007, which proposes a uniform account of free choice effects of\ndisjunctions and indefinites under both modals and imperatives. Simons\n(2005) and Barker\n(2010) also proposed\nsemantic accounts of free choice inferences, the latter crucially\nemploying an analysis of or in terms of linear logic additive\ndisjunction combined with a representation of strong permission using\nthe deontic reduction strategy (as in Lokhorst 2006). \nFinally Zimmermann (2000) distinguishes between\n (36),\n which, according to him, is an unjustified logical principle, from\nthe following intuitively valid principle: \nBy analyzing disjunctions as conjunctions of epistemic possibilities,\nthe correct logical rendering of\n (39)\n seems to be the following: \nZimmermann, however, actually derives only the weaker principle in\n (41)\n (under certain assumptions including his Authority principle). \\(\\Box\n\\alpha\\) should be read here as “it is certain that\n\\(\\alpha\\)”: \nAlthough Kratzer and Shimoyama, Alonso-Ovalle, Aloni, Simons and\nZimmermann differ in their solution of the free choice paradox, they\nall agree in endorsing an “alternative-based” analysis of\nor according to which a disjunctive sentence “\\(A\\)\nor \\(B\\)” contributes the set of propositional alternatives\n\\(\\{A, B\\}\\). Alonso-Ovalle (2006), for example, uses this alternative\nset in his pragmatic derivation of the free choice implicatures. Aloni\n(2007) instead assumes that modals and imperatives explicitly operate\non the alternative sets introduced in their scope. For example, on her\nanalysis, may\\((\\phi)\\) is true only if the ordinary meaning\nof may is true of all alternative propositions generated by\n\\(\\phi\\). Thus, You may go to the beach or to the cinema is\ntrue only if You may go to the beach and You may go to\nthe cinema are both true. In the following section we have a\ncloser look at this alternative-based view. \nIn the previous section, we saw that recent semantic work has argued\nthat disjunctions like “\\(A\\) or \\(B\\)” should be\ntreated as generating a set of propositions \\(\\{A, B\\}\\) rather than\nyielding the classical join of the two disjuncts. The intuition behind\nthese accounts is that the main function of a disjunctive sentence is\nto present a set of alternatives. A disjunction offers\ncharacterizations of (at least) two different possible states of\naffairs, and (under certain circumstances) asserts that at least one\nof these holds in the actual world. Besides phenomena of free choice\ndiscussed in the previous section, other linguistic facts have been\nargued to justify an alternative-based analysis of disjunction. In\nthis final section, we first introduce the recent inquisitive\nsemantics as an example of an “alternative-based” system\nwith a fully developed logic, and then briefly discuss these further\nlinguistic motivations. \n(a) classical \n(b) inquisitive \nFigure 1. \\((p \\vee q)\\) in classical\nlogic and in inquisitive logic. \nIn standard logic-based analyses of linguistic meanings, the\nsemantic content of a sentence \\(\\phi\\) is defined as the set\nof evaluation points which verify \\(\\phi\\). Normally, evaluation\npoints are identified with possible worlds and so the semantic content\nof a sentence is identified with a set of possible worlds (a\nproposition), those worlds in which the sentence is true. In\ninquisitive semantics, instead, evaluation points are not worlds, but\ninformation states, which are defined as sets of possible worlds\n(those worlds compatible with the information encoded in the state).\nThe semantic content of \\(\\phi\\) is then inquisitively identified with\nthe set of states which support \\(\\phi\\), thus a set of sets\nof possible worlds, rather than a set of possible worlds. The original\nmotivation for this move was to arrive at a uniform notion of semantic\ncontent which would work for both declarative and interrogative\nmeaning (see Ciardelli, Groenendijk and Roelofsen 2015), since the\nlatter are standardly characterized as sets of propositions, rather\nthan as sets of possible worlds (see the entry on\n questions).\n The inquisitive move of taking states as evaluation points rather\nthan worlds has important consequences for disjunction. The\ninquisitive clause of disjunction reads as follows: \nThe interpretation of the connective is given in terms of support in\nan information state (rather than truth in a world). For a disjunction\nto be supported in a state, at least one of the disjuncts should be\nsupported, where an atomic sentence is supported in a state \\(s\\) iff\nit is true in all worlds in \\(s\\). Fig. 1a and b from (Ciardelli and\nRoelofsen 2011) illustrates how the resulting characterization of the\nsemantic content of disjunctive sentences crucially differs from the\nclassical characterization. These figures assume a propositional\nlanguage with only two atoms \\(p\\) and \\(q\\); world \\(11\\) makes both\n\\(p\\) and \\(q\\) true, world \\(10\\) makes \\(p \\) true and \\(q\\) false,\net cetera.\n Figure 1a\n depicts the classical meaning of \\((p \\vee q)\\): the set of all\nworlds that make either \\(p\\) or \\(q\\), or both, true.\n Figure 1b\n depicts the semantic content associated with \\((p \\vee q)\\) in\ninquisitive semantics. Only the maximal states supporting the\ndisjunction, the so-called alternatives, are depicted. A\nstate \\(s\\) supports the disjunction if and only if it is included in\neither of these alternatives. The semantic content of \\((p \\vee q)\\)\ncontains then two alternatives. One alternative is made up of all\nworlds that make \\(p\\) true, and the other of all worlds that make\n\\(q\\) true. \nFrom a logical point of view, inquisitive logic can be axiomatised by\nexpanding intuitionistic logic with the Kreisel-Putnam axiom scheme\n\\((\\neg \\phi \\to (\\psi_1\\vee \\psi_2)) \\to (\\neg \\phi \\to \\psi_1) \\vee\n(\\neg \\phi \\to \\psi_2)\\) and the double negation axioms restricted to\natoms (Ciardelli and Roelofsen 2011), and so is one of the\nintermediate logics between intuitionistic and classical logic (see\nthe entry on\n intuitionistic logic, section 6.1).\n As in intuitionistic logic, in inquisitive logic LEM is not provable\nand the disjunction property holds (\\((\\phi \\vee \\psi)\\) is\ninquisitively provable iff \\(\\phi\\) is inquisitively provable or\n\\(\\psi\\) is). From a model-theoretic point of view, LEM is not\ninquisitively valid because both \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\neg \\phi\\) may fail\nto be supported in a state that represents ignorance with respect to\n\\(\\phi\\). Recall that the main motivation behind inquisitive logic is\nto capture both informational and inquisitive content of sentences.\nIntuitively, \\((\\phi \\vee\\neg \\phi)\\) is not valid because while\ninformationally vacuous, it can still raise an issue, namely the issue\nwhether \\(\\phi\\) is the case or not and, therefore, it is not trivial\nfrom an inquisitive point of view. \nFrom an algebraic perspective, as we saw in\n section 3,\n there is a long tradition in natural language semantics that analyzes\ndisjunction words as expressing a join operator in a Boolean algebra,\nwhich, at the sentential level, delivers the least upper bound of the\ntwo disjuncts with respect to classic entailment. Recent work showed\nthat alternative-based systems don’t need to abandon the elegant\nuniform algebraic perspective of the classical analysis: while\nclassical entailment gives rise to a Boolean algebra, inquisitive\nentailment gives rise to a complete Heyting algebra, with meet, join,\nand relative pseudo-complement operators (Roelofsen 2013). Thus if we\nidentify disjunction with the join operator in such a Heyting algebra,\nthis automatically generates the desired cross-categorial,\nalternative-based notion (Ciardelli and Roelofsen 2015). \nA number of linguistic phenomena have been argued to justify an\nalternative-based analysis of disjunction. In the previous section we\ndiscussed the case of free choice. The remaining part of this section\nbriefly reviews two additional cases: conditionals and questions. \nThe first phenomenon concerns the interpretation of disjunction in the\nantecedent of a counterfactual conditional. According to the classical\ntreatment due to Stalnaker (1968) and Lewis (1973), a counterfactual\n\\(\\phi\\leadsto\\psi\\) is true in a world \\(w\\) just in case, among all\nworlds that make \\(\\phi\\) true, those that differ minimally\nfrom \\(w\\) also make \\(\\psi\\) true. It is well known however that a\nLewis/Stalnaker analysis invalidates the following inference pattern\n(Fine 1975a; Nute 1975): \nfor indefinitely close \\(\\phi_1\\)-worlds may be \\(\\neg \\psi\\)-worlds\nwhile all of the much closer \\(\\phi_2\\)-worlds are \\(\\psi\\)-worlds.\nHowever, the counterfactual if Thorpe or Wilson were to win the\nnext General Election, Britain would prosper does seem to imply\nif Thorpe were to win the next General Election, Britain would\nprosper. (Fine 1975a:\n453) \nOne possible reaction would be to abandon a Lewis/Stalnaker treatment\nof counterfactuals. But another solution is to adopt an alternative\ntreatment of disjunction (Alonso-Ovalle 2006, 2009; van Rooij 2006).\nIndeed, if the disjunctive antecedent is taken to generate two\nalternatives and if verifying the counterfactual involves separately\nchecking every alternative generated by the antecedent, the problem is\navoided. \nAn alternative analysis of disjunction further allows a perspicuous\nrepresentation of the ambiguity of disjunctive questions like\n (44),\n between a polar reading (expected answers: yes/no) and an\nalternative reading (expected answers: coffee/tea) (e.g., von\nStechow 1991 and Aloni, Égré, & Jager 2013, for the\nembedded case). \nThe alternative reading, which was problematic for standard analyses\nof questions (Groenendijk and Stokhof 1984), can be easily represented\nby adopting alternative/inquisitive disjunction (see\n figure 1).\n The polar interpretation naturally follows because the classical\nnotion of disjunction can be easily recovered from the\nalternative-based interpretation by adding a closure operator. \nIn English, alternative and polar readings of questions can be\ndistinguished by intonation or by using the contrastive marker\neither…or, the question Do you want either coffee\nor tea? only has a polar interpretation. Many languages including\nMandarin Chinese, Finnish and Basque can use different disjunctive\ncoordinators to disambiguate in these cases (Haspelmath 2007). These\nlanguages have two words for interrogative disjunction and standard\ndisjunction. Interrogative disjunction (e.g., Basque ala) can\nonly occur in interrogative clauses, where it forces an alternative\nreading, standard disjunction (e.g., Basque edo) can occur in\nboth declarative and interrogative clauses, in the latter case it\nforces a polar interpretation. The following Basque example from\nSaltarelli (1988: 84) illustrates: \nThe interaction between disjunctive words, questions and intonation is\nmuch more complex than has been exposed here, see Pruitt and Roelofsen\n(2013) for a description of the data and an illustration on how\nalternative-based systems can be employed to clarify these\nphenomena.","contact.mail":"M.D.Aloni@uva.nl","contact.domain":"uva.nl"}]
