Stumpf supervised\nHusserl’s habilitation thesis in Halle in 1887 and the\nlatter’s seminal work on phenomenology, Logical\nInvestigations (1900–1901), is dedicated to him in\nrecognition of his friendship and his philosophical contribution to\nthis book. Stumpf is also known as the founder of the Berlin Institute\nof Psychology, which gave rise to Gestalt psychology, another\nimportant current during the early twentieth century and whose main\nadherents were among others, his students W. Köhler, K. Koffka,\nW. Wertheimer and K. Lewin. Founder of the Phonogram Archive in\nBerlin, now under the protection of the UNESCO, he is also considered\none of the forefathers of comparative musicology and a pioneer in\nethnomusicology. He held positions in the philosophy departments at\nthe universities of Göttingen, Würzburg, Prague, Munich and\nHalle, before obtaining a professorship at the University of Berlin,\nwhere he was also rector in 1907–1908. His two main sources of\ninspiration in philosophy are Franz Brentano, of whom he was the first\nstudent in Würzburg, and Hermann Lotze, who supervised his\ndoctoral thesis on Plato (1868) and his habilitation thesis on\nmathematical axioms (1870). The philosophical work he left us is as\noriginal and as diversified as his academic and institutional\nachievements. Besides many treatises in the fields of acoustics and\nmusicology, his important contributions to the development of the\n“new psychology” and to the philosophy of the mind in\ngeneral should also be noted. His friend William James said of him in\nhis Principles of Psychology (p. 911) that he was “the\nmost philosophical and profound of all writers; and I owe him\nmuch.” His studies in the field of descriptive psychology and\nphenomenology (known as the science of phenomena) for example, are of\nparticular interest to current research in the fields of philosophy of\nmind and cognitive sciences.\n\nStumpf’s intellectual biography is rich and complex due to his\nlong university career that lasted for more than 50 years, his\nacademic achievements, and his philosophical work. To complete this\nbiographical sketch, the reader is invited to consult Stumpf’s\nautobiography (published in 1924) and Sprung’s biography,\npublished in German under the title Carl Stumpf – Eine\nBiografie (2006). \nThe two most important names associated with the young Stumpf’s\nphilosophical formation are those of Franz Brentano and Hermann Lotze.\nHis debt to Brentano is well documented in his autobiography and in\nthe three biographies, which Stumpf (1918, 1919, 1922) devoted to him\nafter his death in 1917. But opinions diverged regarding\nStumpf’s later position to Brentano’s philosophical\nprogram. Some claim that Stumpf is a truly orthodox Brentanian (K.\nSchuhmann, 1996) while others argue that Stumpf gradually distanced\nhimself from Brentano’s thinking and moved closer to that of\nLotze (Ewen, 2008 Milkov 2015). The truth must lie somewhere in the\nmiddle if we are to judge the matter in light of Stumpf’s many\ntestimonies in his biographical articles and in his substantial\ncorrespondence with Brentano where he unequivocally acknowledges his\ndebt to Brentano. \nStumpf’s debt to Lotze’s philosophy is certainly\nsignificant but it is not very well documented. Most studies on the\nrelationship between Stumpf and Lotze emphasize Lotze’s theory\nof local signs (see W. R. Woodward, 1978; Fisette, 2006, 2012; B.\nCenti, 2011) and the problem of the origins of space perception, which\nis in fact the central theme of Stumpf’s Raumbuch\n(Stumpf, 1873; M. Kaiser-El-Safti, 1994; D. Pradelle, 2015). In this\nbook, dedicated to Lotze, Stumpf offers a summary of the debates\nbetween philosophers, scientists, and psychologists on the origins of\nspace perception since Fechner. In the preface to this book, Stumpf\nexplains that his starting point is the controversy between nativism\nand empiricism triggered by Helmholtz in his Handbuch (H. von\nHelmholtz, 1910, vol. 3, § 25) while his inspiration lies in\nLotze (1852) Medizinischer Psychologie.\nLotze’s influence on the young Stumpf’s thought is not\nlimited to his doctrine of local signs as Stumpf repeatedly emphasized\n(R. Rollinger, 2008; N. Milkov, 2015; D. Fisette, 2009b). Beyond the\nquestion of influence, Stumpf assigns a central role to Lotze’s\nthought in the history of philosophy and associates him with a\nrenaissance of philosophy in the mid-nineteenth century (Stumpf,\n1907). \nFrom his two mentors Brentano and Lotze, Stumpf inherited a marked\ninterest in the history of philosophy. This interest was not strictly\nhistoriographical: his point of departure was\nBrentano’s theory of the four phases in the history of\nphilosophy, and he worked out his own philosophy of history, which\nconstitutes the basis of his diagnosis on the state of philosophy in\nthe nineteenth century, which is inseparable from the way he conceived\nof philosophy. In his first address as the rector of the university of\nBerlin delivered in 1907 under the title “Renaissance of\nPhilosophy,” exactly a hundred years after Fichte’s\n“Address to the German Nation” at the same university,\nStumpf applied this philosophy of history to the nineteenth century\nand asked whether philosophy at this time belonged to an ascending\nstage of history and whether it tended towards a renaissance of\nphilosophy. He identified two factors which marked the development of\nphilosophy during this period: the empty space left by the decline of\nspeculative philosophy of German idealism during the first half of the\nnineteenth century, and the remarkable development of psychology and\nof the physiology of senses during the second half of this century,\ndue to the works of physiologists and physicists such as Fechner,\nWeber, Hering, and Helmholtz. These two factors corresponded to two\ndivergent philosophical orientations at the time when Stumpf was\nundertaking his studies in philosophy. The first was the Kantian\ntradition in its different ramifications, including Neo-Kantianism;\nthe second corresponds to what he called\nErfahrungsphilosophie or philosophy of experience, which\nbegan with Fechner and above all with Lotze’s works on\npsychology and more particularly on the problem of space perception.\nAlthough it does not represent a homogeneous tradition, the philosophy\nof experience refers to common features of several schools and\ncurrents of thought which attempted to bring philosophy closer to\nnatural sciences, and more particularly to the “new\npsychology”, which was neglected and relegated to the background\nby the other tradition. Corresponding to these two orientations are\ntwo different ways of doing philosophy: the philosophy of experience\nstarts from below, and like any empirical science, uses the inductive\nmethod. They differ from an a priori and speculative approach\nto philosophy which favors an autocratic regime entirely disconnected\nfrom the empirical. \nAs B. Russell pointed out in his Essay on the Foundations of\nGeometry, Stumpf’s main criticism against Kant and a\npriori philosophy concerns the dichotomy between form and matter,\nmore precisely the postulate of a priori forms of thought and\nsensibility. This criticism was already clearly formulated in his\nRaumbuch, where he examined the nativism-empiricism\ncontroversy on space perception, prepared some years earlier by\nHelmholtz in the third book of his Handbuch. This controversy\nis at the origin of an important division in the middle of the\nnineteenth century within the new psychology proponents, between\nempiricism advocated mainly by Helmholtz and Wundt; and nativism\nwhich, according to Helmholtz, characterizes the works of Ewald Hering\nin physiology, the latter of which in fact exercised an influence on\nthe Brentano school and to a certain extent on Gestalt psychology.\nInstead of using Helmholtz’s terminology, as did most\nhistorians, Stumpf preferred the term phenomenology to designate the\nstudy of phenomenal experience, which occupied center stage in the\nfield of physiology and psychology. In his Raumbuch Stumpf\ntakes a stand in favor of a moderate form of nativism, according to\nwhich space is a unitary sense, its content is perceptible in an\nimmediate and direct way, and it is inseparable from sensory qualities\nsuch as color and sound. Consequently, space and color constitute one\nand the same content, of which they are partial contents or\nattributes. They are in a relation of logical dependence with the\nphenomena of which they form a part. Hence, extension and color form a\nconcrete whole which can only be separated through abstraction. From\nthis point of view, the concept of space, as any concept, draws upon\nits origin in sense perception and is, to use the Scholastic\nexpression, an abstracta cum fundamento in re. \nPhilosophy of mind or what is called descriptive psychology represents\none of the main axes of Stumpf’s program in philosophy. His\ntreatises in this domain are quite diversified, ranging from animal\nand developmental psychology to acoustic psychology and Gestalt\npsychology. Other than his Raumbuch, the book that made\nStumpf renowned in psychology is Psychology of Sound\n(published in two volumes in 1883 and 1890) which was widely received\nin Germany and England (see reviews by P. Natorp, A. Meinong, T. Lipps\nand J. Sully). In this book, as in most of his treatises on\npsychology, Stumpf’s approach is similar to that of\nBrentano’s descriptive psychology. It differs from experimental\nand physiological psychology in that it conceptually analyses and\ndescribes what physiological psychology explains through the\ndescriptive apparatus of the natural sciences such as biology or\nphysiology. Between these two branches of psychology there is a form\nof division of labor wherein the first analyses and describes what the\nother explains. However, descriptive psychology has a methodological\npriority over experimental psychology in that the analysis and\ndescription of the explanandum is a prerequisite to its\nexplanation. The two main tasks assigned to descriptive psychology are\nthe analysis and the classification of mental states (also called acts\nor mental functions). In his influential study entitled\n“Phenomena and Mental Functions,” Stumpf shows how\nphenomena are closely linked in that they form a real unity, which can\nonly be separated by abstraction. He conceives of phenomena as unitary\nwholes and not as aggregates, and claims that they are perceived as\nconcrete and unitary wholes. As such, phenomena are the contents of\nsensations that are characterized by certain properties or attributes,\nfor example extension, intensity, brightness, etc., and these contents\nof sensations are first-order phenomena as opposed to second-order\nphenomena like “mnemonic images” and phenomena such as\ncolor or sound, to the extent that they “are merely\nrepresented.” Although Stumpf rarely uses the concept of\nintentionality, one might say that mental functions are distinct from\nphysical phenomena in that they are related to their objects by\nintentional relations. \nPsychical functions have a specific structure that is characterized by\nthe distinction between the content of a function and its relation to\nan object. This relationship is characterized by the notion of\nspecific content, to which Stumpf refers with the concept of\nGebilde (product), and by the quality and matter of an act.\nIn an act of judgment, for example, the quality of an act consists in\nan affirmation or a negation, and it is characterized linguistically\nby the copula “is” or its negation. The\n“matter” (Materie) of a judgment is what remains\nwhen one disregards the affirmation and negation, i.e. the mere\ncomplex of presentations (subject and predicate without the copula).\nIn addition to its quality and matter, the judgment conveys a specific\n“formation” or product (Gebilde) that Stumpf\nsometimes calls a state of affairs. They are “correlates”\nof thought and distinguish themselves from the individual act, of\nwhich they are the content, through their objective character. All\nother functions, from the simplest to the most complex, have their\nspecific content. For example, the act of abstraction, which is\nresponsible for the formation of concepts, has a concept as its\nspecific content. In the field of more complex functions such as\nemotion, desire, and will, Stumpf maintains that we must also\npresuppose specific contents which he calls values. \nDescriptive psychology’s second task is the classification of\nacts or psychical functions. This classification is based on the\ndistinction between two classes of acts: intellectual and emotional\nfunctions. All functions that fall under either of these two classes\nhave relationships ranging from the simplest to the most complex, so\nthat functions of the second class presuppose, and are based on, lower\nlevel functions of the first class. This class of intellectual\nfunctions subsumes all acts ranging from sense perception to judgment.\nSense perception in this classification has a particular status\nbecause it gives direct access to first-order phenomena and as such it\nis the function of consciousness (attention) through which something\nis noticed or apprehended. It serves as the foundation of all\nfunctions in that it provides them with their sensory material.\nBetween perception and judgment, there is a series of intermediate\nacts: the act of presentation, which has as content second order\nphenomena, the act of abstraction and what Stumpf calls the acts of\nsynthesis, whose specific contents are sets (Inbegriffe). \nFrom the class of intellectual functions, Stumpf sets apart the class\nof feelings or emotional functions. Stumpf’s works in the field\nof emotions led to a debate with Brentano and were the subject of many\ndiscussions, particularly by the American psychologist E. B.\nTitchener. (E. B. Titchener, 1908, 1927; R. Reisenzein and W.\nSchönpflug, 1992; D. Fisette, 2013) At issue was whether the\nnature of pleasure provided by an object such as a work of art, for\ninstance, is intentional, as was the case in Brentano’s theory\nwherein it is closely related to the class of emotions, or phenomenal\nas in Husserl and the sensualist theories of James and Mach. Stumpf\nclaims that there is a specific difference between sense-feelings\n(bodily pleasure, pain, etc.) which are sensory qualities like sound\nand color, and emotions (joy, sadness, anger, disgust, etc.) which are\nintentional states directed towards states of affairs. Between\nemotional and intellectual functions, there is the same relation of\nfoundation as that between judgment and perception, since judgment, or\nmore precisely states of affairs, are presupposed by emotional\nfunctions which, although more complex, are nevertheless structured in\nthe same way. In addition to emotions, this class of feelings subsumes\nthe acts of desire and will, upon which the field of ethics is based.\nBetween emotions and the will, there is a hierarchy comparable to that\nof the class of intellectual states, with the difference being however\nthat the phenomenal basis of the class of emotional acts is nothing\nother than sense-feelings (pleasure and displeasure). Emotions belong\nto the subclass of passive feelings while desire and will belong to\nthe subclass of active feelings. Feelings are passive in that they\nhave something existent as an object (that is any object of a true\njudgment) while active feelings are related to a duty (object of a\nvoluntary act). Values are the specific content of the class of active\nfeelings (desire and will) while the contents of an emotion are\nvalues. Emotions are evaluative states concerning the content of a\njudgment and the evaluative element of emotions lies in the positive\nor negative stand taken with respect to the judged state of affairs.\nThe difference between these two classes of acts lies therefore in\ntheir quality, meaning their negative or positive stand\n(Stellungsnahme) regarding their object: affirmation and\nnegation in the case of judgment, love and hate in the case of the\nentire class of feelings. The relation of foundation between emotions\nand judgments or beliefs presupposes, on the one hand, a causal\nrelation between states of belief and valuation (or stand), and on the\nother hand, an intentional relation between the content of belief and\nthe emotion. From this point of view, jealousy, to use Stumpf’s\nexample, would be a negative stand and a valuation of the state of\naffairs that a given person possesses and which another person wants\nor covets for herself, but which she does not possess; and this state\nis caused by the belief or judgment (true) that this state of affairs\nexists (besteht). \nThe starting point of Stumpf’s classification is the cardinal\ndistinction made in Brentano’s Psychology from an\nEmpirical Standpoint between two classes of phenomena, physical\nphenomena and mental phenomena, or what Stumpf calls sensory phenomena\nand psychical functions. (R. Rollinger, 2008b) The domain of psychical\nfunctions, to which internal perception gives access, belongs to\ndescriptive psychology which constitutes the foundation of one of the\ntwo branches of Stumpf’s classification of sciences, namely the\nhuman sciences (Geisteswissenschaften). Human sciences such\nas aesthetics and ethics, are closely related to the major classes of\nthe simple functions such as the class of emotions in ethics, for\ninstance, and are defined as the sciences of complex functions.\n(Stumpf, 1906a, p. 21) The other branch is that of the natural\nsciences and it is based on physics. In the perspective of\nStumpf’s Erfahrungsphilosophie, physics takes as its\nstarting point the phenomena of external perception, and its task is\nto explain the regularity of phenomena by using the laws of physics.\nBut Stumpf is not a phenomenalist as he advocates instead a form of\ncritical realism that he conceives as the antithesis of phenomenalism\nsuch as that which he attributes to classical empiricism and to E.\nMach. Nevertheless, Stumpf agrees with the latter that all concepts,\nincluding the concept of causality, originate from the contents of\nsensory experience and are the result of a process of abstraction.\nHowever, Stumpf clearly distinguishes the question of the origins of\nconcepts, belonging to descriptive psychology, from the question of\nthe origins and justification of knowledge, which falls within the\ntheory of knowledge. This distinction is at the heart of his\nhabilitation thesis and we shall have the opportunity to return to\nthis important issue. \nFrom these two main classes, Stumpf distinguished within his\nclassification three neutral sciences whose task is to study the\nstructure of the contents of psychical functions and sense phenomena\nin general. Stumpf claims that they represent three different fields\nof research, corresponding to three distinct sciences: phenomenology\nas the science of phenomena, eidology which studies formations, and\nthe general theory of relations understood as the science of relations\nas a whole. These three new sciences are said to be\n“neutral” with regard to existing sciences and they are\n“propaedeutic sciences” in that their field of study\nrepresents the raw material and the starting point of the natural\nsciences as well as the social sciences. To use Stumpf’s terms,\nthey are the atrium and the organon of all sciences\nand of philosophy. \nWhat he calls phenomenology in his two Academy treatises of 1906 is a\nfield of study to which he dedicated many works, from his early work\non the origins of space perception up to his 1926 book on vowels and\nphonetics. The field of phenomenology in Stumpf’s sense is\nlimited to phenomena and their properties and is defined narrowly as\nthe science of phenomena. The study of formations and of objects of\nthought in general belongs to the second neutral science which Stumpf\ncalls “eidology,” an expression that he borrowed from\nHerbart. Stumpf first introduced the notion of formation\n(Gebilde) in 1902 in order to characterize the specific\ncontents of functions or what he also calls the objective correlates\nof a psychical function. Formations are contents that enter into\nconsciousness through carrying out specific functions in the sense\nthat to every class and subclass of acts there corresponds a certain\ncontent specific to each and every act. All psychical functions, from\nthe simplest to the most complex, have their specific contents:\nconcepts, states of affairs and values, to name only the most\nimportant. For example the act of abstraction, which is responsible\nfor the formation of concepts, notably the concept of space, has a\nconcept as its own specific content. States of affairs are contents of\njudgment, and they are comparable to Meinong’s\n“objectives”, Husserl’s “objectivity” or\nto Bolzano’s “proposition in itself”; they play a\ncentral role in Stumpf’s logic as we shall see later. (G.\nFréchette, 2015; A. Chrudzimski, 2015) These are\n“correlates” of thought and, in contrast to individual\nacts, they have an objective character. The objectivity of formations,\nhowever, is not to be understood in terms of intentional inexistence\n(Brentano) or in the sense of Platonic realism (Bolzano and Frege),\nbecause any formation is logically dependent of the act that produces\nit, and the existence of states of affairs is logically linked to that\nof the act of judgment. They are therefore abstracted in the sense\nthat they cannot exist independently from the acts by which\nthey are produced. The same rule can be found in the field of more\ncomplex functions such as emotions, desires, and voluntary actions,\nwhose specific contents are values. The very possibility of a neutral\nscience such as eidology shows that we can study values in themselves,\nindependently of any function; yet Stumpf claims that it is not\npossible to dissociate formations from their original functions. \nRelations form the group of objects whose study belongs to the general\ntheory of relations. This theory represents an important part of logic\nand formal ontology, and its task in fact lies in the study of the\nlaws governing the formal relations between objects and parts of\nobjects. This aspect of the general theory of relations is comparable\nto Husserl’s pure logic. The relations of structure between\npsychical functions and the hierarchy within the domain of simple and\ncomplex functions obey what Stumpf refers to as the “laws of\nstructure” between parts or aspects of a whole. Its task is to\nestablish relations between phenomena, functions, and formations and\nto investigate the origins of complex relations in simple relations,\nfixed by means of definition, and to determine the structural laws to\nwhich they obey. To these Grundverhälnisse or\nfundamental relations belong, namely, the concepts of analogy,\nequality and fusion that Stumpf examines succinctly in the second\nvolume of Tonpsychologie, as being the relations of logical\nand real dependency, the part-whole relations as well as the relations\nof real dependency between psychical functions. These relations are\nimmanent to phenomena and are noticeable directly and without\nintermediary. Sensory contents are noticed or remarked in themselves,\nand each of these relations is, to again use the Scholastic\nexpression, an ens rationis cum fundamento in re. The notion\nof fusion designates one of the forms of relations that structure the\nsensory material. It is defined as the relation between two phenomena\n(or contents of sensation) by virtue of which they do not merely form\na sum, but a whole. Stumpf argues that the elements which fuse into\nthe whole, for example quality and intensity of sounds in a melody,\nare not changed, but this relation of fusion establishes between these\ncontents a narrower unity which is perceptible as a Gestalt. To use\nthe well-known case of the melody, moments of quality and of intensity\nform in that case a unitary whole which is perceptible as a\n“quality of form,” and it is precisely the unitary\ncharacter of this perception, the fact that it is perceptible in one\nstroke and immediately as unitary form, that Stumpf tries to account\nfor with the aid of the notion of relation of fusion. \nWithin this classification of sciences, philosophy is meant to be the\nultimate science responsible for the issues common to all sciences,\ni.e. to the natural and human sciences as a whole, but which are not\nspecifically handled by any per se. That is why philosophy is\nconsidered the most general science of all sciences, and is defined\n“as the science of the most general laws of the mental and of\nthose of reality in general” (Stumpf, 1906a, p. 91). Stumpf\nreiterates this position in his autobiography: \nPhilosophy thus understood is first philosophy insofar as its main\ntask is to investigate the laws that provide the cohesion and unity\nbetween mind and nature. It is closely related to metaphysics or to\nwhat Stumpf also calls “metapsychics” to the extent that\nit presupposes psychology as much as physics. But unlike traditional\nmetaphysics, which is thought of a priori, Stumpf’s\nview of metaphysics, as he repeatedly imparted since his first\nlectures on metaphysics in Würzburg, is based on experience\ninsofar as it is continuous with the empirical sciences and proceeds\ninductively, i.e. according to a bottom-up approach. (D. Fisette,\n2015c) \nStumpf’s contribution to metaphysics has been the subject of\nrecent studies, (K. Schuhmann, 1999; D. Jacquette 2000–2001; R.\nRollinger, 2008b; R. Martinelli, 2011, 2015) and his lectures on\nmetaphysics delivered in Halle in the late 1880s has been recently\npublished. (C. Stumpf, 2015) He distinguished following Brentano four\nmain branches of metaphysics: transcendental philosophy, which focuses\non the justification of our knowledge of the external world, ontology\nwhose domain includes, in addition to the categories, the topic of\npsychophysical relations and that of causality among other things;\nthirdly, theology which is concerned with the evidence of the\nexistence of a foundation of the world, and finally, cosmology which\ndeals namely with issues related to the actual infinite. \nStumpf focuses particularly in his writings on two specific topics\nrelated to the domain of ontology (D. Jacquette, 2000–2001, R.\nMartinelli, 2015), namely the categories and psychophysical relations.\nIn Erkenntnislehre, he examines the categories of thing\n(substance), cause, necessity (legality), truth, reality, equality,\nand number (Stumpf 1939–1940, p. 13) and claims that these\nGrundbegriffe or categories have their origin in (internal\nand external) perception. This is primarily the case for the concept\nof necessity which is at the heart of his critique of psychologism.\nStumpf agrees with Hume and J. S. Mill that we cannot observe\nnecessary relations in nature, but he argues that internal perception\nprovides us with many cases of necessary relations such as\nmathematical axioms, or in the perception of three consecutive sounds\nwhere one of them is necessarily intermediate (as to the pitch)\nbetween the other two. (Stumpf, 1939, p. 48) The concept of necessity,\nas the concept of causality, is formed through a process of\nabstraction and can then be used, hypothetically, to explain natural\nevents based on causal laws. Moreover, we also find in Stumpf an\noriginal account of tropes which influenced the young Husserl. (R.\nRollinger, 2015) \nThe second metaphysical topic to which Stumpf attaches great\nimportance in his writings is that of psychophysical relations. Unlike\nmost of his contemporaries, including Brentano and Husserl, Stumpf\nunequivocally rejects the doctrine of psychophysical parallelism\naccording to which the physical and the psychological are aspects of\none and the same reality and advocates, following Lotze, a form of\ninteractionism that rejects monism in favour of dualism. The position\nthat Stumpf defends in “Leib und Seele” and in his two\nstudies on Spinoza, may be summed up by the following excerpt taken\nfrom his posthumous book: \nOne of Stumpf’s arguments in favour of interactionism and\nagainst parallelism is Darwin’s theory of evolution (Stumpf,\n1910, p. 78–79) to which he attaches great importance since the\n1880s (E. Valentine, 2000) In an article entitled “Der\nEntwicklungsgedanke in der gegenwärtigen Philosophie,”\nStumpf compares the bearing of Darwin’s theory on science to\nthat of the Copernican revolution in astronomy. (Stumpf, 1899a)\nStumpf’s interest in Darwin’s theory is clearly expressed\nin his work on psychophysical relations, the origins of music, animal\npsychology as well as in those on child development. \nIn his lecture on metaphysics as in his paper “Leib und\nSeele,” Stumpf’s main target is Mach’s phenomenalism\nand neutral monism, which amounts to reducing physical objects and\nsubjectivity to functional relations between sensations (or elements)\nand inevitably leads, according to Stumpf, to idealism and solipsism.\nStumpf published in 1919 a very interesting study on Spinoza’s\nparallelism in which he proposes an original and unorthodox\ninterpretation of Spinoza’s Ethics. He argues that\nSpinoza’s parallelism, if understood correctly, has nothing to\ndo with the psychophysical parallelism which was dominant at that time\nsince Fechner. According to Stumpf, the heart of Spinoza’s\nparallelism rests on the distinction between act (or mental state) and\nthe immanent object towards which it is directed. (Stumpf 1919b, p.\n19) This act-content parallelism has its source in Aristotle and has\nbeen inherited by Brentano and Husserl via many philosophers\nfrom Thomas Aquinas to Descartes and Spinoza. Stumpf argues that this\ninterpretation is consistent with Spinoza’s pantheism insofar as\nthe distinction between the act and its immanent content has been\ntransposed to God in Spinoza’s Ethics. For since\nGod’s intellect is considered by Spinoza as the only possible\nsubject, intentional acts and contents are then necessarily two of his\nnumerous modes or attributes. (see R. Martinelli, 2011) Despite his\ncritique of psychophysical parallelism, Stumpf advocates, like\nSpinoza, a form of pantheism that is consistent with his deterministic\nand mechanical conception of nature. In Erkenntnislehre,\nStumpf recalls that pantheism is a view that he adopted in 1876 in the\ncourse of several discussions with Brentano on theism and this was the\nposition that he already advocated in his lectures on metaphysics in\nWürzburg and later in Halle. Stumpf’s main argument against\ntheism is its inability to satisfactorily resolve the problem of evil\nin the world. However, as Stumpf pointed out in\nErkenntnislehre (1939–1940, p. 681, 798, 17), in his\nlast writings, Brentano seems to adopt a form of pantheism similar to\nthat of Spinoza. (Stumpf, 1939–1940, p. 798) \nThe recent publication of Stumpf’s habilitation thesis\nÜber die Grundsätze der Mathematik raises\nmany questions which have been the subject of recent commentaries. (D.\nMünch, 2002–2003; W. Ewen, 2008; C. Ierna, 2015).\nStumpf’s habilitation thesis focuses on the nature and origins\nof mathematical principles or axioms. Its starting point rests on the\nfollowing question: \nThe habilitation thesis is divided into two parts. In the first part,\nStumpf examines two antagonistic positions which prevailed at the\ntime, namely J. S. Mill’s empiricism according to which there is\nno knowledge that is not mediately acquired by induction, and Kantian\ntranscendentalism which claims that our knowledge of the general\nprinciples of mathematics is based on synthetic a priori\njudgments. Stumpf rejects both accounts and seeks to show, in the\nsecond part of his thesis, that axioms and mathematical propositions\nare analytic a priori; they are not acquired through\nexperience but are the result of a process of deduction from\nconcepts. \nIn the critical part of his work, Stumpf raises the problem of the\norigins of the laws and principles of logic and mathematics as\nfollows: if these principles are inductive in nature, as Mill believes\nthem to be, then they do not constitute necessary truths; if, on the\ncontrary, they are necessary truths, then the question arises as to\nwhether they are synthetic a priori judgments as Kant claims\nor analytic a priori propositions as Stumpf claims. Against\nMill, Stumpf argues that the axioms are not the result of empirical\ngeneralization based on an inductive process, and that arithmetic,\nlike geometry, is a deductive science based on a priori and\nnecessary truths, which are justified by the evidence of internal\nperception. (Stumpf, 2008, Bogen 5–4) Stumpf therefore agrees\nwith Kant that axioms are necessary truths, but he denies that they\nare based on synthetic a priori judgments. Stumpf argues\nrather that Kant’s synthetic judgments presuppose a kind of\n“mental machinery” (Stumpf, 2008, Bogen 16–3) in\norder to account for their formation, as they involve numerous\nassumptions, notably the a priori forms of sensibility,\nintuition, and Denkformen, which Stumpf takes to be mere\nconstructions. Stumpf criticizes Kant especially for the thesis\naccording to which the origins of the necessity of our knowledge of\naxioms lie in intuition, in that knowledge of mathematics then becomes\ndependent upon experience. However, Stumpf argues that intuition\nunderstood in the Kantian sense is inductive and only leads to\nconcepts and never to propositions. That is why Stumpf claims that the\nvery idea of synthetic a priori judgments is a contradiction\nin terms. Axioms and propositions are analytic judgments constructed\ndeductively from concepts. We can see that Stumpf’s fundamental\nargument against empiricism and transcendental criticism rests on the\nfundamental distinction between concept and proposition, which are of\nmajor philosophical significance in Stumpf’s subsequent work on\nthe theory of knowledge, as we will later see. In his habilitation\nthesis, Stumpf is more concerned with delimiting the field of logic\nand mathematics from that of psychology. In this regard, Stumpf\nclearly separates the question of the origins of concepts, which is a\npsychological question, from the logico-mathematical domain to which\npropositions and axioms belong. For, as Stumpf argues in his\nposthumous work, one can agree with empiricism on the psychological\norigin of concepts while acknowledging that there is a priori\nknowledge which is independent from experience. (Stumpf,\n1939–1940, p. 126) For Stumpf admits that the basic concepts of\narithmetic (the concept of number) and geometry (the concept of space)\nhave their origins in experience. In his Raumbuch, published\nthree years after his habilitation thesis, Stumpf attempts to\ndemonstrate the thesis that the concept of space has psychological\norigins. However, the position one takes on this issue is distinct\nfrom that which one adopts regarding the nature of propositions and\nnecessary truths in the logico-mathematical domain. For, in this\ndomain, one is solely concerned with axioms and propositions, which\ncan be deductively inferred, and one also assumes the origins of the\naxioms and their justification as necessary truths. Stumpf argued in\n1870 that these axioms are analytic a priori propositions and\nthat arithmetic and geometry are deductive sciences. \nThere is a remarkable continuity in the work of Stumpf regarding his\npositions from his habilitation thesis up to his posthumous work, not\nonly on the foundation of mathematics but also on the theory of\nknowledge. One of the main theses he advocates in\nErkenntnislehre is based on the distinction between the\norigins of concepts and the origins of knowledge. (Stumpf,\n1939–1940, § 1) Stumpf revisits the theme of mathematical\naxioms (Stumpf, 1939–1940, §§ 12–13) in the\ncontext of a critical discussion of Husserl’s doctrine of formal\nand regional ontologies. Stumpf’s conception of the concept of\nnumber in Erkenntnislehre is the same as the one he advocated\nin his habilitation thesis and in his Halle lectures, and\nStumpf’s position is very similar to that of Brentano and his\nstudents. (W. Ewen, 2008, p 162 f.; C. Ierna, 2015) In this regard,\nStumpf’s influence on his student Husserl’s habilitation\nthesis regarding the origins of the concept of number, including\nHusserl’s conception of symbolic presentations, is to be\nconsidered. (D. Münch, 2002, pp. 31–37) \nNow, what is the place of mathematics in Stumpf’s classification\nof sciences? This question was left open in our earlier remarks\nbecause the classification criteria we used were based on the cardinal\ndistinction between phenomena and psychical functions, which underlies\nthe main division between natural and social sciences. But as Stumpf\npointed out in his paper “On the Classification of\nSciences”, contrary to the method with which most\nclassifications that are meant to be normative proceed, a\nclassification that describes the state of a science as it is\npracticed at a given time in the history cannot rely on a single\ncriterion of classification, and its task is to show how several\ncriteria are intertwined in many ways (C. Stumpf, 1906a, p. 88). This\nis why one must rely on a new criterion based on the distinction\nbetween a priori and a posteriori methods in order\nto delineate mathematics, including geometry, from the other sciences.\nIndeed: \nThis applies a fortiori to geometry which Stumpf, unlike\nKant, refuses to ground on the concept of intuition insofar as it is\nan analytic a priori science, like any other branches of\nmathematics. The position he advocates in 1906 is therefore not\ndifferent from the one he advocated thirty-five years earlier in his\nhabilitation thesis. (Ewen, 2008, p. 157ff.) As an a priori\nscience, one could say that mathematics is actually presupposed by all\nother sciences as Stumpf suggests in referring positively to Auguste\nComte’s hierarchy of the positive sciences. (C. Stumpf, 1906a,\np. 88) For, according to Comte, the hierarchy between sciences within\nhis classification presupposes that all sciences, from physics to\nphysiology, logically depend on mathematics, that is, the most simple\nscience, and is the most autonomous with regard to all other sciences.\nIn this regard, Stumpf here adopts a position akin to that of Brentano\nwho followed Comte’s criteria on the matter of the\nclassification of sciences, with the important difference being that\npsychology replaces sociology within Brentano’s system of\nsciences and that the field of psychical functions is, according to\nStumpf, independent from all other sciences. (D. Fisette, 2015d;\n2018b) \nThe theory of knowledge occupies a central place in Stumpf’s\nphilosophy in his later works, especially in Erkenntnislehre,\nand we know that this discipline has always been at the heart of his\nteaching up to the end of his career in Berlin. We saw that Stumpf\nassociates it both with the neutral sciences and the foundation of\nknowledge, specifically with the ultimate justification of knowledge.\n(Stumpf, 1939–1940, p. 7, 124) One of the central questions of\nthe theory of knowledge is psychologism, which is the main topic in\nStumpf’s article “Psychology and the Theory of\nKnowledge.” (D. Münch, 2002; G. Fréchette, 2013)\nStumpf advocates a form of critical realism that he specifically\nopposes to Kantian idealism, and which maintains that the outside\nworld is always the object of a supposition or hypothesis. Moreover,\nhe claims that the only material that we have for formulating such an\nhypothesis are the concepts drawn from experience that enable us\n“to calculate the course of events.” One of the main tasks\nof the theory of knowledge, therefore, is to account for the most\ngeneral modes of knowledge of the outside world. (Stumpf, 1891, p.\n503) Stumpf distinguishes the theory of knowledge as a field of study\nfrom that of psychology on the basis of the cardinal distinction\nbetween the domain of concepts and that of propositions or necessary\ntruths, as elaborated in his habilitation thesis. \nInquiry on the origins of concepts, as we said, is a task specific to\npsychology. In contrast, the theory of knowledge is limited to the\nresearch and justification of “the most general and immediately\nevident truths” (Stumpf, 1891, p. 501), such as laws and axioms\nnecessary for knowledge. Yet, these axioms are nothing but\npropositions that we assume to be true and necessary, and they have\ntheir origin in the content of a specific class of psychical\nfunctions, namely judgments. Since the contents of judgments are\nformations or products (Gebilde) which, as we said, belong to\neidology, the field of research of the theory of knowledge is\ntherefore linked to that of this neutral science which also includes\nstates of affairs. One must therefore avoid confusing the question\npertaining to the nature of axioms with that of the psychological\norigins of concepts, but one can no more entirely separate the theory\nof knowledge from descriptive psychology since axioms are originally\nthe contents of a specific class of psychical functions, i.e. the\ncontents of judgments or of propositional attitudes whose\njustification is the task of the theory of knowledge. (Stumpf, 1891,\np. 495–496; 1939–1940, p 124) \nIn light of this distinction, one can better understand the\nsignificance of the debate on psychologism such as Stumpf describes it\nin his 1891 paper. Stumpf opposes two schools of thought on the\nquestion of the relationship between the theory of knowledge and\npsychology: Kantian criticism that dissociates the theory of knowledge\nfrom psychology, and psychologism which Stumpf defines in this paper\nas “the reduction of all philosophical investigation, and\nespecially all epistemological investigations, to psychology.”\n(Stumpf, 1891, p. 468) The argument in favour of psychologism boils\ndown to the idea that “knowledge is itself a mental process and\naccordingly the study of its conditions would be a psychological\ninvestigation.” (Stumpf, 1891, p. 468) Critics of psychologism,\non the other hand, argue that a psychological investigation can never\nlead to “knowledge of general and necessary truths.”\n(Stumpf, 1891, p. 469) Now since the conditions of possibility of\nknowledge, i.e. the forms of intuition and thought, are themselves\na priori and therefore not analysable (Stumpf, 1891, p. 493),\npsychology is therefore useless for Kantian criticists. \nThe position adopted by Stumpf in this debate consists in conceding to\ncriticism that necessary truths are irreducible to facts while\nadmitting, with psychologists, that psychology is essential to the\ntheory of knowledge. Hence the main mistake he attributes to\nKantianism, which consists in refusing the assistance of psychological\nresearch in the theory of knowledge. (Stumpf, 1891, p. 493, 500) The\nfield of psychology is understood here in a sense that is broad enough\nas to include sensory phenomena and mental functions because, in 1891,\nStumpf did not explicitly distinguish the field of phenomenology from\nthat of descriptive psychology. Now the main criticism he addresses to\nKant focuses on the dichotomy between form and matter, and it is\nprimarily the Kantian doctrine of phenomena (the manifold of\nintuition) that he holds responsible for its most obvious\n“mistakes.” In this article, Stumpf reiterates the main\ncriticism that he addressed to Kant in his Raumbuch, namely\n“the doctrine of space as a subjective form and the Kantian\nconception of sensations as amorphous and unstructured matter designed\nto support the synthetic and unifying activity of the\nunderstanding.” (Stumpf, 1873, p. 15 f.) \nHowever, this criticism of the Kantian theory of knowledge does not\nmake Stumpf an advocate of psychologism. For Stumpf acknowledges with\ncritical philosophy that we must maintain a strict concept of\nnecessity and thus oppose the reduction of the principles and laws of\nlogic and of science in general to simple empirical generalizations.\nStumpf here refers explicitly to J. S. Mill, and maintains that the\nlaws of nature and the principles of logic such as the principle of\nnon-contradiction, for example, cannot be obtained merely by induction\nand are irreducible as such to the process of empirical generalization\nor “an accumulation of observations.” (Stumpf, 1891, p.\n499–500) This raises the question as to what is the relationship\nbetween the position adopted by Stumpf in his 1891 article on the\ndebate on psychologism and the position adopted by Husserl and Frege\non the same issue several years later. Münch (2002, p. 50) argues\nthat Stumpf’s position not only comes close to that of Husserl,\nbut it also constitutes the background of Husserl’s critique of\npsychologism in his Logical Investigations. Ewen (2008, pp.\n13, 22) argues instead that Stumpf is closer to the\nanti-psychologistic positions of Frege. But since they do not provide\na clear definition of what is meant by “psychologism” and\ndo not clearly present Stumpf’s, Frege’s, and\nHusserl’s respective arguments against psychologism, there is no\nway to settle this debate at the moment. (D. Fisette, 2015a) \nThat being said, there are parallels that can be drawn between the\npositions of Stumpf and of Frege on the foundations of mathematics and\non psychologism. (see W. Ewen, 2008, p. 97 f.) Several attempts have\nbeen recently made to explain these parallels, and these accounts all\nfocus on their mutual relationship with Lotze during their stay in\nGöttingen in the early 1870s, while Stumpf, after his\nhabilitation, was Privatdozent (1870–1873), and Frege pursued\nhis studies in mathematics (1871–1873). Although it can be\nassumed that the two philosophers met during this period, we have no\nwritten evidence that confirms this. (W. Ewen, 2008, p. 97 f.)\nHistorical testimony does not say whether Frege attended\nStumpf’s lectures in Göttingen on Aristotle’s\nmetaphysics, which he taught for three consecutive years, or his\nlectures on “inductive logic with a particular focus on the\nproblem of natural science” that he taught during the summer\nsemester of 1873. Nevertheless, the correspondence that Frege and\nStumpf exchanged in the early 1880s seems to testify that the two\nphilosophers knew each other. In any case, an explanation of the\nelective affinities between Stumpf and Frege might be found in the\nwork of Lotze. (Stumpf, 1918, p. 7; D. Fisette, 2015a) \nStumpf did not publish any specific work on the topic of logic and\nwrote only a few pieces on language. These are however two topics in\nwhich Stumpf was very much interested. The topic of language was\ncentral in his 1876 paper on Anton Marty’s dissertation entitled\nÜber den Ursprung der Sprache (A. Marty, 1875; L.\nCesalli, 2015). Also worth mentioning is an essay on the psychology of\nmusic in England (1885) and his book Die Anfänge der\nMusik (1911) in which he discussed, in relation to Spencer and\nDarwin, the thesis of the linguistic origin of music. Finally he made\na significant contribution to the field of phonology and conducted an\nextensive research on the nature of vowels and linguistic sounds, and\nthis led to the publication of his book Die Sprachlaute\n(1926) in which he experimentally confirms Helmholtz’s\nprinciples on the theory of vowels. As to the domain of logic, there\nare many syllabi and extensive lecture notes, including those written\nby Husserl during his studies in Halle, which again show a direct\ninfluence from Brentano (K. Schuhmann, 1996, 1997; R. Rollinger,\n2015). We know that logic is closely related to Stumpf’s theory\nof relations and eidology, which are central in both his philosophical\nand empirical works. More precisely, his contribution to logic in\nthese two research areas concerns in fact the specific content of\njudgment (belief) or what he also calls states of affairs, and that\npart of the theory of relations pertaining to part-whole relations.\nThe first leads to a theory of the states of affairs while the second\nwas useful in developing a formal ontology, one that was central in\nthe logic of his student Husserl. Finally, mention should be made of\nStumpf’s publications on the relationship between logic and the\ntheory of probabilities, and his research pertaining to the\nelaboration of a theory of induction. He claimed that the application\nof probability concepts does not involve any presuppositions about the\nexternal world and the law of causality, for the calculus of\nprobability is purely a priori and is solely derived from the\nconcept of probability itself. \nRegarding his lectures on logic, while he accepted Brentano’s\nimportant distinction between what a statement expresses and what it\nmeans, he did not subscribe to Brentano’s central thesis on the\nreduction of categorical to existential statements. The meaning of a\nsentence corresponds to the content of a function, and it is distinct\nfrom the quality and matter of a predicative judgment. The quality of\nan act of judgment consists in its affirmation or negation, its\nacceptance or rejection of the matter of a judgment expressed\nlinguistically by the copula “is” or its negation. The\nmatter (Materie) of a judgment, which is provided by the\nlower level act of presentation, is what remains when one disregards\nthe affirmation and negation, i.e. the simple complex of presentation\n(subject and predicate minus the copula). In addition to its quality\nand matter, a judgment has a content and a state of affairs, the\nlatter roughly corresponding to what we call a proposition. Stumpf\nconceives a state of affairs both as a specific content of judgment\nand as its objective and necessary correlate, which is expressed\nlinguistically in “subordinate clauses” or in the form of\na “substantivized infinitive.” It therefore corresponds to\nwhat Stumpf called axioms. The truth of a statement is defined as the\ncorrespondence of the judgment quality to its content, that is, the\nproperty of a judicative content by virtue of which acceptance (or its\nopposite, rejection) is prompted by purely objective motives. This\nconcept of truth is grounded in the evidence of internal perception\n(is true what is mediately or immediately self-evident), which also\nplays a central role in his theory of knowledge. \nThe study of the structures of the contents of judgment as such, apart\nfrom its functions and contingent states, is one of the tasks Stumpf\nassigns to this part of eidology which he calls the theory of states\nof affairs. (A. Chrudzimski, 2015) One of Stumpf’s original\ncontributions to logic rests on the notion of state of affairs, which\nwas already used in the history of philosophy and especially by Lotze.\n(B. Smith, 1989, § 2) Stumpf already used this notion in his\nlectures on logic in 1888 (Q 13, p. 4), and it is now well-known that\nit has been subsequently taken over by many philosophers including\nHusserl and Wittgenstein. In 1906, Stumpf associates it with the\nconcept of formation or product (Gebilde) and applies it to\nboth intellectual and emotional functions, where in the latter case it\nis conceived as a value (also called Wertverhalt) on which\nethics and practical philosophy in general are based. These\nGebilde are objective entities that are related both to the\nconcept of objective in Meinong, to that of objectity in Husserl, and\nto Bolzano’s concept of “proposition in itself.”\n(Stumpf, 1906b, p. 30) For this student of Lotze, the doctrine of\nGebilde is not incompatible with the Platonic theory of ideas\nthough “without its metaphysical conclusions.” (Stumpf,\n1906a, p. 33) One can certainly entertain a formation such as a state\nof affairs without having it as an actual content of judgment, but it\nis then a mere abstraction. Because, says Stumpf, “the state of\naffairs cannot be immediately given for itself independently of any\nmental function, and therefore effectively. It can only be real as the\ncontent of a judgment that is actually taking place. […] So,\nfunctions (and indeed only the conscious functions which are properly\npresent) are facts immediately known, while the Gebilde are\nfacts only regarded as contents of functions.” (Stumpf, 1906a,\np. 32) Objectivism is an important issue in Stumpf’s philosophy\nsince it serves as one of his main arguments against psychologism. \nStates of affairs are, as any other formation, governed by general and\nnecessary laws, and are independent of the individual and the\ncontingent act of judging. These structural laws or axioms as he calls\nthem in his Erkenntnislehre govern relations between\nelementary psychical formations. Stumpf distinguishes between formal\naxioms, which apply to any objects, and material or regional axioms\nwhich belong to specific domains of objects such as the domain of\nphenomenology (structural relations between phenomena) and that of\npsychology (structural relations between elementary psychical\nfunctions). Of particular interest to logic are the axioms of\nconsequence (Folgerungsaxiome), which are expressed in\npropositions and which establish a relation between the premises and\nthe conclusion in terms of necessary inference. \nIn his second address as rector of the University of Berlin in 1908,\nStumpf (1910c) expressed his opposition to formalism and moral\nskepticism and argued for an ethics based on an objective theory of\nvalues. It will be recalled that values are specific contents of acts\nbelonging to the class of emotional functions or feelings and that\nthey resemble the contents of judgment that belong to the class of\nintellectual functions. Ethics, like aesthetics, is grounded entirely\non the class of feelings. Echoing Lotze’s distinction between\npassive and active feelings, Stumpf argues that emotions are passive\nfeelings as opposed to active feelings which are directed towards a\nduty, a project, or an intention to be achieved through voluntary\nactions. Values or value-feelings, which are essential for an ethics\nworthy of this name, refer to the specific contents of will or\nvoluntary actions. Moral actions, as opposed to instinctive or\nmechanical behavior, presuppose knowledge since this class of acts is\ngrounded on judgments that in turn are at the foundation of\ntheoretical knowledge. Just as true judgment, moral behavior differs\nfrom blind actions by the insight or self-evidence that is to the\ncontent of a feeling (value) what theoretical self-evidence is to a\nstate of affairs. And just as the truth in logic, goodness or what is\nworthy of being wanted or desired is based on intrinsic and objective\nvalues that are immune to any external forces. \nIn the general field of musicology, in addition to his numerous\nstudies on acoustics, which for the most part have been collected in\nhis Beiträge zur Akustik und Musikwissenschaft, and his\nbook of 1926 Sprachlaute (cf. B. Pompino-Marschall, 2003),\nthose on ethnomusicology (cf. G. Schwörer-Kohl, 2011), published\nin his Sammelbände für vergleichende\nMusikwissenschaft, whose fourth volume contains the study on\nRomanian folk music by the famous composer Béla Bartók\n(1922–1923; V. Lampert, 2008), we owe to Stumpf several studies\non the history of music. (Stumpf, 1885, 1896, 1897, 1911) In his\nautobiography, Stumpf listed his work in this field and stressed the\nimportance of his contribution in two of his works: \nHis classic work, The Origins of Music, made known notably by\nthe famous anthropologist and linguist Edward Sapir (1912) thanks to\nhis positive review of this work in 1912, has recently been published\nin English. (see E. M. von Hornbostel, 1933; M. Müller, 2003; A.\nSimon, 2000; H. de la Motte-Haber, 2011) This book is the culmination\nof more than twenty five years of empirical and theoretical research\nin the field of musicology and is divided into two main parts: the\nfirst, entitled “The Origin and Archetypes of Music\nMaking” deals with the theoretical aspects of the debates at the\ntime on this issue. Three theories on the origin of music are\ndiscussed, namely that of Darwin, that advocated independently by\nRousseau, Herder, and Spencer, and finally that of Wallaschek and K.\nBücher. All these theories are rejected in favour of that\nproposed by Stumpf in the second chapter entitled “The Origin\nand Archetypes of Singing.” Stumpf’s theory is based\nmainly on the famous concept of fusion that he developed in his\nPsychology of Sound. The third chapter entitled\n“Primitive Instruments and their Influence” traces the\nhistory of musical instruments among primitive peoples. In Chapter IV\n“Polyphony, Rhythm, and Intoned,” Stumpf examines the\nmusic of primitive peoples with regard to the forms of polyphony,\nrhythm, and the relation between song and speech. (see Deutsch, Sommer\nand Willam, 2003) The last chapter “Paths of Development”\nconsists in a study of the different stages of the development of\nmusic. The second part of the book, “Songs of Primitive\nPeoples” is a study of music among primitive peoples in\ndifferent countries of the world, and is based on several songs of\nwhich Stumpf offers the transcription and a detailed musical analysis.\n(H. Günther, 2003) \nMoreover, although Stumpf has devoted only one article specifically to\nthe theme of aesthetics, this topic is raised very frequently in his\nwork, namely in his book Gefühl und\nGefühlsempfindung which includes three of his papers on\nemotions and sense feelings (Stumpf, 1928b; C.\nAllesch, 2014, 2003). This issue led to a long discussion in his\ncorrespondence with Brentano on whether pleasure, and aesthetic\npleasure procured by a work of art, is intentional or phenomenal in\nnature. In his article “Aesthetic Enjoyment and Tragedy,”\nStumpf summarizes the problem of aesthetics as follows: \nThis action or effect (Wirkung) of the artwork is immediate\nin a way comparable, for instance, to the experience that we have of\npain, and is independent of any difference in culture, specialized\nknowledge of contemplated objects or worldview (historical, cultural\nor other). Stumpf acknowledges that sensations can act aesthetically\non a subject without any conceptual thought or representation.\nHowever, the full aesthetic sentiment is forced upon us when and only\nif sensations and combinations of sensations “are entangled in\nan act of relational thinking.” That is to say, “an\naesthetic affect presupposes a judgment on a state of affairs, on a\nfact.” (1899, p. 8) The feeling of pleasure is immediately\nlinked to an activity as sensory pleasure to sensations, but it is not\nyet an emotion in the strict sense. For there to be an emotion in the\nexperience of enjoyment (Entzücken) of a work of art,\nthe relations intuited in a unitary and immediate way must become an\nobject of consciousness, and therefore an intentional object. Hence\nthe dual origin (or source) of aesthetic experience: the first is what\nhe calls the fullness (Fülle) of the formal relations\namong the parts of a true work of art, while the second is derived\nfrom the properties of the object or, more precisely, the state of\naffairs. (Stumpf, 1899, p 8; 1924, p 54) The first source is\nphenomenological and resides in the formal relations which are given\ndirectly to consciousness. The second source is more complex in that\nit presupposes the processing of the phenomena and sensory data\nthrough judgment. (Stumpf, 1926, p. 2–3) These two sources,\nhowever, form a unitary content that can only be distinguished by\nabstraction. \nThe works and teachings of Stumpf in the field of emotions have had\nsome influence on the literary work of the young Robert Musil. We know\nthat Musil went to Berlin in 1903 to undertake his studies in\nphilosophy, physics and mathematics. In 1908, he successfully\ndefended, under the direction of Stumpf, a doctoral thesis on the work\nof Ernst Mach (R. Musil, 1908; R. Haller, 2003). Another important\naspect of their relationship concerns Stumpf’s influence on\nMusil’s literary work, which gave rise to a vast literature. One\nof the important sources of Musil’s early novels and theoretical\nfragments is the work of Traugott K. Oesterreich (1910) who wrote his\ndoctoral dissertation in 1905 under the supervision of Stumpf. Another\nsource is Stumpf’s theory of emotions, which he presented in his\narticles of 1899 and 1907 (Stumpf, 1928b) and his lectures on\npsychology given during the winter semester of 1906–1907 in\nwhich he attaches great importance to the theme of sense feelings and\nemotions. It is more than likely that Musil attended these\nlectures. \nStumpf’s scientific contribution to the field of empirical\npsychology has been in recent years highlighted by several studies. In\naddition to the numerous studies that explore Stumpf’s\nrelationship to psychologists such as Külpe (W. Baumgartner,\n1997), Herbart (M. Kaiser-El-Safti, 2009, 2010, 2011; S. Poggi, 2014),\nHelmholtz (H.-P. Reinecke, 2003) Wundt (U. Wolfradt, 2011), or to H.\nEbbinghaus (see U. Wolfradt & M. Kaiser-El-Safti (eds.), 2010),\nseveral other studies have highlighted Stumpf’s diversified\ncontribution to several sub-disciplines of psychology, including the\npsychology of sound, Gestalt psychology, animal psychology, the\npsychology of child development, etc. Stumpf’s most important\ncontribution in the field of psychology – understood in the\nnarrow sense of the science of psychical functions – is his\nPsychology of Sound published in two volumes.\n(Stumpf, 1883, 1890) The first volume deals with individual sound\njudgments while the second, dedicated to Brentano, studies the\nconsciousness of simultaneous sounds. According to his initial\nproposal, Stumpf’s project was to write two more volumes. The\nthird was to focus on musical phenomena such as consonance,\ndissonance, accords, melodies, etc., while he had planned to study\nfeelings generated by sound (Tongefühle) in the fourth.\nPart of his research on these issues was published separately in his\nBeiträge zur Akustik und Musikwissenschaft (9\nvolumes). \nThis complex and unfinished work attracted much interest at the time\nand was reviewed by philosophers such as Meinong and Natorp and by\npsychologists such as J. Sully, H. Ebbinghaus, and especially W. Wundt\nwho, in his anonymous review of the first volume of the book,\ncriticized Stumpf’s method and the hypothesis of the relativity\nof sensations to judgment. (see C. Allesch, 2003) Let us recall,\nhowever, that this book is not a phenomenological study of sounds but\nrather a study pertaining to “judgments about sounds,” and\nit belongs therefore to the field of psychology in the narrow sense.\n(Stumpf, 1906a, p. 31) Stumpf makes it clear, however, that the\njudgment in question is not categorical but it is a judgment of a\nparticular type which he calls apprehension or apperception. Stumpf\nclaims moreover that there are sensory contents which are not related\nto judgments or any other mental functions such as space as he had\ndemonstrated in his Raumbuch. (see J. Bouveresse, 2006) Two\nimportant contributions from Stumpf in this book (Kaiserl-El-Safti,\n2011, pp. 38–39) rely on the famous concept of fusion\n(Verschmelzung) by which he characterizes the phenomenon of\nconsonance, which in turn constitutes the foundation of music, and the\ntheory of relations that Stumpf develops in the first volume of this\nwork. (Stumpf, 1883, § 6) This theory of fusion led to a debate\nwith Brentano (see C. Allesch 2003, R. Martinelli, 2013) and the\nimportance of this notion in Husserl’s phenomenology is\nwell-known, particularly in relation to the latter’s conception\nof figural moments. (C. Ierna, 2009) \nIn the field of psychology, Stumpf’s name is also associated\nwith the famous case of Clever Hans, which aroused great interest in\nthe early twentieth century, and which represented a significant step\nin the development of experimental psychology. (H. Baranzke, 2001 W.\nPrinz, 2006 H. Gundlach, 2006) We know that Stumpf’s assistant,\nO. Pfungst devoted an entire book to the case of Clever Hans in which\nhe presented the results of the investigation that he and Stumpf\nconducted. (Stumpf, 1907a, pp. 7–15) Similarly, Stumpf\ncontributed to the foundation of the anthropoid station in Tenerife\nwhere Köhler (1925) conducted his well-known research on\nchimpanzees. Stumpf was also interested in other similar phenomena,\nsuch as the study of child prodigies like Pepito Arriola and many\nothers. He founded in 1901 the Society for Child Psychology and\ncontributed two studies on that topic (Stumpf, 1900, 1901) \nThe work of Carl Stumpf has aroused much interest since the turn of\nthe twenty-first century. Over the past fifteen years, in addition to\nthe publication of numerous translations and reprints of\nStumpf’s writings, several articles and books have been devoted\nto examining and evaluating the different aspects of his work. The\nrecent reception of Stumpf’s work is very diversified and it\nreflects the interdisciplinary nature of his research and his many\naccomplishments at an academic as well as an institutional level. (G.\nFréchette, 2010; M. Kaiser-El-Safti, 2011; D. Fisette\n2015a) \nAt the very end of his autobiography, Stumpf confesses that he never\nsought to establish a school and that he is grateful to those of his\nstudents who pursued their research based on their own plans in the\nsame scientific spirit. Stumpf’s words are confirmed by the\ntestimonies of many of his students who all shared this scientific\nspirit and described Stumpf as a model of precision and clarity in\nthought and observation, with a keen sense for analysis and a critical\nattitude towards his own philosophical thought. If indeed he did not\nestablish a school, he is however responsible for the formation of\noutstanding researchers and philosophers, and he has contributed\ndirectly to the development of two of the most important movements in\nGermany at the beginning of the twentieth century: Gestalt psychology\nand phenomenology. But Stumpf also counts as one of the harshest\ncritics of these two movements as evidenced in his\nErkenntnislehre, a posthumous work in which he presents the\nessential elements of his Weltanschauung and, in a sense, his\nphilosophical testament. Let us remember that this book is dedicated\nto Brentano and can therefore be considered a contribution, the last\nin importance in the school of Brentano, to the philosophical program\nof his mentor. It is not surprising, therefore, that the criticism he\naddressed to his own students in this work was mainly motivated by\nthis program. \nIn this work, he offers a remarkably penetrating analysis of the\nphilosophical project that guided Husserl in the first book of\nIdeas. From Stumpf’s perspective, the originality of\nthis new version of phenomenology in Ideas I lies less in the\naspects in which he criticizes the doctrine of the Logical\nInvestigations whereby phenomenology is defined as descriptive\npsychology than in the features by which Husserl opens up new\nperspectives with respect to descriptive psychology and phenomenology\nin Stumpf’s sense. This is the case of phenomenology understood\nas a doctrine of essences, whose aim is to ground the empirical\nsciences on the so-called regional ontologies. This endeavor belongs\nto the more general project of a general theory of science which\nHusserl worked out in this work. Stumpf understands this project as a\nwidening of Brentano’s and Lotze’s initial program which,\naccording to him, is nothing other than a regional phenomenology or\nontology in the sense of Husserl. However, he does not see any\nprogress in the idea of a “pure” or transcendental\nphenomenology nor in the postulate of a pure ego to which something\nlike a “rein Ichblick” is purported to give\naccess. For if this purity is acquired on the basis of the method of\nthe reduction, more precisely the eidetic reduction, than by\nbracketing the existence of objects, it rules out eo ipso any\npossible contribution on the part of the empirical sciences. Stumpf\nalso questions the status of sense perception and the domain of\nphenomena in this perspective given that Husserl’s\nWesensschau can only be applied to what Stumpf calls mere\npresentations or second-order phenomena. In his remarks on Stumpf in\nSection 86 of Ideas I, Husserl pointed out that the study of\nphenomena belongs to what he calls in the introduction to this work\n“eidetic psychology.” But as a science of facts and of\nrealities, this psychology falls under the reduction and does not seem\nto contribute significantly to the version of transcendental\nphenomenology put forth in Ideas I. Stumpf concludes that\nthis version of phenomenology is a phenomenology without phenomena due\nboth to Husserl’s account of phenomena and to his peculiar\nconception of (transcendental) phenomenology. (R. Rollinger, 1999,\n2008c; D. Fisette, 2015b) \nAs we said, in 1900, Stumpf established the Institute of psychology in\nBerlin which was at the origin of the original movement in psychology\ncalled Gestalt psychology. With the exception of Max Wertheimer, who\ndid his dissertation in 1904 under the direction of Külpe in\nWürzburg, the other psychologists of the Institute of Berlin,\nWolfgang Köhler, Kurt Koffka, Kurt Lewin, Egon Brunswik and\nAdhemar Gelb undertook their apprenticeship in psychology and\nphilosophy under Stumpf’s supervision. This is also the case of\nRobert Musil and C. von Allesch. However, although the Gestaltists in\nBerlin had initially adopted Stumpf’s phenomenological\nstandpoint, they departed significantly from Stumpf’s conception\nof the mind. (M. Ash, 2000–2001, 1998; F. Toccafondi, 2009).\nDespite Stumpf’s significant contribution to the debate on the\nnature of Gestalt and psychology in general, he was targeted by\nKöhler (1913) in his classical paper on the constancy hypothesis,\nand which is sometimes considered to be the very beginning of Gestalt\npsychology. Stumpf replied to this objection in his posthumous book by\nsaying that Köhler was wrong in eliminating founding contents in\nfavour of the constancy hypothesis. The following excerpt from his\nbook Erkenntnislehre summarizes the main issues in this\ndispute: \nIn summary, Stumpf claims that, in this conception of Gestalt,\n“the forest hides the trees.” For Stumpf maintains that\nthe whole is prior to its parts and that each part, in virtue of its\nnature, is conditioned by the whole. However, he cannot allow the idea\nthat one may perceive a Gestalt without presupposing a founding\ncontent or what he also calls first-order phenomena such as, for\ninstance, color or sound. Stumpf’s conception of Gestalt is\ncloser to that of Bühler (D. Fisette, 2015c) in that it consists\nin a “complex of structural relations.” (Stumpf, 1939, p.\n246) Another quote from his posthumous work summarizes perfectly the\ntheoretical issues at stake in Stumpf’s criticism of his\nstudents: \nAccording to Stumpf, the cost for adhering to the native theory is\nnothing less than to abandon the very principles of descriptive\npsychology and phenomenology. Moreover, besides the difficulties\nmentioned by Stumpf in this passage, Gestalt psychology conveys\nphilosophical presuppositions which are at the heart of the dispute.\nThe first is a form of sensual naturalism that Stumpf rejects. The\nsecond assumption concerns the metaphysical question of psychophysical\nrelations in Köhler’s work and the attempt to introduce the\nconcept of Gestalt in the field of physics. Stumpf believes that\nKöhler’s isomorphism thesis, which postulates the existence\nof an identity relation between the structural laws of the psychical\nworld and that of the physical world, presupposes the theory of\npsychophysical parallelism, which Stumpf rejects as well.","contact.mail":"fisette.denis@uqam.ca","contact.domain":"uqam.ca"}]
