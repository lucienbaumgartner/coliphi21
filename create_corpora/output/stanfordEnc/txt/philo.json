Whether he really was a\nphilosopher is a question still debated at length. At the beginning of\nthe Roman Empire, especially for the Stoics and the Cynics, the\nfundamental task of a philosopher was the construction of his own\nself. A man who sought to improve himself had to first regulate his\nown nature, controlling his passions and emotions and eliminating any\ngap between theory and practice. He was thus supposed to approach the\nperfection of a god. To the exact contrary of this attitude,\nPhilo’s purpose was to prove the oudeneia, the\nontological nothingness of human beings. In his opinion, the only way\nto have real existence was to admit that one is nothing without the\nhelp of God, who is the source of freedom, logos\n(reason) and consciousness. He aimed\nto be the best possible servant of the Revelation and of the text that\nforms God’s Word. He accepted contradiction as a normal means of\nexpression, which serves as a possible explanation for the disordered\nimpression of his treatises. He was, however, neither ignorant nor\nconfused; rather, he consciously deconstructed the rationalist\npatterns of Greek thought, which in his opinion served to affirm the\nprimacy of the self. He did not want to get rid of logos\nbut rather to place it clearly\nwithin the unique perspective of divine transcendence. Though he felt\ngreat admiration for Plato, his transcendence was not exactly\nPlatonic, but rather of a God both absolutely unknowable yet very\nclose to mankind. Nikiprowetzky (1977) inaugurated a new era in\nPhilonian studies by affirming the centrality of the Law in the\nPhilo’s thought. In this perspective, philosophy was the servant\nof Revelation, a way to lend his exegesis a more universal impact by\ndrawing upon the categories of Greek logos\nOne of the purposes of our\npresentation will be to give a plausible evaluation of the many images\nand interpretations of Philo that we find in Philonian\nscholarship.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is impossible to give precise dates for Philo’s birth. The\nconsensus is that he lived between the end of the first century BCE\nand the middle of the first century CE, during a period of acute\nagitation and interethnic tensions in Alexandria. The Romans, with\ntheir universal ambitions, had replaced the Macedonians, leaving to\nthe Greeks only the pride of their identity and some fiscal\nadvantages. The Greeks in turn pretended to be the only citizens of\nthe city of Alexandria, refusing citizenship to the Jews with very few\nexceptions, among which was Alexander the Alabarch (tax collector),\nPhilo’s brother. Alexander’s son, in turn, became one of\nthe famous apostates in the history of Judaism, becoming prefect of\nEgypt in 66–69 CE and serving as Emperor Titus’\nsecond-in-command at the siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE. The history of\nthe apostate within his family was certainly a problem for Philo, who\ntried to raise the issue with his nephew in the (De\nprovidentia 2 and in the De\nanimalibus. Though he never\nspecified his own political status, Philo was likely a citizen of this\nprestigious city. Finally, the native Egyptians were despised by both\nGreeks and Jews. The Egyptians didn’t all remain passive,\nhowever; Manetho (Stern 1974, texts n.19–21), an Egyptian\npriest, wrote a parody of the Exodus, transforming the liberation of\nIsrael into the ignominious expulsion of a disabled and dishonest\npeople. This topos won great favor among Greek intellectuals\nlike Philo’s contemporary, Apion, against whom Flavius Josephus\nwrote his famous apology of the Jewish people. This tension erupted\ninto the Alexandria riots of 38 CE, the first major pogrom in the\nhistory of Jewish people, leading in turn to the installation of a\nghetto, murders, tortures, humiliations, and mockeries of Agrippa I,\nthe king of Judaea. We must keep all this in mind in order not to\nimagine Philo merely as a scholar burrowed away in the Great Library,\nnor as a rabbi lecturing peacefully in the synagogues. In Spec.\n3.1, he wistfully remembers a\ntime when he could devote himself to study and contemplation, probably\nbefore the disasters of 38 CE:  \nThere was a time when I had leisure for philosophy and for the\ncontemplation of the universe and its contents, when I made its spirit\nmy own in all its beauty and loveliness and true blessedness, when my\nconstant companions were divine themes and verities, when I rejoiced\nwith a joy that never cloyed or sated.  \nBut just after, he evokes the violent envy of those who plunged him\n“in[to] the ocean of civil cares”, likely an allusion to\nthe many difficulties created by the hostility of Greeks and Egyptians\n(Spec. 3.1). Even before this violence, however, the\nenvironment he faced was a hostile and resentful one. Philo considered\nthe Egyptians, his “ultimate other” (Niehoff 2001), the\nmost disgusting of polytheists because of their zoolatry. He was full\nof reverence and fear toward the Romans, or at least pretends as such\nin his two books on the pogrom of 38 CE: the In\nFlaccum, which is against the\nRoman prefect in Alexandria at the moment of the pogrom, and the Legatio\n(Smallwood 1961) in which he\nnarrates his own experience of the embassy sent to the Emperor\nCaligula by the Jews of Alexandria after the riot. Recently Niehoff\nstressed the idea that Roman culture had become an important element\nof Philo’s identity. Nevertheless, he was first and foremost a\nJew of the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Bible (ca\n270 BCE). That is to say, however distinctive his views, he was a\nsincerely pious Jew. He knew very little Hebrew, though he went to\nJerusalem to pray and offer sacrifices in the Temple (Prov.\n2.107), and he thought that the\nBible written in Greek was perfectly equivalent to the Hebrew one\n(Mos. 2.40). His\npaideia or Greek education was excellent, both in philosophy\nand the liberal arts, as he says in Congr.\n79–80:  \nFor instance when first I was incited by the goads of philosophy to\ndesire her I consorted in early youth with one of her handmaids,\nGrammar, and all that I begat by her, writing, reading and study of\nthe writings of the poets, I dedicated to her mistress. \nBy this period in Alexandria, the spirit of mutual comprehension that\nmarked the beginning of the Ptolemaic epoch (ca 332\nBCE–30 BCE) had faded away. In his own person, Philo brought\ntogether two elements that the Greek elite now held to be\nincompatible: paideia, Greek education, and Judaism. He\nstudied and commented on the Bible in the synagogues, which he\ndescribes as “schools of virtue”. His understanding of\nrhetoric was not merely theoretical. He was probably a great orator.\nThe addressees of his treatises were foremost the Jews, both believers\nand unbelievers. He may have had a second, much more hypothetical,\naudience in mind as well: Greek philosophers and intellectuals more\ngenerally. However, to the best of our knowledge, this latter group\npaid scant attention to Philo’s writings. In the fragments of\nGreek and Roman writers carefully collected by Menahem Stern (1974),\nwe find two kinds of Greek reactions towards Judaism. In the earlier\nperiod, they received some sympathy from philosophers; Theophrastus,\nthe main disciple of Aristotle, writes in a famous fragment that Jews\nare “philosophers by race”, saying about them:  \nthey converse with each other about the deity, and at night-time they\nmake observations of the stars, gazing at them and calling on God by\nprayer. (quoted in Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica,\n40.3.1–3)  \nFrom the end of the second century BCE, however, many philosophers\nwere active propagandists for\n antisemitism.[1]\n One might have expected that Stoicism, with its cosmopolitism and\nrational humanism, would have avoided this kind of attitude. In fact,\nas we can see in Posidonius, Seneca, or Chaeremon, Stoic antisemitism\nwas a product not of racism, but of an erroneous understanding of\nrationalism and universalism. For these men, the Jews were a very\nsuperstitious nation, blemished by strange habits and strong animosity\ntowards foreigners. Except for the case of Varro, the Roman scholar of\nthe first century BCE who appreciated Jews for their refusal of\nimages, it would be impossible to give an example of a Greek or Latin\ntext of this period showing sympathy or even interest toward the Jews.\nThis was a condition of which Philo could not have been ignorant. In\nthe background of his life and of his work lay an antisemitism growing\nmore and more violent. In contrast to Flavius, who decades later wrote\nthe Against Apion in order to\nrefute Greek antisemitism, Philo seems to have preferred to extol the\nvirtues of Judaism than to fight against the adversaries of Jews, as\nwe can see in the extant fragments of his Hypotetica. \nPhilo’s work does not form a well-organized corpus. During\nPhilo’s time, the work was larger than the corpus we now have.\nThe relation of Philo to the Hebrew exegetical traditions of his time\nis an important and controversial question. One of the major paradoxes\nfor his posterity is that his work was ignored by Jews and saved by\nChristians, some of whom thought that he was himself a Christian. In\n233 CE the entire corpus was brought to Caesarea, a city that became\nthe main center of its transmission, though some papyri suggest the\ncirculation of at least some of his treatises in Egypt. The more or\nless generally accepted classification is that of Massebiau (1889),\ncompleted by Cohn (1899). It is divided into five principal\ncategories: \nNo definite chronology of the works was established until the very\nrecent book of Niehoff (2018). Philo gives very few hints regarding\nhis process of composition, offering only a few remarks about the\nstructure and divisions of his treatises. Regarding the strange fact\nthat these Greek treatises bear Latin titles, Monique Alexandre (1997)\nconducted a complete study in which she examines a complex\nphilological process from Antiquity to the nineteenth century through\nthe humanists of the Renaissance and their immediate successors. \nOn the meaning of philosophy for Philo, see\nsee the supplement on \n The Meanings of Philosophy in Philo of Alexandria.\n His five philosophical works are De\nprovidentia 1 and 2, De\nanimalibus, De\naeternitate and Quod omnis\nprobus. The two latter works are the only ones for which\nwe have Greek texts. With the exception of a few rare references to\nthe Bible, these texts could well have been written by a pagan\nphilosopher. This is why some scholars thought they were products of\nPhilo’s paideia, his classical Greek education. Today,\nthere is a tendency to believe that Philo’s extant texts were\nwritten near the end of his life. If this is the case, the reason for\nwriting, in the atmosphere of great cultural and political rivalry of\nthe epoch, could have been to demonstrate that a Jew was as able to\ncompose a philosophy as “pure” as any Greek. In any case,\nthe most discussed problem today is the skepticism regarding the\nauthenticity of the De\naeternitate, the treatise in which we find the most\nexplicit references to philosophy and philosophers. Since\nRunia’s seminal article in 1981, a majority of scholars seems to\nhave distanced themselves from thinking the text is inauthentic. For\nRunia, there is no contradiction in the fact that Philo goes against\nthe biblical tradition and defends the eternity of the world not only\nin the future but also in the past. The second part of Philo’s\ntreatise, now lost, would have contained the refutation of this\nunorthodox—at least from a Jewish point of view—thesis. It\nis probable that Philo, who seems to have had good knowledge of\nskeptical methods, was trained to argue both pro and\ncontra of a thesis, a dialectical technique of which the\nDe aeternitate is probably the\nbest illustration. We will return to the question of the authenticity\nin the supplemenary document \n  About the De aeternitate and the De providentia. \nWe have little information about Jewish intellectuals in the\nHellenistic epoch. One of our main sources is the Sentences\nof Pseudo-Phocylides, most\nlikely written in Alexandria by a Jew. They show an interesting mix of\nJewish and Greek elements: an absence of attacks against polytheism,\nsome popular Stoic themes, and a rather soft affirmation of the\nmonotheistic faith. It is not easy, however, to date these Sentences.\nThe most probable date\nwould be somewhere between 30 BCE and 40 CE, but other dates are\npossible. Regardless, the Sentences\nprovides an image of what\ncould have been a Jewish openness towards pagan culture if relations\nwere calmer. According to a well-attested tradition, some Jews posited\nthat Plato had taken his inspiration from Moses, an idea that seems to\nhave been popularized by Aristobulus of Paneas, a Jewish philosopher\nwho lived in the first half of second century BCE. Philo, who lived in\na more unstable period, employs this kind of assertion with prudence\n(Spec. 2.164–167). He\nhimself sometimes alludes to his immediate predecessors, which is the\ntopic of Goulet’s book (1987). Goulet’s central thesis is\nthat the primary source of Philo’s allegories was a Jewish\ncommentary that used Stoic methods of interpretation to attempt a\nwholly rationalist exegesis of the Bible devoid of any notion of\ntranscendence. In fact, there is only one clear allusion to these\nphusiologoi, i.e., rationalist allegorists. It is likely that\nin Alexandria there were Jews who attempted to interpret the Bible as\nthe Stoics had interpreted Homer (Niehoff 2011). It is unclear whether\ntheir interpretation was integrated into a comprehensive system of\nrationalism. The allegoric interpretation did not prevent Stoics from\ndefending divination, a practice that was considered absurd by their\nopponents. One could add that this evolution towards a more religious\ncast of mind was not a distinctive characteristic of Philo, but rather\na hallmark of the Middle-Platonist period as a whole. \nNamed references to philosophers in Philo’s work are rather\nrare, and often the cited names are not those that one would expect.\nFor example, he never mentions Posidonius, one of the greatest names\nof Stoicism, who was the first to attempt a reconciliation of at least\nsome Stoic and Platonic themes. There are reasons to think Philo read\nthis Rhodian philosopher, but he is silent about Posidonius. One could\nsurmise that his clearly anti-Jewish position was one possible reason\nfor Philo’s silence. However, Philo is also silent regarding\nthinkers of the New Academy, Arcesilas and Carneades. He was clearly\nacquainted with these Academics, since there are some rather clear\nallusions in his work to their brand of skepticism. It is therefore\ncurious that he gives the first version of the Skeptical tropes\nwithout any allusion to Aenesidemus, who developed them a century\nbefore. Leaving aside the contested De\naeternitate, we notice that Philo fails to mention\nAristotle even once. While Stoicism plays a leading role in most\nPhilonian treatises, we only find four allusions to Zeno, the founder\nof the doctrine. They are all in the Probus,\na treatise with strong Stoic\nfeatures. There is only a single mention of Epicurus, in Post.\n2. Plato is mentioned twice\neach in the De opificio and the\nDe uita contemplativa, and once\nin the Probus. Only three\nmentions of Socrates are found, but surprisingly, the presocratic\nthinkers are quoted much more than one would have thought: fourteen\nreferences to Pythagoras (with some uncertainties, since some of them\nare to be found in fragments), six to Heraclitus, and one each to\nAnaxagoras and Democritus. The De\naeternitate is striking because Aristotle is mentioned\nfour times. In this treatise, Philo cites a book written by the\nPythagorean Ocellos of Lucania, who established the eternity of the\nworld in a way that Philo seems to find satisfactory. This, notably,\nis the only time when he mentions a specific text and explicitly\naffirms having read it. \nOne might wonder whether there is a logic to Philo’s explicit\nreferences to philosophers. \nSeveral elements point us toward a more complete understanding. First,\nPhilo evidently prefers indirect allusions to direct citations.\nPhilosophical concepts are necessary to the elaboration of exegesis,\nbut too many precise mentions of philosophers would have presented\nPhilo as subordinate not to the Word of God but to the doctrines of\nphilosophers. He is still more silent about the great rabbis he would\nhave certainly met in Alexandria and perhaps in Jerusalem. In his\nphilosophical references, it is clear that he prefers to evoke the\npresocratic thinkers and the classical period of philosophy than the\nHellenistic one. This is paradoxical since he was deeply marked by\nHellenistic philosophy, which was the natural environment of his\neducation. It must be added that his prose is also generally\nclassical, reluctant to admit neologisms and technical vocabulary. He\ncertainly wanted to appear in all areas a man of tradition. \nDid Philo think that philosophy was a Greek monopoly, only shared with\nsome Jews? \nIn recent years, the temptation has been great among some scholars to\nimagine that he had at least some knowledge of non-Greek thinkers such\nas Cicero and Seneca. The problem remains that we have no evidence of\nthis hypothesis. Philo never evoked Roman philosophers, so we cannot\npass beyond statements of probability. More generally, what can be\nsaid about Philo’s attitude towards “barbarian”\nwisdom can be summarized in three points: \nJewish wisdom surpasses all other wisdom, both Greek and barbarian,\nbecause it is the only one inspired by God. In Mos.\n2.12, Philo makes no attempt to\nhide that when the Bible was first translated into Greek, the Word of\nGod was considered by many an expression of barbarian wisdom. The\nSeptuagint is implicitly presented as proof that the distinction\nbetween Greek and barbarian could be abolished, though for Greek\ncivilization this distinction had great ontological weight. \nEven Greek education, despite its exceptional prestige, is unable to\nprovide access to the truth. A learned man according to the criterion\nof the paideia is no more able than anyone else to say what\nthe world truly is. \nPhilo did not deny that barbarians were able to create sophisticated\nforms of sciences and culture. Despite his own contempt for the\nEgyptians, he stresses that Moses himself received an education in\nwhich Egyptian sciences were included. Furthermore, he argues that\nmany barbarians, though untutored in philosophy, have a natural\nintuition of how to live in agreement with virtue. In Somn.\n2.56, the Indian ascetics (“gymnosophists”) appear as the\nbarbarian form of the Cynic life, lacking any form of luxury or\nmaterial comfort, and in Probus\n96, the letter of the ascetic Calanos to Alexander [now known\nto be fake] provides the best evidence that some barbarians could\npractice a perfectly philosophical life without ever having received a\nGreek education. \nThrough the many studies Manuel Alexandre (1999) devoted to\nPhilo’s rhetoric, we can more precisely gauge Philo’s\nposition in this central debate within Greek culture: the conflict\nbetween philosophy and rhetoric, or better, between philosophers and\nrhetors. Philo displays a sound knowledge of rhetoric. His affinity\nwith Platonism impelled him to address very harsh critics of the\n“lesser” rhetoric, that of sophists, who represent the\nopposite pole of his own thought. Sophisteia, sophistry, is\nin Philo a frequent concept attached to a range of negative meanings.\nBut, as in Plato (where Socrates opposes the idea of a greater\nrhetoric to Gorgias’ lesser rhetoric in the Phaedrus),\nin Philo we see the\npossibility of a positive use of rhetoric. For Philo, rhetoric is\nneither an activity nor an abstract ideal but a human reality, the\nnature of which is laid out in the Bible. Moses is the man who saw God\nin the Sinai, but he by himself would have been unable to speak to\nPharaoh and persuade him to let his people go. Moses needed the\npresence of Aaron in order to obtain what he sought. Moses represents\nthe metaphysical truth, Aaron its implementation in reality, akin to\nthe two faces of logos: while the\nlogos prophorikos is that of communication, the logos\nendiathetos is the internal world of thoughts, and each is\nimpossible without the other. It can be added that Abraham is said by\nPhilo (Mut. 66) to have been\nthe “father of the sounds”, a strange expression that,\nalongside many similar allusions to music, shows that Philo was not\nthe philosopher of sight alone. Another path of research is that of\nparrêsia, a complex term of political origin that\nappeared in the context of the Athenian democracy. In literary and\nphilosophical texts, it means freedom of speech, frankness, and\nhonesty. For Philo, however, parrêsia is neither a\npolitical ideal nor an individual achievement, but something given by\nGod; and it must be used without harming relatives or friends. \nPhilo had no philosophical affiliation. To say that he was a\nPythagorean, a Platonist, or a Stoic would have been for him to admit\nthat he sought truth in spaces outside the Bible. Was he an Eclectic?\nThe concept of eclecticism is a complicated one. If it means that\nPhilo used different philosophers as sources of inspiration and\nexpression in order to elaborate his work, this cannot be denied. On\nthe other hand, if one means that he built a specific philosophical\nidentity for himself by associating with different doctrines, that\nseems far from the truth. It would mean that he was in search of an\nautonomous ego, a perspective at odds with his denial of the\npossibility for an individual to exist truly on his own, i.e., without\nGod’s help. More exactly, if Philo asserted his own\nindividuality, it was in the free modification and criticism of all\nphilosophical doctrines around him, sometimes using them as their\ncreators would never have imagined possible. \nAs Roskam (2011: 35) underscored,  \nthe period of Middle Platonism is particularly interesting because it\nis in this period that Aristotle begins to receive more and more\nattention in the circles of a systematised Platonism.  \nThis does not mean that the rivalry between Platonists and\nAristotelians was over, but rather that Aristotle, who seems to have\nbeen largely ignored by Neo-Academic philosophers during the\nHellenistic period, emerged again as a reference and a point of\ndiscussion. Philo is full of praise towards the Stagirite in the De\naeternitate, a puzzling text. He\nwas himself a Creationist while Aristotle asserted the eternity of the\nworld. This does not mean that his admiration was unbounded,\nespecially if the original treatise had been in the form of an\nantilogy, a disputatio in utramque partem. Today, some\nscholars try to demonstrate that Aristotle, and not Plato, lay at the\ncore of Philo’s thought. It can be objected that the dogmatic\nAcademic Antiochus of Ascalon (ca 140/130–60 BCE), a\nphilosopher that Philo certainly had read, did much to intertwine\nPlatonic, Stoic, and Aristotelian ideas. The influence of Antiochus on\nthe Alexandrian philosophical milieu is a controversial question.\nDespite the efforts of Andronicus of Rhodes (first editor of the\nAristotelian corpus) to organize the corpus, some of the texts used\nAristotelian elements in a spirit quite different from what we now\nunderstand by Aristotelianism. This can shed light on our\nunderstanding of Philo’s Aristotelianism and on the comparison\nof his Aristotelian passages with the pseudo-Aristotelian ones, a\npoint on which many have commented. Antiochus was not the only one to\nshift the borders between these doctrines. The Stoic Posidonius also\nplayed a role in Philo’s elaboration of an unorthodox form of\nAristotelianism. \nEven if one is persuaded of the authenticity of Philo’s\nAristotelianism in the De aeternitate\nmundi, the compliments towards Aristotle at the beginning\nof the treatise are surprising and do not exactly fit within the\ntraditional frame of a disputatio pro and contra.\nThe most probable thesis was put in second position, as we can see in\nthe Ciceronian antilogy on justice in the third book of the De\nre publica. Another ambiguity is\nthat Aristotle is praised here for having referred to the visible God,\nwhile Philo says many times elsewhere that God is invisible. Of this\noddity two contradictory interpretations may be given: either Philo\nmeans that Aristotle as a philosopher is what Israel is among the\nnations, the one able to see God, an etymology of which Philo is fond;\nor the reference to the “visible God”, without any\nreference to His essence, means that Aristotle is only able to see the\nvisible aspects of Him. This would be an implicit criticism of the\nStagirite’s incapacity to perceive God’s transcendental\nand divine Nature. \nThe above is but one example of the difficulties inherent to the\ninterpretation of Aristotelian elements in Philo’s corpus, at\nleast regarding cosmological and metaphysical problems. Things are\nperhaps clearer concerning Aristotle’s influence on\nPhilo’s ethics. The term mesotès (middle way),\nwhich has special importance in Aristotelian ethics, is used by Philo\nonce, in Migr. 147. In this\npassage, the Alexandrine argues that the “royal road” is\nthe middle way. But this assertion is not an unrestricted sign of\napproval of Aristotle’s ethics. In the desert, there is no way\nat all—and the desert was the exact place where Israel received\nthe Revelation and achieved its liberty. The middle way may play a\npositive role in reining in debauchery, but for Philo, it has no\nabsolute value. In Leg. 3.20,\nLaban asks Jacob why he fled instead of remaining faithful to the\ndoctrine that recognizes the goods of the body and external\npossessions. Here is evidence of Philo’s refusal to accept\nAristotle’s doctrine of the three kinds of goods. In Det.\n8, it is said that corporeal and\nexternal goods are assets in name only, and in Somn.\n2.9, he criticizes those who\nupheld the tripartition of human goods and contrasts them with those\nfor whom virtue was the only good. To summarize, Philo could\noccasionally borrow some elements of Peripatetic doctrine, but he\nnever believed them to be an expression of higher truth. He reveals a\nparticular sort of coherence with regard to Aristotelianism: it\nconsists in demonstrating through exegesis that Aristotle’s\nprudent philosophy could not entirely coincide with the Bible’s\nspiritual wisdom. \nPhilo was probably the non-Stoic thinker who most frequently drew upon\nboth Stoic themes and vocabulary. Many scholars have noticed the\nstrong influence of Stoicism on Philo, and he is described frequently\nas a Platonizing Stoic. However, matters are a bit more complex. Given\nhis Jewish faith, he couldn’t refuse the Stoic conception of a\nperfectly organized world in which mankind had a privileged status\namong all other living creatures. One can add that the specific\nvocabulary of Stoicism had become a kind of lingua franca of\nintellectual discourse, used even by those who had no special\naffinity with the Stoics. At the same time, Philo was aware that the\nStoic refusal of transcendence created an unbridgeable gap between his\nown spiritual identity and Stoicism. There is a huge debt of Philo\ntowards Stoicism, but at the same time, he could claim to have repaid\nthis debt by bringing Stoicism in the direction of truth. Philo never\nsays exactly the same things as the Stoics. Despite their apparent\nsimilarities, there always remains a difference–sometimes barely\nperceptible, but always highly significant—between his doctrines\nand those of the Stoics. These differences can be distributed into\nfour categories: \nDoctrinal differences: for the Stoics, logos\nwas equally reason (individual and\nuniversal), nature, and God, while for Philo, logos\nis not ultimate reality but merely\nwhat we can see and understand of God, who is Himself very far from\nhuman comprehension. In Stoicism, logos\nis God; in Philo it corresponds to\nhis specific doctrine of the dunameis, the powers of God who\ncreated the world and governs it. \nAn inverse relation between the individual and the universal:\nfor Stoic philosophers, natural law is the logos\nin its function of commanding what\nmust be done or avoided. No particular human law corresponds with the\nnatural law, though Cicero tried to demonstrate that Roman religious\nlaw could coincide at least partly with the law of nature. In\nPhilo’s thought, the Torah is described as containing many\nelements of natural law, and its claims to universality were\nconcretized in the Greek of the Septuagint. \nThe refusal of essential Stoic concepts: Philo only uses the\nword sunkatathesis twice in his entire corpus, a key term\ndefining the human ability to accept or refuse information given by\nthe senses and the capacity to transform decisions into action. He\nuses sometimes oikeiôsis, another Stoic keyword, but\nnever with the meaning the Stoics lent to this concept. In brief,\nStoic oikeiôsis expresses the idea that Nature gives to\nevery living being from birth an indication of what its supreme\npurpose in life will be. In the case of mankind, things are a little\nmore complex. The first impulse is, as in the case of all animals, the\nimpulse to survive, but after this comes the impulse toward a rational\nlife, a privilege that human beings alone share with God. All this was\nunacceptable to Philo, both the idea that human beings could at their\nbirth be submitted to the same law as animals, and the definition of\ntelos, the supreme human good (Besnier 1999), as the capacity\nof making choices in accordance with nature. \nSubstitutions and additions: It has been correctly observed\nthat psychology, and especially psychology of the passions, is one of\nthe fields in which Stoic influence is most visible in the Philonian\ncorpus. It is perfectly true that he employs many Stoic elements in\nhis psychological commentaries, but in contrast to Chrysippean\nmonistic doctrine, Philo never insists that the soul could be\nexclusively rational. Philo’s own stance is to invoke a Platonic\ndualism when arguing that the soul is exiled in the body and\nconsequently in the world, and invoke Stoic psychological descriptions\nwhen describing the multiplicity of mental activities. Because he used\nthese two levels—one metaphysical and ethical, the other\ndescriptive and functionalist—he could give the impression of\nhaving avoided the contradictions between the two doctrines. \nBréhier, a great French name in Philonian studies, wrote that\nPhilo’s thoughts aligned much closer to Platonism than to\nSkepticism (Bréhier 1908 [1925: 214]). That assertion is\ncharacteristic of an epoch in which these two doctrines were\nconsidered to be radically different. More recent studies have\ndemonstrated that things are much more complex. Middle Platonist\nphilosophers like Plutarch, Favorinus, or Alcinoos integrated many\nelements of Skepticism to their dogmas, especially in order to\nundermine Hellenistic naturalism and redirect attention to an idea of\ntranscendence. Philo himself knew the existence of two kinds of\nSkepticism: New Academic and Neopyrrhonian. The former school seems to\nhave disappeared as a structured institution by his lifetime. The\nlatter came to prominence in the middle of the first century BCE, with\nEnesidemus criticizing New Academic philosophers, and especially those\nof his age, on the grounds that they had conceded far too much to\nStoic dogma. Philo seems to have paid little attention to New Academic\nsceptics, but was acquainted at least with some of their principal\ndoctrines. By contrast, he is the first to have used the tropes, i.e.,\nthe system of Sceptic arguments, elaborated by Enesidemus, which\nremained for centuries a kind of manifesto of Skepticism. At the\nbeginning of the twentieth century and for many years after, scholars\npaid great attention to the passage of the De ebrietate where\nPhilo uses these tropes. Today, however, it is commonplace to say that\nthe connection was a weak one, and that Philo had his own interests\ninstead. Of course he did, but Sextus Empircus himself, now considered\nthe most reliable source, had his own interests as well as being a\nphysician, and it is rash at least to neglect the Philonian testimony,\ncloser to Enesidemus from both a geographical and chronological point\nof view. Philo uses Sceptic methods to demonstrate that even with the\naid of education, the paideia of which he was so proud, human\nbeings are unable to find the truth. Skepticism thus appears as the\nbest means to awaken mankind to its oudeneia and to open the\npath toward transcendence. \n“Was Philo a Middle Platonist?” is the title David Runia\ngave to one of his articles (1993). There is at least one point of\nconsensus among the scholars, i.e., that Philo’s Platonism\naccurately reflected the Platonist interpretations circulating in\nAlexandria at the time. Very useful comparisons have been made with\nEudorus, a contemporary and compatriot, and with Plutarch. It is most\nprobable that Pythagoreanism played a great role in Philo’s\ndevelopment of negative theology; it certainly did so in his doctrine\nof the first principle. At the same time, Philo makes extensive use of\nPlato as well despite the difficulty of reconciling this doctrine with\nmore classical Platonic themes. The presence of the Timaeus\nin the De\nopificio mundi is massive, as\ndemonstrated by Runia (2001). Philo’s many allusions to the\ntheme of “assimilation to God” prove how conscious he was\nof the difference between Stoic immanence and Platonic transcendence.\nAt the core of Stoic ethics lay the concept of\noikeiôsis, which required both adaptation to Nature and\nabsolute obedience to her guidance. The word oikeiôsis\nderives from oikos, meaning house. The goal of a\nStoic’s life was to know every hidden recess of\n“Nature’s house” and to dwell respectfully therein.\nOn the contrary, for Middle Platonists who were readers and\ncommentators of the Theaetetus,\nthe goal was to depart from nature, a dwelling of sensations and\ninjustice, in order to become as similar as possible to God. Another\nmajor theme that Philo shares with other Middle Platonists is that of\nIdeas as divine thoughts, one of the features of Imperial Platonism.\nUnlike Plato in the Timaeus,\nPhilo does not assert that the Ideas are exterior to the Creator. For\nhim God is, through his logos, the\nonly active cause. The world of the Ideas, the noètos\nkosmos, is that of God’s thoughts. Despite many nuances,\nvariations, and even contradictions, there is in Philo the same triple\nstructure common to many Middle Platonic texts: the God/Demiurge, the\nfirst principle; the Ideas and powers by which God acts on matter; and\nmatter itself. However, it must be added that in Philo everything is\nboth similar and different. His God is not the Demiurge; he does not\ndefine powers and Ideas with reference to mathematical principles,\nthough arithmology is quite present in his commentaries; and his\nconception of matter, despite many allusions to the philosophical\ndoctrine of the dyad (the formless and unlimited base), has deep\nBiblical roots.  \nIt may be useful at this point to address the question of Pythagorean\ninfluence on Philo. In Probus\n2, he speaks of the “holiest sect” of the\nPythagoreans, a highly admiring expression. In fact, the quite\nnumerous mentions of this “sect” in his treatises are a\nconfirmation of his fascination for it. He admires Pythagorean elitism\n(Probus 2), and sees in the ban\nagainst pronouncing their Master’s name something akin to the\nJewish idea of divine ineffability (QG\n1.99). He explicitly mentions twice Pythagorean sources: in\nAet. 2, where he says, as we\nhave seen, that he read a treatise of Ocellus; and in Opif.\n100, there is a complex passage\nabout the number seven, likened by the Pythagoreans to Zeus, the\n“Director and Ruler of all things”. In QG\n2.12, arithmology is explicitly\nevoked as a Pythagorean science. Nevertheless, his allusions to\nPythagorean themes are often vague and merit further analysis. As an\nexample, Philo is often willing to use adjectives by which\nPythagoreans characterized the dyad but reluctant to use the word\nitself. And when he does so, he clarifies in a very personal manner\nthat “the monad is the image of the first Cause”\nand the dyad that of “the matter passive and indivisible”\n(Spec. 3.180). Monad and dyad\nserve Philo as exegetical tools, not actual substitutes for the\nnarrative of Creation in the Bible. It is as if the imperative not to\ncoincide exactly with Greek philosophical doctrine was for Philo an\nobligation of identity. \nEvidently, Philo felt no sympathy towards Epicureanism, an exclusively\nmaterialistic doctrine which denied the existence of Providence and\ndefined pleasure both as the first motivator of human actions and as\nthe supreme good. As if this was not enough, Epicureans also described\ngods as taking human form, which was for Philo an indisputable case of\nidolatry. Nevertheless, his attitude towards Epicureanism is at times\nmore complex than one might expect. In the first instance, his\ncondemnation of Epicureanism is clear. In the same sentence at Post.\n2, he castigates Epicurean\nimpiety alongside Egyptian atheism. In De\nprovidentia as well we find strong elements of a\nrefutation of Epicurean denial of Providence. And in Aet.\n6–8, he draws a clear\ncontrast between Epicureans who believe in the genesis and dissolution\nof worlds created by the chance of atomic collisions, and the Stoics,\nwho despite being materialists themselves, claim that the world is\nsingle and governed by Reason. In addition, atomism becomes an\nallegorical instrument in the splendid exegesis of Moses killing the\nEgyptian (Fug. 148), where this\nepisode becomes the symbol of the confrontation between the doctrines\nof unity and of extreme fragmentation. The Egyptian, who symbolizes\npleasure, is buried in the sand, symbol of atoms. Nothing in all this\nis truly unexpected. More surprising, however, is the inclusion of the\nmost complete exposition of the Epicurean version of\noikeiôsis in Opif.\n161, the doctrine of first adaptation to nature, probably of\nStoic origin but also adopted by other schools. Moreover, despite many\nappearances, Philo does not consider pleasure an absolute evil. For\nhim, it has a place in the divine program of Creation since it plays\nan essential role in procreation. The error lay with those who would\ntransform a relative good into a perfect one. \nPhilo’s name has almost become a byword for allegory. There are\nmany arguments to defend this association, but it would be an error to\naffirm that he was merely an allegorist. In many passages he defines\nwith precision what can be called his methodology of allegory. In\nPraem. 61–65, he says\nthat there are secret meanings, reachable only with God’s help.\nHe distinguishes three cases by which a secret meaning may be\nascertained: (a) directly by divine illumination, or (b1) indirectly\nin the shadow of literal interpretation, and/or (b2) by allegorical\ninterpretation. It must be added that he not only uses the word\nallegoria, but also uponoia, a Platonic term which\nby this time may have been somewhat archaic. The two terms are not\nexactly synonymous for him. In Opif.\n157, he posits that Biblical tales are not the kind of myths in\nwhich poets and sophists rejoice but are in fact “indications of\ncharacter types which invite allegorical interpretation through the\nexplanation of hidden meanings”. Nevertheless, according to\nPhilo, it is an error to exclude literal meanings. As he notes in\nMigr. 89–93,  \nthere are some who, regarding laws in their literal sense in the light\nof symbols of matters belonging to the intellect, are over punctilious\nabout the latter, while treating the former with easy-going neglect.\nSuch men I for my part should blame for handling the matter in too\neasy and off-hand a manner: they ought to have given careful attention\nto both aims, to a more full and exact investigations of what is not\nseen and in what is seen to be stewards without reproach.  \nFor him, allegory assumes importance when literal interpretation\nencounters difficulty, for example, when it suggests conclusions in\ncontradiction with God’s absolute perfection. In Leg.\n2.19, he does not hesitate to\nsay that the creation of Eve from one of Adam’s ribs was a most\nimprobable myth, if taken literally. It becomes likely only if one\nunderstands that “ribs” are in fact the powers of\nAdam’s mind. It has been amply demonstrated that Philo’s\nuse of allegory was not born ex nihilo. For example, an\nallegorical interpretation of the garment of the high priest (Mos.\n2.117) as a microcosmic\nreproduction of the universe is found in \nWisdom of Solomon 18:24, probably written at the end of the\nfirst century BCE. This suggests a Jewish source. On the other hand,\nmany examples evince Philo’s perfect knowledge of Greek\nallegories in the interpretation of Homeric and Hesiodic myths. He\ndoes not hesitate to evoke some of these by name. For example,\nspeaking about the earth in Aet.\n63, he says that she was rightly called Pandora, since she\ngives to living things all that is useful. In Greek\ndôron means a present. The allegorical interpretation\nis here based on etymology, as are those of the greatest Stoic\nallegorist of the imperial period, Cornutus. Researchers have recently\nshown great interest in Philo’s linguistic remarks. Most of the\ntime, however, he adapts classical allegorical interpretations to a\nJewish context. For example, in Conf.\n170 he quotes Homer, Iliad\n2.204–205, two verses in which the poet praises the power\nof a single man. Philo denies that this should be interpreted as a\ngeneral principle of politics; under his own interpretation, it is\ninstead a poetic reference to almighty God. In one of his most famous\npassages, Philo interprets the tale of Mambre, in Genesis\n18:1–15, where Abraham receives\nthree men he initially believed to be foreigners. The author reminds\nhis readers (QG 4.2) that\nHomer, who in recounting Odysseus’ homecoming, says that gods\noften disguise themselves in order not to be immediately recognized by\nhumans (Odyssey\n17.483–487). \nA central problem in Philo’s use of allegory is the nature of\nthe debt he owes to those he calls fusikoi. Since he evokes\nthem regarding the interpretation of some Biblical difficulties, they\nwere most likely Jewish exegetes using Stoic methods in which, at\nleast at that time, etymology played a strong role. For Long (1992),\nthere is a big difference between Stoic “allegory”, based\non etymological and, more generally, linguistic bases, and the\nallegories of Philo. Stoic allegoresis, he says,  \nwas not an attempt like [Philo’s], to distinguish figurative\nfrom literal meaning, but an effort to normalize language and remove\nambiguity according to their own understanding of the empirical world.\n(1992 [1996: 210])  \nIn fact, the problem of the exact nature of Stoic allegoresis is\ncontroversial. It can be remarked that Philo’s allegory is not\nmerely symbolic. Especially when mentioning the fusikoi, he\nhimself draws upon etymology, for example, about Sara whose name in\nthe Chaldean language (i.e., in Hebrew) means “the ruler”\n(Abr. 99), and for whom nothing\nis more dominant than virtue (80). If it\nis probable that in Alexandria at this time there were a great variety\nof allegorists blending literary, philosophical, and spiritual\ncurrents, then we can say that Philo was very skillful in drawing upon\neach of these. To this observation, let us add a Philonian conception\nof allegory that appears not to have interested later scholars: in his\ninterpretation of one of Joseph’s dreams in Somn.\n2.8, Philo states that he will\nfollow the method of allegory which he calls a “wise\narchitect”. This expression is a “hapax”, i.e., an\nisolated case. The best way to understand the meaning of this phrase\nis given by Plutarch when he says that Alexander, seeking the proper\nplace for the Egyptian city destined to bear his name, had a vision\n(Life of Alexander 26). In it,\nHomer recites two verses for him in which he mentioned the island of\nParos (Odyssey 4.354–55).\nAlexander declares to his friends that he will follow Homer’s\nadvice since he was the wisest architect—an already well-known\nstory in Alexandria to which Philo alludes in his own way. The\ndifference between Philo’s reference to Alexander and\nPlutarch’s is itself interesting. In the latter case, Homer is\nnot only the greatest poet but also the father of all science. In the\nformer, it is not the poet but the exegete that unveils the meanings\nof dreams. And dreams sent by God always reveal something about the\ntruth of the world. \nPhilo is also considered the founder of negative theology in the\nhistory of monotheistic faith. Given the association of his faith with\ncontemporary forms of Skepticism, he was also the founder of at least\na kind of fideism, i.e., a doctrine in which faith is the foundation\nof all essential truths. His apparent versatility in exegesis can give\nthe impression that his only purpose is to make philosophical themes\nand words coincide with the text of Bible. However, though Philo is\nnot as systematic as Plotinus, there is much more coherence in his\nphysics and metaphysics than one might think. Even John Dillon, hardly\nan unconditional admirer of Philo, argues that “he follows a\nsystem in which the supreme principle is the One”, meaning not\nthe God of philosophers but the personal God of Judaism (1977: 155).\nThe problem of possible philosophical antecedents to Philo’s\nconception of an unknowable and ineffable God is a complex one. Such a\nhypothesis cannot be dismissed, but there is no clear evidence of its\ntruth. In any case, negativity is, par excellence, the manner\nof speaking in the best way possible about God. It is not the only\none; there is also the possibility of declaring His perfection and\ninfinite glory. And metaphors, like those of monarchy, the sower, and\nthe sun, are still different. But the uiae negationis,\neminentiae (all that is good has its origin in God), and\nanalogiae (there is a kind of analogy of being between\nCreator and creature), though perfectly compatible with each other,\nare only poor human means to suggest Him who can’t be seen,\nnamed, nor known. Nevertheless, one of the most interesting\ncomparative means to evoke man’s relation to God is the\nvocabulary of mysteries, for example when Philo says in Cher.\n49:  \nI myself was initiated under Moses the God-beloved into his great\nmysteries, yet when I saw the prophet Jeremiah and knew him to be not\nonly himself enlightened, but a worthy minister of the holy secrets, I\nwas not slow to become his disciple.  \nThe comparison with the Eleusinian mysteries is so precise that Moses\nis often called “hierophantos”, initiated in the\nSinai to mysteries most obscure. As it had held in Eleusis, Philo\nspeaks of “little mysteries” and “great\nmysteries”, the former leading to liberation from passions, the\nlatter from sensations. Many other elements, especially those of the\nsacred banquet, resonate with the theme of the mysteries. Many\nscholars suggested that Philo situated himself in the Platonic\ntradition of philosophically transposing the Eleusinian mysteries. In\nthis perspective, the mystery is the allegoric method itself.\nHowever, one could object to this interpretation that the meaning of a\nmetaphor is not monolithic. It depends in great part on the identity\nof the addressee, about which we know little. Indeed, there was at\nleast one ambiguity: did Philo want to prove to hypothetic Greek\nreaders that Eleusinian mysteries were shadowy images of the only true\nmysteries, the Jewish ones? Was he using a kind of spiritual\nlingua franca elaborated during the pluralistic honeymoon at\nthe beginning of the Ptolemaic period? Still, no element of the\nmysteries’ lexicon could trace a shift with regard to the theme\nof the impossibility of knowing God. \nEven the man who was the closest to God, Moses, could not see Him in\nthe Sinai. God is “ineffable, inconceivable and\nincomprehensible” (Mut.\n15). This means that without Revelation, it would be impossible\nto say anything about Him that bore relation with truth. At the same\ntime, the absolute transcendence of God, as theorized by Philo, could\nhave implied His perfect indifference to the world of matter, time,\nand sensibility. Yet, through His providence, God is present in the\nworld He created. From a philosophical point of view, the problem of\nwhat Radice calls “the antinomy of transcendence and\nprovidence” played a great role even in the period before Middle\nPlatonism (2009: 128). The return to Platonic transcendence was the\nmajor philosophical characteristic of Philo’s age. It is highly\nimprobable, however, that philosophy had a determining role in shaping\nhis faith and beliefs. More probable is that he perceived himself in\nthe tradition of biblical translators, the Septuagint being so highly\npraised by him in the Vita\nMosis. In a time when Egypt was Ptolemaic, these\ntranslations had both political and cultural purposes. In\nPhilo’s time, the main center of Greek power was cultural. To\ncomment upon the Bible with philosophical concepts was, in a certain\nway, to translate it into the language of the new cultural elite, the\nRoman as well as Greek. Regardless, the central idea was that the word\nof God had to be mediated to become accessible outside of Israel. From\nthis point of view, mediation was a central Philonian concept, not\nonly linguistically and culturally, but also ontologically: in Somn.\n1.62, he says that God\nfulfilled His Word with His incorporeal powers. \nOne of the main Philonian concepts, power, is all the more complex\ngiven the varieties in Philo’s prose when discussing it (Termini\n2000). These variations were probably a means to avoid the implication\nthat these powers had an ontological autonomy. Their nature, rather,\nis merely linguistic and functionalist. The number of God’s\npower is not fixed and their relation to the logos\nis evoked vaguely or not at all. From\na philosophical point of view, the genealogy of dunamis is\nincredibly rich since each great Greek philosopher used it with his\nown semantic specificity. In the Bible, God is omnipotent but there is\nno systematic presentation of His powers. Just before the apparition\nof Middle Platonism, dunamis was present in Stoic doctrine,\nbut with a more reduced range of meaning. The question of\nPhilo’s source(s) on this point is very controversial, but the\ngeneral structure is quite clear. His two main powers are the\n“creative power” (theos) and “regal\npower” (kyrios) (Cher.\n27–8). The beneficent and the legislative powers are\nsubordinated to them, but in Spec.\n1.45, Philo uses a Platonic metaphor to assert that God is\nsurrounded by a great number of powers who are like His bodyguards.\nBefore trying to specify the relation between these powers and the\nlogos, it is necessary to add that\ndunamis is not only a metaphysical term. It bears a\npsychological meaning as well, for example at Opif.\n67 when Philo evokes the\ndivision of the soul in a context both Aristotelian and Stoic. In\nLeg. 1.11, the division is more\nclearly Stoic, with its seven traditional parts (the five senses,\nreproduction and speech) but at the same time, Philo seems to adopt a\ndualistic position, distinguishing a rational and irrational part of\nthe soul. The main problem, in human psychology as with the divine\npowers, lies in their relation to the logos. \nIt seems that Philo did his utmost to make the relation between God\nand the logos as complex as possible.\nAs an example of these difficulties, in Leg.\n2.86, God is said to be the\nsupreme genus and His logos\nthe second one. Other things, Philo adds, only exist in speech and\nsometimes amount to mere nothingness. In the third book of the same\ntreatise (Leg. 3.175–6),\nthe logos is defined as the\n“ti”, i.e., the all-encompassing genus in the\nStoic system. To explain this definition, Philo specifies that\nGod’s logos is the supreme\ngenus of everything that was born. From a philosophical point of view,\nif somebody remains in the world of immanence, he can refer to the\nuniversal logos, and only to him. But\nto see the logos as the ultimate\nexpression of the absolute is for Philo an absolute impiety. In fact,\nthe logos is only God’s shadow,\nHis image, the instrument by which He created the world, or in a more\nanthropomorphic way, His “first-born son” or His deputy\n(Agr. 51). In Fug.\n109, the logos\nis said to be “the Son of God\nand Sophia”. The Pythagorean-Platonic model of Creation acting\non undefined matter is thus both preserved and richly transformed. \nGod is unity, and only unity. It is the logos\nwhich carries in itself the principle\nof contraries, mixing good and evil. This leads in turn to a\ndistinction between ontology and methodology. Anyone who divinizes the\nworld, seeing it as the most perfect expression of the logos,\nis deeply wrong, since he omits God,\nthe truly supreme genus and the only one not to have been created. At\nthe same time, the exegete of God’s word can occasionally lead\nto his commentary focusing on the logos,\ncreating a false resemblance to\nStoicism. However, the theologian is, mutatis mutandis, like\nthe biologist who today chooses some cells to place under his\nmicroscope. This act, of course, does not imply that the biologist\nforgets the tissue of which these cells are a part. Similarly,\nPhilo’s focus on logos should\nnever suggest that he feels a temptation toward Stoicism. Themes and\nlanguage of immanence are for him only a means to better understand\nthe world created by God. When he praises the philosophers who\nrecommend “living according to nature”, he uses a famous\nStoic formula, but immediately after explains that this means\n“to follow God” (Migr.\n128). For a Stoic, the two formulae were strictly synonymous.\nIn Philo’s thought, the former is valid only if it is followed\nby a reference to God, who is transcendent by definition. \nThe intermediary status of the logos\nand the many nuances in the expression of its nature do not prevent\nPhilo from providing a more or less systematic framework. \nThe logos, God’s\norganon in the creation of the world, is described in Opif.\n20 as “the place of the\nIdeas”, a metaphoric expression since for Philo the intelligible\nworld could not be contained in a place. While the demiurge\ncontemplates the Ideas in order to create the World in the Timaeus,\nin the De\nopificio, God not only creates the\nIdeas but organizes them into an intelligible world. In Her.\n119, the divine logos\nis said to be both sower and creator.\nThe former word refers to a Stoic concept, that of spermatikoi\nlogoi, defined as the rational patterns inherent in the\nprinciples of organization of the world, but which Philo preferred not\nto use with precision. The Quis\nheres is probably the treatise in which Philo’s\nreflection on the logos’ way of action is most\ncomplete, through the concept of logos\ndivider (tomeus). In\nStoicism, one of the main functions of the logos\nis to establish the principle of the\nidiôs poion, that is to say, the absolute specificity\nof each being in the world. In the Quis\nheres, perhaps under the influence of a Stoicized\ninterpretation of the Timaeus,\nPhilo explains how God created the four elements from undifferentiated\nmatter, then individual beings, by mixing these elements together. \nAs was said rightly by Radice, the  \nphilosophical doctrine of the powers… allowed Philo to maintain\nboth the oneness of God despite His many names and epithets, and the\ntranscendence of God despite His action on the world. (2009: 136) \nThe relation between the logos and\nthe law of Nature is an interesting topic since it shows the different\nperspectives of Philo’s thought and Stoic doctrine despite their\nmany similarities (Najman 1999). For the Stoics, the logos\nand the law of Nature are perfectly\nsynonymous. In their definition, the law of Nature is the command of\nthe logos as to what must be done and\nwhat avoided. Philo’s thought of the law is different. In Opif.\n143, Philo alludes to\nman’s original ancestor as living in a world governed by a\nconstitution, i.e., “the right reason of nature”, which is\nnamed with more appropriate title “ordinance”, a divine\nlaw according to which obligations and rights have been distributed to\neach creature. The vocabulary is Stoic, but with an interesting\nnuance: Philo speaks about “the right reason of nature”\ninstead of “the law of nature”. This is perhaps more than\na stylistic variation; instead, it may have served to reveal a\ndistance with regard to the canonical doctrine of the law of Nature.\nThis distance appears to be essential, despite many variations and\noccasional contradictions. First of all, while Stoic natural law is\naffirmed by Cicero to be “the same in Athens and in Rome”,\nbut without any precise formulation, the Torah, specific law of the\npeople of Israel, is posited by Philo to be unique, since it is both\nconcrete and eternal. The law of Moses thus has an ambiguous status,\nsince it is sometimes said to be the Natural Law itself, and sometimes\nan image, eikôn, of it. It is a controversial point\nwhether the term “image” means an ontological degradation\nor a perfect identity of one with the other. Last but not least, Philo\nemphasizes the fact that before the Torah, the patriarchs were\nunwritten incarnations of the law of Nature. Admittedly, his task\nbordered on the impossible. He had to take into account both the\nhistoricity of the Torah and its eternity, its universality, and its\ninstitutional status as law of Israel. It is not impossible that he\nhad in mind a model similar to the translation of the Torah into\nGreek. In the Vita Mosis, he\nemphasizes the fact that the Greek translation and the Hebrew (he says\n“Chaldean”) original are perfectly identical and\nequivalent. There is a plasticity of the law of Nature, at first\nincarnated by the patriarchs, then written; and a plasticity of the\nTorah, first in Hebrew, then in Greek. At the same time, their\nunderlying function is always the same: defining a principle of\nethical responsibility not exclusively from the rationality of the\nworld but by reference to a personal God who chose Israel to incarnate\nand bear witness to this principle in its different forms. \nThe De opificio was often\ndefined as a Jewish version of the Timaeus.\nIn this treatise, Philo\nproclaims, against Aristotelianism and Stoicism, that God is the\nunique Creator both of the models for the world and of the world\nitself. That does not prevent him from drawing upon patterns\nelaborated in the somewhat confused but rich period at the end of the\nfirst century BCE. The evaluation of the most common model of\ncosmological creation in the De\nopificio, that of an active power acting on unqualified\nmatter, is difficult since Philo seems to affirm that God created the\nworld ex nihilo in some passages. It is probable that there\nwas no significant difference between unqualified matter and pure void\nfor him. God’s first task—though Philo refuses to admit\nthe historicity of Creation (Runia 2001: 156–162)—was\nacting as architect to elaborate His project, i.e., to structure the\nintelligible world, conceived as the model of the corporeal one and\nestablished in the logos. The chief\ncontents of the incorporeal cosmos were heaven, an invisible earth,\nair and void, water, spirit, and light. After the creation of the\nfirmament and of the earth, on the fourth day God proceeded to order\nthe heaven and to adorn it with splendid heavenly bodies. The\nexplanation of this fourth day is especially interesting given the\nfollowing elements: \nGod has absolute liberty, and creates the less-important earth before\nthe more-important celestial bodies. \nHe knows what the then non-existent human beings will think and wants\nto prevent them from thinking that the movement of the celestial\nbodies is the cause of everything. This could be called the Chaldean\ntemptation, not without similarities to Stoicism, and is an obsessive\nfear of Philo’s. \nAt this point he begins an extensive section on Pythagorean\narithmology, including a meditation on the perfection of the number\nfour. \nOn the fifth day, God creates the living beings according to a\nscala naturae replete with Platonic, Aristotelian, and Stoic\nechoes. As has been remarked, there is a crucial difference between\nPlato and Philo on this point (Runia 2001: 213). While “the\ncreational sequence” is descending in the former, in the\nAlexandrian exegetes—who aim to defend the Biblical\naccount—it ascends. Between the fishes, which are the first\ncreated, and man, crown of Creation, are birds and land animals. The\ncreation of man, on the sixth day, is for Philo an occasion to develop\nsome of his main themes: the resemblance of the human being to God,\nbased on the Platonic and Stoic idea that the intellect holds the same\nposition in the human being that the Great Creator holds in the\ncosmos; the concept of the powers of God, introduced with his exegesis\nof the words, “let us make a human being after our image and\nlikeness”. In fact, argues Philo, God needed no one to create\nthe human being, but preferred that human sins not be attributed to\nHim. In addition, he cites the Platonic idea of contemplation leading\nto philosophy, a risky idea since it could lead to such a fascination\nwith worldly things that the Creator would be forgotten and denied, as\nwas the case with the Chaldeans. After a long arithmologic meditation\non the hebdomad, the seventh day or Shabbat, Philo arrives at original\nsin. It is said that the first man (the name Adam is never evoked) was\nmost excellent in his body as well as his soul. He lived in perfect\nharmony with nature, homeless, but the cosmos was his home and city,\nwhere he resided with complete safety. God ascribed to the first man\nthe imposition of names, a philosophical theme with strong Platonic\nconnotations. In the following paragraphs Philo explains his descent\ninto wickedness by the creation of woman. The sentence “woman\nbecomes for him the starting point of a blameworthy life” has\naroused many criticisms of misogyny on Philo’s part. It would be\nabsurd to deny that there are many offensive assertions regarding\nwomen in his work. Woman is the symbol of sensation, man that of\nreason. These problems are essential in that they deal with sexuality,\nethics and ontology alike. Without trying to defend Philo\nsystematically, one must however emphasize the first sentence of Opif.\n151:  \nBut since nothing is stable in the world of becoming, mortal beings\nnecessarily undergo reverses and changes, the first human being too\nhad to enjoy some ill fortune.  \nThe word “necessarily” means that human responsibility is\nmuch more relative than absolute. The first man could not eternally\nhave a perfect life in a world which was not the intelligible one. In\nStoic doctrine, the similarity between the sage and God is a permanent\none. Philo is much more cautious when saying at Opif.\n151:  \nAs long as he was single, he resembled God and the cosmos in his\nsolitariness, receiving the delineations of his soul, not all of them\nbut as many as a mortal constitution could contain.  \nEve’s role was inscribed in Adam’s ontological\ninstability. In Philo’s allegorical interpretation, defined not\nas a certainty but a conjecture, the serpent is the symbol of\npleasure. It cannot be said, however, that pleasure is an absolute\nevil in Philo’s thought. It is necessary in the created world\nand it is said in Leg. 2.17\nthat the new born child makes use of it. The defenders of pleasure are\nnot absolutely wrong when they say that offspring feel an affinity\nwith it. Their error is not in defending pleasure but in transforming\nits auxiliary role into the alpha and omega of ethics. The moment of\nhumankind’s fall is neither the triumph of evil, nor a victory\nof individual perversity, but rather the appearance of a contrast\nbetween the first man in his initial perfection and a world which,\nbeing created on the basis of the intelligible one, could not itself\nbe perfect. \nIn a huge catalogue of philosophical opinions, which is of\nconsiderable interest, Philo begins by demonstrating how little we\nknow about heaven, then arrives at the human being about whom he says\nthat he/she has four parts: body, sensibility, speech, intellect\n(nous) (Somn. 1.25).\nHe exposes all that we know about the first three, for example, that\nbody has three dimensions and six ways of moving. But about the\nintellect, he says that it is absolutely unintelligible. Nothing is\nknown about its nature, its way of arriving in the body, or its place.\nAs with the place of heaven in the world, we are unable to say\nanything about it. But in contrast with this scientific and\nphilosophical ignorance, the Bible gives its reader true information.\nThe intellect is a divine emanation (Somn.\n1.34, Genesis\n2:7), and the human being is the one\nwho received the privilege of worshipping God, the One Being. There\nare grounding elements of the problem: what must the human being do in\nthe face of such problems? Philo’s answer is both philosophical\nand theological. She must, like Socrates or like Terah (father of\nAbraham) in the Torah, make a constant effort to have better\nself-knowledge. Socrates is the man who had no other philosophy than\nto know himself, while Terah is the very idea of knowing oneself. What\ndoes it mean to know oneself? Essentially, to have a clearer idea of\none’s position with respect to God and His powers in order to\nhave the means of becoming wiser, and therefore better. The human\nbeing has no other personal good than reason. The paradoxical aim of\nreason is to perceive the distance between God and His creation (Somn.\n1.66) and so to understand how\nfar He is from human comprehension. \nTo know oneself does not mean to have a perfect science of what a soul\nis. Philo knows all the suppositions elaborated by philosophers and he\nuses many of them, but without ever saying that he is in possession of\nknowledge of the soul. It has been rightly said that his purpose was\nnot to build a scientific but a “religious psychology”. In\nthis kind of psychology, it was not essential to know if a soul has\nseven components besides reason, as it is said by the Stoics, or\nthree, like in the Platonic division, or if it contains, besides\nreason, nutritive and sensitive parts like in Aristotelianism. Here\nI’ll give a few examples of his varieties of uses. In Opif.\n117, soul is compared to a\npuppet show, the seven puppets being manipulated by the\nhègemonikon, the central rational element. This\nmetaphor strongly reminds us of the Stoic comparison with the octopus,\nbut is also very different from this image. The octopus is a living\nunity, while the puppet master is essentially different from his\npuppets. The Stoic metaphor of the octopus is a monist one, but the\nPhilonian image, inspired from Plato (Laws\n644d), is strongly dualistic.\nThe puppets are not even irrational beings as they are mere objects.\nBut it is true that in Leg.\n1.28, the image of the source and the stream could have been\nused by the most orthodox of the Stoics if separated from its context.\nIn 1.29, Philo says that the intellect\n(nous, note that he does not use the Stoic word logos)\nis like a source going to the\nsenses. There is, however, no contradiction in all this. In 1.30,\nPhilo uses a strictly Stoic definition:\nthe living being is characterized by representation and impulse. But\nwhen he arrives to the human being at 1.31,\nStoicism is completed by a Biblical\nquotation (Genesis 2:7). A Stoic image\nis a good way to speak about living beings, but it is not enough when\nthe narrative is about humans. That is why Philo often uses the\ndistinction between rational and irrational beings with an opposition\nbetween the hègemonikon, unique and rational, and the\nother parts of soul, divided in seven and irrational. However, it must\nbe added that in Philo, dualistic images do not imply the division of\nthe soul. In Leg. 2.8, he\nasserts that sensation and passions are like parts and products of a\nunified soul. Such are the multi-layered levels of language Philo is\ncapable of using at every page. For him, it is impossible to know what\na human soul is, but it is not necessary to have this kind of\nknowledge in order to try to understand what the meaning of the word\nof the Lord is. To be conscious of her ignorance in the field of\npsychology, far from being an obstacle, actually helps to have a\nbetter perception of the limitations inherent to human nature. But\nthis consciousness itself necessarily rises from the confrontation of\nthe philosophical doctrines. \nIt would be an error to affirm that Philo despises and hates the body.\nEven if he is often very harsh towards it, he never forgets that when\nGod created the first human being, He made him not only spiritually\nperfect, but also physically beautiful. He does not see any\ninconvenience in emphasizing the perfection of sensation or sexuality.\nIt is said in Opif. 136 that\nthe first human being was truly and really kalos kagathos,\nbeautiful and good. It is strange to find in a Jewish biblical\ncommentator the explicit expression of this Greek ideal of humanity.\nAt the same time, it could mean that for Philo the Greek conception of\nthis expression was an erroneous one, since it did not imply an\nimmediate link with divine transcendence. God, Philo says, was a good\ntechnitès, both of the body and the soul. The beauty\nof the body is in Opif. 138\nexplained in specific Greek terms, symmetry, beauty of the flesh, and\ncolor. All these concepts can be found in Plato, Aristotle, and the\nStoics, but it does not mean that Philo uses them in the same way. In\nPhilo, the body is not a principle of evil, though it can be used as\nan instrument of perversion when the human being focuses more on\nhimself than on the powers of God. We find in Leg.\n3.71, however, the assertion\nthat the body is bad by nature, ponèron fusei. The\nmeaning of the expression is perfectly clear, but it is also necessary\nto remember the context. Philo is commenting on Genesis\n38:7, where it is said that God killed\nEr without any justified reason. According to Philo, “ER”\nmeans in Hebrew the flesh, the body which is a threat for the soul.\nBut at the same time Philo specifies that to create the best things,\nGod had to create less good things. This can lead to the conclusion\nthat the ponèron fusei means not absolute but relative\nperversion since the body is necessary to demonstrate, by contrast,\nthe beauty of soul. Creation is good by nature (fusei) and\nthe body is an element of the Creation. The example of Issachar in\nLeg. 1.83 shows how necessary\nthe body is for ethical progress. But at the same time, the knowledge\nof the body can be only phenomenological, while real research is\nontological. This can explain Philo’s violent attacks on the\nbody: it is a tomb (following the Platonic play on words comparing the\nbody to a tomb), a nosèma (disease), a vase unable to\ncontain its desire, and most frequently a burden of flesh. But all\nthis verbal violence is addressed more to human error on the value of\nthe body than to the body itself created by God. \nOne major intellectual revolution in the passage from the Hellenistic\nperiod to Middle Platonism was a relative abandoning of the concept of\noikeiôsis (natural kinship) which, originating with the\nStoics, became a foundation of ethics not only in Stoicism but also in\nEpicureanism and the late Aristotelianism of Antiochus of Ascalon. The\nHellenistic period was that of a naturalism that only the sceptic\nAcademy undertook to fight it. The great change brought by Middle\nPlatonism was the irruption of transcendence which seemed to have been\nforgotten for at least two centuries. And in the case of Philo,\ntranscendence was not only philosophical, but also religious, mainly\nthat of the God of the Bible. Philo sometimes uses the term\noikeiôsis, but never in the Stoic meaning, always with\nsemantic transformations. He could not accept the idea, central in the\ndogma of oikeiôsis, that children as well as animals\nare the image of nature. His own description of the world of childhood\nis a frightening one, a description Sigmund Freud would not have\nspurned. For him the main ethical purpose is to become closer and\ncloser to God, and so to be in a spiritual kinship with Him. At this\npoint, Philonian oikeiôsis is not different from the\nPlatonic omoiôsis. It is not, as in Stoicism, an\ninitial impulse, indicating the path of nature, but the result of a\npious asceticism, getting rid of desire and passionate impulses. It\nhas been suggested that the resemblance to God did not have in Philo\nany concrete social or ethical consequences, but things are much more\ncomplex. He says in Decalogo\n133 that murder is forbidden because of the common resemblance\n(omoiôsis) of all men to God, but it is true that he\ndoes not develop extensively the consequences of this\nomoiôsis. In Stoicism, there is a kind of family\nrelationship between human beings, since they alone (among animals)\nshare reason in a world which is itself exclusively rational. Philo\nputs great weight on the specific status of Israel as the only people\nable to see God, an etymology of which he is very fond. In Alexandria,\nanti-Semitic propagandists accused Jews of being a group unified\nthrough their hatred of other nations, and today in the scholarship,\nthe problem of universalism in Philo is much discussed (Berthelot\n2003). However, it is necessary to distinguish between the ontological\nlevel and the ethical level. Because of its specific relation with\nGod, Israel is the priest of the Nations, for whom it prays and offers\nsacrifices (Abr. 98; Somn.\n2.163; Mos.\n2.133–135). At the same\ntime, Philo never denied that non-Jews could reach wisdom. For him, as\nwell as Jews, Greeks and Barbarians could be ascetics of wisdom.\nJewish superiority lies in the unique capacity to articulate the three\nlevels: human individual perfection, with the examples of the\npatriarchs and Moses; social perfection, that of a society ruled by\nthe laws of Moses; and ontological specificity, due to a deep kinship\nwith God. \nPhilo’s general vision of mankind is often pessimistic. In Ios.\n30, he uses the Stoic metaphor\nof the world as a huge city, but a city ruled by violence and hatred.\nThe main cause of this disaster is the reign of passion, a theme very\noften evoked in the philosophy of his time. In his exegesis of the\nBiblical passages relating to human errors, Philo uses many\nphilosophical terms and metaphors. Sometimes, he uses a Platonizing\ndescription of passion, recalling the description of the winged team\nof horses in Phaedrus 253\nc–e. At the same time, in many texts, he refers to the\nStoic division of passions, with four bad passions\n(pathê): desire, fear, sadness, and pleasure, and three\ngood passions, joy, caution, and will. But his use of this Stoic\ndivision is not strictly faithful to the original. In his allegorical\ninterpretation of Det.\n119–120, Philo contrasts bad and good passions, but he\nintroduces hope and repentance, biblical virtues, among the latter. It\nwas not simply a terminological change, but the sign of a deep\nontological change. In Stoic doctrine, only the present exists. To be\na sage means to understand that the past and the future have no real\nexistence, but are mainly spaces of projection for passions. By\nintroducing hope and repentance among good passions, Philo, without\nrenouncing a complete, or at least as complete as possible, control of\nbad passions, opened a path going from psychology to transcendentalist\nethics.  \nPhilo, without giving a precise and irreversible definition of the\nnature of soul, recommends the radical excision of passions in Leg.\n3.129, arguing that no\nmoderation of them could be satisfactory. The model is a medical one\nof major surgery, which will also be used by Seneca. In the fight\nagainst passions, enkrateia (self-control) and\nkarteria (endurance) play a decisive role. However, only the\nsage can live without any passion in Stoicism, and everyone knows that\nthe Stoic sage is extremely rare in the history of mankind. It was\nimpossible for Philo to admit that a human being could be perfect.\nHowever, it is said in Deus 67 that Moses aimed at the\ndisappearance of the passions, but did he succeed in it? There are\nmany similarities between Philo’s attitude towards passions and\nthat of the Stoics, but there is also a fundamental difference. For\nhim it is impossible to become free from passion without divine Grace.\nThat does not mean that one has to become passive and wait for\nGod’s intervention. Enkrateia and karteria are\nindividual qualities that are encouraged by the rules of life included\nin the laws of Moses. However, even before the Law was given to Moses,\nfaith was the condition sine qua non to escape the process of\npassion. When Abraham received the order to sacrifice his son, he\nobeyed without any emotion. “He admitted no swerving of body nor\nmind” (Abr. 175). His\nfaith was so absolute that at no moment did he try to revolt. But\nthere is yet another difference with Stoicism. In this doctrine, the\nsage cannot lose his perfection, and he remains always in his\napatheia (perfect serenity) even if he has reflex reactions\n(propatheiai) of which his judgment is not responsible. On\nthe contrary, at the death of Sarah, Abraham avoids the two attitudes\nconsidered erroneous by Philo. He did not grieve over-bitterly nor did\nhe assume indifference (apatheia) as if nothing painful had\noccurred. On this occasion, the patriarch chose the\nmetriopatheia, the middle way, which, in philosophy,\ncorresponds to Aristotelian doctrine. Unlike the Stoics, Philo does\nnot try to present apatheia as a kind of ethical heroism.\nUnlike the Peripatetics, he does not think that ethics always requires\nreasonable aims. He considers the human being able to transform bad\npassions into good ones and affirms that there are no natural limits\nto his perfectibility when he accepts to submit himself to the power\nof God. \nMost philosophical themes related to virtue are present in the\nPhilonian treatises. The four traditional virtues (phronesis\n[prudence], sôphrosynè [temperance],\nandreia [courage], dikaiosunè [justice]) are\ncompleted through enkrateia which pertains more specifically\nto the Cynic-Stoic tradition as the science of that which appears in\nline with right reason. In Spec.\n4.135, we find a different definition of the four cardinal\nvirtues: eusebeia (piety, sanctity) is defined as “the\nqueen of virtues”, and wisdom, temperance, and justice\nfollowing. In the treatise De\nvirtutibus, metanoia (repentance) and\neugeneia (nobility) have special importance. The first\nconcept, considered an unhappy passion by the Stoics, is the\nequivalent of the Jewish concept of teshuva. In Philo, it\nexpresses the strong connection between theological and moral\nreflection. Eugeneia has nothing of a racist concept, since\nall those who are temperate and just are truly noble (Virt.\n189). Abraham, son of a\nChaldean astrologist, becomes the symbol of true nobility when he\nemigrated from polytheism to monotheism. \nOne of the most interesting elements in the Philonian presentation of\nvirtues is the understanding of matriarchs as allegorical symbols of\nvirtues. Gender differences are a complex and interesting aspect of\nthe Alexandrine’s thought. One cannot deny his misogyny, which,\nhowever, is not common since it is expressed through rather\nsophisticated semantic webs. Virtue is, on his view, masculine in its\nessence, since it is powerful and active. The realm of reason is\nmasculine, “for nature is the law of men, and to follow nature\nis the mark of a strong and truly masculine reason” (Ebr.\n54–5). Why, then, are\nwomen, the matriarchs, chosen as symbols of virtues? The answer given\nin Fug. 51 is that God used a\nfeminine appearance so that even the most perfect human qualities\nwould be imperfect. Each matriarch has her allegorical peculiarities.\nSarah, for example, is said to have nothing to do with the world of\nwomen and to be born, like Athena, from the father of everything\n(Ebr. 60–1). At the same\ntime, she unites with Abraham to give birth to Isaac, who is the\nallegory of joy, one of the three Stoic good passions\n(eupatheiai) which also include will (boulèsis)\nand caution (eulabeia). \nIn Stoicism, virtue, or human perfection, is the natural end\n(telos) of the programming of mankind by Providence. In\nPhilo, things are more complex because of Original Sin. For the\nStoics, there was no ontologisation of evil in a world which was\nentirely rational, and to become as perfect as God was not an absurd\nproject. Philo lived in a period when most philosophers chose a more\nmodest purpose: to become like God as far as possible by flying from\nthe earthly sphere to the heavenly realm (Plato, Theaetetus\n176 a–b). To live in the\nleast imperfect way was the goal, a goal which had some similarities\nwith the Stoic figure of the prokoptôn, the person\nmaking moral progress. Philo knew the different aspects of this figure\nand gave his own interpretation of it in Agr.\n15. The striving towards a\nlesser imperfection could take three forms, a division with\nPlatonic/Pythagorean origin but embodied by the example of the\npatriarchs. Abraham embodies the effort to know, in traveling from\nastrology to real comprehension of nature, then from the comprehension\nof nature to “the maker and father of the world”; Isaac\nsymbolizes the happy nature, “the new race, superior to reason\nand truly divine” (Fug.\n168); and Jacob, the struggle against senses and passions.\nPhilo stresses the fact that each of these three types is present in\nthe other two (Abr.\n52–53). From a formal point of view, the relation among\nthe three types is not fundamentally different from that of the\nvirtues in the Stoic system which aims to reconcile the unity of the\nwhole and the specificity of each element. \nThere is an element which differentiates Philo from his contemporary\nphilosophers and rabbis: the absence of a master. It is impossible to\nfind in his vast corpus the name of someone who initiated him to\nphilosophy or to Biblical exegesis. Why this silence about his\nmasters? One possible explanation is that for Philo, transmission is\ngreater than the transmitters. He is consistent regarding this\nposition when he speaks very little of himself. His main idea is that\n“the only good that is infallible and firm is faith in\nGod” (Abr. 268). The\nhuman being can improve herself, and she can have a clear conscience\n(suneidêsis is a key word of Philo’s ethical\nvocabulary) of the ethical issues, but this does not allow her to\nassert her real existence. \nAlmost all the details that we know of Philo’s life are in\nrelation to his political activity. Though he himself has a clear\npreference for theoretical and mystical life, he played an important\nrole in the Jewish community of Alexandria. This is one of the great\nparadoxes of his life. He thought that it was necessary to engage in\npolitical affairs before attempting the contemplative life, but the\ntragic situation of the Alexandrine community obliged him to commit to\npublic life in order to defend his coreligionists. Nevertheless, he\nnever considered politics a field without interest. His treatises are\nfull of remarks about the origin of society, or about the functioning\nof human society. Stasis, violent sedition in the city, was\none of his main concerns, certainly based on his own experience. He\nwas perfectly aware of the Stoic doctrine of the social\noikeiôsis, which affirmed that the whole of mankind was\na natural community, arranged in concentric circles (family, nation,\nhumankind as a whole). He did not deny the existence of kinship among\nhuman beings, even if “malignant covetousness” is always a\nsource of hatred. He tried to give a concrete shape to the natural\nlink by encouraging philanthropy and demanding humane treatment of\nslaves. He did not hesitate in advocating their emancipation. He even\nasserts that their emancipation “granted freedom to him who is\nnaturally free” (Spec.\n2.84). At the same time, he describes mankind as being deeply\ndivided by passions, wars, and all kinds of violence. He has the same\noptimistic vision of human nature, at least in principle, as the\nStoics, while he also adopted the pessimistic view of the Neo-Academic\nCarneades in his critique of Stoicism. One of his most original ideas\nto transcend this duality was that individual political regimes were\n“additions to the one natural regime” (Ios.\n28–31). The dispersion of\nhumanity and the strength of the passions have as consequence that\nharmonious coexistence of nations, though theoretically possible, is\nin reality impossible. Because there is, in politics, a permanent\nantagonism between individual passions and natural reason, the figure\nof the politician is himself varied and contradictory. Moses is not a\npolitician, but at once the figure of the philosopher-king, the sage,\nthe priest, and the prophet. Even before receiving the Law, he is the\nincarnation of the law (nomos empsychos), as were the\npatriarchs (Abr. 3–5).\nJoseph, the best politician, is not a constant object of Philo’s\nadmiration. Even though a recent paper (Frazier 2002) tried to give\nevidence of a greater coherence between the two treatises, in the\nDe Iosepho Joseph is described\nas a responsible and courageous man, while in the De\nsomniis he is said to be mainly\ndesperate for glory. For Philo, monotheism would imply the superiority\nof monarchy, but with the exception of Moses, most human beings are\ntoo weak and inconsistent to ensure stable monarchy. In fact, his\npolitical thought is profoundly influenced by the Hellenistic idea of\nanacyclôsis, the natural instability of the three\nelementary constitutions (monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy). The\nGreek historian Polybius had thought that a mixed constitution would\nbe the guarantee against this instability, and he saw in the Roman\nconstitution the paradigm of this stability. In a certain sense, for\nPhilo, the city of Moses is the model of a new kind of constitution:\nit associates transcendence with law of nature, particularism and\nuniversalism, monarchy, aristocracy and democracy. Was it for him, as\nit said by Carlier (2008: 433) “un modèle concurrentiel\nà la civitas romana” (i.e., a competitive model\nto Rome)? Certainly it was for him a model of a different kind, a\nradically different kind of exemplarity. In this perspective, the\nfamous and controversial passage about the Essenians (Probus\n75–92) can be read as\nthe demonstration that this model was not a utopian one. \nFor Cicero, who has many common points with Philo despite fundamental\ndifferences, the problem of the choice of life (theoretical,\npolitical, or mixed) is one of the most frequent themes of his\nphilosophical reflection. For him, it was essentially a matter of\npersonal choice. In the case of Philo, as it was underlined by Calabi\n(2011, 2013: 87), the commandment to observe the Sabbath establishes a\nstructural organization of time, which must include at least a part of\ntheoretical life. Philo stresses the fact that in all the Jewish\ncommunities Sabbath was a day for praying and also for devoting\noneself to philosophy (Spec.\n2.62), that is, the study of the Torah. Does the De\nuita contemplativa, with its long\ndescription of the life of the Therapeuts of Alexandria, mean that the\ntheoretical life was for Philo the best kind of life, or only a\nphilosopher’s dream? There are many declarations of Philo\nasserting the superiority of the theoretical life. At the same time,\nhe does not imagine this life as an isolated one. To live in the\ndesert does not necessarily mean to live alone. In fact, the desert is\nthe place where the double aspect of virtue appears most clearly,\nwhich is reflection and action at the same time. This duality is once\nagain a common point between Philo and the Stoics, but also an element\nof difference, because no Stoic showed the slightest interest for kind\nof life of the Therapeuts. \nThe Quod omnis probus is one of\nthe most puzzling Philonian treatises. Despite the fact that Eusebius\nincluded it in his catalogue of the works of Philo, the question of\nits authenticity was often discussed from the middle of the\n19th century. The main arguments against its authenticity\nwere the massive presence of Stoicism and the lack of any allegoric\ncommentary. Biblical references are rare, only five quotations used\nfor an apologetic purpose. From a philosophical point of view, it is\nnot easy to understand how Philo, who was a major user of Stoic\ntopoi, but always showing distance towards them, seems to\nhave fully adopted the paradox of the perfect liberty of the sage,\neven when he is in a situation of slavery. Did Philo adopt the Stoic\nview that the sage embodies the perfection of human nature? And how\ncould he reconcile this with the Jewish conception of a human being\nmarked by Original Sin? More generally, between Stoicism affirming\nthat the wise man is the equal of God and Plato proposing that man\nassimilate to God to the furthest extent possible, where did Philo\nstand? The first remark is that Philo does not consider Stoicism an\nautonomous thought in the Probus.\nAccording to Philo—if\nhe really was the author of the treatise—Zeno, the creator of\nthe Stoa, most likely found his doctrine of human liberty in the\nBible, more precisely in Genesis 27:40, the story of two brothers, one\nmoderate, the other shameless. Their father wanted the shameless to be\nthe slave of the moderate one in order to improve the shameless one.\nThe perfection of the sage in the Probus\nis always subordinated to that\nof God, who is infinitely superior. In Stoic doctrine, God is the\nlogos, and that means that He and the\nhuman being have the same nature, perfect in the first case,\nperfectible in the second one. In Philo’s interpretation of the\nBible, the distance between the two is infinite. Even if man is\ncreated in the image of God, the Philonian negative theology affirms\nthat we know nothing about Him. Philo says in the Probus\n20 that only he who has no\nother master than God is free. He adds that this man is also the\nmaster of other human beings, the deadly vicar of a Grand Immortal\nKing. In Stoic doctrine, the Sage is the King and the next best human\nbeings are his ministers. There is no mention of a mightier king. But\nhow can Philo say that a human being is divine? \nLitwa (2014) focuses on the deification of Moses. In conclusion, Litwa\naffirms that “Moses is deified by participating in the logos,\nthe Mind of God, and Philo’s\n‘second God’” (2014: 27). God is the King and God of\ngods, while Moses is only a god with regard to mankind. It can only be\nadded that if the Sage embodies the exceptional fulfillment of the\nhuman nature in Stoicism, in Somn.\n2.234, the perfect man is said to be neither of an ungenerated\nnature nor a mortal one. Not only the context of Middle Platonism but\nalso the beginning of the deification of the princeps in the\nRoman empire can help understand why Philo so easily expressed the\nidea of the man-god, which seemed to be far from his own convictions.\n \nAnother long article would be necessary to address the Christian\nreception of Philo. Many books and articles provide precious\ninformation on this point (Van den Hoek 1988; Runia 1993, 2009;\nSterling 1998). Philo’s thought was used by the Christian\nfathers in many different ways. Their attitude towards him ranged from\nthe passionate interest of Origen to the accurate attention of Clemens\nto the somewhat stubborn and hostile attitude of Ambrose, who in many\nplaces plagiarizes Philo. Today, Philo is included in the modern\ncategories of “Middle Platonism” and, still more recent,\n“Middle Judaism”. In his case these expressions are\nmeaningful. He spent his life “in the middle of”\nantagonistic cultures, violent conflicts, and contrasting\nphilosophical and religious theories. His main legacy in philosophy\nwas the idea that in the face of many harsh human attitudes, there\nwere two complementary ways of remaining free and lucid. The main\nmodel was for him, as it was constantly asserted by Nikiprowetzky, the\nflight, not exactly the Platonic flight of the Theaetetus,\nbut that of Exodus, both\na spatial, historical, and vertical flight, the most perfect example\nof the presence of Transcendence in the world. While the cause of\nAbraham’s flight was his rejection of idolatry, Moses’\nproject was far more ambitious: not only to escape from Egypt, but to\nbuild a nation by giving it the Word of God as a constitution. But it\nmust be added that there was for Philo also a kind of Exodus of words.\nHe gathers concepts and themes of philosophy to free them, i.e., to\nbring them into the light of the God of the Torah. Like Moses who knew\nall the foreign sciences, Philo learned almost everything of\nphilosophy, not in order to be a professional philosopher, but to\ndemonstrate that the truth the Greeks looked for was where they did\nnot imagine it to be. Philo’s conception of oudeneia,\nthe human nothingness, had nothing to do with nihilism. It was\nthe affirmation of the centrality of God instead of the centrality of\nthe self. One could say that this was theology much more than\nphilosophy. But, at the same time, it would be an error to say that\nphilosophy remained the same before and after Philo.
