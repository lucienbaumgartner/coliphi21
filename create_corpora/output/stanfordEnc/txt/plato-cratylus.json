Sophists like Prodicus offered\ntraining courses in this subject, sometimes perhaps meaning by it\nlittle more than lessons in correct diction. But that practical issue\nspawned the theoretical question, what criteria determine the correct\nchoice of name for any given object? And in the Cratylus\nSocrates’ two primary interlocutors, Hermogenes and Cratylus\n(the latter of whom is reported by Aristotle to have been an early\nphilosophical influence on Plato), represent two diametrically opposed\nanswers to that question.\n\n\n\nAs a preliminary, it is important to be clear about what is meant by\n‘names’. The plural noun onomata (singular\nonoma), translated ‘names’, in fact varies\nbetween being (a) a general term for ‘words’, (b) more\nnarrowly, nouns, or perhaps nouns and adjectives, and (c) in certain\ncontexts, proper names alone. In (a), the most generic use, it comes\nto designate language as such. Ultimately, for this reason, the\nCratylus is Plato’s dialogue about language, even if\nthe elements of language on which it concentrates are in fact mainly\nnouns. Proper names are included among these nouns, and at times are\ntreated as paradigmatic examples of them.\n\n\n\nThe positions of Hermogenes and Cratylus have come to be known to\nmodern scholarship as ‘conventionalism’ and\n‘naturalism’ respectively. An extreme linguistic\nconventionalist like Hermogenes holds that nothing but local\nor national convention determines which words are used to designate\nwhich objects. The same names could have been attached to quite\ndifferent objects, and the same objects given quite different names, so\nlong as the users of the language were party to the convention.\nCratylus, as an extreme linguistic naturalist, holds that names cannot\nbe arbitrarily chosen in the way that conventionalism describes or\nadvocates, because names belong naturally to their specific\nobjects. If you try to speak of something with any name other than its\nnatural name, you are simply failing to refer to it at all. For\nexample, he has told Hermogenes to the latter’s intense annoyance,\nHermogenes is not actually his name.\n\n\n\nSocrates is the main speaker in this dialogue, and his arguments are\ngenerally taken to represent Plato’s own current views. He starts\nout by criticizing conventionalism, and persuades Hermogenes that some\nkind of naturalism must be endorsed. This leads to a long central\nsection in which Socrates’ version of naturalism is spelt out by\nappeal to proposed etymologies of philosophically important words:\nthose words, it turns out, have not been attached in a merely arbitrary\nway to their objects, but are encoded descriptions of them. So\nfar the argument seems to be going Cratylus’ way. But in the\nfinal part of the dialogue Socrates turns to Cratylus and shows him\nthat his expectations as a naturalist are set impossibly high: names\ncannot aspire to being perfect encapsulations of their objects’\nessences, and some element of convention must be conceded.\n\n\n\nScholarly opinion has long been divided as to how Socrates’\nown eventual position should be understood — as a qualified\nvindication of conventionalism, of naturalism, or of neither. If\nSocrates is read as actually dismissing naturalism, it is almost\ninevitable that his naturalistic etymological decodings of words, to\nwhich well over half the dialogue is devoted, should be taken as not\nseriously intended, and in fact as making fun of the entire\netymological practice. This has been the majority position among\ninterpreters for well over a century. It rests partly on the conviction\nthat (a) the etymologies are ridiculous, and (b) Plato knew as well as\nwe do that they are ridiculous.\n\n\n\nHowever,  at least some caution is required here. The Greeks knew\nlittle about the historical origins of their  own language, and\nthe style of etymology practised by Socrates in this dialogue is not\nvery different — except perhaps in its elaborateness —\nfrom that practised by a great many ancient writers, one which had its\nroots in Homer and Hesiod. None of Plato’s readers in antiquity,\nstarting with his own pupil Aristotle, seems to have suspected the\nCratylus etymologies of being non-serious. The interpretation\naccording to which Plato is mocking etymological practice, although\nnot demonstrably wrong, may be suspected of crediting him with an\nanachronistic degree of insight into historical linguistics. That\nSocrates’ long etymological extravaganza is peppered with humour is\nnot in doubt, but that the humour must be directed at the etymologies\nas such is less clear. Reading Socratic humour is a largely intuitive\nmatter, and one which regularly divides readers.  Socrates’ humour in\nthe Cratylus is at least partly directed at his own\nuncharacteristic boldness in declaiming long strings of word\nderivations, contrary to his familiar disavowal of expert knowledge\nabout anything. Whether some of it is left over for deflating the\netymological enterprise itself is a question on which readers must\nmake up their own minds. But the present article is based on the\ncontrary assumption, that the etymological practice on display in the\ndialogue is seriously meant.\n\n\n\nWhere does the Cratylus belong among Plato’s works?\nIt is conventional, though far from uncontroversial, to place an entire\nseries of dialogues featuring the ‘classical theory of\nForms’ in his middle period (see the entry on \n  Plato’s middle period metaphysics and epistemology).\n  And three of these — the Republic, Phaedrus\nand Parmenides — are often thought to belong late in\nthat period, on the evidence of stylistic features. For those who\naccept this schema, the Cratylus ought to belong relatively\nearly in the group, since it contains the classical theory of Forms\nbut lacks the late stylistic features. It might therefore, with some\nplausibility, be placed close to the Phaedo, and this dating\nhas often been favoured. However, thematic links to the interests\nexplored in late dialogues like the Sophist have encouraged\nsome to date it later. Besides the manuscripts preserve two passages\nthat seem to be traces of a superseded first edition of the dialogue,\nsuggesting that what we have could be a revised edition, quite\npossibly of relatively late date. If so, the text as we have it may\nnot straightforwardly represent any one period of Plato’s work.\n\n\n\nAs the dialogue opens, Cratylus and Hermogenes are approaching\nSocrates to referee their dispute (see above) about language. Cratylus,\nHermogenes complains, has been maddeningly secretive about the details\nof his naturalist thesis, and has had the effrontery to inform him that\nHermogenes is not his real name. How can that be, Hermogenes wonders,\nwhen all it takes for a name to be someone’s name is that there\nbe an agreement by the relevant human community to use it that way? \n\nQuizzed by Socrates about the size of the relevant community,\nHermogenes agrees that at an extreme it might even be one\nperson’s private name usage that is at issue. And he concedes\nthat Socrates could if he wished have private nicknames that conflict\nwith the city’s public vocabulary, for example by calling a man\n‘horse’ and vice versa. \n\nThis may be read as simply establishing the precise terms of\nHermogenes’ conventionalism. Although it is often interpreted as\nalready reducing his thesis to an absurdity, there is no reason to\nthink so, and at all events it is only in the next move that Socrates\nrepresents himself as developing an actual objection to\nHermogenes’ conventionalist stance. \n\nThat next move starts with Socrates securing Hermogenes’\nrejection of out-and-out relativism like that of Protagoras.\n(See the entry \n Plato on knowledge in the Theaetetus.)\n  This in turn commits him to the view that things have objective\nnatures independent of how they may appear to us, and that there are\nobjectively determined skills for dealing with them: for example, the\nright way to cut something is determined, independently of our own\nsubjective preferences, by that thing’s objective nature. Like\ncutting, naming too will be an objective science. Much as a shuttle is\na tool for separating threads, a name is a ‘tool for instructing\nby separating being’ (388a–c). But tools must be made by\nappropriate experts, who are themselves advised and guided by the\ntools’ destined users. Thus, just as the shuttle-making carpenter is\nguided by the weaver who has commissioned his product, so too the\nname-maker is an expert who, ideally at least, is guided by that\nultimate expert in word use, the dialectician. It follows that names,\nif correctly made, cannot be randomly adopted, as Hermogenes’\nconventionalism would imply, but on the contrary need to be expertly\nmade for their specific purpose, in a way that corresponds to the\nnatures of the things they name. \n\nLike any good craftsman, Socrates also maintains, the name-maker (or\n‘lawmaker’, as he also somewhat mysteriously calls this\nparticular expert) must turn his mind’s eye to the appropriate\nForm, which he then embodies in the materials at his disposal, just as\na carpenter making a shuttle or drill, having turned his mind’s\neye to the appropriate Form, then embodies it in the particular wood\nor metal at his disposal. In the case of name-making, the appropriate\nmaterial is not wood or metal, but vocal sound. Implicitly, just as\nthe same shuttle Form can be embodied in various woods and metals, so\ntoo the same name Form can be embodied with equal success in the\nvarious sound systems that different languages employ. In this way, it\nis made clear, the undeniable fact that the same thing is called by\nmany different names around the world need not conflict with the\nnaturalist thesis that names belong naturally to their objects: each\nof those names is the appropriate and natural way to represent its\nname-Form in the local sound system (389d–390a). \n\nThe relevant name Forms for a name-maker to look to, Socrates makes\nclear, will not be simply the generic Form of name, but also one of\nits species, the specific Form of the name currently being sought.\nPresumably the generic Form of name is the function of a name as such,\nwhich as we have seen is to instruct by separating being. If so, the\nForm of a specific name, say the Form of the name of a man, will be\nthat name’s function of instructing by separating the being\nof a man. Otherwise put, the name ‘man’, or its\nequivalent in any other language, is a suitable and well-made name in\nso far as it discharges its function of separating off vocally what it\nis to be a man from what it is to be a dog, a drainpipe, or anything\nelse. In doing this, the name also ‘instructs’. It does\nso, it seems, ideally by the educational means that a dialectician\nwould use — by accurately focusing the discussion onto the\nobject of inquiry, in this case man, and thus helping interlocutors to\nproceed with the task of defining, and thereby understanding, what a\nman essentially is. But at a more mundane level of language use, there\nis little doubt that the ‘instruction’ envisaged will\nreduce to the ordinary imparting of information — in this case,\nfor example, by indicating that the item referred to in a sentence is\na man rather than something else. \n\nEverything down to here is set out in terms of Plato’s own\nmetaphysics, and has all the hallmarks of philosophical seriousness.\nNames are purpose-made portions of vocal sound, expertly constructed\nfor their specific function of marking off this or that item’s\nbeing. This is clearly a form of naturalism, since it treats names as\nappropriately correlated to the specific natures of the objects they\nname. But what does that natural correlation amount to? \n\nAt a minimum it might have consisted merely in the accurate mapping\nof a language’s vocabulary onto the natural genera and species\nthat constitute reality, so that each word corresponds to precisely one\nentity. But such a mapping could in principle be done even if the\nactual words were formed and assigned on a random basis, which would be\nentirely compatible with Hermogenes’ conventionalism. Since\nSocrates and Hermogenes seem agreed that that original stance has now\nbeen undermined, and since it is the actual making of names that has\nbeen presented as an expertise, not merely their assignment once made,\nit is clear that Socratic naturalism must lie not merely in a correct\nmapping relation, but in each word’s formation as one\nspecifically appropriate to its object. What kind of appropriateness is\nat issue? \n\nSocrates’ proposed answer fills the very extensive central\nsection of the dialogue. In short (for to say it at length would exceed\nthe capacity of this article), names are appropriate to their objects\nin so far as they describe what they are. According to a long series of\netymologies proposed by Socrates, the Greek vocabulary itself, when\nsuitably decoded, is an elaborate set of descriptions of what each\nnamed item is. To continue with the example already mentioned, the\nGreek word for ‘man’, anthrôpos, according\nto Socrates appears to break down into anathrôn ha\nopôpe, ‘one who reflects on what he has seen’\n(399c). That is, the species which uniquely possesses both eyesight and\nintelligence has been given a name which acknowledges precisely that\ndistinguishing combination. \n\nAny residual sympathy for Hermogenes’ original conviction that\nman and horse could just as easily have been assigned each\nother’s names is, it seems, meant to have evaporated by this\npoint. (Even at 433e–434a, very near the end of the dialogue Socrates\nwill continue to reject Hermogenes’ assertion of\nname-interchangeability, this time with the examples of ‘large’\nand ‘small’.) Scholars who doubt that Plato means to make\nsuch generous concessions to naturalism have been inclined to treat\netymologies like that of ‘man’ as non-serious. But this\nparticular decoding was widely accepted by later writers, not all of\nthem Platonists, and there is no evidence that anyone, Plato included,\nthought it ridiculous. The latter is equally true regarding the\nremainder of the etymologies. \n\nThe other etymologies that make up this central section are\nsystematically ordered to cover the main objects of philosophical and\nscientific discourse. After an only partly successful trial-run with\npersonal names, including Homeric and mythological ones (391c–397b),\nSocrates and Hermogenes set out to work through the vocabulary of\ncosmology (397c–410e): the hierarchy of intelligent beings; soul and\nbody; names of deities; astronomical entities; the elements; and the\nprinciples of temporal regularity. They then turn to ethics\n(411a–421c): intellectual virtues; moral virtues; technical virtues;\ngeneric terms of evaluation; emotive states; judgement; will; and\nfinally truth (presumably included in this section on the ground that\nit underlies the intellectual virtues). Lastly, they seek the roots of\nall this signification in the directly imitative primary sounds out of\nwhich the simplest words are composed (421c–427d). \n\nSocrates’ implied main principles of etymology, as they emerge\nover this entire section, supplemented by the remainder of the\ndialogue, can be summarized as follows: \n\nSocrates’ and Hermogenes’ assumption throughout the\netymological section is that, by decoding the philosophically\nsignificant Greek vocabulary, they are reading off from it the\nbeliefs of those early members of their race who first gave things\ntheir names. It is in this sense that they assume etymology to work: it\nreally can decode words and thus read the mindset of our early\nancestors. Moreover, in keeping with his culture’s veneration for\nantiquity, Socrates respects whatever insights the ancients prove to\nhave had into many cosmological matters, above all their recognition,\nwhich emerges on nearly every page, that intelligence is the key factor\nin the world’s structure. \n\nBut at no point does Socrates let that veneration turn into an\nattribution of authority to the ancients, and hence into a belief that\netymology is a route to establishing the truth. The ancients’ views,\nonce rediscovered, must be assessed on their merits, and when he turns\nto the ethical vocabulary he in fact finds them to have blundered\ndisastrously. For, he maintains, the Greek ethical vocabulary when put\nunder the microscope turns out again and again to associate positive\nvalues with flux, negative values with stability. In thus tying values\nto constant change, he suggests, the name-makers were projecting their\nown intellectual dizziness onto the things they were naming. \n\nSocrates’ exposure and criticism of the ancients’ error\nno doubt hints at what Plato sees as his philosophical\nforerunners’ failure to recognize the essential stability of values.\nPlato sees the two of them — Socrates and himself — as\nresponsible for that all-important breakthrough. The way in which the\nancient name-makers prove to have understood cosmology so much better\nthan they did ethics mirrors Plato’s relative valuation of the\nPresocratic philosophers in the same two disciplines. \n\nCratylus, who came to be known in antiquity as a proponent of\nuniversal flux, is not at all deterred by the flux content discovered\nin the existing Greek vocabulary, and interprets Socrates’\netymological marathon as vindicating his own naturalist stance. But\nfrom now on Cratylus’ extreme position will be under attack. He\nbelieves all names to be perfectly faithful descriptions of their\nobjects, with the consequence that a string of sound embodying a less\nthan accurate description of some object could never be that\nobject’s name. As a further consequence he also holds,\nconversely, that a string of sound which did succeed in being the\nobject’s name would be a guaranteed source of knowledge about it.\nThese are the twin targets of Socrates’ critique. \n\nIf an allegedly inaccurate name like ‘Hermogenes’ fails\nto name at all, to call the person in question ‘Hermogenes’\nis not even to say something false, according to Cratylus, but simply\nto fail to say anything. In this way Cratylus turns out to belong to\nthat school of sophistic thinkers who paradoxically deny that false\nstatement is possible (see the entry on \n  method and metaphysics in Plato’s Sophist and Statesman). \n\nSocrates’ reply to this seeks to enforce an admission that\nthere are, in such naming contexts, variable degrees of correctness,\nand indeed that no naming act could ever attain perfect\naccuracy. He finally wins this round by appeal to a pair of analogies\nwith paintings. First (430a–431c), if attaching names to people is like\nassigning portraits to them, there seems no reason why one could not\nsucceed in incorrectly assigning them the wrong portrait, and\nlikewise the wrong name. Second (432b–c), however good a likeness a\nname is of its object, some gap between the two must inevitably remain:\notherwise painting a completely accurate portrait of Cratylus would\nresult, not in Cratylus plus his picture, but in two Cratyluses. \n\nAlthough Plato’s long-standing interest in the falsity issue\nis well known, the main aim here is to enforce Cratylus’\nagreement on a point already established in the etymological section:\nthat although names do indeed function as names by being miniaturized\ndescriptions of their objects, they can succeed in being names despite\na considerable variation in their degree of descriptive accuracy. Names\nare ‘so far as possible’ likenesses of their objects, but\nthe minimum condition for their being those objects’ names is\nmerely that they convey their ‘outline’ (432e–433e). The\nportrait analogy is here too not far from the surface. \n\nNot only does Socrates thus weaken the principles of naturalism, but\nhe also makes it clear that in doing so he is reintroducing an element\nof conventionalism (434a–435d). This is argued in two ways. \n\nFirst, at the level of primary sounds, it is agreed that the word\nfor ‘hardness’, sklêrotês, contains\nboth a hardness sound, R, and a softness sound, L. (We are permitted to\nassume that all the other sounds in it are neutral in this regard.) How\nthen do people succeed in understanding its meaning correctly? Thanks\nto convention, is the unfortunate answer to which Cratylus commits\nhimself, thus conceding to Hermogenes far more than he ever intended to\n(434e–435b). Second, Socrates points out that the names of numbers will\nbe impossible to explain without including an element of\nconvention. \n\nThe difficult question about these two moves, on which scholarship\nis divided, is how far the pendulum has now swung back towards\nconventionalism. There are reasons for being wary of exaggerating the\nswing. As regards the first argument, it is significant that Socrates\nnowhere in the dialogue admits any case in which the inappropriate\nelements in a name outnumber the appropriate ones (hence item 19 in the\nlist of etymological principles, section 3 above). The test case, that\nof sklêrotês, is one where the score is even, so\nthat convention has to be called in to break the deadlock. And as\nregards the argument about numbers, Socrates is explicit that\nconvention needs to be invoked here, not to replace naturalism, but on\nthe contrary to vindicate it: ‘[W]here do you think you’re\ngoing to get, to apply to numbers, a supply of names which resemble\nevery single one of them, if you don’t allow the consent and\nagreement you spoke of to have some authority concerning correctness of\nnames?’ (435b–c). And he does have a good point. There cannot be\na simple set of direct and unmediated resemblances between numbers and\ntheir names, because there are infinitely many numbers, so that an\ninfinite set of number-names made out of the finite stock of letters\nwould be unable to place any limit on the length of those names. We\ntherefore have to have agreed rules for composing their names\nout of smaller units: twenty-seven, two hundred and forty, etc.\n(English and ancient Greek are not very different in this regard.) And\nthose rules will be where the element of convention creeps in. If so,\nthe result is that the descriptive power of number-names is vindicated:\nthanks to this simple set of conventions we can name, by\ndescription, any one of the infinite series of natural numbers.\nThis is very far from being an abandonment of naturalism. \n\nThe closing topic to which Socrates and Cratylus turn is where\nknowledge is to come from. Cratylus, despite the damage Socrates has\ninflicted on his extreme naturalism, still clings to his belief that\nthe study of things’ names is the privileged route to knowledge\nof the things themselves. But why, Socrates wants to know, should we\nassume that the original name-givers were infallibly right in the\ndescriptions they encoded? Cratylus, who is emerging as an adherent of\nthe flux theory, points to the consistent emphasis on flux revealed\nthroughout the foregoing etymologies. To this Socrates retorts that (a)\none can be self-consistently wrong, as well as right, and (b) other\netymologies can be found that show up the original name-makers as not\nquite so consistently wedded to flux after all. \n\nThis latter point should not be mistaken for an attempt to refute\nthe etymological theory as such — that is, the theory that\netymological analysis can succeed in reading off the beliefs of\nthe original name-makers. For Socrates will soon be reaffirming his own\nconfidence in the main finding of the etymologies, that the name-makers\nreally did believe everything to be in flux (439c). He is just\nquestioning how consistent and single-minded they were about sticking\nto that belief, and hence is challenging their infallibility, and their\nreliability as authorities. \n\nThere remains, Socrates points out, the question where the original\nname-makers would have got their knowledge from. Obviously not\nfrom the study of names, he points out (438a–b). It is only a short\nstep from this to agreeing that no intermediacy, of names or\nanything else, between the would-be knower and the object known can do\nanything but impede the learning process. Rather, Socrates proposes,\nreality should be directly studied in its own right. Some have thought\nthat Plato is here proposing an altogether non-linguistic mode of\nphilosophizing, although his remarks can in fact be adequately\nunderstood as merely denying that names should be studied in\nthe pursuit of knowledge, without any accompanying denial that they\nshould even be used. \n\nThe dialogue’s final argument (439b–440d) implicitly\nidentifies the Forms as the objects that require that unmediated study\nin pursuit of knowledge. Even Cratylus, by now a passionate partisan of\nflux, can see the point that something should remain stable\nthrough the change. For even so self-guaranteeing a statement as the\nself-predication ‘The Beautiful itself is beautiful’ could\nnot be truly utterable unless the Form referred to endured long enough\nfor the predicate to be attached to it. Worse, knowledge would not be\npossible if, during the process of our learning about its object, that\nobject were already changing into something else. With these arguments\nspelt out, Socrates allows himself definitively to deny the truth of\nthe universal-flux thesis, while Cratylus, disregarding Socrates’\nwarnings, reaffirms his own commitment to it. \n\nThis final scene thus points forward to two diametrically opposed\ndevelopments. One is Cratylus’ eventual conviction, as reported\nby Aristotle (Metaphysics 1010a7–15), that flux is so rampant\nand exceptionless as to make it impossible to speak of anything at all.\nThe other is Socrates’ progress towards the stable ontology that\nwould in due course be the hallmark of Platonism. Plato had in his\nformative years been influenced in turn by both Cratylus and Socrates.\nThe dialogue’s close symbolizes his own eventual philosophical\nchoice between them.","contact.mail":"dns1@cam.ac.uk","contact.domain":"cam.ac.uk"}]
