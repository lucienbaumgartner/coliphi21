The successive\nDaozang [Daoist Canons] never made this distinction. When we\nlook at the way the terms Daojia and Daojiao occur\nin the texts preserved in the Ming Canon [published in 1445], we see\nthat they are practically synonymous and interchangeable. \n —Kristofer Schipper (Schipper and Verellen 2004: 6)\n\n\n\n\nThere could be no better introduction to the present article than the\npassage quoted above from one of the main Western scholarly works on\nDaoism (or Taoism), even though it calls into question not only the\nrelevance of this article, but also the actual existence of its subject.\nDaoist texts do not speak of “philosophy” or\n“religion”, two words that do not even exist in the\npremodern Chinese language. They speak, instead, of what they call the\n“house”, “family” or “lineage of the\nDao” (daojia; also translatable in the plural), and of\nwhat they call the “teachings of the Dao” or\n“teachings on the Dao” (daojiao). Daoists, who\nobviously have understood these terms in their literal senses, have\nseen them as defining the same entity: there cannot be\n“teaching” without “lineage”, and vice\nversa.\n\n\nEven if the term “religious Daoism” is accepted, it is not\nclear which entity it should define, and different scholars might explain\nits meaning in different ways. Should “religion” include\nall of Daoism except for its “philosophy”? This would\nprobably exclude the views of the Daode jing (Book of the Way\nand Its Virtue;\n §1.1\n below), which Daoists have seen as an integral part—in fact, as\nthe source—of their tradition. Omitting these views would be\nsomething like writing a survey of Christianity that intentionally\nneglects to consider the thought and works of the theologians. Should\n“religion” only include communal ritual with the related\npantheons of gods, on the one hand, and the priestly and monastic\ninstitutions, on the other? If so, an article on “religious\nDaoism” would exclude meditation, alchemy, and other individual\npractices that Daoists—including those who did not practice\nthem—have seen as major components of their tradition.\n\n\nDaoism is a tradition as complex and heterogeneous as Buddhism, Islam,\nJudaism, or Christianity. The modern categories of philosophy and\nreligion can help to comprehend its “otherness” (Seidel\n1997: 39) by interpreting its different manifestations according to a\nsupposedly familiar framework. Yet, the use of these categories can\nalso lead an observer to look only at the aspects of the tradition\nthat fit the chosen framework, and only within the terms of that\nframework. This may result in creating distinctions and boundaries\nthat do not exist within the tradition itself. Even worse, the whole\nissue might simply consist of imposing one cultural model over a\ndifferent one.\n\n\nThe present article attempts to take into account the Western\nscholarly views on Daoism as well as the Daoists’ views of their\nown tradition. As a consequence, it is based on a broad definition of\nwhat we might call Daoist religion (a term that should replace the more\nwidely-used “religious Daoism”), and also includes views that pertain\nto what we might call Daoist philosophy (or Daoist thought, a term\nmore appropriate than “philosophical\nDaoism”).\n\nIt would hardly be possible to identify a school or a lineage in the\nhistory of Daoism which denies that the entire Daoist tradition, in\nthe forms in which it has been transmitted for about two and a half\nmillennia, ultimately derives from Laozi and from the work that is\nascribed to him, the Daode jing or Book of the Way and\nIts Virtue. \nAs shown below, neither has Daoism evolved exclusively on the basis of\nthis work, nor does evidence exist of a historical continuity between\nLaozi and the Daode jing, on the one hand, and the different\nforms in which Daoism has developed, on the other. Equally\nsignificant, however, is the fact that, in a traditional doctrine such\nas Daoism, history in the ordinary sense of the term can be altered at\nwill to frame a “sacred history” of the teaching. The main\npoint is establishing and exhibiting a bond between an integral\nexposition of the doctrine—which Daoists find in the Daode\njing—and the particular teachings and practices of the\nindividual schools or lineages. To give a few examples, this can be\ndone by asserting that a particular “Way” (dao)\nderives from a revelation by Laozi, either in his human or in his\ndivine aspect; or by placing Laozi at the origins of (or within) a\n“pre-historical” line of transmission; or simply by using,\nin textual sources, key sentences or terms from the Daode\njing. In these and several other ways, Laozi and the Daode\njing are, for the Daoists, one of the main vehicles used to\ndeclare their identity as Daoists. \nAmong early works, the Daoist tradition usually places the\nZhuangzi immediately after the Daode jing. A third\ntext, the Liezi, has fallen into a sort of limbo, especially\nafter A.C. Graham demonstrated that parts of the received text are not\nauthentic and date from not earlier than the 2nd century CE (instead of the\n4th century BCE, as was supposed earlier; Graham 1961).\nRecently, however, there have been efforts to rehabilitate this work\n(Barrett 2011), also motivated by the fact that it appears to contain\nlost fragments of the Zhuangzi. \nCurrent Western scholarship is virtually unanimous in asserting that\nthere was no historical Laozi. The reputed author of the Daode\njing, whose name means Old Master, might be best seen as a\n“collective entity” who embodies the nameless\ntradition—mainly oral, as far as we know—that is behind\nthe text and the ideal of sainthood that the text describes. \nWhile the author and his work are traditionally dated to the\n6th century BCE, the Mawangdui and especially the Guodian manuscripts\n(discovered in 1972 and 1993, respectively; Henricks 1989 and 2000)\nhave helped to establish that early exemplars of the Daode\njing—shorter than the current versions and different from\none another—circulated by the latter half of the 4th\ncentury BCE. It is also usually acknowledged, though, that the text\nincorporates earlier oral traditions. While this makes the issue of\ndating virtually impossible to solve, it also suggests that at first\nthere was no “original” and “complete”\nexemplar of the text, which probably existed in several versions of\nvarying content and length until, probably in the late 3rd\ncentury BCE, it was compiled in a form close to the one we know today.\n(For overviews of the Daode jing and its exegetical\ntradition, see Chan 2000 and Robinet 1999, respectively.) \nThe Daode jing discusses three main subjects: the Dao, the\nsaint (or the realized person), and the ruler and his government.\nSeveral early Chinese traditions speak of a Dao, or “Way”,\nbut the Daode jing is the earliest source that uses this word\nto designate the origin and source of existence. As the absolute\nprinciple, the Dao is beyond description or definition. It does not\neven have a name: the word dao is used only because one\n“is forced” to refer to it (sec. 25). [Here and below,\nreferences are to the number of section in the 81-section editions of\nthe text, a subdivision also adopted in most translations into\nWestern languages.] Being formless, the Dao is “constant”\n(chang, 1), does not undergo change (41), and is\n“invisible”, “inaudible”, and\n“imperceptible” (14). Yet the Dao contains an\n“essence” (jing) that is the seed of its\nself-manifestation (21), which occurs without intention and through\n“non-doing” (wuwei; 37). The faculty through\nwhich the Dao manifests itself, and generates and nourishes all\nindividual entities, is its de, or “virtue,\npower”, the second term in the title of the Daode jing.\nUnder this aspect, the Dao is called the “beginning” of\nthe world and its “mother” (1). The two aspects of the\nDao—the absolute and its manifestation as the\nrelative—“come forth together”, and their\ncoexistence is “mystery and then again mystery” (1). \nThe highest realized person in the Daode jing is the\nshengren, a term that, in a Daoist context, is sometimes\ntranslated as “saint” to distinguish it from the Confucian\n“sage”. While the Confucian sage embodies the highest\nethical standards of benevolence (ren) and righteousness\n(yi), the Daoist saint operates in the world by taking the\noperation of the Dao as his model: according to the Daode\njing, benevolence, righteousness, and the other qualities of the\nConfucian sage emerge only “when the Dao is abandoned”\n(18). The Daoist saint does not act on the basis of personal interest,\nadvantage, or desire; he does not take initiative; and he does not\nintend to lead others (3, 7, 22, 37, 57, 67). Instead, he is in the\nfront by placing himself “behind”, and acts only by\nresponding to what external circumstances require. This is his\n“non-doing” (wuwei), the perfect action in which “there is\nno doing, yet nothing is not done” (48; the same is also said of\nthe operation of the Dao, 37). \nAlthough the reciprocal tasks are different, the ruler is supposed to\noperate in the kingdom in the same way as the saint operates in the world. The\nDaode jing expresses this view in words analogous to those\nquoted above for the saint: “Do non-doing, and there is nothing\nthat is not governed” (3). This involves that the ruler should\nissue few laws and prohibitions (57) and instead allow the people to\noperate by themselves (37). Since the Confucian virtues arise\n“when the Dao is abandoned” and “when the country is\nin confusion” (5, 18), the saintly ruler should not use them as\nprinciples of government. \nZhuangzi—whose name was Zhuang Zhou—probably lived between\n370 and 280 BCE. He wrote the “Inner Chapters” (1–7)\nof the eponymous work, which form the first of its three main parts.\nThe two other parts, namely the “Outer Chapters”\n(8–22) and the “Miscellaneous Chapters”\n(23–33), contain writings by different groups of authors. (For\noverviews of the Zhuangzi, its textual layers, and its\ncommentaries, see Graham 1989: 170–211; Mair 2000; and Roth\n2014.) \nZhuangzi’s view of the Dao is in agreement with Laozi’s\nview:  \nThe Way has its reality and its signs but is without action or form.\nYou can hand it down but you cannot receive it; you can get it but you\ncannot see it. It is its own source, its own root. Before Heaven and\nEarth existed it was there, firm from ancient times. (ch. 6; trans.\nWatson 1968: 81)  \nHowever, Zhuangzi repeatedly brings forth the issue of whether and how\nthe Dao can be known. As the Dao is the absolute, it cannot be made an\nobject; therefore its knowledge cannot be attained by the ordinary\nmind, which functions by establishing distinctions between “self\nand other”, “this and that”, “right and\nwrong”, and other relative concepts (ch. 2; Watson,\n36–49). Zhuangzi’s analysis of the human mind is in fact\nan epistemology: since the Dao is ultimately unknowable through the\nordinary mind, there is only one way to know it: through “the\nknowledge that does not know” (ch. 4; Watson, 58). \nThe human ideal of Zhuangzi reflects this view:  \nThe True Man (or realized person, zhenren) of ancient times\ndid not rebel against want, did not grow proud in plenty, and did not\nplan his affairs … [He] was able to climb all the way up to the\nWay … [He] knew nothing of loving life, knew nothing of hating\ndeath. (ch. 6; Watson, 77–78)  \nIn the Zhuangzi, the theme of “inner freedom”\nreceives more emphasis compared to the Daode jing: freedom\nfrom social rules, from ingrained patterns of thought, from\n“essentialism” (the belief that things have permanent\ncharacteristics that make them what they are), and from conventional\n“self-identity”. \nIn the “Inner Chapters”, the refusal to elevate ethics to\na primary principle follows the views of the Daode jing:  \nThe way I see it, the rules of benevolence and righteousness and the\npaths of right and wrong are all hopelessly snarled and jumbled. (ch.\n2; Watson, 45–46)  \nIn agreement with this view, Zhuangzi is disillusioned about the\npossibility of using ordinary ethical virtues as a basis for politics\nand government:  \nTo try to govern the world like this is like trying to walk the ocean,\nto drill through a river, or to make a mosquito shoulder a mountain!\n(ch. 7; Watson, 93; see also 66–67)  \nFor Zhuangzi, the enlightened ruler is the one whose achievements\n“appear not to be his own doing”. Thus “the people\ndo not depend on him … [and] he lets everything find its own\nenjoyment” (ch. 7; Watson, 94). The speaker of this passage is\nLaozi himself, whose views on “non-doing” in government\nare accepted by Zhuangzi. \nThe Zhuangzi began to have a noticeable influence on the\nlater Daoist tradition from the 4th century CE, when it\nbecame one of the sources of inspiration for the Shangqing (Highest\nClarity) school of Daoism (see\n §3.3).\n Since then, this work has contributed an impressive number of ideas,\nconcepts, and terms to later Daoist works (Robinet 1983). These\ninclude the “fasting of the mind” (xinzhai; ch.\n4; Watson, 54–58) and the “sitting and forgetting”\n(zuowang; ch. 6; Watson, 90–91), two expressions that\nin later Daoism denote methods of self-cultivation, but in the\nZhuangzi describe the inner state of the realized person.\n(For the view that they refer to actual practices also in the\nZhuangzi, see Roth 1997.) \nIn addition to the teachings of the Daode jing and the figure\nof Laozi, several other major components contributed to the early\ndevelopment of Daoism. Only a few of the most important ones can be\nsurveyed here. \nWe may begin by mentioning exorcism, a set of diverse practices based\non the belief that illnesses and various other disturbances are caused\nby malevolent entities, including demons. The officiant who takes\ncharge of these phenomena is the wu, a term that denotes a\nmale or female medium or healer but is often translated as\n“shaman”. The wu is capable of dealing with the\nrealm of demonic creatures and administers proper remedies—for\nexample, protective talismans (fu) and herbal\nmedicines—to those affected by such creatures. While these and\nanalogous practices have continued to exist throughout the history of\nDaoism, it should be noted that the typical shamanic\n“trance” has never been part of Daoist practices. \nSome scholars have suggested that “shamanism” is related\nto another theme developed by later Daoist traditions: the “far\nroaming” (yuanyou), or imaginary journeys to the\nextremities of the world or to the farthest regions of the cosmos\n(Kohn 1992: 96–104). Best known among these accounts is the\n“Yuanyou” (Far Roaming) poem, dating from the\n2nd century BCE (Kroll 1996). Here the author describes an\n“ecstatic journey” during which he visits the remotest\nregions of the earth, encounters realized beings, ascends to celestial\npalaces, and finally enters the realm of the Great Beginning\n(taichu). Later Daoist traditions have used the “far\nroaming” imagery in different contexts: breathing techniques for\nthe absorption of the pure energies (qi) found at the\nboundaries of the cosmos, meditation practices that involve walking on\nconstellations in the heavens, and accounts of initiatory journeys to\nthe four directions of the world made by saints and immortals, who\nfind texts and receive teachings from divine beings (see\n §9.3). \nBesides the wu, a quite different class of practitioners is\nknown under the collective name of fangshi (“masters of\nthe methods” or “of the recipes”). While they also\noperated within society as a whole, many fangshi were\nemployed by rulers from the 4th century BCE onwards. Their\nfields of expertise included different cosmological and esoteric arts:\nastronomy and astrology; divination and hemerology; medicine and\nhealing; alchemy; and sexual, breathing, and other longevity\npractices. In Anna Seidel’s felicitous definition (1983a: 294),\nthe fangshi were people who had the “know-how”.\nIn a broader perspective, it is important to note that several methods\noriginally associated with the fangshi were later\nincorporated into Daoist practices. With this class of practitioners,\nwe are in fact much closer to what Daoism would become in later times:\nas noted by John Lagerwey (1986: 282–83), not the\n“shaman” (with his or her ecstasies and trances), but the\n“diviner” (who fashions a “rational” world\nrelying on images and emblems with precise meanings and functions)\nis the predecessor of the Daoist master and the Daoist priest. \nUnlike those of the wu, several practices associated with the\nfangshi—in particular, their mantic arts—were\nbased on the Chinese cosmological system, which took shape in the\n3rd and 2nd centuries BCE (Harper 1999;\nCsikszentmihalyi 2000; Kalinowski 2004). Notes on the main features of\nthis system and its uses in Daoism will be found below\n (§4.3).\n Here we should briefly note two points. First, Chinese cosmology is\nnot tied to any particular intellectual or technical legacy. Its\ncreation can be seen as the result of an effort to create a\ncomprehensive system open to application to a large variety of fields,\nwith contributions from specialists of various traditional\nsciences—especially diviners, astronomers, and\nphysicians—and from thinkers of different currents. Second, as\nwas noted by Isabelle Robinet (1997b: 260), “unlike other\nreligions, we must look for the fundamental structure, the unity, and\nthe continuity of Taoism in its cosmological discourse and not in its\npantheon”. While Daoism has had different pantheons in different\ntimes and places (see\n §5.2),\n its views on the relation between Dao and cosmos have remained\nsubstantially unchanged throughout its history, and these views have\nusually been formulated on the basis of the standard Chinese\ncosmological system. \nWith regard to Daoism per se, Huang-Lao dao (Way of\nthe Yellow Emperor and Laozi) is the name under which one part of the\ntradition was known in the early Han period (2nd century\nBCE). The precise contours of this “Way” are unclear, but\nit may be equivalent to the early meaning of the term Daojia\n(“lineage(s) of the Dao”) as defined by Sima Tan (fl. ca.\n135 BCE) in the Shiji (Records of the Historian; see Roth and\nQueen 2000). The Huang-Lao adepts saw Laozi as the master who set\nforth the principles of government in the Daode jing, and\nHuangdi (the Yellow Emperor) as the ruler who applied them for the\nfirst time in human history. Huangdi continued to play the role of the\nperfect “Daoist” ruler in later times: having received\nteachings in various disciplines—medicine, alchemy, sexual\npractices, dietetics, etc.—from different gods, goddesses, and\nimmortals, he would become the patron of some of them. In later times,\nLaozi and Huangdi were even associated with one another as a single\ndeity under the name Huanglao jun, lit., Yellow Old Lord. \nIn addition to the central notion of government by\n“non-doing” (wuwei), the Huang-Lao dao\nappears to have promoted not only other teachings of the Daode\njing, such as the requirement of self-cultivation by the ruler,\nbut also—displaying the first hints of the integration of\nDaode jing teachings and cosmological thought—the\nregulation of political and social life according to cosmic cycles,\nsuch as those of the seasons. The Huang-Lao ideology enjoyed some\nsuccess at court during the early decades of the Han dynasty, but\nquietly disappeared after Confucianism was adopted as official state\ndoctrine by Emperor Wu of the Han (r. 140–87 BCE). Nevertheless,\nits political views continued to form one of the bases of the Daoist\nteachings. \nIn the past few decades, scholars have described some excavated\nmanuscripts as Huang-Lao sources (e.g., Yates 1997), but no firm\nconclusion has been reached on this point. The same is true of the\nHuainan zi (The Master of Huainan), a major work completed in\n139 BCE under the patronage of Liu An (180–122 BCE), the ruler\nof the southern kingdom of Huainan (in present-day Anhui). The\nHuainan zi contains sections devoted to thought, government,\nself-cultivation, ethics, mythology, hagiography, astronomy,\ntopography, music, military affairs, and other traditional sciences\n(Le Blanc and Mathieu 2003; Major et al. 2010). Its aims of\nsynthesis are also shown by more than 800 quotations drawn from other\ntexts, including about one hundred from the Daode jing and\nover 250 from the Zhuangzi. Yet, although the Huainan\nzi is included in the Daoist Canon and later Daoist hagiography\nhas welcomed Liu An as an “immortal”, the text as a whole\ncan hardly be described as Daoist. In a historical perspective, the\nHuainan zi is, rather, the main source that documents the\nintegration of early Daoist thought with cosmology and with several\ncosmological sciences. More broadly, as was noted by Nathan Sivin\n(1995), it is one of a series of important texts, written between the\n3rd and the 1st century BCE, that provide\nextensive overviews of cosmology, government, and self-cultivation in\nview of the creation of a comprehensive ideology that would serve as\nthe foundation for a newly created Chinese empire. These works also\ninclude the Lüshi chunqiu (Springs and Autumns of Sire\nLü; Knoblock and Riegel 2001), the Chunqiu fanlu\n(Luxuriant Dew on the Spring and Autumn Annals; Queen 1996),\nand—with focus on medicine, but sharing the same\nfoundations—the Huangdi neijing (Inner Book of the\nYellow Emperor; Unschuld and Tessenow 2011). \nIn addition to the components outlined above, the process that, in the\nsecond half of the 2nd century CE, led to the formation of\nthe first major Daoist religious movement (see\n §3.1)\n could not be understood without paying attention to the political\nideologies of ancient China. These ideologies are synthesized in the\nconcept of the Great Peace (taiping), which was shared by\ndifferent traditions including Confucianism (Seidel 1983b; Espesset\n2009). With regard to Daoism, the main source that documents these\nviews is the Taiping jing (Book of the Great Peace),\noriginally dating from the 1st or the 2nd\ncenturies CE (Hendrischke 2006). The central idea in the Taiping\njing is the advent of an era of “peace”\n(ping, also meaning “equity”) in which a perfect\nruler would establish a perfect society. This era would follow\ncalamities designed to eliminate the corrupted ones, but would come\nonly if the ruler governs according to the principle of\n“returning to the Dao”. \nThe views of the Taiping jing are the first important example of\nChinese millenarianism, which would become a further major theme in\nthe Daoist tradition from the 2nd until at least the\n7th centuries (Mollier 2008b). Amid the social tumults and\nthe natural calamities that marked the last part of the Han rule,\nexpectations and prophecies of a forthcoming messiah—often\npredicted to be surnamed Li—grew during the 2nd\ncentury of our era (Seidel 1969–70 and 1983b). \nThat savior turned out to be Laozi himself—one of whose names was Li\nEr—who became a deity under the name of Laojun, or Lord Lao (Seidel\n1969). In 165 and 166, rites were celebrated in Huxian, Laozi’s\nsupposed birthplace; and in 166, Emperor Huan (r. 147–168)\nperformed—for the first and only time in Chinese history—a\nceremony in his honor in the imperial palace. However, the deification\nprocess may have begun even earlier, and the possibility that the\n“secular” Laozi was already the object of cults is\nsuggested by one of the main sources on his deification, namely the Laozi\nming (Inscription for Laozi; Seidel 1969: 43–50 and\n121–28; Csikszentmihalyi 2006: 105–12). This work, written on the\noccasion of Emperor Huan’s ceremony, contains a biography of\nLaozi, an account of the events that led Huan to perform the rite, and\na poetical eulogy of Laozi as a saint who follows the doctrines of\n“non-doing” and eliminating desires. Significantly, in\nthis source Laozi is not yet called “god” (shen)\nand not even “lord” (jun). \nThe Laozi bianhua jing (Book of the Transformations of\nLaozi), dating from the late 2nd century and possibly\noriginating from a popular cult in Sichuan (Seidel 1969: 59–75),\nenjoins recitation of the Daode jing and confession of sins,\nand is the first of several works that mention one of the main\nfeatures of Laozi as a deity: in addition to personifying the Dao and\nto being a model of the Daoist sage, Lord Lao periodically descends to\nearth in order to bestow teachings to humanity and especially to\nrulers. This has two important consequences. First, from this time\nonwards the Dao takes an active role in the human world, either\nthrough its divine emissaries or by granting revelations to certain\nadepts. Second, the “historical” Laozi—the author of\nthe Daode jing—is only one of the different forms that\nLord Lao has taken in order to guide humanity. \nThis section does not intend to provide a historical overview of the\nDaoist tradition, but only brief notes on its principal schools and\nlineages. (The only book-length study of the history of Daoism in a\nWestern language is Robinet 1997b, which however only covers the period from the\norigins to the 14th century. Shorter, reliable historical surveys\ninclude Schipper 2000 and Bokenkamp 2005a.) \nIn one of his transformations, Laojun (Lord Lao) appeared—in 142\nCE, according to the traditional date—to Zhang Daoling and\nestablished with him the Covenant with the Powers of Orthodox Unity\n(zhengyi mengwei). Zhang Daoling, who may have been a healer,\nwas named Celestial Master (tianshi), and he in turn pledged\nto establish a community that would follow Daoist principles. His\ngrandson and third Celestial Master, Zhang Lu, created and presided\nover a politically and economically autonomous “theocracy”\nin Hanzhong (in present-day Sichuan), subdivided into 24 zhi\n(“administrations”, sometimes rendered as\n“parishes” by scholars who see analogies with the early\nChristian Church). \nSince its origins, Tianshi dao, or the Way of the Celestial\nMasters, proposed to provide an exemplary and comprehensive model of\nreligious and social organization (Hendrischke 2000; Schipper 2008;\nKleeman 2010 and 2016). The population was organized and governed on the basis\nof “registers” (lu), which existed in two forms:\nhousehold registers (recording births, marriages, and deaths) and\nindividual registers (conferring rank in the social and celestial\nbureaucracies, and listing the spirits under a person’s command,\nwhose number increased according to age). Healing rites were one of\nthe main practices. Importantly, illnesses were seen as owed neither\nto demonic influences (as in exorcism) nor to imbalance of cosmic forces (as in classical medicine), but to moral\nfaults. As part of the healing ritual, an officiant submitted\npetitions—reporting the petitioner’s fault, confession,\nrepentance, and request for aid—to the Officers of Earth, Water,\nand Heaven, the three main original Tianshi dao deities. An analogous\nemphasis on ethics and morals is the main feature of the best-known\nearly Tianshi dao text, a partially-preserved commentary to the\nDaode jing (Bokenkamp 1997: 29–148). \nThe diaspora of the Celestial Masters’ communities after the end\nof the Han (early 3rd century) had the unintended result of\nspreading the religion throughout China. Under the name Way of the\nCorrect Unity (Zhengyi dao), Tianshi dao is in the present day one of the two\nmain branches of Daoism, where it takes charge of\nthe main forms of communal ritual. \nAfter the period of the Three Kingdoms (220–80), China was\nreunified by the Jin dynasty. Unification, however, lasted only for a\nfew decades. The southward migrations that followed the fall of the\ncapital Luoyang to the Xiongnu in 311 involved not only members of the\ncourt and the aristocracy, but also representatives of Tianshi dao. As\na result, the religion of the Celestial Masters reached Jiangnan, the\nregion south of the lower Yangzi river, and apparently for the first time came in\ntouch with the traditions of that region. The events that followed\nleft a permanent mark on the history of Daoism. \nThe native “Southern tradition” comprised methods for\nsummoning benevolent deities and expelling demonic entities, various\ntypes of “longevity practices”, as well as meditation and\nalchemy (Andersen 1994; Campany 2002: 18–97; Steavu 2015). A\nsurvey of these traditions is given by Ge Hong (283–343) in the\n“Inner Chapters” (“Neipian”) of his Baopu\nzi (Book of the Master Who Embraces Spontaneous Nature, ca. 320).\nThis work (trans. Ware 1966; part. trans. Che 1999) provides a comprehensive overview of\nreligion in Jiangnan shortly before the arrival of the Celestial\nMasters, seen through the eyes of a member of one of the main families\nof Jiangnan aristocracy. \nAccording to Ge Hong, three textual bodies incorporated the higher\nreligious traditions of Jiangnan. The first consisted of scriptures\nbased on talismans (fu), mainly represented by the\nSanhuang wen (Script of the Three Sovereigns; Steavu 2019). Owning them,\nor even holding them in one’s hands, granted protection against\nassaults of demons, dangers brought by external forces, and even\ndeath. The second and third textual bodies were based on meditation\nand alchemy, respectively, described by Ge Hong as the highest forms of\nself-cultivation. The main meditation practice is “guarding the\nOne” (shouyi), which consists in visualizing the god\nthat represents Unity in its multiple residences within the human\nbeing. Alchemical elixirs, instead, were superior to herbal drugs:\nwhile the “medicines of herbs and plants” can only heal\nillnesses and grant a long life, the elixirs grant immortality. \nAgainst this background, the representatives of the religious legacies\nof Jiangnan responded to the newly-imported cults and rites of the\nCelestial Masters by reformulating and recodifying certain aspects of\ntheir own traditions in ways that also admitted elements of the new\nreligion. This led to the creation of two major new\n“schools”, which actually consist in two textual corpora\nand the related practices. The first one is Shangqing\n(Highest Clarity), based on revelations that occurred from 364 to 370\nnear present-day Nanjing (Strickmann 1977; Robinet 2000). Its main\nscripture, the Dadong zhenjing (True Book of the Great\nCavern), describes visualization methods of the inner gods, including\nillustrations, chants, and talismans (fu). This and other\nworks make clear that Shangqing incorporates earlier traditions, but\nreorganizes and ranks them in a different way compared to the past:\nmeditation is now the main practice, and even alchemy is modified to\ninclude processes that cannot take place in the laboratory but only\nwithin the adept’s own person. \nWhile the main function of the Shangqing master is to transmit texts\nand oral instructions, the priest is at the center of the second\ncorpus. The Lingbao (Numinous Treasure) revelations occurred\nin the years 397–402, when Ge Chaofu—Ge Hong’s\ngrand-nephew—received another set of scriptures (Bokenkamp 1983;\nYamada 2000). The Lingbao synthesis of different traditions is even\nmore visible compared to Shangqing: it incorporates elements of\nTianshi dao ritual and pantheon, as well as certain aspects of\nShangqing itself (including visualization, performed for instance by the\npriest when he sends off his own inner gods to submit petitions to the\nhighest celestial deities). In addition, Lingbao shows the first\nsubstantial signs of the integration of Buddhist elements into Daoism:\nin particular, its notion of “universal salvation”\n(including a version of the “Bodhisattva vow”) and also\nits cosmology, reflected in a system of ranked “heavens”\n(see\n §5.1).\n At the center of Lingbao lies communal ritual. The new codification\nby Lu Xiujing (406–77), which followed the original revelations\nby a few decades, served as the blueprint for several later ones, and\nclear traces of it are still apparent in present-day Daoist\nritual. \nWith the creation of the Shangqing and Lingbao corpora, Daoism for the\nfirst time clearly defined its two main poles, which consist of both\nindividual practices (codified in the Shangqing corpus) and communal\npractices (codified in the Lingbao corpus). In the 5th\ncentury, the relations among these corpora and the other traditions of\nJiangnan were formally defined in the system of the Three Caverns\n(sandong), which is traditionally attributed to Lu Xiujing\nbut clearly reflects the perspectives of the Daoist community as a\nwhole (Schipper and Verellen 2004: 14–17). In this system, the\nmain Daoist traditions and scriptural corpora of southeastern China\nare arranged into three hierarchical groups, namely (1) Shangqing, (2)\nLingbao, and (3) Sanhuang (Three Sovereigns, understood as\nthe Sanhuang wen and related textual materials). Each Cavern\ncorresponds to a heaven and is ruled by one of the three highest\nDaoist gods: Yuanshi tianzun (Celestial Venerable of the Original\nCommencement), Lingbao tianzun (Celestial Venerable of the Numinous\nTreasure), and Daode tianzun (Celestial Venerable of the Dao and Its\nVirtue, another name of the deified Laozi). The Three Caverns also\nprovided a model for other aspects of doctrine and practice, including\nthe ranks of priestly ordination and the classification of scriptures\nin the future Daoist Canons (id., 17–37). (On the Daoist Canon\nsee Schipper and Verellen 2004; a shorter survey is found in Bokenkamp\nand Boltz 1986.) \nThe founding of the Tang dynasty (618–907) was accompanied by\nmillenarian prophecies about the advent of a sage-emperor surnamed Li (Bokenkamp\n1994). As we saw before\n (§2.5),\n this was also the surname of the Han-dynasty messiah; four centuries later, the\npowerful Li clan claimed to belong to Laozi’s lineage, and its\nrise to the throne was supported by representatives of the Shangqing\nlineage. The Shangqing patriarch Wang Yuanzhi (528–635) predicted the\nrise of the Tang, informed Li Yuan that he would become the next\nemperor, and secretly transmitted to him the “registers”\nof the Celestial Mandate (tianming). Li Yuan—the future Emperor Gaozu—finally founded\nthe Tang dynasty. These events marked the beginning\nof the ascent of Shangqing to a status similar to “state\nreligion”, which it maintained throughout the first half of the\ndynasty (Barrett 1996; Kohn and Kirkland 2000). The support of the\ncourt culminated in ca. 740 with the compilation of the Kaiyuan\ndaozang (Daoist Canon of the Kaiyuan Reign Period), the first of\na series of imperially-sponsored collections of Daoist texts. \nWhile the disastrous An Lushan rebellion of 755–63 put an end to\nthe glory of the Tang dynasty, for Daoism as a whole the Tang was an\nage of consolidation, but also of major changes and innovations. With\nregard to ritual, the Tang period and the successive decades of the\nFive Dynasties (907–60) were marked by two important new\ncodifications, respectively created by Zhang Wanfu (fl. 710–13;\nBenn 1991) and by Du Guangting (850–933), one of the foremost\n“court Daoists” of all times (Verellen 1989). After its\nintroduction in the 1st century and its development during\nthe Six Dynasties, in the Tang period Buddhism became substantially\n“sinified” with the rise of new schools, the most\nimportant of which are Tiantai and Chan (Jpn. Zen), and with the\nspread of “popular” Tantric practices. (On Daoism and\nBuddhism see Zürcher 1980 and Mollier 2008a; for an overview of\nthe main points, see Bokenkamp 2004.) This led to two phenomena that\nbecame constant in the second millennium: competition for state\npatronage, on the one hand, and repeated attempts to synthesize the\n“Three Teachings” (Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism), on\nthe other. Intersections of Daoist and Buddhist thought and religion\nare visible in doctrines (Robinet 2004), cults (with several shared\ndeities, e.g., Avalokiteśvara/Guanyin; Mollier 2008a,\n174–208), and meditation practices (see\n §9.4). \nFinally, this period marked not only the highest stage of development\nof Waidan (External Alchemy), but also the beginnings of\nNeidan (Internal Alchemy; see\n §10).\n The first clearly identifiable Neidan lineage is the Zhong-Lü\n(named after the two immortals, Zhongli Quan and Lü Dongbin),\nwhich appears to have developed from the second half of the Tang\nperiod. \nAfter China was reunified by the Song dynasty (960–1279), major\nchanges in society—in particular urbanization, the creation of a\nmarket economy, and the rise to prominence of new classes, especially\nin the southeastern regions—led to major transformations in\nreligion. The institution of “lay associations”, whose\nmain function was (in addition to performing various meritorious\nactions) supporting the local temple, was especially important in the\ndevelopment of Daoism, and at the same time in furthering the\nincorporation of cults to local deities and saints into the Daoist\npantheon and liturgy. \nThe Way of the Celestial Masters (then based at Mount Longhu, in\npresent-day Jiangxi) was officially assigned the task of ordaining\npriests, but a series of revelations resulted in the creation of\nlineages that, in several cases, claimed to have been\noriginated by Zhang Daoling himself. Between the mid-10th\nand the mid-13th centuries, five main lineages were\nestablished: Tianxin (Celestial Heart), Shenxiao\n(Divine Empyrean), Yutang dafa (Great Rites of the Jade\nHall), Lingbao dafa (Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure),\nand Qingwei (Pure Tenuity). All of them were based on\ndifferent codifications of ritual—including exorcist\nrites—but with little variation in the basic practices (Boltz 1987:\n26–49; Skar 2000). Local communities, in addition, had their own\nritual specialists, known as fashi (“ritual\nmasters”), a term that designated, as it still does in the\npresent day, lay officiants who specialize in exorcist practices\n(Davis 2001). \nThe Song dynasty and the successive Mongol Yuan dynasty\n(1271–1368) also saw important developments in the traditions of\nInternal Alchemy (Neidan), especially with the creation of\nNanzong, the Southern Lineage, which is ascribed with one of\nthe main codifications of the alchemical practice (see\n §10.3). \nIn 1127, the Jurchen Jin dynasty (1115–1234) captured Kaifeng,\nand the Song dynasty was obliged to move its capital to Hangzhou,\nestablishing the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279). It was under\nthe Jin rule that Quanzhen (Complete Reality, or Complete Perfection)\nwas created (Yao 2000; Goossaert 2001; Marsone 2010). This monastic\norder is, with the Way of the Celestial Masters, the main branch of\npresent-day Daoism. \nQuanzhen was founded by Wang Zhe (1113–70), who was active as a\npreacher in Shandong in the late 1160s, and by his seven main\ndisciples, among whom Ma Yu, Sun Bu’er (the latter’s\nwife), and Qiu Chuji deserve mention. Five “lay\nassociations” were established to support the teaching, which\nspread rapidly. Controversies with Buddhism led to proscriptions in\nthe second half of the 13th century, which included the\nburning of a Daoist Canon recently compiled by Quanzhen\nrepresentatives. Quanzhen, however, maintained a strong local\npresence, and after the reunification of China under the Yuan dynasty\nit obtained again the favor of the court. While the Ming dynasty\n(1368–1644) gave priority to the Celestial Masters, Wang\nChangyue (1592–1680) gained the support of the newly-established\nManchu Qing dynasty (1644–1912). Since then, his\nLongmen (Dragon Gate) lineage has been the main branch of\nQuanzhen (Esposito 2004). In the present day, Wang Changyue’s temple, the Baiyun\nGuan (Abbey of the White Cloud) in Beijing, is the\nseat of the China Daoist Association (Zhongguo daojiao xiehui). \nUnlike Tianshi dao, whose priests are married and live with their\nfamilies, Quanzhen is a celibate monastic order, and under this form\nit has propagated mainly in northern China. In addition to certain\nforms of ritual, the main practices of Quanzhen monks include\nmeditation and Internal Alchemy (Eskildson 2004). However, the overall\nimage of Quanzhen (and Longmen) is complex, as it also includes\nnon-institutional and non-monastic forms. At their origins lies the\nfact that Wang Zhe and his seven disciples are also identified as the\nso-called Beizong, or Northern Lineage, of Neidan; and especially the\nfact that Longmen as a whole traces its origins to the above-mentioned\nQiu Chuji, who is traditionally known as a Neidan practitioner. From\nthe Yuan period onwards, therefore, several masters and adepts of\nNeidan have claimed affiliation to Quanzhen and/or Longmen, and have\ncreated innumerable sub-lineages throughout China with little or no\nconnection to the central institution. \nThis and the following three sections are concerned with subjects that\nare relevant to Daoism as a whole: cosmology, gods and rituals,\nsoteriology, and the views of the human being and the human body. In\ndifferent ways and to different extents, all of them have contributed\nto frame doctrines and practices of several Daoist schools or\nlineages. \nWhether it addresses itself to the community or the individual, Daoism\npurports to provide ways and methods for “returning to the\nDao” (fandao, huandao). Discussing the main\npoints of doctrine before approaching their particular subjects\nis—in addition to references to Laozi and the Daode\njing, already noted above—the other main way used in Daoist\ntexts to declare their affiliation to Daoism. \nIn the Daoist view, the Dao is both the “ultimateless” (or\n“limitless”, wuji, a term akin in meaning to\n“absolute” or “infinite”) and the “great\nultimate” (taiji). In the first sense, the Dao is\ndevoid of definition, determination, form, name, attributes, and\nqualities. Yet, it comprises all definitions,\ndeterminations, forms, etc., none of which could exist outside it.\nFrom the perspective of the “ten thousand things”\n(wanwu, the objects and phenomena that exist and occur in the\nmanifested world), all that can be said is that they come about\n“within” the Dao, but the Dao is not the same as any of\nthem, or else it would be subject to, and limited by, their\nindividuality, form, change, and transitoriness. When the Dao, in the\nsecond sense, is understood as the “great ultimate”, it is\nseen as the supreme principle of Unity. This Unity, or Oneness, is\nmeant as the transcendent unity both beyond multiplicity (1 as the\norigin of numbers, but itself not a number) and as the origin of the\nmany (1 as the first number). \nIn the Daode jing, these two aspects of the Dao correspond to\nthe Dao as “absolute” and as “mother”. The two\nmain ontologic and cosmogonic stages respectively prior and posterior\nto the creatio continua of the cosmos are often referred to\nas xiantian (precelestial, “before Heaven”) and\nhoutian (postcelestial, “after Heaven”). \nWith its self-manifestation, the Dao gives birth to the three main\ncomponents of the cosmos. Collectively called the\n“three treasures” (sanbao), these components are\njing, or Essence, qi, or Breath, and shen,\nor Spirit.[1]\nEach of them has two aspects, related to their unmanifested or\n“precelestial” natures and to their\n“postcelestial” forms in the manifested world. The same\nthree components are also seen as the primary components of the human\nbeing. \nIn their precosmic aspects, shen, qi, and\njing (in this order) represent three consecutive stages in\nthe process of the generation of the cosmos, from the initial state of\nNon-Being and Emptiness (wu, xu) to the coagulation\nof the Essence that finally generates the “ten thousand\nthings”. Shen is the principle that presides over\nnon-material entities (including the celestial deities, which are also\ncalled shen, “spirits” or “gods”);\njing is the principle that presides over material entities;\nand qi is the principle that maintains the whole cosmos for\nits entire extent and duration and throughout its continuous changes.\nUnder these aspects, jing, qi, and shen are\nusually prefixed by the word yuan, “original”\n(yuanjing, yuanqi, yuanshen). In certain\ncases, Original Breath (yuanqi) is also seen as a principle\nprior to the emergence of Essence, Breath, and Spirit; when it is used\nin this sense, it is also called Ancestral Breath (zuqi) and\nis equated to the Dao itself. \nIn the manifested world, the three components take on different\naspects. With regard to the human being, shen emerges as the\nmind (the “cognitive spirit”, shishen, or\n“thinking spirit”, sishen); qi appears\nas breath; and the main materializations of jing are—in\naddition to other liquid components of the body, such as saliva and\ntears—semen in men and menstrual blood in women. \nTo explain the relation between Dao and cosmos, the Daode\njing describes a sequence of states taken on by the Dao,\nincluding the Dao itself, unity, duality (Yin and\nYang), and finally multiplicity: “The Dao generates the\nOne; the One generates the Two; the Two generate the Three; the Three\ngenerate the Ten Thousand Things” (sec. 42). This basic sequence\nis always respected even though other texts or authors may mention\nadditional intermediate stages or exclude them (as does the\nZhuangzi: “The ten thousand things come forth from\nNon-Being”; ch. 23; Watson 1968: 257). The vertical arrangement\nof the stages illustrates the process of descent from\nthe Dao to the cosmos, but also implies—and often explicitly\noutlines—a corresponding process of ascent from\nthe cosmos to the Dao, to be performed gradually and with the support of suitable\npractices. \nWhen this hierarchical arrangement is represented as a sequence of\nmetaphoric time stages, the discourse shifts from ontology to cosmogony. In\naddition to the one mentioned above, Daoism has elaborated several\nother accounts of cosmogony during its history (Robinet 1997a). Many\nof them focus on hundun, a term usually rendered as\n“chaos” or “the inchoate”, in the sense of\nsomething that has just begun to be and therefore is not yet fully\nformed or developed, but from which the cosmos finally emerges (cf.\nDaode jing 25: “There is something inchoate and yet\naccomplished, born before Heaven and Earth”). In a famous\npassage of the Zhuangzi, this state is represented by an\nemperor called Hundun who ruled “on the Center”. As his\nbody had no openings, the Emperors of the North and of the South\ndecided to make him look similar to a human, providing him with eyes, ears, nostrils, and mouth. “Each day they\nbored one opening, and on the seventh day Hundun died” (ch. 7;\nWatson 1968: 97). As shown by Norman Girardot (1983: 113–33),\nthis story attributes the cause of Hundun’s death and the shift\nfrom chaos to cosmos not only to the emergence of duality—the\nEmperors of the North and the South—but also to the creation of\nsocial institutions. What brings the harmony of the “chaotic\norder” to an end is the emergence of the “social\norder”. \nAmong later accounts (Kohn 1998: 179–97; Robinet 2002), Laojun\n(Lord Lao) began to be seen as the “body” of the Dao, from\nwhich the cosmos is generated (Seidel 1969: 84–91). The Way of\nthe Celestial Masters (Bokenkamp 1997: 188–92; Seidel 1969:\n79–84) and Lingbao Daoism (Lagerwey 1981: 104; Bokenkamp 1997:\n380–81; Robinet 2002: 148–55) also created their own\ncosmogonies. \nAfter the cosmos is generated, it is subject to the laws of cosmology.\nThe Chinese cosmological system—often called “correlative\ncosmology” by Western scholars—is a structured and\ncoherent corpus of knowledge that uses abstract emblems\n(xiang, lit. “images”) to analyze and explain the\nfeatures of the cosmic domain and the relations that occur among its\ncomponents (Schwartz 1985: 350–82; Graham 1989: 319–56;\nKalinowski 1991). Among the main emblems are the following: \nIn addition to those mentioned above, Daoist traditions draw several\nother images, concepts, and terms from the standard Chinese\ncosmological system, but one point requires mention. Cosmology\nprovides Daoism with tools to represent the unfolding of Unity into\nmultiplicity; to express the relation between Dao, cosmos, and human\nbeing; and to frame practices supported by microcosmic\nframeworks—the ritual area, the alchemical laboratory, or the\nhuman body itself. These practices aim to provide means for\n“returning to the Dao”. This implies that, while the\nemblems of cosmology are suitable to represent the differentiation of\nUnity into the “ten thousand things”, they also serve as\npointers for reverting from the “ten thousand things” to\nUnity. To give one example, alchemists often represent the return to\nUnity as the reduction of the five agents to three and then to\none. \nIn China, the boundaries among Daoism, Buddhism, and the common\nreligion are much less marked compared to those among monotheistic\nreligions. According to individual needs and circumstances, lay\npersons may perform cults and address prayers and petitions\nindifferently to Daoist, Buddhist, or popular deities. \nThis has placed Daoism in close touch with the common religion, but\nhas also been the reason for a controversial relation. Daoism attempts\nto undertake the dual task—by no means always\nsuccessful—of drawing people closer to the deities that\nrepresent the Dao, while at the same time responding to their\nimmediate religious demands. As a consequence, in the words of Peter\nNickerson (2008: 148),  \nTaoists, precisely because they relied upon traditions of practice\nthey claimed to have superseded, were compelled to try to distinguish\nthemselves from their popular predecessors and competitors.  \nDemonizing the gods of popular religion was one of the options\n(Mollier 2005): in the course of its history Daoism has prohibited\ncults to minor deities and spirits, just like it has proscribed\nacupuncture (healing is supposed to occur by confession of sins or\nother ritual means overseen by a Daoist officiant) and divination\n(performed by lay specialists who do not belong to Daoist schools or\nlineages). Yet, plenty of examples show that the opposite attitude was\nalso applied. To quote Nickerson again,  \nalready in early medieval times, Taoism was including in its rites a\nnumber of prohibited practices, and the popular cults themselves were\nbeginning to employ Taoist priests. (Nickerson, id.; on this subject\nsee also Stein 1979; Lagerwey 1987: 241–52). \nOne reason at the basis of these divergent—more precisely,\ncontradictory—attitudes may be the intent of exploiting the\npopularity of certain cults and the demand for certain basic religious\nservices. Another reason may be the attempt of not alienating lay\npersons and of paying tribute to local religious traditions. In any of\nthese cases, Daoism incorporates certain practices of common religion\ninto its rites and includes certain gods of common religion into its\npantheon. Yet, the stated purpose of Daoism remains the one of\n“transforming” (hua) the people, a term that in\nthis context means educating them to venerate the deities that\nimpersonate the Dao, instead of relying on cults to minor deities and\nspirits and on rites performed by other officiants—in\nparticular, the spirit-medium. Such cults and rites are defined in\nDaoism as “vulgar” (or “profane”, su)\nand “excessive” (or “illicit”, yin),\nand have been condemned throughout its history (Kleeman 1994). As\nhas been noted, the first competitor of the Daoist priest within local\ncommunities, in past and present times, is not the Buddhist monk or\nthe Confucian officer, but the spirit-medium (Seidel 1997: 62; see\nLagerwey 1987: 216–18, for an amusing but revealing\nepisode). \nDaoism represents the celestial realm as different systems of\n“heavens”, usually arranged hierarchically. In several\ncases, these domains are not only the residences of deities, but also\ncorrespond to degrees of priestly ordination and to inner spiritual\nstates, and are associated with revelations of teachings and textual\ncorpora. The existence of multiple systems reflects the development of\nthe religion. Different traditions created their own systems in order\nto demonstrate that the respective methods derive from a superior\ncelestial domain compared to those of other traditions, and therefore\nare more effective or grant access to a higher spiritual state. \nThe thirty-two heavens of Lingbao are arranged horizontally, with each\nheaven occupying one sector of an imaginary circle. At their center is\nthe Grand Veil (Daluo), the highest celestial domain. The\nlanguage spoken in these heavens is based on sounds represented in a\nform of pseudo-Sanskrit called Secret Language of the Great\nBrahmā (Bokenkamp 1997: 385–89). The thirty-six heavens of\nShangqing, instead, are arranged vertically. This system was created\nafter the Lingbao model and draws in part from it. In one of several\nlists, the highest heaven is again the Grand Veil. Below it are the\nheavens of the Three Clarities, followed by the four heavens of the\n“Seed People” (zhongmin, who survive beyond the end\nof the present cosmic cycle) and further below by the four heavens of\nFormlessness, the eighteen of Form, and the six of Desire. \nAs mentioned above\n (§3.4),\n the Three Clarities (Sanqing) reflect the systematization of\nDaoist traditions after the Shangqing and Lingbao revelations. The\nterm itself defines both the three highest deities and the heavens in\nwhich they reside. While this became the classic Daoist model of the\ncelestial realms, it could be modified in several ways. Different\nsystems were devised in later times; these include the Shenxiao\ncosmography, which places the eponymous Divine Empyrean\n(shenxiao) at the center of nine celestial realms (Boltz\n1987: 26–33; Despeux 2000: 513). \nThe supreme Daoist deities are the Three Clarities (or Three Pures, Sanqing),\neach of which rules over one heaven (for their names, see\n §3.4).\n They are associated with different pre-cosmic eras and are deemed to\nbe at the origins of the textual corpora associated with the Three\nCaverns. Along the history of Daoism, the Three Clarities have been\nsupplemented, but never replaced, by other deities that effectively\nmight share with them the title of “highest Daoist\ndeities”. Most important among them are Taiyi, or Great One, who\nrepresents the fundamental Unity of the cosmos in a deified form; and\nYuhuang, or Jade Sovereign, the highest god of popular religion before\nhis incorporation in the Daoist pantheon in the Song period. \nSeveral other gods, such as the “emperors” (or\n“thearchs”, di) of the five directions, represent\ncosmological principles. In addition, a multitude of deities, most of\nwhich originate from local cults and are shared with the common\nreligion, contribute to form a pantheon that is impossible to describe\nin full, as it takes different forms in different places and times\n(Lagerwey 2010: 19–55; iconography in Little 2000, Delacour et\nal. 2010, Huang 2012, and Fava 2013). To give a few examples, these\ndeities include the Queen Mother of the West (Xiwang Mu, an ancient\ngoddess of the immortals); the Mother of the Dipper (a deity of Indian\norigin, especially associated with children and childbirth); Mazu (a\nwoman who lived in the late 10th century and was deified as\nthe protector of sailors and fishermen, but also of women seeking\nchildren); Zhenwu (the protector of the Ming dynasty, related to the\nNorthern Dipper and provided with exorcist and healing powers);\nMarshall Wen (Wen Yuanshuai, who gave up his life to prevent\n“plague spirits” from poisoning local wells); and the\n“plague spirits” themselves, who are appeased in Daoist\nrituals called Plague Offerings (wenjiao). \nThe highest gods reveal texts, teachings, and methods either directly\nor through their representatives. For instance, the Shangqing and\nLingbao scriptures are deemed to have taken shape from self-generated\ngraphs coagulated from Original Breath (Robinet 1993: 21–24), or\nfrom sounds generated by its vibration (Bokenkamp 1997: 386–87),\nin the early stages of the formation of the cosmos. They were\ntransmitted in Heaven until a “divine being” or an\n“immortal” transcribed them into characters understandable\nto humans. \nJust like the gods usually grant revelations in the form of\nscriptures, the typically Daoist form of communicating with the gods\nis by writing: as Anna Seidel remarked, the Chinese deities\n“neither speak nor listen, but write and read” (1997: 43).\nIn Daoist ritual, the priest delivers a “memorial” (or\n“statement”, shu) to the gods in order to\nannounce the ceremony performed in their honor, declare its purpose,\nspecify its program, and list the names of those who sponsor it\n(Schipper 1974). The so-called talismans (fu, a word almost\nexactly corresponding to the original meaning of Greek\nsymbolon) are traced on paper or other supports in graphs\nhardly comprehensible to humans but intelligible to the gods (Despeux\n2000; Mollier 2003). Like the revealed scriptures—some of which,\nin fact, are deemed to have evolved from them—talismans have\ncounterparts in Heaven, and thus serve to identify and authenticate\ntheir possessors in front of the gods. They confer the power to summon\ncertain deities and to control demons, but also protect space and heal\nillnesses; they are worn on one’s body, affixed at the four\ndirections, placed along the path that leads to one’s dwelling,\nor made into ashes and drunk with water. \nThe two main Daoist ceremonies in the present day are the Offering\n(jiao) and the Merit (gongde) rituals. (On their\nhistory and on earlier forms of ritual see Benn 2000; Andersen 2008;\nLagerwey 2010: 58–93). The Offering ritual (Lagerwey 1987:\n51–167; Schipper 1993: 72–99; Dean 2000: 670–77) is\nperformed to renovate the bond between a community—from the\nvillage to the empire—and its gods. The Merit ritual (Lagerwey\n1987: 169–237) is a funerary ceremony performed to ensure that\nthe deceased is not kept in the netherworld but may ascend to\nHeaven. \nThe communal ritual is requested and organized by the representatives\nof community via the local “lay association”, which is\nalso in charge of the local temple or shrine. The main officiant is\nthe Daoist priest, or daoshi (lit. “Daoist\nmaster”), a function typically transmitted within families. When\nhe receives a request to celebrate an Offering, the daoshi\nconvenes his assistants to perform the ritual. The celebration\ntypically lasts one, two, three, five, or ten days, but arrangements\n(especially the preparation of the necessary paperwork) require a much\nlonger time. While the Offering is celebrated in the temple, a\nfestival is performed in the streets outside, with\nprocessions—the statue of the local tutelary god is carried\nthrough the neighborhood—music, and theatrical performances. In\naddition to this dual “outer” and “inner”\naspect of the celebration, another important distinction is the one\nbetween the portions of the ritual that are public and those that are performed\nbehind closed doors, in which only the priests and selected representatives of the\nlocal community can participate. \nTerms meaning “long life” (shou,\nchangsheng) and “immortality” (busi,\netc.) are among the most recurrent ones in Daoist literature. Both\nhave been understood in different ways according to the perspectives\nof the respective texts and authors. In general, liberation has been\nrepresented in Daoism according to two main models: “union with\nthe Dao” (hedao and similar terms) and incorporation\ninto the celestial bureaucracy (not as a deity, but as an officer of\nthat bureaucracy). The highest form of liberation is often described\nas “ascension to Heaven” (shengtian), attaining\n“celestial immortality” (tianxian), or in\nanalogous terms, but the general concept of immortality has been\nconstrued in many ways. \nAccording to hagiographic works, the Daoist immortals are historical,\nsemi-historical, or entirely legendary persons who transcend the\nlimits of ordinary human existence, sometimes by birth but usually by means of their practices. As\ndescribed by Benjamin Penny (2000: 125–26), their powers include\nthe ability to transform themselves into different creatures or\nobjects; the possession of extraordinary bodies, devoid of signs of\naging and capable of stunning feats; the skill of controlling people,\nanimals, and objects by means of mastery of qi (the\nlife-giving “breath”); the gift of healing; and the\nfaculty of predicting the future. The main power possessed by the\nimmortals, however, is certainly the ability to reach indefinitely\nlong lifespans. It is especially in hagiographic works that the idea\nof human “perfectibility” is understood in a sense that\nis, at the same time, most elementary and most idealistic: not only an\nexceptional longevity, but also the immortality of the physical\nbody. \nThe earliest extant hagiographic collections are the Liexian\nzhuan (Biographies of Exemplary Immortals; Kaltenmark 1953),\nprobably dating from the 1st century BCE, and the\nShenxian zhuan (Biographies of Divine Immortals; Campany\n2002), traditionally attributed to Ge Hong although no conclusive\nevidence is available about his authorship (Penny 1996). With the\nexception of works devoted to a single deity (in particular, Laozi in\nhis divine aspect; Kohn 1998: 7–36), hagiographies contain\nexemplary stories about men and women who have risen to a saintly\nstate (but not a “godlike” state: the immortals are not\ngods). These stories are often related to local cults and reflect oral\ntraditions, but are typically composed by literati, including some who\ndo not have much to do with Daoism but are interested in the\n“extraordinary” and the unusual, or in the preservation of\nlocal traditions. More importantly, hagiographic works are intended\nfor open circulation and are not the object of transmission among\ninitiated or ordained Daoists. One may read them as\n“introductions to Daoism” addressed to the general public,\nwhose knowledge of their subject matter often would not go much beyond\nwhat they read there. \nWhen we look at other sources, belonging to the various traditions\nthat have evolved during the history of Daoism, a different picture\nemerges. These sources show that Daoist adepts did not intend to reach\nimmortality in their physical body; they intended, instead, to make\nuse of their physical body in order to generate a new\n“person” (shen) that is not subject to death. The\nrelated views and practices cover a wide spectrum of Daoism: from the\nearly Way of the Celestial Masters to late Internal Alchemy\n(Neidan). \nSome Daoist texts describe liberation as a rebirth that takes place in\nlife, but only after one forsakes one’s mortal body. In the\nearliest account of this process, related to the Way of the Celestial\nMasters, the adept goes through a “feigned death”\n(tuosi) and moves to a region of Heaven called Palace of\nTaiyin, or Great Darkness, where his physical body is\nrefined. This process culminates in a “rebirth”, or\n“second birth” (fusheng), in a body that\npreserves itself indefinitely (Bokenkamp 1997: 46–48 and\n102). \nNo details are given on how this process actually occurs.\n“Refining the bodily form in Great Darkness”, however, is\nsimilar and for some aspects identical to what many later Daoist texts\ncall shijie, “release from the mortal body” or\n“from the corpse” (Robinet 1979: 57–66; Seidel 1987:\n230–32; Cedzich 2001; Campany 2002: 52–60; Pregadio 2004:\n121–26). After once again going through a “feigned\ndeath”, the adept departs, only to return to live in the world,\ntypically on a mountain but at times among other human beings, in a\nperfected body that subsists indefinitely. A rare description of a\nrelevant practice, found in a source originally dating from the late\n3rd century, suggests that “release from the\ncorpse” occurs in meditation. The adept is instructed to draw a\ntalisman and to visualize himself as “being dead”. Then he\ntakes off his clothes—an act symbolic of his forsaken\npersonality—and walks into the mountains, never to return where\nhe was born or lived (Cedzich 2001: 27–28; Campany 2002:\n54–55). Ritual elements are also involved. The adept stages his\ndeath, and his associates (family or Daoist companions) participate in\nthe performance: they state that his corpse has disappeared and has\nbeen replaced by other objects—typically a sword (signifying a\nhigher form of release), a staff (signifying a lower one), or a pair\nof sandals (on which see Kaltenmark 1953: 40 and 52). \nThe adept who performs “release from the mortal body” is\nalso said to change his name, so that he could escape the spirits\nbelonging to the bureaucracy of the underworld that manage the\n“registers of life and death”. For this reason, this\npractice has been called “deceptive”, in contrast to\ndirect ascension to Heaven, which would be a “nonillicit method\nof transcendence” (Campany 2002: 59). Yet, Daoist texts never\ndefine shijie as illicit, and state instead that this form of liberation is lower because of its temporary nature: those who\nundergo “release from the mortal body” have not yet\nattained a state sufficiently advanced to attain complete liberation\nin life, and need a further period of refinement that cannot occur in\nthe bodily form in which they presently dwell. Significantly, the\nChinese term for “changing name” (gaiming) is\nhomophonous of the term for “changing destiny”. \nShangqing (Highest Clarity) scriptures are the first ones to describe\nmeditation methods for the creation of an immortal body, or an\nimmortal self, through the generation of a new inner embryo. An\naccount of “refining the bodily form in Great Darkness”,\nfound in a Shangqing source, adds an important detail to what we have\nseen above, saying that the adept receives his second birth by going\nagain through his embryonic development (Robinet 1979: 63–66;\nStrickmann 1979: 182–83; Pregadio 2004: 124–25). Another\nexample is the practice of “untying the knots”\n(jiejie). In the Shangqing view, human gestation accounts for\nthe creation of “knots” and “nodes” that serve\nto support the five viscera, but are ultimately responsible for\none’s death. To untie them, the adept is instructed to create a\nnew embryo through a complex meditation practice (Robinet 1993:\n139–43; on the “change of destiny” involved in this\npractice see Bokenkamp 2005b, 160–62). \nShangqing texts also describe meditation practices performed in order\nto save one’s ancestors confined in the netherworld, who are\ntransformed into immortals by first returning to the embryonic state\n(Lagerwey 1981: 206–8; Robinet 1984: 1:170–73). Lingbao\nsources describe ritual practices performed for the same purpose\n(Bokenkamp 1989: 7–14). Several centuries later, these practices\nwould evolve in two main ways. The first is the method of Salvation\nthrough Refinement (liandu), in which a priest descends\ninto the hells to release the souls of the deceased and lead them to\nthe realm of Jade Clarity. Combining ritual and meditation, the entire\npractice takes place within the officiant: the celestial and infernal\nregions correspond to loci found within his own person, and the\ndeities involved in the practice are enabled to perform their salvific\nwork through his own body (Lagerwey 1987: 232–35; Boltz 1983).\nThe second development is Neidan, or Internal Alchemy, whose\npractice is often described as the conception, gestation, and delivery\nof an immortal embryo (see\n §10.3). \nIt is virtually impossible to distinguish the Daoist understanding of\nthe human body from its understanding of the human being as a whole,\nand this point constitutes on its own a central aspect of the Daoist\nway of seeing. Daoism is not interested in anatomy or physiology. The\nphysical body performs a different function: it supports various sets\nof metaphors that express the relation of the whole person to the\nultimate principle, the Dao. \nThe emphasis given to the symbolic aspects of the body is also the\nmain aspect under which Daoism differs from Chinese traditional\nmedicine: Daoism sees the body as an instrument for “returning\nto the Dao”. Catherine Despeux draws attention to this point by\nnoting that Daoists  \nhave considered the body in its practical ends, in its uses,\ndeveloping all kinds of body techniques that intend to liberate the\nindividual from the constraints of the physical body, and consequently\nto entrust a major role to the symbolic body. (translated from Despeux\n1996: 87–88) \nThe ordinary Western understanding of the body as physical frame or\nstructure cannot convey the complexity of the premodern Chinese view.\nThis view revolves around three main terms. The first, ti, or\n“body”, refers to the corporeal frame as an ordered whole\nmade of interdependent parts; it denotes the physical body made of\nskin, flesh, limbs, bones, muscles, tissues, vessels, and all other\nmaterial components. The second term, xing, or\n“form”, is best understood—at least in a Daoist\nperspective—in contrast to the idea of\n“formlessness” (wuxing), which pertains to the\nDao. In this sense, “form” refers to the embodiment as the\nfeature that identifies each entity in the “world of\nform”, distinguishing it from—and relating it to—all\nother entities. Therefore the “form”, rather than the\n“body”, is the principle of individuality at the physical\nlevel. The third term, shen, is the most comprehensive: it\ndenotes the human being in all of its physical and non-physical\naspects. Shen often is best translated as\n“person” and at times can also be rendered as\n“oneself”. For example, an expression such as\nxiushen means “cultivating one’s person” or\n“cultivating oneself”; it refers to cultivating not only\nthe body, but the entire person. (Explications of these terms, some of\nwhich differ from the understanding suggested here, are found in Kohn\n1991: 241–47; Sivin 1995: 14; Despeux 1996: 88–89;\nEngelhardt 2000: 95–96.) \nEach facet of the “body” mentioned above requires the\nother two, but the variety of concepts embraced by these terms raises\nthe question of which among them is at the center of the Daoist\ndiscourse. It could hardly be said that Daoism focuses on the physical\nbody: as shown below, several loci at the basis of Daoist\npractices—for instance, the three Cinnabar Fields\n(dantian)—do not even exist at the purely physical\nlevel. In other cases, the loci at the basis of Daoist practices have\ncorporeal counterparts, but their emblematic functions are more\nsignificant than those performed by the body parts themselves. The\nmain example is the five viscera (wuzang). In its discourse\non the viscera, Daoism shows little or no interest in the physical\norgans per se; the viscera serve, instead, as material\nsupports for the network of correspondences that tie the human being\nto its immediate and remote surroundings: society and cosmos. \nA merely anatomical view of the body, therefore, is the least of all\nconcerns in Daoism. Rather than ti (the physical body), the\nDaoist discourse and practices focus on xing (the\n“form”) and shen (the whole person). Maintaining\nthe physical body in good health is not an end in itself; it serves to\nensure that the body and its parts and organs may fulfill their\nemblematic functions. \nThese emblematic functions pertain to what Kristofer Schipper has\ncalled the “symbolic vision” of the body (1993: 104 ff)\nand Catherine Despeux has called the “symbolic body”\n(1996: 98). This view is centered on several key notions and\nrepresentations, which receive more or less emphasis according to the\nindividual cases. Five different models of the body can be\ndistinguished within Daoism as a whole: \nThese five representations are not competing models, and in fact often overlap\none another. For instance, the principles that operate in the cosmos\nand the inner deities that personify those principles are to a large\nextent equivalent: one may understand and represent those principles\nin abstract terms, in deified forms, or simultaneously in both ways.\nCertain aspects of the cosmological and the alchemical models are\nidentical. Similarly, illustrations of the body as a landscape also\ninclude the palaces that function as headquarters for the\nadministration of the body (Huang 2012: id.). \nIn addition to the different models outlined above, the Daoist view of\nthe body is grounded on several components and loci that are not\nphysical in the ordinary sense, or that perform functions going beyond\nthose of the corresponding physical organs. The three main\ncomponents—jing or “essence”, qi\nor “breath”, and shen or\n“spirit”—have been discussed above\n (§4.2).\n Only a few of the others will be mentioned here. \nThe center of the human being is represented in different ways; and\nnot being material, it may have different symbolic locations and\nnames. Most important among them is the Heart (xin, a word\nalso meaning “center”). Related images and terms include\nthe Yellow Court and the Mysterious-Female. The Yellow Court\n(huangting, where “yellow” is the color of the\ncentral agent Soil, and the “court” is the central\ncourtyard in traditional Chinese houses) has different\ndefinitions. When the framework of reference is the three Cinnabar\nFields, it may denote any of them, and especially the central one,\ncorresponding to the heart; when it is the five agents, it denotes the\nspleen, which is placed at the center of the five viscera and\ncorresponds to Soil. The Mysterious-Female (xuanpin, a term\nderived from the Daode jing and often translated as\n“mysterious female”) is the immaterial locus of the\nconjunction of Yin (the “female”) and Yang (the\n“mysterious”). \nThe three Cinnabar Fields (dantian) are the lower Cinnabar\nField (the dantian proper), which is found in the region of\nthe abdomen and is the seat of the Essence (jing); the middle\nCinnabar Field, which is found in the region of the heart and is the\nseat of Breath (qi); and the upper Cinnabar Field, which is\nfound in the region of the brain and is the seat of Spirit\n(shen). In meditation practices, the three Fields are the\nresidences of the Three Ones (Sanyi), who represent the One and its\nsubdivision into the Two. In Neidan (Internal Alchemy, on which see\n §10.3),\n they are the loci of the conception, nourishment, and delivery of the\nalchemical embryo. \nImportant symbolic functions are performed by the five viscera\n(wuzang), namely the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and\nkidneys. They are related, in this order, to the agents Wood, Fire,\nSoil, Metal, and Water. This makes the viscera the main support for\nthe macrocosm-microcosm doctrine in Daoism. The three Cinnabar Fields\nand the five viscera respectively reproduce the vertical and\nhorizontal dimensions of the cosmos within the human being. \nMany Daoist texts also refer to the hun and the po,\ntwo untranslatable terms often rendered as “spiritual and\nmaterial souls”, “celestial and\nearthly souls”, or in similar ways. The hun stands for\nthe Yang and lighter components of the human\nbeing that pertain to Heaven and return there after death. The\npo stands for the Yin and grosser\ncomponents that pertain to the Earth and return there when death\noccurs. According to different views, the hun and the\npo may be single or multiple; in the latter case, the\nhun are three, and the po are seven. \nFinally, the human body also hosts two sets of parasites: the\n“three corpses” (sanshi), which reside in the\nhead, the chest, and the legs; and the “nine worms”\n(jiuchong), which live in different parts of the body. All of\nthem cause weakening, diseases, and death. The “three\ncorpses” are also said to report periodically one’s\ntransgressions to Heaven, which results in the shortening of\none’s life span. As these parasites feed on cereals,\n“abstaining from grains” (bigu) was one of the\nways to expel them. \nDaoist self-cultivation teachings and practices can be subdivided into\nthree main groups: \nWhile Confucianism saw the cultivation of ethical and moral principles\nas the highest pursuit in a person’s life, Daoism deems those\nprinciples to be the foundation of one’s self-cultivation. In\nthe Daoist perspective, ethics and morals therefore are not a branch\nof “philosophical thought”, but also pertain to the basic\nfield of Nourishing Life. (On Daoist precepts see Schipper 2001, and\nthe translation of a representative text in Hendrischke and Penny\n1996.) \nThis and the next sections are concerned with the three main groups of\nteachings and practices mentioned above. \nYangsheng or Nourishing Life is the general designation of a\nvariety of practices designed to benefit the body (Engelhardt 2000).\nThe term is so indefinite that no precise list can be drawn of what\npertains to “nourishing life”. Nevertheless, relevant\nmethods would certainly include daoyin, breathing, and sexual\npractices. Present-day practices often defined as\n“Daoist”, such as Qigong and Taiji quan,\nmay also be seen as belonging to Yangsheng. \nDaoyin (lit., “guiding and pulling”; Despeux\n1989; Kohn 2008) can be defined, in Western terms, as a sort of\ngymnastics, in the sense that it grants physical agility and\ncoordination. In a different reference frame, its formal features and\nits place in Daoism bear analogies to what hatha yoga is in Hinduism.\nThe purpose of daoyin postures and movements is to allow the\nunhindered flow of qi within the body. The practice is known\nto have existed at least by the 3rd or 2nd\ncentury BCE (trans. of a Mawangdui manuscript, Harper 1998:\n310–27). Only one text on daoyin is found in the Daoist\nCanon (trans. Kohn 2012, in a chapter oddly entitled “Internal\nAlchemy”). \nBreathing practices exist in many varieties. The most common general\nterms are xingqi (“circulating breath”) and\ntuna (“exhaling [the old] and inhaling [the new\nbreath]”). Particular practices include biqi\n(“retaining breath”), buqi (“spreading\nbreath”), lianqi (“refining breath”), and\ntiaoqi (“harmonizing breath”). Another celebrated\nterm is zhongxi (“breathing through the heels”),\nused in the Zhuangzi to designate the spontaneous breathing of\nthe realized person, which does not stop at the lungs but circulates\nthroughout the entire body (ch. 6; Watson 1968: 78). Two especially\nimportant practices are the ingestion of the “breaths” of\nthe four directions (Raz 2013), and the so-called “embryonic\nbreathing” (taixi), which purports to replicate the\nbreathing of an embryo in its womb (Maspero 1981: 459–505). \nSexual practices are commonly defined in Chinese as fangzhong\nshu or “arts of the bedroom” (Maspero 1981:\n517–41). The large amount of literature existing on this subject\nshows that these arts are, with few exceptions, primarily addressed to\nmales (another common term that defines them is yunü,\n“riding women”). Their main purpose is to avoid\nejaculation: semen should be prevented from being emitted and should\ninstead be “returned to the brain” (which is deemed to be\nthe origin of the marrow, in its turn the source of semen). This\nmethod is known as huangjing bunao, “reverting the\nessence to replenish the brain”. \nWhile in Chinese popular culture and in the Western re-invention of\nDaoism the “arts of the bedroom” are often seen as Daoist,\nsexual practices performed in the history of Daoism are of a different\nkind. They include the heqi (“joining breaths” or\n“pneumas”) ritual, practiced in the early Tianshi\ndao (Way of the Celestial Masters) between married couples in\norder to generate the “seed people” (zhongmin),\nwho would survive the impending end of world (Raz 2012: 186–202;\nKleeman 2014; Mollier 2016). Certain traditions of Neidan (Internal\nAlchemy) also involve sexual conjunction, performed in order to enable\nthe male practitioner to collect the True Yang from the\nYin (represented in this case by the sexual essences produced\nby the female). In Neidan, these practice are contrasted with\nqingxiu, literally meaning “pure\ncultivation”. \nSeveral Daoist texts emphasize that the Yangsheng methods should not be\nperformed as the only way for “returning to the Dao”.\nOthers—beginning with the Zhuangzi (ch. 15; Watson\n1968: 167–68)—express criticism towards them. While some\nscholars have looked at these contrasts as examples of competition\ntaking place in a sort of “self-cultivation market”,\nDaoist authors take into account the state of realization afforded by the Yangsheng methods, which in their view is lower compared to other practices. \nDaoist meditation practices can be divided into four main types: (1)\nVisualization of inner gods; (2) Meditation on Unity, or the One; (3)\n“Excursions” to astral bodies and constellations, or to\nthe remotest poles of the cosmos; (4) Inner contemplation. \nAccording to Daoist traditions documented from around 200 CE, the\nhuman being hosts a veritable pantheon of gods. These deities perform\nmultiple roles related to one another: they allow the human being to\ncommunicate with the corresponding gods of the celestial pantheon,\nserve as administrators of the human body, and guard the balance of\nthe body’s main functions. \nSeveral texts describe the features of the inner gods. One of the main\nsources, the Huangting jing (Book of the Yellow Court; ca.\n200 CE; Robinet 1993: 55–96; Despeux 2012: 128–49),\nmentions, for instance, a major series of gods that live within the\nfive viscera. Significantly, each of these organs is called a\n“department” (bu), the same term that denotes a\ngovernment “ministry”, and each of these gods is said to\nreside in a “palace”. These and other details, such as\nnames, appearances, dimensions, and garments of the gods, are\nmentioned as supports for meditation practices. In agreement with the\nclassical Chinese views on the fateful separation of the spirit\n(shen) from the body, several works warn that if the inner\ngods (also called shen) leave their residences, a person dies.\n“Maintaining one’s thoughts” (cun) on them\nenables one to keep them in their corporeal dwellings. \nThese deities are not deemed to possess physical existence in the\nordinary sense of the word. They pertain, instead, to a domain that\nlies midway between formlessness and form; as noticed by Isabelle\nRobinet, they are “images” (xiang) that play an\nintermediary function “between the world of sensory realities\nand the world of the unknowable” (1993: 50). The person in whom\nthe gods reside is neither possessed by them nor is\n“deified” by their presence (for a different view, see\nPuett 2002:\n226–27). The practitioner, instead, becomes the focus of a\ndivine representation, of which he is the lone creator and the lone\nspectator. The organs and loci in which the gods reside cease to be\nmere “body parts”, and become the supports that make that\nrepresentation possible. \nThe inner gods are literally innumerable and different texts describe\ndifferent pantheons (Pregadio 2005: 131–41), but here only the\nmost important one can be mentioned. Known as the Red Child (Chizi),\nhe is featured in the Laozi zhongjing (Central Book of Laozi;\nprobably ca. 200 CE; Schipper 1993: 100–12; Schipper 1995;\nLagerwey 2004a). The speaker of this text is Laozi; in fact, the Red\nChild is no other than Laozi himself, now playing the role of\n“true self” (zhenwu) of each human being. He\ndefines himself as “the child of the Dao”, adding that he\nresides in the stomach (another symbolic center of the person) where\nhe is nourished by his mother and protected by his father. Like other\ninner gods, however, the Child should also be nourished by the person\nin whom he lives: in particular, a “yellow essence”\n(huangjing) and a “red breath” (chiqi),\nrespectively associated with the Moon (Yin) and the Sun\n(Yang), should be delivered to him by the adept in\nmeditation. \nAs an image of the “true self”, the Red Child is the main\nprecursor of the “embryo” that, several centuries later,\nadepts of Neidan would generate and nourish by means of their own\npractices\n (§10.3). \nMeditation practices focused on the principle of Unity are known as\n“guarding Unity” or “guarding the One”\n(shouyi), an expression analogous in meaning to\n“embracing Unity” (baoyi) found in the Daode\njing (sec. 10 and 22). In his famous speech to the Yellow\nEmperor, recorded in the Zhuangzi, Guangcheng zi says,\n“I guard this Unity and thus abide in this harmony” (ch.\n11; Watson 1968: 120). \nWhile in these examples “guarding Unity” refers to the\nconstant awareness of the One as the principle of the many, in later times the\nsame expression designates meditation practices based on the\nvisualization of the One as an anthropomorphic inner deity. A\nclassical description is found in the Baopu zi, where Ge Hong\nreckons “guarding the One” as the superior way of\ntranscendence together with the ingestion of elixirs. The main\npractice consists in visualizing the features that the One as a god\ntakes within the human being as it moves among the three Cinnabar\nFields. Meditation on the One as an inner god is also described in the\nLaozi zhongjing and in the Dadong zhenjing. Later,\nthis practice evolved into “guarding the Three Ones”\n(shou sanyi), which again exists in several varieties\n(Andersen 1979; Robinet 1993: 119–38). For instance, the Three\nOnes are represented as three children who live in the\nCinnabar Fields. Another practice combines external and\ninternal aspects: after visualizing the descent of the\nNorthern Dipper above his head, the adept sees the Three Ones emerging\namong its stars; he breaths three times, and each time one of the\nThree Ones reaches its residence in the respective Cinnabar Field. \nShangqing Daoism also developed meditation practices that take adepts\nto the extremities of the cosmos or to the Sun, the Moon, and other\nastral bodies (Robinet 1993: 171–85 and 187–230). For some\nof their features, these practices are related to the\n“far roaming” described in pre-Han and Han literary works\n(see\n §2.2).\n The Dipper, in particular, is the heavenly residence of the Great One\n(Taiyi); it is made of nine stars, two of which are said to be visible\nonly by advanced adepts. One of the nine stars, called Heavenly Pass\n(tianguan), allows the adept to exit the cosmos and access\nthe domains placed above and beyond it. The meditative walk on the\nstars was called Pacing the Celestial Net (bugang). It\nincorporated the ancient ritual practice of the Steps of Yu\n(yubu), which imitated the lamely way of walking of the\nmythical Emperor Yu, but also included cosmological and numerological\nelements (Andersen 1989–90). \nFrom approximately the 7th century, the meditation\npractices outlined above were largely replaced by methods of\ncontemplation and introspection (Kohn 2010). While their closeness to\nBuddhism is manifest, their roots also lie in early teachings and\npractices such as those described in the Neiye (Internal\nTraining), dating from the second half of the 4th\ncentury BCE (Kirkland 2004: 39–52; Roth 1999; Graziani 2001),\nand in the above-mentioned speech of Guangcheng\nzi to the Yellow Emperor (Zhuangzi, ch. 11; Watson 1968:\n118–20). \nOne of the main sources on contemplation (guan) methods is\nthe Neiguan jing (Book of Inner Contemplation; Kohn 2010:\n179–87), another text spoken by Laozi in his deified aspect.\nThis work emphasizes that the original state of clarity and purity is\nlost when the mind is overcome by passions and attachments caused by\nsensual cravings. When the mind is stabilized, disordered thoughts do\nnot arise; one then does not only reach the state of quiescence, but\nthe state in which both movement and quiescence are transcended. \nThe Qingjing jing (Book of Clarity and Quiescence; Kohn 1993:\n24–29) is another influential work, also dating from the Tang\nperiod and also spoken by Laozi. It states that the innate clarity and\nquiescence of the mind and the spirit are defiled by passion and lust\nowed to the separation of original Unity into the two complementary\nprinciples. Only by realizing that mind, forms, and individual objects\nare devoid of an underlying nature is it possible to awaken to their\nfundamental emptiness. This is attained by contemplation, and leads\none to the recovery of the “clarity and quiescence”\nmentioned in the title (an expression derived from the Daode\njing, sec. 45). Among the main uses of this work was, and still\nis, its daily recitation by Quanzhen monks, nuns, and adepts. \nAlchemy developed in China in two main branches. Waidan, or External\nAlchemy, is based on compounding elixirs through the manipulation of\nnatural substances—primarily minerals and metals—which\nrelease their essences when they are submitted to the action of fire.\nNeidan, or Internal Alchemy, aims to produce the elixir within the\nalchemist’s person according to two main models of doctrine and\npractice: first, by\ncausing the primary components of the cosmos and the human\nbeing—Essence, Breath, and Spirit—to revert to their\noriginal states; and second, by purifying one’s mind of defilements and\npassions, in order to “see one’s Nature”\n(jianxing), which is equated to the elixir. \nIn the Taiqing (Great Clarity) tradition of Waidan, which\ndeveloped from the 3rd century CE, the alchemical practice\nis framed as a complex ritual sequence (Pregadio 2006). The initial\nstage is the ceremony of transmission, followed by a period of\nretirement and purifications. Then, having protected the ritual space\nby means of talismans (fu), the alchemist builds the\nlaboratory, or “chamber of the elixirs” (danshi).\nAt a time deemed to be suitable according to traditional hemerology,\nthe alchemist performs a ceremony for kindling the\nfire—including a request of assistance addressed to Laojun (Lord\nLao) and other deities—and only then does he devote himself to\nthe compounding. The process is concluded by the consecration and the\ningestion of the elixir. It is this entire sequence, and not only the\nwork at the furnace, that constitutes the alchemical practice. \nThe main tool, from both a ritual and a technical point of view, is\nthe crucible. To reproduce the state of the cosmos at its inception\n(hundun; see §4.3), the vessel\nshould be hermetically sealed so that the vital “breath”\n(qi) is not dispersed. Under these conditions, the elixir\ningredients “revert” (huan) to their original\nstate. This refined matter is equated with the Essence (jing)\nthat is hidden within the Dao and gives birth to the world\n(“Vague and indistinct! Within it there is something. Dim and\nobscure! Within it there is an essence”; Daode jing,\nsec. 21). The elixir therefore is a tangible sign of the seed that\ngenerates the cosmos. \nIngesting an elixir is said to confer, in the first place,\ntranscendence, immortality, and admission into the ranks of the\ncelestial bureaucracy. One also gains the ability of summoning\nbenevolent gods and obtains protection from demons, spirits, and\nseveral other disturbances, including weapons, wild animals, and even\nthieves. Remarkably, in order to provide these benefits, the elixir\ndoes not need to be ingested: it may simply be kept in one’s\nhand or carried at the belt as a powerful apotropaic talisman. \nEarly Waidan sources do not rely on the system of correlative\ncosmology. This system, instead, becomes essential in the\nlater Waidan traditions and in virtually the whole of Neidan. The\nfoundations of this new model of doctrine and practice were provided\nby the Cantong qi (Seal of the Unity of the Three),\ntraditionally said to be written in the 2nd century CE but\ndating from between the mid-5th and the mid-7th\ncentury (Pregadio 2011). Scores of texts both within and outside the\nDaoist Canon are related to this work. Although its views have been\nunderstood mainly in relation to Neidan, they also apply to\nWaidan. \nThe Cantong qi and its tradition use several sets of emblems\nthat represent different aspects of the relation of the cosmos to the\nDao. The main set is formed by four trigrams of the Book of\nChanges, namely Qian ☰, Kun ☷,\nKan ☵, and Li ☲, which represent the\nmodes taken on by the Dao in its self-manifestation. Qian\nstands for the active (Yang) aspect of the Dao, and Kun stands\nfor its passive (Yin) aspect. Their permanent conjunction in\nthe precosmic domain gives birth to the cosmos. The Yang of\nQian ☰ moves into Kun ☷, which becomes\nKan ☵; in response, the Yin of Kun\n☷ moves into Qian ☰, which becomes Li\n☲. In the cosmos, therefore, the Yin contains True\nYang (the inner solid line of Kan ☵), and the\nYang contains True Yin (the inner broken line of\nLi ☲). \nOn the basis of these principles, the only form of alchemical practice\nsanctioned by the Cantong qi and by the works that follow its\nsystem is the one that enables the conjunction of Qian and\nKun, or True Yang and True Yin. According\nto the Cantong qi, only True Lead and True Mercury are\n“of the same kind” (tonglei) as Qian and\nKun. The Yin and Yang entities that\ncontain these authentic principles are “black\nlead” (i.e., native lead) and cinnabar, respectively. In the strict sense of\nthe term, alchemy therefore consists in extracting True Lead from\n“black lead” and True Mercury from cinnabar, and in\njoining them to one another. This is accomplished in Waidan by using\nthe corresponding minerals and metals, and in Neidan by operating on\nvarious components of the human body—both physical and\nnon-physical—which are symbolically denoted by the same\nterms. \nAlthough the Cantong qi forever changed the history of Daoist\nalchemy, by no means are all Waidan works written in the Tang period\n(7th-9th centuries) inspired by its doctrines\n(Sivin 1968; Needham 1976: 132–74). During this period, however,\nWaidan methods increasingly tend to mirror features of the\ncosmological system (Sivin 1976 and 1980). \nThe shift of focus from ritual to cosmology also paved the way for the\ndevelopment of Neidan. However, the roots of Neidan are multiple, and\nit would be reductive to see it as a mere transposition of Waidan to\nan “inner” plane: Neidan owes its origins to meditation\nmethods on the inner gods more than it does to Waidan (Pregadio 2005).\nTo summarize a complex phenomenon, Waidan terminology and imagery were\ncombined with concepts and emblems drawn from the cosmological system\naccording to the model of the Cantong qi, and with elements\ninherited from the early meditation practices. This necessarily caused\nthe disappearance of the inner gods themselves: incorporating them\ninto Neidan would require an impossible “re-mapping” of\nthe inner pantheon onto a different cosmological model. The only, but\nmajor, exception is the Red Child, the innermost deity of early Daoist\nmeditation (see\n §9.1).\n When he reappears in Neidan, however, the Red Child is no longer a\ngod possessed by all human beings: he is now an image of the\n“embryo” generated by means of the alchemical\npractice. \nEspecially in its forms that integrate elements defined (or\nre-defined) by Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism, Neidan focuses its\ndiscourse and practice on xing and ming, two\ncardinal concepts in its view of the human being (Robinet 1995:\n165–95; Pregadio 2014). Xing denotes the “inner\nnature”, which is related to Spirit (shen) and pertains\nto one’s “heart” or “mind”\n(xin). Neidan texts often discourse on xing by using\nBuddhist terms and expressions, such as “seeing one’s\nnature” (jianxing), and even use the term “Buddha-nature” (foxing). Ming, an even more complex\nterm, is related to Breath (qi) and pertains to the\n“body” (shen). The term means in the first place\nthe “command” or “mandate” conferred by\nHeaven, but its senses also include “life”,\n“existence”, “lifespan”, as well as\n“destiny”. While one’s xing is unborn and\nis therefore free from death, everything in the domain of\nming has a beginning and an end. \nAs far as we know, Neidan developed from the early 8th\ncentury onwards. Two of its main branches, which emerged between the\n12th and the 13th centuries, are traditionally\nascribed with the creation of models of self-cultivation based on the\nconcepts summarized above (Yokote 2015). The first model, associated\nwith the Nanzong (Southern Lineage), gives initial priority\nto the cultivation of one’s ming (existence), gradually\nshifting to the cultivation of xing (inner nature) as the\npractice progresses. The second model, associated with the\nBeizong (Northern Lineage), emphasizes instead the\ncultivation of one’s xing by means of “clarity\nand quiescence” (qingjing); this is also said to\ninvolve the cultivation of one’s ming. Despite the\ndifferences between these two models, Neidan as a whole insists that\nboth xing and ming should be cultivated, a view\nreflected in the term “conjoined cultivation of nature and\nexistence” (xingming shuangxiu). \nIn its most widespread codification, which originates in the Southern\nLineage, the Neidan practice consists of three main stages (Despeux\n1979: 55–82; Robinet 1995: 147–64; Wang Mu 2011). Its\npurpose is to lead an adept from the postcelestial to the precelestial\ndomains through the gradual reintegration of each of the three main\ncomponents of the human being—Essence, Breath, and\nSpirit—into the one that precedes it, culminating in the\nreversion to the state of Non-Being (wu), or Emptiness\n(xu, kong). While this is the function of alchemy\nper se, certain authors indicate that the process of\nascent to the precelestial domain should be followed by\na new descent or return to the postcelestial domain, in\norder to merge them with one another. \nThe practice outlined above is often described as the generation of\n“a person outside one’s person” (or “a self\noutside oneself”, shen zhi wai shen), defined as the\n“true person” (zhenshen; compare\n §6.3).\n In this case, the main stages of the practice are portrayed as the\nconception, gestation, and birth of an embryo, which personifies the\npractitioner’s realized state (Despeux 2016). In another view,\nthe Internal Elixir is seen as already possessed by every human being\nand as identical to one’s own innate realized state. Liu Yiming\n(1734–1821) expresses this view by saying: “All human\nbeings have this Golden Elixir complete in themselves: it is entirely\nrealized in everybody”. Other authors of Neidan texts state in\ntheir works that “the Golden Elixir is in front of your\neyes”.","contact.mail":"fabrizio.pregadio@fau.de","contact.domain":"fau.de"}]
