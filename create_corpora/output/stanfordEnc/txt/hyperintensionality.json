If the concept is expressed by an\noperator, \\(H\\), then \\(H\\) is hyperintensional insofar as \\(HA\\) and\n\\(HB\\) can differ in truth value in spite of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)’s\nbeing necessarily equivalent. Necessary equivalence of claims is\nstandardly understood in terms of possible worlds (ways things could\nhave been): \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are necessarily equivalent when they are\ntrue at the same worlds. This is sometimes put in terms of sentences\nsharing an intension. An extensional operator (e.g.,\nBoolean negation) allows substitution salva veritate of\nsentences with the same extension, that is, truth value: if \\(A\\) has\nthe same truth value as \\(B\\), then also \\({\\sim}A\\) has the same\ntruth value as \\({\\sim}B\\). An intensional operator (e.g.,\nthe box of necessity) allows substitution salva veritate of\nsentences that express necessary equivalents: if \\(A\\) is necessarily\nequivalent to \\(B\\), then \\(\\Box A\\) has the same truth value as\n\\(\\Box B\\). The expression “hyperintensional” is thus for\nan \\(H\\) that defies substitution salva veritate even of\nexpressions with the same intension.\n\n\nCresswell (1975) introduced the expression\n“hyperintensional” to pick out a position in a sentence\nwhere substitution fails for logical equivalents. Nowadays the term is\nused more broadly, with unrestrictedly necessary equivalence replacing\nlogical equivalence. Candidates for unrestricted necessity often\ninclude, besides the logical, mathematical and metaphysical necessity.\nWe don’t discuss whether one of these is reducible to the\nothers—e.g., the mathematical to the logical, as claimed by\nlogicists.\n\n\nHyperintensionality is pervasive. Take two claims on your prospects of\ngetting a job you may apply for:\n\n(1)\nYou have 40% chances of succeeding.\n(2)\nYou have 60% chances of failing.\n\nThese are necessarily equivalent. However, psychological studies on\nframing effects (Tversky & Kahneman 1981; Kahneman 2011) show that\npeople are more prone to believe in a positive outcome when presented\nwith (1) than with (2), thus more likely to apply. Belief\nseems sensitive to hyperintensional distinctions: we can come to\nbelieve different things depending on how necessarily equivalent\noptions are presented to us (Berto 2019). Framing has vast societal\nimpacts (Thaler & Sunstein 2008).\n\n\nOn to your neighbor Mike:\n\n(3)\nMike is Mike.\n(4)\nMike is Jack the Ripper.\n\n(3) is necessarily true. Suppose (4) is true. If “Jack the\nRipper” works as a proper name, (4) is necessarily true, too\n(Barcan Marcus 1947; Kripke 1980). Thus, (3) and (4) are necessarily\nequivalent. But (3) is uninformative (you already knew things are\nself-identical), whereas learning (4) could save your life.\nInformation, this fundamental concept of our age, also seems\nto display hyperintensional features. The difference between (3) and\n(4) is marked by saying that you can know (3), not (4), a\npriori. The concept of a priori, then, has\nhyperintensional features too.\n\n\nQuine and Davidson’s idea that serious philosophy should use\nonly extensional notions faded in the latter half of the twentieth\ncentury, which witnessed an intensional revolution: a collective\neffort to analyze notions which are fundamental for our understanding\nof the world and of ourselves, like belief, information,\nknowledge, meaning, content, essence, explanation, via a single\ntheoretical system: employing possible worlds and constructions out of\nthem. Standard possible worlds semantics (SPWS) found applications in\nlogic, linguistics, game theory, artificial intelligence: a success\nstory of philosophy. However, many of these phenomena (and, more: a\nsurvey in\n Section 1)\n are, arguably, hyperintensional, requiring hyperintensional language\nto do them justice. And SPWS tends to collapse any distinctions more\nfine-grained than necessary equivalence. The issue of how best to\naddress hyperintensionality has emerged in piecemeal fashion, via a\nseries of difficulties of SPWS (in\n Section 1,\n we list a few). Some have denied that hyperintensionality marks a set\nof real phenomena and have tried to explain away hyperintensional\nintuitions. Some of these general attempts are discussed in\n Section 2.\n \n\nEven if genuinely hyperintensional language is accepted into our\nphilosophical theorizing, this leaves many further issues open. One\npressing one is the question of “just ‘how hyper’\nhyperintensions are” (Jespersen & Duží 2015:\n527): what new distinctions should our theorizing recognize beyond\nnecessary equivalence? The mathematical structure of the realm of\nhyperintensionality is not well understood yet. We come to this in\n Section 3.\n However, the early twenty-first century is seeing a hyperintensional\nrevolution (Nolan 2014), with different general approaches currently\nbeing developed, which qualify as hyperintensional in some sense. We\nprovide a critical survey in\n Section 4,\n where we also assess the approaches in terms of how they fare with\nrespect to hyperintensional phenomena singled out in previous\nSections.\n\nWe provide a taxonomy of candidate hyperintensional notions by\ndividing them into two camps: (1) representational concepts\npertain to ways of representing the world (1a) in thought and (1b) in\nlanguage. In the former sub-camp (1a), we find mental states or\nactivities like believing, knowing, imagining, conceiving,\nbeing or becoming informed. In the latter sub-camp\n(1b), notions such as meaning, content, and\nconditionality. (2) Non-representational\nhyperintensional concepts include allegedly mind-independent,\n“worldly” notions such as essence, grounding,\nmetaphysical dependence, explanation. \n(The division is not uncontroversial, e.g., some claim that\nexplanation and indicative conditionals essentially involve cognition\n(Lycan 2001), so they would place them in (1a). Some claim that there\nexists “environmental” information (Barwise & Seligman\n1997) that should go into (2). We stick to what we take to be\nmainstream views on where such concepts should go.) \nFor each of these notions, we provide (a) a brief explanation of how\nthey have been dealt with in SPWS; and (b) examples illustrating their\nseemingly hyperintensional nature. These, if found persuasive, may\nwork as data against which the theories described in\n Section 4\n can be evaluated with respect to their hyperintensional aims. \nPerhaps the most plausible hyperintensional environment is the realm\nof intentional concepts: notions that involve states of the\nmind which are directed towards contents, situations, etc. The two\nmost studied such notions are knowledge and belief. Since Hintikka\n(1962), these have been understood in epistemic logic as modal\noperators: restricted quantifiers over possible worlds. Knowledge and\nbelief are characterized in terms of what is true throughout a set of\nworlds which represent ways things could be, for all the cognitive\nagent knows, or given the agent’s evidence, etc. If \\(K\\)\nexpresses the agent’s knowledge or belief state, \\(w\\) is a\npossible world, and \\(R\\) an epistemic accessibility relation on the\nspace of worlds \\(W\\), the Hintikkan characterization goes: \nSome views in mainstream epistemology follow the same path, e.g., in\nrelevant alternatives approaches knowledge is “an\nevidential state in which all relevant alternatives (to what is known)\nare eliminated” (Dretske 1981: 367). Uneliminated alternatives\nwork similarly to accessible worlds. \nSuch treatments of knowledge and belief witnessed an early\nmanifestation of the hyperintensionality issue: the problem of\nlogical omniscience (Fagin et al. 1995: 335–6)—a set\nof closure conditions for the relevant \\(K\\)s, of which perhaps the\nmost important are: \n(C1), often dubbed Closure under entailment or Full\nomniscience, has it that one knows or believes all the logical\nconsequences of what one knows or believes. (C2), Knowledge of all\nvalidities or Belief in all validities, has it that one\nknows or believes all logical truths. (C3) ensures the consistency of\nknowledge or belief. All follow from understanding \\(K\\) as a\nquantifier over worlds, as per (H). (C1): if \\(A\\)’s entailing\n\\(B\\) is understood in terms of all \\(A\\)-worlds’ being\n\\(B\\)-worlds (in all the relevant models), and given that \\(KA\\) means\nthat \\(A\\) is true at all the epistemically accessible worlds, \\(B\\)\nwill be true there, too, and so \\(KB\\) will hold. (C2): if\n\\(A\\)’s being logically valid is understood as its holding at\nall worlds (of all the relevant models), then it will hold at all the\nepistemically accessible ones, and so \\(KA\\) will hold. (C3): no\npossible world, thus no accessible one, will make both \\(A\\) and\n\\({\\sim}A\\) true. \nThese don’t sound right for real humans, as opposed to\nidealized, logically infallible agents. (C1): we know basic arithmetic\ntruths like Peano’s postulates, and these entail (suppose)\nGoldbach’s Conjecture (Every even whole number larger than 2 is\nthe sum of two primes); but we don’t know whether\nGoldbach’s Conjecture is true. (C2): “If\n\\({\\sim}{\\sim}A\\), then \\(A\\)” is (suppose) valid, but\nintuitionist logicians do not believe it. (C3): we can have, if\nimplicitly, inconsistent beliefs. \nOne may treat “\\(KA\\)” in (H) as not really standing for\nknowledge or belief. We should read it as “\\(A\\) follows\nlogically from the agent’s knowledge”, or “The agent\nis committed to \\(A\\), given what it knows/believes”. Then we\nstill lack some logical account of knowledge and\nbelief per se, as opposed to some derivative attitude or\nconditional commitment. The commitment itself may be questioned: are\nwe committed to believing everything, given that we have inconsistent\nbeliefs? In what sense must a finite agent believe infinitely many\nlogical consequences? Such a “must” lacks a corresponding\n“can”. \nInformation received a modal treatment in the classic\nBar-Hillel and Carnap (1952) account. The informative task of a\nsentence \\(A\\) is to split the totality of worlds into those where\n\\(A\\) is true and those where it isn’t. An agent’s\nbecoming informed of \\(A\\) is its ruling out the not\\(-A\\) worlds as\ncontenders for actuality: before being informed that it’s\nraining outside, for all you knew, it might have been raining or not.\nAfter you are informed, you can rule out all the non-rainy worlds. \nBut now, “If Kennedy was shot, then Kennedy was shot” and\n“\\(x^n + y^n = z^n\\) has no integer solutions for \\(n \\gt\n2\\)” are necessarily equivalent, given the unrestricted\nnecessity of logical and mathematical truths, and SPWS. They are true\nat the same worlds: all of them. On the Bar-Hillel-Carnap view, one\ncan rule out no world after learning either. But while one easily\ndeems the former true, the latter, which expresses Fermat’s Last\nTheorem, took centuries to be proved and its proof brought significant\nnews. \nGeneralizing: a merely intensional analysis of information entails\nthat no logical, mathematical, or metaphysical necessary\ntruth can ever be informative and denies the informativeness of\nlogical deduction. But logical deductions are informative (Jago 2009,\n2014). Besides, we can become informed of exactly one of two\nnecessarily equivalent claims. Of necessity, “All woodchucks are\nwoodchucks” is true if and only if “All woodchucks are\nwhistle-pigs” is (Ripley 2012). But the former is trivial,\nwhereas one may learn the latter from a zoologist. \nOther attitudes like hoping, fearing, supposing, imagining\ndisplay hyperintensional features (Wansing 2017). One may be led to\nthe general conclusion that thought is hyperintensional: our\nintentional states can treat necessarily equivalent contents\ndifferently. Lois Lane can wish that Superman is in love with her\nwithout wishing that Clark Kent is in love with her, although (if\nBarcan Marcus and Kripke are right) it is impossible for Superman to\nbe other than Clark Kent. We can suppose that \\(75 \\times 12 = 900\\)\nwithout supposing Fermat’s Last Theorem. Even intentional states\ninvolving perceptual experiences, like seeing, seem\nhyperintensional: you can see that Mary is eating an ice cream without seeing\nthat Mary is eating an ice cream and John is either eating chips or\nnot (you may not be seeing John at all). But \\(A\\) is logically\nequivalent to \\(A \\land (B \\lor {\\sim}B)\\) in classical logic and even\nin many weaker logics (Barwise & Perry 1983). \nPropositions, taken as the contents or meanings of sentences, have\noften been interpreted starting from Wittgenstein’s insight that\nunderstanding a sentence is knowing what is the case if it is true\n(Wittgenstein 1921: 4.024). Truth conditions have been given via sets\nof possible worlds in the SPWS approaches of Montague (1970),\nStalnaker (1976) and many others: the proposition expressed by\n“St Andrews is rainy” is the set of worlds where St\nAndrews is rainy. \nThis makes all necessarily equivalent propositions identical, for\npossible worlds can never disagree on them. “If Kennedy was\nshot, then Kennedy was shot” and “\\(x^n + y^n = z^n\\) has\nno integer solutions for \\(n \\gt 2\\)” mean the same thing: the\ntotal set of worlds. This seems wrong, given that they don’t say\nthe same thing: only one speaks about Diophantine equations. Similarly\nfor necessary falsehoods: “Kennedy was both shot and not”\nand “\\(2 + 3 = 6\\)” are about different things, but they\nalso end up expressing the same proposition: the empty set. \nWe can locate in the area of semantic concepts hyperintensional\nphenomena which have to do with conditionality. We start with\nindicative conditionals. The extensional material conditional,\n“\\(\\supset\\)”, validates notoriously paradoxical\ninferences: \nIf the horseshoe captures the meaning of the indicative\n“if”, lots of bad-sounding conditionals from ordinary\nlanguage come out true just because the antecedent is false or the\nconsequent true: “If Clinton is Australian, then Mars is made of\nmarbles”; “If Strasbourg is in Germany, then Clinton is\nAmerican”. \nOne may think the issue is that the connection between antecedent and\nconsequent is too contingent an affair here. One may require, for\n“If \\(A\\), then \\(B\\)” to be true, that it cannot be the\ncase that the antecedent is true while the consequent is false. This\ngives the so-called strict conditional: a modal operator,\n“\\(\\prec\\)”, such that “\\(A \\prec B\\)” is\nunderstood as “At any possible world where \\(A\\) is true, \\(B\\)\nis true”. \nThis has its paradoxes, too. Where “\\(\\Box A\\)” means that\n\\(A\\) is true at all possible worlds, and “\\(\\Diamond A\\)”\nmeans that \\(A\\) is true at some, we get: \nWhen \\(A\\) is true at no possible world, or \\(B\\) is true at all,\nthere is no way for \\(A\\) to be true while \\(B\\) is false and so\n“\\(A \\prec B\\)” is true. If the strict conditional\ncaptures the meaning of the indicative “if”, lots of bad\nconditionals come out true: “If \\(6 + 3 = 11\\), then Clinton is\nAustralian”; “If Clinton is American, then \\(6 + 3 =\n9\\)”. These are not obviously true, and there are some reasons\nto suppose they are false: there is no connection between antecedent\nand consequent, for example. Other conditional forms that the strict\nconditional validates but which are disputable include: \nAs an instance of (6), take “If Mars is made of marbles, then\neither St Andrews is in Scotland, or it isn’t”: the\nmaterial constitution of Mars has little to do with St Andrews’\nlocation. Some theorists argue that treatments of the conditional that\ndo not render conditionals like these automatically true would be\npreferable. \nOn to counterfactuals or subjunctive conditionals—conditionals\nof the form, “If it were (had been) the case that \\(A\\), then it\nwould be (have been) the case that \\(B\\)”. A common treatment,\ndue to Stalnaker (1968) and Lewis (1973), analyses them in terms of\npossible worlds. In a simple version, they are true just in case at\nthe closest worlds where \\(A\\) is true, \\(B\\) is true, where closeness\nis understood as similarity in relevant respects. “If Kangaroos\nhad no tails, they would topple over” is true when, at all\nworlds where kangaroos have no tails and which are as relevantly\nsimilar as it gets to the actual world, kangaroos topple over. \nThis again makes all counterfactuals whose consequent is necessary, or\nwhose antecedent is impossible, vacuously true: there are no worlds to\nfalsify the consequent, or to verify the antecedent. Counterfactuals\nwith impossible antecedents are called counterpossibles. They\ndon’t seem to be all vacuously true. An often-cited example from\nNolan (1997): \nSquaring the circle is a mathematical impossibility, in spite of\nHobbes’ hopes. His achieving it, though, would have made no\ndifference for those sick children. (9) should come out true for this\nreason, not because no possible world verifies the antecedent. For\nsimilar reasons, (8) should come out false. Against vacuism, some\ncounterpossible pairs with opposite consequents should have different\ntruth values (for a defense of vacuism, see Williamson 2007; for a\ndiscussion, see Berto et al. 2018). \nHyperintensionality was initially tied to representation: Cresswell\n(1975) discussed a semantics for a formal language where substitution\nof logical equivalents fails in intentional contexts (he mentioned\n“says that”, “knows that”, “believes\nthat”, “deduces that”: 1975: 37). Other cases\ndiscussed above might contribute to the impression that our language\ncontains hyperintensional expressions just because of phenomena\ninvolving representation. \nHowever, various philosophers have employed hyperintensional resources\nto theorize about aspects of the world beyond representation.\nFamously, Fine (1994) argues that work on the essences of\nthings must play a central role in metaphysics and essence talk must\nbe hyperintensional. In the construction “\\(x\\) is essentially\n\\(F\\)”, we cannot be guaranteed to preserve truth by\nsubstituting necessarily equivalent predicates. Socrates is (suppose)\nessentially human, but not essentially (human and a member of a set),\nalthough necessarily someone is human if and only if they are human\nand a member of a set. Fine extends this to talk of real definition\ngenerally: it is the real definition of 2 that it is the successor of\n1, but not the real definition of 2 that it is \\(10-8\\), even though\n“the successor of 1” and “\\(10-8\\)”\nnecessarily have the same extension. (These examples are not in Fine\n1994, but we take it he would endorse them given his discussion on pp.\n4–5 and p 14.) Dunn (1990b) also argues that one needs\nhyperintensional resources (in his case, from relevant logic) to\ncapture essentialist claims. \nNolan (2014) argues for the need to provide hyperintensional accounts\nof a range of non-representational aspects of reality. As well as a\ntheory of essences, theories of counterfactuals, explanation,\nmetaphysical grounding, of the distinction between intrinsic and\nextrinsic properties, of dispositions, are all plausibly\nhyperintensional. Nolan also mentions the analysis of causation, laws\nof nature, objective confirmation, objective chance, and objective\nethics. Other recent proposals in metaphysics that have employed\nhyperintensional resources include work on truthmakers, omissions,\nmetaphysical dependence, and the distinction between qualitative and\nnon-qualitative properties. Almost any area of metaphysics where\nnecessity or counterfactuals have played a role is a candidate for\nhyperintensional approaches. We now give a flavor of hyperintensional\ntheories of some of these topics. \nThe hyperintensionality of counterfactuals has been discussed above.\nDoes their truth depend in the right kind of way on facts beyond our\nrepresentational abilities? Nolan (2014: 156) argues that it sometimes\ndoes. Regular platonic solids come in only a handful of sizes (the\nmost sides one can have, in three-dimensional space, is 20.) Still,\nthis seems true: \nIf there were a piece of steel in the shape of a 36 sided platonic\nsolid, it would have more sides than any piece of steel in the shape\nof a dodecahedron. \nOn the other hand, \nIf there were a piece of steel in the shape of a 36 sided platonic\nsolid, it would have fewer sides than any piece of steel in the shape\nof a dodecahedron \nseems false. The truth value of these is not just settled by whether\nthe antecedent is necessary. They seem to be about pieces of steel and\nhow they relate to each other. Which blocks of steel have which shapes\nis not just about us and our representations. It would not be even if\nsteel could take shapes that it in fact cannot. \nExplanation is plausibly hyperintensional: “explains” can\nbe flanked by expressions that cannot be substituted with necessary\nequivalents salva veritate. One pure mathematical truth can\nexplain another, but not every mathematical truth explains every\nother, even if every pure mathematical truth is a necessary truth\n(Baron, Colyvan, & Ripley 2020). Schneider (2011) argues that\nsometimes logical equivalents can explain each other, making a case\nthat “because” is hyperintensional. \\({\\sim}{\\sim}A\\) is\ntrue because \\(A\\) is true, but not vice versa. If the correctness of\nexplanations turns out to depend also on how the world is, rather than\nonly on what suits our explanatory practices, these cases may be due\nto hyperintensional explanatory connections in the world. (How best to\nunderstand explanations, of course, remains a contentious\nphilosophical question.) \nMetaphysical grounding is widely regarded as hyperintensional.\nSometimes a more fundamental fact necessarily leads to a less\nfundamental fact that it grounds, but the two are merely modally\ninseparable. A widely discussed example is the grounding of the\nexistence of a set in the existence of its members. On one view,\n{Socrates, Plato} automatically exists if Socrates and Plato both\nexist, but it exists only in possible worlds where Socrates and Plato\nboth exist. So the fact that Socrates and Plato both exist grounds the\nfact that {Socrates, Plato} exists (see Dunn 1990b; Fine 1994). But\nthat {Socrates, Plato} exists is not supposed to ground the fact that\nSocrates and Plato both exist, even though necessarily one obtains\nonly if the other does. On an attractive account, many complex logical\ntruths are grounded in simpler ones. \\({\\sim}{\\sim}A\\) is grounded in\n\\(A, (A \\land A)\\), is grounded in \\(A\\), and many other logical\nequivalents of \\(A\\) are grounded in \\(A\\), though they are not the\nsame proposition as \\(A\\). And as before, while \\((A \\land A)\\) is\ngrounded in \\(A, A\\) is not grounded in \\((A \\land A)\\) (see\nPoggiolesi 2018, 2020 for a formal logic of grounding). \nWhether grounding is indeed hyperintensional may depend on how\ngrounding claims are best understood. Where “…\ngrounds…” is a sentential operator, the cases discussed\nhad best be captured hyperintensionally. “(Socrates and Plato\nboth exist) grounds (The set {Socrates, Plato} exists)”, for\nexample. Things may work differently if we take “…\ngrounds…” as a two-place predicate applying to facts or\noccurrences: “The fact that Socrates and Plato both exist\ngrounds the fact that {Socrates, Plato} exists” expresses a\nrelation between two objects, and we might be able to preserve the\ntruth of this statement by substitution of any other ways of referring\nto each of those objects. One complication is that one might take\nthese expressions picking out facts to themselves have constituents\ndesignating propositions: “the fact that Socrates and Plato both\nexist” may have the logical form the fact that A, where\nthat \\(A\\) is the proposition that Socrates and Plato exist.\nInterpreted that way, the expression is functioning hyperintensionally\nafter all, since the necessarily equivalent proposition that\n{Socrates, Plato} exists cannot be substituted into that expression\nwithout changing the truth-value of the relevant grounding claims.\nFinally, one could take the primary way of expressing grounding\nrelations to be by talking about objects in general, e.g., about\nSocrates and Plato grounding the set {Socrates, Plato} (Schaffer\n2009). On this third approach it is natural to think that any other\nways of designating those objects could be substituted salva\nveritate so that the grounding-between-objects predicate is\nextensional; though see Jenkins (2011) for a hyperintensional\nobject-theoretic grounding approach that does not allow this\nsubstitution salva veritate. \nMany grounding theorists have taken the sentential operator approach\nas primary: see Fine (2001: 15–16), Schneider (2011:\n446–7). Those that do not fall on different sides of the\nquestion of whether expressing the full range of grounding claims\nrequires hyperintensional resources. See Duncan, Miller, and Norton\n(2017) for a discussion of which styles of grounding claims are best\ntreated as hyperintensional. \nThe distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic properties features in\nmany metaphysical theories, and it appears to be\nrepresentation-independent: presumably, if mass is intrinsic it would\nremain such whatever we said or did. One idea behind the distinction\nis that a property had intrinsically is had only in virtue of an\nobject’s own nature, while extrinsic properties are partly a\nmatter of how the object stands to other objects. Some have argued\nthat necessarily coextensive properties can differ in whether they are\nintrinsic or extrinsic (Dunn 1990a; Eddon 2011; Bader 2013; Marshall\n2015; Hoffmann-Kloss 2015). Being an instance of Barak’s\nactual favorite property is plausibly extrinsic, but having a\nmass may well be intrinsic, even if mass is Barak’s\nfavorite property, and even though, given it is actually his favorite\nproperty, anything in any possible world has the first property iff it\nhas the second. The above-named philosophers disagree on how to\ncharacterize the intrinsic/extrinsic distinction, but they share the\nview that it has to be hyperintensional. \nJenkins and Nolan (2012) argue that disposition ascriptions are\nhyperintensional. Heidi the gifted mathematician may be disposed to\nfind the proof of a given conjecture, on condition that it has one.\nThis disposition of Heidi’s can be known in advance of knowing\nwhether the conjecture has a proof. (“Give this to Heidi: if\nthere’s a proof to be found, she’ll find it”.)\nSuppose the conjecture is in fact false, though the mathematical\ncommunity does not yet know that. Then the condition of the\ndisposition ascription is impossible. Still, we cannot substitute any\nimpossibility in the disposition ascription. It is plausibly false\nthat Heidi is disposed to find the proof of that conjecture, on the\ncondition that she was always both identical to the number 7 and\ninnumerate, for example. \nWe use necessarily false conditions in disposition ascriptions outside\ntalk about agents, too. Working with a model where the number of prey\nkilled is a function of the number of predators, the model might say\nadding half a fox to a closed ecosystem, or adding \\(1/\\pi\\) foxes to\nan ecosystem, produces a certain fraction of additional rabbits\nkilled. But it is impossible to have, e.g., \\(7+1/\\pi\\) foxes. Still,\nwhat the ecosystem is disposed to do on the condition \\(7+1/\\pi\\)\nfoxes are added and it is idealized in various ways is very\ndifferent from what it is disposed to do with \\(105+1/\\pi\\) foxes and\nthe same idealization. \nOne way to specify probabilities is with propositional complements:\nthe probability that it will rain tomorrow, or that this coin will\ncome up heads 10 times in a row. Take claims such as “\\(\\rP(B) =\n0.6\\)”, where the proposition that \\(B\\) is, e.g., that this\n(biased) coin will come up heads 10 times in a row. \\(\\rP\\) will be\nhyperintensional if we cannot guarantee that we preserve truth value\nby substitution of necessarily equivalent propositions. \nIf we use \\(\\rP\\) to represent the (degrees of) beliefs of an\nagent—even a logically idealized one—we might want to\nallow different probability assignments to necessarily equivalent\npropositions: with all her exhaustive knowledge of pure arithmetic and\nlogic, the agent might still be uncertain on whether water =\nH2O before investigating, in spite of certainty on the\nself-identity of water. If the hyperintensional probability function\nrepresented objective chance or frequency, however,\nhyperintensionality may also be tied to how the world is. Nolan\n(2016a) and Salmon (2019) have both recently argued that objective\nchance ascriptions are hyperintensional. \nPlausibly, “ought” is hyperintensional: perhaps you ought\nto call your sister, but it is not the case that you ought to call\nyour sister and be self-identical even though it is impossible to call\nyour sister without calling your sister and being self-identical, and\nvice versa. (Perhaps you promised to call: but unless you are a\nphilosopher you probably did not promise to be self-identical.) Some\nof these obligations might be dependent on our representational\npractices. But perhaps there are obligations of objective morality as\nwell. Perhaps your moral obligation to not callously cause suffering\nis like this. If there are objective obligations, they might be best\nconstrued as hyperintensional: the Moral Law may enjoin you to avoid\ncallously inflicting suffering, but it may be silent about whether you\nought to avoid inflicting callous suffering while being\nself-identical. See Faroldi (2019) for a recent hyperintensional\ntreatment of “ought”. \nTruthmakers theorists have been looking for a relationship between\ntrue propositions and the aspects of the world that make those\npropositions true. Theories of this relation often make truthmaking\nhyperintensional: \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) may be necessarily equivalent, yet\nthe worldly bit that makes \\(A\\) true is distinct from the one that\nmakes \\(B\\) true. As Restall (1996a) points out, this seems to follow\nif one also endorses the Disjunction Thesis: something is a truthmaker\nfor (\\(A\\) or \\(B\\)) iff it is a truthmaker for \\(A\\) or a\ntruthmaker for \\(B\\). Independently of the Disjunction Thesis, a\ntruthmaker for one necessary truth may plausibly not be a truthmaker\nfor all others: “There are infinitely many prime numbers”\nshould have as truthmaker something to do with numbers. “Anyone\nwho eats and drinks at least eats” seems to not have anything to\ndo with numbers. See MacBride (2013 [2020], the SEP entry on\n truthmakers, section 1)\n for some accounts of truthmaking where necessarily equivalent\npropositions need not have the same truthmaker. \nSome occurrences are impossible, but may still have explanatory and\neven causal consequences. It may be impossible to prove a given\nmathematical conjecture: the conjecture might have a counterexample\nthat nobody has yet noticed. Still, the fact that the conjecture is\nnot proved may have various effects: if you have bet that you will\nprove it by a certain time you will lose the bet; if your tenure case\nin the mathematics department turns on whether you managed to prove\nthe conjecture, you will miss out on tenure. Bernstein (2016) gives a\ntheory of omissions of impossible outcomes, and argues that they play\nan explanatory and causal role. \nHoffmann-Kolss (2015) argues that a number of classifications of\nproperties needed for metaphysics are hyperintensional. The\nintrinsic/extrinsic distinction is one example, discussed above.\nHoffman-Kolss also argues the qualitative/non-qualitative distinction\nis hyperintensional (the distinction between properties that do not\nrequire a relationship to a particular and those that do—e.g.,\nbeing square vs. being John’s neighbor: see\nalso Hoffman-Kolss 2019). The dispositional/categorical distinction is\narguably hyperintensional (Hoffmann-Kolss 2015: 341–342, 346).\n(One philosophically controversial example may illustrate: on some\ntheories, there is a necessarily-existing God that is necessarily the\nonly omnipotent being. Still, we might think being omnipotent\nis dispositional, concerning the powers of that being, while being\nGod is categorical (2015: 346).) The distinction between\nperfectly natural properties that best carve at the joints, and the\nothers, is, too (2015: 345). Hoffman-Kolss’s example here is to\ncontrast the (supposedly) perfectly natural property of being an\nelectron with the infinitely disjunctive identity property of\nbeing \\(e_1\\) or being \\(e_2\\) or… and so on\nfor all possible electrons \\(e\\). If electronhood is essential to the\nobjects that have it, something is an electron if and only if it is\none of \\(e_1\\), \\(e_2\\), etc., but Hoffman-Kolss argues this latter\ncondition is not a perfectly natural one. \nAny item on this list might be controversial. You might think that\ncounterfactual conditionals, for example, communicate more about how\nwe explain or predict the world than anything about the world as it\nis. Or that what explains what is more a matter of the representations\nwe make of the world, than of the world itself. One could try to\nexplain away grounding’s putative hyperintensionality in terms\nof our cognitive structures, as Thompson (2016) suggests. Thompson and\nByrne (2019) offer a general “conceptualist” alternative\nto taking any of the cases we discussed as requiring\nnon-representational phenomena to be characterized in hyperintensional\nterms: an explanation of our use of hyperintensional language to\ncapture these phenomena comes from an account of what it is to\ndescribe and explain in these areas (2019: 157). Still, if a need to\nrecognize hyperintensional distinctions flows from more than facts\nabout how we represent the world, hyperintensionality will be of\ninterest well beyond philosophy of mind and language. \nWhile\n Section 4\n considers some difficulties for specific hyperintensional theories,\nhere we discuss general objections to the very idea that we need a\ntheory of language or mind that marks hyperintensional distinctions.\nOne kind of argument in this ballpark has to do with a general\n“Boolean” challenge to formulating a semantics for\nhyperintensional expressions in the dominant truth-conditional\nframework. This style of argument will be discussed in\n §2.1. \nAnother kind of argument advanced by defenders of SPWS such as\nStalnaker (1984) and Lewis (1982, 1986), has it that the prima\nfacie hyperintensionality of knowledge, belief, or content is\nmisleading, and that SPWS can still do the job once misleading\nintuitions have been explained away. This style of argument will be\ndiscussed in\n §2.2. \nOne way to modify SPWS to give truth conditions for sentences is to\nresort to sets including both possible and impossible worlds (ways\nthings could not have been). Sentences that agree in truth\nvalue in very possible world can still be assigned distinct\ntruth-conditions, since those sentences might be true in different\nimpossible worlds. (See\n §4.3).\n Another way is to use structured meanings, where sentences\nwith the same possible-worlds truth conditions can have different\nmeanings because of the way they are built up. (See\n §4.5).\n An objection to these approaches can be generalized to any approach\nthat tries to make room for hyperintensionality in a truth-conditional\nframework. \nThe objection, presented in Cresswell (2002) against structured\npropositions and suggested by Stalnaker (1996) against impossible\nworlds, can be illustrated by focusing on the meaning of negation.\nGiven a statement \\(A\\), what truth-conditions can we offer for\n\\({\\sim}A\\)? Plausibly, the truth conditions can be exhausted by\nspecifying that \\({\\sim}A\\) is true when \\(A\\) is false, and not\notherwise. Since this exhausts the meaning of\n“\\({\\sim}\\)”, it is tempting to identify the proposition\n\\({\\sim}A\\) as being the proposition with this truth condition.\nPlausibly, also, the truth conditions for \\({\\sim}{\\sim}A\\) will just\nbe the truth conditions for \\(A\\). (We may even want to derive this\nsecond claim from plausible principles about truth, falsehood, and\nnecessity.) Now any theory which allows for distinct necessarily\nequivalent propositions will fall to the same objection: suppose \\(C\\)\nand \\(D\\) are distinct, necessarily equivalent propositions. Then\n\\({\\sim}C\\) will be the proposition that is true just in case \\(C\\) is\nfalse, and \\({\\sim}D\\) will be the proposition that is true just in\ncase \\(D\\) is false: so \\({\\sim}C\\) and \\({\\sim}D\\) will be the same\nproposition. But then there will be a unique proposition with the\ntruth conditions for \\({\\sim}{\\sim}C (/{\\sim}{\\sim}D)\\), since\n\\({\\sim}{\\sim}C\\) is the negation of \\({\\sim}C\\). So \\(C\\) and \\(D\\)\nmust be the same proposition after all. This is a reductio of\nthe hypothesis that there can be a hyperintensional distinction\nbetween \\(C\\) and \\(D\\): if they are necessarily equivalent, they are\nidentical. \nWe might call this an objection from Booleanism, both because\nuniqueness of truth-conditional complementation is characteristic of\nBoolean approaches to negation, and because similar objections can be\nmotivated by Boolean thoughts about other operations. We might hope to\ndefine conjunction so that necessarily, \\((A \\land B)\\) is true iff\n\\(A\\) is true and \\(B\\) is true, and indeed the truth condition for\nthe proposition that \\((A \\land B)\\) is just that both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nare true. But then, with other innocuous assumptions, any two\nnecessarily equivalent sentences will express the same proposition, by\na similar chain of reasoning. \nCresswell (1975) was one of the pioneers of structured approaches to\nsentence meaning to handle hyperintensionality. So it is significant\nthat he thinks this objection refutes a contention at the heart of\northodox structured meaning projects, though Cresswell thinks that we\nmay still be interested in semantic structures for reasons other than\nhow they might make a difference to the truth-conditions of complex\nembeddings. \nDefenders of hyperintensional meanings need to resist the idea that\nfor each proposition \\(A\\) there is only one proposition true whenever\n\\(A\\) is false. This leaves them with a challenge: how are we to\nunderstand logical operations such as negation and conjunction once\nthese Boolean characterizations are rejected? \nTalk of belief, desire, and meaning is prima facie\nhyperintensional, as discussed above. But perhaps this appearance\ncould be resisted. One strategy is to employ use/mention distinctions\nin novel ways. Instead of hyperintensional operations on propositions\nor other meanings, we can treat apparently hyperintensional language\nas expressing properties of or relations between sentences or other\npieces of language. If we do this systematically, a theory can do away\nwith merely intensional distinctions. \nQuine (1953) suggests that modal operators, when we need them at all,\nare best interpreted as predicates of sentences. Quine (1956) and\nDavidson (1968) suggest an approach to propositional attitude\nascriptions as implicitly talking about connections between people and\nsentences: “John believes that it is raining” is\nregimented as a two-place predicate holding between John and the\nsentence “It is raining”. For Davidson, this in effect\nasserts that John stands in a certain relation to a sentence that\nstands in the same-saying relation to the sentence “It is\nraining”. This supposedly accommodates how non-English speakers\ncan believe that it is raining. Reconstruing mental attitude reports\nas reporting relations to sentences has fallen out of favor in\ncontemporary philosophy, for reasons largely orthogonal to\nintensionality or hyperintensionality: see Propositional Attitude\nAscriptions, section 7. Still, with enough ingenuity techniques like\nQuine’s and Davidson’s could be extended to apparently\nhyperintensional pieces of language. \nSome philosophers who reject extensionalism nevertheless offer\ntechniques for avoiding treating beliefs and desires as\nhyperintensional. Stalnaker (1984) tries to rescue the SPWS analysis\nof propositional content by explaining away hyperintensional\nintuitions via a sort of metalinguistic approach: when we fail to see\nthat a proposition is necessarily true, or that two propositions are\nnecessarily equivalent, we are actually failing to see what\npropositions are expressed by certain sentences. Given sentence \\(A\\),\none should distinguish (1) the proposition \\(P\\) expressed by \\(A\\)\n(in a context), and (2) the proposition \\(P\\)* that A\nexpresses \\(P\\), relating the sentence to what it expresses.\nIgnorance of necessary truths or equivalences is ignorance about\nP*. \nStalnaker maintains that whenever one fails to know or believe a necessary truth, \\(A\\),\none actually fails to fully grasp the sentence \\(A\\)’s meaning:\none doesn’t realize that \\(A\\) expresses the total set of\nworlds. Stalnaker points at the occasional distance between the\nsyntactic structure of the relevant \\(A\\), which can be quite complex,\nand the expressed proposition—in SPWS, an unstructured entity (a\nset): \nWhenever the structure of sentences is complicated, there will be a\nnontrivial question about the relation between sentences and the\npropositions they express, and so there will be room for reasonable\ndoubt about what proposition is expressed by a given sentence.\n(Stalnaker 1984: 84) \nFor Stalnaker’s story to work in general, all cases of ignorance\nof necessary truths or equivalences must be instances of meaning\nignorance. This is difficult to believe. A mathematician who wonders\nwhether Goldbach’s conjecture is true can hardly be described as\nmistaken about what “Every even integer larger than two is the\nsum of two primes” means. They know the meanings of all\nconstituents of the sentence—they have mastered the\nelementary-school-math concepts even integer, larger\nthan, two, sum, prime number as much\nas any of us. As competent speakers of English, they understand how\nthe syntax of the sentence makes its constituents conjure for it to\nexpress the content it expresses. What they have doubts about is\nwhether that content is true. We sometimes seem to fully grasp the\ncontents of sentences whose status of necessary truths, or falsities,\nwe are ignorant of. \nLewis (1982) proposes a fragmentation strategy to explain away\napparent failures of logical omniscience, in particular, apparent\nbelief in inconsistencies which is not, however, belief in everything.\nOne’s epistemic state may be split into different “frames\nof mind”. One may believe \\(A\\) in one mind frame, \\({\\sim}A\\)\nin another one, but fail to put them together: \nI used to think that Nassau Street ran roughly east-west; that the\nrailroad nearby ran roughly north-south; and that the two were roughly\nparallel. […] So each sentence in an inconsistent triple was\ntrue according to my beliefs, but not everything was true according to\nmy beliefs. […] My system of beliefs was broken into\n(overlapping) fragments. Different fragments came into action in\ndifferent situations, and the whole system of beliefs never manifested\nitself all at once. […] The inconsistent conjunction of all\nthree did not belong to, was in no way implied by, and was not true\naccording to, any one fragment. That is why it was not true according\nto my system of beliefs taken as a whole. (Lewis 1982: 436) \nEach fragment can be given the SPWS treatment, while trans-fragmental\ninconsistencies do not trivialize the belief system. \nThe account, just like Stalnaker’s, doesn’t seem to\ngeneralize. It seems strange to say that when agents don’t\nfollow through the logical consequences of what they believe,\nit’s always because they haven’t conjoined the premises\nwhereas, when they do, they suddenly come to believe all the\ninfinitely many consequences (Jago 2014). It’s sometimes an easy\nlogical step from \\(A_1, A_2, A_3\\), to \\(A_1 \\land A_2 \\land A_3\\).\nWhat is often difficult is to see whether a remote \\(B\\) follows from\n\\(A_1 \\land A_2 \\land A_3\\). \nEven if Lewis and Stalnaker can explain away the apparent\nhyperintensionality of belief, these attempts to not extend in any\nstraightforward way to all prima facie cases of\nhyperintensionality. Stalnaker, at least, seems committed to a project\nof explaining away many apparent cases of hyperintensionality,\ncommitted as he is to a SPWS account of linguistic meaning and mental\ncontent (Stalnaker 1984). So far as we can tell, Stalnaker is willing\nto take this project piece-meal. \nLewis seems more hospitable to hyperintensional approaches, provided\nthey can be ultimately explained in terms of possible worlds and\nset-theoretic constructions out of them. In Lewis (1986: 49–50),\nhe discusses a hyperintensional “trivially” operator that\nwould apply differently to different necessary truths. In a\nposthumously published letter (Lewis 2004) he seems to acknowledge\nthat there was more than one distinct impossible fiction, and\npresumably that “According to fiction \\(f, A\\)” was\nhyperintensional (since when \\(f\\) is an impossible fiction, there\nwill be some impossible claim that is true according to it, but in\ngeneral not all impossible claims will be). \nPhilosophers suspicious of hyperintensionality in particular areas\nshould consider if this stems from features of the specific case or is\ngeneral. If the latter, they may wish to attempt a general account of\nmeaning that ensures we never need to acknowledge hyperintensionality:\notherwise, a general suspicion will risk being undermined. \nThe flip side of hyperintensionality’s pervasiveness is its\nencompassing very diverse phenomena. We now investigate what (little)\nwe know about the general structure of hyperintensionality. The\ninitial characterization, recall, merely tells us that a concept or\noperator is hyperintensional when it is more fine-grained than\nintensional or standard modal concepts or operators, marking a\ndistinction invisible to the latter. As Jespersen and Duží\nreminded us, little is said on “how hyper” hyperintensions\nare. The tag of “granularity problems” (Barwise 1997; Jago\n2014; Bjerring & Schwarz 2017) labels a set of issues concerning\nthe right level of fine-grainedness. There are several related\nproblems here, because different hyperintensional concepts seem to\ndisplay different degrees of fine-grainedness. This can be understood\nagain in terms of substitution salva veritate for the\nrelevant operators: \\(X\\) is strictly more fine-grained than \\(Y\\)\nwhen all substitutions that go through for \\(X\\) also do for \\(Y,\\)\nbut \\(X\\) fails some, which goes through for \\(Y.\\) \nA requirement often suggested is that a hyperintensional account of\nthis or that notion shouldn’t make it as fine-grained as the\nsyntax of the language one is working with—on pain of giving\naway the very point of having a semantics for it. Propositions may be\nmore fine-grained than sets of possible worlds, but they had better\nnot be mappable 1:1 to the sentences expressing them. Otherwise, we\nwould lose one main motivation for having propositions to begin with,\nnamely that syntactically different sentences can say the same thing.\nIt also seems intuitive that, e.g., the content of \\(A\\) should be the\nsame as that of \\(A \\land A\\), and that \\(A \\land B\\) should have the\nsame content as \\(B \\land A\\): “It’s windy and rainy\ntoday” seems to just say the same thing as “It’s\nrainy and windy today” (for further motivations for\ncoarse-graining, see Bjerring & Schwarz 2017). On the other hand,\na limited cognitive agent may fail to make even the simplest inference\nstarting from what she knows or believes: she may believe that \\(A\n\\land B\\), fail to perform Conjunction Elimination, and thus fail to\nbelieve that \\(A\\). Psychologically very realistic accounts of\nknowledge or belief seem to require extreme fine-grainedness, cutting\nmore finely than same-saying. Jespersen (2010) is one example of a\ntheory that has very fine-grained meanings available for some\nconstructions, while offering more coarse-grained meanings for some\ntraditional purposes where little or no hyperintensionality is\nrequired. \nOne may hope for a total ordering of hyperintensional notions\nby fine-grainedness, i.e., an ordering such that any two given ones\nare comparable: given any \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), either \\(X\\) is at least as\nfine-grained as \\(Y\\), or vice versa. But one can show that the simple\nsetting is wrong. One can provide intuitive examples (inspired by\nHornischer 2017, which also includes a thorough discussion) of\nincomparable hyperintensional operators: \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) for which\nthere are sentences \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\), such that \\(XA\\) and\n\\(XB\\) are equivalent but \\(YA\\) and \\(YB\\) are not, \\(YC\\) and \\(YD\\)\nare equivalent but \\(XC\\) and \\(XD\\) are not. \nTake “Lois Lane knows that …” and “…\nbecause Clark Kent loves the Guggenheim Museum”. Consider the\nfour sentences: \nLois Lane knows that \\(A\\) (Clark Kent loves the Guggenheim Museum) if\nand only if she knows that \\(B\\) (“Clark Kent loves the\nGuggenheim Museum” is true) (surely Lois knows how truth\nworks!). On the other hand, she knows that \\(C\\) (Clark Kent is in New\nYork), but she doesn’t know that \\(D\\) (Superman, too, is), for\nshe is not aware that Superman is Clark Kent. \nAlso, it is false that \\(A\\) (Clark Kent loves the Guggenheim Museum)\nbecause Clark Kent loves the Guggenheim Museum (facts can’t\nexplain themselves), while it is true that \\(B\\) (“Clark Kent\nloves the Guggenheim Museum” is true) because Clark Kent loves\nthe Guggenheim Museum (assuming truth supervenes on/is grounded in\nfacts). On the other hand, \\(C\\) (Clark Kent is in New York) because\nClark Kent loves the Guggenheim Museum if and only if \\(D\\) (Superman\nis in New York) because Clark Kent loves the Guggenheim Museum, for\nSuperman is Clark Kent. \nSo knows and because turn out to be incomparable,\nand, given that they are hyperintensional, there is no total ordering\nfor hyperintensional notions. This may sustain some skepticism\n(ventilated, e.g., in Leitgeb 2019) on the possibility of a single\ntheory for all hyperintensional operators. On the other hand, it makes\nsense to conjecture that these can be at least partially ordered. It\nis then an issue worth investigating, whether concepts belonging to a\nsingle sub-family, e.g., the non-representational ones, or the\nrepresentational semantic ones, can be internally totally ordered\n(notice that knows is representational, while one may take\nbecause as belonging to “ontic” explanation). Or,\nthe other way around, the identification of totally ordered subsets of\nthe partially ordered set of hyperintensional concepts may be a good\nway to group such concepts into families that carve at the joints. \nWe now provide a survey of general hyperintensional approaches. Hardly\nany of them has been put forth as a systematic account of all\nhyperintensional notions. However, we focus on frameworks that are\ngeneral enough to handle a broad range of phenomena (thus we do not\nconsider, e.g., hyperintensional epistemic logics that target only\ncertain forms of logical omniscience, like justification logic). We\nbriefly introduce the key ideas of each approach, and we discuss how\nit handles hyperintensional phenomena such as those introduced in\n Section 1.\n We highlight relative merits and open issues. \nTwo-dimensional semantic theories (see entry on\n two-dimensional semantics)\n build on standard possible worlds semantics to handle a range of\nrepresentational hyperintensional phenomena. Originating in\ntwo-dimensional modal logic (Segerberg 1973; van Fraassen 1977; Davies\n& Humberstone 1980), versions of the view have been presented by\nKaplan (1989), Jackson (1994), and Chalmers (1996). (Stalnaker [1978]\nis a key pioneer of the approach, but he applied it to the pragmatics\nof communication, rather than to provide a hyperintensional semantics:\nsee Stalnaker 2004.) \nSometimes what a word picks out depends on context. Indexicals\n(“I”, “you”, “here”,\n“yesterday”) and demonstratives (“this”,\n“that”, “over there”) are obvious cases: which\nthing someone refers to using “this” depends on what they\nare demonstrating at the time. Kaplan (1989) proposed that these\nexpressions function as rigid designators on occasions of use: whether\nthe proposition expressed by a sentence including one is true at a\npossible world depends on how things stand with the object, if any,\nreferred to in the actual world. If on 5 March 2020 I say\n“Yesterday it was sunny”, I express a proposition true at\na possible world iff it is sunny on 4 March 2020 in that world. Elvis\nsays “I was born in 1935”: that is true at a possible\nworld iff Elvis was born in 1935 there. \nOn this view, “I am Elvis”, said by Elvis, is true just in\ncase Elvis is Elvis, thus necessarily true. Ditto for “Yesterday\nwas 4 March 2020”, said on 5 March 2020, which is true just in\ncase 4 March 2020 is 4 March 2020. Expressing those necessary truths\ncan, however, give contingent information to hearers who already knew\nthings are self-identical. To capture the difference between “I\nam Elvis” and “Elvis is Elvis”, when uttered by\nElvis as well as by someone else—say, Aretha—we would need\na story about the meaning of “I” that did not treat it as\na name. Kaplan took such meaning as a function from a context of\nutterance to an object, selecting the speaker as the object.\nSimilarly, the meaning of “yesterday” is a function from\nthe day of utterance, selecting the day before. This function is\ncalled the character of the expression. My knowing the\ncharacter (and facts about context) lets me take new information from\nthe utterances. I know “I” picks out the speaker and that\nthe speaker said “I am Elvis”. If I trust him, I can work\nout the speaker is Elvis. I might not have known that before,\nalthough I knew that Elvis is Elvis. \nMeanings, in this view, have two components: a character and\na content. The content is normally given via possible worlds.\nThe character is a function from contexts of utterance to contents.\nThe content of “I am Elvis”, uttered by Elvis, is the\ntotal set of worlds, since Elvis couldn’t but be Elvis. The\ncharacter is a function from the context’s speaker to the\ncontent that that person is Elvis. So it is a function from Elvis to\nthe content that Elvis is Elvis, from Aretha to the content that\nAretha is Elvis, etc. \nTraditionally, philosophers have found it useful to represent this\ninteraction of character and content with a two-dimensional matrix,\nhence the expression “two dimensional semantics”. Let us\nillustrate with a small example. In \\(W_1\\), Elvis is singing but\nAretha is not, and in \\(W_2\\), Aretha is singing but Elvis is not, and\nin \\(W_3\\), neither is singing. Consider the sentence “I am\nsinging”, with two possible speakers, Elvis and Aretha. We get\nthe following six scenarios, depending on which speaker is speaking\nand which world the resulting content is being evaluated at: \nEach horizontal line (row) of the matrix represents a content that can\nbe associated with “I am singing”, with different rows\nrepresenting the different contents produced by different contexts\n(due to different speakers, in this case). The entire matrix\nrepresents facts about the character of a sentence. These\ntwo-dimensional matrices become more interesting when more complex\nconstructions are discussed, but the key ideas for current purposes\nare more easily presentable without further using matrices. \nNow some proponents of two-dimensional semantics extend this setting\nbeyond indexicals and demonstratives, e.g., to proper names\nand natural kind terms. Take “Robin Hood”. Its\ncontent, suppose, is just Robin. But its character is a function from\ncontexts to such contents. In a world where our use of “Robin\nHood” derives in the right kind of way from Robin, the character\ndelivers our Robin as the content of “Robin Hood”. In a\nworld where Richard leads a band of outlaws in Sherwood, uses\n“Robin Hood” as an alias, is famous for robbing for the\nrich to give to the poor, the character of “Robin Hood”\npicks out Richard. Similarly for expression\n“water” and H2O in our world, or\n“XYZ” in Twin Earth: the character of “water”\npicks out different substances in different contexts. \nCharacter-sensitive expressions can give rise to hyperintensionality.\nTake “It is a priori that”: It is a\npriori that Hesperus is Hesperus; it is not a priori\nthat Hesperus is Phosphorus. Although “Hesperus” and\n“Phosphorus” have the same content (the planet Venus),\nthey can differ in character. There may be contingent a\npriori cases: Elvis says “I am here now” in a context\nwhere the assigned content is that Elvis Presley is in Graceland on\nnoon of 25 December 1975. “I am here now”, some claim, can\nbe known a priori by Elvis, but he cannot know a\npriori that Elvis is in Graceland on noon of 25 December\n1975. \nPropositional attitude contexts make for a salient case. The Sheriff\nof Nottingham believes Robin Hood is a dangerous outlaw. He does not\nbelieve that Robin of Locksley is a dangerous outlaw, although Robin\nHood is Locksley. We can explain this if we take “believes\nthat” as character-sensitive. “Robin Hood is a dangerous\noutlaw” and “Robin of Locksley is a dangerous\noutlaw” coincide in content (they are true in the same worlds).\nBut we can assign different characters to “Robin Hood” and\n“Robin of Locksley” by looking at differences in how they\nare typically acquired, in the causal history leading back to their\nfirst uses, or if we tie them to how the Sheriff sees the world. This\ncan be generalized to so-called intensional transitive verbs. The\nSheriff can be looking for Robin Hood but not looking for Robin of\nLocksley if “looking for” is sensitive to character. \nTwo-dimensional approaches are somewhat controversial when they move\nbeyond indexicals and demonstratives. (See the papers in\nGarcía-Carpintero and Maciá 2006 for arguments for and\nagainst two-dimensional semantics.) But they can account for the\napparent hyperintensionality of “it is a priori\nthat…” or “… believes that…”\nwithout straying too far from a traditional possible-worlds framework.\nContents keep being sets of possible worlds. Qua functions from\ncontexts to contents, characters are familiar from standard treatments\nof context-dependent expressions such as Kaplan’s. \nTwo-dimensional semantics also has a nice story on the behavior of\nindexicals in belief contexts. “I believe you are Elvis”,\nsaid addressing Elvis, appears to mean something different from\n“I believe Elvis is Elvis”. I would happily utter the\nlatter but not the former if I believe I am facing an Elvis\nimpersonator. It is hard to avoid the impression that the character of\nexpressions like “you” (or, “yesterday”,\n“that car”, etc.) makes the difference in such cases. \nTwo-dimensional semantic theories cannot easily offer a general\naccount of hyperintensionality. Worldly hyperintensionality is\nespecially recalcitrant. When, e.g., talk of essence is employed, and\nwe say that Socrates is essentially human but is not essentially\n(human and \\(2 + 2 = 4)\\), or not essentially (human and either bats\nhave wings or it is not the case that bats have wings), those two\nalternatives to “human” both have the same two-dimensional\nintension as “human”. Any context will pick out the same\ncontent for the predicates “is human”, “is human and\nsuch that \\(2 + 2 = 4\\)”, and “is human and either bats\nhave wings or it is not the case that bats have wings”. \nThe full range of non-trivial counterpossible conditionals are not\neasily handled either. Take “If Hobbes had squared the circle,\nHobbes would have proved an impressive mathematical result”.\nThis is plausibly true, whereas “If Archimedes had squared the\ncircle, Hobbes would have proved an impressive mathematical\nresult” is false: Archimedes lived well before Hobbes and so\nwould have beaten him to it, and Hobbes did not otherwise prove any\nimpressive results. The necessary falsehoods “Hobbes squared the\ncircle” and “Archimedes squared the circle” seem to\ndeliver different truth values as antecedents in same-consequent\ncounterfactuals. Functions from contexts to contents taken as the\nusual sets of possible worlds don’t deliver the desired result:\nwhichever other person a context picks out for “Hobbes”,\nit is hard to see how “\\(x\\) squared the circle” could\npick out a contingent proposition that would be useful. Prospects are\nnot quite hopeless here: approaches that employ two-dimensionalism as\nat least part of the picture about indicative conditionals\nhave been suggested by Weatherson (2001) and Nolan (2003). One might\nhope for an extension to counterfactuals. Or perhaps some other\napproach might work: recent work on counter-analytic conditionals done\nby Locke (forthcoming) and Kocurek, Jerzak, and Rudolph (2020) is\npromising. \nTwo-dimensionalism may be appealing as an account of some\nhyperintensional phenomena even if it cannot be generalized: it can be\nseen as one tool among others for constructing semantic theories for\nhyperintensional expressions, if one is willing to forego a\none-size-fits all approach. \nSome theories of propositional content represent a number of\nhyperintensional distinctions by combining SPWS with ways of splitting\nthe modal space. The main work in this area is Yablo’s book\nAboutness (2014; and see Osorio-Kupferblum 2016 for a\ncritical discussion). Aboutness is \nthe relation that meaningful items bear to whatever it is that they\nare on or of or that they address or\nconcern, (Yablo 2014: 1) \nnamely, their subject matter. The subject matter of a\nsentence in context can be seen as a topic, an issue, or a question\nthe sentence may be taken, in that context, as answering to. When the\nissue is the number of stars, the relevant question may be:\n“How many stars are there?”. As in inquisitive semantics\n(Ciardelli, Groenendijk, & Roelofsen 2013), one can associate the\nquestion with the set of its answers: There are no stars; There is one\nstar; There are two stars; etc. Answers are propositions in the SPWS\nsense: sets of possible worlds. We now call these thin\npropositions for the full propositional contents of sentences will\nturn out to be richer than that. The question, thus, splits the\ntotality of worlds into sets (the relevant thin propositions). Two\nworlds \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) end up in the same set just in case they\nagree on the answer—in our example: when the number of stars is\nthe same at \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\). When, as in the example, the question\nhas just one correct answer, the thin propositions at issue form a\npartition of the set of worlds \\(W\\): a splitting into subsets such\nthat their union is all of \\(W\\), and such that each \\(w\\) in\n\\(W\\) is in exactly one subset or cell. One cell has all the 0-star\nworlds, one all the 1-star worlds, one all the 2-star worlds, and so\non. \nWhile the idea is already in Lewis (1988) (see also Plebani and\nSpolaore forthcoming), Yablo proposes a generalization due to some\nquestions’ having more than one correct answer:\n“Where’s a good Italian restaurant in Amsterdam?”. A\nworld \\(w_1\\) can be in more than one cell now: it can agree with\n\\(w_2\\) by having a good Italian restaurant in Rembrandtplein, with\n\\(w_3\\) by having another good Italian restaurant in Keizersgracht.\nHere the question determines a division of \\(W\\): a splitting into\nsubsets whose union is \\(W\\), but which can overlap. \nThere’s an intuitive mereology of issues, topics, or subject\nmatters: they should be capable of overlapping and of fusing into\nwholes which inherit the proper features from the parts (Yablo 2014:\nSection 3.2). The topic philosophy and the topic\nmathematics overlap (the overlap including, presumably,\nlogic). How things went in 1882 is included in the\nlarger how things went in the nineteenth century. A larger\nsubject matter induces smaller cells: \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) agree on\nwhat happened in their whole nineteenth century only if they agree on\nwhat happened in their 1882 to begin with. \nLet \\(|A|\\), a subset of \\(W\\), be the thin proposition expressed by\n\\(A\\). The thick proposition expressed by \\(A\\), [\\(A\\)], is\nits thin proposition \\(|A|\\) together with \\(A\\)’s subject\nmatter, \\(s(A)\\). How does one get the subject matter of\n\\(A\\)? Yablo suggests assigning a positive subject matter, the\ndivision corresponding to “Why is \\(A\\) true?”; a negative\nsubject matter, the division corresponding to “Why is \\(A\\)\nfalse?”; and to identify the overall \\(s(A)\\) with its positive\nand negative subject matters taken together. Worlds agree on the\noverall subject matter of \\(A\\) when either \\(A\\) is true, or \\(A\\) is\nfalse, for the same reasons at them. Yablo calls the reasons for\n\\(A\\)’s being true (false), \\(A\\)’s truthmakers\n(falsemakers). He suggests not to read them in a\nmetaphysically loaded way, as chunks of reality whose obtaining\nnecessitates truth, and advocates a “semantic” conception\nof truthmaking: truth/falsemakers are cells of divisions of \\(W\\),\nthus, just sets of worlds again, i.e., thin propositions. \nThick propositions are hyperintensional. They cut at least as finely\nas ordinary sets of worlds: when \\(|A|\\) differs from \\(|B|\\), [\\(A\\)]\nwill differ from [\\(B\\)]. Additionally, there will be \\(A\\)’s\nand \\(B\\)’s expressing different thick propositions in spite of\nbeing true at the same worlds, because they are about different\nthings: \\(s(A)\\) will differ from \\(s(B)\\) even if \\(|A| = |B|\\). For\nexample, “There is an even number of stars or there is\nnot” and “There are no non-self-identical Italian\nrestaurants” are both necessarily true, but they correspond to\ndistinct thick propositions because of their different subject\nmatters. The suggestion that adding subject matter to semantics is the\nkey to handling hyperintensionality is discussed in Gioulatou\n(2016). \nTo get a precise answer on which hyperintensional distinctions the\nframework can make, one needs a full-fledged truthmaker assignment to\nall sentences of the target language. Yablo gives two “semantic\npictures”, a reductive and a recursive one,\nwhich pull in different directions. We take the recursive route, which\nrelies on van Fraassen (1969) and is found more plausible by some\n(e.g., Hawke 2018; Fine 2020), and leave the details to a consultation\nof Yablo (2014: 56–9). In a plain sentential language: when\n\\(A\\) is an atomic formula \\(p\\) one can assign it some truthmaker\n\\(\\{p^+\\}\\) and falsemaker \\(\\{p^-\\}\\). Negation flips: For \\(A =\n{\\sim}B\\), what truthmakes \\(A\\) is what falsemakes \\(B\\) and vice\nversa. For \\(A = B \\land C\\), what truthmakes \\(A\\) is the union of\nwhat truthmakes \\(B\\) and what truthmakes \\(C\\); what falsemakes \\(A\\)\nis what either falsemakes \\(B\\) or falsemakes \\(C\\). For \\(A = B \\lor\nC\\), we flip the truth- and falsemakers of \\(B \\land C\\). Then, e.g.,\n\\(p \\land q\\) is made true by \\(\\{p^+, q^+\\}\\), false by \\(\\{p^-\\}\\)\nand by \\(\\{q^-\\}\\); \\(p \\lor q\\) is made true by \\(\\{p^+\\}\\) and by\n\\(\\{q^+\\}\\); false by \\(\\{p^-, q^-\\}\\). \nNow \\(p \\lor {\\sim}p\\) and \\(q \\lor {\\sim}q\\) (“John is either a\nbachelor or not”, “Either 44 is the sum of two primes or\nnot”) will express distinct thick propositions insofar as they\nare about different things (how things stand John-wise is a different\nissue from how things stand 44-wise). When, with distinct \\(p\\) and\n\\(q\\), the truthmakers of \\(p \\lor {\\sim}p\\) are \\(\\{p^+\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{p^-\\}\\), those of \\(q \\lor {\\sim}q\\) are \\(\\{q^+\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{q^-\\}, s(p \\lor {\\sim}p)\\) will differ from \\(s(q \\lor {\\sim}q)\\)\nand so the two thick propositions [\\(p \\lor {\\sim}p\\)] and [\\(q \\lor\n{\\sim}q\\)] will differ although \\(|p \\lor {\\sim}p| = |q \\lor {\\sim}q|\n= W\\). Also, [\\(p\\)] will differ from [\\(p \\land (q \\lor {\\sim}q)\\)]\nas \\(p\\) is truthmade by \\(\\{p^+\\}, p \\land (q \\lor {\\sim}q)\\) by\n\\(\\{p^+, q^+\\}\\) and \\(\\{p^+, q^-\\}\\), not by \\(\\{p^+\\}\\). So one can\ncapture the idea that “You see that Mary is eating an ice\ncream” and “You see that Mary is eating an ice cream and\nJohn is either eating chips or not” don’t say the same, in\nthe face of the logical equivalence of \\(A\\) and \\(A \\land (B \\lor\n{\\sim}B\\)). \nBut even lacking a precise treatment for a predicative language, we\ncan see that distinct, logically atomic necessarily true or false\ncontents may be difficult to tell apart. Take “Mike is\nMike”, \\(m = m\\), and “Mike is Jack the Ripper”, \\(m\n= j\\), which differ in informativeness. Given that Mike is Jack and\nthe necessity of identity, \\(|m = m| = |m = j| = W\\); but also the\nsubject matters will coincide: what makes both claims true is a fact\nabout Mike, Mike’s being Mike. Nothing makes either false.\n“Hobbes squared the circle”, \\(Sh\\), and “Daniel\nNolan squared the circle”, \\(Sd\\), concern different issues: one\nis about Hobbes’ mathematical (non)achievements, the other is\nabout Daniel’s. But \\(|Sh| = |Sd| = \\emptyset\\), and\nthere’s no way to get truth/falsemakers as sets of possible\nworlds that will make \\(s(Sh)\\) and \\(s(Sd)\\) differ: no matter how\none splits and groups possible worlds into sets, there will be no\nworlds available where Hobbes squares the circle or where Nolan does\nto begin with. \nAs noticed by Fine (2020), the difficulty may be due to the fact that\nthe setting is conservative with respect to SPWS: it starts with the\nusual possible worlds and just adds ways of splitting and grouping\nthem (see Hawke 2018 for further criticisms). The next approach\npromises to do better by looking at worlds that step beyond the\npossible. \nIf a theorist starts from a possible worlds framework, and comes under\npressure to recognize hyperintensional distinctions, one response is\nto add impossible worlds (Priest 1992; Zalta 1997; Kiourti 2010; Jago\n2015; Berto & Jago 2019) taken as ways things could not be, or\nworlds where some truth of logic, mathematics, or metaphysics fails.\nWe will be brief on this topic here, as one can consult the entry on\n impossible worlds\n for more details. \nIn impossible worlds semantics, different impossibilities can be\ndistinguished by being associated with different sets of worlds (only\nimpossible worlds), and different necessary truths can also be\ndistinguished by different sets of worlds (all possible worlds plus\nsome of the impossible worlds). Each distinct necessary truth will\ncorrespond to a distinct set containing all possible worlds and some\nimpossible worlds; and each distinct impossible proposition will\ncorrespond to a set of worlds that contains no possible worlds, but\nwhich may contain impossible worlds (Rantala 1982). \nKripke (1965) already introduced “non-normal worlds” for\nthe semantics of modal systems such as C.I. Lewis’ S2 and S3:\nsuch worlds were points where all formulas of the form \\(\\Diamond A\\)\nare true, and all those of the form \\(\\Box A\\) are false (intuitively:\neverything is possible, nothing is necessary). Cresswell (1970)\noffered a logic of belief in which beliefs were modelled with sets of\nboth possible and impossible worlds, so as to not treat every\nimpossible belief the same as every other, and to allow someone to\nbelieve some necessary truths without believing them all. (See also\nHintikka 1975). Since then, impossible worlds have been used to\ntheorize about many of the hyperintensional phenomena discussed in\nthis entry. \nA closely related way to extend possible worlds semantics is to\nintroduce incomplete and inconsistent partial specifications of how\nthings could be, and could not be. So-called situation\nsemantics (Barwise & Perry 1983) employs these more general\nobjects to handle hyperintensional constructions such as\nspecifications of beliefs or information contents, as well as\napplications to avoid paradoxes that can arise from employing possible\nworlds. A version of situation semantics known as “truthmaker\nsemantics” has recently been defended as being superior to\nstandard world semantics (see Fine 2012, 2016, 2017; Hornischer 2020;\nMoltmann 2020, forthcoming). \nWith impossible worlds added to a theory, necessarily equivalent\nexpressions no longer have to have the same semantic values. Apart\nfrom their widespread use in the semantics for logical systems, work\nhas continued on using impossible worlds for giving theories of\npsychological attitude ascriptions and of claims about meaning: see\nJago (2014) for one recent treatment of a number of issues involving\nmental content and reasoning. Impossible worlds also help in theories\nof other kinds of representations: for use in theories of impossible\nfictions, see Priest (1997) and Badura and Berto (2019).\nEpistemologists are starting to find applications for impossible\nworlds in theories of knowledge: see, for example, Melchior\n(forthcoming). And logicians are using them to model non-omniscient\nhyperintensional agents by combining impossible worlds semantics with\ndynamic epistemic logic (Bjerring and Skipper (2019); Solaki, Berto,\n& Smets forthcoming). \nGiven the limitations of Lewis-Stalnaker theories of counterfactual\nconditionals when dealing with impossible antecedents (see\n §1.1.2),\n it is natural to extend a theory of counterfactual conditionals with\nimpossible worlds: see Routley (1989), Mares (1997), Nolan (1997),\nBrogaard and Salerno (2013). Similar theories can be offered of\nindicative conditionals: see Nolan (2016b). \nImpossible worlds have also been employed to give theories of a range\nof hyperintensional phenomena in metaphysics. One early application\nwas in the theory of de re necessity, in offering a theory of\nhow it could be necessarily true that an artifact could be made of\nslightly different material, but not too different, without succumbing\nto Chisolm’s paradox (Salmon 1984). Impossible worlds can be\nused to give a hyperintensional theory of properties as sets of\npossible and impossible instances (Nolan 2013: 8). They can be used to\noffer a theory of metaphysical explanation (Kment 2014), or in a\ntheory of essence (Brogaard & Salerno 2013: 646–8). They can\nplay a central role in a theory of omissions of impossibilities\n(Bernstein 2016). \nThe literature to date has only scratched the surface of potential\napplications of impossible words in metaphysical theorizing. A range\nof concerns about postulating impossible worlds are discussed in the\nentry on\n impossible worlds, section 6,\n Nolan (2013), and Berto and Jago (2019), as well as the concerns\ndiscussed in\n §2\n and\n §3\n above. \nOne should look at the SEP entry on\n relevance logic\n (also called “relevant logic”) for an introduction to\nthis research program (see the seminal Anderson & Belnap 1975;\nAnderson, Belnap, & Dunn 1992; and, for a comprehensive\nintroduction, Dunn & Restall 2002). We briefly discuss its\nconnections to hyperintensionality here. Its origins lay in the aim to\ndevelop logical systems free from the “paradoxes of the material\nand strict conditional” discussed above. Another early\nmotivation was to construct a conditional that could represent logical\ndeducibility within the logical language itself. \nIn this program, an agreed upon necessary (though, in general, not\nsufficient) condition for a conditional to be logically valid is that\nthere be some connection between antecedent and consequent.\nHistorically, this has often been phrased via a requirement called the\nVariable Sharing Property (VSP): \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is valid\nonly when \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) share some sentential variable or parameter\n(cf. Anderson & Belnap 1975: 32–3). VSP delivers\nhyperintensional distinctions: conditionals with (classically)\nimpossible antecedents and necessary consequents are not all trivially\nvalid or true. The infamous ex falso quodlibet, \\((A \\land\n\\neg A) \\rightarrow B\\), for instance, fails (it’s not the case\nthat anything is implied by a contradiction); whereas \\((A \\land \\neg\nA) \\rightarrow A\\) holds in most mainstream relevant systems\n(plausibly, a conjunction relevantly implies its conjuncts). \nA key feature of relevance logics, made apparent by their most\ndeveloped semantics, the so-called Routley-Meyer frames (Routley &\nMeyer 1973), is that hyperintensional distinctions are not achieved by\nsuperimposing on an essentially classical or normal modal logic a\nfilter that screens out irrelevancies. Relevance logics are weaker\nthan normal modal logics with SPWS or Kripke frames because their\nsemantics embeds points of evaluation for formulas different from\nclassical (maximally consistent) possible worlds, which are accessible\n(via a ternary accessibility relation, different from the\nbinary accessibility of Kripke frames) in the evaluation of\nconditionals. \nWorking out the intuitive interpretation of such points, of the\nternary relation, and indeed of the Routley-Mayer semantics as a\nwhole, has been a difficult task in the history of this research\nprogramme (see Copeland 1980; Read 1988; Restall 1996b; Mares 2004).\nThe consensus on the points nowadays seems to be that they be\nunderstood as non-normal or logically impossible worlds (see Priest\n2008: Ch, 10; Berto & Jago 2019: Ch. 6). See the SEP entry on\n impossible worlds\n for details. The impossible worlds of (the interpreted) Routley-Meyer\nframes can be seen as situations which can, e.g., be locally\ninconsistent (making true both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\), for some \\(A)\\)\nwithout thereby being trivial (making true everything), and partial or\nlocally incomplete (“taking no stance” on some \\(A\\) by\nmaking true neither it nor its negation). \nThe conditional of most mainstream relevant systems is taken as\nrepresenting implication or (necessary) entailment, not a ceteris\nparibus or counterfactual conditional. But some of the first\ntheories of counterpossible conditionals, addressing the limitations\nof the Lewis/Stalnaker account of counterfactuals, were developed\nagainst a relevance logic background: see Routley (1989); Mares and\nFuhrmann (1995), and Mares (1997). \nOther applications of relevance logic to areas where hyperintensional\ndistinctions seem needed include applications to the theory of\nconfirmation in science (Goddard 1977; Sylvan & Nola 1991); the\nlogic of fiction (Routley 1979); and the theory of information (Mares\n2004; Dunn 2015). Finally, a number of theories in deontic logic have\nbeen offered using a relevance logic base, including Anderson (1967),\nGoble (1999) and Tagawa and Cheng (2002). \nRelevance logic has also been deployed to give theories of\nworldly hyperintensionality. In a series of papers, Michael\nDunn developed a theory of relevant predication intended to\nilluminate a range of traditional metaphysical distinctions, including\nthe differences between intrinsic and extrinsic properties, essential\nand accidental properties, and between essential properties and\nproperties necessarily had when an object exists (Dunn 1987, 1990a,\n1990b). And as mentioned above, Restall (1996a) employed relevant\nlogic to offer a theory of truthmakers. \nOverall, the tools provided by the relevance logic program offer\ntheoretical resources for constructing theories of hyperintensional\nphenomena, whether representational or non-representational. To date,\nmany of these proposals have been piece-meal, with less of a general\nstory about how these techniques could be applied to handle\nhyperintensional language across the board. Some general strategies\nhave been outlined for how a theory could be constructed that handles\nall hyperintensional phenomena: one such program was Richard\nRoutley’s “Ultralogic as Universal”, first set out\nin Routley (1977). See Nolan (2018) and the essays in Routley (2019)\nfor recent evaluations. \nAfter Soames’ (1987) attack against unstructured accounts of\npropositions as sets of truth-supporting circumstances, structured\npropositions accounts (King 1995) have become the main rivals to SPWS\nviews. Roughly: propositions are taken as structures, composed of the\nentities which are the semantic values of the corresponding\nsentences’ syntactic constituents. Take “Robin loves\nBatman”. It’s composed of a noun, “Robin”, and\na verb phrase, “loves Batman”, itself made of a verb and a\nnoun. Let the semantic values of the lexical items be: [Robin],\n[Batman], [loving]. Then the corresponding proposition can be\ntaken as an ordered triple \\(\\langle\\)[Robin], [loving],\n[Batman]\\(\\rangle\\). Ordering is important: Batman may not return the\nfeeling, and “Batman loves Robin” expresses a different\nproposition: \\(\\langle\\)[Batman], [loving],\n[Robin]\\(\\rangle\\). (A proposition is not just an ordered\nlist, but we leave aside the difficult metaphysical issue of what ties\nits constituents together: see Gaskin 2008.) \nWhat makes for the constituents? Broadly Russellian\nstructured accounts, developed by authors like Salmon (1986), Soames\n(2008), are typically paired with direct reference or Millian accounts\nof names: thus, [Batman] is Batman and [Robin] is Robin. The semantic\nvalues of predicates and verb phrases can be taken as properties or\nrelations. The logical vocabulary is typically interpreted as denoting\nlogical operations, e.g., [\\({\\sim}\\)] can be the unary function that\nflips truth and falsity, [\\land] the binary function that outputs\ntruth only if both inputs are truths, etc. \nThis delivers hyperintensional distinctions, e.g., “John is\neither a bachelor or not” and “Either 44 is the sum of two\nprimes or not” will express different propositions: only one\nwill include [John], i.e., John, as a constituent. Necessarily\ntrue/false atomic sentences will also be differentiated, even when\ntheir syntactic structure is the same (“Hobbes squared the\ncircle” and “Daniel Nolan squared the circle”:\n[Daniel Nolan] isn’t [Hobbes]; “\\(3 + 3 = 6\\)” and\n“\\(2 + 2 = 4\\)”: [3] isn’t [2]). More challenging\ncases for the view come with the necessary a posteriori.\n“Mike is Mike” and “Mike is Jack the Ripper”\nexpress the same proposition, because [Mike] = [Jack the Ripper]. Same\nfor “All woodchucks are woodchucks”, “All woodchucks\nare whistlepigs”, as [woodchuck] = [whistlepig]. This will\ncreate issues in intentional contexts: \nSuppose Tama is familiar with both woodchucks and whistlepigs, but\nisn’t sure that they are the same kind of critter. He’s\nnoticed the similarities, though, and so he has his suspicions.\nSuppose further that Tama knows he is allergic to whistlepigs, and\nknows that he has just been bitten by a woodchuck. In this scenario,\n[“Tama fears that all woodchucks are whistlepigs”] is\nlikely true, while [“Tama fears that all woodchucks are\nwoodchucks”] is almost certainly false. (Ripley 2012: 9) \nSoames (1987) proposes a pragmatic-metalinguistic strategy similar to\nthe one tried by Stalnaker (1984), discussed in\n §2.2:\n one should distinguish attitudes towards sentences and towards\npropositions. Soames comes up with examples showing that the former\ncan be an unreliable guide to the latter, e.g., one can sometimes\nbelieve a proposition, but only assent to one of two distinct\nsentences expressing it. You do know that Mike is Jack the\nRipper by knowing that Mike is Mike, for it’s the same\nproposition. But you will assent to, or assert, only the sentence that\nreports your knowledge in the trivial clothing. Then, the ancients\nbelieved that Hesperus is Phosphorus, Tama fears that all woodchucks\nare woodchucks, and so on. If you think otherwise, it’s because\nyou confuse belief reports with reports of linguistic practices.\nRipley (2012) argues that it’s difficult to account for\nphenomena concerning such attitude reports by throwing them in the box\nof pragmatics and conversational implicatures: failures of\nsubstitutivity salva veritate behave in systematics ways in\ncontexts of iterated embeddings, and this calls for a systematic,\ncompositional treatment. \nSalmon also resorts to a distinction between “semantically\nencoded” and “pragmatically imparted information”\n(Salmon 1986: 78) for the “Mike is Mike” vs. “Mike\nis Jack the Ripper” cases. He introduces different\nrepresentational guises under which one can have attitudes to the\nproposition expressed by different sentences. For direct reference to\nwork, we need [Mike] to be [Jack the Ripper], but we can allow\nMike-guises to differ from Jack-the-Ripper-guises, and claim that\n(de dicto) intentional attitudes are relations to\npropositions mediated by guises: Lois Lane loves Kal-El under the\nguise of Superman, not under the guise of Clark Kent. Guises\ndon’t belong in semantics but in pragmatics, and don’t\ndetermine denotations. \nSalmon’s view can in principle account for compositional\nphenomena involving embeddings. It has been criticized because of\nthis: Forbes (1987) argues that guises look too much like Fregean\nsenses in disguise. Branquinho (1990) argues that the correspondence\nmay not reduce Salmon’s account to a relabelled Fregean\nview. \nGuises are supposed to be mobilized within attitude reports. Beyond\nattitude reports, as argued by Ripley (2012), Jago (2014), there are\nhyperintensional phenomena involving indicative and counterfactual\nconditionals structuralism doesn’t seem to handle. As Jago\n(2014: 76–7) has it, we can be at the 1972 Ziggy Stardust Tour\nand wonder if Ziggy is David Bowie. We come up with the following: \nAll of (1)–(4) have metaphysically impossible antecedents. (1)\nand (3) are plausibly false (unless one is a vacuist: see Williamson\n2007), but (2) and (4) are trivial truths. (A nonvacuist conditional\nsemantics using impossible worlds delivers just these results: see\nBerto et al. 2018.) But the structuralist has (1)–(2) and\n(3)–(4), respectively, express the same propositions, given that\n[Ziggy] = [Bowie]. If conditionals in general, or even only\ncounterfactuals, don’t involve intentionality, guises will offer\nlittle help if they are not supposed to come into play here. However,\nthere are treatments of conditionality along the lines of epistemic\nmodals (Kratzer 1986; Lycan 2001), and the Russellian structuralist\nmay appeal to one of them, or come up with a new one. \nCould a broadly Fregean account of structured propositions do\nbetter? In this view, we don’t take the constituents of\nstructured propositions as denotations (think objects and properties),\nrather as Fregean senses. Much now depends on how these are\nunderstood. If they are taken à la Carnap, as functions from\nthe possible worlds of SPWS to extensions, there is little hope to\naccount for “Mike is Mike” vs. “Mike is Jack the\nRipper” cases. Now [Mike] and [Jack the Ripper] are functions\nfrom possible worlds to individuals; but unless one clashes with the\nKripkean criticisms of descriptivism on names (Kripke 1980), they had\nbetter be constant functions: given that they both actually pick out\nMike, they should output Mike at all possible worlds (at which Mike\nexists). But then [Mike] and [Jack the Ripper] will be defined on the\nsame set of things and will give the same output for any input. \nOne may enlarge or change the set of circumstances that provides the\ninputs, admitting metaphysically impossible situations where Mike is\ndistinct from Jack the Ripper, and have the two as the outputs of\n[Mike] and [Jack the Ripper] there, respectively. But then, as\nremarked by Ripley (2012) and Jago (2014) again, it is not so much\nstructuralism that does the job of giving the required\nhyperintensional distinctions, but rather the fact that we are not\nworking (only) with standard (metaphysically) possible worlds\nanymore. \nA recent interesting proposal to improve on the Fregean situation\ncomes from Hawke (2018), combining a theory of subject matter with a\nstructuralist account of propositions resorting to\nFregean-senses-lookalikes. Subject matter sensitivity allows Hawke to\nmake hyperintensional distinction unavailable to standard Fregean\nstructuralism. \nOne logically sophisticated, neo-Fregean structured account, offering\na systematic analysis of a range of hyperintensional phenomena, is the\nTransparent Intensional Logic approach. The view, pioneered\nby Tichý (1968, 1971, 1988), treats the meanings of expressions\nas given by structural procedures, called constructions,\nbuilt out of entities that are somewhat like Fregean senses. In\nparticular, different names and different predicates, even if they\nnecessarily co-designate, may be associated with different senses, so\nthe meanings of “Robin Hood” and “Robin of\nLocksley”, or of “furze” and “gorse”,\nmay be distinct even if those meanings are not built up out of others.\nThis gives the system resources to handle many hyperintensional\ncontexts straightforwardly. In particular, it manages to give a\npowerful compositional account where other approaches have to resort\nto pragmatics. The approach is less popular than it should be in\ncontemporary semantics, possibly due its resorting to a technical\napparatus of typed lambda-calculus. For hyperintensional applications\nand a comprehensive discussion of Transparent Intensional Logic, see\nDuží, Jespersen, and Materna (2010) and Duží\nand Jespersen (2015). \nWe mention one final, recent proposal in the Fregean camp, by Skipper\nand Bjerring (2020). This pivots on another Fregean notion, namely\nthat of cognitive equipollence: \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are\ncognitively equipollent when one cannot rationally regard either as\ntrue and the other as false (see Schellenberg 2012). This gives a\ncognitive or epistemic notion of sentential meaning which, the authors\nclaim, is more fine-grained than SPWS intensions, but less than\nextra-fine-grained extended (e.g., impossible) worlds semantics. \nA final family of approaches to hyperintensionality to be discussed is\nthe algebraic. Algebraic approaches to semantics typically do not try\nto give an account of meaning in terms of anything else at all.\nInstead, they treat meanings as primitive and focus on the\nrelationships between them to give a semantic theory. \nBy defining in a direct way how the meanings of different parts of\nlanguage go together to yield sentence meanings, these approaches are\nnot under pressure to identify the meanings of sentences true in all\nthe same possible circumstances, or even sentences which are logically\nequivalent. So it is easy to see how a general algebraic approach can\nmake room for hyperintensional differences between parts of language.\nEven if sentence meanings are necessarily equivalent, if they relate\ndifferently to a “believes that” operator they do not have\nto be substitutable in “John believes that \\(A\\)”\ncontexts. Bealer (1979) touts this flexibility as an advantage in\ndealing with puzzles like the semantics of belief attributions, as\ndoes Menzel (1993). \nSome algebraic approaches do not take as much advantage of this\nflexibility as one might expect with respect to hyperintensionality\npuzzles. Keenan and Faltz (1984)’s algebraic approach identifies\nnecessary equivalents. Bacon (2018) adopts a Boolean account in which\nthe propositions associated with logical equivalents in predicate\nlogic are identified with each other (e.g., the proposition that\n\\({\\sim}({\\sim}A \\lor {\\sim}B)\\) is identical to the proposition that\n\\((A \\land B))\\). This leaves room for distinguishing merely\nnecessarily equivalent propositions, e.g., the proposition that\n\\(2+2=4\\) and the proposition that it rains if and only if it rains.\nBut it does little to help with cases where we want to discriminate\nbetween logical equivalents: if we were to think that \\(A\\) explains\nwhy \\({\\sim}{\\sim}A\\), or capture the belief content of the confused\nman who believes something of the form \\((A \\land B)\\) but does not\nbelieve \\({\\sim}({\\sim}A \\lor {\\sim}B)\\). So it is not the algebraic\napproach per se that yields solutions to particular puzzles\nabout hyperintensionality, but the algebraic approach combined with\ntheoretical choices about the structure of the algebra. \nAlgebraic approaches are largely silent on the question of what\nmeanings are, and how meanings come to stand in the relations they do.\n(Or, if every structure of relations between meanings can be found\nsomewhere in Platonic heaven, how we come to be associated with our\nparticular structure rather than others.) Of course, theories which\nsay more about the nature of meanings (e.g., that they are\nset-theoretic constructions from worlds, or they are ordered sets of\nobjects and properties) also face the challenge of explaining\nhow our concrete practices explain which structures of meanings are\nassociated with our speech and writing. So it may be that these\nconcerns are general, and algebraic semantics can employ the same\nkinds of answers to these questions as their rivals. \nA close relative of algebraic theories is the object theory of Zalta\n(1988). It also supplies distinct fine-grained meanings to, e.g., be\nthe suitably distinct inputs so that “John believes all\ntriangles have internal angles that add up to 180°” and\n“John believes all trilaterals have internal angles that add up\nto 180°” express different propositions. Zalta says a little\nmore about the identity conditions of his\nhyperintensionally-distinguished properties: according to Zalta,\nproperties are identical if and only if they are encoded by\nthe same objects. \nAlgebraic accounts of meaning may have little to say about worldly\nhyperintensionality. There is nothing in the general motivations of\nalgebraic theories that would rule out the hypothesis that we need\nhyperintensional language to best capture the non-representational\naspects of reality, but nor does there appear to be anything in the\ngeneral motivations that would indicate why we would, or how that\nmight manifest in our language. This is not really an objection to\nalgebraic approaches, however. One might think that a theory of\nmeaning should be silent on substantive questions about what\nthe world is like. We do not want our theory of meaning to tell us\nwhich physics or chemical theory to adopt. Likewise, it might be good\nfor a theory of meaning to be neutral about how to understand\nessences, or intrinsicness of properties, or causation. Of course, a\ntheory of meaning may not be able to be completely neutral about\nmetaphysical questions—it should have something to say about\nwhat meanings are, whether there are abstract representations, and so\non—but perhaps algebraic theories not taking a stand on worldly\nhyperintensionality is an attractive feature rather than a\ndrawback.","contact.mail":"fb96@st-andrews.ac.uk","contact.domain":"st-andrews.ac.uk"},{"date.published":"2021-02-08","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hyperintensionality/","author1":"Francesco Berto","author1.info":"http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/philosophy/people/fb96","author2.info":"https://sites.google.com/site/professordanielnolan/","entry":"hyperintensionality","body.text":"\n\n\nA hyperintensional concept draws a distinction between\nnecessarily equivalent contents. If the concept is expressed by an\noperator, \\(H\\), then \\(H\\) is hyperintensional insofar as \\(HA\\) and\n\\(HB\\) can differ in truth value in spite of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)’s\nbeing necessarily equivalent. Necessary equivalence of claims is\nstandardly understood in terms of possible worlds (ways things could\nhave been): \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are necessarily equivalent when they are\ntrue at the same worlds. This is sometimes put in terms of sentences\nsharing an intension. An extensional operator (e.g.,\nBoolean negation) allows substitution salva veritate of\nsentences with the same extension, that is, truth value: if \\(A\\) has\nthe same truth value as \\(B\\), then also \\({\\sim}A\\) has the same\ntruth value as \\({\\sim}B\\). An intensional operator (e.g.,\nthe box of necessity) allows substitution salva veritate of\nsentences that express necessary equivalents: if \\(A\\) is necessarily\nequivalent to \\(B\\), then \\(\\Box A\\) has the same truth value as\n\\(\\Box B\\). The expression “hyperintensional” is thus for\nan \\(H\\) that defies substitution salva veritate even of\nexpressions with the same intension.\n\n\nCresswell (1975) introduced the expression\n“hyperintensional” to pick out a position in a sentence\nwhere substitution fails for logical equivalents. Nowadays the term is\nused more broadly, with unrestrictedly necessary equivalence replacing\nlogical equivalence. Candidates for unrestricted necessity often\ninclude, besides the logical, mathematical and metaphysical necessity.\nWe don’t discuss whether one of these is reducible to the\nothers—e.g., the mathematical to the logical, as claimed by\nlogicists.\n\n\nHyperintensionality is pervasive. Take two claims on your prospects of\ngetting a job you may apply for:\n\n(1)\nYou have 40% chances of succeeding.\n(2)\nYou have 60% chances of failing.\n\nThese are necessarily equivalent. However, psychological studies on\nframing effects (Tversky & Kahneman 1981; Kahneman 2011) show that\npeople are more prone to believe in a positive outcome when presented\nwith (1) than with (2), thus more likely to apply. Belief\nseems sensitive to hyperintensional distinctions: we can come to\nbelieve different things depending on how necessarily equivalent\noptions are presented to us (Berto 2019). Framing has vast societal\nimpacts (Thaler & Sunstein 2008).\n\n\nOn to your neighbor Mike:\n\n(3)\nMike is Mike.\n(4)\nMike is Jack the Ripper.\n\n(3) is necessarily true. Suppose (4) is true. If “Jack the\nRipper” works as a proper name, (4) is necessarily true, too\n(Barcan Marcus 1947; Kripke 1980). Thus, (3) and (4) are necessarily\nequivalent. But (3) is uninformative (you already knew things are\nself-identical), whereas learning (4) could save your life.\nInformation, this fundamental concept of our age, also seems\nto display hyperintensional features. The difference between (3) and\n(4) is marked by saying that you can know (3), not (4), a\npriori. The concept of a priori, then, has\nhyperintensional features too.\n\n\nQuine and Davidson’s idea that serious philosophy should use\nonly extensional notions faded in the latter half of the twentieth\ncentury, which witnessed an intensional revolution: a collective\neffort to analyze notions which are fundamental for our understanding\nof the world and of ourselves, like belief, information,\nknowledge, meaning, content, essence, explanation, via a single\ntheoretical system: employing possible worlds and constructions out of\nthem. Standard possible worlds semantics (SPWS) found applications in\nlogic, linguistics, game theory, artificial intelligence: a success\nstory of philosophy. However, many of these phenomena (and, more: a\nsurvey in\n Section 1)\n are, arguably, hyperintensional, requiring hyperintensional language\nto do them justice. And SPWS tends to collapse any distinctions more\nfine-grained than necessary equivalence. The issue of how best to\naddress hyperintensionality has emerged in piecemeal fashion, via a\nseries of difficulties of SPWS (in\n Section 1,\n we list a few). Some have denied that hyperintensionality marks a set\nof real phenomena and have tried to explain away hyperintensional\nintuitions. Some of these general attempts are discussed in\n Section 2.\n \n\nEven if genuinely hyperintensional language is accepted into our\nphilosophical theorizing, this leaves many further issues open. One\npressing one is the question of “just ‘how hyper’\nhyperintensions are” (Jespersen & Duží 2015:\n527): what new distinctions should our theorizing recognize beyond\nnecessary equivalence? The mathematical structure of the realm of\nhyperintensionality is not well understood yet. We come to this in\n Section 3.\n However, the early twenty-first century is seeing a hyperintensional\nrevolution (Nolan 2014), with different general approaches currently\nbeing developed, which qualify as hyperintensional in some sense. We\nprovide a critical survey in\n Section 4,\n where we also assess the approaches in terms of how they fare with\nrespect to hyperintensional phenomena singled out in previous\nSections.\n\nWe provide a taxonomy of candidate hyperintensional notions by\ndividing them into two camps: (1) representational concepts\npertain to ways of representing the world (1a) in thought and (1b) in\nlanguage. In the former sub-camp (1a), we find mental states or\nactivities like believing, knowing, imagining, conceiving,\nbeing or becoming informed. In the latter sub-camp\n(1b), notions such as meaning, content, and\nconditionality. (2) Non-representational\nhyperintensional concepts include allegedly mind-independent,\n“worldly” notions such as essence, grounding,\nmetaphysical dependence, explanation. \n(The division is not uncontroversial, e.g., some claim that\nexplanation and indicative conditionals essentially involve cognition\n(Lycan 2001), so they would place them in (1a). Some claim that there\nexists “environmental” information (Barwise & Seligman\n1997) that should go into (2). We stick to what we take to be\nmainstream views on where such concepts should go.) \nFor each of these notions, we provide (a) a brief explanation of how\nthey have been dealt with in SPWS; and (b) examples illustrating their\nseemingly hyperintensional nature. These, if found persuasive, may\nwork as data against which the theories described in\n Section 4\n can be evaluated with respect to their hyperintensional aims. \nPerhaps the most plausible hyperintensional environment is the realm\nof intentional concepts: notions that involve states of the\nmind which are directed towards contents, situations, etc. The two\nmost studied such notions are knowledge and belief. Since Hintikka\n(1962), these have been understood in epistemic logic as modal\noperators: restricted quantifiers over possible worlds. Knowledge and\nbelief are characterized in terms of what is true throughout a set of\nworlds which represent ways things could be, for all the cognitive\nagent knows, or given the agent’s evidence, etc. If \\(K\\)\nexpresses the agent’s knowledge or belief state, \\(w\\) is a\npossible world, and \\(R\\) an epistemic accessibility relation on the\nspace of worlds \\(W\\), the Hintikkan characterization goes: \nSome views in mainstream epistemology follow the same path, e.g., in\nrelevant alternatives approaches knowledge is “an\nevidential state in which all relevant alternatives (to what is known)\nare eliminated” (Dretske 1981: 367). Uneliminated alternatives\nwork similarly to accessible worlds. \nSuch treatments of knowledge and belief witnessed an early\nmanifestation of the hyperintensionality issue: the problem of\nlogical omniscience (Fagin et al. 1995: 335–6)—a set\nof closure conditions for the relevant \\(K\\)s, of which perhaps the\nmost important are: \n(C1), often dubbed Closure under entailment or Full\nomniscience, has it that one knows or believes all the logical\nconsequences of what one knows or believes. (C2), Knowledge of all\nvalidities or Belief in all validities, has it that one\nknows or believes all logical truths. (C3) ensures the consistency of\nknowledge or belief. All follow from understanding \\(K\\) as a\nquantifier over worlds, as per (H). (C1): if \\(A\\)’s entailing\n\\(B\\) is understood in terms of all \\(A\\)-worlds’ being\n\\(B\\)-worlds (in all the relevant models), and given that \\(KA\\) means\nthat \\(A\\) is true at all the epistemically accessible worlds, \\(B\\)\nwill be true there, too, and so \\(KB\\) will hold. (C2): if\n\\(A\\)’s being logically valid is understood as its holding at\nall worlds (of all the relevant models), then it will hold at all the\nepistemically accessible ones, and so \\(KA\\) will hold. (C3): no\npossible world, thus no accessible one, will make both \\(A\\) and\n\\({\\sim}A\\) true. \nThese don’t sound right for real humans, as opposed to\nidealized, logically infallible agents. (C1): we know basic arithmetic\ntruths like Peano’s postulates, and these entail (suppose)\nGoldbach’s Conjecture (Every even whole number larger than 2 is\nthe sum of two primes); but we don’t know whether\nGoldbach’s Conjecture is true. (C2): “If\n\\({\\sim}{\\sim}A\\), then \\(A\\)” is (suppose) valid, but\nintuitionist logicians do not believe it. (C3): we can have, if\nimplicitly, inconsistent beliefs. \nOne may treat “\\(KA\\)” in (H) as not really standing for\nknowledge or belief. We should read it as “\\(A\\) follows\nlogically from the agent’s knowledge”, or “The agent\nis committed to \\(A\\), given what it knows/believes”. Then we\nstill lack some logical account of knowledge and\nbelief per se, as opposed to some derivative attitude or\nconditional commitment. The commitment itself may be questioned: are\nwe committed to believing everything, given that we have inconsistent\nbeliefs? In what sense must a finite agent believe infinitely many\nlogical consequences? Such a “must” lacks a corresponding\n“can”. \nInformation received a modal treatment in the classic\nBar-Hillel and Carnap (1952) account. The informative task of a\nsentence \\(A\\) is to split the totality of worlds into those where\n\\(A\\) is true and those where it isn’t. An agent’s\nbecoming informed of \\(A\\) is its ruling out the not\\(-A\\) worlds as\ncontenders for actuality: before being informed that it’s\nraining outside, for all you knew, it might have been raining or not.\nAfter you are informed, you can rule out all the non-rainy worlds. \nBut now, “If Kennedy was shot, then Kennedy was shot” and\n“\\(x^n + y^n = z^n\\) has no integer solutions for \\(n \\gt\n2\\)” are necessarily equivalent, given the unrestricted\nnecessity of logical and mathematical truths, and SPWS. They are true\nat the same worlds: all of them. On the Bar-Hillel-Carnap view, one\ncan rule out no world after learning either. But while one easily\ndeems the former true, the latter, which expresses Fermat’s Last\nTheorem, took centuries to be proved and its proof brought significant\nnews. \nGeneralizing: a merely intensional analysis of information entails\nthat no logical, mathematical, or metaphysical necessary\ntruth can ever be informative and denies the informativeness of\nlogical deduction. But logical deductions are informative (Jago 2009,\n2014). Besides, we can become informed of exactly one of two\nnecessarily equivalent claims. Of necessity, “All woodchucks are\nwoodchucks” is true if and only if “All woodchucks are\nwhistle-pigs” is (Ripley 2012). But the former is trivial,\nwhereas one may learn the latter from a zoologist. \nOther attitudes like hoping, fearing, supposing, imagining\ndisplay hyperintensional features (Wansing 2017). One may be led to\nthe general conclusion that thought is hyperintensional: our\nintentional states can treat necessarily equivalent contents\ndifferently. Lois Lane can wish that Superman is in love with her\nwithout wishing that Clark Kent is in love with her, although (if\nBarcan Marcus and Kripke are right) it is impossible for Superman to\nbe other than Clark Kent. We can suppose that \\(75 \\times 12 = 900\\)\nwithout supposing Fermat’s Last Theorem. Even intentional states\ninvolving perceptual experiences, like seeing, seem\nhyperintensional: you can see that Mary is eating an ice cream without seeing\nthat Mary is eating an ice cream and John is either eating chips or\nnot (you may not be seeing John at all). But \\(A\\) is logically\nequivalent to \\(A \\land (B \\lor {\\sim}B)\\) in classical logic and even\nin many weaker logics (Barwise & Perry 1983). \nPropositions, taken as the contents or meanings of sentences, have\noften been interpreted starting from Wittgenstein’s insight that\nunderstanding a sentence is knowing what is the case if it is true\n(Wittgenstein 1921: 4.024). Truth conditions have been given via sets\nof possible worlds in the SPWS approaches of Montague (1970),\nStalnaker (1976) and many others: the proposition expressed by\n“St Andrews is rainy” is the set of worlds where St\nAndrews is rainy. \nThis makes all necessarily equivalent propositions identical, for\npossible worlds can never disagree on them. “If Kennedy was\nshot, then Kennedy was shot” and “\\(x^n + y^n = z^n\\) has\nno integer solutions for \\(n \\gt 2\\)” mean the same thing: the\ntotal set of worlds. This seems wrong, given that they don’t say\nthe same thing: only one speaks about Diophantine equations. Similarly\nfor necessary falsehoods: “Kennedy was both shot and not”\nand “\\(2 + 3 = 6\\)” are about different things, but they\nalso end up expressing the same proposition: the empty set. \nWe can locate in the area of semantic concepts hyperintensional\nphenomena which have to do with conditionality. We start with\nindicative conditionals. The extensional material conditional,\n“\\(\\supset\\)”, validates notoriously paradoxical\ninferences: \nIf the horseshoe captures the meaning of the indicative\n“if”, lots of bad-sounding conditionals from ordinary\nlanguage come out true just because the antecedent is false or the\nconsequent true: “If Clinton is Australian, then Mars is made of\nmarbles”; “If Strasbourg is in Germany, then Clinton is\nAmerican”. \nOne may think the issue is that the connection between antecedent and\nconsequent is too contingent an affair here. One may require, for\n“If \\(A\\), then \\(B\\)” to be true, that it cannot be the\ncase that the antecedent is true while the consequent is false. This\ngives the so-called strict conditional: a modal operator,\n“\\(\\prec\\)”, such that “\\(A \\prec B\\)” is\nunderstood as “At any possible world where \\(A\\) is true, \\(B\\)\nis true”. \nThis has its paradoxes, too. Where “\\(\\Box A\\)” means that\n\\(A\\) is true at all possible worlds, and “\\(\\Diamond A\\)”\nmeans that \\(A\\) is true at some, we get: \nWhen \\(A\\) is true at no possible world, or \\(B\\) is true at all,\nthere is no way for \\(A\\) to be true while \\(B\\) is false and so\n“\\(A \\prec B\\)” is true. If the strict conditional\ncaptures the meaning of the indicative “if”, lots of bad\nconditionals come out true: “If \\(6 + 3 = 11\\), then Clinton is\nAustralian”; “If Clinton is American, then \\(6 + 3 =\n9\\)”. These are not obviously true, and there are some reasons\nto suppose they are false: there is no connection between antecedent\nand consequent, for example. Other conditional forms that the strict\nconditional validates but which are disputable include: \nAs an instance of (6), take “If Mars is made of marbles, then\neither St Andrews is in Scotland, or it isn’t”: the\nmaterial constitution of Mars has little to do with St Andrews’\nlocation. Some theorists argue that treatments of the conditional that\ndo not render conditionals like these automatically true would be\npreferable. \nOn to counterfactuals or subjunctive conditionals—conditionals\nof the form, “If it were (had been) the case that \\(A\\), then it\nwould be (have been) the case that \\(B\\)”. A common treatment,\ndue to Stalnaker (1968) and Lewis (1973), analyses them in terms of\npossible worlds. In a simple version, they are true just in case at\nthe closest worlds where \\(A\\) is true, \\(B\\) is true, where closeness\nis understood as similarity in relevant respects. “If Kangaroos\nhad no tails, they would topple over” is true when, at all\nworlds where kangaroos have no tails and which are as relevantly\nsimilar as it gets to the actual world, kangaroos topple over. \nThis again makes all counterfactuals whose consequent is necessary, or\nwhose antecedent is impossible, vacuously true: there are no worlds to\nfalsify the consequent, or to verify the antecedent. Counterfactuals\nwith impossible antecedents are called counterpossibles. They\ndon’t seem to be all vacuously true. An often-cited example from\nNolan (1997): \nSquaring the circle is a mathematical impossibility, in spite of\nHobbes’ hopes. His achieving it, though, would have made no\ndifference for those sick children. (9) should come out true for this\nreason, not because no possible world verifies the antecedent. For\nsimilar reasons, (8) should come out false. Against vacuism, some\ncounterpossible pairs with opposite consequents should have different\ntruth values (for a defense of vacuism, see Williamson 2007; for a\ndiscussion, see Berto et al. 2018). \nHyperintensionality was initially tied to representation: Cresswell\n(1975) discussed a semantics for a formal language where substitution\nof logical equivalents fails in intentional contexts (he mentioned\n“says that”, “knows that”, “believes\nthat”, “deduces that”: 1975: 37). Other cases\ndiscussed above might contribute to the impression that our language\ncontains hyperintensional expressions just because of phenomena\ninvolving representation. \nHowever, various philosophers have employed hyperintensional resources\nto theorize about aspects of the world beyond representation.\nFamously, Fine (1994) argues that work on the essences of\nthings must play a central role in metaphysics and essence talk must\nbe hyperintensional. In the construction “\\(x\\) is essentially\n\\(F\\)”, we cannot be guaranteed to preserve truth by\nsubstituting necessarily equivalent predicates. Socrates is (suppose)\nessentially human, but not essentially (human and a member of a set),\nalthough necessarily someone is human if and only if they are human\nand a member of a set. Fine extends this to talk of real definition\ngenerally: it is the real definition of 2 that it is the successor of\n1, but not the real definition of 2 that it is \\(10-8\\), even though\n“the successor of 1” and “\\(10-8\\)”\nnecessarily have the same extension. (These examples are not in Fine\n1994, but we take it he would endorse them given his discussion on pp.\n4–5 and p 14.) Dunn (1990b) also argues that one needs\nhyperintensional resources (in his case, from relevant logic) to\ncapture essentialist claims. \nNolan (2014) argues for the need to provide hyperintensional accounts\nof a range of non-representational aspects of reality. As well as a\ntheory of essences, theories of counterfactuals, explanation,\nmetaphysical grounding, of the distinction between intrinsic and\nextrinsic properties, of dispositions, are all plausibly\nhyperintensional. Nolan also mentions the analysis of causation, laws\nof nature, objective confirmation, objective chance, and objective\nethics. Other recent proposals in metaphysics that have employed\nhyperintensional resources include work on truthmakers, omissions,\nmetaphysical dependence, and the distinction between qualitative and\nnon-qualitative properties. Almost any area of metaphysics where\nnecessity or counterfactuals have played a role is a candidate for\nhyperintensional approaches. We now give a flavor of hyperintensional\ntheories of some of these topics. \nThe hyperintensionality of counterfactuals has been discussed above.\nDoes their truth depend in the right kind of way on facts beyond our\nrepresentational abilities? Nolan (2014: 156) argues that it sometimes\ndoes. Regular platonic solids come in only a handful of sizes (the\nmost sides one can have, in three-dimensional space, is 20.) Still,\nthis seems true: \nIf there were a piece of steel in the shape of a 36 sided platonic\nsolid, it would have more sides than any piece of steel in the shape\nof a dodecahedron. \nOn the other hand, \nIf there were a piece of steel in the shape of a 36 sided platonic\nsolid, it would have fewer sides than any piece of steel in the shape\nof a dodecahedron \nseems false. The truth value of these is not just settled by whether\nthe antecedent is necessary. They seem to be about pieces of steel and\nhow they relate to each other. Which blocks of steel have which shapes\nis not just about us and our representations. It would not be even if\nsteel could take shapes that it in fact cannot. \nExplanation is plausibly hyperintensional: “explains” can\nbe flanked by expressions that cannot be substituted with necessary\nequivalents salva veritate. One pure mathematical truth can\nexplain another, but not every mathematical truth explains every\nother, even if every pure mathematical truth is a necessary truth\n(Baron, Colyvan, & Ripley 2020). Schneider (2011) argues that\nsometimes logical equivalents can explain each other, making a case\nthat “because” is hyperintensional. \\({\\sim}{\\sim}A\\) is\ntrue because \\(A\\) is true, but not vice versa. If the correctness of\nexplanations turns out to depend also on how the world is, rather than\nonly on what suits our explanatory practices, these cases may be due\nto hyperintensional explanatory connections in the world. (How best to\nunderstand explanations, of course, remains a contentious\nphilosophical question.) \nMetaphysical grounding is widely regarded as hyperintensional.\nSometimes a more fundamental fact necessarily leads to a less\nfundamental fact that it grounds, but the two are merely modally\ninseparable. A widely discussed example is the grounding of the\nexistence of a set in the existence of its members. On one view,\n{Socrates, Plato} automatically exists if Socrates and Plato both\nexist, but it exists only in possible worlds where Socrates and Plato\nboth exist. So the fact that Socrates and Plato both exist grounds the\nfact that {Socrates, Plato} exists (see Dunn 1990b; Fine 1994). But\nthat {Socrates, Plato} exists is not supposed to ground the fact that\nSocrates and Plato both exist, even though necessarily one obtains\nonly if the other does. On an attractive account, many complex logical\ntruths are grounded in simpler ones. \\({\\sim}{\\sim}A\\) is grounded in\n\\(A, (A \\land A)\\), is grounded in \\(A\\), and many other logical\nequivalents of \\(A\\) are grounded in \\(A\\), though they are not the\nsame proposition as \\(A\\). And as before, while \\((A \\land A)\\) is\ngrounded in \\(A, A\\) is not grounded in \\((A \\land A)\\) (see\nPoggiolesi 2018, 2020 for a formal logic of grounding). \nWhether grounding is indeed hyperintensional may depend on how\ngrounding claims are best understood. Where “…\ngrounds…” is a sentential operator, the cases discussed\nhad best be captured hyperintensionally. “(Socrates and Plato\nboth exist) grounds (The set {Socrates, Plato} exists)”, for\nexample. Things may work differently if we take “…\ngrounds…” as a two-place predicate applying to facts or\noccurrences: “The fact that Socrates and Plato both exist\ngrounds the fact that {Socrates, Plato} exists” expresses a\nrelation between two objects, and we might be able to preserve the\ntruth of this statement by substitution of any other ways of referring\nto each of those objects. One complication is that one might take\nthese expressions picking out facts to themselves have constituents\ndesignating propositions: “the fact that Socrates and Plato both\nexist” may have the logical form the fact that A, where\nthat \\(A\\) is the proposition that Socrates and Plato exist.\nInterpreted that way, the expression is functioning hyperintensionally\nafter all, since the necessarily equivalent proposition that\n{Socrates, Plato} exists cannot be substituted into that expression\nwithout changing the truth-value of the relevant grounding claims.\nFinally, one could take the primary way of expressing grounding\nrelations to be by talking about objects in general, e.g., about\nSocrates and Plato grounding the set {Socrates, Plato} (Schaffer\n2009). On this third approach it is natural to think that any other\nways of designating those objects could be substituted salva\nveritate so that the grounding-between-objects predicate is\nextensional; though see Jenkins (2011) for a hyperintensional\nobject-theoretic grounding approach that does not allow this\nsubstitution salva veritate. \nMany grounding theorists have taken the sentential operator approach\nas primary: see Fine (2001: 15–16), Schneider (2011:\n446–7). Those that do not fall on different sides of the\nquestion of whether expressing the full range of grounding claims\nrequires hyperintensional resources. See Duncan, Miller, and Norton\n(2017) for a discussion of which styles of grounding claims are best\ntreated as hyperintensional. \nThe distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic properties features in\nmany metaphysical theories, and it appears to be\nrepresentation-independent: presumably, if mass is intrinsic it would\nremain such whatever we said or did. One idea behind the distinction\nis that a property had intrinsically is had only in virtue of an\nobject’s own nature, while extrinsic properties are partly a\nmatter of how the object stands to other objects. Some have argued\nthat necessarily coextensive properties can differ in whether they are\nintrinsic or extrinsic (Dunn 1990a; Eddon 2011; Bader 2013; Marshall\n2015; Hoffmann-Kloss 2015). Being an instance of Barak’s\nactual favorite property is plausibly extrinsic, but having a\nmass may well be intrinsic, even if mass is Barak’s\nfavorite property, and even though, given it is actually his favorite\nproperty, anything in any possible world has the first property iff it\nhas the second. The above-named philosophers disagree on how to\ncharacterize the intrinsic/extrinsic distinction, but they share the\nview that it has to be hyperintensional. \nJenkins and Nolan (2012) argue that disposition ascriptions are\nhyperintensional. Heidi the gifted mathematician may be disposed to\nfind the proof of a given conjecture, on condition that it has one.\nThis disposition of Heidi’s can be known in advance of knowing\nwhether the conjecture has a proof. (“Give this to Heidi: if\nthere’s a proof to be found, she’ll find it”.)\nSuppose the conjecture is in fact false, though the mathematical\ncommunity does not yet know that. Then the condition of the\ndisposition ascription is impossible. Still, we cannot substitute any\nimpossibility in the disposition ascription. It is plausibly false\nthat Heidi is disposed to find the proof of that conjecture, on the\ncondition that she was always both identical to the number 7 and\ninnumerate, for example. \nWe use necessarily false conditions in disposition ascriptions outside\ntalk about agents, too. Working with a model where the number of prey\nkilled is a function of the number of predators, the model might say\nadding half a fox to a closed ecosystem, or adding \\(1/\\pi\\) foxes to\nan ecosystem, produces a certain fraction of additional rabbits\nkilled. But it is impossible to have, e.g., \\(7+1/\\pi\\) foxes. Still,\nwhat the ecosystem is disposed to do on the condition \\(7+1/\\pi\\)\nfoxes are added and it is idealized in various ways is very\ndifferent from what it is disposed to do with \\(105+1/\\pi\\) foxes and\nthe same idealization. \nOne way to specify probabilities is with propositional complements:\nthe probability that it will rain tomorrow, or that this coin will\ncome up heads 10 times in a row. Take claims such as “\\(\\rP(B) =\n0.6\\)”, where the proposition that \\(B\\) is, e.g., that this\n(biased) coin will come up heads 10 times in a row. \\(\\rP\\) will be\nhyperintensional if we cannot guarantee that we preserve truth value\nby substitution of necessarily equivalent propositions. \nIf we use \\(\\rP\\) to represent the (degrees of) beliefs of an\nagent—even a logically idealized one—we might want to\nallow different probability assignments to necessarily equivalent\npropositions: with all her exhaustive knowledge of pure arithmetic and\nlogic, the agent might still be uncertain on whether water =\nH2O before investigating, in spite of certainty on the\nself-identity of water. If the hyperintensional probability function\nrepresented objective chance or frequency, however,\nhyperintensionality may also be tied to how the world is. Nolan\n(2016a) and Salmon (2019) have both recently argued that objective\nchance ascriptions are hyperintensional. \nPlausibly, “ought” is hyperintensional: perhaps you ought\nto call your sister, but it is not the case that you ought to call\nyour sister and be self-identical even though it is impossible to call\nyour sister without calling your sister and being self-identical, and\nvice versa. (Perhaps you promised to call: but unless you are a\nphilosopher you probably did not promise to be self-identical.) Some\nof these obligations might be dependent on our representational\npractices. But perhaps there are obligations of objective morality as\nwell. Perhaps your moral obligation to not callously cause suffering\nis like this. If there are objective obligations, they might be best\nconstrued as hyperintensional: the Moral Law may enjoin you to avoid\ncallously inflicting suffering, but it may be silent about whether you\nought to avoid inflicting callous suffering while being\nself-identical. See Faroldi (2019) for a recent hyperintensional\ntreatment of “ought”. \nTruthmakers theorists have been looking for a relationship between\ntrue propositions and the aspects of the world that make those\npropositions true. Theories of this relation often make truthmaking\nhyperintensional: \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) may be necessarily equivalent, yet\nthe worldly bit that makes \\(A\\) true is distinct from the one that\nmakes \\(B\\) true. As Restall (1996a) points out, this seems to follow\nif one also endorses the Disjunction Thesis: something is a truthmaker\nfor (\\(A\\) or \\(B\\)) iff it is a truthmaker for \\(A\\) or a\ntruthmaker for \\(B\\). Independently of the Disjunction Thesis, a\ntruthmaker for one necessary truth may plausibly not be a truthmaker\nfor all others: “There are infinitely many prime numbers”\nshould have as truthmaker something to do with numbers. “Anyone\nwho eats and drinks at least eats” seems to not have anything to\ndo with numbers. See MacBride (2013 [2020], the SEP entry on\n truthmakers, section 1)\n for some accounts of truthmaking where necessarily equivalent\npropositions need not have the same truthmaker. \nSome occurrences are impossible, but may still have explanatory and\neven causal consequences. It may be impossible to prove a given\nmathematical conjecture: the conjecture might have a counterexample\nthat nobody has yet noticed. Still, the fact that the conjecture is\nnot proved may have various effects: if you have bet that you will\nprove it by a certain time you will lose the bet; if your tenure case\nin the mathematics department turns on whether you managed to prove\nthe conjecture, you will miss out on tenure. Bernstein (2016) gives a\ntheory of omissions of impossible outcomes, and argues that they play\nan explanatory and causal role. \nHoffmann-Kolss (2015) argues that a number of classifications of\nproperties needed for metaphysics are hyperintensional. The\nintrinsic/extrinsic distinction is one example, discussed above.\nHoffman-Kolss also argues the qualitative/non-qualitative distinction\nis hyperintensional (the distinction between properties that do not\nrequire a relationship to a particular and those that do—e.g.,\nbeing square vs. being John’s neighbor: see\nalso Hoffman-Kolss 2019). The dispositional/categorical distinction is\narguably hyperintensional (Hoffmann-Kolss 2015: 341–342, 346).\n(One philosophically controversial example may illustrate: on some\ntheories, there is a necessarily-existing God that is necessarily the\nonly omnipotent being. Still, we might think being omnipotent\nis dispositional, concerning the powers of that being, while being\nGod is categorical (2015: 346).) The distinction between\nperfectly natural properties that best carve at the joints, and the\nothers, is, too (2015: 345). Hoffman-Kolss’s example here is to\ncontrast the (supposedly) perfectly natural property of being an\nelectron with the infinitely disjunctive identity property of\nbeing \\(e_1\\) or being \\(e_2\\) or… and so on\nfor all possible electrons \\(e\\). If electronhood is essential to the\nobjects that have it, something is an electron if and only if it is\none of \\(e_1\\), \\(e_2\\), etc., but Hoffman-Kolss argues this latter\ncondition is not a perfectly natural one. \nAny item on this list might be controversial. You might think that\ncounterfactual conditionals, for example, communicate more about how\nwe explain or predict the world than anything about the world as it\nis. Or that what explains what is more a matter of the representations\nwe make of the world, than of the world itself. One could try to\nexplain away grounding’s putative hyperintensionality in terms\nof our cognitive structures, as Thompson (2016) suggests. Thompson and\nByrne (2019) offer a general “conceptualist” alternative\nto taking any of the cases we discussed as requiring\nnon-representational phenomena to be characterized in hyperintensional\nterms: an explanation of our use of hyperintensional language to\ncapture these phenomena comes from an account of what it is to\ndescribe and explain in these areas (2019: 157). Still, if a need to\nrecognize hyperintensional distinctions flows from more than facts\nabout how we represent the world, hyperintensionality will be of\ninterest well beyond philosophy of mind and language. \nWhile\n Section 4\n considers some difficulties for specific hyperintensional theories,\nhere we discuss general objections to the very idea that we need a\ntheory of language or mind that marks hyperintensional distinctions.\nOne kind of argument in this ballpark has to do with a general\n“Boolean” challenge to formulating a semantics for\nhyperintensional expressions in the dominant truth-conditional\nframework. This style of argument will be discussed in\n §2.1. \nAnother kind of argument advanced by defenders of SPWS such as\nStalnaker (1984) and Lewis (1982, 1986), has it that the prima\nfacie hyperintensionality of knowledge, belief, or content is\nmisleading, and that SPWS can still do the job once misleading\nintuitions have been explained away. This style of argument will be\ndiscussed in\n §2.2. \nOne way to modify SPWS to give truth conditions for sentences is to\nresort to sets including both possible and impossible worlds (ways\nthings could not have been). Sentences that agree in truth\nvalue in very possible world can still be assigned distinct\ntruth-conditions, since those sentences might be true in different\nimpossible worlds. (See\n §4.3).\n Another way is to use structured meanings, where sentences\nwith the same possible-worlds truth conditions can have different\nmeanings because of the way they are built up. (See\n §4.5).\n An objection to these approaches can be generalized to any approach\nthat tries to make room for hyperintensionality in a truth-conditional\nframework. \nThe objection, presented in Cresswell (2002) against structured\npropositions and suggested by Stalnaker (1996) against impossible\nworlds, can be illustrated by focusing on the meaning of negation.\nGiven a statement \\(A\\), what truth-conditions can we offer for\n\\({\\sim}A\\)? Plausibly, the truth conditions can be exhausted by\nspecifying that \\({\\sim}A\\) is true when \\(A\\) is false, and not\notherwise. Since this exhausts the meaning of\n“\\({\\sim}\\)”, it is tempting to identify the proposition\n\\({\\sim}A\\) as being the proposition with this truth condition.\nPlausibly, also, the truth conditions for \\({\\sim}{\\sim}A\\) will just\nbe the truth conditions for \\(A\\). (We may even want to derive this\nsecond claim from plausible principles about truth, falsehood, and\nnecessity.) Now any theory which allows for distinct necessarily\nequivalent propositions will fall to the same objection: suppose \\(C\\)\nand \\(D\\) are distinct, necessarily equivalent propositions. Then\n\\({\\sim}C\\) will be the proposition that is true just in case \\(C\\) is\nfalse, and \\({\\sim}D\\) will be the proposition that is true just in\ncase \\(D\\) is false: so \\({\\sim}C\\) and \\({\\sim}D\\) will be the same\nproposition. But then there will be a unique proposition with the\ntruth conditions for \\({\\sim}{\\sim}C (/{\\sim}{\\sim}D)\\), since\n\\({\\sim}{\\sim}C\\) is the negation of \\({\\sim}C\\). So \\(C\\) and \\(D\\)\nmust be the same proposition after all. This is a reductio of\nthe hypothesis that there can be a hyperintensional distinction\nbetween \\(C\\) and \\(D\\): if they are necessarily equivalent, they are\nidentical. \nWe might call this an objection from Booleanism, both because\nuniqueness of truth-conditional complementation is characteristic of\nBoolean approaches to negation, and because similar objections can be\nmotivated by Boolean thoughts about other operations. We might hope to\ndefine conjunction so that necessarily, \\((A \\land B)\\) is true iff\n\\(A\\) is true and \\(B\\) is true, and indeed the truth condition for\nthe proposition that \\((A \\land B)\\) is just that both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nare true. But then, with other innocuous assumptions, any two\nnecessarily equivalent sentences will express the same proposition, by\na similar chain of reasoning. \nCresswell (1975) was one of the pioneers of structured approaches to\nsentence meaning to handle hyperintensionality. So it is significant\nthat he thinks this objection refutes a contention at the heart of\northodox structured meaning projects, though Cresswell thinks that we\nmay still be interested in semantic structures for reasons other than\nhow they might make a difference to the truth-conditions of complex\nembeddings. \nDefenders of hyperintensional meanings need to resist the idea that\nfor each proposition \\(A\\) there is only one proposition true whenever\n\\(A\\) is false. This leaves them with a challenge: how are we to\nunderstand logical operations such as negation and conjunction once\nthese Boolean characterizations are rejected? \nTalk of belief, desire, and meaning is prima facie\nhyperintensional, as discussed above. But perhaps this appearance\ncould be resisted. One strategy is to employ use/mention distinctions\nin novel ways. Instead of hyperintensional operations on propositions\nor other meanings, we can treat apparently hyperintensional language\nas expressing properties of or relations between sentences or other\npieces of language. If we do this systematically, a theory can do away\nwith merely intensional distinctions. \nQuine (1953) suggests that modal operators, when we need them at all,\nare best interpreted as predicates of sentences. Quine (1956) and\nDavidson (1968) suggest an approach to propositional attitude\nascriptions as implicitly talking about connections between people and\nsentences: “John believes that it is raining” is\nregimented as a two-place predicate holding between John and the\nsentence “It is raining”. For Davidson, this in effect\nasserts that John stands in a certain relation to a sentence that\nstands in the same-saying relation to the sentence “It is\nraining”. This supposedly accommodates how non-English speakers\ncan believe that it is raining. Reconstruing mental attitude reports\nas reporting relations to sentences has fallen out of favor in\ncontemporary philosophy, for reasons largely orthogonal to\nintensionality or hyperintensionality: see Propositional Attitude\nAscriptions, section 7. Still, with enough ingenuity techniques like\nQuine’s and Davidson’s could be extended to apparently\nhyperintensional pieces of language. \nSome philosophers who reject extensionalism nevertheless offer\ntechniques for avoiding treating beliefs and desires as\nhyperintensional. Stalnaker (1984) tries to rescue the SPWS analysis\nof propositional content by explaining away hyperintensional\nintuitions via a sort of metalinguistic approach: when we fail to see\nthat a proposition is necessarily true, or that two propositions are\nnecessarily equivalent, we are actually failing to see what\npropositions are expressed by certain sentences. Given sentence \\(A\\),\none should distinguish (1) the proposition \\(P\\) expressed by \\(A\\)\n(in a context), and (2) the proposition \\(P\\)* that A\nexpresses \\(P\\), relating the sentence to what it expresses.\nIgnorance of necessary truths or equivalences is ignorance about\nP*. \nStalnaker maintains that whenever one fails to know or believe a necessary truth, \\(A\\),\none actually fails to fully grasp the sentence \\(A\\)’s meaning:\none doesn’t realize that \\(A\\) expresses the total set of\nworlds. Stalnaker points at the occasional distance between the\nsyntactic structure of the relevant \\(A\\), which can be quite complex,\nand the expressed proposition—in SPWS, an unstructured entity (a\nset): \nWhenever the structure of sentences is complicated, there will be a\nnontrivial question about the relation between sentences and the\npropositions they express, and so there will be room for reasonable\ndoubt about what proposition is expressed by a given sentence.\n(Stalnaker 1984: 84) \nFor Stalnaker’s story to work in general, all cases of ignorance\nof necessary truths or equivalences must be instances of meaning\nignorance. This is difficult to believe. A mathematician who wonders\nwhether Goldbach’s conjecture is true can hardly be described as\nmistaken about what “Every even integer larger than two is the\nsum of two primes” means. They know the meanings of all\nconstituents of the sentence—they have mastered the\nelementary-school-math concepts even integer, larger\nthan, two, sum, prime number as much\nas any of us. As competent speakers of English, they understand how\nthe syntax of the sentence makes its constituents conjure for it to\nexpress the content it expresses. What they have doubts about is\nwhether that content is true. We sometimes seem to fully grasp the\ncontents of sentences whose status of necessary truths, or falsities,\nwe are ignorant of. \nLewis (1982) proposes a fragmentation strategy to explain away\napparent failures of logical omniscience, in particular, apparent\nbelief in inconsistencies which is not, however, belief in everything.\nOne’s epistemic state may be split into different “frames\nof mind”. One may believe \\(A\\) in one mind frame, \\({\\sim}A\\)\nin another one, but fail to put them together: \nI used to think that Nassau Street ran roughly east-west; that the\nrailroad nearby ran roughly north-south; and that the two were roughly\nparallel. […] So each sentence in an inconsistent triple was\ntrue according to my beliefs, but not everything was true according to\nmy beliefs. […] My system of beliefs was broken into\n(overlapping) fragments. Different fragments came into action in\ndifferent situations, and the whole system of beliefs never manifested\nitself all at once. […] The inconsistent conjunction of all\nthree did not belong to, was in no way implied by, and was not true\naccording to, any one fragment. That is why it was not true according\nto my system of beliefs taken as a whole. (Lewis 1982: 436) \nEach fragment can be given the SPWS treatment, while trans-fragmental\ninconsistencies do not trivialize the belief system. \nThe account, just like Stalnaker’s, doesn’t seem to\ngeneralize. It seems strange to say that when agents don’t\nfollow through the logical consequences of what they believe,\nit’s always because they haven’t conjoined the premises\nwhereas, when they do, they suddenly come to believe all the\ninfinitely many consequences (Jago 2014). It’s sometimes an easy\nlogical step from \\(A_1, A_2, A_3\\), to \\(A_1 \\land A_2 \\land A_3\\).\nWhat is often difficult is to see whether a remote \\(B\\) follows from\n\\(A_1 \\land A_2 \\land A_3\\). \nEven if Lewis and Stalnaker can explain away the apparent\nhyperintensionality of belief, these attempts to not extend in any\nstraightforward way to all prima facie cases of\nhyperintensionality. Stalnaker, at least, seems committed to a project\nof explaining away many apparent cases of hyperintensionality,\ncommitted as he is to a SPWS account of linguistic meaning and mental\ncontent (Stalnaker 1984). So far as we can tell, Stalnaker is willing\nto take this project piece-meal. \nLewis seems more hospitable to hyperintensional approaches, provided\nthey can be ultimately explained in terms of possible worlds and\nset-theoretic constructions out of them. In Lewis (1986: 49–50),\nhe discusses a hyperintensional “trivially” operator that\nwould apply differently to different necessary truths. In a\nposthumously published letter (Lewis 2004) he seems to acknowledge\nthat there was more than one distinct impossible fiction, and\npresumably that “According to fiction \\(f, A\\)” was\nhyperintensional (since when \\(f\\) is an impossible fiction, there\nwill be some impossible claim that is true according to it, but in\ngeneral not all impossible claims will be). \nPhilosophers suspicious of hyperintensionality in particular areas\nshould consider if this stems from features of the specific case or is\ngeneral. If the latter, they may wish to attempt a general account of\nmeaning that ensures we never need to acknowledge hyperintensionality:\notherwise, a general suspicion will risk being undermined. \nThe flip side of hyperintensionality’s pervasiveness is its\nencompassing very diverse phenomena. We now investigate what (little)\nwe know about the general structure of hyperintensionality. The\ninitial characterization, recall, merely tells us that a concept or\noperator is hyperintensional when it is more fine-grained than\nintensional or standard modal concepts or operators, marking a\ndistinction invisible to the latter. As Jespersen and Duží\nreminded us, little is said on “how hyper” hyperintensions\nare. The tag of “granularity problems” (Barwise 1997; Jago\n2014; Bjerring & Schwarz 2017) labels a set of issues concerning\nthe right level of fine-grainedness. There are several related\nproblems here, because different hyperintensional concepts seem to\ndisplay different degrees of fine-grainedness. This can be understood\nagain in terms of substitution salva veritate for the\nrelevant operators: \\(X\\) is strictly more fine-grained than \\(Y\\)\nwhen all substitutions that go through for \\(X\\) also do for \\(Y,\\)\nbut \\(X\\) fails some, which goes through for \\(Y.\\) \nA requirement often suggested is that a hyperintensional account of\nthis or that notion shouldn’t make it as fine-grained as the\nsyntax of the language one is working with—on pain of giving\naway the very point of having a semantics for it. Propositions may be\nmore fine-grained than sets of possible worlds, but they had better\nnot be mappable 1:1 to the sentences expressing them. Otherwise, we\nwould lose one main motivation for having propositions to begin with,\nnamely that syntactically different sentences can say the same thing.\nIt also seems intuitive that, e.g., the content of \\(A\\) should be the\nsame as that of \\(A \\land A\\), and that \\(A \\land B\\) should have the\nsame content as \\(B \\land A\\): “It’s windy and rainy\ntoday” seems to just say the same thing as “It’s\nrainy and windy today” (for further motivations for\ncoarse-graining, see Bjerring & Schwarz 2017). On the other hand,\na limited cognitive agent may fail to make even the simplest inference\nstarting from what she knows or believes: she may believe that \\(A\n\\land B\\), fail to perform Conjunction Elimination, and thus fail to\nbelieve that \\(A\\). Psychologically very realistic accounts of\nknowledge or belief seem to require extreme fine-grainedness, cutting\nmore finely than same-saying. Jespersen (2010) is one example of a\ntheory that has very fine-grained meanings available for some\nconstructions, while offering more coarse-grained meanings for some\ntraditional purposes where little or no hyperintensionality is\nrequired. \nOne may hope for a total ordering of hyperintensional notions\nby fine-grainedness, i.e., an ordering such that any two given ones\nare comparable: given any \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), either \\(X\\) is at least as\nfine-grained as \\(Y\\), or vice versa. But one can show that the simple\nsetting is wrong. One can provide intuitive examples (inspired by\nHornischer 2017, which also includes a thorough discussion) of\nincomparable hyperintensional operators: \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) for which\nthere are sentences \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\), such that \\(XA\\) and\n\\(XB\\) are equivalent but \\(YA\\) and \\(YB\\) are not, \\(YC\\) and \\(YD\\)\nare equivalent but \\(XC\\) and \\(XD\\) are not. \nTake “Lois Lane knows that …” and “…\nbecause Clark Kent loves the Guggenheim Museum”. Consider the\nfour sentences: \nLois Lane knows that \\(A\\) (Clark Kent loves the Guggenheim Museum) if\nand only if she knows that \\(B\\) (“Clark Kent loves the\nGuggenheim Museum” is true) (surely Lois knows how truth\nworks!). On the other hand, she knows that \\(C\\) (Clark Kent is in New\nYork), but she doesn’t know that \\(D\\) (Superman, too, is), for\nshe is not aware that Superman is Clark Kent. \nAlso, it is false that \\(A\\) (Clark Kent loves the Guggenheim Museum)\nbecause Clark Kent loves the Guggenheim Museum (facts can’t\nexplain themselves), while it is true that \\(B\\) (“Clark Kent\nloves the Guggenheim Museum” is true) because Clark Kent loves\nthe Guggenheim Museum (assuming truth supervenes on/is grounded in\nfacts). On the other hand, \\(C\\) (Clark Kent is in New York) because\nClark Kent loves the Guggenheim Museum if and only if \\(D\\) (Superman\nis in New York) because Clark Kent loves the Guggenheim Museum, for\nSuperman is Clark Kent. \nSo knows and because turn out to be incomparable,\nand, given that they are hyperintensional, there is no total ordering\nfor hyperintensional notions. This may sustain some skepticism\n(ventilated, e.g., in Leitgeb 2019) on the possibility of a single\ntheory for all hyperintensional operators. On the other hand, it makes\nsense to conjecture that these can be at least partially ordered. It\nis then an issue worth investigating, whether concepts belonging to a\nsingle sub-family, e.g., the non-representational ones, or the\nrepresentational semantic ones, can be internally totally ordered\n(notice that knows is representational, while one may take\nbecause as belonging to “ontic” explanation). Or,\nthe other way around, the identification of totally ordered subsets of\nthe partially ordered set of hyperintensional concepts may be a good\nway to group such concepts into families that carve at the joints. \nWe now provide a survey of general hyperintensional approaches. Hardly\nany of them has been put forth as a systematic account of all\nhyperintensional notions. However, we focus on frameworks that are\ngeneral enough to handle a broad range of phenomena (thus we do not\nconsider, e.g., hyperintensional epistemic logics that target only\ncertain forms of logical omniscience, like justification logic). We\nbriefly introduce the key ideas of each approach, and we discuss how\nit handles hyperintensional phenomena such as those introduced in\n Section 1.\n We highlight relative merits and open issues. \nTwo-dimensional semantic theories (see entry on\n two-dimensional semantics)\n build on standard possible worlds semantics to handle a range of\nrepresentational hyperintensional phenomena. Originating in\ntwo-dimensional modal logic (Segerberg 1973; van Fraassen 1977; Davies\n& Humberstone 1980), versions of the view have been presented by\nKaplan (1989), Jackson (1994), and Chalmers (1996). (Stalnaker [1978]\nis a key pioneer of the approach, but he applied it to the pragmatics\nof communication, rather than to provide a hyperintensional semantics:\nsee Stalnaker 2004.) \nSometimes what a word picks out depends on context. Indexicals\n(“I”, “you”, “here”,\n“yesterday”) and demonstratives (“this”,\n“that”, “over there”) are obvious cases: which\nthing someone refers to using “this” depends on what they\nare demonstrating at the time. Kaplan (1989) proposed that these\nexpressions function as rigid designators on occasions of use: whether\nthe proposition expressed by a sentence including one is true at a\npossible world depends on how things stand with the object, if any,\nreferred to in the actual world. If on 5 March 2020 I say\n“Yesterday it was sunny”, I express a proposition true at\na possible world iff it is sunny on 4 March 2020 in that world. Elvis\nsays “I was born in 1935”: that is true at a possible\nworld iff Elvis was born in 1935 there. \nOn this view, “I am Elvis”, said by Elvis, is true just in\ncase Elvis is Elvis, thus necessarily true. Ditto for “Yesterday\nwas 4 March 2020”, said on 5 March 2020, which is true just in\ncase 4 March 2020 is 4 March 2020. Expressing those necessary truths\ncan, however, give contingent information to hearers who already knew\nthings are self-identical. To capture the difference between “I\nam Elvis” and “Elvis is Elvis”, when uttered by\nElvis as well as by someone else—say, Aretha—we would need\na story about the meaning of “I” that did not treat it as\na name. Kaplan took such meaning as a function from a context of\nutterance to an object, selecting the speaker as the object.\nSimilarly, the meaning of “yesterday” is a function from\nthe day of utterance, selecting the day before. This function is\ncalled the character of the expression. My knowing the\ncharacter (and facts about context) lets me take new information from\nthe utterances. I know “I” picks out the speaker and that\nthe speaker said “I am Elvis”. If I trust him, I can work\nout the speaker is Elvis. I might not have known that before,\nalthough I knew that Elvis is Elvis. \nMeanings, in this view, have two components: a character and\na content. The content is normally given via possible worlds.\nThe character is a function from contexts of utterance to contents.\nThe content of “I am Elvis”, uttered by Elvis, is the\ntotal set of worlds, since Elvis couldn’t but be Elvis. The\ncharacter is a function from the context’s speaker to the\ncontent that that person is Elvis. So it is a function from Elvis to\nthe content that Elvis is Elvis, from Aretha to the content that\nAretha is Elvis, etc. \nTraditionally, philosophers have found it useful to represent this\ninteraction of character and content with a two-dimensional matrix,\nhence the expression “two dimensional semantics”. Let us\nillustrate with a small example. In \\(W_1\\), Elvis is singing but\nAretha is not, and in \\(W_2\\), Aretha is singing but Elvis is not, and\nin \\(W_3\\), neither is singing. Consider the sentence “I am\nsinging”, with two possible speakers, Elvis and Aretha. We get\nthe following six scenarios, depending on which speaker is speaking\nand which world the resulting content is being evaluated at: \nEach horizontal line (row) of the matrix represents a content that can\nbe associated with “I am singing”, with different rows\nrepresenting the different contents produced by different contexts\n(due to different speakers, in this case). The entire matrix\nrepresents facts about the character of a sentence. These\ntwo-dimensional matrices become more interesting when more complex\nconstructions are discussed, but the key ideas for current purposes\nare more easily presentable without further using matrices. \nNow some proponents of two-dimensional semantics extend this setting\nbeyond indexicals and demonstratives, e.g., to proper names\nand natural kind terms. Take “Robin Hood”. Its\ncontent, suppose, is just Robin. But its character is a function from\ncontexts to such contents. In a world where our use of “Robin\nHood” derives in the right kind of way from Robin, the character\ndelivers our Robin as the content of “Robin Hood”. In a\nworld where Richard leads a band of outlaws in Sherwood, uses\n“Robin Hood” as an alias, is famous for robbing for the\nrich to give to the poor, the character of “Robin Hood”\npicks out Richard. Similarly for expression\n“water” and H2O in our world, or\n“XYZ” in Twin Earth: the character of “water”\npicks out different substances in different contexts. \nCharacter-sensitive expressions can give rise to hyperintensionality.\nTake “It is a priori that”: It is a\npriori that Hesperus is Hesperus; it is not a priori\nthat Hesperus is Phosphorus. Although “Hesperus” and\n“Phosphorus” have the same content (the planet Venus),\nthey can differ in character. There may be contingent a\npriori cases: Elvis says “I am here now” in a context\nwhere the assigned content is that Elvis Presley is in Graceland on\nnoon of 25 December 1975. “I am here now”, some claim, can\nbe known a priori by Elvis, but he cannot know a\npriori that Elvis is in Graceland on noon of 25 December\n1975. \nPropositional attitude contexts make for a salient case. The Sheriff\nof Nottingham believes Robin Hood is a dangerous outlaw. He does not\nbelieve that Robin of Locksley is a dangerous outlaw, although Robin\nHood is Locksley. We can explain this if we take “believes\nthat” as character-sensitive. “Robin Hood is a dangerous\noutlaw” and “Robin of Locksley is a dangerous\noutlaw” coincide in content (they are true in the same worlds).\nBut we can assign different characters to “Robin Hood” and\n“Robin of Locksley” by looking at differences in how they\nare typically acquired, in the causal history leading back to their\nfirst uses, or if we tie them to how the Sheriff sees the world. This\ncan be generalized to so-called intensional transitive verbs. The\nSheriff can be looking for Robin Hood but not looking for Robin of\nLocksley if “looking for” is sensitive to character. \nTwo-dimensional approaches are somewhat controversial when they move\nbeyond indexicals and demonstratives. (See the papers in\nGarcía-Carpintero and Maciá 2006 for arguments for and\nagainst two-dimensional semantics.) But they can account for the\napparent hyperintensionality of “it is a priori\nthat…” or “… believes that…”\nwithout straying too far from a traditional possible-worlds framework.\nContents keep being sets of possible worlds. Qua functions from\ncontexts to contents, characters are familiar from standard treatments\nof context-dependent expressions such as Kaplan’s. \nTwo-dimensional semantics also has a nice story on the behavior of\nindexicals in belief contexts. “I believe you are Elvis”,\nsaid addressing Elvis, appears to mean something different from\n“I believe Elvis is Elvis”. I would happily utter the\nlatter but not the former if I believe I am facing an Elvis\nimpersonator. It is hard to avoid the impression that the character of\nexpressions like “you” (or, “yesterday”,\n“that car”, etc.) makes the difference in such cases. \nTwo-dimensional semantic theories cannot easily offer a general\naccount of hyperintensionality. Worldly hyperintensionality is\nespecially recalcitrant. When, e.g., talk of essence is employed, and\nwe say that Socrates is essentially human but is not essentially\n(human and \\(2 + 2 = 4)\\), or not essentially (human and either bats\nhave wings or it is not the case that bats have wings), those two\nalternatives to “human” both have the same two-dimensional\nintension as “human”. Any context will pick out the same\ncontent for the predicates “is human”, “is human and\nsuch that \\(2 + 2 = 4\\)”, and “is human and either bats\nhave wings or it is not the case that bats have wings”. \nThe full range of non-trivial counterpossible conditionals are not\neasily handled either. Take “If Hobbes had squared the circle,\nHobbes would have proved an impressive mathematical result”.\nThis is plausibly true, whereas “If Archimedes had squared the\ncircle, Hobbes would have proved an impressive mathematical\nresult” is false: Archimedes lived well before Hobbes and so\nwould have beaten him to it, and Hobbes did not otherwise prove any\nimpressive results. The necessary falsehoods “Hobbes squared the\ncircle” and “Archimedes squared the circle” seem to\ndeliver different truth values as antecedents in same-consequent\ncounterfactuals. Functions from contexts to contents taken as the\nusual sets of possible worlds don’t deliver the desired result:\nwhichever other person a context picks out for “Hobbes”,\nit is hard to see how “\\(x\\) squared the circle” could\npick out a contingent proposition that would be useful. Prospects are\nnot quite hopeless here: approaches that employ two-dimensionalism as\nat least part of the picture about indicative conditionals\nhave been suggested by Weatherson (2001) and Nolan (2003). One might\nhope for an extension to counterfactuals. Or perhaps some other\napproach might work: recent work on counter-analytic conditionals done\nby Locke (forthcoming) and Kocurek, Jerzak, and Rudolph (2020) is\npromising. \nTwo-dimensionalism may be appealing as an account of some\nhyperintensional phenomena even if it cannot be generalized: it can be\nseen as one tool among others for constructing semantic theories for\nhyperintensional expressions, if one is willing to forego a\none-size-fits all approach. \nSome theories of propositional content represent a number of\nhyperintensional distinctions by combining SPWS with ways of splitting\nthe modal space. The main work in this area is Yablo’s book\nAboutness (2014; and see Osorio-Kupferblum 2016 for a\ncritical discussion). Aboutness is \nthe relation that meaningful items bear to whatever it is that they\nare on or of or that they address or\nconcern, (Yablo 2014: 1) \nnamely, their subject matter. The subject matter of a\nsentence in context can be seen as a topic, an issue, or a question\nthe sentence may be taken, in that context, as answering to. When the\nissue is the number of stars, the relevant question may be:\n“How many stars are there?”. As in inquisitive semantics\n(Ciardelli, Groenendijk, & Roelofsen 2013), one can associate the\nquestion with the set of its answers: There are no stars; There is one\nstar; There are two stars; etc. Answers are propositions in the SPWS\nsense: sets of possible worlds. We now call these thin\npropositions for the full propositional contents of sentences will\nturn out to be richer than that. The question, thus, splits the\ntotality of worlds into sets (the relevant thin propositions). Two\nworlds \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) end up in the same set just in case they\nagree on the answer—in our example: when the number of stars is\nthe same at \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\). When, as in the example, the question\nhas just one correct answer, the thin propositions at issue form a\npartition of the set of worlds \\(W\\): a splitting into subsets such\nthat their union is all of \\(W\\), and such that each \\(w\\) in\n\\(W\\) is in exactly one subset or cell. One cell has all the 0-star\nworlds, one all the 1-star worlds, one all the 2-star worlds, and so\non. \nWhile the idea is already in Lewis (1988) (see also Plebani and\nSpolaore forthcoming), Yablo proposes a generalization due to some\nquestions’ having more than one correct answer:\n“Where’s a good Italian restaurant in Amsterdam?”. A\nworld \\(w_1\\) can be in more than one cell now: it can agree with\n\\(w_2\\) by having a good Italian restaurant in Rembrandtplein, with\n\\(w_3\\) by having another good Italian restaurant in Keizersgracht.\nHere the question determines a division of \\(W\\): a splitting into\nsubsets whose union is \\(W\\), but which can overlap. \nThere’s an intuitive mereology of issues, topics, or subject\nmatters: they should be capable of overlapping and of fusing into\nwholes which inherit the proper features from the parts (Yablo 2014:\nSection 3.2). The topic philosophy and the topic\nmathematics overlap (the overlap including, presumably,\nlogic). How things went in 1882 is included in the\nlarger how things went in the nineteenth century. A larger\nsubject matter induces smaller cells: \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) agree on\nwhat happened in their whole nineteenth century only if they agree on\nwhat happened in their 1882 to begin with. \nLet \\(|A|\\), a subset of \\(W\\), be the thin proposition expressed by\n\\(A\\). The thick proposition expressed by \\(A\\), [\\(A\\)], is\nits thin proposition \\(|A|\\) together with \\(A\\)’s subject\nmatter, \\(s(A)\\). How does one get the subject matter of\n\\(A\\)? Yablo suggests assigning a positive subject matter, the\ndivision corresponding to “Why is \\(A\\) true?”; a negative\nsubject matter, the division corresponding to “Why is \\(A\\)\nfalse?”; and to identify the overall \\(s(A)\\) with its positive\nand negative subject matters taken together. Worlds agree on the\noverall subject matter of \\(A\\) when either \\(A\\) is true, or \\(A\\) is\nfalse, for the same reasons at them. Yablo calls the reasons for\n\\(A\\)’s being true (false), \\(A\\)’s truthmakers\n(falsemakers). He suggests not to read them in a\nmetaphysically loaded way, as chunks of reality whose obtaining\nnecessitates truth, and advocates a “semantic” conception\nof truthmaking: truth/falsemakers are cells of divisions of \\(W\\),\nthus, just sets of worlds again, i.e., thin propositions. \nThick propositions are hyperintensional. They cut at least as finely\nas ordinary sets of worlds: when \\(|A|\\) differs from \\(|B|\\), [\\(A\\)]\nwill differ from [\\(B\\)]. Additionally, there will be \\(A\\)’s\nand \\(B\\)’s expressing different thick propositions in spite of\nbeing true at the same worlds, because they are about different\nthings: \\(s(A)\\) will differ from \\(s(B)\\) even if \\(|A| = |B|\\). For\nexample, “There is an even number of stars or there is\nnot” and “There are no non-self-identical Italian\nrestaurants” are both necessarily true, but they correspond to\ndistinct thick propositions because of their different subject\nmatters. The suggestion that adding subject matter to semantics is the\nkey to handling hyperintensionality is discussed in Gioulatou\n(2016). \nTo get a precise answer on which hyperintensional distinctions the\nframework can make, one needs a full-fledged truthmaker assignment to\nall sentences of the target language. Yablo gives two “semantic\npictures”, a reductive and a recursive one,\nwhich pull in different directions. We take the recursive route, which\nrelies on van Fraassen (1969) and is found more plausible by some\n(e.g., Hawke 2018; Fine 2020), and leave the details to a consultation\nof Yablo (2014: 56–9). In a plain sentential language: when\n\\(A\\) is an atomic formula \\(p\\) one can assign it some truthmaker\n\\(\\{p^+\\}\\) and falsemaker \\(\\{p^-\\}\\). Negation flips: For \\(A =\n{\\sim}B\\), what truthmakes \\(A\\) is what falsemakes \\(B\\) and vice\nversa. For \\(A = B \\land C\\), what truthmakes \\(A\\) is the union of\nwhat truthmakes \\(B\\) and what truthmakes \\(C\\); what falsemakes \\(A\\)\nis what either falsemakes \\(B\\) or falsemakes \\(C\\). For \\(A = B \\lor\nC\\), we flip the truth- and falsemakers of \\(B \\land C\\). Then, e.g.,\n\\(p \\land q\\) is made true by \\(\\{p^+, q^+\\}\\), false by \\(\\{p^-\\}\\)\nand by \\(\\{q^-\\}\\); \\(p \\lor q\\) is made true by \\(\\{p^+\\}\\) and by\n\\(\\{q^+\\}\\); false by \\(\\{p^-, q^-\\}\\). \nNow \\(p \\lor {\\sim}p\\) and \\(q \\lor {\\sim}q\\) (“John is either a\nbachelor or not”, “Either 44 is the sum of two primes or\nnot”) will express distinct thick propositions insofar as they\nare about different things (how things stand John-wise is a different\nissue from how things stand 44-wise). When, with distinct \\(p\\) and\n\\(q\\), the truthmakers of \\(p \\lor {\\sim}p\\) are \\(\\{p^+\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{p^-\\}\\), those of \\(q \\lor {\\sim}q\\) are \\(\\{q^+\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{q^-\\}, s(p \\lor {\\sim}p)\\) will differ from \\(s(q \\lor {\\sim}q)\\)\nand so the two thick propositions [\\(p \\lor {\\sim}p\\)] and [\\(q \\lor\n{\\sim}q\\)] will differ although \\(|p \\lor {\\sim}p| = |q \\lor {\\sim}q|\n= W\\). Also, [\\(p\\)] will differ from [\\(p \\land (q \\lor {\\sim}q)\\)]\nas \\(p\\) is truthmade by \\(\\{p^+\\}, p \\land (q \\lor {\\sim}q)\\) by\n\\(\\{p^+, q^+\\}\\) and \\(\\{p^+, q^-\\}\\), not by \\(\\{p^+\\}\\). So one can\ncapture the idea that “You see that Mary is eating an ice\ncream” and “You see that Mary is eating an ice cream and\nJohn is either eating chips or not” don’t say the same, in\nthe face of the logical equivalence of \\(A\\) and \\(A \\land (B \\lor\n{\\sim}B\\)). \nBut even lacking a precise treatment for a predicative language, we\ncan see that distinct, logically atomic necessarily true or false\ncontents may be difficult to tell apart. Take “Mike is\nMike”, \\(m = m\\), and “Mike is Jack the Ripper”, \\(m\n= j\\), which differ in informativeness. Given that Mike is Jack and\nthe necessity of identity, \\(|m = m| = |m = j| = W\\); but also the\nsubject matters will coincide: what makes both claims true is a fact\nabout Mike, Mike’s being Mike. Nothing makes either false.\n“Hobbes squared the circle”, \\(Sh\\), and “Daniel\nNolan squared the circle”, \\(Sd\\), concern different issues: one\nis about Hobbes’ mathematical (non)achievements, the other is\nabout Daniel’s. But \\(|Sh| = |Sd| = \\emptyset\\), and\nthere’s no way to get truth/falsemakers as sets of possible\nworlds that will make \\(s(Sh)\\) and \\(s(Sd)\\) differ: no matter how\none splits and groups possible worlds into sets, there will be no\nworlds available where Hobbes squares the circle or where Nolan does\nto begin with. \nAs noticed by Fine (2020), the difficulty may be due to the fact that\nthe setting is conservative with respect to SPWS: it starts with the\nusual possible worlds and just adds ways of splitting and grouping\nthem (see Hawke 2018 for further criticisms). The next approach\npromises to do better by looking at worlds that step beyond the\npossible. \nIf a theorist starts from a possible worlds framework, and comes under\npressure to recognize hyperintensional distinctions, one response is\nto add impossible worlds (Priest 1992; Zalta 1997; Kiourti 2010; Jago\n2015; Berto & Jago 2019) taken as ways things could not be, or\nworlds where some truth of logic, mathematics, or metaphysics fails.\nWe will be brief on this topic here, as one can consult the entry on\n impossible worlds\n for more details. \nIn impossible worlds semantics, different impossibilities can be\ndistinguished by being associated with different sets of worlds (only\nimpossible worlds), and different necessary truths can also be\ndistinguished by different sets of worlds (all possible worlds plus\nsome of the impossible worlds). Each distinct necessary truth will\ncorrespond to a distinct set containing all possible worlds and some\nimpossible worlds; and each distinct impossible proposition will\ncorrespond to a set of worlds that contains no possible worlds, but\nwhich may contain impossible worlds (Rantala 1982). \nKripke (1965) already introduced “non-normal worlds” for\nthe semantics of modal systems such as C.I. Lewis’ S2 and S3:\nsuch worlds were points where all formulas of the form \\(\\Diamond A\\)\nare true, and all those of the form \\(\\Box A\\) are false (intuitively:\neverything is possible, nothing is necessary). Cresswell (1970)\noffered a logic of belief in which beliefs were modelled with sets of\nboth possible and impossible worlds, so as to not treat every\nimpossible belief the same as every other, and to allow someone to\nbelieve some necessary truths without believing them all. (See also\nHintikka 1975). Since then, impossible worlds have been used to\ntheorize about many of the hyperintensional phenomena discussed in\nthis entry. \nA closely related way to extend possible worlds semantics is to\nintroduce incomplete and inconsistent partial specifications of how\nthings could be, and could not be. So-called situation\nsemantics (Barwise & Perry 1983) employs these more general\nobjects to handle hyperintensional constructions such as\nspecifications of beliefs or information contents, as well as\napplications to avoid paradoxes that can arise from employing possible\nworlds. A version of situation semantics known as “truthmaker\nsemantics” has recently been defended as being superior to\nstandard world semantics (see Fine 2012, 2016, 2017; Hornischer 2020;\nMoltmann 2020, forthcoming). \nWith impossible worlds added to a theory, necessarily equivalent\nexpressions no longer have to have the same semantic values. Apart\nfrom their widespread use in the semantics for logical systems, work\nhas continued on using impossible worlds for giving theories of\npsychological attitude ascriptions and of claims about meaning: see\nJago (2014) for one recent treatment of a number of issues involving\nmental content and reasoning. Impossible worlds also help in theories\nof other kinds of representations: for use in theories of impossible\nfictions, see Priest (1997) and Badura and Berto (2019).\nEpistemologists are starting to find applications for impossible\nworlds in theories of knowledge: see, for example, Melchior\n(forthcoming). And logicians are using them to model non-omniscient\nhyperintensional agents by combining impossible worlds semantics with\ndynamic epistemic logic (Bjerring and Skipper (2019); Solaki, Berto,\n& Smets forthcoming). \nGiven the limitations of Lewis-Stalnaker theories of counterfactual\nconditionals when dealing with impossible antecedents (see\n §1.1.2),\n it is natural to extend a theory of counterfactual conditionals with\nimpossible worlds: see Routley (1989), Mares (1997), Nolan (1997),\nBrogaard and Salerno (2013). Similar theories can be offered of\nindicative conditionals: see Nolan (2016b). \nImpossible worlds have also been employed to give theories of a range\nof hyperintensional phenomena in metaphysics. One early application\nwas in the theory of de re necessity, in offering a theory of\nhow it could be necessarily true that an artifact could be made of\nslightly different material, but not too different, without succumbing\nto Chisolm’s paradox (Salmon 1984). Impossible worlds can be\nused to give a hyperintensional theory of properties as sets of\npossible and impossible instances (Nolan 2013: 8). They can be used to\noffer a theory of metaphysical explanation (Kment 2014), or in a\ntheory of essence (Brogaard & Salerno 2013: 646–8). They can\nplay a central role in a theory of omissions of impossibilities\n(Bernstein 2016). \nThe literature to date has only scratched the surface of potential\napplications of impossible words in metaphysical theorizing. A range\nof concerns about postulating impossible worlds are discussed in the\nentry on\n impossible worlds, section 6,\n Nolan (2013), and Berto and Jago (2019), as well as the concerns\ndiscussed in\n §2\n and\n §3\n above. \nOne should look at the SEP entry on\n relevance logic\n (also called “relevant logic”) for an introduction to\nthis research program (see the seminal Anderson & Belnap 1975;\nAnderson, Belnap, & Dunn 1992; and, for a comprehensive\nintroduction, Dunn & Restall 2002). We briefly discuss its\nconnections to hyperintensionality here. Its origins lay in the aim to\ndevelop logical systems free from the “paradoxes of the material\nand strict conditional” discussed above. Another early\nmotivation was to construct a conditional that could represent logical\ndeducibility within the logical language itself. \nIn this program, an agreed upon necessary (though, in general, not\nsufficient) condition for a conditional to be logically valid is that\nthere be some connection between antecedent and consequent.\nHistorically, this has often been phrased via a requirement called the\nVariable Sharing Property (VSP): \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is valid\nonly when \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) share some sentential variable or parameter\n(cf. Anderson & Belnap 1975: 32–3). VSP delivers\nhyperintensional distinctions: conditionals with (classically)\nimpossible antecedents and necessary consequents are not all trivially\nvalid or true. The infamous ex falso quodlibet, \\((A \\land\n\\neg A) \\rightarrow B\\), for instance, fails (it’s not the case\nthat anything is implied by a contradiction); whereas \\((A \\land \\neg\nA) \\rightarrow A\\) holds in most mainstream relevant systems\n(plausibly, a conjunction relevantly implies its conjuncts). \nA key feature of relevance logics, made apparent by their most\ndeveloped semantics, the so-called Routley-Meyer frames (Routley &\nMeyer 1973), is that hyperintensional distinctions are not achieved by\nsuperimposing on an essentially classical or normal modal logic a\nfilter that screens out irrelevancies. Relevance logics are weaker\nthan normal modal logics with SPWS or Kripke frames because their\nsemantics embeds points of evaluation for formulas different from\nclassical (maximally consistent) possible worlds, which are accessible\n(via a ternary accessibility relation, different from the\nbinary accessibility of Kripke frames) in the evaluation of\nconditionals. \nWorking out the intuitive interpretation of such points, of the\nternary relation, and indeed of the Routley-Mayer semantics as a\nwhole, has been a difficult task in the history of this research\nprogramme (see Copeland 1980; Read 1988; Restall 1996b; Mares 2004).\nThe consensus on the points nowadays seems to be that they be\nunderstood as non-normal or logically impossible worlds (see Priest\n2008: Ch, 10; Berto & Jago 2019: Ch. 6). See the SEP entry on\n impossible worlds\n for details. The impossible worlds of (the interpreted) Routley-Meyer\nframes can be seen as situations which can, e.g., be locally\ninconsistent (making true both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\), for some \\(A)\\)\nwithout thereby being trivial (making true everything), and partial or\nlocally incomplete (“taking no stance” on some \\(A\\) by\nmaking true neither it nor its negation). \nThe conditional of most mainstream relevant systems is taken as\nrepresenting implication or (necessary) entailment, not a ceteris\nparibus or counterfactual conditional. But some of the first\ntheories of counterpossible conditionals, addressing the limitations\nof the Lewis/Stalnaker account of counterfactuals, were developed\nagainst a relevance logic background: see Routley (1989); Mares and\nFuhrmann (1995), and Mares (1997). \nOther applications of relevance logic to areas where hyperintensional\ndistinctions seem needed include applications to the theory of\nconfirmation in science (Goddard 1977; Sylvan & Nola 1991); the\nlogic of fiction (Routley 1979); and the theory of information (Mares\n2004; Dunn 2015). Finally, a number of theories in deontic logic have\nbeen offered using a relevance logic base, including Anderson (1967),\nGoble (1999) and Tagawa and Cheng (2002). \nRelevance logic has also been deployed to give theories of\nworldly hyperintensionality. In a series of papers, Michael\nDunn developed a theory of relevant predication intended to\nilluminate a range of traditional metaphysical distinctions, including\nthe differences between intrinsic and extrinsic properties, essential\nand accidental properties, and between essential properties and\nproperties necessarily had when an object exists (Dunn 1987, 1990a,\n1990b). And as mentioned above, Restall (1996a) employed relevant\nlogic to offer a theory of truthmakers. \nOverall, the tools provided by the relevance logic program offer\ntheoretical resources for constructing theories of hyperintensional\nphenomena, whether representational or non-representational. To date,\nmany of these proposals have been piece-meal, with less of a general\nstory about how these techniques could be applied to handle\nhyperintensional language across the board. Some general strategies\nhave been outlined for how a theory could be constructed that handles\nall hyperintensional phenomena: one such program was Richard\nRoutley’s “Ultralogic as Universal”, first set out\nin Routley (1977). See Nolan (2018) and the essays in Routley (2019)\nfor recent evaluations. \nAfter Soames’ (1987) attack against unstructured accounts of\npropositions as sets of truth-supporting circumstances, structured\npropositions accounts (King 1995) have become the main rivals to SPWS\nviews. Roughly: propositions are taken as structures, composed of the\nentities which are the semantic values of the corresponding\nsentences’ syntactic constituents. Take “Robin loves\nBatman”. It’s composed of a noun, “Robin”, and\na verb phrase, “loves Batman”, itself made of a verb and a\nnoun. Let the semantic values of the lexical items be: [Robin],\n[Batman], [loving]. Then the corresponding proposition can be\ntaken as an ordered triple \\(\\langle\\)[Robin], [loving],\n[Batman]\\(\\rangle\\). Ordering is important: Batman may not return the\nfeeling, and “Batman loves Robin” expresses a different\nproposition: \\(\\langle\\)[Batman], [loving],\n[Robin]\\(\\rangle\\). (A proposition is not just an ordered\nlist, but we leave aside the difficult metaphysical issue of what ties\nits constituents together: see Gaskin 2008.) \nWhat makes for the constituents? Broadly Russellian\nstructured accounts, developed by authors like Salmon (1986), Soames\n(2008), are typically paired with direct reference or Millian accounts\nof names: thus, [Batman] is Batman and [Robin] is Robin. The semantic\nvalues of predicates and verb phrases can be taken as properties or\nrelations. The logical vocabulary is typically interpreted as denoting\nlogical operations, e.g., [\\({\\sim}\\)] can be the unary function that\nflips truth and falsity, [\\land] the binary function that outputs\ntruth only if both inputs are truths, etc. \nThis delivers hyperintensional distinctions, e.g., “John is\neither a bachelor or not” and “Either 44 is the sum of two\nprimes or not” will express different propositions: only one\nwill include [John], i.e., John, as a constituent. Necessarily\ntrue/false atomic sentences will also be differentiated, even when\ntheir syntactic structure is the same (“Hobbes squared the\ncircle” and “Daniel Nolan squared the circle”:\n[Daniel Nolan] isn’t [Hobbes]; “\\(3 + 3 = 6\\)” and\n“\\(2 + 2 = 4\\)”: [3] isn’t [2]). More challenging\ncases for the view come with the necessary a posteriori.\n“Mike is Mike” and “Mike is Jack the Ripper”\nexpress the same proposition, because [Mike] = [Jack the Ripper]. Same\nfor “All woodchucks are woodchucks”, “All woodchucks\nare whistlepigs”, as [woodchuck] = [whistlepig]. This will\ncreate issues in intentional contexts: \nSuppose Tama is familiar with both woodchucks and whistlepigs, but\nisn’t sure that they are the same kind of critter. He’s\nnoticed the similarities, though, and so he has his suspicions.\nSuppose further that Tama knows he is allergic to whistlepigs, and\nknows that he has just been bitten by a woodchuck. In this scenario,\n[“Tama fears that all woodchucks are whistlepigs”] is\nlikely true, while [“Tama fears that all woodchucks are\nwoodchucks”] is almost certainly false. (Ripley 2012: 9) \nSoames (1987) proposes a pragmatic-metalinguistic strategy similar to\nthe one tried by Stalnaker (1984), discussed in\n §2.2:\n one should distinguish attitudes towards sentences and towards\npropositions. Soames comes up with examples showing that the former\ncan be an unreliable guide to the latter, e.g., one can sometimes\nbelieve a proposition, but only assent to one of two distinct\nsentences expressing it. You do know that Mike is Jack the\nRipper by knowing that Mike is Mike, for it’s the same\nproposition. But you will assent to, or assert, only the sentence that\nreports your knowledge in the trivial clothing. Then, the ancients\nbelieved that Hesperus is Phosphorus, Tama fears that all woodchucks\nare woodchucks, and so on. If you think otherwise, it’s because\nyou confuse belief reports with reports of linguistic practices.\nRipley (2012) argues that it’s difficult to account for\nphenomena concerning such attitude reports by throwing them in the box\nof pragmatics and conversational implicatures: failures of\nsubstitutivity salva veritate behave in systematics ways in\ncontexts of iterated embeddings, and this calls for a systematic,\ncompositional treatment. \nSalmon also resorts to a distinction between “semantically\nencoded” and “pragmatically imparted information”\n(Salmon 1986: 78) for the “Mike is Mike” vs. “Mike\nis Jack the Ripper” cases. He introduces different\nrepresentational guises under which one can have attitudes to the\nproposition expressed by different sentences. For direct reference to\nwork, we need [Mike] to be [Jack the Ripper], but we can allow\nMike-guises to differ from Jack-the-Ripper-guises, and claim that\n(de dicto) intentional attitudes are relations to\npropositions mediated by guises: Lois Lane loves Kal-El under the\nguise of Superman, not under the guise of Clark Kent. Guises\ndon’t belong in semantics but in pragmatics, and don’t\ndetermine denotations. \nSalmon’s view can in principle account for compositional\nphenomena involving embeddings. It has been criticized because of\nthis: Forbes (1987) argues that guises look too much like Fregean\nsenses in disguise. Branquinho (1990) argues that the correspondence\nmay not reduce Salmon’s account to a relabelled Fregean\nview. \nGuises are supposed to be mobilized within attitude reports. Beyond\nattitude reports, as argued by Ripley (2012), Jago (2014), there are\nhyperintensional phenomena involving indicative and counterfactual\nconditionals structuralism doesn’t seem to handle. As Jago\n(2014: 76–7) has it, we can be at the 1972 Ziggy Stardust Tour\nand wonder if Ziggy is David Bowie. We come up with the following: \nAll of (1)–(4) have metaphysically impossible antecedents. (1)\nand (3) are plausibly false (unless one is a vacuist: see Williamson\n2007), but (2) and (4) are trivial truths. (A nonvacuist conditional\nsemantics using impossible worlds delivers just these results: see\nBerto et al. 2018.) But the structuralist has (1)–(2) and\n(3)–(4), respectively, express the same propositions, given that\n[Ziggy] = [Bowie]. If conditionals in general, or even only\ncounterfactuals, don’t involve intentionality, guises will offer\nlittle help if they are not supposed to come into play here. However,\nthere are treatments of conditionality along the lines of epistemic\nmodals (Kratzer 1986; Lycan 2001), and the Russellian structuralist\nmay appeal to one of them, or come up with a new one. \nCould a broadly Fregean account of structured propositions do\nbetter? In this view, we don’t take the constituents of\nstructured propositions as denotations (think objects and properties),\nrather as Fregean senses. Much now depends on how these are\nunderstood. If they are taken à la Carnap, as functions from\nthe possible worlds of SPWS to extensions, there is little hope to\naccount for “Mike is Mike” vs. “Mike is Jack the\nRipper” cases. Now [Mike] and [Jack the Ripper] are functions\nfrom possible worlds to individuals; but unless one clashes with the\nKripkean criticisms of descriptivism on names (Kripke 1980), they had\nbetter be constant functions: given that they both actually pick out\nMike, they should output Mike at all possible worlds (at which Mike\nexists). But then [Mike] and [Jack the Ripper] will be defined on the\nsame set of things and will give the same output for any input. \nOne may enlarge or change the set of circumstances that provides the\ninputs, admitting metaphysically impossible situations where Mike is\ndistinct from Jack the Ripper, and have the two as the outputs of\n[Mike] and [Jack the Ripper] there, respectively. But then, as\nremarked by Ripley (2012) and Jago (2014) again, it is not so much\nstructuralism that does the job of giving the required\nhyperintensional distinctions, but rather the fact that we are not\nworking (only) with standard (metaphysically) possible worlds\nanymore. \nA recent interesting proposal to improve on the Fregean situation\ncomes from Hawke (2018), combining a theory of subject matter with a\nstructuralist account of propositions resorting to\nFregean-senses-lookalikes. Subject matter sensitivity allows Hawke to\nmake hyperintensional distinction unavailable to standard Fregean\nstructuralism. \nOne logically sophisticated, neo-Fregean structured account, offering\na systematic analysis of a range of hyperintensional phenomena, is the\nTransparent Intensional Logic approach. The view, pioneered\nby Tichý (1968, 1971, 1988), treats the meanings of expressions\nas given by structural procedures, called constructions,\nbuilt out of entities that are somewhat like Fregean senses. In\nparticular, different names and different predicates, even if they\nnecessarily co-designate, may be associated with different senses, so\nthe meanings of “Robin Hood” and “Robin of\nLocksley”, or of “furze” and “gorse”,\nmay be distinct even if those meanings are not built up out of others.\nThis gives the system resources to handle many hyperintensional\ncontexts straightforwardly. In particular, it manages to give a\npowerful compositional account where other approaches have to resort\nto pragmatics. The approach is less popular than it should be in\ncontemporary semantics, possibly due its resorting to a technical\napparatus of typed lambda-calculus. For hyperintensional applications\nand a comprehensive discussion of Transparent Intensional Logic, see\nDuží, Jespersen, and Materna (2010) and Duží\nand Jespersen (2015). \nWe mention one final, recent proposal in the Fregean camp, by Skipper\nand Bjerring (2020). This pivots on another Fregean notion, namely\nthat of cognitive equipollence: \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are\ncognitively equipollent when one cannot rationally regard either as\ntrue and the other as false (see Schellenberg 2012). This gives a\ncognitive or epistemic notion of sentential meaning which, the authors\nclaim, is more fine-grained than SPWS intensions, but less than\nextra-fine-grained extended (e.g., impossible) worlds semantics. \nA final family of approaches to hyperintensionality to be discussed is\nthe algebraic. Algebraic approaches to semantics typically do not try\nto give an account of meaning in terms of anything else at all.\nInstead, they treat meanings as primitive and focus on the\nrelationships between them to give a semantic theory. \nBy defining in a direct way how the meanings of different parts of\nlanguage go together to yield sentence meanings, these approaches are\nnot under pressure to identify the meanings of sentences true in all\nthe same possible circumstances, or even sentences which are logically\nequivalent. So it is easy to see how a general algebraic approach can\nmake room for hyperintensional differences between parts of language.\nEven if sentence meanings are necessarily equivalent, if they relate\ndifferently to a “believes that” operator they do not have\nto be substitutable in “John believes that \\(A\\)”\ncontexts. Bealer (1979) touts this flexibility as an advantage in\ndealing with puzzles like the semantics of belief attributions, as\ndoes Menzel (1993). \nSome algebraic approaches do not take as much advantage of this\nflexibility as one might expect with respect to hyperintensionality\npuzzles. Keenan and Faltz (1984)’s algebraic approach identifies\nnecessary equivalents. Bacon (2018) adopts a Boolean account in which\nthe propositions associated with logical equivalents in predicate\nlogic are identified with each other (e.g., the proposition that\n\\({\\sim}({\\sim}A \\lor {\\sim}B)\\) is identical to the proposition that\n\\((A \\land B))\\). This leaves room for distinguishing merely\nnecessarily equivalent propositions, e.g., the proposition that\n\\(2+2=4\\) and the proposition that it rains if and only if it rains.\nBut it does little to help with cases where we want to discriminate\nbetween logical equivalents: if we were to think that \\(A\\) explains\nwhy \\({\\sim}{\\sim}A\\), or capture the belief content of the confused\nman who believes something of the form \\((A \\land B)\\) but does not\nbelieve \\({\\sim}({\\sim}A \\lor {\\sim}B)\\). So it is not the algebraic\napproach per se that yields solutions to particular puzzles\nabout hyperintensionality, but the algebraic approach combined with\ntheoretical choices about the structure of the algebra. \nAlgebraic approaches are largely silent on the question of what\nmeanings are, and how meanings come to stand in the relations they do.\n(Or, if every structure of relations between meanings can be found\nsomewhere in Platonic heaven, how we come to be associated with our\nparticular structure rather than others.) Of course, theories which\nsay more about the nature of meanings (e.g., that they are\nset-theoretic constructions from worlds, or they are ordered sets of\nobjects and properties) also face the challenge of explaining\nhow our concrete practices explain which structures of meanings are\nassociated with our speech and writing. So it may be that these\nconcerns are general, and algebraic semantics can employ the same\nkinds of answers to these questions as their rivals. \nA close relative of algebraic theories is the object theory of Zalta\n(1988). It also supplies distinct fine-grained meanings to, e.g., be\nthe suitably distinct inputs so that “John believes all\ntriangles have internal angles that add up to 180°” and\n“John believes all trilaterals have internal angles that add up\nto 180°” express different propositions. Zalta says a little\nmore about the identity conditions of his\nhyperintensionally-distinguished properties: according to Zalta,\nproperties are identical if and only if they are encoded by\nthe same objects. \nAlgebraic accounts of meaning may have little to say about worldly\nhyperintensionality. There is nothing in the general motivations of\nalgebraic theories that would rule out the hypothesis that we need\nhyperintensional language to best capture the non-representational\naspects of reality, but nor does there appear to be anything in the\ngeneral motivations that would indicate why we would, or how that\nmight manifest in our language. This is not really an objection to\nalgebraic approaches, however. One might think that a theory of\nmeaning should be silent on substantive questions about what\nthe world is like. We do not want our theory of meaning to tell us\nwhich physics or chemical theory to adopt. Likewise, it might be good\nfor a theory of meaning to be neutral about how to understand\nessences, or intrinsicness of properties, or causation. Of course, a\ntheory of meaning may not be able to be completely neutral about\nmetaphysical questions—it should have something to say about\nwhat meanings are, whether there are abstract representations, and so\non—but perhaps algebraic theories not taking a stand on worldly\nhyperintensionality is an attractive feature rather than a\ndrawback.","contact.mail":"dnolan2@nd.edu","contact.domain":"nd.edu"}]
