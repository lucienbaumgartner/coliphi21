In his relatively\nshort life, he authored an extraordinary series of dramas, including\nThe Robbers, Maria Stuart, and the trilogy\nWallenstein. He was also a prodigious poet, composing perhaps\nmost famously the “Ode to Joy” featured in the culmination\nof Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony and enshrined, some two centuries\nlater, in the European\n Hymn.[1]\n In part through his celebrated friendship with Goethe, he edited\nepoch-defining literary journals and exerted lasting influence on\nGerman stage production. He is sometimes referred to as the German\nShakespeare; his are still among the most widely produced German plays\nboth in Germany and internationally.\n\n\nIn addition to his literary accomplishments, Schiller was a formidable\nphilosophical thinker. Between 1791 and 1796, he authored a range of\ntheoretical works that are both sophisticated and original. These\nwritings primarily concern aesthetics, but they stake out notable\npositions on ethics, metaphysics, ontology, and political theory as\nwell. Together, his essays helped shape one of the most prolific\nperiods of German philosophizing; since then, they have served as a\nsignificant source of philosophical insight from an aesthetic\npractitioner of the highest standing.\n\nBorn in 1759 in Marbach am Neckar, Schiller showed such early\nintellectual promise that he was recruited by Karl Eugen, Duke of\nWürttemberg, to attend his military academy. There Schiller was\nbroadly educated, including in medicine, and became an army doctor in\n1780. But his interests always lay in more humanistic subjects.\nAlready in 1777, he had published his first poem; soon thereafter, he\nbegan composing dramas. The revolutionary mood of the age, combined\nwith his deep objections to the Duke’s tyrannical rule, prompted\na passion for freedom already evident in his first play, The\nRobbers [Die Räuber], whose protagonists defy\nsocial norms at the expense of their own lives. The play premiered in\nMannheim in 1782, achieved instant success, and quickly earned\nSchiller international fame. The Duke, alarmed at Schiller’s\nrevolutionary tendencies, had him arrested and forbade further\nplaywriting. Schiller responded by fleeing to Mannheim to begin his\nliterary career in earnest (Martinson 2005a: 2; Sharpe 1991:\nviii). \nIn the succeeding decade, Schiller authored plays and other literary\nworks, composed dozens of poems, and authored two major histories, one\nof the Dutch rebellion against the Spanish and one of the Thirty\nYears’ War. As his fame grew, Schiller was appointed professor\nof history at the University of Jena where he lectured on both history\nand aesthetics. The Robbers’ message of liberation from\npolitical corruption had meanwhile been so influential that the new\nFrench Republic made Schiller an honorary citizen in 1792. But like\nmany of his contemporaries, Schiller’s enthusiasm for the French\nRevolution turned to horror as the Terror began. His political\ndisillusionment was coupled with both a serious illness and a crisis\nof self-confidence in his playwriting. Schiller had already\nexperimented with philosophical prose, but this crisis inspired him to\nturn his attention fully to philosophy in the hopes of both recovering\nhis health through quiet contemplation and of gaining philosophical\ninsights that would reignite his literary talents.\n [2]\n A small pension provided by the Duke of Sachsen-Weimar made his\ntemporary withdrawal from the theater and academic life financially\npossible, and it was during this period that most of Schiller’s\nremarkable theoretical output took place. \nSchiller began his philosophical retreat with a thorough study of Kant\nand was immediately inspired by Kant’s description of human\nfreedom. In 1793, he wrote to his friend Christian Gottfried\nKörner: “It is certain that no mortal has spoken a\ngreater word than this Kantian word … determine yourself from\nwithin yourself” (NA XXVI, 191/KL 153). But Schiller was left\ndissatisfied with two of Kant’s claims as regards aesthetics:\none, that there could be no objective principle of beauty, and two,\nthat aesthetic experience refers only to pleasure felt by the subject,\nnot to any property of the object. In letters to Körner, which he\nnever published but after his death became known as the “Kallias\nLetters” [“Kalliasbriefe”], he set out to\ncorrect these Kantian claims and to place aesthetics on a more secure,\nindependent, and critical foundation. \nSchiller proposes to discover the objective principle of beauty\nfollowing the procedure of Kant’s transcendental deduction: by\nasking what our ability to perceive beauty reveals about our mental\nfaculties. He concludes that humans must possess two forms of reason:\ntheoretical and practical. Theoretical reason connects\n“representation with representation to gain knowledge” (NA\nXXVI, 179/KL 149). If theoretical reason is applied to concepts, it\nproduces logical judgments. If it is applied to intuitions, it\nproduces teleological judgments. Practical reason, by contrast,\nconnects “representation with the will in order to act”\n(NA XXVI, 179/KL 149). Its principle is autonomy or freedom. If\npractical reason is applied to free actions, it produces moral\njudgments. If it is applied to “unfree effects”—in\nother words, to objects in the world—it produces\naesthetic judgments (NA XXVI, 183/KL 152). Judging something\nbeautiful implies that we have encountered the appearance of freedom\nin empirical experience. As Schiller puts it: since practical\nreason’s principle is freedom, beauty is “thus nothing\nless than freedom in appearance” (NA XXVI, 183/KL 152; Schindler\n2008: 93–4). \nBut what would freedom in appearance actually look like, and how could\nwe identify it? Schiller names two qualities that appear in the object\nitself that prompt us to judge it beautiful. The first, he says, is\nthe “being-determined-through-itself of the thing”: a\nsense that it is not determined by outside forces but is rather\nself-determining, existing only “through itself” (NA XXVI,\n192/KL 154). As an example, Schiller contrasts a workhorse to a\nSpanish palfrey. The workhorse \ntrots just as tiredly and clumsily as if it were still pulling a\nwagon, even when it is not pulling one. Its movement no longer springs\nfrom its nature but rather reveals the pulled weight of the wagon. (NA\nXXVI, 204/KL 163–4) \nThe palfrey, by contrast, moves lightly and appears to weigh nothing:\nits movements are “an effect of its nature than has been left to\nitself” (NA XXVI, 205/KL 164). This, Schiller says, is a kind of\nautonomy: the palfrey is determined by its own nature, not by gravity\nor function. The beauty of animals generally decreases the more they\nappear determined by gravity, not form: in the case of a light-footed\nhorse, form masters matter; in the case of a duck, matter masters form\n(NA XXVI, 205/KL 164). This analysis allows Schiller to extend his\nclaim that aesthetic judgments are, like moral judgments, a product of\npractical, not theoretical, reason. Moral actions are self-determining\nbecause they follow the form of the moral law, never accounting for\nexternal factors. If something in the sensible world appears to be\nsimilarly self-determining, it will be “an analogy of\nthe pure determination of the will” and so an\n“exhibition of freedom” (NA XXVI, 192/KL 154).\nSchiller concludes that \n[s]elf-determination of the rational is pure determination of reason,\nmorality; self-determination of the sense-world is pure determination\nof nature, beauty. (NA XXVI, 195/KL 156) \nBut such self-determination is not yet enough to distinguish the\nhighest beauty: the beautiful object’s form must not only be\nself-determining according to some external form but determine that\nform as well. Schiller articulates this distinction in Kantian terms:\nacting freely according to one’s form is autonomous; being the\nsource of the form according to which one acts is heautonomous,\nliterally self self-governing (Beiser 2005: 67; Roehr 2003: 120;\nSchindler 2008: 95). Heautonomy in other words occurs when the rule in\nquestion is “both given and obeyed by the thing”\n(NA XXVI, 208/KL 167). Beauty is thus found in a landscape “if\nall of the particular parts out of which it is constituted play along\ntogether so well that they set their own limitations” (NA XXVI,\n213/KL 171), or in a dance in which dancers interact “so\nskillfully and yet so artlessly that both seem merely to be following\ntheir own mind” (NA XVI, 216–7/KL 174). The qualities of being\nautonomous and heautonomous, Schiller claims, persist in the object\nwhether it is being observed or not. This assertion allows Schiller to\nachieve his second goal of locating beauty in the object rather than\nonly in the observing subject. \nSchiller also suggests that when we call an action beautiful, it is\nbecause it too exhibits a spontaneous self-determination that seems to\nspring from the actor’s essence. To illustrate this claim, he\noffers five variations on Jesus’ parable of the Good Samaritan.\nA man has been beaten, robbed, and left to die on the side of the\nroad. Four strangers offer assistance, but in each case, their offer\nis badly motivated: by prudence or greed or out of a tortured sense of\nduty. The fifth man by contrast offers, of his own accord, to abandon\nhis own belongings and carry the wounded man to safety. We call this\nman’s action beautiful, Schiller says, because he “forgot\nhimself in his action” and “fulfilled his duty with the\nease of someone acting out of mere instinct”. In a word,\nSchiller concludes, \na free action is a beautiful action, if the autonomy of the mind and\nautonomy of appearance coincide. For this reason the highest\nperfection of character in a person is moral beauty brought about by\nthe fact that duty has become its nature. (NA 198/KL 159;\nSchindler 2008: 93–4; Winegar 2013: 283–4) \nSchiller himself did not consider this deduction of beauty a success,\nand most of his critics have agreed (Beiser 2005: 61). The status of\nhis claim that beauty is freedom in appearance is also not clear:\nBeiser for instance claims it is regulative since neither autonomy nor\nheautonomy can appear in the natural world, while Houlgate claims that\nthe quality of being “not-determined-from-the-outside” can\nactually be found in the object (Beiser 2005: 63; Houlgate 2008:\n37–49; Schindler 2008: 87). But Schiller’s contention that\naesthetic judgment falls in the provenance of practical rather than\ntheoretical reason laid the groundwork for his later depiction of\naesthetic aspects to moral action, and his use of form as a dynamic\nconcept is credited with offering a plausible alternative to\nKant’s subjectivist description of aesthetic experience\n(Schindler 2008, Falduto 2020). \nSchiller’s “Kallias Letters” left many themes\nunresolved, but the possibility of an aesthetic aspect to moral\naction, articulated in the fifth variation of his Good Samaritan\nstory, became the major subject of his 1793 essay “On Grace and\nDignity” [“Über Anmut und\nWürde”]. Using grace and dignity as concepts capable\nof bridging the divide between morality and aesthetics, Schiller in\nthis essay grapples with a question formulated by Kant, namely how\nduty and inclination can combine in our assessment of moral\n worth.[3] \nSchiller begins the essay with an analysis of an ancient Greek myth\ndepicting Venus, the goddess of beauty. According to this myth, Venus\npossesses a belt that could impart grace to those who wore it, even if\nthey themselves were not beautiful (NA XX, 252/GD 124). Grace is thus\nassociated with but not synonymous with beauty: a person need not be\nbeautiful to be graceful. Since the belt is a transferable accessory,\nthe grace it bestows, Schiller continues, is contingent, not part of\nthe wearer’s essence. But it is also objective; it exists\nwhether or not it is being perceived. Since “movement is the\nonly change an object can undergo without altering its\nidentity”, Schiller concludes that grace must designate\n“beauty of movement” (NA XX, 253/GD 125; Curran 2005: 26).\nThe Greeks also restricted grace to humans, meaning to those capable\nof moral sentiments (NA XX, 254/GD 126). Whereas natural objects\ncannot take credit for their beauty, then, grace implies an expression\nof human freedom and is an instance of “personal\nmerit”. Grace, Schiller concludes, is “beauty of form\nunder freedom’s influence” (NA XX 264/GD 133–4). \nGraceful actions, Schiller claims, present us with a paradox. On the\none hand, as instances of freedom, they are deliberately undertaken\nmovements. On the other hand, they appear to be natural and even\ninstinctive. Schiller accounts for this paradox by distinguishing\nbetween two kinds of action. Our rational natures allow us to engage\nin voluntary actions in direct response to our free will. But we also\nundertake actions that, despite being directed by the will, appear\ninvoluntary. These actions Schiller calls “sympathetic”:\nthey occur “at the behest” of moral sentiment as opposed\nto natural instinct (NA XX, 266/GD 135–6; Deligiorgi 2006: 13).\nActing according to the objectively determined moral law still\ndetermines an action’s moral worth, according to Schiller, who\ndescribes himself as “completely of one mind with the most\nrigorous moralists” (NA XX, 283/GD 149). But an action\ncan be graceful in addition to being morally worthy if it seems to\nfollow naturally from an agent’s disposition, motivated by\nfeelings that are themselves the product of her character. Grace thus\ndescribes the way we act as opposed to the reasons we give for our\nactions: it is an expression of our “moral attitude” (NA\nXX, 272/GD 140). Being determined in this way by disposition allows an\naction to appear both necessary and natural to the point that the\nperson does not seem “conscious of possessing\ngrace” (NA XX, 269/GD 138). \nSchiller calls a person who lives in this state of grace a\n“beautiful soul”. In such a case, \nthe ethical sense has at last so taken control of all a person’s\nfeelings that it can leave affect to guide the will without hesitation\nand is never in danger of standing in contradiction of its decisions.\n(NA XX, 287/GD 152) \nA beautiful soul “carries out humankind’s most exacting\nduties with such ease that they might simply be the actions of its\ninner instinct” (NA XX, 287/152); it can obey reason “with\njoy”, not “discard it like a burden” (NA XX, 283/GD\n149). Grace, in short, bridges the Kantian divide: “It is in a\nbeautiful soul that sensuousness and reason, duty and inclination are\nin harmony, and grace is their expression as appearance” (NA XX,\n288/GD 153). Because we recognize in the beautiful soul an image of\nhuman perfection, such harmony elicits our approval and love (NA XX,\n302/GD 165). \nIn embodying this kind of perfection, grace provides evidence of a\nunity of the moral and aesthetic that Kantian philosophy, in the\nprocess of making its conceptual distinctions, provisionally disrupts.\nOnce we understand the underlying unity that grace suggests, however,\nwe can correct the excesses brought about by Kant’s rigorous\nseparation of reason and inclination. In addition to better reflecting\nmetaphysical truth, emphasizing the unity of the moral and the\naesthetic, Schiller thinks, will produce better results. Brutally\nsuppressing our sensual side will not be successful in the long\nrun: \nThe enemy who has been merely laid low can get up again, but\nthe one who is reconciled has been truly overcome. (NA XX,\n284/GD 150) \nAlthough Schiller describes the beautiful soul as an ideal of human\nharmony, he acknowledges that circumstances sometimes make that\nharmony impossible. Because humans are natural creatures, they are\nsusceptible to pleasure and pain. But whereas other animals are\nmotivated solely by this susceptibility, humans in addition have\nreason. We also have a “suprasensual faculty”, namely the\nwill, which is subject neither to nature nor to reason (NA XX, 290/GD\n155; Roehr 2003:\n 126).[4]\n This means that while animals must fight to free themselves from\npain, humans “can decide to hold on to it” (NA XX, 290/GD\n155). When pain threatens to force a human to act against reason, her\nethical nature must resist (NA XX, 293/GD 157–8). In such a\nmoment, harmony is impossible and the person in question cannot\nachieve moral beauty. But such a moment also creates the possibility\nof a “moral greatness” that gives “evidence of\nsuperiority of the higher faculties over the sensuous” (NA XX,\n294/GD 158). In refusing to succumb to pain, “the beautiful soul\nbecomes heroic” and “transforms into a sublime\nsoul” (NA XX, 294/GD 158). The appearance of such a soul, its\nembodiment in action, is not grace but dignity. \nAs an example, Schiller imagines someone whose extreme physical pain\nis evident in his body. His “veins swell, his muscles become\ncramped and taut, his voice cracks, his chest is thrust out, and his\nlower body pressed in”. By contrast, however, “his\nintentional movements are gentle, the facial features relaxed, and the\neyes and brow serene” (NA XX, 296/GD 159). This composure in the\nmidst of pain gives us evidence of “a power independent of\nsuffering” and even “peace in suffering”. It is this\npeace, Schiller says, that defines dignity (NA XX, 296/GD 160).\nSchiller here qualifies his earlier claim that the beautiful soul\nrepresented humans’ highest achievement: when grace and dignity\nare united in the same person, he now claims, “then the\nexpression of humanity is complete in that person” (NA XX,\n300/GD 163). \nSchiller’s response to Kant’s depiction of duty and\ninclination was taken up by none other than Kant himself, who in\nReligion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason devoted a\nfootnote to clarifying his position (48–9). “On Grace and\nDignity” has thus been much discussed in Kant scholarship both\nas a possible contribution to Kantian theories of moral psychology and\nas supporting the possibility of a Kant-based ethics of character\n(Baxley 2010; Deligiorgi 2011; Winegar 2013). The essay has also been\npraised for further developing the possibility of an aesthetic aspect\nto moral action; Schiller’s attention to ways moral action might\nappear is credited with foregrounding the role of appearances in our\nacquisition of knowledge (Curran and Fricker 2005: 4; Deligiorgi\n2006). \nIn several essays on tragedy, some of which predate his period of\nintense philosophical engagement, Schiller continued to refine his\nthoughts on human dignity in the face of suffering. In “On the\nArt of Tragedy” [“Über die tragische\nKunst”], published in 1792, Schiller begins with a fact\nabout humans, namely that we sometimes derive pleasure from witnessing\nothers’\n suffering.[5]\n Again Schiller asks: what must be true of us in order for this fact\nto be possible? In answer, Schiller draws on the Kantian distinction\nbetween reason and sensibility. The moral law, he continues, is\nobjectively true and autonomously constructed, whereas our senses\nproduce states we passively suffer. Because we know this, instances in\nwhich we respond to conflict by mastering our emotions in deference to\nthe moral law give us pleasure. Struggle against our sensuous natures\nin order to act autonomously, in other words, allows us to witness\nwhat is most impressive about humans, namely our free will. That\nexperience gives us pleasure: “the very assault on our sensuous\nlife”, Schiller says, “is the condition for igniting that\npower of mind whose activity produces the pleasure” (NA XX,\n152/E 5). \nBecause we recognize our ability to overcome our sensuous nature as\nthe highest expression of our humanity, observing someone else\nstruggle and triumph over her emotions makes us sympathize with her,\nand this sympathy also gives us pleasure. In this early essay, then,\nSchiller defines tragedy as the art that imitates nature in those\nactions most apt to arouse sympathy. In other words, it is the art\nform that evokes the universal pleasure humans experience when\ntriumphing over their sensuous nature (NA XX, 153–4/E 6). \nSchiller follows these philosophical considerations with advice to\nfellow tragedians, promising to isolate the “conditions under\nwhich the pleasure of the emotion would be produced with the most\ncertainty and the greatest force” (NA XX, 154/E 6). A tragedy\nwill fail both if the audience’s sympathy is too weak and if it\nis too strongly aroused and replaced by outrage at the instigator of\nthe suffering (NA XX, 154/E 7). The best tragedies will evoke both an\nunavoidable moral conflict and the hero’s willing embrace of it\n(NA XX, 156–7/E 9). The images of suffering that tragedy\npresents should be lively and vivid; they should strike us as\nuniversally true; the plot must allow the suffering to build momentum\nbut also be balanced and varied (NA XX, 159–164/E 11–14).\nThe most successful tragedian will use these and other principles to\nstimulate compassion with suffering that gives evidence of\nhumans’ highest calling (NA XX, 165–67/E 16–18). \n“On the Sublime: Toward the Further Development of Some Kantian\nThemes” [“Vom Erhabenen: Zur weitern Ausführung\neiniger Kantischen Ideen”], published in 1793, takes, as\npromised, a decidedly Kantian turn. Building on distinctions made in\n“On Grace and Dignity”, Schiller here abandons sympathy as\ntragedy’s defining characteristic and replaces it with a version\nof Kant’s sublime. Kant describes the sublime as an essentially\nmixed emotion: it combines humans’ fear in the face of infinite\npower with pride in their ability to conceptualize that infinity or\nwithstand that power. Schiller similarly reports that we call an\nobject sublime if \nour sensuous nature feels its limits, but our rational nature feels\nits superiority, its freedom from limits. Thus, we come up short\nagainst a sublime object physically, but we elevate ourselves\nabove it morally, namely, through ideas. (NA XX, 171/E\n22) \nRoughly tracking Kant’s distinction between the mathematically\nand dynamically sublime, Schiller divides the sublime into the\ntheoretical and the practical. The theoretical sublime presents nature\nas an object of knowledge and indicates that we “can\nthink more than we know”; it describes for instance the\nmixture of fear and awe we experience when conceptualizing infinity\n(NA XX, 173/E 24). The practically sublime, by contrast, concerns\nnature as an object of feeling, specifically as a source of danger and\nfear. But in being confronted by a storm or natural disaster, we also\nbecome aware of our power to remain calm in the face of danger. Such\nexperiences isolate moments at which the individual has recourse only\nto his “intellectual self, to the inner self-sufficiency of his\nrational powers” (NA XX, 177/E 28). They allow resistance on a\n“completely different order”, showing our sensuous being\nto be an “external, natural thing that has no effect at all on\nwhat we genuinely are as persons, our moral selves” (NA XX,\n185/E 35). They thus allow us to acknowledge that as sensual beings,\nwe are never safe from disease, loss, and death, but we know that we\ncan face even our own annihilation with dignified calm. Human beings\ncan also be what Schiller calls magnificent: they can, through\nphysical or mental prowess, defeat what they fear. The sublime, by\ncontrast, shows humans succumbing to the fearful but not fearing it.\nBecause of what it says about our moral selves, observing such\ndignified defeat somewhat paradoxically inspires us even more than the\nmagnificent human’s triumph. Schiller further distinguishes\nbetween the “contemplative sublimity of power”, which\nincludes our terror in the face of silence or the dark, and “the\npathetically sublime”, which requires us to witness suffering.\nBut the basic requirements for a representation of the sublime remain\nthe same: it must include an objective, physical power; subjective,\nphysical impotence; and subjective or moral security in the face of\nthat impotence (NA XX, 186/E 36). \nIn “Concerning the Sublime” [“Über das\nErhabene”], drafted between 1794 and 1796, Schiller\ncontinues to develop his claim that the sublime displays humanity at\nits most noble. Nothing, he says, “is so beneath the dignity of\nhuman beings as to suffer violence, for it destroys the\nindividual’s humanity”; the person who, confronting\nviolence, “cowardly suffers it, tosses his humanity aside”\n(NA XX, 38/E 70). But despite the fact that the forces that can\ninflict violence on humans are legion, resistance is possible: even\nwhen the agent cannot surmount these forces physically, he can resist\nthem “idealistically, when he takes a step beyond\nnature and thereby negates the concept of brute force in regard to\nhimself” (NA XX, 39/E 71). Counterintuitively, this means\naccepting the suffering and, in the process, transforming it into\nvoluntary submission. Such a moment is a mix of anguish and happiness\nwhich is “preferred by noble souls over all pleasure”\nsince it “establishes our moral self-sufficiency in an\nirrefutable manner” (NA XX, 42/E 74). The “capacity to\nfeel the sublime”, Schiller concludes, “is thus one of the\nmost glorious dispositions in human nature” (NA XX, 52/E\n83). \nThe fact that the sublime can provide this evidence of our autonomy,\nSchiller continues, means that it offers something beauty cannot. The\nbeautiful character lives in harmony with herself, finding\n“pleasure in the exercise of justice, charity, temperance,\nfortitude, and fidelity” (NA XX, 39/E 75). But such a person, if\nnever tested, may never become aware of her moral powers. We should,\nthen, be grateful for personal or historical events that disrupt\nbeauty and produce the sublime since without sublime experiences,\n“beauty would make us forget our dignity” (NA XX, 53/E\n84). Here Schiller reiterates his claim that the beautiful and the\nsublime together complete human nature: \nOnly if the sublime is married to the beautiful and our sensitivity to\nboth has been shaped in equal measure, are we complete citizens of\nnature, without on that account being its slaves, and without\nsquandering our citizenship in the intelligible world. (NA XX, 53/E\n84) \nAchieving this completeness requires practice, and art can provide us\nwith that practice. When we encounter actual misfortune, we may find\nourselves defenseless and easily overwhelmed. By contrast, “the\nartificial misfortune of the pathetic”—in other words,\nwitnessing suffering in an artistic context—“finds us\nfully equipped, and, since it is merely imagined, the self-sufficient\nprinciple in our minds gets room to assert its absolute\nindependence” (NA XX, 51/E 82). The more we practice this\nindependence aesthetically, the more adept we will be at executing it\nin real life: witnessing tragedy as an art form, in short, is an\n“inoculation against unavoidable fate”; it allows us to\npractice sublime emotions such that when confronted with actual\ntragedy, we can react to it as if it were a performance and moderate\nour emotional responses accordingly. Of such an accomplishment,\nSchiller enthuses that “a human being can soar no higher!”\n(NA XX, 51/E 83). \nSchiller takes up the question of the aesthetic value of suffering\nmore specifically in “On the Pathetic”\n[“Über das Pathetische,” sometimes\ntranslated “On Tragic Pity”]. “Portrayal of\nsuffering—as mere suffering—is never the end of\nart”, he says, “but as a means to this end it is of the\nutmost importance to art” (NA XX, 196/E, 45). This is again\nbecause suffering facilitates the moral response that reveals\nhumans’ freedom. The more suffering we see, the more freedom we\nstand to witness: Schiller writes that tragedy thus requires a\n“full salvo of suffering” (NA XX, 197/E 46). Once the\npathetic becomes sublime by eliciting this response of freedom, it\nceases to be merely pathetic and becomes aesthetic. \nTo provide an example of aesthetic suffering, Schiller refers to\nJohann Winckelmann’s famous description of the ancient statue of\nLaocoön. Even as serpents slay both him and his sons, the battle\nbetween his sensuous self and his spiritual self is visible on\nLaocoön’s brow, signaling that he has not abandoned himself\nto fear. The Aeneid’s evocation of the serpents that\npursue and ultimately overpower Laocoön provides another example:\ntheir approach is terrifying, but if \nin the course of this trembling we feel ourselves elevated, then it is\nbecause we become conscious that, even as a victim of this power, we\nwould have nothing to fear for ourselves insofar as we are free. (NA\nXX, 208/E 56) \nEvocations of the sublime can be more or less effective: the most\npowerful instances, Schiller says, are when a character chooses\nsuffering out of duty or as a means of atoning for a failure of duty\n(NA XX, 212/E 60). In such cases, it is not just the general human\ncapability for free action but “the use of this capability that\nwarrants our respect” (NA XX, 212/E 61). \nAny display of freedom in the face of suffering, even if that\nsuffering is for an immoral cause, elicits our admiration. This fact,\nSchiller submits, explains the possible disjunction between moral and\naesthetic judgment (NA XX, 213/E 61). The self-sacrifice of Leonidas\nat Thermopylae, for instance, elicits both a positive moral and a\npositive aesthetic judgment: \nJudged from a moral perspective, this action portrays for me the moral\nlaw being carried out in complete contradiction of instinct. Judged\naesthetically, it portrays to me the moral capability of a human\nbeing, independent of all coercion by instinct. (NA XX, 213/E 61) \nThe unnecessary self-immolation of Peregrinus Portheus, by contrast,\nelicits a negative moral judgment by needlessly violating the duty of\nself-preservation, but it generates a positive aesthetic judgment\nbecause “it testifies to a capacity of the will to withstand\neven the mightiest of all instincts, the instinct for\nself-preservation” (NA XX, 215/E 64). Moral and aesthetic\njudgments will, in any event, often conflict since moral rigor\ngenerally is in tension with the freedom we value both in artists and\ntheir creations (NA XX, 217/E 65). The more morally a character acts,\nin other words, the more she adheres to a law; the more she adheres to\na law, the less freely she acts and the less aesthetic interest she\ngenerates. As audience members, we would rather, Schiller concludes,\n“watch power and freedom expressed at the cost of lawfulness\nthan watch lawfulness expressed at the cost of power and\nfreedom” (NA XX, 220/E 68). \nSchiller’s depiction of tragedy as the triumph of the will over\nthe senses is echoed perhaps most famously in the struggle between the\nApollonian and Dionysian forces Nietzsche credits with producing\ntragedy in the first place (The Birth of Tragedy; Martin\n1996: 179–187). It has also generated praise and critique in\nmore contemporary theorizing. Hughes argues that Schiller’s\ndescription of the pleasure we take in tragedy successfully accounts\nfor several other theories, including that tragic heroes must show\ncourage (Walter Kaufmann); that tragedies foreground\n“comings-to-knowledge” and tragic flaws (Aristotle); that\nthey showcase conflict between two morally justified positions\n(Hegel); and that they include some kind of renunciation\n(Schopenhauer) (see Hughes 2015). By contrast, Gellrich suggests that\nSchiller’s use of the Kantian sublime to characterize tragedy\nplaces undue emphasis on the individual to the detriment of other\nfactors that should characterize tragedy (1988: ch. 4). Indeed,\nSchiller’s focus on the individual’s struggle as\ntragedy’s focal point puts him at odds with theories that\nemphasize either social aspects of tragedy or the political upheaval\nthat makes moments of sublime resistance more likely (Eagleton 2003:\n19, 110; Williams 1966: 44). Gardner in addition criticizes\nSchiller’s rationalized view of tragedy as a refusal to accept\nsuffering on its own terms and so as a denial of suffering’s\nsignificance (2003: 235). \nSchiller’s “Letters on the Aesthetic Education of\nMan” [“Über die ästhetische Erziehung des\nMenschen in einer Reihe von Briefen,” often referred to\nsimply as “Aesthetic Letters”] is perhaps his best-known\ntheoretical work. Published in his journal Horen in 1795 and\nwritten in the form of letters to his new patron, the Prince of\nSchleswig-Holstein-Augustenburg, they are dauntingly ambitious,\nencompassing a diagnosis of the French Revolution, a critique of the\nEnlightenment, a transcendental account of beauty, an analysis of\nhuman psychology, an assessment of art’s psychological and\npolitical importance, and an image of a new, ideal form of government\ndesigned to allow humans to reach their full potential. \nThe “Aesthetic Letters” begin with an almost despondent\nanalysis of the modern human\n condition.[6]\n The state is tottering, its “rotting foundations giving\nway”. Hopes for freedom and progress prove to be vain in the\nface of “crude, lawless instincts” among some citizens and\na “repugnant spectacle of lethargy” among others (NA XX,\n96/E 96). Schiller lauds the Greeks for their simple, harmonious\nrelation to their world and laments modern society’s enslavement\nto its manufactured needs. Recent history had shown with painful\nclarity that if the moral character of the people is not developed,\neven the most idealistic revolution will fail. A vicious cycle\nsuggests that without the state there can be no morality and without\nmorality there can be no state. Despite the Enlightenment’s\nlofty goals, Schiller laments, \nwe see the spirit of the age wavering between perversity and\nbrutality, between unnaturalness and mere nature, between superstition\nand moral unbelief; and it is only through an equilibrium of evils\nthat it is still sometimes kept within bounds. (NA XX, 320–21/E\n97) \nThe “moral possibility”, Schiller simply concludes,\n“is lacking”. \nAmong the culprits to be blamed for this condition are the\nEnlightenment’s over-emphasis on reason and its eschewing of\nsentiment—factors that Schiller suggests led to the French\nRevolution’s barbaric excesses. “The development of\nman’s capacity for feeling”, Schiller concludes,\n“is, therefore, the more urgent need of our age” (NA XX,\n332/E 107). What more specifically is needed is an instrument that can\ndevelop this capacity for feeling without neglecting humans’\nrational capacities. In Letter Nine he offers his solution:\n“This instrument is fine art” (NA XX, 333/E 108). The\nartist, then, is called upon to influence the world for the good,\nresisting the distractions of the present in the interest of humanity\nitself. Schiller exhorts his fellow artists to surround their\ncontemporaries with \nthe great and noble forms of genius, and encompass them about with the\nsymbols of perfection, until semblance conquer reality, and art\ntriumph over nature. (NA XX, 336/E 111) \nAt this point, however, Schiller admits a problem: historically\nspeaking, art has often had a corrupting effect. Perhaps we should\nresist being “delivered up to her enervating influence”\n(NA XX, 340/E 114). Before we draw this conclusion and abandon art as\na solution to the modern world’s ills, however, we must assess\nwhat definition of art we are using to evaluate its failures. But\nagainst what are we to assess historical definitions of art? Such an\ninquiry would seem to presuppose a concept of beauty; if that concept\nitself comes from historical examples, the question of how to evaluate\nart objectively remains unresolved. An adequate analysis of\nart’s potential, then, would seem to require an ahistorical\ndefinition of beauty. Again channeling Kant’s transcendental\nmethod, Schiller then suggests that “perhaps experience\nis not the judgment seat before which such an issue can be\ndecided” (NA XX, 340/E 114). Instead, any definition of beauty\nwould “have to be deduced from the sheer potentialities of our\nsensuo-rational nature” (NA XX, 340/E 115); the pursuit of\nbeauty requires a “pure concept of human nature as such”.\nSince this concept in turn cannot be derived from experience, we must\nfollow “the transcendental way” to truth (NA XX, 341/E\n115). \nSchiller thus begins, in Letter 11, with an examination of human\nnature. At the highest level of abstraction, he suggests, we find in\nhumans a distinction between the person and his condition or\n“the self and its determining attributes” (NA XX, 341/E\n115). The self Schiller associates with autonomous personhood,\nindependence, and form; our condition he associates with embodiment,\ndependence, and matter. These two fundamentally opposed sides do,\nhowever, coexist in humans, resulting in the imperative that they be\nbrought into harmony: each person is to “externalize all that is\nwithin him and give form to all that is outside him” (NA XX,\n344/E 118). \nIn Letter 12, Schiller claims that humans are impelled towards the\nfulfillment of this imperative by two corresponding drives, the form\ndrive [Formtrieb] and the sense drive\n [Sachtrieb].[7]\n The sense drive “proceeds from the physical existence of\nman” (NA XX, 344/E 118). It situates the human within time and\nso within change: \nman in this state is nothing but a unit of quantity, an occupied\nmoment of time—or rather, he is not at all, for his\npersonality is suspended as long as he is ruled by sensation. (NA XX,\n345/E 119) \nThe form drive by contrast affirms the person as constant throughout\nchange; it \nannuls time and annuls change. It wants the real to be necessary and\neternal, and the eternal and the necessary to be real. In other words,\nit insists on truth and on the right. (NA XX, 346/E 120) \nIn action, the form drive is concerned with dignity; the sense drive\nis concerned with self-preservation. In politics, the form drive\nresults in abstract principles; the sense drive results in\nlawlessness. \nIn Letter 14, Schiller suggests that when a human experiences both\nthese drives in balance—when he is “at once conscious of\nhis freedom and sensible of his existence” and can “feel\nhimself matter and come to know himself as mind”—a new\ndrive is awakened, namely the play drive [Spieltrieb] (NA XX,\n353/E 126). In the play drive, both other drives “work in\nconcert”: they are “directed toward annulling time\nwithin time, reconciling becoming with absolute being and\nchange with identity” (NA XX, 353/E 126). In holding the first\ntwo drives in harmony, the play drive frees humans of the domination\nof each: \nTo the extent that it deprives feelings and passions of their dynamic\npower, it will bring them into harmony with the ideas of reason; and\nto the extent that it deprives the laws of reason of their moral\ncompulsion, it will reconcile them with the interests of the senses.\n(NA XX, 352/E 127) \nIf this can be achieved, the human will be given “an intuition\nof his human nature, and the object that afforded him this vision\nwould become for him a symbol of his accomplished\ndestiny” (NA XX, 353/E 126). \nWhat, then, can awaken the play drive? In Letter 15, Schiller suggests\nthat each drive also has an object. The object of the sense drive is\nlife; the object of the form drive is form. Because the play drive\nallows these drives to act in concert, its object is living\nform [lebende Gestalt] (NA XX, 355/E 128). Living form,\nin turn, is nothing less than beauty. Beautiful objects, then, can put\nhumans in the state in which we realize our highest potential. When,\nto use Schiller’s example, we contemplate the Juno\nLudovisi, we feel our sense drive and our form drive perfectly\nequalized. In such a moment, “we find ourselves at one and the\nsame time in a state of utter repose and extreme agitation” (NA\nXX, 360/E 132). \nSince the contemplation of beauty leaves us dominated neither by the\nsense drive nor by the form drive, the play drive “gives rise to\nfreedom” (NA XX, 373/E 143); it allows the will, which\nexists independently of both drives, to choose between them (NA XX,\n371/E 142). This freedom does not correlate to our ability to\narticulate and follow the moral law. Freedom is rather the ability to\nsurvey both this law and our sensuous desires and choose between them.\nIn facilitating this ability and so enabling freedom, the\ncontemplation of beauty completes the concept of human nature (NA XX,\n355/E 128). So as soon as reason “utters the pronouncement: let\nhumanity exist, it has by that very pronouncement also promulgated the\nlaw: let there be beauty” (NA XX, 356/E 129). Play, Schiller\nthen reiterates, allows humans to fulfill their very natures:\n“man only plays when he is in the fullest sense of the word a\nhuman being, and he is only fully a human being when he\nplays” (NA XX, 359/E 131). \nBeauty’s ability to free our minds of determinations explains an\napparent paradox. On the one hand, beauty does not produce knowledge\nor build character (NA XX, 377/E 147). But on the other hand,\nprecisely because beauty accomplishes nothing, “something is\nachieved”; when our drives are brought into harmony, our will\ncan actually choose freely. So defined, the aesthetic state is\n“the most fruitful of all in respect of knowledge and\nmorality”; by committing neither to form nor to matter, it\ncontains maximum potential for both (NA XX, 379/E 148). “This\nlofty equanimity and freedom of the spirit, combined with power and\nvigor”, Schiller says, “is the mood in which a genuine\nwork of art should release us”; after witnessing such art, we\n“shall with equal ease turn to seriousness or to play, to repose\nor to movement, to compliance or to resistance” (NA XX, 380/E\n149). In facilitating this condition, beauty gives us the “gift\nof humanity itself”, Schiller says; it is our “second\ncreatress” (NA XX, 378/E 147–8). Our status as finite\ncreatures means that this state will remain only an ideal that each\nparticular art—music, painting, sculpture, etc.—must\nstruggle to approach in its own way (NA XX, 380–1/E\n149–50). But all genuine art will produce a state of equilibrium\nthat puts the will in a position of maximum power and\nself-determination (Beiser 2005: 155). \nThe kind of experiences required for each human to reach the aesthetic\ncondition will vary. To address this fact, Schiller postulates a\ndichotomy within beauty itself. Energizing beauty, he says, tenses us:\nit braces our nature and encourages prompt reaction. Such beauty is\nnecessary for the “sensuous man” who feels too much and\ncan be brought to equilibrium by exposure to form or thought. Melting\nbeauty, by contrast, releases: it relaxes our natures and is\nespecially necessary for the “spiritual man” who thinks\ntoo much and needs to be brought to beauty by his senses. Both kinds\nof beauty can be dangerous: energizing beauty can become extravagance,\nand melting beauty can result in stifled energy or emptiness (NA XX,\n360–2/E 133–4). But when they combine to produce a harmony\nthat cancels their respective extremes, they can allow individual\nhumans to reach their highest potential. \nBuilding on these distinctions, Schiller claims in Letter 24 that both\nindividual humans and humanity in general must follow three\ndevelopmental stages: physical, aesthetic, and moral (NA XX, 388/E\n156). In their initial natural state, humans are ruled by nature. When\nreason begins to stir, “man leaves the narrow confines of the\npresent in which mere animality stays bound, in order to strive\ntowards an unlimited future” (NA XX, 390/E 159). But because\nreason seems entirely opposed to natural life, its unconditional laws\nare experienced as only coercive: humans then either resist\nreason’s law, resorting to eudaemonism, or enslave themselves to\nit, denying their sensuous natures entirely (NA XX, 390–1/E\n158–9). Beauty, by contrast, can unite humans’ natural and\nrational sides; it can facilitate our entry into the “world of\nideas” but without leaving behind “the world of\nsense” (NA XX, 396/E 163). It can, then, convince us that the\nmoral law is not a foreign imposition and allow us to live in harmony\nwith its dictates. \nIn Letters 26 and 27, Schiller imagines the circumstances that must\nhave been necessary for early humans to develop an aesthetic sense.\nTraces of play can be found in nature whenever there is an abundance\nof resources: lions play when they have excess energy and are not\nunder threat; plants send out more shoots than necessary when they are\nadequately nourished, squandering energy “in a movement of\ncarefree joy” (NA XX, 406/E 173). Similar abundance among humans\ninspires “indifference to reality and interest in semblance\n[Schein]”: interest, that is, in a new layer of meaning\nand significance that humans recognize as their own creation.\nSemblance is positioned between “stupidity” and truth,\nboth of which “seek only the real” (NA XX, 399/E 165). A\nnature that delights in semblance, by contrast, is “no longer\ntaking pleasure in what it receives, but in what it does” (NA\nXX, 399/E 167; Sharpe 2005: 161–2). Semblance is evident in\nadorned weapons, the transition of movement into dance, and the\nevolution of desire into love. When we find such “traces of a\ndisinterested and unconditional appreciation of pure semblance”,\nthe people in question have “started to become truly\nhuman” (NA XX, 405/E 171–2). \nIn a final set of distinctions, Schiller somewhat suddenly applies his\ntripartite analysis to political states. In the “dynamic state\nof rights”, humans limit each other’s behavior through\nforce. In the “ethical state”, humans curb their desires\nout of respect for an abstract moral law. The third option Schiller\ncalls “the aesthetic state”, which, he claims, has the\nhighest potential since it “consummates the will of the whole\nthrough the nature of the individual” (NA XX, 410/E 176). In the\naesthetic state, citizens do their duty out of inclination, encourage\nthe balancing of their fellow citizens’ rational and sensual\ncapacities, and act as unified, harmonious human beings (Beiser 2005:\n163; Dahlstrom 2008: 101–2). In such a state, no privilege or\nautocracy can be tolerated. Schiller admits in the last paragraph that\n“such a state of aesthetic semblance” is rare but exists\nin “a few chosen circles” in which humans are governed by\ntheir aesthetic nature and so exist in freedom and cooperation with\nothers (NA XX, 412/E 178). \nThe ending to the Letters has left many readers confused and\ndissatisfied, as evidenced by its mostly unfavorable reception among\nSchiller’s contemporaries (Wilkinson and Willoughby cxxxiii ff).\nSchiller seems to be unclear regarding whether the aesthetic state is\nthe means to the achievement of full humanity or whether it\nis an end; he seems, in short, not to have answered one of his\noriginal questions, namely which must come first, a good state or good\ncitizens (Roehr 2003: 133–4; Sharpe 2005: 160). Schiller has\nalso been accused of encouraging elitism and a retreat into\napoliticism through his image of an aesthetic state, a charge most\npowerfully leveled in the next century by Marxist critics (Sharpe\n1995: 91). His theoretical movement from sensation to form, combined\nwith his genealogy of humans' development out of a\n“savage” state has been cited as contributing to a\n“racial regime of representation” that pervades Western\naesthetics (Lloyd 2019, 41–43, 72–74).  Others\nby contrast see the Letters as a testament to\nSchiller’s political engagement and republicanism (Beiser 2005:\n123 ff; López 2011; Moggach 2008; Schmidt 2009). There is, in\nany case, no doubt that the Aesthetic Letters were enormously\ninfluential. The concept of play has been taken up and developed by\nphilosophers such as Charles Sanders Peirce and Hans-Georg Gadamer\n(Wilkinson and Willoughby 1967: clxxxviii–ix; Gadamer 1975:\n101–34). The idea of play specifically as a cure for alienation\ninfluenced the Frankfurt School through the writings of Herbert\nMarcuse: indeed, according to Terry Eagleton, “[t]he whole\nradical aesthetic tradition from Coleridge to Herbert Marcuse …\ndraws sustenance from [Schiller’s] prophetic denunciation”\nof the modern condition (1990: 118; Marcuse 1955: 185–196; Guyer\n2008; Sharpe 1991: 90–92; Saranpa 2002: 70–8). Jürgen\nHabermas found in Schiller’s idea of an aesthetic state a vision\nof a “communicative, community-building, solidarity-giving force\nof art” (1985: 59–64), in which art is capable of\n“revolutionizing the conditions of mutual understanding”\n(1985: 46, 49): a vision that, however problematic, he sees as a\nsource of insight into the nature of modern politics. Samantha\nMatherne and Nick Riggle have recently argued for the relevance of\nSchiller's conceptions of both aesthetic value and freedom in the\nAesthetic Letters, characterizing his theory as “a\nnon-hedonic, action-oriented, communitarian” philosophy worth\nconsidering today (Matherne and Riggle 2020:1, 2021). \nThe title of Schiller’s essay “On Naïve and\nSentimental Poetry” [“Über naïve und\nsentimentalische Dichtung”] (1795–6), articulates\nanother distinction Schiller uses to explore and define the modern\nhuman condition. To ground the essay’s fundamental dichotomy,\nSchiller again takes a fact of human experience and then asks what\nelse must be true of humans in order for this fact to be possible.\nThis time his subject is the pleasure humans take in nature. What\nexplains our “many fondnesses for flowers and animals, for\nsimple gardens, for walks, for the land”? (NA XX, 413/E 179).\nSchiller agrees with Kant that our pleasure cannot be only a response\nto their beauty since our delight in a birdsong is destroyed if we\ndiscover that it was produced by human imitation. This reaction\nsuggests, Schiller thinks, that our enjoyment of nature is not\naesthetic but moral. It is not the flower or animal itself that gives\nus pleasure but \nan idea portrayed by them that we cherish in them. We treasure the\nsilent creativity of life in them, the fact that they act serenely on\ntheir own, being there according to their own laws; we cherish that\ninner necessity, that eternal oneness with themselves. (NA XX, 414/E\n180) \nIn other words, natural objects display a harmony and unity that we\nfeel we once enjoyed and, as rational creatures, have lost. Our\npleasure mixed with melancholy indicates that “they are\nwhat we were; they are what we should become once\nmore”. The resulting emotion is sublime since it mixes the pain\nof longing for lost unity with the pleasure of having “an\nadvantage that they lack”: their natures are determined, whereas\nhumans are self-determining (NA XX, 414–15/E 180–1). \nThis sublime response is not, however, limited to our experience of\nnature but can be prompted by interactions with humans as well. When\nour reaction to another human’s behavior combines melancholy at\nwhat we have lost with the pleasure of superiority, we call that\nperson naïve. A child who responds to an impoverished stranger by\noffering her father’s wallet makes us both smile at her basic\ngoodness and ashamed of our lost innocence (NA XX, 421/E 186). When\neven adults act according to pure ideals despite evidence of the\nworld’s corruption, we also call them naïve, reflecting\nboth amusement at their ignorance and respect for their purity. The\nartistic genius also exhibits a kind of naïveté: she is\n“guided solely by nature or instinct” and acts with\n“simplicity and ease” that seems out of place in the\ncruel, calculating world (NA XX, 424/E 189). The naïve artist\nnames things “by their right name and in the most\nstraightforward manner” (NA XX, 427/E 191), unconcerned with\nsocial connotations or norms. Naïveté generally, then, is\ncharacterized by purity, simplicity, directness, and ease. \nAlthough naïveté exists in the modern world, it was much\nmore prevalent among the ancient Greeks. This fact again relates to\nconceptions of nature. The naïve poet simply imitates nature.\nThis unreflective response means the poet “can have only a\nsingle relation to his object and, in this respect, he has no\nchoice regarding the treatment” (NA XX, 440/E 204). Modern\nhumans, by contrast, have a more developed sense of self and are\ntherefore keenly aware of their separation from nature. When we\ncompare modern depictions of nature to those of the ancient Greeks,\nwhat strikes us is that the Greek poet’s portrayal\n“contains no more special involvement of the heart”; he\n“does not cling to nature with the fervor, sensitivity, and\nsweet melancholy that we moderns do” (NA XX, 429/E 194). The\nreason, Schiller says, is that in the divisiveness of the modern\nworld, nature “has disappeared from our humanity, and we\nreencounter it in its genuineness only outside of humanity in the\ninanimate world” (NA XX, 430/E 194). The ancient poet by\ncontrast had not lost nature and so felt no need to rediscover it.\nAncient poets, Schiller concludes, “felt naturally, while we\nfeel the natural” (NA XX, 431/E 195). \nIn contrast to the naïve poet’s direct relation to nature,\nthe sentimental poet foregrounds her own perspective and reflection,\nprecipitating a shift from objects to thought: whereas naïve\npoets “touch us through nature”, modern poets “touch\nus through ideas” (NA XX, 438/E\n 201).[8]\n The sentimental poet communicates not his feelings but his thoughts\nabout his feelings: he “reflects on the impression the\nobjects make upon him” (NA XX, 441/E 204). Contrasting Homer,\nSchiller’s paradigmatic example of a naïve poet, with\nsentimental poets makes this distinction clear. A modern sentimental\npoet, having recounted a heroic deed, “would hardly have waited\n… to testify to his delight at this action”; we, as his\nsentimental audience, would “also pause in our hearts while\nreading and eagerly distance ourselves from the subject matter in\norder to look at ourselves” (NA XX, 435/E 199, italics\nmine). There is, by contrast, “not a trace of any of this in\nHomer”, who simply recounts events directly, leaving his own\nresponse aside (NA XX, 435/E 199). Because they are dealing with the\nobject on the one hand and their own ideas on the other, sentimental\npoets are always divided. They thus lack the easy, peaceful confidence\nof their naïve counterparts. Of his sentimental contemporaries\nKleist and Haller, for instance, Schiller writes: \nit is not their distinctive and dominant character to feel with a\ncalm, uncomplicated, and easy sensibility and to exhibit the feeling\nin just this way. The imagination involuntarily crowds the intuition,\nthe power of thought anticipates the feeling, and they close eyes and\nears in order to sink, meditating, into themselves. (NA XX, 452/E\n214) \nAlthough the sentimental disposition is more prevalent in the modern\nworld, some of modernity’s finest poets were, Schiller argues,\nactually naïve. Shakespeare, for example, does not allow himself\nto “be grasped” in his work (NA XX, 433/E 197). Goethe\nlikewise manages to foreground the object rather than ideas, achieving\na sturdy cheerfulness mostly unencumbered by modern anxieties. It is\neven possible for a modern naïve poet like Goethe to treat a\nsentimental topic: Goethe’s fictional character Werther\n“ardently embraces an ideal and flees the actual world”\n(NA XX, 459/E 220), but Goethe’s treatment of this archetypical\nsentimental character nevertheless succeeds in being\n naïve.[9]\n Ultimately, Schiller thinks poets should follow their dispositions:\nif a modern poet feels enough of an affinity for the Greek spirit\n“despite all the intractableness of his material”, he\nshould pursue it “wholeheartedly and do it exclusively,\ndisregarding every demand made by a sentimental age’s\ntastes” (NA XX, 471/E 231). It will be difficult and the effort\nwill be noticeable, but it may work. If the poet is instead drawn to\nthe ideal “then let him pursue this totally … without\nlooking back to see whether the actual world might follow him”\n(NA XX, 472/E 232). \nDespite our longing for the simplicity represented by the naïve\nview, the sentimental view represents the higher development of human\npotential. “[T]he goal for which the human being\nstrives through culture”, Schiller says, \nis infinitely superior to the goal that he attains through\nnature. Thus the value of the one consists in absolutely reaching a\nfinite greatness, while the value of the other lies in approaching an\ninfinite greatness. (NA XX, 438/E 202) \nSchiller exhorts his readers not to mourn for lost unity but instead\nto \ntake nature up into yourself and strive to wed its unlimited\nadvantages to your own endless prerogatives, and from the marriage of\nboth strive to give birth to something divine. (NA XX, 429/E 193) \nThe ultimate ideal is a kind of unity of unity and division, a\n“structure of immediacy, its negation, and their unity”\nthat approaches the complex harmony that is a perpetual aspiration in\nSchiller’s worldview and is also a precursor of Hegel’s\ndialectic (Dahlstrom 2008: 91; Hinderer 1991: 206). \nThe sentimental poet’s divided consciousness opens up new\npossibilities for poetic genres, depending on what relation between\nthe two components of poetry—the actual world and the\npoet’s idea—is predominant (NA XX, 442/E 205). When poets\ntake the “contradiction between the actual and ideal” as\ntheir subject matter, the result will be satire. Given the division\ninherent in the modern world, Schiller suggests that satire is a\nparadigmatically modern literary genre. Because comedy and tragedy\nalso foreground incongruities, Schiller considers them related forms.\nIronically, given his status as one of Germany’s most\naccomplished tragedians, Schiller identifies comedy as the higher of\nthe two. While in a tragedy, the subject matter generates what\nhappens, in comedy “everything happens because of the\npoet” (NA XX, 445/E 208). This in turn means that the subject\nmatter is more free, making comedy the more free art. This freedom\nextends to the comic poet who must only “remain himself”\nand “be at home” in his production. Comic characters are\nthen beautiful, as opposed to tragic characters, who are sublime:\ncomic characters are always free and at ease, “while the sublime\ncharacter is free only by fits and starts and with a struggle”\n(NA XX, 445/E 208). Comedy’s goal, in fact, tracks \nthe supreme goal of human striving: to be free of passion, to look\naround and into oneself always with clarity and composure, to find\neverywhere more chance than fate, and to laugh more about absurdity\nthan rage and whine about maliciousness. (NA XX, 446/E 209) \nIf, instead of foregrounding contrasts as do satire, tragedy, and\ncomedy, a work portrays harmony between the actual and the ideal, two\nfurther genres are possible. If the harmony is mourned as lost, the\npoem will be an elegy; if it is celebrated as achievable, it will be\nan idyll. Idyllic poetry in particular has the potential to heal\nhumans’ divided selves: it should serve as a “tangible\nconfirmation of the plausibility of realizing that idea in the world\npresented by the senses” (NA XX, 468/E 228). Executed correctly,\nthe idyll is composed but expansive; it is still but includes\nmovement; it is both a unity and a manifold; it depicts \nthe concept of a free union of inclinations with the law, the concept\nof a nature purified to the point of supreme moral dignity. In short,\nit is nothing other than the ideal of beauty applied to actual life.\n(NA XX, 472/E 232) \nSchiller suggests, in other words, that idyllic poetry might allow the\nmodern human to “see the legislation of nature in a pure\nexemplar once again, and, in this faithful mirror, to be able once\nagain to purify himself” (NA XX, 468/E 229; Hinderer 1991: 204;\nSharpe 1991: 181–9). \nSchiller is not, however, content to confine his distinction between\nthe naïve and sentimental to art. In the essay’s final\nsection, he sketches a portrait of these two sensibilities divorced\nfrom their aesthetic application. Here the naïve person becomes\nthe realist; the sentimental character becomes the idealist. The\nrealist has a “knack for sober observation and a firm adherence\nto the uniform testimony of the senses”; as far as action goes,\nhe submits to natural necessity, “yielding to what is and must\nbe” (NA XX, 492/250). He aims at happiness and prosperity and\nviews morality not as encompassed in an individual deed but in the sum\nof a life. He can “proceed splendidly” this way but\n“would not be able to lay claim, in any particular case, to\ngreatness and dignity” (NA XX, 494/E 252). The idealist instead\nexhibits a “restless spirit of speculation that presses on\ntowards what is unconditioned”, drawing “upon himself and\nreason alone for his knowledge and his motives” (NA XX, 494/E\n252). In moral evaluation, he will exhibit a “purer morality on\nan individual level, but much less moral uniformity on the\nwhole” (NA XX, 496/E 253). Since humans are not capable of\nconsistent idealism, the idealist can be judged only by particular\nacts. The general public, then, will often not have much to say about\nthe realist’s everyday behavior, but “it will always take\na position on the idealists, and will be torn between reproach and\namazement” (NA XX, 497/E 254). \nRealists and idealists’ attitudes towards their fellow humans\nwill also differ: \n[t]he realist proves himself to be a friend of the [particular] human,\nwithout having a very high conception of human beings and humanity [in\ngeneral]; the idealist thinks of humanity in so grand a manner that he\ncomes dangerously close to despising human beings. (NA XX, 498/E\n255–6) \nThe realist will want to make the person he loves happy, while the\nidealist will “seek to ennoble what he loves” (NA\nXX, 397/E 255). In politics, the realist will aim at prosperity and\nthe idealist at freedom. Schiller then suggests but does not explain\nthat both realism and idealism can, in the political sphere, be either\n“true” or “false”. If realism is kept true,\nits effects are modest but beneficial; the effects of true idealism\n“are, by contrast, uncertain and often dangerous”. While\nfalse realism is only somewhat pernicious, false idealism is nothing\nless than “terrifying”; it will lead, Schiller says in a\nclear reference to the French Revolution, “to an infinite fall\ninto a bottomless depth and can only end in complete\nannihilation” (NA XX, 503/E 259–60). \nNot surprisingly, the ultimate goal must be the achievement of a\ndisposition that balances these extremes. The ideal of human nature,\nSchiller writes, “is divided up between the realist and the\nidealist, without being fully attained by either of them” (NA\nXX, 500/E 257); “only by means of the perfectly equal\ninclusion of both can justice be done to the rational concept\nof humanity” (NA XX, 493/E 250). In letters to Wilhelm von\nHumboldt, Schiller suggests that when the sentimental stage of\nhumanity is overcome, ideal humanity will be achieved, and the goal\narticulated at the essay’s beginning will be realized:\n“our culture should lead us along the path of reason and freedom\nback to nature” (NA XX, 414/E 181; Hinderer 1991: 206). The\nessay concludes, then, with another tripartite development that leads\nfrom unity through division to a unification of both. \n“On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry” played a\ndistinctive role in Friedrich Schlegel’s intellectual\ndevelopment and so in the entire German romantic movement (Lovejoy\n[1920] 1947; Beiser 2005: 116ff). It likely shaped Hegel’s\ndistinction between ancient and modern art, most notably his\ndiscussion of modern tragedy and comedy. The essay’s vision of\nart’s role in modernity has also been influential: Nietzsche\nmakes use of Schiller’s definition of the naïve in The\nBirth of Tragedy’s analysis of Greek culture (24–6;\nMartin 1996: 29–44); Georg Lukács found in\nSchiller’s portrait of the artist a potent description of\nart’s task in the modern world (Lukács 1953: 111ff;\nSharpe 1991: 194–6). Recently, Daniel Dahlstrom has cited the\nessay as developing a kind of poetic phenomenology reminiscent of\nHusserl (Dahlstrom 2018: 101–121) \nIn 1796, Schiller’s intensive period of philosophical output\nended and he returned to playwriting. For his first dramatic work in\nten years, the tragic trilogy Wallenstein, Schiller chose a\nhistorical topic with the explicit goal of shifting his writing from\nthe sentimental towards the naïve (Berman 1986; Moland 2011). The\nplays were widely hailed as a success and were followed by four other\nmajor dramas, among them Maria Stuart and Wilhelm\nTell. Schiller continued to write poetry and intensified his\ncollaborations with Goethe, including the co-production of a series of\nepigrams, entitled Xenien, whose sardonic critique of their\ncontemporaries ignited a widespread literary feud (Mohr 2007: 217).\nThis extraordinarily productive period, however, lasted less than a\ndecade, at which point Schiller’s always weak health failed him,\nand he died at the age of forty-five. \nSince his death, Schiller’s thought has steadily influenced some\nof philosophy’s most prominent debates. Hegel and Wilhelm von\nHumboldt were early promoters of Schiller’s aesthetic and\npolitical theorizing (Hegel Aesthetics, 89–91/62;\nHumboldt, “Über Schiller”; Price 1967). His influence\non British Romanticism especially through the enthusiasm of Samuel\nTaylor Coleridge was also substantial (Kooy 2002). Marx and Engels\npraised his revolutionary spirit and diagnosis of the modern age but\ncriticized his perceived idealism (Kain 1982: chs. 3, 4; Saranpa 2002:\nch. 5). Schiller’s reputation suffered greatly from its\ndeployment in the 1914 “War of the Intellectuals” between\nEngland and Germany and from misuse of his thought by National\nSocialists in subsequent decades (Koepke 2005: 276–279; Martin\n2011; Sharpe 1995: chs. 2 and 3; Sponsel 2011). A divided post-war\nGermany saw Schiller’s fame employed in support of competing\npolitical philosophies in the German Democratic Republic and the\nFederal Republic of Germany (Sharpe 2005: 58; Saranpa 2002: ch. 6).\nMore recently, his vision of an “aesthetically permeated\nculture” has been cited as a predecessor to “modern\nmass-media studies” (Fischer 2011: 133); his analysis of\nthe French Revolution has been mined for its lessons on the\nuse of aesthetics in marketing and political propaganda (Mandoki\n2019); his thought has also been used in philosophical work on\nthe emotions (Bennett 2017). A 2018 volume on Schiller and\nphilosophy highlights his importance to other philosophical\nfigures, including the development of German Romanticism and\nphilosophical pessimism, and to the thought of French philosopher\nJacques Rancière (Acosta López and Powell 2018). Also in\n2018, a special issue of Kant-Studien was devoted to\n“Friedrich Schiller's Challenge to Moral\nPhilosophy.”  Schiller's was, in short, a vision of\nthe centrality of aesthetic experience to daily and political life\nthat has resonated through the centuries since his death and continues\nto shape philosophical thought today.","contact.mail":"lydia.moland@colby.edu","contact.domain":"colby.edu"}]
