Some examples\noften cited are: Zeus, Pegasus, Sherlock Holmes, Vulcan (the hypothetical planet postulated by the 19th century astronomer Le Verrier), the perpetual\nmotion machine, the golden mountain, the fountain of youth, the round\nsquare, etc. Some important philosophers have thought that the very\nconcept of a nonexistent object is contradictory (Hume) or logically\nill-formed (Kant, Frege), while others (Leibniz, Meinong, the Russell\nof Principles of Mathematics) have embraced it\nwholeheartedly.\n\n\nOne of the reasons why there are doubts about the concept of a\nnonexistent object is this: to be able to say truly of an object that\nit doesn’t exist, it seems that one has to presuppose that it exists,\nfor doesn’t a thing have to exist if we are to make a true claim about\nit? In the face of this puzzling situation, one has to be very careful\nwhen accepting or formulating the idea that there are nonexistent\nobjects. It turns out that Kant’s view that “exists” is\nnot a “real” predicate and Frege’s view, that\n“exists” is not a predicate of individuals (i.e., a\npredicate that yields a well-formed sentence if one puts a singular\nterm in front of it), has to be abandoned if one is to accept the\nclaim that there are nonexistent objects.\n\n\nThis entry is an examination of the many questions which arise in\nconnection with the view that there are nonexistent objects. The\nfollowing are particularly salient: What reasons are there (if any)\nfor thinking that there are nonexistent objects? If there are\nnonexistent objects, then what kind of objects are they? How can they\nbe characterized? Is it possible to provide a consistent theory of\nnonexistent objects? What is the explanatory force of a consistent\ntheory of nonexistent objects (if such a thing is possible)?\n\nThe very concept of a “nonexistent object” has an air of\nparadox about it, at least for those philosophers whose thinking is\nrooted in the Humean tradition. For Hume suggested that to think of an\nobject is always and necessarily to think of an existent\nobject, or to put it differently, that to think of an object and to\nthink of the same object as existing are just one and the same thing.\nImmanuel Kant took up Hume’s idea and claimed that existence is not a\n“real predicate”, a claim that is often interpreted as an\nanticipation of Gottlob Frege’s famous doctrine that existence is not\na predicate of individuals. (See Hume 2000, Book 1, Part 2, Sect. 6;\nKant 2003, B 627; Frege 1966, pp. 37f.) Kant’s motivation for\nrejecting the view that existence is a “real predicate”\nwas the so-called “ontological proof” of God’s existence,\nwhich says, roughly, that God’s perfection entails God’s existence,\nsince a being that would have all of God’s perfections except\nexistence (i.e., omniscience, omnipotence, benevolence) would be less\nperfect than a being with the same perfections plus existence. For\ncenturies, philosophers have felt that there is something wrong with\nthis proof, but Kant was the first one who was able to point out a\npossible error: he argued that the mistake of the “ontological\nargument” lies in the treatment of existence as a “real\npredicate”. \nIf Hume is right, then the concept of an object includes the concept\nof existence, and the concept of a nonexistent object would be as\nself-contradictory as the concept of a round square. If existence is\nnot a predicate of individuals, then one might suppose that neither is\nnonexistence. Therefore, if Frege is right, to say of an object that\nit is nonexistent is a kind of nonsense that arises from a violation\nof logical grammar. (For Frege and those who follow him, a claim like\n“God exists/does not exist” is to be understood as a claim\nabout the concept God, or about the property of being God. On\nthis view, the logical form of “God exists” is not\nExists (God)—where Exists is a predicate of\nindividuals, but rather: The concept God applies to\nsomething, or Something possesses the property of being\nGod.) \nThus, in order to take the idea of nonexistent objects seriously, one\nhas to give up views held by important philosophers about the nature\nof existence and adopt the view that existence is some kind of\npredicate of individuals. This view entails, among other things, that\nto say, for instance, that some white elephants exist is to say that\nsome white elephants have the property of existence (or, to put it the\nother way around, that not all white elephants are\nnonexistent)—a consequence that might strike some as\nstrange. \nFurthermore, in order to assert “there are nonexistent\nobjects” without implying “nonexistent objects\nexist”, one has to suppose that sentences of the form\n“There are Fs” mean something different from\nsentences of the form “Fs\n exist”.[1]\n Some philosophers reject a distinction between “there is”\nand “exists” (see, for instance, Lewis 1990, Priest 2005,\nQuine 1953), some philosophers (e.g., Meinong 1960, Parsons 1980,\nZalta 1988) think that there are good reasons for making this\ndistinction. Some of the latter think that the distinction between\n“there is” and “exists” is rooted in ordinary\nlanguage, but others deny this firmly (see, for instance, Geach 1971).\nObviously, although there might be a tendency among competent English\nspeakers to use “there is” and “exists” in\ndifferent contexts, ordinary language use is too wavering and\nnon-uniform in this respect to be a stable ground for a philosophical\ntheory. Of course, this does not rule out that there are\ntheoretical reasons for a distinction between “there\nis” and “exists”, some of which are discussed\nbelow. \nIn those logics that stand in the Frege-Quine tradition, both\n“there is” and “exists” are expressed by means\nof the “existential quantifier” (“∃”),\nwhich is, consequently, interpreted as having “ontological\nimport”. Thus, in these formal systems, there is no means to\ndistinguish between “there is” and “exists”.\nHowever, it has been shown that the distinction between the two can be\ncoherently regimented in various ways. In the systems of Terence\nParsons, Edward N. Zalta and Dale Jacquette, for instance,\n“there is an x such that …\nx…” is expressed by\n“∃x(…x…)”, whereas\n“there exists an x such that …\nx…” is expressed by\n“∃x(E!x &\n…x…)”, where “E!” is the\nexistence predicate (Parsons 1980, Zalta 1983, Zalta 1988, Jacquette\n1996). “Some things do not exist” could thus be rendered\nin logical notation as follows:\n“∃x(¬E!x)”; “Pegasus\ndoes not exist” as “¬E!p”; and so\nforth. \nGraham Priest (2005) has proposed a theory of nonexistent objects that\ntreats “there is” and “exists” as synonyms. He\ninterprets quantification as utterly ontologically neutral. The\nquantifier should express neither “there is” nor\n“there exists”. Rather, quantifier expressions should be\nread “For some x, …x…”,\nwhere “For some x, …x…”\ndoes not imply that “there is (or exists) an x such that\n…x…”. \nThus, Priest belongs to those philosophers who distinguish between\n“quantifier commitment” and “ontological\ncommitment” (see Azzouni 2004), claiming that to\n“quantifier over” objects of a certain kind does not\nentail an ontological commitment to objects of this\n kind.[2] \nThe various logics of nonexistent objects cannot be described and\ndiscussed here in detail. However, it is now clear that there is no\nformal obstacle to a theory of nonexistent objects. The only\nquestions are philosophical: can the concepts that such theories aim\nto formalize be explained, and do we have good reason to accept a\ntheory formulated in these terms? In the following two sections, the\nmain motivations for believing in nonexistent objects are\ndelineated. \nPhilosophical writings on nonexistent objects in the 20th and 21st\ncentury usually take as their starting point the so-called\n“theory of objects” of the Austrian philosopher Alexius\nMeinong (1853–1920). Therefore, it is appropriate to give an\noutline of the basic principles of and motives behind this theory.\n(For a detailed presentation see the entry on \n   Meinong.) \nMeinong was concerned about the problem of intentional states which\nare not directed at anything existent. The starting point of this\nproblem is the so-called “principle of intentionality”,\nwhich says that mental phenomena are characterized by an\n“intentional directedness” towards an object. For\ninstance, to love is always to love something, to imagine is always to\nimagine something, and so forth. In other words, every intentional act\nis “about” something. The problem is that sometimes people\nimagine, desire or fear things that do not exist. Some people fear the\ndevil, although the devil doesn’t exist. Many people hope for peace in\nthe Middle East. But there is no peace in the Middle East. Ponce the\nLeon searched for the fountain of youth, even though it doesn’t exist.\nIt is easy to imagine a golden mountain, even if no such thing\nexists. \nCases like these seem to be clear counterexamples to the principle of\nintentionality. However, many philosophers found this principle too\nappealing to be given up completely. While some came to the conclusion\nthat intentionality is not a real relation and therefore does not\nrequire the existence of an object (see, for instance, Brentano 1874,\nPrior 1971, Searle 1983, Crane 2013), Meinong offered another\nsolution: there is indeed an object for every mental state\nwhatsoever—if not an existent object then at least a nonexistent\n one.[3] \nThe problem of intentionality may still count as one of the most\nimportant motivations for thinking there are nonexistent\n objects.[4]\n But there are other motivations as well. \nVery briefly, the problem can be stated as follows: it seems that in\norder to deny the existence of a given individual, one must assume the\nexistence of that very individual. Thus, it seems that it is\nimpossible to deny the existence of an individual without getting\ninvolved in a contradiction. \nHowever, this conclusion seems hard to accept. In fact, there are many\nnegative existence statements that we take not only to be sensible but\nalso to be true (or at least not to be necessarily false). Consider,\nfor instance: \nPegasus does not exist. \nYugoslavia does not exist anymore. \nThe perpetual motion machine does not exist and never will exist. \nFrom the common sense point of view, negative singular existence\nstatements are ubiquitous, comprehensible and sometimes true. So why\nis it that many philosophers are so puzzled about them? In particular,\nwhy think one has to assume the existence of an individual in order to\ndeny its existence? \nOne traditional reason that has been given is based on the following\nassumptions: \nLet’s see how these assumptions lead to a problem in light of the\nnegative singular existence sentence “Pegasus does not\nexist”. If “Pegasus does not exist” is true, then it\nmust be meaningful (by (1) above). If it is meaningful, all of its\nconstituents must be meaningful, including the singular term\n“Pegasus” (by (2) above). If “Pegasus” is\nmeaningful, then “Pegasus” denotes something (by (3)\nabove). If “Pegasus” denotes something, then\n“Pegasus does not exist” is false (by (4) above). Thus,\nthe assumption that “Pegasus does not exist” is true leads\nto the conclusion that this same sentence is false. So if the above\npremises are correct, it is impossible that “Pegasus does not\nexist” is true: either “Pegasus” denotes something,\nin which case “Pegasus does not exist” is false; or\n“Pegasus” does not denote anything, in which case\n“Pegasus does not exist” is not even meaningful, let alone\ntrue. \nThere are several ways to resolve this problem, i.e., to account for\nmeaningful and true negative singular existence sentences. One\nsolution that became very prominent in the 20th century consists in\nthe strategy of “analyzing away” the proper names and\ndefinite descriptions appearing in negative singular existential\nclaims. This strategy consists of two steps: \nThus, combining these two steps, it follows that: \nIf “Vulcan” is short for “the planet between Mercury\nand the sun”, then: \nThe point of these paraphrases is to show that the original sentences\ncan be analyzed in terms of sentences in which the singular terms\n(“Pegasus”, “Vulcan”, “the flying horse\nof Greek mythology” and “the planet between Mercury and\nthe sun”) have all disappeared. The paraphrases involve\nthe general terms “flying horse from Greek mythology” and\n“planet between Mercury and the sun”, along with\nthe existential quantifier (“there is”) and a uniqueness\ncondition (“exactly one”). (Let’s ignore the fact that the\nsingular terms “Mercury” and “Le Verrier”\nappear within the general terms; of course, this means that the\nprocedure isn’t complete, but, in principle, it can be completed.) The problem of negative singular existentials is thereby\nresolved because sentences containing names which appear to be about\nnonexistent objects are paraphrased in terms of sentences involving\ngeneral terms, quantifiers and uniqueness conditions. These latter\nsentences are meaningful independently of whether the general terms\napply to anything. \nHowever, both the description theory of proper names and Russell’s\ntheory of definite descriptions have been subject to serious\ncriticisms. One might object that they fail to do full justice to our\nactual use of proper names and definite descriptions. Often we use\nproper names—successfully—without having any definite\ndescription in mind. Sometimes we don’t need a definite description in\norder to refer to a particular object, because we individuate the\nrespective object by means of perception or perceptual memories.\nSometimes we simply do not know of a definite description that\nindividuates the object we wish to refer to. Most of us know about\nCicero just that he was a famous Roman orator; but the Romans had more\nthan one famous orator. Nevertheless, we can use the name\n“Cicero” successfully to refer to a particular\nfamous Roman orator. Moreover, even when we do have something like the\nmental correlate of a definite description in mind when we use a\nproper name, we do not usually treat the description as a\ndefinition of the proper name (as the Russellian picture\nsuggests). Suppose what I have in mind when I use the name\n“Socrates” corresponds to the description “the\nancient Greek philosopher who died from drinking hemlock”.\nSuppose furthermore that the famous story about Socrates’ death is\nactually a myth and that Socrates in fact died peacefully of old age.\nDo I then simply fail to refer to Socrates whenever I use the name\n“Socrates”? It does not seem so. When I eventually come to\nknow that Socrates did not die from drinking hemlock, I will take this\nas a piece of information about Socrates, the person I\nreferred to all the time by using the name “Socrates”.\n(See Kripke 1980.) \nAs to the theory of definite descriptions, two kinds of problem arise.\nFirst, some philosophers simply deny that the paraphrases properly\ncapture the meaning of sentences with definite descriptions, simply on\nthe grounds that the meaning of a proper name like\n“Pegasus” is just less specific than the meaning of the\ndefinite description “the flying horse of Greek\nmythology”. Second, some philosophers have objected that the\ntheory of definite descriptions sometimes yields the wrong results.\nConsider, for instance: “The ancient Greeks worshipped\nZeus.” Prima facie, this sentence expresses a real\nrelation between the ancient Greeks and Zeus; and it is surely a\nhistorical fact that the ancient Greeks worshipped Zeus. Yet on\nRussell’s analysis, proper names like “Zeus” have to be\nreplaced by definite descriptions, even in contexts other than\nexistence claims. So “Zeus” would get replaced by a\ndefinite description like “the Greek god who lived on Mt.\nOlympus and who …”. Thus, the above true sentence would\nget analyzed in terms of the following false one:\n“There exists one and only one Greek god who lived on Mt.\nOlympus and who … and who was such that the ancient Greeks\nworshipped him.” There are numerous other true sentences like\nthis, such as “Sherlock Holmes is more famous than any real\ndetective”, etc., all of which appear to involve real relations\nbetween existent objects and nonexistent ones, but whose Russellian\nparaphrases are false. Third, the use of the anaphoric pronoun\n“it” in “Teams of scientists have searched for the\nLoch Ness monster, but since it doesn’t exist, no one will ever find\nit” seems problematic. The pronoun in both of its occurrences in\nthis sentence seems to pick up its meaning/denotation from the\ndefinite description “the Loch Ness monster”—which\nis not easy to explain given Russell’s theory of definite\ndescriptions. \nThere might be ways to defend the theory of definite descriptions, but\nthey will not be pursued here. In the context of this article, the\nrelevant point is that Russell’s theory does not provide a generally\naccepted solution to the problem of negative existence sentences. The\nappeal to nonexistent objects, on the other hand, provides a very\nsimple solution to this problem. It consists in rejecting the\npremise \nIf there are nonexistent objects, then “b” may\ndenote an object that does not exist. \nThe idea here is that whereas the quantifiers “there is”\nand “something” range over everything whatsoever, the\nobjects that exist constitute only a portion of that domain.\nTherefore, it would be fallacious to derive from\n“‘b’ denotes something” that\n“b” denotes something that exists.\nAccording to this picture, “Pegasus does not exist” simply\nexpresses that Pegasus is a nonexistent object. Premises 1–3\nfrom above can be accepted without restriction. “Pegasus”\ndenotes a nonexistent flying horse and thus is meaningful. Thus, the\nwhole sentence “Pegasus does not exist” is meaningful as\nwell. Since it is true that Pegasus does not belong to the class of\nexistent objects, “Pegasus does not exist” is true. Of\ncourse, this solution can be generalized to all negative singular\nexistence statements. The appeal to nonexistent objects thus supplies\nan elegant solution to the problem of negative singular existentials.\n \nNaturally, there are alternative solutions to the problem of negative\nsingular existence statements. Among other things, it is possible to\nreject premise 4 without committing oneself to an ontology of nonexistent objects. One\nmight simply accept a positive Free Logic, i.e., the conjunction of\nthe following two principles: 1. Singular terms do not need to denote\nanything in order to be meaningful. 2. Sentences containing\nnon-denoting singular terms can be true. (This strategy is to be\nfound, for instance, in Crane 2013.) One of the difficulties of this\nsolution, however, is to give an account of what makes such sentences\ntrue, i.e., of what their truthhmakers are (given the principle that,\nfor every true sentence, there is something in the world that makes it\ntrue, i.e., something that is the sentence’s truthmaker). For the\nspecial case of negative singular existence sentences, one might claim\nthat that their truthmaker is just the entire world (see, e.g., Crane\n2013, Section 3.5; for more about Crane’s position see Section 5.1 below). However, this answer to the truthmaker question is\nnot available for the problem of fictional discourse, which provides\nanother important motivation for a commitment to nonexistent\nobjects. \nBy “fictional discourse” we mean here and in what follows\ndiscourse about fictitious objects. Sometimes, the term\n“fictitious object” is used as synonymous with\n“nonexistent object”. Here, the term is used in a\ndifferent sense, namely for objects (characters, things, events etc.)\nwhich occur in fictions, i.e., in myths or fairy tales, in fictional\nnovels, movies, operas etc. Pegasus is a fictitious object in this\nsense (as are Sherlock Holmes and Hamlet) but Vulcan (the hypothetical\nplanet sought by Le Verrier) is not. \nConsider, for instance, the sentence \nLike many other sentences of fictional discourse, it appears to\nfulfill the following three conditions: \nThe problem of fictional discourse is closely connected to two logical\nprinciples. The first one is well known as “the principle of\nexistential generalization”: \nThe second principle is less prominent, rather seldom explicitly\nstated, but often tacitly assumed. We call it “the predication\nprinciple”: \n(PP) may be read in two ways: \n(PPb) If b is F, then b exists. \nBoth principles are prima facie extremely plausible: If it is\ntrue of some individual that the predicate “F”\napplies to it, then the predicate “F”\napplies to something. If some predicate\n“F” applies to an individual, then the individual\nhas to exist (for if it were otherwise, how could the predicate apply\nto it?). \nYet, when applied to fictional discourse, these two principles lead to\nconsequences that seem to contradict hard empirical facts on the one\nhand and trivial truths about the ontological status of fictitious\nobjects on the other. According to (EG), the sentence \nimplies \nYet, as we all know, there are no flying horses. \nAccording to (PP), \nimplies \nBut Pegasus is a fictitious object; and it seems that to call an\nobject fictitious is just to say that it does not exist. \nThe problem is that obviously true sentences of fictional discourse\nseem to lead into outright contradictions. Of course, there are\nseveral ways to avoid the contradictions. One of them consists in\nrejecting the principles (EG) and (PP). By this move, one blocks the\ninference from “Pegasus is a flying horse” to “There\nare flying horses” and “Pegasus exists”. Indeed,\nsome logicians, notably proponents of Free Logics, take this path.\n(See Crane 2013, Hintikka 1959, Lambert 1983 and 1991, Leonard\n 1956.)[8]\n Again (as with the case of negative singular existence statements)\nthis raises the question of what the truthmakers of such sentences\nare. There are attempts to answer this question in a\n“reductionist” fashion, i.e., to claim that sentences about\nfictitious objects are made true not by fictitious objects but by\nsomething else, e.g., by literary works, myths, stories or facts about\nthese,\n respectively.[9] \nAnother way to avoid the contradictions would be simply to reject the\nsentence “Pegasus is a flying horse” (and, in general, all\nalleged predications about fictitious objects) as false or untrue.\nThis radical solution, however, fails to do justice to the widespread\nintuition that there is a difference in truth-value between\n“Pegasus is a flying horse” and, say, “Pegasus is a\nflying dog”. \nA third attempt to resolve the problem is what may be called\n“the story-operator strategy”. According to the\nstory-operator strategy, we have to interpret sentences of fictional\ndiscourse as incomplete. A complete rendition of, for instance, \nwould be as follows: \nThe expression “according to the story S” is the\nso-called “story\n operator”,[10]\n which is a sentence operator (that is, it is the sentence as\na whole that is in its scope, not just a part of the sentence, for\ninstance the predicate). While the sentence within the scope of the\nstory operator (here: “Pegasus is a flying horse”) may be\nfalse when taken in isolation, the complete sentence may be true.\n(This strategy is developed in detail in Künne 1990.) \nSentence (1′) does not imply that there are flying\nhorses; neither does it imply that Pegasus exists. Thus, the\ncontradictions are\n avoided.[11]\n This looks like an elegant solution, at least as long as we confine\nourselves to a particular kind of example. Unfortunately, however, it\ndoes not work equally well for all kinds of sentences of fictional\ndiscourse. Consider, for instance: \nThis sentence seems to be straightforwardly true; but if we put a\nstory operator in front of it, we get a straightforward falsehood: \nIt is not true that according to the relevant story, Pegasus is a\ncharacter. Rather, according to this story, Pegasus is a living being\nof flesh and blood. \nOne may call sentences like “Pegasus is a flying horse” or\n“Hamlet hates his stepfather” “internal\nsentences of fictional discourse”, in distinction from\nexternal sentences of fictional discourse, like\n“Pegasus is a character from Greek mythology” or\n“Hamlet has fascinated many psychoanalysts”. The story\noperator strategy can be applied to internal sentences only and thus\nfails as a general solution to the problem of fictional\n discourse.[12] \nThe claim that there are nonexistent objects provides a solution that\ncan be applied uniformly both to internal and external sentences of\nfictional discourse. It allows us to admit that fictitious objects do\nnot exist but at the same time to acknowledge that there\nare fictitious objects. According to this position, fictitious\nobjects are just a species of nonexistent objects. \nIn order to see how this assumption is supposed to avoid the\ncontradictions spelled out above, consider: \nAccording to the Meinongian solution, premise 3 has to be rejected as\nfalse. The Meinongian grants that flying horses do not exist,\nbut this does not imply that there are no flying horses.\nAccording to the Meinongian, there are flying horses, and they belong\nto the class of nonexistent objects, and Pegasus is one of them.\nPremise 3 may be replaced by \nBut this does not contradict \nThus, the problem is\n solved.[14] \nConsider next: \nIn this case, the Meinongian solution consists in rejecting premise 2.\nThe Meinongian cannot accept 2, since Pegasus is supposed to be a\nnonexistent object. \nWhat, then, about the predication principle? Does the Meinongian have\nto reject it?—Not necessarily. Remember that (PP) can be read in\n(at least) two ways: \n(PPb) If b is F, then b exists. \nWithin the Meinongian framework, these two readings are not\nequivalent. According to the Meinongian, certainly there is something\nthat is identical with Pegasus, although Pegasus does not exist. Thus,\nthe Meinongian must reject the reading (PPb), but she can (and does)\naccept the reading\n (PPa).[15] \nSince the Meinongian accepts only the weaker version (PPa) of the\npredication principle, the inference from premise 1 (“Pegasus is\na flying horse”) to “Pegasus exists” is blocked. All\nthat can be derived from premise 1 is the weaker claim \nBut this is not in conflict with “Pegasus does not exist”.\nThus, the problem is resolved. \nAlternatively, one may abstain from the Meinongian distinction between\nbeing and existence and hold that fictitious objects are existent\nabstract objects. According to this position, “Pegasus does not\nexist” has to be rejected as false, and thus, again, the\ncontradiction is avoided. This position (it might be called\n“abstractionism with respect to fictitious objects”) comes\nin two varieties. The first one might be characterized, in a somewhat\nsimplified fashion, as follows: To every set of properties, there is/exists a corresponding abstract object. These abstract objects exist necessarily. Some of them occur in fictional stories, and these are what we call “fictitious objects”. Thus, fictitious objects are\nnecessarily existent objects that have been somehow\n“discovered” or “selected” by the authors of\nfictional stories. (For this position, see, for instance, Parsons 1975, Zalta 1983 and 1988, Jacquette 1996, Berto 2008 and Priest 2011. Actually, this is one of the applications of\ncontemporary versions of Meinongianism. See Sections 5.4 and 5.5\nbelow.) According to the other variety of abstractionism, fictitious\nobjects are abstract artefacts, i.e., they are not discovered or\nselected but created by the authors of fictional\n stories.[16] \nThe latter view (today often referred to as “creationism”)\nfits well into a general ontology of abstract artefacts (like, for\ninstance, literary and other works of fiction as well as non-fictional\ncultural entities) and does justice to the intuition that fictitious\nobjects as well as the works in which they occur are literally brought\ninto being through human acts of creation. However, it is objected\nagainst creationism that the creation of an abstract object is\nsomething deeply mysterious. \nThe structure of the problem of discourse about the past and the\nfuture is very similar to the structure of the problem of fictional\ndiscourse. Consider the following sentences: \n(2) The first female pope will be black. \nGiven that the sentences (1) and (2) have the logical structure of\npredications, i.e., the structure “Fb”, and given\nthat (PP) is valid, (1) implies that Socrates exists and (2) implies\nthat the first female pope exists. \nIndeed, the sentences (1) and (2) look like predications.\nGrammatically speaking, they consist of a subject term\n(“Socrates”, “the first female pope”) and a\npredicate term (“was a philosopher”, “will be\nblack”.) But while it is certainly true now (in the\nthird millennium C.E.) that Socrates was a philosopher, it is also\ncertainly true now that Socrates does not exist anymore. \nSecond, let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that indeed there will\nbe a female pope (and exactly one first female pope) at some time in\nthe far future and that she will be black and that she has not even\nbeen fathered yet. Given these assumptions, it is certainly true now\nthat the first female pope does not yet exist. \nAgain, there are several attempts to resolve this problem. One\npossible strategy is to deny that sentences like (1) and (2) really\nhave the logical structure of predications. One might suggest the\nfollowing alternative interpretations, using “P”\n(read: “It has been the case”) and\n“F” (read: “It will be the case”) as\n“tense operators”: \n(2′) F(The first female pope is black). \nNote that the tense operators “P” and\n“F” are sentence operators, like the story\noperator from above. Just as the story operator blocks the inference\nto existence claims about fictitious objects, the tense operators\nblock the inference from (1′) to \nand from (2′) to \nThere is a lot to be said in favor of this logical interpretation of\ntenses. Yet, it leaves some problems unresolved. One of them is the\nproblem of tensed plural quantifiers. Consider, for\ninstance: \nThe standard tense operator interpretation of (5) yields: \nHowever, while (5) is true, (5′) is false, since at no time in\nthe past there have been two kings named Charles\nsimultaneously. (See Lewis 2004.) Thus, the standard tense\noperator strategy seems to fail in cases like this one. \nAnother problem that the tense operator strategy leaves unresolved is\nthe problem of relations between present and non-present\nobjects. Given the principle that a real (two-place) relation can\nobtain only if both terms of the relation exist, and given that past\nand future objects do not (now) exist, relations between present and\npast or future objects are impossible. Yet it seems that there are\nplenty of relations between present and past (or future) objects. For\ninstance, I stand in the relation of being one of six\ngranddaughters of to my grandmother. Likewise, perhaps I stand in\nthe relation of being the grandmother of to a future\nchild. \nHere is a Meinongian solution: Suppose objects pop in and out of\nexistence but thereby do not gain or lose their\nbeing. (For a Meinongian, all existent objects have being but\nnot all being objects exist.) According to this picture,\n“Socrates” now denotes the nonexistent Socrates and\n“the first female pope” now denotes the nonexistent first\nfemale pope. Accordingly, although we cannot allow for the inference\nfrom \nand \nto \nand \nwe can allow for the inference from (1) and (2) to \nand \n(4′) There is something that is identical with the first female\n pope.[17] \nThis result does justice to two otherwise incompatible intuitions,\nnamely (i) the intuition that neither Socrates nor the first female\npope exist right now, and (ii) the intuition that it is nevertheless\npossible to refer to Socrates and to the first female pope (or, to put\nit another way: the intuition that the name “Socrates” and\nthe description “the first female pope” are not\nempty). \nTensed plural quantifiers do not pose a problem for a Meinongian.\nTensed quantifiers in general may be interpreted as\nrestricted quantifiers that range over a particular subdomain\nof nonexistent objects: “there was” may be interpreted as\na quantifier that ranges over the subdomain of past objects (i.e.,\nobjects that have existed but do not exist anymore); analogously,\n“there will be” may be interpreted as a quantifier that\nranges over the subdomain of future objects (i.e., objects that will\nexist but do not exist\n yet).[18] \nFurthermore, from a Meinongian point of view, relations between\nexistent and nonexistent objects are ubiquitous. Remember the\nMeinongian solution to the problem of intentionality: people fear,\nadmire, dream of, hope for, or imagine nonexistent objects. Thus,\nrelations between present and non-present objects do not pose a\nparticular problem for a Meinongian. \nSentences like \nseem to be logically true (at least according to the intuitions of\nsome logicians—see Lambert 1983). Furthermore, they seem to have\nthe logical structure of predications. According to (PP) and (EG), (1)\nimplies \nand \nIf “there is” means the same as “exist”, these\nare, of course, unacceptable consequences. \nThere are two obvious ways out: (i) One could simply reject (1) as\nfalse (or truth-valueless). (ii) One could try to find an adequate\nparaphrase for (1) which accounts for the intuition that (1) is\n“in some sense” true. Such a paraphrase might be \nBut according to the Meinongian picture, (2) and (3) are acceptable\nconsequences, since they do not entail the existence of\nsomething that is both round and square. Something that is both round\nand square is an impossible object, according to Meinong,\nwhich means that it cannot exist, but this does not entail\nthat there is no such thing. Therefore, the Meinongian can\naccept (1) as true, without resorting to any kind of paraphrase. \nWe have seen that there are alternative solutions for every single one\nof the abovementioned problems. But, for all we know, the assertion\nthat there are nonexistent objects is the only way to resolve all\nthese diverse problems in a uniform way. \nThere is a debate in practical philosophy as to whether nonexistent\npersons are morally relevant. The basic question is this: do\nnonexistent people have interests that we ought to take into account\nin our decisions? Obviously, some of our decisions affect not only\nexistent but also future (i.e., not yet existent) persons; matters of\nclimate change or the disposal of radioactive waste are relevant cases\nin point. Intuitively, we ought to act in such a way as to prevent\ndisasters for future generations. It is a matter of controversy,\nthough, whether, in order to take into account this moral intuition,\nwe have to commit ourselves to an ontology of not yet existent beings.\nSome, however, go still a step further and argue that not only future\npersons are morally relevant but even persons who will never exist\n(and never existed). In particular, this debate concerns questions of\nprocreative ethics and population\n policies.[19] \nThe foregoing considerations suggested that the claim that there are\nnonexistent objects has considerable explanatory force. Why, then, is\nthis claim not generally accepted but, rather to the contrary, so\ncontroversial? Is the reason just, as Meinong has put it, “a\nprejudice in favor of the actual”? — Although ontological\nprejudices may play a role, there are also some good reasons for\nreservations (to put it very carefully). \nEven in Meinong’s own writings, there are (roughly) two versions of\nthe theory, the original one and a later, revised one. In what\nfollows, we will refer to the original Meinongian object\ntheory by means of the abbreviation “MOTo”. \nPerhaps the most basic principle of MOTo is the so-called\n“principle of independence”, which says,\nliterally: So-being is independent from being (see Meinong\n1959). Ignoring, for the sake of simplicity, Meinong’s particular use\nof the term “being”, we can paraphrase this principle as:\nSo-being is independent from existence. \nThe “so-being” of an object is the totality of the\nobject’s properties apart from the object’s existence or\nnon-existence. The principle of independence says, thus, that an\nobject may have any properties whatsoever, independently of whether\nthe object exists or not. For instance, the (nonexistent) golden\nmountain literally is golden and a mountain; the round square\nliterally is round and a square. \nTo every single property and to every set of properties, there is a\ncorresponding object, either an existent or a nonexistent one. Thus,\nthere is, for instance, an object that has the property of being round\nas its sole property; one might call it “the object\nround”, or simply “round”. There\nis also an object that has the property of being blue as its sole\nproperty (the object blue, or blue, for short).\nFurthermore, there is an object that has the property of being round\nand the property of being blue, and no other properties (the object\nround and blue); and so forth. \nIn the notation of classical logic extended with definite descriptions\nof the form ιxφ(x), the object that has the\nproperty of being blue as its sole property may be represented by\n“ιx∀F(Fx ≡\nF =\n B)”[20]\n (where “B” stands for “is blue”),\nthe object that has the property of being blue and the property of\nbeing round as its sole properties by\n“ιx∀F(Fx ≡\nF = B ∨ F = R)” (where\n“R” stands for “is round”), and so\nforth. \nThe object blue is not identical with the\nproperty of being blue; neither is it identical with the\nset that contains the property of being blue as its sole\nmember. Neither is the object round and blue identical with\nthe set of the property of being blue and the property of being round.\nThe property of being blue is not itself blue, the property of being\nround is not itself round. Analogous considerations hold for sets of\nproperties: sets have neither colors nor shapes. But the object\nblue is blue, and the object round is round, and so\nforth. \nOne might wish to ask: Isn’t it impossible that there exists an object\nthat has the property of being blue as its sole property?\nIsn’t it necessarily the case that every colored object also has some\nparticular shape, some particular size, is made of some particular\nmaterial, and so forth? \nThe Meinongian answer to this question is as follows: It is indeed\nimpossible that such an object exists! Therefore, the object\nblue is not only nonexistent but even necessarily\nnonexistent. Of course, the same holds for the object round,\nthe object red and round, and infinitely many other objects\nas well. Every existing object has infinitely many\nproperties. Every existing object is a completely determined\n(or, in short: a complete) object. Objects like blue\nand round and blue are incompletely determined (or,\nin short: incomplete)\n objects.[21] \nIncomplete objects are necessarily nonexistent. They are, in this\nsense, impossible objects (even though their properties may\nnot be contradictory). It should be noted, however, that not every\ncomplete object exists. Consider, for instance, the object that looks\nexactly like me except that it has green eyes instead of blue ones.\nLet’s assume that this object (my nonexistent green-eyed counterpart)\nhas all the properties that I have except for those that are entailed\nby the difference in eye color, given the actual laws of nature. My\nnonexistent green-eyed counterpart is completely determined and\nnevertheless does not exist. But, in contrast to blue, this\ncounterpart could exist, i.e., it is a possible\nnonexistent\n object.[22] \nUnfortunately, however, MOTo has a number of paradoxical\nconsequences. Bertrand Russell, Meinong’s most famous critic, put\nforward two objections against\n MOTo.[23]\n The first objection goes as follows: According to MOTo,\nthere is an object that is both round and square, but such an object\nis “apt to infringe the law of contradiction”, since it\nwould be both round and not round (Russell 1973c, 107). \nMeinong perhaps could have replied to this objection that the object\ncalled “the round square” has the properties of being\nround and being square, but not the property of being not round, and\nthus the round square does not infringe the law of contradiction (but\nonly the geometrical law that everything that is square is not round).\nSuch a reply, however, would have been a bit beside the point, since\nit is clear that, according to the principles of MOTo,\nthere is an object that is both round and not round (and evidently the\nobject that Russell had in mind was of this sort). Indeed, Meinong did\nnot deny that the round square infringes the law of contradiction.\nInstead, he replied to Russell’s first objection that the law of\ncontradiction holds for existent objects only. Objects that are both\nround and not round, however, are necessarily nonexistent. \nRussell accepted this reply but forged a second objection that could\nnot be dismissed in the same vein. Russell argues that since it is a\nprinciple of MOTo that to every set of properties\nthere is a corresponding object and since existence is treated as a\nproperty within MOTo, there must be an object that has\nexactly the following three properties: being golden, being a\nmountain, and being existent. If “G” stands for\n“is golden”, “M” stands for “is\na mountain” and “E!” stands for “is\nexistent”, this object is denoted by\n“ιx∀F(Fx ≡\nF = G ∨ F = M ∨ F =\nE!)”. Thus, it follows from the principles of\nMOTo that there is an existent object that is\ngolden and a mountain. But it is an empirical fact that no golden\nmountain exists. Given the (apparently trivial) assumption that\n“b is existent” is equivalent with\n“b exists”, this is a contradiction. \nA further paradox seems to arise from the incompleteness of many\nMeinongian objects: \nFurthermore, it seems that many Meinongian objects do not only\ninfringe laws of logic and geometry, but also intuitively plausible\nprinciples like “If something is round, it occupies some region\nin space” and “If something is a mountain, it is\naccessible to the senses”. It seems that having a particular\nshape entails occupying a region in space and that being a mountain\nentails accessibility to the senses (in principle). According to\nMOTo, the round square is round and the golden mountain is\na mountain, but obviously neither the round square nor the golden\nmountain occupies any region in space and neither of them is\naccessible to the senses. \nAnother strange consequence of MOTo is the following: If an\nobject comes into existence, all that happens is that the object turns\nfrom a nonexistent into an existent one. Analogously, if an object\ngoes out of existence, all that happens is that the object turns from\nan existent again into a nonexistent one. Apart from this, neither the\nobject in question nor the world as a whole changes in any way. For\ninstance, when I cease to exist, all that happens is that I will again\nbe nonexistent (as it was from the beginning of time to 1966). In all\nother respects, I will stay just the same. Maybe such a thought is\npotentially comforting for those who love me, but it is surely at odds\nwith our normal understanding of coming into existence and passing\naway. \nThere is a diversity of contemporary theories of nonexistent objects,\nwhere “theory of nonexistent objects” is meant to include\nany theory that attempts to make sense of (alleged) talk about\nnonexistent objects and/or (seeming) intentional directedness to\nnonexistent objects. Some of them, like the de-ontologization\nstrategy and fictionalism, take a reductionist route.\nThe de-ontologization strategy claims that there can be true\nsentences about nonexistent objects, although there are no nonexistent\nobjects. Fictionalism claims that talk about nonexistent\nobjects is not to be taken literally but as a sort of\n“pretense”. The other worlds strategy makes use\nof the assumption of merely possible (and even impossible) worlds.\nOther contemporary theories of nonexistent objects, however, are\ncloser to Meinong’s original theory but have amended MOTo\nin such a way as to avoid at least some of the abovementioned\nparadoxes. Those are often called “neo-Meinongian\ntheories”. Usually, they adopt either the\nnuclear-extranuclear strategy or the dual copula\nstrategy in order to free Meinongian object theory from\ninconsistencies and counterintuitive consequences. \nTim Crane (see Crane 2012 and 2013) holds that all of the following\nclaims are true: \nCrane can hold the conjunction of 1 and 2 because he interprets\naboutness in a non-relational way. He can hold the\nconjunction of 2 and 3 because he denies that “there are”\nand its cognates (both in natural and formal languages) are\nontologically committing in any way. (For this reason, I call this the\nde-ontologization strategy.) He can hold the conjunction of 4 and 5\nbecause he endorses a positive free logic, i.e., the view that there\nmay be true as well as false sentences of the form Fb, where\n“b” stands for a non-referring singular term. \nBy denying that Pegasus is a horse and the round square is round Crane\ncircumvents some of the above-mentioned problems of Meinongianism.\nHowever, his view raises another problem: Why is “Pegasus is a\nmythical horse” true, while “Pegasus is a horse” is\nnot? In general, why is it that certain predications with\nnon-referring singular terms are true and others are not? For,\naccording to the de-ontologization strategy, neither “Pegasus is\na mythical horse” nor “Pegasus is a horse” can be\nmade true by the referent of “Pegasus”, because there is\nno such thing. \nFor another example of a reductionist solution, Frank Jackson holds that one can assent to\n“Mr. Pickwick is Dickens’ most famous character” without\nan ontological commitment to fictitious characters in general and Mr.\nPickwick in particular. For, according to Jackson’s de-ontologization\nstrategy, object language sentences are ontologically neutral.\nOntological commitment comes in only at the meta-language level, for\ninstance, if we would claim that the name “Mr. Pickwick”\ndenotes Dickens’s most famous character or that the predicate “a\ncharacter in Dickens” applies to something. (See Jackson\n1980.) \nA de-ontologization strategy with respect to fictitious characters is\nalso to be found in Crittenden 1973 and in Azzouni 2010. \nIn recent years, something close to the de-ontologization\nstrategy—or rather a bundle of more or less similar\nstrategies—became prominent, known under the heading\n“fictionalism”. The basic idea of fictionalism is, roughly\nput, that utterances belonging to a certain region of discourse are\nnot to be taken literally, that speakers producing such utterances\nhave a fictional attitude towards them and are engaged in a sort of\npretense or make-believe. (For an overview of the diverse versions of\nfictionalism as well as a succinct presentation of its most important\npros and cons see the entry on \n  fictionalism.) \nFictionalism differs from the de-ontologization strategy since\nfictionalists do not claim that the relevant utterances are literally\ntrue; to the contrary, according to fictionalism, certain kinds of\ndiscourse consist of utterances that are false (if taken literally),\nbut nevertheless it may be useful in some respects to stick to that\nsorts of discourse. \nA general assessment of fictionalism is difficult since the positions\nincluded under this heading differ considerably from each other. Much\ndepends on how exactly the “fictional attitude” is spelled\nout. Many versions of fictionalism are prone to the\n“phenomenological objection”: external talk about\nfictitious objects—to mention one of the applications of the\nfictionalist strategy that is particularly relevant in the context of\nthe present entry—does not feel like “make-believe”;\nintrospection does not reveal that we are engaged in any kind of\npretense when we say things like “Sherlock Holmes is one of the\nmost famous characters of popular literature” and the like. \nA position inspired by and in important respects similar to\nfictionalism that, however, avoids the phenomenological objection is\nEklund’s “indifferentism”. Indifferentism is the view\nthat speakers outside the “philosophy room” are often\nsimply indifferent with regards of the ontological implications of\ntheir utterances and thus are not committed to the existence of those\nentities whose existence is implied by their utterances. As Eklund\nemphasizes, however, indifferentism does not say anything about which\nentities one should accept in one’s ontology; it is, in\nthis sense, not an ontological thesis. (See Eklund 2005.) \nThe other worlds strategy has been proposed by Graham Priest (2005)\nand Francesco Berto (2008). Priest calls his theory noneism;\nBerto names it modal Meinongianism. The term\n“noneism” has been coined by Richard Routley, and Priest\nnot only takes over the name but also essential features of Routley’s\ntheory (among other things the assumption that basic principles of\nstandard logics, like the principle of contradiction, do not hold\nwithout restriction—without, of course, accepting that\neverything is true). \nProponents of the other worlds strategy reject both the\nnuclear-extranuclear strategy and the dual copula strategy. Instead,\nthey assume merely possible and even impossible worlds. All worlds\n(possible as well as impossible ones) share the same domain of\ndiscourse. But not all objects of the domain exist in all worlds.\nThus, Pegasus does not exist in the actual world, but it exists in a\nvariety of merely possible worlds (namely in those which are such as\nrepresented by the Greek mythology). \nAccording to the other worlds strategy, nonexistent objects literally\nhave the properties through which they are\n“characterized”—but they have these properties not\nin the actual world but only in those worlds in which they exist. \nThe other worlds strategy provides the following solution to the\nparadox of contradiction: The round square exists only in impossible\nworlds. In impossible worlds, however, the principle of contradiction\ndoes not hold. Therefore, the round square’s being both round and not\nround does not infringe the laws of logic which hold in those worlds\nin which the round square exists. \nIn the actual world, however, the round square is neither round nor\nsquare, since roundness and squareness are “existence-entailing\nproperties”, i.e., “b is round/square”\nentails “b exists”. Therefore, even if in the\nactual world (and in all other possible worlds) the law of\ncontradiction holds, the round square does not infringe this law,\nsince in these worlds the round square is neither round nor not\nround. \nIn the light of this theory, it is easy to explain why nobody has ever\nseen the round square or a golden mountain and why the round square is\nobviously not located in space: since the round square is neither\nround nor square in the actual world, there is no reason to assume\nthat it occupies space or is accessible to the senses. Similar\nconsiderations hold for the golden mountain. \nIt is worth noting that the postulation of existence-entailing\nproperties is an implicit rejection of Meinong’s principle of\nindependence, which is one of the cornerstones of Meinongian object\ntheory. \nProponents of the other worlds strategy reject the\nnuclear-extranuclear distinction because they find it “difficult\nto avoid the feeling that the class [of nuclear predicates] has been\ngerrymandered simply to avoid problems” (Priest 2005, 83). \nBut Priest’s proposal has difficulties of its\n own.[24]\n To mention some of them: First, Priest does not give a principled\ncharacterization of which properties are existence-entailing and which\nare not (which looks quite similar to the problem with the\nnuclear-extranuclear distinction which Priest points out in the above\nquotation). Second, it remains unclear which properties nonexistent\nobjects have in the actual world (apart from logical properties like\nbeing self-identical and intentional properties like being thought of\nby\n Priest).[25]\n Furthermore, Priest’s noneism raises difficult questions about\ncross-world identity and the ontological status of non-actual worlds.\nThe ontological status of non-actual worlds is far from obvious: they\nmay be taken to be concrete objects (structured sets of physical\nobjects) or abstract objects (sets of sentences, propositions, or\nstates of affairs). (For an elaborate survey of various conceptions of\nnon-actual worlds see Menzel\n 2014.)[26]\n Apart from this, it is doubtful whether Priest’s theory provides an\nadequate account of fictitious objects. Among other things, it does\nnot do justice to the widespread intuition that fictitious objects are\ncreated by the authors of the stories to which they\n belong.[27] \nAccording to the nuclear-extranuclear strategy, there are two kinds of\nproperties: nuclear and extranuclear ones. (Meinong 1972,\n §25)[28]\n An object’s nuclear properties are supposed to constitute the\nobject’s “nature”, while its extranuclear properties are\nsupposed to be external to the object’s nature. Nuclear properties\nare, for instance: being blue, being tall, kicking Socrates, having\nbeen kicked by Socrates, kicking somebody, being golden, being a\nmountain (Parsons 1980, 23). \nWhich properties are extranuclear? Terence Parsons distinguishes four\ncategories of “extranuclear predicates” (i.e., predicates\nthat stand for extranuclear properties): ontological\n(“exists”, “is mythical”, “is\nfictional”), modal (“is possible”, “is\nimpossible”), intentional (“is thought about by\nMeinong”, “is worshipped by someone”), technical\n(“is complete”) (Parsons 1980,\n 23).[29] \nNuclear properties are either constitutive or\nconsecutive, in Meinong’s terms (Meinong 1972, 176). An\nobject’s constitutive properties are those properties that are\nmentioned explicitly in a description that is used to pick out the\nobject. Thus, the constitutive properties of the golden mountain are\nbeing golden and being a mountain. An object’s consecutive properties\nare those properties that are somehow included or implied by the\nobject’s constitutive properties. Thus, among the consecutive\nproperties of the golden mountain are probably the properties of being\na material thing and of being extended. \nAccording to MOTo, the object called “the golden\nmountain” was ιx∀F(Fx\n≡ F = G ∨ F = M), i.e.,\nthe object that has the property of being golden and the property of\nbeing a mountain (and no other properties). According to the revised\nversion of object theory, the object called “the golden\nmountain” is the object that has all the nuclear properties that\nare implied by the nuclear property of being golden and the nuclear\nproperty of being a mountain, i.e.,\nιx∀Fn(Fnx\n≡ Gn ⇒ Fn ∨\nMn ⇒\n Fn).[30] \nHow does the nuclear-extranuclear distinction help to avoid the\nparadoxes mentioned in the section above? — Consider again the\nparadox from incompleteness: According to MOTo, there is an\nobject that has the property of being blue as its sole property (we’ve\ncalled it “the object blue”, for short), in\nlogical notation: ιx∀F(Fx\n≡ F = B). It seems to be true of the object\nblue, by definition, that it has exactly one\nproperty. Yet, the property of having exactly one property is clearly\ndistinct from the property of being blue. Thus, it seems that the\nobject blue has at least two properties. \nAccording to the revised version of object theory with the\nnuclear-extranuclear distinction (MOTne, for short), this\nparadox is avoided in the following way: The property of being blue is\na nuclear (constitutive) property, the property of having exactly one\nproperty, however, is an extranuclear property. There aren’t\nany objects that have exactly one property. There are only objects\nthat have exactly one constitutive (nuclear) property.\nObjects that have only a limited number of constitutive properties may\n(and necessarily do) have additional extranuclear\nproperties—like the property of having exactly n\nconstitutive properties or the property of being incomplete. The\nobject called “blue” is\nιx∀Fn(Fnx\n≡ Bn ⇒ Fn), i.e.,\nthe object that has the property of being blue as its sole\nconstitutive property. This does not rule out that the object\nblue may have additional extranuclear properties.\nThus, the paradox from incompleteness does not arise in\n MOTne.[31] \nTo Russell’s objection that the existent golden mountain infringes the\nlaw of contradiction (since it is both existent and nonexistent),\nadvocates of MOTne may reply as follows: Existence is an\nextranuclear property, but only nuclear properties can be constitutive\nproperties of an object. Therefore, according to MOTne,\nthere simply is no such object as\nιx∀F(Fx ≡ F =\nG ∨ F = M ∨ F = E!)\n(i.e., the existent golden mountain). (This route is taken by Dale\nJacquette and Richard Routley. See Jacquette 1996, 81 and Routley\n1980, 496.) \nThis solution, however, imposes quite a heavy restriction on the\ntheory of objects. Probably this was the reason why Meinong himself\ndid not even mention it as a possible solution. Instead, he introduced\nin addition to the nuclear-extranuclear distinction the doctrine\nof watered-down extranuclear properties: at least some\nextranuclear properties (existence, possibility) have nuclear\ncounterparts, i.e., “watered-down” versions of\nextranuclear properties (Meinong 1972,\n §37).[32] \nIf the extranuclear property of existence has a watered-down nuclear\ncounterpart, the following answer to Russell’s objection is available:\n“The existent golden mountain exists” is ambiguous. It may\nbe read as “The existent golden mountain exemplifies\nextranuclear existence” (which is false), or it may be read as\n“The existent golden mountain exemplifies nuclear\nexistence” (which is true). There is no contradiction between\n“The existent golden mountain exemplifies nuclear\nexistence” and “The existent golden mountain does not\nexist” (in the proper, extranuclear sense). \nDo other extranuclear properties (besides existence) also have nuclear\ncounterparts? Do perhaps all extranuclear properties have\nnuclear counterparts? Meinong himself is not explicit about this\npoint, but it seems very natural to extend the theory in this way.\nTerence Parsons has adopted this extension (Parsons 1980, 68), while\nDale Jacquette rejects the doctrine of watered-down extranuclear\nproperties altogether, even for existence and possibility (Jacquette\n1996, 85–87). \nThere are several paradoxes for which MOTne does not supply\na solution (even if it is supplemented with the doctrine of\nwatered-down extranuclear properties). It still seems that the round\nsquare infringes the law of contradiction; one still may wonder why it\nis impossible to discover round squares and golden mountains; and one\nstill may be baffled by the doctrine that nonexistent objects differ\nfrom existent ones only in that the former lack\n existence.[33] \nAccording to the dual copula strategy, there are two kinds of\nrelations between properties and\n individuals.[34]\n Different advocates of this strategy use different terminologies for\nit. Here are some of them: \nThe various versions of the dual copula strategy share the assumption\nthat the copula “is” is ambiguous. In what follows, we\nwill use the exemplification-encoding terminology. In addition, we\nwill borrow from Zalta the following notational convention:\n“Fb” stands for “b\nexemplifies the property of being F”.\n“bF” stands for “b\nencodes the property of being F”. Furthermore,\nwe will use MOTdc as an abbreviation for “the revised\nversion of Meinongian object theory which makes use of a dual copula\ndistinction”. \nAccording to MOTdc, the object called “the round\nsquare” is the object that encodes the property of being round\nand the property of being square (and all of the properties that are\nimplied by these properties) and no other properties. Thus, according\nto MOTdc, the object called “the round square”\nis ιx∀F(xF ≡ R\n⇒ F ∨ S ⇒ F). \nThus, according to MOTdc, the object called “the\nround square” encodes exactly two constitutive properties (being\nround and being square). However, over and above this, there are many\n(indeed infinitely many) properties that are\nexemplified by this object, for instance: the property of not\nbeing red, the property of not encoding the property of being red, the\nproperty of not being determined with respect to its side length, the\nproperty of having thought of by Bertrand Russell, the property of\nencoding exactly two constitutive properties, the property of being\nincompletely determined. \nTo mention another popular example, consider Pegasus: Among other\nthings, Pegasus encodes the properties of being a horse, of having\nwings, of having been tamed by Bellerophon. But there are also\ninfinitely many properties that Pegasus exemplifies, for instance, the\nproperty of not being determined with respect to the number of hairs\nin its tail, the property of being a character of Greek mythology, the\nproperty of being a fictitious object. \nIt must be emphasized that something that encodes the property of\nbeing a horse is not a horse (in the usual predicative sense\nof “is”). Analogously, something that encodes the\nproperties of being round and square is neither round nor square. That\nis to say, something that encodes the property of being a horse does\nnot belong to the class of horses, and something that encodes the\nproperties of being round and square does neither belong to the class\nof round things nor to the class of square things. Rather, things that\nencode the properties of being a horse or being a square or being a\nDanish prince are abstract objects—abstract in the\nsense that they are neither mental nor spatio-temporal things. In\ngeneral, everything which encodes at least one property is an abstract\nobject in this\n sense.[36] \nLet’s see how MOTdc avoids the alleged paradoxes mentioned\nin section 4. The first objection was that objects like the round\nsquare infringe the law of contradiction, since such objects would be\nboth round and not round. According to MOTdc, however, the\nobject called “the round\nsquare”—ιx∀F(xF\n≡ R ⇒ F ∨ S ⇒\nF)—is not round (i.e., does not exemplify the property\nof being round). Thus, no contradiction arises. \nThe second objection was that the existent golden mountain would\ninfringe the law of contradiction, since, if there were such an\nobject, it would be both existent and nonexistent. According to\nMOTdc, one could answer to this objection as follows: The\nobject called “the existent golden mountain” is\nιx∀F(xF ≡ G\n⇒ F ∨ M ⇒ F ∨ E!\n⇒ F). This object encodes the property of being\nexistent, but it does not exemplify it. Since\n“b encodes F” does not imply\n“b exemplifies F”, there is no\ncontradiction involved here. \nAccording to MOTdc, the object blue is\nιx∀F(xF ≡ B\n⇒ F), i.e., the object that encodes exclusively the\nproperties that are implied by being blue. Thus, the object\nblue exemplifies the property of encoding only the\nproperties that are implied by being blue. It is not the case that the\nobject blue has exactly one property and at the same time has\nat least two properties, at least not, if “has” is used in\nthe same sense in both occurrences. In this way, the apparent\ncontradiction disappears. \nFurthermore, according to MOTdc, the object called\n“the round square”, i.e.,\nιx∀F(xF ≡ R\n⇒ F ∨ S ⇒ F), does not occupy\nany region in space. More exactly, it does not exemplify the property\nof occupying some region in space (though, perhaps it encodes this\nproperty, if being round implies occupying some region in space).\nAnalogously, according to MOTdc, the object called\n“the golden mountain”, i.e.,\nιx∀F(xF ≡ G\n⇒ F ∨ M ⇒ F), does not\nexemplify the property of being accessible to the senses (at best, it\nencodes this property). Therefore, there is nothing paradoxical in the\nfact that nobody has ever seen a golden mountain and that it is\nimpossible to determine the location of the round square. \nFinally, MOTdc does not have the counterintuitive\nconsequence that the only difference between existent and nonexistent\nobjects is that the latter lack the property of being existent, such\nthat if an object goes out of existence, the vast majority of its\nproperties (like being human, loving pancakes, being violent-tempered,\nand so forth) stay exactly the same. Consider again my nonexistent\ngreen-eyed counterpart. According to MOTdc, this object\nencodes being human, being female, being a philosopher, and\nso forth, but does not exemplify these properties; therefore,\nit does not belong to the class of female philosophers, not even to\nthe class of humans or to the class of living beings. Thus, it is\nclear that my green-eyed counterpart’s nonexistence is by far not the\nonly difference between it and myself. In general, nonexistent objects\nare a particular kind of objects, according to\nMOTdc—very different from ordinary existent objects.\nIn what follows, we’ll call them “Meinongian objects”. \nMOTdc is very remote from MOTo. Recall that,\naccording to MOTo, the object called “the golden\nmountain” is not an abstract object but something as concrete as\nevery existent mountain in the world. Secondly, and related to this,\nthe idea that some objects do not exist is one of the cornerstones of\nMOTo—but it is not an essential feature of\nMOTdc, i.e., it doesn’t play an essential role within\nMOTdc. Within MOTdc, Meinongian objects are\ndefined as a particular kind of abstract objects (namely abstract\nobjects to which two kinds of predicates apply). Of course, one can\ndecide to say that these objects are “nonexistent”; but\nnothing hinges upon this decision. According to MOTo, the\nonly difference between Meinongian objects and normal objects consists\nin the alleged nonexistence of the former. However, in\nMOTdc, Meinongian objects are distinct from normal objects\nbecause only the former are abstract objects which encode properties.\nThis suffices to distinguish Meinongian objects from normal objects.\nThus, there is no need to assume that existence is a property of\nindividuals and that there is a difference between “There are\nobjects that are such-and-such” and “Objects that are\nsuch-and-such exist”. \nIf MOTdc is essentially different from MOTo, the\nquestion arises to what extent MOTdc can fulfill the tasks\nMOTo was supposed to fulfill. It seems that\nMOTdc cannot do everything MOTo was\nsupposed to do. First, consider the problem of intentionality: if\nsomebody fears the devil, does he fear an abstract object? —\nThis seems to be psychologically impossible, for an abstract object\ncannot do any harm to\n anybody.[37]\n Second, recall the problem of negative singular existence sentences:\nAstronomers claim that Vulcan does not exist. Do they thereby intend\nto deny the existence of an abstract object that only encodes being\nsuch-and-such a planet? — Probably not. They rather deny the\nexistence of something that is a planet, i.e., a concrete\nmaterial thing. Finally, consider the problem of discourse about the\npast and the future: when a teacher in a history of philosophy class\ntalks about Socrates, does she then intend to talk about an abstract\nobject that only encodes all of the properties that Socrates (the\n“real” one) once exemplified? — Presumably not. If\nthere is an object which she is intentionally directed at, then it is\nprobably the “real” Socrates, not its abstract\ncounterpart. \nIt may be that proponents of MOTdc find ways to meet these\nobjections such that their theories provide solutions for the problem\nof intentionality, the problem of singular existence sentences, and\nthe problem of reference to past and future objects. But even if they\ndon’t, it is beyound doubt that Neo-Meinongian theories can be and\nindeed are fruitful in many ways. In particular, they provide the\nbasis for a consistent realist ontology of fictitious objects. (For a\nvariety of further applications see in particular the writings of\nJacquette, Parsons, and Zalta.) \nThere are several ways in which Meinongian object theory can be\ndeveloped further. Here are some of\n them:[38] \n1. Both MOTne and MOTdc could perhaps benefit\nfrom a clarification of their basic distinctions, namely the\nnuclear-extranuclear distinction and the dual copula distinction,\nrespectively. \n2. One feature of Meinong’s mature object theory not mentioned so far\nis the “doctrine of implexion”. Implexion is a relation\nbetween incomplete and complete objects which seems to be very close\nto what is often called “instantiation”, i.e., a relation\nbetween universals and particulars. Incomplete objects are\n“implected” in complete ones. (See Meinong 1972,\n§29.) Meinong himself eventually came to interpret incomplete\nobjects as universals (see Meinong 1972, 739f). Meinongian object\ntheory may thus be interpreted as a sophisticated theory of\nuniversals, in particular as a theory of types (as opposed to\nproperties), which might open further fields of application. \n3. Throughout this entry, we have presupposed realism with respect to\nproperties. However, it is doubtful whether a theory of Meinongian\nobjects is necessarily ontologically committed to properties.\nAn ontologically neutral quantifier and the use of non-objectual\nvariables for predicates (not for names of predicates or\nproperties) may help to avoid this commitment and thus could make\nMeinongian object theory much more parsimonious.","contact.mail":"maria.reicher-marek@rwth-aachen.de","contact.domain":"rwth-aachen.de"}]
