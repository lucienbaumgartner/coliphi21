With the advent of\ngeneral relativity it has been entertained by serious physicists. But,\nespecially in the philosophy literature, there have been arguments that\ntime travel is inherently paradoxical. The most famous paradox is the\ngrandfather paradox: you travel back in time and kill your grandfather,\nthereby preventing your own existence. To avoid inconsistency some\ncircumstance will have to occur which makes you fail in this attempt to\nkill your grandfather. Doesn't this require some implausible constraint\non otherwise unrelated circumstances? We examine such worries in the\ncontext of modern physics. \n\n\n\nYou are very depressed. You are suicidally depressed. You have a\ngun. But you do not quite have the courage to point the gun at yourself\nand kill yourself in this way. If only someone else would kill you,\nthat would be a good thing. But you can't really ask someone to kill\nyou. That wouldn't be fair. You decide that if you remain this\ndepressed and you find a time machine, you will travel back in time to\njust about now, and kill your earlier self. That would be good. In that\nway you even would get rid of the depressing time you will spend\nbetween now and when you would get into that time machine. You start to\nmuse about the coherence of this idea, when something amazing happens.\nOut of nowhere you suddenly see someone coming towards you with a gun\npointed at you. In fact he looks very much like you, except that he is\nbleeding badly from his left eye, and can barely stand up straight. You\nare at peace. You look straight at him, calmly. He shoots. You feel a\nsearing pain in your left eye. Your mind is in chaos, you stagger\naround and accidentally enter a strange looking cubicle. You drift off\ninto unconsciousness. After a while, you can not tell how long, you\ndrift back into consciousness and stagger out of the cubicle. You see\nsomeone in the distance looking at you calmly and fixedly. You realize\nthat it is your younger self. He looks straight at you. You are in\nterrible pain. You have to end this, you have to kill him, really kill\nhim once and for all. You shoot him, but your eyesight is so bad that\nyour aim is off. You do not kill him, you merely damage his left eye.\nHe staggers off. You fall to the ground in agony, and decide to study\nthe paradoxes of time travel more seriously. \n\nThe standard worry about time travel is that it allows one to go\nback and kill one's younger self and thereby create paradox. More\ngenerally it allows for people or objects to travel back in time and to\ncause events in the past that are inconsistent with what in fact\nhappened. (See e.g., Gödel 1949, Earman 1972, Malament\n1985a&b, Horwich 1987.) A stone-walling response to this worry is\nthat by logic indeed inconsistent events can not both happen. Thus in\nfact all such schemes to create paradox are logically bound to fail. So\nwhat's the worry? \n\nWell, one worry is the question as to why such schemes always fail.\nDoesn't the necessity of such failures put prima facie unusual\nand unexpected constraints on the actions of people, or objects, that\nhave traveled in time? Don't we have good reason to believe that there\nare no such constraints (in our world) and thus that there is no time\ntravel (in our world)? We will later return to the issue of the\npalatability of such constraints, but first we want to discuss an\nargument that no constraints are imposed by time travel. \n\nWheeler and Feynman (1949) were the first to claim that the fact\nthat nature is continuous could be used to argue that causal influences\nfrom later events to earlier events, as are made possible by time\ntravel, will not lead to paradox without the need for any constraints.\nMaudlin (1990) showed how to make their argument precise and more\ngeneral, and argued that nonetheless it was not completely general. \n\nImagine the following set-up. We start off having a camera with a\nblack and white film ready to take a picture of whatever comes out of\nthe time machine. An object, in fact a developed film, comes out of the\ntime machine. We photograph it, and develop the film. The developed\nfilm is subsequently put in the time machine, and set to come out of\nthe time machine at the time the picture is taken. This surely will\ncreate a paradox: the developed film will have the opposite\ndistribution of black, white, and shades of gray, from the object that\ncomes out of the time machine. For developed black and white films\n(i.e. negatives) have the opposite shades of gray from the objects they\nare pictures of. But since the object that comes out of the time\nmachine is the developed film itself it we surely have a paradox. \n\nHowever, it does not take much thought to realize that there is no\nparadox here. What will happen is that a uniformly gray picture will\nemerge, which produces a developed film that has exactly the same\nuniform shade of gray. No matter what the sensitivity of the film is,\nas long as the dependence of the brightness of the developed film\ndepends in a continuous manner on the brightness of the object being\nphotographed, there will be a shade of gray that, when photographed,\nwill produce exactly the same shade of gray on the developed film. This\nis the essence of Wheeler and Feynman's idea. Let us first be a bit\nmore precise and then a bit more general. \n\nFor simplicity let us suppose that the film is always a uniform\nshade of gray (i.e. at any time the shade of gray does not vary by\nlocation on the film). The possible shades of gray of the film can then\nbe represented by the (real) numbers from 0, representing pure black,\nto 1, representing pure white. \n\nLet us now distinguish various stages in the chronogical order of\nthe life of the film. In stage S1 the film is\nyoung; it has just been placed in the camera and is ready to be\nexposed. It is then exposed to the object that comes out of the time\nmachine. (That object in fact is a later stage of the film itself). By\nthe time we come to stage S2 of the life of the\nfilm, it has been developed and is about to enter the time machine.\nStage S3 occurs just after it exits the time\nmachine and just before it is photographed. Stage\nS4 occurs after it has been photographed and before\nit starts fading away. Let us assume that the film starts out in stage\nS1 in some uniform shade of gray, and that the only\nsignificant change in the shade of gray of the film occurs between\nstages S1 and S2. During that\nperiod it acquires a shade of gray that depends on the shade of gray of\nthe object that was photographed. I.e., the shade of gray that the film\nacquires at stage S2 depends on the shade of gray\nit has at stage S3. The influence of the shade of\ngray of the film at stage S3, on the shade of gray\nof the film at stage S2, can be represented as a\nmapping, or function, from the real numbers between 0 and 1\n(inclusive), to the real numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive). Let us\nsuppose that the process of photography is such that if one imagines\nvarying the shade of gray of an object in a smooth, continuous manner\nthen the shade of gray of the developed picture of that object will\nalso vary in a smooth, continuous manner. This implies that the\nfunction in question will be a continuous function. Now any continuous\nfunction from the real numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive) to the real\nnumbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive) must map at least one number to\nitself. One can quickly convince oneself of this by graphing such\nfunctions. For one will quickly see that any continuous function f from\n[0,1] to [0,1] must intersect the line x=y somewhere,\nand thus there must be at least one point x such that\nf(x)=x. Such points are called fixed points\nof the function. Now let us think about what such a fixed point\nrepresents. It represents a shade of gray such that, when photographed,\nit will produce a developed film with exactly that same shade of gray.\nThe existence of such a fixed point implies a solution to the apparent\nparadox. \n\nLet us now be more general and allow color photography. One can\nrepresent each possible color of an object (of uniform color) by the\nproportions of blue, green and red that make up that color. (This is\nwhy television screens can produce all possible colors.) Thus one can\nrepresent all possible colors of an object by three points on three\northogonal lines x, y and z, that is to say,\nby a point in a three-dimensional cube. This cube is also known as the\n‘Cartesian product’ of the three line segments. Now, one\ncan also show that any continuous map from such a cube to itself must\nhave at least one fixed point. So color photography can not be used to\ncreate time travel paradoxes either! \n\nEven more generally, consider some system P which, as in\nthe above example, has the following life. It starts in some state\nS1, it interacts with an object that comes out of a\ntime machine (which happens to be its older self), it travels back in\ntime, it interacts with some object (which happens to be its younger\nself), and finally it grows old and dies. Let us assume that the set of\npossible states of P can be represented by a Cartesian product\nof n closed intervals of the reals, i.e., let us assume that\nthe topology of the state-space of P is isomorphic to a finite\nCartesian product of closed intervals of the reals. Let us further\nassume that the development of P in time, and the dependence\nof that development on the state of objects that it interacts with, is\ncontinuous. Then, by a well-known fixed point theorem in topology (see\ne.g., Hocking and Young 1961, p 273), no matter what the nature of the\ninteraction is, and no matter what the initial state of the object is,\nthere will be at least one state S3 of the older\nsystem (as it emerges from the time travel machine) that will influence\nthe initial state S1 of the younger system (when it\nencounters the older system) so that, as the younger system becomes\nolder, it develops exactly into state S3. Thus\nwithout imposing any constraints on the initial state\nS1 of the system P, we have shown that\nthere will always be perfectly ordinary, non-paradoxical, solutions, in\nwhich everything that happens, happens according to the usual laws of\ndevelopment. Of course, there is looped causation, hence presumably\nalso looped explanation, but what do you expect if there is looped\ntime? \n\nUnfortunately, for the fan of time travel, a little reflection\nsuggests that there are systems for which the needed fixed point\ntheorem does not hold. Imagine, for instance, that we have a dial that\ncan only rotate in a plane. We are going to put the dial in the time\nmachine. Indeed we have decided that if we see the later stage of the\ndial come out of the time machine set at angle x, then we will\nset the dial to x+90, and throw it into the time machine. Now\nit seems we have a paradox, since the mapping that consists of a\nrotation of all points in a circular state-space by 90 degrees does not\nhave a fixed point. And why wouldn't some state-spaces have the\ntopology of a circle? \n\nHowever, we have so far not used another continuity assumption which\nis also a reasonable assumption. So far we have only made the following\ndemand: the state the dial is in at stage S2 must\nbe a continuous function of the state of the dial at stage\nS3. But, the state of the dial at stage\nS2 is arrived at by taking the state of the dial at\nstage S1, and rotating it over some angle. It is\nnot merely the case that the effect of the interaction, namely the\nstate of the dial at stage S2, should be a\ncontinuous function of the cause, namely the state of the dial at stage\nS3. It is additionally the case that path taken to\nget there, the way the dial is rotated between stages\nS1 and S2 must be a continuous\nfunction of the state at stage S3. And, rather\nsurprisingly, it turns out that this can not be done. Let us illustrate\nwhat the problem is before going to a more general demonstration that\nthere must be a fixed point solution in the dial case. \n\nForget time travel for the moment. Suppose that you and I each have\na watch with a single dial neither of which is running. My watch is set\nat 12. You are going to announce what your watch is set at. My task is\ngoing to be to adjust my watch to yours no matter what announcement you\nmake. And my actions should have a continuous (single valued)\ndependence on the time that you announce. Surprisingly, this is not\npossible! For instance, suppose that if you announce “12”,\nthen I achieve that setting on my watch by doing nothing. Now imagine\nslowly and continuously increasing the announced times, starting at 12.\nBy continuity, I must achieve each of those settings by rotating my\ndial to the right. If at some point I switch and achieve the announced\ngoal by a rotation of my dial to the left, I will have introduced a\ndiscontinuity in my actions, a discontinuity in the actions that I take\nas a function of the announced angle. So I will be forced, by\ncontinuity, to achieve every announcement by rotating the dial to the\nright. But, this rotation to the right will have to be abruptly\ndiscontinued as the announcements grow larger and I eventually approach\n12 again, since I achieved 12 by not rotating the dial at all. So,\nthere will be a discontinuity at 12 at the latest. In general,\ncontinuity of my actions as a function of announced times can not be\nmaintained throughout if I am to be able to replicate all possible\nsettings. Another way to see the problem is that one can similarly\nreason that, as one starts with 12, and imagines continuously making\nthe announced times earlier, one will be forced, by continuity, to\nachieve the announced times by rotating the dial to the left. But the\nconclusions drawn from the assumption of continuous increases and the\nassumption of continuous decreases are inconsistent. So we have an\ninconsistency following from the assumption of continuity and the\nassumption that I always manage to set my watch to your watch. So, a\ndial developing according to a continuous dynamics from a given initial\nstate, can not be set up so as to react to a second dial, with which it\ninteracts, in such a way that it is guaranteed to always end up set at\nthe same angle as the second dial. Similarly, it can not be set up so\nthat it is guaranteed to always end up set at 90 degrees to the setting\nof the second dial. All of this has nothing to do with time travel.\nHowever, the impossibility of such set ups is what prevents us from\nenacting the rotation by 90 degrees that would create paradox in the\ntime travel setting. \n\nLet us now give the positive result that with such dials there will\nalways be fixed point solutions, as long as the dynamics is continuous.\nLet us call the state of the dial before it interacts with its older\nself the initial state of the dial. And let us call the state of the\ndial after it emerges from the time machine the final state of the\ndial. We can represent the possible initial and final states of the\ndial by the angles x and y that the dial can point at\ninitially and finally. The set of possible initial plus final states\nthus forms a torus. (See figure 1.) \n\nSuppose that the dial starts at angle I. The initial angle\nI that the dial is at before it encounters its older self, and\nthe set of all possible final angles that the dial can have when it\nemerges from the time machine is represented by the circle I\non the torus (see figure 1). Given any possible angle of the emerging\ndial the dial initially at angle I will develop to some other\nangle. One can picture this development by rotating each point on\nI in the horizontal direction by the relevant amount. Since\nthe rotation has to depend continuously on the angle of the emerging\ndial, ring I during this development will deform into some\nloop L on the torus. Loop L thus represents the angle\nx that the dial is at when it is thrown into the time machine,\ngiven that it started at angle I and then encountered a dial\n(its older self) which was at angle y when it emerged from the\ntime machine. We therefore have consistency if x=y\nfor some x and y on loop L. Now, let loop\nC be the loop which consists of all the points on the torus\nfor which x=y. Ring I intersects C\nat point <i,i>. Obviously any continuous\ndeformation of I must still intersect C somewhere. So\nL must intersect C somewhere, say at\n<j,j>. But that means that no matter how the\ndevelopment of the dial starting at I depends on the angle of\nthe emerging dial, there will be some angle for the emerging dial such\nthat the dial will develop exactly into that angle (by the time it\nenters the time machine) under the influence of that emerging dial.\nThis is so no matter what angle one starts with, and no matter how the\ndevelopment depends on the angle of the emerging dial. Thus even for a\ncircular state-space there are no constraints needed other than\ncontinuity. \n\nUnfortunately there are state-spaces that escape even this argument.\nConsider for instance a pointer that can be set to all values between 0\nand 1, where 0 and 1 are not possible values. That is, suppose that we\nhave a state-space that is isomorphic to an open set of real numbers.\nNow suppose that we have a machine that sets the pointer to half the\nvalue that the pointer is set at when it emerges from the time\nmachine. \n\nSuppose the pointer starts at value I. As before we can\nrepresent the combination of this initial position and all possible\nfinal positions by the line I. Under the influence of the\npointer coming out of the time machine the pointer value will develop\nto a value that equals half the value of the final value that it\nencountered. We can represent this development as the continuous\ndeformation of line I into line L, which is indicated\nby the arrows in Figure 2. This development is fully continuous. Points\n<x,y> on line I represent the initial\nposition x=I of the (young) pointer, and the position\ny of the older pointer as it emerges from the time machine. Points\n<x,y> on line L represent the position\nx that the younger pointer should develop into, given that it\nencountered the older pointer emerging from the time machine set at\nposition y. Since the pointer is designed to develop to half\nthe value of the pointer that it encounters, the line L\ncorresponds to x=1/2y. We have\nconsistency if there is some point such that it develops into that\npoint, if it encounters that point. Thus, we have consistency if there\nis some point <x,y> on line L such\nthat x=y. However, there is no such point: lines\nL and C do not intersect. Thus there is no consistent\nsolution, despite the fact that the dynamics is fully continuous. \n\nOf course if 0 were a possible value L and C would\nintersect at 0. This is surprising and strange: adding one point to the\nset of possible values of a quantity here makes the difference between\nparadox and peace. One might be tempted to just add the extra point to\nthe state-space in order to avoid problems. After all, one might say,\nsurely no measurements could ever tell us whether the set of possible\nvalues includes that exact point or not. Unfortunately there can be\ngood theoretical reasons for supposing that some quantity has a\nstate-space that is open: the set of all possible speeds of massive\nobjects in special relativity surely is an open set, since it includes\nall speeds up to, but not including, the speed of light. Quantities\nthat have possible values that are not bounded also lead to counter\nexamples to the presented fixed point argument. And it is not obvious\nto us why one should exclude such possibilities. So the argument that\nno constraints are needed is not fully general. \n\nAn interesting question of course is: exactly for which state-spaces\nmust there be such fixed points. We do not know the general answer.\n(But see Kutach 2003 for more on this issue.) \n\nTime travel has recently been discussed quite extensively in the\ncontext of general relativity. Time travel can occur in general\nrelativistic models in which one has closed time-like curves (CTC's). A\ntime like curve is simply a space-time trajectory such that the speed\nof light is never equalled or exceeded along this trajectory. Time-like\ncurves thus represent the possible trajectories of ordinary objects. If\nthere were time-like curves which were closed (formed a loop), then\ntravelling along such a curve one would never exceed the speed of\nlight, and yet after a certain amount of (proper) time one would return\nto a point in space-time that one previously visited. Or, by staying\nclose to such a CTC, one could come arbitrarily close to a point in\nspace-time that one previously visited. General relativity, in a\nstraightforward sense, allows time travel: there appear to be many\nspace-times compatible with the fundamental equations of General\nRelativity in which there are CTC's. Space-time, for instance, could\nhave a Minkowski metric everywhere, and yet have CTC's everywhere by\nhaving the temporal dimension (topologically) rolled up as a circle.\nOr, one can have wormhole connections between different parts of\nspace-time which allow one to enter ‘mouth A’ of\nsuch a wormhole connection, travel through the wormhole, exit the\nwormhole at ‘mouth B’ and re-enter ‘mouth\nA’ again. Or, one can have space-times which\ntopologically are R4, and yet have CTC's due to the\n‘tilting’ of light cones (Gödel space-times, Taub-NUT\nspace-times, etc.) \n\nGeneral relativity thus appears to provide ample opportunity for\ntime travel. Note that just because there are CTC's in a space-time,\nthis does not mean that one can get from any point in the space-time to\nany other point by following some future directed timelike curve. In\nmany space-times in which there are CTC's such CTC's do not occur all\nover space-time. Some parts of space-time can have CTC's while other\nparts do not. Let us call the part of a space-time that has CTC's the\n“time travel region\" of that space-time, while calling the rest\nof that space-time the \"normal region\". More precisely, the “time\ntravel region\" consists of all the space-time points p such\nthat there exists a (non-zero length) timelike curve that starts at\np and returns to p. Now let us start examining\nspace-times with CTC's a bit more closely for potential problems. \n\nIn order to get a feeling for the sorts of implications that closed\ntimelike curves can have, it may be useful to consider two simple\nmodels. In space-times with closed timelike curves the traditional\ninitial value problem cannot be framed in the usual way. For it\npresupposes the existence of Cauchy surfaces, and if there are CTCs\nthen no Cauchy surface exists. (A Cauchy surface is a spacelike surface\nsuch that every inextendible timelike curve crosses it exactly once.\nOne normally specifies initial conditions by giving the conditions on\nsuch a surface.) Nonetheless, if the topological complexities of the\nmanifold are appropriately localized, we can come quite close. Let us\ncall an edgeless spacelike surface S a quasi-Cauchy\nsurface if it divides the rest of the manifold into two parts such that\na) every point in the manifold can be connected by a timelike curve to\nS, and b) any timelike curve which connects a point in one\nregion to a point in the other region intersects S exactly\nonce. It is obvious that a quasi-Cauchy surface must entirely inhabit\nthe normal region of the space-time; if any point p of\nS is in the time travel region, then any timelike curve which\nintersects p can be extended to a timelike curve which\nintersects S near p again. In extreme cases of time\ntravel, a model may have no normal region at all (e.g., Minkowski\nspace-time rolled up like a cylinder in a time-like direction), in\nwhich case our usual notions of temporal precedence will not apply. But\ntemporal anomalies like wormholes (and time machines) can be\nsufficiently localized to permit the existence of quasi-Cauchy\nsurfaces. \n\nGiven a timelike orientation, a quasi-Cauchy surface\nunproblematically divides the manifold into its past (i.e.,\nall points that can be reached by past-directed timelike curves from\nS) and its future (ditto mutatis mutandis).\nIf the whole past of S is in the normal region of the\nmanifold, then S is a partial Cauchy surface: every\ninextendible timelike curve which exists to the past of S\nintersects S exactly once, but (if there is time travel in the\nfuture) not every inextendible timelike curve which exists to the\nfuture of S intersects S. Now we can ask a\nparticularly clear question: consider a manifold which contains a time\ntravel region, but also has a partial Cauchy surface S, such\nthat all of the temporal funny business is to the future of S.\nIf all you could see were S and its past, you would not know\nthat the space-time had any time travel at all. The question is: are\nthere any constraints on the sort of data which can be put on\nS and continued to a global solution of the dynamics which are\ndifferent from the constraints (if any) on the data which can be put on\na Cauchy surface in a simply connected manifold and continued to a\nglobal solution? If there is time travel to our future, might we we\nable to tell this now, because of some implied oddity in the\narrangement of present things? \n\nIt is not at all surprising that there might be constraints on the\ndata which can be put on a locally space-like surface which passes\nthrough the time travel region: after all, we never think we can freely\nspecify what happens on a space-like surface and on another such\nsurface to its future, but in this case the surface at issue lies to\nits own future. But if there were particular constraints for data on a\npartial Cauchy surface then we would apparently need to have to rule\nout some sorts of otherwise acceptable states on S if there is\nto be time travel to the future of S. We then might be able to\nestablish that there will be no time travel in the future by simple\ninspection of the present state of the universe. As we will see, there\nis reason to suspect that such constraints on the partial Cauchy\nsurface are non-generic. But we are getting ahead of ourselves: first\nlet's consider the effect of time travel on a very simple dynamics. \n\nThe simplest possible example is the Newtonian theory of perfectly\nelastic collisions among equally massive particles in one spatial\ndimension. The space-time is two-dimensional, so we can represent it\ninitially as the Euclidean plane, and the dynamics is completely\nspecified by two conditions. When particles are traveling freely, their\nworld lines are straight lines in the space-time, and when two\nparticles collide, they exchange momenta, so the collision looks like\nan ‘X’ in space-time, with each particle changing\nits momentum at the\n impact.[1]\n The dynamics is purely local, in that one\ncan check that a set of world-lines constitutes a model of the dynamics\nby checking that the dynamics is obeyed in every arbitrarily small\nregion. It is also trivial to generate solutions from arbitrary initial\ndata if there are no CTCs: given the initial positions and momenta of a\nset of particles, one simply draws a straight line from each particle\nin the appropriate direction and continues it indefinitely. Once all\nthe lines are drawn, the worldline of each particle can be traced from\ncollision to collision. The boundary value problem for this dynamics is\nobviously well-posed: any set of data at an instant yields a unique\nglobal solution, constructed by the method sketched above. \n\nWhat happens if we change the topology of the space-time by hand to\nproduce CTCs? The simplest way to do this is depicted in figure 3: we\ncut and paste the space-time so it is no longer simply connected by\nidentifying the line L− with the line L+.\nParticles “going in” to L+ from below\n“emerge” from L− , and particles\n“going in” to L− from below\n“emerge” from L+. \n\nHow is the boundary-value problem changed by this alteration in the\nspace-time? Before the cut and paste, we can put arbitrary data on the\nsimultaneity slice S and continue it to a unique solution.\nAfter the change in topology, S is no longer a Cauchy surface,\nsince a CTC will never intersect it, but it is a partial Cauchy\nsurface. So we can ask two questions. First, can arbitrary data on\nS always be continued to a global solution? Second, is that\nsolution unique? If the answer to the first question is no,\nthen we have a backward-temporal constraint: the existence of the\nregion with CTCs places constraints on what can happen on S\neven though that region lies completely to the future of S. If\nthe answer to the second question is no, then we have an odd\nsort of indeterminism: the complete physical state on S does\nnot determine the physical state in the future, even though the local\ndynamics is perfectly deterministic and even though there is no other\npast edge to the space-time region in S's future (i.e., there\nis nowhere else for boundary values to come from which could\ninfluence the state of the region). \n\nIn this case the answer to the first question is yes and to\nthe second is no: there are no constraints on the data which\ncan be put on S, but those data are always consistent with an\ninfinitude of different global solutions. The easy way to see that\nthere always is a solution is to construct the minimal solution in the\nfollowing way. Start drawing straight lines from S as required\nby the initial data. If a line hits L− from the bottom,\njust continue it coming out of the top of L+ in the\nappropriate place, and if a line hits L+ from the bottom,\ncontinue it emerging from L− at the appropriate place.\nFigure 4 represents the minimal solution for a single particle which\nenters the time-travel region from the left: \n\nThe particle ‘travels back in time’ three times. It is\nobvious that this minimal solution is a global solution, since the\nparticle always travels inertially. \n\nBut the same initial state on S is also consistent with\nother global solutions. The new requirement imposed by the topology is\njust that the data going into L+ from the bottom match the\ndata coming out of L− from the top, and the data going\ninto L- from the bottom match the data coming out of\nL+ from the top. So we can add any number of vertical lines\nconnecting L- and L+ to a solution and still have a\nsolution. For example, adding a few such lines to the minimal solution\nyields: \n\nThe particle now collides with itself twice: first before it reaches\nL+ for the first time, and again shortly before it exits the\nCTC region. From the particle's point of view, it is traveling to the\nright at a constant speed until it hits an older version of itself and\ncomes to rest. It remains at rest until it is hit from the right by a\nyounger version of itself, and then continues moving off, and the same\nprocess repeats later. It is clear that this is a global model of the\ndynamics, and that any number of distinct models could be generating by\nvarying the number and placement of vertical lines. \n\nKnowing the data on S, then, gives us only incomplete\ninformation about how things will go for the particle. We know that the\nparticle will enter the CTC region, and will reach L+, we know\nthat it will be the only particle in the universe, we know exactly\nwhere and with what speed it will exit the CTC region. But we cannot\ndetermine how many collisions the particle will undergo (if any), nor\nhow long (in proper time) it will stay in the CTC region. If the\nparticle were a clock, we could not predict what time it would indicate\nwhen exiting the region. Furthermore, the dynamics gives us no handle\non what to think of the various possibilities: there are no\nprobabilities assigned to the various distinct possible outcomes. \n\nChanging the topology has changed the mathematics of the situation\nin two ways, which tend to pull in opposite directions. On the one\nhand, S is no longer a Cauchy surface, so it is perhaps not\nsurprising that data on S do not suffice to fix a unique\nglobal solution. But on the other hand, there is an added constraint:\ndata “coming out” of L− must exactly match\ndata “going in” to L+, even though what comes out\nof L− helps to determine what goes into L+.\nThis added consistency constraint tends to cut down on solutions,\nalthough in this case the additional constraint is more than outweighed\nby the freedom to consider various sorts of data on\nL+/L-. \n\nThe fact that the extra freedom outweighs the extra constraint also\npoints up one unexpected way that the supposed paradoxes of time travel\nmay be overcome. Let's try to set up a paradoxical situation using the\nlittle closed time loop above. If we send a single particle into the\nloop from the left and do nothing else, we know exactly where it will\nexit the right side of the time travel region. Now suppose we station\nsomeone at the other side of the region with the following charge: if\nthe particle should come out on the right side, the person is to do\nsomething to prevent the particle from going in on the left in\nthe first place. In fact, this is quite easy to do: if we send a\nparticle in from the right, it seems that it can exit on the left and\ndeflect the incoming left-hand particle. \n\nCarrying on our reflection in this way, we further realize that if\nthe particle comes out on the right, we might as well send it\nback in order to deflect itself from entering in the first place. So\nall we really need to do is the following: set up a perfectly\nreflecting particle mirror on the right-hand side of the time travel\nregion, and launch the particle from the left so that—if\nnothing interferes with it—it will just barely hit\nL+. Our paradox is now apparently complete. If, on the one\nhand, nothing interferes with the particle it will enter the\ntime-travel region on the left, exit on the right, be reflected from\nthe mirror, re-enter from the right, and come out on the left to\nprevent itself from ever entering. So if it enters, it gets deflected\nand never enters. On the other hand, if it never enters then nothing\ngoes in on the left, so nothing comes out on the right, so nothing is\nreflected back, and there is nothing to deflect it from entering. So if\nit doesn't enter, then there is nothing to deflect it and it enters. If\nit enters, then it is deflected and doesn't enter; if it doesn't enter\nthen there is nothing to deflect it and it enters: paradox\ncomplete. \n\nBut at least one solution to the supposed paradox is easy to\nconstruct: just follow the recipe for constructing the minimal\nsolution, continuing the initial trajectory of the particle (reflecting\nit the mirror in the obvious way) and then read of the number and\ntrajectories of the particles from the resulting diagram. We get the\nresult of figure 6: \n\nAs we can see, the particle approaching from the left never reaches\nL+: it is deflected first by a particle which emerges from\nL-. But it is not deflected by itself, as the paradox\nsuggests, it is deflected by another particle. Indeed, there are now\nfour particles in the diagram: the original particle and three\nparticles which are confined to closed time-like curves. It is not the\nleftmost particle which is reflected by the mirror, nor even the\nparticle which deflects the leftmost particle; it is another particle\naltogether. \n\nThe paradox gets it traction from an incorrect presupposition: if\nthere is only one particle in the world at S then there is\nonly one particle which could participate in an interaction in the time\ntravel region: the single particle would have to interact with its\nearlier (or later) self. But there is no telling what might come out of\nL− : the only requirement is that whatever comes out\nmust match what goes in at L+. So if you go to the trouble of\nconstructing a working time machine, you should be prepared for a\ndifferent kind of disappointment when you attempt to go back and kill\nyourself: you may be prevented from entering the machine in the first\nplace by some completely unpredictable entity which emerges from it.\nAnd once again a peculiar sort of indeterminism appears: if there are\nmany self-consistent things which could prevent you from entering,\nthere is no telling which is even likely to materialize. \n\nSo when the freedom to put data on L− outweighs the\nconstraint that the same data go into L+, instead of paradox\nwe get an embarrassment of riches: many solution consistent with the\ndata on S. To see a case where the constraint\n“outweighs” the freedom, we need to construct a very\nparticular, and frankly artificial, dynamics and topology. Consider the\nspace of all linear dynamics for a scalar field on a lattice. (The\nlattice can be though of as a simple discrete space-time.) We will\ndepict the space-time lattice as a directed graph. There is to be a\nscalar field defined at every node of the graph, whose value at a given\nnode depends linearly on the values of the field at nodes which have\narrows which lead to it. Each edge of the graph can be assigned a\nweighting factor which determines how much the field at the input node\ncontributes to the field at the output node. If we name the nodes by\nthe letters a, b, c, etc., and the edges by\ntheir endpoints in the obvious way, then we can label the weighting\nfactors by the edges they are associated with in an equally obvious\nway. \n\nSuppose that the graph of the space-time lattice is\nacyclic, as in figure 7. (A graph is Acyclic if one\ncan not travel in the direction of the arrows and go in a loop.) \n\nIt is easy to regard a set of nodes as the analog of a Cauchy\nsurface, e.g., the set {a, b, c}, and it is\nobvious if arbitrary data are put on those nodes the data will generate\na unique solution in the\n future.[2]\n If the value of the\nfield at node a is 3 and at node b is 7, then its\nvalue at node d will be 3Wad and\nits value at node e will be 3Wae\n+ 7Wbe. By varying the weighting factors\nwe can adjust the dynamics, but in an acyclic graph the future\nevolution of the field will always be unique. \n\nLet us now again artificially alter the topology of the lattice to\nadmit CTCs, so that the graph now is cyclic. One of the simplest such\ngraphs is depicted in figure 8: there are now paths which lead from\nz back to itself, e.g., z to y to\nz. \n\nCan we now put arbitrary data on v and w, and\ncontinue that data to a global solution? Will the solution be\nunique? \n\nIn the generic case, there will be a solution and the solution will\nbe unique. The equations for the value of the field at x,\ny, and z are: \n\nSolving these equations for z yields \n\nz =\n(vWvxWxz\n+\nwWwyWyz)/\n(1 − WzxWxz\n−\nWzyWyz), \n\nwhich gives a unique value for z in the generic case. But\nlooking at the space of all possible dynamics for this lattice (i.e.,\nthe space of all possible weighting factors), we find a singularity in\nthe case where\n1−WzxWxz −\nWzyWyz = 0.\nIf we choose weighting factors in just this way, then arbitrary data at\nv and w cannot be continued to a global solution.\nIndeed, if the scalar field is everywhere non-negative, then this\nparticular choice of dynamics puts ironclad constraints on the value of\nthe field at v and w: the field there must be zero\n(assuming Wvx and Wwy to be\nnon-zero), and similarly all nodes in their past must have field value\nzero. If the field can take negative values, then the values at\nv and w must be so chosen that\nvWvxWxz\n=\n−wWwyWyz.\nIn either case, the field values at v and w are\nseverely constrained by the existence of the CTC region even though\nthese nodes lie completely to the past of that region. It is this sort\nof constraint which we find to be unlike anything which appears in\nstandard physics. \n\nOur toy models suggest three things. The first is that it may be\nimpossible to prove in complete generality that arbitrary data on a\npartial Cauchy surface can always be continued to a global\nsolution: our artificial case provides an example where it cannot. The\nsecond is that such odd constraints are not likely to be generic: we\nhad to delicately fine-tune the dynamics to get a problem. The third is\nthat the opposite problem, namely data on a partial Cauchy surface\nbeing consistent with many different global solutions, is\nlikely to be generic: we did not have to do any fine-tuning to get this\nresult. And this leads to a peculiar sort of indeterminism: the entire\nstate on S does not determine what will happen in the future\neven though the local dynamics is deterministic and there are no other\n“edges” to space-time from which data could influence the\nresult. What happens in the time travel region is constrained but not\ndetermined by what happens on S, and the dynamics does not\neven supply any probabilities for the various possibilities.\nThe example of the photographic negative discussed in section 3, then,\nseems likely to be unusual, for in that case there is a unique\nfixed point for the dynamics, and the set-up plus the dynamical laws\ndetermine the outcome. In the generic case one would rather\nexpect multiple fixed points, with no room for anything to\ninfluence, even probabilistically, which would be\nrealized. \n\nIt is ironic that time travel should lead generically not to\ncontradictions or to constraints (in the normal region) but to\nunderdetermination of what happens in the time travel region\nby what happens everywhere else (an underdetermination tied neither to\na probabilistic dynamics or to a free edge to space-time). The\ntraditional objection to time travel is that it leads to\ncontradictions: there is no consistent way to complete an arbitrarily\nconstructed story about how the time traveler intends to act. Instead,\nthough, it appears that the problem is underdetermination: the story\ncan be consistently completed in many different ways. \n\nThe two toys models presented above have the virtue of being\nmathematically tractable, but they involve certain simplifications and\npotential problems that lead to trouble if one tries to make them more\ncomplicated. Working through these difficulties will help highlight the\nconditions we have made use of. \n\nConsider a slight modification of the first simple model proposed to\nus by Adam Elga. Let the particles have an electric charge,\nwhich produces forces according to Coulomb’s law. Then set up a\nsituation like that depicted in figure 9: \n\nFigure 9: Set-up for Elga's Paradox \n\nThe dotted line indicates the path the particle will follow if no\nforces act upon it. The point labeled P is the left edge of\nthe time-travel region; the two labels are a reminder that the point at\nthe bottom and the point at the top are one and the same. \n\nElga's paradox is as follows: if no force acts on the particle, then\nit will enter the time-travel region. But if it enters the time travel\nregion, and hence reappears along the bottom edge, then its later self\nwill interact electrically with its earlier self, and the earlier self\nwill be deflected away from the time-travel region. It is easy to set\nup the case so that the deflection will be enough to keep the particle\nfrom ever entering the time-travel region in the first place. (For\ninstance, let the momentum of the incoming particle towards the time\ntravel region be very small. The mere existence of an identically\ncharged particle inside the time travel region will then be sufficient\nto deflect the incoming particle so that it never reaches\nL+.) But, of course, if the particle never enters\nthe region at all, then it will not be there to deflect\nitself…. \n\nOne might suspect that some complicated collection of charged\nparticles in the time-travel-region can save the day, as it did with\nour mirror-reflection problem above. But (unless there are infinitely\nmany such particles) this can't work, as conservation of particle\nnumber and linear momentum show. Suppose that some finite collection of\nparticles emerges from L- and supplies the\nrepulsive electric force needed to deflect the incoming particle. Then\nexactly the same collection of particles must be “absorbed”\nat L+. So at all times after\nL+, the only particle there is in the world is the\nincoming particle, which has now been deflected away from its original\ntrajectory. \n\nThe deflection, though, means that the linear momentum of the\nparticle has changed from what is was before L-.\nBut that is impossible, by conservation of linear momementum. No matter\nhow the incoming particle interacts with particles in the time-travel\nregion, or how those particle interact with each other, total linear\nmomentum is conserved by the interaction. And whatever net linear\nmomentum the time-travelling particles have when they emerge from\nL-, that much linear momentum most be absorbed at\nL+. So the momentum of the incoming particle can't\nbe changed by the interaction: the particle can't have been deflected.\n(One could imagine trying to create a sort of “S” curve in\nthe trajectory of the incoming particle, first bending to the left and\nthen to the right, which leaves its final momentum equal to its initial\nmomentum, but moving it over in space so it misses\nL+. However, if the force at issue is repulsive,\nthen the bending back to the right can't be done. In the mirror example\nabove, the path of the incoming particle can be changed without\nviolating the conservation of momentum because at the end of the\nprocess momentum has been transferred to the mirror.) \n\nHow does Elga's example escape our analysis? Why can't a contintuity\nprinciple guarantee the existence of a solution here? \n\nThe continuity assumption breaks down because of two features of the\nexample: the concentration of the electric charge on a point particle,\nand the way we have treated (or, more accurately, failed to treat) the\npoint P, the edge of L+ (and\nL-). We have assumed that a point particle either\nhits L+, and then emerges from\nL-, or else it misses L+ and\nsails on into the region of space-time above it. This means that the\ncharge on the incoming particle only has two possibilities: either it\nis transported whole back in time or it completely avoids time travel\naltogether. Let's see how it alters the situation to imagine the charge\nitself to be continuous divisible. \n\nSuppose that, instead of being concentrated at a point, the incoming\nobject is a little stick, with electric charge distributed even across\nit (figure 10). \n\nFigure 10: Elga's Paradox with a Charged Bar \n\nOnce again, we set things up so that if there are no forces on the\nbar, it will be completely absorbed at L+. But we\nnow postulate that if the bar should hit the point P,\nit will fracture: part of it (the part that hits L+) will be\nsent back in time and the rest will continue on above\nL+. So continuity of a sort is restored: now we\nhave not just the possibility of the whole charge being sent back or\nnothing, we have the continuum degrees of charge in between. \n\nIt is not hard to see that the restoration of continuity restores\nthe existence of a consistent solution. If no charge is sent back\nthrough time, then the bar is not deflected and all of it hits\nL+ (and hence is sent back through time). If all\nthe charge is sent back through time, then is incoming bar is deflected\nto an extent that it misses L+ completely, and so\nno charge is sent back. But if just the right amount of charge is sent\nback through time, then the bar will be only partially deflected,\ndeflected so that it hits the edge point P, and is split into\na bit that goes back and a bit that does not, with the bit that goes\nback being just the right amount of charge to produce just that\ndeflection (figure 11). \n\nFigure 11: Solution to Elga's Paradox with a Charged Bar \n\nOur problem about conservation of momentum is also solved: piece of\nthe bar that does not time travel has lower momentum to the right at\nthe end than it had initially, but the piece that does time travel has\na higher momentum (due to the Coulomb forces), and everything balances\nout. \n\nIs it cheating to model the charged particle as a bar that can\nfracture? What if we insist that the particle is truly a point\nparticle, and hence that its time travel is an all-or-nothing\naffair? \n\nIn that case, we now have to worry about a question we have not yet\nconfronted: what happens if our point particle hits exactly at the\npoint P on the diagram? Does it time-travel or not?\nConfronting this question requires us to face up to a feature of the\nrather cheap way we implemented time travel in our toy models by\ncut-and-paste. The way we rejiggered the space-time structure had a\nrather severe consequence: the resulting space-time is no longer a\nmanifold: the topological structure at the point P is\ndifferent from the topological structure elsewhere. Mathematical\nphysicists simply don't deal with such structures: the usual procedure\nis to eliminate the offending point from the space-time and thus\nrestore the manifold structure. In this case, that would leave a\nbare singularity at point P, an open edge to\nspace-time into which anything could disappear and out of which, for\nall the physics tells us, anything could emerge. \n\nIn particular, if we insist that our particle is a point particle,\nthen if its trajectory should happen to intersect P it will\nsimply disappear. What could cause the extremely fortuitous result that\nthe trajectory strikes precisely at P? The emergence of some\nother charged particle, with just the right charge and trajectory,\nfrom P (on L-). And we are no\nlonger bound by any conservation laws: the bare singularity can both\nswallow and produce whatever mass or change or momentum we like. So if\nwe insist on point particles, then we have to take account of the\nsingularity, and that again saves the day. \n\nConsideration of these (slightly more complicated) toy models does\nnot replace the proving of theorems, of course. But they do serve to\nillustrate the sorts of consideration that necessarily come into play\nwhen trying to spell out the physics of time travel in all detail. Let\nus now discuss some results regarding some slightly more realistic\nmodels that have been discussed in the physics literature. \n\nEcheverria, Klinkhammer and Thorne (1991) considered the case of\n3-dimensional single hard spherical ball that can go through a single\ntime travel wormhole so as to collide with its younger self. \n\nThe threat of paradox in this case arises in the following form.\nThere are initial trajectories (starting in the non-time travel region\nof space-time) for the ball such that if such a trajectory is continued\n(into the time travel region), assuming that the ball does not undergo\na collision prior to entering mouth 1 of the wormhole, it will exit\nmouth 2 so as to collide with its earlier self prior to its entry into\nmouth 1 in such a way as to prevent its earlier self from entering\nmouth 1. Thus it seems that the ball will enter mouth 1 if and only if\nit does not enter mouth 1. Of course, the Wheeler-Feynman strategy is\nto look for a ‘glancing blow’ solution: a collision which\nwill produce exactly the (small) deviation in trajectory of the earlier\nball that produces exactly that collision. Are there always such\n solutions?[3] \n\nEcheverria, Klinkhammer & Thorne found a large class of initial\ntrajectories that have consistent ‘glancing blow’\ncontinuations, and found none that do not (but their search was not\ncompletely general). They did not produce a rigorous proof that every\ninitial trajectory has a consistent continuation, but suggested that it\nis very plausible that every initial trajectory has a consistent\ncontinuation. That is to say, they have made it very plausible that, in\nthe billiard ball wormhole case, the time travel structure of such a\nwormhole space-time does not result in constraints on states on\nspacelike surfaces in the non-time travel region. \n\nIn fact, as one might expect from our discussion in the previous\nsection, they found the opposite problem from that of inconsistency:\nthey found underdetermination. For a large class of initial\ntrajectories there are multiple different consistent ‘glancing\nblow’ continuations of that trajectory (many of which involve\nmultiple wormhole traversals). For example, if one initially has a ball\nthat is traveling on a trajectory aimed straight between the two\nmouths, then one obvious solution is that the ball passes between the\ntwo mouths and never time travels. But another solution is that the\nyounger ball gets knocked into mouth 1 exactly so as to come out of\nmouth 2 and produce that collision. Echeverria et al. do not note the\npossibility (which we pointed out in the previous section) of the\nexistence of additional balls in the time travel region. We conjecture\n(but have no proof) that for every initial trajectory of A\nthere are some, and generically many, multiple ball continuations. \n\nFriedman et al. 1990 examined the case of source free\nnon-self-interacting scalar fields traveling through such a time\ntravel wormhole and found that no constraints on initial conditions in\nthe non-time travel region are imposed by the existence of such time\ntravel wormholes. In general there appear to be no known counter\nexamples to the claim that in ‘somewhat realistic’\ntime-travel space-times with a partial Cauchy surface there are no\nconstraints imposed on the state on such a partial Cauchy surface by\nthe existence of CTC's. (See e.g., Friedman and Morris 1991, Thorne\n1994, and Earman 1995; in the Other Internet Resources, see Earman,\nSmeenk, and Wüthrich 2003.) \n\nHow about the issue of constraints in the time travel region\nT? Prima facie, constraints in such a region would\nnot appear to be surprising. But one might still expect that there\nshould be no constraints on states on a spacelike surface, provided\none keeps the surface ‘small enough’. In the physics\nliterature the following question has been asked: for any point\np in T, and any space-like surface S that\nincludes p is there a neighborhood E of p\nin S such that any solution on E can be extended to\na solution on the whole space-time? With respect to this question,\nthere are some simple models in which one has this kind of\nextendibility of local solutions to global ones, and some simple\nmodels in which one does not have such extendibility, with no clear\ngeneral pattern. The technical mathematical problems are amplified by the more conceptual problem of what it might mean to say that one could create a situation which forces the creation of closed timelike curves. (See e.g. Yurtsever 1990, Friedman et al. 1990,\nNovikov 1992, Earman 1995 and Earman, Smeenk and Wüthrich 2009; in the Other Internet Resources, see\nEarman, Smeenk and Wüthrich 2003). What are we to think of all of\nthis? \n\nSince it is not obvious that one can rid oneself of all constraints\nin realistic models, let us examine the argument that time travel is\nimplausible, and we should think it unlikely to exist in our world, in\nso far as it implies such constraints. The argument goes something like\nthe following. In order to satisfy such constraints one needs some\npre-established divine harmony between the global (time travel)\nstructure of space-time and the distribution of particles and fields on\nspace-like surfaces in it. But it is not plausible that the actual\nworld, or any world even remotely like ours, is constructed with divine\nharmony as part of the plan. In fact, one might argue, we have\nempirical evidence that conditions in any spatial region can vary quite\narbitrarily. So we have evidence that such constraints, whatever they\nare, do not in fact exist in our world. So we have evidence that there\nare no closed time-like lines in our world or one remotely like it. We\nwill now examine this argument in more detail by presenting four\npossible responses, with counterresponses, to this argument. \n\nResponse 1. There is nothing implausible or new about such\nconstraints. For instance, if the universe is spatially closed, there\nhas to be enough matter to produce the needed curvature, and this puts\nconstraints on the matter distribution on a space-like hypersurface.\nThus global space-time structure can quite unproblematically constrain\nmatter distributions on space-like hypersurfaces in it. Moreover we\nhave no realistic idea what these constraints look like, so we hardly\ncan be said to have evidence that they do not obtain. \n\nCounterresponse 1. Of course there are constraining relations\nbetween the global structure of space-time and the matter in it. The\nEinstein equations relate curvature of the manifold to the matter\ndistribution in it. But what is so strange and implausible about the\nconstraints imposed by the existence of closed time-like curves is that\nthese constraints in essence have nothing to do with the Einstein\nequations. When investigating such constraints one typically treats the\nparticles and/or field in question as test particles and/or fields in a\ngiven space-time, i.e., they are assumed not to affect the metric of\nspace-time in any way. In typical space-times without closed time-like\ncurves this means that one has, in essence, complete freedom of matter\ndistribution on a space-like hypersurface. (See response 2 for some\nmore discussion of this issue). The constraints imposed by the\npossibility of time travel have a quite different origin and are\nimplausible. In the ordinary case there is a causal interaction between\nmatter and space-time that results in relations between global\nstructure of space-time and the matter distribution in it. In the time\ntravel case there is no such causal story to be told: there simply has\nto be some pre-established harmony between the global space-time\nstructure and the matter distribution on some space-like surfaces. This\nis implausible. \n\nResponse 2. Constraints upon matter distributions are nothing new.\nFor instance, Maxwell's equations constrain electric fields\nE on an initial surface to be related to the\n(simultaneous) charge density distribution ρ by the equation ρ\n= div(E). (If we assume that the E\nfield is generated solely by the charge distribution, this conditions\namounts to requiring that the E field at any point in space\nsimply be the one generated by the charge distribution according to\nCoulomb's inverse square law of electrostatics.) This is not\nimplausible divine harmony. Such constraints can hold as a matter of\nphysical law. Moreover, if we had inferred from the apparent free\nvariation of conditions on spatial regions that there could be no such\nconstraints we would have mistakenly inferred that ρ =\ndiv(E) could not be a law of nature. \n\nCounterresponse 2. The constraints imposed by the existence of\nclosed time-like lines are of quite a different character from the\nconstraint imposed by ρ = div(E). The\nconstraints imposed by ρ = div(E) on the\nstate on a space-like hypersurface are: (i) local constraints (i.e., to\ncheck whether the constraint holds in a region you just need to see\nwhether it holds at each point in the region), (ii) quite independent\nof the global space-time structure, (iii) quite independent of how the\nspace-like surface in question is embedded in a given space-time, and\n(iv) very simply and generally stateable. On the other hand, the\nconsistency constraints imposed by the existence of closed time-like\ncurves (i) are not local, (ii) are dependent on the global structure of\nspace-time, (iii) depend on the location of the space-like surface in\nquestion in a given space-time, and (iv) appear not to be simply\nstateable other than as the demand that the state on that space-like\nsurface embedded in such and such a way in a given space-time, do not\nlead to inconsistency. On some views of laws (e.g., David Lewis' view)\nthis plausibly implies that such constraints, even if they hold, could\nnot possibly be laws. But even if one does not accept such a view of\nlaws, one could claim that the bizarre features of such constraints\nimply that it is implausible that such constraints hold in our world or\nin any world remotely like ours. \n\nResponse 3. It would be strange if there are constraints in the\nnon-time travel region. It is not strange if there are constraints in\nthe time travel region. They should be explained in terms of the\nstrange, self-interactive, character of time travel regions. In this\nregion there are time-like trajectories from points to themselves. Thus\nthe state at such a point, in such a region, will, in a sense, interact\nwith itself. It is a well-known fact that systems that interact with\nthemselves will develop into an equilibrium state, if there is such an\nequilibrium state, or else will develop towards some singularity.\nNormally, of course, self-interaction isn't true instantaneous\nself-interaction, but consists of a feed-back mechanism that takes\ntime. But in time travel regions something like true instantaneous\nself-interaction occurs. This explains why constraints on states occur\nin such time travel regions: the states ‘ab initio’ have to\nbe ‘equilibrium states’. Indeed in a way this also provides\nsome picture of why indeterminism occurs in time travel regions: at the\nonset of self-interaction states can fork into different equi-possible\nequilibrium states. \n\nCounterresponse 3. This is explanation by woolly analogy. It all\ngoes to show that time travel leads to such bizarre consequences that\nit is unlikely that it occurs in a world remotely like ours. \n\nResponse 4. All of the previous discussion completely misses the\npoint. So far we have been taking the space-time structure as given,\nand asked the question whether a given time travel space-time structure\nimposes constraints on states on (parts of) space-like surfaces.\nHowever, space-time and matter interact. Suppose that one is in a\nspace-time with closed time-like lines, such that certain\ncounterfactual distributions of matter on some neighborhood of a point\np are ruled out if one holds that space-time structure fixed.\nOne might then ask “Why does the actual state near p in\nfact satisfy these constraints? By what divine luck or plan is this\nlocal state compatible with the global space-time structure? What if\nconditions near p had been slightly different?” And one might\ntake it that the lack of normal answers to these questions indicates\nthat it is very implausible that our world, or any remotely like it, is\nsuch a time travel universe. However the proper response to these\nquestion is the following. There are no constraints in any significant\nsense. If they hold they hold as a matter of accidental fact, not of\nlaw. There is no more explanation of them possible than there is of any\ncontingent fact. Had conditions in a neighborhood of p been\notherwise, the global structure of space-time would have been\ndifferent. So what? The only question relevant to the issue of\nconstraints is whether an arbitrary state on an arbitrary spatial\nsurface S can always be embedded into a space-time such that\nthat state on S consistently extends to a solution on the\nentire space-time. \n\nBut we know the answer to that question. A well-known theorem in\ngeneral relativity says the following: any initial data set on a three\ndimensional manifold S with positive definite metric has a\nunique embedding into a maximal space-time in which S is a\nCauchy surface (see e.g., Geroch and Horowitz 1979, p. 284 for more\ndetail), i.e., there is a unique largest space-time which has\nS as a Cauchy surface and contains a consistent evolution of\nthe initial value data on S. Now since S is a Cauchy\nsurface this space-time does not have closed time like curves. But it\nmay have extensions (in which S is not a Cauchy surface)\nwhich include closed timelike curves, indeed it may be that any\nmaximal extension of it would include closed timelike curves. (This\nappears to be the case for extensions of states on certain surfaces of\nTaub-NUT space-times. See Earman, Smeenk, and Wüthrich 2003 in\nthe Other Internet Resources). But these extensions, of course, will\nbe consistent. So properly speaking, there are no constraints on\nstates on space-like surfaces. Nonetheless the space-time in which\nthese are embedded may or may not include closed time-like curves. \n\nCounterresponse 4. This, in essence, is the stonewalling answer\nwhich we indicated at the beginning of section 2. However, whether or\nnot you call the constraints imposed by a given space-time on\ndistributions of matter on certain space-like surfaces ‘genuine\nconstraints’, whether or not they can be considered lawlike, and\nwhether or not they need to be explained, the existence of such\nconstraints can still be used to argue that time travel worlds are so\nbizarre that it is implausible that our world or any world remotely\nlike ours is a time travel world. \n\nSuppose that one is in a time travel world. Suppose that given the\nglobal space-time structure of this world, there are constraints\nimposed upon, say, the state of motion of a ball on some space-like\nsurface when it is treated as a test particle, i.e., when it is assumed\nthat the ball does not affect the metric properties of the space-time\nit is in. (There is lots of other matter that, via the Einstein\nequation, corresponds exactly to the curvature that there is everywhere\nin this time travel worlds.) Now a real ball of course does have some\neffect on the metric of the space-time it is in. But let us consider a\nball that is so small that its effect on the metric is negligible.\nPresumably it will still be the case that certain states of this ball\non that space-like surface are not compatible with the global time\ntravel structure of this universe. \n\nThis means that the actual distribution of matter on such a\nspace-like surface can be extended into a space-time with closed\ntime-like lines, but that certain counterfactual distributions of\nmatter on this space-like surface can not be extended into the same\nspace-time. But note that the changes made in the matter\ndistribution (when going from the actual to the counterfactual\ndistribution) do not in any non-negligible way affect the metric\nproperties of the space-time. Thus the reason why the global time\ntravel properties of the counterfactual space-time have to be\nsignificantly different from the actual space-time is not that there\nare problems with metric singularities or alterations in the metric\nthat force significant global changes when we go to the counterfactual\nmatter distribution. The reason that the counterfactual space-time has\nto be different is that in the counterfactual world the ball's initial\nstate of motion starting on the space-like surface, could not\n‘meet up’ in a consistent way with its earlier self (could\nnot be consistently extended) if we were to let the global structure of\nthe counterfactual space-time be the same as that of the actual\nspace-time. Now, it is not bizarre or implausible that there is a\ncounterfactual dependence of manifold structure, even of its topology,\non matter distributions on spacelike surfaces. For instance, certain\nmatter distributions may lead to singularities, others may not. We may\nindeed in some sense have causal power over the topology of the\nspace-time we live in. But this power normally comes via the Einstein\nequations. But it is bizarre to think that there could be a\ncounterfactual dependence of global space-time structure on the\narrangement of certain tiny bits of matter on some space-like surface,\nwhere changes in that arrangement by assumption do not affect the\nmetric anywhere in space-time in any significant way. It is\nimplausible that we live in such a world, or that a world even remotely\nlike ours is like that. \n\nLet us illustrate this argument in a different way by assuming that\nwormhole time travel imposes constraints upon the states of people\nprior to such time travel, where the people have so little mass/energy\nthat they have negligible effect, via the Einstein equation, on the\nlocal metric properties of space-time. Do you think it more plausible\nthat we live in a world where wormhole time travel occurs but it only\noccurs when people's states are such that these local states happen to\ncombine with time travel in such a way that nobody ever succeeds in\nkilling their younger self, or do you think it more plausible that we\nare not in a wormhole time travel\n world?[4] \n\nThere has been a particularly clear treatment of time travel in the\ncontext of quantum mechanics by David Deutsch (see Deutsch 1991, and\nDeutsch and Lockwood 1994) in which it is claimed that quantum\nmechanical considerations show that time travel never imposes any\nconstraints on the pre-time travel state of systems. The essence of\nthis account is as follows. \n\nA quantum system starts in state S1, interacts with its\nolder self, after the interaction is in state S2,\ntime travels while developing into state S3, then\ninteracts with its younger self, and ends in state\nS4 (see figure 13). \n\nDeutsch assumes that the set of possible states of this system are\nthe mixed states, i.e., are represented by the density matrices over\nthe Hilbert space of that system. Deutsch then shows that for any\ninitial state S1, any unitary interaction between\nthe older and younger self, and any unitary development during time\ntravel, there is a consistent solution, i.e., there is at least one\npair of states S2 and S3 such\nthat when S1 interacts with S3\nit will change to state S2 and\nS2 will then develop into S3.\nThe states S2, S3 and\nS4 will typically be not be pure states, i.e., will\nbe non-trivial mixed states, even if S1 is pure. In\norder to understand how this leads to interpretational problems let us\ngive an example. Consider a system that has a two dimensional Hilbert\nspace with as a basis the states\n \n and\n .\n Let us suppose that when state\n \n of the young system\nencounters state\n \n of the older system, they interact and the young\nsystem develops into state\n \n and the old system remains in state\n .\n In obvious\nnotation: \n\nSimilarly, suppose that: \n\n 13 develops into\n 24,\nand \n\n 13 develops into\n 24. \n\nLet us furthermore assume that there is no development of the state\nof the system during time travel, i.e., that\n 2\ndevelops into\n 3, and that\n 2\ndevelops into\n 3. \n\nNow, if the only possible states of the system were\n \n and\n \n (i.e., if there\nwere no superpositions or mixtures of these states), then there is a\nconstraint on initial states: initial state\n 1 is\nimpossible. For if\n 1 interacts with\n 3 then it\nwill develop into\n 2, which, during time travel, will develop\ninto\n 3, which inconsistent with the assumed\nstate\n 3. Similarly if\n 1\ninteracts with\n 3 it will develop into\n 2, which\nwill then develop into\n 3 which is also inconsistent. Thus the\nsystem can not start in state\n 1. \n\nBut, says Deutsch, in quantum mechanics such a system can also be in\nany mixture of the states\n \n and\n .\n Suppose that the older system, prior to the\ninteraction, is in a state S3 which is an equal\nmixture of 50%\n 3 and 50%\n 3. Then\nthe younger system during the interaction will develop into a mixture\nof 50%\n 2 and 50%\n 2, which\nwill then develop into a mixture of 50%\n 3 and\n 50%\n 3,\nwhich is consistent! More generally Deutsch uses a fixed point theorem\nto show that no matter what the unitary development during interaction\nis, and no matter what the unitary development during time travel is,\nfor any state S1 there is always a state\nS3 (which typically is not a pure state) which\ncauses S1 to develop into a state\nS2 which develops into that state\nS3. Thus quantum mechanics comes to the rescue: it\nshows in all generality that no constraints on initial states are\nneeded! \n\nOne might wonder why Deutsch appeals to mixed states: will\nsuperpositions of states\n \n and\n \n not suffice? Unfortunately such an idea does not\nwork. Suppose again that the initial state is\n 1. One\nmight suggest that that if state S3 is\n 1/√2 3\n +\n 1/√2 3 one\nwill obtain a consistent development. For one might think that when\ninitial state\n 1 encounters the superposition\n 1/√2 3\n +\n 1/√2 3, it\nwill develop into superposition\n 1/√2 2\n +\n 1/√2 2, and\nthat this in turn will develop into\n 1/√2 3\n +\n 1/√2 3, as\ndesired. However this is not correct. For initial state\n 1 when it\nencounters\n 1/√2 3 +\n 1/√2 3, will\ndevelop into the entangled state\n 1/√2 24\n +\n 1/√2 24. In so\nfar as one can speak of the state of the young system after this\ninteraction, it is in the mixture of 50%\n 2 and\n 50%\n 2,\nnot in the superposition\n 1/√2 2 +\n 1/√2 2. So\nDeutsch does need his recourse to mixed states. \n\nThis clarification of why Deutsch needs his mixtures does however\nindicate a serious worry about the simplifications that are part of\nDeutsch's account. After the interaction the old and young system will\n(typically) be in an entangled state. Although for purposes of a\nmeasurement on one of the two systems one can say that this system is\nin a mixed state, one can not represent the full state of the two\nsystems by specifying the mixed state of each separate part, as there\nare correlations between observables of the two systems that are not\nrepresented by these two mixed states, but are represented in the\njoint entangled state. But if there really is an entangled state of\nthe old and young systems directly after the interaction, how is one\nto represent the subsequent development of this entangled state? Will\nthe state of the younger system remain entangled with the state of the\nolder system as the younger system time travels and the older system\nmoves on into the future? On what space-like surfaces are we to\nimagine this total entangled state to be? At this point it becomes\nclear that there is no obvious and simple way to extend elementary\nnon-relativistic quantum mechanics to space-times with closed\ntime-like curves. There have been more sophisticated approaches than\nDeutsch's to time travel, using technical machinery from quantum field\ntheory and differentiable manifolds (see e.g., Friedman et al 1991,\nEarman, Smeenk, and Wüthrich 2003 in the Other Internet Resources,\nand references therein). But out of such approaches no results\nanywhere near as clear and interesting as Deutsch's have been\nforthcoming. \n\nHow does Deutsch avoid these complications? Deutsch assumes a mixed\nstate S3 of the older system prior to the\ninteraction with the younger system. He lets it interact with an\narbitrary pure state S1 younger system. After this\ninteraction there is an entangled state S′ of the two\nsystems. Deutsch computes the mixed state S2 of the\nyounger system which is implied by this entangled state\nS′. His demand for consistency then is just that this\nmixed state S2 develops into the mixed state\nS3. Now it is not at all clear that this is a\nlegitimate way to simplify the problem of time travel in quantum\nmechanics. But even if we grant him this simplification there is a\nproblem: how are we to understand these mixtures? \n\nIf we take an ignorance interpretation of mixtures we run into\ntrouble. For suppose that we assume that in each individual case each\nolder system is either in state\n 3 or in state\n 3 prior\nto the interaction. Then we regain our paradox. Deutsch instead\nrecommends the following, many worlds, picture of mixtures. Suppose we\nstart with state\n 1 in all worlds. In some of the many worlds\nthe older system will be in the\n 3 state, let us call them\nA-worlds, and in some worlds, B-worlds, it will be in\nthe\n 3 state. Thus in A-worlds after\ninteraction we will have state\n 2 , and in B-worlds we will have\nstate\n 2. During time travel the\n 2 state\nwill remain the same, i.e., turn into state\n 3, but\nthe systems in question will travel from A-worlds to\nB-worlds. Similarly the\n 2 states will travel from the\nB-worlds to the A-worlds, thus preserving\nconsistency. \n\nNow whatever one thinks of the merits of many worlds\ninterpretations, and of this understanding of it applied to mixtures,\nin the end one does not obtain genuine time travel in Deutsch's\naccount. The systems in question travel from one time in one world to\nanother time in another world, but no system travels to an earlier time\nin the same world. (This is so at least in the normal sense of the word\n‘world,’ the sense that one means when, for instance, one\nsays “there was, and will be, only one Elvis Presley in this\nworld.”) Thus, even if it were a reasonable view, it is not quite as\ninteresting as it may have initially seemed. \n\nWhat remains of the killing-your-earlier-self paradox in general\nrelativistic time travel worlds is the fact that in some cases the\nstates on edgeless spacelike surfaces are\n‘overconstrained’, so that one has less than the usual\nfreedom in specifying conditions on such a surface, given the\ntime-travel structure, and in some cases such states are\n‘underconstrained’, so that states on edgeless space-like\nsurfaces do not determine what happens elsewhere in the way that they\nusually do, given the time travel structure. There can also be mixtures\nof those two types of cases. The extent to which states are\noverconstrained and/or underconstrained in realistic models is as yet\nunclear, though it would be very surprising if neither obtained. The\nextant literature has primarily focused on the problem of\noverconstraint, since that, often, either is regarded as a metaphysical\nobstacle to the possibility time travel, or as an epistemological\nobstacle to the plausibility of time travel in our world. While it is\ntrue that our world would be quite different from the way we normally\nthink it is if states were overconstrained, underconstraint seems at\nleast as bizarre as overconstraint. Nonetheless, neither directly rules\nout the possibility of time travel. \n\nIf time travel entailed contradictions then the issue would be\nsettled. And indeed, most of the stories employing time travel in\npopular culture are logically incoherent: one cannot change\nthe past to be different from what it was, since the past (like the\npresent and the future) only occurs once. But if the only requirement\ndemanded is logical coherence, then it seems all too easy. A clever\nauthor can devise a coherent time-travel scenario in which everything\nhappens just once and in a consistent way. This is just too cheap:\nlogical coherence is a very weak condition, and many things we take to\nbe metaphysically impossible are logically coherent. For example, it\ninvolves no logical contradiction to suppose that water is not\nmolecular, but if both chemistry and Kripke are right it is a\nmetaphysical impossibility. We have been interested not in logical\npossibility but in physical possibility. But even so, our conditions\nhave been relatively weak: we have asked only whether time-travel is\nconsistent with the universal validity of certain fundamental physical\nlaws and with the notion that the physical state on a surface prior to\nthe time travel region be unconstrained. It is perfectly possible that\nthe physical laws obey this condition, but still that time travel is\nnot metaphysically possible because of the nature of time itself.\nConsider an analogy. Aristotle believed that water is homoiomerous and\ninfinitely divisible: any bit of water could be subdivided, in\nprinciple, into smaller bits of water. Aristotle's view contains no\nlogical contradiction. It was certainly consistent with Aristotle's\nconception of water that it be homoiomerous, so this was, for him, a\nconceptual possibility. But if chemistry is right, Aristotle was wrong\nboth about what water is like and what is possible for it. It can't be\ninfinitely divided, even though no logical or conceptual analysis would\nreveal that. \n\nSimilarly, even if all of our consistency conditions can be met, it\ndoes not follow that time travel is physically possible, only that some\nspecific physical considerations cannot rule it out. The only serious\nproof of the possibility of time travel would be a demonstration of its\nactuality. For if we agree that there is no actual time travel in our\nuniverse, the supposition that there might have been involves\npostulating a substantial difference from actuality, a difference\nunlike in kind from anything we could know if firsthand. It is unclear\nto us exactly what the content of possible would be if one were to\neither maintain or deny the possibility of time travel in these\ncircumstances, unless one merely meant that the possibility is not\nruled out by some delineated set of constraints. As the example of\nAristotle's theory of water shows, conceptual and logical\n“possibility” do not entail possibility in a full-blooded\nsense. What exactly such a full-blooded sense would be in case of time\ntravel, and whether one could have reason to believe it to obtain,\nremain to us obscure.","contact.mail":"twm3@nyu.edu","contact.domain":"nyu.edu"}]
