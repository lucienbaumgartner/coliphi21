The appeal of this view lies in the\npromise to explain how normative truths are objective and independent\nof our actual judgments, while also binding and authoritative for\nus.\n\n\nConstructivism comes in several varieties, some of which claim a place\nwithin metaethics while others claim no place within it at all. In\nfact, constructivism is sometimes defended as a normative\ntheory about the justification of moral principles. Normative\nconstructivism is the view that the moral principles we ought to\naccept are the ones that agents would agree to or endorse were they to\nengage in a hypothetical or idealized process of rational\ndeliberation.\n\n\nMetaethical constructivist theories aim to account for the nature of\nnormative truths and practical reasons. They bear a problematic\nrelation to traditional classifications of metaethical theories. In\nparticular, there are disagreements about how to situate\nconstructivism in the realism/antirealism debate. These disagreements\nare rooted in further differences about the definition of metaethics,\nthe relation between normative and metaethical claims, and the\npurported methods pertinent and specific to metaethical inquiry. The\nquestion of how to classify metaethical constructivism will be\naddressed in what follows by focusing on the distinctive questions\nthat constructivist theories have been designed to answer. Section 1\nexplains the origin and motivation of constructivism. Sections\n2–4 examine the main varieties of metaethical constructivism.\nSection 5 illustrates related constructivist views, some of which are\nnot proposed as metaethical accounts of all normative truths, but only\nof moral truths. Sections 6 and 7 review several debates about the\nproblems, promise and prospects of metaethical constructivism.\n\nThe term ‘constructivism’ entered debates in moral theory\nwith John Rawls’ seminal Dewey Lectures “Kantian\nConstructivism in Moral Theory” (Rawls 1980), wherein Rawls\noffered a reinterpretation of the philosopher Immanuel Kant’s\nethics and of its relevance for political debates. \nAccording to Rawls, these debates fail to effectively address the\npolitical problem of ethical disagreements because they adopt\nmetaphysical standards of objectivity, which appeal to the independent\nreality and truth of values. In his view, such standards are\ninadequate to address disagreement in a political debate in which all\nthe parties in the dispute claim to be defending the only true view,\nbecause they lead to a stalemate in the discussion, with each party\naccusing its opponent of being ‘blind’ to the moral\ntruth. \nRawls is especially concerned with coordination problems that arise in\npluralistic contexts, wherein citizens hold different and to some\nextent incommensurable moral views. The need for objectivity,\naccording to Rawls, is practical: it arises in contexts in\nwhich people disagree about what to value and need to reach an\nagreement about what to do. He attributes to Kant the idea that we\nought to approach objectivity as a practical problem and that we can\nfruitfully address moral disputes by reasoning about them (Rawls 1971:\n34, 39–40, 49–52). Rawls thus turns to Kant in order to\nargue for a conception of objectivity that is not metaphysical, that\nis, a conception of objectivity that avoids claims to universal and\nfundamental moral truths that are independent of our fully rational\njudgments. On this conception, nobody is assumed to have a privileged\naccess to moral truth, but all have equal standing in reasoning about\nwhat to do. To this extent, Kant’s theory is regarded as\nproviding a metaethical alternative both to realism and skepticism\nabout the existence and nature of moral truths. \nRawls’ account of Kantian constructivism in moral theory (1980)\ngenerated a large literature, and produced several varieties of\nconstructivism. Some of these views depart from Rawls’\nconception of constructivism. \nKantian constructivism is defended in a variety of ways, but its\ndistinguishing feature is that it understands the nature of moral and\nnormative truths based on considerations about the basic features of\nrational agency. On this view, reasons for being moral do not spring\nfrom our interests or desires; instead, they are rooted in our nature\nas rational agents. Insofar as moral obligations are justified in\nterms of rational requirements, they are universally and necessarily\nbinding for all rational beings. Because of its claim about the\nuniversal authority of reason and obligations, Kantian Constructivism\nis regarded as the most ambitious form of metaethical constructivism.\nIn this section, we will consider three main varieties, starting with\nthe constructivist interpretation of Kant’s ethics. \nJohn Rawls first proposed a constructivist interpretation of\nKant’s account of moral obligation and practical reason (Rawls\n1980, 2000). On Rawls’ reading, Kant’s analysis of\nobligation commits him to a kind of constructivism, which is best\nunderstood in contrast to competing views of moral obligation (Rawls\n1980, 1989, 2000). Kant holds that all previous ethical theories have\nfailed to account for moral obligation because they have failed\nas theories of practical reason (Kant G 4:\n441–444; C2 5: 35–41, 153, 157). They fail to\nexplain how reason plays a role in our lives because they\nmisunderstand its practical function and mischaracterize its relation\nwith the ends of choice. Kant’s charge is directed against all\nprevious moral doctrines, but his arguments specifically address\nsentimentalism and ‘dogmatic rationalism’. Sentimentalism,\nchampioned by Francis Hutcheson, David Hume, and Adam Smith, holds\nthat ethical judgments stem from sentiments and regards reason as\nincapable of moving us to action on its own. According to the\nsentimentalist, the role of reason is solely instrumental. That is,\nreason merely finds the means to satisfy an agent’s ends, and it\nis not capable of indicating which ends are worth pursuing. This claim\nexposes sentimentalism as a “heteronomous” doctrine, which\nfails to establish the objectivity of moral obligations. This is\nbecause sentimentalism treats moral obligations as conditional upon\nour interests, and thus as having limited authority. \nKant raises the same objection against dogmatic rationalism,\nchampioned by Christian Wolff and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, which\nholds that there are real moral truths that we apprehend by rational\ninsight (Kant G 4: 443; Rawls 2000: 50, 228). This view\nappears to be an intuitionist form of moral realism according to which\nreason recognizes objective values or moral ends that exist prior to\nand independently of our reasoning and of the kinds of agents that we\nare. In discovering such ends, moral agents do not actively exercise\nreasoning; they are as passive as in sensory perception. For Kant,\ndogmatic rationalism fails to secure the conclusion that moral\nobligations have unconditional authority over us (Kant G, 4:\n441). This is because, for dogmatic rationalism, moral truths guide us\nonly on the condition that we have a corresponding desire to be guided\nby what is rational (Rawls 1980: 343–46; Rawls 1989:\n510–13). \nKant’s diagnosis is that all such doctrines fail to capture the\npractical function of reason because they are heteronomous. They deny\nthe authority and efficacy of reason, either holding that reason can\nonly recognize objective ends that exist independently of its\noperations, or claiming that reason can bind agents only with the help\nof inclination or interest. For Kant heteronomy is a form of moral\nskepticism, understood as skepticism about the power of reason to\nestablish moral truths and their authority. On this reading, then,\nconstructivism is part of Kant’s overall argument for grounding\nethics in reason, against the skeptical view that there are no\nnormative truths (Korsgaard 1996a; Stern 2013; Wallace 2012).\nSkepticism is avoided only if reason is accounted as autonomous, and\nits authority does not derive from anything outside it. Reason is\nautonomous if its authority rests on its proper activity, rather than\nbeing derived from elements of the world outside of reason. Thus, the\nnorm governing the activity of reason must be internal to reason,\nrather than dependent on any given value, interest, or desire. That is\nto say that reason is a “self-legislative activity” (Kant\nG 4: §2), and its legislative activity is governed by a\nnorm, which Kant calls the ‘Categorical Imperative.’ The\nCategorical Imperative expresses the autonomy of reason and is its\ngoverning principle. It is not a mere decision-procedure to determine\nwhat to do, but the ‘constitutive norm’ of reason, that\nis, the basic standard of rationality in thinking and acting (Rawls\n1989: 498–506; Rawls 2000: 166, 240–244; Korsgaard 1996a:\n36–37; O’Neill 1989b: 18–19, 59n, 128, 180; Bagnoli\n2013b; Reath 2006: 221–222; Reath & Timmermann 2010;\nEngstrom 2009: Chapter 5). \nKant gives several formulations of the Categorical Imperative, which\nhe regards as equivalent (G 4: 421, 429, 431, 433); but\nultimately, it is the requirement that in deliberating, we test our\nmotives by considering whether the principle they express can be\nendorsed as a universal law, a principle that applies to and binds all\nagents endowed with rational capacities. Kant is committed to the\n“constitutivist view” that the source of the categorical\nforce of moral obligations lies in the constitutive features of\nrational agency (Rawls 2000: 263–265; O’Neill 1989a,\nKorsgaard 1996a: 236ff). We will return to this point in\n section 7. \nScholars are divided about the significance of the arguments in\nsupport of a constructivist interpretation of Kant’s theory of\npractical reason, even though nobody denies that, for Kant, the laws\nof the mind are laws of reason (compare Guyer 2013 and Engstrom 2013;\nBagnoli 2013b). The most general source of reservations about the\nconstructivist interpretation is that constructivism builds upon the\ncritique of realism, but Kant’s claims about objective moral\nknowledge seem best vindicated by moral realism. In this dispute,\nconstructivism is generally taken to be a form of antirealism (Ameriks\n2003: 268, 274; Wood 2008: 108, 337, 374–375). It should be\nnoted, however, that Rawls introduced Kant’s constructivism as a\nnovel alternative to both realism and antirealism, where the latter\nincludes subjectivism and relativism (Rawls 1980; O’Neill 1989a:\n1; Engstrom 2013: 138ff). \nAccording to some interpreters, Kant’s defense of the autonomy\nof reason takes place within a project of identifying the foundation\nof morality, which is realist in spirit because it appeals to the\nabsolute value of humanity (Wood 1999: 157, 114; Rauscher 2002;\nLangton 2007; Johnson 2007; Hills 2008; Krasnoff 1999; Kain 2006a,b;\nIrwin 2009; Galvin 2011). There are different ways to argue for this\npoint. First, critics point out that Kant’s defense provides a\ntranscendental argument, an argument that highlights the conditions\nunder which it is possible for something to be the case. The value of\nhumanity is the condition of the possibility of all valuing. To such\ncritics, the appeal to a transcendental argument for the value of\nhumanity already counts as a markedly realist move (Larmore 2008: 121;\nWatkins & Fitzpatrick 2002; Fitzpatrick 2005; Tiffany 2006). The\nissue revolves around the nature of transcendental arguments, and\nwhether they commit us to moral realism, something that\nconstructivists deny. \nSecond, critics hold that the constructivist interpretation of Kant\nheavily rests its case on a text that contains seemingly realist\narguments. In the Critique of Practical Reason, Kant refers\nto our consciousness of the moral law as “the fact of\nreason” (Kant C2 5: 46–48). We know the moral law\nas a “fact”, and we feel its pull in the guise of\nreverence for the law. This immediate consciousness of the moral law\nalso shows that we have an interest in morality, which arises\nindependently of self-interested motives (Kant C2 5:\n42–43). Realist interpreters take the argument from the fact of\nreason to show that Kant’s claim about the objectivity of moral\nobligations ultimately relies on perception of some moral facts (the\nfact of reason), hence on a realist foundation (Ameriks 2003:\n263–282; Kleingeld 2010: 55–72). By contrast,\nconstructivist interpreters tend to downplay the role of the fact of\nreason in Kant’s general argument for the objectivity of moral\nobligations (O’Neill 2002: 81–97; Łuków 1993:\n204–221). Rawls takes the fact of reason to show that Kant\ndevelops “not only a constructivist conception of practical\nreason, but a coherentist account of its authentication” (Rawls\n1999: 524; Rawls 2000: 268–273). In his view, the fact of reason\nindicates that the deliverances of practical reason cohere with our\nmoral experience. This congruence is an integral part of Kant’s\nvindication of ethical objectivity, but it is no commitment to\nrealism. Rather, it simply confirms that there is no discrepancy\nbetween the requirements of practical reason (which are expressed by\nthe Categorical Imperative) and our ordinary experience of morality\n(Rawls 1980: 340; Rawls 1989: 523–524; Rawls 2000:\n253–272, 268, 273; Kant C2, 5: 15). Rawls thinks that\nthe realist notion of objectivity is “unnecessary for\nobjectivity” (1980: 570). But Rawls’ argument in support\nof a coherentist conception of practical reason may seem too weak to\ncapture Kant’s view of moral obligations as objective rational\nrequirements (Larmore 2008: 83–84; Stern 2012a: 7–40). For\nthis reason, some interpreters argue that Kant is constructivist about\nthe authority of moral obligations and practical laws for finite\nagents, but not about the contents of such laws, which apply to all\nrational agents as such (Engstrom 2009, 2013; Bagnoli 2009; Sensen\n2013). \nUnderstanding this scholarly debate is important for assessing the\nprospects of constructivism, especially as a metaethical view distinct\nfrom realism (Bagnoli forthcoming: §1). First, critics dispute\nthe force and the target of the objection of heteronomy. Some doubt\nthat ‘moral realism’ is Kant’s own intended target,\nhence suggesting that Kant’s constructivism does not build upon\na critique of moral realism (Stern 2012a: 7– 68, 2012b).\nRelatedly, they deny that claims about the autonomy of reason or its\npractical function commit one to constructivism. \nThe constructivist interpretation is meant to capture Kant’s\ndistinctive insights about practical reason and the\nself-authenticating nature of reason as a self-legislative activity.\nThe distinctive character of this conception resides in the idea that\nreason itself should be scrutinized by reason in order for its\nverdicts to be justified. Constructivists hold that practical reason\nitself is constructed in the sense that its legitimacy and authority\nare established by reasoning, rather than by appeal to some facts\nabout the way the world is (O’Neill 1989b; Rawls 2000: 238;\nO’Neill 2015; Bagnoli 2013b). \nContemporary constructivists have largely emphasized the\nantimetaphysical implications of Kant’s views. Kant embarks on\nthe project of vindicating reasoning, starting from very modest\nconsiderations about rational agency. Such starting points are not\nsufficient “to sustain or revive classical philosophical\nambitions to build vast metaphysical structures on reason alone”\n(O’Neill 2015: 3; C1: A xiii). The constructivist interpretation\nof Kant’s ethics emphasizes the cooperative nature of the\nstandards of reasoning:  \nKant’s repeated use of metaphors of construction and\ncollaboration in his discussion of reasoning make it natural\nto speak of his approach and method as constructivist, and of\nhis aim as the construction of reason’s authority, and\nthereby of a basis for offering others reasons for truth claims and\nmoral claims, reasons for favouring some rather than other practical\nand political aims. (O’Neill 2015: 4)  \nBasically, the standards of reasoning are justified by their function:\nthey must ensure that reasoning is followable by others, “it\nmust exhibit patterns that others could discern, and thus it must be\nlaw-like” (O’Neill 2015: 4). \nThe anti-metaphysical orientation of constructivism is apparent in\nearly defenses of metaethical constructivism. For instance, Christine\nKorsgaard characterizes Kantian constructivism as a form of\n“procedural realism” – the view that “there\nare answers to moral questions because there are correct\nprocedures for arriving at them”; and she contrasts procedural\nrealism with “substantive realism” – the view that\n \nthere are correct procedures for answering moral questions\nbecause there are moral truths or facts, which exist\nindependently of those procedures, and which those procedures track.\n(Korsgaard 1996a: 36–37, see also Korsgaard 1983: 183)  \nSubstantive realism holds that there are objective criteria of\ncorrectness for moral judgments only if such judgments represent\nmatters of fact about the way the world is. By contrast, the\nconstructivist view is that there are objective criteria of moral\njudgment insofar as there are objective criteria about how to reason\nabout practical matters. There are objective reasons that prohibit\ndeceiving and manipulating others, but such reasons are the result of\npractical reasoning, rather than discovered by empirical\ninvestigation, grasped by the intellect, or revealed by some god. What\nmakes this view “Kantian” is that there is ultimately one\ncriterion for reasoning on practical matters, which is the Categorical\nImperative. By reasoning according to this criterion, we objectively\nground moral obligations, which are requirements of practical reason.\n \nKorsgaard’s case for constructivism parallels Kant’s\nargument for the autonomy of practical reason, as Rawls reconstructs\nit. It starts by objecting that substantive realism fails to respond\nto the skeptical challenge that there really are no reasons to be\nmoral. This is because realism simply assumes the existence of\nobjective standards for morality without offering a rational basis for\nthem; hence the realist affirms what the skeptic denies. As a\nconsequence, the realist also fails to show why we really ought to do\nas morality says, and thus fails as an account of the authority of\nmoral obligations (Korsgaard 1996a; Korsgaard 2008: 30–31,\n55–57, 67–68; Stern 2012a; Brady 2002). Realists presume\nthat, in order to fend off skepticism, one has to anchor practical\nreasons in facts that are in themselves normative. But no appeal to\nsuch ‘normative facts’ can explain how they count as\nreasons and motivate rational agents. Suppose we agree that it is a\nnormative fact that deception is morally wrong. How does awareness of\nthis fact rationally compel us to refrain from deceiving? This is not\nonly a psychological question about the impact that such a fact might\nhave on our minds, but also, and most importantly, a normative\nquestion that concerns its authority. \nAccording to Korsgaard, humans are self-reflective agents, capable of\nreflecting on themselves and considering their thoughts and desires\nfrom a detached perspective. Reflection makes room for raising\nquestions about what there is reason to do or to believe (1996a:\n10–11, 17, 93). That is, in reflection, rational agents call\ninto question the legitimacy of particular thoughts and desires and\nsuspend their pull. Because they are reflective, rational agents have\nideals about the sort of persons they want to be, and they can guide\ntheir minds and actions accordingly. They are capable of\nself-governance because they are capable of governing themselves by\nendorsing universal standards. The appropriate form of self-governance\nis thus self-legislation (Korsgaard 1996a: 36, 91, 231–232;\nKorsgaard 2008: 3). \nRational agents are guided by universal principles that they have\nlegislated. However, this is not to say that particular agents\narbitrarily determine the moral law; otherwise, evil people would not\nbe bound by the moral law (Korsgaard 1996a: 234–235;\nO’Neill 2003c; Reath 2006: 112–113, 92–170;\nKorsgaard 2008: 207–229). On the contrary, the claim is that\nrational agents are guided by universal principles (Korsgaard 1996a:\n36, 234–236; Korsgaard 2008: 207–229; Reath 2006:\n112–113, 92–170). But the moral law obliges us only\ninsofar as it is self-legislated. That is, one can autonomously act on\nthe moral requirements only if one legislates them. Furthermore,\nuniversal principles guarantee that action is expressive of an\nagent’s integrity, rather than driven by unreflective\npreferences or desires. This is because universal principles are the\nconstitutive principles of rational actions, on the Kantian view.\nCorrespondingly, an agent that acts mindlessly or compulsively lacks\nthe sort of integrity that is characteristic of rational agents. That\nsaid, it is possible for rational agents to act in the pursuit of\ndesires, when they have survived due reflection.  \nA canonical objection to the attempt to ground morality on rationality\nalone is that it fails to account for the special bonds and ties we\nhave with our loved ones and thus fails to capture the nature of\nintegrity and morality (Williams 1981: chapters 1–2). To address\nthese worries, Korsgaard introduces the notion of “practical\nidentities”, which specify roles as sources of special\nobligations (Korsgaard 1996a: 101, §3.3.1; Korsgaard 2009: 20).\nFor instance, Guy values himself and finds his life worth living and\nhis actions worth undertaking under the description of being a teacher\nof music, an American citizen, and Robert’s best friend. These\npractical identities govern Guy’s choices, sustain his\nintegrity, and are sources of specific obligations to his pupils,\nfellows, and friends. However, we do not have obligations just because\nwe occupy certain roles as teachers, citizens, or friends. Rather,\nsuch roles become practical identities, and sources of reasons,\ninsofar as we reflectively endorse them (Korsgaard 1996a: §3.3.1;\nKorsgaard 2009: 22). Reflective endorsement, in turn, requires that we\ntest our loyalties and allegiances according to the principle of\nuniversality, which commits us to morality. In order to value\nourselves under these specific descriptions, we must value humanity in\nourselves and in others (Korsgaard 2008: Lecture 6, 25–26). \nKorsgaard (1996a) offers a transcendental argument for the conclusion\nthat what we ought to do is justified by the norms that govern and\nconstitute our rational agency. She argues that valuing humanity,\nwhere humanity is understood as the capacity for rationality, is the\ncondition of the possibility of valuing anything at all (Korsgaard\n1996a: 121–123; Korsgaard 1998: 60–62). In deliberating,\nwe attribute to ourselves the power to confer value on our ends\nby rationally choosing them. According to Korsgaard, in\nvaluing we are also, at the same time, attributing a fundamental kind\nof value to ourselves. The conclusion is that the value of any objects\nthus ultimately depends on the rational capacity of evaluators.\n‘Humanity’ is the name of a distinctive value, which is\nunconditional and counts as the condition of the possibility of\nvaluing anything at all. Since humanity is embodied in all rational\nbeings, we should value humanity in ourselves as well as in others, on\npain of incoherence. Special obligations and bonds that derive from\nour practical identities are insufficient to sustain our integrity\nwhen they are inconsistent with valuing humanity. For instance, the\nconduct of a Mafioso cannot be coherently justified on the basis of a\nuniversal principle. The Mafioso thus fails as a rational agent and\nleads a life that is not autonomous, because his life is not the\nproduct of reflective self-government. A systematic failure to be\nguided by universal principles of self-government amounts to a loss of\nagency. Insofar as agency is inescapable, we are necessarily bound by\nthe norms of rationality and morality. Korsgaard argues that some kind\nof integrity is necessary to be an agent and cannot be achieved\nwithout a commitment to morality, which is founded on reason. \nSome critics argue that Korsgaard’s argument rests on realist\npremises, and thus it is not a complete alternative to moral realism\n(Watkins & Fitzpatrick 2002; Fitzpatrick 2005; Ridge 2005; Stieb\n2006; Kain 2006a,b; Papish 2011; O’Shea 2015; Schafer 2015a. To\nthis extent, her defense of Kantian constructivism does not offer a\ndistinctive reply to skeptical challenges to ethical objectivity.\nAccording to others, Korsgaard’s argument is vulnerable to the\nobjection of ‘regress on conditions’, which says that it\nis not logically necessary that the condition of a thing’s value\nbe valuable itself (Rabinowicz & Rønnow-Rasmussen 2000;\nKerstein 2001; Ridge 2005; Coleman 2006). That is to say that humanity\nmay be the condition of the possibility of value and yet lack value\nitself. \nHowever, according to Korsgaard “there need be no such regress\nif there are principles that are constitutive of the very\nrational activities that we trying to perform” (2008: 5, 1996b:\n164–67, 2009) In this formulation, the principles of practical\nrationality are constitutive of rational agency, in the sense that\nthey are standards arising from and justified by the nature of the\nobject in question (i.e., the rational agent). More specifically,\nunless the object conforms to the standard, it ceases to be the kind\nof object that it is. This is called the ‘constitution\nrequirement.’ If the function of the house is to serve as a\nhabitable shelter, then it must conform to the standard of being a\nhabitable shelter. A thing that does not serve this purpose is not a\nhouse. Secondly, some objects make themselves into the kind\nof objects that they are by conforming to their constitutive\nstandards. This is called the ‘self-constitution\nrequirement.’ Rational agents make things happen, that is, they\nare efficacious. They exert their efficacy in a specific way, i.e.,\nautonomously. Autonomous agents must conform to the categorical\nimperative, and in order to be efficacious, they must conform to the\nhypothetical imperative. It is by conforming to these principles,\nKorsgaard argues, that one makes oneself into an agent. \nKorsgaard’s constitutivist strategy of grounding normativity in\nthe constitutive features of agency raises worries that will be\ndiscussed in\n section 7.\n Her more recent works point toward a new direction in the debate\nabout constructivism, which combines Aristotelian and Kantian features\n(Korsgaard 2009). Korsgaard argues that an Aristotelian account of the\nvirtues as excellences of character should play an important role in a\ncomplete account of what makes a good moral agent. However, she\nremains convinced that the Kantian idea of self-constitution is\nindispensable for giving an account of agency, and therefore of moral\nagency, itself. \nOnora O’Neill defines metaethical constructivism as a third\nalternative between realism and subjectivism (O’Neill 1989b:\n279). She departs from the versions of Kantian constructivism\ndiscussed above because she makes no appeal to transcendental\narguments and rejects the idealized conceptions of rational agency\nthat are at play in other versions of Kantian constructivism. In her\nview, “finite rational beings” should not be construed as\n“beings whose rationality is finite”, but as “finite\nbeings who are rational”. Finitude does not entail any\nlimitation on strategic reasoning, even though there is no way to\nestablish that finite rational agents have access to all sorts of\nreasoning that infinite or disembodied rational agents may have. The\nkey thesis is that instrumental principles are not the only principles\nof rationality, and more importantly, they never operate in isolation\n(O’Neill 1989b: 74). \nAccording to O’Neill, this more austere constructivism is closer\nto Kant’s own theory than other varieties (O’Neill 1989a;\nO’Neill 2015). In her view, Kant’s constructivism is\nmotivated by the vivid awareness of interdependency, finitude, and\nmutual vulnerability. Humans are prone to mistakenly rely on claims\nthat are not warranted, and thus they need to check and criticize the\nunjustified and arbitrary assumptions they make in reasoning\n(O’Neill 1989b). O’Neill shares Kant’s claim that\n \nreasoning is fundamentally practical: it aims to provide\nstandards or norms that thought, action and\ncommunication can (but often fail) to meet. (O’Neill 2015: 2)\n \nSecond, she shares Kant’s claim that reasoning is necessary\nbecause humans are finite and interdependent beings. Third, she agrees\nwith Kant that the principles of reason are not revealed to us by\nintuition or introspection: We must use our rational powers to figure\nout what these principles are. Finally, she adopts Kant’s claim\nthat to fulfill its distinctive function, norms of reasoning must be\nuniversal. The differences between Kant’s and\nO’Neill’s views concern the justification of the claim\nabout universality. According to O’Neill, universality is a\nrequirement of reasoning because reasoning is to be used by a\nplurality of finite, inter-dependent agents whose action and\ncommunication are not antecedently coordinated (e.g., by instinct,\ndivine providence, or law). \nThe requirement of universality or followability sets minimal\nconstraints on processes that count as reasoning (O’Neill 2015:\n3). By following this reasoning, we find out that no plurality of\nagents can choose to live by principles that aim to destroy or\nundermine the agency (of whatever determinate shape) of some of its\nmembers (O’Neill 1989a: 10; see also O’Neill 1989b, 2015).\nAs a result, practical reasoning justifies the prohibition to harm,\ncoerce, and deceive others. This is not to say that by appealing to\nthe requirement of followability we can solve all problems and fully\ndetermine the content of all duties. On the contrary, O’Neill\nthinks that there are large varieties of moral issues for which we\nneed to offer more substantive arguments. However, her account\npromises to vindicate reason’s ability (and right) to\ndistinguish sound justifications from mere rationalizations. \nO’Neill agrees with Kant that only reason itself can verify the\ncredentials of its own claims. The process of figuring out what the\nprinciples of reason are is avowedly circular. This\ncircularity is not worrisome because the process of verification is\nreflexive, as it involves reason critiquing the claims of reason\nitself. More specifically, the critique of reason uncovers a basic\nprinciple of reasoning: we should rely only on those principles that\nother rational agents can share. The authority of reason is thus\nconferred by public communication among free, rational agents, and\nconsists in the fact that the principles that govern our thoughts are\nneither self-serving nor self-defeating. We find out what these\nprinciples say by submitting our claims to free and critical debates,\nwhich constitute “the public use of reason” (O’Neill\n1989b: 70–71, 206). \nSince the critique of reason is a continuous, progressive, and\nreflexive process, reason exhibits a history, which coincides with the\ndevelopment of practices of tolerance and mutual recognition\n(O’Neill 1999: 174, 2002). Such practices establish the\nauthority of reason. This ‘developmental’ view of\npractical reason and of its autonomy accounts for change and progress.\nArguably, this is a significant explanatory advantage over competing\nviews, which do not fully appreciate the historical and dialectical\ndimension of truth and reason (O’Neill 1989b: 70–71;\nArruda 2016). As we shall see in\n section 6,\n it requires the constructivist to provide an account of truth and\nobjective knowledge as altering in time. \nO’Neill’s defense of the virtuous circularity of\nconstructivism identifies a solution to a problem that affects\nconstructivism in general, which we shall consider in\n section 7. \nThe case for Humean constructivism rests on the alleged inadequacy of\ncompeting views: “it is what we are forced to by the\nuntenability of realism plus the failure of Kantian versions of\nmetaethical constructivism” (Street 2010: 371). Humean\nconstructivism denies that normative truths are independent of the\ndeliverances of practical reasoning (Bagnoli 2002: 131; Street 2008a,\n2010, 2012; Velleman 2009; Lenman 2010, 2012). To this extent, Humean\nconstructivism builds on the Kantian insight that normative truths are\nnot simply “out there”, as realists suppose. In contrast\nto Kantian constructivism, however, Humean constructivists abandon the\nclaim that moral obligations are requirements of practical reason. The\nconstitutive norms of practical reason may favor morality, but do not\nrequire it (Street 2012; Velleman 2009: 150–154; Lenman 2010:\n192). Thus, Humeans maintain that an ideally coherent Caligula who\nvalues torturing people for fun is conceivable. Such a person would\nhave reasons for torturing people, which is just to say that the value\nof humanity is not a constitutive norm of reasoning (Street 2010: 371;\nStreet 2009, 2012). Humean constructivism also rejects the Kantian\nclaim that there are universal rational norms that bind all rational\nagents. For instance, Street argues that “the substantive\ncontent of a given agent’s reasons is a function of his or her\nparticular, contingently given, evaluative starting points”\n(Street 2010, see also Lenman 2010: 180–181). Consequently,\n“truth and falsity in the normative domain must always be\nrelativized to a particular practical point of view” (Street\n2008a: 224). Agreement among various practical standpoints is possible\nbut it is not guaranteed by facts about the nature of reason or the\nprinciples of reason that are authoritative for all rational agents.\nHumeans hold that there is nothing alarming about the sort of\nrelativism that their position implies (Street 2008a: 245). Even\nthough moral norms are not necessary requirements of reason, there is\na sense in which they are not contingent because they play a large\nrole in our lives. Furthermore, by analogy with attitudes such as\nlove, which is both contingent and compelling, Street argues that the\nfact that moral commitments are contingent does not weaken their\nnormative force. The latter claim has been disputed on the ground that\nthe driving force of love should be distinguished from its normative\nauthority (Bratman 2012). \nHumean constructivism has established itself as a prominent variety of\nmetaethics, which avoids any commitment to moral realism. In\n section 6\n we will consider how this form of constructivism relates to\nanti-realism and expressivism. \nAristotelian constructivism is a metaethical view about the nature of\nnormative truths, according to which our true normative judgments\nrepresent a normative reality, but this reality is not independent of\nthe exercise of moral and practical judgment (LeBar 2008: 182;\n2013a,b). Like the Kantian varieties of constructivism, Aristotelian\nconstructivism appeals to constitutive features of practical reason:\n \npractical truth is constructed, not discovered, because it is activity\nin accordance with the norms of practical rationality, which are\nthemselves constitutive of agency. (LeBar 2008: 191)  \nTo this extent, this metaethical view shares the ambitions of Kantian\nconstructivism to ground normative truths in features of rational\nagency. In contrast to Kantian models, however, Aristotelians hold\nthat the principles of sound practical reason are neither formal nor\nprocedural. Rather, they are grounded in a substantive account of the\ngood life, which is inspired by ancient eudaimonism. The wise and\nvirtuous agents form the standard of practical rationality through the\nexercise of their virtues of intellect and character (Aristotle\nNicomachean Ethics, II.6. \nThe negative case for Aristotelian constructivism consists in the\ncritique of the Kantian account of practical reasoning, its form,\nreach, and powers. Under attack is the claim that practical reasoning\nis law-like, i.e., governed by the requirement of universality.\nAccording to some critics, Kantians have a difficult time explaining\nhow to apply universal rational principles to concrete cases\n(Höffe 1993; LeBar 2013b; Millgram 2005: chapter 6). In this\nrespect, the Aristotelians claim to have a significant advantage\nbecause Aristotelian constructivism allows practical reasoning to\nadapt to particular cases. Aristotelian constructivism works out a\nstory about the norms for success in judgment, which is considered a\nproblem for Kant and an unrecognized lacuna in contemporary Kantian\nethics (Millgram 2005: chapter 6). Because of its appeal to moral\nlaws, Kantian ethics is often criticized either for entailing rigorism\nor for empty formalism. In either case, Kantian ethics seems incapable\nof accounting for the relevance of circumstances for ethical\njudgments. This is a problem that Kantian constructivists address\n(O’Neill 1975; Herman 1993), but inadequately, according to the\nAristotelians (LeBar 2013b. \nTo identify the substantive standards of practical reasoning,\nAristotelian constructivism starts with a study of the complexity of\nour rational animal nature, which excludes that the principles\nconstitutive of human rationality can be merely formal. In contrast to\nKantian self-legislation, Aristotelian constructivism emphasizes the\ninterplay between rational and animal nature, focusing especially on\ntraining and shaping the affective and sensitive aspects of our\nnature. In particular, it emphasizes the transformative effects of\nreflection on passions and desires, and the possibility of developing\na ‘second nature’, thanks to complex processes such as\nhabituation and education (LeBar 2008: 197). The key feature of this\naccount is the claim that practical rationality does not merely direct\nour affective responses toward adequate objects but also structurally\ntransforms our animal sensibility into character. The relevant norms\nand their applications to practical reasoning are the work of\npractical wisdom (phronesis), in conjunction with the\nexcellences of character, as Aristotle suggests (LeBar 2013a). \nSome constructivist theories define their scope more narrowly than the\ntheories discussed in\n sections 2–4.\n They seek to provide objectivist accounts of the basic principles of\nmorality, rather than of all normative principles. Most\nconstructivists about morality hold that the relevant sort of\nagreement of which moral reasons are the product is best captured in\nterms of a hypothetical contract (Scanlon 1998; Hill 1989, 2001; Milo\n1995). ‘Contractualism’ is thus the normative theory that\nis typically associated with metaethical constructivism, even though\nit is not accepted by all Kantians (compare O’Neill 1989a: 10;\nO’Neill 2015). Hobbesian theories occupy a prominent place in\nthe contractualism debate. To explain the nature of morality and of\nmoral truths, Hobbesians do not use the term\n“construction”, but “hypothetical contract”.\nHowever, many think of construction as a form of hypothetical\nprocedure akin to contract (Street 2010: 365; Darwall, Gibbard, &\nRailton 1997: 13, and see section 3. In\n 5.1\n and\n 5.2,\n we shall discuss two prominent varieties of constructivism whose\nscope is restricted to moral judgment; in\n 5.3\n other emerging varieties will be briefly presented. \nThomas Scanlon defends a restricted constructivist account of\njustification for a specific class of moral judgments of right and\nwrong (Scanlon 1998: 11–12, chapter 4, §7.2; 2008,\n2014>: 94–98). In contrast to Korsgaard and O’Neill,\nScanlon rejects Kantian constructivism as a broad metaethical view\nabout all normative truths. Part of his argument is that moral matters\ncannot be resolved by appealing to the bare structure of rationality\n(the constitutive norm of practical reason) and instead, need to be\naddressed by engaging in substantive arguments (Scanlon 2003b:\n14–15, Scanlon 2014: 90–104), although this is something\nthat many Kantians would concede. His aim is to elucidate the truth of\nclaims concerning right and wrong in terms of their being entailed\nfrom the point of view of a certain contractual situation. \nScanlon’s method of construction is the contractualist formula\naccording to which an act is wrong if its performance under the\ncircumstances would be prohibited by any set of principles that no one\ncould reasonably reject as a basis for informed, unforced, general\nagreement. This test of rejectability specifies the content of moral\nprinciples, and tells us why it is rational for us to adopt them. The\ncorrectness of moral principles is explained in terms of a\nhypothetical agreement among the relevant set of individuals specified\nin terms of their motivation and the process of reasoning they employ.\nThere are no correct moral principles independently of the rational\nagreement that the criterion of rejectability specifies. The property\nof being right is constituted by what a group of reasonable agents,\nunder certain specified conditions, would find non-rejectable (Scanlon\n1998: 380 n 48). \nThe test of rejectability is compatible with several kinds of\ndisagreement about right and wrong, in particular, with disagreement\nabout the standards for assessing conduct, and about the reasons for\nsupporting these standards. To acknowledge the latter sorts of\ndisagreement does not lead to relativism: it does not entail that\nthere is no answer to the question of which side is correct about the\nreasons people have or that all answers are equally valid. \nScanlon argues that the constructivist account of general normativity\nis exposed to the objection of bootstrapping, because it tries to\njustify the normativity of reasons by a method that already assumes\nthe normativity of reason (Scanlon 2014: 96–104). Thus, unlike\nKorsgaard and Street, Scanlon holds that truths about reasons for\naction are not true in virtue of being arrived at through some\nspecified procedure of “construction”. We can arrive at\nconclusions about reasons by engaging in normative reasoning, (for\nexample employing the method of reflective equilibrium.) But the steps\nin reasoning of this kind involve making substantive judgments about\nwhat reasons we have. Because it requires such judgments as inputs,\nreasoning of this kind is not a process through which all facts about\nreasons are constructed (Scanlon 2014: 102–103). \nAccording to Scanlon, in order for there to be truths about reasons,\nit is not necessary for these normative facts to have a kind of\nmetaphysical reality that good normative reasoning might not\nguarantee. There is no question “external” to ordinary\nfirst-order normative thinking about whether such facts really exist,\njust as there is no such “external” question about\nmathematical facts (Scanlon 2014: 16–26.) In this regard,\nScanlon’s view bears some deep similarities with Rudolph\nCarnap’s theory (Carnap 1956). Scanlon’s normative realism\nis thus less “robust” than what some other realists such\nas David Enoch believe is required (Scanlon 2014: 14, compare Enoch\n2011a: 112–113). \nSociety-based constructivism – elaborated by David Copp, holds\nthat there are true moral standards, which are the output of a\ndecision procedure that takes into account the needs and values of the\nsociety and facts about the society’s circumstances (Copp 1995,\n2007). Accordingly, the theory accounts for moral truth as depending\non what would be rational for societies to choose. Copp’s view\nshares some important features with Kantian constructivism. First,\nsociety-based constructivism holds that societies need their members\nto endorse some suitable moral code in order to facilitate\ncooperation. It thus takes morality to be a cooperative enterprise,\nand implies that the need for objective moral standards is practical.\nSecond, this view explains the nature of moral truth in procedural\nterms, and thus it implies that there are no moral facts independently\nof the procedure (Rawls 1980: 307). Third, it also shares the claim\nthat to be adequate, any metaethics should make sense of the\nnormativity of moral claims and their practical relevance (Copp 2007:\n4–7, 2013). Like Kantian constructivism, it holds that we are\nbound by moral obligations independently of our actual motivational\nstates. Finally, society-based constructivism also claims that any\nplausible metaethics should be at least compatible with\nnaturalism. \nHowever, society-based constructivism differs from the various Kantian\nconstructivisms because of its account of the decision procedure from\nwhich moral standards are said to result, and its different\nexplanation of normativity. While the procedure specifies a function\nof practical rationality, it does not commit to any specific view\nabout autonomy. \nIn contrast to the antirealist varieties of metaethical\nconstructivism, Copp defends society-based constructivism as both a\ndecisively realist and naturalistic theory. It is realist insofar as\nit claims that moral propositions are truth-evaluable, and that some\nmoral properties are instantiated; and it is naturalistic because it\nclaims that such moral properties are natural properties (Copp\n1995). \nIt is worth mentioning that conventionalism, the view that moral\nclaims are based on social convention, often uses the metaphor of\nconstruction: it is defended as the view that moral truths are\nconstructed by the actual agreement of some groups within specific\ntraditions (Wong 2008). \nOther varieties of metaethical constructivism are emerging, building\nupon the insights of philosophers other than Kant: the Spinozian\nvariety (Zuck 2015), the Smithian variety (Stueber 2016), the Hegelian\nvariety (Westphal 2013; Rockmore 2016; Laitinen 2016, and the\nNietzschean variety (Katsafanas 2013; Silk 2015). Not all of them\nclaim a place in metaethics, independently of existing forms of\nrealism and antirealism. But they all find that the notion of\nconstruction is a distinctive explanatory device for capturing the\nobjectivity and normativity of ethical truths. \nConstructivism has become a major view in contemporary practical\nphilosophy. However, scholars are divided about its place, promise and\nprospects as a metaethical theory. The appeal of constructivism as a\nmetaethical theory is often thought to consist in its promise to offer\na minimalist account of moral objectivity that retains the benefits of\nnonnaturalist realism, while avoiding its epistemological and\nontological costs (Darwall, Gibbard, & Railton 1992; Shafer-Landau\n2003: chapter 4). But this is hardly distinctive of constructivism\njust as such. Naturalist realism, an alternative to constructivism,\nalso promises objectivity without the epistemological and ontological\ncosts of nonnaturalist realism. And the defense of objectivity on\nnon-ontological grounds has also been a preoccupation of antirealism\n(Hare 1952; Gibbard 1990; Wright 1992: 6 ff). A better way to present\nwhat constructivism purports to offer is to say that it claims to be\nthe best candidate for reconciling various tensions among the apparent\nfeatures of normative truths: their objectivity, our knowledge of\nthem, and their practical significance for us, including the authority\nthey have or claim (Scanlon 2014: 91). Constructivists think that\ntraditional metaethical theories cannot account for these features\nbecause they misunderstand the nature of practical reason. Thus, their\nclaim is that to solve metaethical problems about the nature of\nethical judgments and normative truths, one should start with an\naccount of practical reason, that which has been left out by standard\nmetaethics. To this extent, constructivists regard standard metaethics\nas misguided.  \nThus far, constructivists have not elaborated a distinctive account of\nthe meaning and logical behavior of moral and normative terms and\nconcepts. Absent a distinctively constructivist semantics, some think\nthat constructivism is best understood as “a family of\nsubstantive moral theories” (Darwall et al. 1992: 140;\nHussain & Shah 2006, 2013; Enoch 2009; Hussain 2012; Ridge 2012).\nFor some this means that constructivism does not qualify as a\nmetaethical theory: in seeking to understand normative concepts as\nreferring to solutions to practical problems, constructivism does not\nmove “up to metaethics”, insofar as this talk of problems\nand their solutions “is itself normative talk” (Ridge\n2012). \nThis criticism rests on the assumption that there is a sharp division\nbetween normative ethics and metaethics. The constructivist project is\nto advance our understanding of moral principles and their limits by\n“clarifying our understanding of the reasons that make familiar\nmoral principles ones that no one could reasonably reject”\n(Scanlon 1998: 246–247; 2003a: 429–435). The purpose of\ntheorizing in ethics is partly interpretive and partly normative.\nThus, there seems to be a disagreement between constructivists and\ntheir critics about what it takes to engage in a metaethical inquiry.\nFor the constructivist, there is an interesting continuity between\nnormative discourse and metaethics. \nFurthermore, some constructivists account for their lack of interest\nin semantics with the conviction that the semantic task with which\ntraditional metaethics is preoccupied is positively misguided\n(Korsgaard 1996a, 2003; Street 2008a: 239). The philosophical issue\nworth thinking about is normativity, and this is not something that we\ncan explain solely via semantics. For Kantians, explaining normativity\nrequires philosophers to engage in philosophical investigation into\nthe ideas of autonomy, agency, and practical rationality (see\n section 7). \nWhile also preoccupied with explaining normativity, other\nconstructivists view the semantic task as worthwhile (Street 2010;\nRichardson 2013). In fact, they take themselves to discharge the\nsemantic task with their account of what is constitutive of the\nattitude of valuing. By identifying the constitutive norms that one\nmust be following in order to count as a rational valuer at all, some\nconstructivists have sketched  \na so-called inferentialist semantics for normative terms: the meaning\nof normative terms is explained by identifying the kinds of inferences\n(for example, about means and ends) one must be making in order to\ncount as employing normative concepts at all. (Street 2010:\n239–242)  \nThis reply commits the constructivist to showing that her proposal has\nsome advantages over its competitors. \nAnother question about constructivism is whether it is committed to\nany theory of truth. Constructivists must deny the correspondence\ntheory of truth, the view that truth is correspondence to a fact. On\nthe other hand, constructivism can take on board the idea that\nnormative judgments are truth-apt. This view is hospitable to the\nconstructivist claim that moral and normative truths may alter over\ntime, as a result of ongoing rational deliberation and revision\n(Richardson 2013; LeBar 2013b; O’Neill 1992, 2015; Laitinen\n2016). Some attempts to deal with semantic issues bring to light a\nresemblance between constructivism and pragmatism, which holds that a\nproposition is true if it works satisfactorily, and that the meaning\nof a proposition is to be found in the practical implications of\naccepting it (Misak 2000; Richardson 1998, 2013). Like pragmatism,\nconstructivism appeals to the practical point of view to account for\ntruth, in contrast to standard forms of realism about truth (Proulx\n2016; Elgin 1997; Richardson 2013; Schwartz 2017). Some critics are\nskeptical about the possibility of developing a constructivist account\nof truth (Hussain 2012: 189ff; Dorsey 2012). \nBoth Rawls (1980) and O’Neill (1989a) present Kantian\nconstructivism as a third option between realism and relativism (see\nalso Korsgaard 1996a: 36). However, not all constructivists share this\nview. In fact, some place constructivism in the realist camp (Copp,\nLeBar), and others in the antirealist camp (Lenman). Scanlon sides\nwith realism about reasons but defends a constructivist account of the\nnature and truth of moral judgments (Scanlon 1998, 2014, 2003b: 18).\nStreet admits to some kind of relativism. This shows that it would be\na mistake to judge constructivism’s impact in metaethics solely\nin terms of its contribution to the realism-antirealism debate\n(Korsgaard 2008: 312, 325 n. 49; Copp 2013; Engstrom 2013: 138ff). \nEfforts to situate constructivism in relation to realism and\nantirealism are complicated by the fact that there are different\ndefinitions of ‘realism’ (e.g., Sayre-McCord 2015; Joyce\n2015; Miller 2014). Realists agree that (a) moral discourse is\ncognitivist like non-moral discourse, (b) there are moral properties,\nsuch as rightness, (c) moral properties are sometimes instantiated,\nand (d) moral predicates express properties. But there is a\ndisagreement as to whether in order to be a form of realism, a theory\nmust hold a stronger claim that (e) moral properties are\nmind-independent. A further division, internal to realism, concerns\nthe commitment to naturalism, which includes the claims that (f) moral\nproperties are like any ordinary property and have the same\nmetaphysical status as non-moral properties, whatever that is, and\nthat (g) moral assertions express ordinary beliefs regarding the\ninstantiation of these properties. All constructivists share a\ncommitment to naturalism, but reject (e), holding that the\ninstantiation of properties depend on features of our sensibility or\nrational agency, rather than being mind-independent. In general,\nconstructivism shares with both realist naturalism and antirealism\nbroadly defined the commitment to metaphysical parsimony. This is\nwhere it differs from classical and “robust” moral realism\n(Enoch 2011a). \nKorsgaard points to an assumption she believes that realists and\nantirealists share and that constructivists reject, namely, that the\nprimary function of concepts deployed in judgments that can be true or\nfalse is to represent things as they are, so if normative judgments\nare true, they must represent something real out there in the world.\nBy contrast, constructivists think that normative concepts, which are\ndeployed in judgments that can be true or false, have a practical\nfunction: they name solutions to practical problems, rather than\nrepresent features of reality (Korsgaard 2008: 302 ff.). For instance,\nthe concept equity does not stand for a property; instead, it proposes\na response to the practical problem of how to distribute goods.\nKorsgaard draws the contrast between constructivism and other\nmetaethical theories as follows. Unlike substantive realism, which\nholds that moral judgments are true insofar as they represent a\nmind-independent normative reality, and antirealism, which denies that\nthere are normative truths because it denies that there are normative\nproperties, constructivists hold that practical judgments can be true\nor false without representing mind-independent normative facts about\nthe world (Korsgaard 2003: 325 n 49). \nThis way of characterizing constructivism fails to neatly mark the\ncontrast between constructivism and other metaethical views. First,\nKorsgaard’s characterization takes realism to be committed to\nclaim (e) about mind-independence. But not all define realism in this\nrestrictive way (Sayre-McCord 1988; Copp 2007: 7). When realism is\ndefined more capaciously, it includes views according to which moral\njudgments are made true by facts that depend on some mental states.\nSecond, Korsgaard’s way of drawing the contrast seems to\noverlook the fact that some contemporary versions of antirealism do\nnot deny that moral judgments are truth-apt. Instead, they adopt a\ndeflationary conception of truth as a semantic notion (Ridge 2012;\nLenman & Shemmer 2012b). Constructivism stakes out a middle ground\nbetween forms of realism that are committed to mind-independent\nnormative truths and forms of antirealism that deny that there are any\nnormative truths. To this extent, it agrees with other kinds of\nmetaethics, which are qualified forms of realism or\n‘sophisticated forms of subjectivism’ (Wiggins 1993;\nMcDowell 1985). However, sophisticated subjectivism importantly relies\non sensibility, while Kantian constructivism requires that normative\ntruths be dependent on features of rational agency. In this sense,\nthere is an interesting contrast to be drawn between Kantian\nconstructivism and reductivist versions of sophisticated subjectivism\nor response-dependent realism. \nSome say that constructivism is best understood as a form\n‘expressivism,’ which holds that normative terms function\nto guide action rather than represent matters of fact and are used to\nexpress states of mind that differ from belief (Chrisman 2010; Lenman\n2012; Lenman & Shemmer 2012b; Meyers 2012). Furthermore, Lenman\nargues that embracing expressivism would promise to solve a basic\nproblem for constructivism, specifically, the problem of identifying\nthe kinds of mental state that normative judgments are (Lenman 2012).\nThis suggestion is not shared. Humean constructivist Street has\nforcefully argued that expressivism fails to fully explain the\nnormative function of normative discourse, which cannot be reduced to\nexpressing normative states (Korsgaard 2003, 2008: 312, 325 n. 49,\n2009: 309; Bagnoli 2002: 130–132; Magri 2002; Street 2010:\n239–242). \nConstructivism’s insight is that practical truths should be\nexplained in terms of the constitutive features of practical\nreasoning, which the notion of ‘construction’ is supposed\nto capture. But critics argue that the constructivist conception of\npractical reasoning is either arbitrary or parasitic on independent\nmoral values. The objection often takes the form of a metaethical\ndilemma similar to the dilemma discussed by Plato in the\nEuthyphro (10a). Either the practical standpoint is subject\nto moral constraints or it is not. If it is not, then  \nthere is no reason to expect that the principles that emerge …\nwill capture our deepest convictions, or respect various platitudes\nthat fix our understanding of ethical concepts. (Shafer-Landau 2003:\n42)  \nIf it is, then the constraints are not themselves constructed and\nacceptance of them commits one to realism (Shafer-Landau 2003: 42).\nConstructivism thus either grounds moral truths on arbitrary standards\nor collapses into realism. \nThere are at least two ways of formulating and motivating this\nobjection. First, the objection can be that constructivism relies on\nmoral intuitions, which it never proves. Second, the objection can be\nthat the appeal to unconstructed norms that govern and constitute the\nactivity of rational choice commits one to realism. \nConsider the first objection that constructivism relies on an\n“unconstructed”, hence unjustified – set of\nnormative constraints on theorizing (Hare 1983). For instance, Kantian\nconstructivism appears to be grounded on the value of moral\nimpartiality, which demands equal respect for persons (Scanlon 1998:\n22–33; 287–290; Rawls 1993: 38–54). The worry is\nthat, in the final analysis, constructivism is vacuous because\n“its test yields results only by presupposing moral views which\ncan only be established independently of it” (Raz 2003: 358;\nTimmons 2003; Cohen 2003; Brink 1987, 1989; Hare 1983). Furthermore,\nthere is  \nno non-question-begging feature to which the constructivist can help\nherself in breaking symmetry among the various competing sets of\nconstructed principles. (Timmons 2003: §3) \nKant is keenly aware of the air of paradox surrounding the claim that\nthe moral concepts, such as good and evil, are not determined prior to\nengaging in practical reasoning, but only as a result of engaging in\npractical reasoning. This is known as the ‘paradox of the\nmethod’ (Kant C2, 5: 62 ff.) As Rawls explains it,  \nThe difficulty is that Kant appears to know in advance of critical\nreflection how a constructivist doctrine might look, but this makes it\nimpossible to undertake such reflection in good faith. In reply to\nthis quite proper worry, we interpret constructivism as a view about\nhow the structure and content of the soundest moral doctrine would\nlook once it is laid out after due critical reflection. (Rawls 2000:\n274)  \nPractical reasoning does not serve the purpose of discovering an order\nof values independent of its verdicts. Nonetheless, for Kantian\nconstructivists there is some sort of practical knowledge, which\ndisplays a self-conscious character, can only be accommodated by\naccounts that represent the operation of the cognitive capacity as\nself-conscious activity (Rawls 2000: 148, see also 218; Engstrom 2013;\nBagnoli 2013b; Jezzi 2016: §5). From this perspective, the\nnovelty of constructivism consists in providing an account of\nobjective practical knowledge that does not presuppose an independent\nmoral reality to which the mind must conform, but accounts for such\nreality in terms of the cognitive activity of reason. \nConstructivists and their critics disagree about the role to accord to\nintuitions in rational justification. According to Scanlon, a valid\nmethod of justification in ethics consists in testing the congruence\nbetween theoretical assumptions and intuitive moral judgments, that\nis, judgments to which we normally accord initial credence. It is\ndoubtful that we could avoid all appeal to intuitions as unpromising\n(Scanlon 1998: 241–247). However, the intuitions on which\nconstructivism relies are not independent moral truths and do not\nserve as an external foundation for morality (Rawls 2000: 178, 273).\nNot all constructivists view intuitions as playing a role in rational\njustification (O’Neill 1989b). But all agree that an adequate\nmetaethics should not be totally revisionary; rather, it should be\ncongruent with common understandings of rationality and morality\n(Smith 2013: 313). Arguably, this commitment sets constructivism apart\nfrom those kinds of projectivist and error theories (Blackburn 1993;\nMackie 1977, which claim that evaluative discourse involves a\nsystematic error (Bagnoli 2002; Street 2010; Lillehammer 2011. \nThe second way to construe the objection that constructivism tacitly\nrelies on realism focuses on the constitutivist strategy, which is\nadopted by many constructivists. This strategy appeals to constitutive\nhence “unconstructed” features of agency to ground a set\nof normative constraints. Constructivists hold that the appeal to such\nconstraints is neither arbitrary nor does it commit constructivism to\nmoral realism. But how does constructivism justify the norms it claims\nto be constitutive of practical reason? Again, the objection says,\neither they are arbitrary or they are realist and depend on some\nnormative features of reality, which are unconstructed (Fitzpatrick\n2013; Stern 2013; Baiasu 2016; Bratu & Dittmeyer 2016). \nWhile this criticism is addressed especially to Kantian\nconstructivism, in some sense it threatens all views that appeal to\nconstitutive norms of reasoning (Ripstein 1987; Enoch 2006,\n2011b). \nIs there anything ultimately at stake in whether we call the appeal to\nconstitutive norms realist, rather than constructivist? In addressing\nthe question “Why does x count as a reason for doing\ny?” both realists and constructivists deploy\nunconstructed or underived elements. Non-naturalist realists say:\n“It just does”, it is “simply true” that facts\nsuch as x count as a reason for doing y, and\n“there won’t be any illuminating explanation of what makes\nthem true” (Shafer-Landau 2003: 47, 48). In other words,\nrealists take the normativity of reasons as a primitive feature that\ndoes not require any explanation and for which no further explanation\nwill be useful. By contrast, naturalist realists hold that normative\nfacts are just natural facts, which can be investigated by ordinary\nempirical methods, for example, facts about the responses of agents\nunder idealized (naturalistically described) circumstances (see Smith\n2012, 2013). \nConstructivists would disagree with both views. The aim of\nconstructivism is not the reduction of moral properties to natural\nproperties; rather, this theory proposes a self-authenticating account\nof the standards of practical reason (O’Neill 1989b; Korsgaard\n2003, 2009; Street 2010; Velleman 2009, compare Smith 2012, 2013). \nIn contrast to some kinds of realism, constructivism does not seek\naxioms or first principles or objective values on which to ground\nmoral truths (Bagnoli 2014, 2016). Rather than providing an external\nfoundation for morality, it holds that in forming our intentions and\nbeliefs, we are answerable to criteria of correctness that are\ninternal to and constitutive of the very exercise of rationality\n(Korsgaard 2008: 13–15, 110–126, 207–229).\n“Constitutive standards are opposed to external standards, which\nmention desiderata for an object that are not essential to its being\nthe kind of thing that it is” (Korsgaard 2008: 8). The\nconstructivist conviction is that appeal to standards constitutive of\nagency explains with ease why such standards are normative (Korsgaard\n2008: 8). They are normative because in the very activity of reasoning\nwe are committing ourselves to being guided by them (Wallace\n2012). \nAs O’Neill remarks, the constructivist vindication of reason is\n“avowedly circular”:  \nIf the standards of practical reasoning are fundamental to all human\nreasoning, then any vindication of these standards is either circular\n(since it uses those very standards) or a failure (since it is not a\nvindication in terms of the standards that are said to be\nfundamental). (O’Neill 1989b: 29)  \nThis kind of reply is shared by Kantians (Bagnoli 2016), Humeans\n(Velleman 2009: 138–141) and other constitutivists (Ferrero\n2010a; Katsafanas 2013; Smith 2013; Arruda 2016). \nThe constitutivist strategy appears to be particularly problematic for\nthe varieties of Kantian constructivism that derive moral obligations\nfrom structural features of rational agency. Many contend that\nunderstood as a constitutive standard the categorical imperative is\nnot rich enough to identify moral obligations (Cohen 1996; Bratman\n1998; Gibbard 1999: 149, 152–153; Fitzpatrick 2005). Some\nconstructivists offer similar grounds for rejecting Kantian\nconstructivism about reasons (see\n sections 3,\n 4,\n 5.1).\n In fact, most Kantian constructivists deny that moral obligations can\nbe derived from universal features of bare rationality alone and also\ndeny that appeal to constitutive norms of rationality is sufficient to\nprovide a complete system of moral duties (Bagnoli forthcoming). \nThere is room for disagreement concerning the principles that are\nthought to be constitutive of rational agency. Arguably, the principle\nof logical consistency is one such principle but it is generally\nthought to be too thin to help in rational choice. By itself,\nconsistency does not seem to account for the kind of constraints that\nrational agents need to impose on the dynamic process of goal\nmanagement (Shemmer 2012; Gibbard 1999; Smith 1999). To account for\nthese normative constraints, some add a broad principle of coherence,\nwhich demands a unified account of the agent’s goals, and thus\ngoes beyond strict logical consistency (Shemmer 2012). Others argue\nfor additional but related principles, which regulate attention and\ndisregard (James 2007, 2012), respect for others having equal standing\n(Bagnoli 2013b), benevolence and non-interference (Smith 2013: 322,\n328). Kantians hold that the normativity of instrumental principles of\nrationality rests on the normativity of non-instrumental principles\n(O’Neill 1989b: 73–74; Korsgaard 1997, 2008: esp.\n67–69). \nThe differences among these views can be illustrated by comparing\ntheir respective diagnoses of a fictional Caligula whose state of mind\nis completely coherent but who values torturing people for fun (Street\n2010: 371). For realists, he is in error about some true moral value.\nThere are some reasons—for example, the reason not to torture\nothers for fun—that we have quite independently of our\nevaluative attitudes and practical reasoning. Kantians agree with\nrealists that fictional Caligula has no good reasons for torturing\nanyone, but differ in explaining why this is so. Some Kantians think\nthat fictional Caligula is incoherent, even though not obviously so.\nHis incoherence can be shown by spelling out the norms that are\nconstitutive of valuing. Such constitutive norms entail valuing\nhumanity, and this shows that fictional Caligula is making a mistake\nby his own lights, even though he may never fully realize this, due to\npoor reflection, ignorance of the non-normative facts or some other\nlimitation (Korsgaard 1996a: 121–123). A different Kantian\nargument establishes that an internally coherent Caligula is\nconceivable, that is, he can be thought without contradiction, but his\ncase is blocked by general facts about moral sensibility (Engstrom\n2009: 243, § III.7, Bagnoli 2009). Such a Caligula would have no\nreason to torture others. By contrast, Humean constructivists hold\nthat an internally coherent Caligula is possible and that such a\nperson has reasons for torturing others (Street 2009). \nRecent debates about constructivism focus on its “constitutivist\nstrategy”, which explains the normativity of (practical or\nmoral) reasons in terms of what is constitutive of agency. For\ninstance, Korsgaard (2009) argues that the principles governing action\nare “constitutive standards” of agency, that is, standards\narising from the nature of agency itself. The marks of agency are\nautonomy and efficacy, and the categorical and hypothetical\nimperatives are norms grounded on these two properties. These norms\nare “constitutive” of agency in that (i) they determine\nwhat an agent is (“constitution requirement”), (ii) an\nagent makes herself into an agent, and into the particular agent who\nshe is, by conforming to those standards (“self-constitution\nrequirement”). According to Korsgaard (2019), Kantian\nconstructivism is uniquely positioned to vindicate the\nself-constitution requirement while Humean and Aristotelian theories\nfail to meet it. But there is a disagreement about whether\nconstitutivism is compatible with Kant’s ethics. While some\nscholar hold that the constitutivist strategy is a distinctively\nKantian move in response to moral skepticism (O’Neill 1989,\nKorsgaard 2019, Engstrom 2009, Bagnoli 2019, Shafer 2019), others hold\nthat it does not serve the Kantian agenda (Gobsch 2019, Saemi 2016,\nTenenbaum 2016). \nConstitutive standards are supposed to be partly descriptive of the\nvery activity that they have to assess (Korsgaard 2008: 9). Critics\nobject that it is unclear whether and how they can be violated (Cohen\n1996: 177; Lavin 2004; Kolodny 2005). For an agent to be correctly\nsaid to have norms, she must be able to break those norms. Suppose\nthat there is a norm that prevents deception. To say that a rational\nagent is guided by such a norm is to say that she can violate it. But\nif the norm is constitutive of reasoning, how can she break the norm\nby reasoning? If constitutive norms cannot be violated, constitutivism\nimplies that immoralism and irrationality are impossible. Korsgaard\nreplies that to count as acting at all, we must at least be trying to\nfollow the principles of practical reason, but she allows that we may\nfail to do so adequately or fully (Korsgaard 2009: 45–49,\n159–176. For instance, while adopting the moral end of\nbenevolence, we may lack grace and understanding, so as to provoke\nresentment, rather than elicit gratitude. Herman proposes that in\ndefective instances of acting, the constitutive norms are not\nmisapplied but misrepresented (Herman 2007: 171–172,\n245–246). For instance, by making a poor judgment about what to\ndo in self-defense, one mischaracterizes and misunderstands what\nself-defense is and what it requires. \nA second objection is that the constitutivist strategy partly depends\non the claim that agency is inescapable, but critics think that agency\nis as optional as any other particular activity (Enoch 2006; Tiffany\n2012, Leffner 2019). Constitutivists have tried to answer\nEnoch’s “schmagency” objection by arguing that it\nfails to appreciate the inescapability of agency itself. While it is\npossible to disengage from any particular ordinary activities, some\nsort of agency continues to operate (Ferrero 2010a; Velleman 2009:\n138–141; James 2012). In this sense, agency is not optional.\nEnoch has further objected that, even when some sort of activity is\nalways in place, this is not enough to say that the norms constituting\nthe activity produce normative reasons for action for any one agent\n(Enoch 2011b). But the constitutivist point is that questions about\nreasons to be agents must be taken up within agency (Velleman 2009:\n204–206). One does not need a reason to be an agent rather than\nnot, and so Enoch’s question is not a live question (Rosati\n2016: 201 n. 71; Silverstein 2015: 1136–1138). A similar reply\nis produced on the basis of considerations about the desires that are\nappropriate to idealized agents (Smith 2012, 2013; Lindeman 2019).\nFinally, 0’Hagan (2014) defends a minimal conception of\nconstitutivism against Enoch’s shmagency objection, arguing that\nagential constitutivism has the resources to take morality, normative\nand ethical deliberation seriously. She provides an analysis of the\ninescapability and nature of deliberation to support the conclusion\nthat constitutivism coheres with the phenomenology of first-personal\ndeliberation and supports a non-realist but robust account of moral\nobjectivity. \nAlthough these replies are effective against some versions of the\nshmagency objection, several authors point out that they leave\nconstitutivism vulnerable to other worries. For instance, Tenenbaum\n(2019) contends that the constitutivism leaves us alienated from the\nmoral norms that it claims we must follow. For Ferrero (2019) the\nappeal to inescapability works best as a defensive move, but fails to\nsustain robust normativity. \nWhether agents have conclusive reasons to be agents, however, might\ndepend on the particular version of constitutivism. For most\nconstitutivists, this involves grounding authoritative norms in the\nteleological structure of agency (Korsgaard 2009, Engstrom 2009). For\nothers, the constitutivist project can be salvaged only if it is\nsupplemented with a reductive metanormative account of reasons for\naction, which links reasons to sound or successful practical reasoning\n(Silverstein 2016). \nA third worry is voiced by Bratman (2012). He criticizes\nconstructivists for imposing excessive constraints on rational\ndeliberation, which eventually put agents in tension with their own\npre-reflective normative judgments. As a consequence, reflective\nagents may find themselves holding incompatible (prereflective and\nreflective) judgments. For instance, one might be required to\nreflectively give up one’s loyalties and attachments because\nthey do not cohere with one’s impartial duties, even though such\nloyalties shape one’s life. This is a problem even when the\nconstitutive norm is a formal requirement of consistency, as it is for\nStreet. Furthermore, if the input judgments include attitudes such as\nlove and caring, which are not necessarily responsive to\nintersubjective pressures, agents may end up endorsing reflective\njudgments that are not aligned with their unreflective judgments. This\nobjection points to a difficulty for constructivism insofar as it\nadopts constitutive strategies, but it also indicates the importance\nof the temporal dimensions of rational agency (James 2012; Ferrero\n2009, 2010b; Smith 2013: 315ff). Relatedly, s new significant line of\nresearch develops varieties of constructivism that take into account\nthe predicaments of contingency,the possibility normative revisions\n(Baldwin 2013, Richardson 2018), moral progress (Arruda 2016), and\nconcrete forms of normativity (Gledhill and Stein 2020). \nIn the last thirty years, constructivism emerged and established\nitself as one recognizable form of metaethics. As with other\nmetaethical theories, it faces serious objections, but it also makes a\nsignificant contribution to many debates, some of which originated\nfrom constructivist challenges to traditional metaethics.","contact.mail":"carla.bagnoli@unimore.it","contact.domain":"unimore.it"}]
