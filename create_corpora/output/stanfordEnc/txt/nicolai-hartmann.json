While\nHartmann was in many respects a classic philosopher and wrote\nbook-length works scrutinizing and developing all the major fields of\nphilosophy, including the philosophy of history, ethics and\naesthetics, his leading interest was ontology. He systematically\ndeveloped a comprehensive and rich theory of categories, which set out\nhis thought on ontological modalities, the difference between the\nspheres of real and ideal being, the fundamental categories of\nreality, the ontological levels in which reality is structured, and\ncosmological categories.\n\n\n\nNicolai Hartmann (b. Riga, 1882, d. Göttingen, 1950; for\nbiographical information, see Harich 2000, Heiss 1961 and F. Hartmann\n1978) was recognized in the first half of the twentieth century as one\nof the leading German philosophers, on a par with Husserl or\nHeidegger.  After the Second World War, Hartmann was elected President\nof the German Philosophical Association for both the acknowledged\nvalue of his philosophical ideas and his apparent lack of any improper\ncompromise with Nazism. The only paper in English published by\nHartmann during his lifetime appeared in Mind in 1949, and it\nwas written in his capacity as President of the German Philosophical\nAssociation. Its purpose was to inform the philosophical community\nabout the results achieved by German philosophers in the years before\nthe Second World War. After Hartmann’s death in 1950, however, his\nideas attracted no further attention. The sixty years that have passed\nsince the war have seen waves of interest in a number of thinkers,\nsuch as Brentano or Meinong, who have never been part of mainstream\nphilosophy. But Hartmann’s ideas have never again been a topic of\ndiscussion. It is difficult to determine why things have gone this\nway. Some aspects of Hartmann’s style may provide the beginnings of an\nanswer. He systematically adopted a non-speculative style of analysis,\nadmitting only the minimum of metaphysics needed to frame the problems\nthat ontology proves unable to address. His language was clear, and\nhis method was rigorous, almost pedantic, proceeding punctiliously\nstep by step, without anticipating solutions or taking anything for\ngranted.  His writings are so precisely organized that their reader is\nheld in check and feels unable to foresee the next step in the\nargumentation. \n\nSerious research is required to explain the neglect of Hartmann’s\nthought. The recent establishment of the\n Nicolai Hartmann Society \n has shown that scholars interested in Nicolai\nHartmann and his ideas are present everywhere, not only in North\nAmerica and Europe but also in South America and Asia. The proceedings\nof the first international conference on Nicolai Hartmann (Poli,\nScognamiglio, Tremblay 2011) and this entry provide information on\nHartmann’s thought that may contribute to open evaluation of his\ncontributions to philosophy. \n\nThus far, only two book-length works by Hartmann have been\ntranslated into English, the three volumes of the Ethics and\nthe short New Ways of Ontology. Two more books are presently\nunder translation: Possibility and Actuality and\nAesthetics (both are scheduled to appear in 2013, see\nHartmann 2013a,b). The translation of one of his papers has also been\ncompleted and will soon be published (Hartmann 2012). English readers\ncan rely on only five book-length presentations of Hartmann’s\nthought (two published in 2011): Poli, Scognamiglio and\nTremblay’s The Philosophy of Nicolai Hartmann (2011);\nKelly’s Material Ethics of Value—Max Scheler and\nNicolai Hartmann (2011); Werkmeister’s Nicolai\nHartmann’s New Ontology (1990), Cadwallader’s\nSearchlight on Values: Nicolai Hartmann’s Twentieth-century\nValue Platonism (1984), and Mohanty’s older\nNicolai Hartmann and Alfred North Whitehead. A Study in Recent\nPlatonism (1957). \n\nIn many respects, Hartmann was a classic philosopher: he wrote\nbook-length works scrutinizing and developing all the major fields of\nphilosophy. Plato’s Logic of Being (1909) paved the way\nfor his understanding of the sphere of ideal (or abstract) being, while\nThe Problem of Spiritual Being (1933), the three volumes of\nEthics (1926) and the Aesthetics (1953) delved into\nthe many intricacies of the spiritual stratum of reality (on which see\nSection 6 below), an inquiry prepared for by his systematic analysis\nof German Idealism (The Philosophy of German Idealism, 2\nvols., 1923 and 1929). Hartmann addressed the problem of knowledge and\nthe connections between epistemology and ontology in\nhis Metaphysics of Knowledge (1921). His leading interest was\nontology, however. All his works—Ethics\nand Aesthetics included—have an unmistakably\nontological bent. The overall architecture of his ontology was set out\nin four books: Foundations of Ontology\n(1935), Possibility and Actuality (1938),\nThe Construction of the Real World (1940), and\nPhilosophy of Nature (1950). New Ways of Ontology\n(En. tr. 1953) is a simplified and highly compressed presentation of\nthe overall framework. Preliminary to the four-volume ontological set\nis the already-mentioned Metaphysics of Knowledge. Put\nbriefly, Metaphysics of Knowledge discusses the interaction\nbetween epistemology and ontology and the inevitable dependence of any\nepistemology on ontology. \n\nFoundations of Ontology paved the way for a systematic\ntreatment of ontology by introducing (1) the difference between modes\nof being (the modalities of possibility, necessity and actuality),\nspheres of being (real and ideal) and ways of being (Dasein\nand Sosein), and (2) a treatment of emotional transcendent\nacts as constituting the requisite pre-conceptual acquaintance with the\nharshness of reality. \n\nThe main thesis put forward by Hartmann in the Foundations of\nOntology is that all ontological differences are articulations of\nbeing, not differences between being and non-being. Parts and wholes\nare both authentic aspects of being; independent and dependent entities\nare similarly aspects of being; physical, biological, psychological and\nspiritual types of being are all manifestations of being, and none of\nthem is “more being” than any other. From the point of view\nof ontology, no part, aspect, or moment of reality is “more\nbeing” than any other part, aspect or moment of it. The fact\nthat, say, the existence of biological entities depends on that of\nphysical entities does not imply that physics is “more\nontologically real” than biology. Existentially dependent\nentities are as ontologically genuine as existentially independent\nones. All entities, whatever their type, demand the same careful\nontological scrutiny. \n\nHartmann’s analytic development of ontology begins with the\ntheory of ontological modalities elaborated in Possibility and\nActuality. The main purpose of this book is to demonstrate that\nmodalities ground the differences between the two principal spheres of\nbeing (real and ideal) and the two secondary spheres of being\n(knowledge and logic). Finally, The Construction of the Real\nWorld and Philosophy of Nature present in detail the many\ncategories within the real sphere of being. This entry specifically\ndeals with (some parts of) the third and the fourth volumes of\nHartmann’s ontological quadrilogy, making no more than passing\nmention of the first two volumes in the series. Since Possibility\nand Actuality will soon be available in English, we\nfocus here on sources that are likely to be unavailable in English for a\nsubstantial amount of time. Furthermore, towards the end of the entry,\nthere is a brief summary of Hartmann’s theory of values as\npresented in his Ethics and Aesthetics. This entry\ndoes not to discuss Hartmann’s historical works, such as his\ninnovative interpretation of Plato (Luchetti 2011), or his role in the\ndevelopment of German Philosophical Anthropology (Fischer 2011). \n\nSince Hartmann organized his bulky books into short chapters,\nsubdivided into sections usually no longer than one or two pages, we\nfollow his method of internal referencing by indicating the\nrelevant chapters and sections. The following abbreviations will be\nused: E = Grundzüge der Metaphysik der Erkenntnis; S =\n“Systematische Philosophie in eigener Darstellung”; ET2 =\nEthics. Vol 2. Moral Values; P = The Problem of Spiritual\nBeing; G = Zur Grundlegung der Ontologie; M =\nMöglichkeit und Wirklichkeit; A = Der Aufbau der\nrealen Welt; N = Philosophie der Natur; W = New Ways\nof Ontology; AE = Aesthetics. The chapters of\nIntroduction will be referred to as “Intro”.\nTherefore “N.Intro5” and “N.3c” will\nrespectively refer to Section 5 of the Introduction and Chapter 3,\nSection c of the Philosophy of Nature. \n\nThis section summarizes some aspects of the theoretical background\nto Hartmann’s analysis of ontological categories. \n\nAccording to Hartmann, an unbiased philosophical inquiry moves\nthrough the three main stages of phenomenological, aporetic and\ntheoretical development. The first stage is descriptive and requires\nthe systematic collection of all the available evidence relevant to\nwhatever is under scrutiny. More often than not, descriptions end up in\nconflicting theses, often in the form of aporias. More than anybody\nelse, Hartmann rehabilitates the value of aporias (for two recent\nevaluations of Hartmann’s aporetic method see Schlittmaier 2011\nand Rescher 2011). Aporias themselves are informative and should not be\nforced to disappear by fiat decisions, such as an a\npriori assumption on the overall consistency of reality or the\nassumption that we have a direct, transparent access to reality. The\nlast phase of the philosophical method consists in using as few\nmetaphysical assumptions as possible for the systematic coordination of\nthe outcomes from the first two phases (E, S). \n\nMetaphysical assumptions are necessary for the task of incorporating\naporias into a framework able to make sense of them. Since metaphysical\nassumptions are not directly supported by descriptive data, it is\nadvisable to keep them to a minimum, or to assume the weakest possible\nmetaphysical assumptions. \n\nAn original way of distinguishing between ontology and metaphysics\nunderlies the third stage of theoretical development. Ontology, for\nHartmann, deals with what can be subsumed under at least partially\nrepresentable categories (see Section 3 below). Two main consequences\nfollow from this view of ontology: firstly, ontology is primarily a\ntheory of categories, in the sense that all ontological distinctions\nhave the form of categories (A.Intro1), and secondly, science in all\nits branches is the most successful and powerful ally of ontology. More\nprecisely, for Hartmann science is ontological in all its ramifications\n(G.37a). This is rather at odds with the mainstream view of science as\nan eminently epistemological affair. This is one of the issues on which\nHartmann firmly departs from the Kantian—to be precise, the\nNeo-Kantian—legacy. The claim that the main orientation of\nscience is ontological immediately entails that scientific categories\nare further specifications and subdivisions of ontological categories.\nIn other words, the contact with science is a characteristic feature of\nthe theory of categories, and therefore of ontology (A.Intro1). The\nphilosopher’s task is to unfold the first and most general\narticulations of the theory of categories, while scientists deal with\ntheir subsequent further specifications. \n\nOntology is knowledge of being, and knowledge is an epistemological\nproblem. In order to clarify the connection between the epistemological\nproblem of categories and the ontological problem of categories,\nknowledge should be correctly defined. For Hartmann, the basic\nontological assumption concerning knowledge is that it does not create\nor generate its objects. Ontologically speaking, knowledge grasps\nobjects. If knowledge does not generate its objects, objects\nontologically precede any effort to grasp them. \n\nObjects are indifferent as to whether or not they are known. Whilst\nknowledge is relevant for the knower, it is of no importance for the\nobject itself. Knowledge uncovers aspects, brings to light dimensions\nand properties of objects. Knowledge introduces a divide between that\npart of the object which has been captured by knowledge and that part\nwhich remains to be known. The former is usually typified and then\nrepresented by concepts. The divide between the full ontological object\nand the part that has been apprehended shifts as knowledge\ndevelops. \n\nOntology is the theory of being qua being, which results in\nthe difference between Dasein and Sosein. These two\nterms can only imperfectly be translated as existence and\nbeing-thus (or determination). All entities—either\nreal or ideal—have Dasein and Sosein, albeit\nin different ways. For instance, real existence (i.e., the existence of\na real being) is a temporal determination, whilst ideal existence is\ncompossibility. \n\nThe difference between Dasein and Sosein—and\nevery other articulation that ontology is supposed to present—is\ncharacterized categorially. As a matter of fact, categories are the\nonly tools available to an ontologist. Ontology, therefore, is a\nthoroughgoing theory of categories. \n\nHartmann’s theory of categories entirely breaks with\nKant’s or Hegel’s theories of categories by explicitly\ndenying that categories are concepts. While we need concepts in order\nto refer to categories, concepts never capture categories entirely. \n\nCategories deal with what is universal and necessary (A.Intro12).\nCategories articulate in particular the Sosein of entities;\nthey specify configurations, structures and contents, not forms of\nexistence (A.Intro7). Categories specify the fundamental determinations\nof being; they are principles of being (on principles see Section 4.1\nbelow). As fundamental determinations of being, categories form the\ninterior of entities. In this sense, categories are immanent to the\nworld: they do not form a second world (A.16b). The categorial interior\nof entities has a layered organization: the most fundamental categories\nstructure the innermost core of entities, while other categories, such\nas scientific ones, add progressively more superficial layers.\nOntological categories are the lowest layer of being. They form the\nnetwork of internal, dynamic determinants and dependencies which\narticulate the furniture of the world. One of the most interesting\naspects of the theory of categories is that categories do not form a\nhomogeneous continuum, but appear to be organized in groups (A.intro15;\nsee below for details). Some categories belong to all the spheres of\nbeing, some to the entire real world, others to a specific level of\nreality. The first group of categories is analyzed in detail in\nPossibility and Actuality; the second group is analyzed\nin The Structure of the Real World, while the third group is\nanalyzed in the Philosophy of Nature. The categories of the\nfirst group are called ‘modal categories’, those of the\nsecond group ‘fundamental categories’, and those of the\nthird group ‘special categories’. Fundamental categories\ncomprise (1) categories organized in pairs of opposites, such as\nprinciple-concretum, mode-structure, and form-matter;\n(2) level categories, such as those that distinguish\ninanimate, living, psychological and spiritual beings; and (3) the\ncategories of intercategorial connections, or the group of\ncategorial laws, such as the laws of coherence,\nstratification, and dependence among categories (see Section 6\nbelow). \n\nWe come to know ontological categories through the objects that we\ncome to know. However, our knowledge of ontological categories is even\nmore provisional than our knowledge of objects. The difference between\nknowing objects and knowing categories explains why ontological\ncategories are often confused with concepts. The problem is that\ncategories do not allow direct acquaintance as objects do. Concepts are\nnames of ontological categories, which implies that concepts are\npartial, static, separate representations of items that in themselves\nare both essentially dynamic and inseparable from other ontological\ncategories. \n\nLike the knowledge of objects, the knowledge of ontological\ncategories also changes—when ontology develops, our\nunderstanding of ontological categories develops as well, so that we\ngain a deeper and better grasp of their articulation and subtleties.\nSome categories have countless variations, others only a few minor\nones. The most general and schematic categories are those with the most\nmeager content, and they are therefore those that change less\n(A.27b). \n\nThe two main aspects of categories are their generality and their\ncharacter of determination. The latter is the feature that makes them\nprinciples. Principles exhaust themselves in this determining role.\nPrinciples are nothing in themselves. They only exist for something\nelse; they are something only with respect to the concretum\nthat they determine and are in. Principles are nothing without\ntheir concretum, and the concretum cannot exist\nwithout its principles (A.1a; 6b; 16b; and elsewhere). \n\nThe ontological aspect of the categories consists in some kind of\ndetermination of their concreta. It is apparent that\nprinciples do not determine their concreta as causes, reasons,\nor ends. Apart from denying these patently inadequate\ncharacterizations, it is difficult to specify any positive feature of\nthe relation of determination, because it appears to be a sui\ngeneris relation. A positive unfolding of the moments\ncharacterizing the relation between principles and concreta is\na task still to be accomplished (A.5a). \n\nCategories as principles are independent from their\nconcreta, not from other categories (A.11c). We will see that\nprinciples imply one another, and that all the categories\ncharacterizing a level of reality work together (A.15c; see Section 6\nbelow). \n\nCategories are far from being the only principles of entities. There\nare also highly particular principles structuring specific domains of\nbeing—such as natural laws or psychological laws—which\nare concreta with respect to general categories (A.25f). There\nis a gradation of principles from the most general categories to\nspecific real cases. Empirical laws are concreta with respect\nto general principles, and they are principles with respect to\nindividual instances. \n\nPaired categories are the most general structural elements\nof being. As structural elements they have content, and there are\ncomposite relations among them (A.23b). Hartmann organizes the various\npairs into two groups of six pairs, without implying that the list of\npaired oppositions is definitive: \n\nNeither the two groups nor their internal order constitute a\nhierarchical order because there is no intrinsic order among the pairs\n(A.24a). It is apparent that some of these are easier to grasp than\nothers. Apart from the relations within each categorial pair, there are\nrelations among the members of a pair and those of others (A.26a). The\ncollection of these external relations is also a constitutive element\nof the categories, on a par with the relations internal to the\ndifferent pairs. Two cases are particularly relevant: the relation of\nthe different paired categories to their common concretum, and\nthe transverse relations among the contents of the different categories\n(A.26a). To provide a sample of Hartmann’s analysis, we now\nbriefly describe some of the pairs (for more details see Werkmeister\n1990, Poli 2011a). \n\nConcretum for Hartmann is what is determinate, that in\nwhich categories are embedded as their determinations. The\nconcretum is not limited to real entities, but includes ideal\nones as well. Furthermore, the concretum for Hartmann is not\nto be understood as limited to the individual instances of a principle\nbecause there can be different levels of concreta. For\ninstance, level categories are concreta with respect to\ngeneral categories. Both the concretum and its principles are\ncategories. \n\nReal categories contain all the universal determinations of their\nconcreta; they contain what is needed for the structure of the\nconcreta. A complete system of categories—not the\nincomplete one we are able to grasp—completely determines its\nconcreta (A.4a). As natural laws exist only in the real\nprocesses of nature and are nothing outside of them, so real categories\nexist only as structural relations within the real world and are\nnothing in themselves (A.16c). \n\nThe principle-concretum determination is only one among a\nvariety of types of determination, and in no way is it the most\nrelevant in the real world. In fact, each real level has its own\nspecific types of determination, such as the specific linear nexus\n(causal, final, etc.) that unifies the phases of the processes that\nunfold within a concretum. The following three moments\ncharacterize the essence of principles, and the three corresponding\nmoments the essences of concreta: \n\nModus determines intermodal relations and in particular the\nspecial form of Dasein; structure refers to the\nSosein and all the moments of its determination. All the\nremaining twenty-two oppositions are articulations of structure. Like\nthe most general relations, the relation between principle and\nconcretum is a structural relation (A.24b). \n\nAll entities are determined by relations, both internal and\nexternal. This is why every isolation is secondary and exclusively due\nto acts of abstraction. Without relations, there is neither unity nor\nmultiplicity; form and quality depend on relations (A.28a). While\nrelations can have other relations as their arguments, at some point\nthe series of relations within relations within relations etc., must\nend. Sooner or later, there must be a non-relational substratum, a\nsubstratum that is not the result of a relational construction (A.25c).\nA substratum, for Hartmann, is the argument of a possible relation. The\nterm ‘substratum’ implies that what is at stake is the\nsource or domain of an asymmetrical relation. Real categories are\nconstituted by material moments. Moments with the character of\nsubstratum do not pertain to the mode of being of ideal entities\n(A.4a). \n\nThe quality-quantity pair is one of those where the character of\nopposition between the two constituting categories is less apparent.\nHartmann sees quantities as determinations of real being and qualities\nas (within limits) determinations of the secondary sphere of knowledge\n(A.39a). Three pairs of oppositions are included under quality\n(positive and negative, general and individual, and identity and\ndifference) and three different pairs of oppositions are included under\nquantity (one and many, part and whole, and finite and infinite). \n\nComplexes are relational entities. (N.38c) explains that he prefers\nthe term ‘complex’ (Gefüge) to the\n‘outworn’ (verbrauchten) term ‘system’\n(System). The elements of a complex are its members, not\nsubstrata. Elements are determined by the complex of which they are\nmembers (A.25c). Complexes have their own type of determination; but in\neach case, the determination extends across the complex’s\nelements and transforms them. A complex of elements is always a complex\nof relations and determinations. Elements are essentially determined by\nthe positions they occupy within the complex’s total series of\nrelations (A.33a). This explains why elements have functions within the\ncomplex. Within a complex, what matters are not the elements, but the\nrelations that they maintain among themselves and with the complex. \n\nThe main difference between complex and class (Ganze; the\nterms ‘whole’ and ‘totality’ are used for other\nconcepts, see Poli 2011a) is that a complex has some autonomy\nvis-à-vis its members, while a class has no autonomy\nvis-à-vis its parts. Classes depend on their parts,\nwhile elements depend on their complex. The two dependence relations\nproceed in opposite directions. This is not entirely correct, however.\nTo some extent, a complex depends on its elements as well. A better\nformulation of the difference between classes and complexes runs as\nfollows: within limits, if a class loses one of its parts, the class\nbecomes different but the lost part remains the same; if a complex\nloses one of its elements, the complex remains the same but the element\nbecomes different (A.33a). \n\nAn irregularly shaped stone, a grain of sand, a puddle, a mountain\nare not independent complexes, but fragments and parts of much wider\nformations that come into existence before them and within which they\nexist as subordinate moments (A.33c). \n\nAll natural complexes are complexes of forces and processes. There is\nno reason to view their elements as simple or as analogous to material\nparticles. If we assume that inorganic parts are elements of an\norganism, this way of understanding an organism is radically different\nfrom the idea that an organism is a dynamic complex able to survive\nthe continuous substitution of its elements (A.33d). The former idea\nrefers to a physical complex, while the latter refers to a biological\ncomplex, and the two are authentically different complexes.  The\ninside of the complex of processes that constitutes an organism is the\ncapacity of the complex to maintain its working conditions—what\nHartmann calls the self-determination of the organism (A.34c). \n\nNot everything has an inside, and not everything is what results\nfrom its inner structure. Force does not need to be the exteriorization\nof anything else, and effects do not need to be the exteriorizations of\ncauses. Only entities that have some ontic autonomy have an inside. In\nnature, dynamic and organic complexes are the best-known cases. Outer\nforces of lower-order entities are inner forces of higher-order\nentities: for instance, outer forces of nuclei are inner forces of\natoms (A.34b). Determinations do not need to be internal to things (or\nto constitute their interiors). Most real nexuses are external\ndeterminations. Causality is the most obvious case (A.24e). \n\nFor all complexes, the inside of the complex is constituted by the\nrelations among its members, while the outside of the complex is\nconstituted by the relations between the complex and other complexes.\nEvery outside can become the inside of a higher-order complex\n(A.25d). \n\nWe now turn from the many intricacies of paired categories to a patter\nwe extract that governs the behavior of most pairs.  We refer to this\nas the ‘positional aspect’ of paired categories.\n‘Positional’ refers to the fact that the two categories\ncomposing a pair alternate with each other. It follows that some\naspects of the content of each category depend on the position that the\nlatter occupies with reference to its twin category. The simplest case\nis the matter-form opposition. The guiding idea is that every form is\nthe form of some underlying matter, and it is the matter of some higher\nform; similarly all matter is the matter of some higher form and the\nform of some underlying matter (see Figure 1 below). This alternation\nexemplifies the sense in which matter and form are\npositional categories. Furthermore, matter and form enter into two\ndifferent ties: horizontally, matter and form are moments of an\nindividual being; vertically, matter and form connect different\nindividuals (as parts and wholes or members and collectives). Hartmann\ngeneralizes this pattern and detects the occurrence of similar\nalternations for other paired categories as well. Let us consider\nDasein and Sosein, which, as already said, can be\napproximately understood as existence and determination. Here is how\nHartmann presents their positional alternation: The Dasein of\na tree is the Sosein of a forest (G.19a); without the tree the\nforest would be different. Similarly, the Dasein of the branch\nis the Sosein of the tree. The Dasein of the leaf is\nthe Sosein of the branch. The Dasein of the vein is\nthe Sosein of the leaf. Things can be inverted, too: the\nSosein of the leaf is the Dasein of the vein; the\nSosein of the branch is the Dasein of the leaf,\netc. \n\nThe fact that only a part of the Sosein of an entity\nX contributes to the Dasein of a different entity\nY does not raise problems. The Dasein-Sosein\nseries has two limits: towards the first, original Dasein and\ntowards the last Sosein, the Sosein of the whole of\nreality. \n\nThe mainstream interpretation of Dasein and Sosein\nas entirely separate aspects of being depends on epistemological acts\nof isolation. Only when moments are separated do independent substances\nand dependent qualities appear, and it is for this reason that it seems\nthat qualities do not have any Dasein and, \ncomplementarily, that their bearers have no Sosein\n(G.20c). Figure 1. \n\nThe main difference between matter and form, on the one hand, and\nDasein and Sosein on the other, is that the latter\npair runs homogeneously through the whole of reality, while the\nmatter-form stratification does not run homogeneously from the bottom\nto the highest layers of reality. Matter and form are always relative\nto a substrate, and the matter-form stratification stops when a new\nsubstratum appears (the section on levels of reality will explain why\nthis is so). \n\nThe next group after that of paired categories is the group of the\ncategories of levels of reality. Like everything else, levels of\nreality are characterized (and therefore distinguished) by their\ncategories. By definition, the categories characterizing levels of\nreality are not general, in the sense that they do not pertain to\nreality in its entirety, but only to specific families of real being.\nOn the other hand, fundamental categories are the most general and\nsimple categories, and for this reason they are contained in the\nspecial categories of levels of reality (A.21b). Levels are the true\nconstructive framework of the real world. Whilst the latter has unity,\nits unity is the unity of neither a principle nor a center. The unity\nof the real world is instead provided by the order of the levels of\nreality (A.52a). \n\nFour main levels of reality are distinguished by Hartmann: the\ninanimate, the biological, the psychological and the spiritual. This\nlast includes all historical realities (history, language, customs,\nlaw, art, etc.). The underlying intuition is as follows: whilst the\nstructure and the laws of history and other spiritual processes are\ndifferent from the structure and laws of, say, inanimate beings, the\nformer are not in any way less real than the latter (A.20a). The same\nintuition applies to the other levels as well: biological and\npsychological processes are as real as any other process, and they have\ntheir own specific groups of categories. \n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of Hartmann’s theory of\nlevels of reality is the question of what kinds of relation connect the\nlevels to each other. From a categorial point of view, however, the\nproblem of what relations connect levels can be easily solved. Leaving\ngeneral categories aside, two main categorial situations can be\ndistinguished: (a) Being A and B are categorially different because the\ncategories upon which the former is founded are partially different\nfrom the categories upon which the latter is founded, in the sense that\nthe latter is founded on new categories (which implies that the latter\nincludes at least a novum, a new category not present in the\nformer); (b) Being A and B are categorially different because the\ncategories upon which the former is founded and those upon which the\nlatter is founded form two entirely different (disjoint) groups of\ncategories. Following Hartmann, the two relations can be termed\nrespectively relations of super-formation (Überformung)\nand super-position (Überbauung) (A.51f). \n\nSuper-formation (the type (a) form of dependence) is weaker than\nsuper-position because it is partly grounded on already actualized\ncategories, those of the level below. Suffice it to consider the\nsuper-formation between molecules and cells, i.e., between the physical\nand the biological levels of reality. In this regard, one can mention\nthat even if organisms are unquestionably more complex than mechanisms,\nthe behavior of organisms is in conformity with laws of mechanics\n(A.51b). \n\nOn the other hand, the psychological and spiritual levels are\ndifferent, because they are characterized by an interruption in the\ncategorial series and by the onset of new categorial series (relative\nrespectively to the psychological and spiritual levels). The relations\nbetween the biological level and the psychological level, on the one\nhand, and the relation between the psychological level and the\nspiritual one, on the other, are both relations of super-position. By\nway of example, the group of categories embedded in psychological\nentities is different from the group of categories embedded in\nbiological entities. Similarly, the group of categories embedded in\nspiritual entities is different from the group of categories embedded\nin psychological entities. \n\nThe category of the spirit is divided into personal, objective and\nobjectivated spirit. Personal spirit is the spirit of the individual;\nobjective spirit is the living spirit of communities; and objectivated\nspirit characterizes the products of spirit. The categorial moments of\npersonal spirit are consciousness, will, foresight and teleological\nactivity, liberty. None of them pass to objective spirit. There is no\nconsciousness apart from individual consciousness, and the same applies\nto the other moments. \n\nThere are laws that are valid for all the levels: higher levels rest\non lower ones; the lower level is the conditioning one; the higher\nlevel is independent from the lower one as to its conformation and its\nlaws. \n\nWhen the connecting relation is a relation of super-formation, some\ncategories of the lower level return in the higher one. Returning\ncategories interact with the categories of the higher level and are, so\nto speak, contaminated by them; some of their moments become different.\nHigher levels are never characterized by returning categories. \n\nEach level has its novum, the category or group of\ncategories that distinguish the level from the lower ones. The\nnovum does not derive either from the elements of the level or\nfrom their synthesis (A.53c). \n\nEach of the four levels of the world contains other levels,\norganized according to a variety of patterns. The sublevels of the main\nlevels may present their own types of gradation and may work one next\nto the other or one above the other as the case may be. As soon as we\npass from the four levels to their internal divisions, things become\nmore complex. The nexuses of determination working within the\nintermediate sub-levels are even less well known than those working for\nthe levels. From a categorial point of view, the differences among them\nmay not be as rigorous and clear as the difference distinguishing the\nfour main levels of real being (A.20e). \n\nTwo aspects characterize super-position relations: firstly, the\ncategories embedded in the entities of the connected levels are\nentirely different; secondly, a relation of existential dependence\nlinks the higher level to the lower one. This latter aspect organizes\nthe order of the levels, so that the spiritual level is founded on the\npsychological level, which in its turn is founded on the biological\none. Conversely, the biological level is the bearer of the\npsychological level and the latter is the bearer of the spiritual\nlevel. \n\nNot all the levels are equally well-known. Indeed, for most of the\nlevels we know only some of their elements, possibly not the most\nimportant ones. In fact, we do not know the central categories of the\nbiological level (A.51c); the same applies to the psychological and the\nspiritual levels. This lack of knowledge has dramatic consequences on\nour capacity correctly to grasp the concreta of the higher\nlevels. To see what this means, consider the case of physical\nconcreta, those that we know best. \n\nThe group that includes time, space, process, causality and\nsubstance, together with the effects that they mutually exert on each\nother, determines physical entities. A physical concretum\ncannot be temporal without being spatial, nor can it present any of the\nother determinations without being a process. A process cannot exist\nwithout a substantial basis, and space and time are impossible without\nprocess. Again, none of them can exist without being causally\nconditioned. All the determinations that pertain to a level work\ntogether, and together they constrain the concreta of the\nlevel (A.46b). Nothing like this can be repeated for any of the other\nlevels. \n\nThe categories of higher levels have nothing to do with the\nconcreta of lower levels; the categories of lower levels are\nnot principles of the categories of higher levels (A.56c). Lower levels\nare the bases of higher levels, but the categorial essence of the\nformer does not consist in their being the basis of the latter (A.57a).\nLower levels are stronger, their laws cannot be modified by the laws of\nthe higher levels (A.56b). Higher levels have richer structure and\ncontents. While higher concreta cannot modify the laws of\nlower ones, they can use them for their own purposes. Human beings are\nthe most vulnerable entities, the most conditioned and dependent; but\nthey have knowledge, they can consciously adapt, and they can use other\nentities for their own purposes (A.56b; d; 60a). This means that causal\nprocesses can be modified, which in turn implies that categorial\nstructures can accept extra-causal determinations. We will say that\ncategorial nexuses can be super-formed (A.60f). \n\nHartmann acknowledges that the distinction between the psychological\nand the spiritual levels is problematic (Scognamiglio 2011). However,\nit appears that science provides some help here, especially with the\ndistinction between the objects of psychology and the objects of the\nsciences of the spirit (linguistics, law, social and historical\nsciences). If we look at present-day sciences, the situation appears\neven clearer than in Hartmann’s time. Hartmann’s position,\nhowever, in this case is far from being crystal-clear. Two obvious\nproblems arise from his analyses. Firstly, Hartmann accepts only\npsychological acts and does not consider the possibility of social\nacts. Furthermore, he maintains that contents as correlates of acts are\nalways spiritual. “Psychological” contents form personal\nbeing; “social” contents form objective being. \n\nHartmann vacillates as to the delimitations of what is properly\npsychological. He assigns language, consciousness, and foresight\nalternatively to the psychological level or to the personal level of\nthe spirit. He even claims that the same acts of consciousness pertain\nto both psychic and spiritual being and that only an exact\nclarification of the phenomenon of acts may solve the aporia.\nTwo developments never considered by Hartmann are (1) the distinction\nbetween individual and collective forms of intentionality, and (2) a\nprincipled distinction between the complexes that are individual human\nbeings and the complexes that are collectivities.  \n\nHartmann specifies analytically the laws that govern the various\nlevels of reality and their connection (for a short introduction see W;\nfor a summary of the laws, see Poli 2011a). \n\nThe fourth volume of Hartmann’s quadrilogy, Philosophy of\nNature, analytically presents the categories characterizing the\ntwo basic levels of reality (the inanimate and the animate). Today we\nwould say that this is more a book of philosophy of science than\nontology (it should be remembered, however, that for Hartmann science\nis ontological in all its ramifications, see the Introduction above).\nIn the words of Hartmann, “philosophy of nature is not a\nmetaphysics,” in the sense that “the problems of the\nphilosophy of nature cannot be addressed without contact with the\nresults of natural science” (N.Prologue). What is even more\ninteresting is that the ontological theory of categories makes explicit\nthe limitations of the scientific understanding of reality for at least\ntwo different reasons: firstly, because categories such as those of\nspace and time are not limited to physics alone (N.Prologue); secondly,\nbecause at least some of the categories that apply to the lowest level\nof the real world—such as space and time—share the\ncategorial moment of dimensionality, the categorial precondition for\nmeasurement. In fact, dimensionality—and its subsequent\nmeasurement—is the condition that makes natural science\npossible. To further indicate the difference between the scientific and\nthe philosophical understanding of reality, Hartmann adds that\n“mathematical physics deals with reality qua measurable, not with\nreality as such” (N 24). \n\nThe categories of the lower stratum of real being are called\ncosmological categories. We have already seen that the group including\ntime, space, process, causality and substance (together with the\neffects that they mutually exert on each other) determines physical\nentities. To give the reader an idea of Hartmann’s analysis of\ncosmological categories, we summarize his treatment of space,\nleaving aside the other cosmological categories. As a category, space\npresents the general features characterizing every other ontological\ncategory: to wit, it is a principle. As a principle, it does not exist.\nIt is therefore mandatory to distinguish the category of space from the\nentities that are characterized by space as (one of) their\nprecondition. As a category, space does not have any kind of existence\nindependently of the things and processes of which space is a real\ndimension (N.1c; 7d, 11b and elsewhere). Existence is a determination\nthat applies to things, substances, or living beings. It is things in\nspace that exist, not space itself (N.6a). If real space were to exist,\nit would exist as a thing together with other things. Space is (one of)\nthe general principles of things and other existing entities. Only what\nis extended in space exists spatially (N.4a). To repeat, space is not a\n‘thing’ (entity, object, process), but a principle. \n\nIn order to demonstrate the difference between a principle and its\ninstances, Hartmann introduces the distinction between space and\nspatiality. While ‘space’ is the name of the category with\nthe same name, ‘spatiality’ is the name of the basic\ndetermination of the entities that are in space. Things have\nspatiality and are in space, they do not have space (N.7a,\nN.12a). \n\nThe underlying idea is that space as a category is not a property of\nthings, whilst spatiality is indeed a property of things. Real space is\na categorial precondition of things. The claim that space categorially\ndepends on things, masses, or forces is false. If anything, things,\nmasses and forces categorially depend on space. \n\nAs already said, Hartmann sharply distinguishes the category of\nspace from what is in space. The moments characterizing space\nare different from the determinations of the entities that are in\nspace. The attribution to space of determinations that pertain\nexclusively to what may eventually be in space is a serious\ncategory error. \n\nWhereas things are extended in space, space in itself is neither\nextended nor has extension. Space is the medium in which what is\nextended extends itself (N.4a). For instance, position, distance,\nmovement, length, width, and height are spatial determinations. They\nare in space, but space itself has no position, distance, movement,\nlength, width or height (N.4a). It is not space that is extended;\nrather, distances are extended in space (N.4c). Extension is not a\ndetermination of a dimension, but a determination of the entity that is\nextended in a given dimension. For space, only what is extended is\nproperly real (N.12d). \n\nOne further issue concerning space should be mentioned, namely the\nquestion of the curvature of the dimensions of space. What is the\nessential nature of a curvature? Not dissimilarly from either Brentano\nor Whitehead, Hartmann answers that the essence of a curvature is the\ncollection of dimensions “in which” the curvature bends. If\nspace dimensions bend, there must be other dimensions in which the\nformer dimensions bend. Mathematically speaking, however, things can be\ndifferent. From a mathematical point of view, one can introduce a\nmeasure of curvature without resorting to other, underlying dimensions.\nThe internal consistency of mathematical formulas is sufficient for\nmathematics. Ontology requires more (N.5b). \n\nThe problem lies deeper than the difference between Euclidean as\nopposed to non-Euclidean spaces. In fact, the very distinction between\nstraight and curved is secondary and can itself exist only within a\ndimensional framework. The real ontological issue is that dimensions\nthemselves are neither straight nor curved. Even more generally,\ndimensions do not have spatial determinations. Dimensions, if anything,\nare the categorial preconditions of all possible spatial\ndeterminations. In this sense, dimensions are the lowest substrates of\nall extensions and measures. In themselves, dimensions are neither\nmeasures nor measurable, neither extensions nor extended (N.5b). \n\nThree articulations of the category ‘space’ are needed.\nWe shall distinguish among ‘real space’, ‘ideal\nspace’ (the space of geometry), and ‘intuitive space’\n(the space of perceptions and cognitions). Real space is different from\nboth the multiplicity of ideal spaces and from intuitive space. Two\ndifferent criteria of distinction are at work here: (1) the difference\nbetween real and ideal space follows the deeper distinction between the\nspheres of real and ideal being; (2) the distinction between real and\nintuitive spaces lies entirely within the sphere of real being and\nconcerns lower as opposed to higher strata of reality, in the sense\nthat real space primarily categorizes the inanimate level of reality\nand intuitive space categorizes (aspects of) the psychological level of\nreality. This immediately raises the question of whether other regions\nof real space should be distinguished, such as biological and spiritual\n(e.g., historical) spaces. \n\nThe simplest way to analyze the analogies and differences among the\nthree just-mentioned spaces is to proceed in the following order: ideal\nspace → real space → intuitive space. \n\nA general thesis propounded by Hartmann is that ideal being is\nincomplete being, and for this reason it is more general than real\nbeing (G.38; A.31a). It immediately follows from this thesis that ideal\nspace is more general than real space (N.6b). It is therefore\nconvenient to start by presenting the main features of ideal space, and\nonly subsequently analyze the features of real and intuitive\nspaces. \n\nThe following are the main properties of ideal space (N.5d): \nThe first point above is the only one directly referring to\ndimensions. The following aspects clarify the nature of dimensions\n(N.5e): Point 2 above hints at a possible shortcoming in Hartmann’s theory,\nin the sense that isometry is a rather strong constraint and surely\nnot all mathematical spaces are isometric. Furthermore, while real and\nintuitive spaces may indeed be unique, the ideal declination of space\nis surely plural. Furthermore, we will see that the claim at point 4\nis not valid for intuitive space, which does indeed have both\nprivileged points and directions. \n\nThe most important outcome of the analysis of ideal space is\npossibly the explicit difference between dimensions and coordinates.\nCoordinates form a system of fundamental lines in space that enable the\ndetermination of the position of points and other spatial entities. In\nthis sense, coordinates organize spatiality. Dimensions instead are\ninternal constraints of space, for they are constitutive categorial\nmoments of space. Distances refer only to coordinates, not to\ndimensions. \n\nAs already anticipated, some of the features of ideal space pertain\nto real space as well. The following are the most relevant (N.5f).\nGeometry has been often construed in stages in which lines result from\nthe movement of points; surfaces from the movement of lines; and\nvolumes from the movement of surfaces. Further iterations evade our\ncapacity for visualization. While this dynamic image of the iteration\nof movements one over the other is acceptable, it is far from being\nacceptable as a description of the categorial genesis of space because\nit does not respect the internal dependences of space as a category.\nThe real issue is that it is wrong to assume that points precede lines,\nor lines surfaces, etc. Categorially speaking, what comes first is the\nentire system of dimensions. Consequently, what come first are the\nmoments that present the same number of dimensions as the whole\ndimensional system. For a three-dimensional space, volumes are\ncategorially first. They are the reference entities. Volumes have\nposition in space, surfaces have positions in volumes, lines in\nsurfaces, and points in lines. One can obviously abstract from these\ncategorial dependences and see surfaces, lines and points as directly\npositioned in space. In so doing, however, it is space as a whole that\nis implicitly assumed to be an overall body, which is another\ncategorial error. For both ideal and real (three-dimensional) space,\nthe correct categorial dependence is therefore volume → surface\n→ line → point. We shall call this question the problem of\nextension. In short, the problem of extension claims that\nn-dim extended entities categorically precede n−1-dim\nextended entities. \n\nDirection is the second categorial moment of space. Everything\nextended in space can extend in different directions. Here\nBrentano’s concept of plerosis may help. According to\nBrentano, a point within a body can move in every direction while\nremaining within the body. It is therefore said that the point has full\nplerosis. On the other hand, a point of the boundary of a body presents\nonly a partial plerosis (Brentano 1981; for a reconstruction of\nBrentano’s theory of categories see Poli 2004; for a general\nreconstruction of Brentano’s philosophy see Albertazzi 2005). \n\nThirdly, the infinity of directions implies a continuous transition\nfrom one dimension to the next. One may call this rotation. Extension\nand direction are characterized by mutually irreducible types of\nmagnitude and subsequent measurement. Measuring angles is different\nfrom measuring lengths. To this difference corresponds the presence in\nspace of two different types of partial identity, namely identity and\nsimilarity of figures, or identity of shape vs. identity of angles. The\nformer case concerns the identity of both shape and angles, while the\nlatter concerns the identity of angles only. \n\nFinally, while lengths have arbitrary units of measurement, angles\nhave a natural unit of measurement. The change of direction in space\nhas its natural basis of measurement: while the subdivisions into\nquadrants and the internal subdivision of a quadrant may be arbitrary,\nthe basis provided by the full circle is fixed. \n\nThe ontological nature of points requires some attention. Two\ndeterminations are needed for something to be spatially real: being\nin space and being extended in space. Points are in\nspace, but they are not extended in space. Therefore, since geometrical\npoints are not extended in space, they fail to be ‘real’\nspatial entities. Things are more intriguing than they appear, however.\nRecent mathematical developments show that the old idea of\ninfinitesimals still has a role to play. In fact, synthetic\ndifferential geometry, also known as smooth analysis, shows that points\ndefined as nilpotent entities respect the two categorial determinations\nmentioned above. A nilpotent entity x is an entity that is\nsomething (i.e. x ≠ 0) but such that all its powers are 0\n(i.e., xn = 0, for all n > 1) (for\na philosophically informed introduction to smooth analysis see Bell\n1998). \n\nHartmann also notes that the claim according to which quantum\nmechanics implies that quantum processes are discontinuous confuses\nspace with energy. Since the categories of space and energy are\ndifferent, the problem of spatial quanta does not arise. Furthermore,\nthe cosmos should not be confused with cosmic space. Space neither\naugments nor diminishes. Here Hartman treats physicists rather harshly,\nclaiming that “physics has the guilt for all these incoherencies,\nbecause it ignores the fundamental categorial relations”\n(N.6d). \n\nReal space has no magnitude, neither finite nor infinite (N.6e). If\nspace were extension, it would either be finite or infinite. But space\nis not extension. If anything, it is the system of dimensions “in\nwhich” something has extension. It is not space that is extended;\nbodies, masses, distances and fields of force are extended, not space.\nSimilarly, space has no magnitude; only what is in space has magnitude\n(N.6e). \n\nMost of these discussions—whether space is finite or infinite,\nwhether it is or it is not void, whether its dimensions are straight\nor curved, whether there are minimal spatial units—almost\ninvariably result in serious categorial errors because space is\nusually imagined as if it were a spatial thing (N.6e, note). \n\nAs far as ideal space is concerned, there is no need to think that\nthe various spatial formations are in different parts of space:\ngeometrical bodies penetrate one another without resistance. Real\nbodies, though, cannot penetrate one another. This is, however, a law\nof matter, not a law of space. Impenetrability may be a property of\nwhat is extended in space, not of the system of dimensions that\nconstitute space. This does not imply that real space has the character\nof Newtonian space. Real space is not determined by what is in space.\nReal space determines only the species of what is singularly spatial,\nnot the ontological moment of singularity (N.7c). \n\nFinally, space is not the union of what is in space. Behind this\nissue there lies the idea of viewing space as if it were time,\ninterpreting spatial coexistence as contemporaneity. This is inexact\nbecause space is neither the being outside one another nor the union of\nthe entities that are in space; space is their shared dimensional\ncondition (N.5g). \n\nThe following moments specify the main aspects of the dimensions of\nreal space (N.6g): \nSo far we have dealt with preliminary, descriptive, clarifications.\nWe shall now address the basic problem of space as a category. The\nfollowing are the basic moments of real space (N.6d): Furthermore, the following are the main properties of being\ndetermined in space (N.7c): \nMovement in real space follows the same criteria. If space were a\nsystem of coordinates, movement would be absolute. A few\n‘simple’ relativity issues ensue from the categorial nature\nof space (N.7d): \nBy way of a summary, real space is a condition of movement, but not\na determination of movement as to either its direction or velocity. \n\nBesides the categorial errors already seen in regard to ideal and\nreal spaces, the understanding of intuitive space suffers from further\nerrors of this kind. The first major issue to be addressed is the\ntension between the non-spatial nature of consciousness and the\npossibility itself of intuitive space. Intuitive space is a space of\nconsciousness, which in itself is a non spatial entity (N.7f; 8b).\nMental imagery is not spatial, but space is in the images of mental\nimagery. While contemporary cognitive science knows the problem well\n(Tym 1990), Hartmann’s capacity clearly to see the problem long\nbefore the birth of cognitive science is remarkable. His analysis of\nthe problem follows the same basic categorical distinctions that we\nhave already seen: properly speaking, what is intuitive is not space\nbut rather the objects in it. Intuitive space is the form of contents,\nthe way in which external objects are presented to the mind (N.8a).\nContents are intuitive, not (real) objects. Furthermore, space as a\nform of intuition has many variations connected to the variations of\nthe knowing consciousness. It follows that intuitive space is not a\nkind of real space, but a category of the contents of consciousness\n(N.8d). The following summary lists the most important aspects shared\nby real and intuitive space (N.9a). \nToday, the claim that intuitive space is “unequivocally\nEuclidean” (repeated in N.5b) is much less clear than it was at\nthe time when Hartmann wrote Philosophy of Nature. Very recent\nexperimental results raise doubts about the Euclidean characterization\nof intuitive space, at least as far as visual space is concerned; see\nKoenderink et al. 2010 for details. \n\nThe following are the main differences between real and intuitive\nspace: \nFurthermore (9e): \n\nThe thesis has frequently been propounded that there are different\ntypes of space: the space of physical forces, the vital space of\norganisms, and the space of historical events (N.3d). Here Hartmann\ndenounces the occurrence of a major ontological error. \n\nIn fact, for Hartmann the above-mentioned spaces are not different\nspecies of the genus space but domains\ninternal to the unique real space. The source of the error is the\nattribution to space of properties that characterize spatial entities.\nIt is the entities that are physical, biological, or social, not space\nthat is separated into different subspecies (N.3d). Levels of reality\nhave their own categories, and a general category, within the various\nlevels, interacts with different groups of level categories (Poli\n2011a). This applies to space as well (N.7e). However, it should be\nborne in mind that the source of the variation lies primarily in the\nconcreta. The variation is first of all a variation of\nspatiality, not of space itself. Real space—with all its\nfundamental categorial moments—remains the same. \n\nThe case of the space of concepts is different from the other\nmentioned subdomains of space because conceptual spaces pertain to\nintuitive space, which is not a subdomain of real space (N.3d).\nRelevant in the case of intuitive space are not the dimensions of\nthings, but the dimensions of representations of things. \n\nThere are many real moments without corresponding ideal moments. The\nmost obvious case is represented by causality. If causality were\nnothing more than a law, it would be entirely legitimate to view the\nlaw of causality as an essence and therefore as an ideal entity.\nAccording to Hartmann, however, causality is the nexus that connects\nthe phases of a process, the dynamic series of the production of the\nstages one from the other within the unity and the irreversibility of\nthe process. Whatever kinds of determination and dependence are valid\nfor ideal entities, causality is not one of them (A.4b). \n\nThe real sphere contains two different types of determinations: the\nhierarchical type of determination—the genus-species\nstructure—is shared with the ideal sphere, while the horizontal\ntype of determination connects individuals with individuals and in\nparticular the successive stages of real processes one to another. All\nthe moments resulting from the hierarchical nature of\ncategories—including their moments having the character of\nsubstratum and all the dimensional moments—will never exhaust\nthe fullness of an individual being. A second series of moments is\nneeded: the\nhorizontal series articulating the totality of the actual\nreality (A.31b). This implies that the principle-concretum\ntype of determination is far from being the only determination shaping\nthe whole of reality; a second type of determination—of a\nnon-categorial nature—should be included: a determination of\nthe concretum-concretum type (A.6b, 44c). The ideal\nsphere does not contain the latter type of determination. \n\nThe various causal chains do not unfold as isolated and mutually\nirrelevant processes. On the contrary, they influence each other in the\ntotality of the transversal nexus that connects them. \n\nSubstance is another case of a real determination without\ncorresponding ideal moments. Hartmann views substance as that which\nremains constant through changes, what in the flow of events resists\ntheir succession. It follows that only in the real world can there be\nsubstances. Even more importantly, the category of substance\npresupposes time and the dynamic flow of events. Again, ideal being\ndoes not contain any of this. In short, temporality is what radically\ndistinguishes real categories from ideal categories. The interplay of\nchange and persistence, causing and being caused by, exists only within\nthe flow of time. \n\nApart from time, individuality is the second moment distinguishing\nreal being from ideal being. Everything ideal is general, and\neverything real is individual. The latter must be assumed in the most\nrigorous sense: everything real is unique and it exists only once.\nThere are things that we are unable to discern. We may not be able to\ndistinguish one real entity from the next, but it would be an error to\ntake the limitations of our perceptual and cognitive capacities as if\nthey were universal laws of the sphere of real being. \n\nThe general in reality is real only “in” individuals\n(A.37e). While the general is a dominant category in the ideal sphere\nand a subordinate category in the sphere of the real, individuality is\na category of the sphere of real being only. In the realm of essences\nthere is no individual. \n\nHartmann’s ethics includes both a general theory of values and a\npenetrating description of the experience of values. Below, we\nsummarize some of the basic aspects of Hartmann’s ethical theories,\nnamely (1) the use of ontology as a device for understanding values;\n(2) the two-dimensional structure of values; (3) values as demand; and\n(4) the structural articulation of character. The recent Kelly 2011a,b\nand Kinneging 2011 discuss further aspects of Hartmann ethics. \n\nValues, for Hartmann, are ideal entities. Given the thesis that\nthere are at least two main types of ideal entities, namely\nmathematical entities and values, the question arises: what else, apart\nfrom atemporality, is shared by the entities included in the sphere of\nideal being. In fact, it does not seem at first sight that sets and\nvalues have much in common, apart from their both being atemporal\nentities. On closer inspection, however, something further emerges.\nHartmann consider the following three general features. \n\nValues belong to different families, and not just in the sense that,\nsay, aesthetic values are different from ethical values. A number of\nfurther subdivisions can be made within each family. \n\nAs to the organizing principles of values, two of them seem of\nespecial importance: that of strength and that of height. The strength\nof a value indicates the gravity of its violation. The height of a\nvalue expresses the merit deriving from its fulfillment. These two\nprinciples operate in opposite directions: the strongest values are\nalso the lowest values, whilst the highest values are the least strong\nones. Usually, lower values are simpler (that is, they possess less\nintuitable content) while higher values are more complex. \n\nThe laws of strength and height have significant consequences, the\ntwo most important of which are the following: In Hartmann’s words, “Sinning against lower values is\nignominious, shameful, revolting, but their fulfillment only reaches\nthe level of decency, without rising above it. Offending against higher\nvalues, by contrast, does indeed have the character of moral failure,\nbut nothing of the directly degrading, while fulfillment of these\nvalues may have something uplifting, liberating, indeed thrilling about\nit” (ET2.28e). By way of example: “heroism warrants\nadmiration, but a lack of heroism arouses neither contempt nor\nindignation”. On the other hand, whilst trustworthiness warrants\nrespect, “a lack of trustworthiness warrants contempt or even\nindignation” (ET2.63d). \n\nOffending against life is a grave offence, whilst respecting it has\nvery little merit. But the fulfillment of spiritual goods is a merit\nmuch greater than the merit corresponding to respect for more\nelementary goods. Those who violate lower goods are wicked; but the\nreverse does not hold: a person who violates higher goods, someone who\nfails to fulfill them, “is not on that account a bad man; his\nconduct threatens no one; it merely lacks the higher moral\ncontent” (ET.63f). \n\nIt is also well known from basic moral experience that respect for\nmore elementary goods is often the condition for acceding to higher\ngoods. \n\nStructuring by levels is important, not only because it furnishes us\nwith the tectonic laws governing values, but also because it provides\nus with criteria with which to distinguish, at least in some cases,\nauthentic values from bogus ones. If the architecture of values is\nbased on levels of dependence, then the authentic elevation of value is\nalso divided into levels; it develops through intrinsic stages from the\nlower values to the higher ones. Although the situation may still lack\nfull theoretical analysis, it is well known in practice. A person whose\nbehavior is oriented to a higher value, but who does not simultaneously\nrespect the values that support it, is structurally discordant. The\nhigher values to which s/he refers are not credible. Loving with\ndistrust or giving with cowardice are not authentically virtuous\nbehaviours (ET2.63f). Values are constructed step by step from the most\nelementary levels upwards. \n\nValues as ideal entities do not change. What may change is our\naccess to values. The individual capacity to “see” values\nchanges with age and axiological maturity. Groups and communities\nchange by following different guiding values. This latter case shows\nhow historical and social conditions are at work in shaping the\nterritory of accessible values. \n\nThe interplay between individuals and the groups to which they\nbelong finds moments of stability in the mutually adjusted selection of\nshared values. This is one of the reasons why the firmament of values\n“cannot be peopled by passing meteors, whose place and brightness\nchanges rapidly: its contents must be constant, and must have\nregistered themselves slowly on an exposed sensitive\nplate” (Findlay, 1961, p. 209). \n\nRepeated acts of valuation tend to produce stable or fixed orders of\nindividual and social preferences, whose guiding values press to be\nrealized. These values have the ontological nature of demands. They do\nnot work as laws of reality, which in fact comprises both values and\ndisvalues. The demands made by values work in a twofold manner\naccording to the already mentioned laws of the strength and height of\nvalues. New visions and corresponding behaviors can be and usually are\nrejected, or they may occasionally be accepted and contribute to\nbehaviors shaped by different values. \n\nA more developed understanding of values may require consideration\nof further laws besides those of the strength and height of values. We\nfind higher forms of value difficult to achieve. They resist our\nefforts. As far as values are concerned, Christianity’s most\nimportant result has possibly been the discovery that the path to the\nhighest values entails frustration and pain. \n\nProviding that this understanding of values is correct, the\nconsequences that derive from it are of the utmost importance. If the\npath to the highest values does indeed entail frustration and pain,\nthis means that the empirical realization of higher values is flanked\nby disvalues as one of its structural features. \n\nThe possible presence of disvalues embedded in the empirical\nrealization of values (at least of the highest ones) immediately\nrequires specification of the correct proportion between values and\nimplied disvalues. By way of example, there is neither merit nor\njustification in risking one’s life to rescue a lady’s\npocket-handkerchief (the example is Meinong’s). More seriously,\nfor each value, the proportion between values and implied disvalues\nconstrains the degree of disvalue that can be accepted as correct.\nThere are cases in which “it is more meritorious to realize a\nlower value at a given level of difficulty … than to realize a\nhigher one” (Findlay, 1961, p. 381). \n\nIt is widely agreed that values are accessed through emotional or\negological acts. These are structured in levels of depths, ranging from\nacts conveying more superficial information to ones conveying more\nintimate information. Phenomenologists distinguish three different\nlevels (Poli 2009a,b). The most external (superficial) layer concerns\ninformation about how we sense our body. Feeling cold,\nwarm, just ok are some of the most typical cases. Let\nus call them sensorial feelings. The next layer comprises\ninformation about our moods. Feeling bored, excited,\nrelaxed, angry, and exhausted make up only a\ntiny section of the rich and highly articulated field of moods.\nFeelings pertaining to this second group are typically twofold: they\nhave a more bodily-oriented side and a more psychologically-oriented\none. By default, they merge, but they may diverge and their\nmanifestation may follow different routes according to a variety of\nconditioning factors, from social to individual. Let us call this\nsecond group of feelings mood feelings. The third and\ndeepest-lying layer is our personal style, the way in which we react to\nwhat happens to us. Suppose that something hurts you. You may\nresist the pain, tolerate it, combat it,\naccept it, or even enjoy it. Let us denote this third\ngroup of feelings with the term character. \n\nA character is defined by a number of different parameters, each of\nwhich ranges from a maximum to a minimum (ET2.36): \n\nPut slightly differently, and by way of summary: \nA character is defined by the position it assumes along each of\nthese dimensions. Each dimension consists of a continuum ranging from\nan extreme of value to an extreme of disvalue. Furthermore, each\ndimension also has points of breakdown where values change directly\ninto disvalues (different from disvalues as complements). Consider the\ncapacity to suffer. It is true that suffering tempers the character, so\nthat the person is able to achieve higher thresholds of value. However,\nif the suffering exceeds the ability to withstand it, the person is\ndestroyed and the suffering changes directly into disvalue. Note that\nthe various dimensions are different but not orthogonal: indeed, a\nmodification in one dimension may reverberate on the other\ndimensions. \n\nFurthermore, behind the structure just outlined there lies the\nchoice of certain values that orient the person from within. These\nchoices concern, for instance, the options between altruism and egoism\nor between individualism and solidarism. \n\nThe two laws of the height and strength of values work together and\nconstrain the relation of preference. The expanded version of the\nrelation of preference is then: A is preferable to B as to their\nheights, or as to their strengths. The asymmetry between strength and\nheight results in two different articulations of the relation of\npreference, which we can respectively distinguish as the SH-kind of\npreference (Strength first, Height after) and the HS-kind of preference\n(Height first, Strength after). SH-preference states: for values at a\ngiven level of strength, it is correct to prefer those that are higher.\nHS-preference states instead: for values at a given level of height, it\nis correct to prefer those that are stronger. Furthermore, if the third\ndimension represented by the effort or pain involved in achieving a\nvalue is included, the degree of effort involved for each of the two\narticulations of the relation of preference should be considered, and\nthe appropriate balance should be sought between levels of effort and\nthe height of the value pursued. \n\nHartmann discusses aesthetic issues in different places (including P\nand G) and was working on his masterly Aesthetics (AE) during\nthe last years of his life. As with the case of ethics, one of the main\nfeatures of Hartmann’s aesthetics is the close interplay with\nontology. In particular, levels of reality have a bearing on the\nproblem of the levels of a work of art too. The theme of the aesthetic\nobject is a particular subdivision of ontology—a subdivision,\nmoreover, which may shed light on several aspects of ontology. In the\nIntroduction to Foundations of Ontology, Hartmann asserts that\n“the problematic [of art] belongs to the area of problems in\nwhich the ontological problem is rooted.” \n\nHartmann intentionally focuses his aesthetics on the problem of the\naesthetic object. He sets aside investigation of the correlated acts.\nIn his words, “the aesthetics of today still concentrates mainly\non analysis of the act, and this is why the stratification\nrelationship, although it has often been noted, is not yet familiar to\nit” (P.47a). Keeping the focus on the object is therefore\nmandated by the theory of levels of reality (see Section 6 above). \n\nHartmann distinguishes two levels in the aesthetic object, which he\ncalls the foreground level and the background level. The foreground\nlevel comprises the real, concrete and sensible dimensions of the\nobject, everything that is independent of the presence of a subject\nwho addresses the object and seeks to understand it. The background\nlevels vary with the kinds of content the foreground level lets\nappear. The background level exists only for the subject who grasps\nit. This level is typically organized into many distinct\nsub-levels. Following Hartmann, we may therefore state that\n“according to its manner of being, the artistic object\nnecessarily has two levels” (those of foreground and\nbackground), while “according to the overall structure of its\ncontent—that is to say, according to its inner form (i.e. the\nbackground level)—it has many levels” (AE; Poli 1998). A\ntheory of this kind obviously has two critical points: first, the\nproblem of how the relationship between the two levels is articulated;\nsecond, the problem of how the relationship among the sublevels of the\nbackground level is articulated. In the former case, Hartmann talks of\na “relationship of manifestation” on the basis of\nwhich—as has been pointed out on innumerable occasions—the \nforeground (i.e. the matter of the object) imposes constraints on\nthe background. \n\nMore interesting is that part of the theory which concerns the\ntypical stratification of the background. Different aesthetic objects\ndisplay different articulations of the background level. In the case of\nliterary works, for example, Hartmann distinguishes at least six\ndifferent levels for more sophisticated genres like epic narratives or\nnovels, while other genres have fewer levels. This applies to lyrical\npoems, for example, whose expressiveness is articulated into fewer\nlevels because of the constraints imposed on the admissible expressive\nforms. \n\nHartmann cites the portrait as an example of a visual aesthetic\nobject. He distinguishes the following levels in its background level:\nthe three-dimensional space in which the subject of the portrait and\nsome elements of the setting appear; the movement of the\nsubject’s apparent corporeality; the subject’s character;\nhis or her individual idea, or the idea that the person portrayed has\nof him/herself; the symbolic, or the universal content manifested by\nthe portrait. \n\nThis entry has only scratched the surface of Hartmann’s theory of\ncategories. Even from such a preliminary and mainly reconstructive\npresentation of his theory, however, it is evident that it is a\ncomprehensive and rich theory of categories. To conclude, we\nnote some of the problems that require discussion. \n\nThe overall architecture of the theory of levels of reality, or the\nquestion of the relations among the biological, the psychological and\nspiritual levels requires closer examination. Put briefly, if the\npsychological level ends up including what psychology and cognitive\nsciences acknowledge as psychological phenomena, the dividing line\nbetween the psychological and the spiritual levels should be located\nelsewhere, and what Hartmann calls personal spirit will become the\nhigher layer of the psychological level. Three comments are in order:\nfirst, this way of addressing the issue is entirely concordant with\nHartmann’s constant respect for what science can teach a\nphilosopher; second, the reorganization of the boundary between the two\nlevels does not raise major problems because all the relevant relations\nare of the super-position type; third, the reorganization suggested\nenables construction of an entirely different architecture of the three\nlevels, one that passes from a strictly linear organization (one level\nafter the other) to a non-linear architecture such as the one suggested\nby application of the one-many dichotomy: the (newly defined)\npsychological and spiritual levels super-pose together from their\nunderlying existential basis; furthermore, they super-pose each other.\nThis triangular architecture is a major departure from\nHartmann’s original framework. \n\nThe question of ‘complex formations’. Whilst Hartmann\nasserts that human beings, collectivities and history are stratified\nformations (e.g., A.55a), he never discusses the nature of these\ncomplex formations in detail. Indeed, the multidimensional, rich\ncategorial framework discussed by Hartmann does not appear to have a\nproper place for the category of whole—what he calls\n‘formation’. Complex wholes are complex (or stratified)\nformations. In this regard, Hartmann’s ontology is in need of\nfurther developments. He acknowledges that formations are the real\nfurniture of the world, and he occasionally interprets levels through\nthem. For instance, he does so when he claims that psychological life\nis not to be understood as the internal conscious and unconscious world\ntogether with its acts and their contents, but that it should rather be\nseen as a single complex together with corporeal life and the physical\nconditions of life. The same is true for the spiritual level: the life\nof spirit is not only ethos, language, art, knowledge, etc.;\nit is also a single complex possessing the psychological life of acts,\norganic life, and the physical conditions within the individuals that\nare its subjects. Hartmann also states that higher levels do not\npresent themselves as soul and spirit, but as human being and\ncollectivity, or as human being and history (A.52c). To emphasize the\nimportance of these passages, Hartmann adds that “This vision is\nabsolutely necessary”. On the other hand, however, Hartmann is\nunclear about how complex formations should be categorized. On\noccasion, he denies that defining levels according to the complex\nformations in which they appear is the correct strategy, because the\nessences of levels are different from the essences of formations, and\nthe limits of levels and formations would collide with each other\n(A.20c). Hartmann also emphasizes that working with formations, rather\nthan with categories, fails properly to articulate the differences\namong the levels of being (A.55a). While these latter claims are\nentirely acceptable, the problem is why formations should not have\ntheir own categorial moments. Furthermore, while the categorial study\nof levels is needed for analytical distinctions among their moments and\nthe relations among them, the categorial study of formations helps us\nunderstand how complex formations are synthetically constituted. The\ntheory of categories is, for Hartmann, restricted to the relations of\nstratification and to the levels of being as such. It does not deal\nwith the gradation of the total formations of thing, living being,\nhuman being, and collectivity. Hartmann’s attitude oscillates\nbetween the hope that the problem of complex formations will be solved\nonce the theory of categories has been completed, and the fear that the\nproblem of how heterogeneous levels can be so tightly connected within\na human being—or within a collectivity, a people, or history,\nor works of art—is a major metaphysical problem that will\nforever escape ontology’s capacity to solve it (A.52c). As a\nmatter of fact, he developed the first parts of a theory of complex\nformations in the final chapters of his Philosophy of Nature\nand returned to the topic in the Aesthetics, his last book,\nleft unfinished and published only posthumously. From these analyses it\nemerges that room should be created, within the categorial framework of\na well-elaborated ontology, for the category of complex formations or\nwholes—as I prefer to call them—and that specification\nshould be made of types of wholes and the forms of synthesis that\noperate on them. In fact, Hartmann did some preliminary work in this\ndirection with his category of complex. From the unfinished state of\nthe theory of complexes it is difficult to see whether the category of\ncomplex formations should be treated on a par with all the many other\ncategories or assume a role as important as the one performed by the\ntheory of levels of reality."}]
