The precise\ncourse of Ficino’s education is uncertain, but it is plausible that\nfrom a young age he was exposed to the medical traditions shared by\nhis father (folk elements, no doubt, had their part in these\ntraditions, even if those elements are not often recorded). Two\neducators, Comando Comandi and Luca di San Gimignano, carried out\nFicino’s early exposure to “grammatica,” which is to say\nbasic Latinate education. The outlines of Ficino’s early career begin\nto appear a bit more clearly in the 1450s; and while it is still\nunclear with whom, exactly, he studied Greek and other matters, the\nnames of the likely candidates, Francesco da Castiglione (who may have\ntaught him Greek), Antonio degli Agli, Lorenzo Pisano, and\nNiccolò Tignosi, all point in a similar direction: that of an\nexcellent but traditional education, focused on questions drawn from\nthe realm of scholastic theology (Field 1988; Hankins 1989 and\n2003–4; Vasoli 1997a). \n\nThe middle of the 1450s saw Ficino begin a practice that continued\nthroughout his life: writing philosophical letters to friends. A\nnoteworthy letter from 1458 shows him interested in four\n“sects” of philosophers: Platonists, Aristotelians,\nStoics, and Epicureans (Ficino, “De sectis philosophorum,”\nin Kristeller 1938, 2: 7–11). There is little surprising in\nFicino’s account, drawn primarily from Latin sources, apart from the\nminor fact that he devoted more space to Epicureanism than to the\nother schools, indicative of a possible early “Lucretian”\nperiod alluded to in certain sources (Brown; Hankins, Plato).\nFicino notes that some Peripatetics have held that Aristotle believed\nthe human soul would die along with the body, though significantly he\navoids attributing this position to Aristotle himself. \n\nYet if this early epistolary treatise does not contain revolutionary\nopinions, it does signify a guiding principle that runs through\nFicino’s career: “philosophy” and the “history of\nphilosophy” are closely tied. Another way to put this is that\nfor Ficino, imitative exegesis represented a way to\nphilosophize. Ficino regarded himself as a Platonist, but this did not\nmean that he was interested in finding Plato’s intentions in a\nhistoricist manner. Instead, he saw himself as one member of a\nvenerable sequence of interpreters who added to a store of wisdom that\nGod allowed progressively to unfold. Each of these “prisci\ntheologi,” or “ancient theologians,” had his part to\nplay in discovering, documenting, and elaborating the truth contained\nin the writings of Plato and other ancient sages, a truth to which\nthese sages may not have been fully privy, acting as they were as\nvessels of divine truth. \n\nThe 1460s saw Ficino gain an audience in Florence. Much later in life\nhe would write that the wealthy and powerful Cosimo de’ Medici had not\nonly been his most important patron, which was certainly true, but\nthat he had also acted as the guiding genius behind a Platonic\nAcademy. While extant sources do not permit us to understand the\nPlatonic Academy as a formal school or advanced institution with\nregular meetings, there are some facts that can be documented: Cosimo\nin 1463 gave Ficino a small property in Careggi with a domicile\n(“cum domo pro laboratore et hoste et terris laboratis,”\nas the document in the State Archive of Florence puts it; see Gentile,\nNiccoli, and Viti 1984, 175–76). There is also a letter from\nFicino to Cosimo from September of 1462, in which Ficino writes:\n“spiritedly do I devote myself to the Academy you arranged for\nus on the estate in Careggi, as if I worship rightly at a kind of\nshrine of contemplation” (See Ficino in Kristeller 1938, 2:\n87–88; and Gentile, Niccoli, and Viti 1984, 176). These two\nsources allow the inference that, while the specific gift of property\ndid not occur until 1463, Ficino and his cohort met at least once on\nMedici property in the hills outside Florence. There is another\ndocument, again from 1462, which shows that he received a house in the\ncity of Florence as a gift from Cosimo, which was then rented out, so\nthat Ficino received the income from the rent (Gentile, Niccoli, and\nViti 1984, 174–75). \n\nFicino’s connection with the Medici family waxed and waned after\nCosimo died in 1464, but the relationship signals something important:\nfor a time, Ficino represented one of the central elements of\nFlorentine intellectual life. He cultivated a wide correspondence\nnetwork and counted among his friends and patrons some of the city’s\nmost influential citizens. Ordained in 1473, he later became a canon\nof Santa Maria del Fiore, Florence’s cathedral with its famous dome\ndesigned by Brunelleschi. The rest of Ficino’s life was marked by a\ntwofold aspect, priestly and medical, in which he can be seen as a\nhealer both of souls and of bodies. \n\nAnother way to understand Ficino and his academy is to examine the\nvarious ways he uses the word “academy” and its\nvariants. What one finds is that Plato’s dialogues themselves could be\nreferred to as an “academy,” rich with precious teachings\nas they were. An “academy” could be a private school\norganized to teach youths, though not necessarily located in one\nspecific place or devoted to one doctrinal tradition. And the word\n“academy” could refer to regular meetings of literary\nmen. Ficino’s “academy” seems to have been more associated\nwith the first two meanings of the word. Rather than leading a regular\ngathering in a specific place, Ficino preferred to teach Florence’s\nelite youth when he could and, as a Socratic, philosophical friend, to\ntry to draw out of his associates the better part of their natures in\nconversation. (Hankins 2003–04, vol.2; Celenza 2007, 83) \n\nIllustrative on a number of levels is a letter of 1491 written to a\nGerman friend and correspondent, Martin Prenninger (in Ficino 1576,\n936–37). There, Ficino discusses his network of friends and\nacquaintances. Though it does not contain the word\n“academy” or “academic,” the letter gives a\ngood idea of what Ficino believed he was doing when it came to\nhis program of sharing Platonic wisdom, which was linked with\nwhat he saw as true Christianity. His correspondent had asked him\nabout his friends, and Ficino is careful in response to qualify what\n“friend” means: “Know that all [of my friends] are\nindeed well-tested both with respect to their intellectual talent and\ntheir character. I have never considered anyone a friend unless I also\ndetermined that he had joined literary learning together with\nuprightness of character.” For Ficino, the notion that one\nshould combine book learning with good moral character was\n“Platonic,” and immediately after the cited section he\nalludes to a passage in the (for Ficino authentic) Platonic\nLetters, expressing a similar sentiment. In truth,\nhowever, this sentiment (and countless others like it in Ficino’s\nwork) belongs to no specific school of thought; rather, it is part of a\nlong, pre-modern tradition stressing the need to link learning with\nmorals. For Ficino, it was “Platonic” because it was\ntrue, and it was “true” because it was Platonic. For\nus, however, Ficino’s framing of his catalogue of friends in this\nway reminds us just how generally and broadly he believed\n“Platonic” wisdom to extend. That is, in the broadest\nsense, for Ficino, everything he did could be considered\n“Platonic.” \n\nThere are more precise ways of looking at what Ficino’s\n“academic” activity might have entailed. He continues, in\nthat same letter, to separate his friends into three categories. There\nare “patrons” (in which category all the Medici family\nmembers were included). These are followed by “familiar friends,\nfellow conversationalists, so to speak” (“consuetudine\nfamiliares, ut ita loquar, confabulatores”); and third, there\nare “auditores” or “students.” The\nconfabulatores include numerous prominent intellectuals, among\nthem Leon Battista Alberti, Angelo Poliziano and Giovanni Pico della\nMirandola. Ficino writes that, if the people he lists are\n“almost pupils [discipuli], still, they aren’t\nreally pupils, since I wouldn’t want to imply that I had taught\nor am teaching any of them, but rather, in a Socratic fashion, I ask\nthem all questions and encourage them, and I persistently call forth\nthe fertile geniuses of my friends to bring about birth.”\nFicino saw his influence in the classic Socratic manner, as midwifery\nof knowledge, an image made famous in Plato’s\nTheaetetus. Uniting his medical and priestly missions,\nFicino’s goal was to help cure the diseases of ignorance\nand impiety, which he regarded as related. \n\nFicino also taught occasionally in a more formal sense. Early in his\ncareer, he lectured publicly on Plato’s Philebus, though\nwhere and in what context precisely is unknown. He taught very briefly\nat the Florentine studio, or university (see Davies\n1992). He also instructed youths at the Camaldolese convent of Santa\nMaria degli Angeli, and he probably taught privately at various times\nto supplement his income. But what exactly he taught remains uncertain\n(even as what exactly Plato taught within the confines of the Academy\nis uncertain). One compelling source, the\nDeclamationes of the little-known humanist Benedetto Colucci,\nrepresents Ficino presiding in 1474 over a group of five well-born\nyouths (see Colucci 1939). All of them (students\ncontemporaneously of his humanist friend Cristoforo Landino at the\nFlorentine studio) are given the task, supervised by Ficino\n(referred to as the “Academiae princeps”), of delivering a\nspeech exhorting Italian leaders to fight against the advancing\nTurks. Here Ficino seems to have been teaching rhetoric and the\nart of declamation. Other instances in his writings appear to\nindicate that one meaning he and others associated with the word\n“academia” was something close to “gymnasium,”\nor elementary school. \n\nIn the broadest sense, then, Ficino’s “academy” was not a\nspecific place but a mindset; and as tempting as it is for moderns to\nfit Ficino into a Platonic “system” of philosophy (seen as\nin stark contrast to what is assumed to be an equally unitary\n“Aristotelian” system), doing so would be deeply\nanachronistic. Like almost all late ancient Platonists and high\nmedieval thinkers, Ficino believed, for example, that one should start\nwith Aristotle, just he himself had done. In the letter mentioned\nabove, he listed, as an auditor, or student, a thinker named\nFrancesco Cattani da Diacceto, whom Ficino eventually considered his\nsuccessor. And in a letter written to that same Diacceto in July 1493,\nFicino stated a classic position (for which see Gerson): that\nphilosophy was such a broad enterprise that a division of labor was\nnecessary, and that “whoever rightly understands that natural\nmatters lead us to divine matters will realize that Peripatetic\nlearning represents the way toward Platonic wisdom, so that it has\ncome about that no one is ever admitted to the inner reaches of the\nPlatonic mysteries without first having been initiated into the\nPeripatetic branches of learning” (Ficino 1576, 952). Truth was\none, philosophy was broad in its scope, and for people to realize the\ntruth and appreciate philosophy’s reach, they needed to be trained\nproperly. \n\nFicino’s wide ranging conception of what it meant to practice, rather\nthan only to theorize about, philosophy inflected his entire career,\nmarked as it was by a series of works, from translations, to letters,\nto philosophical treatises. Ficino’s initial activity, in the late 1450s, included short\ntreatises, mostly epistolary, on certain basic philosophical\nmatters. The 1460s saw him come into his own as a translator; these\nyears also represent the beginnings of his work as a commentator and\nexegete. In 1464, when Cosimo de’ Medici was in the final stages of\nhis life, Ficino read to him his new translations of certain Platonic\ndialogues (some of which are now considered spurious). And it is\nnoteworthy that, by this point in the fifteenth century, Platonic\nsources seemed suitable for traditional, Christian end of life\npreparation; admittedly it is Ficino’s own much later account from\nwhich this story is drawn, but he would hardly have mentioned it had\nsuch a scenario been wholly implausible (Hankins 1989,\n267–68). As that decade wore on Ficino authored commentaries on\nand summaries of Plato’s writings, many of which he continued to work\non for the rest of his career; these included\nthe Timaeus, Phaedrus,\nSymposium (less a commentary and more of a free-standing\ndialogue), and the Philebus. \n\nThis process of intense reading and commenting set the stage for\nFicino to write one of his most interesting works. Between 1469 and\n1474 he composed his Theologia platonica (Platonic\nTheology), which awaited print publication until 1482. The work’s\nsubtitle, On the Immortality of Souls, is indicative of\nFicino’s goals. He feared that his contemporaries were losing their\nway, and he believed that the right sort of approach would help them\nfind it. Above all, there was a tendency, he wrote (in the work’s\ndedicatory preface, addressed to Lorenzo de’ Medici), to separate\nphilosophy from religion. Using Plato, and trying “to paint a\nportrait of Plato as close as possible to the Christian truth,”\n(Allen and Hankins 2001–06, vol.1, proem, sec.3,\npp. 10–11) seemed to Ficino the way out of this impasse. \n\nHow to paint this portrait as fully as possible was the key\nquestion. Ficino considered the Platonic corpus a treasury of wisdom,\nfilled with different subject matters but always, when rightly\ninterpreted, leading one to the divine. In the same preface, he writes\nof Plato that “whatever subject he deals with, he quickly brings\nit round, in a spirit of utmost piety, to the contemplation and\nworship of God.” Ficino conceived his own Platonic\nTheology as a similar sort of treasury, and as a Christian\ncorrective to a work he greatly admired, Proclus’s own\nPlatonic Theology, a work that, precisely because of its\nthreefold status, seems emblematic: first, Proclus’s work was for the\nmost part “new” for the fifteenth-century West, one of the\nmany interesting texts uncovered by that century’s tireless search for\nmatters ancient; second, Proclus was a decided anti-Christian; third\nand no less powerfully, Proclus’s style of philosophizing, like much\npagan later Platonism largely unknown to Ficino’s medieval\npredecessors, shared deep family resemblances with Christianity. Among\nthese aspects one can include: the efficacy of theurgic rituals, which\nhad their Christian analogy in sacraments (see Celenza 2001); and a\n“monotheism” that respected the necessity of having one\nsupreme being (for later Platonists, “the One,” for\nChristians, “God”) but that permitted its practitioners to\naccess the divine directly, for pagans, through worship of various\ngods; for Christians, through the cult of the saints (see Athanassiadi\nand Frede 1999, 1–20). \n\nYet Ficino needed to guard not only against the seductive danger of\nthese “new” ancient texts, important though they were for\nthe simultaneous appeal and potential instability they generated.  He\nalso inherited from his humanist counterparts in the earlier part of\nthe fifteenth century (men like Leonardo Bruni, 1370–1444) the\nnotion that it was imperative to educate society’s elites, the\ningeniosi, or acute wits, as Michael Allen translated the\nterm (see Allen 1998). His Platonic Theology, Ficino hoped,\nwould contain genres of argumentation and styles of language that,\ntogether, would represent a treasury of wisdom, perfectly apt for\ndifferent varieties of his contemporaries who might have wavered in\ntheir faith. For those inclined to the newly fashionable classicizing\nLatinity, Ficino includes in the Platonic Theology countless\nquotations from Latin classics; for those of an Aristotelian bent,\nFicino has natural philosophical arguments (for one example see Allen\nand Hankins (eds.) 2001–06, 5.4, vol. 2, pp. 20–23 and\ncf. Aristotle, Meteor., 1.3 and 1.9 for descriptions of\n“antiperistasis” to which Ficino seems there to be\nalluding); and for those who might be more inclined to an\nanti-rationalist religiosity, Ficino includes copious biblical\nallusions and quotations. Ficino even has an entire book of the\nPlatonic Theology devoted to refuting Avveroistic ideas, in\nwhich the lion’s share of argumentation harks back in content, if\nnot always in form, to Thomas Aquinas and the scholastic\ntradition. The Platonic Theology was a work of\nsynthesis, but not of systematic philosophy, as thinkers from the\neighteenth century on would have understood that latter term.\nDifferent styles of argumentation, flights of rhetorical fancy,\nnumerous puns, intertextual allusions, un-sourced citations, and overt\nappeals to faith all compete for the reader’s attention. \n\nThe Platonic Theology represented in some ways a turning\npoint for Ficino: a summing up of the work he had done until then and\na way forward to other projects, which he completed soon after 18\nDecember 1473, when he was ordained a priest. As he was completing\nthe Platonic Theology, he wrote his On the Christian\nReligion, a treatise that, in its lapidary beginning, synthesized\nmuch of his life-long commitment to the centrality of religion to\nhuman experience. He begins the work’s first chapter: “We do\nobserve, at times in some animals, some individual gifts of the human\nrace, with one exception: religion” (Ficino 1576, 2). And he\nhad already written, in the preface to Lorenzo de’ Medici, that God’s\nwisdom had established that the “divine mysteries,” which\nis to say religion, should be handled by “those who were true\nlovers of true wisdom,” in short by true\n“philosophers.” Humanity’s uniqueness with respect to\nreligion also demanded that religion should be watched over by members\nwho adhered to its highest calling: the love of wisdom, or\nphilosophy. Ficino produced both a vernacular and a Latin version of\nthis work; the vernacular version was published in 1474, whereas the\nLatin came out in 1476, even as Ficino seems to have published two\nlater, different redactions (Kristeller 1938, 1: lxxviii). \n\nThe rest of that decade was filled with work that reflected Ficino’s\npropensity to join philosophy and religion: in different contexts\n(letters and discussions) he spread some of the doctrines elaborated\nin his yet-to-be printed Platonic Theology. He continued work\non commentaries, and he wrote his work on the rapture of St. Paul\n(De raptu Pauli); Paul’s “rapture” referred to a\npassage in II Cor. 12:2–4, where Paul is said to have known a\n“man” (widely assumed to have been the Apostle himself)\n“who was taken up into heaven and heard the secret words\n[arcana verba] that man is not allowed to hear.” This\npassage, which was resonant with themes of ecstatic, extra-mental\nascent, had been important to Augustine and Aquinas (Newman); and for\nFicino, it also proved a touchstone, given that themes of ascent were\ndear to the Platonic tradition. \n\nFicino’s medical mission continued to play a role in these years. He\nworked on his “Advice against the Plague” (Consiglio\ncontro la pestilenza) in 1478–79, a treatise that was\nprinted in 1481 (Katinis 2007). \n\nChronologically, the next signal event was Ficino’s publication of\nthe Complete Works of Plato (Platonis Opera Omnia),\nwhich included his translations of Plato’s writings, thirty-six in\nall. This number encompassed all those works contained in the nine\ntetralogies (some now considered spurious), an arrangement attributed\nby Diogenes Laertius (Diog.  Laert., 3.59) to Thrasyllus (possibly the\notherwise unknown court astrologer to Tiberius); included were\nthirty-five dialogues and the Platonic\nLetters. All of these translations were complete in draft\nform by 1468–69 (Hankins 1989, 300–18). After the\ncompletion of the Platonic Theology, Ficino returned to them,\nwriting commentaries along the way, and in October 1484, the work was\nprinted. This year was almost certainly chosen for astrological\nreasons, since it appeared to contemporary astrologers to portend\ngreat matters, occurring as it did during a conjunction of Jupiter and\nSaturn (Hankins 1989, 303). Ficino was especially eager to get this\nwork into print, it seems, as he included only a few commentaries;\nalthough he did provide “argumenta,” or short summaries of\nthe Platonic works, his fuller Commentaries on Plato waited\nanother twelve years for publication. \n\nAs mentioned, Ficino lived in an era when\ninterpretive exegesis represented a form of philosophical\ncomposition. He believed, on the one hand, that he needed to bring out\nthe philosophical truth for his own times and, moreover, that the\ntruth was contained in Plato’s works. On the other hand, these works\nwere filled with dialogical ambiguity and passages which, if not read\ncarefully, could prove dangerous if not overtly heretical. So Ficino’s\nenterprise of translation was as much designed to render the texts\nthemselves from Greek into Latin as it was to translate Plato, and\nindeed the entire “ancient theology” of which Plato had\nbeen the prime representative, into the cultural idiom of the late\nmedieval and Renaissance world in which Ficino found himself. \n\nAs time went by, Ficino’s intellectual energies moved in the direction\nof deepening his understanding of Platonism and of expanding this\nproject of cultural translation. Having translated and explicated much\nof Plato’s work, he shifted, in the late 1480s, to Plotinus, an\nexegetical project that included the first full Greek to Latin\ntranslation of Plotinus’s works along with commentary. \n\nIn 1489, Ficino published a work, Three Books on Life (De\nvita libri tres), that had a substantial printing history in\nearly modern Europe, even as its contents contributed to his later\nreputation as a less-than-serious philosopher (see Kaske and\nClark; and Robichaud 2017a). The manuscript tradition prior to its printing tells the story\nof a work composed of three separate books: ‘On Healthy\nLife’ (De vita sana), completed around 1480,\ncorresponded to Book One in the eventual printed edition. An amalgam\nof folk medicine and learned commentary, De vita sana was\nintended to help scholars, thought to have a “melancholic”\nhumoral temperament, achieve a healthy style of life.  Toward that\nend, it counseled various recipes, dietary regimes, and personal\nhabits, all to be undertaken under the umbrella of what were\nconsidered proper astrological conditions. The second book, ‘On\nLong Life’ (De vita longa), completed in 1489, was\nwritten in a similar vein and directed to the aged. Finally, the third\nbook, ‘On Obtaining Life from the Heavens’ (De vita\ncoelitus comparanda), composed sometime between the first two\nbooks, grew out of Ficino’s commentary project on Plotinus (it was\nspecifically a commentary on Enneads, 4.3.11). Of the three books of De vita, the third proved most\ncontroversial, dealing as it did in places with seemingly heretical\nthemes, including potentially idolatrous “statue\nanimation”, which is to say the possibility of drawing down\ncelestial forces into inanimate objects, thus rendering them\nanimate. For Ficino, the ritualized activation of occult properties\n(“signed” images and “sympathies”) represented a legitimate part of\nnatural philosophy, one to which the recently available range of later\nPlatonic and “Hermetic” material had opened new pathways. Ficino tells\n(to take one typical example) of certain stars that possess discrete\npowers (Ficino in Kaske and Clark, 3.8, 278-79). He reports that\nThebit, an ancient thinker known from the Hermetic Corpus,\n“teaches that, in order to capture the power of any of the stars just\nmentioned, one should take its stone and herb and make a gold or\nsilver ring and should insert the stone with the herb underneath it\nand wear it touching [your flesh]” (ibid., tr. Kaske and\nClark). Channeling powers that the divine had implanted in nature for\nhumankind to use could indeed seem legitimate. Yet Ficino came close\nenough to theological unacceptability that the publication\nof Three Books on Life signaled the only time, seemingly,\nthat his work drew negative attention from Church authorities. What\nprecisely happened is vague, but a substantial correspondence after\nMay, 1490, in which Ficino asked certain friends of his at the court\nof Pope Innocent VIII for help, suggests that certain people had\ncalled his orthodoxy into question (Kristeller 1956-96,\n4:265-76).  By August of that year, Ficino was assured that his\nreputation was favorable at the Papal Court. The year 1496 saw the publication of an expanded version of\nsome Commentaries on Plato, including\nthe Parmenides, Sophist, Philebus,\nTimaeus, Phaedrus, and the “nuptial\nnumber” in the Republic (Allen 1994). In 1497 Ficino\npublished, with Aldus Manutius, a volume devoted to other\n“Platonic” authors, with works by Iamblichus, Proclus,\nPorphyry, Synesius, and Psellus making appearances. \n\nFicino considered himself a Platonist, but a Platonist in a very\nspecific mold: as part of a long tradition of which Plato was a key\npart but which needed interpreters to keep it going. This\n“ancient theology” included figures who, divinely\ninspired, advanced true philosophy. One of the key figures in this\nsequence was the ancient sage Hermes “Trismegistus”\n(“thrice great,” because he was considered the greatest\nking, philosopher, and priest). For Ficino, as for the late ancient\nPlatonists he admired, Hermes was an ancient Egyptian, roughly\ncontemporary with Moses. In the early seventeenth century, Isaac\nCasaubon would prove that the writings attributed to Hermes could not\nhave been as ancient as they were believed to be (they are considered\nnow to be products of late antiquity). Ficino described the ancient\ntheology in this fashion in his Preface to his Latin translation of\nthe Hermetic Corpus, discussing Hermes as first in this chain\nof sages (Ficino 1576, 1836, cit. and tr. in Copenhaver and Schmitt\n1992, 147): \n\nAfter the year 1469, Ficino changed the order and placed Zoroaster\nfirst, linking him to the Magi who visited the infant Christ (Allen\n1998, 1–49). Unphilosophical though such speculations might seem\nto modern readers, there are at least two ways in which Ficino’s\nancient theology manifested ties to what, in his era, could be\nconsidered part of philosophy. First, the model of\n“successions” (Latin “successiones”, Greek\n“diadochai”) would have been intuitively familiar to many\nthinkers. At its most emblematic in Diogenes Laertius’s\nLives of the Philosophers, the “succession” model\nposited the notion that a powerful initial figure, whose style of life\nand doctrines were considered exemplary, would have founded a\n“school” in which many others had followed. (The 1433\ntranslation into Latin of Diogenes Laertius’ Lives\nvaulted it onto Renaissance thinkers’ desks; it had a significant\npredecessor in the Middle Ages in a series of Lives then attributed to\nWalter Burley, though see now Grignaschi). Second, and more\npowerfully, like medieval thinkers before him, Ficino saw\n“philosophy” and “theology” as linked domains,\nwith philosophy as subordinate to theology (Marenbon 2000, esp.\nstudies XII and XV). “Philosophers” could only be\nconsidered authentic lovers of wisdom if they graduated from\ndisputatious word games, which Ficino thought were commonly taught as\ndialectic, to the source of ultimate truth. \n\nAlthough it would have seemed artificial to Ficino to separate certain\nareas of philosophizing from each other, nevertheless, it is useful,\nas a heuristic device, to consider subjects such as ontology\nseparately (see Allen 1982). And here, in the context of discussing\nbeing and its levels, without doubt Ficino’s first debt was to\nPlotinus. Plotinus had expressed himself variously, but it is not\ninaccurate to say that, for him, there had been four general levels to\nthe cosmos, beginning with The One (to hen). This level\nrepresented, for Plotinus, a hybrid of Plato’s Form of the Good and\nAristotle’s prime mover. It stood at the summit of the ontological\nhierarchy and was so great, indeed, that it was outside of Being\nitself. It was everywhere, “filling all things,” yet it\nwas also nowhere, since it must be distinct from the world it created\n(Enneads, 3.9.4). Thinking, it overflowed into the next\nontological level, Mind, which in succession overflowed into Soul,\nwhich overflowed into a fourth realm that included Nature, Matter, and\nSensation. Just as Plotinus varied his descriptions of these\nontological levels throughout the Enneads, so too did Ficino\n(Allen 1982). That said, Ficino did, in numerous places, suggest a\nfive-part (instead of a four-part) ontological scheme, which began\nwith God, followed by Angelic Mind, Rational Soul (in which human\nbeings take part), “Quality” (a kind of ontological glue\nthat stands between matter and soul), and finally matter, the level in\nwhich we human begins are embodied and from which we must try to\nliberate ourselves by living a philosophical life.  \n\nFicino’s ontology thus shared aspects with Plotinus’s, including: the\nhierarchy which human beings, through their birth and appearance in\nthe world, have descended; the importance of meditation and\nphilosophical practices in fashioning re-ascent; the presence of\n“sympathies,” or hidden connections (which the properly\nobservant philosopher could find and reveal) between material and\ncelestial things that helped link the different levels of the\nhierarchy; and the hierarchy’s background of Platonic echoes (such as\nthe cave imagery from the Republic and the same dialogue’s\nmyth of Er, and the post-death journey in the\nPhaedo). \n\nSimilarly, he shared much with Plotinus when it came to psychology,\nthe study of the soul. The immortality of the human soul represented\nFicino’s main preoccupation, fearing as he did the potential loss of\nbelief among intellectual elites. He entitled the first chapter of\nhis Platonic Theology accordingly: “Were the soul not\nimmortal, no creature would be more miserable than man.” (Allen\nand Hankins 2001–06, 1.1, vol. 1, p. 14–15) The reason\nbehind this statement is Ficino’s conception, shared with many other\nthinkers, that the human soul is endowed with a “natural\nappetite” that induces it, however haltingly and diversely\n(owing to its en-mattered state), to return to its divine origin\n(Kristeller 1988, 181; Ficino 1576, 1187). Ficino writes that\n“man alone never rests in his present habit of living: he alone\nis a pilgrim in these regions and cannot rest on the journey as long\nas he aspires to his celestial homeland, which all of us seek,\nalthough we proceed on sundry paths on account of the diversity of\nopinion and of judgment.” (Allen and Hankins 2001–06,\n14.7, vol. 5, p.  272–73) \n\nIf Ficino shared this notion with Plotinus, and indeed with all\nPlatonists, he differed concerning the issue of the transmigration of\nsouls. Since Plato’s Myth of Er in the Republic\n(10.614–621), a staple of Platonism had been the notion that\nsouls were not only immortal but that they had also pre-existed before\ntheir human embodiment and that they would exist again in another body\nwhen the human body-soul dyad was severed after death. Since this\nnotion was heretical to Christian ears (both because it precluded\nthe ex nihilo creation of each and every human soul and\nbecause God, having created man in His own image, could not allow a\nhuman soul eventually to be reincarnated as an animal), Ficino had to\ncombat it. In his view, Plato himself must be read more sensitively,\nso that in different contexts Ficino spoke of this heretical notion as\nprefiguring bodily resurrection, as allusions to the return of the\nsoul to the One, or failing that as a hateful doctrine that must be\nattributed, not to Plato, but to Pythagoras (Hankins 1989,\n358–59; Celenza 1999, 681–99; Allen and Hankins\n2001–06, 17.4, vol. 6, p.  45–63) \n\nOne final point needs to be made regarding Ficino and the human soul,\nwhich is that he emphatically did not theorize it as an\n“extension-less” mind, as Descartes later would do in his\nMeditations (Descartes, Oeuvres 7: 71–90). Ficino’s\nsoul-body dualism was not the same as “mind-body” dualism,\nnor indeed was it for Plato, for late ancient Platonists, or for\nmedieval thinkers before Ficino (Celenza 2007, 88–89). For\nFicino as for his predecessors, the human soul, and “Soul”\nin general, could have material effects on the phenomenological world\nin ways that “mind” could not in the Cartesian\ntradition. \n\nPart of the reason for this “activist” conception of Soul\non Ficino’s part had to do with a search to find forces binding human\nbeings to one another. For Ficino, love linked all things together;\nand love flowed first from God into all existing things, which\nconsequently shared the property of similarity, outwardly different as\nthey might be on the surface. It is for this reason that\n“spirit,” or spiritus, was so important in\nFicino’s thought. Ficino suggests: “Spirit is defined by doctors\nas a vapor of blood – pure, subtle, hot, and clear. After being\ngenerated by the heat of the heart out of the more subtle blood, it\nflies to the brain; and there the soul uses it continually for the\nexercise of the interior as well as the exterior senses” (Ficino\nin Kaske and Clark 1988, 1.2, 11–15, p. 110). This blurring, to\nmodern eyes, of the metaphysical and the physical, in which the\n“immaterial” soul can use a vaporous material entity to\nhave effects on the physical world, presents Ficino at his most\ncharacteristic. Love between people occurs when the lover’s spirit is\nexhaled toward the beloved and the beloved returns the gesture\nreciprocally; unreciprocated love can thus become a kind of homicide,\nas one human being loses a vital element to another. “When we\nspeak about Love,” Ficino writes (and here he means earthly\nlove), “you should understand this as meaning the desire for\nbeauty. For this is the definition of love among all\nphilosophers.” Ficino goes on: “The purpose of love is the\nenjoyment of beauty” (Ficino 1576, 1322–23; Kristeller\n1988, 282). \n\nFor Ficino, in classic Platonic fashion, it is the manner in which one\nenjoys beauty which differentiates true from false love. Beauty is\n“bait” and a “hook” for Ficino: “The\nsplendor of the highest good is refulgent in individual things, and\nwhere it blazes the more fittingly, there it especially attracts\nsomeone gazing upon it, excites his consideration, seizes and occupies\nhim as he approaches, and compels him both to venerate such splendor\nas the divinity beyond all others, and to strive for nothing else but\nto lay aside his former nature and to become that splendor\nitself” (Allen and Hankins 2001–06, 14.1.4, vol. 4,\n222–23). Once this attraction has taken place, “…\nthe soul burns with a divine radiance which is reflected in the man of\nbeauty as in a mirror, and … caught up by that radiance\nsecretly as by a hook, he is drawn upwards in order to become\nGod” (ibid.). And God would be a “wicked tyrant” if\nhe implanted in human beings this aspiration without allowing the\npossibility of its eventual fulfillment (ibid.). \n\nThe development of the whole person was of paramount importance to\nFicino, and it is for this reason that his “educational”\nmission must be fore-grounded. As we have seen, Ficino taught only\nonce, and very briefly, at the Florentine studio (Davies\n1992); and there would be no chair in any European university devoted\nto the teaching of Plato until later in the sixteenth century.  This\nabsence of Plato and Platonism from university faculties is\nunderstandable: Aristotle’s more pedagogically suitable work had,\nsince late antiquity and even among Platonists, been deemed basic to\neducation; this fact is unsurprising, given that Aristotle’s work was\npreserved in the form of lecture notes. And the medieval university\ncurriculum reflected a similar propensity to begin with Aristotelian\ntexts in the arts faculties, before a student, having graduated with a\nbachelor of arts degree (baccalaureus artium), would move on\nto the higher faculties of medicine, law, or theology. This intense\nfocus on Aristotelian texts, especially logic, was useful, providing\nmedieval university students with a common vocabulary and similar\napproaches to argumentation.  Yet by Ficino’s era, the number of\nuniversities had risen dramatically, and unsurprisingly the\nAristotelian curricula came under scrutiny (Celenza 2007). For some,\nearlier in the fifteenth century, it was the seemingly inelegant Latin\nof scholastic philosophers that was unappealing. But for Ficino, the\nproblems had less to do with language and more to do with morality.\nCharacter needed to be developed before dialectic was taught. As\nFicino wrote in his commentary on Plato’s dialogue Philebus,\nPlato “shows that [dialectic] must not be given to adolescents\nbecause they are led by it into three vices: pride, lewdness,\nimpiety. For when they first taste the ingenious subtlety of arguing,\nit is as if they have come upon a tyrannous power of rebutting and\nrefuting the rest of us” (Comm. In Philebum, ed.\nFicino, in Allen 2000, 230; Hankins 1989, 272). The natural prideful\nignorance of youth, when fueled by a capacity to win arguments, could\nbe heightened and led into undesirable directions by the unrestrained\npower of dialectic. \n\nFicino died in 1499, leaving a significant cultural legacy.\nTextually, he provided western European thinkers with authoritative\nversions of Plato, Plotinus, and other Platonizing thinkers.  Ficino’s\nLatin translations of those texts became standard ones for over three\ncenturies after his death. Ficino’s theories on love permeated\nsixteenth-century literature, as writers from Baldassare Castiglione\nand Pietro Bembo in Italy to Joachim du Bellay and Pierre de Ronsard\nin France took up “Platonic” love in their literary\nworks. \n\nFicino also helped legitimize, for a time, a style of thinking that\none sixteenth-century thinker, Agostino Steuco, termed\n“perennial philosophy” (philosophia perennis), a\ndesignation that became more famous when Gottfried Leibniz took it up\nin a 1714 letter (Leibniz, DPS, 3: 624–25; Schmitt\n1966, 506, n.11).  Adherents believed that there was a discernible\ncore of truth in many philosophies seen as different on the\nsurface. The late sixteenth century saw the teaching of Platonism at\nthe University of Ferrara, with the Croatian-born Francesco Patrizi\n(1529–1597) holding the chair from 1578–92, moving thence\nto teach Platonic thought at the University of Rome from 1592 until\nhis death. \n\nAs the new science took hold in the seventeenth century and as, in the\neighteenth century, new styles of thinking about the history of\nphilosophy grew, Ficino’s reputation declined. The canon-making\nhistorian of philosophy Johann Jakob Brucker wrote in the 1740s that\nFicino “obtained a humble rank” because, “captivated\nby the trifles of later Platonists, he feigns, re-feigns, and changes\nPlato” (Brucker, 4.1: 55). For Brucker, as for many who followed\nhim, the enterprise of philosophy needed to become a\n“critical,” rationalistic enterprise; and philosophy\nitself, separating itself from natural philosophy, grew ever more\nconcerned with questions of epistemology. This is to say that\nphilosophers’ concerns began to revolve, if sometimes only obliquely\nand unconsciously, around the question of how a formally distinct,\n“extension-less” mind could know things about and within\nan exterior world to which it was fundamentally unconnected. Citizens\nof this new philosophical republic had little time for semi-mythical\nancient sages, hidden natural sympathies, and the interpretive style\nof philosophizing (concerned more with styles of life and less with\nsystematic theories) at which Ficino so excelled. Yet his thought\npermeated many aspects of western intellectual life. Making Plato and\nPlatonism respectable subjects of research and philosophical\nreflection; embracing a broad view of human religious history; and\nfocusing overtly, through practice as well as theory, on the\nimportance of teaching the young: these aspects of his achievements\nand more make Ficino a Renaissance philosopher worth remembering\ntoday.","contact.mail":"ccelenza@georgetown.edu","contact.domain":"georgetown.edu"}]
