While speculative investigations and\nabstract analyses have always been part of immune theorizing, until\nrecently philosophers have largely ignored immunology. Yet the\nimplications for understanding the philosophical basis of organismal\nfunctions framed by immunity offer new perspectives on fundamental\nquestions of biology and medicine. Developed in the context of history\nof medicine, theoretical biology, and medical anthropology, philosophy\nof immunology differs from these related branches of study in its\nfocus on traditional philosophical questions concerning identity,\nindividuality, ecology, cognition, scientific methodology and theory\nconstruction. This broad agenda derives from immunology’s\nmultifaceted research program that has developed from its initial\nclinical challenges of host defense, transplantation, autoimmunity,\ntumor immunology, and allergy. In addition to these well-established\nresearch areas, immunity is now understood to play a central role in\nother physiological functions, development, ecology, and evolutionary\nmechanics. Holding together these diverse domains of inquiry lie\nphilosophical commitments oriented by organismal identity. In this\nregard, pertinent issues are raised concerning \n\n cognition (organization of immune perception and information\nprocessing), \n\n the character of individuality (framed by the ecological context\nof immune-mediated assimilation and rejection), and \n\n the dynamics of complex systems (understood as holistic systems\nbiology). \n\nIndeed, immunology, in the context of cognitive science, evolutionary\nbiology, environmental sciences, and development provides multi-focal\nperspectives for philosophy of science.\n\n\n\n\nThe immune system is typically represented as a system of defense that\nprotects the organism from pathogens. However, this system is known to\nplay other functions in the organism that include  \nThus, by responding to the inner and outer environments of the\norganism, the immune system participates in many capacities to\ncoordinate diverse physiological functions and to provide\ncommunication between them. Immunity thus relies upon cognitive\nfunctions coupled to an array of effector mechanisms that have\nwide-ranging regulative, reparative, and defensive capabilities.\nBeyond the philosophical significance of these immune-mediated\nfunctions, studies of immunity are uniquely positioned to address\ncentral problems in\n philosophy of biology (see entry)\n and, more broadly, philosophy of science. These include the\nreductionism/holism debate, the characterization of the goals and\nmethods of systems biology, the organization of cognition and\ninformation, and the challenge of integrating complexity theory with\nbig data studies. \nDespite the multifaceted role of the immune system and its importance\nin promoting survival and persistence of all forms of life (Pradeu\n2012: 22–32), immunology has traditionally been of minor\ninterest to philosophers of biology (cf. Hull and Ruse 2007; Sarkar\nand Plutynski 2010). However, increased attention has recently been\ndirected to address a range of ontological and epistemological\nproblems related to immune phenomena. These studies have focused upon\nthe “immune self”, the central motif of biological\nidentity in the context of immunity (Tauber 1994; Pradeu 2012).\nRanging over diverse topics, including personal identity (Howes 1999),\nethical and anthropological concerns with human self-image (Sontag\n1990; E. Martin 1994), and poststructuralist, constructivist and\nfeminist notions of identity (Derrida 2003; Haraway 1989; Weasel\n2001), philosophers have invoked immunological conceptions of\nselfhood. Moreover, the examination of immunology has proven\nincreasingly useful in addressing philosophical problems pertaining to\nother fields of study such as ecology (Tauber 2017), neuro- and\ncognitive sciences (Varela et al. 1988), developmental biology (Fagan\n2007), microbiology (Méthot and Alizon 2014) and evolutionary\nbiology (Hull, Langman, and Glenn 2001). This increased recognition of\nimmunology in philosophy of biology not only reflects a growing trend\ntowards more inclusive approaches, more generally, but also\ncontributes to the intensifying effort to understand ecological\ndynamics that range from microbial interactions to climate change\n(O’Malley and Dupre 2007; O’Malley 2014). \nImmunologists have long applied philosophy to elaborate conceptual\nframeworks for understanding the immune system and to shed light on\nthe character of experimental conduct in this biomedical field\n(Anderson 2014). To highlight the common culture of immunology and\nphilosophy, a prominent Australian immunologist, Macfarlane Burnet,\nwrote in 1965: “Immunology has always seemed to me more a\nproblem in philosophy than in practical science” (Burnet 1965).\nHe was inspired by Whitehead in elaborating his notion of immune\nselfhood and by his attempts to apply cybernetics and information\ntheory to immunology (Anderson and Mackay 2014). Another influential,\nphilosophically-oriented immunologist, Niels Jerne, admitted to having\nbeen influenced by Kierkegaard’s discussion of Plato’s\nMeno when elaborating his key conceptual ideas (i.e., the\nselection theory of antibody production) (Jerne 1966, Söderqvist\n2003: 186). And perhaps most prominently, Ludwik Fleck’s\nimmunological and bacteriological research served as the case example\nof a “thought collective” that has served as the founding\nstudy of the social character of scientific change in biology and\nscience (Löwy 1986; Fagan 2009; see the entry on\n Ludwik Fleck).\n Many other prominent immunological researchers, including\nMetchnikoff, Zinsser, Medawar, Edelman and Salk, were also humanist\nthinkers who, in addition to active laboratory research, conspicuously\nexpounded philosophical ideas on the nature of reality, the character\nof cognition, the limits of science, the condition of humankind, and\nthe like. Thus, a rich bidirectional exchange between philosophy and\nimmunology has been established over a long tradition. \nThe basic schema of vertebrate immunity consists of two evolutionary\ndistinct ways to perceive the organism’s external environment\nand to monitor its inner state. The first modality, more primitive and\nless refined in its perceptive mechanisms, is referred to as the\n“innate” or “natural” immune system. This arm\nof immunity is composed of a variety of primordial\nphagocytes—“eating cells”—possessing\ndistinctive characteristics based on their tissue distribution. They\ningest particulate microbes and destroy effete, cancerous, and damaged\nhost cells. These immunocytes constitute the first line of the immune\nencounter and comprise the “resting” state of\nphysiological immunity as they “police” on-going processes\nof surveillance and restoration. This system has autonomous functions,\nbut the incorporation of antigen (a substance that stimulates an\nimmune response) may also lead to integration with the second mode of\nimmunity, the so called, “acquired” immune system. This\nsecond arm of immunity has evolved mechanisms that are highly specific\nin their recognition capabilities and exhibit immune\n“memory” of previous sensitization. Acquired immunity is\nmediated by several classes of lymphocytes that may be stimulated by\nphagocyte first-encounters or as primary responders under certain\npathological conditions. The B-lymphocytes produce antibody that\nrecognizes antigens by structural homology and, correspondingly,\nT-cells have specific antigen-matching receptors on their cell\nsurface. The initial recognition event leads to activation of a\nvariety of effector reactions that destroy the immune target. However,\nthe decision not to respond is also a recognition event and results in\nimmune “tolerance”. Both the innate and acquired immune\ncellular elements are regulated by a vast array of soluble molecular\nfactors that serve to either activate or dampen immune responses. The\ncomplexity of diverse cell types, the mediators of their interactions,\nthe contextual determinants that determine immune reactivity, and the\nwide range of physiological functions in which immunity participates,\nhas defied comprehensive modeling. Consequently, immunology offers a\nfecund example of biological organizational complexity, which, in\nturn, leads to the fundamental philosophical question: On what basis\nis organismal identity established and maintained? \nImmunology, from its earliest inception, has been concerned with\nbiological identity—its establishment and maintenance.\nIn its original iteration, immunity was conceived as that function\nthat preserved the integrity of the organism in terms of\nprotecting and restoring its individuality. Thus, immune\nfunctions testified to the persistence of a stable, core identity\ndefined in terms of its insularity and autonomy. Indeed,\nindividuality undergirded the science from its inception, for\nthe defense against pathogens was framed by an attacked patient\n(individual) pitted against alien others, the invaders. In this\nscenario, distinct borders mark individual identity, and immunity is\nthe response to the violation of those boundaries. However, challenges\nto this conception of immunity have recently appeared. Emphasizing the\ncontextual placement of the organism, notions of demarcated boundaries\nthat have characterized traditional definitions of the organism are\nbeing revised. \nGenerally understood, an individual replicates itself and possesses\nanatomic borders, a harmonious communication between its parts, a\ndivision of labor for the benefit of the whole, and a system of\nhierarchical dominance and control. By these criteria, the immune\nsystem is responsible for establishing and maintaining the integrity\nof such an individual (Pradeu 2016). However, symbiosis challenges\nthis entrenched definition of the individual organism: shared\nphysiologies govern homeostasis; anatomic margins lose clear\ndefinition; development is intertwined among several phylogenetically\ndefined entities; and the unit of evolutionary selection becomes a\nmultiplex genome (see the entry on\n the biological notion of individual).\n On this consortium view, notions of individuality are replaced with\ncomplexes of organisms that defy any singular definition of\norganismal identity as independent agents (Löwy 1991; S. Gilbert,\nSapp, and Tauber 2012). In terms of commensal relationships,\nsymbiosis, mediated by immune tolerance, signifies stabilized\nadaptation to the complex of diverse living elements that live in a\ncohesive ecology, both within and external to the traditional borders\nof the organism. When oriented by ecological relationships, immunology\nmoves from its dominant concern with autonomous individuality to\ninclude the science of cooperative assemblies of organisms. The\nontological implications of this re-formulation are highly significant\nfor philosophical considerations of identity as discussed below (see\nthe entry on\n identity). \nThe diachronic identity of an organism, its capacity to remain the\nsame despite transformations, has puzzled philosophers since ancient\nGreece. Aristotle postulated the existence of immutable forms, that,\nbeing distinct from fluctuating matter, ensure the continued identity\nof living creatures (Categories,\n3b22–33; Metaphysics, Book D).  Dissatisfied with this\nsolution, Locke proposed that temporal identity of animals and plants\nis not ensured by their unvarying forms, but rather by the continuity\nof their lived life (Locke 1689, II.27.4 and II.27.8; Kaufman\n2016). In the context of contemporary philosophy of biology, the\nimportance of continuous identity was emphasized by Hull who argued\nthat species lack essences and thus should be considered historical\nindividuals with their own inner coherence and persistence conditions\nnot unlike those of other living creatures (Hull 1978). He assumed\nthat these persistence conditions are provided by continuity of\nchanges in biological organization of these individuals so that only\nan abrupt disruption could cause a loss or change of identity (Hull\n1992; Hull 1978: 355).  This latter perspective has recently been\nadopted by advocates of animalism, who argue that continuity of\nphysiological processes (organic animalism) or maintenance of\ncharacteristic structural organization (somatic animalism) are\nnecessary for diachronic identity (Olson 1997; van Inwagen 1990;\nMackie 1999; see the entry on\n animalism). \nImmunology steps into the diachronic identity debate with\nBurnet’s hypothesis that during embryonic development, the\nimmune system learns to tolerate a defined set of molecules as\n“self” (Burnet 1959: 59). He proposed that autoreactive\nimmune cells (lymphocytes) were purged during embryonic development to\nleave only those lymphocytes that ignore specific antigens encountered\nduring this early stage (Burnet 1957). Defined negatively by a gap in\nthe lymphocyte repertoire, immunological selfhood was assumed to\npersist in the adult as an invariant molecular ‘essence’\nof the organism, analogous to an unwavering psychological ego (Burnet\n1959; Tauber 1994: 194). As observed by Pradeu and Carosella, this\nself/nonself model supported a substantialist view of identity in so\nfar as it presupposed that the immune system ensures integrity of a\npreserved metaphysical core (Pradeu and Carosella 2006a: 246). \nTo provide a distinct view of the immune system’s role in\ndiachronic identity, Pradeu advocates the so-called\n“genidentity” view (Pradeu 2018). On this view, two\nobjects are identical if their states are continuously connected over\ntime (Lewin 1922). To specify which continuous states ensure temporal\nidentity of an organism, Pradeu refers to those “immune\ninteractions [that] isolate some continuous biochemical interactions,\nwhich in turn individuate the organism” (Pradeu 2012:\n248–249). Accordingly, the immune system reacts to rapid\nmolecular alterations in the pattern of biochemical interactions and\nthus helps to ensure that these interactions are continuous and\nunperturbed. Of note, which continuous process should be followed to\ndefine diachronic identity is not observer independent and must be\nadjusted to a particular theoretical perspective (Guay and Pradeu\n2016: 318; Pradeu 2018). \nHowever, the idea that the immune system contributes to organismal\nidentity maintenance has to be weighed against evidence\nsuggesting that immunity contributes to the accommodation of\nchange. At the end of the nineteenth century, Metchnikoff\nproposed that phagocytes (primitive immune cells) were agents of\norganismal transformation, driving metamorphic and developmental\nalterations (Metchnikoff 1901 [1905]; Tauber and Chernyak 1991). This\nearly view has been supported by recent evidence that the immune\nsystem actively participates in mediating transformations in\norganismal identity by constantly redefining and modulating immune\nreactivity towards endogenous and exogenous molecules (Tauber 2017).\nThis is most apparent during development as illustrated by the\nactivity of brain-resident macrophages (microglia), which, by\nimpacting angiogenesis/vascularization, as well as the migration,\nproliferation and apoptosis of neurons, influence social behavioral\nand sexual identity (Wynn, Chawla, and Pollard.2013; Lenz and Nelson\n2018). \nTolerance of newly encountered antigens demonstrates the\n“fluid” state of the reactive immune repertoire that\nundergoes alteration over the lifespan of the organism (Grignolio et\nal. 2014). And with a changing “immune biography”,\nbiological identity no longer conforms to the simple binary division\nof self and nonself that has hitherto characterized immune\ntheorizing. Accordingly, animals have no immutable molecular essence\nthat would ensure persistence of identity, at least as determined by\nimmune tolerance or rejection (León-Letelier, Bonifaz, and\nFuentes-Pananá 2019). Identity then becomes an ever-changing\nprocess of accepted transformations and rejected entries. From this\nvantage point, the animalist definitions of diachronic identity as a\nmere persistence of life or even an underlying constancy fails to\naccount for the dynamic quality of immune-mediated identity\ntransitions (van Inwagen 1990: 148–149; Olson 1997; Mackie 1999;\nRoy and Hebrok 2015; Dupré 2017). Consequently, the immune\nprocessual point of view defines organismal persistence as “a\ncoordinated group of changes” rather than as an\ninvariant state or a continuous connection between such states. This\nunderstanding has important implications for philosophy of biology and\nontology, more generally (Dupré 2014; Nicholson and Dupre 2018;\nMeincke 2018). \nWhile diachronic identity of an organism is understood as its\npersistence though time, synchronic identity is defined in\nterms of its individuality or distinctiveness (Sober 2000: 154).\nAttempts have been made to identify distinguishing characteristics\nsuch as functional autonomy, possession of mutually interdependent\nparts, genetic homogeneity and spatial boundaries (Clarke 2010).\nOthers, pointing to the heterogeneous character of biological\nindividuals, have argued that no sole feature can serve as a universal\ndeterminant of individuality (see the entry on\n the biological notion of individual).\n Part of the contention resides in differing frames of reference of\nstudy: Most considerations of synchronic individuality focus upon\nevolutionary individuals as units of selection (Gould and\nLloyd 1999) that differs from how physiological individuals\nmight be distinguished (Pradeu 2016). Regardless of their involvement\nin evolution, organisms exhibit various levels of physiological and\nmorphological integration that makes their indivisibility problematic\n(Godfrey-Smith 2009). Immunology contributes to discussions of\nindividuality in this latter sense by considering the role of the\nimmune system in defining the boundaries of the organism by the\nfunctional measures of rejection or assimilation. \nPradeu formulated such criteria and proposed that the immune system\nplays the central role in determining what is included in the organism\nand what is not (Pradeu 2012). The differentiation is based on his\ncontinuity/discontinuity model, which depicts the immune system\nreacting to transient alterations in the pattern of antigen receptor\ninteractions and tolerates long-lasting modifications (Pradeu, Jaeger,\n& Vivier 2013; Pradeu & Carosella 2006a: 241, 2006b). Such a\nmechanism is based on recognizing that autoimmunity is a normal\nfunction of immunity (Tauber 2015). Because host antigens do not evoke\nan immune response, a stable, “continuity” of immune\ninteractions establishes an activation threshold that initiates an\nimmune response only upon a rapid increase in antigenic load. The\nimmune system thus distinguishes the stable state of tolerant\nrecognition of tonic signals arising from normal physiological process\nin contrast to the appearance of novel antigens, for example, arising\nfrom pathogen invasion or tissue injury (Grossman and Paul 1992;\nMyers, Zikherman and Roose 2017; Pradeu 2012: 246; Grossman 2019).\nThus the development of tolerance to frequently encountered antigens,\ncommensals, tissue grafts and anastomosed animals results in the\nestablishment of stable, integrated associations mediated by low-grade\nimmune interactions (Pradeu and Carosella 2006a, 2006b; Pradeu 2012:\n251–252). In this formulation, the immune system plays a central\nrole in defining an individual by permitting beneficial physiological\ninclusion of heterologous components. \nOthers refer to these stable immune interactions with microbiota to\ndeny that organisms are individuals (S. Gilbert, Sapp, and\nTauber 2012). Appreciating the ubiquity of symbiosis, the immune\nsystem from this point of view becomes a key mediator of the holobiont\nby tolerating and coordinating microbial-host relationships. On this\nbasis, these critics highlight that most of these interactions fall on\na dynamic spectrum of rejection and acceptance making it impossible,\nin principle, to determine the boundaries of individuality.\nSymbiotic interactions do not conform to a simple acceptance-rejection\nmodel. Rather, to attune its responses to microbial signals the immune\nsystem launches a broad spectrum of T-cell reactions in combination\nwith a variety of innate immune and tissue cell-derived signals\n(cytokines, hormones, neurotransmitters) in combination with complex\nregulatory controls (Eberl 2016). As suggested by Cohen, immunity is\nthe product of an active computational state that constantly assesses\nthe state of the organism’s internal state and the surroundings\nin which it lives (Cohen 2007a, 2007b). In the context of such fluid\nactivity, transitioning from one unique activation state to another\ndoes not allow definitive delineation of organismal borders. Instead,\nthe immune system acts as gatekeeper that controls the apparent\nboundary between the organism and its environment (Tauber 2008: 231; Tauber 2017; S. Gilbert, Sapp, and Tauber 2012). From this perspective, the view of immunity as protecting insularity shifts to recognizing its role in establishing and maintaining communal\nrelationships that blur the distinction of an atomistic\ninsular individuality (Skillings 2016). \nThe self/nonself, tolerance/response dichotomies collapse altogether,\nwhen considered in the context of mammalian pregnancy, where various\nmodalities are employed to preserve the temporary immune sanctuary of\nthe ‘foreign’ fetus (Howes 2007; A. Martin 2010). Studies\nof immune-mediated exchanges between the mother and the fetus not only\nchallenge our view of immunity as concerned with rejection and\ndefense, but also transform our understanding of biological\nindividuality (Erlebacher 2013; Howes 2008). More specifically, recent\nstudies undermine the vision of the maternal immune system as\nantagonistic to the fetus and rather point to active immune\nparticipation in the formation of an amalgamated maternal-fetal\nindividual, whose ontological status lies at the continuum between\nunification and distinctiveness (Howes 2008). Delineation of the role\nof inflammation during blastocyst implantation further supports this\ninteractive vision, demonstrating that instead of acting as a\nrejection response, inflammation promotes a mutually tolerant fusion\nbetween the embryo and the mother (Griffith et al. 2017; Mor, Aldo,\nand Alvero 2017). Indeed, the transformation of an\ninflammation-induced reaction pathway into a cell differentiation\npathway in decidual stromal cells exhibits the intimate connection of\nthe immune and reproductive systems in eutherians (G. Wagner,\nErkenbrack, and Love 2019; Nuño de la Rosa, Pavlicev, and\nEtxeberria 2019, in Other Internet Resources). \nIn conclusion, despite significant contributions of philosophy of\nimmunology to debates about identity, no straightforward answer to the\nquestion of how the immune system contributes to biological\nindividuality has been offered. Considering the actual\nindividualization practices in various fields of biology, it may well\nbe concluded that no single account of the biological individual\nsuffices and that the question of whether particular criteria are\nvalid or not depends on the research perspective adopted. Part of the\nconundrum may lie in the efforts to consider the issue at the\nmetaphysical, rather than at the epistemological level (Love 2018,\nLove and Brigandt 2017). As discussed below, the status of the\n“immune self” is a fecund case in point. \nWide use of the self/nonself distinction in different clinical and\nresearch traditions (provided by the relaxed and varied meanings\nassociated with its use) has established such discrimination as the\ngoverning construct of the science (e.g., Howes 2010; Hoffman 2012;\nCohn 2015). Indeed, the “immune self” has served as\nimmunology’s foundational concept to order immune theorizing for\nthe past 70 years (Burnet and Fenner 1949; Tauber 1994). However,\ndespite the paradigm’s established standing, definition of\nimmune identity has proven elusive. As discussed above (section 2.1),\nbecause of fluctuations of immune activity over the lifespan of the\norganism, conceptualizing and modeling active tolerance have yet to\nyield criteria for defining stable identity (Bilate and LaFaille\n2012). Moreover, a consensus definition of selfhood has remained\nelusive inasmuch as different investigative frameworks promote\ndiffering characteristics of immune identity based on their respective\nstructural and functional criteria (Matzinger 1994). Critics have\ntherefore questioned the immune self’s standing and utility\n(e.g., Matzinger 1994; Tauber 2000; Pradeu 2012). The latter position\nargues that the “self” might be better regarded as only a\nmetaphor for a “figure” outlined by the immune\nsystem’s silence, i.e., its non-reactivity. Such a functionally\nflexible definition has been resisted. Defenders argue that the notion\nof stabilized discrimination correctly depicts the immune\nsystem’s organizing functions (which converge on defending a\nwell-demarcated organism), and that efforts to eliminate or modify\nthis metaphor are misguided attempts to “police” borders\nbetween science and culture (Anderson 2014; Hoffman 2012). Drawing\nfrom the philosophical canon, Howes referred to Hume to argue that\nrealism about self (immune or otherwise) can be saved despite the\ndependency of context and the ever-changing character of the\npostulated ego (Howes 1998). She suggested that the efforts to deny\nthe reality of the self are based on its non-substantial character and\nthus reflects entrenched substantialist assumptions. She proposed that\na middle ground exists between substantial self and no-self by\nadopting a processual, understanding of selfhood (Howes 1999). \nWhile the standing of the immune self has remained contentious,\nepistemological ambiguity and flexible polysemy has proven effective\nin sustaining the term’s powerful heuristic value as an\nidiom with many uses and meanings (Crist and Tauber 2000).\nIts versatility and pragmatic utility have effectively integrated\nclinical immune phenomena by highlighting the essential similarity or\ninterconnectedness of diverse immune-mediated processes in response to\nvarious clinical challenges. Thus nutrition, allergy, infection,\nautoimmune disease, various phenomena of tolerance, natural or\nexperimentally created chimeras (transplantation), and autoimmunity\nall become conceived as a network of interlinked or interrelated\nfunctions subject to evolutionary transformation and adaption. As\nthese topics mirror and play off one another under the rubric of\nselfhood, immunologists have a ready means by which to represent\nstates or processes that arise in the various interactions between the\norganism and its environment at different evolutionary stages and\ndevelopment. \nFinally, the self’s appearance in immunology served as a readily\nunderstood shorthand reference to personal identity, and the efforts\nto substantiate that extrapolation on its own terms guided the\ndiscipline for the latter half of the twentieth century (for\nhistorical case studies see Löwy 1991). After all, beyond the\nexperimental science, the interpretative context of immune selfhood\ndraws from wider social meanings of individuality and insularity\n(Tauber 2016; see below, section 5.0). The autonomous construction of\nidentity resonates with Western civic ideals and in turn supports them\nby melding laboratory findings with various extrapolated or borrowed\nphilosophical, political and psychological formulations of human\nagency. And conversely, immunology has been studied as a source of\nimportant metaphors and other tropes feeding back on the\nscience’s supporting culture to transform understanding of\nagency and communal relationships (discussed below, section 5.0). \nImmunology’s basic conceptual orientation is undergoing\nexpansion from an individuality-based biology to include communal\necological perspectives. Similar shifts in perspective have also taken\nplace in other fields of biology (Nathan 2014; van Baalen and Huneman\n2014), and thus immunology joins a proliferation of\n“sub-organismal” environmental studies that would\nintegrate ecology with developmental biology, physiology, cancer\nbiology, molecular eco-systems, and eco-immunology (S. Gilbert and\nEpel 2015; Karasov, Martínez del Rio, and Caviedes-Vidal 2011;\nMaley et al. 2017; Tauber 2017). This emerging perspective is\naccompanied by an increasing interest in somatic evolution occurring\nduring carcinogenesis, neurogenesis, microbiota development, and the\nadaptive immune responses. This shift has led to an abandonment of the\nclassical vision of the immune system directed at defense to now\ninclude tolerant mechanisms that permit assimilation and co-habitation\nthat reflect stabilized microbial-host relationships. In that\nre-orientation, concepts of pathogenicity and individuality have been\nre-defined. \nSo, although the concepts of immunity were developed primarily in the\ncontext of disease ecology, attention is shifting to symbiotic\necosystems. The exchanges the immune system mediates highlight context\nsensitivity of parasitism, commensalism and mutualism, and further\ndemonstrates the bidirectional dialogue between bacteria and the host\nin the mutual construction of their respective ecological niches. The\nproblem of immune evolution and clonal selection of lymphocytes is\nconsidered, in turn, to provide the most general account of natural\nselection. An important new issue concerns a set of problems\nassociated with the recently discovered adaptive immune system of\nbacteria, the CRISPR system, whose role in evolution poses novel\nchallenges to basic Darwinian principles (see section 3.2). \nThe ideas underpinning somatic ecology originate in the early view of\nsomatic cells behaving as social organisms forming stable associations\n(Reynolds 2018: 12–58). Assuming that such interactions serve\nthe welfare of the organism, Virchow and other authors described a\n“cell state” (or a “cell republic)”, a\nmetaphoric expression of what became a sociological model of cellular\ncommunication (Virchow 1858 [1863]; R. Wagner 1999; Reynolds 2018:\n86–113). And pathologically, such a consortium becomes a\n“civil war” of competing cell lines. The model then led to\na general Darwinian formulation of an internal struggle for\nexistence throughout the life of an individual (Roux 1881; Metchnikoff\n1901 [1905]; Tauber and Chernyak 1991; see Buss 1987; Queller and Strassmann 2009;\nGodfrey-Smith 2009 for the contemporary standing of this proposal of\nevolutionary change). Metchnikoff, a key advocate of this theory,\nassumed that cells operate on Darwinian principles similar to those\ngoverning the adaptation of organisms in changing environmental\nconditions. He thus introduced a common framework in which to\nunderstand dynamic biological communities—whether internal cell\nlines or organisms adjusting to their environment. This ecological\norientation altered basic conceptions of immunity and identity by\ndisplacing static notions of individuality with dialectical constructs\n(Levins and Lewontin 1985; Tauber 2008). \nThis ecological viewpoint serves to depict somatic and microbial cell\npopulations as systems of communication and information exchange. With\nthe change in focus from individuals to ecosystems, the classical\ndichotomies governing immunology’s theory, i.e.,\ntolerance/responsiveness, immune/non-immune, self/nonself, has been\nrevised. How these oppositions collapse in an information-based\necological format is illustrated by the phenomenon of inter-kingdom\nsignaling, a form of communication that not only bridges an\nevolutionary gap between microbes and host, but also helps to overcome\nputative boundaries between immune, epithelial, and neural systems\n(cf. Hughes and Sperandio 2008). When considered from the\nenvironmental perspective, the transition site between the genetic\nbody and its resident microbes is no longer a frontline of defense but\nrather an ecological ecotone, an interactive zone at which cellular\ncommunities engage in a dialogue to explore new adaptive opportunities\n(Tauber 2008). The importance of such interfaces is well illustrated\nby mutual scaffolding and niche construction strategies that are\nutilized by microbial symbionts and their hosts to direct development\nof larger ecological units (i.e., holobionts) (Chiu and S. Gilbert\n2015). \nStruggle and cooperation in the immune context were assumed since Koch\nto depend on intrinsic characteristics of invading microbes that, due\nto their virulence factors and other gene-encoded characteristics, act\nas pathogens, commensals or mutualists (Méthot and Alizon\n2014). By accounting for a larger context of the immune encounter, the\necological position challenges this vision by offering a view in which\n“there are no pathogens, no commensals, and no opportunists;\ninstead there are only microbes and hosts that interact”\nunpredictably (Casadevall and Pirofski 2015). In this scenario,\nmicrobial virulence becomes an emergent property, dependent on host\nand microbial factors, whose interactions cannot be derived from first\nprinciples (Casadevall, Fang, and Pirofski 2011). \nIn sum, the ecological view has led to the view that boundaries\nbetween parasitism, commensalism and mutualism are changeable and\nfluid, dependent on host factors, the full microbiota, and the broader\nenvironmental context (temperature, nutrients, etc.) (Méthot\nand Alizon 2014). Current views of plasticity, pathogenicity, and\nvirulence revitalizes the nineteenth-century concept of microbial-host\nequilibrium (Méthot 2012). In the context of disease ecology,\nlong-lasting associations between hosts and parasites leads to a\nclimax state in which the respective populations remain stable (Burnet\nand White 1972; Anderson 2004). The immune equilibrium model then\ndepicts persistent viral colonization as a product of a “dynamic\nbut metastable equilibrium between the virome and the host”\n(Virgin, Wherry, and Ahmed 2009; Eberl 2010). Thus, the modern idea of\nbalance highlights a stable state in which offensive and\ndefensive forces neutralize one another to form stable associations\nbetween parasites and the host with little damage to either partner\n(Swiatczak 2014). \nThe environmental perspective not only refers to the application of\necological and evolutionary knowledge to immune modeling, but also\nincludes lessons learned from studies of immunity that reciprocally\ninform current understanding of evolution. How these findings shed\nlight on the character of evolutionary change is well illustrated by\nthe research of inheritable immune variation. The origin of variation\nhas been subject to much debate in philosophy of biology. Advocates of\nthe view that nonrandom, environmentally induced factors are involved\nin the generation of inheritable variation cite evidence of\nstress-induced mutagenesis, horizontal gene transfer, and non-genetic\nsystems of inheritance (Koonin 2012: 257–291). Such discoveries\nsuggest that organisms may enhance their own adaptation to altered\nenvironmental conditions epigenetically (Jablonka and Lamb 2014; J.\nShapiro 2011). Specialized diversification and recombination\nmechanisms that are used by organisms to enhance their own adaptation\nare considered Lamarckian in so far as the response to specific\nenvironmental cues leads to alterations of phenotypic features, and\nthese adaptive characteristics may be transmitted to succeeding\ngenerations (Sarkar 1991; Depew and Weber 1996). Notwithstanding\nevidence for such mechanisms, postulated non-random mechanisms of\nevolution have been disputed by those who claim that appeals to\nLamarckism are misguided and stem from mis-interpreting the\nNeo-Darwinian synthesis or from overlooking genes as the basic units\nof selection (Merlin 2010; Weiss 2015). With a focus on rapidly\nadapting and evolving cell populations, immunological studies provide\na unique opportunity to investigate evolution in real time and to\nunderstand the role of non-random, inheritable alterations of the\nphenotype. \nExamination of adaptive immunity in prokaryotes provides a major\nbreakthrough in this controversy. Many bacteria and most Archaea\nundergo non-random changes directed at devising protection from\ninvasive bacteriophages and mobile genetic elements (Horvath and\nBarrangou 2010). These microbes use specialized methods of defense,\nCRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)-Cas\n(CRISPR-associated protein) systems to incorporate foreign DNA\nfragments into their genomes (Koonin 2019). These become templates for\nthe formation of RNA molecules, which when associated with\nendonuclease enzymes, mediate destruction of the complementary,\nforeign DNA fragments. These acquired adaptive changes are a direct\nconsequence of the organism’s interactions with the environment,\nand, because these modifications can be passed on to succeeding\ngenerations, the CRISPR-Cas system has been suggested to operate on\nLamarckian principles, an interpretation that has been contested\n(Koonin 2012: 265; Koonin 2019; Pradeu 2019). Although not conforming to the neo-Darwinian model, this system lacks the teleological character postulated by Lamarck, and thus should be considered, at most, a model of directed mutagenesis (Wideman et al. 2019; Woolley et al. 2019; Weiss 2015).\nOthers counter that a continuum of Lamarckian-Darwinian mechanisms\nexists in nature and that CRISPR-Cas represents a genuine case of\nLamarckinism (Jablonka 2019; Koonin and Wolf 2016). Advocates of this latter interpretation place CRISPR-Cas systems among other apparently Lamarckian mechanisms like those mediating epigenetic inheritance\n(Gissis and Jablonka 2011). \nHighlighting the importance of directed mutagenesis and programmed\ngene rearrangements in evolution, these studies potentially revise\ndominant theories of adaptation. Indeed, such genetic changes operate\nin the vertebrate adaptive immune system: The first exposure of\nantigen leads to selection of a diverse population of lymphocytes,\neach carrying antigen receptors of a single specificity with varying\ndegrees of affinity for the newly introduced antigen; the stochastic\nbut coordinated assembly of gene segments determines receptor binding\nfitness (Tonegawa, et al. 1974; Podolsky and Tauber 1997). Higher\ndegrees of specificity arise through a class of lymphocytes (B cells),\nwhose activation by a specific antigen induces further variation and\nselection. This mechanism exhibits hypermutation, in which rearranged\nantigen receptor genes are subjected to scattered, random point\nmutations to permit rapid selection of a cell variant with an enhanced\nbinding fitness. As the process of hypermutation acts on pre-selected\ncells to improve adaptive fit of their receptors, its outcomes are\npartially biased, failing to exactly fit into the Neo-Darwinian scheme\n(cf. Dobzhansky 1970). Thus, in the course of antigenic exposure, the\npopulation of lymphocytes that recognize a newly introduced antigen\ncollectively generates an increasingly effective pool of responsive\ncells by fine-tuning the specificity of immune receptors, a process\nthat exemplifies non-random selection and adaptation (Simon,\nHollander, and McMichael 2015). \nFurther revising our understanding of adaptation is the observation that maternal antibodies may be passed on to descendants, allowing progeny to inherit some of the acquired immune characteristics of their parents. An example of such vertical immune transfer has been found in\nstudies of the composition of the microbiota mothers pass on to the\ninfant through vaginal and breastfeeding routes that program the\nnewborn’s immune system and metabolism (Mueller et al. 2015;\nGomez de Agüero et al. 2016). By molding the composition of its\nmicrobiota during pregnancy, the mother’s immune system\nengineers its environment by constructing a microbial model for her\noffspring (Chiu and S. Gilbert 2015; Mueller et al. 2015). When dysbiotic\nmicrobial populations are transmitted by obese mothers, their\nmetabolic abnormalities and associated pro-inflammatory phenotype are\nimprinted upon their children (Soderborg et al. 2018; Ley et al.\n2005). Due to the reliance on microbial niche construction, the\nacquisition of an infant’s immune characteristics is an instance\nof ecological inheritance, where transmission of selective pressures\nfrom one generation to another pre-sets the process of the\nprogeny’s adaptation to the environment (Odling-Smee, Laland,\nand Feldman 2003; Odling-Smee et al. 2013; Chiu and S. Gilbert 2015).\nAlterations in this ecological mode of immune transmission in humans\nby C-section or administration of antibiotics may compromise the\nhealth of the child and thus predispose them to a variety of\nimmune-related disorders (e.g., allergy and autoimmunity) (Bokulich et\nal. 2016). Thus, adaptive immunity exhibits various modalities in which variation may be generated and transferred from one generation to another. These findings challenge traditional Darwinian and Lamarckian categories, with wide-ranging ramifications. \nFinally, immunology contributes to a general account of selection\n(Darden and Cain 1989; Hull, Langman, and Glenn 2001). The clonal\nselection theory (CST), the foundational framework of modern\nimmunology, states that the immune system relies on a Darwinian-like\nprocess of selection to permit differential expansion of lymphocytes,\nwhose receptors are fitted to bind an antigen (Burnet 1959). Analogies\nbetween CST, natural selection theory, and selective theories in\nneuroscience have been generally regarded as examples of “a\nselection type theory” (Darden and Cain 1989). CST has also been\ncompared to other selective theories to elaborate a general vision\nof selection as cycles of replication, variation and environmental\ninteraction (Hull, Langman, and Glenn 2001). Such a general account of\nselection would not only elucidate the most fundamental principles of\nevolution, but would also serve as a guide for future selective\ntheories, e.g., neural group selection (cf. Edelman 1974, 1987).\nDifferences between selection theories have also been recognized and\nsuggest that unlike evolution of species, selection in somatic systems\n(in particular the neural system) does not fully account for the\nadaptation of the developing populations (Dumouchel 1996). More\ngenerally, Piattelli-Palmarini suggested that such a general scheme\ncould be of use in cognitive science and linguistics, as well as in\nother disciplinary domains outside of biology (Piattelli-Palmarini\n1986). \nCase studies of immunology have contributed to understanding the role\nof models and the structure of theory in the biomedical sciences (see\nthe entry on\n models in science).\n For example, Schaffner provided detailed analysis of the clonal\nselection theory and the two-component theory of the immune response\nto elaborate his criticism of the classical view of scientific\ntheories and to provide an account in which middle range theories,\nconsisting of interrelated theoretical models, organize subject areas\nin biology (Schaffner 1980). A taxonomy of immune models (both\nconceptual and experimental) exhibit a mosaic of methodologies and\ntheoretical ways in which information is obtained and integrated in\nthis field (Baetu 2014). Furthermore, high throughput sequencing\ntechniques and other “omics” approaches in immunology,\nlike those of microbial ecology, are increasingly utilizing new\nanalytical tools (cf. Huss 2014). In conjunction with systems biology\napproaches, these tools inspire engineering orientations, in which\nbiological systems achieve robustness and stability through the same\nprinciples with which machines are built, namely using system controls\n(e.g., feedback), redundancy (e.g., gene duplication, alternative\nmetabolic pathways), modular design (to minimize damage to local\nunits), and structural stability (Kitano 2001: 18). Apart from serving\nas an exemplar of systems-based theories and models, immunology has\nalso been employed to develop cognitivist models, elucidate conceptual\nand theoretical change in biology, and elaborate on contentious issues\nabout reductionism and anti-reductionism. \nThe rise of the cognitive paradigm in immunology originated in\nconceiving the immune system as a faculty of perception. Immunologists\nexplicitly describe macrophages “seeing” antigen;\nantibodies “recognizing” epitopes; T cell possessing\n“memory”; and adaptive immunity comprising a\n“learning” process. Such extensions from human psychology\nhave been widely utilized in evolutionary history (Margulis,\nAsikainen, and Krumbein 2011), wherein basic categories of human\ncognition have been extrapolated to animals (Bekoff, Allen, and\nBurghardt 2002), bacteria (Ben Jacob et al. 2004; Ben Jacob, Shapira,\nand Tauber 2005), cancer cells (Ben Jacob, Coffey, and Levine 2012)\nand the immune system (Cohen 1992a, 1992b). The influence of the\ncognitive metaphor (where intention plays an incipient role) appears\nthroughout immune theory with extrapolations to cognitive science more\ngenerally (Varela 1994: 36; Varela et al. 1988; Varela and Coutinho\n1991; Vaz 2011b). \nModels of cognition in immune theorizing have been extended from human\ncognitive science and linguistics, where representational and\nanti-representationalist orientations have vied for dominance (Tauber\n2013). The dominant model regards the immune response integrating two\nsteps: First, the immune system perceives molecular targets and then\n“decides” how to react (Cohen 1992a). Accordingly,\n“perception” is primary and effector functions (activation\nor tolerance) follow along a spectrum of responses. This understanding\nof immune cognition construes immunity as an information-processing\nfaculty, where immune activity becomes a computational process\ninvolving algorithmic transformation of an antigenic input into an\neffector output (Cohen 2007b). \nThis cognitivist orientation is of special interest to philosophers,\nin so far as such an examination provokes questions concerning the\nontological status of intentionality, the role of representation, and\nthe character of cognitive processing in general. Indeed,\nimmunology’s cognitive models carry the promise of revitalizing\nsome of the key issues prevalent in cognitive science by placing them\ninto the context of a system whose circulating components interact in\na probabilistic manner (Varela et al. 1988; Tauber 2017:\n129–161; Cohen 2000: 57–99). Such a “fluid\nbrain” carries wide-ranging theoretical implications (Fridman\n1991). \nShared nervous-immune system organizational characteristics have been\nproposed (Nataf 2016). As in the visual processing areas of the brain,\nwhere distinct features of a visual object (shape, color, motion) are\nperceived separately by distinct neuronal populations (C. Gilbert\n2013), the immune system utilizes dedicated cells and receptors to\nprocess fragmentary signals that discern distinct features of its\nenvironment (Swiatczak, Rescigno, and Cohen 2011). These signals are\nthen integrated by higher-level processing, which, by computing\ninformation from their respective “receptive fields”,\nproduce a unified representation of the antigen. Such a distributed\nimage parallels activities of higher cortical areas. So, analogous to\nthe nervous system, the immune system perceives immune objects by\nassembling discrete signals (immunogens, cytokines, chemokines, etc.)\nobtained as informational elements derived from various cell types,\nwhich, in an ascending integration, generate a multitude of T-cell and\nB-cell responses (Nataf 2016). In this schema, the integrative process\noccurring in lymphoid aggregates is the functional equivalent to the\nbrain that employs an analogous hierarchal structure to process\ninformation. Indeed, the nervous and immune systems are highly\nintegrated, both physiologically and anatomically. They share many of\nthe same messenger molecules, have close developmental histories both\nin phylogeny and ontogeny, and intersect biochemically (Ader\n2006). \nThe so-called “psycho-neuro-endocrine system” has a\nwell-established fourth partner in the immune system showing that its\nactivity cannot be understood in isolation from these other systems.\nThe models employed in one cognitive system are readily shared by the\nother and thus propagate underlying theoretical approaches and\nimplicit directives. Postulating molecular-level and systems-level\nrecognition states carries notions of “intentionality”\n(see the entry on\n intentionality).\n Alternatively, instrumentalist and eliminativist approaches argue\nthat intentional descriptions are either only constructs of a useful\nidiom or that they should be dropped altogether (Dennett 1987;\nChurchland 1989). Intentional assignments reflect an ordering\nmechanism for phenomena otherwise difficult to characterize and thus\nsusceptible to error (Matthen and Levy 1984). Errors must be\nunderstood in terms of reference to what end a system actually\nseemingly intends versus what it achieves in given\ncircumstances. In the immune setting, autoimmunity signifies a\ndysregulated state that, in this context, signifies mis-directed\nintentionality of normal immune function (Matthen and Levy 1984: 361).\nAny attempt to frame this process in non-intentional terms would fail,\nas such descriptions do not invoke goals, expectations, unfulfilled\nintentions and the like. Accordingly, immunology cannot dispense with\nthe intentional idiom and the associated psychological metaphors used\nin its descriptive language, if even only as a heuristic device\n(Rosenberg 1989: 38; Melander 1993: 239; Howes 2000). Strong arguments\nhave been made that metaphors in the life sciences act as\nindispensable instruments of cognition and explanation in addition to\nproviding a useful perspective on a research subject (Reynolds 2018).\nIndeed, despite neo-positivistic efforts to rid science of nonliteral\nmeanings to permit an objective (neutral) description of nature,\nanalogical thinking in science plays a variety of crucial epistemic\nfunctions (Hesse 1966; Fox Keller 2002). \nAdvocates of representationalist approaches to immune cognition accept\nthe subject-object dichotomy that portrays the immune system as a\n“knower”, an agent, who can represent the state of its\ninner and other environments (Tauber 2013). This has become a\nwell-entrenched orientation inasmuch as the ontological understanding\nof key concepts in immunology—self, individuality, and\norganism—revolves around the status of agency\nin immune theorizing. As already mentioned, from the very inception of\nthe discipline, immunologists have either assumed an implicit identity\nthat grounds the distinction between self and foreign, or that\nidentity is explicitly described as an agent at the heart of immune\ndefense. Traditionally associated with the capacity of an intentional,\nconscious being to act (see the entry on\n agency),\n agency has been redefined in philosophy of immunology to refer to the\nsource of immune activity. \nThe capacity of the immune system to create representative images\n(through ligand-receptor structural homology) and to act on them does\nnot mean that this system hosts a centralized control unit. Rather, as\nadvocates of these information-based accounts suggest, immune agency\nemerges from collective behavior of individual immune cells, each of\nwhich acts as a “cellular computing machine” (Cohen and Efroni 2019). From this point of view, the apparent complex\n“intelligence” of the immune system is a product of multiple cues originating from individual immune cells that function analogously to\njoint decisions made by a school of fish. From this cognitive point\nview, immunity arises from shared collective information. \nA distinct group of philosophical problems stems from\nanti-representationalist approaches to immune cognition. Advocates of\nthe so-called immune network theory challenge the classical\nsubject-object epistemology as a relationship between the knower and\nthe known that heretofore has dominated immune theory (Varela 1994:\n39). Heralding a shift “from an antigen-centered immunology to\nan organism-centered immunology”, this view maintains that\nimmune agency requires neither representation nor unified control\n(Varela 1991). Instead of a hierarchical organizational format, this\nde-centered orientation rests on the architecture of the network\ntheory proposed by Niels Jerne (Jerne 1974). He theorized that if\nantibodies of an individual are diverse enough to bind any\nantigen, they also are capable of recognizing one another. Simply,\ntheir mutual interactions must precede any exogenous antigen encounter. Thus, a binding site of one antibody could serve as an antigen to another antibody, which in turn may become the target to still another antibody to create a self-contained, inter-locking\nlattice-like network (Jerne 1985). He further proposed that excitatory\nand inhibitory forces resulting from antibody interactions establish\nan equilibrium state, which, unless upset by an intruding antigen,\nensures stable immune dynamics. Thus, according to Jerne’s\nhypothesis, the immune system is a self-referential network made up of\nmolecules that represent one another and whose reactions against\ninvasive pathogens were only the incidental result of\nequilibrating mechanisms that restore stable network dynamics. \nIn the network schema, cognition is not of something;\nperception is entirely within the system itself; the agent has\nvanished, and with that vacancy, representations are discarded (Vaz\nand Varela 1978: 238; Mingers 1991; Coutinho 2003; Palacios and\nBacigalupo 2003; Vaz 2011a). After all, what requires a\nre-presentation? In Jerne’s system, no hierarchy\nexists, and no cognitive center corresponding to company headquarters.\nInstead, what heretofore was referred to as activation resulting from\na subject-object predicate structured cognitive event (described by\nstimulus-response language) now refers to increased dynamic activity\nthat is due to the disruption of the network’s equilibrium.\nAccordingly, immune “knowledge” shifts from a\nsignifier–signified relationship to one in which meaning is\nfirmly lodged within the system itself. Simply, the\nsubject-object epistemological structure of cognition has been\nradically revamped. \nJerne’s provocative hypothesis, although elegant in conception\nand effective in inspiring new avenues of research, did not withstand\ncritical evaluation (Eichmann 2008; Vaz 2011a, 2011b). Despite\nconfirming the presence of idiotypic antibodies (i.e., mutually\ninteracting immunoglobulin molecules), their role and overall\ncontribution to immune functions remained uncertain. Furthermore, the\nidea of autonomy and closure contradicted empirical evidence\n(Hershberg and Efroni 2001; Coutinho 2003). However, notions of\ncognition without agency remained plausible. Pradeu and colleagues\nsimilarly proposed that the state of the immune system is structured\nby inter-connected elements, where activation results from\nperturbations of the stable linkages of the resting state (Pradeu and\nCarosella 2006a, 2006b; Pradeu, Jaeger, and Vivier 2013). The original\n“network” theory focused upon the inter-actions of the\nimmune system’s constituents, (Jerne 1974), while the\n“continuity” theory employs an architecture of\nantigenic-immune interactions (Pradeu 2012, 2018; Grossman and Paul\n2015). When the immune system is regarded from this\n“connected” perspective, tolerance is the result of a\nstable continuity of interactions between an antigen and its\nreceptors. Thus, integrated states are quiescent and disrupted ones,\nwhether “foreign” or endogenous, generate immune\nactivation by breaking stabilized associations. \nIn addition to antigen/receptor dynamics, other factors are also\ninvolved in delineating the scope of tolerable changes in the\norganism. These include a self-regulated system of diverse\ninteractions among several immune components comprising a complex system of antigen-presenting cells, effector T and B lymphocytes, regulatory cells and a diverse soup of molecular signals\n(Kim, Levy, and Lee 2009; Kidd et al. 2014). So, the functional\ndifference that determines recognition of the foreign results not only\nfrom an aggregate of quantitative ligand-receptor affinity\ndifferences, but also from the context in which the antigen is seen\nand the degree of interruption in network dynamics induced by such an\nimmunogen (Cohen 2000a; Cohen and Efroni 2019). Accordingly, the\noverall function of the immune system may be defined as maintenance of\nmolecular (antigenic) homeostasis (Poletaev, Stepanyuk, and Gershwin\n2008). On this general view, a systems-wide collective\nresponse—not the discriminatory power of individual lymphocytes\nor their receptors—determines identity and immune\nspecificity. \nThe so-called “ecological” perspective offers still another\nmodel of cognition, where the immune system does not employ\nrepresentations of the world, but rather “sees” the world\ndirectly (Tauber 2017: 151–156, 219–228). In this\n‘presentational’ schema, the capacity to extract\ninformation about the environment depends on pre-programmed systems of\nperception, whose organizational structures “resonate”\nwith environmental inputs (Gibson 1966; 1979). Accordingly, the\nenvironment’s informational content results from the stimulation\nof the system that already has the ability to acknowledge inputs of a\nrecognizable character. Simply, information is only that which is\nalready meaningful (Ben-Ze’ev 1993: 70–71; Gibson\n1979). This scheme would reconfigure the subject-object epistemology\ndominating current immune theory with an information-processing\nfaculty that dispenses with some knowing entity, who sits in a\n“Cartesian theater” to observe the world (Dennett\n1991). Drawing an analogy from collective colony behaviors of insects\n(Gordon 2001; Bonabeau 2001) and bacteria (Ben Jacob, Becker, Shapira,\nand Levine 2004; Ben Jacob, Shapira, and Tauber 2005), the immune\nsystem may then be modeled without centralized control or directives\nby simply following its “rules” of regulation. Such a\nmodel of “embedded” cognition holds that perception may be\nexplained independently of computational processes or representations\naltogether (L. Shapiro 2011). Simply, presentational cognition\nsubstitutes an agent, who employs representations, for a process in\nwhich the immediacy of perception removes any such intermediary.\nAccordingly, cognition is not of something, for perception is\nentirely within the system itself; the agent has disappeared, and with\nthat vacancy, representations are discarded. \nAs with Jerne’s system, in presentational cognition, no\nhierarchy exists, and no cognitive center is posited. The\nstimulus–response model has been discarded and activation\nheretofore understood as resulting from a predicate-structured\ncognitive event now refers to increased dynamic activity that results\nfrom the disruption of the network’s equilibrium. Immune\n“knowledge” accordingly shifts from a\nsignifier–signified relationship to one in which meaning is\nfirmly lodged within the system itself, i.e., a system that “knows” only itself.\nTo the extent immunology would fashion itself along these lines, the\nconception of the self partitioned from the world would be replaced by\nan agent-free information-forming and information-processing faculty\n(Orosz 2001; Forrest and Hofmeyr 2001). Such a distributed information\nprocessing system has two key features:  \nThus, paralleling current trends in other philosophical disciplines,\nphilosophy of immunology draws from, and contributes to, parallel\nstudies in the cognitive sciences that address the general problems of\nagency, cognition, and behavior. \nApart from elucidating issues pertaining to identity, individuality\nand agency of an organism in its broader ecological and evolutionary\nhistory, philosophy of immunology also contributes to discussions\nabout the origin, organization, and methods of biological knowledge.\nReflecting on explanatory practices of immunology, the epistemic\nmodality has an important practical dimension that contributes to\ndeveloping methodological strategies and conceptual tools to handle\nthe complexity of the immune system. Genomic, proteomic and\ntranscriptomic studies are producing vast amounts of immune data with\nlittle understanding of the basic organization and regulation that\nmust integrate systems-level and molecular-level approaches (Ohno\n1990; Schatz and Langmead 2013; see the entry on\n genomics and postgenomics). \nThe shift from a focus on the insularity and autonomy of the organism\nto its integration within a complex consortium of species carries a\ncontrasting holistic orientation to the reductivism characterizing the\nmolecularization of immunology (Ulvestad 2007: 65–67). The\ntheoretical implications and practical methodological re-direction\nindicate a re-alignment of research strategies for immunology and,\nmore generally, an important contribution to the larger debates\nconcerning the character and feasibility of non-reductionist research\nprograms in the life sciences (Kitcher 1984; Sarkar 1998; Wimsatt\n2007). Initially focused on the question of the relationship between\nclassical genetics and molecular biology, these debates have turned to\nexplanatory strategies in distinct biological subdisciplines, such as\nneuroscience (Craver 2005), ecology (Dupré 1993), systems\nbiology (Wolkenhauer and Green 2013) and developmental biology (Love\n2008; see the entry on\n developmental biology).\n Still awaiting broader recognition as an exemplar of explanatory\npractices in life sciences, immunology already serves as a case study\nto approach the problem of reduction and holism in biology and\nmedicine. \nDifferent models of epistemic reduction have been considered with\nlittle consensus about the applicability of this type of explanation\n(Sarkar 1998). Dissatisfaction with models of theory reduction led to\nvarious models of explanatory reduction that, unlike\ndeductive-nomological accounts, consider relationships between\nepistemic units other than theories containing laws, while relying on\nan intuitive sense of reduction as an explanation of higher level\nfeatures in terms of their parts (see the entry on\n reductionism in biology).\n A dominant concern about reduction is the so called\n“many-many” relationships between levels of analysis,\nwhere biological features are context dependent and may vary due to\nheterogeneous lower level features (Hull 1974; Fodor 1974; S. Gilbert\nand Sarkar 2000). One approach maintains that non-reductionist\nexplanations should focus on gross “cytological” features\nof the studied phenomena rather than on lower level molecular\nprocesses (Kitcher 1984). In contrast to this approach, immunologists\nassume that reduction is an attempt to explain complex immune\nphenomena in terms of isolated parts and interactions without\ntaking into consideration the entirety of structural and functional\ncomplexities (Van Regenmortel 2002). Thus, instead of assuming that\nnon-reductionist explanations must ignore lower level molecular\ndetails, holistic immunologists attempt to understand the multilevel\ncomplexity of the immune phenomena they study (Rivas et al. 2017).\nAccordingly, non-reductionist descriptions do not attempt to remain on\na descriptive, biological level of understanding, but rather adapt\npluralistic approaches that integrate distinct dimensions and frames\nof reference, i.e., both molecular and higher orders of analysis. This\nperspective aligns with recent approaches in philosophy of biology\nthat move beyond the division of lower- and higher-level explanatory\nstrategies and highlight the importance of interdisciplinary\nintegration exhibited by current scientific practice (Brigandt 2010;\nLove and Lugar 2013). \nBoth reductive and holistic immunological research agendas have vied\nfor dominance (Silverstein 2009: 25–42). The immune-chemical\nprogram, championed by Ehrlich and other immunochemists of the first\nhalf of the twentieth century, examined immune reactions in terms of\nchemical and physical forces between immune receptors and their\nligands (Silverstein 2009: 456). These immunochemists were adopting a\n“unifactoralism” strategy that endeavors to explain\ncomplex biological processes in terms of single factors (Powell and\nDupré 2008). That program was modified and renewed by the\nelucidation of the genetics of antibody diversification, a series of\ndiscoveries that placed immunology well within the molecular biology\nrevolution (Podolsky and Tauber 1997). \nStudies of immunity coupled to developmental biology, ecology, and\nevolutionary biology have balanced the molecularization of immunology\nwith an organism-based orientation. Early advocates of such\napproaches, like Metchnikoff, described immunity in terms of cells and\ncellular interactions, a “biological” perspective extended\nby Burnet, who eclectically endeavored to include underlying molecular\nprocesses (Crist and Tauber 2000; Baxter 2006: 38). He presented\nimmunity in terms of adaptation, selection, and population-level cell\nbehavior, rather than solely in terms of chemical and physical\nmolecular reactions. As already discussed, this broadened perspective\nintroduced the ‘self’ into the immune lexicon and brought\nnew figurative language associated with agency and a host of meanings\nborrowed from other human experience. And, complementing these\nholistic explanatory and narrative strategies, he also postulated the\nexistence of molecular signatures of self and considered lymphocyte\nreceptors as independent decision-makers mediating immune reactions\nbased on their physical fit with cognate antigens (Burnet 1969). Thus,\nby representing cases of theoretical integration and explanatory\nheterogeneity, epistemic strategies adopted by Burnet and other\norganism-oriented immunologists fit into the inclusion of of plurality\nand unification increasingly regarded as necessary to capture the\ncomplexity of immune functions (cf. Dupré 1993; Mitchell 2003;\nPlutynski 2013). \nMore recently, attempts to integrate molecular biology with systems\nanalysis challenge the apparent conflict between reductionist and\nholist strategies (Green et al. 2017; Mazzocchi 2012). After all,\nattempts to explain complex immunological phenomena in terms of\nisolated parts and interactions without taking into consideration the\nentirety of structural and functional complexity that these phenomena\nexhibit have been ineffective. For example, vaccine development\nstudies, when limited to investigation of the structural correlates of\nantigen-antibody interaction without deeper understanding of the\ndynamic features of a host-pathogen encounter, often prove\nunsuccessful (Van Regenmortel 2002). So, instead of assuming that\nnon-reductionist explanations must ignore lower level molecular\ndetails, system-oriented immunologists attempt to understand the\nmultilevel complexity of the immune reactions they study (Rivas et al.\n2017). Dynamical systems theory and a variety of network-based\napproaches are used in systems biology to integrate distinct levels of\nanalysis and elucidate the complexity of the biological phenomena in question\n(Green et al. 2017). Accordingly, a pluralistic approach that attends\nto distinct dimensions and frames of reference, i.e., both molecular\nand higher orders of analysis, has directed recent efforts to\nintegrate the complexity immunity (Löwy 2008: 172; see entry on\n philosophy of systems and synthetic biology).\n However, the program of melding the reductionist and holistic methods\nas complementary to each other has been slowed by both technical and\nconceptual hurdles (Fang and Casadevall 2011). How to model the system\nas a system requires the collection of information about the\ntotality of interactions to explain causal mechanisms with multiple\ninputs and stochastic outcomes. No approach has achieved dominance\nand, consequently, the question of how massive data might be\nincorporated into a systems-wide comprehensive model comprises a key\nchallenge of contemporary immunology. \nAnti-foreign imagery in immunology provides an excellent case study of\nbidirectional links between science and society (Tauber 1994, 2016;\nHowes 1999). The wide acceptance of the self-nonself discrimination\nmodel derived from the paradigmatic host-pathogen struggle that\nexemplified the nineteenth century conceptualization of the body as\nisolated from the environment. As developed by Claude Bernard, this\ninsular construct provided biology a theoretical foundation for\norganismal biology that complemented Malthusian economics, liberal\npolitical philosophy, and Comtian sociology to instantiate the\nautonomous body as a political, social, economic and medical entity\n(Foucault 1963 [1973]; Agamben 1998). Notwithstanding that\n“independence” is a political term, Bernard’s notion\nof autonomy fails to fairly represent the dialectical relationships of\nthe organism and its environment (Levins and Lewontin 1985), nor the\nevolutionary peculiarities of individuality itself (Buss 1987). \nThe depiction of the immune self as disconnecting the organism from\nits surroundings harmonized with a particular Western cultural\nexperience of seeing “ourselves as entities, separate from the\nrest of the world—as containers with insides and outsides”\n(Lakoff and Johnson 1980: 58; Fleck 1935 [1979: 174–175]).\nHowever, this extrapolation of a particular Western notion of\nsubjectivity may well be regarded a social construct (Mead 1962)\ninasmuch as cross-cultural analysis reveals how the ancient Chinese\nsensed self more like a fluid interface than as an enclosed entity\n(Geaney 2011). And contemporary anthropological studies re-confirm how\nnotions of selfhood vary between cultures (e.g., Roland 1988). From\nthis perspective, social connotations and subjective experiences go\nhand in hand with creating meaningful images of immunity and\nbiological identity. Finding its fertile soil in the fifties, the idea\nof the demarcated organism squarely fit the valorization of\nindividualism that had diffused into Western arts, politics and\nscience during this period (Barbour 1995). An insular understanding of\n“the self” at the core of these atomistic\ncharacterizations lies at the foundation of immune theory and\npractice, where contemporary psychological and philosophical\nconstructions of identity based on autonomous individuality prevail\n(Tauber 1994). \nHowever, culture critics have seized on immunology’s notions of\nautonomy as exemplifying modern notions of identity, where boundaries\nare contested, and the body becomes the localized site of battle\nbetween self and other (Sontag 1990; Haraway 1989; E. Martin 1994).\nThese commentators cite the recognized permeability of living\ncreatures, their symbiotic exchanges, and tolerance of myriad\nassimilated foreign materials to challenge the origin and cultural\nresonance of the atomistic framework. David Napier has characterized\nour “age of immunology” as an individualism marked by a\npreoccupation with the self and by an absence of transforming efforts\nto incorporate the foreign (Napier 2003). Active rejection enunciated\nwith warfare metaphors so prevalent in immunology’s\nlexicon—“attack”, “defense”,\n“invaders”—dramatically illustrate this formulation,\nboth in terms of the self/other dichotomy, as well as the privileged\nregard of individuality over community. On this view, the\n“immune self” appears as a metaphor to model Western\nculture, by invoking “immunization” as an explanatory\nmodel for understanding the core dynamics of post-industrial societies\n(Esposito 2011; Sloterdijk 2011). The metaphor’s wide\napplication—from religion and metaphysics to housing and\ncities—invokes the dialectics of borders and exchange,\nindividuality and communes, where the balance of intrusion and defense\nis invoked to characterize the “bubble” in which humans\nlive. Note, these interpretations closely resonate with the dynamics\nof immunity regarded ecologically, as discussed above.  \nThese contrasting applications of social descriptions to immunology\nreveal the ease by which the science may be employed for culture\ncriticism. But the exchange need not end with such contributions.\nHaving been implemented in the discourse of science, the imagery\nborrowed from the culture-at-large becomes transformed and then\nreturns to the social domain, impacting on portrayals of persons and\ntheir relationship with others (E. Martin 1994). On this view, the\nscience-culture exchange broadens the implications of understanding\nthe development of immune theory. For example, the political resonance\nof the self/nonself framework was evident in the context of a debate\non tissue incompatibility, whose depiction as innate and unchangeable\nharmonized with Burnet and Medawar’s elitist sympathies and\nopposition towards social Lamarckism (Lafferty 1995). The vision of\npersonhood that stood behind the self/nonself discrimination concept,\ncan be further traced back to Burnet’s self-confessed\n“harmless terror of strangers” and his\nDarwinist vision of human relationships as defined by primordial\nselfishness and incessant drives towards domination and power (Burnet\n1971: 12). Along with ongoing cultural and political transformations, our\nunderstanding of immune identity has also changed in the transition\nfrom a modernist vision of delineated selfhood towards a more complex view\nthat dispenses with the self altogether. Thus, the imagery that is\nused to represent the activity of the immune system has deep roots in\nthe broader culture that reflect dominant values and tensions defining the dialectics of the individual and her society. In sum, while immunology provides metaphors for characterizing human societies, the science in turn, draws from its supporting culture to model its\nbiology. Here we see an explicit demonstration of the\nbi-directionality of social and scientific discourses, and to draw the\nline separating the laboratory from its supporting culture again\nproves problematic (Gieryn 1995). \nTwo conceptual shifts that have marked contemporary research in\nimmunology have influenced philosophical comment on various topics in\nbiology. The first is a major revision in how the mechanics of\nimmunity are conceived. Taking account of the context in which the\nimmune reaction is regulated, the earlier conception of immune\nspecificity as arising from some simple mechanical lock and key\nmatching between selected antibodies binding to noxious antigens has\nbeen replaced with collectivist models of molecular interactions. In\naccounting for the frequency and intensity of an immune encounter,\nthis dynamic orientation portrays the immune system as a sensor of\nchange rather than structure. The sensitivity of such a\ncognitive system that must mediate multifarious immune reactions\nrequires a co-ordination of collective molecular ensembles,\nin which diverse elements together determine the extent of the immune\nresponse (Daëron 2014). Indeed, only through modulated responses\ncan immunity fulfill its diverse functions, some of which require\ntolerance of recognized substances and others full blown activation of\nrejection. Accordingly, immune theory has departed from the classical,\nself/nonself framework that depicts the immune response as a simple\n“on” and “off” binary switch, to multifaceted\nmodels that account for a spectrum of reactivities. \nThe second conceptual shift addresses how immunity mediates the\ninteractions of the organism with its environment. That ecological\norientation has inflected immunology from its earlier insular\nconceptions of the organism to a dynamic interactive view that\nhighlights how life experience alters the immune response to external\nchallenges and opportunities. With this broadened perspective, the\nidea of immunity extends beyond defense of an atomistic\nindividual, to include the mediation of the organism’s\necological economy, both defensive and assimilative. This includes the\ninternal environment as well, inasmuch as the microbiome, established\nthrough immune niche formation, has increasingly focused attention on\nthe prevalence of immune tolerance, symbiosis, and the biology\ncharacterized by cooperative relationships of various sorts (Eberl\n2010; Bilate and LaFaille 2012). \nIn short, the philosophical challenge of defining immune identity is\nframed by differing orientations, namely, autonomous individuality\nversus collective ensemble (both applicable to the regulation of the\nimmune response and contextual placement in the environment). Which\nversion chosen then leads to strikingly different answers to\nimmunology’s key questions:  \nEach of these issues directly pertains to philosophical considerations\nabout the character of the organism, the relationships of parts to the\nwhole, principles of biological organization and regulation, the\nconstruction of cognitive schemas, and the ability of models to\ncapture complex organic functions. \nIn conclusion, although firmly embedded in philosophy of biology and\nengaging in closely related concerns, the philosophy of immunology has\nbecome an established discipline with distinctive interests and\ncontributions. The immunological matters of interest to philosophers\ndo not always overlap with those that dominate immunology’s\ncontemporary research program. This divergence highlights how\nphilosophy of immunology has emerged as an autonomous field with its\nown subjects of attention and methods of inquiry that complement\nrather than mimic or replicate the pursuits in related areas of\ntheoretical and experimental immunology. Moreover, philosophical\nstudies of immunology have contributed to a wide range of pivotal\ntopics engaged by philosophers of biology—organismal identity;\nindividuality; dynamic causation in complex systems (integrating\ncomplexity theory with big data studies); the characterization of the\ngoals and methods of systems biology; the organization of information;\nthe characterization of the normative and deviant; and personal\nontology (self). Each of these areas of research impact other\nbiological disciplines of interest to philosophers, i.e., development,\necology, genetics, evolution and cognition. And beyond the purview of\nphilosophy of biology, studies of immunology contribute to the more\ngeneral discussions of reductionism/anti-reductionism, theory change\nand conceptual modeling, and social and cultural studies of science\n(i.e., the function of metaphors in science, the role of a scientific\ndiscourse). In sum, a rich two-way traffic between philosophers of\nimmunology and philosophers of science has emerged that allows the\nformer to use tried-and-tested conceptual tools developed by their\ncolleagues, while providing a unique outlook for the latter. Given the\ncentrality of immunology in modern biology and the unique perspective\noffered by this science on crucial philosophical problems, further\nengagement not only seems likely, but an imperative for philosophy of\nscience writ large.

While speculative investigations and\nabstract analyses have always been part of immune theorizing, until\nrecently philosophers have largely ignored immunology. Yet the\nimplications for understanding the philosophical basis of organismal\nfunctions framed by immunity offer new perspectives on fundamental\nquestions of biology and medicine. Developed in the context of history\nof medicine, theoretical biology, and medical anthropology, philosophy\nof immunology differs from these related branches of study in its\nfocus on traditional philosophical questions concerning identity,\nindividuality, ecology, cognition, scientific methodology and theory\nconstruction. This broad agenda derives from immunology’s\nmultifaceted research program that has developed from its initial\nclinical challenges of host defense, transplantation, autoimmunity,\ntumor immunology, and allergy. In addition to these well-established\nresearch areas, immunity is now understood to play a central role in\nother physiological functions, development, ecology, and evolutionary\nmechanics. Holding together these diverse domains of inquiry lie\nphilosophical commitments oriented by organismal identity. In this\nregard, pertinent issues are raised concerning \n\n cognition (organization of immune perception and information\nprocessing), \n\n the character of individuality (framed by the ecological context\nof immune-mediated assimilation and rejection), and \n\n the dynamics of complex systems (understood as holistic systems\nbiology). \n\nIndeed, immunology, in the context of cognitive science, evolutionary\nbiology, environmental sciences, and development provides multi-focal\nperspectives for philosophy of science.\n\n\n\n\nThe immune system is typically represented as a system of defense that\nprotects the organism from pathogens. However, this system is known to\nplay other functions in the organism that include  \nThus, by responding to the inner and outer environments of the\norganism, the immune system participates in many capacities to\ncoordinate diverse physiological functions and to provide\ncommunication between them. Immunity thus relies upon cognitive\nfunctions coupled to an array of effector mechanisms that have\nwide-ranging regulative, reparative, and defensive capabilities.\nBeyond the philosophical significance of these immune-mediated\nfunctions, studies of immunity are uniquely positioned to address\ncentral problems in\n philosophy of biology (see entry)\n and, more broadly, philosophy of science. These include the\nreductionism/holism debate, the characterization of the goals and\nmethods of systems biology, the organization of cognition and\ninformation, and the challenge of integrating complexity theory with\nbig data studies. \nDespite the multifaceted role of the immune system and its importance\nin promoting survival and persistence of all forms of life (Pradeu\n2012: 22–32), immunology has traditionally been of minor\ninterest to philosophers of biology (cf. Hull and Ruse 2007; Sarkar\nand Plutynski 2010). However, increased attention has recently been\ndirected to address a range of ontological and epistemological\nproblems related to immune phenomena. These studies have focused upon\nthe “immune self”, the central motif of biological\nidentity in the context of immunity (Tauber 1994; Pradeu 2012).\nRanging over diverse topics, including personal identity (Howes 1999),\nethical and anthropological concerns with human self-image (Sontag\n1990; E. Martin 1994), and poststructuralist, constructivist and\nfeminist notions of identity (Derrida 2003; Haraway 1989; Weasel\n2001), philosophers have invoked immunological conceptions of\nselfhood. Moreover, the examination of immunology has proven\nincreasingly useful in addressing philosophical problems pertaining to\nother fields of study such as ecology (Tauber 2017), neuro- and\ncognitive sciences (Varela et al. 1988), developmental biology (Fagan\n2007), microbiology (Méthot and Alizon 2014) and evolutionary\nbiology (Hull, Langman, and Glenn 2001). This increased recognition of\nimmunology in philosophy of biology not only reflects a growing trend\ntowards more inclusive approaches, more generally, but also\ncontributes to the intensifying effort to understand ecological\ndynamics that range from microbial interactions to climate change\n(O’Malley and Dupre 2007; O’Malley 2014). \nImmunologists have long applied philosophy to elaborate conceptual\nframeworks for understanding the immune system and to shed light on\nthe character of experimental conduct in this biomedical field\n(Anderson 2014). To highlight the common culture of immunology and\nphilosophy, a prominent Australian immunologist, Macfarlane Burnet,\nwrote in 1965: “Immunology has always seemed to me more a\nproblem in philosophy than in practical science” (Burnet 1965).\nHe was inspired by Whitehead in elaborating his notion of immune\nselfhood and by his attempts to apply cybernetics and information\ntheory to immunology (Anderson and Mackay 2014). Another influential,\nphilosophically-oriented immunologist, Niels Jerne, admitted to having\nbeen influenced by Kierkegaard’s discussion of Plato’s\nMeno when elaborating his key conceptual ideas (i.e., the\nselection theory of antibody production) (Jerne 1966, Söderqvist\n2003: 186). And perhaps most prominently, Ludwik Fleck’s\nimmunological and bacteriological research served as the case example\nof a “thought collective” that has served as the founding\nstudy of the social character of scientific change in biology and\nscience (Löwy 1986; Fagan 2009; see the entry on\n Ludwik Fleck).\n Many other prominent immunological researchers, including\nMetchnikoff, Zinsser, Medawar, Edelman and Salk, were also humanist\nthinkers who, in addition to active laboratory research, conspicuously\nexpounded philosophical ideas on the nature of reality, the character\nof cognition, the limits of science, the condition of humankind, and\nthe like. Thus, a rich bidirectional exchange between philosophy and\nimmunology has been established over a long tradition. \nThe basic schema of vertebrate immunity consists of two evolutionary\ndistinct ways to perceive the organism’s external environment\nand to monitor its inner state. The first modality, more primitive and\nless refined in its perceptive mechanisms, is referred to as the\n“innate” or “natural” immune system. This arm\nof immunity is composed of a variety of primordial\nphagocytes—“eating cells”—possessing\ndistinctive characteristics based on their tissue distribution. They\ningest particulate microbes and destroy effete, cancerous, and damaged\nhost cells. These immunocytes constitute the first line of the immune\nencounter and comprise the “resting” state of\nphysiological immunity as they “police” on-going processes\nof surveillance and restoration. This system has autonomous functions,\nbut the incorporation of antigen (a substance that stimulates an\nimmune response) may also lead to integration with the second mode of\nimmunity, the so called, “acquired” immune system. This\nsecond arm of immunity has evolved mechanisms that are highly specific\nin their recognition capabilities and exhibit immune\n“memory” of previous sensitization. Acquired immunity is\nmediated by several classes of lymphocytes that may be stimulated by\nphagocyte first-encounters or as primary responders under certain\npathological conditions. The B-lymphocytes produce antibody that\nrecognizes antigens by structural homology and, correspondingly,\nT-cells have specific antigen-matching receptors on their cell\nsurface. The initial recognition event leads to activation of a\nvariety of effector reactions that destroy the immune target. However,\nthe decision not to respond is also a recognition event and results in\nimmune “tolerance”. Both the innate and acquired immune\ncellular elements are regulated by a vast array of soluble molecular\nfactors that serve to either activate or dampen immune responses. The\ncomplexity of diverse cell types, the mediators of their interactions,\nthe contextual determinants that determine immune reactivity, and the\nwide range of physiological functions in which immunity participates,\nhas defied comprehensive modeling. Consequently, immunology offers a\nfecund example of biological organizational complexity, which, in\nturn, leads to the fundamental philosophical question: On what basis\nis organismal identity established and maintained? \nImmunology, from its earliest inception, has been concerned with\nbiological identity—its establishment and maintenance.\nIn its original iteration, immunity was conceived as that function\nthat preserved the integrity of the organism in terms of\nprotecting and restoring its individuality. Thus, immune\nfunctions testified to the persistence of a stable, core identity\ndefined in terms of its insularity and autonomy. Indeed,\nindividuality undergirded the science from its inception, for\nthe defense against pathogens was framed by an attacked patient\n(individual) pitted against alien others, the invaders. In this\nscenario, distinct borders mark individual identity, and immunity is\nthe response to the violation of those boundaries. However, challenges\nto this conception of immunity have recently appeared. Emphasizing the\ncontextual placement of the organism, notions of demarcated boundaries\nthat have characterized traditional definitions of the organism are\nbeing revised. \nGenerally understood, an individual replicates itself and possesses\nanatomic borders, a harmonious communication between its parts, a\ndivision of labor for the benefit of the whole, and a system of\nhierarchical dominance and control. By these criteria, the immune\nsystem is responsible for establishing and maintaining the integrity\nof such an individual (Pradeu 2016). However, symbiosis challenges\nthis entrenched definition of the individual organism: shared\nphysiologies govern homeostasis; anatomic margins lose clear\ndefinition; development is intertwined among several phylogenetically\ndefined entities; and the unit of evolutionary selection becomes a\nmultiplex genome (see the entry on\n the biological notion of individual).\n On this consortium view, notions of individuality are replaced with\ncomplexes of organisms that defy any singular definition of\norganismal identity as independent agents (Löwy 1991; S. Gilbert,\nSapp, and Tauber 2012). In terms of commensal relationships,\nsymbiosis, mediated by immune tolerance, signifies stabilized\nadaptation to the complex of diverse living elements that live in a\ncohesive ecology, both within and external to the traditional borders\nof the organism. When oriented by ecological relationships, immunology\nmoves from its dominant concern with autonomous individuality to\ninclude the science of cooperative assemblies of organisms. The\nontological implications of this re-formulation are highly significant\nfor philosophical considerations of identity as discussed below (see\nthe entry on\n identity). \nThe diachronic identity of an organism, its capacity to remain the\nsame despite transformations, has puzzled philosophers since ancient\nGreece. Aristotle postulated the existence of immutable forms, that,\nbeing distinct from fluctuating matter, ensure the continued identity\nof living creatures (Categories,\n3b22–33; Metaphysics, Book D).  Dissatisfied with this\nsolution, Locke proposed that temporal identity of animals and plants\nis not ensured by their unvarying forms, but rather by the continuity\nof their lived life (Locke 1689, II.27.4 and II.27.8; Kaufman\n2016). In the context of contemporary philosophy of biology, the\nimportance of continuous identity was emphasized by Hull who argued\nthat species lack essences and thus should be considered historical\nindividuals with their own inner coherence and persistence conditions\nnot unlike those of other living creatures (Hull 1978). He assumed\nthat these persistence conditions are provided by continuity of\nchanges in biological organization of these individuals so that only\nan abrupt disruption could cause a loss or change of identity (Hull\n1992; Hull 1978: 355).  This latter perspective has recently been\nadopted by advocates of animalism, who argue that continuity of\nphysiological processes (organic animalism) or maintenance of\ncharacteristic structural organization (somatic animalism) are\nnecessary for diachronic identity (Olson 1997; van Inwagen 1990;\nMackie 1999; see the entry on\n animalism). \nImmunology steps into the diachronic identity debate with\nBurnet’s hypothesis that during embryonic development, the\nimmune system learns to tolerate a defined set of molecules as\n“self” (Burnet 1959: 59). He proposed that autoreactive\nimmune cells (lymphocytes) were purged during embryonic development to\nleave only those lymphocytes that ignore specific antigens encountered\nduring this early stage (Burnet 1957). Defined negatively by a gap in\nthe lymphocyte repertoire, immunological selfhood was assumed to\npersist in the adult as an invariant molecular ‘essence’\nof the organism, analogous to an unwavering psychological ego (Burnet\n1959; Tauber 1994: 194). As observed by Pradeu and Carosella, this\nself/nonself model supported a substantialist view of identity in so\nfar as it presupposed that the immune system ensures integrity of a\npreserved metaphysical core (Pradeu and Carosella 2006a: 246). \nTo provide a distinct view of the immune system’s role in\ndiachronic identity, Pradeu advocates the so-called\n“genidentity” view (Pradeu 2018). On this view, two\nobjects are identical if their states are continuously connected over\ntime (Lewin 1922). To specify which continuous states ensure temporal\nidentity of an organism, Pradeu refers to those “immune\ninteractions [that] isolate some continuous biochemical interactions,\nwhich in turn individuate the organism” (Pradeu 2012:\n248–249). Accordingly, the immune system reacts to rapid\nmolecular alterations in the pattern of biochemical interactions and\nthus helps to ensure that these interactions are continuous and\nunperturbed. Of note, which continuous process should be followed to\ndefine diachronic identity is not observer independent and must be\nadjusted to a particular theoretical perspective (Guay and Pradeu\n2016: 318; Pradeu 2018). \nHowever, the idea that the immune system contributes to organismal\nidentity maintenance has to be weighed against evidence\nsuggesting that immunity contributes to the accommodation of\nchange. At the end of the nineteenth century, Metchnikoff\nproposed that phagocytes (primitive immune cells) were agents of\norganismal transformation, driving metamorphic and developmental\nalterations (Metchnikoff 1901 [1905]; Tauber and Chernyak 1991). This\nearly view has been supported by recent evidence that the immune\nsystem actively participates in mediating transformations in\norganismal identity by constantly redefining and modulating immune\nreactivity towards endogenous and exogenous molecules (Tauber 2017).\nThis is most apparent during development as illustrated by the\nactivity of brain-resident macrophages (microglia), which, by\nimpacting angiogenesis/vascularization, as well as the migration,\nproliferation and apoptosis of neurons, influence social behavioral\nand sexual identity (Wynn, Chawla, and Pollard.2013; Lenz and Nelson\n2018). \nTolerance of newly encountered antigens demonstrates the\n“fluid” state of the reactive immune repertoire that\nundergoes alteration over the lifespan of the organism (Grignolio et\nal. 2014). And with a changing “immune biography”,\nbiological identity no longer conforms to the simple binary division\nof self and nonself that has hitherto characterized immune\ntheorizing. Accordingly, animals have no immutable molecular essence\nthat would ensure persistence of identity, at least as determined by\nimmune tolerance or rejection (León-Letelier, Bonifaz, and\nFuentes-Pananá 2019). Identity then becomes an ever-changing\nprocess of accepted transformations and rejected entries. From this\nvantage point, the animalist definitions of diachronic identity as a\nmere persistence of life or even an underlying constancy fails to\naccount for the dynamic quality of immune-mediated identity\ntransitions (van Inwagen 1990: 148–149; Olson 1997; Mackie 1999;\nRoy and Hebrok 2015; Dupré 2017). Consequently, the immune\nprocessual point of view defines organismal persistence as “a\ncoordinated group of changes” rather than as an\ninvariant state or a continuous connection between such states. This\nunderstanding has important implications for philosophy of biology and\nontology, more generally (Dupré 2014; Nicholson and Dupre 2018;\nMeincke 2018). \nWhile diachronic identity of an organism is understood as its\npersistence though time, synchronic identity is defined in\nterms of its individuality or distinctiveness (Sober 2000: 154).\nAttempts have been made to identify distinguishing characteristics\nsuch as functional autonomy, possession of mutually interdependent\nparts, genetic homogeneity and spatial boundaries (Clarke 2010).\nOthers, pointing to the heterogeneous character of biological\nindividuals, have argued that no sole feature can serve as a universal\ndeterminant of individuality (see the entry on\n the biological notion of individual).\n Part of the contention resides in differing frames of reference of\nstudy: Most considerations of synchronic individuality focus upon\nevolutionary individuals as units of selection (Gould and\nLloyd 1999) that differs from how physiological individuals\nmight be distinguished (Pradeu 2016). Regardless of their involvement\nin evolution, organisms exhibit various levels of physiological and\nmorphological integration that makes their indivisibility problematic\n(Godfrey-Smith 2009). Immunology contributes to discussions of\nindividuality in this latter sense by considering the role of the\nimmune system in defining the boundaries of the organism by the\nfunctional measures of rejection or assimilation. \nPradeu formulated such criteria and proposed that the immune system\nplays the central role in determining what is included in the organism\nand what is not (Pradeu 2012). The differentiation is based on his\ncontinuity/discontinuity model, which depicts the immune system\nreacting to transient alterations in the pattern of antigen receptor\ninteractions and tolerates long-lasting modifications (Pradeu, Jaeger,\n& Vivier 2013; Pradeu & Carosella 2006a: 241, 2006b). Such a\nmechanism is based on recognizing that autoimmunity is a normal\nfunction of immunity (Tauber 2015). Because host antigens do not evoke\nan immune response, a stable, “continuity” of immune\ninteractions establishes an activation threshold that initiates an\nimmune response only upon a rapid increase in antigenic load. The\nimmune system thus distinguishes the stable state of tolerant\nrecognition of tonic signals arising from normal physiological process\nin contrast to the appearance of novel antigens, for example, arising\nfrom pathogen invasion or tissue injury (Grossman and Paul 1992;\nMyers, Zikherman and Roose 2017; Pradeu 2012: 246; Grossman 2019).\nThus the development of tolerance to frequently encountered antigens,\ncommensals, tissue grafts and anastomosed animals results in the\nestablishment of stable, integrated associations mediated by low-grade\nimmune interactions (Pradeu and Carosella 2006a, 2006b; Pradeu 2012:\n251–252). In this formulation, the immune system plays a central\nrole in defining an individual by permitting beneficial physiological\ninclusion of heterologous components. \nOthers refer to these stable immune interactions with microbiota to\ndeny that organisms are individuals (S. Gilbert, Sapp, and\nTauber 2012). Appreciating the ubiquity of symbiosis, the immune\nsystem from this point of view becomes a key mediator of the holobiont\nby tolerating and coordinating microbial-host relationships. On this\nbasis, these critics highlight that most of these interactions fall on\na dynamic spectrum of rejection and acceptance making it impossible,\nin principle, to determine the boundaries of individuality.\nSymbiotic interactions do not conform to a simple acceptance-rejection\nmodel. Rather, to attune its responses to microbial signals the immune\nsystem launches a broad spectrum of T-cell reactions in combination\nwith a variety of innate immune and tissue cell-derived signals\n(cytokines, hormones, neurotransmitters) in combination with complex\nregulatory controls (Eberl 2016). As suggested by Cohen, immunity is\nthe product of an active computational state that constantly assesses\nthe state of the organism’s internal state and the surroundings\nin which it lives (Cohen 2007a, 2007b). In the context of such fluid\nactivity, transitioning from one unique activation state to another\ndoes not allow definitive delineation of organismal borders. Instead,\nthe immune system acts as gatekeeper that controls the apparent\nboundary between the organism and its environment (Tauber 2008: 231; Tauber 2017; S. Gilbert, Sapp, and Tauber 2012). From this perspective, the view of immunity as protecting insularity shifts to recognizing its role in establishing and maintaining communal\nrelationships that blur the distinction of an atomistic\ninsular individuality (Skillings 2016). \nThe self/nonself, tolerance/response dichotomies collapse altogether,\nwhen considered in the context of mammalian pregnancy, where various\nmodalities are employed to preserve the temporary immune sanctuary of\nthe ‘foreign’ fetus (Howes 2007; A. Martin 2010). Studies\nof immune-mediated exchanges between the mother and the fetus not only\nchallenge our view of immunity as concerned with rejection and\ndefense, but also transform our understanding of biological\nindividuality (Erlebacher 2013; Howes 2008). More specifically, recent\nstudies undermine the vision of the maternal immune system as\nantagonistic to the fetus and rather point to active immune\nparticipation in the formation of an amalgamated maternal-fetal\nindividual, whose ontological status lies at the continuum between\nunification and distinctiveness (Howes 2008). Delineation of the role\nof inflammation during blastocyst implantation further supports this\ninteractive vision, demonstrating that instead of acting as a\nrejection response, inflammation promotes a mutually tolerant fusion\nbetween the embryo and the mother (Griffith et al. 2017; Mor, Aldo,\nand Alvero 2017). Indeed, the transformation of an\ninflammation-induced reaction pathway into a cell differentiation\npathway in decidual stromal cells exhibits the intimate connection of\nthe immune and reproductive systems in eutherians (G. Wagner,\nErkenbrack, and Love 2019; Nuño de la Rosa, Pavlicev, and\nEtxeberria 2019, in Other Internet Resources). \nIn conclusion, despite significant contributions of philosophy of\nimmunology to debates about identity, no straightforward answer to the\nquestion of how the immune system contributes to biological\nindividuality has been offered. Considering the actual\nindividualization practices in various fields of biology, it may well\nbe concluded that no single account of the biological individual\nsuffices and that the question of whether particular criteria are\nvalid or not depends on the research perspective adopted. Part of the\nconundrum may lie in the efforts to consider the issue at the\nmetaphysical, rather than at the epistemological level (Love 2018,\nLove and Brigandt 2017). As discussed below, the status of the\n“immune self” is a fecund case in point. \nWide use of the self/nonself distinction in different clinical and\nresearch traditions (provided by the relaxed and varied meanings\nassociated with its use) has established such discrimination as the\ngoverning construct of the science (e.g., Howes 2010; Hoffman 2012;\nCohn 2015). Indeed, the “immune self” has served as\nimmunology’s foundational concept to order immune theorizing for\nthe past 70 years (Burnet and Fenner 1949; Tauber 1994). However,\ndespite the paradigm’s established standing, definition of\nimmune identity has proven elusive. As discussed above (section 2.1),\nbecause of fluctuations of immune activity over the lifespan of the\norganism, conceptualizing and modeling active tolerance have yet to\nyield criteria for defining stable identity (Bilate and LaFaille\n2012). Moreover, a consensus definition of selfhood has remained\nelusive inasmuch as different investigative frameworks promote\ndiffering characteristics of immune identity based on their respective\nstructural and functional criteria (Matzinger 1994). Critics have\ntherefore questioned the immune self’s standing and utility\n(e.g., Matzinger 1994; Tauber 2000; Pradeu 2012). The latter position\nargues that the “self” might be better regarded as only a\nmetaphor for a “figure” outlined by the immune\nsystem’s silence, i.e., its non-reactivity. Such a functionally\nflexible definition has been resisted. Defenders argue that the notion\nof stabilized discrimination correctly depicts the immune\nsystem’s organizing functions (which converge on defending a\nwell-demarcated organism), and that efforts to eliminate or modify\nthis metaphor are misguided attempts to “police” borders\nbetween science and culture (Anderson 2014; Hoffman 2012). Drawing\nfrom the philosophical canon, Howes referred to Hume to argue that\nrealism about self (immune or otherwise) can be saved despite the\ndependency of context and the ever-changing character of the\npostulated ego (Howes 1998). She suggested that the efforts to deny\nthe reality of the self are based on its non-substantial character and\nthus reflects entrenched substantialist assumptions. She proposed that\na middle ground exists between substantial self and no-self by\nadopting a processual, understanding of selfhood (Howes 1999). \nWhile the standing of the immune self has remained contentious,\nepistemological ambiguity and flexible polysemy has proven effective\nin sustaining the term’s powerful heuristic value as an\nidiom with many uses and meanings (Crist and Tauber 2000).\nIts versatility and pragmatic utility have effectively integrated\nclinical immune phenomena by highlighting the essential similarity or\ninterconnectedness of diverse immune-mediated processes in response to\nvarious clinical challenges. Thus nutrition, allergy, infection,\nautoimmune disease, various phenomena of tolerance, natural or\nexperimentally created chimeras (transplantation), and autoimmunity\nall become conceived as a network of interlinked or interrelated\nfunctions subject to evolutionary transformation and adaption. As\nthese topics mirror and play off one another under the rubric of\nselfhood, immunologists have a ready means by which to represent\nstates or processes that arise in the various interactions between the\norganism and its environment at different evolutionary stages and\ndevelopment. \nFinally, the self’s appearance in immunology served as a readily\nunderstood shorthand reference to personal identity, and the efforts\nto substantiate that extrapolation on its own terms guided the\ndiscipline for the latter half of the twentieth century (for\nhistorical case studies see Löwy 1991). After all, beyond the\nexperimental science, the interpretative context of immune selfhood\ndraws from wider social meanings of individuality and insularity\n(Tauber 2016; see below, section 5.0). The autonomous construction of\nidentity resonates with Western civic ideals and in turn supports them\nby melding laboratory findings with various extrapolated or borrowed\nphilosophical, political and psychological formulations of human\nagency. And conversely, immunology has been studied as a source of\nimportant metaphors and other tropes feeding back on the\nscience’s supporting culture to transform understanding of\nagency and communal relationships (discussed below, section 5.0). \nImmunology’s basic conceptual orientation is undergoing\nexpansion from an individuality-based biology to include communal\necological perspectives. Similar shifts in perspective have also taken\nplace in other fields of biology (Nathan 2014; van Baalen and Huneman\n2014), and thus immunology joins a proliferation of\n“sub-organismal” environmental studies that would\nintegrate ecology with developmental biology, physiology, cancer\nbiology, molecular eco-systems, and eco-immunology (S. Gilbert and\nEpel 2015; Karasov, Martínez del Rio, and Caviedes-Vidal 2011;\nMaley et al. 2017; Tauber 2017). This emerging perspective is\naccompanied by an increasing interest in somatic evolution occurring\nduring carcinogenesis, neurogenesis, microbiota development, and the\nadaptive immune responses. This shift has led to an abandonment of the\nclassical vision of the immune system directed at defense to now\ninclude tolerant mechanisms that permit assimilation and co-habitation\nthat reflect stabilized microbial-host relationships. In that\nre-orientation, concepts of pathogenicity and individuality have been\nre-defined. \nSo, although the concepts of immunity were developed primarily in the\ncontext of disease ecology, attention is shifting to symbiotic\necosystems. The exchanges the immune system mediates highlight context\nsensitivity of parasitism, commensalism and mutualism, and further\ndemonstrates the bidirectional dialogue between bacteria and the host\nin the mutual construction of their respective ecological niches. The\nproblem of immune evolution and clonal selection of lymphocytes is\nconsidered, in turn, to provide the most general account of natural\nselection. An important new issue concerns a set of problems\nassociated with the recently discovered adaptive immune system of\nbacteria, the CRISPR system, whose role in evolution poses novel\nchallenges to basic Darwinian principles (see section 3.2). \nThe ideas underpinning somatic ecology originate in the early view of\nsomatic cells behaving as social organisms forming stable associations\n(Reynolds 2018: 12–58). Assuming that such interactions serve\nthe welfare of the organism, Virchow and other authors described a\n“cell state” (or a “cell republic)”, a\nmetaphoric expression of what became a sociological model of cellular\ncommunication (Virchow 1858 [1863]; R. Wagner 1999; Reynolds 2018:\n86–113). And pathologically, such a consortium becomes a\n“civil war” of competing cell lines. The model then led to\na general Darwinian formulation of an internal struggle for\nexistence throughout the life of an individual (Roux 1881; Metchnikoff\n1901 [1905]; Tauber and Chernyak 1991; see Buss 1987; Queller and Strassmann 2009;\nGodfrey-Smith 2009 for the contemporary standing of this proposal of\nevolutionary change). Metchnikoff, a key advocate of this theory,\nassumed that cells operate on Darwinian principles similar to those\ngoverning the adaptation of organisms in changing environmental\nconditions. He thus introduced a common framework in which to\nunderstand dynamic biological communities—whether internal cell\nlines or organisms adjusting to their environment. This ecological\norientation altered basic conceptions of immunity and identity by\ndisplacing static notions of individuality with dialectical constructs\n(Levins and Lewontin 1985; Tauber 2008). \nThis ecological viewpoint serves to depict somatic and microbial cell\npopulations as systems of communication and information exchange. With\nthe change in focus from individuals to ecosystems, the classical\ndichotomies governing immunology’s theory, i.e.,\ntolerance/responsiveness, immune/non-immune, self/nonself, has been\nrevised. How these oppositions collapse in an information-based\necological format is illustrated by the phenomenon of inter-kingdom\nsignaling, a form of communication that not only bridges an\nevolutionary gap between microbes and host, but also helps to overcome\nputative boundaries between immune, epithelial, and neural systems\n(cf. Hughes and Sperandio 2008). When considered from the\nenvironmental perspective, the transition site between the genetic\nbody and its resident microbes is no longer a frontline of defense but\nrather an ecological ecotone, an interactive zone at which cellular\ncommunities engage in a dialogue to explore new adaptive opportunities\n(Tauber 2008). The importance of such interfaces is well illustrated\nby mutual scaffolding and niche construction strategies that are\nutilized by microbial symbionts and their hosts to direct development\nof larger ecological units (i.e., holobionts) (Chiu and S. Gilbert\n2015). \nStruggle and cooperation in the immune context were assumed since Koch\nto depend on intrinsic characteristics of invading microbes that, due\nto their virulence factors and other gene-encoded characteristics, act\nas pathogens, commensals or mutualists (Méthot and Alizon\n2014). By accounting for a larger context of the immune encounter, the\necological position challenges this vision by offering a view in which\n“there are no pathogens, no commensals, and no opportunists;\ninstead there are only microbes and hosts that interact”\nunpredictably (Casadevall and Pirofski 2015). In this scenario,\nmicrobial virulence becomes an emergent property, dependent on host\nand microbial factors, whose interactions cannot be derived from first\nprinciples (Casadevall, Fang, and Pirofski 2011). \nIn sum, the ecological view has led to the view that boundaries\nbetween parasitism, commensalism and mutualism are changeable and\nfluid, dependent on host factors, the full microbiota, and the broader\nenvironmental context (temperature, nutrients, etc.) (Méthot\nand Alizon 2014). Current views of plasticity, pathogenicity, and\nvirulence revitalizes the nineteenth-century concept of microbial-host\nequilibrium (Méthot 2012). In the context of disease ecology,\nlong-lasting associations between hosts and parasites leads to a\nclimax state in which the respective populations remain stable (Burnet\nand White 1972; Anderson 2004). The immune equilibrium model then\ndepicts persistent viral colonization as a product of a “dynamic\nbut metastable equilibrium between the virome and the host”\n(Virgin, Wherry, and Ahmed 2009; Eberl 2010). Thus, the modern idea of\nbalance highlights a stable state in which offensive and\ndefensive forces neutralize one another to form stable associations\nbetween parasites and the host with little damage to either partner\n(Swiatczak 2014). \nThe environmental perspective not only refers to the application of\necological and evolutionary knowledge to immune modeling, but also\nincludes lessons learned from studies of immunity that reciprocally\ninform current understanding of evolution. How these findings shed\nlight on the character of evolutionary change is well illustrated by\nthe research of inheritable immune variation. The origin of variation\nhas been subject to much debate in philosophy of biology. Advocates of\nthe view that nonrandom, environmentally induced factors are involved\nin the generation of inheritable variation cite evidence of\nstress-induced mutagenesis, horizontal gene transfer, and non-genetic\nsystems of inheritance (Koonin 2012: 257–291). Such discoveries\nsuggest that organisms may enhance their own adaptation to altered\nenvironmental conditions epigenetically (Jablonka and Lamb 2014; J.\nShapiro 2011). Specialized diversification and recombination\nmechanisms that are used by organisms to enhance their own adaptation\nare considered Lamarckian in so far as the response to specific\nenvironmental cues leads to alterations of phenotypic features, and\nthese adaptive characteristics may be transmitted to succeeding\ngenerations (Sarkar 1991; Depew and Weber 1996). Notwithstanding\nevidence for such mechanisms, postulated non-random mechanisms of\nevolution have been disputed by those who claim that appeals to\nLamarckism are misguided and stem from mis-interpreting the\nNeo-Darwinian synthesis or from overlooking genes as the basic units\nof selection (Merlin 2010; Weiss 2015). With a focus on rapidly\nadapting and evolving cell populations, immunological studies provide\na unique opportunity to investigate evolution in real time and to\nunderstand the role of non-random, inheritable alterations of the\nphenotype. \nExamination of adaptive immunity in prokaryotes provides a major\nbreakthrough in this controversy. Many bacteria and most Archaea\nundergo non-random changes directed at devising protection from\ninvasive bacteriophages and mobile genetic elements (Horvath and\nBarrangou 2010). These microbes use specialized methods of defense,\nCRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)-Cas\n(CRISPR-associated protein) systems to incorporate foreign DNA\nfragments into their genomes (Koonin 2019). These become templates for\nthe formation of RNA molecules, which when associated with\nendonuclease enzymes, mediate destruction of the complementary,\nforeign DNA fragments. These acquired adaptive changes are a direct\nconsequence of the organism’s interactions with the environment,\nand, because these modifications can be passed on to succeeding\ngenerations, the CRISPR-Cas system has been suggested to operate on\nLamarckian principles, an interpretation that has been contested\n(Koonin 2012: 265; Koonin 2019; Pradeu 2019). Although not conforming to the neo-Darwinian model, this system lacks the teleological character postulated by Lamarck, and thus should be considered, at most, a model of directed mutagenesis (Wideman et al. 2019; Woolley et al. 2019; Weiss 2015).\nOthers counter that a continuum of Lamarckian-Darwinian mechanisms\nexists in nature and that CRISPR-Cas represents a genuine case of\nLamarckinism (Jablonka 2019; Koonin and Wolf 2016). Advocates of this latter interpretation place CRISPR-Cas systems among other apparently Lamarckian mechanisms like those mediating epigenetic inheritance\n(Gissis and Jablonka 2011). \nHighlighting the importance of directed mutagenesis and programmed\ngene rearrangements in evolution, these studies potentially revise\ndominant theories of adaptation. Indeed, such genetic changes operate\nin the vertebrate adaptive immune system: The first exposure of\nantigen leads to selection of a diverse population of lymphocytes,\neach carrying antigen receptors of a single specificity with varying\ndegrees of affinity for the newly introduced antigen; the stochastic\nbut coordinated assembly of gene segments determines receptor binding\nfitness (Tonegawa, et al. 1974; Podolsky and Tauber 1997). Higher\ndegrees of specificity arise through a class of lymphocytes (B cells),\nwhose activation by a specific antigen induces further variation and\nselection. This mechanism exhibits hypermutation, in which rearranged\nantigen receptor genes are subjected to scattered, random point\nmutations to permit rapid selection of a cell variant with an enhanced\nbinding fitness. As the process of hypermutation acts on pre-selected\ncells to improve adaptive fit of their receptors, its outcomes are\npartially biased, failing to exactly fit into the Neo-Darwinian scheme\n(cf. Dobzhansky 1970). Thus, in the course of antigenic exposure, the\npopulation of lymphocytes that recognize a newly introduced antigen\ncollectively generates an increasingly effective pool of responsive\ncells by fine-tuning the specificity of immune receptors, a process\nthat exemplifies non-random selection and adaptation (Simon,\nHollander, and McMichael 2015). \nFurther revising our understanding of adaptation is the observation that maternal antibodies may be passed on to descendants, allowing progeny to inherit some of the acquired immune characteristics of their parents. An example of such vertical immune transfer has been found in\nstudies of the composition of the microbiota mothers pass on to the\ninfant through vaginal and breastfeeding routes that program the\nnewborn’s immune system and metabolism (Mueller et al. 2015;\nGomez de Agüero et al. 2016). By molding the composition of its\nmicrobiota during pregnancy, the mother’s immune system\nengineers its environment by constructing a microbial model for her\noffspring (Chiu and S. Gilbert 2015; Mueller et al. 2015). When dysbiotic\nmicrobial populations are transmitted by obese mothers, their\nmetabolic abnormalities and associated pro-inflammatory phenotype are\nimprinted upon their children (Soderborg et al. 2018; Ley et al.\n2005). Due to the reliance on microbial niche construction, the\nacquisition of an infant’s immune characteristics is an instance\nof ecological inheritance, where transmission of selective pressures\nfrom one generation to another pre-sets the process of the\nprogeny’s adaptation to the environment (Odling-Smee, Laland,\nand Feldman 2003; Odling-Smee et al. 2013; Chiu and S. Gilbert 2015).\nAlterations in this ecological mode of immune transmission in humans\nby C-section or administration of antibiotics may compromise the\nhealth of the child and thus predispose them to a variety of\nimmune-related disorders (e.g., allergy and autoimmunity) (Bokulich et\nal. 2016). Thus, adaptive immunity exhibits various modalities in which variation may be generated and transferred from one generation to another. These findings challenge traditional Darwinian and Lamarckian categories, with wide-ranging ramifications. \nFinally, immunology contributes to a general account of selection\n(Darden and Cain 1989; Hull, Langman, and Glenn 2001). The clonal\nselection theory (CST), the foundational framework of modern\nimmunology, states that the immune system relies on a Darwinian-like\nprocess of selection to permit differential expansion of lymphocytes,\nwhose receptors are fitted to bind an antigen (Burnet 1959). Analogies\nbetween CST, natural selection theory, and selective theories in\nneuroscience have been generally regarded as examples of “a\nselection type theory” (Darden and Cain 1989). CST has also been\ncompared to other selective theories to elaborate a general vision\nof selection as cycles of replication, variation and environmental\ninteraction (Hull, Langman, and Glenn 2001). Such a general account of\nselection would not only elucidate the most fundamental principles of\nevolution, but would also serve as a guide for future selective\ntheories, e.g., neural group selection (cf. Edelman 1974, 1987).\nDifferences between selection theories have also been recognized and\nsuggest that unlike evolution of species, selection in somatic systems\n(in particular the neural system) does not fully account for the\nadaptation of the developing populations (Dumouchel 1996). More\ngenerally, Piattelli-Palmarini suggested that such a general scheme\ncould be of use in cognitive science and linguistics, as well as in\nother disciplinary domains outside of biology (Piattelli-Palmarini\n1986). \nCase studies of immunology have contributed to understanding the role\nof models and the structure of theory in the biomedical sciences (see\nthe entry on\n models in science).\n For example, Schaffner provided detailed analysis of the clonal\nselection theory and the two-component theory of the immune response\nto elaborate his criticism of the classical view of scientific\ntheories and to provide an account in which middle range theories,\nconsisting of interrelated theoretical models, organize subject areas\nin biology (Schaffner 1980). A taxonomy of immune models (both\nconceptual and experimental) exhibit a mosaic of methodologies and\ntheoretical ways in which information is obtained and integrated in\nthis field (Baetu 2014). Furthermore, high throughput sequencing\ntechniques and other “omics” approaches in immunology,\nlike those of microbial ecology, are increasingly utilizing new\nanalytical tools (cf. Huss 2014). In conjunction with systems biology\napproaches, these tools inspire engineering orientations, in which\nbiological systems achieve robustness and stability through the same\nprinciples with which machines are built, namely using system controls\n(e.g., feedback), redundancy (e.g., gene duplication, alternative\nmetabolic pathways), modular design (to minimize damage to local\nunits), and structural stability (Kitano 2001: 18). Apart from serving\nas an exemplar of systems-based theories and models, immunology has\nalso been employed to develop cognitivist models, elucidate conceptual\nand theoretical change in biology, and elaborate on contentious issues\nabout reductionism and anti-reductionism. \nThe rise of the cognitive paradigm in immunology originated in\nconceiving the immune system as a faculty of perception. Immunologists\nexplicitly describe macrophages “seeing” antigen;\nantibodies “recognizing” epitopes; T cell possessing\n“memory”; and adaptive immunity comprising a\n“learning” process. Such extensions from human psychology\nhave been widely utilized in evolutionary history (Margulis,\nAsikainen, and Krumbein 2011), wherein basic categories of human\ncognition have been extrapolated to animals (Bekoff, Allen, and\nBurghardt 2002), bacteria (Ben Jacob et al. 2004; Ben Jacob, Shapira,\nand Tauber 2005), cancer cells (Ben Jacob, Coffey, and Levine 2012)\nand the immune system (Cohen 1992a, 1992b). The influence of the\ncognitive metaphor (where intention plays an incipient role) appears\nthroughout immune theory with extrapolations to cognitive science more\ngenerally (Varela 1994: 36; Varela et al. 1988; Varela and Coutinho\n1991; Vaz 2011b). \nModels of cognition in immune theorizing have been extended from human\ncognitive science and linguistics, where representational and\nanti-representationalist orientations have vied for dominance (Tauber\n2013). The dominant model regards the immune response integrating two\nsteps: First, the immune system perceives molecular targets and then\n“decides” how to react (Cohen 1992a). Accordingly,\n“perception” is primary and effector functions (activation\nor tolerance) follow along a spectrum of responses. This understanding\nof immune cognition construes immunity as an information-processing\nfaculty, where immune activity becomes a computational process\ninvolving algorithmic transformation of an antigenic input into an\neffector output (Cohen 2007b). \nThis cognitivist orientation is of special interest to philosophers,\nin so far as such an examination provokes questions concerning the\nontological status of intentionality, the role of representation, and\nthe character of cognitive processing in general. Indeed,\nimmunology’s cognitive models carry the promise of revitalizing\nsome of the key issues prevalent in cognitive science by placing them\ninto the context of a system whose circulating components interact in\na probabilistic manner (Varela et al. 1988; Tauber 2017:\n129–161; Cohen 2000: 57–99). Such a “fluid\nbrain” carries wide-ranging theoretical implications (Fridman\n1991). \nShared nervous-immune system organizational characteristics have been\nproposed (Nataf 2016). As in the visual processing areas of the brain,\nwhere distinct features of a visual object (shape, color, motion) are\nperceived separately by distinct neuronal populations (C. Gilbert\n2013), the immune system utilizes dedicated cells and receptors to\nprocess fragmentary signals that discern distinct features of its\nenvironment (Swiatczak, Rescigno, and Cohen 2011). These signals are\nthen integrated by higher-level processing, which, by computing\ninformation from their respective “receptive fields”,\nproduce a unified representation of the antigen. Such a distributed\nimage parallels activities of higher cortical areas. So, analogous to\nthe nervous system, the immune system perceives immune objects by\nassembling discrete signals (immunogens, cytokines, chemokines, etc.)\nobtained as informational elements derived from various cell types,\nwhich, in an ascending integration, generate a multitude of T-cell and\nB-cell responses (Nataf 2016). In this schema, the integrative process\noccurring in lymphoid aggregates is the functional equivalent to the\nbrain that employs an analogous hierarchal structure to process\ninformation. Indeed, the nervous and immune systems are highly\nintegrated, both physiologically and anatomically. They share many of\nthe same messenger molecules, have close developmental histories both\nin phylogeny and ontogeny, and intersect biochemically (Ader\n2006). \nThe so-called “psycho-neuro-endocrine system” has a\nwell-established fourth partner in the immune system showing that its\nactivity cannot be understood in isolation from these other systems.\nThe models employed in one cognitive system are readily shared by the\nother and thus propagate underlying theoretical approaches and\nimplicit directives. Postulating molecular-level and systems-level\nrecognition states carries notions of “intentionality”\n(see the entry on\n intentionality).\n Alternatively, instrumentalist and eliminativist approaches argue\nthat intentional descriptions are either only constructs of a useful\nidiom or that they should be dropped altogether (Dennett 1987;\nChurchland 1989). Intentional assignments reflect an ordering\nmechanism for phenomena otherwise difficult to characterize and thus\nsusceptible to error (Matthen and Levy 1984). Errors must be\nunderstood in terms of reference to what end a system actually\nseemingly intends versus what it achieves in given\ncircumstances. In the immune setting, autoimmunity signifies a\ndysregulated state that, in this context, signifies mis-directed\nintentionality of normal immune function (Matthen and Levy 1984: 361).\nAny attempt to frame this process in non-intentional terms would fail,\nas such descriptions do not invoke goals, expectations, unfulfilled\nintentions and the like. Accordingly, immunology cannot dispense with\nthe intentional idiom and the associated psychological metaphors used\nin its descriptive language, if even only as a heuristic device\n(Rosenberg 1989: 38; Melander 1993: 239; Howes 2000). Strong arguments\nhave been made that metaphors in the life sciences act as\nindispensable instruments of cognition and explanation in addition to\nproviding a useful perspective on a research subject (Reynolds 2018).\nIndeed, despite neo-positivistic efforts to rid science of nonliteral\nmeanings to permit an objective (neutral) description of nature,\nanalogical thinking in science plays a variety of crucial epistemic\nfunctions (Hesse 1966; Fox Keller 2002). \nAdvocates of representationalist approaches to immune cognition accept\nthe subject-object dichotomy that portrays the immune system as a\n“knower”, an agent, who can represent the state of its\ninner and other environments (Tauber 2013). This has become a\nwell-entrenched orientation inasmuch as the ontological understanding\nof key concepts in immunology—self, individuality, and\norganism—revolves around the status of agency\nin immune theorizing. As already mentioned, from the very inception of\nthe discipline, immunologists have either assumed an implicit identity\nthat grounds the distinction between self and foreign, or that\nidentity is explicitly described as an agent at the heart of immune\ndefense. Traditionally associated with the capacity of an intentional,\nconscious being to act (see the entry on\n agency),\n agency has been redefined in philosophy of immunology to refer to the\nsource of immune activity. \nThe capacity of the immune system to create representative images\n(through ligand-receptor structural homology) and to act on them does\nnot mean that this system hosts a centralized control unit. Rather, as\nadvocates of these information-based accounts suggest, immune agency\nemerges from collective behavior of individual immune cells, each of\nwhich acts as a “cellular computing machine” (Cohen and Efroni 2019). From this point of view, the apparent complex\n“intelligence” of the immune system is a product of multiple cues originating from individual immune cells that function analogously to\njoint decisions made by a school of fish. From this cognitive point\nview, immunity arises from shared collective information. \nA distinct group of philosophical problems stems from\nanti-representationalist approaches to immune cognition. Advocates of\nthe so-called immune network theory challenge the classical\nsubject-object epistemology as a relationship between the knower and\nthe known that heretofore has dominated immune theory (Varela 1994:\n39). Heralding a shift “from an antigen-centered immunology to\nan organism-centered immunology”, this view maintains that\nimmune agency requires neither representation nor unified control\n(Varela 1991). Instead of a hierarchical organizational format, this\nde-centered orientation rests on the architecture of the network\ntheory proposed by Niels Jerne (Jerne 1974). He theorized that if\nantibodies of an individual are diverse enough to bind any\nantigen, they also are capable of recognizing one another. Simply,\ntheir mutual interactions must precede any exogenous antigen encounter. Thus, a binding site of one antibody could serve as an antigen to another antibody, which in turn may become the target to still another antibody to create a self-contained, inter-locking\nlattice-like network (Jerne 1985). He further proposed that excitatory\nand inhibitory forces resulting from antibody interactions establish\nan equilibrium state, which, unless upset by an intruding antigen,\nensures stable immune dynamics. Thus, according to Jerne’s\nhypothesis, the immune system is a self-referential network made up of\nmolecules that represent one another and whose reactions against\ninvasive pathogens were only the incidental result of\nequilibrating mechanisms that restore stable network dynamics. \nIn the network schema, cognition is not of something;\nperception is entirely within the system itself; the agent has\nvanished, and with that vacancy, representations are discarded (Vaz\nand Varela 1978: 238; Mingers 1991; Coutinho 2003; Palacios and\nBacigalupo 2003; Vaz 2011a). After all, what requires a\nre-presentation? In Jerne’s system, no hierarchy\nexists, and no cognitive center corresponding to company headquarters.\nInstead, what heretofore was referred to as activation resulting from\na subject-object predicate structured cognitive event (described by\nstimulus-response language) now refers to increased dynamic activity\nthat is due to the disruption of the network’s equilibrium.\nAccordingly, immune “knowledge” shifts from a\nsignifier–signified relationship to one in which meaning is\nfirmly lodged within the system itself. Simply, the\nsubject-object epistemological structure of cognition has been\nradically revamped. \nJerne’s provocative hypothesis, although elegant in conception\nand effective in inspiring new avenues of research, did not withstand\ncritical evaluation (Eichmann 2008; Vaz 2011a, 2011b). Despite\nconfirming the presence of idiotypic antibodies (i.e., mutually\ninteracting immunoglobulin molecules), their role and overall\ncontribution to immune functions remained uncertain. Furthermore, the\nidea of autonomy and closure contradicted empirical evidence\n(Hershberg and Efroni 2001; Coutinho 2003). However, notions of\ncognition without agency remained plausible. Pradeu and colleagues\nsimilarly proposed that the state of the immune system is structured\nby inter-connected elements, where activation results from\nperturbations of the stable linkages of the resting state (Pradeu and\nCarosella 2006a, 2006b; Pradeu, Jaeger, and Vivier 2013). The original\n“network” theory focused upon the inter-actions of the\nimmune system’s constituents, (Jerne 1974), while the\n“continuity” theory employs an architecture of\nantigenic-immune interactions (Pradeu 2012, 2018; Grossman and Paul\n2015). When the immune system is regarded from this\n“connected” perspective, tolerance is the result of a\nstable continuity of interactions between an antigen and its\nreceptors. Thus, integrated states are quiescent and disrupted ones,\nwhether “foreign” or endogenous, generate immune\nactivation by breaking stabilized associations. \nIn addition to antigen/receptor dynamics, other factors are also\ninvolved in delineating the scope of tolerable changes in the\norganism. These include a self-regulated system of diverse\ninteractions among several immune components comprising a complex system of antigen-presenting cells, effector T and B lymphocytes, regulatory cells and a diverse soup of molecular signals\n(Kim, Levy, and Lee 2009; Kidd et al. 2014). So, the functional\ndifference that determines recognition of the foreign results not only\nfrom an aggregate of quantitative ligand-receptor affinity\ndifferences, but also from the context in which the antigen is seen\nand the degree of interruption in network dynamics induced by such an\nimmunogen (Cohen 2000a; Cohen and Efroni 2019). Accordingly, the\noverall function of the immune system may be defined as maintenance of\nmolecular (antigenic) homeostasis (Poletaev, Stepanyuk, and Gershwin\n2008). On this general view, a systems-wide collective\nresponse—not the discriminatory power of individual lymphocytes\nor their receptors—determines identity and immune\nspecificity. \nThe so-called “ecological” perspective offers still another\nmodel of cognition, where the immune system does not employ\nrepresentations of the world, but rather “sees” the world\ndirectly (Tauber 2017: 151–156, 219–228). In this\n‘presentational’ schema, the capacity to extract\ninformation about the environment depends on pre-programmed systems of\nperception, whose organizational structures “resonate”\nwith environmental inputs (Gibson 1966; 1979). Accordingly, the\nenvironment’s informational content results from the stimulation\nof the system that already has the ability to acknowledge inputs of a\nrecognizable character. Simply, information is only that which is\nalready meaningful (Ben-Ze’ev 1993: 70–71; Gibson\n1979). This scheme would reconfigure the subject-object epistemology\ndominating current immune theory with an information-processing\nfaculty that dispenses with some knowing entity, who sits in a\n“Cartesian theater” to observe the world (Dennett\n1991). Drawing an analogy from collective colony behaviors of insects\n(Gordon 2001; Bonabeau 2001) and bacteria (Ben Jacob, Becker, Shapira,\nand Levine 2004; Ben Jacob, Shapira, and Tauber 2005), the immune\nsystem may then be modeled without centralized control or directives\nby simply following its “rules” of regulation. Such a\nmodel of “embedded” cognition holds that perception may be\nexplained independently of computational processes or representations\naltogether (L. Shapiro 2011). Simply, presentational cognition\nsubstitutes an agent, who employs representations, for a process in\nwhich the immediacy of perception removes any such intermediary.\nAccordingly, cognition is not of something, for perception is\nentirely within the system itself; the agent has disappeared, and with\nthat vacancy, representations are discarded. \nAs with Jerne’s system, in presentational cognition, no\nhierarchy exists, and no cognitive center is posited. The\nstimulus–response model has been discarded and activation\nheretofore understood as resulting from a predicate-structured\ncognitive event now refers to increased dynamic activity that results\nfrom the disruption of the network’s equilibrium. Immune\n“knowledge” accordingly shifts from a\nsignifier–signified relationship to one in which meaning is\nfirmly lodged within the system itself, i.e., a system that “knows” only itself.\nTo the extent immunology would fashion itself along these lines, the\nconception of the self partitioned from the world would be replaced by\nan agent-free information-forming and information-processing faculty\n(Orosz 2001; Forrest and Hofmeyr 2001). Such a distributed information\nprocessing system has two key features:  \nThus, paralleling current trends in other philosophical disciplines,\nphilosophy of immunology draws from, and contributes to, parallel\nstudies in the cognitive sciences that address the general problems of\nagency, cognition, and behavior. \nApart from elucidating issues pertaining to identity, individuality\nand agency of an organism in its broader ecological and evolutionary\nhistory, philosophy of immunology also contributes to discussions\nabout the origin, organization, and methods of biological knowledge.\nReflecting on explanatory practices of immunology, the epistemic\nmodality has an important practical dimension that contributes to\ndeveloping methodological strategies and conceptual tools to handle\nthe complexity of the immune system. Genomic, proteomic and\ntranscriptomic studies are producing vast amounts of immune data with\nlittle understanding of the basic organization and regulation that\nmust integrate systems-level and molecular-level approaches (Ohno\n1990; Schatz and Langmead 2013; see the entry on\n genomics and postgenomics). \nThe shift from a focus on the insularity and autonomy of the organism\nto its integration within a complex consortium of species carries a\ncontrasting holistic orientation to the reductivism characterizing the\nmolecularization of immunology (Ulvestad 2007: 65–67). The\ntheoretical implications and practical methodological re-direction\nindicate a re-alignment of research strategies for immunology and,\nmore generally, an important contribution to the larger debates\nconcerning the character and feasibility of non-reductionist research\nprograms in the life sciences (Kitcher 1984; Sarkar 1998; Wimsatt\n2007). Initially focused on the question of the relationship between\nclassical genetics and molecular biology, these debates have turned to\nexplanatory strategies in distinct biological subdisciplines, such as\nneuroscience (Craver 2005), ecology (Dupré 1993), systems\nbiology (Wolkenhauer and Green 2013) and developmental biology (Love\n2008; see the entry on\n developmental biology).\n Still awaiting broader recognition as an exemplar of explanatory\npractices in life sciences, immunology already serves as a case study\nto approach the problem of reduction and holism in biology and\nmedicine. \nDifferent models of epistemic reduction have been considered with\nlittle consensus about the applicability of this type of explanation\n(Sarkar 1998). Dissatisfaction with models of theory reduction led to\nvarious models of explanatory reduction that, unlike\ndeductive-nomological accounts, consider relationships between\nepistemic units other than theories containing laws, while relying on\nan intuitive sense of reduction as an explanation of higher level\nfeatures in terms of their parts (see the entry on\n reductionism in biology).\n A dominant concern about reduction is the so called\n“many-many” relationships between levels of analysis,\nwhere biological features are context dependent and may vary due to\nheterogeneous lower level features (Hull 1974; Fodor 1974; S. Gilbert\nand Sarkar 2000). One approach maintains that non-reductionist\nexplanations should focus on gross “cytological” features\nof the studied phenomena rather than on lower level molecular\nprocesses (Kitcher 1984). In contrast to this approach, immunologists\nassume that reduction is an attempt to explain complex immune\nphenomena in terms of isolated parts and interactions without\ntaking into consideration the entirety of structural and functional\ncomplexities (Van Regenmortel 2002). Thus, instead of assuming that\nnon-reductionist explanations must ignore lower level molecular\ndetails, holistic immunologists attempt to understand the multilevel\ncomplexity of the immune phenomena they study (Rivas et al. 2017).\nAccordingly, non-reductionist descriptions do not attempt to remain on\na descriptive, biological level of understanding, but rather adapt\npluralistic approaches that integrate distinct dimensions and frames\nof reference, i.e., both molecular and higher orders of analysis. This\nperspective aligns with recent approaches in philosophy of biology\nthat move beyond the division of lower- and higher-level explanatory\nstrategies and highlight the importance of interdisciplinary\nintegration exhibited by current scientific practice (Brigandt 2010;\nLove and Lugar 2013). \nBoth reductive and holistic immunological research agendas have vied\nfor dominance (Silverstein 2009: 25–42). The immune-chemical\nprogram, championed by Ehrlich and other immunochemists of the first\nhalf of the twentieth century, examined immune reactions in terms of\nchemical and physical forces between immune receptors and their\nligands (Silverstein 2009: 456). These immunochemists were adopting a\n“unifactoralism” strategy that endeavors to explain\ncomplex biological processes in terms of single factors (Powell and\nDupré 2008). That program was modified and renewed by the\nelucidation of the genetics of antibody diversification, a series of\ndiscoveries that placed immunology well within the molecular biology\nrevolution (Podolsky and Tauber 1997). \nStudies of immunity coupled to developmental biology, ecology, and\nevolutionary biology have balanced the molecularization of immunology\nwith an organism-based orientation. Early advocates of such\napproaches, like Metchnikoff, described immunity in terms of cells and\ncellular interactions, a “biological” perspective extended\nby Burnet, who eclectically endeavored to include underlying molecular\nprocesses (Crist and Tauber 2000; Baxter 2006: 38). He presented\nimmunity in terms of adaptation, selection, and population-level cell\nbehavior, rather than solely in terms of chemical and physical\nmolecular reactions. As already discussed, this broadened perspective\nintroduced the ‘self’ into the immune lexicon and brought\nnew figurative language associated with agency and a host of meanings\nborrowed from other human experience. And, complementing these\nholistic explanatory and narrative strategies, he also postulated the\nexistence of molecular signatures of self and considered lymphocyte\nreceptors as independent decision-makers mediating immune reactions\nbased on their physical fit with cognate antigens (Burnet 1969). Thus,\nby representing cases of theoretical integration and explanatory\nheterogeneity, epistemic strategies adopted by Burnet and other\norganism-oriented immunologists fit into the inclusion of of plurality\nand unification increasingly regarded as necessary to capture the\ncomplexity of immune functions (cf. Dupré 1993; Mitchell 2003;\nPlutynski 2013). \nMore recently, attempts to integrate molecular biology with systems\nanalysis challenge the apparent conflict between reductionist and\nholist strategies (Green et al. 2017; Mazzocchi 2012). After all,\nattempts to explain complex immunological phenomena in terms of\nisolated parts and interactions without taking into consideration the\nentirety of structural and functional complexity that these phenomena\nexhibit have been ineffective. For example, vaccine development\nstudies, when limited to investigation of the structural correlates of\nantigen-antibody interaction without deeper understanding of the\ndynamic features of a host-pathogen encounter, often prove\nunsuccessful (Van Regenmortel 2002). So, instead of assuming that\nnon-reductionist explanations must ignore lower level molecular\ndetails, system-oriented immunologists attempt to understand the\nmultilevel complexity of the immune reactions they study (Rivas et al.\n2017). Dynamical systems theory and a variety of network-based\napproaches are used in systems biology to integrate distinct levels of\nanalysis and elucidate the complexity of the biological phenomena in question\n(Green et al. 2017). Accordingly, a pluralistic approach that attends\nto distinct dimensions and frames of reference, i.e., both molecular\nand higher orders of analysis, has directed recent efforts to\nintegrate the complexity immunity (Löwy 2008: 172; see entry on\n philosophy of systems and synthetic biology).\n However, the program of melding the reductionist and holistic methods\nas complementary to each other has been slowed by both technical and\nconceptual hurdles (Fang and Casadevall 2011). How to model the system\nas a system requires the collection of information about the\ntotality of interactions to explain causal mechanisms with multiple\ninputs and stochastic outcomes. No approach has achieved dominance\nand, consequently, the question of how massive data might be\nincorporated into a systems-wide comprehensive model comprises a key\nchallenge of contemporary immunology. \nAnti-foreign imagery in immunology provides an excellent case study of\nbidirectional links between science and society (Tauber 1994, 2016;\nHowes 1999). The wide acceptance of the self-nonself discrimination\nmodel derived from the paradigmatic host-pathogen struggle that\nexemplified the nineteenth century conceptualization of the body as\nisolated from the environment. As developed by Claude Bernard, this\ninsular construct provided biology a theoretical foundation for\norganismal biology that complemented Malthusian economics, liberal\npolitical philosophy, and Comtian sociology to instantiate the\nautonomous body as a political, social, economic and medical entity\n(Foucault 1963 [1973]; Agamben 1998). Notwithstanding that\n“independence” is a political term, Bernard’s notion\nof autonomy fails to fairly represent the dialectical relationships of\nthe organism and its environment (Levins and Lewontin 1985), nor the\nevolutionary peculiarities of individuality itself (Buss 1987). \nThe depiction of the immune self as disconnecting the organism from\nits surroundings harmonized with a particular Western cultural\nexperience of seeing “ourselves as entities, separate from the\nrest of the world—as containers with insides and outsides”\n(Lakoff and Johnson 1980: 58; Fleck 1935 [1979: 174–175]).\nHowever, this extrapolation of a particular Western notion of\nsubjectivity may well be regarded a social construct (Mead 1962)\ninasmuch as cross-cultural analysis reveals how the ancient Chinese\nsensed self more like a fluid interface than as an enclosed entity\n(Geaney 2011). And contemporary anthropological studies re-confirm how\nnotions of selfhood vary between cultures (e.g., Roland 1988). From\nthis perspective, social connotations and subjective experiences go\nhand in hand with creating meaningful images of immunity and\nbiological identity. Finding its fertile soil in the fifties, the idea\nof the demarcated organism squarely fit the valorization of\nindividualism that had diffused into Western arts, politics and\nscience during this period (Barbour 1995). An insular understanding of\n“the self” at the core of these atomistic\ncharacterizations lies at the foundation of immune theory and\npractice, where contemporary psychological and philosophical\nconstructions of identity based on autonomous individuality prevail\n(Tauber 1994). \nHowever, culture critics have seized on immunology’s notions of\nautonomy as exemplifying modern notions of identity, where boundaries\nare contested, and the body becomes the localized site of battle\nbetween self and other (Sontag 1990; Haraway 1989; E. Martin 1994).\nThese commentators cite the recognized permeability of living\ncreatures, their symbiotic exchanges, and tolerance of myriad\nassimilated foreign materials to challenge the origin and cultural\nresonance of the atomistic framework. David Napier has characterized\nour “age of immunology” as an individualism marked by a\npreoccupation with the self and by an absence of transforming efforts\nto incorporate the foreign (Napier 2003). Active rejection enunciated\nwith warfare metaphors so prevalent in immunology’s\nlexicon—“attack”, “defense”,\n“invaders”—dramatically illustrate this formulation,\nboth in terms of the self/other dichotomy, as well as the privileged\nregard of individuality over community. On this view, the\n“immune self” appears as a metaphor to model Western\nculture, by invoking “immunization” as an explanatory\nmodel for understanding the core dynamics of post-industrial societies\n(Esposito 2011; Sloterdijk 2011). The metaphor’s wide\napplication—from religion and metaphysics to housing and\ncities—invokes the dialectics of borders and exchange,\nindividuality and communes, where the balance of intrusion and defense\nis invoked to characterize the “bubble” in which humans\nlive. Note, these interpretations closely resonate with the dynamics\nof immunity regarded ecologically, as discussed above.  \nThese contrasting applications of social descriptions to immunology\nreveal the ease by which the science may be employed for culture\ncriticism. But the exchange need not end with such contributions.\nHaving been implemented in the discourse of science, the imagery\nborrowed from the culture-at-large becomes transformed and then\nreturns to the social domain, impacting on portrayals of persons and\ntheir relationship with others (E. Martin 1994). On this view, the\nscience-culture exchange broadens the implications of understanding\nthe development of immune theory. For example, the political resonance\nof the self/nonself framework was evident in the context of a debate\non tissue incompatibility, whose depiction as innate and unchangeable\nharmonized with Burnet and Medawar’s elitist sympathies and\nopposition towards social Lamarckism (Lafferty 1995). The vision of\npersonhood that stood behind the self/nonself discrimination concept,\ncan be further traced back to Burnet’s self-confessed\n“harmless terror of strangers” and his\nDarwinist vision of human relationships as defined by primordial\nselfishness and incessant drives towards domination and power (Burnet\n1971: 12). Along with ongoing cultural and political transformations, our\nunderstanding of immune identity has also changed in the transition\nfrom a modernist vision of delineated selfhood towards a more complex view\nthat dispenses with the self altogether. Thus, the imagery that is\nused to represent the activity of the immune system has deep roots in\nthe broader culture that reflect dominant values and tensions defining the dialectics of the individual and her society. In sum, while immunology provides metaphors for characterizing human societies, the science in turn, draws from its supporting culture to model its\nbiology. Here we see an explicit demonstration of the\nbi-directionality of social and scientific discourses, and to draw the\nline separating the laboratory from its supporting culture again\nproves problematic (Gieryn 1995). \nTwo conceptual shifts that have marked contemporary research in\nimmunology have influenced philosophical comment on various topics in\nbiology. The first is a major revision in how the mechanics of\nimmunity are conceived. Taking account of the context in which the\nimmune reaction is regulated, the earlier conception of immune\nspecificity as arising from some simple mechanical lock and key\nmatching between selected antibodies binding to noxious antigens has\nbeen replaced with collectivist models of molecular interactions. In\naccounting for the frequency and intensity of an immune encounter,\nthis dynamic orientation portrays the immune system as a sensor of\nchange rather than structure. The sensitivity of such a\ncognitive system that must mediate multifarious immune reactions\nrequires a co-ordination of collective molecular ensembles,\nin which diverse elements together determine the extent of the immune\nresponse (Daëron 2014). Indeed, only through modulated responses\ncan immunity fulfill its diverse functions, some of which require\ntolerance of recognized substances and others full blown activation of\nrejection. Accordingly, immune theory has departed from the classical,\nself/nonself framework that depicts the immune response as a simple\n“on” and “off” binary switch, to multifaceted\nmodels that account for a spectrum of reactivities. \nThe second conceptual shift addresses how immunity mediates the\ninteractions of the organism with its environment. That ecological\norientation has inflected immunology from its earlier insular\nconceptions of the organism to a dynamic interactive view that\nhighlights how life experience alters the immune response to external\nchallenges and opportunities. With this broadened perspective, the\nidea of immunity extends beyond defense of an atomistic\nindividual, to include the mediation of the organism’s\necological economy, both defensive and assimilative. This includes the\ninternal environment as well, inasmuch as the microbiome, established\nthrough immune niche formation, has increasingly focused attention on\nthe prevalence of immune tolerance, symbiosis, and the biology\ncharacterized by cooperative relationships of various sorts (Eberl\n2010; Bilate and LaFaille 2012). \nIn short, the philosophical challenge of defining immune identity is\nframed by differing orientations, namely, autonomous individuality\nversus collective ensemble (both applicable to the regulation of the\nimmune response and contextual placement in the environment). Which\nversion chosen then leads to strikingly different answers to\nimmunology’s key questions:  \nEach of these issues directly pertains to philosophical considerations\nabout the character of the organism, the relationships of parts to the\nwhole, principles of biological organization and regulation, the\nconstruction of cognitive schemas, and the ability of models to\ncapture complex organic functions. \nIn conclusion, although firmly embedded in philosophy of biology and\nengaging in closely related concerns, the philosophy of immunology has\nbecome an established discipline with distinctive interests and\ncontributions. The immunological matters of interest to philosophers\ndo not always overlap with those that dominate immunology’s\ncontemporary research program. This divergence highlights how\nphilosophy of immunology has emerged as an autonomous field with its\nown subjects of attention and methods of inquiry that complement\nrather than mimic or replicate the pursuits in related areas of\ntheoretical and experimental immunology. Moreover, philosophical\nstudies of immunology have contributed to a wide range of pivotal\ntopics engaged by philosophers of biology—organismal identity;\nindividuality; dynamic causation in complex systems (integrating\ncomplexity theory with big data studies); the characterization of the\ngoals and methods of systems biology; the organization of information;\nthe characterization of the normative and deviant; and personal\nontology (self). Each of these areas of research impact other\nbiological disciplines of interest to philosophers, i.e., development,\necology, genetics, evolution and cognition. And beyond the purview of\nphilosophy of biology, studies of immunology contribute to the more\ngeneral discussions of reductionism/anti-reductionism, theory change\nand conceptual modeling, and social and cultural studies of science\n(i.e., the function of metaphors in science, the role of a scientific\ndiscourse). In sum, a rich two-way traffic between philosophers of\nimmunology and philosophers of science has emerged that allows the\nformer to use tried-and-tested conceptual tools developed by their\ncolleagues, while providing a unique outlook for the latter. Given the\ncentrality of immunology in modern biology and the unique perspective\noffered by this science on crucial philosophical problems, further\nengagement not only seems likely, but an imperative for philosophy of\nscience writ large.
