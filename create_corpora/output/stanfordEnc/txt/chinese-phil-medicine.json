(Zhang Xichun\n1918–1934, 296).\n\n\n\nAt first glance, this assertion seems improbable to say the\nleast. This essay addresses some of the connections between\nChinese philosophy and Chinese medicine in both intellectual and social\naspects.\n\n\n\nThe first section locates medicine among the Chinese sciences and\nintroduces the intellectual shared common ground of Chinese philosophy\nand Chinese medicine, including shared theories of qi,\nyin-yang and “Five Agents” (wuxing) and\ntheir use in analogies between the human body and the state and cosmos,\nincluding the development of a systematic medical theory of the\nbody. Section Two introduces the important medical contributions\nof “nurturing life” (yang sheng) traditions. \nSection Three takes up what has been represented as a long shared\nhistory of Daoism and medicine in the works of three great Daoist\nphysicians. Section Four returns to the views of Zhang Xichun and his\nclaims for an explicit link between Chinese Medicine and Chinese\nPhilosophy.\n\n\n\nBefore addressing connections between Chinese philosophy and Chinese\nmedicine it is necessary to make two clarifications on the meaning of\nthe term Chinese medicine. Chinese medicine could in principle\nrefer to: (1) the full range of medical systems used in contemporary\nChina, including Western biomedicine; (2) the traditional indigenous\nChinese medicine that is conventionally referred to as Traditional\nChinese Medicine (TCM); and (3) other indigenous medical systems,\ndistinct from but TCM, practiced by non-Chinese or minorities who live\nin areas that historically were part of China or are now part of the\nPeoples Republic of China, for example, Korean and Tibetan\nmedicine. For purposes of this essay I use the term Chinese\nmedicine only to refer to TCM, but including issues of the integration\nof TCM and Western medicine. Second, Chinese medicine, in the\nsense of TCM just discussed, includes a wider range of practices than\ndoes Western medicine. In particular it includes: (1)\n“medicine” in its conventional sense of practices that cure\nor prevent disease, treat disease and injury and assist in childbirth,\netc.; (2) a range of practice to prevent disease in the broadest sense\nby maintaining health, including practices associated with the martial\narts such as Taijiquan (also known as T’ai chi); and (3) a range of\npractices that extend health by seeking longevity. In particular,\na clear account of Chinese medicine cannot confine itself to the first\nof these only. \n\nWithin a Chinese historical context, medicine (yi 醫)\nwas one of several qualitative sciences. It included\n“nurturing life” (yang sheng 養生), a\nbroad category that comprised a wide range of self-cultivation\ntechniques. In later periods, medicine also included materia\nmedica (bencao 本草) and internal (nei\ndan 內丹) and external (wai dan\n外丹) alchemy. The early Chinese qualitative and\nquantitative sciences were specific, with no unified notion of science\n(Sivin 1982 and 1990). \n\nSecondly, medical works, like other scientific works, were classified\nas technical specialties, distinct from generalist works, including\nthe “Masters” texts associated with Chinese philosophy\n(Raphals 2008–2009, forthcoming). Medicine and its related disciplines\nappear in the last section of the Bibliographic Treatise (chapter 30)\nof the Standard History of the Han Dynasty (Han shu). This\nTreatise consists of six sections. The first two (“Six\nClassics” and “Masters”) contain philosophical\nworks. The last two are technical: “Numbers and\nTechniques” (Shu shu 數術), and\n“Recipes and Methods” (Fang ji 方技).\nThe latter includes works on medicine and longevity, including the\ncategories of medical classics (yi jing 醫經),\nclassical recipes (jing fang 經方), sexual arts\n(fang zhong 房中, also referred to as “arts\nof the bedchamber”), and immortality practices (shen\nxian 神仙). These chapters reflect the concerns and\nexpertise of the technical and ritual specialists closely associated\nwith the “Recipe Masters” (fang shi\n方士) associated with the Han court. But their concerns\nalso appear in early philosophical texts to such an extent that any\nseparation of their philosophical from their religious and technical\ncontent is arbitrary and artificial (Harper 1998 and 1999; Kalinowski\n2004). \n\nNonetheless, Chinese philosophy and Chinese medicine shared important\nintellectual contexts in their early development. The origins of\nscience in China seem to lie in an amalgam of ideas from both\nphilosophers and technical specialists, including physicians.\nAccording to Sivin (1988 and 1990) the basic Chinese sciences were\nestablished some time between the first century BCE and the first\ncentury CE through what he describes as a combination of Ru\n(“Confucian”) ideas and ideas from technical specialists,\nespecially experts in yin-yang, Five Agents (wu xing)\n五行, henceforward wuxing and technical expertise\ntraditions associated with “Numbers and Techniques”\n(Shu shu) and “Recipes and Methods” (Fang\nji, mentioned above). \n\nKey to this amalgam were several concepts shared by both groups but\ndeployed in very different ways. Early medical – and\ncosmological – thinking depicts a cosmos ultimately composed of\nqi 氣 (the energy that constitutes and organizes matter\nand causes growth and change) in processes of constant change, based on\nthe interactions of yin and yang 陰陽 and\nthe “Five Agents” or “Five Powers”\n(wuxing. \nSee Graham 1986, Raphals 1998 and 2013). \n\nPhilosophers deployed these ideas in (1) the yin-yang cosmology of\nthe Book of Changes or Yi jing, (2) theories of\ncorrelative correspondence between heaven, earth and humanity as a\nshared representation of cosmic order, and (3) the idea of a\n“classic” or “canon” as the founding text of a\ntextual lineage. The authors of the first medical classic, the\nYellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine (Huang Di\nneijing), also deployed these concepts, in particular in models of\nthe human body as a yin-yang and Five Agent microcosm of the\ncosmos. \n\nFinally, physicians and philosophers created textual lineages and\naccounts of textual authority. The most important medical works\nof this kind are the Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal\nMedicine  and the Materia Medica of Shen\nNong (Shen Nong bencao), ascribed to the “Divine\nHusbandmen” Shen Nong, who, according to legend, tested hundred\nof herbs and plants to ascertain their curative properties. By\ncontrast, the evidence of recently excavated texts indicates that the\nHuang Di neijing derived from prior textual traditions that\nwere subsequently lost (Harper 1998) and that the extant version is a\ncomposite of several earlier texts (Keegan 1988, Unschuld 2003,\nUnschuld and Tessenow 2011, Yamada 1979). \n\nTheories of qi and yin and yang also are\nimportantly pursued in early philosophical works. Several Warring\nStates texts contain references to the nature of qi,\nyin and yang, and their relation to health and\nlongevity. The Zhuangzi clearly identifies qi as the\nbasis of the physical constitution of the body: “Human birth is\ncaused by the gathering together of qi” (22, 733,\nmisleadingly translated by Watson (2013, 180) as “purity”).\nThe Zhuangzi also describes harmonizing or taking charge of\nthe six qi. \n\nSimilarly, the Springs and Autumns of Master Lü\n(Lüshi chunqiu) describes sages as making their numinous\nessences (jing shen 精神) tranquil, and preserving\nand increasing their longevity (3.2, pp. 3b-4a, trans. Knoblock and\nRiegel 2000, 3/2.1, 99). \n\nIn all these texts a sage or numinous person achieves that status\nthrough both meta-physical and physical means. This is the focus of\nDaoist “Nurturing Life” techniques (discussed in section\n2). \n\nWe find a different account of these concepts in technical\nworks. The apocryphal “founder” of scientific thought\nin China was Zou Yan 鄒衍 (305–240 BCE), who is credited\nwith combining and systematizing yin-yang and wuxing\ntheory. No works attributed to him survive. Sima Qian’s\nbiography in Shi ji 76 describes him as a member of the Jixia\n稷下 Academy, originally from the state of Qi in present\nday Shandong (Needham 1956: 231–34). By contrast, the Han\nshu describes him as a Recipe Master (fang shi). \nThis is important because of the connection between fang shi\nand medicine. \n\nFang shi practiced medicine and divination and claimed to\npossess secret texts and formulae. They gained great influence during\nthe earlier part of the Han dynasty, though their influence waned by\nthe later Han. The fang shi used yin-yang and Five Agents cosmology.\nThey seem to have originated from the Shandong peninsula, and were\nparticularly associated with the mantic arts, including the use of the\nsexagenary cycle of stems and branches, the Yi jing, and\ndivination by stars, dreams, physiognomy, the winds, and by the use of\npitch pipes (Ngo 1976). \n\nIt is almost impossible to separate Chinese ideas of body, state,\ncosmos from concepts of “nature,” though, as Nathan Sivin\npoints out, there is no indigenous Chinese term for\n“nature” before the nineteenth century. Over the course of\nthe last three centuries BCE, Chinese understandings of the physical\nworld developed to reflect, and mirror, political consolidation (Sivin\n1995, 2007). These new ideas of cosmic order—correspondence\nbetween microcosm (the body) and macrocosm (the cosmos)—appeared\nin new representations of the body, the state, and the cosmos that were\nbased on systematic applications and correlations of the ideas of\nyin-yang and wuxing. They are prominent in Warring\nStates politico-philosophical writings such as the Springs and\nAutumns of Master Lü (Lü Shi chunqiu) of\nLü Buwei (291?-235 BCE) and the Luxuriant Dew of the Springs\nand Autumns (Chunqiu fanlü), attributed to Dong\nZhongshu (179–104 BCE). \n\nTheories of qi, yin-yang and wuxing also\ninform medical works. New systematic medical theories based on\nthese ideas were systematized in a cosmological framework in the\nHuang Di neijing, a complex and multi-layered text, probably\ncompiled in the first century BCE (Keegan 1988, Unschuld 2003, Yamada\n1979). It presents a systematic cosmology that analogizes the\nbody, the state, and the cosmos in systems of “correlative\ncosmology” (Graham 1986b, Sivin 1995, Lloyd and Sivin 2002). It\ndescribes relations and analogies between the body (including the\nemotions), the state and the cosmos in terms of yin-yang and\nwuxing. For example, the Huang Di neijing describes\ncorrespondence between the articulations of the body and the cosmos,\nspecifically between heaven and earth and the upper and lower parts of\nthe body: \n\nTheories of yin-yang, qi and wuxing also inform\nWarring States and Han astrocalendrics, observational astronomy and the\nstudy of astronomical portents, and in the so-called “correlative\ncosmologies” of many Han dynasty texts. \n\nSeveral Warring States texts express the need to preserve\none’s person, self, or essential nature: \n\nOne way to do this was to maintain health by nurturing life\n(yang sheng), an area of common ground for speculative\nthinkers and practitioners of traditional medical arts. The term\nyang sheng first appears in the Zhuangzi and\nthen throughout a range of second (BCE) century medical literature. \n\nThe third chapter of the Zhuangzi is titled “The Lord\nof Nurturing Life” (Yang sheng zhu\n養生主). In it, the expert butcher Pao Ding\ninstructs Duke Hui of Liang. Pao Ding describes the process of\nmastering his skill. His method is initially analytic; he begins by\nstudying oxen as wholes, next as parts, and finally with faculties\nbeyond ordinary vision. This discourse is presented as an instruction\nto the Lord Wenhui, who ends by saying that: “Pao Ding has taught\nme how to nurture life” (yang sheng, Zhuangzi\n3, 124, cf. Watson 2013, 20). \n\nAnother passage in the Outer Chapters refers to some of these\nexercises. It contrasts “real sages” who follow the way of\nheaven and earth with (among others) practitioners of “nurturing\nlife” traditions who: \n\nThe passage continues. Real sages: \n\nSince the whole point of the Zhuangzi passage is to oppose\n“guiding and pulling” and other longevity techniques to\ntrue sagehood, it does not dwell on their details. We can get a better\nidea of what he might have been talking about from other sources. Some\nof these ideas are elaborated in a chapter of the Guanzi\ntitled “Inner Cultivation” (Nei ye), which\ndescribes the cultivation of qi, as well as vital essence\n(jing), and spirit (shen). It describes Dao as\nliterally pervading the body or the person of a sage: \n\nThe Zhuangzi and other texts refer to the figure of the\nspirit person or shen ren 神人 as someone who has\neffectively transformed the physical body and the qi that\nconstitutes it. The Zhuangzi describes spirit person of Guye,\nwho concentrates his spirit (shen), avoids the five grains,\nrides the clouds, and, through the concentration of his shen\nprotects others against sicknesses and epidemics and makes the harvest\nripen (Zhuangzi 1, 28; cf. Graham, 1986a, 46). This passage\nsuggests that a sage can have a nurturing effect on the world by acting\nat a distance, possibly as an unintended by-product of self-cultivation\npractices. \n\nOther passages in the Zhuangzi extol the abilities of\nspecialized craftsmen who possess highly technical skills. These\nstories liken mastery of the Way to mastery of a craft. They also\nemphasize the technical skills of commoners. Commoners, rather than\nrulers, are presented as sage-like figures. These technical experts\ninclude arrow makers, bell-stand carvers, boatmen, butchers, cicada\ncatchers, potters, sword makers, and wheelwrights (Raphals 2005). It is\ncurious that these passages never include physicians.  \n\nIn the Han dynasty, “nurturing life” techniques became a\nmajor concern of the Recipe Masters (fang shi) of the Han\ncourt (Ngo 1976). Texts on nurturing life include methods for absorbing\nand circulating qi in the body—for example, breathing and\nmeditation exercises, diet, drugs and sexual techniques. \n\nMedical and mantic texts excavated from tombs make it clear that a\nwide range of longevity techniques had been developed before the Han\ndynasty (Harper 1998, 33). Most important is a corpus of medical\nmanuscripts excavated from Mawangdui 馬王堆\n(Changsha, Hubei), dated to 169 BCE. This tomb is best known for its\ntwo versions of the Daode jing, but it is meaningful to locate\nthose texts among other texts of a scientific provenance found in the\ntomb (Harper 1998 and 2000, Ma Jixing 1992, Zhou Yimou 1994, Zhou \nYimou and Xiao Zuotai 1987). \n\nSix of the medical manuscripts are concerned with nurturing life in\nvarious ways. “Harmonizing Yin and Yang” (He yin\nyang 合陰陽) and “Discussion of the\nRealized Way of All Under Heaven” (Tianxia zhi dao tan\n天下至道談) are concerned with sexual\ncultivation. They refer to the movements and postures of animals as\nwhole-body metaphors for sexual techniques. An example is the\ndescription of ten postures in “Harmonizing Yin and\nYang”: \n\nThese texts emphasize that sexual activity is a natural process, but\none that must be regulated. As the “Realized Way of All Under\nHeaven” puts it, people know by nature how to breathe and how to\neat, but everything else is a matter of learning and habit. “What\nassists life is eating; what injures life is lust. Therefore the sage\nwhen conjoining male and female invariably possesses a model”\n(Zhou and Xiao 1989, 431; Harper 1998, 432). \n\n“Recipes for Nurturing Life” (Yang sheng fang\n養生方) consists of eighty-seven recipes, including\nfood, drugs, and beverages, along with several sexual cultivation\nexercises. “Eliminating Grain and Eating Vapor” (Que gu\nshi qi 卻榖食氣) specifies diet and\nbreathing exercises to be performed in the morning and evening, and a\nseasonal regimen of breath cultivation through consuming six qi and\navoiding another five (Harper 1998, 25–30). Another text, the\n“Ten Questions” (Shi wen 十問) gives\nadvice on techniques for nurturing life (Harper 1998, 22–30), for\nexample: \nYao asked Shun: “In Under-heaven what is most\nvaluable?” \nShun replied: “Life is most valuable.” \nYao said: “How can life be cultivated?” Shun said:\n“Investigate yin and yang.” (Zhou Yimou and Xiao Zuotao\n1989, 379; Harper 1998, 399) \n\nFinally, the “Drawings of Guiding and Pulling”\n(Daoyin tu 導引圖) is a series of forty-four\ndrawings of human figures performing exercises, some with captions.\nSome are described in another excavated text from tomb no. 247,\nZhangjiashan 張家山 (Jiangling, Hubei). The\n“Pulling Book” (Yin shu 引書) from\nZhangjiashan describes exercises that refer to or are named after\nanimals, including inchworms, snakes, mantises, wild ducks, owls,\ntigers, chickens, bears, frogs, deer, and dragons. Both exemplify a\ntradition of exercise for both therapy and health known as\ndaoyin (pulling and guiding). \n\nThe “yang sheng culture” of these texts\nemphasized control over physiological and mental processes, both\nunderstood as self-cultivation, through the transformation of qi.\n“Self-cultivation” in this context included moral\nexcellence, health, and longevity (V. Lo 2001). \n\nWe can get a broader notion of what these techniques were like if we\nturn to the list of titles from the “Recipes and Methods”\nsection of the Han shu Bibliographic Treatise, mentioned\nabove. One of the few extant texts it lists is the Huang Di\nneijing, along with the titles of lost medical works on nurturing\nlife, health, and longevity. The “Classical Recipes”\n(jing fang) section includes titles such as “Recipes for\nMarried Women and Infants” (Furen ying er fang\n婦人嬰兒方) and “Food Prohibitions\nof Shen Nong and Huang Di” (Shen Nong Huang Di shi jin\n神農黃帝食禁). The sexual arts\nsection includes “Recipes of Huang Di and the Three Sage-Kings\nfor Nurturing Yang” (Huang Di san wang yang yang fang\n黃帝三王養陽方) and\n“Inner Chamber Recipes of the Three Schools for Having\nChildren” (San jia nei ju you zi fang\n三家內房有子方). Other\nsections describe physical exercises and therapeutic techniques, such\nas the “Stepping and Pulling Book of Huang Di and Other Masters”\n(Huang Di za zi bu yin\n黃帝雜子步引 (Han shu 30,\n1778–79). \n\nAnother medical text from Mawangdui is a recipe (fang\n方) manual titled Recipes for Fifty-Two Ailments\n(Wushier bing fang 五十二病方,\ntranslated and discussed in Harper 1998). Recipe texts also have been\nexcavated from Zhangjiashan (Li Ling 1993 and 2000). In addition, the\nMawangdui tombs also contained hexagram divination texts and charts and\ndiagrams on cloud divination and physiognomy, including the oldest\nknown representation of a comet (Li Ling 1993). \n\nIn summary, most of these texts can be described as part of a\nyang sheng culture, which offered and emphasized control over\nphysiological processes of the body and mind that were understood as\ntransformations of qi. What is the relation of these detailed\ntechnical texts to philosophy? These technical arts form a continuum\nwith philosophy because their transformations were understood as\nself-cultivation in the coterminous senses of moral excellence, health,\nand longevity (rather than medical pathology), and physiological\ntransformation through the manipulation of qi (V. Lo\n2001). \n\nMark Csikszentmihalyi (2004) describes them as part of an\n“embodied virtue” tradition of self-cultivation practices.\nThey structured much of early Daoist philosophy and medical theory, and\nalso had profound effects on early Chinese ethics and metaphysics (V.\nLo 2005). Such “material virtue” traditions held that the\nbody-mind was constructed of qi and that embodied\nself-cultivation practices could transform qi. These views\ninformed Warring States accounts of dietary practices, exercise\nregimens, breath meditation, sexual cultivation techniques, and other\ntechnical traditions associated with fang shi. Material virtue\ntraditions also had important links with Daoist texts, southern\nschools, and the “moralization” of health in traditions\nthat culminated in the Huang Di neijing. Accounts of these\npractices appear in passing in the texts of the received tradition.\nMany more come from texts excavated from tombs. \n\nGe Hong 葛洪 (283–343 or 363 CE, a physician and Daoist\nfrom of the Eastern Jin (317–420 CE), was the first of several\nexplicitly Daoist physicians to write about the practice of\nalchemy. He was the author of the Teachings of the Master Who\nEmbraces Simplicity (Baopuzi\n抱樸子). The Baopuzi consists of\nseventy chapters (pian 篇): twenty “Inner\nChapters” (Baopuzi neipian\n抱樸子内篇) and fifty “Outer\nChapters” (Baopuzi waipian\n抱樸子外篇). The two were\neffectively different books that were not combined under one title\nuntil a thousand years after Ge Hong’s time (Sivin1969, 389. For\na partial translation of the waipian see Sailey 1978). Ge Hong\nwas also the author of the Collected Life Stories of Immortals\n(Shen xian zhuan 神仙傳, trans. Campany\n2002) and Biographies of Recluses (Yin yi zhuan\n隱逸傳).  \n\nAccording to his autobiography (Baopuzi waipian, ch. 50;\nSailey 1978, 242–272; Ware (1966, 6–21), in his youth he studied the\nConfucian classics, but at the same time, became interested in\nquasi-medical techniques for nourishing the body with the goal of\nachieving immortality. He became a student of the alchemical\nmaster Zheng Yin 鄭隱 (c.215-c.302 CE), and remained his\ndisciple for some fifteen years. After brief success, he abandoned a\nmilitary career to go to the capital at Luoyang to search for books on\nimmortals. After difficulties during the political unrest in the south,\nGe Hong entirely gave up political life and devoted himself to\nimmortality practices. In 316 he returned to the north and was\nnamed a marquis by the Eastern Jin court and took up an administrative\npost. On learning that cinnabar had been discovered in the south\n(in present day North Vietnam), he secured a position as magistrate in\nthe south in Guangxi, where he settled at Mt. Luofu\n羅浮 and began the study of alchemy, remaining there until\nhis death (Sailey 1978, 277–78; Ware 1981; Wells 2003). \n\nGe Hong was the first to systematically describe the history and\ntheory of Daoist immortality techniques such as “preserving\nunity” (shou yi 守一), circulating energy\n(xing qi 行氣), “guiding and pulling”\n(dao yin), and sexual longevity techniques (fang\nzhong房中, Baopuzi neipian, ch. 2; Lai\nChi-tim 1998, 203-204). But his accounts of these techniques clearly\nreflect an interest in self-cultivation according to broadly Confucian\nprinciples. For example, he considered moral self-cultivation a\nprecondition for the search for immortality; self-cultivation included\nsuch Confucian virtues as benevolence (ren), trustworthiness\n(xin), loyalty (zhong) and filiality (xiao).\nGe Hong criticized Daoist “pure conversation” (qing\ntan) and emphasized the importance of both moral virtue and Daoist\nstudy. His specifically Daoist writings emphasize the importance\nof both “mystery” (xuan 玄) and\nemptiness (xu 虛), and all-embracing unity, which the\nDaoist must actively preserve by meditation practices, techniques of\n“preserving the essence” (bao jing\n保精) and consuming medicinal herbs (fu yao\n服藥). \n\nAs an alchemist, Ge Hong experimented with drugs and minerals. The\n“Gold Elixir” (Jin dan 金丹) and\n“Yellow and White” (Huang bai 黄白)\nchapters of the Baopuzi neipian survey the\nhistory of alchemy and describe in detail a method for “alloying\ncinnabar,” quoting from ancient recipes and “cinnabar\nmethods.” The “Immortal Herbs” (Xian yao\n仙藥) chapter gives information on medical herbs (Gao 1996,\nQing 1994, Theobald 2013). \n\nAlthough Robinet (1997) insists that Ge Hong was only interested in\npharmacology as an adjunct to alchemy, the Baopuzi also\nincludes important material on medicine and pharmacology. Other\npharmacological treatises attributed to him are no longer extant:\nPrescriptions for Rescuing the Dying after the Pulse-taking\n(Zhou hou jiu zu Fang\n肘後救卒方), Prescriptions from the\nJade Box (玉函方 Yu han fang), Herbal\nRecipes from the Gold Cabinet (Jin gui yaofang\n金匱藥方), and Prescriptions for Emergencies\nafter Taking the Pulses (Zhou hou bei ji fang\n肘后備急方), which is said to be the\nfirst Chinese text to mention smallpox (tian hua bing\n天花病). Thirteen texts attributed to Ge Hong are\npreserved in the Daoist Canon (Dao zang 道藏), but\nmost are probably later works (Robinet 1997, 78–113, Theobald\n2013). \n\nIn summary, Ge Hong’s writings combine interests in Confucian\nethics, Daoist self-cultivation and alchemical techniques, and the\ndetails of medicine and pharmacology.  \n\nTao Hongjing陶弘景 (456–536) was the effective\nfounder of Shangqing 上清 (Highest Clarity) Daoism. He held\nseveral court positions under the Liu Song and Qi dynasties. In\n492 he retired to Mount Mao (Maoshan 茅山), where he became\ninterested in the so-called Shangqing revelations to Yang Xi a\ncentury before his time. He set himself to collect and edit\nthe original manuscripts connected with these revelations. The\nresult was the Declarations of the Perfected (Zhen\ngao 真誥). When the Liang dynasty came to power\nin 502, he joined the court of Emperor Wu (r. 502–549), on whom he had\nconsiderable influence. \n\nTao was educated in Daoist traditions associated with the Daode\njing, Zhuangzi, and the works of Ge Hong; and was initiated in the\nLinbao school at the age of thirty. He was also actively engaged\nin mostly unsuccessful attempts to produce alchemical elixirs\n(Strickman 1979, 152).  \n\nTao’s father and grandfather were experts in medicinal drugs, and he\nshared their interests in materia medica and medicine. Shortly\nafter compiling the Zhen gao he wrote a major work of\npharmacology: the Collected Commentaries to the Canonical\nPharmacopoeia (Bencao jing jizhu\n本草經集注), a commentary and re-edition\nof the Shen Nong bencao, a Han work of pharmacology attributed\nto Shen Nong, the legendary inventor of materia medica. Tao\ndoubled the account of 365 drugs in the original and also rearranged\nthe material (502–557), (Predagio 2013, 968–71; Robinet 1993;\nStrickman 1979). \n\nTao Hongjing is thus another clear case of overlapping interests\nbetween philosophy and medicine. His interests clearly included\nDaoist philosophy and practice, medicine, pharmacology and alchemy. \n\nSun Simiao 孫思邈 (581–682) was the author\nof two major works on medical practice and a work on Daoist\nlongevity prescriptions. He has been worshiped as the\n“Medicine Buddha,” and as the “King of Medicine” (yao\nwang). Sun is said to have taken up medicine to strengthen\nhis own health after childhood illnesses. He also treated\nrelatives and neighbors, and practiced medicine near the Tang capital\nof Chang’an. He also traveled widely to learn new prescription recipes.\nAfter completing his first book, he lived in seclusion on Mt. Wubai\n(Wubai shan, later known, after him, as Yao wang Shan), where\nhe followed Daoist principles. He refused several official positions at\nthe Sui and Tang courts, preferring to treat ordinary people in the\ncountryside. \n\nHis biography (in both of the two Standard Histories of the Tang\nDynasty, trans. Sivin 1968, 81–144) emphasizes his interests in\nphilosophy, noting his particular study of the Yi jing,\nDaode jing, works concerned with yin-yang theory, and shu\nshu numerical calculations. His work reflected these\ninterests in yin-yang and wuxing theory and\nmacrocosm-microcosm correspondences between the body and cosmos. \nHe is also the first Chinese physician to write extensively on medical\nethics. \n\nSun Simiao is the author of two major medical works.\nPrescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold (Qian jin fang\n千金方, printed in 652 CE) was a comprehensive\ntreatise on the practice of medicine in thirty chapters. It contained\nherbal remedies and reviewed the history of medicine since the Han\nDynasty, starting with the Huang Di neijing. \n\nThe introduction to the Qianjin fang (ch. 1) describes the\ncharacteristics of a great physician and describes inappropriate\nconduct, especially the desire for wealth or reputation. \nAccording to Sun, a great physician should not pay attention to status,\nwealth or age; he should not care whether a person is attractive, a\nfriend or enemy, or whether the person is (Han) Chinese or educated. He\nshould meet everyone on equal grounds and should always act as if he\nwere thinking of a\nclose\nrelative\n(ch.1. For translation see Unschuld 1979, 29–33). \n\nThe Qian jin fang also includes chapters on diet (ch. 26),\nnurturing life (yang xing, ch. 27), pulse diagnosis (ch. 28),\nacumoxa (chs. 29–30, the combination of acupuncture and moxibustion),\nmassage, and exercise. His interests also included the treatment\nof women (ch. 2–4) and children (ch. 5). May chapters are concerned\nwith herbal recipes. Sun Simiao emphasized that the effectiveness\nof herbal recipes depended on correct identification and preparation,\nincluding gathering herbs at the right time and drying them\ncorrectly. His formulas came from both famous physicians of the\npast and his own contemporaries, including minorities and foreigners.\nHe also edited formulas to eliminate non-essential\ningredients.  \n\nThe second book is a supplement to the first. The supplement\n(Qian jin yi fang 千金翼方,\nprinted in 682) records some thirty years of Sun’s own experience with\nspecial attention to folk remedies. It adds some eight hundred\nrecipes, with details on collection and preparation for two\nhundred. Some are new herbs, including herbs from India. It also\nrefers to many mystical and magical practices, including exorcisms,\ntalismans, incantations and descriptions of acumoxa points effective\nagainst demons. \n\nSun was also the author of several works on Daoist alchemy, which he\nis believed to have practiced (he died at the age of 101). These\ninclude the Essential Instructions from the Scripture of the Elixirs of\nGreat Clarity (Taiqing Danjing Yaojue, ca. 640), an anthology\nof some thirty selected methods (Sivin 1968, 262–264). His\n“Essay on Preserving and Nourishing Life” (Sheyang\nlun 攝養論) gives monthly advice on food,\nsleeping habits and action of good and ill auspice (Predagio 2013,928). \n\nIn summary, Sun Simiao, like Ge Hong and Tao Honjing combines\nexplicit interests in Daoist philosophy, medicine, materia medica and\nalchemy. These physicians were informed by the yin-yang\ntheory and cosmology of the Yi jing and the philosophical\nconcepts of the Zhuangzi and Daode jing.  But,\ndespite their strong philosophical interests, the major contributions\nof their writings lie in the areas of medicine, pharmacology and\nalchemy. \n\nThe views of the physician Zhang Xichun (1860–1933) provide an\nimportant testimony to the complex relations between Chinese medicine\nand Chinese philosophy. Zhang’s life coincided with the\ntransition of China from the Qing dynasty to the modern era, a period\nin which major Chinese intellectuals were preoccupied by questions of\nthe relative merits of indigenous philosophical and scientific\ntraditions as compared to foreign knowledge, especially of science and\nmedicine. \n\nThe medical context for these debates was the differences between\nChinese and Western medicine, and the best role for traditional Chinese\nmedicine in modern times. Zhang was a major contributor to these\ndebates. Zhang Xichun was trained by his father in traditional\nmedicine from youth, but he was also educated in the classics of\nChinese philosophy. He became a leading proponent of the\n“school of converging and connecting” Chinese and Western\nmedicine (hui tong xue pai\n匯衕學派. For the life of Zhang Xichun\nsee Scheid 1995, 5–6). \n\nZhang’s book contains an essay explicitly titled “Concerning\nThe Relation of Philosophy and Medicine.” It is so central\nto the topic of this essay that it is worth quoting at length. \nZhang begins by remarking that recent (Chinese) medical journals accuse\ntraditional Chinese philosophy of holding back the progress of\nmedicine. He responds: “their authors do not understand the\nuse of philosophy, nor do they understand that philosophy is actually\nthe basis of medicine.” He quotes a passage from the Book\nof Songs (Shi jing) says: “he is intelligent and wise, and\nprotects his own person” (Shi jing, “Zheng\nmin” 烝民, Mao 260). The passage refers to a\ncertain Zhong Shanfu 仲山甫, a virtuous minister of\nKing Xuan of Zhou (r. 827–782 BCE). The point is that\n“protecting one’s person means not only protecting oneself from\nattach by thieves or robbers but also protecting one’s person from\nbeing beset by disease and illness. But, Zhang continues, the\npoint of the quotation is that people must possess an inherent aptitude\nfor intelligence and wisdom. They must also make a systematic\nstudy of wisdom and virtue, and only then can we protect our\npersons.  \n\nHe next identifies the combination of inherent aptitude and\nsystematic study behind ”being intelligent and wise and\nprotecting one’s own person“ with what the recluse-hermits of\nantiquity called ”the dao of nurturing life (yang sheng zhi\ndao 養生之道). In his view, the\nnurturing life (yang sheng) practices of antiquity are what we\nnow call philosophy. \n\nHe goes on to argue that those who had the benevolent disposition of\na junzi and themselves understood nurturing life practices wanted to\nenable others to be able to nurture their own lives. \nHowever, for people who do not use understanding and wisdom to protect\ntheir persons, the way of nurturing life was not sufficient, and they\nthemselves could not help falling ill: “therefore they\npromulgated the principles of philosophy and originated the disciplines\nof medicine and pharmacology (materia medica) in order to offer\nassistance to those who themselves were unable to engage in nurturing\nlife practices.”  \n\nHe then goes on to identify specific physicians with this derivation\nof medicine from philosophy, including Ge Hong, Tao Hongjing and Sun\nSimiao. All these great physicians, he argues, were really\nphilosophers who wrote important philosophical works. \n\nHe then turns to the Huang Di neijing, which begins with a\nchapter titled “Discourse on the True [Qi Endowed by] Heaven in\nHigh Antiquity” (Shang Gu Tian Zhen Lun). It says:\n“In highest antiquity there were true men (zhen ren) who\nupheld [the patterns of] heaven and earth and grasped yin and yang,\nexhaled and inhaled essence qi (jing qi), stood alone\nand guarded their spirit (shen), and their muscles and flesh\nwere like one, and thus they were able to achieve longevity in\ncorrespondence with heaven and earth” (Huang Di neijing\n1, trans. after Unschuld 2011, 42). \n\nZhang argues that, according to the neijing, these realized\npersons were able to use these techniques to transform their\ntemperament and disposition and to achieved achieve an infinite life\nexpectancy. He thus identifies a clear link from the realized\npersons of high antiquity to the great schools of Chinese philosophy\nthrough the methods and theories attributed to the Yellow Emperor. \n\nHis point is that, although the neijing is an exposition of\nmedicine: “it necessarily begins with philosophy and takes\nphilosophy as the study of how to safeguard one’s person. People\nmust first be able themselves to protect their own persons; only then\ncan they represent to others how to protect their persons. Taking\nphilosophy as the way to protect one’s person, it is by means of the\nprinciples of philosophy that we are able to preserve our bodies by\ntransforming our qi. Taking medicine is the way to\nprotect other people’s bodies, it is by first completely\nunderstanding the transformation of qi in one’s own person that [the\nphysician] is able to represent to others how to adjust the\ntransformation of qi in their own bodies.” He concludes:\n“from this we understand that philosophy is the true source of\nmedicine, or rather that medicine is the natural outcome of philosophy.\nThis is why the Neijing states explicitly that the study of medicine\nmust start from philosophy.” How, he concludes, could\nphilosophy obstruct medicine? (Zhang Xichun 1918–1934, 296–98). \n\nIn conclusion, this brief account addresses important issues in the\nconnections between Chinese philosophy and the development of Chinese\nmedicine. Philosophical texts clearly influenced medicine in\nseveral ways. First, both are grounded in theories of qi,\nyin-yang and wuxing and microcosm-macrocosm analogies\nbased on them. However, as in the case of science more generally,\nphilosophical textualists emerged as a distinct social group from the\nfang shi, especially. Nonetheless, we can trace\nphilosophical concerns in several areas of medical interest, especially\nthe ongoing history of “nurturing life” (yang\nsheng) practices, first described in philosophical texts but\nelaborated in great and practical detail by physicians and alchemists\nsuch as Ge Hong, Tao Hongjing and Sun Simiao. This linkage is\nmade explicit by one of the greatest of China’s twentieth-century\nphysicians and medical reformers, Zhang Xichun, who unequivocally\ndescribes philosophy as the basis of medicine.","contact.mail":"lisa.raphals@ucr.edu","contact.domain":"ucr.edu"}]
