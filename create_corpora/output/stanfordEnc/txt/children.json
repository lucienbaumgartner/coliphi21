A growing number of high schools\noffer some introduction to philosophy, often in special literature\ncourses for college bound students. In Europe and many other\ncountries, it is much more common to find philosophy in the high\nschool curriculum.  However, philosophy prior to high school seems\nrelatively uncommon around the world. This may suggest that serious\nphilosophical thinking is not for pre-adolescents. Two reasons might\nbe offered for accepting this view. First, philosophical thinking\nrequires a level of cognitive development that, one may believe, is\nbeyond the reach of pre-adolescents. Second, the school curriculum is\nalready crowded; and introducing a subject like philosophy will not\nonly distract students from what they need to learn, it may encourage\nthem to become skeptics rather than learners. However, both of these\nreasons can be challenged. They will be addressed in turn.\n\n\n\nJean Piaget’s (1933 ) well-known theory of cognitive development\nsuggests that prior to age 11 or 12, most children are not capable of\nphilosophical thinking. This is because, he holds, prior to this time,\nchildren are not capable of “thinking about thinking,” the\nsort of meta-level thinking that characterizes philosophical\nthinking. This “formal operational” level of cognitive\ndevelopment includes analogical reasoning about relationships, such\nas: “Bicycle is to handlebars as ship is to rudder, with\n‘steering mechanism’ being the similar relationship”\n(Goswami, p. xxi). However, there is a solid body of psychological\nresearch that indicates Piaget’s account seriously underestimates\nchildren’s cognitive abilities (Astington, 1993; Gopnik, et al., 1999;\nGopnik, 2009). \n\nPhilosopher Gareth Matthews goes further and argues at length that\nPiaget failed to see the philosophical thinking manifest in the very\nchildren he studied. Matthews (1980) provides a number of delightful\nexamples of very young children’s philosophical puzzlement. For\nexample: \n\nMatthews acquired many of his anecdotes from friends who knew of his\ninterest in the philosophical thinking of children. It is not uncommon\nfor attentive adults to encounter such examples. \n\nHowever, it might be objected that more than such anecdotes are needed\nto show that children are capable of serious philosophical\nthinking. What is needed is evidence that children are capable of\nsustained philosophical discussion. Matthews (1984) provides\nillustrations of this, too. Meeting with a group of 8–11 year olds, he\nused the following example to develop a story for discussion: \n\nThis generated a lively discussion in which children commented on the\ninconsiderateness of the three visiting children, the desirability of\nworking out a solution that would satisfy all four children, the\nimportance of respecting people’s rights, and how one might feel if he\nor she were in Ian’s place. Matthews then posed a possible utilitarian\napproach: “What about this argument, that if we let the three\nvisitors have their way, three people will be made happy instead of\njust one?” One reply was that it would not be fair for three\npeople to get what they want at the expense of a fourth. This\ntriggered a discussion of fairness that addressed more specific\nconcerns about the relative ages of the children, whether they are\nfriends, siblings, or strangers—and what types of television\nprograms are involved. \n\nNo doubt, part of the explanation of the children’s ability and\nwillingness to carry on an extended discussion of Ian’s circumstance\nis that they have faced similar challenges. Still, the children\nexhibited a rather sophisticated conceptual grasp of the issues at\nhand, which is what one might expect from children once they are\ninvited to reflect on their own experiences. \n\nStories about those roughly their own age can provide opportunities\nfor children to discuss ideas that are most important to\nthem. Consider this example from Matthew Lipman’s novel Lisa\n(1983). Harry and his friend Timmy go to a stamp club to trade\nstamps. Afterward they stop for ice cream cones, but Timmy discovers\nhe has no money. Harry offers to buy him one, and Timmy says he will\nbuy Harry a cone next time. As they are leaving the store, one of\ntheir classmates trips Timmy. Timmy then knocks the tripper’s books\noff the table. After running away from the scene, Timmy and Harry talk\nabout what has happened: “I couldn’t let them get away with it,” Timmy\nremarked when they saw that they weren’t being pursued and could slow\ndown to a walk. “He didn’t have to stick his foot out.”\nThen he added, “Of course, I didn’t have to do what I did either.\nBut, like I said before, turnabout is fair play.”  \n\n“Somehow,” Harry thought, “it isn’t quite the same\nthing.” But he couldn’t figure out why. “I don’t\nknow,” he said finally to Timmy. “The purpose of your\nstamp club is to exchange stamps. So when you give someone stamps,\nyou’re supposed to give something back. Just like if someone lends me\nmoney, I’m supposed to give it back. But if someone pulls a dirty\ntrick on you, should you do the same thing to him? I’m not so\nsure.” \n\n“But I had to get even,” Timmy protested. “I\ncouldn’t let him get away with it, tripping me like that for no\nreason.” \n\nA bit later they met Lisa and Laura. Harry told the girls what had\nhappened and why he was puzzled. “It reminds me,” remarked\nLisa, “of last year when we were learning about how some\nsentences could be turned around and would stay true, while others,\nwhen you turned them around, would become false.” \n\n“Yeah,” Harry agreed, “but there we found a rule.\nWhat’s the rule here?” Lisa tossed her long hair so that it hung\nover her right shoulder. “It looks like there are times when it\nis right to give back what we got and other times when it is\nwrong. But how do we tell which is which?” (Lisa,\npp. 23–4) \n\nThis passage is an invitation to explore the moral nuances of\nreciprocity, or “returning in kind.” What might a group of\n10–11 year-olds have to say about this? Here is a sampling from\na 30 minute discussion of the Lisa passage by a group of\nfifth graders (Pritchard 1996). Although the group had been discussing\nphilosophical ideas once a week after school for the past several\nmonths, they had not discussed this passage.  With little prompting\nfrom the teacher, the students raised and vigorously pursued the\nfollowing questions: \n\nThoughtful and insightful discussions like this are not unusual for\nchildren who are given the opportunity to have them. This discussion\nwas prompted by a children’s novel. However, students’ regular\nclassroom materials, works of art, thought experiments, or even the\ndaily news can be used to trigger philosophical discussions of\nmoral concerns. \n\nEven if one concedes that children are quite capable of engaging in\nextended discussions of moral concepts related to their own\nexperiences, what about philosophical ideas less immediately related to their\npractical affairs? Here is an illustration that begins with logic and\nends up in metaphysics. \n\nThe true sentence, “All oaks are trees” becomes false when\nreversed. So does, “All carrots are vegetables.” Can we\nsay that every true sentence beginning with ‘all’\nbecomes false when reversed? \n\nAt least as early as the 3rd grade, children easily find\nexceptions. What about “All tigers are tigers”, many will\nask. Others may respond that this is a “boring” sentence,\noffering something like “All rabbits are hares,” or\n“All mothers have children” as alternatives. With\nrelatively little encouragement, they can come up with good\ndefinitions of geometric figures and differentiate them from proposed\ndefinitions that cannot be reversed. For example, “All squares\nare rectangles” is true, but it becomes false when reversed.\n“All squares are rectangles with equal sides,” however,\ncan be reversed. \n\nAlthough the study of logic is traditionally regarded as a part of\nphilosophy, skeptics might not find the reflections of children on\nrules of logic terribly interesting philosophically. (Of course, some\nmight say this about elementary logic in the college classroom, as\nwell.) It is not that different from basic math and grammar, they\nmight object. Whether or not this is a fair assessment, for many\nchildren it is but a short step from logic to metaphysics. Here is an\nexample from a 4th grade class that had just been asked\nwhether true sentences beginning with ‘all’ always become\nfalse when reversed (Pritchard 1996). After the usual “All\ntigers are tigers” and “All rabbits are hares” were\nsuggested, a student asked, “How about ‘All answers have\nquestions’ and ‘All questions have answers’?”\nFortunately, the teacher paused to explore this with the class.\n“Do all answers have questions?” he asked. Of course,\nreplied the students, otherwise we would not say that we have an\nanswer. \n\nThe teacher continued, “How about the other sentence? Do you\nthink that all questions have answers?” What followed was a\nflood of responses: \n\nDuring the course of discussing these questions, the students seemed\nto be struggling to move from questions that are difficult, if not\nimpossible, to answer because of our practical limitations\n(e.g., not being certain that a particular grain of sand has not\nalready been counted) to questions that in principle are\nunanswerable. Finally, with a mischievous grin on his face, one of the\nstudents asked, “Will time end?” The problem, he\nexplained, is that if time did end, no one would be able later to\nconfirm that this was so. \n\nHere is another illustration of how quickly a discussion of logic can\nmove to a discussion of deep philosophical issues. (Pritchard, 1985)\nThis is a group of 5th graders considering the sentence,\n“All people are animals.” One of the students offered this\nas another example of a true sentence that becomes false when\nreversed. Jeff objected that “All people are animals” is\nnot true. Chip proceeded to develop a taxonomy that relegated people,\nalong with elephants and tigers, under the heading of mammals, mammals\nunder animals, and animals under living things. Jeff continued to\nobject. \n\nChip: “Jeff, what are people? Just tell me, what are people?\nYou can’t answer that, can you?” \n\nJeff: “Yes, I can.” \n\nChip: “What are you?” \n\nJeff: “A person.” \n\nChip: “What’s a person?” \n\nJeff: “A living somebody.” \n\nChip: “A living somebody could be a whale.” \n\nJeff: “I said, somebody, not an\nanimal….” \n\nChip: “You can check every single book out there in the\nlibrary—well, every one that’s about us….” \n\nLarry: “I want to know why everyone’s getting so huffy about a\nlittle subject.” \n\nRich: “We’re thinking! That’s what we’re here\nfor.” \n\nAmy: “Does anyone have an encyclopedia in here so we can look up\neither animals, mammals, or persons?” \n\nJeff: “We’re all humans. So, if this Mars guy saw us, he would\nsay, ‘Hey, look, there’s some human beings.’ He wouldn’t\nsay, ‘Hey, look, there’s some animals down\nthere.’” \n\nMike: “Martians, if there are any, would say, ‘Hey, look\nat those weird looking creatures,’ or something like that. They\nwouldn’t know what we are. They don’t know anything about us.\n[Returning now to Jeff’s original distinction, Mike continues.] If\nit’s a person, you say, ‘somebody.’ If it’s an\nanimal you say, ‘something.’ Somebody is a human\nbody.” \n\nChip: “There’s living life, okay? Then you branch off from\nthere. You have animals, plants, and whatever the other stuff\nis—you know, molecules and things like that. Now you go to the\nanimals and you branch off—mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and\nwhatever there is. Then you branch off and you have all these special\nhumans. Is that right so far, Jeff?” \n\nJeff: “Just go on.” \n\nChip: “Well, I just want to know if you agree so far.” \n\nJeff: “Just go on. Go on. I’m not going to change my mind.\nThat’s all…. I’m not an animal. I’m a person, and I’m going to\nstay that way.” \n\nChip: “You’re a type of animal.” \n\nJeff: “I’m not going to walk up to Dr. Jekyll and say,\n‘Hey, change me into an animal’….” \n\nAmy: “People are a type of animal, like a bird is. That’s\ndifferent than like an elephant is. A bird’s different than an\nelephant. And we’re different than a bird. Mike says we don’t call our\ndog a person or somebody. But someone might be real close to their pet\nand consider it part of the family.” \n\nThe discussion continued for several more minutes. As the group\ndispersed, one student remarked to another, “If we want to, we\ncould argue for hours!” “For days,” replied the\nsecond. Meeting weekly after school in the local public library, this\ngroup of children returned the next week with an encyclopedia to\nsettle the matter. After several minutes of discussion, the teacher\nasked the students if they thought everything in the encyclopedia is\ntrue. \n\nEmily: “Some things we’re not sure of; and the encyclopedia\ncould put down every word about how the solar system was formed, and\nit would probably say there was big dust that spun around like a\ntop. But we’re not sure about that. And, so, that could be\nwrong.” \n\nThe teacher asked whether, in such cases, the encyclopedia says,\n“We’re not sure.” \n\nMike: “It’ll say ‘hypothesis’—which is a\nguess.” \n\nKurt: “It’ll say we’re not sure yet.” \n\nSo, the discussion retained its philosophical vitality. This\nparticular group continued to meet for the entire school year,\ndiscussing a wide range of philosophical topics, including: the\nrelationship between the mind and the brain, differences (and\nsimilarities) between dreams and reality, knowledge of other minds,\nself-knowledge, and relationships between evidence and knowledge. \n\nGiven an already crowded curriculum and growing pressure to provide\nquantifiable evidence of student mastery of the standard subjects of\nhistory, literature, math, and science, teachers may question the\nsuitability of adding philosophy to the curriculum. Where is time to\nbe found for the give-and-take of philosophical discussions? Adding\nphilosophy to the mix, they might object, only makes matters\nworse. Not only is it yet another subject, it is one that is\nunfamiliar to most teachers, and they may fear that bringing in\nphilosophy, with its continual questioning, will actually interfere\nwith students’ mastery of the subjects already in the\ncurriculum. Given the unsettling nature of much philosophical inquiry,\nthey may feel vulnerable as teachers because they are not confident of\ntheir own answers to the questions posed. \n\nAdding to this problem is increasing pressure on teachers to\ndemonstrate that their students are performing at satisfactory levels\nin the standard subjects. Standardized tests are commonly used as the\nmeasure of student achievement. Marked by definitive, unambiguous\nquestions and answers, these tests do not place a premium on\nphilosophical reflection. Since student performance is typically\nlinked to school funding, this is not something teachers can take\nlightly, however skeptical they might be about the educational value\nof preparing their students to perform well on standardized tests. \n\nIn response, those who advocate bringing\nphilosophy into the schools emphasize ways in which philosophy can\nenhance the entire educational experience of students. The aim is more\nthan simply the introduction of one more subject in the schools. By\ninviting students to reflect on relationships among different areas of\ninquiry and to make sense of their educational experiences as a whole,\nphilosophy can add to the meaningfulness of students’ education as a\nwhole. In addition, philosophy can make important contributions to\nanother area of concern that cuts across the curriculum, critical\nthinking. \n\nIn the mid-1960s, philosopher Matthew Lipman became dismayed at the\nlow quality of argumentation employed by presumably well-educated\ncitizens discussing the Vietnam war and society’s ills in general.\nConvinced that the teaching of logic should begin long before college,\nhe tried to figure out a way to do this that would stimulate the\ninterest of 10–11 year olds. Leaving Columbia University for\nMontclair State College, he launched his efforts with his first\nchildren’s novel,\nHarry Stottlemeier’s Discovery (1974). Lipman’s concerns about\nthe level of critical thinking in society in general, and the schools\nin particular, were not his alone. By the 1970s the hue and cry for\nteaching critical thinking in the schools was, if not clear, at least\nloud; and it has continued largely unabated to the present. \n\nWhat is meant by ‘critical thinking’? Characterizations\nrange in complexity from Robert Ennis’s admirably brief,\n“reasonable reflective thinking that is focused on deciding what\nto believe or do” (Ennis 1987) to a complex statement by a group\nof 46 panelists convened by the American Philosophical Association’s\nCommittee on Pre-College Philosophy to employ the Delphi Method of\nstriving for consensus: \n\nLipman was a member of this panel, and it is clear that his novels and\nteacher’s manuals all strive to meet these objectives. His briefer\ndepiction of critical thinking is that it involves judgments based on\ncriteria, or reasons. Criteria, he says, can be appraised in terms of\n“megacriteria” such as reliability, relevance, strength,\ncoherence, and consistency (Lipman 1991, p. 119). Critical thinking,\nhe adds, is characterized as “thinking that (1) facilitates\njudgment because it (2) relies on criteria, (3) is self-correcting,\nand (4) is sensitive to context.” (Lipman 1991, p. 116) \n\nPicking up on the idea that critical thinking is sensitive to context, some\ncritics challenge the notion that critical thinking can be usefully\ntaught independently of specific disciplinary areas (McPeck,\n1985). While conceding that there are some generic features of\ncritical thinking that cut across disciplines, they maintain that even\nthese features acquire their meanings only in specific contexts that\nvary across disciplines (such as history, sociology, biology,\nchemistry).  However, unless the different disciplines ask questions\nabout their own basic assumptions and their relationships to one\nanother, critical thinking within those disciplines will overlook\nimportant questions that need attention. Philosophy does ask such\nquestions about other disciplines, as well as about itself. \n\nLipman’s hope was that philosophy would acquire a central place in the\nK-12 curriculum, thus enabling students to develop their critical\nthinking skills through philosophical questioning. At the same time,\nhe claimed, philosophy can help students make better sense of their\neducational experiences. By seeking to develop comprehensive\nperspectives, philosophy attempts to understand connections. A\ncurriculum that divides students’ education into discrete,\nself-contained disciplines without encouraging philosophical questions\nabout the nature of those disciplines and their relationships to one\nanother invites a fragmented view of education.  Lipman’s proposed\nalternative is described in the next section, which describes the K-12\nprogram developed by the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy\nfor Children (IAPC) he founded. \n\nShort of the ambitious program Lipman and his IAPC colleagues had in\nmind for the schools, there are more modest, but worthwhile, ways of\nbringing philosophical inquiry into the already existing disciplinary\nstructure in the schools. Teachers can invite their students to\nreflect on philosophical aspects of their subjects of study. At the\nsame time they study history, students can take some time to ask\nquestions about the extent to which historical accounts can be\nobjective—and questions about what ‘objectivity’\nmight mean, and why it is or is not important to seek it. Similar\nquestions can be asked about the natural and social sciences,\nincluding questions about the extent to which science is, or ought to\nbe, “value-free”. In fact, if room for such questions is\nnot encouraged, one might well ask to what extent critical thinking\nitself is encouraged. \n\nThe educational movement known as Philosophy for Children got its\nstart in the early 1970s with the publication of Matthew Lipman’s\nphilosophical novel for children, Harry Stottlemeier’s\nDiscovery. In 1970 Harry made its entry into the\nMontclair Public Schools in New Jersey. By the mid-70s the Institute\nfor the Advancement of Philosophy for Children (IAPC) was formally in\nplace at Montclair State College (now Montclair State University). The\nmedia quickly picked up on reports of significant improvements in the\nreading and critical thinking skills of middle school children who\nwere involved in IAPC programs. Subsequently, IAPC has produced\nmaterials consisting of Lipman’s children’s novels and, under the\nleadership of IAPC colleague Ann Margaret Sharp, accompanying teacher\nworkbooks for the entire K-12 curriculum. Thousands of children in New\nJersey, across the United States, and even around the world have been\nintroduced to IAPC educational programs. \n\nAn unassuming 96 page novel for middle-school children, Harry\nStottlemeier’s Discovery features Harry and his 5th\ngrade classmates. Adults occasionally enter in, but the primary\nphilosophical work is the children’s. Harry and his friends discover\nseveral basic concepts and rules of Aristotelean logic; and they\npuzzle over questions about the nature of thought, mind, causality,\nreality, knowledge and belief, right and wrong, and fairness and\nunfairness. The story does not introduce any of the special vocabulary\nof philosophy (not even the word ‘philosophy’ itself makes\nan appearance). Philosophical inquiry is initiated by the children in\nthe story rather than adults. \n\n“What is Harry Stottlemeier’s discovery?”\nHarry’s readers might ask. This question is not directly\nanswered. However, one candidate stands out among the many things that\nHarry discovers in the course of exploring questions about logic,\nknowledge, reality, and the mind. Harry and his classmates are asked\nto write a paper on the topic, “The Most Interesting Thing in\nthe World.” Entitled Thinking, Harry’s essay\nbegins: \n\nAfter writing several more paragraphs, Harry puts his paper aside.\nLater he thinks, “In school, we think about math, and we think\nabout spelling, and we think about grammar. But who every heard of\nthinking about thinking?” So, he adds one more sentence to his\npaper: “If we think about electricity, we can understand it\nbetter, but when we think about thinking, we seem to understand\nourselves better.” \n\nWithout using the word ‘philosophy,’ either here or\nanywhere else in Harry, Lipman shows Harry engaged in serious\nphilosophical thought, “thinking about thinking.” This, we\nmight say, reveals Harry’s discovery of the joys of philosophical\nthinking. But there is more. Harry also notices that, as interesting\nand important as thinking about thinking is, it seems to have no\nspecial place in school. Finally, although his paper begins in the\nfirst person, it quickly moves to ‘we’ and focuses on what\nmight be accomplished with others in the classroom. \n\nOne of the more attractive features of the IAPC approach to Philosophy\nfor Children for many teachers has been that it promotes the idea of the\nclassroom as a “community of inquiry” in which students\nopenly and respectfully exchange ideas. Each student is regarded as\nhaving the potential to make valuable contributions to the topics\nunder consideration. Students are encouraged to develop good listening\nskills, responsiveness to what others say, willingness to try to\nsupport one’s own ideas with good reasons, and openness to the\npossibility that one should modify one’s beliefs in light of new\nconsiderations. In short, the classroom is designed to reinforce the\nstudent’s potential for reasonableness. This involves more\nthan being able to engage in skillful reasoning. As Laurance J.\nSplitter and Ann Margaret Sharp put it (Splitter and Sharp, p. 6): \n\nTeachers who look favorably on the idea that the classroom should be a\n“community of inquiry” nevertheless may resist the idea\nthat philosophy should be the centerpiece for discussion.\nOther subjects, they might contend, lend themselves well to forming\nthe sort of collaborative learning environment that can fairly be\ncalled a “community of inquiry.” Philosophy for Children\nadvocates, however, need only insist that the sort of inquiry they are\nsupporting be philosophical.  Unfortunately, Ann Margaret Sharp passed\naway in 2011. The distinctiveness of the sort of inquiry she and\nLipman advocated is explored in some detail in a recent collection of\nessays by and about her that is dedicated to her memory (Gregory and\nLaverty, 2017). \n\nIt may be thought that philosophy is, at best, a suitable subject for\nrelatively few students at the pre-college level. Since philosophy\ntraditionally has been taught only at the college level in the United\nStates, it might be thought that it can be suitable for only a small\nsegment of students at pre-college levels—the two percent of\nstudents who are classified as “gifted and talented.”\nHowever, Philosophy for Children programs have shown themselves to be\nremarkably successful in drawing virtually all students in the\nclassroom together in inquiry. Teachers are often surprised, and\npleased, to see many of their most reticent,\n“underachieving” students actively join in the discussion\nof philosophical ideas. \n\nNevertheless, because they lack background in the formal study of\nphilosophy, many teachers are reluctant to encourage the philosophical\nthinking of their students. Their fears, however, are exaggerated.\nFamiliarity with some of the standard philosophical literature might\nbe desirable, but it is not necessary for bringing Philosophy for\nChildren into the classroom. What is required is the ability to\nfacilitate philosophical discussion. For this, it is much more\nimportant that teachers have some philosophical curiosity themselves\nthan a familiarity with academic philosophical literature. Like their\nstudents, teachers unfamiliar with the discipline of philosophy may\nnevertheless have an aptitude for philosophical thinking—or at\nleast a knack for recognizing when others are engaged in philosophical\nthought. \n\nFacilitating a Philosophy for Children discussion does not mean\ndominating it; it is important for teachers to allow their students to\ndevelop their own ideas. Teachers are not expected to provide, or even\nhave, answers to all the questions. They can share puzzlement with\ntheir students, be open to unexpected but suggestive responses to the\nquestions they and their students pose, and take pleasure in observing\nthe exchanges students have with each other. This means shedding the\ntraditional role of teacher as lecturer and answer-giver. Especially\nfor teachers who are uncertain about what this entails, workshops like\nthose offered by IAPC provide a good introduction to the pedagogy of\nPhilosophy for Children. \n\nPhilosophy for Children encourages children to think for\nthemselves at the same time that it encourages them to think\nwith others. However, philosophy is often viewed as more a\nmatter of solitary reflection, perhaps involving exchanges between a\nfew other solitary thinkers—something to which the\n“masses” are neither privy nor attracted. Perhaps many\nwould claim that this is philosophy at its best; like physics or\nmathematics, “philosophy for everyone” is watered down.\nThere is no need for Philosophy for Children to challenge this\nanalogy.  In fact, it can turn it in its favor. However esoteric\nphysics and mathematics at their best may be, the schools nevertheless\nrecognize the importance of making these subjects available to all\nstudents.  Similarly, Philosophy for Children advocates can counter\nthat there should be a place for the entire classroom—including\n“gifted and talented,” “underachieving,” and\n“ordinary” students—pursuing philosophical\nquestions together. \n\nFor this to work, it must be possible for children in the classroom to\nengage in sustained philosophical discussion with others. As already\nnoted, Gareth Matthew’s writings provide ample evidence that many\nchildren are capable of having interesting, if not profound,\nphilosophical thoughts. Less obvious, however, is children’s ability\nto sustain and develop this with others. Anecdotes of young children\nspontaneously sharing a philosophical thought with an observant adult\nare not sufficient. Matthews’ Dialogues With Children\nprovides good evidence that children can go well beyond this. Examples\nof substantial philosophical conversations of children found in Lone\n(2012), McCall (2009), Pritchard (1996), Shapiro (2012), and\nWartenberg (2009), among many others, should leave little doubt that\nchildren have this ability. \n\nIn light of the rapidly expanding international interest in philosophy\nfor children, the International Council for Philosophical Inquiry with\nChildren (ICPIC) was established in 1985. ICPIC continues to sponsor\nan international conference every other year, with hosts including\nAustralia, Austria, Brazil, England, Mexico, Spain (twice), and\nTaiwan. The most recent conference (June 2017) was held in Madrid,\nSpain.  Organized by Felix Garcia-Moriyon (Universidad Autonoma de\nMadrid), the conference was attended by more than 400 participants\nfrom around the world. \nEven after the passing of IAPC pioneers Matthew Lipman (2010) and Ann\nMargaret Sharp (2011), under the leadership of Maughn Gregory IAPC\nretains a strong presence in ICPIC. However, many ICPIC members now\nhave established their own institutional structures and have developed\ncenters, associations, and programs. In North America, there is the\nNorth American Association of Community of Inquiry (NAACI), which\ngathers every other year (years when ICPIC is not meeting). Recently, with initial\nsupport from the American Philosophical Association’s Pre-College\nPhilosophy Committee, PLATO (Philosophy Learning and Teaching\nOrganization) was formed.  Now a non-profit organization supported by\nthe Squire Family Foundation, it sponsors annual meetings and works\nclosely with the University of Washington Center for Philosophy for Children. PLATO also sponsors two periodicals: Questions and the online Precollege Philosophy and Public Practice.  Australia and New Zealand are organized under\nthe Federation of Australasian Philosophy in Schools Associations\n(FAPSA), which meets annually and publishes Journal for Philosophy\nin Schools as its official journal. (Burgh and Thornton, 2016). In\n1992 the Society for the Advancement of Philosophical Enquiry and\nReflection in Education (SAPERE) was established in Oxford,\nEngland. In 2007 England’s Philosophy Foundation was\nestablished. (Worley, 2011).  Since 2005, the journal Philosophy\nand Childhood has been sponsored by ICPIC and the graduate\nprogram in education at the State University of Rio De Janeiro (UERJ),\nwith Walter Kohan and David Kennedy serving as editors. These\norganizations, along with many other centers and experienced\npractitioners around the world, continue to support training programs\nfor teachers that enable them to introduce thousands of children to\nphilosophy, both inside and outside regular classrooms. \n\nAlthough there is continued use of IAPC materials, recent years have\nbeen marked by a proliferation of alternative teaching resources and\nways of engaging children in philosophical discussions.  For years\nGareth Matthews contributed reviews of children’s stories\nto Thinking, then IAPC’s official journal (even though IAPC’s\nown teaching materials made no use of other children’s\nliterature). This inspired Tom Wartenberg (2009, 2013) to develop his\nhighly successful pre-college philosophy program at Mt. Holyoke\nCollege (MA), a prize winning program that is built around classic\nchildren’s stories.  Karen Murris was an early objector to Lipman’s\nresistance to using illustrated materials. (Morris, 1992) She and\nJohana Haynes offer a detailed account of the philosophical importance\nof picture books. (Murris and Haynes, 2012 and Murris, 2016).\nEngland’s Peter Worley has written several stimulating books for\nteachers and students that make no use of IAPC materials.  Australia’s\nPhil Cam has assembled a variety of stories suitable for philosophical\nuse with children.  In short, there is a rapidly growing list of\nresources that show great promise for engaging children in\nphilosophical discussions.  (See, for example, DeHaan et al. 1995;\nFisher 1998; Keen 1997; Lewis and Chandley 2012; Lone 2012; McCall\n2009; Murris 1992, 2016; Sprod 2001, and White 2000). Questions:\nPhilosophy for Young People, a periodical sponsored by the\nAmerican Philosophical Association’s Pre-College Philosophy Committee,\nfeatures young people’s writings on special philosophical topics. The\nfirst issue (Spring 2001) focused on children’s rights. \n\nFortunately, the internet makes it possible to keep up reasonably well\nwith the latest developments around the world and communicate quickly\nwith other educators interested in Philosophy for\nChildren. Unfortunately, many of these websites seem to be\nshort-lived.  However, see the Internet Resources section below for a\nlist of websites that are reliable and which provide links to other\nuseful sites.","contact.mail":"pritchard@wmich.edu","contact.domain":"wmich.edu"}]
