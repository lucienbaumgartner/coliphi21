Its\nintellectual origins are in the mid-1950s when researchers in several\nfields began to develop theories of mind based on complex\nrepresentations and computational procedures. Its organizational\norigins are in the mid-1970s when the Cognitive Science Society was\nformed and the journal Cognitive Science began. Since then,\nmore than one hundred universities in North America, Europe, Asia, and\nAustralia have established cognitive science programs, and many others\nhave instituted courses in cognitive science.\n\n\n\nAttempts to understand the mind and its operation go back at least\nto the Ancient Greeks, when philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle\ntried to explain the nature of human knowledge. The study of mind\nremained the province of philosophy until the nineteenth century, when\nexperimental psychology developed. Wilhelm Wundt and his students\ninitiated laboratory methods for studying mental operations more\nsystematically. Within a few decades, however, experimental psychology\nbecame dominated by\n behaviorism,\n a view\nthat virtually denied the existence of mind. According to behaviorists\nsuch as J. B. Watson, psychology should restrict itself to examining\nthe relation between observable stimuli and observable behavioral\nresponses. Talk of consciousness and mental representations was\nbanished from respectable scientific discussion. Especially in North\nAmerica, behaviorism dominated the psychological scene through the\n1950s. \nAround 1956, the intellectual landscape began to change\ndramatically. George Miller summarized numerous studies which showed\nthat the capacity of human thinking is limited, with short-term memory,\nfor example, limited to around seven items. He proposed that memory\nlimitations can be overcome by recoding information into chunks, mental\nrepresentations that require mental procedures for encoding and\ndecoding the information. At this time, primitive computers had been\naround for only a few years, but pioneers such as John McCarthy, Marvin\nMinsky, Allen Newell, and Herbert Simon were founding the field of\n artificial intelligence.\n In addition, Noam Chomsky rejected behaviorist assumptions about\nlanguage as a learned habit and proposed instead to explain language\ncomprehension in terms of mental grammars consisting of rules. The six\nthinkers mentioned in this paragraph can be viewed as the founders of\ncognitive science.      Cognitive science has unifying theoretical ideas, but we have to\nappreciate the diversity of outlooks and methods that researchers in\ndifferent fields bring to the study of mind and intelligence. Although\ncognitive psychologists today often engage in theorizing and\ncomputational modeling, their primary method is experimentation with\nhuman participants. People, often undergraduates satisfying course\nrequirements, are brought into the laboratory so that different kinds\nof thinking can be studied under controlled conditions. For example,\npsychologists have experimentally examined the kinds of mistakes\npeople make in deductive reasoning, the ways that people form and\napply concepts, the speed of people thinking with mental images, and\nthe performance of people solving problems using analogies. Our\nconclusions about how the mind works must be based on more than\n“common sense” and introspection, since these can give a\nmisleading picture of mental operations, many of which are not\nconsciously accessible. Increasingly, psychologists draw their\nexperimental participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and from\nculturally diverse sources.  Psychological experiments that carefully\napproach mental operations from diverse directions are therefore\ncrucial for cognitive science to be scientific. Experimentation is also\na methodology employed by\n experimental philosophy.\n\n \n\nAlthough theory without experiment is empty, experiment without\ntheory is blind. To address the crucial questions about the nature of\nmind, the psychological experiments need to be interpretable within a\ntheoretical framework that postulates mental representations and\nprocedures. One of the best ways of developing theoretical frameworks\nis by forming and testing computational models intended to be analogous\nto mental operations. To complement psychological experiments on\ndeductive reasoning, concept formation, mental imagery, and analogical\nproblem solving, researchers have developed computational models that\nsimulate aspects of human performance. Designing, building, and\nexperimenting with computational models is the central method of\nartificial intelligence (AI), the branch of computer science concerned\nwith intelligent systems. Ideally in cognitive science, computational\nmodels and psychological experimentation go hand in hand, but much\nimportant work in AI has examined the power of different approaches to\nknowledge representation in relative isolation from experimental\npsychology.  While some linguists do psychological experiments or develop\ncomputational models, most currently use different methods. For\nlinguists in the Chomskian tradition, the main theoretical task is to\nidentify grammatical principles that provide the basic structure of\nhuman languages. Identification takes place by noticing subtle\ndifferences between grammatical and ungrammatical utterances. In\nEnglish, for example, the sentences “She hit the ball” and\n“What do you like?” are grammatical, but “She the\nhit ball” and “What does you like?” are not. A\ngrammar of English will explain why the former are acceptable but not\nthe latter. An alternative approach, cognitive linguistics, puts less\nemphasis on syntax and more on semantics and concepts. \n\nLike cognitive psychologists, neuroscientists often perform\ncontrolled experiments, but their observations are very different,\nsince neuroscientists are concerned directly with the nature of the\nbrain. With nonhuman subjects, researchers can insert electrodes and\nrecord the firing of individual neurons. With humans for whom this\ntechnique would be too invasive, it is now common\nto use magnetic and positron scanning devices to observe what is\nhappening in different parts of the brain while people are doing\nvarious mental tasks. For example, brain scans have identified the\nregions of the brain involved in mental imagery and word\ninterpretation. Additional evidence about brain functioning is gathered\nby observing the performance of people whose brains have been damaged\nin identifiable ways. A stroke, for example, in a part of the brain\ndedicated to language can produce deficits such as the inability to\nutter sentences. Like cognitive psychology, neuroscience is often\ntheoretical as well as experimental, and theory development is\nfrequently aided by developing computational models of the behavior of\ngroups of neurons. \n\nCognitive anthropology expands the examination of human thinking to\nconsider how thought works in different cultural settings. The study of\nmind should obviously not be restricted to how English speakers think\nbut should consider possible differences in modes of thinking across\ncultures. Cognitive science is becoming increasingly aware of the need\nto view the operations of mind in particular physical and social\nenvironments. For cultural anthropologists, the main method is\nethnography, which requires living and interacting with members of a\nculture to a sufficient extent that their social and cognitive systems\nbecome apparent. Cognitive anthropologists have investigated, for\nexample, the similarities and differences across cultures in words for\ncolors. \n\nTraditionally, philosophers do not perform systematic empirical\nobservations or construct computational models, although there has\nbeen a recent rise in work in experimental philosophy.  But philosophy\nremains important to cognitive science because it deals with\nfundamental issues that underlie the experimental and computational\napproach to mind. Abstract questions such as the nature of\nrepresentation and computation need not be addressed in the everyday\npractice of psychology or artificial intelligence, but they inevitably\narise when researchers think deeply about what they are doing.\nPhilosophy also deals with general questions such as the relation of\nmind and body and with methodological questions such as the nature of\nexplanations found in cognitive science. In addition, philosophy\nconcerns itself with normative questions about how people should think\nas well as with descriptive ones about how they do. Besides the\ntheoretical goal of understanding human thinking, cognitive science\ncan have the practical goal of improving it, which requires normative\nreflection on what we want thinking to be. Philosophy of mind does not\nhave a distinct method, but should share with the best theoretical\nwork in other fields a concern with empirical results. \n\nIn its weakest form, cognitive science is just the sum of the fields\nmentioned: psychology, artificial intelligence, linguistics,\nneuroscience, anthropology, and philosophy. Interdisciplinary work\nbecomes much more interesting when there is theoretical and\nexperimental convergence on conclusions about the nature of mind. For\nexample, psychology and artificial intelligence can be combined through\ncomputational models of how people behave in experiments. The best way\nto grasp the complexity of human thinking is to use multiple methods,\nespecially psychological and neurological experiments and computational\nmodels. Theoretically, the most fertile approach has been to understand\nthe mind in terms of representation and computation. \n\nThe central hypothesis of cognitive science is that thinking can\nbest be understood in terms of representational structures in the mind\nand computational procedures that operate on those structures. While\nthere is much disagreement about the nature of the representations and\ncomputations that constitute thinking, the central hypothesis is\ngeneral enough to encompass the current range of thinking in cognitive\nscience, including\n connectionist\ntheories which model thinking using artificial neural networks. \n\nMost work in cognitive science assumes that the mind has\n mental representations\n analogous\nto computer data structures, and computational procedures similar to\ncomputational algorithms. Cognitive theorists have proposed that the\nmind contains such mental representations as logical propositions,\nrules, concepts, images, and analogies, and that it uses mental\nprocedures such as deduction, search, matching, rotating, and\nretrieval. The dominant mind-computer analogy in cognitive science has\ntaken on a novel twist from the use of another analog, the brain. \n\nConnectionists have proposed novel ideas about representation and\ncomputation that use neurons and their connections as inspirations for\ndata structures, and neuron firing and spreading activation as\ninspirations for algorithms. Cognitive science then works with a\ncomplex 3-way analogy among the mind, the brain, and computers. Mind,\nbrain, and computation can each be used to suggest new ideas about the\nothers. There is no single computational model of mind, since different\nkinds of computers and programming approaches suggest different ways in\nwhich the mind might work. The computers that most of us work with\ntoday are serial processors, performing one instruction at a time, but\nthe brain and some recently developed computers are parallel\nprocessors, capable of doing many operations at once. \n\nA major trend in current cognitive science is the integration of\nneuroscience with many areas of psychology, including cognitive,\nsocial, developmental, and clinical.  This integration is partly\nexperimental, resulting from an explosion of new instruments for\nstudying the brain, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging,\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation, and optogenetics.  The integration\nis also theoretical, because of advances in understanding how large\npopulations of neurons can perform tasks usually explained with\ncognitive theories of rules and concepts. \n\nHere is a schematic summary of current theories about the nature of\nthe representations and computations that explain how the mind\nworks. \n\n Formal logic\n provides some\npowerful tools for looking at the nature of representation and\ncomputation. Propositional and predicate calculus serve to express many\ncomplex kinds of knowledge, and many inferences can be understood in\nterms of logical deduction with inferences rules such as modus ponens.\nThe explanation schema for the logical approach is: \n\nIt is not certain, however, that logic provides the core ideas about\nrepresentation and computation needed for cognitive science, since more\nefficient and psychologically natural methods of computation may be\nneeded to explain human thinking. \n\nMuch of human knowledge is naturally described in terms of rules of\nthe form IF … THEN …, and many kinds of thinking such as\nplanning can be modeled by rule-based systems. The explanation schema\nused is: \n\nComputational models based on rules have provided detailed\nsimulations of a wide range of psychological experiments, from\ncryptarithmetic problem solving to skill acquisition to language use.\nRule-based systems have also been of practical importance in suggesting\nhow to improve learning and how to develop intelligent machine\nsystems. \n\nConcepts, which partly correspond to the words in spoken and written\nlanguage, are an important kind of mental representation. There are\ncomputational and psychological reasons for abandoning the classical\nview that concepts have strict definitions. Instead, concepts can be\nviewed as sets of typical features. Concept application is then a\nmatter of getting an approximate match between concepts and the world.\nSchemas and scripts are more complex than concepts that correspond to\nwords, but they are similar in that they consist of bundles of features\nthat can be matched and applied to new situations. The explanatory\nschema used in concept-based systems is: \n\nAnalogies play an important role in human thinking, in areas as\ndiverse as problem solving, decision making, explanation, and\nlinguistic communication. Computational models simulate how people\nretrieve and map source analogs in order to apply them to target\nsituations. The explanation schema for analogies is: \n\nThe constraints of similarity, structure, and purpose overcome the\ndifficult problem of how previous experiences can be found and used to\nhelp with new problems. Not all thinking is analogical, and using\ninappropriate analogies can hinder thinking, but analogies can be very\neffective in applications such as education and design. \n\nVisual and other kinds of images play an important role in human\nthinking. Pictorial representations capture visual and spatial\ninformation in a much more usable form than lengthy verbal\ndescriptions. Computational procedures well suited to visual\nrepresentations include inspecting, finding, zooming, rotating, and\ntransforming. Such operations can be very useful for generating plans\nand explanations in domains to which pictorial representations apply.\nThe explanatory schema for visual representation is: \n\nImagery can aid learning, and some metaphorical aspects of language\nmay have their roots in imagery. Psychological experiments suggest\nthat visual procedures such as scanning and rotating employ imagery,\nand neurophysiological results confirm a close physical link between\nreasoning with mental imagery and perception.  Imagery is not just\nvisual, but can also operate with other sensory experiences such as\nhearing, touch, smell, taste, pain, balance, nausea, fullness, and\nemotion. \n\nConnectionist networks consisting of simple nodes and links are very\nuseful for understanding psychological processes that involve parallel\nconstraint satisfaction. Such processes include aspects of vision,\ndecision making, explanation selection, and meaning making in language\ncomprehension. Connectionist models can simulate learning by methods\nthat include Hebbian learning and backpropagation. The explanatory\nschema for the connectionist approach is: \n\nSimulations of various psychological experiments have shown the\npsychological relevance of the connectionist models, which are,\nhowever, only very rough approximations to actual neural networks. \n\n \n\nTheoretical neuroscience is the attempt to develop mathematical and\ncomputational theories and models of the structures and processes of\nthe brains of humans and other animals.  It differs from connectionism\nin trying to be more biologically accurate by modeling the behavior of\nlarge numbers of realistic neurons organized into functionally\nsignificant brain areas.  Computational models of the\nbrain have become biologically richer, both with respect to employing\nmore realistic neurons such as ones that spike and have chemical\npathways, and with respect to simulating the interactions among\ndifferent areas of the brain such as the hippocampus and the\ncortex. These models are not strictly an alternative to computational\naccounts in terms of logic, rules, concepts, analogies, images, and\nconnections, but should mesh with them and show how mental functioning\ncan be performed at the neural level. The explanatory schema for\ntheoretical neuroscience is:  From the perspective of theoretical neuroscience, mental\nrepresentations are patterns of neural activity, and inference is\ntransformation of such patterns.   \n\nBayesian models are prominent in cognitive science,\nwith applications to such psychological phenomena as learning, vision,\nmotor control, language, and social cognition.  They have also had\neffective applications in robotics.  The Bayesian approach assumes\nthat cognition is approximately optimal in accord with probability\ntheory, especially Bayes’ theorem, which says that the probability of\na hypothesis given evidence is equal to the result of multiplying the\nprior probability of the hypothesis by the conditional probability of\nthe evidence given the hypothesis, all divided by the probability of\nthe evidence.  The explanatory schema for Bayesian cognition is:  Although Bayesian methods have had impressive applications to a\nwide range of phenomena, their psychological plausibility is debatable\nbecause of assumptions about optimality and computations based on\nprobability theory.   \nArtificial intelligence has been a central part of cognitive since the\n1950s, and the most dramatic recent advances in AI have come from the\napproach of deep learning, which has produced major breakthroughs in\nfields that include game playing, object recognition, and\ntranslation. Deep learning builds on ideas from connectionism and\ntheoretical neuroscience, but uses neural networks with more layers\nand improved algorithms, benefitting from faster computers and large\ndata bases of examples. Another important innovation is combining\nlearning from examples with reinforcement learning, resulting by 2016\nin the world’s leading Go player, AlphaGo. Ideas from deep learning\nare spreading back into neuroscience and also beginning to influence\nresearch in cognitive psychology. The explanatory schema for deep\nlearning is: \nAlthough deep learning has produced dramatic improvements in some AI\nsystems, it is not clear how it can be applied to aspects of human\nthought that include imagery, emotion, and analogy.  \n\nSome philosophy, in particular naturalistic philosophy of mind, is\npart of cognitive science. But the interdisciplinary field of cognitive\nscience is relevant to philosophy in several ways. First, the\npsychological, computational, and other results of cognitive science\ninvestigations have important potential applications to traditional\nphilosophical problems in epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics.\nSecond, cognitive science can serve as an object of philosophical\ncritique, particularly concerning the central assumption that thinking\nis representational and computational. Third and more constructively,\ncognitive science can be taken as an object of investigation in the\nphilosophy of science, generating reflections on the methodology and\npresuppositions of the enterprise. \n\nMuch philosophical research today is naturalistic, treating\nphilosophical investigations as continuous with empirical work in\nfields such as psychology. From a naturalistic perspective, philosophy\nof mind is closely allied with theoretical and experimental work in\ncognitive science. Metaphysical conclusions about the nature of mind\nare to be reached, not by a priori speculation, but by informed\nreflection on scientific developments in fields such as psychology,\nneuroscience, and computer science. Similarly, epistemology is not a\nstand-alone conceptual exercise, but depends on and benefits from\nscientific findings concerning mental structures and learning\nprocedures. Ethics can benefit by using greater understanding of the\npsychology of moral thinking to bear on ethical questions such as the\nnature of deliberations concerning right and wrong. Here are some\nphilosophical problems to which ongoing developments in cognitive\nscience are highly relevant. Links are provided to other relevant\narticles in this Encyclopedia. \n\nAdditional philosophical problems arise from examining the\npresuppositions of current approaches to cognitive science. \n\nThe claim that human minds work by representation and computation is\nan empirical conjecture and might be wrong. Although the\n computational-representational\napproach to cognitive science has been successful in explaining many\naspects of human problem solving, learning, and language use, some\nphilosophical critics have claimed that this approach is fundamentally\nmistaken.  Critics of cognitive science have offered such challenges\nas: \n\nThe first five challenges are increasingly addressed by advances that\nexplain emotions, consciousness, action, and embodiment in terms of\nneural mechanisms.  The social challenge is being met by the\ndevelopment of computational models of interacting agents. The\nmathematics challenge is based on misunderstanding\nof Gödel’s theorem and on\nexaggeration of the relevance of quantum theory to neural\nprocesses.   \n\nCognitive science raises many interesting methodological questions\nthat are worthy of investigation by philosophers of science. What is\nthe nature of representation? What role do computational models play\nin the development of cognitive theories? What is the relation among\napparently competing accounts of mind involving symbolic processing,\nneural networks, and dynamical systems? What is the relation among the\nvarious fields of cognitive science such as psychology, linguistics,\nand neuroscience? Are psychological phenomena subject to reductionist\nexplanations via neuroscience? Are levels of explanation best\ncharacterized in terms of ontological levels (molecular, neural,\npsychological, social) or methodological ones (computational,\nalgorithmic, physical)? \n\nThe increasing prominence of neural explanations in cognitive, social,\ndevelopmental, and clinical psychology raises important philosophical\nquestions about explanation\nand reduction.  Anti-reductionism,\naccording to which psychological\nexplanations are completely independent of neurological ones, is\nbecoming increasingly implausible, but it remains controversial to\nwhat extent psychology can be reduced to neuroscience and molecular\nbiology.  Crucial\nto answering questions about the nature of reduction are answers to\nquestions about the nature of explanation.  Explanations in\npsychology, neuroscience, and biology in general are plausibly viewed\nas descriptions of\n mechanisms, \nwhich are combinations of connected parts that\ninteract to produce regular changes.\nIn psychological explanations, the parts are mental representations\nthat interact by computational procedures to produce new\nrepresentations.  In neuroscientific explanations, the parts are\nneural populations that interact by electrochemical processes to\nproduce new neural activity that leads to actions.  If progress in\ntheoretical neuroscience continues, it should become possible to tie\npsychological to neurological explanations by showing how mental\nrepresentations such as concepts are constituted by activities in\nneural populations, and how computational procedures such as spreading\nactivation among concepts are carried out by neural processes. \n\nThe increasing integration of cognitive psychology with neuroscience\nprovides evidence for the \nmind-brain identity theory according\nto which mental processes are neural,\nrepresentational, and computational.  Other philosophers dispute such\nidentification on the grounds that minds are embodied in biological\nsystems and extended into the world.  However, moderate claims about\nembodiment are consistent with the identity theory because brain\nrepresentations operate in several modalities (e.g. visual and motor)\nthat enable minds to deal with the world. Another materialist\nalternative to mind-brain identity comes from recognizing that\nexplanations of mind employ molecular and social mechanisms as well as\nneural and representational ones.
