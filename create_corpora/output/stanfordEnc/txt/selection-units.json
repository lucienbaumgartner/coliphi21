There is,\nhowever, considerable debate about which entity or entities are\nselected and what it is that fits them for that role. This article\naims to clarify what is at issue in these debates by identifying four\ndistinct, though often confused, concerns and then identifying how the\ndebates on what constitute the units of selection depend to a\nsignificant degree on which of these four questions a thinker regards\nas central.\n\nWhen we think of evolutionary theory and natural selection, we usually\nthink of organisms, say, a herd of deer, in which some deer are faster\nthan others at escaping their predators. These swifter deer will, all\nthings being equal, leave more offspring, and these offspring will\nhave a tendency to be swifter than other deer. Thus, we get a change\nin the average swiftness of deer over evolutionary time. In a case\nlike this, the unit of selection, sometimes called the\n“target” of selection, is the single organism, the\nindividual deer, and the property being selected, swiftness, also lies\nat the organismic level, in that it is exhibited by the intact and\nwhole deer, and not by either parts of deer, such as cells, or groups\nof deer, such as herds. But there are other levels of biological\norganization that have been proposed to be units or targets of\nselection—levels at which selection may act to increase a given\nproperty at that level, and at which units increase or decrease as a\nresult of selection at that specific level of biological\norganization. \nBut for over thirty years, some participants in the “units of\nselection” debates have argued that more than one issue is at\nstake. The notions of “replicator” and\n“vehicle” were introduced, to stand for different roles in\nthe evolutionary process (Dawkins 1978, 1982a,b). In this case, the\nindividual deer would be called the “vehicles” and their\ngenes that make them tend to be swifter would be called the\n“replicators.” The genic selection argument proceeded to\nassert that the units of selection debates should not be about\nvehicles, as they formerly had been, but about replicators. It was then\nasserted that the “replicator” actually subsumes two\ndistinct functional roles, which can be broken up into\n“replicator” and “interactor”:  \nDawkins…has replicators interacting with their environment in\ntwo ways—to produce copies of themselves and to influence their\nown survival and the survival of their copies. (Hull 1980: 318)  \nThe new view would call the individual deer the\n“interactors.” It was then argued that the force of this\ndistinction between replicator and interactor had been\nunderappreciated, and if the units of selection controversies were\nanalyzed further, that the question about interactors should more\naccurately be called the “levels of selection” debate to\ndistinguish it from the dispute about replicators, which should be\nallowed to keep the “units of selection debate” title\n(Brandon 1982; Mitchell 1987). \nThe purpose of this article is to delineate further the various\nquestions pursued under the rubric of “units and levels of\n selection.”[1]\n Four quite distinct questions will be isolated that have, in fact,\nbeen asked in the context of considering, what is a unit of selection?\nIn\n section 2,\n these distinct questions are described.\n Section 3\n returns to the sites of several very confusing, occasionally heated\ndebates about “the” unit of selection. Several leading\npositions on the issues are analyzed utilizing the taxonomy of\ndistinct questions. \nThis analysis is not meant to resolve any of the conflicts about which\nresearch questions are most worth pursuing; moreover, there is no\nattempt to decide which of the questions or combinations of questions\ndiscussed ought to be considered “the” units of selection\nquestion. \nFour basic questions can be delineated as distinct and separable. As\nwill be demonstrated in\n section 3,\n these questions are often used in combination to represent the units\nof selection problem. But let us begin by clarifying terms (see Lloyd\n1992, 2001). (See the entry on\n the biological notion of individual\n for more on this topic.) \nThe term replicator, originally introduced in the 1970s but\nsince modified by philosophers in the 1980s, is used to refer to any\nentity of which copies are made (Dawkins 1976, 1982a,b; Hull 1980; Brandon\n1982). Replicators were originally described using two orthogonal\ndistinctions. A “germ-line” replicator, as distinct from a\n“dead-end” replicator, is “the potential ancestor of\nan indefinitely long line of descendant replicators” (Dawkins\n1982a: 46). For instance, DNA in a chicken’s egg is a germ-line\nreplicator, whereas that in a chicken’s wing is a dead-end\nreplicator. Note that DNA are, but chickens are not, replicators,\nsince the latter do not replicate themselves as wholes. An\n“active” replicator is “a replicator that has some\ncausal influence on its own probability of being propagated,”\nwhereas a “passive” replicator is never transcribed and\nhas no phenotypic expression whatsoever (Dawkins 1982a: 47). There is\nspecial interest in active germ-line replicators,\n“since adaptations ‘for’ their preservation are\nexpected to fill the world and to characterize living organisms”\n(Dawkins 1982a: 47). \nThe original terminology of “replicator” was introduced\nalong with the term “vehicle”, which is defined as  \nany relatively discrete entity…which houses replicators, and\nwhich can be regarded as a machine programmed to preserve and\npropagate the replicators that ride inside it. (Dawkins 1982b: 295)\n \nOn this view, most replicators’ phenotypic effects are\nrepresented in vehicles, which are themselves the proximate targets of\nnatural selection (Dawkins 1982a: 62). \nIn the introduction of the term “interactor”, it was\nobserved that the previous theory has replicators interacting with\ntheir environments in two distinct ways: they produce copies of\nthemselves, and they influence their own survival and the survival of\ntheir copies through the production of secondary products that\nultimately have phenotypic expression (Hull 1980). The term\n“interactor” was suggested for the entities that function\nin this second process. An interactor denotes that entity which\ninteracts, as a cohesive whole, directly with its environment in such\na way that replication is differential—in other words, an entity\non which selection acts directly (Hull 1980: 318). The process of\nevolution by natural selection is  \na process in which the differential extinction and proliferation of\ninteractors cause the differential perpetuation of the replicators\nthat produced them. (Hull 1980: 318; see Brandon 1982: 317–318)\n \nOne challenge to the term, “interactor,” was that\n“interacting is not conspicuous during the process of\nelimination that results in natural selection” (Mayr 1997:\n2093). It’s difficult to imagine why anyone would say this,\ngiven the original description of the interactor as “an entity\nthat directly interacts … in such a way that replication is\ndifferential”. Perhaps more interestingly, the\n“target of selection” language is rejected because\nselection is seen as more of an elimination process; thus, it would be\nmisleading to call the “leftovers” of the elimination\nprocess the “targets” of selection. The term\n“selecton”, was proposed, which is defined as  \na discrete entity and a cohesive whole, an individual or a social\ngroup, the survival and successful reproduction of which is favored by\nselection owing to its possession of certain properties. (Mayr 1997:\n2093)  \nThis seems remarkably similar to an interactor, with the difference\nthat no differential reproduction, and thus no evolution, is\nmentioned. \nAt the birth of the “interactor” concept, the concept of\n“evolvers” was also introduced, which are the entities\nthat evolve as a result of selection on interactors: these are usually\ncalled lineages (Hull 1980). So far, no one has directly\nclaimed that evolvers are units of selection. They can be seen,\nhowever, to be playing a role in considering the question of who owns\nan adaptation and who benefits from evolution by selection, which we\nwill consider in sections\n 2.3\n and\n 2.4. \nIn its traditional guise, the interactor question is, what units are\nbeing actively selected in a process of natural selection? As such,\nthis question is involved in the oldest forms of the units of\nselection debates (Darwin 1859 [1964], Haldane 1932, Wright 1945). In\nan early review on “units of selection”, the purpose of\nthe article was claimed as: “to contrast the levels of\nselection, especially as regards their efficiency as causers of\nevolutionary change” (Lewontin 1970: 7). Similarly, others\nassumed that a unit of selection is something that “responds to\nselective forces as a unit—whether or not this corresponds to a\nspatially localized deme, family, or population” (Slobodkin\n& Rapoport 1974: 184). \nQuestions about interactors focus on the description of the selection\nprocess itself, that is, on the interaction between an entity, that\nentity’s traits and environment, and on how this interaction\nproduces evolution; they do not focus on the outcome of this process\n(see Wade 1977; Vrba & Gould 1986). The interaction between some\ninteractor at a certain level and its environment is assumed to be\nmediated by “traits” that affect the interactor’s\nexpected survival and reproductive success. Here, the interactor is\npossibly at any level of biological organization, including a group, a\nkin-group, an organism, a gamete, a chromosome, or a gene. Some\nportion of the expected fitness of the interactor is directly\ncorrelated with the value of the trait in question. The expected\nfitness of the interactor is commonly expressed in terms of genotypic\nfitness parameters, that is, in terms of the fitness of combinations\nof replicators. Hence, interactor success is most often reflected in\nand counted through, replicator success, either through simple\nsummation of the fitnesses of their traits, or some more complicated\nrelation. Several methods are available for expressing the correlation\nbetween interactor trait and (genotypic or genic) fitness, including\npartial regression, variances, and\n covariances.[2] \nIn fact, much of the interactor debate has been played out through the\nconstruction of mathematical genetic models—with the exception\nof work on group selection and on female-biased sex ratios (Wade 1980,\n1985, 2016; D.S. Wilson & Colwell 1981; see especially Griesemer\n& Wade 1988). The point of building such models is to determine\nwhat kinds of selection, operating at which levels, may be effective\nin producing evolutionary change. \nIt has been widely held, for instance, that the conditions under which\ngroup selection can effect evolutionary change are quite stringent and\nrare. Typically, group selection was seen to require small group size,\nlow migration rate, and extinction of entire\n demes.[3]\n Some modelers, however, disagree that these stringent conditions are\nnecessary, and show that in the evolution of altruism by group\nselection, very small groups may not be necessary (Matessi &\nJayakar 1976: 384; contra Maynard Smith 1964). Others also\nargue that small effective deme size is not a necessary prerequisite\nto the operation of group selection (Wade & McCauley 1980: 811).\nSimilarly, another shows that strong extinction pressure on demes is\nnot necessary (Boorman 1978: 1909). And finally, there was an early\ngroup selection model that violates all three of the\n“necessary” conditions usually cited (Uyenoyama 1979; see\nWade 2016). \nThat different researchers reach such disparate conclusions about the\nefficacy of group selection is partly because they are using different\nmodels with different parameter values. Several assumptions, routinely\nused in group selection models, were highlighted, that biased the\nresults of these models against the efficacy of group selection (Wade\n1978). For example, many group selection models use a specific\nmechanism of migration; it is assumed that the migrating individuals\nmix completely, forming a “migrant pool” from which\nmigrants are assigned to populations randomly. All populations are\nassumed to contribute migrants to a common pool from which colonists\nare drawn at random. Under this approach, which is used in all models\nof group selection prior to 1978, small sample size is needed to get a\nlarge genetic variance between populations (Wade 1978: 110; see\ndiscussion in Okasha 2003, 2006). \nIf, in contrast, migration occurs by means of large populations,\nhigher heritability of traits and a more representative sampling of\nthe parent population will result. Each propagate is made up of\nindividuals derived from a single population, and there is no mixing\nof colonists from the different populations during propagule\nformation. On the basis of further analysis, much more\nbetween-population genetic variance can be maintained with the\npropagule model (Slatkin and Wade 1978: 3531). Thus, by using\npropagule pools as the assumption about colonization, one can greatly\nexpand the set of parameter values for which group selection can be\neffective (Slatkin and Wade 1978, cf. Craig 1982). \nAnother aspect of this debate that has received a great deal of\nconsideration concerns the mathematical tools necessary for\nidentifying when a particular level of biological organization meets\nthe criteria for being an\n interactor.[4]\n Overall, while many of the suggested techniques have had strengths,\nno one approach to this aspect of the interactor question has been\ngenerally accepted and indeed it remains the subject of debate in\nbiological circles (Okasha 2004b,c). Detailed work on two of the major\ntechniques, the Price equation and contextual analysis, has indicated\nthat neither approach is universally applicable, on the grounds that\nneither provides a proper causal decomposition in all varieties of\nselection (Okasha 2006). Specifically, it appears that while\ncontextual analysis may be superior in most cases of multi-level\nselection, the Price equation may be more useful in certain cases of\ngenic selection (Okasha 2006). \nIt is important to note that, even in the midst of deciding among the\nvarious methods for representing selection processes, these choices\nhave consequences for the empirical adequacy of the selection models.\nThis is true even if the models are denied to have a causal\ninterpretation, as is done by those promoting a\n“statisticalist” interpretation of selection theory\n(Walsh, Lewens, & Ariew 2002). On this view, evolution is seen as\na purely statistical phenomenon, and population genetics studies\nstatistical relations estimated by census, and not causal\nrelationships. The claim is that the “deeply\nuninteresting” units of selection problem has been dissolved,\nwhereas in fact, it has simply been restricted to the interactor\nquestion (while ignoring the other three “units” questions\nentirely); the problem of how to deliver an empirically adequate\nselection model is not directly addressed (2002: 470–471).\nInstead, an unspecified method is assumed that “identifies\nclasses [that] … adequately predict and explain changes in the\nstructure of the population” (Walsh, Lewens, & Ariew 2002:\n471), with no acknowledgment that this involves making a commitment to\none or another of the above methods of determining an interactor,\nwhether under a causal interpretation or not. Thus, the interactor\nproblem has not been escaped, whether or not it is interpreted\ncausally (see Otsuka 2016). \nNote that the “interactor question” does not involve\nattributing adaptations or benefits to the interactors, or indeed, to\nany candidate unit of selection. Interaction at a particular level\ninvolves only the presence of a trait at that level with a special\nrelation to genic or genotypic expected success that is not reducible\nto interactions at a lower level. A claim about interaction indicates\nonly that there is an evolutionarily significant event occurring at\nthe level in question; it says nothing about the existence of\nadaptations at that level. As we shall see, the most common error made\nin interpreting many of the interactor-based approaches is that the\npresence of an interactor at a level is taken to imply that the\ninteractor is also a manifestor of an adaptation at that level. \nThe focus of discussions about replicators concerns just which organic\nentities actually meet the definition of replicator. Answering this\nquestion obviously turns on what one takes the definition of\nreplicator to be. In this connection the revision of the original\nmeaning of “replicator” turned out to be central. The\nrevised meaning refined and restricted the meaning of\n“replicator,” which was defined as “an entity that\npasses on its structure directly in replication” (Hull 1980:\n318). The terms replicator and interactor will be\nused in this latter sense in the rest of this entry. \nThe revised definition of replicator corresponds more closely than the\noriginal one to a long-standing debate in genetics about how large or\nsmall a fragment of a genome ought to count as a replicating\nunit—something that is copied, and which can be treated\nseparately in evolutionary theory (see especially Lewontin 1970; Hull\n1980). This debate revolves critically around the issue of linkage\ndisequilibrium and led some biologists to advocate the usage of\nparameters referring to the entire genome rather than to allele and\ngenotypic frequencies in genetical models (Lewontin\n 1974).[5]\n The basic point is that with much linkage disequilibrium, individual\ngenes cannot be considered as replicators because they do not behave\nas separate units during reproduction. Although this debate remains\npertinent to the choice of state space of genetical model, it has been\neclipsed by concerns about interactors in evolutionary genetics. \nThis is not to suggest that the replicator question has been solved.\nWork on the replicator question is part of a rich and continuing\nresearch program; it is simply no longer a large part of the units\ndebates. That this parting of ways took place is largely due to the\nfact that evolutionists working on the units problems tacitly adopted\nthe original suggestion that the replicator, whatever it turned out to\nbe, be called the “gene” (Dawkins 1982b, pp. 84-86; see\n section 3.3).\n This move neatly removes the replicator question from consideration.\nExactly why this move should have met with near universal acceptance\nis to some extent historical, however the fact that the intellectual\ntools (largely mathematical models) of the participants in the units\ndebates were better suited to dealing with aspects of that debate\nother than the replicator question which requires mainly bio-chemical\ninvestigation, surely contributed to this outcome. \nThere is a very important class of exceptions to this general\nabandonment of the replicator question. Developmental Systems Theory\nwas formulated as a radical alternative to the interactor/replicator\ndichotomy (Oyama 1985; Griffiths & Gray 1994, 1997; Oyama,\nGriffiths, & Gray 2001). Here the evolving unit is understood to\nbe the developing system as a whole, privileging neither the\nreplicator nor the interactor. \nThere has also been a profound reconception of the evolution by\nselection process, which has rejected the role of replicator as\nmisconceived. In its place the role of “reproducer” is\nproposed, which focuses on the material transference of genetic and\nother matter from generation to generation (Griesemer 2000a,b; see\nForsdyke 2010; see\n section 3.5).\n On this approach, thinking in terms of reproducers incorporates\ndevelopment into heredity and the evolutionary process. It also allows\nfor both epigenetic and genetic inheritance to be dealt with within\nthe same framework. The reproducer plays a central role, along with a\nhierarchy of interactors, in work on the units of evolutionary\ntransition (see\n Evolutionary Transition;\n Griesemer 2000c). This topic concerns the major transitions of life\nfrom one level of complexity to the next, for example, the transition\nfrom unicellularity to multicellularity. More recently, another notion\nwas introduced of a “reproducer” that is more broadly\ninclusive, in that it relaxes the material overlap requirement and\nfocuses on an understanding of “who came from whom, and roughly\nwhere one begins and another ends” (Godfrey-Smith 2009: 86). \nThese two definitions of “reproducer” disagree about\nretroviral reproduction, and what counts as a salient material bond\nbetween generations. On one side is the claim that there is no\nmaterial overlap in the case of retroviral reproduction, and that the\nkey is formal or informational relations (Godfrey-Smith 2009). On the\nother side, is a view that sees material overlap due to RNA strand\nhybridization guiding and channeling flows of information (Griesemer\n2014, 2016). There is also the introduction of a notion of reproducer\nthat involves only the copying of a property, with no substance\noverlapping involved (Nanay 2011). Like the second view of reproducer,\nit appeals to the case of retroviruses having no material overlap (cf.\nGriesemer 2014, 2016). \nWho benefits from a process of evolution by selection? There are two\npredominant interpretations of this question: Who benefits ultimately\nin the long term, from the evolution by selection process? And who\ngets the benefit of possessing adaptations as a result of a selection\nprocess? Take the first of these, the issue of the ultimate\nbeneficiary. \nThere are two obvious answers to this question—two different\nways of characterizing the long-term survivors and beneficiaries of\nthe evolution by selection process. One might say that the species or\nlineages (the previous “evolvers”) are the ultimate\nbeneficiaries of the evolutionary process. Alternatively, one might\nsay that the lineages characterized on the genic level, that is, the\nsurviving alleles, are the relevant long-term beneficiaries. I have\nnot located any authors holding the first view, but, for Richard\nDawkins, the latter interpretation is the primary fact about\nevolution. To arrive at this conclusion, he adds the requirement of\nagency to the notion of beneficiary (see Hampe & Morgan 1988). A\nbeneficiary, by definition, does not simply passively accrue credit in\nthe long term; it must function as the initiator of a causal pathway\n(Dawkins 1982a,b). Under this\ndefinition, the replicator is causally responsible for all of the\nvarious effects that arise further down the biochemical or phenotypic\npathway, irrespective of which entities might reap the long-term\nrewards (Sapienza 2010). \nA second and quite distinct version of the beneficiary question\ninvolves the notion of adaptation. The evolution by selection process\nmay be said to “benefit” a particular level of entity\nunder selection, through producing adaptations at that level (Williams\n1966, Maynard Smith 1976, Eldredge 1985, Vrba 1984). On this approach,\nthe level of entity actively selected (the interactor) benefits from\nevolution by selection at that level through its acquisition of\nadaptations. \nIt is crucial to distinguish the question concerning the level at\nwhich adaptations evolve from the question about the identity of the\nultimate beneficiaries of that selection process. One can think that\norganisms have adaptations without thinking that organisms are the\n“ultimate beneficiaries” of the selection\n process.[6]\n This sense of “beneficiary” that concerns adaptations\nwill be treated as a separate issue, discussed in the next\nsection. \nAt what level do adaptations occur? Or, “When a population\nevolves by natural selection, what, if anything, is the entity that\ndoes the adapting?” (Sober 1984: 204). \nAs mentioned previously, the presence of adaptations at a given level\nof entity is sometimes taken to be a requirement for something to be a\nunit of\n selection.[7]\n Significantly, group selection for “group advantage”\nshould be distinguished from group selection per se (Wright\n1980). In fact, the combination of the interactor question with the\nquestion of what entity had adaptations had created a great deal of\nconfusion in the units of selection debates in general. \nSome, if not most, of this confusion is a result of a very important\nbut neglected duality in the meaning of “adaptation” (in\nspite of useful discussions in Brandon 1978, Burian 1983, Krimbas\n1984, Sober 1984). Sometimes “adaptation” is taken to\nsignify any trait at all that is a direct result of a selection\nprocess at that level. In this view, any trait that arises directly\nfrom a selection process is claimed to be, by definition, an\nadaptation (e.g., Sober 1984; Brandon 1985, 1990; Arnold &\nFristrup 1982). Sometimes, on the other hand, the term\n“adaptation” is reserved for traits that are “good\nfor” their owners, that is, those that provide a “better\nfit” with the environment, and that intuitively satisfy some\nnotion of “good\n engineering.”[8]\n These two meanings of adaptation, the selection-product and\nengineering definitions respectively, are distinct, and in\nsome cases, incompatible. \nConsider the peppered moth case: natural selection is acting on the\ncolor of the moths over time, and the population evolves, but no\n“engineering” adaptation emerges. Rather, the proportion\nof dark moths simply increases over time, relative to the industrial\nenvironmental conditions, a clear case of evolution by natural\nselection, on which a good fit to the environment is reinforced. Note\nthat the dark moths lie within the range of variation of the ancestral\npopulation; they are simply more frequent now, due to their superior\nfit with the environment. The dark moths are a\n“selection-product” adaptation. Contrast the moth case to\nthe case of Darwin’s finches, in which different species evolved\ndistinct beak shapes specially adapted to their diet of particular\nseeds and foods (Grant & Grant 1989; Grant 1999). Natural\nselection here occurred against constantly changing genetic and\nphenotypic backgrounds in which accumulated selection processes had\nchanged the shapes of the beaks, thus producing\n“engineering” adaptations when natural selection occurred.\nThe finches now possess evolved traits that especially\n“fit” them to their environmental demands; their newly\nshaped beaks are new mechanisms beyond the original range of variation\nin the ancestral population (Lloyd 2015). \nSome evolutionary biologists have strongly advocated an engineering\ndefinition of adaptation (e.g., Williams 1966). The basic idea is that\nit is possible to have evolutionary change result from direct\nselection favoring a trait without having to consider that changed\ntrait as an adaptation. Consider, for example, Waddington’s\n(1956) genetic assimilation experiments. How should we interpret the\nresults of Waddington’s experiments in which latent genetic\nvariability was made to express itself phenotypically because of an\nenvironmental pressure (Williams 1966: 70–81; see the lucid\ndiscussion in Sober 1984: 199–201)? The question is whether the\nbithorax condition (resulting from direct artificial selection on that\ntrait) should be seen as an adaptive trait, and the engineering\nadaptationist’s answer is that it should not. Instead, the\nbithorax condition is seen as “a disruption…of\ndevelopment,” a failure of the organism to respond (Williams\n1966: 75–78). Hence, this analysis drives a wedge between the\nnotion of a trait that is a direct product of a selection process and\na trait that fits the stronger engineering definition of an adaptation\n(see Gould & Lewontin 1979; Sober 1984: 201; cf. Dobzhansky\n 1956).[9] \nIn sum, when asking whether a given level of entity possesses\nadaptations, it is necessary to state not only the level of selection\nin question but also which notion of adaptation—either\nselection-product or engineering—is being\nused. This distinction between the two meanings of adaptation also\nturns out to be pivotal in the debates about the efficacy of higher\nlevels of selection, as we will see in sections\n 3.1\n and\n 3.2. \nIn this section, four distinct questions have been described that\nappear under the rubric of “the units of selection”\nproblem, What is the interactor? What is the replicator? What is the\nbeneficiary? And what entity manifests any adaptations resulting from\nevolution by selection? There is a serious ambiguity in the meaning of\n“adaptation”; which meaning is in play has had deep\nconsequences for both the group selection debates and the species\nselection debates (Lloyd 2001). Commenting on this analysis, John\nMaynard Smith wrote in Evolution:  \n[Lloyd 2001] argues, correctly I believe, that much of the confusion\nhas arisen because the same terms have been used with different\nmeanings by different authors … [but] I fear that the\nconfusions she mentions will not easily be ended. (Maynard Smith 2001:\n1497)  \nIn\n section 3,\n this taxonomy of questions is used to sort out some of the most\ninfluential positions in five debates: group selection\n (3.1),\n species selection\n (3.2),\n genic selection\n (3.3),\n genic pluralism\n (3.4),\n as well as units of evolutionary transition\n (3.5). \nThe near-deathblow in the nineteen sixties to group panselectionism\nwas, oddly enough, about benefit (Williams 1966). The interest was in\ncases in which there was selection among groups and the groups as a\nwhole benefited from organism-level traits (including\nbehaviors) that seemed disadvantageous to the organism (Wynne Edwards\n1962; Williams 1966; Maynard Smith 1964). The argument was that the\npresence of a benefit to the group was not sufficient to establish the\npresence of group selection. This was demonstrated by showing that a\ngroup benefit was not necessarily a group adaptation (Williams 1966).\nHence, here the term “benefit” was being used to signify\nthe manifestation of an adaptation at the group level. The assumption\nwas that a genuine group selection process results in the evolution of\na group-level trait—a real adaptation—that serves a design\npurpose for the group. The mere existence however, of traits that\nbenefit the group is not enough to show that they are adaptations; in\norder to be an adaptation, under this view, the trait must be an\nengineering adaptation that evolved by natural selection. The\nargument was that group benefits do not, in general, exist\nbecause they benefit the group; that is, they do not have the\nappropriate causal history (Williams 1966; see Brandon 1981, 1985: 81;\nSober 1984: 262 ff.; Sober & Wilson 1998). \nImplicit in this discussion is the assumption that being a unit of\nselection at the group level requires two things: (1) having the group\nas an interactor, and (2) having a group-level engineering-type\nadaptation. That is, the approach taken combines two different\nquestions, the interactor question and the manifestor-of-adaptation\nquestion, and calls this combined set the unit of selection\nquestion. These requirements for “group selection” make\nperfect sense given that the prime target was a view of group\nselection that incorporated this same two-pronged definition of a unit\nof selection (see Borrello 2010 for a philosophically-oriented history\nof Wynne-Edwards and his views on group selection). \nThis combined requirement of engineering group-level adaptation in\naddition to the existence of an interactor at the group level is a\nvery popular version of the necessary conditions for being a unit of\nselection within the group selection debates. For example, it was\nclaimed that the group selection issue hinges on “whether\nentities more inclusive than organisms exhibit adaptations”\n(Hull 1980: 325). Another view states that the unit of selection is\ndetermined by “Who or what is best understood as the possessor\nand beneficiary of the trait” (Cassidy 1978: 582). Similarly,\npaleontological approaches required adaptations for an entity to count\nas a unit of selection (Eldredge 1985: 108; Vrba 1983, 1984). \nThe engineering notion of adaptation was also tied into the version of\nthe units of selection question in other contexts (Maynard Smith\n1976). In an argument separating group and kin selection, it was\nconcluded that group selection is favored by small group size, low\nmigration rates, and rapid extinction of groups infected with a\nselfish allele and that  \nthe ultimate test of the group selection hypothesis will be whether\npopulations having these characteristics tend to show\n“self-sacrificing” or “prudent” behavior more\ncommonly than those which do not. (Maynard Smith 1976: 282)  \nThis means that the presence of group selection or the effectiveness\nof group selection is to be measured by the existence of nonadaptive\nbehavior on the part of individual organisms along with the presence\nof a corresponding group-level adaptation. Therefore, this approach to\nkin and group selection does require a group-level adaptation from\ngroups to count as units of selection. As with the previous view, it\nis significant that the engineering notion of adaptation is\nassumed rather than the weaker selection-product notion;  \n[A]n explanation in terms of group advantage should always be\nexplicit, and always calls for some justification in terms of the\nfrequency of group extinction. (Maynard Smith 1976: 278; cf. Wade\n1978; Wright 1980) \nMore recently, geneticists have attempted to make precise the notion\nof a group adaptation though the “Formal Darwinism\nProject” (Grafen 2008), in which the general concept of\nadaptation can be applied to groups (Gardner & Grafen 2009).\nHowever, it is unclear how the notion of adaptation developed within\nthe formal Darwinism project relates to the previously discussed\nengineering notion of adaptation. Philosophers have offered a\ndifferent analysis of group adaptation, one based on an earlier\nanalysis of selection and adaptation (Okasha & Paternotte 2012;\nGrafen 2008). The key distinction, in the original view, is between a\ntrait that is a trait that merely benefits the group, i.e.,\n“fortuitous group benefit,” and one that is a genuine\ngroup adaptation, a feature evolved because it benefited the\ngroup, i.e., “for the right reason” (Okasha &\nPaternotte 2012: 1137). Contextual analysis, as well as the Price\nequation, can provide a formal definition of group adaptation, but\nboth need to be supplemented by causal reasoning (Okasha &\nPaternoster 2012). \nIn contrast to the preceding approach, we can separate the interactor\nand manifestor-of-adaptation questions in our group selection models\n(Wright 1980; see Lewontin 1978; Gould & Lewontin 1979). This is\ndone by distinguishing between what is called “intergroup\nselection,” that is, interdemic selection in the shifting\nbalance process, and “group selection for group advantage”\n(Wright 1980: 840; see Wright 1929, 1931). The term\n“altruist” originally denoted, in genetics, a phenotype\n“that contributes to group advantage at the expense of\ndisadvantage to itself” (1980: 840; Haldane 1932). This earlier\ndebate is connected to the main group selection debate in the 1960s,\nin which the group selectionists asserted the evolutionary importance\nof “group selection for group advantage” (Wright 1980).\nThe argument is that the primary kin selection model is “very\ndifferent” from “group selection for the uniform advantage\nof a group”(1980: 841; like Arnold & Fristrup 1982; Damuth\n& Heisler 1988; Heisler & Damuth 1987). There are excellent\nsummaries of the empirical and theoretical discoveries enabled by\n“intergroup” selection models (Goodnight & Stevens\n1997; Wade 2016). \nThose supporting a genic selection view in the 1970s were taken to\ntask for mistakenly thinking that because they have successfully\ncriticized group selection for group advantage, they can conclude that\n“natural selection is practically wholly genic”(Wright\n1980: 841).  \n[N]one of them discussed group selection for organismic advantage to\nindividuals, the dynamic factor in the shifting balance process,\nalthough this process, based on irreversible local peak-shifts is not\nfragile at all, in contrast with the fairly obvious fragility of group\nselection for group advantage, which they considered worthy of\nextensive discussion before rejection. (Wright 1980: 841) \nThis is a fair criticism of the genic selectionist view. The problem\nis that these authors failed to distinguish between two questions: the\ninteractor question and the manifestor-of-adaptation question. The\nform of group selection that involves interdemic group selection\nmodels involves groups only as interactors, not as manifestors of\ngroup-level adaptations. More recently, modelers following Sewall\nWright’s interest in structured populations have created a new\nset of genetical models that are also called “group\nselection” models and in which the questions of group\nadaptations and group benefit play little or no\n role.[10] \nFor a period spanning two decades, however, the genic selectionists\ndid not acknowledge that the position they attacked, namely group\nselection as engineering adaptation, is significantly different from\nother available approaches to group selection, such as those that\nprimarily treat groups as interactors. Ultimately, however, genic\nselectionists did recognize the significance of the distinction\nbetween the interactor question and the manifestor-of-adaptation\nquestion. In 1985, for example, we have progress towards mutual\nunderstanding:  \nIf some populations of species are doing better than others at\npersistence and reproduction, and if such differences are caused in\npart by genetic differences, this selection at the population level\nmust play a role in the evolution of the species.… [But]\nselection at any level above the family (group selection in a broad\nsense) is unimportant for the origin and maintenance of adaptation.\n(Williams 1985: 7–8) \nAnd in 1987, we have an extraordinary concession: \nThere has been some semantic confusion about the phrase “group\nselection,” for which I may be partly responsible. For me, the\ndebate about levels of selection was initiated by Wynne-Edwards’\nbook. He argued that there are group-level adaptations…which\ninform individuals of the size of the population so that they can\nadjust their breeding for the good of the population. He was clear\nthat such adaptations could evolve only if populations were\nunits of selection…. Perhaps unfortunately, he referred to the\nprocess as “group selection.” As a consequence, for me and\nfor many others who engaged in this debate, the phrase cane to imply\nthat groups were sufficiently isolated from one another reproductively\nto act as units of evolution, and not merely that selection acted on\ngroups. \nThe importance of this debate lay in the fact that group-adaptationist\nthinking was at that time widespread among biologists. It was\ntherefore important to establish that there is no reason to expect\ngroups to evolve traits ensuring their own survival unless they are\nsufficiently isolated for like to beget like…. When Wilson\n(1975) introduced his trait-group model, I was for a long time\nbewildered by his wish to treat it as a case of group selection and\ndoubly so by the fact that his original model…had interesting\nresults only when the members of the group were genetically related, a\nprocess I had been calling kin selection for ten years. I think that\nthese semantic difficulties are now largely over. (Maynard Smith 1987:\n123). \nEven the originator of the replicator/vehicle distinction also seems\nto have rediscovered the evolutionary efficacy of higher-level\nselection processes in an article on artificial life. In this article,\nthe primary concern is with modeling the course of selection\nprocesses, and a species-level selection interpretation is offered for\nan aggregate species-level trait (Dawkins 1989a). Still, Dawkins seems\nnot to have recognized the connection between this evolutionary\ndynamic and the controversies surrounding group selection because in\nhis second edition of The Selfish Gene (Dawkins 1989b) he had\nyet to accept the distinction made so clearly by group selectionists\nin 1980 (Wright 1980). This was in spite of the fact that by 1987, the\nimportance of distinguishing between evolution by selection processes\nand any engineering adaptations produced by these processes had been\nacknowledged by the workers he claimed to be following most closely\n(Williams 1985, 1992; Maynard Smith 1987). More recently, a related\ndebate has fired up between genic selection and group selection in the\njournals, about the definitions of group and kin selection (E.O.\nWilson 2008; see below). But this debate is bound for nowhere without\ntight enough definitions of these kinds of selection (Shavit &\nMillstein 2008). The adoption of Wade’s strict definitions would\nhelp, following the prescriptions of early group selectionists (Shavit\n& Millstein 2008). \nThere has been an even more recent challenge to the received\nunderstanding of kin selection, favoring a group selection\ninterpretation, which has been rebutted by those defending a strict\nseparation between kin and group selection (Nowak, Tarnita, &\nWilson 2010; Hölldobler & Wilson 2009; rebutted by Gardner,\nWest. & Wild 2011; Abbot et al. 2011). This view, has in turn,\nbeen rebutted by others (van Veelen et al. 2012; Allen, Nowak, &\nWilson 2013; E.O. Wilson & Nowak 2014). Philosophers have offered\na very useful analysis of these debates about kin and group selection\n(Birch & Okasha 2015). The basic prediction of kin selection\ntheory is that social behavior, especially social behavior that\nbenefits others, should correlate with genetic relatedness. This is\ncommonly expressed through Hamilton’s\nrule, rb > c, where\nr is relatedness, b is the benefit that behavior\noffers the conspecific, and c is the cost to the actor (see\nHamilton 1975 for an expansion to multilevel selection). The critics\nclaiming that kin selection is a form of group selection, assert that\nHamilton’s rule “almost never holds” (Nowak et al. 2010:\n1059).\nThat is, it almost never states the true conditions under which a\nsocial behavior will evolve by selection. Their opponents claim the\nopposite: that it is incorrect to claim that Hamilton’s rule\nrequires restrictive assumptions, or that it almost never holds. On\nthe contrary, they claim, it holds a great deal of the time (Gardner,\nWest, & Wild 2011). \nOn a philosophical analysis, there are really three distinct versions\nof Hamilton’s rule, and thus three distinct versions of kin\nselection theory under discussion. One involves many substantial\nassumptions, including  \nweak selection, additive gene action, (i.e., no dominance or\nepistasis), and the additivity of fitness payoffs (i.e., a relatively\nsimple payoff structure). (Birch & Okasha 2015: 23)  \nWhen these assumptions are weakened, we get more variants of\nHamilton’s rule. Particularly important are the payoff\nparameters c and b. Sometimes these denote the\nvalues of a particular model, called HRS (Hamilton’s Rule,\nspecial), but other times, they denote averaging effects or partial\nregression coefficients, in the case of HRG (Hamilton’s Rule,\ngeneral). A third approach, HRA (Hamilton’s Rule, approximate),\nwhich uses first-order approximates of regression coefficients, is the\napproach most commonly used in contemporary kin selection theory. The\nspecial version is very restrictive, while the general version allows\na wide variety of cases. According to the philosophical analysis of\nthe cases, Nowak et al. are using the special version of\nHamilton’s rule when they say it “almost never\nholds,” whereas Gardner, West, and Wild are using the\nregression-based, general version of the rule, which allows a great\ndeal of leeway in application. In other words, they are talking past\neach other (Birch & Okasha 2015). Significantly,  \nNeither [Nowak et al. nor Gardner, West, & Wild ] is referring to\nHRA, even though this approximate version of the rule is the version\nmost commonly used by kin selection theorists. (Birch & Okasha\n2015: 24) \nOn the same philosophical analysis, it is also argued that kin\nselection and multilevel selection represented using the Price\nequation are formally equivalent, and that preferences for kin\nselection models may not be justified as they are usually (Birch &\nOkasha 2015; cf. West et al. 2008). Some\nbiologists, for example, have argued that kin selection is more easily\napplicable than group selection, and that kin selection can be applied\nwhenever there is group selection (West, Griffin, & Gardner 2007,\n2008). Moreover, they deny that kin selection is a form of group\nselection, despite formal similarities and derivations (West, Griffin,\n& Gardner 2007: 424). Problems about using multilevel selection\nmodels may stem from the group beneficiary problem arising from the\nearly group selection context wherein group selection was assumed to\ninvolve both group benefit and group engineering adaptation (Birch\n& Okasha 2015).  \n[A]lthough kin and multilevel selection are equivalent as statistical\ndecompositions of evolutionary change, there are situations in which\none approach provides a more accurate representation of the causal\nstructure of social interaction. (Birch & Okasha 2015: 30; see\nalso Okasha & Paternotte 2012 vs. Gardner & Grafen 2009 on\ngroup adaptations)  \nGeneticists have offered an effective critique of the “Formal\nDarwinism Project” to units of selection and adaptation, arguing\nthat the latter’s preferences for the level of individual\norganism is arbitrary, as is their bias against multilevel selection\n(Shelton & Michod 2014a). \nIn an analysis of the contextual analysis and Price equation methods\nof representing hierarchical selection models, it was argued that\ncontextual analysis is superior overall, except in cases of meiotic\ndrive (Okasha 2006). However, it was recently argued that contextual\nanalysis can even handle cases of meiotic drive, thus making it the\nsuperior approach to multilevel selection (Earnshaw 2015). In a\nseparate and helpful analysis, the relationship between kin and\nmultilevel models was spelled out using causal graphs (Okasha 2015).\nJust because the two models can produce the same changes in gene\nfrequencies, it does not follow that they represent the same causal\nstructure, which is illustrated using causal graph theory and examples\nfrom biology, such as group adaptation and meiotic drive (Okasha 2015;\nsee\n Genic Selection: The Pluralists).\n This goes very much against the claims of equivalence of the two\nmodel types, kin and group selection (West, Griffin, & Gardner\n2007, 2008; West & Gardner 2013), in which these technical\nequivalences are taken to signify total equivalence of the\nevolutionary systems (see also Frank 2013; Queller 1992; Dugatkin\n& Reeve 1994; Sober & Wilson 1998). Take, for instance, the\nclaim: “There is no theoretical or empirical example of group\nselection that cannot be explained with kin selection” (West,\nGriffin, & Gardner 2008: 375), \nIt is good to keep in mind that there are dissenters from this claim\nof the equivalence between group and kin selection models (e.g.,\nLloyd, Lewontin, & Feldman 2008; van Veelen 2009; van Veelen et\nal. 2012; Hölldobler & Wilson 2009; Traulsen 2010; Nowak,\nTarnita, & Wilson 2010, 2011; E.O. Wilson 2012). Those who claim\nfull equivalence discuss the evolution of cooperation and altruism,\narguing that only kin selection allows an easy solution to these\nevolutionary problems (West, Griffin, & Gardner 2008). From the\nmore robust group selectionist point of view, the so-called free rider\nproblems with kin and group selection—such as those that are\ncontemplated by evolutionists puzzling over the evolution of\naltruism—are pseudo-problems based on misconceptions (Wade 2016;\nsee also Bowles & Gintis 2011; Planer 2015; Sterelny 2012). \nOne approach notes that kin selection (either in its inclusive fitness\nform or the direct fitness approach) and multilevel selection\n“differ primarily in the types of questions being\naddressed” (Goodnight 2013: 1546). Whereas kin selection aims at identifying\ncharacter states that maximize fitness, multilevel selection methods\nhave the goal of looking at the effects of selection on trait changes.\nWhile the two have formal similarities, the kin selection models arose\nout of game theory and evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) and are\nused to identify the optimal solution, but they cannot be used to\nexamine the process by which the population will achieve that\noptimum or equilibrium. In contrast, the multilevel selection methods,\nsuch as contextual analysis, which arise out of the quantitative\ngenetics traditions, are used to describe the processes acting on the\npopulation in its current\n state.[11]\n Thus, the two methods are not the same, nor are they competing\nparadigms.  \nRather they should be considered complementary approaches that when\nused together give a clearer picture of social evolution than either\none can when used in isolation. (Goodnight 2013: 1547; cf. Maynard Smith\n1976; Dawkins 1982b; West, Griffin, & Garnder 2007, 2008; Gardner\n& Grafen 2009) \nIn the laboratory, the hierarchical genetic approach of multilevel\nselection has been used to demonstrate that populations respond\nrapidly to experimentally imposed group selection, and that indirect\ngenetic effects are primarily responsible for the surprising strength\nand effectiveness of group selection experiments, contra the\nfull equivalence claims (Goodnight 2013; Goodnight & Stevens 1997; cf. West, Griffin,\n& Gardner 2007, 2008). Field studies using contextual analysis\nhave shown that multilevel selection is far more common in nature than\npreviously expected (Goodnight 2013; e.g., Stevens, Goodnight, & Kalisz 1995;Tsuji 1995; Aspi et al. 2003; Weinig et al. 2007; Eldakar et al. 2010;\nWade 2016). There is much less emphasis on the evolution of altruism\nwithin the hierarchical genetic approach, as selection is observed as\nit is occurring, and this includes group selection going in the same\ndirection as organismic selection, not just in opposition to it,\ncontra early genic selectionist recommendations (Maynard\nSmith 1976). This sort of group selection of interactors is not based\non group level engineering adaptations, although some still persist in\nconfusing group selection itself with the combination of the two\nfeatures, group selection and group engineering adaptation (e.g.,\nRamsey & Brandon 2011). \nMost recently, a new topic has arisen in the context of multilevel\nselection, involving the evolution of “holobionts,” i.e.,\nthe combination of a eukaryotic organism with its microbiotic load\n(Zilber-Rosenberg & Rosenberg 2008). It has become clear that each\n“individual” human being is actually a community of\norganisms co-evolved for mutual benefit (Gilbert, Sapp, & Tauber\n2012). Our microbiota (the collection of bacteria, viruses, and fungi\nliving in our gut, mouth, and skin) is necessary for our survival and\ndevelopment, and our species is also needed in turn for their\nsurvival. Bacterial symbionts help induce and sustain the human immune\nsystem, T-cells, and B-cells (Lee & Mazamanian 2010; Round,\nO’Connell, & Mazamanian 2010), as well as providing\nessential vitamins to the host human being. Gut bacteria are necessary\nfor cognitive development (Sampson & Mazamanian 2015), as well as\nfor the development of blood vessels in the gut; lipid metabolism,\ndetoxification of dangerous bacteria, viruses, and fungi; and the\nregulation of colonic pH and intestinal permeability (Nicholson et al.\n2012). \nThe holobiont—the combination of the host and its\nmicrobiota—functions as a unique biological entity anatomically,\nmetabolically, immunologically, and developmentally (Gilbert,\nRosenberg, & Zilber-Rosenberg forthcoming; Gilbert 2011). Similarly, a\nholobiont is seen as an “integrated community of species,\n[which] becomes a unit of natural selection” (Gilbert, Sapp,\n& Tauber 2012: 334). That is, in essence, theorists claim that the\nholobiont can function as an interactor since it has features that\nbind it together as a functional whole in such a way that it can\ninteract in a natural selection process. So what ties the different\nspecies together to produce an interactor? According to pioneering\nphilosophical thought on holobionts and symbionts, it is the\ncommunity’s common evolutionary fate, its being a\n“functioning whole,” that characterizes it as an\nevolutionary interactor, “objects between which natural\nselection selects” (Dupré 2012: 160; see also\nDupré & O’Malley 2013; Zilber-Rosenberg &\nRosenberg 2008). This community can also be described as a\n“team” of consortia undergoing selection (Gilbert et al.\nforthcoming). Others describe\nthem as “collaborators” or “polygenomic\nconsortia”, which has the advantage of encompassing both\ncompetition and cooperation within the holobiont (Dupré &\nO’Malley 2013: 314; Lloyd forthcoming; see also Huttegger & Smead 2011 on stag\nhunt game-theoretic results regarding the range of collaboration). \nHolobionts can also be reproducers, where the host usually reproduces\nvertically and the microbiota reproduce either vertically,\nhorizontally, or both. This situation has provoked discussion among\nphilosophers (Godfrey-Smith 2009, 2011; Sterelny 2011; Griesemer 2014,\n2016; Booth 2014; Lloyd\nforthcoming). Holobionts’ microbiota can reproduce\noutside the context of the original host organism, so some holobionts,\ne.g., the Hawaiian bobtail squid and its luminescent bacteria, are not\n“Darwinian populations” (Godfrey-Smith 2009, 2011), and\ntherefore not units of selection (see Booth 2014). This approach\ncontrasts with that of the original reproducer approach which would\ninclude the squid-bacteria system and also retroviruses excluded under\nthe “Darwinian populations” account (Griesemer2000a,\n2016).  \nAs in [my book, Darwinian Populations and Natural Selection],\nI hold that it is a mistake to see things that do not reproduce as\nunits of selection. (Godfrey-Smith 2011: 509; Booth 2014)  \nThis exclusion rests on the merging of the interactor with the\nreproducer requirements, and as such will not hold sway over those who\ndo not buy such a confounding of roles (e.g., Dupré &\nO’Malley 2013). This is yet another case wherein distinguishing\nthe interactor question from the replicator/reproducer question can be\n“more illuminating” (Sterelny 2011: 496; see Dupré\n& O’Malley 2013; Gilbert, Sapp, & Tauber 2012; Lloyd forthcoming). \nFinally, holobionts can also be manifestors of adaptations, as in the\ncase of the evolution of placental mammals in the acquisition by\nhorizontal gene transfer from a retrovirus of a crucial gene coding\nfor the protein syncytin (Lloyd forthcoming; Dupressoir, Lavialle, & Heidemann\n2012). Syncytin allows fetuses to fuse to their mother’s\nplacenta, a role crucial to the evolution of placental mammals.\nMoreover, it seems that several retrovirally derived enhancers played\ncritical roles in the formation of a key cell in the uterine wall,\nalso crucial for maintaining pregnancy, enhancing the\nholobiont’s role as a manifestor of adaptation (Wagner et al.\n2014). \nThere are several other significant entries into the group selection\ndiscussions, including the book, Unto Others: The Evolution and\nPsychology of Unselfish Behavior (Sober & Wilson 1998). Here,\na case for group selection is developed based on the need to account\nfor the existence of biological altruism. Biological altruism is any\nbehaviour that benefits another organism at some cost to the actor.\nSuch behavior must always reduce the actor’s fitness but it may\n(following the work on interdemic selection), increase the fitness of\ncertain groups within a structured population. There was a big benefit\nto bringing the attention of the larger philosophical community to\ngroup selection models, and explaining them in an accessible fashion.\nIt has thus brought this aspect of the units of selection controversy\nout onto the main stage of philosophical thought. \nThe “Darwinian populations” view previously mentioned\nprovides a considerably different view of the necessary conditions for\ngroup selection, one which rejects many of the currently accepted\ncases of the phenomenon. For a given selection story to be\ndescriptively valid, a “Darwinian population” must exist\nat the level of selection being described, which requires the presence\nof both an interactor and a reproducer at that level, thus putting\ntogether what others have pulled apart (Godfrey-Smith 2009: 112). A\nDarwinian population is conceived as, at minimum,  \na collection of causally connected individual things in which there is\nvariation in character, which leads to differences in reproductive\noutput (differences in how much or how quickly individuals reproduce),\nand which is inherited to some extent. (2009: 39)  \nThere are further differentiations between paradigmatic, minimal, and\nmarginal Darwinian populations based on a variety of criteria, such as\nthe fidelity of heritability, continuity (the degree to which small\nshifts in phenotype correlate to small changes in fitness), and the\ndependence of reproductive differences on intrinsic features of\nindividuals (Godfrey-Smith 2009: Chapter 3). \nFor example, under this view, the case of the evolution of altruism,\nwhich is commonly attributed to group selection, should not be\nconsidered as such, because of the lack of a true reproducer at the\ngroup level; the group level description depicts at best a marginal\nDarwinian population (Godfrey-Smith 2009: 119). Rather, the argument\nis that a neighborhood selection model, in which individuals are\naffected by the phenotypes of their neighbors but cannot be seen as\n“collectives competing at a higher level,” is fully\ncapable of capturing the selective process involved, and represents a\nDarwinian population, in which the individuals are seen both as the\ninteractors and the reproducers (2009: 118). This would seem to entail\nthat many group selection accounts (e.g., Sober & Wilson 1998), as\nwell as any models classified as Multi-level selection 1 (MLS1) models\n(Heisler & Damuth 1987), cannot be properly considered as such.\nThis view grants that there are empirical examples in which a\ngroup-level reproducer clearly exists (for example, Wade &\nGriesemer 1998; Griesemer & Wade 2000; there is otherwise no\ndiscussion of Wrightian approaches to group selection). The approach\nusing Darwinian populations and reproducers is claimed to present an\nadvantage over other available analyses of units of selection because\nit can account for previously neglected examples such as epigenetic\ninheritance systems (Godfrey-Smith 2009). The question remains as to\nwhether gaining an account to deal with these is worth rejecting an\nentire class of accepted group selection models, and whether such a\nloss is truly necessary to deal with epigenesis, given that we have an\nepigenetic account with reproducers that allows for group selection\n(see Griesemer 2000c). \nAmbiguities about the definition of a unit of selection have also\nsnarled the debate about selection processes at the species level. One\nresponse to the notion of species selection comes with a classic\nconfusion: “It is individual selection discriminating against\nthe individuals of the losing species that causes the\nextinction” (Mayr 1997: 2093). The individual death of species\nmembers is confused with extinction: “the actual selection takes\nplace at the level of competing individuals of the two species”\n(Mayr 1997: 2093). Once we overcome such difficulties, and succeed in\nconceiving of species as unified interactors, we are still faced with\ntwo questions. The combining of the interactor question and the\nmanifestor-of-adaptation question (in the engineering sense) led to\nthe rejection of research aimed at considering the role of species as\ninteractors, simpliciter, in evolution. Once it is understood\nthat species-level interactors may or may not possess design-type\nadaptations, it becomes possible to distinguish two research\nquestions: Do species function as interactors, playing an active and\nsignificant role in evolution by selection? And does the evolution of\nspecies-level interactors produce species-level engineering\nadaptations and, if so, how often? \nFor the early history of the species selection debate, these questions\nwere lumped together; asking whether species could be units of\nselection meant asking whether they fulfilled both the\ninteractor and manifestor-of-adaptation roles. For example, early\nspecies selection advocates used a genic selectionist treatment of the\nevolution of altruism as a touchstone in the definition of species\nselection (e.g., Vrba 1984). The relevant argument is that kin\nselection could cause the spread of altruistic genes but that it\nshould not be called group selection (Maynard Smith 1976). Again, this\nwas because the groups were not considered to possess design-type\nadaptations themselves. Some species selectionists agreed that the\nspread of altruism should not be considered a case of group selection\nbecause “there is no group adaptation involved; altruism is not\nemergent at the group level” (Vrba 1984: 319; Maynard Smith\ngives different reasons for his rejection). This amounts to assuming\nthat there must be group benefit in the sense of a design-type\ngroup-level adaptation in order to say that group selection can occur.\nThis species selection view was that evolution by selection is not\nhappening at a given level unless there is a benefit or engineering\nadaptation at that level. The early species selection position\nexplicitly equates units of selection with the existence of an\ninteractor plus adaptation at that level (Vrba 1983: 388);\nfurthermore, it seems that the stronger, engineering definition of\nadaptation had been adopted. \nIt was generally accepted among early species selectionists that\nspecies selection does not happen unless there are species-level\nadaptations (Eldredge 1985: 196, 134). Certain cases are rejected as\nhigher-level selection processes overall because  \nfrequencies of the properties of lower-level individuals which are\npart of a high-level individual simply do not make convincing\nhigher-level adaptations. (Eldredge 1985: 133) \nMost of those defending species selection early on defined a unit of\nselection as requiring an emergent, adaptive property (Vrba 1983,\n1984; Vrba and Eldredge 1984; Vrba and Gould 1986). This amounts to\nasking a combination of the interactor and manifestor-of-adaptation\nquestions. But the relevant question is not “whether some\nparticle-level causal processes or other bear the causal\nresponsibility,” but rather “whether particle-level\nselection bears the causal responsibility” (Okasha\n2006: 107). An emergent character requirement conflates these two\nquestions. Such a character may be the result of a selection process\nat the group/species level, but it should not be treated as a\npre-condition of such a process. \nBut consider the lineage-wide trait of variability. Treating species\nas interactors has a long tradition (Dobzhansky 1956, Thoday 1953,\nLewontin 1958). If species are conceived as interactors (and not\nnecessarily manifestors of adaptations), then the notion of species\nselection is not vulnerable to the original anti group-selection\nobjections from the early genic selectionists (Williams\n 1966).[12]\n The old idea was that lineages with certain properties of being able\nto respond to environmental stresses would be selected for, and thus\nthat the trait of variability itself would be selected for and would\nspread in the population of populations. In other words, lineages were\ntreated as interactors. The earlier researchers spoke loosely of\nadaptations where adaptations were treated in the weak sense as\nequivalent simply to the outcome of selection processes (at any\nlevel). They were explicitly not concerned with the effect of\nspecies selection on organismic level traits but with the effect on\nspecies-level characters such as speciation rates, lineage-level\nsurvival, and extinction rates of species. Some argued, including the\npresent author, that this sort of case represents a perfectly good\nform of species selection, using so-called “emergent\nfitnesses,” even though some balk at the thought that\nvariability would then be considered, under a weak definition, a\nspecies-level adaptation (Lloyd & Gould 1993; Lloyd 1988 [1994]).\nPaleontologists used this approach to species selection in their\nresearch on fossil gastropods (Jablonski 2008, 1987; Jablonski & Hunt 2006), and the approach has also been used in\nthe leading text on speciation (Coyne & Orr 2004). \nEarly species selectionists also eventually recognized the advantages\nof keeping the interactor question separate from a requirement for an\nengineering-type adaptation, dropping the former requirement that, in\norder for species to be units of selection, they must possess\nspecies-level adaptations (Vrba 1989). Ultimately, the current\nwidely-accepted definition of species selection is in conformity with\na simple interactor interpretation of a unit of selection (Vrba 1989;\nsee Damuth & Heisler 1988; Lloyd 1988 [1994]; Jablonski 2008). \nIt is easy to see how the two-pronged definition of a unit of\nselection—as interactor and manifestor of adaptation—held\nsway for so long in the species selection debates. After all, it had\ndominated much of the group selection debates for so long. Some of the\nconfusion and conflict over higher-level units of selection arose\nbecause of an historical contingency—the early group\nselectionist’s implicit definition of a unit of selection and\nthe responses it provoked (Wynne Edwards 1962; Borrello 2010). \nOne may understandably think that the early genic selectionists were\ninterested in the replicator question because of the claims that the\nunit of selection ought to be the replicator. This would be a mistake.\nRather, the primary interest is in a specific ontological issue about\nbenefit (Dawkins 1976, 1982a,b). This amounts to asking a special version of the beneficiary\nquestion, and the answer to that question dictates the answers to the\nother three questions flying under the rubric of the “units of\nselection”. \nBriefly, the argument is that because replicators are the only\nentities that “survive” the evolutionary process, they\nmust be the beneficiaries (Dawkins 1982a,b). What happens in the\nprocess of evolution by natural selection happens for their\nsake, for their benefit. Hence, interactors interact for the\nreplicators’ benefit, and adaptations belong to the replicators.\nReplicators are the only entities with real agency as initiators of\ncausal chains that lead to the phenotypes; hence, they accrue the\ncredit and are the real units of selection. \nThis version of the units of selection question amounts to a\ncombination of the beneficiary question plus the\nmanifestor-of-adaptation question. There is little evidence that they\nare answering the predominant interactor question; rather, the\nargument is that people who focus on interactors are laboring under a\nmisunderstanding of evolutionary theory (Dawkins 1976, 1982a,b). One reason for\nthinking this might be that the opponents are taken to be those who\nhold a combination of the interactor plus manifestor-of-adaptations\ndefinition of a unit of selection (e.g., Wynne-Edwards).\nUnfortunately, leading genic selectionists ignore those who are\npursuing the interactor question alone; these researchers are not\nvulnerable to the criticisms posed against the combined\ninteractor-adaptation view (Dawkins 1982a,b; Williams 1966). Some\ninsist that the early genic selectionists have misunderstood\nevolutionary selection, an argument that is based upon interpreting\nthe units of selection controversy as a debate about interactors\n(Gould 1977; Istvan 2013); however, because the early genic\nselectionists say that the debate concerns the units of the\nultimate beneficiary, they are arguing past one another (Istvan 2013).\n Section 3.4, Genic Selection: The Pluralists,\n addresses those who interpret themselves as arguing against the\ninteractor question itself. \nIn the next few paragraphs, two aspects of Dawkins’ specific\nversion of the units of selection problem shall be characterized. I\nwill attempt to clarify the key issues of interest to Dawkins and to\nrelate these to the issues of interest to others. \nThere are two mistakes that Dawkins is not making. First, he\ndoes not deny that interactors are involved in the evolutionary\nprocess. He emphasizes that it is not necessary, under his view, to\nbelieve that replicators are directly “visible” to\nselection forces (1982b: 176). Dawkins has recognized from the\nbeginning that his question is completely distinct from the interactor\nquestion. He remarks, in fact, that the debate about group versus\norganismic selection is “a factual dispute about the level at\nwhich selection is most effective in nature,” whereas his own\npoint is “about what we ought to mean when we talk about a unit\nof selection” (1982a: 46). He also states that genes or other\nreplicators do not “literally face the cutting edge of natural\nselection. It is their phenotypic effects that are the proximal\nsubjects of selection” (1982a: 47). We shall return to this\nissue in\n section 3.4, Genic Selection: The Pluralists. \nSecond, Dawkins does not specify how large a chunk of the genome he\nwill allow as a replicator; there is no commitment to the notion that\nsingle exons are the only possible replicators. He argues that if\nLewontin, Franklin, Slatkin and others are right, his view will not be\naffected (see\n Replicators).\n If linkage disequilibrium is very strong, then the “effective\nreplicator will be a very large chunk of DNA” (Dawkins 1982b:\n89; Sapienza 2010). We can conclude from this that Dawkins is not\ninterested in the replicator question at all; his claim here is that\nhis framework can accommodate any of its possible answers. \nOn what basis, then, does Dawkins reject the question about\ninteractors? I think the answer lies in the particular question in\nwhich he is most interested, namely, What is “the nature of the\nentity for whose benefit adaptations may be said to\n exist?”[13] \nOn the face of it, it is certainly conceivable that one might identify\nthe beneficiary of the adaptations as—in some cases,\nanyway—the individual organism or group that exhibits the\nphenotypic trait taken to be the adaptation. In fact, some writers\nseem to have done just that in the discussion of group selection (see\nWilliams\n 1966).[14]\n But the original genic selectionist rejects this move, introducing an\nadditional qualification to be fulfilled by a unit of\nselection; it must be “the unit that actually survives or fails\nto survive” (Dawkins 1982a: 60). Because organisms, groups, and\neven genomes do not actually survive the evolution-by-selection\nprocess, the answer to the survival question must be the replicator.\n(Strictly speaking, this is false; it is copies of the replicators\nthat survive. Replicators must therefore be taken in some sense as\ninformation and not as biological entities (see Hampe & Morgan\n1988; cf. Griesemer 2005). \nBut there is still a problem. Although the conclusion is that\n“there should be no controversy over replicators versus\nvehicles. Replicator survival and vehicle selection are two aspects of\nthe same process” (1982a: 60), the genic selectionist does not\njust leave the vehicle selection debate alone. Instead, the argument\nis that we do not need the concept of discrete vehicles at all. This\nis what we shall investigate in\n section 3.4 Genic Selection: The Pluralists. \nThe important point for now is that, on Dawkins’ analysis, the\nfact that replicators are the only survivors of the\nevolution-by-selection process automatically answers also the question\nof who owns the adaptations. Adaptations must be seen as being\ndesigned for the good of the active-germ-line replicator for the\nsimple reason that replicators are the only entities around long\nenough to enjoy them over the course of natural selection. The genic\nselectionist acknowledges that the phenotype is “the all\nimportant instrument of replicator preservation,” and that\ngenes’ phenotypic effects are organized into organisms (that\nthereby might benefit from them in their lifetimes) (1982b: 114). But\nbecause only the active germ-line replicators survive, they are the\ntrue locus of adaptations (1982b: 113; emphasis added). The\nother things that benefit over the short term (e.g., organisms with\nadaptive traits) are merely the tools of the real survivors, the real\nowners. Hence, Dawkins rejects the vehicle approach partly because he\nidentifies it with the manifestor-of-adaptation approach, which he has\nanswered by definition, in terms of the long-term beneficiary. \nThe second key aspect of genic selectionists’ views on\ninteractors is the desire to do away with them entirely. Dawkins is\naware that the vehicle concept is “fundamental to the\npredominant orthodox approach to natural selection” (1982b:\n116). Nevertheless, he rejects this approach in The Extended\nPhenotype, claiming, “the main purpose of this book is to\ndraw attention to the weaknesses of the whole vehicle concept”\n(1982b: 115). But this “vehicle” approach is not\nequivalent to “the interactor question”; it encompasses a\nmuch more restricted approach. \nIn particular, when arguing against “the vehicle concept,”\nDawkins is only arguing against the desirability of seeing the\nindividual organism as the one and only possible vehicle. His target\nis explicitly those who hold what he calls the “Central\nTheorem,” which says that individual organisms should be\nseen as maximizing their own inclusive fitness (1982b: 5, 55).\nThese arguments are indeed damaging to the Central theorem, but they\nare ineffective against other approaches that define units of\nselection as interactors. \nOne way to interpret the Central Theorem is that it implies that the\nindividual organism is always the beneficiary of any selection\nprocess. The genic selectionists seem to mean by\n“beneficiary” both the manifestor of adaptation and that\nwhich survives to reap the rewards of the evolutionary process.\nDawkins argues, rightly and persuasively, I think, that it does not\nmake sense always to consider the individual organism to be the\nbeneficiary of a selection process. \nBut it is crucial to see that Dawkins is not arguing against the\nimportance of the interactor question in general, but rather against a\nparticular definition of a unit of selection. The view being\ncriticized assumes that the individual organism is the interactor,\nand the beneficiary, and the manifestor of\nadaptation. Consider the main argument against the utility of\nconsidering vehicles: the primary reason to abandon thinking about\nvehicles is that it confuses people (1982b: 189). But look at the\nexamples; their point is that it is inappropriate always to ask how an\norganism’s behavior benefits that organism’s inclusive\nfitness. We should ask instead, “whose inclusive fitness the\nbehavior is benefiting” (1982b: 80). Dawkins states that his\npurpose in the book is to show that “theoretical dangers attend\nthe assumption that adaptations are for the good of…the\nindividual organism” (1982b: 91). \nSo, Dawkins is quite clear about what he means by the “vehicle\nselection approach”; it always assumes that the organism is the\nbeneficiary of its accrued inclusive fitness. Dawkins advances\npowerful arguments against the assumption that the organism is always\nthe interactor cum beneficiary cum manifestor of adaptations. This\napproach is clearly not equivalent to the approach to units of\nselection characterized as the interactor approach. Unfortunately,\ngenic selectionists extend Dawkins’ conclusions to these other\napproaches, which he has, in fact, not addressed. The genic\nselectionists’ lack of consideration of the interactor\ndefinition of a unit of selection leads to two grave problems with\nthis view. \nOne problem is the tendency to interpret all group selectionist claims\nas being about beneficiaries and manifestors of adaptations as well as\ninteractors. This is a serious misreading of authors who are pursuing\nthe interactor question alone. \nConsider, for example, this argument that groups should not be\nconsidered units of selection: \nTo the extent that active germ-line replicators benefit from the\nsurvival of the group of individuals in which they sit, over and above\nthe [effects of individual traits and altruism], we may expect to see\nadaptations for the preservation of the group. But all these\nadaptations will exist, fundamentally, through differential replicator\nsurvival. The basic beneficiary of any adaptation is the active\ngerm-line replicator (Dawkins 1982b: 85). \nNotice that this argument begins by admitting that groups can function\nas interactors, and even that group selection may effectively produce\ngroup-level adaptations. The argument that groups should not be\nconsidered real units of selection amounts to the claim that the\ngroups are not the ultimate beneficiaries. To counteract the intuition\nthat the groups do, of course, benefit, in some sense, from the\nadaptations, the terms “fundamentally” and\n“basic” are used, thus signaling what the author considers\nthe most important level. Even if a group-level trait is affecting a\nchange in gene frequencies, “it is still genes that are regarded\nas the replicators which actually survive (or fail to survive) as a\nconsequence of the (vehicle) selection process” (Dawkins 1982b:\n115). Thus, the replicator is the unit of selection because it is the\nbeneficiary, and the real owner, of all adaptations that exist. \nSaying all this does not, however, address the fact that other\nresearchers investigating group selection are asking the interactor\nquestion and sometimes also the manifestor-of-adaptation question,\nrather than Dawkins’ special version of the (ultimate)\nbeneficiary question. He gives no additional reason to reject these\nother questions as legitimate; he simply reasserts the superiority of\nhis own preferred unit of selection. In sum, Dawkins has identified\nthree criteria as necessary for something to be a unit of selection:\nit must be a replicator; it must be the most basic beneficiary of the\nselection process; and it is automatically the ultimate manifestor of\nadaptation through being the beneficiary. \nFinally, further work in the philosophy of biology brings the level of\nthe unit of selection down even further than the original genic\nselectionists do (Rosenberg 2006). Higher level selection is reducible\nto more fundamental\n levels.[15]\n Taking a reductionist stance, which is taken to be necessary to avoid\nan “untenable dualism” in biology between physicalism and\nantireductionism, the argument is that the principle of natural\nselection (PNS) should be properly viewed as a basic law of physical\nscience (specifically chemistry), which can operate at the level of\natoms and molecules (Rosenberg 2006: 189–191). Different\nmolecular environments would favor different chemical types, and those\nthat “more closely approximate an environmentally optimal\ncombination of stability and replication,” are thus the\n“fittest” and would predominate (2006: 190). This could\nthen be applied at each step of the way from simple molecules to\ncompounds, organelles, cells, tissues, and so on, such that  \nthe result at each level of chemical aggregation is the instantiation\nof another PNS, grounded in, or at least in principle derivable from,\nthe molecular interactions that follow the PNS in the environment\noperating at one or more lower levels of aggregation. (Rosenberg 2006:\n192) \nThis approach addresses antireductionist arguments regarding group\nlevel properties. The claim is that this new envisioning of the PNS as\na purely physical law allows us to better understand the lower level\norigins of apparently higher level causes, thus revealing that\n“the appearance of ‘downward causation’ is just\nthat: mere appearance.” (Rosenberg 2006: 197) For example, the\nclaim is that group level selection explanations, such as are commonly\ngiven for altruism, do not require an antireductionist stance, since\nphysical laws, such as that second law of thermodynamics, can allow\nfor local unfavorable changes (in this case, local decreases in\nentropy) as long as compensation is made elsewhere. With regard to the\nphysical PNS,  \ngroups of biological individuals may experience fitness increases at\nthe expense of fitness decreases among their individual members for\nperiods of time that will depend on the size and composition of the\ngroup and the fitness effects of their traits. What the PNS will not\npermit is long-term fitness changes at the level of groups without\nlong-term fitness changes in the same direction among some or all of\nthe individuals composing them. (Rosenberg 2006: 198)  \nIn other words, this is supposed to show that there is no need to\nthink in terms of irreducible group level interactors. Again, note\nthat this analysis merges characteristics of interactors and\nreplicators. \nIn the next section, we will consider some relatively more recent work\nin which genic selectionism is defended through a pluralist approach\nto modeling. What matters in the final analysis, though, is exactly\nwhat matters to the original genic selectionists, and that is the\nsearch for the ultimate beneficiary of the evolution by selection\nprocess. \nAs we saw in the previous section, the original genic selectionists\nhad particular problems with their treatment of the interactor. While\nthey admitted that the “vehicle” was necessary for the\nselection process, they did not want to accord it any weight in the\nunits of selection debate because it was not the beneficiary, but\nrather an agent of the beneficiary. Soon, however, there emerged a new\nangle available to genic selectionists (Waters\n 1986).[16] \nThe new “genic pluralism” appears to let one bypass the\ninteractor question, by, in effect, turning genes into interactors\n(Sterelny & Kitcher 1988). The proposal is that there are two\n“images” of natural selection, one in which selection\naccounts are given in terms of a hierarchy of entities and their\ntraits’ environments, the other of which is given in terms of\ngenes having properties that affect their abilities to leave\ncopies of themselves (Sterelny & Kitcher 1988; see Kitcher,\nSterelny, & Waters 1990, Sterelny 1996a,b; Waters 1986,\n 1991).[17]\n Something significant follows from the fact that hierarchical models\nor selection processes can be reformulated in terms of the genic\nlevel. These claims have been resisted on a variety of grounds (see\nobjections in R.A. Wilson 2003, Stanford 2001, Van der Steen & van\nden Berg 1999, Gannett 1999, Shanahan 1997, Glennan 2002, Sober 1990,\nSober & Wilson 1998, Brandon & Nijhout 2006, Sarkar 2008). \nThe big payoff of the genic point of view is:  \nOnce the possibility of many, equally adequate, representations of\nevolutionary processes has been recognized, philosophers and\nbiologists can turn their attention to more serious projects than that\nof quibbling about the real unit of selection. (Kitcher, Sterelny,\n& Waters 1990: 161) \nBy “quibbling about the real unit of selection,” here, the\nauthors seem to be referring to the large range of articles in which\nevolutionists have tried to give concrete evidence and requirements\nfor something to serve as an interactor in a selection process. \nAs an aside, it is important to note that none of the philosophers are\nadvocating genic selectionism to the exclusion of other views. What\ninterests them is a proposed equivalence between being able to tell\nthe selection story one way, in terms of interactors and replicators,\nand to tell the same story another way, purely in terms of\n“genic agency”. Thus, they are pluralists, in that they\nare not ultimately arguing in favor of the genic view; they are,\nhowever, expanding the genic selectionist view beyond its previous\nlimits. \nThe pluralists attack the view that “for any selection process,\nthere is a uniquely correct identification of the operative selective\nforces and the level at which each impinges” (Waters 1991: 553).\nRather, they claim, “We believe that asking about the real unit\nof selection is an exercise in muddled metaphysics” (Kitcher,\nSterelny, & Waters 1990: 159). The basic view is that “the\ncauses of one and the same selection process can be correctly\ndescribed at different levels” (including the genic one) (Waters\n1991: 555). Moreover, these descriptions are on equal ontological\nfooting. Equal, that is, except for when Sterelny and Kitcher slip over into a\ngenuinely reductionist genic view, when they state that it is an error\nto claim  \nthat selection processes must be described in a particular way, and\ntheir error involves them in positing entities, “targets of\nselection,” that do not exist. (1988: 359)  \nHere they seem to be denying the existence of interactors altogether.\nIf interactors don’t exist, then clearly a genic level account\nof the phenomena would be preferable to, not merely equivalent to, a\nhierarchical view. \nThe pluralists do seem to be arguing against the utility of the notion\nof the interactor in studying the selection process. Echoing the\noriginal genic selectionists, their idea is that the whole causal\nstory can be told at the level of genes, and that no higher level\nentities need be proposed or considered in order to have an accurate\nand complete explanation of the selection process. But, arguably, the\ngenic level story cannot be told without taking the functional role of\ninteractors into account, and thus the pluralists cannot avoid\nquibbling about interactors, as they claim (see Lloyd 2005). Nor is\nthe genic account adequate to all selection cases; the genic account\nfails when drift is factored in (Brandon & Nijhout 2006). \nLet us recall what the interactor question in the units of selection\ndebate amounts to: What levels of entities interact with their\nenvironments through their traits in such a way that it makes a\ndifference to replicator success? As mentioned before, there has been\nmuch discussion in the literature about how to delineate and locate\ninteractors among multilayered processes of selection. Each of these\nsuggestions leads to slightly different results and different problems\nand limitations, but each also takes the notion of the interactor\nseriously as a necessary component to understanding a selection\nprocess. \nThe genic pluralists state that “All selective episodes (or,\nperhaps, almost all) can be interpreted in terms of genic selection.\nThat is an important fact about natural selection” (Kitcher,\nSterelny, & Waters 1990: 160). Thus, the functional claim of the\npluralists is that anything that a hierarchical selection model can\ndo, a genic selection model can do just as well. Much attention is\npaid to showing that the two types of models can represent certain\npatterns of selection equally well, even those that are conventionally\nconsidered hierarchical selection. This is argued for using both\nspecific examples and schema for translating hierarchical models into\ngenic ones. Let us consider one challenging case here. \nTake the classic account of the efficacy of interdemic or group\nselection, the case that even G.C. Williams acknowledged was\nhierarchical selection. Lewontin and Dunn (Lewontin & Dunn 1960\nand Lewontin 1962), in investigating the house mouse, found first,\nthat there was segregation distortion, in that over 80% of the sperm\nfrom mice heterozygous for the t-allele also carried the t-allele,\nwhereas the expected rate would be 50%. Second, they also found that\nmale homozygotes (those with two t-alleles) tended to be sterile. (In\nseveral populations the t-alleles were homozygous lethal, but in the\npopulations in question, homozygous males were sterile.) Third, they\nalso found a substantial effect of group extinction based on the fact\nthat female mice would often find themselves in groups in which all\nmales were sterile, and the group itself would therefore go\nextinct. This, then, is how a genuine and empirically robust\nhierarchical model was developed. \nWhat the pluralists want to note about this case is very narrow, that\nis  \nwhether there are real examples of processes that can be modeled as\ngroup selection can be asked and answered entirely within the\ngenic point of view. (Kitcher, Sterelny, & Waters 1990: 160)\n \nJust as a warning to the unwary, the key to understanding the genic\nreinterpretation of this case is to grasp that the pluralists use a\nconcept of genetic environment that their critics ignore. \nThe pluralists tell how to “construct” a genic model of\nthe causes responsible for the frequency of the t-allele. We must\nfirst distinguish  \ngenetic environments that are contained within female mice that are\ntrapped in small populations with only sterile males from genetic\nenvironments that are not contained within such females. In effect,\nthe interactions at the group level would be built in as a part of one\nkind of genetic environment. (Waters 1991: 563)  \nIn other words, various very detailed environments would have to be\nspecified for various different t-alleles and wild-type alleles. In\norder to determine the invariant fitness parameter of a specific\nallele, let’s call it “A” for example, we would need\nto know what kind of environment it is in at the allelic level, e.g.,\nwhether it is paired with a t-allele. Then we would need to know a\nfurther detailed layer of the environment of “A”, such as\nwhat the sex is of the “environment” it is in. If it is in\na t-allele arrangement, and it is also in a male environment, the\nallelic fitness of “A” would be changed. Finally, we need\nto know the type of subpopulation or deme the “A” allele\nis in. Is it in a small deme with many t-alleles? Then it is more\nlikely to become extinct. So, as we can see, various aspects of the\nallele’s environment are built up from the gene out, depending\non what would make a difference to the gene’s fitness in that\nvery particular kind of environment. If you want to know the overall\nfitness of the “A” allele, you add up the fitnesses in\neach set of specialized, detailed environments and weight them\naccording to the frequency of that environment. \nThe idea is:  \nWhat appears as a multiple level selection process (e.g., selection of\nthe t-allele) to those who draw the conceptual divide [between\nenvironments] at the traditional level, appears to genic selectionists\nof Williams’s style as several selection processes being carried\nout at the same level within different genetic environments. (Waters\n1991: 571)  \nThe “same level” here means the “genic level,”\nwhile the genetic environments include everything from the other\nallele at the locus, to whether the genotype is present in a male or\nfemale mouse, to the size and composition of the deme the mouse is in.\nThis completes the sketch of the genic pluralist position. We now turn\nto its reception. \nGenic pluralism’s impact has been largely philosophical rather\nthan biological (but see Shanahan 1997 and Van der Steen & Van den\nBerg 1999). Within philosophy, the view has been widely disseminated\nand taught, and a steady stream of critical responses to the genic\npluralist position has been forthcoming. These responses fall into two\nmain categories: pragmatic and causal. \nThe pragmatic response to genic pluralism simply notes that in any\ngiven selective scenario the genic perspective provides no information\nthat is not also available from the hierarchical point of view. This\nstate of affairs is taken by critics of this type as sufficient reason\nto prefer whichever perspective is most useful for solving the\nproblems facing a particular researcher (Glymour 1999; Van der Steen\n& Van den Berg 1999; and Shanahan 1997). The weakness of this\napproach as a critique of genic pluralism is that it does not so much\ncriticize genic pluralism as simply ignore it. \nThe other major form of critique of genic pluralism is based on\narguments concerning the causal structure of selective episodes. The\nidea here is that while genic pluralism gets the “genetic\nbook-keeping” (i.e., the input/output relations) correct, it\ndoes not accurately reflect the causal processes that bring about the\nresult in question (Wimsatt 1980a,b). Some examples of this approach used against the\ngenic pluralists (including Sober 1990; Sober & Wilson 1994,\n1998) also appeal to aspects of the manifestor-of-adaptations and\nbeneficiary questions to establish the failure of genic pluralism to\nrepresent certain selective events correctly. Causal concerns are also\nraised in some other work (Shanahan 1997, Van der Steen and Van den\nBerg 1999, Stanford 2001, and Glennan 2002), though without the focus\non other units questions. The weakness of this line of criticism is\nits inability to isolate a notion of cause that is both plausible and\nplausibly true of hierarchical but not genic level models. This\nfeature—that the genic and hierarchical models are so similar as\nto be indistinguishable—which appears as an insurmountable\nproblem in the context of debates about differing causal structure,\nturns out to be the locus of critical response to genic pluralism,\nwhich denies that the genic selectionists have any distinct and\ncoherent genic level causes at all (Lloyd 2005; Lloyd et al.\n2005). \nGenic pluralism presents alleles as independent causal entities, with\nthe claim that the availability of such models makes hierarchical\nselection models—and the ensuing debates about how to identify\ninteractors in selection processes—moot. Or, in a less\ncontentious version of the argument, the hierarchical and genic models\nare fully developed causal alternatives (Waters 1991). However, in\neach case of the causal allelic models, these models are directly and\ncompletely derived from precisely the hierarchical models the authors\nreject. Moreover, causal claims made on behalf of alleles are utterly\ndependent on hierarchically identified and established interactors\nas causes, thus undermining their claims that the units of\nselection (interactor) debates are mere “quibbles” and are\nirrelevant to the representation of selection processes. Moreover, and\ncontrary to the claims of pluralists, cases of frequency-dependence,\nsuch as in heterosis and in game-theoretic models of selection,\nnecessitate selection at higher than genic levels because the relevant\nproperties of the entities at the genic level are only definable\nrelative to higher levels of organization. Thus, they cannot be\nproperly described as properties of alleles nor are they “even\ndefinable at the allelic level.” (Sarkar 2008: 219) In addition,\nwhen drift is taken into account, the genic accounts fail to be\nempirically adequate (Brandon & Nijhout 2006). \nWe can say that the allelic level models are completely derivative\nfrom higher level models of selection processes using the following\nguidelines (Lloyd 2005). Two models that are mathematically equivalent\nmay be semantically different, that is, they have different\ninterpretations. Such models can be independent from one another or\none may be derivative of the other. In the genic selection case, the\npluralists appear to be claiming that the genic level models are\nindependent from the hierarchical models. The claim is: although the\ngenic models are mathematically equivalent, they have different\nparameters, and a different interpretation, and they are completely\nindependent from hierarchical models. \nBut, despite the pluralists’ repeated claims, we can see from\ntheir own calculations and examples that theirs are\nderivative models, and thus, that their “genic”\nlevel causes are derivative from and dependent on higher level causes.\nTheir genic level models depend for their empirical, causal, and\nexplanatory adequacy on entire mathematical structures taken from the\nhierarchical models and refashioned. \nAs reviewed above, one example from their own writing comes from the\ntreatment of the t-allele case, a universally recognized case of three\nlevels of selection operating simultaneously on a single allele. Right\nbefore the t-allele case, a suggestion is offered that a\nWilliams’s type analysis could be based on an application of\nLloyd’s additivity criterion for identifying\ninteractors, which is strictly hierarchical (Waters 1991:\n563; Lloyd [1988] 1994: Ch. 5). Thus, the pluralist suggestion is to\nborrow a method for identifying potential higher-level interactors in\norder to determine the genic environments and thus to have more\nadequate genic level models. Similarly, other pluralists resort to a\ntraditional approach to identifying interactors in order to make their\ngenic models work. It had earlier been proposed that the statistical\nidea of screening off be used to identify which levels of entities are\ncausally effective in the selection process; i.e., it is a method used\nto isolate interactors (Brandon 1982). But some pluralists propose\nusing screening off to identify layers of allelic environments, and\nalso show how Sober’s probabilistic causal account could be used\nfor a genic account (Sterelny & Kitcher 1988: 354). \nHence, the pluralists all use the same methods for isolating relevant\ngenic-level environments as others do for the traditional isolating of\ninteractors. What, we may ask, is the real difference? Both can be\nseen as attempting to get the causal influences on selection right,\nbecause they are using the same methods. What is different is that the\ngenic selectionists want to tell the causal story in terms of genes\nand not in terms of interactors and genes. Moreover, they propose\ndoing away with interactors altogether, by renaming them the\ngenic-level environments. Are we to think that renaming changes the\nmetaphysics of the situation? \nIt seems that levels of interaction important to the outcome of the\nselection process are being discovered in the usual ways, i.e., by\nusing approaches to interactors and their environments, and that that\nexact same information is being translated into talk of the\ndifferentiated and layered environments of the genes. \nThe issue concerning renaming model structures is especially confusing\nin the genic pluralists presentations, because they repeatedly rely on\nan assumption or intuition that, given an allelic state space, we are\ndealing with allelic causes. This last assumption is easily traced\nback to the original genic selectionist views that alleles are the\nultimate beneficiaries of any long term selection process (Williams\n1966; Dawkins 1982a,b); thus, the genic pluralist argument rests\nsubstantially on a view regarding the superior importance of the\nbeneficiary question, which has been clearly delineated from the\ninteractor question, above. \nLet us summarize the consequences of derivativeness in terms of the\nscience and metaphysics of the processes discussed. First, the genic\npluralists end up offering not, as they claim, a variety of genuinely\ndiverse causal versions of the selection process at different levels.\nThis is because the causes of the hierarchical models, however\ndetermined, are simply transformed and renamed in the lower level\nmodels, but remain fully intact as relevant causes at the full range\nof higher and lower levels. More importantly, no new allelic causes\nare introduced. Second, while genic models may be derived from\nhierarchical models, they fail to sustain the necessary supporting\nmethodology. Third, the lack of genuine alternative causal accounts\ndestroys the claims of pluralism or, at least, of any interesting\nphilosophical variety, since there are no genuine alternatives being\npresented, unless you count renaming model structures as\nmetaphysically significant (see also Okasha\n 2011).[18]\n Thus, the picture of proposing an alternative\n“interactor” at the genic level is not fulfilled (vs.\nSterelny & Kitcher 1988). Perhaps the best way to save the\npluralist vision is to appeal to the work on neighbor selection\n(Godfrey-Smith 2008),\nwhich can be cast within a pluralist program. This effort is to revive\nand discuss an alternative fashion of modeling altruism or group\nbenefit, within the terms of a lower, individual level (see the\ndiscussion in\n section 3.1, Genic Selection: The Originators). \nThere is a further complication with respect to the nature of the\ngenic selection models put forward by genic pluralists. These models\nfunction under the presupposition that they are at least\nmathematically equivalent to hierarchical models. This claim has\nlargely depended on the work of Dugatkin and Reeve in establishing\nthis equivalence (Dugatkin & Reeve 1994, Sterelny 1996b, Sober\n& Wilson 1998, Sterelny & Griffiths 1999, Kerr &\nGodfrey-Smith 2002a, Waters 2005). However, foundational work has\nindicated that this equivalence does not in fact hold. In Dugatkin and\nReeve and the rest of this literature, comparison of population\ngenetic models was largely based on predictions of allele frequency\nchanges; in other words, if two models made the same predictions as to\nthe changes of allelic frequencies in a given situation, then the\nmodels are equivalent. However, this is an overly simplistic method\nfor testing model equivalence which pays little mind to the details of\nthe models themselves. When the notion of representational adequacy of\nthe models is taken into account, specifically through the inclusion\nof parametric and dynamical sufficiency as important points of\ncomparison, this equivalence between genic and hierarchical models\ndisappears (Lloyd, Lewontin, & Feldman 2008; Lewontin 1974; see\nalso\n group selection\n for more on formal equivalence). \nParametric sufficiency concerns what state space and variables are\nsufficient to capture the relevant properties of a given system, while\ndynamical sufficiency  \nconcerns what state space and variables are sufficient to describe the\nevolution of a system given the parameters being used in the specific\nsystem. (Lloyd, Lewontin, & Feldman 2008: 146; Lewontin 1974)  \nUtilizing these concepts allows for a more detailed and meaningful\nevaluation of a given mathematical model. And under such an analysis,\nthe claims regarding the equivalency of genic and hierarchical models\ncannot be sustained. Since allelic parameters and the changes in\nallelic frequencies depend on genotypic fitnesses, the genic models\nclaimed to be equivalent to the hierarchical models are neither\nparametrically nor dynamically\n sufficient.[19] \nIn our preceding discussions of units of selection, we have restricted\nourselves to situations in which the various units were\npre-established entities. Our approach has been synchronic, one in\nwhich the relevant units, be they genes, organisms, or populations,\nare the same both before and after a given evolutionary process.\nHowever, not all evolutionary processes may be able to be captured\nunder such a perspective. In particular, recent discussions regarding\nso-called “evolutionary transitions” present a unique\ncomplication to the debates over units and levels of selection. \nEvolutionary transition is “the process that creates\nnew levels of biological organization” (Griesemer 2000c:\n69), such as the origins of chromosomes,\nmulticellularity, eukaryotes, and social groups (Maynard-Smith and\nSzathmáry 1995: 6–7). These transitions all share a\ncommon feature, namely that “entities that were capable of\nindependent replication before the transition can replicate only as\npart of a larger whole after it” (Maynard-Smith and\nSzathmáry 1995: 6). \nEvolutionary transitions create new potential levels and units of\nselection by creating new kinds of entities that can have variances in\nfitness. Thus, it is the “project of a theory of evolutionary\ntransition to explain the evolutionary origin of entities with such\ncapacities” (Griesemer 2000c: 70). However, since such cases involve the evolutionary\norigin of a given level of selection, traditional synchronic\napproaches to units and levels of selection, which assume the\npre-existence of a “hierarchy of entities that are\npotential candidates for units of selection”, may be\ninsufficient, since it is the evolution of those very properties that\nallow entities to serve as, for example, interactors or replicators\nthat is being addressed (Griesemer 2000c: 70). Such a task requires a\ndiachronic perspective, one under which the properties of our\ncurrently extant units of selection cannot be presupposed.  \n…[A]s long as evolutionary theory concerns the function of\ncontemporary units at fixed levels of the biological\nhierarchy…, the functionalist approach may be adequate to its\nintended task. However, if a philosophy of units is to address\nproblems going beyond this scope—for example to problems of\nevolutionary transition,… then a different approach is\nneeded. (Griesemer 2003: 174) \nThe “reproducer” concept (discussed in\n section 2.2),\n which incorporates the notion of development into the treatment of\nunits and levels of selection, is a step toward meeting the goal of\naddressing such evolutionary transitions, and  \nthe dependency of formerly independent replicators on the\n“replication” of the wholes—the basis for the\ndefinition of evolutionary transition … is a\ndevelopmental dependency that should be incorporated into the\nanalysis of units. (2000c: 75)  \nThose adopting the reproducer concept argue that thinking in broader\nterms of reproducers avoids the presupposition of evolved coding\nmechanisms implicit to the concept of replicators. In the case of\nevolutionary transitions, this allows us to separate the basic\ndevelopment involved in the origin of a new biological level from the\nlater evolution of sophisticated developmental mechanisms for the\n“stabilization and maintenance of a new level of\nreproduction” (Griesemer 2000c: 77). \nExplaining evolutionary transitions in Darwinian terms poses a\nparticular challenge: “Why was it advantageous for the\nlower-level units to sacrifice their individuality and form themselves\ninto a corporate body?” (Okasha 2006: 218). On one analysis,\nthree stages of such a transition, each defined in terms of the\nconnection between fitness at the level of the collective and the\nindividual fitness of its component particles, are identified (Okasha\n2006: 238). Initially, collective fitness is simply defined as average\nparticle fitness. As fitness at the two levels begins to be decoupled,\ncollective fitness remains proportional to average particle fitness,\nbut is not defined by it; at such a stage, “the emerging\ncollective lacks ‘individuality’, and has no\ncollective-level functions of its own” (Okasha 2006: 237).\nFinally, collective fitness “starts to depend on the\nfunctionality of the collective itself” (Okasha 2006:\n237–8; see Okasha 2015 for a representation of this in terms of\ncausal graphs). \nOn this analysis, the different stages of an evolutionary transition\ninvolve different conceptions of multi-level selection (Okasha 2006,\n2015). Using the distinction defended by Lorraine Heisler and John\nDamuth (Heisler & Damuth 1987; Damuth & Heisler 1988) in their\n“contextual analysis” of units of selection, this analysis\nclaims that early on in the process of an evolutionary transition,\nmulti-level selection 1 (MLS1), in which the particles themselves are\nthe “‘focal’ units” upon which selection\ndirectly acts, applies. However, by the end of the transition, both\nthe collectives and the particles are focal units of selection\nprocesses, with independent fitnesses, a case of Damuth and\nHeisler’s multi-level selection 2 (MLS2) (Okasha 2006: 4). An\neasy way to capture this distinction is that, under MLS1, the lower\nlevel particles are the interactors as well as the replicators, while\nin MLS2, both the upper level collectives as well as the particles are\ninteractors. Thus, the issues surrounding evolutionary transitions\ninvolve both the interactor question and the replicator question.\nUnderstanding evolutionary transitions hence provides additional\nsignificance to Damuth and Heisler’s distinction:  \nRather than simply describing selection processes of different sorts,\nwhich should be kept separate in the interests of conceptual clarity,\nMLS1 and MLS2 represent different temporal stages of an\nevolutionary transition. (Okasha 2006: 239) \nOn a different approach, evolutionary transitions are seen as the\nappearance of a “new kind of Darwinian population”, of\n“new entities that can enter into Darwinian processes in their\nown right” (Godfrey-Smith 2009: 122). These transitions involve\na “de-Darwinizing” of the lower-level entities such that\n \nan initial collective has come to engage in definite high-level\nreproduction, and this has involved the curtailing of independent\nevolution at the lower level. (Godfrey-Smith 2009: 124)  \nThis can be accomplished in a variety of ways, such as through the\nbottleneck caused by the production of new collectives from single\nindividuals, coupled with germ-line segregation (as in the transitions\nto multicellularity), or by a single member of the collective\npreventing all other members from reproducing (for example, among\neusocial insects), or by single member having primary but not total\ncontrol over the other constituents (as in the evolution of\neukaryotes) (Godfrey-Smith 2009: 123–124). \nThese processes all involve restrictions on the ability of the\nlower-level entities to function as interactors and replicators, and\nthe emergence of upper-level collectives as both interactors and\nreplicators. The degree to which lower-level entities are thus\nrestricted can vary. For example, somatic cells are still capable of\nbearing individual fitness, of outcompeting neighboring cells, and of\nproducing more progeny. Thus, they are not yet\n“post-populational”; they “retain crucial Darwinian\nfeatures in their own right” (Godfrey-Smith 2009: 126). However,\nthey are dependent on the germ-line cells for the propagation of new\ncollectives, and thus their ability to act as replicators is\nnecessarily curtailed. Thus, in order to prevent subversion and\nencourage cooperation, such a transition requires both the\n“generation of benefit” and the\n“alignment of reproductive interests”\n(Godfrey-Smith 2009: 124, with terminology from Calcott 2008; see\nBooth’s 2014 analysis of heterokaryotic Fungi using\nGodfrey-Smith’s approach). For example, in the case of\nmulticellularity, the latter can be accomplished by “close\nkinship within the collective” (Godfrey-Smith 2009: 124). \nIn a useful analysis of the volvocine algae, other hierarchical\nselectionists use optimality modeling at the group level to search for\na group level adaptation, in aid of modeling evolutionary transitions\n(Shelton & Michod 2014b). They look for selection and adaptation\nat the higher level in their model of transition, which contrasts\nother views that look only for selection at the higher level, but not\nfor engineering adaptations. The emphasis is on the distinction\nbetween fortuitous group benefit and real group adaptation. In places,\nhowever, they seem to embrace the product-of-selection definition of\ngroup adaptation, even though they are committed to denying its\napplicability (2014b: 454). Their point is to decompose levels of\nselection and adaptation using a model organism to get evolutionary\nemergence of levels, i.e., evolutionary transition. \nThus, there are a variety of philosophical approaches to analyzing\nevolutionary transition on offer, whether in terms of reproducers,\nmultilevel selection, or Darwinian populations. The essential\ndiachronic nature of the problem poses a unique challenge, and\ninvolves not just the interactor and replicator (or reproducer)\nquestions, but also the questions of who is the beneficiary of the\nselection process, and how that new level emerges. \nIt makes no sense to treat different answers as competitors if they\nare answering different questions. We have reviewed a framework of\nfour questions with which the debates appearing under the rubric of\n“units of selection” can be classified and clarified. The\noriginal discussants of the units of selection problem separated the\nclassic question about the level of selection or interaction (the\ninteractor question) from the issue of how large a chunk of the genome\nfunctions as a replicating unit (the replicator question). The\ninteractor question should also be separated from the question of\nwhich entity should be seen as acquiring adaptations as a result of\nthe selection process (the manifestor-of-adaptation question). In\naddition, there is a crucial ambiguity in the meaning of adaptation\nthat is routinely ignored in these debates: adaptation as a selection\nproduct and adaptation as an engineering design. Finally, we can\ndistinguish the issue of the entity that ultimately benefits from the\nselection process (the beneficiary question) from the other three\nquestions. \nThis set of distinctions has been used to analyze leading points of\nview about the units of selection and to clarify precisely the\nquestion or combination of questions with which each of the\nprotagonists is concerned. There are many points in the debates in\nwhich misunderstandings may be avoided by a precise characterization\nof which of the units of selection questions is being addressed.","contact.mail":"ealloyd@indiana.edu","contact.domain":"indiana.edu"}]
