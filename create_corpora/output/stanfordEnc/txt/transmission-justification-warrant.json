Although he doesn’t know how cold it is, Ted conjectures that\nthe temperature must be below 0 °C. Out of curiosity, he checks\nthe weather app of his smartphone. To his astonishment, he sees that\nit is −30 °C. He concludes that this is the least temperature to\nwhich he has been exposed ever. Ted’s belief about his personal record\nowes its justification to Ted’s belief that it is −30 °C,\njustified by the evidence supplied by his smartphone, and Ted’s\nacknowledging that if it is −30 °C, then this is the least\ntemperature to which he has been exposed ever. When one’s belief\nq derives its justification from the justification that one has\nfor another belief p in this way, it has become customary to\nsay that the justification for p transmits to q\nacross the inferential link from p to q.\n\n\nTransmission of justification across inference is a valuable and\nindeed ubiquitous epistemic phenomenon in everyday life and science.\nIt is thanks to the phenomenon of epistemic transmission that\ninferential reasoning is a means for substantiating predictions of\nfuture events and, more generally, for expanding the sphere of our\njustified beliefs or reinforcing the justification of beliefs that we\nalready entertain. However, transmission of justification is not\nwithout exceptions. As a few epistemologists have come to realise,\nmore or less trivial forms of circularity can prevent justification\nfrom transmitting from p to q even if one has\njustification for p and one is aware of the inferential link\nfrom p to q. In interesting cases this happens because\none can acquire justification for p only if one has\nindependent justification for q. In this case the\njustification for q cannot depend on the justification for\np and the inferential link from p to q, as\ngenuine transmission would require.\n\n\nThe phenomenon of transmission failure seems to shed light on\nphilosophical puzzles, such as Moore’s proof of a material world and\nMcKinsey’s paradox, and it plays a central role in various\nphilosophical debates. For this reason it is being granted continued\nand increasing attention.\n\nArthur has the measles and stays in a closed environment with his\nlittle sister Mafalda. If Mafalda ends up contracting the measles\nherself because of her staying in close contact with Arthur, there\nmust be something—the measles virus—which is transmitted\nfrom Arthur to Mafalda in virtue of a relation—the relation of\nstaying in close contact with one another—instantiated by the\ntwo siblings. Epistemologists have been devoting their attention to\nthe fact that epistemicproperties—like being justified\nor being known—are often transmitted in a similar way. An\nexample—which we shall not discuss in this entry—is the\ntransmission of knowledge via testimony from an individual to another.\nA different but equally important phenomenon—which occupies\ncentre stage in this entry—is the transmission of epistemic\njustification across an inference or argument from one proposition to\nanother.\n \nConsider proposition q constituting the conclusion of an\nargument having proposition p as premise (where p can be\na set or conjunction of more propositions). If p is justified\nfor a subject s by evidence e, this justification may\ntransmit to q if s is aware of the entailment between\np and q. When this happens, q is justified for\ns in virtue of her justification for p based on\ne and her knowledge of the inferential relation from p\nto q. Consider this example from Wright (2002): \nHere a subject s can deductively infer Q1 from\nP1 given some background\n information.[1]\n Suppose s acquires justification for P1 by learning\nE1. In this case s will also acquire justification\nfor Q1 in virtue of her knowledge of the inferential\nrelation from P1 to Q1 and her justification for\n P1.[2]\n Thus s’s justification for P1 will transmit to\nQ1. \nIt is widely recognised that epistemic justification sometimes\nfails to transmit across an inference or argument. In\ninteresting cases of transmission failure, s has justification\nfor believing p and s knows the inferential link between\np and q, but s has no justification for believing\nq in virtue of her justification for p and her\nknowledge of the inferential link. Here is an example from Wright\n(2003). Suppose s’s background information entails, among\nordinary things, that Jessica and Jocelyn are indistinguishable twins.\nConsider this possible reasoning: \nIn Twins E2 can give s justification for\nbelieving P2 only if s has independent\njustification for believing Q2 in the first instance.\nSuppose that s does have independent justification for\nbelieving Q2, and imagine that s learns\nE2. In this case s will acquire justification for\nbelieving P2 from E2. But it is intuitive that\ns will acquire no justification for Q2in virtue\nof her justification for believing P2 based on\nE2 and her knowledge of the inferential link between\nP2 and Q2. So Twins instantiates\ntransmission failure when Q2 is independently\njustified. \nAn argument incapable of transmitting to its conclusion a\nspecific justification for its premise(s)—e.g., a\njustification based on evidence e—may turn out to be able\nto transmit to the same conclusion a different justification for its\npremise(s)—e.g., one based on different evidence e*.\nReplace for instance E2 with E2* = ‘This\ngirl’s passport certifies she is Jessica’ in Twins.\nE2* appears capable of providing s with\njustification for believing P2 even if s has no\nindependent justification for Q2. Suppose then that\ns has no independent justification for Q2, and that\nshe acquires E2*. It is intuitive that s will\nacquire justification from E2* for P2 that does\ntransmit to Q2. Now the inference from P2 to\nQ2 instantiates epistemic transmission.  \nAlthough many of the epistemologists taking part in the debate on\nepistemic transmission and transmission failure speak of transmission\nof warrant, rather than justification, they all seem\nto use the term ‘warrant’ to refer to some kind of\nepistemic justification. Most epistemologists investigating epistemic\ntransmission and transmission failure—e.g., Wright (2011, 2007,\n2004, 2003, 2002 and 1985), Davies (2003a, 2000 and 1998), Dretske\n(2005), Pryor (2004), Moretti (2012) and Moretti & Piazza\n(2013)—broadly identify the epistemic property capable of being\ntransmitted with propositional\n justification.[3]\n Only a few authors explicitly focus on transmission of\ndoxastic justification—e.g., Silins (2005), Davies\n(2009) and Tucker (2010a and 2010b). In this entry we will follow the\nmajority in discussing transmission and failure of transmission of\njustification as phenomena primarily pertaining to propositional\njustification. (See however the supplement on\n Transmission of Propositional Justification versus Transmission of Doxastic Justification.) \nEpistemologists typically concentrate on transmission of\n(propositional or doxastic) justification across deductively\nvalid arguments (or arguments deductively valid given background\ninformation). The fact that justification can transmit across\ndeduction is crucial for our cognitive processes because it makes the\nadvancement of knowledge—or of justified belief—through\ndeductive reasoning possible. Suppose evidence e gives you\njustification for believing hypothesis or proposition p and you\nknow that p entails another proposition q that you have\nnot directly checked. If the justification you have for p\ntransmits to its unchecked prediction q through the entailment,\nyou acquire justification for believing q too. \nEpistemologists may analyse epistemic transmission across\nampliative (or inductive) inferences too. (Note that\narguments deductively valid given background information can\noften be turned into good ampliative arguments by simply removing some\nbackground information.) Yet this topic has received much less\nattention in the recent literature on epistemic transmission. (See\nhowever interesting remarks in Tucker 2010a.) \nIn the remaining part of this entry we will focus on transmission and\ntransmission failure of propositional justification across deductive\ninference. Unless differently specified, by ‘epistemic\njustification’ or ‘justification’ we will always\nmean ‘propositional justification’. \nAs said, s’s justification for p based on evidence\ne transmits across entailment from p to p’s\nconsequence q whenever q is justified for s in\nvirtue of s’s justification for p based on e and\nher knowledge of q’s deducibility from p. This initial\ncharacterisation can be distilled into three conditions individually\nnecessary and jointly sufficient for epistemic transmission: \ns’s justification for p based on e transmits to\np’s logical consequence q if and only if: \nCondition (iii) is crucial for distinguishing transmission of\njustification across (known) entailment from closure of\njustification across (known) entailment. To say that a subject\ns’s justification for believing p is closed under\np’s (known) entailment to q is to say that:\n \nIf (i) s has justification for believing p and (ii)\ns knows that p entails q, then (iii-c) s\nhas justification for believing q.\n \nOne can coherently accept the above principle—known as the\n principle of epistemic closure—and\n deny a corresponding principle of epistemic transmission,\ncashed out in terms of the conditions outlined above:\n \nIf (i) s has justification for believing p and (ii)\ns knows that p entails q, then (iii) s has\njustification for believing q in virtue of the\nsatisfaction of (i) and (ii).\n \nThe principle of epistemic closure just requires that when\ns has justification for believing p and knows that\nq is deducible from p, s have justification for\nbelieving q. In addition, the principle of epistemic\ntransmission requires this justification to be had in virtue of\nher having justification for p and knowing that p\nentails q (for further discussion see Tucker 2010b). \nAnother important distinction, at this juncture, is the one between\nthe principle of epistemic transmission and a different\nprinciple of transmission discussed by Pritchard (2012) under the\nlabel of evidential transmission principle. According to\nit, \nIf s perceptually knows that p in virtue of evidence set\ne, and s competently deduces q from p\n(thereby coming to believe that q while retaining her knowledge\nthat p), then s knows that q, where that\nknowledge is sufficiently supported by e. (Pritchard 2012, 75)\n \nPritchard’s principle, to begin with, pertains to (perceptual)\nknowledge and not to propositional justification. Moreover, it\ndeserves emphasis that there are inferences that apparently satisfy\nPritchard’s principle but fail to satisfy the principle of\nepistemic transmission. Consider for instance the following triad:\n \n(Zebra)\n\nE3. The animals in the pen look like zebras.\n\nP3. The animals in the pen are zebras.\n\nTherefore:\n\nQ3. The animals in the pen are not mules cleverly disguised\nso as to look like zebras.\n \nAccording to Pritchard, the evidence set of a normal zoo-goer standing\nbefore the zebra enclosure will typically include, above and beyond\nE3, the background proposition that (EB) to\ndisguise mules like zebras would be very costly and time-consuming,\nwould bring no comparable benefit and would be relatively easy to\nunmask. Suppose s knows P3 on the basis of her\nevidence set, and competently deduces Q3 from P3\nthereby coming to believe Q3. Pritchard’s evidential\ntransmission principle apparently accommodates the fact that\ns thereby comes to know Q3. For her evidence set\n— because of its inclusion of EB\n— sufficiently supports Q3. But the\nprinciple of epistemic transmission is not satisfied. Although\n(i) s has justification for P3 and (ii) she knows that\nP3 entails Q3, she has justification for\nbelieving Q3 in virtue of, not (i) and (ii), but the\nindependent support lent to it by EB.  \nCondition (iii) is sufficient to distinguish the notion of epistemic\ntransmission from different notions in the neighbourhood. However, as\nit stands, it is still unsuitable for the purpose to completely\ncharacterize the phenomenon of epistemic transmission. The problem is\nthat there are many other cases in which it is intuitive that the\njustification for p based on e transmits to q\neven if condition (iii), strictly speaking, is not satisfied.\nThese cases can be described as situations in which only part\nof the justification that s has for q is based on her\njustification for p and her knowledge of the entailment from\np to q. Consider the following example. Suppose you are\ntravelling on a train heading to Edinburgh. At 16:00, as you enter\nNewcastle upon Tyne, you spot the train station sign. Then, at 16:05,\nthe ticket controller tells you that you are not yet in Scotland. Now\nconsider the following reasoning:  \nAs you learn E4, given suitable background information, you\nacquire justification for P4; moreover, to the extent to\nwhich you know that not being in Scotland is sufficient for not being\nin Edinburgh, you also acquire via transmission justification for\nQ4. This additional justification is transmitted\nirrespective of the fact that you already have justification\nfor Q4, acquired by spotting the train station sign\n‘Newcastle upon Tyne’. If (iii) were read as requiring\nthat the whole of the justification available for a proposition\nq were had in virtue of the satisfaction of (i) and (ii), cases\nlike these would become invisible. \nA simple way to deal with this complication is to amend the tripartite\nanalysis of epistemic transmission by turning (iii) into (iii+),\nsaying that at least part of the justification that s\nhas for q has been achieved by her in virtue of the\nsatisfaction of (i) and (ii). Let us say that a justification for\nq is an additional justification for q whenever\nit is not a first-time justification for it. Condition (iii+)\ncan be reformulated as the following disjunction: \nMuch of the extant literature on epistemic transmission concentrates\non examples of transmission of first-time justification. These\nexamples include Toadstool. We have seen, however, that what\nintuitively transmits in certain cases is simply additional\njustification. Epistemologists have identified at least\ntwo—possibly overlapping—kinds of additional justification\n(cf. for instance Moretti & Piazza 2013).  \nOne is what can be called independent justification because it\nappears—intuitively—independent of the original\njustification for q. This notion of justification could\nprobably be sharpened by appealing to counterfactual analysis. Suppose\ns’s justification for p based on e transmits to\np’s logical consequence q. This justification\ntransmitted to q is an additional independent\njustification just in case the following three conditions are met: (1)\ns was already justified in believing q before acquiring\ne, (2) as s acquires e, s is still\njustified in believing q, and (3) if s had not been\nantecedently justified in believing q, upon learning e,\ns would have acquired via transmission a first-time\njustification for believing q. Journey instantiates\ntransmission of justification by meeting (1), (2) and (3). Thus\nJourney exemplifies a case of transmission of additional\nindependent justification. \nConsider now that justification for a proposition or belief normally\ncomes in degrees of strength. The second kind of additional\njustification can be characterised as quantitatively\nstrengthening justification. Suppose again that s’s\njustification for p based on e transmits to p’s\nlogical consequence q. This justification transmitted to\nq is an additional quantitatively strengthening\njustification just in case the following two conditions are satisfied:\n(1) s was already justified in believing q before\nacquiring e, and (2*) as s acquires e, the\nstrength of s’s justification for believing q increases.\nHere is an example from Moretti (2012). Your background information\nsays that only one ticket out of 5,000 of a fair lottery has been\nbought by a person born in 1970, and that all other tickets have been\nbought by older or younger people. Consider now this reasoning: \nThe proposition Q5 given its high chance, is already\njustified on your background information only. As you learn\nE5, it is intuitive that you acquire an additional\nquantitatively strengthening justification for Q5 via\ntransmission. For your justification for P5 transmitted to\nQ5 is intuitively quantitatively stronger than your initial\njustification for Q5. \nIn many cases when q receives via transmission from p an\nadditional independent justification, q will also receive a\nquantitatively strengthening justification. This is not true in\ngeneral though. For there seem to be cases in which an additional\nindependent justification transmitted from p to q\nintuitively lessens an antecedent justification for q\n(cf. Wright 2011).\n \nAn interesting question is whether it is true that as q\nreceives via transmission from p an additional quantitatively\nstrengthening justification, q also receives an independent\njustification. This seems true in some cases—for instance in\nLottery above. It is controversial, however, whether it is the\ncase that whenever q receives via transmission a\nquantitatively strengthening justification, q also receives an\nindependent justification. Wright 2011, and Moretti & Piazza 2013\ndescribe two examples in which a subject allegedly receives via\ntransmission a quantitatively strengthening but not independent\nadditional justification.\n \nTo summarise, additional justification comes apparently in two\nspecies at least: independent justification and\nquantitatively strengthening justification. This fact enables\nus to lay down three specifications of the general condition (iii+)\nnecessary for justification transmission, each of which represents a\ncondition necessary for the transmission of one particular type of\njustification. Let us call these specifications (iii-ft), (iii-ai) and\n(iii-aqs). \n(iii-ft) s has first time justification for q in\nvirtue of the satisfaction of (i) and (ii).\n \n(iii-ai) s has additional independent justification for\nq in virtue of the satisfaction of (i) and (ii).\n \n(iii-aqs) s has additional quantitatively strengthening\njustification for q in virtue of the satisfaction of (i) and\n(ii).\n \nTransmission of first-time justification makes the advancement of\njustified belief through deductive reasoning possible. However, the\nacquisition of first-time justification for q is not the sole\npossible improvement of one’s epistemic position relative to q\nthat one could expect from transmission of justification. Moretti\n& Piazza (2013, 2491–93), for instance, have described a variety\nof different ways in which s’s epistemic standing toward a\nproposition can be improved upon the acquisition via transmission of\nan additional justification for it. \nIt is widely acknowledged that justification sometimes fails to\ntransmit across known entailment (this acknowledgement dates back at\nleast to Wright 1985). Moreover, it is no overstatement to say that\nthe recent literature has investigated the phenomenon of failure of\ntransmission of justification more extensively than that of\ntransmission of justification. As we have seen, justification based on\ne transmits from p to q across the entailment if\nand only if (i) s has justification for p based on\ne, (ii) s knows that q is deducible from\np, and (iii+) at least part of s’s justification for\nq is based on the satisfaction of (i) and (ii). It follows from\nthis characterisation that no justification based on e\ntransmits from p to q across the entailment if\ncondition (i), condition (ii), or condition (iii+) are not satisfied.\nThese are cases of transmission failure.  \nThe most trivial cases of transmission failure are such that it is\ntrue that condition (iii+) is unsatisfied because condition (i) or\ncondition (ii) are unsatisfied, but it is also true that (iii+) would\nhave been satisfied if both condition (i) and (ii) have been satisfied\n(cf. Tucker 2010b). It deserves emphasis that these cases involve\narguments that are not unsuitable for the purpose to transmit\njustification depending on evidence e: had the epistemic\ncircumstances been congenial to the satisfaction of (i) and (ii),\nthese arguments would have transmitted the justification based on\ne from p to q. As we could put the point, these\narguments are transmissive of the justification depending on\n e.[4] \nMore interesting cases of transmission failure—or, for some\nauthors (e.g., Beebee 2001), the only genuine cases of transmission\nfailure—are those in which condition (iii+) is not satisfied\nbecause it could not have been satisfied, no matter whether or not\nconditions (i) and (ii) have been satisfied. These cases concern\narguments non-transmissive of justification depending on a\ngiven evidence, i.e., arguments incapable of transmitting\njustification depending on that evidence under any epistemic\ncircumstance. One example in point is provided by Twins.\nSuppose first that s has independent justification for\nQ2. In those circumstances (i) s has justification\nfrom E2 for P2. Furthermore (ii) s does know\nthat P2 entails Q2. However, s has not\njustification for Q2 in virtue of the satisfaction of (i)\nand (ii). So (iii+) is not met. Suppose now that s has no\nindependent justification for Q2. Then, it is not the case\nthat (i) s has justification from E2 for\nP2. So, in this case (iii+) is not met either. Since there\nis no other possibility — either s has independent\njustification for Q2 or she doesn’t — it\ncannot be the case that s’s belief that Q2 is\njustified in virtue of her justification for P2\nfrom E2 and her knowledge that P2 entails\nQ2.  \nIt is worth noting that none of these cases of failure of transmission\nof justification considered above entails failure of epistemic\nclosure. For in none of these cases s has justification\nfor believing p, s knows that p entails q,\nand s fails to have justification for believing q. \nUnsurprisingly, the epistemologists contributing to the literature on\ntransmission failure have principally devoted their attention to the\ncases of transmission failure involving non-transmissive arguments.\nSome epistemologists have attempted to identify conditions whose\nsatisfaction suffices to make an argument non-transmissive of\njustification based on a given evidence. The next section is devoted\nto reviewing the most influential of these proposals. \nSome non-transmissive arguments explicitly feature their\nconclusion among their premises. Suppose p is justified for\ns by e, and consider the premise-circular argument that\ndeduces p from itself. This argument cannot satisfy condition\n(iii+) even if conditions (i) and (ii) are satisfied. The reason is\nthat no part of s’s justification for p can be acquired\nin virtue of, among other things, the satisfaction of (ii). For\nif (i) is satisfied, p is justified for s by the\nrelevant evidence e independently of s’s\nknowledge of p’ self-entailment, thus not in virtue of\n(ii). \nNon-transmissive arguments are not necessarily premise-circular\narguments. A different source of non-transmissivity instantiating a\nsubtler form of circularity is the dependence of evidential relations\non background or collateral information. This type of dependence is a\nrather familiar phenomenon: the boiling of a kettle on a camping stove\ngives one justification for believing that the temperature of the\nliquid inside is approximately 100 °C only if one knows\nthat the liquid is water and that atmospheric pressure is the one of\nthe sea-level. It doesn’t if one knows that the kettle is on the top\nof a high mountain, or if one knows that the kettle contains, say,\nsulphuric acid.  \nWright argues, for instance, that the following epistemic set-up,\nwhich he calls the information-dependence template, suffices\nfor an argument’s inability to transmit justification. \nA body of evidence, e, is an information-dependent\njustification for a particular proposition p if whether\ne justifies p depends on what one has by way of\ncollateral information, i. […] Such a relationship is\nalways liable to generate examples of transmission failure: it will do\nso just when the particular e, p, and i have the\nfeature that needed elements of the relevant i are themselves\nentailed by p (together perhaps with other warranted premises).\nIn that case, any warrant supplied by e for p will not\nbe transmissible to those elements of i. (2003, 59, edited.)\n \nThe claim that s’s justification from e for p\nrequires s to have background information i is\ncustomarily understood as equivalent (in this context) to the claim\nthat s’s justification from e for p depends on\nsome type of independent justification for believing or accepting\n i.[5] \nThe instantiation of the information-dependence template\nappears sufficient for an argument’s inability to transmit\nfirst-time justification. Consider again the following\ntriad: \n(Twins)\n\nE2. This girl looks just like Jessica.\n\nP2. This girl is actually Jessica.\n\nTherefore:\n\nQ2. This girl is not Jocelyn.  \nSuppose s’s background information entails that Jessica and\nJocelyn are indistinguishable twins. Imagine that s acquires\nE2. It is intuitive that E2 could justify\nP2 for s in Twins only if s had\nindependent justification for believing Q2 in the\nfirst instance. Thus Twins instantiates the\ninformation-dependence template. Note that s acquires\nfirst-time justification for Q2 in Twins only if (i)\nE2 gives her justification for P2, (ii) s\nknows that P2 entails Q2 and (iii-ft) s\nacquires first-time justification for believing Q2in\nvirtue of (i) and (ii). The satisfaction of (iii-ft) requires\ns’s justification for believing Q2not to be\nindependent of s’s justification from E2 for\nP2. However, if (i) is true, the\ninformational-dependence template requires s to have\njustification for believing Q2independently of\ns’s justification from E2 for P2. Thus,\nwhen the information-dependence template is instantiated, (i)\nand (iii-ft) cannot be satisfied at once. In general, no argument\nsatisfying this template together with a given evidence will be\ntransmissive of first-time justification based on that evidence.  \nOne may wonder whether a deductive argument from p to q\ninstantiating the information-dependence template will be\nunable to transmit additional justification for q. The\nanswer seems to be affirmative when the additional justification is\nindependent justification. Suppose the\ninformation-dependence template is instantiated such that\ns’s justification for p from e depends on\ns’s independent justification for q. Note that s\nacquires additional independent justification for q only if (i)\ne gives her justification for p, (ii) s knows\nthat p entails q, and (iii-ai) s acquires an\nadditional independent justification in virtue of (i) and (ii). This\nadditional justification is independent of s’s antecedent\njustification for q only if, in particular, condition (3) of\nthe characterisation of additional independent justification is\nsatisfied. (3) says that if s had not been antecedently\njustified in believing q, upon learning e, s\nwould have acquired via transmission a first-time justification for\nbelieving q. (3) entails that if q were not antecedently\njustified for s, e would still justify p for\ns. Hence, the satisfaction of (3) is incompatible with the\ninstantiation of the information-dependence template, which\nentails that if s had not antecedent justification for\nq, e would not justify p for s. The\ninstantiation of the information-dependence template then\nprecludes the transmission of independent justification. \nAs suggested by Wright (2007, 36) the instantiation of the\ninformation-dependence template might also appear sufficient for an\nargument’s inability to transmit additional quantitatively\nstrengthening justification. This claim might appear intuitively\nplausible: perhaps it is reasonable to expect that, if the\njustification from e for p depends on independent\njustification for another proposition q, the strength of the\njustification available for q sets an upper bound to the\nstrength of the justification possibly supplied by e for\np. However, the examples by Wright (2011) and Moretti &\nPiazza (2013) mentioned in Sect. 2 appear to undermine this\nsuggestion. For they involve arguments that instantiate the\ninformation-dependent template yet seem to transmit quantitatively\nstrengthening justification to their conclusions.  \nSome authors have attempted Bayesian formalisations of the\ninformation dependence template (see the supplement on\n Bayesian Formalisations of the Information-Dependence Template.)\n Furthermore, Coliva (2012) has proposed a variant of the same\ntemplate. In accordance with the information-dependence\ntemplate, s’s justification from e for p\nfails to transmit to p’s consequence q whenever\ns’s possessing that justification for p requires\ns’s independent justification for q. According to\nColiva’s variant, s’s justification from e for\np fails to transmit to q whenever s’s possessing\nthe latter justification for p requires s’s independent\nassumption of q, whether this assumption is justified\nor not. Pryor (2012, § VII) can be read as pressing\nobjections against Coliva’s template, which are addressed in\nColiva (2012).  \nSo far we have seen that non-transmissivity may depend on\npremise-circularity or on reliance on collateral information. There is\nat least a third possibility: an argument can be non-transmissive of\nthe justification for its premise(s) based on given evidence because\nthat evidence justifies directly the conclusion—i.e.,\nindependently of the argument itself (cf. Davies 2009). In\nthis case the argument instantiates indirectness, for\ns’s going through the argument would result in nothing but an\nindirect (and unneeded) detour for justifying its conclusion. If\ne directly justifies q, no part of the justification for\nq is based on, among other things, s’s knowledge of the\ninferential relation between p and q. So (iii+) is\nunfulfilled whether or not (i) and (ii) are fulfilled. Here is an\nexample from Wright (2002):  \n(Soccer)\n\nE6. Jones has just kicked the ball between the white posts.\n\nP6. Jones has just scored a goal.\n\nTherefore:\n\nQ6. A game of soccer is taking place. \nSuppose s learns evidence E6. On ordinary background\ninformation (i) E6 justifies P6 for s,\n(ii) s knows that P6 entails Q6, and\nE6 also justifies Q6 for s. It seems\nfalse, however, that Q6 is justified for s in\nvirtue of the satisfaction of (i) and (ii). Quite the reverse,\nQ6 seems justified for s by E6\nindependently the satisfaction of (i) and (ii). This is so because in\nthe (imagined) actual scenario it seems true that s would still\npossess a justification for Q6 based on E6 even\nif E6 did not justify P6 for s.\nSuppose in fact s had noticed that the referee’s assistant\nraised her flag to signal Jones’s off-side. Against this altered\nbackground information, E6 would no longer justify\nP6 for s but it would still justify Q6\nfor s. Thus Soccer is non-transmissive of the\njustification depending on E6. In general, no argument\ninstantiating indirectness in relation to some evidence will\nbe transmissive of justification based on that evidence. \nThe information-dependence template and indirectness\nare diagnostics for a deductive argument’s inability to transmit the\njustification for its premise(s) p based on evidence e\nto its conclusion q, where e is conceived of as a\nbelieved proposition capable of supplying\ninferential and (typically) fallible justification\nfor p. (Note that even though e is conceived of as a\nbelief, the collateral information i, which is part of the\ntemplate, doesn’t need to be believed on some views.) The\njustification for a proposition p might come in further forms.\nFor instance, it has been proposed that a proposition p about\nthe perceivable environment around the subject s can be\njustified by the fact that s sees that p. In this\ncase, s is claimed to attain a kind of non-inferential\nand infallible justification for believing p. The latter\nview has been explored by epistemological disjunctivists (see\nfor instance McDowell 1982, 1994 and 2008, and Pritchard 2007, 2008,\n2009, 2011 and 2012).  \nOne might find it intuitively plausible that when s sees that\np, s attains non-inferential and infallible\njustification for believing p that doesn’t rely on s’s\nbackground information. Since this justification for believing\np would be a fortiori unconstrained by s’s\nindependent justification for believing any consequence q of\np, in these cases the information-dependence template could not\npossibly be instantiated. Therefore, one might be tempted to conclude\nthat when s sees that p, s acquires a\njustification that typically transmits to the propositions that\ns knows to be deducible from p (cf. Wright 2002).\nPritchard (2009 and 2012) comes very close to endorsing this view\nexplicitly.  \nThe latter contention has not stayed unchallenged. Suppose one accepts\na notion of epistemic justification with internalist resonances\nsaying that a factor J is relevant to s’s epistemic\njustification only if s is able to determine, by reflection\nalone, whether J is or is not realised. On this notion, s’s\nseeing that p cannot provide s with justification for\nbelieving p unless s can rationally claim that she is\nseeing that p upon reflection alone. Seeing that p,\nhowever, is subjectively indistinguishable from hallucinating\nthat p, or from being in some other delusional state in which\nit merely seems to s that she is seeing that p.\nFor this reason, one may find it compelling that s can claim by\nreflection alone that she’s seeing that p only if s has\nan independent reason for ruling out that it merely seems to her that\nshe does (cf. mainly Wright 2011). If this is true, for many deductive\narguments from p to q, s will be unable to\nacquire non-inferential and infallible justification for believing\np of the type described by the disjunctivist and capable of\ntransmitting to q. In particular, this will happen whenever\nq is the logical negation of a proposition ascribing to\ns some delusionary mental state in which it merely seems to her\nthat she is directly perceiving that p.  \nWright’s disjunctive template is meant to be a diagnostic of\nfailure of transmission of non-inferential justification when\nepistemic justification is conceived of in the internalist fashion\nsuggested\n above.[6]\n According to Wright (2000), for any propositions p, q\nand r and subject s, the disjunctive template is\ninstantiated whenever:  \n(a) p entails q;\n\n(b) s’s justification for p consists in s’s being\nin a state subjectively indistinguishable from a state in which\nr would be true;\n\n(c) r is incompatible with p;\n\n(d) r would be true if q were false.  \nTo see how this template might apply, consider again the following\ntriad: \n(Zebra)\n\nE3. The animals in the pen look like zebras.\n\nP3. The animals in the pen are zebras.\n\nTherefore:\n\nQ3. The animals in the pen are not mules cleverly disguised\nso as to look like zebras.\n \nThe justification from E3 for P3 arguably fails\nto transmit across the inference from P3 to Q3\nbecause of the satisfaction of the information-dependence\ntemplate. For it seems true that s could acquire a\njustification for believing P3 on the basis of\nE3 only if s had an independent justification for\nbelieving Q3. But suppose that s’s justification for\nbelieving P3 is based not on E3 but on\ns’s seeing that P3. Let’s call Zebra*\nthe corresponding variant of Zebra. Given the\nnon-inferential nature of the justification considered for\nP3, Zebra* could not instantiate the\ninformation-dependence template. However, it is easy to check\nthat Zebra* instantiates the disjunctive template. To\nbegin with, (a) P3 entails Q3; (b) s’s\njustification for believing P3 is constituted by s’s\nseeing that P3, which is subjectively indistinguishable\nfrom the state that s would be in if it were true that (R) the\nanimals in the pen are mules cleverly disguised so as to look like\nzebras; (c) R is incompatible with P3; and, trivially, (d)\nif Q3 were false R would be true.  \nSince Zebra* instantiates the disjunctive template, it\nis non-transmissive of at least first-time justification. In\nfact note that s acquires first-time justification for\nQ3 in this case if and only if (i) s has\njustification for P3 based on seeing that P3,\n(ii) s knows that P3 entails Q3, and\n(iii-ft) s acquires first-time justification for believing\nQ3 in virtue of (i) and (ii). Also note that (iii-ft)\nrequires s’s justification for believing Q3not to be independent of s’s justification for\nP3 based on seeing that P3. However, if (i) is\ntrue, the disjunctive template requires s to have\njustification for believing Q3independent of\ns’s justification for P3 based on her seeing that\nP3. (For if s could not independently exclude that\nQ3 is false, given (d), (c) and (b), s could not\nexclude that the incompatible alternative R to P3, which\ns cannot subjectively distinguish from P3 on the\nground of her seeing that P3, is true.) Thus, when the\ndisjunctive template is instantiated, (i) and (iii-ft) cannot\nbe satisfied at once.  \nThe disjunctive template has been criticised by McLaughlin (2003) on\nthe ground that the template is instantiated whenever the\njustification for p is fallible, i.e. compatible with\np’s falsity. Here is an example from Brown (2004).\nConsider the following deductive argument: \n(Fox)\n\nP7. The animal in the garbage is a fox.\n\nTherefore:\n\nQ7. The animal in the garbage is not a cat. \nSuppose s has a fallible justification for believing\nP7 based on s’s experience as if the animal\nin the garbage is a fox. Take now R to be P7’s logical\nnegation. Since the justification that s has for P7\nis fallible, condition (b) above is met by default. As one can\neasily check, conditions (a), (c) and (d) are also met. So Fox\ninstantiates the disjunctive template. Yet it is intuitive that\nFox does transmit justification to its conclusion.  \nOne could simply respond to McLaughlin that his argument is misplaced\nbecause the disjunctive template was only meant to apply to\ninfallible and not fallible justification. A more useful\nresponse to McLaughlin is however to refine the conditions listed in\nthe disjunctive template so as to block McLaughlin’s argument\nwhile letting this template account for transmission failure of both\nfallible and infallible justification. Wright (2011) for instance\nsuggests replacing (c) with the following\n condition:[7] \n(c*) r is incompatible (not necessarily with p but) with\nsome presupposition of the cognitive project of obtaining a\njustification for p in the relevant fashion. \nAccording to Wright’s (2011) characterisation, a presupposition of a\ncognitive project is any condition such that doubting it before\ncarrying out the project would rationally commit one to doubting the\nsignificance or competence of the project irrespective of its outcome.\nFor a wide class of cognitive projects examples of these\npresuppositions include: normal and proper functioning of the relevant\ncognitive faculties, the reliability of utilised instruments, the\nobtaining of the circumstances congenial to the proposed method of\ninvestigation, the soundness of relevant principles of inference\nutilised in developing and collating one’s results, and so on.  \nWith (c*) in the place of (c), Fox no longer instantiates the\ndisjunctive template. For the truth of R—the proposition\nthat the animal in the garbage is not a fox—appears to\njeopardize no presupposition of the cognitive project of obtaining a\nperceptual justification for P7. Thus (c*) is not\nfulfilled. On the other hand, arguments that intuitively do not\ntransmit do satisfy (c*). Take again Zebra*. In that case R is\nthe proposition that the animals in the pen are mules cleverly\ndisguised so as to look like zebras. Since R entails that conditions\nare unsuitable for attaining perceptual justification for believing\nP3, R looks incompatible with a presupposition of the\ncognitive project of obtaining perceptual justification for\nP3. Thus R does satisfy (c*) in this case.  \nIn order to illuminate philosophical puzzles (e.g., McKinsey Paradox\nillustrated below in Sect. 5.2) Davies has proposed other\nconditions—which he calls limiting principles—whose\nsatisfaction would prevent an argument from possibly transmitting\njustification. Some of these principles will be discussed in Sect. 5.1\nand Sect. 5.2. Further conditions are considered in Pryor (2012). \nTo conclude this section we outline an explanation of epistemic\ntransmission failure delivered by Smith\n (2009),[8]\n which is very different from all those considered so far. According\nto Smith, epistemic justification requires reliability. A\nsubject s’s belief that p, held on the basis of\ns’s belief that e, is reliable in the sense defined by\nSmith if and only if in all possible worlds including e as true\nand that are as normal (from the perspective of the actual\nworld) as the truth of e permits, p is also true.\nConsider Zebra again. s’s belief that P3\n— that the animals in the pen are zebras —\nproves reliable in Smith’s sense when it is based on s’s belief\nthat E3 — that the animals in the pen look\nlike zebras. (Disguising mules so as to make them look like zebras is\nafter all an abnormal practice.) Thus, all possible\nE3-worlds that are as normal as the truth of E3\npermits are not worlds in which the animals in the pen are cleverly\ndisguised mules. Rather, they are\nP3-worlds—that is to say, worlds in which the\nanimals in the pen are zebras. \nSmith distinguishes between two ways in which a belief can come to\npossess this property of being reliable. One possibility is that a\nbelief that p possesses it in virtue of the modal relationship\nwith its basis e. In this case, e is a contributing\nreliable basis. Another possibility is when it is the content of the\nbelief that p, rather than the belief’s modal relationship with\nits basis e, that guarantees by itself the belief’s\nreliability. In this case, e is a non-contributing reliable\nbasis. An example of the first kind is s’s belief that\nP3, which is reliable because of its modal relationship\nwith E3. There are obviously many sufficiently normal\nworlds in which P3 is false, but no sufficiently normal\nworld in which P3 is false and E3 true. An\nexample of the second kind is s’s belief that Q3 as\nbased on E3. It is this belief’s content, and not its modal\nrelationship with E3, that guarantees its reliability. As\nSmith puts it, there are no sufficiently normal worlds in which\nE3 is true and Q3 is false, but this is simply\nbecause there are no sufficiently normal worlds in which Q3\nis false. \nAccording to Smith, roughly, a deductive inference from p to\nq fails to transmit to q justification relative to\np’s basis e, if e is a contributing reliable\nbasis for believing p but is a non-contributing reliable basis\nfor believing q. In this case the inference fails to\nexplain q’s reliability: if s deduced one\nproposition from another, she would reliably believe that q,\nbut not — not even in part — in virtue of\nhaving inferred this proposition from p (as held on the basis\nof e). Zebra fails to transmit to Q3\njustification relative to P3’s basis E3 in this\nprecise sense. (Smith 2009 also includes an account of failure of\ntransmission of knowledge across valid inference criticized by\nTucker 2012. A discussion of this account is beyond the aims of this\nentry.) \nLet us say that a subject s doubts q just in case\ns either disbelieves or withholds belief about\nq, namely refrains from both believing and disbelieving\nq after deciding about q. s’s doubting\nq should be distinguished from s’s being open\nminded about q and from s’s having no\ndoxastic attitude whatsoever towards q (cf. Tucker 2010a). Let\nus say that a deductively valid argument from p to q has\nthe power to resolve doubt about its conclusion just in case it is\npossible for s to be rationally moved from doubting q to\nbelieving q solely in virtue of grasping the argument from\np to q and the evidence offered for p. \nThere is today wide agreement in the literature that the property of\nbeing a transmissive argument does not coincide with the property of\nbeing an argument capable of resolving doubt about its conclusion (see\nfor example, Beebee 2001, Coliva 2010, Markie 2005, Pryor 2004,\nBergmann 2004 and 2006, White 2006, Silins 2005 and Tucker 2010a). A\nreason for thinking so is that whereas the property of being\ntransmissive appears to be a genuinely epistemic property of an\nargument, the one of resolving doubt seems to be only a\ndialectical feature of it, which varies with the audience whose\ndoubt the argument is used to address. \nIn spite of these considerations, a few authors (e.g., Davies 1998,\nand 2003a, 2004, and 2009, McLaughlin 2000 and Wright 2002, 2003, and\n2007) have insisted that we should conceive of epistemic\ntransmissivity in a way that proves very closely related or even\nidentical to the capability of resolving doubt. Whereas some of these\nauthors have eventually conceded that epistemic transmissivity cannot\nbe defined as capability of resolving doubt (e.g., Wright 2011),\nothers have attempted to articulate their views in full (see mostly\nDavies 2003a, 2004 and 2009). Suppose one wants to claim that an\nargument is transmissive when it is at the service of resolving a\nsubject’s doubt about the conclusion. One possible way to go\n— which parallels Jackson’s (1987, §6)  analysis of\nwhen an argument begs the hearer’s question — is this. An\nargument could be considered to be non-transmissive when the fact that\nthe subject doubts (or suppositionally\n doubts)[9]\n its conclusion, in her own thought, rationally requires the subject\nto adopt new background assumptions on which the premises are no\nlonger justified by the relevant evidence (cf. Davies 2003a, 2004 and\n2009. For a critical discussion of Davies’ project see Coliva 2010).\nAs we will see below, it can be argued that Moore’s proof and the\ninference central to McKinsey paradox are non-transmissive in this\nsense. \nThe notions of transmissive and non-transmissive argument, above and\nbeyond being investigated for their own sake, have been put to work in\nrelation to specific philosophical problems and issues. An important\nproblem is whether Moore’s infamous proof of a material world and\nsimilar Moorean responses to the skeptic are successful. Another issue\npertains to the solution of McKinsey paradox. A third issue concerns\nBoghossian’s (2001 and 2003) explanation of our logical knowledge via\nimplicit definitions, criticised as resting on a non-transmissive\nargument schema (see for instance Ebert 2005 and Jenkins 2008). As the\ndebate focusing on the last topic is only at an early stage of its\ndevelopment, it is preferable to concentrate on the first two, which\nwill be reviewed in respectively Sect. 5.1 and Sect. 5.2 below. \nMuch of the contemporary debate on Moore’s proof of a material world\n(see Moore 1939) is interwoven with the topic of epistemic\ntransmission and its failure. Moore’s proof can be reconstructed as\nfollows: \n(Moore)\n\nE8. My experience is in all respects as of a hand held up\nin front of my face.\n\nP8. Here is a hand.\n\nTherefore:\n\nQ8. There is a material world (since any hand is a material\nobject existing in space).  \nThe evidence E8 in Moore is constituted by a\nproposition believed by s. One might suggest, however,\nthat this is a misinterpretation of Moore’s proof (and the variants of\nit that we shall consider shortly). One might argue, in other words,\nthat what is meant to give s justification for believing\nP8 is s’s experience of a hand. Nevertheless,\nmost of the epistemologists taking part in this debate implicitly or\nexplicitly assume that one’s experience as if p and one’s\nbelief that one has an experience as if p have the same\njustifying power (cf. White 2006 and Silins 2007). \nMany philosophers find Moore’s proof unsuccessful. Philosophers have\nput forward explanations of this impression according to which\nMoore is non-transmissive in some of the senses described in\nSect. 3 (see mainly Wright 1985, 2002, 2007 and 2011) or\nnon-transmissive in the non-standard sense that it is incapable of\nresolving doubt about its conclusion (see mainly Davies 1998, 2000,\n2003a, 2003b, 2004 and 2009). A different explanation is that Moore’s\nproof does transmit justification but is dialectically ineffective\n(see mainly Pryor 2004).  \nAccording to Wright there exist cornerstone\npropositions—or simply cornerstones—for\ndifferent areas of discourse. In accordance with Wright’s\ncharacterization of it, c is a cornerstone for an area of\ndiscourse d just in case for any proposition p belonging\nto d, p could not be justified for any subject s\nif s had no independent justification for accepting c\n(see mostly Wright\n 2004).[10]\n Cornerstones for the area of discourse about perceivable things are\nfor instance the logical negations of skeptical\nconjectures, such as the proposition that one’s experiences are\nnothing but one’s hallucinations caused by a Cartesian demon or the\nMatrix. Wright contends that the conclusion Q8 of\nMoore is also a cornerstone for the area of discourse about\nperceivable things. Adapting terminology introduced by Pryor (2004),\nWright’s conception of the architecture of perceptual justification\nthus treats Q8conservatively with respect to any\nperceptual hypothesis p: if s had no independent\njustification for Q8, no proposition e describing an\napparent perception could supply s with prima facie\njustification for any perceptual hypothesis p. It follows from\nthis that Moore instantiates the information-dependence\ntemplate considered in Sect. 3.2. For Q8 is part of the\ncollateral information which s needs independent justification\nfor if s is to receive some justification for P8\nfrom E8. Hence Moore is non-transmissive. (See\nmainly Wright 2002.) Note that the thesis that Moore’s proof is\nepistemologically useless because non-transmissive in the sense\nexplained is compatible with the claim that by learning E8,\nin Moore,s does acquire a justification for believing\nP8. For instance, Wright (2004) contends that we all have a\nspecial kind of non-evidential justification, which he calls\nentitlement, for accepting Q8 as well as other\ncornerstones in\n general.[11]\n Thus by learning E8 we do acquire justification for\nP8. Wright’s analysis of Moore’s proof and Wright’s\nconservatism have mostly been criticized in conjunction with his\ntheory of entitlement. A presentation of these objections is beyond\nthe scope of this entry. (See however Davies 2004, Pritchard 2005 and\nJenkins 2007. For a defense of Wright’s views see for instance Neta\n2007.)  \nAs anticipated, other philosophers contend that Moore’s proof does\ntransmit justification and that its ineffectiveness has a different\nexplanation. An important conception of the architecture of perceptual\njustification, called dogmatism in Pryor (2000 and 2004),\nembraces a generalised form of liberalism about perceptual\njustification. This form of liberalism is opposed to Wright’s\nconservatism, and claims that in order to have prima facie\nperceptual justification for believing p from an apparent\nperception that p, s doesn’t need independent\njustification for believing the negation of skeptical conjectures or\nof other non-perceiving hypotheses like Not-Q8. This is so,\nfor the dogmatist, because our experiences give us immediate\nand prima facie justification for believing their contents.\nSaying that our perceptual justification is immediate is saying that\nit does not presuppose—not even in part—justification for\nanything else. Saying that our justification is prima facie is saying\nthat it can be defeated by additional evidence. Our perceptual\njustification would be defeated, for example, by evidence that a\nrelevant non-perceiving hypothesis is true or just as probable as its\nnegation. For instance, s’s perceptual justification for\nbelieving P8 in Moore’s proof would be defeated by evidence\nthat Not-Q8 is true, or evidence that Q8 and\nNot-Q8 are equally probable. On this point the dogmatist\nand Wright do agree. They disagree on whether s’s perceptual\njustification for P8 requires independent justification for\nbelieving or accepting Q8. The dogmatist denies that\ns needs that independent justification. Thus, according to the\ndogmatist, Moore’s proof transmits the perceptual justification\navailable for its premise to its\n conclusion.[12] \nThe dogmatist argues (or may argue), however, that Moore’s proof is\ndialectically flawed (cf. Pryor 2004). The contention is that\nMoore’s is unsuccessful because it is useless for the purpose to\nconvince the idealist or the external world sceptic that there is a\nmaterial world. In short, the idealist and the global sceptic don’t\nbelieve that there is a material world. Since the idealist and the\nsceptic don’t believe Q8, they are rationally required to\ndistrust any perceptual evidence offered in favor of\nP8 in the first instance. For this reason they both will\nreject Moore’s proof as one based on an unjustified\n premise.[13]\n Moretti (2014) suggests that the dogmatist could alternatively\ncontend that Moore’s proof is non-transmissive because s’s\nexperience of a hand gives s immediate justification for\nbelieving the conclusion Q8 of the proof. According\nto this diagnosis, Moore’s proof is epistemically flawed because\nit instantiates a variant of indirectness in which the evidence\nis an experience of a hand. Pryor’s analysis of Moore’s proof\nhas principally been criticised in conjunction with his liberalism in\nepistemology of perception. (See Cohen 2002 and 2005, Schiffer 2004\nWright 2007, White 2006, and Siegel and Silins 2015.)  \nSome authors (e.g., Wright 2003, Pryor 2004, White 2006, Silins 2007,\nNeta 2010) have investigated whether certain variants of Moore\nare transmissive of justification. These arguments start from a\npremise like P8, describing a (supposed) perceivable state\nof affairs of the external world, and deduce from it the logical\nnegation of a relevant skeptical conjecture. Consider for\nexample the variant of Moore that starts from P8 and\nreplaces Q8 with: \nQ8*. It is not the case that I am a handless brain in a vat\nfed with the hallucination of a hand held up in front of my face. \nLet’s call Moore* this variant of Moore. While\ndogmatists à la Pryor argue (or may argue) that\nMoore* is transmissive but dialectically flawed (cf. Pryor\n2004), conservatives à la Wright contend (or may\ncontend) that it is non-transmissive (cf. Wright 2007). Although it\nremains very controversial whether or not Moore is\ntransmissive, epistemologists have found some prima facie\nreason to think that arguments like Moore* are\nnon-transmissive. \nAn important difference between Moore and Moore* is\nthis: whereas the logical negation of Q8 does not\nexplain the evidential statement E8 (“My\nexperience is in all respects as of a hand held up in front of my\nface”) adduced in support of P8, the logical negation\nof Q8* — i.e., Not-Q8*\n— explains E8 to some extent.\nAccordingly, since Not-Q8* provides a potential explanation\nof E8, is it intuitive that E8 is\nevidence (perhaps very week evidence) for believing\nNot-Q8*. It is easy to conclude from this that s\ncannot acquire justification for believing Q8* via\ntransmission through Moore* upon learning E8. For it\nis intuitive that if this were the case, E8 should count as\nevidence for Q8*. But this is impossible: one and the same\nproposition cannot simultaneously be evidence for a hypothesis and its\nlogical negation. By formalizing intuitions of this type, White (2006)\nhas put forward a simple Bayesian argument to the effect that\nMoore* and similar variants of Moore are not\ntransmissive of\n justification.[14]\n (See Silins 2007 for discussion. For responses to White, see for\ninstance Weatherson 2007, Kung 2010 and Moretti 2015).  \nFrom the above analysis it is easy to conclude that the\ninformation-dependence template is satisfied by Moore*\nand akin proofs. In fact note that if E8 is evidence for\nboth P8 and Not-Q8*, it seems correct to say\nthat s can acquire a justification for believing P8\nonly if s has independent justification for disbelieving\nNot-Q8* and thus believing Q8*. Since\nNot-Q8* counts as a non-perceiving hypothesis for\nPryor, this gives us a reason to doubt dogmatism (cf. White\n 2006).[15] \nColiva (2005 and 2012) defends a view — baptized by her\nmoderatism — that aims to be a middle way between\nWright’s conservatism and Pryor’s dogmatism. On the one hand, the\nmoderate contends — against the conservative\n— that cornerstones cannot be justified and that in order\nto possess perceptual justification s needs no justification\nfor accepting any cornerstones. On the other hand, the moderate claims\n— against the dogmatist — that to possess\nperceptual justification s needs to assume (without\njustification) relevant\n cornerstones.[16]\n By relying on her variant of the information-dependent template\ndescribed in Sect. 3.2, Coliva concludes that neither Moore\nnor any proof like Moore* is transmissive. (For a critical\ndiscussion of moderatism see for instance Avnur 2017, Baghramian 2017,\nMillar 2017, Volpe 2017, and Coliva 2017.)  \nEpistemological disjunctivists like McDowell and Pritchard have argued\nthat in paradigmatic cases of perceptual knowledge, what is meant to\ngive s justification for believing P8 is, not\nE8, but s’s factive state of seeing that\nP8. This — it might be contended\n— is not without consequences with respect to the\nquestion whether Moore* transmits propositional justification.\nPritchard explicitly defends the claim that when s sees that\nP8, thereby learning that P8, s can come\nto know by inference from P8 the negation of any sceptical\nhypothesis inconsistent with P8, like Q8* (cf.\nPritchard 2012, 129–30). This might encourage the belief that, for\nPritchard, the inference in Moore* can transmit the\njustification for P8 based on s’s seeing that\nP8 across the entailment from P8 to\nQ8* (see Lockhart 2018 for an explicit\nargument to this effect). The latter claim must however be handled\nwith some care. \nAs we have seen in Sect. 2, Pritchard contends that when one knows\np on the basis of evidence e, one can know p’s\nconsequence q by inference from p only if e\nsufficiently supports q. For Pritchard this condition is met\nwhen s’s support for believing P8 is constituted by\ns’s seeing that P8, s’s epistemic situation\nis objectively good (i.e., s’s cognitive faculties are working\nproperly in a cooperative environment) and the skeptical hypothesis\nruled out by Q8* has not been epistemically motivated. For,\nin this case, s has a reflectively accessible factive\nsupport for believing P8 that entails —\nand so sufficiently supports — Q8*. Thus, in\nthis case nothing stands in the way of s competently deducing\nQ8* from P8, thereby coming to know\nQ8* on the basis of P8.  \nIf upon deducing one proposition from another, s comes\nto justifiably believe Q8* for the first-time, the\ninference from P8 to Q8* arguably transmits\ndoxastic justification. (See the supplement on\n Transmission of Propositional Justification versus Transmission of Doxastic Justification.)\n It is more dubious, however, that when s’s support for\nP8 is constituted by s’s seeing that P8,\nMoore* is also transmissive of propositional\njustification. For instance, one might contend that Moore* is\nnon-transmissive because it instantiates the disjunctive\ntemplate described in Sect. 3.2 (cf. Wright 2002). To start with,\nP8 entails Q8*, so (a) is satisfied. Let R* be\nthe proposition that this is no hand but s is victim of a\nhallucination of a hand held up before her face. Since R* would be\ntrue if Q8* were false, (d) is also satisfied. Furthermore,\ntake the grounds of s’s justification for P8 to be\ns’s seeing that P8. Since this experience is a state\nfor s indistinguishable from one in which R* is true, condition\n(b) is also satisfied. Finally, it might be argued that the\nproposition that one is not hallucinating is a presupposition of the\ncognitive project of learning about one’s environment through\nperception. It follows that R* is incompatible with a presupposition\nof s’s cognitive project of learning about one’s environment\nthrough perception. Thus (c*) appears to be fulfilled too. So\nMoore* will not transmit the justification that s\npossesses for P8 to Q8*.  \nTo resist the this conclusion, a disjunctivist might insist that\nMoore*, relative to s’s support for P8\nsupplied by s’s seeing that P8, does not always\ninstantiate the disjunctive template, in particular because\ncondition (b) is not necessarily fulfilled (cf. Lockhart 2018.) By\nappealing to a distinction drawn by Pritchard (2012), one might\ncontend that (b) is not necessarily fulfilled, because s,\nthough unable to perceptually discriminate between seeing that\nP8 and merely hallucinating it, may have evidence that\nfavors the hypothesis that she is in the first state.  For Pritchard,\nthis happens — as we have seen — when s sees that\nP8 in good epistemic conditions and the skeptical\nconjecture that s is having a hallucination of a hand has not\nbeen epistemically motivated. In this case, s is in position to\ncome to know Q8* by inference from P8 even if\nshe is unable to perceptually discriminate one situation from the\nother.  \nPritchard’s thesis that, in good epistemic conditions, s’s\nfactive support for believing P8 coinciding with s’s\nseeing that P8 is reflectively accessible is open to\ncontroversy (cf. Piazza 2016 and Lockhart 2018). Since\nthis thesis is essential to the contention that Moore* may not\ninstantiate the disjunctive template and may thus be\ntransmissive of propositional justification, the latter contention is\nalso open to controversy.  \nOne could explain the ineffectiveness of Moore and similar\nproofs in a specific way that differs from any of the diagnoses\ndescribed so far. This new account diagnoses Moorean proofs with being\nnon-transmissive in the precise sense (discussed Sect. 4) of being\nincapable of resolving doubt about their conclusions.  \nDiagnoses of non-transmissivity as incapability of resolving doubt can\nbe systematised by appealing to limitation\nprinciples—i.e., principles that restrain justification\ntransmission. For instance, a limitation principle that seems to\nexplain why Moore is non-transmissive as incapable of resolving\ndoubt about its conclusion has been proposed by Davies (2009) and it\nreads roughly as\n follows:[17] \nThe antecedent of (LP) would seem to be satisfied by E8,\nP8 and Q8. Suppose s doubted (in her\nthought) Q8. This alone would rationally commit s to\ndoubting that E8 actually justifies P8. Thus\nMoore turns out to be non-transmissive when (LP) is in place.\n(Mutatis mutandis, the same explanation applies to\nMoore* too.)  \nInterestingly enough, any argument satisfying the\ninformation-dependence template also satisfies the antecedent\nof (LP). Suppose the justification from e for the premise(s)\np of a known deductively valid argument concluding in q\nis conditional on independent justification for q. This implies\nthat any subject examining the argument who had a doubt about q\nwould be rationally required to accept a defeater for the\njustification for p based on e. Hence non-transmissivity\nas incapability of satisfying (iii+) engendered by reliance on\ncollateral information entails non-transmissivity as incapability of\nresolving doubt. \nMcKinsey (1991, 2002, 2003 and 2007) has offered a reductio argument\nfor the incompatibility of first-person privileged access to mental\ncontent and externalism about mental content. The privileged access\nthesis roughly says that it is necessarily true that if a subject\ns is thinking that x, then s can in principle\nknow a priori (or in a non-empirical way) that she herself is thinking\nthat x. Externalism about mental content roughly says that\npredicates of the form ‘is thinking that\nx’—e.g., ‘is thinking that water is\nwet’—express properties that are wide, in the\nsense that possession of these properties by s logically or\nconceptually implies the existence of relevant contingent objects\nexternal to s’s mind—e.g., water. McKinsey argues that\ns may reason along these lines: \n(Water)\n\nP9. I am thinking that water is wet.\n\nP10. If I am thinking that water is wet then I have (or my\nlinguistic community has) been embedded in an environment that\ncontains water.\n\nTherefore:\n\nQ9. I have (or my linguistic community has) been embedded\nin an environment that contains water.  \nWater produces an absurdity. If the privileged access thesis\nis true, s knows P9non-empirically. If\nsemantic externalism is true, s knows P10a\npriori by mere conceptual analysis. Since P9 and\nP10 do entail Q9 and knowledge is presumably\nclosed under known entailment, s knows\nQ9—which is an empirical\nproposition—by simply competently deducing it from P9\nand P10 and without conducting any empirical\ninvestigation. As this is absurd, McKinsey concludes that the\nprivileged access thesis or semantic externalism must be false. \nOne way to resist McKinsey’s incompatibilist conclusion that\nthe privileged access thesis and externalism about mental content\ncannot be true together is to argue that Water is\nnon-transmissive. Since knowledge is presumably closed under known\nentailment, it remains true that s cannot know P9\nand P10 while failing to know Q9. However,\nMcKinsey paradox originates from the stronger\nconclusion—motivated by the claim that Water is a\ndeductively valid argument featuring premises knowable\nnon-empirically—that s, by running Water, could\ncome to know non-empirically the empirical proposition\nQ9 that she or members of her community have had contact\nwith water. This is precisely what could not happen if Water\nis non-transmissive: in this case s could not learn\nQ9 on the basis of her non-empirical justification for\nP9 and P10, and her knowledge of the entailment\nbetween P9, P10 and Q9 (see mainly\nWright 2000, 2003 and 2011, and Davies 1998, 2000, 2003a, 2003b and\n2009). \nA first possibility to defend the thesis that Water is\nnon-transmissive is to argue that Water instantiates the\ndisjunctive template (considered in Sect. 3.2) (cf. Wright\n2000, 2003 and 2011). If Water is non-transmissive, s\ncould acquire a justification for, or knowledge of, P9 and\nP10 only if s were in possession of an\nindependent justification for, or knowledge of,\nQ9. (And to avoid the absurd result that McKinsey recoils\nfrom, this independent justification for Q9 should\npresumably be empirical.) If this diagnosis is correct, one need not\ndeny P9 or P10 to block the intuitively false\nconsequence that s could acquire knowledge of the empirical\nproposition Q9 in virtue of only non-empirical\nknowledge. \nTo substantiate the thesis that Water instantiates the\ndisjunctive template one should first emphasise that the kind\nof externalism about mental content underlying P10 in\nWater is compatible with the possibility that s\nsuffers from illusion of content. Were this to happen with\nP9 in Water, s would seem to introspect that\nshe believes that water is wet whereas there is nothing like that\ncontent to be believed by s in the first instance.\nConsider: \nR. ‘water’ refers to no natural kind so that\nthere is no content expressed by the sentence ‘water is\nwet’. \ns’s state of having introspective justification for believing\nP9 is arguably subjectively indistinguishable from a\nsituation in which R is true. Thus condition (b) of the disjunctive\ntemplate is met. Moreover, R appears incompatible with an obvious\npresupposition of s’s cognitive project of attaining\nintrospective justification for believing P9, at least if\nthe content that water is wet embedded in P9 is constrained\nby s or her linguistic community having being in contact with\nwater. Thus condition (c*) is also met. Furthermore, P9\nentails Q9 (when P10 is in background\ninformation). Hence condition (a) is fulfilled. If we could also show\nthat (d) is satisfied in Water, in the sense that if\nQ9 were false R would be true, we would have shown that the\ndisjunctive template is satisfied by Water. Wright\n(2000), for instance, takes (d) to be actually fulfilled and concludes\nthat the disjunctive template is satisfied by\nWater. \nUnfortunately, the claim that (d) is satisfied in Water cannot\neasily be vindicated (cf. Wright 2003). Condition (d) is satisfied in\nWater only if it is true that if s (or s’s\nlinguistic community) had not been embedded in an environment that\ncontains water, the term ‘water’ would have\nreferred to no natural kind. This is true only if the closest possible\nworld w in which this counterfactual’s antecedent is true is\nlike Boghossian’s (1997) Dry Earth—namely, a world\nwhere no one has ever had any contact with any kind of watery stuff,\nand all apparent contacts with it are always due to multi-sensory\nhallucination. If w is not Dry Earth, but Putnam’s\nTwin Earth, however, the counterfactual turns out to be\nfalse, as in this possible world people usually have contact with some\nother watery stuff that they call ‘water’. So, in this\nworld ‘water’ refers to a natural kind, though not to one\nhaving chemical composition H2O. Since\ndetermining which of Dry Earth or Twin Earth is\nmodally closer to the actual world (supposing s is in the\nactual world)—and so determining whether (d) is satisfied in\nWater—is a potentially elusive task, the claim that\nWater instantiates the disjunctive template appears\nto be less than fully warranted.\n [18] \nAn alternative dissolution of McKinsey paradox—also based on a\ndiagnosis of non-transmissivity—seems however to be available if\none considers the proposition (Q10) saying that s\n(or s’s linguistic community) has been embedded in an\nenvironment containing some watery substance (cf. Wright 2003\nand 2011). This alternative strategy assumes that Q10,\nrather than Q9, is a presupposition of s’s cognitive\nproject of attaining introspective justification for P9.\n \nEven if Water does not instantiate the disjunctive\ntemplate, a new diagnosis of what’s wrong with McKinsey paradox\ncould rest on the claim that the different argument yielded by\nexpanding Water with Q10 as conclusion\n— call it Water* — instantiates the\ndisjunctive template. If R is the same proposition displayed\nabove, it is easy to see that Water* satisfies conditions (d),\n(b) and (c*) of the disjunctive template. Furthermore (a) is\nsatisfied at least in the sense that it seems a priori that\nP9 via Q9 entails Q10 (if\nP10 is in background information) (cf. Wright 2011). On\nthis novel diagnosis of non-transmissivity, what would be paradoxical\nis that s could earn justification for Q10 in virtue\nof her non-empirical justification for P9 and\nP10 and her knowledge of the a priori link from\nP9, P10 via Q9 to Q10. If\none follows Wright’s (2003)\n suggestion[19]\n that s isentitled to accept Q10\n— namely to accept the presupposition that there is\na watery substance that provides ‘water’ with its\nextension — Water becomes innocuously\ntransmissive, and the apparent paradox surrounding Water\nvanishes. This is so at least if one grants that it is a priori that\nwater is the watery stuff of our actual acquaintance, once it is\npresupposed that there is any watery stuff of our actual acquaintance.\nFor useful criticism of responses of this type to McKinsey paradox see\nSainsbury (2000), Pritchard (2002), Brown (2003) and (2004),\nMcLaughlin (2003), McKinsey (2003) and Kallestrup (2011). \nAccording to a different interpretation, the paradox elicited by \nWater is to the effect that s would be in position to\nsettle the question—in the sense of removing\ndoubt—about whether she or her community have been embedded\nin an environment containing water by simply reflecting on the content\nof her mental states and by attending to some specific implication of\ncontent externalism, but without engaging in any empirical\ninvestigation. If one accepts this interpretation, a way to dissolve\nthe paradox is to show that Water is non-transmissive precisely\nin the sense that it is incapable of resolving doubt about its\nconclusion (cf. Davies 1998, 2000, 2003a and 2009). As we have seen in\nthe previous section, diagnoses of non-transmissivity as incapability\nof resolving doubt can be systematised by appealing to limitation\nprinciples. Consider then following limitation principle, which is\nalluded to—even if not explicitly formulated—in Davies\n(2009): \nSuppose the antecedent of (LP*) is satisfied by an argument that\ns has carried out. If s doubts the conclusion of the\nargument, s should also doubt at least one of its premises. So\nthe argument is unable to dispel doubt about its conclusion and it is\nnon-transmissive in this sense. It can be argued that Water\ndoes satisfy the antecedent of (LP*) so that it is non-transmissive in\nthis sense. \nTake E9 to be the theory of externalism about mental\ncontent. As we have already seen E9 gives s\njustification for believing P10 in Water—i.e.,\nthe conditional: ‘If I am thinking that water is wet, I have (or\nmy linguistic community has) been embedded in an environment that\ncontains water’. Note that E9 gives s\njustification for, not only P10, but also the following\nconditional: \nIf there is a content such as the proposition that water is wet to be\nthought by me, then (Q9) I have (or my linguistic community\nhas) been embedded in an environment that contains water. \nSuppose now that s doubts Q9. Since Q9 is\nthe consequent of the above conditional, which s accepts,\ns is committed to doubting its antecedent. So s has to\ndoubt that there is a content like the proposition that water is wet.\nBut s’s doubt that there is such a content for her to think\nrationally requires s to accept a defeater for her\njustification for believing P9 offered by her reflective\nevidence E10. For if there is no content like the\nproposition that water is wet for s to think, s cannot\nbe thinking that water is wet. In conclusion, it appears that\nWater satisfies the antecedent of (LP*), and thus seems to\nprove non-transmissive in the sense of not being able to resolve\nantecedent doubt about its conclusion.

Although he doesn’t know how cold it is, Ted conjectures that\nthe temperature must be below 0 °C. Out of curiosity, he checks\nthe weather app of his smartphone. To his astonishment, he sees that\nit is −30 °C. He concludes that this is the least temperature to\nwhich he has been exposed ever. Ted’s belief about his personal record\nowes its justification to Ted’s belief that it is −30 °C,\njustified by the evidence supplied by his smartphone, and Ted’s\nacknowledging that if it is −30 °C, then this is the least\ntemperature to which he has been exposed ever. When one’s belief\nq derives its justification from the justification that one has\nfor another belief p in this way, it has become customary to\nsay that the justification for p transmits to q\nacross the inferential link from p to q.\n\n\nTransmission of justification across inference is a valuable and\nindeed ubiquitous epistemic phenomenon in everyday life and science.\nIt is thanks to the phenomenon of epistemic transmission that\ninferential reasoning is a means for substantiating predictions of\nfuture events and, more generally, for expanding the sphere of our\njustified beliefs or reinforcing the justification of beliefs that we\nalready entertain. However, transmission of justification is not\nwithout exceptions. As a few epistemologists have come to realise,\nmore or less trivial forms of circularity can prevent justification\nfrom transmitting from p to q even if one has\njustification for p and one is aware of the inferential link\nfrom p to q. In interesting cases this happens because\none can acquire justification for p only if one has\nindependent justification for q. In this case the\njustification for q cannot depend on the justification for\np and the inferential link from p to q, as\ngenuine transmission would require.\n\n\nThe phenomenon of transmission failure seems to shed light on\nphilosophical puzzles, such as Moore’s proof of a material world and\nMcKinsey’s paradox, and it plays a central role in various\nphilosophical debates. For this reason it is being granted continued\nand increasing attention.\n\nArthur has the measles and stays in a closed environment with his\nlittle sister Mafalda. If Mafalda ends up contracting the measles\nherself because of her staying in close contact with Arthur, there\nmust be something—the measles virus—which is transmitted\nfrom Arthur to Mafalda in virtue of a relation—the relation of\nstaying in close contact with one another—instantiated by the\ntwo siblings. Epistemologists have been devoting their attention to\nthe fact that epistemicproperties—like being justified\nor being known—are often transmitted in a similar way. An\nexample—which we shall not discuss in this entry—is the\ntransmission of knowledge via testimony from an individual to another.\nA different but equally important phenomenon—which occupies\ncentre stage in this entry—is the transmission of epistemic\njustification across an inference or argument from one proposition to\nanother.\n \nConsider proposition q constituting the conclusion of an\nargument having proposition p as premise (where p can be\na set or conjunction of more propositions). If p is justified\nfor a subject s by evidence e, this justification may\ntransmit to q if s is aware of the entailment between\np and q. When this happens, q is justified for\ns in virtue of her justification for p based on\ne and her knowledge of the inferential relation from p\nto q. Consider this example from Wright (2002): \nHere a subject s can deductively infer Q1 from\nP1 given some background\n information.[1]\n Suppose s acquires justification for P1 by learning\nE1. In this case s will also acquire justification\nfor Q1 in virtue of her knowledge of the inferential\nrelation from P1 to Q1 and her justification for\n P1.[2]\n Thus s’s justification for P1 will transmit to\nQ1. \nIt is widely recognised that epistemic justification sometimes\nfails to transmit across an inference or argument. In\ninteresting cases of transmission failure, s has justification\nfor believing p and s knows the inferential link between\np and q, but s has no justification for believing\nq in virtue of her justification for p and her\nknowledge of the inferential link. Here is an example from Wright\n(2003). Suppose s’s background information entails, among\nordinary things, that Jessica and Jocelyn are indistinguishable twins.\nConsider this possible reasoning: \nIn Twins E2 can give s justification for\nbelieving P2 only if s has independent\njustification for believing Q2 in the first instance.\nSuppose that s does have independent justification for\nbelieving Q2, and imagine that s learns\nE2. In this case s will acquire justification for\nbelieving P2 from E2. But it is intuitive that\ns will acquire no justification for Q2in virtue\nof her justification for believing P2 based on\nE2 and her knowledge of the inferential link between\nP2 and Q2. So Twins instantiates\ntransmission failure when Q2 is independently\njustified. \nAn argument incapable of transmitting to its conclusion a\nspecific justification for its premise(s)—e.g., a\njustification based on evidence e—may turn out to be able\nto transmit to the same conclusion a different justification for its\npremise(s)—e.g., one based on different evidence e*.\nReplace for instance E2 with E2* = ‘This\ngirl’s passport certifies she is Jessica’ in Twins.\nE2* appears capable of providing s with\njustification for believing P2 even if s has no\nindependent justification for Q2. Suppose then that\ns has no independent justification for Q2, and that\nshe acquires E2*. It is intuitive that s will\nacquire justification from E2* for P2 that does\ntransmit to Q2. Now the inference from P2 to\nQ2 instantiates epistemic transmission.  \nAlthough many of the epistemologists taking part in the debate on\nepistemic transmission and transmission failure speak of transmission\nof warrant, rather than justification, they all seem\nto use the term ‘warrant’ to refer to some kind of\nepistemic justification. Most epistemologists investigating epistemic\ntransmission and transmission failure—e.g., Wright (2011, 2007,\n2004, 2003, 2002 and 1985), Davies (2003a, 2000 and 1998), Dretske\n(2005), Pryor (2004), Moretti (2012) and Moretti & Piazza\n(2013)—broadly identify the epistemic property capable of being\ntransmitted with propositional\n justification.[3]\n Only a few authors explicitly focus on transmission of\ndoxastic justification—e.g., Silins (2005), Davies\n(2009) and Tucker (2010a and 2010b). In this entry we will follow the\nmajority in discussing transmission and failure of transmission of\njustification as phenomena primarily pertaining to propositional\njustification. (See however the supplement on\n Transmission of Propositional Justification versus Transmission of Doxastic Justification.) \nEpistemologists typically concentrate on transmission of\n(propositional or doxastic) justification across deductively\nvalid arguments (or arguments deductively valid given background\ninformation). The fact that justification can transmit across\ndeduction is crucial for our cognitive processes because it makes the\nadvancement of knowledge—or of justified belief—through\ndeductive reasoning possible. Suppose evidence e gives you\njustification for believing hypothesis or proposition p and you\nknow that p entails another proposition q that you have\nnot directly checked. If the justification you have for p\ntransmits to its unchecked prediction q through the entailment,\nyou acquire justification for believing q too. \nEpistemologists may analyse epistemic transmission across\nampliative (or inductive) inferences too. (Note that\narguments deductively valid given background information can\noften be turned into good ampliative arguments by simply removing some\nbackground information.) Yet this topic has received much less\nattention in the recent literature on epistemic transmission. (See\nhowever interesting remarks in Tucker 2010a.) \nIn the remaining part of this entry we will focus on transmission and\ntransmission failure of propositional justification across deductive\ninference. Unless differently specified, by ‘epistemic\njustification’ or ‘justification’ we will always\nmean ‘propositional justification’. \nAs said, s’s justification for p based on evidence\ne transmits across entailment from p to p’s\nconsequence q whenever q is justified for s in\nvirtue of s’s justification for p based on e and\nher knowledge of q’s deducibility from p. This initial\ncharacterisation can be distilled into three conditions individually\nnecessary and jointly sufficient for epistemic transmission: \ns’s justification for p based on e transmits to\np’s logical consequence q if and only if: \nCondition (iii) is crucial for distinguishing transmission of\njustification across (known) entailment from closure of\njustification across (known) entailment. To say that a subject\ns’s justification for believing p is closed under\np’s (known) entailment to q is to say that:\n \nIf (i) s has justification for believing p and (ii)\ns knows that p entails q, then (iii-c) s\nhas justification for believing q.\n \nOne can coherently accept the above principle—known as the\n principle of epistemic closure—and\n deny a corresponding principle of epistemic transmission,\ncashed out in terms of the conditions outlined above:\n \nIf (i) s has justification for believing p and (ii)\ns knows that p entails q, then (iii) s has\njustification for believing q in virtue of the\nsatisfaction of (i) and (ii).\n \nThe principle of epistemic closure just requires that when\ns has justification for believing p and knows that\nq is deducible from p, s have justification for\nbelieving q. In addition, the principle of epistemic\ntransmission requires this justification to be had in virtue of\nher having justification for p and knowing that p\nentails q (for further discussion see Tucker 2010b). \nAnother important distinction, at this juncture, is the one between\nthe principle of epistemic transmission and a different\nprinciple of transmission discussed by Pritchard (2012) under the\nlabel of evidential transmission principle. According to\nit, \nIf s perceptually knows that p in virtue of evidence set\ne, and s competently deduces q from p\n(thereby coming to believe that q while retaining her knowledge\nthat p), then s knows that q, where that\nknowledge is sufficiently supported by e. (Pritchard 2012, 75)\n \nPritchard’s principle, to begin with, pertains to (perceptual)\nknowledge and not to propositional justification. Moreover, it\ndeserves emphasis that there are inferences that apparently satisfy\nPritchard’s principle but fail to satisfy the principle of\nepistemic transmission. Consider for instance the following triad:\n \n(Zebra)\n\nE3. The animals in the pen look like zebras.\n\nP3. The animals in the pen are zebras.\n\nTherefore:\n\nQ3. The animals in the pen are not mules cleverly disguised\nso as to look like zebras.\n \nAccording to Pritchard, the evidence set of a normal zoo-goer standing\nbefore the zebra enclosure will typically include, above and beyond\nE3, the background proposition that (EB) to\ndisguise mules like zebras would be very costly and time-consuming,\nwould bring no comparable benefit and would be relatively easy to\nunmask. Suppose s knows P3 on the basis of her\nevidence set, and competently deduces Q3 from P3\nthereby coming to believe Q3. Pritchard’s evidential\ntransmission principle apparently accommodates the fact that\ns thereby comes to know Q3. For her evidence set\n— because of its inclusion of EB\n— sufficiently supports Q3. But the\nprinciple of epistemic transmission is not satisfied. Although\n(i) s has justification for P3 and (ii) she knows that\nP3 entails Q3, she has justification for\nbelieving Q3 in virtue of, not (i) and (ii), but the\nindependent support lent to it by EB.  \nCondition (iii) is sufficient to distinguish the notion of epistemic\ntransmission from different notions in the neighbourhood. However, as\nit stands, it is still unsuitable for the purpose to completely\ncharacterize the phenomenon of epistemic transmission. The problem is\nthat there are many other cases in which it is intuitive that the\njustification for p based on e transmits to q\neven if condition (iii), strictly speaking, is not satisfied.\nThese cases can be described as situations in which only part\nof the justification that s has for q is based on her\njustification for p and her knowledge of the entailment from\np to q. Consider the following example. Suppose you are\ntravelling on a train heading to Edinburgh. At 16:00, as you enter\nNewcastle upon Tyne, you spot the train station sign. Then, at 16:05,\nthe ticket controller tells you that you are not yet in Scotland. Now\nconsider the following reasoning:  \nAs you learn E4, given suitable background information, you\nacquire justification for P4; moreover, to the extent to\nwhich you know that not being in Scotland is sufficient for not being\nin Edinburgh, you also acquire via transmission justification for\nQ4. This additional justification is transmitted\nirrespective of the fact that you already have justification\nfor Q4, acquired by spotting the train station sign\n‘Newcastle upon Tyne’. If (iii) were read as requiring\nthat the whole of the justification available for a proposition\nq were had in virtue of the satisfaction of (i) and (ii), cases\nlike these would become invisible. \nA simple way to deal with this complication is to amend the tripartite\nanalysis of epistemic transmission by turning (iii) into (iii+),\nsaying that at least part of the justification that s\nhas for q has been achieved by her in virtue of the\nsatisfaction of (i) and (ii). Let us say that a justification for\nq is an additional justification for q whenever\nit is not a first-time justification for it. Condition (iii+)\ncan be reformulated as the following disjunction: \nMuch of the extant literature on epistemic transmission concentrates\non examples of transmission of first-time justification. These\nexamples include Toadstool. We have seen, however, that what\nintuitively transmits in certain cases is simply additional\njustification. Epistemologists have identified at least\ntwo—possibly overlapping—kinds of additional justification\n(cf. for instance Moretti & Piazza 2013).  \nOne is what can be called independent justification because it\nappears—intuitively—independent of the original\njustification for q. This notion of justification could\nprobably be sharpened by appealing to counterfactual analysis. Suppose\ns’s justification for p based on e transmits to\np’s logical consequence q. This justification\ntransmitted to q is an additional independent\njustification just in case the following three conditions are met: (1)\ns was already justified in believing q before acquiring\ne, (2) as s acquires e, s is still\njustified in believing q, and (3) if s had not been\nantecedently justified in believing q, upon learning e,\ns would have acquired via transmission a first-time\njustification for believing q. Journey instantiates\ntransmission of justification by meeting (1), (2) and (3). Thus\nJourney exemplifies a case of transmission of additional\nindependent justification. \nConsider now that justification for a proposition or belief normally\ncomes in degrees of strength. The second kind of additional\njustification can be characterised as quantitatively\nstrengthening justification. Suppose again that s’s\njustification for p based on e transmits to p’s\nlogical consequence q. This justification transmitted to\nq is an additional quantitatively strengthening\njustification just in case the following two conditions are satisfied:\n(1) s was already justified in believing q before\nacquiring e, and (2*) as s acquires e, the\nstrength of s’s justification for believing q increases.\nHere is an example from Moretti (2012). Your background information\nsays that only one ticket out of 5,000 of a fair lottery has been\nbought by a person born in 1970, and that all other tickets have been\nbought by older or younger people. Consider now this reasoning: \nThe proposition Q5 given its high chance, is already\njustified on your background information only. As you learn\nE5, it is intuitive that you acquire an additional\nquantitatively strengthening justification for Q5 via\ntransmission. For your justification for P5 transmitted to\nQ5 is intuitively quantitatively stronger than your initial\njustification for Q5. \nIn many cases when q receives via transmission from p an\nadditional independent justification, q will also receive a\nquantitatively strengthening justification. This is not true in\ngeneral though. For there seem to be cases in which an additional\nindependent justification transmitted from p to q\nintuitively lessens an antecedent justification for q\n(cf. Wright 2011).\n \nAn interesting question is whether it is true that as q\nreceives via transmission from p an additional quantitatively\nstrengthening justification, q also receives an independent\njustification. This seems true in some cases—for instance in\nLottery above. It is controversial, however, whether it is the\ncase that whenever q receives via transmission a\nquantitatively strengthening justification, q also receives an\nindependent justification. Wright 2011, and Moretti & Piazza 2013\ndescribe two examples in which a subject allegedly receives via\ntransmission a quantitatively strengthening but not independent\nadditional justification.\n \nTo summarise, additional justification comes apparently in two\nspecies at least: independent justification and\nquantitatively strengthening justification. This fact enables\nus to lay down three specifications of the general condition (iii+)\nnecessary for justification transmission, each of which represents a\ncondition necessary for the transmission of one particular type of\njustification. Let us call these specifications (iii-ft), (iii-ai) and\n(iii-aqs). \n(iii-ft) s has first time justification for q in\nvirtue of the satisfaction of (i) and (ii).\n \n(iii-ai) s has additional independent justification for\nq in virtue of the satisfaction of (i) and (ii).\n \n(iii-aqs) s has additional quantitatively strengthening\njustification for q in virtue of the satisfaction of (i) and\n(ii).\n \nTransmission of first-time justification makes the advancement of\njustified belief through deductive reasoning possible. However, the\nacquisition of first-time justification for q is not the sole\npossible improvement of one’s epistemic position relative to q\nthat one could expect from transmission of justification. Moretti\n& Piazza (2013, 2491–93), for instance, have described a variety\nof different ways in which s’s epistemic standing toward a\nproposition can be improved upon the acquisition via transmission of\nan additional justification for it. \nIt is widely acknowledged that justification sometimes fails to\ntransmit across known entailment (this acknowledgement dates back at\nleast to Wright 1985). Moreover, it is no overstatement to say that\nthe recent literature has investigated the phenomenon of failure of\ntransmission of justification more extensively than that of\ntransmission of justification. As we have seen, justification based on\ne transmits from p to q across the entailment if\nand only if (i) s has justification for p based on\ne, (ii) s knows that q is deducible from\np, and (iii+) at least part of s’s justification for\nq is based on the satisfaction of (i) and (ii). It follows from\nthis characterisation that no justification based on e\ntransmits from p to q across the entailment if\ncondition (i), condition (ii), or condition (iii+) are not satisfied.\nThese are cases of transmission failure.  \nThe most trivial cases of transmission failure are such that it is\ntrue that condition (iii+) is unsatisfied because condition (i) or\ncondition (ii) are unsatisfied, but it is also true that (iii+) would\nhave been satisfied if both condition (i) and (ii) have been satisfied\n(cf. Tucker 2010b). It deserves emphasis that these cases involve\narguments that are not unsuitable for the purpose to transmit\njustification depending on evidence e: had the epistemic\ncircumstances been congenial to the satisfaction of (i) and (ii),\nthese arguments would have transmitted the justification based on\ne from p to q. As we could put the point, these\narguments are transmissive of the justification depending on\n e.[4] \nMore interesting cases of transmission failure—or, for some\nauthors (e.g., Beebee 2001), the only genuine cases of transmission\nfailure—are those in which condition (iii+) is not satisfied\nbecause it could not have been satisfied, no matter whether or not\nconditions (i) and (ii) have been satisfied. These cases concern\narguments non-transmissive of justification depending on a\ngiven evidence, i.e., arguments incapable of transmitting\njustification depending on that evidence under any epistemic\ncircumstance. One example in point is provided by Twins.\nSuppose first that s has independent justification for\nQ2. In those circumstances (i) s has justification\nfrom E2 for P2. Furthermore (ii) s does know\nthat P2 entails Q2. However, s has not\njustification for Q2 in virtue of the satisfaction of (i)\nand (ii). So (iii+) is not met. Suppose now that s has no\nindependent justification for Q2. Then, it is not the case\nthat (i) s has justification from E2 for\nP2. So, in this case (iii+) is not met either. Since there\nis no other possibility — either s has independent\njustification for Q2 or she doesn’t — it\ncannot be the case that s’s belief that Q2 is\njustified in virtue of her justification for P2\nfrom E2 and her knowledge that P2 entails\nQ2.  \nIt is worth noting that none of these cases of failure of transmission\nof justification considered above entails failure of epistemic\nclosure. For in none of these cases s has justification\nfor believing p, s knows that p entails q,\nand s fails to have justification for believing q. \nUnsurprisingly, the epistemologists contributing to the literature on\ntransmission failure have principally devoted their attention to the\ncases of transmission failure involving non-transmissive arguments.\nSome epistemologists have attempted to identify conditions whose\nsatisfaction suffices to make an argument non-transmissive of\njustification based on a given evidence. The next section is devoted\nto reviewing the most influential of these proposals. \nSome non-transmissive arguments explicitly feature their\nconclusion among their premises. Suppose p is justified for\ns by e, and consider the premise-circular argument that\ndeduces p from itself. This argument cannot satisfy condition\n(iii+) even if conditions (i) and (ii) are satisfied. The reason is\nthat no part of s’s justification for p can be acquired\nin virtue of, among other things, the satisfaction of (ii). For\nif (i) is satisfied, p is justified for s by the\nrelevant evidence e independently of s’s\nknowledge of p’ self-entailment, thus not in virtue of\n(ii). \nNon-transmissive arguments are not necessarily premise-circular\narguments. A different source of non-transmissivity instantiating a\nsubtler form of circularity is the dependence of evidential relations\non background or collateral information. This type of dependence is a\nrather familiar phenomenon: the boiling of a kettle on a camping stove\ngives one justification for believing that the temperature of the\nliquid inside is approximately 100 °C only if one knows\nthat the liquid is water and that atmospheric pressure is the one of\nthe sea-level. It doesn’t if one knows that the kettle is on the top\nof a high mountain, or if one knows that the kettle contains, say,\nsulphuric acid.  \nWright argues, for instance, that the following epistemic set-up,\nwhich he calls the information-dependence template, suffices\nfor an argument’s inability to transmit justification. \nA body of evidence, e, is an information-dependent\njustification for a particular proposition p if whether\ne justifies p depends on what one has by way of\ncollateral information, i. […] Such a relationship is\nalways liable to generate examples of transmission failure: it will do\nso just when the particular e, p, and i have the\nfeature that needed elements of the relevant i are themselves\nentailed by p (together perhaps with other warranted premises).\nIn that case, any warrant supplied by e for p will not\nbe transmissible to those elements of i. (2003, 59, edited.)\n \nThe claim that s’s justification from e for p\nrequires s to have background information i is\ncustomarily understood as equivalent (in this context) to the claim\nthat s’s justification from e for p depends on\nsome type of independent justification for believing or accepting\n i.[5] \nThe instantiation of the information-dependence template\nappears sufficient for an argument’s inability to transmit\nfirst-time justification. Consider again the following\ntriad: \n(Twins)\n\nE2. This girl looks just like Jessica.\n\nP2. This girl is actually Jessica.\n\nTherefore:\n\nQ2. This girl is not Jocelyn.  \nSuppose s’s background information entails that Jessica and\nJocelyn are indistinguishable twins. Imagine that s acquires\nE2. It is intuitive that E2 could justify\nP2 for s in Twins only if s had\nindependent justification for believing Q2 in the\nfirst instance. Thus Twins instantiates the\ninformation-dependence template. Note that s acquires\nfirst-time justification for Q2 in Twins only if (i)\nE2 gives her justification for P2, (ii) s\nknows that P2 entails Q2 and (iii-ft) s\nacquires first-time justification for believing Q2in\nvirtue of (i) and (ii). The satisfaction of (iii-ft) requires\ns’s justification for believing Q2not to be\nindependent of s’s justification from E2 for\nP2. However, if (i) is true, the\ninformational-dependence template requires s to have\njustification for believing Q2independently of\ns’s justification from E2 for P2. Thus,\nwhen the information-dependence template is instantiated, (i)\nand (iii-ft) cannot be satisfied at once. In general, no argument\nsatisfying this template together with a given evidence will be\ntransmissive of first-time justification based on that evidence.  \nOne may wonder whether a deductive argument from p to q\ninstantiating the information-dependence template will be\nunable to transmit additional justification for q. The\nanswer seems to be affirmative when the additional justification is\nindependent justification. Suppose the\ninformation-dependence template is instantiated such that\ns’s justification for p from e depends on\ns’s independent justification for q. Note that s\nacquires additional independent justification for q only if (i)\ne gives her justification for p, (ii) s knows\nthat p entails q, and (iii-ai) s acquires an\nadditional independent justification in virtue of (i) and (ii). This\nadditional justification is independent of s’s antecedent\njustification for q only if, in particular, condition (3) of\nthe characterisation of additional independent justification is\nsatisfied. (3) says that if s had not been antecedently\njustified in believing q, upon learning e, s\nwould have acquired via transmission a first-time justification for\nbelieving q. (3) entails that if q were not antecedently\njustified for s, e would still justify p for\ns. Hence, the satisfaction of (3) is incompatible with the\ninstantiation of the information-dependence template, which\nentails that if s had not antecedent justification for\nq, e would not justify p for s. The\ninstantiation of the information-dependence template then\nprecludes the transmission of independent justification. \nAs suggested by Wright (2007, 36) the instantiation of the\ninformation-dependence template might also appear sufficient for an\nargument’s inability to transmit additional quantitatively\nstrengthening justification. This claim might appear intuitively\nplausible: perhaps it is reasonable to expect that, if the\njustification from e for p depends on independent\njustification for another proposition q, the strength of the\njustification available for q sets an upper bound to the\nstrength of the justification possibly supplied by e for\np. However, the examples by Wright (2011) and Moretti &\nPiazza (2013) mentioned in Sect. 2 appear to undermine this\nsuggestion. For they involve arguments that instantiate the\ninformation-dependent template yet seem to transmit quantitatively\nstrengthening justification to their conclusions.  \nSome authors have attempted Bayesian formalisations of the\ninformation dependence template (see the supplement on\n Bayesian Formalisations of the Information-Dependence Template.)\n Furthermore, Coliva (2012) has proposed a variant of the same\ntemplate. In accordance with the information-dependence\ntemplate, s’s justification from e for p\nfails to transmit to p’s consequence q whenever\ns’s possessing that justification for p requires\ns’s independent justification for q. According to\nColiva’s variant, s’s justification from e for\np fails to transmit to q whenever s’s possessing\nthe latter justification for p requires s’s independent\nassumption of q, whether this assumption is justified\nor not. Pryor (2012, § VII) can be read as pressing\nobjections against Coliva’s template, which are addressed in\nColiva (2012).  \nSo far we have seen that non-transmissivity may depend on\npremise-circularity or on reliance on collateral information. There is\nat least a third possibility: an argument can be non-transmissive of\nthe justification for its premise(s) based on given evidence because\nthat evidence justifies directly the conclusion—i.e.,\nindependently of the argument itself (cf. Davies 2009). In\nthis case the argument instantiates indirectness, for\ns’s going through the argument would result in nothing but an\nindirect (and unneeded) detour for justifying its conclusion. If\ne directly justifies q, no part of the justification for\nq is based on, among other things, s’s knowledge of the\ninferential relation between p and q. So (iii+) is\nunfulfilled whether or not (i) and (ii) are fulfilled. Here is an\nexample from Wright (2002):  \n(Soccer)\n\nE6. Jones has just kicked the ball between the white posts.\n\nP6. Jones has just scored a goal.\n\nTherefore:\n\nQ6. A game of soccer is taking place. \nSuppose s learns evidence E6. On ordinary background\ninformation (i) E6 justifies P6 for s,\n(ii) s knows that P6 entails Q6, and\nE6 also justifies Q6 for s. It seems\nfalse, however, that Q6 is justified for s in\nvirtue of the satisfaction of (i) and (ii). Quite the reverse,\nQ6 seems justified for s by E6\nindependently the satisfaction of (i) and (ii). This is so because in\nthe (imagined) actual scenario it seems true that s would still\npossess a justification for Q6 based on E6 even\nif E6 did not justify P6 for s.\nSuppose in fact s had noticed that the referee’s assistant\nraised her flag to signal Jones’s off-side. Against this altered\nbackground information, E6 would no longer justify\nP6 for s but it would still justify Q6\nfor s. Thus Soccer is non-transmissive of the\njustification depending on E6. In general, no argument\ninstantiating indirectness in relation to some evidence will\nbe transmissive of justification based on that evidence. \nThe information-dependence template and indirectness\nare diagnostics for a deductive argument’s inability to transmit the\njustification for its premise(s) p based on evidence e\nto its conclusion q, where e is conceived of as a\nbelieved proposition capable of supplying\ninferential and (typically) fallible justification\nfor p. (Note that even though e is conceived of as a\nbelief, the collateral information i, which is part of the\ntemplate, doesn’t need to be believed on some views.) The\njustification for a proposition p might come in further forms.\nFor instance, it has been proposed that a proposition p about\nthe perceivable environment around the subject s can be\njustified by the fact that s sees that p. In this\ncase, s is claimed to attain a kind of non-inferential\nand infallible justification for believing p. The latter\nview has been explored by epistemological disjunctivists (see\nfor instance McDowell 1982, 1994 and 2008, and Pritchard 2007, 2008,\n2009, 2011 and 2012).  \nOne might find it intuitively plausible that when s sees that\np, s attains non-inferential and infallible\njustification for believing p that doesn’t rely on s’s\nbackground information. Since this justification for believing\np would be a fortiori unconstrained by s’s\nindependent justification for believing any consequence q of\np, in these cases the information-dependence template could not\npossibly be instantiated. Therefore, one might be tempted to conclude\nthat when s sees that p, s acquires a\njustification that typically transmits to the propositions that\ns knows to be deducible from p (cf. Wright 2002).\nPritchard (2009 and 2012) comes very close to endorsing this view\nexplicitly.  \nThe latter contention has not stayed unchallenged. Suppose one accepts\na notion of epistemic justification with internalist resonances\nsaying that a factor J is relevant to s’s epistemic\njustification only if s is able to determine, by reflection\nalone, whether J is or is not realised. On this notion, s’s\nseeing that p cannot provide s with justification for\nbelieving p unless s can rationally claim that she is\nseeing that p upon reflection alone. Seeing that p,\nhowever, is subjectively indistinguishable from hallucinating\nthat p, or from being in some other delusional state in which\nit merely seems to s that she is seeing that p.\nFor this reason, one may find it compelling that s can claim by\nreflection alone that she’s seeing that p only if s has\nan independent reason for ruling out that it merely seems to her that\nshe does (cf. mainly Wright 2011). If this is true, for many deductive\narguments from p to q, s will be unable to\nacquire non-inferential and infallible justification for believing\np of the type described by the disjunctivist and capable of\ntransmitting to q. In particular, this will happen whenever\nq is the logical negation of a proposition ascribing to\ns some delusionary mental state in which it merely seems to her\nthat she is directly perceiving that p.  \nWright’s disjunctive template is meant to be a diagnostic of\nfailure of transmission of non-inferential justification when\nepistemic justification is conceived of in the internalist fashion\nsuggested\n above.[6]\n According to Wright (2000), for any propositions p, q\nand r and subject s, the disjunctive template is\ninstantiated whenever:  \n(a) p entails q;\n\n(b) s’s justification for p consists in s’s being\nin a state subjectively indistinguishable from a state in which\nr would be true;\n\n(c) r is incompatible with p;\n\n(d) r would be true if q were false.  \nTo see how this template might apply, consider again the following\ntriad: \n(Zebra)\n\nE3. The animals in the pen look like zebras.\n\nP3. The animals in the pen are zebras.\n\nTherefore:\n\nQ3. The animals in the pen are not mules cleverly disguised\nso as to look like zebras.\n \nThe justification from E3 for P3 arguably fails\nto transmit across the inference from P3 to Q3\nbecause of the satisfaction of the information-dependence\ntemplate. For it seems true that s could acquire a\njustification for believing P3 on the basis of\nE3 only if s had an independent justification for\nbelieving Q3. But suppose that s’s justification for\nbelieving P3 is based not on E3 but on\ns’s seeing that P3. Let’s call Zebra*\nthe corresponding variant of Zebra. Given the\nnon-inferential nature of the justification considered for\nP3, Zebra* could not instantiate the\ninformation-dependence template. However, it is easy to check\nthat Zebra* instantiates the disjunctive template. To\nbegin with, (a) P3 entails Q3; (b) s’s\njustification for believing P3 is constituted by s’s\nseeing that P3, which is subjectively indistinguishable\nfrom the state that s would be in if it were true that (R) the\nanimals in the pen are mules cleverly disguised so as to look like\nzebras; (c) R is incompatible with P3; and, trivially, (d)\nif Q3 were false R would be true.  \nSince Zebra* instantiates the disjunctive template, it\nis non-transmissive of at least first-time justification. In\nfact note that s acquires first-time justification for\nQ3 in this case if and only if (i) s has\njustification for P3 based on seeing that P3,\n(ii) s knows that P3 entails Q3, and\n(iii-ft) s acquires first-time justification for believing\nQ3 in virtue of (i) and (ii). Also note that (iii-ft)\nrequires s’s justification for believing Q3not to be independent of s’s justification for\nP3 based on seeing that P3. However, if (i) is\ntrue, the disjunctive template requires s to have\njustification for believing Q3independent of\ns’s justification for P3 based on her seeing that\nP3. (For if s could not independently exclude that\nQ3 is false, given (d), (c) and (b), s could not\nexclude that the incompatible alternative R to P3, which\ns cannot subjectively distinguish from P3 on the\nground of her seeing that P3, is true.) Thus, when the\ndisjunctive template is instantiated, (i) and (iii-ft) cannot\nbe satisfied at once.  \nThe disjunctive template has been criticised by McLaughlin (2003) on\nthe ground that the template is instantiated whenever the\njustification for p is fallible, i.e. compatible with\np’s falsity. Here is an example from Brown (2004).\nConsider the following deductive argument: \n(Fox)\n\nP7. The animal in the garbage is a fox.\n\nTherefore:\n\nQ7. The animal in the garbage is not a cat. \nSuppose s has a fallible justification for believing\nP7 based on s’s experience as if the animal\nin the garbage is a fox. Take now R to be P7’s logical\nnegation. Since the justification that s has for P7\nis fallible, condition (b) above is met by default. As one can\neasily check, conditions (a), (c) and (d) are also met. So Fox\ninstantiates the disjunctive template. Yet it is intuitive that\nFox does transmit justification to its conclusion.  \nOne could simply respond to McLaughlin that his argument is misplaced\nbecause the disjunctive template was only meant to apply to\ninfallible and not fallible justification. A more useful\nresponse to McLaughlin is however to refine the conditions listed in\nthe disjunctive template so as to block McLaughlin’s argument\nwhile letting this template account for transmission failure of both\nfallible and infallible justification. Wright (2011) for instance\nsuggests replacing (c) with the following\n condition:[7] \n(c*) r is incompatible (not necessarily with p but) with\nsome presupposition of the cognitive project of obtaining a\njustification for p in the relevant fashion. \nAccording to Wright’s (2011) characterisation, a presupposition of a\ncognitive project is any condition such that doubting it before\ncarrying out the project would rationally commit one to doubting the\nsignificance or competence of the project irrespective of its outcome.\nFor a wide class of cognitive projects examples of these\npresuppositions include: normal and proper functioning of the relevant\ncognitive faculties, the reliability of utilised instruments, the\nobtaining of the circumstances congenial to the proposed method of\ninvestigation, the soundness of relevant principles of inference\nutilised in developing and collating one’s results, and so on.  \nWith (c*) in the place of (c), Fox no longer instantiates the\ndisjunctive template. For the truth of R—the proposition\nthat the animal in the garbage is not a fox—appears to\njeopardize no presupposition of the cognitive project of obtaining a\nperceptual justification for P7. Thus (c*) is not\nfulfilled. On the other hand, arguments that intuitively do not\ntransmit do satisfy (c*). Take again Zebra*. In that case R is\nthe proposition that the animals in the pen are mules cleverly\ndisguised so as to look like zebras. Since R entails that conditions\nare unsuitable for attaining perceptual justification for believing\nP3, R looks incompatible with a presupposition of the\ncognitive project of obtaining perceptual justification for\nP3. Thus R does satisfy (c*) in this case.  \nIn order to illuminate philosophical puzzles (e.g., McKinsey Paradox\nillustrated below in Sect. 5.2) Davies has proposed other\nconditions—which he calls limiting principles—whose\nsatisfaction would prevent an argument from possibly transmitting\njustification. Some of these principles will be discussed in Sect. 5.1\nand Sect. 5.2. Further conditions are considered in Pryor (2012). \nTo conclude this section we outline an explanation of epistemic\ntransmission failure delivered by Smith\n (2009),[8]\n which is very different from all those considered so far. According\nto Smith, epistemic justification requires reliability. A\nsubject s’s belief that p, held on the basis of\ns’s belief that e, is reliable in the sense defined by\nSmith if and only if in all possible worlds including e as true\nand that are as normal (from the perspective of the actual\nworld) as the truth of e permits, p is also true.\nConsider Zebra again. s’s belief that P3\n— that the animals in the pen are zebras —\nproves reliable in Smith’s sense when it is based on s’s belief\nthat E3 — that the animals in the pen look\nlike zebras. (Disguising mules so as to make them look like zebras is\nafter all an abnormal practice.) Thus, all possible\nE3-worlds that are as normal as the truth of E3\npermits are not worlds in which the animals in the pen are cleverly\ndisguised mules. Rather, they are\nP3-worlds—that is to say, worlds in which the\nanimals in the pen are zebras. \nSmith distinguishes between two ways in which a belief can come to\npossess this property of being reliable. One possibility is that a\nbelief that p possesses it in virtue of the modal relationship\nwith its basis e. In this case, e is a contributing\nreliable basis. Another possibility is when it is the content of the\nbelief that p, rather than the belief’s modal relationship with\nits basis e, that guarantees by itself the belief’s\nreliability. In this case, e is a non-contributing reliable\nbasis. An example of the first kind is s’s belief that\nP3, which is reliable because of its modal relationship\nwith E3. There are obviously many sufficiently normal\nworlds in which P3 is false, but no sufficiently normal\nworld in which P3 is false and E3 true. An\nexample of the second kind is s’s belief that Q3 as\nbased on E3. It is this belief’s content, and not its modal\nrelationship with E3, that guarantees its reliability. As\nSmith puts it, there are no sufficiently normal worlds in which\nE3 is true and Q3 is false, but this is simply\nbecause there are no sufficiently normal worlds in which Q3\nis false. \nAccording to Smith, roughly, a deductive inference from p to\nq fails to transmit to q justification relative to\np’s basis e, if e is a contributing reliable\nbasis for believing p but is a non-contributing reliable basis\nfor believing q. In this case the inference fails to\nexplain q’s reliability: if s deduced one\nproposition from another, she would reliably believe that q,\nbut not — not even in part — in virtue of\nhaving inferred this proposition from p (as held on the basis\nof e). Zebra fails to transmit to Q3\njustification relative to P3’s basis E3 in this\nprecise sense. (Smith 2009 also includes an account of failure of\ntransmission of knowledge across valid inference criticized by\nTucker 2012. A discussion of this account is beyond the aims of this\nentry.) \nLet us say that a subject s doubts q just in case\ns either disbelieves or withholds belief about\nq, namely refrains from both believing and disbelieving\nq after deciding about q. s’s doubting\nq should be distinguished from s’s being open\nminded about q and from s’s having no\ndoxastic attitude whatsoever towards q (cf. Tucker 2010a). Let\nus say that a deductively valid argument from p to q has\nthe power to resolve doubt about its conclusion just in case it is\npossible for s to be rationally moved from doubting q to\nbelieving q solely in virtue of grasping the argument from\np to q and the evidence offered for p. \nThere is today wide agreement in the literature that the property of\nbeing a transmissive argument does not coincide with the property of\nbeing an argument capable of resolving doubt about its conclusion (see\nfor example, Beebee 2001, Coliva 2010, Markie 2005, Pryor 2004,\nBergmann 2004 and 2006, White 2006, Silins 2005 and Tucker 2010a). A\nreason for thinking so is that whereas the property of being\ntransmissive appears to be a genuinely epistemic property of an\nargument, the one of resolving doubt seems to be only a\ndialectical feature of it, which varies with the audience whose\ndoubt the argument is used to address. \nIn spite of these considerations, a few authors (e.g., Davies 1998,\nand 2003a, 2004, and 2009, McLaughlin 2000 and Wright 2002, 2003, and\n2007) have insisted that we should conceive of epistemic\ntransmissivity in a way that proves very closely related or even\nidentical to the capability of resolving doubt. Whereas some of these\nauthors have eventually conceded that epistemic transmissivity cannot\nbe defined as capability of resolving doubt (e.g., Wright 2011),\nothers have attempted to articulate their views in full (see mostly\nDavies 2003a, 2004 and 2009). Suppose one wants to claim that an\nargument is transmissive when it is at the service of resolving a\nsubject’s doubt about the conclusion. One possible way to go\n— which parallels Jackson’s (1987, §6)  analysis of\nwhen an argument begs the hearer’s question — is this. An\nargument could be considered to be non-transmissive when the fact that\nthe subject doubts (or suppositionally\n doubts)[9]\n its conclusion, in her own thought, rationally requires the subject\nto adopt new background assumptions on which the premises are no\nlonger justified by the relevant evidence (cf. Davies 2003a, 2004 and\n2009. For a critical discussion of Davies’ project see Coliva 2010).\nAs we will see below, it can be argued that Moore’s proof and the\ninference central to McKinsey paradox are non-transmissive in this\nsense. \nThe notions of transmissive and non-transmissive argument, above and\nbeyond being investigated for their own sake, have been put to work in\nrelation to specific philosophical problems and issues. An important\nproblem is whether Moore’s infamous proof of a material world and\nsimilar Moorean responses to the skeptic are successful. Another issue\npertains to the solution of McKinsey paradox. A third issue concerns\nBoghossian’s (2001 and 2003) explanation of our logical knowledge via\nimplicit definitions, criticised as resting on a non-transmissive\nargument schema (see for instance Ebert 2005 and Jenkins 2008). As the\ndebate focusing on the last topic is only at an early stage of its\ndevelopment, it is preferable to concentrate on the first two, which\nwill be reviewed in respectively Sect. 5.1 and Sect. 5.2 below. \nMuch of the contemporary debate on Moore’s proof of a material world\n(see Moore 1939) is interwoven with the topic of epistemic\ntransmission and its failure. Moore’s proof can be reconstructed as\nfollows: \n(Moore)\n\nE8. My experience is in all respects as of a hand held up\nin front of my face.\n\nP8. Here is a hand.\n\nTherefore:\n\nQ8. There is a material world (since any hand is a material\nobject existing in space).  \nThe evidence E8 in Moore is constituted by a\nproposition believed by s. One might suggest, however,\nthat this is a misinterpretation of Moore’s proof (and the variants of\nit that we shall consider shortly). One might argue, in other words,\nthat what is meant to give s justification for believing\nP8 is s’s experience of a hand. Nevertheless,\nmost of the epistemologists taking part in this debate implicitly or\nexplicitly assume that one’s experience as if p and one’s\nbelief that one has an experience as if p have the same\njustifying power (cf. White 2006 and Silins 2007). \nMany philosophers find Moore’s proof unsuccessful. Philosophers have\nput forward explanations of this impression according to which\nMoore is non-transmissive in some of the senses described in\nSect. 3 (see mainly Wright 1985, 2002, 2007 and 2011) or\nnon-transmissive in the non-standard sense that it is incapable of\nresolving doubt about its conclusion (see mainly Davies 1998, 2000,\n2003a, 2003b, 2004 and 2009). A different explanation is that Moore’s\nproof does transmit justification but is dialectically ineffective\n(see mainly Pryor 2004).  \nAccording to Wright there exist cornerstone\npropositions—or simply cornerstones—for\ndifferent areas of discourse. In accordance with Wright’s\ncharacterization of it, c is a cornerstone for an area of\ndiscourse d just in case for any proposition p belonging\nto d, p could not be justified for any subject s\nif s had no independent justification for accepting c\n(see mostly Wright\n 2004).[10]\n Cornerstones for the area of discourse about perceivable things are\nfor instance the logical negations of skeptical\nconjectures, such as the proposition that one’s experiences are\nnothing but one’s hallucinations caused by a Cartesian demon or the\nMatrix. Wright contends that the conclusion Q8 of\nMoore is also a cornerstone for the area of discourse about\nperceivable things. Adapting terminology introduced by Pryor (2004),\nWright’s conception of the architecture of perceptual justification\nthus treats Q8conservatively with respect to any\nperceptual hypothesis p: if s had no independent\njustification for Q8, no proposition e describing an\napparent perception could supply s with prima facie\njustification for any perceptual hypothesis p. It follows from\nthis that Moore instantiates the information-dependence\ntemplate considered in Sect. 3.2. For Q8 is part of the\ncollateral information which s needs independent justification\nfor if s is to receive some justification for P8\nfrom E8. Hence Moore is non-transmissive. (See\nmainly Wright 2002.) Note that the thesis that Moore’s proof is\nepistemologically useless because non-transmissive in the sense\nexplained is compatible with the claim that by learning E8,\nin Moore,s does acquire a justification for believing\nP8. For instance, Wright (2004) contends that we all have a\nspecial kind of non-evidential justification, which he calls\nentitlement, for accepting Q8 as well as other\ncornerstones in\n general.[11]\n Thus by learning E8 we do acquire justification for\nP8. Wright’s analysis of Moore’s proof and Wright’s\nconservatism have mostly been criticized in conjunction with his\ntheory of entitlement. A presentation of these objections is beyond\nthe scope of this entry. (See however Davies 2004, Pritchard 2005 and\nJenkins 2007. For a defense of Wright’s views see for instance Neta\n2007.)  \nAs anticipated, other philosophers contend that Moore’s proof does\ntransmit justification and that its ineffectiveness has a different\nexplanation. An important conception of the architecture of perceptual\njustification, called dogmatism in Pryor (2000 and 2004),\nembraces a generalised form of liberalism about perceptual\njustification. This form of liberalism is opposed to Wright’s\nconservatism, and claims that in order to have prima facie\nperceptual justification for believing p from an apparent\nperception that p, s doesn’t need independent\njustification for believing the negation of skeptical conjectures or\nof other non-perceiving hypotheses like Not-Q8. This is so,\nfor the dogmatist, because our experiences give us immediate\nand prima facie justification for believing their contents.\nSaying that our perceptual justification is immediate is saying that\nit does not presuppose—not even in part—justification for\nanything else. Saying that our justification is prima facie is saying\nthat it can be defeated by additional evidence. Our perceptual\njustification would be defeated, for example, by evidence that a\nrelevant non-perceiving hypothesis is true or just as probable as its\nnegation. For instance, s’s perceptual justification for\nbelieving P8 in Moore’s proof would be defeated by evidence\nthat Not-Q8 is true, or evidence that Q8 and\nNot-Q8 are equally probable. On this point the dogmatist\nand Wright do agree. They disagree on whether s’s perceptual\njustification for P8 requires independent justification for\nbelieving or accepting Q8. The dogmatist denies that\ns needs that independent justification. Thus, according to the\ndogmatist, Moore’s proof transmits the perceptual justification\navailable for its premise to its\n conclusion.[12] \nThe dogmatist argues (or may argue), however, that Moore’s proof is\ndialectically flawed (cf. Pryor 2004). The contention is that\nMoore’s is unsuccessful because it is useless for the purpose to\nconvince the idealist or the external world sceptic that there is a\nmaterial world. In short, the idealist and the global sceptic don’t\nbelieve that there is a material world. Since the idealist and the\nsceptic don’t believe Q8, they are rationally required to\ndistrust any perceptual evidence offered in favor of\nP8 in the first instance. For this reason they both will\nreject Moore’s proof as one based on an unjustified\n premise.[13]\n Moretti (2014) suggests that the dogmatist could alternatively\ncontend that Moore’s proof is non-transmissive because s’s\nexperience of a hand gives s immediate justification for\nbelieving the conclusion Q8 of the proof. According\nto this diagnosis, Moore’s proof is epistemically flawed because\nit instantiates a variant of indirectness in which the evidence\nis an experience of a hand. Pryor’s analysis of Moore’s proof\nhas principally been criticised in conjunction with his liberalism in\nepistemology of perception. (See Cohen 2002 and 2005, Schiffer 2004\nWright 2007, White 2006, and Siegel and Silins 2015.)  \nSome authors (e.g., Wright 2003, Pryor 2004, White 2006, Silins 2007,\nNeta 2010) have investigated whether certain variants of Moore\nare transmissive of justification. These arguments start from a\npremise like P8, describing a (supposed) perceivable state\nof affairs of the external world, and deduce from it the logical\nnegation of a relevant skeptical conjecture. Consider for\nexample the variant of Moore that starts from P8 and\nreplaces Q8 with: \nQ8*. It is not the case that I am a handless brain in a vat\nfed with the hallucination of a hand held up in front of my face. \nLet’s call Moore* this variant of Moore. While\ndogmatists à la Pryor argue (or may argue) that\nMoore* is transmissive but dialectically flawed (cf. Pryor\n2004), conservatives à la Wright contend (or may\ncontend) that it is non-transmissive (cf. Wright 2007). Although it\nremains very controversial whether or not Moore is\ntransmissive, epistemologists have found some prima facie\nreason to think that arguments like Moore* are\nnon-transmissive. \nAn important difference between Moore and Moore* is\nthis: whereas the logical negation of Q8 does not\nexplain the evidential statement E8 (“My\nexperience is in all respects as of a hand held up in front of my\nface”) adduced in support of P8, the logical negation\nof Q8* — i.e., Not-Q8*\n— explains E8 to some extent.\nAccordingly, since Not-Q8* provides a potential explanation\nof E8, is it intuitive that E8 is\nevidence (perhaps very week evidence) for believing\nNot-Q8*. It is easy to conclude from this that s\ncannot acquire justification for believing Q8* via\ntransmission through Moore* upon learning E8. For it\nis intuitive that if this were the case, E8 should count as\nevidence for Q8*. But this is impossible: one and the same\nproposition cannot simultaneously be evidence for a hypothesis and its\nlogical negation. By formalizing intuitions of this type, White (2006)\nhas put forward a simple Bayesian argument to the effect that\nMoore* and similar variants of Moore are not\ntransmissive of\n justification.[14]\n (See Silins 2007 for discussion. For responses to White, see for\ninstance Weatherson 2007, Kung 2010 and Moretti 2015).  \nFrom the above analysis it is easy to conclude that the\ninformation-dependence template is satisfied by Moore*\nand akin proofs. In fact note that if E8 is evidence for\nboth P8 and Not-Q8*, it seems correct to say\nthat s can acquire a justification for believing P8\nonly if s has independent justification for disbelieving\nNot-Q8* and thus believing Q8*. Since\nNot-Q8* counts as a non-perceiving hypothesis for\nPryor, this gives us a reason to doubt dogmatism (cf. White\n 2006).[15] \nColiva (2005 and 2012) defends a view — baptized by her\nmoderatism — that aims to be a middle way between\nWright’s conservatism and Pryor’s dogmatism. On the one hand, the\nmoderate contends — against the conservative\n— that cornerstones cannot be justified and that in order\nto possess perceptual justification s needs no justification\nfor accepting any cornerstones. On the other hand, the moderate claims\n— against the dogmatist — that to possess\nperceptual justification s needs to assume (without\njustification) relevant\n cornerstones.[16]\n By relying on her variant of the information-dependent template\ndescribed in Sect. 3.2, Coliva concludes that neither Moore\nnor any proof like Moore* is transmissive. (For a critical\ndiscussion of moderatism see for instance Avnur 2017, Baghramian 2017,\nMillar 2017, Volpe 2017, and Coliva 2017.)  \nEpistemological disjunctivists like McDowell and Pritchard have argued\nthat in paradigmatic cases of perceptual knowledge, what is meant to\ngive s justification for believing P8 is, not\nE8, but s’s factive state of seeing that\nP8. This — it might be contended\n— is not without consequences with respect to the\nquestion whether Moore* transmits propositional justification.\nPritchard explicitly defends the claim that when s sees that\nP8, thereby learning that P8, s can come\nto know by inference from P8 the negation of any sceptical\nhypothesis inconsistent with P8, like Q8* (cf.\nPritchard 2012, 129–30). This might encourage the belief that, for\nPritchard, the inference in Moore* can transmit the\njustification for P8 based on s’s seeing that\nP8 across the entailment from P8 to\nQ8* (see Lockhart 2018 for an explicit\nargument to this effect). The latter claim must however be handled\nwith some care. \nAs we have seen in Sect. 2, Pritchard contends that when one knows\np on the basis of evidence e, one can know p’s\nconsequence q by inference from p only if e\nsufficiently supports q. For Pritchard this condition is met\nwhen s’s support for believing P8 is constituted by\ns’s seeing that P8, s’s epistemic situation\nis objectively good (i.e., s’s cognitive faculties are working\nproperly in a cooperative environment) and the skeptical hypothesis\nruled out by Q8* has not been epistemically motivated. For,\nin this case, s has a reflectively accessible factive\nsupport for believing P8 that entails —\nand so sufficiently supports — Q8*. Thus, in\nthis case nothing stands in the way of s competently deducing\nQ8* from P8, thereby coming to know\nQ8* on the basis of P8.  \nIf upon deducing one proposition from another, s comes\nto justifiably believe Q8* for the first-time, the\ninference from P8 to Q8* arguably transmits\ndoxastic justification. (See the supplement on\n Transmission of Propositional Justification versus Transmission of Doxastic Justification.)\n It is more dubious, however, that when s’s support for\nP8 is constituted by s’s seeing that P8,\nMoore* is also transmissive of propositional\njustification. For instance, one might contend that Moore* is\nnon-transmissive because it instantiates the disjunctive\ntemplate described in Sect. 3.2 (cf. Wright 2002). To start with,\nP8 entails Q8*, so (a) is satisfied. Let R* be\nthe proposition that this is no hand but s is victim of a\nhallucination of a hand held up before her face. Since R* would be\ntrue if Q8* were false, (d) is also satisfied. Furthermore,\ntake the grounds of s’s justification for P8 to be\ns’s seeing that P8. Since this experience is a state\nfor s indistinguishable from one in which R* is true, condition\n(b) is also satisfied. Finally, it might be argued that the\nproposition that one is not hallucinating is a presupposition of the\ncognitive project of learning about one’s environment through\nperception. It follows that R* is incompatible with a presupposition\nof s’s cognitive project of learning about one’s environment\nthrough perception. Thus (c*) appears to be fulfilled too. So\nMoore* will not transmit the justification that s\npossesses for P8 to Q8*.  \nTo resist the this conclusion, a disjunctivist might insist that\nMoore*, relative to s’s support for P8\nsupplied by s’s seeing that P8, does not always\ninstantiate the disjunctive template, in particular because\ncondition (b) is not necessarily fulfilled (cf. Lockhart 2018.) By\nappealing to a distinction drawn by Pritchard (2012), one might\ncontend that (b) is not necessarily fulfilled, because s,\nthough unable to perceptually discriminate between seeing that\nP8 and merely hallucinating it, may have evidence that\nfavors the hypothesis that she is in the first state.  For Pritchard,\nthis happens — as we have seen — when s sees that\nP8 in good epistemic conditions and the skeptical\nconjecture that s is having a hallucination of a hand has not\nbeen epistemically motivated. In this case, s is in position to\ncome to know Q8* by inference from P8 even if\nshe is unable to perceptually discriminate one situation from the\nother.  \nPritchard’s thesis that, in good epistemic conditions, s’s\nfactive support for believing P8 coinciding with s’s\nseeing that P8 is reflectively accessible is open to\ncontroversy (cf. Piazza 2016 and Lockhart 2018). Since\nthis thesis is essential to the contention that Moore* may not\ninstantiate the disjunctive template and may thus be\ntransmissive of propositional justification, the latter contention is\nalso open to controversy.  \nOne could explain the ineffectiveness of Moore and similar\nproofs in a specific way that differs from any of the diagnoses\ndescribed so far. This new account diagnoses Moorean proofs with being\nnon-transmissive in the precise sense (discussed Sect. 4) of being\nincapable of resolving doubt about their conclusions.  \nDiagnoses of non-transmissivity as incapability of resolving doubt can\nbe systematised by appealing to limitation\nprinciples—i.e., principles that restrain justification\ntransmission. For instance, a limitation principle that seems to\nexplain why Moore is non-transmissive as incapable of resolving\ndoubt about its conclusion has been proposed by Davies (2009) and it\nreads roughly as\n follows:[17] \nThe antecedent of (LP) would seem to be satisfied by E8,\nP8 and Q8. Suppose s doubted (in her\nthought) Q8. This alone would rationally commit s to\ndoubting that E8 actually justifies P8. Thus\nMoore turns out to be non-transmissive when (LP) is in place.\n(Mutatis mutandis, the same explanation applies to\nMoore* too.)  \nInterestingly enough, any argument satisfying the\ninformation-dependence template also satisfies the antecedent\nof (LP). Suppose the justification from e for the premise(s)\np of a known deductively valid argument concluding in q\nis conditional on independent justification for q. This implies\nthat any subject examining the argument who had a doubt about q\nwould be rationally required to accept a defeater for the\njustification for p based on e. Hence non-transmissivity\nas incapability of satisfying (iii+) engendered by reliance on\ncollateral information entails non-transmissivity as incapability of\nresolving doubt. \nMcKinsey (1991, 2002, 2003 and 2007) has offered a reductio argument\nfor the incompatibility of first-person privileged access to mental\ncontent and externalism about mental content. The privileged access\nthesis roughly says that it is necessarily true that if a subject\ns is thinking that x, then s can in principle\nknow a priori (or in a non-empirical way) that she herself is thinking\nthat x. Externalism about mental content roughly says that\npredicates of the form ‘is thinking that\nx’—e.g., ‘is thinking that water is\nwet’—express properties that are wide, in the\nsense that possession of these properties by s logically or\nconceptually implies the existence of relevant contingent objects\nexternal to s’s mind—e.g., water. McKinsey argues that\ns may reason along these lines: \n(Water)\n\nP9. I am thinking that water is wet.\n\nP10. If I am thinking that water is wet then I have (or my\nlinguistic community has) been embedded in an environment that\ncontains water.\n\nTherefore:\n\nQ9. I have (or my linguistic community has) been embedded\nin an environment that contains water.  \nWater produces an absurdity. If the privileged access thesis\nis true, s knows P9non-empirically. If\nsemantic externalism is true, s knows P10a\npriori by mere conceptual analysis. Since P9 and\nP10 do entail Q9 and knowledge is presumably\nclosed under known entailment, s knows\nQ9—which is an empirical\nproposition—by simply competently deducing it from P9\nand P10 and without conducting any empirical\ninvestigation. As this is absurd, McKinsey concludes that the\nprivileged access thesis or semantic externalism must be false. \nOne way to resist McKinsey’s incompatibilist conclusion that\nthe privileged access thesis and externalism about mental content\ncannot be true together is to argue that Water is\nnon-transmissive. Since knowledge is presumably closed under known\nentailment, it remains true that s cannot know P9\nand P10 while failing to know Q9. However,\nMcKinsey paradox originates from the stronger\nconclusion—motivated by the claim that Water is a\ndeductively valid argument featuring premises knowable\nnon-empirically—that s, by running Water, could\ncome to know non-empirically the empirical proposition\nQ9 that she or members of her community have had contact\nwith water. This is precisely what could not happen if Water\nis non-transmissive: in this case s could not learn\nQ9 on the basis of her non-empirical justification for\nP9 and P10, and her knowledge of the entailment\nbetween P9, P10 and Q9 (see mainly\nWright 2000, 2003 and 2011, and Davies 1998, 2000, 2003a, 2003b and\n2009). \nA first possibility to defend the thesis that Water is\nnon-transmissive is to argue that Water instantiates the\ndisjunctive template (considered in Sect. 3.2) (cf. Wright\n2000, 2003 and 2011). If Water is non-transmissive, s\ncould acquire a justification for, or knowledge of, P9 and\nP10 only if s were in possession of an\nindependent justification for, or knowledge of,\nQ9. (And to avoid the absurd result that McKinsey recoils\nfrom, this independent justification for Q9 should\npresumably be empirical.) If this diagnosis is correct, one need not\ndeny P9 or P10 to block the intuitively false\nconsequence that s could acquire knowledge of the empirical\nproposition Q9 in virtue of only non-empirical\nknowledge. \nTo substantiate the thesis that Water instantiates the\ndisjunctive template one should first emphasise that the kind\nof externalism about mental content underlying P10 in\nWater is compatible with the possibility that s\nsuffers from illusion of content. Were this to happen with\nP9 in Water, s would seem to introspect that\nshe believes that water is wet whereas there is nothing like that\ncontent to be believed by s in the first instance.\nConsider: \nR. ‘water’ refers to no natural kind so that\nthere is no content expressed by the sentence ‘water is\nwet’. \ns’s state of having introspective justification for believing\nP9 is arguably subjectively indistinguishable from a\nsituation in which R is true. Thus condition (b) of the disjunctive\ntemplate is met. Moreover, R appears incompatible with an obvious\npresupposition of s’s cognitive project of attaining\nintrospective justification for believing P9, at least if\nthe content that water is wet embedded in P9 is constrained\nby s or her linguistic community having being in contact with\nwater. Thus condition (c*) is also met. Furthermore, P9\nentails Q9 (when P10 is in background\ninformation). Hence condition (a) is fulfilled. If we could also show\nthat (d) is satisfied in Water, in the sense that if\nQ9 were false R would be true, we would have shown that the\ndisjunctive template is satisfied by Water. Wright\n(2000), for instance, takes (d) to be actually fulfilled and concludes\nthat the disjunctive template is satisfied by\nWater. \nUnfortunately, the claim that (d) is satisfied in Water cannot\neasily be vindicated (cf. Wright 2003). Condition (d) is satisfied in\nWater only if it is true that if s (or s’s\nlinguistic community) had not been embedded in an environment that\ncontains water, the term ‘water’ would have\nreferred to no natural kind. This is true only if the closest possible\nworld w in which this counterfactual’s antecedent is true is\nlike Boghossian’s (1997) Dry Earth—namely, a world\nwhere no one has ever had any contact with any kind of watery stuff,\nand all apparent contacts with it are always due to multi-sensory\nhallucination. If w is not Dry Earth, but Putnam’s\nTwin Earth, however, the counterfactual turns out to be\nfalse, as in this possible world people usually have contact with some\nother watery stuff that they call ‘water’. So, in this\nworld ‘water’ refers to a natural kind, though not to one\nhaving chemical composition H2O. Since\ndetermining which of Dry Earth or Twin Earth is\nmodally closer to the actual world (supposing s is in the\nactual world)—and so determining whether (d) is satisfied in\nWater—is a potentially elusive task, the claim that\nWater instantiates the disjunctive template appears\nto be less than fully warranted.\n [18] \nAn alternative dissolution of McKinsey paradox—also based on a\ndiagnosis of non-transmissivity—seems however to be available if\none considers the proposition (Q10) saying that s\n(or s’s linguistic community) has been embedded in an\nenvironment containing some watery substance (cf. Wright 2003\nand 2011). This alternative strategy assumes that Q10,\nrather than Q9, is a presupposition of s’s cognitive\nproject of attaining introspective justification for P9.\n \nEven if Water does not instantiate the disjunctive\ntemplate, a new diagnosis of what’s wrong with McKinsey paradox\ncould rest on the claim that the different argument yielded by\nexpanding Water with Q10 as conclusion\n— call it Water* — instantiates the\ndisjunctive template. If R is the same proposition displayed\nabove, it is easy to see that Water* satisfies conditions (d),\n(b) and (c*) of the disjunctive template. Furthermore (a) is\nsatisfied at least in the sense that it seems a priori that\nP9 via Q9 entails Q10 (if\nP10 is in background information) (cf. Wright 2011). On\nthis novel diagnosis of non-transmissivity, what would be paradoxical\nis that s could earn justification for Q10 in virtue\nof her non-empirical justification for P9 and\nP10 and her knowledge of the a priori link from\nP9, P10 via Q9 to Q10. If\none follows Wright’s (2003)\n suggestion[19]\n that s isentitled to accept Q10\n— namely to accept the presupposition that there is\na watery substance that provides ‘water’ with its\nextension — Water becomes innocuously\ntransmissive, and the apparent paradox surrounding Water\nvanishes. This is so at least if one grants that it is a priori that\nwater is the watery stuff of our actual acquaintance, once it is\npresupposed that there is any watery stuff of our actual acquaintance.\nFor useful criticism of responses of this type to McKinsey paradox see\nSainsbury (2000), Pritchard (2002), Brown (2003) and (2004),\nMcLaughlin (2003), McKinsey (2003) and Kallestrup (2011). \nAccording to a different interpretation, the paradox elicited by \nWater is to the effect that s would be in position to\nsettle the question—in the sense of removing\ndoubt—about whether she or her community have been embedded\nin an environment containing water by simply reflecting on the content\nof her mental states and by attending to some specific implication of\ncontent externalism, but without engaging in any empirical\ninvestigation. If one accepts this interpretation, a way to dissolve\nthe paradox is to show that Water is non-transmissive precisely\nin the sense that it is incapable of resolving doubt about its\nconclusion (cf. Davies 1998, 2000, 2003a and 2009). As we have seen in\nthe previous section, diagnoses of non-transmissivity as incapability\nof resolving doubt can be systematised by appealing to limitation\nprinciples. Consider then following limitation principle, which is\nalluded to—even if not explicitly formulated—in Davies\n(2009): \nSuppose the antecedent of (LP*) is satisfied by an argument that\ns has carried out. If s doubts the conclusion of the\nargument, s should also doubt at least one of its premises. So\nthe argument is unable to dispel doubt about its conclusion and it is\nnon-transmissive in this sense. It can be argued that Water\ndoes satisfy the antecedent of (LP*) so that it is non-transmissive in\nthis sense. \nTake E9 to be the theory of externalism about mental\ncontent. As we have already seen E9 gives s\njustification for believing P10 in Water—i.e.,\nthe conditional: ‘If I am thinking that water is wet, I have (or\nmy linguistic community has) been embedded in an environment that\ncontains water’. Note that E9 gives s\njustification for, not only P10, but also the following\nconditional: \nIf there is a content such as the proposition that water is wet to be\nthought by me, then (Q9) I have (or my linguistic community\nhas) been embedded in an environment that contains water. \nSuppose now that s doubts Q9. Since Q9 is\nthe consequent of the above conditional, which s accepts,\ns is committed to doubting its antecedent. So s has to\ndoubt that there is a content like the proposition that water is wet.\nBut s’s doubt that there is such a content for her to think\nrationally requires s to accept a defeater for her\njustification for believing P9 offered by her reflective\nevidence E10. For if there is no content like the\nproposition that water is wet for s to think, s cannot\nbe thinking that water is wet. In conclusion, it appears that\nWater satisfies the antecedent of (LP*), and thus seems to\nprove non-transmissive in the sense of not being able to resolve\nantecedent doubt about its conclusion.
