Dating back at least to Plato and Aristotle in the West,\nand Confucius in the East, philosophers have traditionally drawn on\nempirical data to some extent in their theorizing about character. One\nof the main differences in recent years has been the source of this\nempirical data, namely the work of social and personality\npsychologists on morally relevant thought and action.\n\n\nThis entry briefly examines four recent empirical approaches to moral\ncharacter. It will draw on the psychology literature where\nappropriate, but the main focus will be on the significance of that\nwork for philosophers interested in better understanding moral\ncharacter. The four areas are situationism, the CAPS model, the Big\nFive model, and the VIA. The remainder of this entry devotes a section\nto each of them.\n\nIn the late 1960s and 70s, what became the situationist movement in\npsychology took center stage. An intense ‘person-situation\ndebate’ ensued which called into question the existence of\ntraditional personality traits and even the need for the discipline of\npersonality psychology. Writers describing this era called it\n“traumatic” and “intense”, involving\n“warfare” and “heated but futile battles”\n(Mischel 2009: 283, 1999b: 39). By the 1980s, though, many\npsychologists parted ways with the situationist movement, and today\nvery few would subscribe to the claims that were advanced at that\ntime. \nThis entry will not delve into the debate in \npsychology (see Miller 2014: chapter 4 for extensive discussion).\nIt is mentioned in order to\nset the stage for the much later situationist movement in philosophy.\nThe main philosophers responsible for jumpstarting this discussion\nwere Gilbert Harman in a series of papers dating back to 1999, and\nJohn Doris in several papers and most importantly in his 2002 book,\nLack of Character: Personality and Moral Behavior (Harman\n1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2009; Doris 1998, 2002, 2010; and Merritt et\nal. 2010. For others supporting their views, see Blackburn 1998:\n36–37; Campbell 1999; Hurka 2001: 44; Goldie 2004: chapter 3; Vranas 2005;\nAppiah 2008: chapter 2; Upton 2009; Badhwar 2009; Sarkissian 2010; and\nAlfano 2013). Broadly speaking, Harman and Doris used studies and\nclaims that were influential during the situationist movement in\npsychology, and applied them to debates in contemporary ethical\ntheory. In particular, their focus was on how the empirical data, as\nthey interpreted it, could cause trouble for Aristotelian virtue\nethics. \nTheir broad argumentative strategy proceeded in two stages: Stage One.\nDraw on studies in psychology to show that people typically do not\nhave what they call global character traits. Stage Two.\nShow that this is a serious problem for Aristotelian virtue ethics, as\nwell as any other view in normative ethics which is committed in some\ncentral way to global character traits. \nFirst we need to clarify what global character traits are before\ndiving into the details of the two stages. According to Doris, global\ncharacter traits have two main features: Consistency.\nCharacter traits are reliably manifested in trait-relevant behavior\nacross a diversity of trait-relevant eliciting conditions that may\nvary widely in their conduciveness to the manifestation of the trait\nin question. Stability.\nCharacter traits are reliably manifested in trait-relevant behavior\nover iterated trials of similar trait-relevant eliciting conditions\n(Doris 2002: 22. A third feature he mentions, evaluative integration,\ndoes not factor much into his discussion.). \nAn example would help. Consider temperance. A person with this trait\nis expected to exhibit it over time in the same kind of situation, say\nwhen eating at restaurants. But she is also expected to exhibit it\nacross situations which are relevant to the trait, such as drinking,\nsexual activity, and so forth, as well as eating at home, eating at\nairports, eating with friends, eating alone, and the like. The same is\ntrue for other examples of what we might call\n“traditional” virtues, such as courage, honesty, and\nkindness. Vices like cruelty and dishonesty count as global character\ntraits as well. \nWith this background in place, let us turn to the two stages. \nOn the basis of certain studies in psychology,\nHarman and Doris reasoned roughly as follows (this reconstruction is from Miller 2014: 192): \nThe “behaving in a certain kind of way” is behaving\nvirtuously. This could pertain to behaving virtuously over time in the\nsame situations (stability) or behaving virtuously across situations\n(cross-situational consistency). \nHarman and Doris did not take the experimental evidence to challenge\nthe stability of character traits. As we will see below, they were\nhappy to accept the widespread possession of what they called\n“local” character traits which are restricted to narrow\nsituations like eating at home. Instead, their focus was on the\ncross-situational consistency of global traits. There they thought\nthere is good empirical reason to believe most people do not have\nvirtues and vices which exhibit consistent behavior across\ntrait-relevant situations. \nOne way they could have argued for this was by examining the\npsychological literature with respect to a variety of different kinds\nof moral behavior, such as stealing, helping, eating, hurting, and so\nforth, and seeing whether the data was compatible with the\ncorresponding virtue (or vice). Instead, though, Harman and Doris\nchose the strategy of focusing in great detail on just one\nvirtue—compassion—and using the literature in psychology\non pro-social behavior. \nThe choice of compassion made a great deal of sense given the state of\nthe empirical literature. There are numerous studies that have been\ndone over the past sixty years on helping behavior, in contrast to\nother kinds of morally relevant behavior which might pertain to other\nvirtues. Nevertheless, Harman and Doris did not take the conclusion of\ntheir argument to apply just to one virtue, and so expected that\nfuture studies in other areas of morality, when combined with whatever\nstudies we currently have, would tell a similar story about absent\nvirtue. \nFocusing on helping and compassion, here are three of the studies\nwhich occupied a central place in their discussion: \nDime in the Phone Booth.\nThe psychologists Isen and Levin had an experimental group find a dime\nin the coin return slot of a phone booth, whereas the control group\ndid not. Individuals in both groups subsequently had a chance to help\npick up dropped papers. 88% in the experimental group helped; only 4%\nin the control group did (Isen and Levin 1972). There were replication\nproblems with this study, but there are many other studies on the\neffect of mood on helping which found a similar pattern (see Miller\n2013: chapter 3). \nLady in Distress.\nIn the 1969 “Lady in Distress” experiment, participants\nheard a loud crash in the next room together with a woman’s\nscream. It sounded like a bookshelf had topped down on her, and cries\nof pain quickly followed. The question was whether participants would\ndo anything to help. Those who were by themselves helped 70% of the\ntime. But shockingly, if a participant was in the same room with a\nstranger who didn’t do anything to respond, helping happened only\n7% of the time (Latané and Rodin 1969: 193–195;\nLatané and Darley 1970: 60–63). \nObedience to Authority.\nStanley Milgram’s shock experiments are arguably the most famous\nin the history of psychology.  Especially relevant is experiment five,\nwhere a participant had to give a test to an innocent person in\nanother room, and turn up a dial with increasingly greater shocks for\neach wrong answer. At 270 volts, the test taker demanded to be\nreleased from the test and was making agonizing screams. At higher\nlevels the pleas became desperate and hysterical. Nevertheless, under\npressure from an authority figure, 80% of participants went at least\nto 270 volts, and 65% went all the way to the 450 volt XXX level,\nwhich was a lethal level of shock (so they thought) (Milgram 1974:\n60). \nOther studies include the Princeton Theological Seminary hurry study\n(Darley and Batson 1973) and the Zimbardo prison experiment (Haney et\nal. 1973). \nHow are these studies supposed to tell against the widespread\npossession of the virtue of compassion? It isn’t just that they\nshow people behaving less than virtuously in all three experimental\nsituations. After all, when participants found a dime, or when\nparticipants were alone in the next room, they did tend to\nhelp. In another version of the Milgram setup, when participants at\nthe 150 volt level heard commands from two authority figures which\ncontradicted either other, they immediately stopped at that level or\none more level above it (Milgram 1974: 95, 105–107). \nRather, the alleged conflict with the virtue of compassion stems from\nthe apparent failure on behalf of most participants to be\nappropriately sensitive to the morally relevant considerations. A\ncompassionate person would not exhibit helping which is sensitive in\nthis way to finding a dime, or which is sensitive (in an emergency) to\nthe presence of an unresponsive bystander. Nor would they be so\ninsensitive to the screams and eventual death of a test\ntaker. As Harman and Doris wrote,  \nboth disappointing omissions and appalling actions are\nreadily induced through seemingly minor situations. What\nmakes these findings so striking is just how insubstantial\nthe situational influences that produce troubling moral failures seem\nto be (Merritt et al. 2010: 357, emphasis theirs; see also Doris\n1998: 507, 2002: 2, 28, 35–36; Harman 2003: 90). \nIt is important to be clear on exactly what Harman and Doris took\nthemselves to be arguing (here drawing on Miller 2014: 193–194).\nThey should not be read as advancing the following: \nOn metaphysical grounds the property of being compassionate\ndoes not exist. \nThis is a matter of debate for metaphysics, and is not something that\nthese psychology experiments could establish. Furthermore, they should\nnot be read as arguing for the strong empirical claim that: \nNo human being has ever had any of the traditional virtues or vices\nsuch as compassion, either as a matter of psychological necessity or\nas a matter of contingent fact. \nDoris admitted that, as far as the studies themselves showed,\nthere could be a few virtuous and a few vicious people (Doris 2002:\n60, 65, 112, 122; see also Vranas 2005: 16). \nAt the same time, it would be a mistake to think that they were only\narguing for an absence of evidence claim like: \nGiven the psychological evidence, we are not justified in believing on\nthe basis of that evidence that most people possess the traditional\nvirtues or vices such as compassion. \nThey did indeed accept this, but they also made stronger claims as\nwell. Harman said that, “it may even be the case that there is\nno such thing as character” (Harman 1999: 328; for recent\nqualifications, see Harman 2009: 238, 241). Doris argued that,\n“people typically lack character” (Doris 1998: 506, 2002:\n2). In a co-authored article with Maria Merritt they together said\nthat, “Behavior is not typically ordered by robust\ntraits” (Merritt et al. 2010: 358, emphasis theirs). \nHere, then, is how to understand their conclusion: \nGiven the psychological evidence, we are justified in believing on the\nbasis of that evidence that most people do not possess the\ntraditional virtues or vices such as compassion. \nWith this in mind, let us turn to the second stage of their\nargument. \nHarman and Doris took the conclusion that most people do not possess\ntraditional virtues or vices and tried to show that it had problematic\nconsequences for certain positions in ethical theory. Specifically,\ntheir main target was a broadly Aristotelian form of virtue ethics, as\nwell as any other theories which made use of empirical claims about\nglobal character traits. \nHere is Harman first, writing about Aristotelian views:  \nthis sort of virtue ethics presupposes that there are character traits\nof the relevant sort, that people differ in what character traits they\nhave, and these traits help to explain differences in the way people\nbehave (Harman 1999: 319).  \nNext here is Doris in his 1998 paper:  \nAristotelian virtue ethics, when construed as invoking a generally\napplicable descriptive psychology…[is] subject to damaging\nempirical criticism (Doris 1998: 520).  \nTheir shared assumption seems to be that Aristotelians make not only\nnormative but also empirical claims, in particular that the moral\nvirtues and/or vices are widely held by most people (see also Merritt\n2000: 366; Sreenivasan 2002: 48, 57, 63; Sabini and Silver 2005: 538).\nGiven that in the first stage they argued this is empirically\ndisconfirmed, it follows that Aristotelian virtue ethics is highly\nproblematic. \nIn his 2002 book, Doris’s focus seemed to shift. Instead of\ntrying to show that the lack of virtue and vice provided evidence for\nthe falsity of Aristotelian virtue ethics, he instead appeared to take\nthe main upshot to be one about practicality, namely that virtue\nethics would no longer be practically relevant for most people who did\nnot have these traits (2002: chapter 6). \nHere in this second stage it is hard to pin down exactly how the\nargument was supposed to go. But Harman and Doris did succeed in\ngenerating a lot of interest in these issues, mostly among\nphilosophers who ended up being critical of their work.  \nThe remainder of this section briefly distinguishes seven leading\nresponses to Harman and Doris’s situationist argument, and then\nconcludes with some comments about what our characters might look like\nif indeed we do not have the traditional virtues. \nThe responses are organized based on whether they address the first or\nthe second stage of the Harman and Doris argument.  The following responses address the argument against global\ncharacter traits. Deficiencies of Particular Experiments for Evaluating\nCharacter.\nA natural question to ask is whether the experiments cited by Harman\nand Doris really do show that most people lack the virtue of\ncompassion. Several philosophers have argued that they do not. \nFor instance, Miller (2003) raised questions about Dime in the\nPhone Booth. Serious concerns have arisen about the Zimbardo prison experiment, with calls to remove it from psychology textbooks (Blum 2018). Others have not been convinced that the Milgram experiments and the Darley and Batson Princeton Seminary experiment\nshed much light on the possession of compassion (see Sreenivasan 2002:\n60–61; Annas 2003: 14 (see Other Internet Resources); Adams 2006: 147; Snow 2010: 103–107,\n111–116. For general discussion of this line of response, see\nMontmarquet 2003: 365–368; Russell 2009: 279–287). \nIf a sufficient number of studies are called into question this way,\nthen stage one of the argument would not go through, and hence it\nwould not matter how exactly the second stage of the argument was\nmeant to go (for criticism of this response, see Russell 2009:\n279–287). Competing Virtues.\nThis next response can be seen as a different version of the previous\none. It calls into question the first stage of the Harman/Doris\nargument by suggesting that the results of the relevant studies are\nbest interpreted, not as demonstrating a lack of virtue, but rather as\nsuggesting the contribution of competing virtues. Or a weaker version\nof this response would say that, at the very least, Harman and Doris\nhave not done enough to rule out this hypothesis. \nFor instance, instead of saying that the standard Milgram experiment\nis evidence that most participants did not have the virtue of\ncompassion, perhaps a better interpretation is to say that their\ncompassion was being outweighed by the work of another virtue which\nseemed at the time to have greater priority (perhaps mistakenly). One\ncandidate for this virtue could be obedience. Or take the Lady in\nDistress study. Here again participants might have had their\ncompassion outweighed by another virtue, such as trust, as they\nfollowed the example of the other person in the room who did not\nrespond. Additional candidates for competing virtues could likewise be\nfound for the other studies that get mentioned in this debate (for\ndiscussion see Solomon 2003: 53, 55–56; Kamtekar 2004: 473;\nKristjánsson 2008: 64–65; Snow 2010: 106. For criticism\nsee Harman 2003: 91; Prinz 2009: 123; Russell 2009: 282–283,\n286). Mental States are Important Too.\nOne claim commonly made in the situationist literature in psychology,\nwas that so-called “situational forces”, as opposed to\nglobal character traits or even more familiar folk mental states such\nas beliefs and desires, are part of the best explanation for our\nbehavior (see for instance Ross and Nisbett 1991: 59; Sabini and\nSilver 2005: 546–554). In a paper published in the\njournal Ethics in 2005, the leading psychologists John Sabini\nand Maury Silver engaged with the work of Harman and Doris by\nprimarily criticizing this claim. Their approach was to reassess the\nleading studies such as Lady in Distress, in order to show\nthat mental states and perhaps even character traits are indeed\ncentral to explaining the results. Summarizing their view, they wrote\nthat,  \nPeople who must act in such circumstances are confused and inhibited\nby the anticipation of embarrassment, and that we argue is the lesson\nto be drawn from social psychological research. People are also, we\nsuggest, unaware of how potent fear of embarrassment is as a\nmotivation for behavior (Sabini and Silver 2005: 559). \nThus in contrast to the claim about situational forces, Sabini and\nSilver held that psychological causes such as fear of embarrassment\nare ineliminable from the best explanation and prediction of morally\nrelevant behavior. But they did accept that these studies provide\nsupport for the influence of, “features of the immediate\nsituation which are not in themselves of moral significance”\n(2005: 561). So putting the pieces together, they seemed to hold that\npsychological dispositions do exist and constitute various character\ntraits, but those character traits end up not being virtuous (for a\nsimilar line of response, see Kupperman 2001: 245–247; Solomon\n2003: 48, 56; Wielenberg 2006: 471–490; for criticism see\nRussell 2009: 288; Merritt et al. 2010: 367–369). CAPS.  Philosophers such as Nancy Snow and Daniel\nRussell have made use of the “cognitive-affective personality\nsystem” or “CAPS” model in psychology, in developing\nan Aristotelian response to situationism (Miller 2003; Adams 2006:\n131–138; Russell 2009: chapters 8–10; Snow 2010: chapter\n1). Because the CAPS model will be covered in the next section,\ndiscussion of this response is postponed until then. The remaining responses address the link from the evidence against\nglobal character traits, to the conclusion that Aristotelian virtue ethics is problematic. Rarity. Perhaps the most widely used response by defenders\nof Aristotelian virtue ethics, the rarity response just denies that\nany reasonable form of the view is committed to the empirical claim\nthat most people have the virtues.  Instead, virtue ethics could be\ntrue as a normative theory while as a matter of contingent fact people\nin a given society are doing a poor job of acquiring the virtues (for\na few references among many, see DePaul 1999: 150–153; Miller\n2003; Kamtekar 2004: 466; Wielenberg 2006: 490; Russell 2009: 170; for\ncriticism of the response, see Annas 2003 (see Other Internet Resources), 2011: 173; Russell 2009:\n284). \nThis is not an ad hoc revision to the view designed to defend\nit against situationist challenges. Plato and Aristotle long ago\nthought that virtue is rare, as have most philosophers working on\ncharacter throughout the intervening years (see DePaul 1999 on Plato\nand Nicomachean Ethics 1099b29–32, 1103b16–31,\n1152a30–34, 1179b25–29, 1180a1–5, 15–19). As\nAristotle wrote,  \nthe many naturally obey fear, not shame; they avoid what is base\nbecause of the penalties, not because it is disgraceful. For since\nthey live by their feelings, they pursue their proper pleasures and\nthe sources of them, and avoid the opposed pains, and have not even a\nnotion of what is fine and truly pleasant, since they have had no\ntaste of it (Nicomachean Ethics 1179b11–16). \nWrong Conception of Aristotelian Character. Some\nAristotelians acknowledged that Harman and Doris succeeded in raising\nproblems for the empirical adequacy of a certain picture of character\ntraits, but they complained that this picture is not a sufficiently\nnuanced and sophisticated Aristotelian one. Hence Rachana Kamtekar\nwrote,  \nthe character traits conceived of as debunked by situationist social\npsychological studies have very little to do with character as it is\nconceived of in traditional virtue ethics. Traditional virtue ethics\noffers a conception of character far superior to the one under attack\nby situationism (Kamtekar 2004: 460; for similar claims, see DePaul\n1999: 149–150; Kupperman 2001: 241–243; Annas 2003: 13\n(see Other Internet Resources), 2011: 172–176). \nKamtekar noted several differences. One is that, on the Aristotelian\npicture, virtues are supposed to be, “dispositions to respond\nappropriately—in judgment, feeling, and action—to\none’s situation” (2004: 477). Furthermore, Aristotle was\nclear that they require practical wisdom, which is a\n“disposition to deliberate well about what conduces to the good\nlife in general” (2004: 480). And while the virtues do require\ncross-situational consistency, this needs to be handled carefully,\nsince it is consistency relative to the individual’s own outlook\non life, as shaped by her values, goals, plans, and the like. So to\noutside observers, someone might be acting very inconsistently, but\nfrom her own perspective the pattern of behavior makes perfect sense\n(2004: 485, for criticism of this response, see Adams 2006: 121; Sosa\n2009: 280–283; Merritt et al. 2010: 358–360). \nAristotelian Conception of Character is the Wrong\nConception. Other participants in this discussion have shown less\ninterest in defending Aristotelian conceptions of character. Instead\nthey wanted to see what non-Aristotelian accounts have to offer, and\nwhether they can better accommodate studies like those cited\nabove. Three examples of philosophers who have gone in this direction\nare Maria Merritt, who supported a Humean account, Eric Wielenberg,\nwho supported a Kantian account, and Edward Slingerland, who supported\na Confucian account (Merritt 2000; Wielenberg 2006: 466, 469;\nSlingerland 2011). \nThis is not the place to evaluate these different responses and see\nwhich if any of them is the strongest. It is important to note,\nhowever, that they should not be treated in isolation. For instance,\nsomeone might combine a first stage response such as Mental States\nare Important Too with a second stage response such as\nRarity. \nLet me conclude this discussion with two points. First, we should briefly consider what the empirical story about character might look like if we grant that most\npeople do not have the traditional virtues. After all, philosophers\ncan accept that conclusion without having to accept the arguments\nHarman and Doris offered drawing on the experimental literature. As\nnoted already, Plato and Aristotle both accepted it, as have many\nothers. \nHere, then, are a few of the leading options for what a positive story\nabout most people’s actual character might look like: \nClearly much additional work is needed to better understand how our\ncharacters are actually put together. \nThe second point is that discussions in philosophy of situationism are showing no signs of slowing down, even twenty years after Harman and Doris’s original work appeared. A significant development, for instance, has been to extend the debate to the epistemic virtues and vices, with potentially troubling implications arising for certain forms of virtue epistemology (Alfano 2012; Doris and Olin 2014; Alfano and Fairweather 2017). A number of other topics related to situationism remain underexplored (for examples, see Miller 2017).  \nOne thread left over from the previous section had to do with the\nso-called “cognitive-affective personality system” or\n“CAPS” model. It will take a bit of work to introduce the\nmodel. But it is worth doing, since CAPS is currently receiving a lot\nof attention in the situationist literature in philosophy (Miller\n2003; Adams 2006: 131–138; Russell 2009: chapters 8–10;\nSnow 2010: chapter 1). Plus, regardless of its relevance to that\nliterature, the CAPS model might have some important resources of its\nown to offer as an empirical approach to thinking about character.\nThis section first provides the needed background before turning to\nsome of the philosophical implications. \nWalter Mischel is often hailed as the leader of the situationist\nmovement in psychology, especially in his 1968 book Personality\nand Assessment. But as he notes in a 1973 paper, that book  \nhas been widely misunderstood to imply that people show no\nconsistencies, that individual differences are unimportant, and that\n“situations” are the main determinants of behavior (Mischel 1973: 254).  \nIndeed, he writes, it  \nwould be wasteful to create pseudo-controversies that pit person\nagainst situation in order to see which is more important (Mischel\n1973: 255–256).  \nDuring the subsequent decades, he proceeded to develop what came to be\nknown as the CAPS model, along with the help of Yuichi Shoda and Jack\nWright among others (for a leading statement of the model, see Mischel\nand Shoda 1995). Here we focus on just a few features of the model, in\nparticular cognitive-affective units,\nif…then…situation-behavior contingencies,\npsychologically salient features of situations, and intraindividual\nbehavioral signatures. \nCognitive-affective units are the basic building blocks of\nthe CAPS model. They are not global character traits, but rather\nspecific mental states and processes. Here is Mischel’s list\nfrom the 1973 paper (Mischel 1973: 265, 275; for an updated version,\nsee Mischel and Shoda 1995: 252): \nDespite this sophisticated terminology, what Mischel is referring to\nis perfectly familiar. The first item has to do with instrumental\nbeliefs (beliefs about the best means to an end), the second with\ndesires, the third with goals and plans, and the final two with\ngeneral capacities to process incoming information and perform mental\nand physical behaviors (for further discussion, see Mischel 1973,\n1984: 353, 2004: 4–5, 11, 2009: 284; Shoda 1999:\n165–171). \nIf-then situation-behavior contingencies are\nanother central feature of the CAPS model. These contingencies are\nconditional statements representing some facet of an\nindividual’s personality, where the “if” is a\nsituation and the “then” is a behavior. For example,\nMischel and his colleagues studied children’s behavior at a\nsummer treatment camp. They found in one case that if a child was\nteased by a peer, then he would be unlikely to exhibit verbal\naggression. The same was not true, though, for another child (for\nrelevant data from this camp, see Mischel 1984: 361–362; Wright\nand Mischel 1987; and Shoda et al. 1993, 1994). This difference can be\nexplained by appealing to their different cognitive-affective units.\nSome children might want to hurt someone who is teasing them, whereas\nothers may want to run away (for more on individual differences in the\nCAPS model, see Mischel and Shoda 1995: 253, 1998: 237–240,\n2008: 211–212). More generally, Mischel and Shoda write that,\n \nFeatures of situations activate a set of internal reactions—not\njust cognitive but also affective—based on the\nindividual’s prior experience with those features (Mischel and\nShoda 1995: 251).  \nAnd those reactions can lead to subsequent behavior. \nThis distinction is always taken to be central to CAPS, and figures prominently in the\nrecent philosophical literature on character (for two examples, see Russell 2009: chapters 8 to 10; Snow 2010: chapter 1). Psychologically salient features are defined\nas:  \nthe features of the situation that have significant meaning for a\ngiven individual or type, and that are related to the experienced\npsychological situation—the thoughts and affects and goals that\nbecome activated within the personality system (Mischel 2004: 15).\n \nNominal characteristics are defined as more generic features that\nthird party observers would use in describing a situation, such as the\nphysical location, time, or event. Examples include being at the\nbowling alley, eating lunch, doing taxes, talking on the computer with\nSmith, and watching a movie (this distinction is related to the technical terminology in psychology of idiographic versus nomothetic approaches. Very roughly, idiographic approaches use criteria supplied by the participant in question, whereas nomothetic approaches use criteria supply by individuals besides the participant. For careful discussion, see Lamiell 1997). \nThe idea is that situations might seem very different to observers on\nthe basis of their nominal features, but to the person in question\nthere could be important similarities (or vice versa). For\ninstance, a person could perceive criticism of himself at the bowling\nalley and the office, and use the same defensive strategies in both\ncases even though they might seem to be so different in other\nrespects. The more general lesson is that psychologists need to pay\nattention to both nominal and psychologically salient features of\nsituations when studying personality. \nPutting all these pieces together, we can introduce the next component\nof the CAPS model, the intraindividual behavioral\nsignature. Rather than focusing on the individual’s\nbehavior in just one situation, the behavioral signature depicts her\npattern of behavior across multiple situations. And what individuates\nthe situations is their psychologically relevant features. For\ninstance, Mischel and colleagues came up with behavioral signatures\nfor the children at the summer camp, by examining their aggressive\nbehavior across situations such as peer teasing, “when\napproached by a peer”, and “when warned by an adult\ncounselor” (Shoda 1999: 160). Not surprisingly, the children\ntended to behave differently from one situation to the next. Thus the\nCAPS model,  \npredicts that the person’s behavior in a domain will change from\none situation to another—when the if changes, so will\nthe then—even if the personality system were to remain\nentirely unchanged (Mischel and Shoda 1995: 257, emphasis theirs).\n \n(For more on behavioral signatures, see Shoda et al. 1994:\n675–678, Mischel and Shoda 1995: 249, 251, 255, 258, 1998: 242,\n245, 2008: 208, 224, 228, 233.) \nLet me stop the presentation of CAPS at this point, although there is\nmuch more to the view. Mischel offers a helpful summary of what we\nhave covered thus far: \nAs the person experiences situations that contain different\npsychological features, different [cognitive-affective units] and\ntheir characteristic interrelationships become activated in relation\nto these features. Consequently, the activation of\n[cognitive-affective units] changes from one time to another and from\none situation to another…Although cognitions and affects that\nare activated at a given time change, how they change, that\nis, the sequence and pattern of their activation, remains stable,\nreflecting the stable structure of the organization within the system.\nThe result is a distinctive pattern of\nif…then…relations, or behavioral signatures,\nmanifested as the individual moves across different situations (2004:\n11, emphasis his). \nWith this in mind, let us now turn to some of the philosophical\nimplications. \nLeaving aside the situationism debate for a moment, is there anything\nin the CAPS model, at least as presented above, which could be\nrelevant to philosophers working on character? To address this\nquestion, we first need to connect CAPS to character traits, as\nnothing thus far in this section has explicitly mentioned traits. \nMischel and company are not very helpful when it comes to making this\nconnection. They say different things about traits in different\nplaces, sometimes wanting to distance themselves from traits and other\ntimes seeming to embrace them. When they do embrace them, they\nunderstand them in different ways, for instance as causal dispositions\n(in some passages) or as mere summaries of past behavior (in other\nplaces). \nRather than get bogged down in textual interpretation of\nMischel’s work, we can simply note that there appears to be a\nstraightforward path from the CAPS model to the acceptance of\ncharacter traits understood as causal dispositions to think, feel, and\nact in various ways (see Mumford 1998: 182; Kamtekar 2004: 472, 477;\nAdams 2006: 131–138; Badhwar 2009: 279; Russell 2009: xii, 172,\n292–293, 330; Sosa 2009: 279; Lukes 2009: 292). We have seen\nthat the CAPS model already accepts dispositions to form, say,\ninstrumental beliefs, desires, values, and goals. These were among the\n“cognitive-affective units”. These units tend to be\nrelatively enduring psychological structures in a person’s mind,\nthey are sensitive to their own activating conditions, and, upon being\nactivated, they serve to cause the formation of occurrent mental\nstates like beliefs and (other things being equal) behavior. They are\nalso the basis for true “if…then…”\nconditionals, as we saw earlier. \nTo take an example, I am disposed to be afraid of rats. So if one\nlands on my bed, I am likely to run away (to say the least). Upon\nseeing a rat, my fear of rats would be triggered, leading to an\noccurrent feeling of fear of this rat at this particular moment, which\nconnects with other mental goings-on that together lead me to run. \nThis last bit about other mental goings-on is important. My\ndisposition to fear rats is connected to all kinds of other\npsychological dispositions, such as a disposition to believe that rats\ncarry diseases and that I should run away from them, a desire to not\ncatch any diseases from rats, and so forth. In other words, the CAPS\nmodel accepts that there are clusters of interrelated mental\nstate dispositions, and that upon being activated they cause multiple\noccurrent thoughts and feelings to be formed. As Mischel and Shoda\nwrite,  \ncognitive-affective representations and affective states interact\ndynamically and influence each other reciprocally. It is the\norganization of the relationships among them that forms the core of\nthe personality structure and that guides and constrains their\neffects (2008: 211, see also 212, 219, 233).  \nThese clusters are typically not fleeting, they can explain the true\n“if…then…” conditionals, and they are\nmanifest in the person’s behavioral signature over time. So if I\nsee a rat on my bed, I will tend to behave a certain way. Similarly if\na few months later I see a rat in the kitchen, and so forth. \nBut now that we have clusters of psychological dispositions, we have\neverything we need for a person to have moral character traits too.\nFor we can just equate a moral character trait with a cluster\nof cognitive-affective units which pertain to a given moral domain (as\nMischel seems willing to do in some places; see Mischel and Shoda\n1995: 257; Mischel 1999a: 456). Furthermore, they will be traits with\ncausal powers, since the psychological dispositions which are their\ncomponents have causal powers. Plus they can be global character\ntraits too—they can be activated in a variety of different\nsituations. In my simple example, the cluster of psychological\ndispositions associated with my seeing rats can be activated in\nsituations ranging from the office to the pool to the bedroom. The\nsame could be true for clusters which are more centrally morally\nrelevant. But it is also important to note that the CAPS model by\nitself does not entail that there are global traits—one could\naccept only highly narrow or local traits instead. This is an\nempirical matter. \nHence it appears that philosophers may have found a rich psychological\nmodel to use in helping them to develop a more empirically informed\naccount of character traits. This model would allow for character\ntraits to exist, and for them to be widespread, have causal powers,\nand be grounded in enduring psychological structures which are already\nfamiliar from the philosophy of mind. \nTwo points of caution are worth making, though. The first concerns the\nrelevance of CAPS in responding to situationism. As we just noted, the\nCAPS model does not by itself support the widespread possession of\nglobal as opposed to local character traits. Furthermore, even if we\njust focus on global character traits, the model does not—by\nitself—provide any reason to think that the character traits\nmost people have are the traditional moral virtues like honesty. They\ncould be moral vices, or mixed traits, or something else altogether.\nSo it turns out that Harman and Doris could accept much of the CAPS\nmodel, and still advance the first stage of their situationist\nargument for the conclusion that most people do not have the\ntraditional moral virtues. \nSecondly, while it would take more space than is available here to\nproperly explore, another reason for caution about the relevance of\nCAPS has to do with whether it provides much of a theoretical advance\nover commonsense folk psychology about the mind. The language of\ncognitive-affective units, if…then…situation-behavior\ncontingencies, psychologically salient features of situations, and\nintraindividual behavioral signatures might sound impressive, but\nstripped away of this jargon, the model might not have much new to\noffer to philosophers. Even some psychologists have expressed this\nworry. For instance John Johnson, in a 1999 commentary in European\nJournal of Personality, wrote: \nOne limitation of the CAPS model is its failure to advance our\nscientific understanding of personality dynamics beyond how we already\nunderstand human action from common sense. As far as I can tell, the\nlabeling and re-labeling of desires, beliefs, and abilities has simply\nreflected the psychological jargon popular at that point in\nhistory…I am surprised and somewhat depressed about the\nenthusiasm for the CAPS model, but not because the model is wrong. The\nproblem is that settling for this model indicates that we are content\nto merely re-label common sense concepts with jargon, as opposed to\ndeveloping a truly scientific model of personality dynamics (Johnson\n1999: 449–450). \nJohnson focused here on the cognitive-affective units, but his claims\napply more generally to the rest of the CAPS model. \nNone of this calls into question the truth of the CAPS model. It just\nraises a concern about how much of an advance the model will prove to\nbe to philosophers working on character, if it turns out to not offer\nany additional theoretical insights, explanatory resources, or novel\npredictions beyond what philosophers can infer based on their own\ncareful reflection on folk psychology (for much more on these issues,\nsee Miller 2016). \nBack to psychology for a moment. As time went on, the situationist\nmovement ended up not ushering in the downfall of the study of\npersonality. In fact, global character traits have come to dominate\nthe field of personality psychology. The primary reason for this has\nbeen the emergence of the Big Five or Five-Factor model. Today the Big\nFive personality traits are all the rage, with thousands of papers appearing in\njournals in recent years. Now one sees the study of global personality traits\ndescribed in terms of a “renaissance” with “real\nprogress toward consensus” after “decades of\nfloundering” (McCrae and Costa 2003: 21, 20, 2008: 159). \nSurprisingly, though, philosophers have said almost nothing about the\nBig Five (for exceptions see Doris 2002: 67–71; Snow 2010:\n11–12; Slingerland 2011: 397; Miller 2014: chapter 6). This section first provides some background from the\npsychology literature, before raising some relevant philosophical\nissues. \nThe Big Five model is a taxonomy of personality traits. But before jumping into the details, something should be said, even if too briefly, about the relationship between personality traits and character traits. Strikingly, for many decades in the twentieth century, psychologists rarely invoked the language of “character traits,” although in recent years this has been changing. The historical story is complex and beyond the scope of this article, but one factor responsible for this aversion was the rise of positivism and its dismal of value-laden concepts from scientific investigation, with “character” begin regarded as one such concept. Another factor was the rise of situationism in social psychology and its related skepticism about the empirical adequacy of traditional character traits (for more see Peterson and Seligman 2004: 55-9).\n \n\tSuch factors do not play as much of a role in the recent history of psychology, but questions remain about how to classify traits, especially personality and character traits. On one approach, for instance, they are the very same thing. A trait like extraversion would be both a personality trait and a character trait. An alternative approach, and one likely favored by philosophers working on character, is to claim that character traits are only one kind of personality trait. How then would we distinguish between character versus non-character personality traits? \n \n\tThere are several answers that can be given, but no consensus about what is the right one. One answer is to say that the key issue is responsibility; a character trait is a personality trait for which a person who possesses it is (at least to some degree) responsible for doing so. Another answer is to say that the key issue has to do with normative standards; a character trait is a personality trait for which a person who has it is, in that respect, an appropriate object of normative assessment by the relevant norms (for details about these approaches, see Miller 2014: chapter one).\n \n\tBut instead of unpacking these issues more, let’s turn to the Big Five directly. Starting mainly in the 1980s, psychologists arrived at the Big Five\ntaxonomy using two different paths (McCrae and John 1992:\n181–187; Goldberg 1993: 30; for a review of earlier work, see\nJohn et al. 2008a). Lewis Goldberg is most famously associated with\nthe first. He held that we can learn about personality traits from\nordinary language, as over long periods of time the way we speak is\nshaped by the different ways people tend to be. Here is one statement\nof his so-called “lexical hypothesis”: \nThe most promising of the empirical approaches to systematizing\npersonality differences have been based on one critical assumption:\nThose individual differences that are of the most significance in the\ndaily transactions of persons with each other will eventually become\nencoded in their language…[this] has a highly significant\ncorollary: The more important is an individual difference in human\ntransactions, the more languages will have an item for it (Goldberg\n1981: 141–142, see also Saucier and Goldberg 1996b). \nUsing this idea, Goldberg compiled long lists of trait words found in\nordinary language. These are three adjectives from his 1992 list of\n100 Unipolar Markers (Goldberg 1992: 41): \nTo pare down his list, Goldberg asked study participants to rate from\n1 (extremely inaccurate) to 9 (extremely accurate) how well a\nparticular trait described themselves or others. Then using factor\nanalysis, Goldberg could see which trait adjectives are closely\nrelated to each other, thereby making it reasonable to posit a\n“factor” or “latent variable” which could\nserve as a more fundamental underlying trait (Goldberg 1990, 1992,\n1993 and Saucier and Goldberg 1996a; for an introduction to factor\nanalysis in psychology, see Leary 2004: 187–192). Fearful and\nfretful, not surprisingly, were highly correlated, and were\ncategorized under the heading of “neuroticism” in the Big\nFive. \nA separate line of research also arrived at the Big Five taxonomy.\nHere the idea was not to use trait adjectives, but rather to give\nparticipants entire sentences to use as part of a personality\nquestionnaire. That way, some confusion could be avoided if, for\nexample, they did not know what a word like “fretful”\nmeant. \nWhile there are many personality questionnaire used in Big Five\nresearch (such as the NEO-FFI, HEXACO, TDA, BFAS, and BFI), it appears\nthat the NEO-PI-R, developed by the prominent personality\npsychologists Robert McCrae and Paul Costa, continues to be the most\npopular choice. Here are three examples of items participants might\nhave to respond to in taking it (NEO-PI-R Item Booklet-Form S: 3): \nThey would be asked to respond on a 1 to 5 scale anchored on\nstrongly disagree to strongly agree. Factor analysis\nwould then be run on this questionnaire data as well. \nBy now many such analyses have been performed with both adjective and\nquestionnaire data, and using self, friend, spouse, employer, and\nexpert reports (McCrae 1982; McCrae and Costa 1987; Piedmont 1998:\n52–56, chapter 5). Extensive cross-cultural work has also been\ndone with the items being translated into dozens of languages (McCrae\nand Costa 1997; Piedmont\n1998: 43–46, 73–74; Caprara and Cervone 2000:\n73–75). What we see over and over again is the emergence of five\nbasic or core personality traits (for a very helpful review, see John\net al. 2008a): \nThe central idea is this. Take any given person. You can capture much\n(some Big Five researchers would even say all) there is to her\npersonality by determining her standing on these five dimensions. In a\nlarge group of people, you would naturally expect to see differences\nin their comparative standings, with some individuals being high on\nagreeableness and others not, for instance. \nNot only can you arrive at Big Five personality ratings for a given\nperson, but studies have found that you can use those ratings to\npredict other important information about her as well, including what\nkinds of thoughts, behavior, and consequences of her behavior you\nmight expect to see (for helpful reviews, Ozer and\nBenet-Martínez 2006; Roberts et al. 2007; Funder 2007: chapter\n7; John et al. 2008a: 141–143). For example, those who are high\nin conscientiousness have been found to avoid risky behaviors (Bogg\nand Roberts 2004) and to have greater success on various job\nperformance criteria (Mount and Barrick 1998). In contrast, high\nneuroticism predicts job dissatisfaction and criminal behavior\n(perhaps not surprisingly) (Ozer and Benet-Martínez 2006). \nThe five personality traits in the Big Five taxonomy do not, however,\nconstitute the only personality traits. With respect to each of these\ntraits, researchers have identified various sub-traits or\n“facets” that are less broad and are said to have the\nadvantage of being more accurate. Unfortunately, when it comes to the\nfacet level of traits, there is a lot more controversy in the\nliterature, including how many facets there are for each of the Big\nFive traits as well as what to call them (Costa and McCrae 1995:\n24–27; McCrae and Costa 2003: 47; Ozer and Benet-Martínez\n2006: 403; Crowe et al. 2018). Here, though, is one widely used version from McCrae and\nCosta’s work, which appeals to 30 facets (Costa and McCrae 1995:\n28): \nRecall that McCrae and Costa were the ones who developed the NEO-PI-R\npersonality survey, which has 240 items. Not by accident, 8 items are\nspecifically tailored to measure each of these facets. As examples,\n“I keep my belongings neat and clean” and “I like to\nkeep everything in its place so I know just where it is” fall\nunder the heading of the consciousness facet of order (Costa and\nMcCrae 1992: 73). \nThere is much more to the Big Five approach than can be covered here,\nbut let’s move on to its relevance to philosophical issues about\ncharacter (for helpful reviews of the Big Five model, see McCrae and\nJohn 1992; Goldberg 1993; Piedmont 1998; McCrae and Costa 2003:\nchapters 2 and 3; John et al. 2008a). \nOn the surface, the Big Five taxonomy might seem to be a very\npromising resource for philosophers working on the virtues, whether\nfrom within a virtue ethical framework or not. However, there are at\nleast four reasons to be cautious about the relevance of this taxonomy\nto philosophical discussions of moral character. \nFirst, moral character traits are strikingly absent from the Big Five,\neven at the facet level. Modesty and altruism are there, to be sure,\nbut what about justice or honesty or courage? Any taxonomy which\nleaves them out will not be of much use to moral philosophers. \nTo be fair, the psychologists Ashton and Lee have long argued that the\nBig Five list of traits is incomplete. They have added a sixth\npersonality dimension called “honesty/humility”, which has\nfour facets for sincerity, fairness, greed-avoidance, and modesty\n(Ashton and Lee 2001, 2005, 2020; Lee and Ashton 2004). And their HEXACO\npersonality assessment instrument has become widely used among\npersonality psychologists. Relevant to the point at hand, this six\ntrait taxonomy does a much better job of capturing moral traits,\nalthough it too is incomplete (what about gratitude or courage?). \nSuppose further additions were made to get to a complete taxonomy. The\nsecond worry that arises is methodological. Measures of Big Five\ntraits are questionnaire measures. Unfortunately, the items used tend\nto have questionable relevance to the traditional moral virtues.\nConsider, for instance, the agreeableness facet of “altruism”,\nwhich researchers tend to characterize in a way that makes it sound\nquite close to the virtue of compassion (Costa and McCrae 1992: 18).\nHere are the questionnaire items for altruism from McCrae and\nCosta’s NEO-PI-R (where “R” is for a reversed item)\n(Costa and McCrae 1992: 72): \nFour of the items are concerned with the impressions we make on others\nand how they think of us, rather than how we ourselves are. Arguably\ntwo of them are better connected to manners and politeness, and one to\nsocial liking, with not one item assessing altruistic motivation.\nIndeed, only the final item asks directly about helping behavior at\nall. \nNot to mention that questionnaires, even with better items for\nassessing the virtues, are considered by many philosophers to have\nlimited value. Among several weaknesses, they omit the role of\nsubconscious processes in influencing behavior, and could instead\nreflect a person’s significantly misinformed understanding of\nher own character.  \nThe third reason for philosophers to be cautious about adapting work\non the Big Five to the study of moral character is also\nmethodological. On at least one way of understanding the Big Five taxonomy, it classifies people, not on the basis of whether they have traits like extraversion or not, but rather\non the basis of the degree to which they have these traits. In\nother words, it assumes that everyone has the trait of\nextraversion, and the main question is only to what extent a given\nindividual comes out on the extraversion scale. What goes for\nextraversion also applies to introversion. Everyone has that trait\ntoo. \nIn fact, it is going to follow, at least on this particular way of unpacking the Big Five approach, that everyone has all the traits there are, at least to some\ndegree or other. If we extend the Big Five taxonomy to include all the\nmoral character traits as well, then everyone will be virtuous to some\ndegree. But that is not all. Everyone will also be vicious to some\ndegree as well. This will be true, even with respect to opposing\nvirtues and vices such as courage and cowardice. \nMany moral philosophers are likely going to be concerned about how\nhelpful such an approach will be to their own work on character. For\nthey typically accept the following assumption: \nBut that assumption is rejected in this research. Furthermore, many\nphilosophers would also accept that: \nWhat this means is that not everyone’s character automatically\nqualifies as having a given virtue or vice. There are normative\nstandards that a character trait has to meet to be “good\nenough” to count as a virtue or “bad enough” to\ncount as a vice. But again this assumption is violated by the Big Five\ntaxonomy, at least as understood above. \nAmongst philosophers, Aristotle for instance clearly endorses both of\nthese assumptions. Virtue is rare on his view, and most people fail to\nmeet the relevant requirements. Plus vice is diametrically opposed to\nvirtue. Virtue ethicists in the Aristotelian tradition would follow\nhim in accepting\n (A1)\n and\n (A2)\n(for further discussion of these assumptions, see Miller 2019a). \nNow this is not at all to criticize this particular version of the Big Five approach. Given what it aims to do in personality psychology, it has clearly been a very\nrich and important approach. The only point here is that it may be\nill-suited for incorporation into philosophical discussions of\ncharacter. \nThere is a fourth and final reason why this might be true. Many\nphilosophers, especially those working in the Aristotelian tradition,\nunderstand character traits to be metaphysically real dispositions\nwith causal powers of their own that give rise to relevant thoughts\nand, in turn, to trait relevant actions. The trait of honesty, for example, is a real\nfeature of an honest person’s psychology which, when triggered,\ncan lead to the formation of honest occurrent thoughts and feelings.\nIt can figure into causal explanations for action, and can be a\nreliable basis for predicting future behavior. \nUp to this point, the metaphysical status of traits on the Big Five\napproach has not been specified. It turns out that there is some\ndisagreement about this amongst personality psychologists, but the\nclear majority position seems to be that they do not have any\nmetaphysical existence. The leading Big Five psychologists Oliver\nJohn, Richard Robins, Lewis Goldberg, Gerard Saucier, Robert Hogan,\nJerry Wiggins, Paul Trapnell, Laura Naumann, and Christopher Soto all\nseem to hold this view (John and Robins 1994: 138–139; Goldberg\nand Saucier 1995: 221; Saucier and Goldberg 1996b: 24–25, 34,\n43; Hogan 1991, 1996; Wiggins and Trapnell 1996; John et al. 2008:\n140). McCrae and Costa seems to be two of the rare exceptions in\nholding a causal view of Big Five traits (McCrae and Costa 2003, 2008). \nIf Big Five traits are not real entities with causal powers, then what\nare they? The standard view is that they are just descriptive labels\nfor how people tend to be. Put differently, they are useful\ndevices—terms of classification—which are far more\neconomical to use than is appealing to the thousands of trait terms in\nthe English language. Grouping people into only five categories is\nthus highly efficient (Hogan 1996: 170–173; McCrae and Costa\n2003: 36), but it is a further step to say that there actually\nis a trait of extraversion which causally explains individual\ndifferences between people. As Daniel Ozer and Steven Reise note, the\nBig Five taxonomy,  \nprovides a useful taxonomy, a hierarchical coordinate system, for\nmapping personality variables. The model is not a theory; it organizes\nphenomena to be explained by theory (1994: 360–361).  \nIn particular, it does not specify what the actual psychological\nprocesses are which lead people to act the way that they do. \nBut again, all of this is much less interesting to the moral\nphilosopher than it is to the personality psychologist. The moral\nphilosopher working on character typically wants to know about the\npsychological processes involved in virtue and vice, as well as\nwhether most people do or do not have such traits understood as causal\ndispositions. The Big Five approach won’t be of much help in\nfurthering that kind of work. \nOf the four approaches to the empirical study of character that we are\nexamining here, the one coming out of the positive psychology movement\nis the most recent. That movement itself only really got going at the\nturn of the century, and character traits were one part of a much\nlarger focus that will not concern us here (for overviews of positive\npsychology, see Snyder and Lopez 2009; Moneta 2014; Lopez et al.\n2015). As before, we need some background first before we get to the\nphilosophical implications. \nThe canonical approach to character traits in positive psychology is\nfound in Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and\nClassification, edited by Christopher Peterson and Martin\nSeligman and published in 2004. Peterson and Seligman, with the help\nof over 50 leading scholars working on character, put together a\nclassification of character traits which they saw as a “manual\nof the sanities” (2004: 4) by focusing on psychological health\nrather than illness, as so much of the field had done prior to the\npositive psychology movement. \nTo develop their classification, they scoured writings from traditions\nsuch as Confucianism, Buddhism, ancient Greek philosophy, and medieval\nIslam. They examined lists of traits from Charlemagne, Benjamin\nFranklin, the Boy and Girl Scouts, Hallmark greeting cards, and\nPokémon characters (2004: 15, 33–52). Naturally they came\nup with a huge list of traits, and needed some criteria to use to pare\nthem down. Here are the 10 criteria they came up with (2004:\n17–27): \nUsing these criteria, Peterson and Seligman arrived at a\nclassification with 6 “virtues” and 24 “character\nstrengths”, which today goes by the name of the Values in Action\nor VIA classification. Virtues are defined as “core\ncharacteristics valued by moral philosophers and religious\nthinkers” (2004: 13). Character strengths are:  \nthe psychological ingredients—processes or mechanisms—that\ndefine the virtues. Said another way, they are distinguishable routes\nto displaying one or another of the virtues (2004: 13).  \nTogether the virtues and character strengths make up the official VIA\nclassification (2004: 29–30): \nNaturally Peterson and Seligman have a great deal to say in clarifying\nwhat each of these means. But here it is important to keep a few more\ngeneral points in mind. \nFirst, Peterson and Seligman are explicit that they do not think this\nclassification is exhaustive, and are open to additions or deletions\n(2004: 13; see also Peterson and Park 2009: 27). Second, they\nacknowledge that “In some cases, the classification of a given\nstrength under a core virtue can be debated” (Peterson and\nSeligman 2004: 28, 31). And finally, they “regard these\nstrengths as ubiquitously recognized and valued, although a given\nindividual will rarely, if ever, display all of them” (2004:\n13). \nResearch making use of the VIA has been extensive, with many studies\nin particular looking at correlations between particular character\nstrengths and other variables like health and educational success (for\na review, see Niemiec 2013). Peterson and Seligman have also developed\nseveral assessment tools for character strengths, the main one of\nwhich is the VIA-IS. This 240 item measure uses a 5-point Likert scale\nanchored on “very much like me” and “very much\nunlike me” (2004: 629). Some example of its items include (2004:\n629): \nAnyone can take the survey for free at the VIA Institute for Character\nwebsite (see the Other Internet Resources) and learn what their\n“signature strengths” are. \nAs always, there is much more to be said, but let us turn to the\nphilosophical relevance. \nPhilosophers might initially have some questions about the VIA\nclassification. Where, for instance, is the virtue of patience? Or\nself-respect? Why does humor fall under the virtue of transcendence\n(for more questions like these, see Kristjánsson 2013:\n151–152)? \nThese are good questions, but not serious problems. For as we saw\nPeterson and Seligman were the first to admit that their\nclassification could need revision. If anything, these questions might\nhelp to make the VIA even better. \nA larger revision will be demanded by many Aristotelians, namely that\nthe list of virtues include practical wisdom (Kristjánsson\n2013: chapter 7). On traditional Aristotelian approaches, practical\nwisdom is necessary for the possession of any virtue. Leaving it off\nthe list would be a serious omission, but again there is nothing about\nPeterson and Seligman’s framework that would preclude it from\nbeing added (for more on practical wisdom, see Russell 2009; Miller forthcoming). \nIn fact, on the face of it philosophers should be quite amenable to\nthis framework, and be interested in incorporating it into their\nthinking about character. For unlike the Big Five, the VIA is focused\nspecifically on character traits, rather than personality traits in\ngeneral (Peterson and Park 2009: 26–27). And while there might\nbe a few omissions, it is remarkably comprehensive. Plus, unlike most\nadvocates of the Big Five, Peterson, Seligman, and their colleagues\nseem to be more comfortable describing character traits on\nmetaphysical grounds as dispositions with causal powers. \nBut caution is needed here (for a number of concerns, see Miller 2019b). For the VIA, unlike the other three approaches examined in this entry, was not arrived at\nempirically. As Peterson noted in a later article, “Our\nclassification of character strengths under core virtues is a\nconceptual scheme and not an empirical claim” (Peterson and Park\n2009: 31). We saw already that it is a theoretical classification\nderived from the writings of philosophers, religious thinkers, and\nfamous exemplars of good character, as well as more popular level\nexpressions of character in greeting cards and games (Peterson and\nSeligman 2004: 9–10). Furthermore, Peterson and Seligman are\nexplicit that they aligned their approach with virtue ethics (2004:\n10). \nUnfortunately, subsequent empirical tests of the VIA have raised\nproblems. MacDonald and colleagues (2008) found that four factors,\nrather than the six in the VIA, best fit the questionnaire data.\nMcGrath (2014) found support for five factors. Noftle and his\ncolleagues (2011) used confirmatory factor analysis to test existing\nsix factor, five factor, four factor, and one factor models, and could\nnot find support for any of them (2011: 212). They concluded that,\n \nAlthough it is possible that an alternative model that was not tested\ncould capture the structure of the VIA scales, it seems more likely\nthat the VIA simply does not have a clear hierarchical structure\n(2011: 212).  \nSee also the recent three virtue classification by McGrath 2015. \nSo it is not clear that the VIA is an empirically adequate framework\nfor thinking about character. It might have contributions to make in\nother ways, but if the goal is for philosophers to be able to draw on\npsychological research about character that is empirically informed,\nthen clearly more work is needed here. \nTwo other concerns arise as well. The first is methodological, in that\nlike the assessment measures for the Big Five, the VIA-IS is a\nquestionnaire measure which gathers self and other reports. When it\ncomes to character, philosophers are often worried about how much\nquestionnaires can tell us about what our characters are really\nlike. \nThe other concern is more conceptual. The VIA classification as\ndeveloped by Peterson and Seligman only appeals to positive character\ntraits. Strikingly absent are the vices (Kristjánsson 2013: 7,\n153). It may be an admirable goal to try to get psychologists to pay\nmore attention to psychological health rather than illness, but that\ncan be done without dropping the vices entirely from one’s\nclassification. Adding them, though, by canvasing once again all the\nsame philosophical, religious, and cultural resources, will require\nanother herculean undertaking on a par with what Peterson and Seligman\ndid in their 2004 handbook. \nThis entry has briefly reviewed and critically evaluated four\ndifferent approaches which draw on empirical psychology to aid us in\nthinking about issues of character. The amount of attention given here\nto each of them is in line with discussions in the philosophy\nliterature. Philosophers in their writings have paid by far the most\nattention to situationism followed by the CAPS model, with the Big\nFive and the VIA classifications hardly getting mentioned at all. This\nis in direct contrast to the current landscape in psychology,\nespecially personality psychology. Perhaps it is time for philosophers\nto shift their attention accordingly.","contact.mail":"millerc@wfu.edu","contact.domain":"wfu.edu"}]
