Several main issues about the\ncommensurability of philosophical traditions make up the subject\nmatter of comparative philosophy. One issue is methodological\ncommensurability – whether and how comparisons between different\nphilosophical traditions, in this case the Chinese and Western, are to\nbe conducted. Views run the gamut from those holding that meaningful\ncomparisons cannot be conducted at all to those holding that the\ncontent of traditions must largely be the same. Other issues\nconcerning commensurability concern specific subject matters of\ntraditions. The issue of metaphysical and epistemological\ncommensurability involves the comparison of traditions on their\nconceptions of the real and their modes of inquiry and justification.\nEthical commensurability involves the comparison of these traditions\non the matters of how people ought to live their lives, whether both\ntraditions have moralities and if so how similar and dissimilar they\nare. The separation between these main issues is somewhat artificial,\ngiven that a discussion of methodological commensurability will\ninevitably involve the comparison of traditions on metaphysical,\nepistemological, and ethical matters. There is some heuristic value,\nhowever, in beginning with a general discussion of views on\nmethodological commensurability with a brief illustration of how these\nviews might be applied to some Chinese/Western comparisons. Subsequent\nsections will address Chinese-Western comparisons in metaphysics,\nepistemology, and ethics that have assumed special prominence in the\nliterature. \n\n\nDoing comparative philosophy well can be very difficult because of the\nvast range of texts and their intellectual and historical contexts it\nrequires its practitioners to cover. Oversimplifications, excessively\nstark contrasts, and illicit assimilations count as the most frequent\nsins. One benefit of comparative philosophy lies in the way that it\nforces reflection on the most deeply entrenched and otherwise\nunquestioned agendas and assumptions of one’s own tradition.\nAnother benefit at which its practitioners often aim is that the\ntraditions actually interact and enrich one another. Demands for rigor\nand depth of scholarship obviously rank as some of the most important\nstandards applying to philosophy inquiry. The task of meeting these\nstandards becomes more manageable as the field of inquiry narrows.\nSuch a result can be legitimate but sometimes myopic and\nimpoverishing. To the extent that different traditions address common\nor overlapping problems, we might expect better philosophical work\nfrom those who can draw from a greater range of traditions. Drawing\nfrom studies in experimental psychology and the theory of culture as\nproviding individuals with toolkits for problem-solving, Bruya (2015)\nargues that a multicultural approach in philosophy and in education\ngenerally contributes more creativity and effectiveness in\nproblem-solving.\n\nThose arguing for radical incommensurability – the view that the\nquestions and answers in one tradition cannot sustain meaningful\nstatement in the other tradition – rely on the recognition of\nradical difference in basic concepts and modes of inquiry. Given such\nradical differences, they argue, there can be no cross-traditional\nreference to a common subject matter and to a truth about that subject\nmatter that is independent of the basic conceptual vocabulary and\ntheories and justificatory practices of a particular tradition (see\nRorty, 1989, and Shweder, 1989). Looking for a possible\nChinese-Western instance of radical incommensurability, one might go\nto Daoist texts such as the Daodejing and the\nZhuangzi. When it is said in chapter one (as traditionally\narranged and on one translation) of the Daodejing that\n“The Way that can be spoken of is not the constant Way,”\nor in chapter two that the “sages abide in nonaction and\npractice the teaching that is without words,” one is finding\nsomething different from the usual in Western texts infused with\nideals of discursive rationality and argumentation. Or consider the\nLunyu or Analects 1:2, where the importance of\nrightly ordered family relations is emphasized for right order in the\nstate (“He who has grown to be a filial son and respectful\nyounger brother will be unlikely to defy his superiors and there has\nnever been the case of someone inclined to defy his superiors and stir\nup a rebellion”). The prominent and enduring place of this theme\nof state as family writ large sets that tradition apart from Western\ncontractual traditions that have come to emphasize right order in the\nstate as that which can be ratified by an uncoerced agreement among\nequals concerned to protect their private interests. Opponents of\nradical incommensurability will level the charge that it presupposes a\nhyperdramatic contrast between traditions. For example, the Western\ntradition has not lacked for skeptics on the power of discursive\nrationality, and some of these skeptics have nevertheless believed in\na mode of veridical access to something of supreme significance\n– to a powerful experience within themselves or to something\nmuch larger outside themselves. At the same time, it must be noted\nthat the positive theme is more recessive in the Western tradition and\nappears mainly in theistic versions, as it does in Plotinus\n(Enneads), Meister Eckhart (Von unsagbaren Dingen)\nand Hildegaard of Bingen (Scivias). Similarly, the Western\ntradition has certainly housed strains of thought that do view the\nstate as more of a natural outgrowth of small human groups such as\nfamily and community. Even a major modern figure such as David Hume\n(Treatise of Human Nature, 3.2.2) explicitly rejects the idea\nof contract as central to understanding the origin or justification of\nsocial and political bonds. There might still be a difference between\nChinese and Western traditions with respect to which strains of\nthought become dominant or at least prevalent, but that difference\ndoes not appear to come under the heading of radical\nincommensurability. \nSamuel Fleischacker (1992) proposes a more moderate version of\nincommensurability – sometimes we can understand others just\nwell enough to know that we don’t understand them. His argument\nhas roots in Wittgenstein’s view that knowledge depends on a\nbackground of shared assumptions and standards of evidence.\n“World pictures” are embedded within cultures. Our world\npicture involves not only a distinctive set of beliefs about the world\nbut also an ordering of interests that determines how we go about\ntrying to have reliable beliefs. This ordering differs from those\ndominant in other cultures. We in the West have given precedence to\nour interests in “egalitarian knowledge”(wanting and\nbelieving that people have roughly equal access to the truth) and in\nprediction and control of this-worldly objects. The world pictures of\nother cultures embody other interests, and we may not be able to prove\nthat they are wrong, or indeed, we may be unable to fully understand\nwhy it is that they value the interests they value so highly.\nNevertheless, we understand that they do value these interests highly\nand think they are wrong to do so. We make such judgments despite our\nmerely partial understanding because we tend to see a certain set of\ninterests as the proper guide for a minimally decent or sensible human\nlife. \nThe idea that the distinctive character of a “world\npicture” lies partly in the interests they embody seems\nplausible. Daoism and Confucianism, at least after a certain stage in\nthe development of these schools, exemplify the way that a set of\ninterests intertwine with beliefs about the world. Both schools\nexemplify in different ways a conception of understanding the world\nthat is inseparable from the interest in coming into\n“attunement” with it, to use a felicitous word from\nCharles Taylor (1982). To become attuned to the world is to see its\ngoodness and to know one’s place in the order of the world. To\nsay that Daoists exemplify this theme about seeing the goodness of the\nworld is in a way misleading, since there is in the Daodejing\nand Zhuangzi a profound mistrust of our conceptual\nseparations between opposites such as good and bad. The notion of\n“nonaction” or wuwei, most prominently featured\nin the Daodejing, does not denote literal inaction but\npresupposes something like the possibility of an unforced acting\nwith the grain of things, and that presupposes that it is\npossible to become attuned to that grain while in a state of awareness\nthat is not cluttered by distorting conceptual oppositions. The\nDaodejing straightforwardly recommends wuwei and in\nthis sense seems to presuppose the goodness of the world and the way\nits “grain” goes. Confucian texts uphold the ideal of a\ndifferent kind of attunement, under which the world and its order can\nbe called good without the ambiguity that Daoist skepticism with\nconceptual opposition creates. For example, the Mencius (the\nname is actually a latinization given by Christian missionaries\nfor‘Mengzi’) presents a theory that human nature\ncontains the germs or sprouts of goodness, tendencies to certain\nfeelings and judgments such as manifested by the feeling of compassion\nfor a child about to fall into a well. These sprouts are in human\nnature because they were sent by tian (literally meaning\n‘sky’ but most often translated as ‘Heaven’\nand perhaps best conceived as an impersonal ordering force of the\nuniverse). Taylor thinks that modern science has severed the\nconnection between understanding and attunement. In\nFleischacker’s terms, modern science is predicated on different\ninterests, prediction and control foremost among these interests.\nTaylor believes that the severance of understanding and attunement\nresulted in superior understanding at least of physical nature. But as\nhe is careful to point out, no single argument can prove global\nsuperiority. If we can take attunement as an ideal, we have failed\nmiserably, even as our technological control of nature has increased\nimmeasurably. Perhaps, then, the contrast between a Chinese world\npicture in which attunement figures prominently and a modern\nscientific view predicated on the interests of prediction and control\nserves as an example of the sort of moderate incommensurability\nFleischacker has in mind. One question to be raised about this kind of\nincommensurability, however, is whether it truly involves lack of\nunderstanding between traditions. Taylor himself draws examples of the\ntheme of attunement from Plato and the European cultural tradition. Do\nwe really fail to understand the appeal behind world pictures of\nattunement? Taylor’s complex assessment suggests no inability on\nour part to understand the force behind both kinds of world pictures.\nEven to take the stance that attunement pictures are comforting\nillusions (an assessment less complex than the one Taylor adopts) is\nto suppose that one does understand the appeal behind them. \nSometimes the case for incommensurability is made by pointing to the\npervasive and central presence of a term in one tradition for which no\nequivalent term can be found in another tradition. Such a difference\nmay point to a degree of divergence of interests as suggested by\nFleischacker. However, it is better to explore the implications of\nthis kind of untranslatability case by case. Erin Cline (2013) has\nargued for the presence of a concept of justice in the\nAnalects despite the fact that it contains no word that is\nequivalent in meaning. Cline points to concerns expressed in the text\nthat relate to justice: about poverty and distribution of wealth;\nabout the need for trust in others in striving for a common good that\none shares with them; about how that sense of trust begins in the\nfamily; about the need for concern to expand to all people even if it\nstarts in the family; and about yi or rightness as a virtue\nas involving fair- mindedness. If there is a contrast between the\nancient Chinese tradition as represented by the Analects and\nmodern Western traditions, it may be more a matter of the latter being\nespecially focused on matters of distribution of goods by\ninstitutions, rather than that interest being entirely absent in the\nConfucian tradition. Often, the comparative situation is a complex one\nin which philosophers from different traditions diverge substantially\nin many ways, yet converge in interesting ways in some of their\ncentral concerns. Aaron Stalnaker (2006) proposes a comparative\nmethodology involving “bridge concepts” that facilitates\nexploration of such simultaneous divergence and convergence. Augustine\nand Xunzi, he suggests, are both centrally concerned with human nature\nand “spiritual exercises” intended to transform the self.\nBut such concepts as those of human nature and spiritual exercises are\nnot single concepts but a cluster of concepts, and in using them as\nfocal points of comparison, one should be aware of their complexity\nand the different as well as similar ways they might operate in the\nthought of Augustine and Xunzi. \nA different kind of incommensurability that may arise is not\nincomprehensibility between traditions but lack of common standards\nsufficient for settling significant conflicts between them. Alasdair\nMacIntyre (1988, 1989) has illustrated the difference between being\nable to understand a tradition and being able to translate all its\nclaims into the language of another tradition by pointing to the\npossibility of “bilinguals” – people who, for\nexample, might have been raised within one community and its\ntradition, and then through migration or conquest, become a member of\nanother community and its different tradition. Such bilinguals might\nvery well understand each tradition, and such understanding might\ninclude knowledge of those parts of each that cannot be translated\ninto the language of the other. Such bilinguals would not encounter\nthe sort of radical incommensurability constituted by\nincomprehensibility, but they may be unable to resolve conflicts\nof belief between the traditions, instead having to relativize\nthe claims of each in some such form as “seems true to this\nparticular community” or “seems justified to this\nparticular community.” This kind of “evaluational”\nincommensurability, rather than meaning incommensurability, might fit\nbetter the case of world pictures based on attunement versus world\npictures that sever the connection between understanding and\nattunement. MacIntyre himself presents a possibility for resolving\nsuch conflicts in case one tradition continually fails in its attempts\nto address certain key problems or issues. If another tradition has\nthe conceptual resources to explain why it is that the first tradition\ncontinues to fail, then advocates of that first tradition may have to\nacknowledge its limitations and even transfer their allegiances.\nWhether that is the case for conflicts over attunement is not obvious\n(See Wong, 1989). \nMoving to the end opposite from various forms of incommensurability,\nwe find views holding that there must be substantial agreement\nbetween traditions. The argument stems from a conception of the way\ninterpretation works. We proceed on the assumption that the others we\nare interpreting live in the same world as we do.We subvert this\nassumption, however, if we attribute to them beliefs that\nsubstantially differ from our own. As Donald Davidson (1980) has\nargued, a belief is identified by its location in a pattern of\nbeliefs, and it is this pattern that determines the subject matter of\nthe belief, what the belief is about. If we attribute to others a\npattern of beliefs that are different from our own, i.e., false\nbeliefs, this tends to undermine the identification of the subject\nmatter; to undermine, therefore, the validity of the belief as being\nabout that subject. David Cooper (1978) applies a Davidsonian\nprinciple of charity to the question of whether different cultures\nhave more or less the same morality. We can only identify\nothers’ beliefs as moral beliefs about a given subject matter if\nthere is a massive degree of agreement between their and our beliefs\nabout that subject matter. For Cooper this implies that the moral\nbeliefs we attribute to others must be about something connected with\nwelfare, happiness, suffering, security, and the good life. Michele\nMoody-Adams (1997) gives a more recent version of the same argument,\nstarting with the premise that understanding others requires that\nthere be quite substantial agreement about many of the basic concepts\nthat are relevant to moral reflection. She concludes that\n“ultimate” or “fundamental” moral disagreement\nis not possible. \nThe way that an earlier example of putative radical difference can be\nquestioned serves as some confirmation of this argument from charity\nfor strong agreement between traditions. Confucian conceptions of the\nstate as family writ large are not especially puzzling even when we do\nnot subscribe to them. We find similar themes that have arisen within\nthe Western tradition, and again, it is possible to conceive what the\nappeal would be. However, these points also raise certain doubts about\nthe use of charity to argue for strong agreement. The fact that we can\npoint to similar beliefs within our own tradition and that we can\nimagine what the appeal would lie behind such beliefs does not mean\nthat we share those beliefs with others even as we attribute to them.\nEven if we were to share with them a belief in certain values, that\nwould not necessarily mean that we place the same importance on those\nvalues relative to other values we (and perhaps they also) hold. It is\noften observed that a distinctive feature of the Chinese Confucian\ntradition is the very high value placed on filial piety. It is a\ncommon feature of many cultures that one should honor thy father and\nmother, of course, and it is not difficult to find analogies within\nAmerican society to Confucian filial piety. At the same time, the\nConfucian tradition is unusual in the stringency of its duties to\nparents. The scope of filial duties includes taking care of what\nparents alone could have given one – one’s body. Cengzi, one\nof Confucius’ students, is portrayed in 8.3 of the\nAnalects as gravely ill and near death. He bids his students\nto look at his hands and feet, and quotes lines from the Book of\nPoetry to convey the idea that all his life he has been keeping\nhis body intact as part of his duty to his parents. It is only now\nnear death, he says, that he can be sure of having been spared and\nthus fulfilling this duty to parents. This very idea, that one must\nkeep one’s body intact as a duty of gratitude to one’s\nparents, has remained a central idea in Chinese culture. While\nAmerican culture certainly contains similar themes of gratitude toward\nthose from whom one has received great benefits, such themes do not\nnecessitate agreement on the centrality and stringency of filial duties\nin the Confucian tradition. Important kinds of moral difference, then,\nmay consist in the differing emphases given to values that are shared\nacross cultural traditions (Wong, 1996b). Thomas Kasulis (2002) puts a\nsimilar point in a visual metaphor: what is foreground in one culture\nmay be background in another culture. \nTo accommodate this more subtle kind of difference, proponents of the\nprinciple of charity might point out that charity does not require\ncomplete agreement, but only “substantial” agreement or\nagreement on “ultimate” or “fundamental”\ndisagreement. A further question that will pressed against this\nposition is how much agreement is sufficient for identification of\nothers’ beliefs as being about the same subject matter as ours.\nWe do attribute to others error and simple difference (without judging\nthat someone is in error) of belief about the same subject matter. We\ncan attribute error to others if we believe them to be in\ncircumstances that encourage error, and we identify such types of\ncircumstance from past experience of discovering ourselves to be in\nerror. Furthermore, we attribute simple difference of belief when we\nrecognize that there is a range of reasonable interpretations or\nweightings to be given to evidence. \nIn his later writings on charity (2001, p. 196), Davidson recognized\nits ambiguities, noting that he previously tended to construe it in\nterms of “maximizing” agreement in belief and that a more\nperspicuous statement of what he had in mind all along is that\nagreement in beliefs should be “optimized.” Rather than\nthe “most” agreement, we need the “right sort”\nof agreement that enables understanding of others. We should try to\nreach agreement “as far as possible, subject to considerations\nof simplicity, hunches about the effects of social conditioning, and\nof course our common-sense, or scientific, knowledge of explicable\nerror.” This very qualified formulation of charity amounts to\nthe admission that the principle of charity itself needs\ninterpretation and hence cannot be the ultimate standard for\ninterpretation. Henry Richardson (1997) points out that interpreting a\nphilosophical text requires taking account of the cognitive aims the\nauthors had in writing what they did. Is it more charitable,\nRichardson asks, for a translator of Machiavelli’s The\nPrince to resolve ambiguities and seek to maximize agreement\nbetween Machiavelli and ourselves? Or is it more charitable to set him\nout as intentionally provocative and deliberately cryptic? It should\nbe unsurprising that charity cannot fulfill its promise as a firm and\nclear guide to interpretation. Charity bids us to render others like\n“us,” but “we” are already a diverse group who\nbelieve and want and value somewhat different things. That is, the\nrange of the intelligibly human already embraces diversity (think of\nhow impoverished our models of understanding would be if we could only\nrely on our individual selves). See Mou (2006) for a range of articles\non the way that Davidson’s interpretive principle and other\naspects of his philosophy relate to Chinese philosophy. \nAn alternative to both the radical incommensurability and strong\nagreement positions is that there is no general answer on how much\nagreement or disagreement is to be found between complex and\nheterogeneous traditions such as the Chinese and Western. As emerged\nabove, one must distinguish between meaning and evaluational\nincommensurabilities. Furthermore, how much disagreement we will find\nnot only depends on the particular subject matter but also on the\nanswers we find most plausible within a larger context of inquiry: the\nattempt to explain others, their actions, practices, institutions,\nand history. In such a larger context, attribution to others of\nbeliefs different from ours may be more or less reasonable depending\non how it fits into a reasonable explanation of them. And what counts\nas a reasonable explanation in particular cases will be set within the\ncontext of one’s larger theories about persons and societies,\namong other things. One’s explanation of people can reasonably\nattribute error or simple difference of belief on an indefinite number\nof important matters that might even deserve to be called\n‘fundamental’ as long as it seems plausible to attribute\nerror or simple difference of belief to them in their epistemic\nsituation as we construe it (see also Grandy, 1973). Or one’s\nexplanation can reasonably imply convergence or similarity of belief.\nAn intermediate possibility is that the difference or similarity\nbecomes more prominent as one defines the subject matter in a\n‘thicker’ or ‘thinner’ way (Shun, 2004). Does\nthe Chinese tradition recognize individual rights? The answer, as\nshall emerge below, may depend on how specifically one defines the\nnotion of a right. If one defines a right rather thinly as what one\nhas whenever one has justifiable claims on others to assure\none’s possession of things or one’s exercise of certain\ncapacities, then one can plausibly argue that there is a common notion\nof rights between the Chinese and Western traditions (Wong, 2004a).\nIf, on the other hand, one ‘thickens’ one’s\ndefinition of rights with the idea that they are justifiable\nindependently of what is a good and worthwhile life for human beings,\nthen one plausibly argue against a common notion of rights. \nOne common portrait of the difference between the Chinese and Western\ntraditions posits a radical incommensurability on the very nature of\nphilosophical inquiry. Chinese philosophy is “wisdom”\nliterature, composed primarily of stories and sayings designed to move\nthe audience to adopt a way of life or to confirm its adoption of that\nway of life. Western philosophy is systematic argumentation and\ntheory. Those who identify philosophy with the latter will commonly\nassert that Chinese thought has no philosophy (see DeFoort, 2001; and\nVan Norden, 2017 for discussion of this aspect of the controversy). Is\nthere such a difference? One reason to think so is the fairly\nwidespread wariness in Chinese philosophy of a discursive rationality\nthat operates by deduction of conclusions about the particular from\nhigh-level generalizations. The seventeenth chapter of the\nZhuangzi notes that the sage-king Yao looked for a suitable\nsuccessor, found the perfect candidate in Shun, and then abdicated so\nthat Shun could take over the throne. The result was glorious.\nHowever, when Kuai imitated Yao the result was disastrous. Tang and Wu\nwere kings who fought and conquered. But Duke Bo also acted on that\nrule, fought, and lost. That is why it is impossible to establish\n“any constant rule.” Inspired by the achievement of\ninsight or wisdom in some particular cases, we create general rules\nthat we believe will work for many other cases in the future. The\nunfortunate result is that our original insights and wisdom are\nmagnified beyond the scope of their applicability. Confucians are more\nwilling to articulate their teachings in the form of principles, but\nsuch principles seem to function as designators of values or general\nconsiderations that ought to be given weight in judgments about what\nto do. Never lost is recognition of the necessity for the exercise of\ndiscretion in judgment according to the particular circumstances at\nhand. The best rules lose applicability in unusual circumstances.\nRules and values conflict in many circumstances, and there are no\n“super-principles” to supply ready answers. The\nappropriate resolution to each conflict depends very much on the\nsituation. In Mencius 7A35, Mencius is asked what the\nlegendary sage-king Shun would have done if his father had killed a\nman. Mencius replies that the only thing to do would be to apprehend\nhim. Shun could not interfere with the judge, who was acting on the\nlaw. However, Mencius continues, Shun would then have abdicated and\nfled with his father to the seacoast. As Mencius portrays it, then,\nShun’s actions strike a balance between the different values in\ntension with one another. The refusal to interfere with the judge is a\nway of acknowledging the necessity of impartially administering a\nsocial order. At the same time, fleeing with one’s father is\nhonoring the value of greater loyalty to family. Shun manages to honor\nboth values at different moments in his dealing with the situation.\nDeduction from a principle could not yield such a balance. We are\nexpected, however, to learn from stories such as Shun’s,\nprecisely because they function as concrete paradigms for\njudgment-making in the future. When we encounter situations that pose\nsimilar-looking conflicts between impartial concern and familial\nloyalties, we have Shun’s judgment as a resource and a model.\nThat model is not the same as a general principle that would\ndeductively yield a judgment about what to do in the present\nsituation. We must exercise judgment in determining whether new\nsituations are similar enough to the case of Shun, and we must\nexercise judgment as to what actions would be parallel to Shun’s\nactions. \nNaes and Hanay (1972) have characterized Chinese philosophy as\n“invitational” in its method of persuasion, meaning that\nit portrays a way of life in a vivid fashion so as to invite the\naudience to consider its adoption. The Analects, for example,\nportrays the ideal of the junzi (often translated as\n“gentleman” but perhaps more accurately glossed as the\nnoble person) as realized by persons of genuine substance who are\nundisturbed by the failure of others to recognize their merits (1.1:\n“To be undisturbed by others yet not complain, is this not the\nmark of the junzi?”). In the Mencius\n(2A2), such a person possesses a kind of equanimity or heart\nthat is unperturbed by the prospects of fame and success. This\nunperturbed heart corresponds to the cultivation of one’s\nqi (vital energies) by uprightness. One might be able to see\nsuch passages as appealing to experiences the audience might have in\nits encounters with persons who do seem to possess special strength,\nsubstance, and tranquility through identification with and commitment\nto a cause they perceive to be far greater than themselves. One need\nnot interpret such sayings as attempting to persuade by the pure\nemotive effect of certain words, as in propaganda. Rather, they may\ncorrespond to a way of doing philosophy that attempts to say something\nabout values in life that can be supported by experience, even if not\nall testimony will agree (Kupperman, 1999). The Daoists recommend a\nway of life that they explicitly characterize as one that cannot be\nargued for, but their recommendation receives some support through\ncommonly shared experience. Consider again the notion of\nwuwei and its illustrations in the Zhuangzi through\nstories of exemplary craft. Most famously, Zhuangzi’s Cook Ding\ncuts up an oxen so smoothly and effortlessly that his knife never\ndulls, and it is if he is doing a dance with his knife as it zips\nthrough the spaces between the joints. He does this not through\n“perception and understanding” but through the\nqi, the vital energies of the body. His marvelous skill is\nknowledge of how to adjust his own movements to the spaces within oxen\nso that he and the oxen form seamless wholes. Similarly, Woodcarver\nQing has learned to prepare for carving his marvelous bellstands in\nsuch a way that he clears his mind of all distraction and sees the\nstand within the timber he has selected. Suggested here is a portrait\nof acting in the world that consists of complete and full attention to\npresent circumstances so that the agent can act with the grain of\nthings (the Cook Ding passage refers to tianli or heavenly\npatterns). Such a portrait does resonate with the actual experience of\ncraftspeople, artists, athletes, musicians and dancers who have\nadvanced beyond self-conscious technique and rule-following, who\nbecome fully absorbed in the experience of working with the material,\nthe instruments or in the movement of their bodies, and who experience\ntheir actions as an effortless flow and in fact perform at very high\nlevels. In such ways, Chinese thinkers draw a picture of the world\nthat must in the end be evaluated by explanatory power in some very\nbroad sense. We must ask whether the picture helps make sense of our\nexperience of the world (again in a broad sense of\n‘experience’ not limited to quantifiable observations in\nreplicable experiments) and whether it preserves features of that\nexperience that we think are prima facie genuine. Much of\nWestern philosophy must be judged according to the same standard.  \nSo then, is it right to say that Chinese philosophy is invitational\nwhile Western philosophy is argumentative? One answer is that there is\na difference but that it is more a matter of degree than an absolute\ncontrast. It was Aristotle, after all, who said that discussions about\nthe good in human life cannot be properly assimilated by the young\nbecause they do not have enough experience of life (Nichomachean\nEthics I.3). And Plato despite his insistence on the centrality\nof argumentation to philosophy, dispatches the short analytical\narguments presented in Book I of the Republic in favor of\nlengthy expository portraits of the ideal city-state and the\nharmonious soul for the rest of that work. Those portraits sometimes\npresent only the thinnest of arguments for crucial premises, and at\nother times no argument at all. Some of his claims, about the divisive\neffects of family loyalties and the ill-effects of democracy,\nobviously appeal to experience, even if not all testimony will agree.\nIn fact, it is hard work to find an acknowledged great in the Western\ntradition to whom such characterizations do not apply, at\nleast to some degree. Sometimes, as in Spinoza (The Ethics),\nthe contrast is glaring between the aspiration to prove points by way\nof deductive argument from self-evident axioms and the obvious source\nof those points from experience of life and at best some mix of theory\nand intuition. It is true that much Western philosophy, especially of\nthe late modern variety, and most especially emanating from the United\nKingdom and North America, attempts to establish its claims through\nargumentation that is more rigorous than appeals to experience and\nexplanatory power in the broad sense. But it must also be noted that\nthere is argument in Chinese philosophy. Chad Hansen (1992) has\npointed out the pivotal role of the philosopher Mozi, who criticized\nthe Confucians for an uncritical acceptance of tradition and who\nexplicitly introduced standards for the evaluations of belief. This\nintroduction of argumentation required response in kind. Mencius gives\na Confucian response to to the Mohists and argues on behalf of his\ntheory of human nature as containing the germs or sprouts of the\nethical virtues, in the form of natural dispositions to have certain\nkinds of feeling and judging reactions to situations, such as\ncompassion for a child about to fall into a well (2A6, and see Shun,\n1997 for an extensive analysis of argumentation in the\nMencius text). He defends himself against the arguments of\nrival theorists who hold that human nature has no innate ethical\npredispositions but is neutral (6A). Xunzi, a later Confucian thinker,\nattempts to give a refutation of Mencius’s theory in favor of\nhis own theory that human nature has dispositions that get us into\ntrouble and that ethical norms are an invention designed to avoid that\ntrouble (Xunzi, chapter 23). Methods of argumentation reach\ntheir most sophisticated state of development in Xunzi (See Cua,\n1985). \nDifferences in the way philosophy is conceived may reflect differences\nin the interests philosophy is meant to satisfy. Chad Hansen (1992)\npoints to another possible difference in interests – this time\nin interests that language is meant to satisfy, arguing that the\nclassical Chinese thinkers did not conceive of the primary function of\nlanguage to be descriptive and as attempting to match propositions\nwith states of affairs, but rather as a pragmatic instrument for\nguiding behavior. In fact, Hansen sees the Chinese tradition as\ncentrally concerned with the conflict of daos, which he\ndefines as sets of behavior-guiding practices, including discourses.\nWestern interpreters have been unable to see this, argues Hansen,\nbecause they have imposed their own concerns with correspondence truth\nand metaphysics on the Chinese tradition. They have as a result\nimposed upon Daoism an irrational mysticism focused on a\nmetaphysically absolute Dao. Michael LaFargue (1992) also\nargues that the Daodejing is not to be interpreted as as\nconcerning some metaphysical entity called the Dao, but is\nrather concerned with self cultivation that allows one to have a\ntransforming experience of deep and peaceful stillness within\none’s personal center. Wuwei is the style of action\nthat is rooted in such an experience. David Hall and Roger Ames (1987)\ngive a related interpretation of Confucius, in part reacting against\nHerbert Fingarette’s (1972) influential interpretation of\nConfucius’ Dao as an ideal normative order transcending\nthe contingencies of time, place, history, and culture. Hall and Ames\nargue Confucius’s Dao was not conceived as a tradition\nand language-independent reality against which linguistically\nformulated beliefs were to be measured as reliable or unreliable, but\nin fact a cumulative creation of individuals working from within a\ncontext provided by a society’s tradition, consisting of\ncustoms, conventions, conceptions of proper behavior and good manners,\nconceptions of right conduct and of what is of ultimate value and of\nwhat lives are worth living. \nThese interpretations perform valuable functions in questioning what\nis sometimes an unreflective imposition of Western philosophical\nagendas on Chinese thinkers. The debate will go on, however.\nConcerning Confucius, it is true that the Analects often\ndisplays an attitude of tolerance and flexibility in judging where the\nDao lies. On the other side, it can be pointed out that in\nsayings such as 1.2 (filial piety and brotherly love are at the root\nof the virtue of ren or humanity), there is no indication\nthat the claim is limited to Chinese culture but extended to human\nbeings generally. One way to understand it is to take it as saying\nthat human beings have to learn to respond to a kind of authority that\nis not based on force and coercion, but respect and care. Or consider\nthe consistent Confucian theme that rulers cannot hold power simply on\nthe basis of law and punishment. There is no sign such judgments are\nmeant to be limited in scope to one’s own time and place.\nConcerning the Daodejing, it is clear that there are very\nstrong practical concerns underlying the text. A way of life is being\nrecommended (as in Hansen), and perhaps that way of life is rooted in\na certain kind of transforming experience (as in LaFargue). On the\nother side, it could be argued that such practical and experiential\nconcerns do not exclude metaphysical concerns. Consider chapter four\nof that text where Dao is described as being empty, as\nseeming something like the ancestor of the myriad of things, as\nappearing to precede the Lord (di). For something that at\nleast looks metaphysical in the Mencius, consider\naforementioned 2A2, concerning the unperturbed heart that can be\nachieved by cultivating one’s floodlike qi. Such\nqi is vast and unyielding, and if cultivated with uprightness\nwill fill up the space between tian (Heaven) and earth.\nPerhaps the lesson to draw is not that Chinese thinkers lacked\nmetaphysical concerns but that they did not separate practical from\nmetaphysical concerns in the way that contemporary Western thinkers\nmight. \nHowever this issue is resolved with respect to the classical Chinese\nthinkers, few have disputed that classical concepts such as that of\nnonbeing eventually acquired frankly metaphysical meanings in\nthe Chinese tradition, where it refers at the least to an\nindeterminate ground in which the determinate “ten thousand\nthings” are incipient (Neville, 1989). This embrace of an\nindeterminate ground of the determinate may reflect the decision to\ngive the phenomenon of change a fundamental place in ontology, rather\nthan an absolutely stable being as in Parmenidean ontology and as\nlater reflected in Aristotelian and Cartesian notions of substance\n(Cheng, 1989, 1991). The revival of interest in Chinese metaphysics\nhas partly been fueled by the perception that twentieth century\nphysics has in fact undermined the strategy of giving determinate\nbeing ontological primacy (Zukov, 1979).  \nThe Neo-Confucian Zhu Xi (Zhuzi yulei) reinterpreted ethical\nthemes inherited from the classical thinkers and reframed them within\na cosmology and metaphysics that was deeply influenced by Daoism and\nBuddhism, even as he asserted the ethical superiority of Confucianism\nover these other philosophies. On his conception of ren as an\nall inclusive virtue, it constitutes the Dao and consists of\nthe fact that the mind of Heaven and Earth to produce things is\npresent in everything, including the mind of human beings. Li\n(not the word for ritual or ritual propriety),the principles or\npatterns of the universe, runs through all things. It runs through the\nmind of human beings and enables them to form “one body”\nwith all things, including a sensitivity to harm that comes to them\nthat is like the response we have to harm to comes to ourselves (see\nShun, 2020). Another great Neo-Confucian, Wang Yang-Ming (Quan\nxilu) is known for his view that genuinely moral knowledge is\ninherently practical and motivated. Knowing goodness is to know to\nlove it (see Huang, 2017). In comparison to Zhu, Wang showed little\ninterest in the sort of empirical investigation of things prescribed\nin the Great Learning but rather a rectification of the mind\nwith evil thoughts. Nevertheless, there are metaphysical commitments\nin Wang that are intimately related to his ethical commitments (see\nIvanhoe, 2017). \nWithin the Chinese tradition, Confucian, Daoist and Buddhist\napproaches to understanding the world are broadly similar in their\ntendencies to understand things in terms of their relationships to\nother things and ultimately to the wholes that contain them. Rather\nthan seeing the world as composed of plural substances causally\ninteracting in a linear fashion on the model of a billiard ball\nhitting another billiard ball and setting it into motion, there is a\ntendency to think of systems or wholes, the structures of which are\nconstituted by the relationships between their parts. The paradigms\nhere are biological or organic systems (Wang, 2013). The mode of\nthinking about these relationships in Confucianism and Daoism, has\nbeen termed “correlative.” Eminent sinologists have meant\nsignificantly different things by these terms (see Granet, 1934;\nNeedham, 1954; Graham, 1989; Hall and Ames, 1998), but they all seem\nto be pointing to a species of analogical thought identifying\ncorrespondences between kinds (lei). These kinds might be\ndifferentiated according to functions within a structure of\nrelationships, such that those having similar functions in similar\nstructures would be of the same kind. The most general of kinds came\nto be identified as yin and yang, where yin\nis the tendency to contract and yield (associated with darkness and\nthe feminine), and yang is the tendency to expand and\ndominate associated with light and the masculine). A thing that is\nyin has a relationship with something that is yang.\nNatural patterns displayed by interactions within wholes, whether they\nbe the universe or the human body, involve the interaction of things\nthat are yin and yang, and this interaction can\ninvolve opposition, complementarity, and cyclical alternation (Wang,\n2013).  \nThough the nature of the interactions is sometimes described as\nnon-causal, the contrast is most plausibly made with reference to\nmechanical and linear notions of causation in which the effect (like\nthe second billiard ball hit by the first) is purely passive and\ninert. The interactions envisioned in Chinese thought are not\nnecessarily incompatible with notions of causation in which the cause\n“works with the tendencies of the thing affected”\n(Perkins, 2019). This is in keeping with the paradigm of wholes being\nthe biological and the organic. A significant example of the more\ndynamic and complex notion of causation is Mencius’ conception\nof the development of moral sprouts in human nature (mentioned in\nsection 1 above and further discussed in section 3 below). To become\nvirtuous is to grow one’s moral sprouts (such as a natural\ncompassion for others’ suffering) into a mature and vigorous\nplant (such as the full virtue of ren or humanity) through\nreflecting on their importance to one’s flourishing as a person\nunder the environmental conditions of secure material livelihood and\nethical education (Mencius 1A7, 6A7, 6A14–15). Cultivation of\na person’s virtue, then, is an instance of factors (in this case\nsome external and some internal to the person) interacting with the\ntendencies affected. It is not writing on a blank slate nor is it\ndiscovering something that is already fully there. \nTrying to understand something in terms of its relationships to a\nlarger whole has been said to be a characteristic of Chinese (and more\ngenerally East Asian) thought (Nisbett, 2004) and this more holistic\napproach may be contrasted with an analytic approach that begins with\nthe parts and tries to understand the whole in terms of their\nrelationships. These two approaches are not necessarily mutually\nexclusive, and both approaches may be employed at different stages of\ninquiry or to different aspects of the subject matter. If there is a\ndifference between the very broad and internally diverse traditions of\nEast Asia and the West, it is one of the degree and frequency of\ndominance of one approach versus the other.  \nThe relational approach in Confucian and Daoist philosophies is\napparent in their conceptions of what it is to be a person. The\nConfucian conception of the person is that of a profoundly social\nbeing. Hall and Ames (1998) use the language of the individual’s\nbeing the focal point of an interlocking “field” of\nrelationships. Henry Rosemont, Jr. (1991b) identifies the individual\nwith the sum total of their social roles. One issue here is whether a\nperson’s identity is wholly constituted by their\nrelationships and how this can be compatible with what Shun (2004) has\nidentified in Confucianism as the capacity to step back from an\nestablished social setup, to criticize it and possibly to reject and\nseparate oneself from it. Hall and Ames, furthermore, want to affirm\nas part of Confucianism the belief in the individual’s power to\ncontribute creatively to the constitution of social roles in the\n“field,” and the question is how such a power co-exists\nwith being wholly constituted by the field (Wong 2004b). However one\nends up resolving that question, it seems clear that a good part of a\nperson’s identity on the Confucian view must lie in their\nrelationships to other persons, and even the reasons for distancing\nthe self from the established social setup would involve a critical\nethical stance toward that setup based on rightness and humanity\ntogether with realization that these values could not be fully\nrealized in one’s lifetime. \nWhereas early Confucianism tends to find the relational elements of\npersonhood in the human social world, early Daoism tends to find them\nin the world at large, especially beyond the human social world.\nReturning to the theme of correlative thinking, Daoism invites human\nbeings to find their most fundamental being in the natural patterns\nthat are more clearly evidenced in the nonhuman natural world and that\ntend to be obscured by developed human social orders and the\nconceptual oppositions embedded in them. People are invited to find\ntheir identities in harmonizing with natural forces. The\nneo-Confucians, in trying to establish the primacy of Confucianism\nover Daoism and Buddhism, incorporated some of the most powerful\nthemes from these rival philosophies, as illustrated by Wang\nYang-Ming’s declaration that human beings form one body with\nHeaven and Earth and the myriad things. \nIn Chinese Buddhism, we get an explicit, metaphysical deconstruction\nof the human self in the Buddha’s view of it as a floating\ncollection of various psychophysical reactions and responses with no\nfixed center or unchanging ego entity. He did not deny that we think\nof the self as a fixed and unchanging center, but considered such a\nself a delusion. Our bodily attributes, various feelings, perceptions,\nideas, wishes, dreams, and in general a consciousness of the world\ndisplay a constant interplay and interconnection that leads us to the\nbelief that there is some definite ‘I’ that underlies and\nis independent of the ever-shifting series. But there is only the\ninteracting and interconnected series. This metaphysical concern, of\ncourse, had deep practical implications for the Buddha. It points\ntoward the answer to human suffering, which ultimately stems from a\nconcern for the existence and pleasures and pains of the kind of self\nthat never existed in the first place. The recognition that none of\nthe “things” of ordinary life are fixed and separate\nentities, anymore than the self is, leads to a recognition of all of\nlife as an interdependent whole and to the practical attitude of\ncompassion for all of life. In a comparative perspective, one cannot\nhelp but be struck by the similarity between the Buddhist view of the\nself and David Hume’s doubts about the existence of a unitary\nand stable self (Treatise of Human Nature, 1.4.6). Consider\nalso Derek Parfit’s (1984) point that acceptance of a Humean or\na Buddhist view of the self can lead to sense that one is less\nseparate from other selves and to a wider concern when\n“my” projects seem not so absolutely different from\n“your” projects. However one might regard the argument for\nimpersonal concern from such a view of the self, the view itself may\nseem to have a claim to our renewed attention. It certainly fits\nbetter with a naturalized conception of human beings as part of this\nworld and not as Cartesian thinking substances that somehow operate\napart from the rest of nature. Siderits (2003) Flanagan (2013) have\nbrought Buddhism into dialogue with naturalistic analytic philosophy\nin sophisticated and productive ways that benefit both sides. \nGoing back to the issue of the relative differences between Chinese\nand Western philosophy, it would be fair to say that the former is\nmore consistently focused on the question of how to live one’s\nlife, even when the topic is the metaphysics of the world or of the\nself. This makes a difference to the way philosophy is done. As argued\nabove, Chinese philosophy has argumentation and the ambition to\nexplain through theory, but its commitment to the ethical and the\npractical in general has led to a tighter connection between\napproaches to how to live one’s life and what it is to do\nphilosophy. Chinese philosophy is done in ways that have significantly\nnon- or extra-discursive dimensions. Jenco (2007) has pointed out that\neven when Western philosophers have discussed the ills of\nethnocentrism, they have typically framed their critiques in concepts\nand language from Western discourses, such as Marxism and\npoststructuralism. They have called for cross-cultural dialogue as a\nway of countering ethnocentrism without raising the question of\nwhether the exclusive use of dialogue itself might be a form of\nethnocentrism. Dialogue tends to focus our attention on texts and\nleaves out of focus practices such as memorization, recitation,\nmeditation, imitation, ritual, and dance (Jenco, 2007; Kalmonson,\n2017). It is not as if the texts are left out of one’s\nattention. It is rather that these non-discursive practices become\npart of one’s attempt to interpret and live the meaning of the\ntexts in one’s personal experience. To fully engage in\ncross-cultural philosophy may require an openness to and\nexperimentation in these non-discursive practices. At a time when the\nboundaries between reason and emotion and body and mind are being\ncalled into question, and when the operations of reason and\ndecision-making have increasingly been found by cognitive psychology\nand science to depend on the state of the emotions and the body, it\nseems appropriate to consider that meditation and ritual practices may\nalter for the better the emotional and somatic basis of effective\nthinking and acting. \nConfucianism is a perfectionist virtue ethic if such an ethic is\ndistinguished by its central focus on three subjects: character traits\nidentified as the virtues; the good and worthwhile life; and\nparticularist modes of ethical reasoning. These three subjects are\ninterrelated. The virtues are traits of character necessary for living\na good life. The virtues typically involve acting on particularist\nmodes of ethical reasoning that do not rely on deducing specific\naction-guiding conclusions about how to act from general principles\nbut rather on judging in the context at hand what needs to be done\n(see Van Norden, 2004, 2007, Hutton, 2003, Wong, 2002, and Ivanhoe,\n2002 for discussions of judgment and its relation to reasoning and\nemotion in Mencius). Consider some of the virtues that belong to the\njunzi (the noble person): ren (humanity,\nbenevolence), xiao (filial piety), yi\n(righteousness), and li (acting according to ceremonial\nritual or more generally propriety). The very concept of yi\nconnotes the ability to identify and perform the action that is\nappropriate to the particular context (Analects 4:10 says\nthat the junzi is not predisposed to be for or against\nanything, but rather goes with what is yi). While traditional\nrules of ritual provide one with a sense of what is courteous and\nrespectful action given standard contexts, the virtue of\nyi allows one to identify when those rules need to\nbe set aside in exigent circumstances (see Cua, 1997). The previously\ndiscussed example in the Mencius of Shun and his father shows\nhow a ruler’s more general concern for his subjects and his\nfilial duties to his fathers must be balanced in ways that cannot be\ngiven by principle but only by reflection on what the particular\ncircumstances suggest and allow. Finally, consider that another\nexample from the Mencius about the time when Shun wanted to marry. He\nknew that his parents, not the wisest nor the best of parents, would\nnot permit him to marry if told of Shun’s intention. Shun went\nahead and got married without telling his parents, an act that\nnormally would be a grave offense against filial piety. Two reasons\nare given for the justifiability of this act. One is that the worst\nway of being a bad son is to provide no heir (4A26); the other is that\nletting his parents thwart his desire to realize the greatest of human\nrelationships which in turn would cause bitterness toward his parents\n(5A2). Hence an act that normally would be a grave offense against\nfilial piety constitutes filial piety in the particular circumstances.\nParticularist modes of reasoning are needed, then, to judge when the\nusual rules apply, to balance conflicting values, and to specify the\nconcrete meaning of single values in application to context. \nThe parallels to ancient Greek virtue ethics, medieval virtue ethics,\nand also to contemporary virtue ethics in the West are striking, and\nhelp to account for the renewal of Western interest in Confucianism.\nFor example, Jiyuan Yu (2007) argues that the concept of\neudaimonia (happiness, living well, flourishing) in Aristotle\nand the concept of dao (the way for human beings to live) in\nConfucius are parallel starting points in their ethics, and that the\nnext step in both their ethics is to discuss virtue (arete\nfor Aristotle and de for Confucius). In general, Chinese and\nWestern virtue ethics converge in focusing on certain virtues as\ncrucial for ethical development of the person. There are particularly\ninteresting discussions of courage and the possible role of fear in\nMencius and Aristotle (see Van Norden, 1997, 2007; Jiang, 2008).\nParticularist modes of reasoning in Confucianism parallel the\nAristotelian notion of a phronesis or practical wisdom that\ndepends significantly on knowledge of particulars acquired through\nexperience. A good example is his doctrine of the mean, which holds\nthat virtuous action and feeling consists of avoiding the extremes of\ndeficit and excess. The doctrine does not imply that we ought always\nto act moderately and with moderate feeling. Aristotle says that the\nmean is “relative to us,” giving the illustrative analogy\nthat too little food for Milo is too much for the beginner in athletic\nexercises (Nichomachean Ethics, 2.6). Depending on the\nsituation, the appropriate action and feeling may be extreme on a\ncommon sense understanding but appropriate given the agent and the\ncircumstances. Part of the contemporary revival of virtue ethics is\npremised partly on a reaction against the ambition of modern ethical\ntheory to guide primarily through general principles of action rather\nthan through the specification of ideal character traits. Virtue\nethics also tend to embody the theme that the ethical life of right\n(and in the case of Chinese and contemporary Western virtue ethics)\ncaring relationship to others is necessary for human flourishing. In\nthe Mencius this theme emerges in identification of the\ndistinctively human potentials with the incipient tendencies to\ndevelop the moral virtues (Mencius 2A6, 6A1, 6A3, 6A7).\nAristotle held that reason makes us distinctively human and that our\nreason and social nature compel recognition of the desirability of the\nethical life for human beings (see Nivison, 1996 for comparisons of\nAristotle and Mencius; and Yearley, 1990 for comparisons of Aquinas\nand Mencius). Xunzi is equally emphatic about the necessity of right\nand caring relationship to others for human flourishing, even though\nhe denies (at least when he is criticizing Mencius) that human nature\ncontains tendencies to engage in such relationships (see Ivanhoe,\n1991, on the way ethical norms help human beings to flourish; and\nNivison, 1996a, 1996b, Van Norden, 1992, 2007, Wong, 1996b, and Kline,\n2000, on the difference between Mencius and Xunzi’s theories of\nhuman nature; see Goldin, 1999, for a book-length treatment of\nXunzi’s philosophy; and Wong 2015a). \nThe similarities coexist with significant differences, however. There\nis no parallel in Greek virtue ethics for the centrality of family\nlife in the Confucian conception of the good life. Part of the reason\nfor this lies in the Confucian appreciation for the family as the\nfirst arena in which care, respect, and deference to legitimate\nauthority is learned (Analects 1.2; see also Cline, 2007,\n2013 for a discussion of the Confucian view of the family in moral\ndevelopment and for an interesting comparison to John Rawls’\nconception of the role of the family). Van Norden (2004, 2007) points\nout that the moral emotion of shame plays a crucial role in\nMencius’ conception of moral development and that there is no\ncomparable role played by the emotion in Aristotle. He suggests that\nthe explanation lies in Mencius’ greater focus on moral agency\nin media res. The way in which particularist reasoning is\nillustrated in historical stories such as those about Shun is also a\ndistinctive feature of Confucian ethics. These stories present\nparadigms of good judgment and of good individuals, from which persons\nengaged in ethical cultivation of themselves should learn. Another\ndistinctive feature of Confucian ethics is the emphasis it gives to an\naesthetic dimension of the good life. To act according to ritual\npropriety is not simply to conform to notions of appropriate behavior\nin this or that context. It is to act with the right attitude,\nreverence, say, in the case of serving one’s parents in an\nappropriately respectful manner, and it is to express such an attitude\nso gracefully and without internal conflict that doing so has become\nsecond nature (see Kupperman, 1999 and Cua, 1997). The importance\nattached to li, to ritual propriety itself, indicates the\nConfucian appreciation for the role of culture and convention in\nenabling human beings to express ethical attitudes toward each another\nsuch as care and respect (see Cua, 2005 for rich explorations of\nli in the thought of Xunzi). It is not as if bowing naturally\nmeans deferential respect; it must be agreed through\nconvention that it does mean something like this (see Fingarette,\n1972; see Shun, 1993, for a discussion of the relationship of\nli to the important virtue of ren).  \nConfucianism offers a rich moral psychology. Among sinologists,\nNivison (1996; see especially “Motivation and Moral Action in\nMencius,” “Philosophical Voluntarism in Fourth-Century\nChina,” “Two Roots or One?” and “Xunzi on\n‘Human Nature’”) was especially influential in\nmining Confucian texts for insight into moral psychology from a\ncomparative perspective. Van Norden (2017) holds that Confucianism has\na decided edge over modern Western philosophy in terms of presenting\nrich and insightful theories of moral development. On his narrative,\nearly modern Western philosophy abandoned Aristotelian explanations by\nappeal to actualization of potentiality for quantitative explanations\nin terms of material objects in motion. While this was a positive\ndevelopment for the natural sciences, it was a disaster for ethics,\nparticularly in the intersection with moral psychology. It is probably\nnot just the early modern turn in the West toward mechanistic\nquantitative explanations that accounts for the comparative\ndifference. Aristotle’s explanation of the actualization of the\npotential for virtue was relatively skimpy in gesturing toward\nhabituation as the means, whereby one becomes courageous by acting\ncourageously, and so on (Nichomachean Ethics II.1). Xunzi\nseems to have a similar problem when he declares on the one hand that\nhuman nature is bad, with powerful self-seeking and competitive\nimpulses that threaten to throw human being into destructive conflict\nwith one another, and on the other hand, that the performance of\nritual, through following models of virtue, and through a social\nenvironment with roles fashioned to be in accordance with standards of\nrightness (yi), human beings can come to love virtue for its\nown sake. However, Xunzi at one point in his chapter on ritual\nobserves that all creatures of blood and breath (qi) know to\nlove their own kind and long after others of its group if they become\nseparated. Human beings are most of all like this, which is why\nrituals such as mourning and grief for loved ones are so powerful and\nhelp shape our impulses for the better. Ritual, which most of the time\nseems to have a restraining, reformative function in Xunzi, now\nacquires a crucial expressive function that strengthens and enhances\nmotivations that are congenial to morality. It is at this point that\nXunzi, however inadvertently, points toward a more complex and\npluralistic theory of human nature that becomes a more plausible\ntheory of moral development because it takes just enough from\nMencius’s theory that there are natural inclinations that could\nform a positive basis for the love and development of virtue (Wong,\n1996a; 2015a; for a different view of how ritual works in\nXunzi’s theory of moral development see Sung, 2015; 2017). \nMencius, of course, attributes a much more extensive set of positive\ntendencies such as natural compassion for the suffering of others that\ncan be shaped into virtues such as ren or humanity, and the\ndebate between Xunzi and Mencius is how much the development of virtue\nis set up by inborn affective and cognitive impulses and intuitions,\nand how much is shaped by cultural processes and the influence of\nnorms. This brings out another reason why Confucians were set up to\nproduce a rich moral psychology. They took emotions as a potentially\npositive base for virtue, a base that could be made receptive to the\ninsights of reflection and reasoning. Modern Western philosophy is\noften more inclined to see emotion as an impediment to morality, as in\nKant (except for the feeling of respect for the moral law) or as a\ncompetitor to reasoning and its potential master, as in Hume. Rarely\nis there an exploration of reasoning and emotion as partners that\ndevelop as they interact with each other (for a comparison see Wong,\n2015b, 2017).  \nThe differences between Mencius’ and Xunzi’s theories are\nsubstantial and raise sophisticated philosophical issues that remain\nrelevant to this day. Xunzi launched a vigorous critique of\nMencius’ claim for the existence of natural tendencies that form\nthe basis for development of a good person. In arguing against\nMencius, he presupposes a strict separation between that which is\ngiven in human nature and that which must be developed through\ndeliberate effort. Mencius’ conception of human nature, on the\nother hand, presupposes that what is in human nature can be something\nthat can be further developed along tendencies that are given but need\nto be triggered by interaction through learning in the right\nenvironment. Their differing conceptions of human nature exemplify a\nvariability and ambiguity in conceptions of human nature that is a\nsubject of analysis for contemporary philosophers of science (see\nGriffiths, 2002; Wong, 2015a). Furthermore, Mencius and Xunzi differ\nin their theories as to whether ethical norms and values are\ndiscovered or invented, with Mencius’ theory construing them as\npart of the order established by Heaven, and Xunzi’s theory\nconstruing them as constructed by human beings to solve problems for\ncooperation arising from the self-seeking and competitiveness of human\nnature. \nOne debate that arises within the comparative perspective, however, is\nwhether the Confucians had anything that fits the Western notion of\nmorality. The words ’ethics’ and ‘ethical’\nhave been used to in this piece to remain neutral on this matter. Some\ncontemporary thinkers (most prominently, Williams, 1985) have tended\nto confine the ‘moral’ to a relatively narrow set of\ncharacteristics associated with Kant’s moral philosophy –\na belief in universal laws validated by pure reason, a belief that\nresponsibility for one’s actions requires a freedom from\ndetermination from external causes – and on this view of the\nmoral, it could be argued that there is no equivalent in Chinese\nphilosophy (see Rosemont, 1988). If such a contrast is made, then\nConfucians are acknowledged to have an ethics as opposed to a\nmorality, where an ethics does embrace questions about value, how one\nought to live one’s life, and what the good life consists in.\nOne question to be debated here is whether Western notions of the\nmoral are so uniform and narrow as to conform to one\nphilosopher’s (even a great one) specific conception of the\nmoral. On the criteria given by Williams, Hume wouldn’t have a\nmorality, even though he used the term. It is true that a dominant\nstrain of modern Western morality makes use of a crucial distinction\nbetween a morally significant sphere of life that has to do primarily\nwith one’s relationships with others and a “private”\nsphere of life in which one has moral “time-off” that is\nno one’s business but one’s own. If this dominant strain\nis taken to define morality, then Confucians would have no morality.\nIt also would eliminate certain utilitarians from having a morality:\nthose who insist that there is no purely private sphere because any\ntype of action or omission could have substantial impact on others\ngiven the right circumstances. \nAnother potential contrast arises from the focus in modern Western\nmoralities on individual rights to liberty and to other goods, where\nthe basis for attributing such rights to persons lies in a moral worth\nattributed to each individual independently of what conduces to\nindividual’s responsibilities to self and others. Confucianism\nlacks a comparable concept, given its assumption that the ethical life\nof responsibility to others and individual flourishing are\ninextricably intertwined (Shun, 2004). A frequent criticism from the\nWestern side is that Confucianism fails to provide adequate protection\nto those legitimate interests an individual has that may conflict with\ncommunity interests. On the other side, some advocates of Confucian\nethics criticize rights-focused moralities for ignoring the social\nnature of human beings and of portraying human life in an excessively\n“atomistic” or “individualist” conception of\npersons (e.g., Rosemont, 1986). Against those who argue that\nConfucianism does not protect the individual enough, it could be\nreplied that the Confucian framework of responsibilities to others can\nafford significant protections to the individual and arguably\naddresses the human need for community and belonging better than\nrights frameworks (Rosemont, 1991a, 2004). Another criticism from the\nWestern side is that the dignity of the individual cannot be honored\nwithout recognition of individual rights. It has been replied,\nhowever, that dignity can lie in one’s human capacity to\nparticipate in the distinctively human life of relationship and in\nliving up to one’s responsibilities to others (Ihara, 2004).\nMoreover, it is possible that rights in some sense can play a role in\nthe Confucian tradition, even if such rights are not grounded in the\nidea of the independent moral worth of the autonomous individual.\nWithin that tradition, rights may be seen as necessary for protecting\nindividuals’ interests when the right relationships of care\nirretrievably break down (Chan, 1999). Rights in the sense of\njustified claims to be protected in one’s speech even when\nprotest and dissenting against authority can be justified as conducive\nto the health of the community (Wong, 2004a). Mencius recognized a\nright to revolution against tyrannical kings (1B8); he furthermore\nadvised kings to attach more weight to the opinions of his people than\nto those of his ministers and officers in making certain crucial\ndecisions (1B7). Xunzi recognized the need for subordinates to speak\ntheir views freely to their superiors (Xunzi,\nZigong, Way of the Son). If we carry the reasoning\nin Mencius and Xunzi one step further, we see the need to protect a\nspace in which they may speak freely without fear of suppression, and\nhence a derive a right in the “thin” sense of what one has\nwhenever one has justifiable claims on others to assure one’s\npossession of things or one’s exercise of certain capacities.\n(This article focuses on rights in relation to classical Confucianism.\nFor a detailed discussion of rights discourse in seventeenth and\neighteenth century Confucianism, see Angle, 2002). On the other side,\none must be wary of oversimplifications of Western rights-oriented\nethical codes. The social nature of persons is not denied by all such\ncodes (of the major theories only Hobbes seems to take an\nunambiguously “atomistic” view of human beings, and\nRousseau and Locke seem to require no such view). \nThe fact that there are developments of each tradition that bring each\ncloser to the other may suggest that each could learn from the other.\nEven if not all rights-oriented codes are “atomistic,” an\nincreasing worry about Western culture as it has actually developed in\npractice is the prevalence of an individualism that Tocqueville\ndefined as a “calm and considered feeling which disposes each\ncitizen to isolate himself from the mass of his fellows and withdraw\ninto the circle of family and friends,” such that “with\nthis little society formed to his taste he gladly leaves the greater\nsociety to look after itself.” Such people, Tocqueville\nobserved, form “the habit of thinking of themselves in isolation\nand imagine that their whole destiny is in their hands.” They\ncome to “forget their ancestors” and also their\ndescendants, as well as isolating themselves from their\ncontemporaries. “Each man is forever thrown back on himself\nalone, and there is danger that he may be shut up in the solitude of\nhis own heart” (1969, pp. 506, 508). Those impressed with this\nworry and connect it with gross inequality in the most affluent nation\nin the world would do well to look to a tradition that appreciates the\nway we thrive or falter within specific communities that nurture or\nshut us out. Or consider an intriguing argument by Bell (2008, pp.\n43–55) that in contemporary East Asian societies the importance\nplaced on social hierarchy provides an outlet for the rich and\npowerful members of these societies to distinguish themselves, whereas\nin socially egalitarian societies such as the U.S., the primary outlet\nis through the accumulation of wealth, and hence the relative economic\nequality of East Asian societies as compared to Western societies such\nas the U.S. On the other side, a tradition that has tended to value\nthe idea of social harmony at the cost of sufficiently protecting\ndissenters who desire to point out abuses of power or just plain bad\nthinking by authorities would do well to look at another tradition\nthat does not value social harmony as highly but has endured and is\nvigorous. \nThese arguments for greater compatibility between Chinese and Western\nethics do not eliminate all significant differences between them on\nthe subject of rights. It is possible to argue that even if\nresponsibility-frameworks are developed and institutionalized to\nprovide genuine protection to dissenting individuals, they cannot\nprovide as much protection as rights frameworks when individual\ninterests seriously threaten communal or social interests. And if\nWestern ethics sometimes provides more protection to the individual\nagainst communal or social interests, this could be seen as\nunacceptable from a Confucian standpoint. One possible stance on these\nkinds of differences is evaluational incommensurability. The stance is\nthat each tradition is not wrong to emphasize different values, that\nno judgment of superiority can be made here. The argument for this may\nstart with the claim that each sort of ethic focuses on a good that\nmay reasonably occupy the center of an ethical ideal for human life.\nOn the one hand, there is the good of belonging to and contributing to\na community; on the other, there is the good of respect for the\nindividual apart from any potential contribution to community. It\nwould be surprising, the argument goes, if there were just one\njustifiable way of setting a priority with respect to the two goods,\neven when we take into account the justifiable ways in which the two\nkinds of ethics could be brought closer together. On this view,\ncomparative ethics teaches us about the diversity and richness of what\nhuman beings may reasonably prize, and about the impossibility of\nreconciling all they prize in just a single ethical ideal (e.g., Wong,\n1984, 1996). \nDaoist ethics are often cited as exemplars of substantial difference\nwith the Western tradition. Both the Zhuangzi’s and\nDaodejing’s commendation of wuwei is a case in\npoint. It is a commendation of a style of action that consists in\nbeing receptive rather than aggressive, following from behind rather\nthan leading in front, accommodating rather than confrontational, and\nbeing flexible and ready to change with the situation rather than\nrigid and operating from general predetermined principles. While the\ntheme of attunement with the world is present at the roots of Western\ntraditions, no major ethic in the West gives the ideal of spontaneous,\neffortless attunement the kind of centrality Daoism gives to it, and\nindeed, Slingerland (2003) argues that the ideal of spontaneous and\neffortless action that is in accord with the normative order of the\ncosmos is quite important to the early Confucian thinkers. Ames (1994)\ntraces the wu-wei ideal as it is applied to rulership in\nConfucianism, Daoism, and Legalism. \nAnother case for substantial difference with the Western tradition\nrests on the strong skepticism in Daoist ethics about the benefits of\nconceptualized distinctions between good and bad, right and wrong. Yet\nthese ethics make recommendations that add up to putting forward a way\nof life. In the Zhuangzi, that way of life involves not\ntaking taking oneself and one’s ideas so seriously. Chapter two\ncontains a story of monkeys who were furious with their keeper when he\nannounced the policy of three nuts every morning and four in the\nevening. The keeper then announced a change: “four nuts in the\nmorning and three in the evening,” this time to the great\ndelight of the monkeys. Kupperman (1999) suggests that we are invited\nto view our own urgent concerns in the humorous light of the\nmonkeys’ concern about the difference between the two policies.\nAt the same time we are invited to question our own judgment of the\nmonkeys. Why think the monkeys are silly if our urgent concerns might\nlook to some other kind of creature the way the monkeys’\nconcerns look to us? The way of life recommended in the\nZhuangzi, then, includes openness to what might escape our\ncurrent conceptualizations and preconceptions. We are invited to see\nthat our conceptualizations of the world are inevitably incomplete and\ndistorting. We attempt to order the world by sorting its features\nunder pairs of opposites, but opposites in the real world never match\nup neatly with our conceptual opposites. Real “opposites”\nescape our attempts to cleanly separate them. Despite our best\nefforts, they switch places in our conceptual maps, blur, and merge\ninto one another. That is why chapter two of the Zhuangzi\nsays that the sage recognizes a “this,” but a\n“this” which is also “that,” a\n“that” which is also “this.”The appropriate\nresponse to the inadequacies of our conceptual structures is to remain\nopen to what those structures distort or hide. In chapter five, men\nwho have had their feet amputated as criminal punishment are scorned\nby society, but not by their Daoist masters, who see what is of\nworth in them. In chapter one, Zhuangzi chastises his friend\nHuizi for failing to see beyond the ordinary, humdrum uses of some\nlarge gourds. Huizi tried using one of the gourds for a water\ncontainer, but it was so heavy he couldn’t lift it. He then\ntried to make dippers from them, but they were too large and unwieldy.\nHe deemed the gourds of no use and smashed them to pieces. Zhuangzi\nasks why he didn’t think of making the gourd into a great tub so\nhe could go floating around the rivers and lakes, instead of worrying\nbecause it was too big and unwieldy to dip into things!\n“Obviously you still have a lot of underbrush in your\nhead!” concluded Zhuangzi. He does not deny that the more\nordinary uses are genuine uses for the gourds, and indeed, they are.\nRather, Zhuangzi’s point is to clear the underbrush from our\nheads and to get an enlarged view of what is of value. Much\nof the value of Daoist ethics lies in its warnings against the\nconstricting effects of conventional ethical codes, the blinkering of\nvision that comes with what we might otherwise regard as admirable\nintegrity and dedication. The other side of this warning is an\nintriguing positive: that there is a way we can pay attention to the\nworld that allows us to “see around” our blinkering\nconceptualizations, to see what is of value that we have missed, to\nmove with the grain of things. One of the central interpretive\nproblems concerning the Zhuangzi in particular is how to\nreconcile the skeptical themes about the limits of our concepts and\ntheories with the recommendations for living in a certain way, since\nthe recommendations are framed with concepts (see Kjellberg and\nIvanhoe, 1996, Hansen, 2003, and Wong, 2005 for a variety of\ninterpretations). \nIt is not easy to find an analogue to someone such as Zhuangzi in the\nWestern tradition. There are some important parallels in the\nHellenistic Stoics and Epicureans to certain themes in Zhuangzi. They,\nlike him, emphasized the need to accept the inevitable in human life,\nthe need to dampen one’s desires to achieve tranquility in the\nface of the inevitable, and to identify with the world that makes\nacceptance and dampening of desires possible (Nussbaum, 1994). On the\nother hand, there is contrast in the Stoic belief in logos as\nthe basis of order in the universe. There are parallels to some\nZhuangist themes in Nietzsche: the skepticism about the adequacy of\nour conceptualizations of the world and of value; the warnings against\nconventional moralities as constricting, and the awareness of how the\napplication of ethical judgment to others can be a means of asserting\npower over them (The Genealogy of Morals). However,\nZhuangzi’s vision possesses a generosity and inclusiveness, an\nembrace of the lowly and cast-off, that seems anathema to\nNietzsche’s celebration of the übermensch and his project\nof fashioning himself like a work of art. Nietzsche proposes strong,\nvital desire at the heart of this aesthetic project, rather than the\ndampening of desire. He represents a kind of radical individualism\nthat did not find a congenial home in the Chinese tradition (Solomon,\n1995). \nIn Buddhism, especially Chan Buddhism, there also is rejection of\nconventional ethical values as blinkering and distorting (see Hui\nNeng, Liuxu tanjing, and The Recorded Conversations\nof I-Hsüan), and also a sense that one can become\nattuned to the world so as to move with its grain. This is not\nsurprising since Buddhism was profoundly influenced by Daoism upon its\nimportation into China. However, Buddhism may have especially\nchallenging implications for Western ethics in its special emphasis on\nthe elimination of suffering and on the way it explains suffering by\nreferring to the human attachment to self as fixed ego entity. As\nnoted above in discussing Parfit’s connection to the Buddhist\nview of the self, realization that the self is not a bounded and\ndiscrete entity may encourage a much more impersonal view of oneself\nand one’s projects and desires. One’s concern widens to\nall of life, and one dampens one’s desires so as to lessen\nattachment to the self’s cares and concerns. Some may find this\nan unacceptably demanding ethic. It may seem to drain all passion from\nlife, and it requires that we dampen the attachment we have not only\nto our selves but also to special others. This negative reaction may\nfit with Kupperman’s (1999) characterization of much Western\nethics as upholding only a limited altruism that allows one a private\nsphere of life free from moral demands and in which one gives much\nmore weight to the cares and concerns of the self and those close to\nthe self. However, as the above comparison with Parfit suggests, there\nare themes in Western philosophy that parallel the kind of impersonal\naltruism urged upon us by Buddhism. Some utilitarians have strongly\nheld to the theme that each counts for one in calculating what\nproduces the greatest good, and they have derived challenging\nconsequences from that theme for the question of what one should be\nprepared to give to alleviate the suffering of strangers (see Singer,\n1972, and Unger, 1996), arguing that the way many in affluent nations\nindulge themselves and their own is simply insupportable in a world of\nwidespread and severe suffering. Some have seen the sort of impersonal\nconcern that utilitarianism may demand as an indication that it\nunsuitable for human beings, who are so strongly partial to themselves\nand their own (see Williams, 1981 and Wolf, 1982). Buddhism presses\nfor the possibility that impersonal concern is humanly possible, and\nthe fact that it is a vibrant and long-lived tradition with many\ncommitted practitioners provides some support for the viability of\nimpersonal concern as a ideal that is capable of claiming allegiance\nand influencing how people try to live their lives (see Flanagan, 2013\nfor a reference to Buddhism in support of the viability of such an\nideal . \nThe most obvious sin of doing comparative philosophy is assimilating\nanother tradition to one’s own by unreflectively importing\nassumptions, frameworks, and agendas into one’s reading of that\nother tradition. Sometimes too much charity (as a principle of\ninterpretation) is insufficiently respectful of the distinctness of\nthe other tradition. There are more subtle dangers. If one is a\ndissident from main trends in one’s home tradition, one is\ntempted to find another tradition that “got it right.”\nThis is fine as long as the desire to find another such tradition does\nnot lead to distortion or oversimplification of that other tradition\n(see Hansen, 1992, 2004, for discussions of taking Confucianism as\nrepresentative of the Chinese tradition as a whole and of trying to\nfind in Confucianism something one may perceive as lacking in\none’s own tradition). The result is a kind of\n“Orientalism” (Said 1978) that is turned on its head, so\nthat the radical other is now superior.  \nAnother debate involving this sort of possibility was initiated by\nGoldin (2003) and later on taken up by Slingerland (2013), who have\ncriticized interpretations (e.g., in Ames, 1993; Jullien, 2007) that\ntake Chinese thought to be innocent of commitment to mind/body dualism\n(which is implicitly or explicitly deemed to be a fundamental error).\nThey present historical and textual evidence to argue that some sort\nof mind/body dualism operated within many if not all early Chinese\ntexts. Slingerland also backs up his conclusions with qualitative and\nquantitative analysis designed to guard against cherry-picking\npassages from texts guided by one’s preconceptions of what is in\nthem. He uses keyword-focused random sampling of passages from the\npre-Qin corpus of received texts supplemented by recently discovered\narchaeological texts from Guodian. Goldin emphasizes that different\ntexts will reveal different views about the relationship of mind and\nbody, whereas Slingerland is inclined to think the texts tend to\nreveal belief in a “weak dualism” he believes to be a\nhuman universal. Weak dualism falls in between a strong dualism that\nposits an ontological distinction between mind and body, such as\nDescartes’ claim that mind and body are distinct substances with\nnothing in common, on the one hand, and a strong “holism”\nthat asserts no qualitative differences between mind and body. Weak\ndualism holds that there are functional and qualitative differences\nbetween mind and body without asserting ontological distinction.\nSlingerland sometimes mentions “weak holism” as a possible\nfourth position, but its difference with weak dualism is unclear. \nRaphals (2015) does explicitly include the latter as a fourth position\nand seems to distinguish the two intermediate positions according to\nwhether they emphasize more or less the distinction between mind and\nbody, noting that there is no firm boundary between the two.\nMencius’ conception of mind and body seems to fall somewhere in\nthis intermediate zone. He regards mind (xin) as an organ of\nthe body whose function is to think, and it has the four sprouts of\ngoodness. Thus there are functional and qualitative distinctions he\nmakes between mind and the (rest of the?) body, and the mind is\ncertainly functionally distinct, but it is consistent with what he\nsays to regard mind as composed of the same energy-stuff (qi)\nthat composes the body. Indeed, Chinese metaphysics later came to\ncommonly recognize qi as the universal stuff of the world. On\nthe other hand, as Goldin points out, no less a text than the\nZhuangzi provides passages that suggest the possibility of\ndisembodied minds, such as speculation that a dying friend might next\nturn up as a rat’s liver or an insect’s leg. Raphals\npoints out much of the interest and the variety of ways in which early\nChinese thought relates the mind to the body as lying not in the\ndualist/holist contrast but in the details, such as the body portrayed\nas the container of the mind, or the mind being ruler of the body.\nComparing ideas from Greek and Chinese texts, she finds that neither\ndualism nor holism is anyone’s cultural property. \nThe dangers of reading into another tradition one’s own peculiar\nassumptions on the one hand and on the other hand excessively\n“othering” it (even if in the service of saying they were\nright) are hard to avoid, or at least hard to avoid being accused of\nfalling prey to them. It is hard enough to master a single tradition\nto the point where one can avoid saying silly things about it. Are the\nrisks worth it? \nOne reason for thinking so is that comparative philosophy is an\ninstance of a sound and sensible strategy for doing philosophy. When\nfacing hard problems it is simply a good strategy to consider a wide\nrange of enduring, respected ideas bearing on those problems. We of\ncourse must be wary of the possibility that the other tradition is not\nreally addressing the same problem we are, or that it is addressing\nonly part of the problem we are addressing. But when there is common\naddress of a problem, it is not always the case that one tradition\nmust be adjudicated as entirely right and the other as entirely wrong.\nThere is a good possibility that each tradition has something\ninsightful to say about some aspect of the problem and that each\ntradition could incorporate something of what the other tradition has\nto say (see Yu and Bunnin, 2001). Yu (2007) appropriates\nAristotle’s conception of the friend as a second self, a mirror,\nby which one can come to know oneself better, one’s unexamined\npresuppositions, for instance. May Sim (2007) argues that\nAristotle’s metaphysics of the soul supplies a substantial self\nthat is both needed and presupposed by Confucius’ virtue ethics.\nAt the same time she argues that Aristotle’s metaphysics tilts\ntoo far towards an individualism that does not motivate sufficient\nattention to the culturally laden social relations required by his own\nethics of character and politics of virtue, and so Aristotelian ethics\ncould benefit by taking from Confucianism an acknowledgment of the\nethical importance of ceremony and decorum. When one crosses\ntraditions in enacting such strategies, there is the opportunity for\nfruitful interaction and mutual influence. Already discussed above is\nthe opportunity for fruitful interaction between rights-oriented\ntraditions and traditions such as Confucianism focused on the value of\nrelationship and community. \nConsider another area of potential interaction: when a tradition as\nlong-lived and as sophisticated as the Confucian tradition brims full\nwith writing on the nature of agency, human motivation, and the\nproblem of developing ethical excellence and commitment, one cannot\nafford to ignore it (see Ivanhoe, 2000, for portraits of the tradition\nof Confucian and neo-Confucian thinkers on these subjects).\nConfucianism and Daoism emphasize the need to to pay attention to the\nconcrete details of the situation at hand and displays healthy\nskepticism about the power of general principle to reveal what sort of\naction is suitable to the situation. Confucianism displays an\nappreciation for the power of community, custom, convention and\nceremony for helping to make vivid and concrete and meaningful such\nethical abstractions as love, respect, and care (Fingarette, 1972,\nShun, 1993, Kupperman, 2004). From these themes, there is much to be\nlearned, especially if one’s home tradition has had a strong\nfocus for a good portion of the modern period on the top-down\ndeduction of specific ethical judgments from extremely abstract\nprinciples. At the same time, an appreciation for the concrete and for\nthe culturally specific may obscure the possibility of general and\ntranscultural principles that help to evaluate the concrete and\nculturally specific, and the Chinese tradition could benefit from\ninteraction with the Western (Cua, 1985). In fact, one’s case\nfor the existence of transcultural principles becomes stronger when\none dives into other tradition and finds correlates to important\nthemes in one’s own tradition.  \nFlanagan (2017) identifies Mencius’ theory of the moral sprouts\nas the ancient precursor of moral modularity theory, an example of\nwhich is Haidt’s moral foundations theory. Just as Mencius held\nthat there are in contemporary parlance automatic,\naffective-cognitive-conative (prompting to action) inclinations and\nintuitions (such as our alarmed and distressed reaction upon seeing a\nchild about to fall into a well) that could develop into the moral\nvirtues (such as ren or humanity), so Haidt theorizes that\nthere are several such modules or “foundations”\n(Haidt’s look somewhat different from Mencius’, but one\nof Haidt’s modules is “harm/care or\nsuffering/compassion”) that form moralities. Flanagan compares\nMencius’ and Haidt’s theories, and finds that each\npossesses a different set of strengths and weaknesses. For example,\nMencius’ theory correctly does not encourage us to think that\nthe sprouts, which begin as automatic, intuitive reactions, remain\nthat way. One of the other Mencian sprouts is the capacity to make\ndistinctions between shi and fei (that’s it,\nand that’s not it, where the first has the connotation of\napproval and the second the connotation of disapproval), and this\ndevelops into the virtue of zhi or wisdom. It looks as if\nthis sprout is the inborn capacity that forms the basis of analogical\nreasoning and other kinds of reflection that in fact go into the\ndevelopment of the other sprouts. For example, natural compassion can\ngrow into the virtue of humanity only when we learn how to care for\nothers and respond to their suffering in an appropriate fashion.\nFlanagan thinks this is the right kind of picture. If we are talking\nabout moral development, what begins as automatic and intuitive should\ndevelop into something that is guided by knowledge, reflection and\nreasoning. By contrast, Haidt’s theory holds that the modules go\nall the way up, in the sense that they remain largely automatic and\nintuitive. On the other hand, Haidt’s theory shows a well-taken\nsensitivity to the possibility that the modules could take different\nforms in different cultures and societies, that some modules could\nreceive greater emphasis in some moralities, and that in fact\ndifferent moralities result from such variation in emphasis.  \nFinally, recall the case of the Buddhist ideal of impersonal concern\nbeing brought to bear on a debate in Western philosophy over the\nviability of ideals of impersonal concern. This illustrates the point\nthat comparative philosophy can stretch one’s sense of\npossibility, in this case, of human possibility. That is a benefit in\nitself. \nComparative philosophy that is done along the Chinese-Western axis can\nproceed from one end or the other, in the attempt to bring to bear\nconcepts, frameworks, and insights from one tradition to the project\nof making progress on questions and problems in the other tradition.\nKwong-loi Shun (2009) has observed that there has been an asymmetry in\nthe amount of work done in these two possible directions. There is\nmuch more work done that starts from the Western end and works towards\nthe Chinese end. Shun questions whether there is a good intellectual\ngrounding for this asymmetry, given that Chinese philosophy promises\nto illuminate some aspects of the ethical life that are not as well\nappreciated or studied in Western philosophy. The alternative, as Shun\nputs it, is that “that there is no such grounding and that the\n[asymmetrical] tendency is just a collective phenomenon explainable in\nterms of historical trends that wax and wane over time” (2009,\np. 475). In speculating about possible explanations exemplifying\nShun’s second alternative, it is worth reminding ourselves that\nthe trends of philosophy are often reflections or distillations of\nlarger historical trends and the shifting balances of power between\ndifferent regions of the world. If this is so, we may be witnessing an\nincipient correction in the asymmetry between Chinese and Western\nphilosophy. \nWhether such a sociological trend is fruitful is a question for\nphilosophical exploration. Sometimes what is gained through\ncomparative inquiry starts with the realization that concepts or major\ndistinctions that one has taken for granted as central to\nphilosophical inquiry are not taken to be so central or even have no\nclose equivalents in another philosophical tradition. That may further\nraise the issues of what role that concept is playing in the first\ntradition, whether the second tradition has no need for that role, and\nwhether this implies some fundamental difference in their orientations\ntoward the ethical life. Shun’s work (2014, 2015) on approaches\nto anger and resentment, and on the absence of a concept of\nforgiveness in Confucianism is an interesting case in point. The way\nthat this work points to a fundamental difference in orientation\ntoward the ethical life might best be brought out in comparison with\nP.F. Strawson’s characterization of resentment as “a\nreaction to injury or indifference.” It is an instance of the\nclass of “reactive attitudes” that rest on, and reflect,\nan expectation of, and demand for, “the manifestation of a\ncertain degree of goodwill or regard on the part of other human beings\ntowards ourselves;” or at least“an absence of the\nmanifestation of indifferent disregard” (2008, 15). Resentment,\nthen, is based on a sense of what is due to oneself, and may be\nconceived as a defense of self-respect. Forgiveness may be conceived\nas the foregoing of resentment, and a prominent form of forgiveness\nthat became established in the West is based on the idea that it\nshould only be given if the offender repents. Shun points out that\nConfucians generally regard resentment (yuan) as an emotion\none should rise above. Though anger might be appropriate as a response\nto someone else’s wrongful treatment of the self, it is properly\ndirected at the wrongful treatment rather than at the fact that it was\ndirected at oneself rather than someone else. One should be focused on\ndetermining the appropriate response going forward. This downgrading\nof the ethical status of resentment helps to explain the absence of an\nequivalent in Classical Chinese for forgiveness, especially the kind\nthat should be given only if the offender repents. Resentment is not\nregarded as something one may rightfully bear unless the offender\nrepents. Shun stresses that the generally negative attitude toward\nresentment in Confucianism does not imply a lack of concern for\nself-respect. The basis for self-respect should be the morality of\none’s own actions and character, not how others treat one. \nThere are conceptions of forgiveness in the Western tradition that are\ncloser in ethical spirit to the Confucian idea that one should rise\nabove resentment, such as ones that forgive the offender in order to\navoid bitterness and self-consuming anger and seek meaning and purpose\nin striving to prevent further wrongdoing in the future. However, it\nis significant that a very prominent form of Western forgiveness is\nthe foregoing of resentment, which in turn is regarded as appropriate\nand at one’s discretion to forego. It may be revealing of the\nunderlying ethical orientation that the focus is on what others owe to\nthe self, and that the basis of self-respect should depend on how\nothers treat one. That it is focused on the self may be an indication\nof Western individualism, but it is also arguably social in a way that\nmakes self-respect dependent on how others treat one. In this regard,\nConfucianism expresses a more independent spirit in locating the basis\nof self-respect in how the self responds to wrongdoing and not\nprimarily to what was done to oneself. Comparative philosophy can\nresult in surprising comparisons that require qualification of the\nusual broad-stroke comparisons such as individualistic versus social\norientations. \nIt was stipulated at the beginning that comparative philosophy brings\ntogether philosophical traditions that have developed in relative\nisolation from one another. It is time to emphasize the\n‘relative’ qualifier. A common assumption of those who do\nphilosophy in the West nowadays is that it had its roots in Greece.\nPark (2013), however, has argued that the more common view in the\neighteenth century was that it began in India and/or Africa, which\nthen passed it onto Greece. And as Van Norden (2017) points out,\nEuropean philosophers who encountered Chinese thought in the 17th\ncentury immediately recognized it as philosophy. The Jesuits, who were\ndeeply trained in philosophy, produced the first major translation of\nthe Analects into a European language, and titled it\nConfucius Sinarum Philosophus (Confucius the Chinese\nPhilosopher, 1687). Leibniz was greatly struck by the way the\nBook of Changes represents the structure of the world through\na system of broken and unbroken lines, which he believed to bear\nuncanny resemblance to his invention of binary arithmetic, which was\nto become the digital language of computers.  \nChinese and Western traditions may currently be undergoing an\nincreased period of interaction and mutual influence. Wong (2009)\ndevelops a metaethical theory drawing from contemporary forms of\nphilosophical naturalism, Hume, Mencius, and Xunzi. Stephen Angle\n(2012) defines two kinds of comparative philosophy: (a) “rooted\nglobal philosophy” is working within a particular live\nphilosophical tradition in such a way as to be open to stimulus and\ninsights from other philosophical traditions, and (b)\n“Constructive engagement,” on the other hand, is an\napproach that is focused on the interaction of stimulus and insights\nbetween two live philosophical traditions. Angle exemplifies the\nrooted approach by working within the neo-Confucian tradition and by\nbeing open to exchange with other philosophies, primarily within the\nAmerican tradition. At the same time, his position as an American\nphilosopher allows Angle to focus on mutually enriching interaction\nbetween American philosophy and neo-Confucianism. Joseph Chan is\ngrounded both in Confucian ethical and political thought, primarily\nclassical, and in contemporary Anglo-American political philosophy. He\nregards himself as a Confucian scholar in the sense of one who engages\nin the activity of making sense of Confucian thought, and develops,\nrevises, and improves it as a tradition. At the same time, his\nproposed improvements of the tradition are related to a broader\nargument that the modern language of freedom, rights, and democracy\nshould not and will not replace the traditional language of virtue,\nresponsibility, and benevolent care, but rather be enriched by it\n(2013).  \nHutton (2006), Sarkissian (2010) and Slingerland (2011) develop\nresponses based on Confucian moral psychology and virtue ethics to\nchallenges mounted by Gilbert Harman (1998–99) and John Doris\n(2002) to the viability of virtue ethics (as conceived in the Western\ntradition). A contingent of those working in Chinese philosophy have\nfound that its insights into moral psychology resonate with recent\nfindings in cognitive and social psychology and neuroscience (see\nFlanagan, 2017; Sarkissian, 2010; Slingerland, 2011; Wong 2015a,\n2015b; Cline, 2015; Bruya, 2015; Seok, 2017). Besides the\ncontributions of Confucian moral psychology, insights contained in\nDaoist texts such as the Zhuangzi resonate with recent\nfindings in cognitive psychology and cognitive science concerning the\nintuitive, automatic and non-conscious operations of the mind and body\n(Slingerland, 2014; Bruya, 2015; Wong, 2017). \nAs mentioned above, Cline (2007, 2013) argues that insights from the\nAnalects and from Rawls can be combined to produce a more\nplausible conception of how a sense of justice develops starting with\nthe family. More recently (2015), she has argued that Confucians were\nright about the critical importance of parental-child relationships to\nthe moral development and well-being of the individual, and connects\nwith contemporary psychological theories of development and successful\nsocial welfare programs that seek to support parents raising their\nchildren.  \nIn writing about the concepts of integrity and vulnerability as they\napply to early Confucian texts, Ing provides a particularly fruitful\ndemonstration of how the comparative philosopher can set up a\ndialogical relationship between the texts and the contemporary\ninquirer, such that “the text shapes the questions we ask as\nmuch as the questions we ask shape our readings of the texts”\n(2017: 10–11). ‘Integrity’ is a term for which there is no\nreadily translatable equivalent in classical Chinese. Ing first\nglosses it in a familiar way as wholeness and integration, but then\nrelying upon the Confucian idea that persons are at least partly\nconstituted by relationships, Ing proposes that integrity is\nunderstood as a social relation. The work of integration is not purely\ninternal but also about tending to one’s current relationships\nas well as entering into new ones that further self-cultivation.\nVulnerability also has the familiar meaning of susceptibility to harm,\nbut Ing imbues it with a meaning at home in certain feminist analyses\nand in Confucianism: an openness and affectivity that comes with\nrelationships, together with our human inability to predict, control\nand to fully know that to which we are open and how it will affect us.\nOur vulnerability to harm is of a piece with that which makes our\nlives most worthwhile. Because our relationships are plural and of\ndifferent kinds, we are vulnerable to conflicts between their\nrequirements. Confucians have traditionally been much concerned with\nconflicts engendered by one’s attempts to better a social and\npolitical world rife with corruption and immorality. One prominent\nstance toward these conflicts present in some of the most prominent\nConfucian texts such as the Mencius and the work of Zhu Xi is\nthat an inability to resolve such conflicts stems from a lack of skill\nor virtue. The stories about Shun the sage-king told in the\nMencius (cited in section 2 above) are presented as models of\nskilled and virtuous resolution of value conflicts. However, an\nalternative stance toward value conflicts also found in a tradition as\nrich and as diverse as Confucianism is that the world can sometimes\ndefeat even the best we can muster from ourselves. One particularly\nstriking apparent clash of values that resists harmonization is the\nstory of Shen Ming as told by the Han Shi Waizhuan. Shen Ming\nbecame minister of Chu. Enemies captured and threatened to execute his\nfather in an attempt to get him to turn against Chu. Known for his\nfiliality, Shen nevertheless decided to attack and defeated the\ninsurgents, and his father was killed. Unable to bear the fact that he\ndid not fulfill his duties of filiality while maintaining loyalty to\nhis ruler, Shen killed himself. The tragedy of this situation is\ncompounded by Shen Ming’s being initially reluctant to accept\nthe position because he feared conflicts between loyalty to ruler and\nfilial care. He accepts only at his father’s urging him to do\nso, partly because he would with his salary be better able to support\nhis father. An act of filial care thus leads to the father’s\ndeath for the sake of loyalty to ruler. That which is of greatest\nvalue to us can make our lives impossible. Such a conclusion is not\nunfamiliar, of course, but the path we take to get to it, through a\ndialogue between traditions, brings it home with a force and vivacity\nthat demonstrates the power of comparative philosophy.
