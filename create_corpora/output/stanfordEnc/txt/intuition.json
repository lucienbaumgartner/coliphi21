Very likely, as you considered it, that\nclaim seemed true to you. Something similar probably happens when you\nconsider the following propositions: \nThe focus of this entry is intuitions—mental states or events in\nwhich a proposition seems true in the manner of these\npropositions. \nIt appears clear that ordinary usage includes more in the extension of\nthe term “intuition” than such states, as it would allow\nthat a parent might have an intuition that their child is innocent of\nsome crime or an archaeologist might have an intuition that an ancient\nsite of some interest was in a certain area. Some psychological\nresearch seems similarly permissive. Consider recent research on\n“intuitions” in naturalistic decision making (Klein 1998).\nSuch research has shown that agents with sufficient experience in a\ngiven domain (e.g., neonatal nursing, fire-fighting, or chess) arrive\nat judgments and make decisions on the basis of a cognitive process\nother than conscious considerations of various options and the\nweighing of evidence and utilities. Such expert\n“intuitions” that some infant suffers from sepsis, that a\nfire will take a certain course, or that a certain chess move is a\ngood one, appear immediately in consciousness. \nLess important than linguistic usage in various domains is whether our\ntheorizing captures the relevant psychological and epistemological\njoints to be found in the world. The focus of the present entry is the\nrole of intuitions in distinctively philosophical (and other\n“armchair”) inquiry. It is plausible (and will be assumed\nhere, but see Nado 2014 for doubts) that the intuitions of interest in\nphilosophy constitute a single epistemic and psychological kind\nexemplified by [I1]–[I4] and by many additional examples which\nappear in\n §2.2\n and\n §2.3\n below, but not the sort noted in the previous paragraph. \nSome philosophers equate intuitions with beliefs or with some kind of\nbelief. For example, David Lewis writes, \nOur “intuitions” are simply opinions; our philosophical\ntheories are the same. Some are commonsensical, some are\nsophisticated; some are particular, some general; some are more firmly\nheld, some less. But they are all opinions…. (1983: x) \nSuch remarks suggest the following account: \nWhy adopt [A1]? Some may be moved to do so on grounds of ontological\nparsimony. If intuitions are beliefs, we need accept no new kind\npsychological state. Furthermore, there is clearly a tight link\nbetween intuitions and beliefs in that one typically believes the\ncontents of one’s intuitions. \nHowever, that belief that p is neither necessary nor sufficient\nfor intuition that p is suggested by conflicts between a\nperson’s beliefs and their intuitions. One plausible\ncharacterization of a paradox holds that it is a set of a\npropositions, each of which is intuitive, but not all of which could\nbe true. If one has reasoned one’s way to a satisfactory\nresolution of a paradox and identified the false proposition, one\noften still has the intuition that the rejected proposition is true.\nHence, supposing that in such a case one’s beliefs are not\ncontradictory, one can have an intuition that p while one does\nnot believe p and one can have a belief that p without\nhaving an intuition that p. Indeed, even before such reasoning,\none might suspend belief about the contradictory set while each\nremained intuitive. More generally, it seems that one may believe\nsomething—that some theory is true, that some mathematical or\nlogical proposition is a theorem, that one is hungry, or that a person\nis now speaking—without having any intuition that p and\nso belief that p is not sufficient for intuition that\np. \nSuch cases also illustrate an important feature of\nintuitions—their relative causal independence from explicit\nbelief. An analogy with perception is helpful. One might, when viewing\nthe Müller-Lyer illusion, experience one line as longer than the\nother even though one, having repeatedly measured the lines, firmly\nbelieves them to be of equal length. Just such an analogy is invoked\nwhen, for example, it is suggested that some moral intuitions may\nbe \nineliminable moral illusion[s], similar to certain optical illusions\nwhich do not lose their intuitive appeal even when theory tells us\nbetter. (Kagan 1989: 15) \nA more discriminating version of this sort of account holds that\nintuitions are beliefs with a suitable etiology. One such\naccount, favored by many psychologists and philosophers with\nnaturalistic inclinations, treats intuitions as beliefs without a\nconscious or introspectively accessible inferential etiology (Gopnik\nand Schwitzgebel 1998; Devitt 2006: 491; Kornblith 1998) as in \nOn [A2], beliefs with an inferential origin of which a person is\nconscious are not intuitions. However, [A2] still mistakenly includes\nnon-inferential perceptual beliefs, memory beliefs, and introspective\nbeliefs as intuitions. Moreover [A2], like [A1], runs afoul of the\nfact that one can have intuitions the contents of which one does not\nbelieve. The former problem might be circumvented by a content\nrestriction on the sort of non-inferential belief at issue or further\netiological restrictions. The latter problem does not appear so easily\ncircumvented. \nA yet more discriminating etiological amendment to the belief analysis\n(Ludwig 2007: 135) is \nThis analysis is not open to many of the objections to [A1] and [A2].\nIt does not count an introspective, memory, or perceptual belief as an\nintuition. However, on the assumption that the concepts in question\nare not contradictory, it may imply (depending on what is required for\ncompetence with a concept) that intuitions are infallible. Even if\nintuitions are infallible, if S has mistakenly rejected one of\nthe propositions making up a paradox, p, it seems she might,\ncontrary to [A3], still have the intuition that p. Finally,\n[A3] appears to make the direct introspective judgment that one has an\nintuition difficult to justify, as one lacks direct introspective\naccess to the non-conscious causes of one’s beliefs. \nPeter van Inwagen claims that intuitions might be \nin some cases, the tendencies that make certain beliefs attractive to\nus, that ‘move’ us in the direction of accepting certain\npropositions without taking us all the way to acceptance. (1997:\n309) \nThis suggests something like the following: \nIf a disposition to believe is a propositional attitude, such an\naccount would allow that intuitions are propositional attitudes and,\nunlike belief analyses, allow that one may have an intuition without\nbelief. However, [A4] appears too liberal in placing no constraints on\nthe nature or source of the disposition in question. One might be\ndisposed to believe that a dog is nearby if one turns one’s head\nand looks, disposed to believe one is in pain if one reflects upon\nit, or even disposed to believe a complex theorem if one were to reason\nappropriately. None of these cases of being disposed to believe is,\ntaken alone, sufficient for an intuition. Additionally, [A4] has, on\nsome views of dispositions, the implication that a person’s\nbelieving p cannot be explained by their having an intuition\nthat p. \nSuch concerns about [A4] may be met with a restriction on the ground\nof the disposition. A more plausible account (Sosa 1998) is: \nHowever, many claim that the primary notion of intuition is one on\nwhich S has an intuition that p only when S is\noccurrently in the relevant conscious psychological state. If so, any\npurely dispositionalist account fails to capture the occurrent\nconscious character of intuitions in much the way dispositional\nanalyses of other conscious states fail. It is quite possible to have,\nat a time, a large number of dispositions to believe while failing to\nhost, at that time, a single intuition. For example, a person might\nhave an intuition that the naïve comprehension axiom is true when\nasked to consider it, but not have such an intuition while driving\nhome in heavy traffic. And yet it may be true throughout that she is\ndisposed to believe the proposition merely upon understanding it\n(Bealer 1998: 209). As well, one may now have direct introspective\nknowledge that one has an intuition that p while one has no\nsuch direct introspective knowledge regarding one’s\ndispositions, especially one’s non-activated dispositions, to\nbelieve on the basis of mere understanding. (For additional discussion\nof dispositionalist analyses see Pust 2000, Erlenbaugh and Molyneux\n2009, and Koksvik 2011.) \nA final family of accounts holds that an intuition is a sui\ngeneris occurrent propositional attitude, variously characterized\nas one in which a proposition occurrently seems true (Bealer\n1998, 2002; Pust 2000; Huemer 2001, 2005), in which a proposition is\npresented to the subject as true (Chudnoff 2011a; Bengson\n2015), or which pushes the subject to believe a proposition\n(Koksvik 2011). Such views are united in denying that belief that\np is necessary or sufficient for an intuition that p and\nin rejecting dispositional analyses of intuition. The close connection\nbetween intuition that p and disposition to believe p is\nexplained by claiming that intuitions typically serve as the ground of\nthe disposition to believe p. \nAccording to proponents of accounts of this sort, when one has an\nintuition that p, one does not merely represent or believe or\nconsider p. Rather, p is the content of a distinctive\noccurrent conscious non-belief propositional attitude. Bealer, for\nexample, claims that \nWhen you have an intuition that A, it seems to you\nthat A. Here ‘seems’ is understood, not in its use\nas a cautionary or “hedging” term, but in its use as a\nterm for a genuine kind of conscious episode. For example, when you\nfirst consider one of de Morgan’s laws, often it neither seems\ntrue nor seems false; after a moment’s reflection, however,\nsomething happens: it now just seems true. (Bealer 1998: 207) \nSome philosophers who endorse such views also hold that perceptual\n(and other) experiences have propositional contents and seek to\nprovide an account of the distinctive features of intuition,\nperception and other seemings or experiences. \nAccording to the “seemings” version of such a view, an\nindiscriminate account of intuition would be the following: \nWhile this account seems fitting for much psychological work on the\ntopic of intuitions, it is insufficiently discriminating. If memorial\nor introspective seemings with propositional content exist, they are\nnot plausibly identified with intuitions of the sort with which this\nentry began. Moreover, when conjoined with the view that\nperceptual experience consists of a suitable seeming that\np, this view implies that there are perceptual intuitions.\nClarity is served by stipulating that such states are not intuitions\neven if they are all species of some common genus. \nA more discriminating account is the following: \nSome, however, have claimed that there is an important distinction\nbetween the intuitions of primary interest in philosophical inquiry\nand other states which involve intellectual seemings that p.\nBealer, for example, claims that philosophical inquiry typically\nrelies upon “a priori intuitions” which must be\ndistinguished from the “physical intuitions” elicited by\nscientific thought experiments in that the latter do not present\nthemselves as necessary while the former do (1998: 165). Those who\nwish to distinguish the states involved in scientific thought\nexperiments from those typically involved in philosophical inquiry may\neither endorse [A7] and reject the suggestion that such physical\nintuitions involve the same intellectual seeming or impose further\nconditions on those intuitions of distinctive philosophical relevance\nas in the following accounts: \n[A8] renders all rational intuitions overtly modal in content and, on\na view of concept possession according to which possessing the concept\nc at t requires the ability to deploy c in\nthought at t, requires a level of sophistication not obviously\nhad by the philosophical innocent who is, nonetheless, presumably\ncapable of having a rational intuition (Pust 2000: 38; Ludwig 2007:\n136). Moreover, possibility intuitions are also essential to\nphilosophical practice and if the proponent of [A8] wishes to include\npossibility claims as the contents of intuitions (rather than treating\nthem as inferentially justified by a rational intuition and the\nprinciple that what is necessarily possible is possible), then they\nmust treat such intuitions as possessed of an iterated modal\npropositional content. \n[A9] (see Pust 2000: 46) requires a single occurrent conscious\npsychological state in rational intuition and distinguishes that state\nfrom physical intuitions while allowing that a naïve agent might\nhave a rational intuition even though not currently deploying the\nconcept of metaphysical necessity. It also does not require that a\npossibility intuition involve an occurrent iterated modal content.\nHowever, because it leaves the distinction between a rational and\nphysical (or other) intuitions sometimes dependent on dispositional\nrather than occurrent factors, [A9] may raise worries about our\nability to discern directly that we harbor a rational intuition. \nSome philosophers maintain that such sui generis\npropositional attitudes do not exist or are not part of their own\nmental life. For example, Williamson writes, \nFor myself, I am aware of no intellectual seeming beyond my conscious\ninclination to believe the Gettier proposition… . These\nparadigms provide no evidence of intellectual seemings, if the phrase\nis supposed to mean anything more than intuitions in Lewis’s or\nvan Inwagen’s sense. (2007: 217) \nProponents of such accounts must be concerned to explain the error of\ntheir opponents and, ideally, to enable them to locate the states in\nthemselves. (See Chudnoff 2011a and Koksvik 2011 for attempts to help\nsuch skeptics by describing carefully that which they should\nseek.) \nWilliamson (2007: 218–219) argues against analyses of the sort\nnow under consideration and in favor of a more permissive belief or\ndispositional analysis by noting that a wide variety of propositions\nmay be properly called “counterintuitive” and that this\nclass does not consist merely of the negations of propositions which\nare, according to more restrictive accounts of intuition, the contents\nof intuitions. For example, Williamson points out that philosophical\nviews which entail that there are no mountains are often thought, in\nvirtue of such entailments, to be highly counterintuitive. The\nproposition that there are mountains is, however, not the\ncontent of an intuition on any of the accounts in this family. \nOne possible rejoinder to Williamson’s argument would be to\ncharacterize the counterintuitive claim as the claim that no suitable\narrangement of matter is metaphysically sufficient for the presence of\na mountain (i.e., that mountains are impossible) and there is no\nreason why the negation of this proposition cannot be, on more\nrestrictive accounts of intuition, the content of an intuition.\nAnother possible rejoinder would point out that we have extremely good\ngrounds for believing that there are mountains and to suggest that the\ncomplaint that p is counterintuitive is merely the claim that\nnot-p is extremely well-justified. \nIt has thus far been assumed that intuitions always take propositions\nas their objects. Some might disagree, holding that we have de\nre or objectual intuitions of properties or states of affairs.\nIndeed, it might be held that our de re grasp of various\nproperties is what grounds or justifies our assent to propositions\ninvolving them. Pursuit of this issue would require a detailed account\nof propositions and properties and their relations. It would also\nrequire detailed accounts of the de dicto and de re\nattitudes. None of these explorations can be undertaken here. It\nshould be noted, however, that such a conception of our de re\ngrasp of properties lurks under the surface of many rationalist\naccounts whether framed in terms of concepts or properties (Bealer\n1998; BonJour 1998) and is even more explicit in the claim that we\nhave knowledge by acquaintance of universals (Russell 1912). \nIn addition, the precise conception of propositional contents may have\nto be varied with the account of intuition. For example, those who\nappeal to propositions which seem true or which one is inclined to\nbelieve would presumably hold that what we are justified in believing\nvia rational intuition is not a pure Russellian proposition\nbut rather either a Fregean proposition or a Russellian proposition\nunder something like a mode of presentation. \nFinally, the focus above has been on intuitions as psychological\nstates or events. Sometimes the issues surrounding intuitions are\nframed in terms of whether there is a distinct faculty of\nintuition. Of course, to the extent that intuitions are causally\nexplicable, there is some process which produces them and\nsome may wish to call that process a “faculty.” If that is\nall that is meant by the term, then no harm is done. Still, while such\ntalk may have its place (especially in various cognitive scientific\nattempts to explain the occurrence of intuitions), taking it to mean\nmore than just suggested seems to prejudice the issue of how much\nintuitive justification is like the justification produced by\nempirical faculties like vision and to invite dismissive caricatures\nof the view that intuitions serve to justify beliefs. \nAs noted in\n §1,\n the focus of the present entry is the role of intuitions in\nphilosophy. It is as accounts of such intuitions that the accounts\nabove were evaluated. Hence, in what follows, it will be assumed that\nthe appropriate account of the states at issue is some relatively\nrestrictive version of the sui generis state account\n (§1.3).\n Such an assumption is not, however, essential to much of what\nfollows. \nIn light of the discussion of\n §1,\n some of the states which are included in more expansive accounts of\nintuition might be better taken to be perceptual seemings or\nexperiences of the sort endorsed by those who claim we have perceptual\nseemings or experiences with complex propositional content. In this\nconnection, it is worth considering the views of various theorists who\nhold that perceptual experience can basically represent, and present\nto a subject, propositions featuring sophisticated properties well\nbeyond phenomenological ones (Siegel 2010). On this kind of view,\nthose with suitable training might have a perceptual experience that a\nchild is ill or that a fire will soon engulf a room in the way that a\nnon-expert has a perceptual experience that they are presented with\nsomething red. The epistemology of such propositional perceptual\nstates (if they exist) must be addressed elsewhere. \nConsider the following paradigmatic examples of contemporary\nphilosophical reasoning in which a philosophical theory is taken to be\nprima facie undermined by contradicting an intuition\nregarding a particular hypothetical case: \nSuch examples could easily be multiplied to include teletransportation\nand fission cases in the literature on personal identity, preemption\nand epiphenomena cases in the literature on causation and explanation,\nclairvoyance and evil demon cases in epistemology, Newcomb cases in\ndecision theory, Frankfurt cases in the literature on free will,\nTwin-Earth and Swampman cases in the literature on mental content,\nJackson’s Mary case in the metaphysics of mind, trolley cases in\napplied ethics, experience machine cases in normative ethics, and many\nmany others. \nIn each such instance, the fact that the theory or generalization in\nquestion contravenes the content of an intuition is treated as\n(defeasible) evidence against the theory or generalization. As well,\nthe fact that a theory implies results which agree with intuitions is\ncommonly taken to constitute prima facie support for the\ntheory. (See the supplementary document\n “The Logical Structure of the Method of Cases”\n for further discussion of the logical structure of such\nreasoning.) \nThis use of intuitions is, perhaps, even clearer if we consider what\nseems to be a contrast between philosophical methodology and that of\nthe natural sciences. An empirical scientist must engage in empirical\nobservation of some sort in an order to confirm or disconfirm the\ntheories with which her discipline is engaged. If judged by her\npractice, the philosopher, by contrast, appears able to proceed\nlargely or entirely from the armchair. If one takes the evidence to\nwhich natural science is primarily responsive to be that produced by\nempirical observation, it seems that philosophical (and other) inquiry\nproceeding from the armchair must have some other (putative)\nevidential basis. A natural (though contested) suggestion is that\nintuitions are treated as the primary evidence in philosophical\ninquiry. \n(Some contemporary discussion of the methodology and epistemology of\nthe appeal to particular hypothetical cases treats them as\n“thought experiments” and endeavors to draw analogies\nbetween the role of such cases in philosophical inquiry and the role\nof thought experiments in empirical science (Horowitz and Massey 1991;\nSorensen 1992). This analogy is not pursued here for reasons outlined\nin\n §1.3.) \nThe four examples above\n (§2.2)\n involve appeal to intuitions regarding particular hypothetical cases\nin philosophical theorizing. There are, however, other prominent\nexamples of appeals to intuition, such as those of the epistemological\nrationalist. For present purposes, the epistemological rationalist is\none who holds that belief in some propositions is not justified by\nsense experience, introspection, or memory, but rather by rational\nintuition (BonJour 1998; Bealer 1998). \nOne traditional argument for rationalism appeals to various\npropositions which (a) we seem clearly justified in believing, and (b)\nseem justified not by experience, but rather simply by our seeming to\nsee or apprehend that they are true. Plausible candidates include\nprinciples of classical logic, basic arithmetic, analytic\npropositions, color or shape exclusion principles, and transitivity\nclaims. The following examples are representative: \nThe hypothetical case examples which drive much philosophical\ntheorizing in epistemology, moral theory, metaphysics, and the\nphilosophy of mind are, in some sense, particular in content. The\nrationalist’s examples are typically more general. \nIn fact, there are philosophically significant propositions at all\nlevels of generality which may be the content of intuitions. Here are\nsome examples of general propositions which have been alleged to be\nintuitive: \nThe previous sections have aimed to show that much philosophical\ninquiry depends in significant ways on intuitions as evidence or\nreasons. However, such a claim is ambiguous. To say that the intuition\nthat p is treated as evidence might be to claim that the\nfact that a person has an intuition is taken to serve as some\nkind of evidence (the intuiting) or it might be to claim that\nthe propositional content of the intuition (the\nintuited) is treated as the evidence. \nTreating the intuitings as the exclusive evidence has been\nalleged to overly psychologize philosophy (Pust 2001) and to play into\nthe hands of skeptics of both the armchair and empirical variety\n(Williamson 2007; Deutsch 2010). After all, if one’s ultimate\nevidence is psychological, it can seem a difficult question why such\nstates or events ought to be treated as evidence for claims which are\nnot psychological at all—claims about the nature of knowledge,\nmorality, modality, etc. (For the suggestion that philosophers should\ninstead treat many of their efforts as aiming to explicate the\nstructure and content of our mental representations, see\nGoldman 1999, 2007.)  Furthermore, it doesn’t seem at all\nplausible that most explicit philosophical argument and analysis\nproceeds from psychological premises (i.e., premises about what some\nperson or persons find intuitive). Rather, they appeal to claims\nregarding knowledge, justification, morality, explanation, etc. \nOn the other hand, to fail to address the fact that the proposition in\nquestion is intuitive—that it is the content\nof an intuiting—is, it seems, to neglect something\nimportant about one’s apparent justification for believing the\nproposition. While most of our putative evidence in philosophy\nconsists of non-psychological propositions, what qualifies such\npropositions as our evidence must have something to do with\nour epistemic justification for believing them. Even if philosophical\nargumentation rarely includes premises about the intuitiveness of a\nproposition, our justification for accepting the premises in an\nargument is of great importance in determining the ultimate\njustificatory force of the argument. \nHence, the view that intuitions are treated as evidence in philosophy\nis best thought of as the view that, with respect to many core\nquestions of philosophy, our justification for believing an answer\nconsists (at least substantially) in our having suitable intuitions.\nIt does not follow that all explicit philosophical reasoning can be\nproperly represented as beginning with propositions stating that we\nhave intuitions of various sorts (that route is self-defeating and\nincapable of accounting for justification by reasoning). Put simply,\nthe view is that the occurrence of an intuiting is taken to\nprovide the person in whom it occurs with prima facie\njustification for believing the intuited. Alternatively, it\nholds that S’s having an intuition that p prima\nfacie justifies S in believing that p. Given a\ncapacious view of evidence, then, both the intuiting and the intuited\nare treated as evidence, the occurrence of the former being treated as\nprima facie non-inferential justification for accepting the\nlatter and the latter as a potential inferential justification for\nfurther propositions. \nThose who prefer to focus on knowledge rather than justification can\ntake the claim that intuitions are treated as evidence as the claim\nthat beliefs based on intuition (if intuitions are distinct from\nbeliefs) or intuitive beliefs are usually taken to be knowledge and so\ntaken as evidence for further claims. They may also allow that having\nan intuition that p is, when it is veridical, a way of knowing\nthat p and thereby having p as part of one’s\nevidence (Cath 2012). \nThe view that intuitions are treated as evidence in philosophy has\ncome under recent attack by a number of philosophers (Williamson 2007;\nCappelen 2012; Deutsch 2015). The critics seem clearly to wish to deny\nthat philosophical practice treats the having of an intuition as\nprima facie justification for its content, either because\nthey deny that intuitions (at least as characterized by the sui\ngeneris accounts) exist or because they are skeptical that such\nstates could serve as prima facie justification for their\ncontents. Though Williamson, as noted above, suggests he cannot\nintrospectively locate such states, Cappelen and Deutsch largely avoid\nintrospective appeals, arguing instead that attention to philosophical\npractice and writing reveals little evidence of appeals to intuitions.\nInstead, they claim that close attention to influential discussions in\nphilosophy reveals the ultimate source of justification for various\nclaims is to be found in arguments. \nThe rejoinder to such a revisionary view of the role of intuitions\ntakes various forms. An understanding of the sort of state at issue\nmay require careful introspection and theorizing of the sort appearing\nabove. Moreover, one may doubt that a given account of the nature of\nintuitions is correct without doubting that intuitions exist. A\nfurther rejoinder would be to argue that much of the written work\ndiscussed by Cappelen and Deutsch features language which is\nplausibly used to designate intuitions and, additionally, that the\nprovision of arguments supporting verdicts regarding various thought\nexperiments is not inconsistent with the author’s taking\n(implicitly or explicitly) intuitions to serve as prima facie\njustification for their contents (Bengson 2014; Devitt 2015). \nSkeptics about intuitions allege that we are not justified in\nbelieving the contents of our intuitions. Prior consideration of the\nfeatures that a suitable skeptical argument must possess will allow\ngreater concision below and will also aid in revealing common features\nof the arguments. \nFirst, such arguments are arguments for the conclusion that intuitions\n(either intuitions generally or intuitions of some specific sort) do\nnot justify us in believing their contents. Hence, any such skeptical\nargument must have a premise stating a necessary condition on the\njustification of belief. Call this premise, “the normative\npremise.” Second, such an argument must contain a premise\nstating that beliefs based on the intuitions in question do not\nsatisfy the necessary condition of justified belief advanced in the\nnormative premise. Call this premise, “the non-normative\npremise.” \nThird, a successful argument for selective skepticism\nregarding intuitions must be one which does not equally apply to many\nother sources of putatively justified belief. After all, if the\nargument at issue would also justify skepticism regarding perceptual\nbelief and/or memorial and/or introspective belief, it shows nothing\ndistinctively problematic about intuitions or beliefs based upon them.\nCall this constraint on a successful argument, “the local\nskepticism constraint.” \nFinally, (a) the justification for the normative and the non-normative\npremises must be provided by some source of evidence or justification\nother than intuitions of the sort impugned by the argument\nand (b) we must lack good reason to think that our belief in the\nnormative or factual premise fails the necessary condition on\njustified belief advanced by the normative premise. Call the\nconjunction of these requirements “the non-self-undermining\nconstraint” (Bealer 1992; Pust 2001; but see\nSilva 2013). While running afoul of this constraint does not provide\nreason to think the argument at issue unsound, it appears a\nreasonable constraint on a skeptical argument meant to produce\nreflectively justified belief in a conclusion in virtue of its\nfollowing from justified premises. Given that the proponents of the\nvarious skeptical arguments to be discussed are mere local skeptics,\nthey certainly appear to be offering arguments aimed at inducing\nphilosophically reasonable belief in a local skeptical thesis\nregarding intuition. \nAttempts to construe skeptical arguments against intuition as a\nreductio of the supposition that intuitions have evidential\nworth will not be discussed below. Note, however, that their\nproponents (a) require some justification for the relevant inferential\nprinciples required by the reductio, and (b) are likely to be\ndeprived of any justified positive epistemological position, let alone\none sufficient to justify the typical intuition skeptic’s high\nepistemic regard for empirical inquiry. \nSome skeptics regarding intuition argue that intuition is\nepistemically illegitimate because it cannot be independently\ncalibrated. In Cummins’ forceful presentation of the argument,\nthis independent calibration requirement is used to justify the\nconclusion that we should “dismiss philosophical intuition as\nepistemologically valueless” (1998: 125). \nLet us state the argument as follows: \nThe Argument from Lack of Independent Calibration \nThough it has substantial plausibility in connection with various\nderived epistemic sources such as scientific instruments, it is clear\nthat [P1] runs afoul of the local skepticism constraint. It amounts to\na demand which is in principle unsatisfiable. If, as [P1]\nimplies, intuition must be calibrated by some other source, X,\nthen, by [P1], X must itself be calibrated by yet another\nsource of evidence, Y, which must itself be calibrated and so\non. Some hold, in virtue of this fact, that it is impossible to arrive\nat justified belief and others that it is, in suitable circumstances,\npossible to do so. If the former is true, then [P1] runs afoul of the\nlocal skepticism constraint. If, instead, the latter is true, then\n[P1] is false. Additionally, it seems clear that an argument for [P1]\nwill require evidential reliance on epistemic intuitions and so\ncontravene the non-self-undermining requirement. \nWhat of [P2]? Setting aside non-reductive accounts of testimony,\nindependent calibrations look unlikely to succeed for the full range\nof philosophically relevant intuitions, at least given the more\nconstrained accounts of intuition above. The primary reason is the\nlack of overlap between the contents of intuitions and those beliefs\njustified by suitably independent sources. One doesn’t, it\nseems, use one’s senses to discern if some hypothetical case is\na case of knowledge or right action or a case in which the\nhypothetical entity is conscious or in which two temporally distinct\npersons are the same person. As well, while perception may indicate\nthe truth of some proposition and hence its possibility, it seems\nincapable of itself demonstrating the possibility of non-actual truths\nor the necessity of any proposition. \nA more plausible normative premise would hold that unreliable (rather\nthan uncalibratable) faculties cannot justify belief, yielding the\nfollowing: \nThe Argument from Unreliability—First Version \nInsofar as the normative premise is meant to articulate a necessary\ntruth, it is open to the “new evil demon” counterexample\nto the necessity of reliability (Cohen 1984) according to which\nsubjects with exactly our experiences and beliefs are justified in\nbelieving as we do even if they are the victims of a deceptive evil\ndemon. As a natural interpretation of the reliability condition would\nbe contravened here, this is taken by many to demonstrate that\nreliability (so understood) is not a necessary condition of justified\nbelief. \nHowever, even those who reject [P1] typically allow that good reason\nto think a putative source of evidence is unreliable is\nsufficient to defeat whatever prima facie justification it\nmay otherwise provide. Hence, we may reformulate the argument as\nfollows in order to provide it with a more plausible normative\npremise: \nThe Argument from Unreliability—Second Version \nAs the defense of [P1] or [P1*] requires appeal to epistemic\nintuitions, any attempt to justify by such means a skeptical\nconclusion regarding all intuitions, all epistemic intuitions or even\nall normative intuitions, would fail to observe the\nnon-self-undermining constraint. \nStill, it is worth considering the possible ways of attempting to\njustify skeptical arguments of a more limited sort by arguing\nthat intuitions of some sort (which does not include epistemic\nintuitions or at least the epistemic intuitions of the sort needed to\njustify the premises) are unreliable. Given that the relevant\nnon-normative premise must claim that intuitions of the sort at issue\nare more frequently false than true (or equally likely to be false as\nto be true) it seems to require an inductive justification based on a\nsufficiently large number of cases in which we have justification for\nbelieving \\({\\sim}p\\) while p is the content of an\nintuition. \nOne way of developing the case would involve a sufficiently large\nnumber of cases in which one has an intuition-independent\njustification for thinking \\({\\sim}p\\) while intuition testifies that\np (intrapersonal intersource inconsistency). Another\nwould involve a sufficiently large number of cases in which one has\nthe intuition that p and either oneself or some other person\nhas the intuition that \\({\\sim}p\\). In the intrapersonal case, this\nmight involve our finding a given proposition intuitive and, at some\nother time, our finding its explicit negation intuitive\n(intrapersonal intrasource inconsistency). More likely is a\nless direct inconsistency, as when we have two intuitions which,\nthough not the explicit propositional negations of each other, can be\nshown to contradict with the aid of some other justified principle.\nMany contemporary skeptics, however, wish to appeal to\ninterpersonal disagreement as justification for their\nskepticism. Here we should distinguish between cases in which some\nother person has intuition-independent justification for believing the\nnegation of the content of one of one’s own intuitions\n(interpersonal intersource inconsistency) and cases in which\nthe other person has an intuition with a content contradicting\none’s own intuition or, perhaps, fails to have any intuition\nregarding p (interpersonal intrasource\ninconsistency). \nAs noted when conceding the factual premise, [P2], of the Argument\nfrom Lack of Independent Calibration\n (§3.2),\n on the sui generis accounts of intuition\n (§1.3),\n there are few, if any, direct conflicts between the putative\ndeliverances of rational intuition and our other sources of evidence\n(Bealer 1998; BonJour 1998). Indirect conflicts would be ones\nin which the results of empirical theory contradict the content of\nrational intuitions. Such cases, if there are any, are quite rare. \nIndeed, in view of the lack of direct conflicts, there is substantial\nreason to think indirect conflicts must be quite rare as standard\nempirical theorizing seems unlikely to yield conclusions about the\ndomains about which intuition seems to inform us. These facts suggest\nthat interpersonal interfaculty inconsistency will also be an\ninsufficient basis for skepticism. \nThe main case of intrapersonal intrasource inconsistency has\nbeen mentioned previously—the case of paradoxes. To support the\npresent (limited) skeptical argument, however, it must be parlayed\ninto an argument that intuitions are so unreliable as to fail to\njustify belief at all. \nIt is not clear how this can be done. For one thing, there remains the\nfact that most of a person’s intuitions are not in conflict with\none another. For another, some conflicts between intuitions can be\nresolved by standard means or by favoring the more intuitive\npropositions. This is not to claim that such disagreements might not\nrationally require a suspension of judgment about the actual\ncontradicting intuitions (if they are suitably balanced in strength).\nHowever, such a conclusion is quite limited and extends clearly only\nto areas of demonstrable and irresolvable inconsistency. \nThe case of greatest interest to skeptics is likely to be the case of\ninterpersonal intrasource inconsistency or disagreement. We\nmust be careful to distinguish between interpersonal conflicts of\nintuitions and conflicts between beliefs or between beliefs and\nintuitions. Philosophers disagree a great deal about the correct\ntheory of free will, knowledge, justification and the like.\nThis fact has been alleged to make a certain sort of epistemic modesty\n(though not complete skepticism) about the theoretical\naccomplishments of philosophy quite reasonable (Christensen 2007).\nHowever, philosophers seem to disagree less about what the relevant\nintuitions are. Bealer claims that \nthe on-balance agreement among our elementary concrete-case intuitions\nis one of the most impressive general facts about human cognition.\n(1998: 214)  \n(See, however, “the variation project” of experimental\nphilosophers discussed in\n §4.1.)\n Functionalists, for example, don’t usually claim to lack the\nintuition that the Chinese nation (Block 1978) would lack qualia.\nRather, they often go to great lengths to explain away such\nintuitions, formulate the functionalist theory to accommodate them\n(Putnam 1967), or selectively deflate their epistemic value.\nReliabilists don’t typically claim that there is no new evil\ndemon problem (Cohen 1984). Rather, they engage in considerable\nmaneuvering to discount the intuition, to rephrase it in a way not\ndamaging to straightforward reliabilism, or, most commonly, to provide\nan alternative, recognizably reliabilist, theory which accommodates\nthe intuition. \nMuch of the recent literature on the epistemic significance of\ndisagreement is focused on cases in which two persons disagree with\nrespect to a single proposition which is inferentially\njustified, and in which the two parties are known to each\nother to have the same evidence and general cognitive\nvirtues (Christensen 2009). The lessons of such cases for the present\nquestions are likely to be limited. If intuitions are evidence which\nnon-inferentially justify belief, then even if one ought to suspend\njudgment in the aforementioned kind of case, it will not follow that\none ought to do so in the case of intuitive disagreements. Hence, we\nmust instead focus on cases of disagreement between non-inferentially\njustified beliefs or, more appropriately, on the propositional content\nof some non-doxastic basis for such belief. Feldman (2007) provides a\nperceptual case (explicitly compared to something like rational\nintuition) in which one person seems to see p and the other,\nsimilarly situated, does not seem to see p. When the two become\napprised of each other’s appearances (and know each other to\nhave equally good vision and to be honest), Feldman avers that they\nmust withhold judgment on p. Perhaps the same is true with\nrespect to philosophical intuitions. \nHowever, it can be difficult to determine if another’s failure\nto have an intuition that p is epistemically significant, as\nthey may have yet to really grasp or consider the precise proposition\nat issue. An analogous claim is true in the perceptual case as well,\nas when one sees an object which is well camouflaged and another\nclaims not to see it. Still, restricting ourselves to a situation in\nwhich one has good reason to think the other fully understands the\ncontent at issue and claims either not to have the intuition or to\nhave the contrary intuition, we must ask what the appropriate\nresponses to such cases is. Here, it does seem that the proper\nresponse is sometimes (depending on the proposition at issue)\nsuspension of belief or some suitable diminution of credence (BonJour\n1998: 138–142). Even if the correct response to disagreement\nabout p in such cases is the suspension of belief (or a\nreduction of credence), it won’t follow that beliefs in\npropositions about which no known disagreement exists are undermined.\nNor could it follow that one must always have independent reason to\nthink there is no disagreement prior to being justified in accepting\nthe content of an intuition. That would be impossible. \nA serious case for disagreement-based local skepticism regarding some\nentire class of intuitions which evades the non-self-undermining\nconstraint would require justification for thinking that quite\nsubstantial disagreement with some equally (or more) competent other\nperson has arisen. It cannot be supposed that the question of whether\none is justified in thinking that some apparent competent interlocutor\nis sincerely testifying that p is entirely independent of the\ncontent of their apparent assertion or of one’s total evidence\nrelevant to existence of other minds and their mental contents of the\nappropriate sort. Some sorts of apparent disagreement call into\nquestion the understanding, sanity, intelligence, or sincerity of\none’s interlocutor, as when some other denies some basic truth\nof arithmetic. Consider a version of Feldman’s perceptual case\nin which there are successive occasions on which one seems to see\np and one’s interlocutor apparently denies that they see\nany such thing. Were they to become frequent enough, there might be\nreason to doubt that the other is honest and competent, speaking\none’s language, or, indeed, whether there is another person to\nwhom one is speaking. Similar obstacles arise for the possibility of\nvery widespread disagreement of intuitions, especially on views\naccording to which the reliability of intuitions is constitutive of\npossessing certain concepts (Bealer 1998; Huemer 2005; Ludwig\n2007). \nMany of the most interesting arguments for skepticism regarding\nphilosophical intuitions do not appeal to direct evidence of\nunreliability, but are instead instances of what shall here be called\n“arguments from explanation.” Such arguments maintain\neither that (a) the fact that our best explanations of the occurrence\nof intuitions (i.e., intuitings) do not appeal to the truth\nof their contents is reason to think we are not justified in accepting\nsuch contents, or that (b) the fact that we cannot provide any\nexplanation of how our intuitions are or could be reliable\nregarding the domains about which they might initially appear to\ninform us, is reason to think we are not justified in believing their\ncontents. Let us call former sort of argument “the argument from\nlack of explanatory necessity” and the second sort, “the\nargument from inexplicability of reliability.” Recent arguments\nof this sort have been discussed by those concerned with so-called\n“debunking arguments” regarding our moral beliefs and\nintuitions (Street 2006; Clarke-Doane 2015). \nGilbert Harman (1977) suggests that moral theories are unjustified\nbecause they cannot be tested and confirmed in the way that scientific\ntheories can. While he admits that we may “test” general\nmoral principles against our intuitions regarding particular actual\nand hypothetical situations, he argues that we are not thereby testing\nour moral theories or principles against the world. Instead, we are\nmerely testing them against our “moral sensibility” or\nagainst our tacitly held moral views. \nHarman claims that there is an important difference between the use of\nobservations in empirical science and the use of intuitions in moral\ninquiry, a difference which renders moral intuitions unable to provide\nevidence for moral theory. The alleged difference is that \nyou need to make assumptions about certain physical facts to explain\nthe occurrence of the observations that support a scientific theory,\nbut you do not seem to need to make assumptions about any moral facts\nto explain the occurrence \nof the moral intuitions. When, for example, one has the intuition, in\nthe Transplant case, that it would be wrong for a doctor to kill an\nunconsenting healthy patient to save the lives of five other patients,\n \nan assumption about moral facts would seem to be totally irrelevant to\nthe explanation of your making the judgment you make \nand hence the intuition “does not seem … to be …\nevidence for or against any moral theory” (1977: 6–7). The\nargument seems to be: \nThe Argument from Lack of Explanatory Necessity \nThe normative premise, [P1], is perfectly general and hence may be\nequally deployed to undermine justified belief of any proposition\nfailing its standard. Indeed, there seems equally good reason to think\nthat the propositions which are the contents of most philosophical\nintuitions will not be part (outside of attitude contexts) of the best\nexplanation of our having those intuitions. (See Goldman\n1989, 1992 for similar skeptical arguments regarding the use of\nintuitions in contemporary metaphysics.) \nOne possible response to this sort of argument is to concede [P1] and\nto argue, for the class of propositions at issue, that they do satisfy\nthe necessary condition of justification. This maneuver is represented\nby Sturgeon’s (1984) rejoinder to Harman. Sturgeon suggests that\nit is often reasonable to think that we wouldn’t think\nsome action or person possessed a relevant moral property unless they\nin fact possessed the property. More precisely, he holds that in order\nfor a given act or agent to have a different moral status it or they\nwould have to differ in some non-moral way and then we often would not\ntake it or them to have the same moral status. However, whatever the\nplausibility of this account with respect to actual token actions or\npersons, it is less clear how the counterfactual criterion would apply\nto the moral status of actions featured in the merely hypothetical\ncases found in typical methodology. Moreover, even if one takes\nSturgeon’s maneuver to be successful against Harman’s\nattack on moral intuitions, it seems quite unclear how it is to be\nextended to the many appeals to intuition catalogued above\n (§2). \nIt has also been argued that [P1] is unjustified (Pust 2001). There\nappear to be only two ways that [P1] could be justified. It might be\njustified by being intuitive or by being supported by our intuitions\nregarding particular cases of justified belief. [P1] is not, however,\nintuitive. Furthermore, an inductive argument for [P1] based on our\nintuitions about particular cases of justified belief will not support\n[P1] since many of what seem, intuitively, to be our most justified\nbeliefs run afoul of [P1]. (See, for example, [I1]–[I4] from\n §1\n and the examples in\n §2.2\n and\n §2.3.)\n Many of our particular epistemic beliefs, moral beliefs, and modal\nbeliefs seem, intuitively, no less justified than our empirical\nbeliefs. Indeed, some of them seem more justified. Since it seems\nimplausible that all of these propositions are required in the best\nexplanation of the occurrence of our intuitions, it seems that [P1],\nwhich requires such a role, is undermined by such cases. \nEven if there were sufficient intuitive support for [P1], defending\nthis argument by such means would contravene both strands of the\nnon-self-undermining constraint (Pust 2001). According to [P1],\nS’s non-introspective belief that p is justified\nonly if the proposition believed plays a role in the best explanation\nof S’s mental states. No demonstration of explanatory\nrelevance is involved in the two methods of justifying [P1] just\ndiscussed. Rather, each approach would take the mere fact that the\nprinciple is the content of an intuition or best explains the\ncontent of a set of particular intuitions (i.e., intuiteds)\nas sufficient for justified belief in that principle. This is to treat\nintuiteds as supporting evidence for a principle allowing\nonly intuitings to count as evidence. Moreover, since [P1]\nstates a necessary condition for the justified acceptance of\nany proposition not about the occurrence of an observation or\nintuition, acceptance of [P1] itself is justified only if it satisfies\nthe very requirement it articulates. Unfortunately, because [P1] is a\nnormative proposition about when a belief is justified, it is\ndifficult to see how its truth could play any role in the explanation\nof the occurrence of any of our experiences or intuitions.\nHowever, if [P1] does not satisfy [P1], then, if [P1] is true, we\ncannot be justified in believing [P1]. \nThe second argument from explanation has its origins in\nBenacerraf’s (1973) epistemological objection to Platonism in\nmathematics. Benacerraf argued that the best semantic accounts of\nmathematics (e.g., Platonist ones) were in tension with our best\ntheories of knowledge (e.g., causal ones) and that attempts to bring\nthe truth conditions of mathematical statements into closer epistemic\nproximity to human subjects were semantically inadequate. Though he\nclaimed to favor “a causal account of knowledge” and such\nan account is now generally thought mistaken, it should be noted that\nBenacerraf motivated the causal connection constraint by noting that\none may justify the claim that S does not know p by\narguing that S  \ncould not have come into possession of the relevant evidence or\nreasons: that [S’s] four-dimensional space-time worm does\nnot make the necessary (causal) contact with the grounds of the truth\nof the proposition \nfor S to have adequate evidence (1973: 671). \nField (1989) provides a Benacerraf-style epistemic challenge to belief\nin mathematics (construed in a Platonist fashion), one which he\nalleges  \ndoes not depend on any theory of knowledge in the sense in which the\ncausal theory is a theory of knowledge; that is it does not depend on\nany assumption about necessary and sufficient conditions for\nknowledge. (pp. 232–233) \nOn his account, the fundamental problem has to do with the\nimpossibility of explaining “the reliability of our\nbeliefs” in the domain in question. More precisely, he\nalleges that “if it appears impossible to explain” how our\nbeliefs about some entities or our grounds for the beliefs “can\nso well reflect the facts about them,” then  \nthat tends to undermine the belief in …. (these) entities,\ndespite whatever initial reasons we might have for believing in\nthem. (p. 26, emphasis added) \nThough Field’s argument has various of our beliefs as it target,\nit seems to support the following argument against intuition: \nThe Argument from Inexplicability of Reliability \nThe non-normative premise, [P2], seems to extend to all necessary\ntruths if the explanation of reliability mentioned in [P1] requires\nany sort of counterfactual sustaining relation between the truth\nmakers of the propositions in question and our psychological states.\nThe failure of explanation here is intimately linked to the intuitive\ndeviance of counterfactuals featuring in their antecedents the\nnegations of necessary propositions. The standard semantics treats\nthem as uniformly and vacuously true and so there is little\ninformative sense to be made of the notion that were some proposition\nwe take to be (necessarily) true to be false we would believe (or\nintuit) otherwise than we do. As it is implausible that all\nour beliefs in non-contingent matters are unjustified, this cuts\nagainst [P1] if it is taken to require a counterfactual supporting\nkind of explanation. \nIf, on the other hand, [P1] requires only that we have reason to think\nour reliability not utterly mysterious, then, while [P1] is more\nplausible, the relevant instance of [P2] may be false. It has been\nsuggested that the provision of an explanation of our having the\nintuitions we do would, in virtue of the impossibility of such\npropositions as we intuit having different truth values, suffice as\nan explanation of their reliability. There is no\nparticular reason to think that our intuitions lack explanation while\nour other mental states have an explanation. That explanation, when\nconjoined with our prima facie justification for believing\nthe contents of our intuitions (and our being prima facie\njustified isn’t challenged on this construal of the argument)\nseems to suffice as an explanation of our reliability. Put\nanother way, if our reliability is a necessary accompaniment of having\na certain content, then we have no reason to think our reliability is\ninexplicable. The explanation, in this sense, of our\nreliability is a straightforward consequence of the necessarily true\ncontents of our intuitions and the psychological explanation for our\nhaving those particular intuitions (Pust 2004; Grundmann 2007: 84; but\nsee Schechter 2010). \nIt may also be argued (Pust 2004) that it isn’t, as seems\nassumed by Field’s objection, clearly possible for a creature to\nhave intuitions significantly different from our own. Given the more\nconstrained accounts of intuition discussed above, it is not clear\nthat a creature might have intuitions with contents generally\ncontradicting our own. That such a creature is metaphysically possible\nis itself a modal claim apparently requiring justification by\nintuition and such intuitions seem to be lacking. This response to the\nexplanationist can be elaborated in the context of a theory of concept\npossession according to which a necessary condition of the genuine\npossession of a given concept (of the sort of primary interest in\nphilosophical investigation) is the reliability of one’s\nintuitions regarding hypothetical cases. Such an account is justified\nby intuitions and so cannot be an independent justification of them.\nIt may, however, still reasonably be thought to be an explanation\n(though not a causal one) of their (necessary) reliability. \nFinally, just as was true with respect to the Argument from Lack of\nExplanatory Necessity, there remains the concern that any attempt to\njustify believing [P1] and [P2] will run afoul of the\nnon-self-undermining constraint by relying on intuitions about\njustification and explanation in order to argue that\nintuitions do not justify belief. \nThere are, broadly speaking, two ways of defending the use of\nintuitions as evidence. The first possible defense would be an\nempirical defense of intuitions by arguing against the second premise\nof the Argument from Lack of Independent Calibration\n (§3.2).\n The defense would proceed by providing an inductive argument, based\non non-intuitive evidence, that the contents of intuitions (either\ngenerally or of some specific sort) are reliable. \nThe only other apparent possible defense of the thesis that intuitions\nprima facie justify belief in their content appeals, as does\nthe traditional rationalist, to the fact that there are many\nparticular propositions which one seems justified in believing simply\nin virtue of their being the content of a rational intuition (Bealer\n1998; BonJour 1998). The strength of the conclusion is, of course,\nmore supported to the extent that such examples are multiplied. And,\nas noted above, there appear to be many such examples. \nThis defense may be generalized by claiming that intuition is\nself-supporting insofar as the general claim that intuitions\nprovide prima facie justification for belief in their\ncontents is itself intuitive. The possibility of such a defense is the\nresult of the same fact that revealed that all of the extant local\nskeptical arguments run afoul of the non-self-undermining\nconstraint—the fact that intuitions seem to be the only source\nof justification for claims about justification, reason, evidence, and\nother epistemic properties. \nThe obvious concern about this sort of defense (in both its particular\nand general form) is the fact that it necessarily involves epistemic\ncircularity of some kind. That is, it defends the appeal to intuitions\nas reasons for belief by appeal to intuitions. It seems clear that\nepistemically circular defenses are sometimes illegitimate, as when\nquestions about the epistemic probity of appeals to a crystal ball are\nanswered by consulting the ball. However, as indicated above\n (§3.2),\n it also appears that some sort of epistemic circularity is\ninevitable in the attempt to defend our most basic modes of evidence\nand justification. Exactly when such circularity is epistemically\ndisabling and when, if ever, it is acceptable is a difficult question\nwhich cannot be here treated in detail (Alston 1986, 1993; Bergmann\n2006; Cohen 2002; Vogel 2008). However, a few remarks are in\norder. \nFirst, if epistemic circularity is always unacceptable, then\nit is impossible to defend the appeal to intuition. However, the same\nresult will follow (ultimately) for any putative source of evidence.\nSo, while it will be the case that the use of intuitions as evidence\ncannot be defended, it will also follow that the reliance on\nperception, memory and introspection can also not be defended.\nUniversal skepticism would appear to follow. Alternatively, if\nepistemic circularity is sometimes acceptable, then no reason has been\nprovided why it is not acceptable in the case of rational\nintuition. \nSecond, if we focus on the question of whether we are prima\nfacie justified in accepting the contents of our intuitions,\nthere may be a feature which distinguishes intuition from all other\nputative sources of evidence. Only intuition is clearly capable of\nepistemic self-support because it is the only source which produces\nnon-doxastic states with epistemically normative content.\nWhether or not apparent perception that p, introspection that\np, or apparent memory that p justify us in believing\ntheir content is, it seems, a question they cannot answer as their\ncontent is never epistemic. Hence, intuition appears distinguishable\nfrom our other putative sources of evidence in being both\nrequired for a coherent epistemology and capable of epistemic\nself-support. So, if any source of evidence can be defended against\nglobal skeptical attack, it seems that intuitions can. \nRecently, a number of philosophers have argued that the epistemic\ncredentials of intuitions can be defended by appealing to similarities\nbetween perceptual justification and intuitive justification or to a\ngeneral doctrine regarding non-inferential justification. According to\nperceptual dogmatism, a person having a perceptual experience\nor a perceptual seeming with propositional content p is thereby\nprima facie justified in believing p (Pryor 2000).\nAccording to intuitive dogmatism, a person having an\nintuition or intellectual seeming with propositional content p\nis thereby prima facie justified in believing p.\nAccording to general dogmatism, when it seems to a person\nthat p, that person is thereby prima facie justified\nin believing p. It follows from general dogmatism that\nintuitions, as characterized by the various versions of the sui\ngeneris state view above\n (§1.3),\n are a source of justification (Huemer 2005, 2007). Moreover, it seems\nextremely plausible that if perceptual dogmatism is true, then so is\nintuitive dogmatism (Chudnoff 2011b; Koksvik 2011; Bengson 2015). \nWhatever the merits of general or perceptual dogmatism, it is\nimportant to recognize that appealing to them in defending intuitive\ndogmatism involves exactly the same sort of epistemic\ncircularity as that involved in the more straightforward defense\npreviously noted. This is because all versions of dogmatism are\nthemselves justified entirely on intuitive grounds—by the fact\nthat they properly accommodate our various intuitions about the\nconditions under which a person has non-inferential propositional\njustification. Hence, appeals to dogmatism of any sort are ultimately\njustified only if intuitions do provide prima facie\njustification and so cannot serve as an independent defense of the\nappeal to intuitions. Epistemic circularity in the epistemology of\nintuition appears unavoidable. \nIn the last ten to fifteen years, there has been an explosion of\ninterest in research involving the scientific or empirical\ninvestigation of intuitions of philosophical interest. Such projects\nare now frequently grouped under the rubric of “experimental\nphilosophy.” (For general characterizations of experimental\nphilosophy see Knobe and Nichols 2008, Appiah 2008, and Nadelhoffer\nand Nahmias 2007.) At least four broadly-individuated projects in\nexperimental philosophy can be distinguished. \nThe first project, “the psychology project,” aims\nto discover how people ordinarily think. Knobe and Nichols claim that\nthe results of such inquiries “have great philosophical\nsignificance in their own right … for traditional philosophical\nquestions” (2008: 12). This claim is motivated in part by the\nidea that questions which occupied the attention of historically\nsignificant philosophers ought to count as philosophically significant\nquestions. As many philosophers of antiquity and the early modern\nperiod made various claims about human psychology, such questions, it\nis claimed, count as philosophical questions which may be better\npursued by modern psychological inquiry. \nThe second project, “the verification project,”\naims to determine if the various propositions which philosophers\nallege to be intuitive, pre-theoretical, or “part of common\nsense” are, in fact, intuitive to ordinary non-philosophers.\nThis project is motivated both by the general conviction that\nempirical claims, such as those regarding the extent to which some\nbelief or intuition is shared by others, require adequate empirical\nsupport, and by the suspicion that what philosophers find intuitive or\nregard as commonsensical may be the result of their specialized\ntraining, theoretical allegiance, or general cognitive biases\n(Nadelhoffer and Nahmias 2007: 125; Knobe and Nichols 2008: 9). An\nexample of this approach can be found in Nahmias and colleagues’\ninvestigations of free will (2006, 2007). \nThe third project, “the sources project,” aims to\ndiscover the psychological mechanisms or processes that produce\npeople’s intuitions. According to Knobe and Nichols, it is\nmotivated by the “hope … that we can use the information\nto help determine whether the psychological sources … undercut\nthe warrant for the beliefs” based upon the source (2008: 9).\nSimilarly, Allman and Woodward suggest that \nbetter understanding of the sources and character of moral intuition\nwill help to clarify whether and when it has a legitimate role in\nmoral argument. (2008: 167)  \nExamples of this approach include: Greene’s (Greene et al. 2001;\nGreene 2003: 848) fMRI investigations of moral judgment (criticized in\nBerker 2009), Horowitz’s (1998) attempt (see also Sunstein 2005)\nto explain certain intuitions taken to support the doctrine of doing\nand allowing using Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory\n(criticized in Kamm 1998 and van Roojen 1999), and aspects of Nichols\nand Knobe’s (2007) investigations of the role of affect on\njudgments regarding the compatibility of determinism and moral\nresponsibility. \nThe fourth project, “the variation project,”\nseeks to determine the extent of variation in intuitions between\ndifferent groups, persons or persons-at-times or persons-in-contexts.\nMany working on this project hold that the empirically discovered\nvariation in intuitions gives us reason to believe that intuitions are\nunreliable (Alexander et al. 2010). Examples of this approach (which\ntraces its main intellectual lineage back to Stich 1988) include\nWeinberg et al. (2001) on cross-cultural variation in intuitions about\nknowledge (criticized in Sosa 2007), Swain et al. (2008) on order\neffects in intuitions about knowledge (criticized in Sosa 2007),\nBuckwalter and Stich (2013) on gender variation in intuitions of many\nsorts, and Machery et al. (2004) and Mallon et al. (2009) on\ncross-cultural variation in intuitions about reference (criticized in\nLudwig 2007; Devitt 2011; Deutsch 2009; Sytsma and Livengood\n2011). \nFor experimental philosophers seeking to investigate the sources,\ncharacter, and distribution of intuitions of philosophical interest,\nthe primary method has consisted of asking subjects questions about\nhypothetical scenarios, or less frequently, about principles or\ngeneralizations. The evidence has been responses (whether binary\n[yes/no] responses or graded [Likert scale] responses) to such survey\nquestions. Those pursuing the sources project and the variation\nproject also aim to determine which factors co-vary with\nanswers—cultural or ethnic group, socio-economic status, region\nof brain or cognitive processes implicated in answering the question,\npsychopathology, order of questions, framing of questions, etc. \nOf course, traditional first-person armchair methods seek to determine\nwhich features of the content of the scenario under consideration vary\nwith one’s intuitions. Indeed, this is exactly how one endeavors\nto test or to make more precise some general thesis in many areas of\nphilosophy. Proponents of the sources project and the variation\nproject however, seek to determine which features of those considering\nthe scenario or of framing or presenting the same question vary with\nthe relevant intuitions. \nThere have been a variety of worries raised about the adequacy of\nsurvey methods as means of gaining access to intuitions of\nthe relevant sort. The strength of these worries vary according to the\nconception of intuition. If, as claimed by various sui\ngeneris state accounts\n (§1.3),\n intuitions are not beliefs or mere dispositions to believe, then the\ninferential route from evidence consisting of survey responses to\nconclusions about intuitions is considerably lengthened. \nFirst, differences in responses may be produced by different ways of\n“filling in” a schematic hypothetical case (Sosa 2007;\nHorvath 2015). Second, there may be multiple concepts answering to a\nsingle word (Sosa 2007). (For some recognition of this fact by\nexperimental philosophers, see the use of the\n“coin-flipping” case by Weinberg et al. (2001) and Swain\net al. (2008) to exclude subjects who use “S knows that\np” to mean merely that S has high confidence that\np.) These two suggestions do not raise the possibility that\nthat the subjects in such surveys are not responding on the basis of\nintuitions. Rather, they raise the possibility that the intuitions are\nnot intuitions regarding the same property or about the same case.\n(See Alexander and Weinberg 2007 for the suggestion that both of these\nconcerns apply equally to non-solipsistic proponents of the\ntraditional armchair methodology.) \nA third, more general, worry is that such surveys run a risk of\neliciting from subjects responses determined by something other than\ntheir intuitions regarding the answer to the survey\nquestion—e.g., by implicatures determined by what a sentence is\ntypically used to communicate (Adams and Steadman 2004; Deutsch 2009;\nBach 2002) and by more general pragmatic factors governing the\ndetermination of speaker meaning and task interpretation. These\nworries may be especially pressing in the odd and ambiguous context of\na set of hypothetical and often bizarre cases presented by a\nphilosopher to a philosophically naïve subject unaware of the\nnature of the discipline (Scholl 2007: 580; Cullen 2010; Ludwig 2007).\nBengson (2013) argues that it is plausible that many survey responses\nare often not indicative of subjects’ intuitions but are instead\nthe product of guesses, hunches, or inferences. \nSome proponents of survey methods claim that such worries have very\nlow prior probability and should not be taken seriously without\nexperimental confirmation. Those who raise them, however, claim to\nhave significant independent evidence of their general relevance\n(Cullen 2010; Scholl 2007) or their importance in producing the\nparticular results at issue (Bengson 2013). Some of these problems\nseem difficult to control for without engaging subjects in something\nlike philosophical dialogue and dialectic (see Kauppinen\n2007)—i.e., by doing philosophy with them—which is thought\nby many experimental philosophers to be a form of biasing or data\ncontamination. \nA final worry, of relatively recent vintage, concerns the extent to\nwhich the results in question are reproducible or robust. A number of\nrecent studies have provided reason to think that many published\npsychological results are not reproducible, with studies in social\npsychology being especially likely to fail attempts at reproduction.\nExactly what to make of this fact and how to respond to it is a matter\nof much current debate, but it should be noted that experimental\nphilosophers have begun to pay attention to the problem and to seek\nreplication of their results. The issue is quite complicated and the\nresearch moving quickly, but it appears that quite a few of the claims\nof cultural or gender differences have not proved robust\n(Seyedsayamdost 2014, 2015; Adleberg et al. 2014). These claims of\nvariation, as noted below, have been the primary empirical basis of\nskepticism regarding the evidential value of intuition. \nNothing precludes experimental philosophers from circumventing some of\nthe concerns just noted by using experimental paradigms other than the\nadministering of surveys. They may use reaction-time studies from\ncognitive psychology (Arico et al. 2011), empirical evidence from\nneuroscience (Allman and Woodward 2008; Greene et. al. 2001),\nevolutionary biology, or other sources. While such sources of evidence\nare not subject to the difficulties of surveys, they also appear\nunlikely to produce direct evidence of use to the verification project\nor the variability project because these projects require responses to\nthe abstract and detailed linguistic descriptions of cases one\ntypically presents in philosophical analysis. Indeed, Scholl (2007)\nsuggests that the most methodologically satisfactory experimental\nphilosophy will be primarily a version of the sources project\nimplicating rather low-level processes immune, in virtue of their\nmodularity, from the interpretive and pragmatic difficulties outlined\nabove. \nThe sources project is, as noted above, often presented as a possible\nmeans of justifying skepticism regarding some class of philosophical\nintuitions. An analogy suggested by Knobe and Nichols (2008) is to\ndebunking explanations of religious beliefs. Theorists engaged in such\nprojects argue that religious belief (or religious experience on which\nsuch belief is based) is produced by some questionable process such as\nwish fulfillment, desire for a father figure, cultural indoctrination,\netc. It is then argued (or assumed) that this fact about the source of\nthe belief (or its direct internal ground) undermines the epistemic\ncredentials of such beliefs. \nThis may suggest that some skeptical proponents of the sources project\naim to motivate an instance of the Argument from Unreliability\n (§3.3).\n As an example, consider Greene’s fMRI-based arguments (Greene\net al. 2001; Greene 2003, 2007) against certain\n“characteristically deontological” intuitions in ethics.\nThe primary experimental data on which his argument is based is the\nfact that portions of the brain independently implicated in emotional\nreaction are more active when subjects consider cases giving rise to\ncharacteristically deontological intuitions than when they consider\ncases giving rise to characteristically consequentialist intuitions.\nHowever, critics will allege\n (§3.3)\n that attempts to show that a process is unreliable (independent of\ndisagreement) require independent access to the target domain and such\nintuition-independent access seems lacking for most of the target\ndomains of philosophical inquiry. In this vein, Berker (2009) argues\nthat the best argument in Greene’s work rests largely on other\nintuitions about the general normative insignificance of the\nfactors within hypothetical cases to which Greene believes\ndeontological intuitions are responsive. (See Unger 1996 for an\nentirely a priori criticism of many “characteristically\ndeontological” intuitions for their apparent responsiveness to\nintuitively normatively insignificant factors.) \nThe aforementioned analogy to debunking explanations of religious\nbelief might also be taken to suggest a version of the Argument from\nLack of Explanatory Necessity\n (§3.4.1).\n According to that argument, the provision of an explanation of the\noccurrence of the intuitions in question (the intuitings)\nwhich does not appeal to the truth of their contents (the\nintuiteds) undermines belief in their contents. The role of\nexperimental work might be thought to be to support the factual\npremise of that argument (see Greene 2003: 849 for such a suggestion).\nAs we have seen\n (§3.4.2),\n critics will claim that the argument relies on a questionable\nnormative premise and violates the non-self-undermining constraint.\nThey may also suggest that the plausibility of the non-normative\npremise of the argument derives from very general armchair (perhaps\neven entirely a priori) reflections on the contents of the\nintuitions, their truth-makers, and the nature of explanation. If so,\nthen the experimental investigations are idle. \nSome proponents of the variation project present us empirical evidence\nof disagreement between intuitions in order to motivate a version of\nthe Argument from Intrasource Inconsistency\n (§3.3.2).\n Some critics of skepticism motivated by the variation project claim,\ncontrary to what was suggested earlier\n (§2.4),\n that intuitions are not treated as evidence or reasons in\nphilosophical inquiry (Deutsch 2015; Williamson 2007; Cappelen 2012).\nWhether such a maneuver really evades whatever skeptical implications\nfollow from disagreement depends on whether disagreements of belief\nare epistemologically less troubling than variations in non-doxastic\njustifiers. \nThough critical of the variation project, Sosa’s suggests that\n \nthere will definitely be a prima facie problem for the appeal\nto intuitions in philosophy if surveys show that there is extensive\nenough disagreement on the subject matter supposedly open to intuitive\naccess. (Sosa 2007) \nRelevant to determining whether the antecedent of Sosa’s\nconditional is satisfied are the methodological concerns about survey\nmethods noted above and their ability to support claims of\nintuition disagreement. Relevant to determining the\npossibility of the antecedent of Sosa’s conditional being\nsatisfied are the distinctively a priori concerns raised\nabove\n (§3.4.2)\n about the possible extent of disagreement, about how the existence of\nwidespread disagreement could be justifiably believed to exist\n (§3.3.2),\n and, importantly, about the non-self-undermining constraint. \nIn light of the foregoing, it seems that further research on the\nfollowing issues would be especially beneficial. \nThe first is determining the precise conditions under which epistemic\ncircularity is problematic. Though some epistemic circularity appears\nunavoidable, this would aid in determining the relative initial\nepistemological standing of intuition and perception. \nThe second is determining the exact actual and possible extent of\nintuitive disagreement and the proper response to such disagreement.\nThis would enable the proper evaluation of what appears to be the most\nserious sort of skeptical argument.","contact.mail":"jpust@udel.edu","contact.domain":"udel.edu"}]
