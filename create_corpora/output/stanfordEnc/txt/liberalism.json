On any close examination, it seems\nto fracture into a range of related but sometimes competing\nvisions. In this entry we focus on debates within the liberal\ntradition. (1) We contrast three interpretations of liberalism’s\ncore commitment to liberty. (2) We contrast ‘old’ and\n‘new’ liberalism. (3) We ask whether liberalism is a\n‘comprehensive’ or a ‘political’ doctrine. (4)\nWe close with questions about the ‘ reach’ of liberalism\n— does it apply to all humankind? Must all political communities\nbe liberal? Could a liberal coherently answer this question by saying\nNo?  Could a liberal coherently answer this question by saying\nYes?\n\n\n“By definition,” Maurice Cranston says,\n“a liberal is a man who believes in liberty” (1967:\n459). In two ways, liberals accord liberty primacy as a\npolitical value.  \n(i) Liberals have typically maintained that humans\nare naturally in “a State of perfect Freedom to order\ntheir Actions…as they think fit…without asking leave, or\ndepending on the Will of any other Man” (Locke, 1960 [1689]:\n287). Mill too argued that “the burden of proof is supposed to\nbe with those who are against liberty; who contend for any restriction\nor prohibition…. The a priori assumption is in favour\nof freedom…” (1963, vol. 21: 262). Recent liberal\nthinkers such as as Joel Feinberg (1984: 9), Stanley Benn (1988: 87)\nand John Rawls (2001: 44, 112) agree. This might be called the\nFundamental Liberal Principle (Gaus, 1996: 162–166): freedom\nis normatively basic, and so the onus of justification is on those who\nwould use coercion to limit freedom. It follows from this that\npolitical authority and law must be justified, as they limit the\nliberty of citizens. Consequently, a central question of liberal\npolitical theory is whether political authority can be justified, and\nif so, how. For this reason, social contract theory, as developed by\nThomas Hobbes (1948 [1651]), John Locke (1960 [1689]), Jean-Jacques\nRousseau (1973 [1762]) and Immanuel Kant (1965 [1797]), is usually\nviewed as liberal even though the actual political prescriptions of,\nsay, Hobbes and Rousseau, have distinctly illiberal features. Insofar\nas they take as their starting point a state of nature in which humans\nare free and equal, and so argue that any limitation of this freedom\nand equality must be justified (i.e., by the social contract), the\nsocial contract tradition expresses the Fundamental Liberal\nPrinciple. The Fundamental Liberal Principle holds that restrictions\non liberty must be justified. Because he accepts this, we can\nunderstand Hobbes as part of the liberal tradition.\n\n \n(ii) That is to say, although no one classifies Hobbes as a liberal,\nthere is reason to regard Hobbes as an instigator of liberal\nphilosophy (see also Waldron 2001), for it was Hobbes who asked on\nwhat grounds citizens owe allegiance to the sovereign. Implicit in\nHobbes’s question is a rejection of the presumption that\ncitizens are the king’s property; on the contrary, kings are\naccountable to sovereign citizens. In the culture at large, this view\nof the relation between citizen and king had been taking shape for\ncenturies. The Magna Carta was a series of agreements, beginning in\n1215, arising out of disputes between the barons and King John. The\nMagna Carta eventually settled that the king is bound by the rule of\nlaw. In 1215, the Magna Carta was part of the beginning rather than\nthe end of the argument, but by the mid-1300s, concepts of individual\nrights to trial by jury, due process, and equality before the law were\nmore firmly established. The Magna Carta was coming to be seen as\nvesting sovereignty not only in nobles but in “the People”\nas such. By the mid-1400s, John Fortescue, England’s Chief Justice\nfrom 1442 to 1461, would write The Difference Between an Absolute\nand Limited Monarchy, a plea for limited monarchy that arguably\nrepresents the beginning of English political thought (Schmidtz and\nBrennan, 2010: chap. 2).  \nHobbes generally is treated as one of the first and greatest social\ncontract thinkers. Typically, Hobbes also is seen as an advocate of\nunlimited monarchy. On Hobbes’s theory, Leviathan’s authority is\nalmost absolute along a particular dimension: namely, Leviathan is\nauthorized to do whatever it takes to keep the peace.  This special\nend justifies almost any means, including drastic limitations on\nliberty. Yet, note the limitations implicit in the end\nitself. Leviathan’s job is to keep the peace: not to do everything\nworth doing, but simply to secure the peace. Hobbes, the famed\nabsolutist, in fact developed a model of government sharply limited in\nthis most important way. \nParadigmatic liberals such as Locke not only advocate the Fundamental\nLiberal Principle, but also maintain that justified limitations on\nliberty are fairly modest. Only a limited government can be justified;\nindeed, the basic task of government is to protect the equal liberty\nof citizens. Thus John Rawls’s paradigmatically liberal first\nprinciple of justice: “Each person is to have an equal right to\nthe most extensive system of equal basic liberty compatible with a\nsimilar system for all” (Rawls, 1999b: 220). \nLiberals disagree, however, about the concept of liberty, and as a\nresult the liberal ideal of protecting individual liberty can lead to\ndifferent conceptions of the task of government. Isaiah Berlin\nfamously advocated a negative conception of liberty: \n\nFor Berlin and those who follow him, then, the heart of liberty is the\nabsence of coercion by others; consequently, the liberal state’s\ncommitment to protecting liberty is, essentially, the job of ensuring\nthat citizens do not coerce each other without compelling\njustification. So understood, negative liberty is an\nopportunity-concept. Being free is a matter of what options\nare left open to us, regardless of whether we exercise such options\n(Taylor, 1979). \n\nMany liberals have been attracted to more ‘positive’\nconceptions of liberty. Although Rousseau (1973 [1762]) seemed to\nadvocate a positive conception of liberty, according to which one was\nfree when one acted according to one’s true will (the general will),\nthe positive conception was best developed by the British\nneo-Hegelians of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,\nsuch as Thomas Hill Green and Bernard Bosanquet (2001 [1923]). Green\nacknowledged that “…it must be of course admitted that\nevery usage of the term [i.e., ‘freedom’] to express\nanything but a social and political relation of one man to other\ninvolves a metaphor…It always implies…some exemption\nfrom compulsion by another…”(1986 [1895]:\n229). Nevertheless, Green went on to claim that a person can be unfree\nif he is subject to an impulse or craving that cannot be\ncontrolled. Such a person, Green argued, is “…in the\ncondition of a bondsman who is carrying out the will of another, not\nhis own” (1986 [1895]: 228). Just as a slave is not doing what\nhe really wants to do, one who is, say, an alcoholic, is\nbeing led by a craving to look for satisfaction where it cannot,\nultimately, be found. \n\nFor Green, a person is free only if she is self-directed or\nautonomous. Running throughout liberal political theory is an ideal of\na free person as one whose actions are in some sense\nher own. In this sense, positive liberty is\nan exercise-concept. One is free merely to the degree that\none has effectively determined oneself and the shape of one’s\nlife (Taylor, 1979).  Such a person is not subject to compulsions,\ncritically reflects on her ideals and so does not unreflectively\nfollow custom, and does not ignore her long-term interests for\nshort-term pleasures. This ideal of freedom as autonomy has its roots\nnot only in Rousseau’s and Kant’s political theory, but\nalso in John Stuart Mill’s On Liberty.  And today it is\na dominant strain in liberalism, as witnessed by the work of S.I.\nBenn (1988), Gerald Dworkin (1988), and Joseph Raz (1986); see also\nthe essays in Christman and Anderson (2005). \nGreen’s autonomy-based conception of positive freedom is often run\ntogether with a notion of ‘positive’ freedom: freedom as\neffective power to act or to pursue one’s ends. In the words of the\nBritish socialist R. H. Tawney, freedom thus understood is ‘the\nability to act’ (1931: 221; see also Gaus, 2000; ch. 5.) On this\npositive conception, a person not prohibited from being a member of a\nCountry Club but too poor to afford membership is not free to be a\nmember: she lacks an effective power to act. Positive freedom\nqua effective power to act closely ties freedom to material\nresources. (Education, for example, should be easily available so that\nall can develop their capacities.) It was this conception of positive\nliberty that Hayek had in mind when he insisted that although\n“freedom and wealth are both good things…they still\nremain different” (1960: 17–18). \n\nAn older notion of liberty that has recently resurfaced is\nthe republican, or neo-Roman, conception of liberty, which has roots\nin the writings of Cicero and Niccolo Machiavelli (1950\n[1513]). According to Philip Pettit, On this view, the opposite of freedom is domination. To be unfree\nis to be “subject to the potentially capricious will or the\npotentially idiosyncratic judgement of another” (Pettit, 1997:\n5). The ideal liberty-protecting government, then, ensures that no\nagent, including itself, has arbitrary power over any citizen. This is\naccomplished through an equal disbursement of power. Each person has\npower that offsets the power of another to arbitrarily interfere with\nher activities (Pettit, 1997: 67). \n\nThe republican conception of liberty is certainly distinct from both\nGreenian positive and negative conceptions. Unlike Greenian positive\nliberty, republican liberty is not primarily concerned with rational\nautonomy, realizing one’s true nature, or becoming one’s\nhigher self. When all dominating power has been dispersed, republican\ntheorists are generally silent about these goals (Larmore\n2001). Unlike negative liberty, republican liberty is primarily\nfocused upon “defenseless susceptibility to interference, rather\nthan actual interference” (Pettit, 1996: 577). Thus, in contrast\nto the ordinary negative conception, on the republican conception the\nmere possibility of arbitrary interference is a limitation of\nliberty. Republican liberty thus seems to involve a modal claim about\nthe possibility of interference, and this is often cashed out in terms\nof complex counterfactual claims. It is not clear whether these claims\ncan be adequately explicated (Gaus, 2003; cf. Larmore, 2004). \n\nSome republican theorists, such as Quentin Skinner (1998: 113),\nMaurizio Viroli (2002: 6) and Pettit (1997: 8–11), view republicanism\nas an alternative to liberalism. When republican liberty is seen\nas a basis for criticizing market liberty and market society, this is\nplausible (Gaus, 2003b). However, when liberalism is understood more\nexpansively, and not so closely tied to either negative liberty or\nmarket society, republicanism becomes indistinguishable from\nliberalism (Ghosh, 2008; Rogers, 2008; Larmore, 2001; Dagger,\n1997). \n\nLiberal political theory, then, fractures over the conception of\nliberty. In practice, another crucial fault line concerns the moral\nstatus of private property and the market order. For classical\nliberals — ‘old’ liberals — liberty and\nprivate property are intimately related. From the eighteenth century\nright up to today, classical liberals have insisted that an economic\nsystem based on private property is uniquely consistent with\nindividual liberty, allowing each to live her life —including\nemploying her labor and her capital — as she sees fit. Indeed,\nclassical liberals and libertarians have often asserted that in some\nway liberty and property are really the same thing; it has been\nargued, for example, that all rights, including liberty rights, are\nforms of property; others have maintained that property is itself a\nform of freedom (Gaus, 1994; Steiner, 1994). A market order based on\nprivate property is thus seen as an embodiment of freedom\n(Robbins, 1961: 104). Unless people are free to make contracts and\nsell their labour, save and invest their incomes as they see fit, and\nfree to launch enterprises as they raise the capital, they are not\nreally free. \n\nClassical liberals employ a second argument connecting liberty and\nprivate property. Rather than insisting that the freedom to obtain and\nemploy private property is simply one aspect of people’s\nliberty, this second argument insists that private property\neffectively protects liberty, and no protection can be effective\nwithout private property. Here the idea is that the dispersion of\npower that results from a free market economy based on private\nproperty protects the liberty of subjects against encroachments by the\nstate. As F.A. Hayek argues, “There can be no freedom of press\nif the instruments of printing are under government control, no\nfreedom of assembly if the needed rooms are so controlled, no freedom\nof movement if the means of transport are a government monopoly”\n(1978: 149). \n\nAlthough classical liberals agree on the fundamental importance of\nprivate property to a free society, the classical liberal tradition\nitself is a spectrum of views, from near-anarchist to those that\nattribute a significant role to the state in economic and social\npolicy (on this spectrum, see Mack and Gaus, 2004). Towards the\nextreme ‘libertarian’ end of the classical liberal\nspectrum are views of justified states as legitimate monopolies that\nmay with justice charge for essential rights-protection services:\ntaxation is legitimate if necessary and sufficient for effective\nprotection of liberty and property. Further ‘leftward’ we\nencounter classical liberal views that allow taxation for public\neducation in particular, and more generally for public goods and\nsocial infrastructure. Moving yet further ‘left’, some\nclassical liberal views allow for a modest social minimum.(e.g.,\nHayek, 1976: 87). Most nineteenth century classical liberal economists\nendorsed a variety of state policies, encompassing not only the\ncriminal law and enforcement of contracts, but the licensing of\nprofessionals, health, safety and fire regulations, banking\nregulations, commercial infrastructure (roads, harbors and canals) and\noften encouraged unionization (Gaus, 1983b). Although classical\nliberalism today often is associated with libertarianism, the broader\nclassical liberal tradition was centrally concerned with bettering the\nlot of the working class, women, blacks, immigrants, and so on. The\naim, as Bentham put it, was to make the poor richer, not the rich\npoorer (Bentham, 1952 [1795]: vol. 1, 226n). Consequently, classical\nliberals treat the leveling of wealth and income as outside the\npurview of legitimate aims of government coercion. \n\nWhat has come to be known as ‘new’,\n‘revisionist’, ‘welfare state’, or perhaps\nbest, ‘social justice’, liberalism challenges this\nintimate connection between personal liberty and a private property\nbased market order (Freeden, 1978; Gaus, 1983b; Paul, Miller and Paul,\n2007). Three factors help explain the rise of this revisionist\ntheory. First, the new liberalism arose in the late nineteenth and\nearly twentieth centuries, a period in which the ability of a free\nmarket to sustain what Lord Beveridge (1944: 96) called a\n‘prosperous equilibrium’ was being questioned. Believing\nthat a private property based market tended to be unstable, or could,\nas Keynes argued (1973 [1936]), get stuck in an equilibrium with high\nunemployment, new liberals came to doubt, initially in empirical\ngrounds, that classical liberalism was an adequate foundation for a\nstable, free society. Here the second factor comes into play: just as\nthe new liberals were losing faith in the market, their faith in\ngovernment as a means of supervising economic life was\nincreasing. This was partly due to the experiences of the First World\nWar, in which government attempts at economic planning seemed to\nsucceed (Dewey, 1929: 551–60); more importantly, this reevaluation of\nthe state was spurred by the democratization of western states, and\nthe conviction that, for the first time, elected officials could truly\nbe, in J.A. Hobson’s phrase ‘representatives of the\ncommunity’ (1922: 49). As D.G. Ritchie proclaimed: \n\nThe third factor underlying the currency of the new liberalism was\nprobably the most fundamental: a growing conviction that, so far from\nbeing ‘the guardian of every other right’ (Ely, 1992: 26),\nproperty rights foster an unjust inequality of power. They entrench a\nmerely formal equality that in actual practice systematically fails to\nsecure the kind of equal positive liberty that matters on the ground\nfor the working class. This theme is central to what is now called\n‘liberalism’ in American politics, combining a strong\nendorsement of civil and personal liberties with indifference or even\nhostility to private ownership. The seeds of this newer liberalism can\nbe found in Mill’s On Liberty. Although Mill insisted\nthat the ‘so-called doctrine of Free Trade’ rested on\n‘equally solid’ grounds as did the ‘principle of\nindividual liberty’ (1963, vol. 18: 293), he nevertheless\ninsisted that the justifications of personal and economic liberty were\ndistinct. And in his\nPrinciples of Political Economy Mill consistently emphasized\nthat it is an open question whether personal liberty can flourish\nwithout private property (1963, vol. 2; 203–210), a view that Rawls\nwas to reassert over a century later (2001: Part IV). \n\nOne consequence of Rawls’s great work, A Theory of\nJustice (1999 [first published in 1971]) is that the ‘new\nliberalism’ has become focused on developing a theory of social\njustice. Since the 1960s when Rawls began to publish the elements of\nhis emerging theory, liberal political philosophers have analyzed, and\ndisputed, his famous ‘difference principle’ according to\nwhich a just basic structure of society arranges social and economic\ninequalities such that they are to the greatest advantage of the least\nwell off representative group (1999b:266). For Rawls, the default is\nan equal distribution of (basically) income and wealth; only\ninequalities that best enhance the long-term prospects of the least\nadvantaged are just. As Rawls sees it, the difference principle\nconstitutes a public recognition of the principle of reciprocity: the\nbasic structure is to be arranged such that no social group advances\nat the cost of another (2001: 122–24). Many followers of Rawls have\nfocused less on the ideal of reciprocity than on the commitment to\nequality (Dworkin, 2000). Indeed, what was previously called\n‘welfare state’ liberalism is now often described as\nliberal egalitarianism. However, see Jan Narveson’s essay on\nHobbes’s seeming defense of the welfare state (in Courtland\n2018) for historical reflections on the difference). \nAnd in one way that is especially appropriate: in his later work Rawls\ninsists that welfare-state capitalism does not constitute a just basic\nstructure (2001: 137–38). If some version of capitalism is to be just\nit must be a ‘property owning democracy’ with a wide\ndiffusion of ownership; a market socialist regime, in Rawls’s\nview, is more just than welfare-state capitalism (2001: 135-38). Not\ntoo surprisingly, classical liberals such as Hayek (1976) insist that\nthe contemporary liberal fixation on ‘the mirage of social\njustice’ leads modern liberals to ignore the extent to which, as\na matter of historical observation, freedom depends on a decentralized\nmarket based on private property, the overall results of which are\nunpredictable. \nThus, Robert Nozick (1974: 160ff) famously classifies Rawls’s\ndifference principle as patterned but not historical: prescribing a\ndistribution while putting no moral weight on who produced the goods\nbeing distributed. One stark difference that emerges from this is that\nnew liberalism’s theory of justice is a theory about how to treat the\npie while old liberalism’s theory of justice is a theory about how to\ntreat bakers (Schmidtz, 2017: 231).  \nThe problem with patterned principles is that, in Nozick’s words,\nliberty upsets patterns.  “No end-state principle or distributional\npatterned principle of justice can be continuously realized without\ncontinuous interference with people’s lives.” To illustrate, Nozick\nasks you to imagine that society achieves a pattern of perfect justice\nby the lights of whatever principle you prefer. Then someone offers\nWilt Chamberlain a dollar for the privilege of watching Wilt play\nbasketball. Before we know it, thousands of people are paying Wilt a\ndollar each, every time Wilt puts on a show. Wilt gets rich. The\ndistribution is no longer equal, and no one complains. Nozick’s\nquestion: If justice is a pattern, achievable at a given moment, what\nhappens if you achieve perfection? Must you then prohibit\neverything—no further consuming, creating, trading, or\neven giving—so as not to upset the perfect pattern?\nNotice: Nozick neither argues nor presumes people can do whatever they\nwant with their property. Nozick, recalling the focus on connecting\nproperty rights to liberty that animated liberalism in its classical\nform, notes that if there is anything at all people can do,\neven if the only thing they are free to do is give a coin to an\nentertainer, then even that tiniest of liberties will, over time,\ndisturb the favored pattern. Nozick is right that if we focus on time\nslices, we focus on isolated moments, and take moments too seriously,\nwhen what matters is not the pattern of holdings at a moment but the\npattern of how people treat each other over time.  Even tiny liberties\nmust upset the pattern of a static moment. By the same token, however,\nthere is no reason why liberty must upset an ongoing pattern of fair\ntreatment. A moral principle forbidding racial discrimination, for\nexample, prescribes no particular end-state.  Such a principle is what\nNozick calls weakly patterned, sensitive to history as well as to\npattern, and prescribing an ideal of how people should be treated\nwithout prescribing an end-state distribution. It affects the\npattern without prescribing a pattern.  And if a principle\nforbidding racial discrimination works its way into a society via\ncultural progress rather than legal intervention, it need not involve\nany interference whatsoever. So, although Nozick sometimes speaks as\nif his critique applies to all patterns, we should take seriously his\nconcession that “weak” patterns are compatible with liberty.  Some may\npromote liberty, depending on how they are introduced and\nmaintained. See Schmidtz and Brennan (2010: chap.6). For work by\nmodern liberals that resonates with Nozick’s dissection of the\ndimensions of equality that plausibly can count as liberal, see also\nAnderson (1999), Young (1990), and Sen (1992).  \nAccordingly, even granting to Nozick that time-slice principles\nlicense immense, constant, intolerable interference with everyday\nlife, there is some reason to doubt that Rawls intended to embrace any\nsuch view.  In his first article, Rawls said, “we cannot determine the\njustness of a situation by examining it at a single moment.” Years\nlater, Rawls added, “It is a mistake to focus attention on the varying\nrelative positions of individuals and to require that every change,\nconsidered as a single transaction viewed in isolation, be in itself\njust.  It is the arrangement of the basic structure which is to be\njudged, and judged from a general point of view.” Thus, to Rawls,\nbasic structure’s job is not to make every transaction work to the\nworking class’s advantage, let alone to the advantage of each member\nof the class.  Rawls was more realistic than that.  Instead, it is the\ntrend of a whole society over time that is supposed to benefit the\nworking class as a class.  To be sure, Rawls was a kind of\negalitarian, but the pattern Rawls meant to endorse was a pattern of\nequal status, applying not so much to a distribution as to an ongoing\nrelationship. This is not to say that Nozick’s critique had no\npoint. Nozick showed what an alternative theory might look like,\nportraying Wilt Chamberlain as a separate person in a more robust\nsense (unencumbered by nebulous debts to society) than Rawls could\ncountenance. To Nozick, Wilt’s advantages are not what\nWilt finds on the table; Wilt’s advantages are what\nWilt brings to the table.  And respecting what Wilt brings to\nthe table is the exact essence of respecting him as a separate\nperson. In part due to Nozick, today’s egalitarians now acknowledge\nthat any equality worthy of aspiration will focus less on justice as a\nproperty of a time-slice distribution and more on how people are\ntreated: how they are rewarded for their contributions\nand enabled over time to make contributions worth\nrewarding. (Schmidtz and Brennan, 2010: chap.6). \n\nAs his work evolved, Rawls (1996: 5ff) insisted that his liberalism\nwas not a ‘comprehensive’ doctrine, that is, one which\nincludes an overall theory of value, an ethical theory, an\nepistemology, or a controversial metaphysics of the person and\nsociety. Our modern societies, characterized by a ‘reasonable\npluralism’, are already filled with such doctrines. The aim of\n‘political liberalism’ is not to add yet another sectarian\ndoctrine, but to provide a political framework that is neutral between\nsuch controversial comprehensive doctrines (Larmore, 1996: 121ff). If\nit is to serve as the basis for public reasoning in our diverse\nwestern societies, liberalism must be restricted to a core set of\npolitical principles that are, or can be, the subject of consensus\namong all reasonable citizens. Rawls’s notion of a purely political\nconception of liberalism seems more austere than the traditional\nliberal political theories discussed above, being largely restricted\nto constitutional principles upholding basic civil liberties and the\ndemocratic process. \n\nAs Gaus (2004) has argued, the distinction between\n‘political’ and ‘comprehensive’ liberalism\nmisses a great deal. Liberal theories form a broad continuum, from\nthose that constitute full-blown philosophical systems, to those that\nrely on a full theory of value and the good, to those that rely on a\ntheory of the right (but not the good), all the way to those that seek\nto be purely political doctrines. Nevertheless, it is important to\nappreciate that, though liberalism is primarily a political theory, it\nhas been associated with broader theories of ethics, value, and\nsociety. Indeed, many believe that liberalism cannot rid itself of all\ncontroversial metaphysical (Hampton, 1989) or epistemological (Raz,\n1990) commitments. \n\nFollowing Wilhelm von Humboldt (1993 [1854]), in On Liberty\nMill argues that one basis for endorsing freedom (Mill\nbelieves there are many), is the goodness of developing individuality\nand cultivating capacities: \n\nThis is not just a theory about politics: it is a substantive,\nperfectionist, moral theory about the good. On this view, the\nright thing to do is to promote development or perfection, but only a\nregime securing extensive liberty for each person can accomplish this\n(Wall, 1998). This moral ideal of human perfection and development\ndominated liberal thinking in the latter part of the nineteenth century, and\nmuch of the twentieth: not only Mill, but T.H. Green,\nL.T. Hobhouse, Bernard Bosanquet, John Dewey and even Rawls show\nallegiance to variants of this perfectionist ethic and the claim that\nit provides a foundation for endorsing a regime of liberal rights\n(Gaus, 1983a). And it is fundamental to the proponents of liberal\nautonomy discussed above, as well as ‘liberal virtue’\ntheorists such as William Galston (1980).  That the good life is\nnecessarily a freely chosen one in which a person develops his unique\ncapacities as part of a plan of life is probably the dominant liberal\nethic of the past century. \n\nThe main challenge to Millian perfectionism’s status as the\ndistinctly liberal ethic comes from moral contractualism, which can be\ndivided into what might very roughly be labeled ‘Kantian’\nand ‘Hobbesian’ versions. According to Kantian\ncontractualism, “society, being composed of a plurality of\npersons, each with his own aims, interests, and conceptions of the\ngood, is best arranged when it is governed by principles that do\nnot themselves presuppose any particular conception of the\ngood…” (Sandel, 1982: 1). On this view, respect for the\npersonhood of others demands that we refrain from imposing our view of\nthe good life on them. Only principles that can be justified to all\nrespect the personhood of each. We thus witness the tendency of recent\nliberal theory (Reiman, 1990; Scanlon, 1998) to transform the social\ncontract from an account of the state to an overall justification of\nmorality, or at least a social morality. Basic to such ‘Kantian\ncontractualism’ is the idea that suitably idealized individuals\nare motivated not by the pursuit of gain, but by a commitment or\ndesire to\n publicly justify\n the claims they\nmake on others (Reiman, 1990; Scanlon, 1982). A moral code\nthat could be the object of agreement among such individuals is\nthus a publicly justified morality. \n\nIn contrast, distinctively Hobbesian contractualism supposes only\nthat individuals are self-interested and correctly perceive that each\nperson’s ability to effectively pursue her interests is enhanced by a\nframework of norms that structure social life and divide the fruits of\nsocial cooperation (Gauither, 1986; Hampton, 1986; Kavka,\n1986). Morality, then, is a common framework that advances the\nself-interest of each. The claim of Hobbesian contractualism to be a\ndistinctly liberal conception of morality stems from the importance of\nindividual freedom and property in such a common framework: only\nsystems of norms that allow each person great freedom to pursue her\ninterests as she sees fit could, it is argued, be the object of\nconsensus among self-interested agents (Courtland, 2008; Gaus 2003a:\nchap. 3; Gaus, 2012; Ridge, 1998; Gauthier, 1995). The continuing problem for\nHobbesian contractualism is the apparent rationality of free-riding:\nif everyone (or enough) complies with the terms of the contract, and\nso social order is achieved, it would seem rational to defect, and act\nimmorally when one can gain by doing so. This is essentially the\nargument of Hobbes’s ‘Foole’, and from Hobbes (1948\n[1651]: 94ff) to Gauthier (1986: 160ff), Hobbesians have tried to\nreply to it. \n\nTurning from rightness to goodness, we can identify three main\ncandidates for a liberal theory of value. We have already encountered\nthe first: perfectionism. Insofar as perfectionism is a theory of\nright action, it can be understood as an account of\nmorality. Obviously, however, it is an account of rightness that\npresupposes a theory of value or the good: the ultimate human value is\ndeveloped personality or an autonomous life. Competing with this\nobjectivist theory of value are two other liberal accounts: pluralism\nand subjectivism. \n\nIn his famous defence of negative liberty, Berlin insisted that values\nor ends are plural, and no interpersonally justifiable ranking among\nthese many ends is to be had. More than that, Berlin maintained that\nthe pursuit of one end necessarily implies that other ends will not be\nachieved. In this sense ends collide. In economic terms, the pursuit\nof one end entails opportunity costs: foregone pursuits which cannot\nbe impersonally shown to be less worthy. There is no interpersonally\njustifiable way to rank the ends, and no way to achieve them all. Each\nperson must devote herself to some ends at the cost of ignoring\nothers. For the pluralist, then, autonomy, perfection or development\nare not necessarily ranked higher than hedonistic pleasures,\nenvironmental preservation or economic equality. All compete for our\nallegiance, but because they are incommensurable, no choice can be\ninterpersonally justified. \n\nThe pluralist is not a subjectivist: that values are many, competing\nand incommensurable does not imply that they are somehow dependent on\nsubjective experiences. But the claim that what a person values rests\non experiences that vary from person to person has long been a part of\nthe liberal tradition. To Hobbes, what one values depends on what one\ndesires (1948 [1651]: 48). Locke advances a ‘taste theory of\nvalue’: \n\nThe perfectionist, the pluralist and the subjectivist concur on the\ncrucial point: the nature of value is such that reasonable people\npursue different ways of living. To the perfectionist, this is because\neach person has unique capacities, the development of which confers\nvalue on her life; to the pluralist, it is because values are many and\nconflicting, and no one life can include them all, or make the\ninterpersonally correct choice among them; and to the subjectivist, it\nis because our ideas about what is valuable stem from our desires or\ntastes, and these differ from one individual to another. All three\nviews, then, defend the basic liberal idea that people rationally\nfollow different ways of living. But in themselves, such notions of\nthe good are not full-fledged liberal ethics, for an additional\nargument is required linking liberal value with norms of equal\nliberty, and to the idea that other people command a certain respect\nand a certain deference simply by virtue of having values of their\nown. To be sure, Berlin seems to believe this is a very quick\nargument: the inherent plurality of ends points to\nthe political preeminence of liberty (see, for example, Gray:\n2006). Guaranteeing each a measure of negative liberty is, Berlin\nargues, the most humane ideal, as it recognizes that ‘human\ngoals are many’, and no one can make a choice that is right for\nall people (1969: 171). It is here that subjectivists and pluralists\nalike sometimes rely on versions of moral contractualism. Those who\ninsist that liberalism is ultimately nihilistic can be interpreted as\narguing that this transition cannot be made successfully: liberals, on\ntheir view, are stuck with a subjectivistic or pluralistic theory of\nvalue, and no account of the right emerges from it. \n\nThroughout the last century, liberalism has been beset by\ncontroversies between, on the one hand, those broadly identified as\n‘individualists’ and, on the other,\n‘collectivists’, ‘communitarians’ or\n‘organicists’ (for skepticism about this, though, see\nBird, 1999).  These vague and sweeping designations have been applied\nto a wide array of disputes; we focus here on controversies concerning\n(i) the nature of society; (ii) the nature of the self. \n\nLiberalism is, of course, usually associated with individualist\nanalyses of society.  ‘Human beings in society’, Mill\nclaimed, ‘have no properties but those which are derived from,\nand which may be resolved into, the laws of the nature of individual\nmen’ (1963, Vol. 8: 879; see also Bentham: 1970 [1823]: chap. I,\nsec. 4). Herbert Spencer agreed: “the properties of the mass are\ndependent upon the attributes of its component parts” (1995\n[1851]: 1).  In the last years of the nineteenth century this\nindividualist view was increasingly subject to attack, especially by\nthose who were influenced by idealist philosophy.  D. G.  Ritche,\ncriticizing Spencer’s individualist liberalism, denies that\nsociety is simply a ‘heap’ of individuals, insisting that\nit is more akin to an organism, with a complex internal life (1896:\n13).  Liberals such as L. T. Hobhouse and Dewey refused to adopt\nradically collectivist views such as those advocated by Bernard\nBosanquet (2001), but they too rejected the radical individualism of\nBentham, Mill and Spencer.  Throughout most of the first half of the\ntwentieth century such ‘organic’ analyses of society held\nsway in liberal theory, even in economics (see A.F Mummery and\nJ. A. Hobson, 1956: 106; J.M. Keynes, 1972: 275).  \n\nDuring and after the Second World War the idea that liberalism was\nbased on inherently individualist analysis of humans-in-society arose\nagain. Karl Popper’s The Open Society and its Enemies (1945)\npresented a sustained critique of Hegelian and Marxist theory and its\ncollectivist and historicist, and to Popper, inherently illiberal,\nunderstanding of society.  The reemergence of economic analysis in\nliberal theory brought to the fore a thoroughgoing methodological\nindividualism.  Writing in the early 1960s, James Buchanan and Gordon\nTullock adamantly defended the ‘individualistic postulate’\nagainst all forms of ‘organicism’: “This\n[organicist] approach or theory of the collectivity….is essentially\nopposed to the Western philosophical tradition in which the human\nindividual is the primary philosophical entity” (1965:\n11–12). Human beings, insisted Buchanan and Tullock, are the only real\nchoosers and decision-makers, and their preferences determine both\npublic and private actions.  The renascent individualism of\nlate-twentieth century liberalism was closely bound up with the\ninduction of Hobbes as a member of the liberal pantheon.  Hobbes’s\nrelentlessly individualistic account of society, and the manner in\nwhich his analysis of the state of nature lent itself to\ngame-theoretical modeling, yielded a highly individualist, formal\nanalysis of the liberal state and liberal morality. \n\nOf course, as is widely known, the last twenty-five years have\nwitnessed a renewed interest in collectivist analyses of liberal\nsociety —though the term ‘collectivist’ is abjured\nin favor of ‘communitarian’.  Writing in 1985, Amy Gutmann\nobserved that “we are witnessing a revival of communitarian\ncriticisms of liberal political theory. Like the critics of the 1960s,\nthose of the 1980s fault liberalism for being mistakenly and\nirreparably individualistic” (1985: 308).  Starting with Michael\nSandel’s (1982) famous criticism of Rawls, a number of critics charge\nthat liberalism is necessarily premised on an abstract conception of\nindividual selves as pure choosers, whose commitments, values and\nconcerns are possessions of the self, but never constitute the self.\nAlthough the ‘liberal-communitarian’ debate ultimately involved\nwide-ranging moral, political and sociological disputes about the\nnature of communities, and the rights and responsibilities of their\nmembers, the heart of the debate was about the nature of liberal\nselves. For Sandel the flaw at the heart of Rawls’s liberalism is its\nimplausibly abstract theory of the self, the pure autonomous chooser.\nRawls, he charges, ultimately assumes that it makes sense to identify\nus with a pure capacity for choice, and that such pure choosers might\nreject any or all of their attachments and values and yet retain their\nidentity.  \n\nFrom the mid-1980s onwards various liberals sought to show how\nliberalism may consistently advocate a theory of the self which finds\nroom for cultural membership and other non-chosen attachments and\ncommitments which at least partially constitute the self (Kymlicka,\n1989). Much of liberal theory has became focused on the issue as to\nhow we can be social creatures, members of cultures and raised in\nvarious traditions, while also being autonomous choosers who employ\nour liberty to construct lives of our own. \n\nIn On Liberty Mill argued that “Liberty, as a\nprinciple, has no application to any state of things anterior to the\ntime when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and\nequal discussion” (1963, vol. 18: 224). Thus “Despotism is\na legitimate form of government in dealing with barbarians, provided\nthe end be their improvement…” (1963, vol. 18: 224). This\npassage — infused with the spirit of nineteenth century\nimperialism (and perhaps, as some maintain, latent racism) — is\noften ignored by defenders of Mill as an embarrassment (Parekh, 1994;\nParekh, 1995; Mehta, 1999; Pitts, 2005).This is not to say that such\nMillian passages are without thoughtful defenders. See, for example,\nInder Marawah (2011). Nevertheless, it raises a question that still\ndivides liberals: are liberal political principles justified for all\npolitical communities? In The Law of Peoples Rawls argues\nthat they are not. According to Rawls there can be a ‘decent\nhierarchical society’ which is not based on the liberal\nconception of all persons as free and equal, but instead views persons\nas “responsible and cooperating members of their respective\ngroups” but not inherently equal (1999a: 66).  Given this, the\nfull liberal conception of justice cannot be constructed out of shared\nideas of this ‘people’, though basic human rights,\nimplicit in the very idea of a social cooperative structure, apply to\nall peoples. David Miller (2002) develops a different defense of this\nanti-universalistic position, while those such as Thomas Pogge (2002:\nch. 4) and Martha Nussbaum (2002) reject Rawls’s position,\ninstead advocating versions of moral universalism: they claim that\nliberal moral principles apply to all states. \n\nThe debate about whether liberal principles apply to all political\ncommunities should not be confused with the debate as to whether\nliberalism is a state-centered theory, or whether, at least ideally,\nit is a cosmopolitan political theory for the community of all\nhumankind. Immanuel Kant — a moral universalist if ever there\nwas one — argued that all states should respect the dignity of\ntheir citizens as free and equal persons, yet denied that humanity\nforms one political community. Thus he rejected the ideal of a\nuniversal cosmopolitan liberal political community in favor of a world\nof states, all with internally just constitutions, and united in a\nconfederation to assure peace (1970 [1795]). \n\nOn a classical liberal theory, the difference between a world of\nliberal communities and a world liberal community is not of\nfundamental importance. Since the aim of government in a community is\nto assure the basic liberty and property rights of its citizens,\nborders are not of great moral significance in classical liberalism\n(Lomasky, 2007). In contrast under the\n‘new’ liberalism, which stresses redistributive programs\nto achieve social justice, it matters a great deal who is included\nwithin the political or moral community. If liberal principles require\nsignificant redistribution, then it is crucially important whether\nthese principles apply only within particular communities, or whether\ntheir reach is global. Thus a fundamental debate between Rawls and\nmany of his followers is whether the difference principle should only\nbe applied within a liberal state such as the United States (where the\nleast well off are the least well off Americans), or whether it should\nbe applied globally (where the least well off are the least well off\nin the world) (Rawls, 1999a: 113ff; Beitz, 1973: 143ff; Pogge, 1989:\nPart Three). \n\nLiberal political theory also fractures concerning the appropriate\nresponse to groups (cultural, religious, etc.) which endorse illiberal\npolicies and values. These groups may deny education to some of their\nmembers, advocate female genital mutilation, restrict religious\nfreedom, maintain an inequitable caste system, and so on. When, if\never, should a liberal group interfere with the\ninternal governance of an illiberal group?  \n\nSuppose first that the illiberal group is another political community\nor state. Can liberals intervene in the affairs of non-liberal states?\nMill provides a complicated answer in his 1859 essay ‘A Few\nWords on Non-Intervention’. Reiterating his claim from On\nLiberty that civilized and non-civilized countries are to be\ntreated differently, he insists that “barbarians have no rights\nas a nation, except a right to such treatment as may, at the\nearliest possible period, fit them for becoming one. The only moral\nlaws for the relation between a civilized and a barbarous government,\nare the universal rules of morality between man and man” (1963,\nvol. 21: 119). Although this strikes us today as simply a case for an\nobjectionable paternalistic imperialism (and it certainly was such a\ncase), Mill’s argument for the conclusion is more complex, including a\nclaim that, since international morality depends on reciprocity,\n‘barbarous’ governments that cannot be counted on to\nengage in reciprocal behavior have no rights qua\ngovernments. In any event, when Mill turns to interventions among\n‘civilized’ peoples he develops an altogether more\nsophisticated account as to when one state can intervene in the\naffairs of another to protect liberal principles. Here Mill is\ngenerally against intervention. “The reason is, that there can\nseldom be anything approaching to assurance that intervention, even if\nsuccessful, would be for the good of the people themselves. The only\ntest possessing any real value, of a people’s having become fit for\npopular institutions, is that they, or a sufficient proportion of them\nto prevail in the contest, are willing to brave labour and danger for\ntheir liberation” (1963, vol. 21: 122). \n\nIn addition to questions of efficacy, to the extent that peoples or\ngroups have rights to collective self-determination, intervention by a\nliberal group to induce a non-liberal community to adopt liberal\nprinciples will be morally objectionable. As with individuals,\nliberals may think that peoples or groups have freedom to make\nmistakes in managing their collective affairs. If people’s\nself-conceptions are based on their participation in such groups, even\nthose whose liberties are denied may object to, and perhaps in some\nway harmed by, the imposition of liberal principles (Margalit and Raz,\n1990; Tamir, 1993). Thus rather than proposing a doctrine of\nintervention many liberals propose various principles of\ntoleration which specify to what extent liberals must tolerate\nnon-liberal peoples and cultures. As is usual, Rawls’s discussion is\nsubtle and enlightening. In his account of the foreign affairs of\nliberal peoples, Rawls argues that liberal peoples must distinguish\n‘decent’ non-liberal societies from ‘outlaw’\nand other states; the former have a claim on liberal peoples to\ntolerance while the latter do not (1999a: 59–61). Decent peoples,\nargues Rawls, ‘simply do not tolerate’ outlaw states which\nignore human rights: such states may be subject to ‘forceful\nsanctions and even to intervention’ (1999a: 81). In contrast,\nRawls insists that “liberal peoples must try to encourage\n[non-liberal] decent peoples and not frustrate their vitality by\ncoercively insisting that all societies be liberal” (1999a:\n62). Chandran Kukathas (2003) — whose liberalism derives from\nthe classical tradition — is inclined to almost complete\ntoleration of non-liberal peoples, with the non-trivial proviso that there must be\nexit rights. \n\nThe status of non-liberal groups within liberal societies has\nincreasingly become a subject of debate, especially with respect to\nsome citizens of faith.  We should distinguish two questions: (i) to\nwhat extent should non-liberal cultural and religious communities be\nexempt from the requirements of the liberal state? and, (ii) to what\nextent can they be allowed to participate in decision-making in the\nliberal state? \n\nTurning to (i), liberalism has a long history of seeking to\naccommodate religious groups that have deep objections to certain\npublic policies, such as the Quakers, Mennonites or Sikhs. The most\ndifficult issues in this regard arise in relation to children and\neducation (see Galston, 2003; Fowler, 2010; Andersson, 2011) Mill, for\nexample, writes: \nOver the last thirty years, there has been a particular case that is\nat the core of this debate — Wisconsin vs. Yoder: [406\nU.S. 205 (1972)].  In this case, the United States Supreme Court\nupheld the right of Amish parents to avoid compulsory schooling laws\nand remove their children from school at the age of 14 — thus,\naccording to the Amish, avoiding secular influences that might\nundermine the traditional Amish way of life. Because cultural and\nreligious communities raise and educate children, they cannot be seen\nas purely voluntary opt-outs from the liberal state: they exercise\ncoercive power over children, and so basic liberal principles about\nprotecting the innocent from unjustified coercion come into play. Some\nhave maintained that liberal principles require that the state should\nintervene (against groups like the Amish) in order to [1] provide the\nchildren with an effective right of exit that would otherwise be\ndenied via a lack of education (Okin, 2002), [2] to protect the\nchildren’s right to an autonomous and ‘open future’\n(Feinberg, 1980) and/or [3] to insure that children will have the\ncognitive tools to prepare them for their future role as citizens\n(Galston, 1995: p. 529; Macedo, 1995: pp. 285–6). Other liberal\ntheorists, on the other hand, have argued that the state should not\nintervene because it might undermine the inculcation of certain values\nthat are necessary for the continued existence of certain\ncomprehensive doctrines (Galston, 1995: p. 533; Stolzenberg, 1993: pp.\n582–3). Moreover, some such as Harry Brighouse (1998) have argued that\nthe inculcation of liberal values through compulsory education might\nundermine the legitimacy of liberal states because children would not\n(due to possible indoctrination) be free to consent to such\ninstitutions. \n \nQuestion (ii) — the extent to which non-liberal beliefs and\nvalues may be employed in liberal political discussion— has\nbecome the subject of sustained debate in the years following Rawls’s\nPolitical Liberalism. According to Rawls’s liberalism —\nand what we might call ‘public reason liberalism’ more\ngenerally — because our societies are characterized by\n‘reasonable pluralism’, coercion cannot be justified on\nthe basis of comprehensive moral or religious systems of belief. But\nmany friends of religion (e.g., Eberle, 2002; Perry, 1993) argue that\nthis is objectionably ‘exclusionary’: conscientious\nbelievers are barred from voting on their deepest convictions. Again\nliberals diverge in their responses. Some such as Stephen Macedo take\na pretty hard-nosed attitude: ‘if some people…feel\n“silenced” or “marginalized” by the fact that\nsome of us believe that it is wrong to shape basic liberties on the\nbasis of religious or metaphysical claims, I can only say “grow\nup!”’ (2000: 35). Rawls, in contrast, seeks to be more\naccommodating, allowing that arguments based on religious\ncomprehensive doctrines may enter into liberal politics on issues of\nbasic justice “provided that, in due course, we give properly\npublic reasons to support the principles and policies that our\ncomprehensive doctrine is said to support” (1999a: 144). Thus\nRawls allows the legitimacy of religious-based arguments against\nslavery and in favor of the United States civil rights movement,\nbecause ultimately such arguments were supported by public reasons.\nOthers (e.g., Greenawalt, 1995) hold that even this is too\nrestrictive: it is difficult for liberals to justify a moral\nprohibition on a religious citizen from voicing her view in liberal\npolitical debate. Gaus and Vallier seek to ameliorate such tensions,\nin part, by acknowledging an asymmetry between the ‘reasons\nto justify to another a law’ and the ‘reasons\nto reject’ a law (2009: 54). They argue that although\n“a secular rationale is necessary in our society for a publicly\njustified law, it can be defeated by a reasonable religious conviction\nwithout secular backing” (2009: 63). Thus, citizens of faith\nwould be able to preserve their religious integrity, all the while\nremaining unable to coerce others via unshared religious reasons. \n\nGiven that liberalism fractures on so many issues — the nature\nof liberty, the place of property and democracy in a just society, the\ncomprehensiveness and the reach of the liberal ideal — one might\nwonder whether there is any point in talking of\n‘liberalism’ at all. It is not, though, an unimportant or\ntrivial thing that all these theories take liberty to be the grounding\npolitical value. Radical democrats assert the overriding value of\nequality, communitarians maintain that the demands of belongingness\ntrump freedom, and conservatives complain that the liberal devotion to\nfreedom undermines traditional values and virtues and so social order\nitself. Intramural disputes aside, liberals join in rejecting these\nconceptions of political right.","contact.mail":"scourtla@d.umn.edu","contact.domain":"d.umn.edu"},{"date.published":"1996-11-28","date.changed":"2018-01-22","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/","author1":"Gerald Gaus","author2":"Shane D.

On any close examination, it seems\nto fracture into a range of related but sometimes competing\nvisions. In this entry we focus on debates within the liberal\ntradition. (1) We contrast three interpretations of liberalism’s\ncore commitment to liberty. (2) We contrast ‘old’ and\n‘new’ liberalism.

Must all political communities\nbe liberal? Could a liberal coherently answer this question by saying\nNo?  Could a liberal coherently answer this question by saying\nYes?\n\n\n“By definition,” Maurice Cranston says,\n“a liberal is a man who believes in liberty” (1967:\n459). In two ways, liberals accord liberty primacy as a\npolitical value.  \n(i) Liberals have typically maintained that humans\nare naturally in “a State of perfect Freedom to order\ntheir Actions…as they think fit…without asking leave, or\ndepending on the Will of any other Man” (Locke, 1960 [1689]:\n287). Mill too argued that “the burden of proof is supposed to\nbe with those who are against liberty; who contend for any restriction\nor prohibition…. The a priori assumption is in favour\nof freedom…” (1963, vol. 21: 262). Recent liberal\nthinkers such as as Joel Feinberg (1984: 9), Stanley Benn (1988: 87)\nand John Rawls (2001: 44, 112) agree. This might be called the\nFundamental Liberal Principle (Gaus, 1996: 162–166): freedom\nis normatively basic, and so the onus of justification is on those who\nwould use coercion to limit freedom. It follows from this that\npolitical authority and law must be justified, as they limit the\nliberty of citizens. Consequently, a central question of liberal\npolitical theory is whether political authority can be justified, and\nif so, how. For this reason, social contract theory, as developed by\nThomas Hobbes (1948 [1651]), John Locke (1960 [1689]), Jean-Jacques\nRousseau (1973 [1762]) and Immanuel Kant (1965 [1797]), is usually\nviewed as liberal even though the actual political prescriptions of,\nsay, Hobbes and Rousseau, have distinctly illiberal features. Insofar\nas they take as their starting point a state of nature in which humans\nare free and equal, and so argue that any limitation of this freedom\nand equality must be justified (i.e., by the social contract), the\nsocial contract tradition expresses the Fundamental Liberal\nPrinciple. The Fundamental Liberal Principle holds that restrictions\non liberty must be justified. Because he accepts this, we can\nunderstand Hobbes as part of the liberal tradition.\n\n \n(ii) That is to say, although no one classifies Hobbes as a liberal,\nthere is reason to regard Hobbes as an instigator of liberal\nphilosophy (see also Waldron 2001), for it was Hobbes who asked on\nwhat grounds citizens owe allegiance to the sovereign. Implicit in\nHobbes’s question is a rejection of the presumption that\ncitizens are the king’s property; on the contrary, kings are\naccountable to sovereign citizens. In the culture at large, this view\nof the relation between citizen and king had been taking shape for\ncenturies. The Magna Carta was a series of agreements, beginning in\n1215, arising out of disputes between the barons and King John. The\nMagna Carta eventually settled that the king is bound by the rule of\nlaw. In 1215, the Magna Carta was part of the beginning rather than\nthe end of the argument, but by the mid-1300s, concepts of individual\nrights to trial by jury, due process, and equality before the law were\nmore firmly established. The Magna Carta was coming to be seen as\nvesting sovereignty not only in nobles but in “the People”\nas such. By the mid-1400s, John Fortescue, England’s Chief Justice\nfrom 1442 to 1461, would write The Difference Between an Absolute\nand Limited Monarchy, a plea for limited monarchy that arguably\nrepresents the beginning of English political thought (Schmidtz and\nBrennan, 2010: chap. 2).  \nHobbes generally is treated as one of the first and greatest social\ncontract thinkers. Typically, Hobbes also is seen as an advocate of\nunlimited monarchy. On Hobbes’s theory, Leviathan’s authority is\nalmost absolute along a particular dimension: namely, Leviathan is\nauthorized to do whatever it takes to keep the peace.  This special\nend justifies almost any means, including drastic limitations on\nliberty. Yet, note the limitations implicit in the end\nitself. Leviathan’s job is to keep the peace: not to do everything\nworth doing, but simply to secure the peace. Hobbes, the famed\nabsolutist, in fact developed a model of government sharply limited in\nthis most important way. \nParadigmatic liberals such as Locke not only advocate the Fundamental\nLiberal Principle, but also maintain that justified limitations on\nliberty are fairly modest. Only a limited government can be justified;\nindeed, the basic task of government is to protect the equal liberty\nof citizens. Thus John Rawls’s paradigmatically liberal first\nprinciple of justice: “Each person is to have an equal right to\nthe most extensive system of equal basic liberty compatible with a\nsimilar system for all” (Rawls, 1999b: 220). \nLiberals disagree, however, about the concept of liberty, and as a\nresult the liberal ideal of protecting individual liberty can lead to\ndifferent conceptions of the task of government. Isaiah Berlin\nfamously advocated a negative conception of liberty: \n\nFor Berlin and those who follow him, then, the heart of liberty is the\nabsence of coercion by others; consequently, the liberal state’s\ncommitment to protecting liberty is, essentially, the job of ensuring\nthat citizens do not coerce each other without compelling\njustification. So understood, negative liberty is an\nopportunity-concept. Being free is a matter of what options\nare left open to us, regardless of whether we exercise such options\n(Taylor, 1979). \n\nMany liberals have been attracted to more ‘positive’\nconceptions of liberty. Although Rousseau (1973 [1762]) seemed to\nadvocate a positive conception of liberty, according to which one was\nfree when one acted according to one’s true will (the general will),\nthe positive conception was best developed by the British\nneo-Hegelians of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,\nsuch as Thomas Hill Green and Bernard Bosanquet (2001 [1923]). Green\nacknowledged that “…it must be of course admitted that\nevery usage of the term [i.e., ‘freedom’] to express\nanything but a social and political relation of one man to other\ninvolves a metaphor…It always implies…some exemption\nfrom compulsion by another…”(1986 [1895]:\n229). Nevertheless, Green went on to claim that a person can be unfree\nif he is subject to an impulse or craving that cannot be\ncontrolled. Such a person, Green argued, is “…in the\ncondition of a bondsman who is carrying out the will of another, not\nhis own” (1986 [1895]: 228). Just as a slave is not doing what\nhe really wants to do, one who is, say, an alcoholic, is\nbeing led by a craving to look for satisfaction where it cannot,\nultimately, be found. \n\nFor Green, a person is free only if she is self-directed or\nautonomous. Running throughout liberal political theory is an ideal of\na free person as one whose actions are in some sense\nher own. In this sense, positive liberty is\nan exercise-concept. One is free merely to the degree that\none has effectively determined oneself and the shape of one’s\nlife (Taylor, 1979).  Such a person is not subject to compulsions,\ncritically reflects on her ideals and so does not unreflectively\nfollow custom, and does not ignore her long-term interests for\nshort-term pleasures. This ideal of freedom as autonomy has its roots\nnot only in Rousseau’s and Kant’s political theory, but\nalso in John Stuart Mill’s On Liberty.  And today it is\na dominant strain in liberalism, as witnessed by the work of S.I.\nBenn (1988), Gerald Dworkin (1988), and Joseph Raz (1986); see also\nthe essays in Christman and Anderson (2005). \nGreen’s autonomy-based conception of positive freedom is often run\ntogether with a notion of ‘positive’ freedom: freedom as\neffective power to act or to pursue one’s ends. In the words of the\nBritish socialist R. H. Tawney, freedom thus understood is ‘the\nability to act’ (1931: 221; see also Gaus, 2000; ch. 5.) On this\npositive conception, a person not prohibited from being a member of a\nCountry Club but too poor to afford membership is not free to be a\nmember: she lacks an effective power to act. Positive freedom\nqua effective power to act closely ties freedom to material\nresources. (Education, for example, should be easily available so that\nall can develop their capacities.) It was this conception of positive\nliberty that Hayek had in mind when he insisted that although\n“freedom and wealth are both good things…they still\nremain different” (1960: 17–18). \n\nAn older notion of liberty that has recently resurfaced is\nthe republican, or neo-Roman, conception of liberty, which has roots\nin the writings of Cicero and Niccolo Machiavelli (1950\n[1513]). According to Philip Pettit, On this view, the opposite of freedom is domination. To be unfree\nis to be “subject to the potentially capricious will or the\npotentially idiosyncratic judgement of another” (Pettit, 1997:\n5). The ideal liberty-protecting government, then, ensures that no\nagent, including itself, has arbitrary power over any citizen. This is\naccomplished through an equal disbursement of power. Each person has\npower that offsets the power of another to arbitrarily interfere with\nher activities (Pettit, 1997: 67). \n\nThe republican conception of liberty is certainly distinct from both\nGreenian positive and negative conceptions. Unlike Greenian positive\nliberty, republican liberty is not primarily concerned with rational\nautonomy, realizing one’s true nature, or becoming one’s\nhigher self. When all dominating power has been dispersed, republican\ntheorists are generally silent about these goals (Larmore\n2001). Unlike negative liberty, republican liberty is primarily\nfocused upon “defenseless susceptibility to interference, rather\nthan actual interference” (Pettit, 1996: 577). Thus, in contrast\nto the ordinary negative conception, on the republican conception the\nmere possibility of arbitrary interference is a limitation of\nliberty. Republican liberty thus seems to involve a modal claim about\nthe possibility of interference, and this is often cashed out in terms\nof complex counterfactual claims. It is not clear whether these claims\ncan be adequately explicated (Gaus, 2003; cf. Larmore, 2004). \n\nSome republican theorists, such as Quentin Skinner (1998: 113),\nMaurizio Viroli (2002: 6) and Pettit (1997: 8–11), view republicanism\nas an alternative to liberalism. When republican liberty is seen\nas a basis for criticizing market liberty and market society, this is\nplausible (Gaus, 2003b). However, when liberalism is understood more\nexpansively, and not so closely tied to either negative liberty or\nmarket society, republicanism becomes indistinguishable from\nliberalism (Ghosh, 2008; Rogers, 2008; Larmore, 2001; Dagger,\n1997). \n\nLiberal political theory, then, fractures over the conception of\nliberty. In practice, another crucial fault line concerns the moral\nstatus of private property and the market order. For classical\nliberals — ‘old’ liberals — liberty and\nprivate property are intimately related. From the eighteenth century\nright up to today, classical liberals have insisted that an economic\nsystem based on private property is uniquely consistent with\nindividual liberty, allowing each to live her life —including\nemploying her labor and her capital — as she sees fit. Indeed,\nclassical liberals and libertarians have often asserted that in some\nway liberty and property are really the same thing; it has been\nargued, for example, that all rights, including liberty rights, are\nforms of property; others have maintained that property is itself a\nform of freedom (Gaus, 1994; Steiner, 1994). A market order based on\nprivate property is thus seen as an embodiment of freedom\n(Robbins, 1961: 104). Unless people are free to make contracts and\nsell their labour, save and invest their incomes as they see fit, and\nfree to launch enterprises as they raise the capital, they are not\nreally free. \n\nClassical liberals employ a second argument connecting liberty and\nprivate property. Rather than insisting that the freedom to obtain and\nemploy private property is simply one aspect of people’s\nliberty, this second argument insists that private property\neffectively protects liberty, and no protection can be effective\nwithout private property. Here the idea is that the dispersion of\npower that results from a free market economy based on private\nproperty protects the liberty of subjects against encroachments by the\nstate. As F.A. Hayek argues, “There can be no freedom of press\nif the instruments of printing are under government control, no\nfreedom of assembly if the needed rooms are so controlled, no freedom\nof movement if the means of transport are a government monopoly”\n(1978: 149). \n\nAlthough classical liberals agree on the fundamental importance of\nprivate property to a free society, the classical liberal tradition\nitself is a spectrum of views, from near-anarchist to those that\nattribute a significant role to the state in economic and social\npolicy (on this spectrum, see Mack and Gaus, 2004). Towards the\nextreme ‘libertarian’ end of the classical liberal\nspectrum are views of justified states as legitimate monopolies that\nmay with justice charge for essential rights-protection services:\ntaxation is legitimate if necessary and sufficient for effective\nprotection of liberty and property. Further ‘leftward’ we\nencounter classical liberal views that allow taxation for public\neducation in particular, and more generally for public goods and\nsocial infrastructure. Moving yet further ‘left’, some\nclassical liberal views allow for a modest social minimum.(e.g.,\nHayek, 1976: 87). Most nineteenth century classical liberal economists\nendorsed a variety of state policies, encompassing not only the\ncriminal law and enforcement of contracts, but the licensing of\nprofessionals, health, safety and fire regulations, banking\nregulations, commercial infrastructure (roads, harbors and canals) and\noften encouraged unionization (Gaus, 1983b). Although classical\nliberalism today often is associated with libertarianism, the broader\nclassical liberal tradition was centrally concerned with bettering the\nlot of the working class, women, blacks, immigrants, and so on. The\naim, as Bentham put it, was to make the poor richer, not the rich\npoorer (Bentham, 1952 [1795]: vol. 1, 226n). Consequently, classical\nliberals treat the leveling of wealth and income as outside the\npurview of legitimate aims of government coercion. \n\nWhat has come to be known as ‘new’,\n‘revisionist’, ‘welfare state’, or perhaps\nbest, ‘social justice’, liberalism challenges this\nintimate connection between personal liberty and a private property\nbased market order (Freeden, 1978; Gaus, 1983b; Paul, Miller and Paul,\n2007). Three factors help explain the rise of this revisionist\ntheory. First, the new liberalism arose in the late nineteenth and\nearly twentieth centuries, a period in which the ability of a free\nmarket to sustain what Lord Beveridge (1944: 96) called a\n‘prosperous equilibrium’ was being questioned. Believing\nthat a private property based market tended to be unstable, or could,\nas Keynes argued (1973 [1936]), get stuck in an equilibrium with high\nunemployment, new liberals came to doubt, initially in empirical\ngrounds, that classical liberalism was an adequate foundation for a\nstable, free society. Here the second factor comes into play: just as\nthe new liberals were losing faith in the market, their faith in\ngovernment as a means of supervising economic life was\nincreasing. This was partly due to the experiences of the First World\nWar, in which government attempts at economic planning seemed to\nsucceed (Dewey, 1929: 551–60); more importantly, this reevaluation of\nthe state was spurred by the democratization of western states, and\nthe conviction that, for the first time, elected officials could truly\nbe, in J.A. Hobson’s phrase ‘representatives of the\ncommunity’ (1922: 49). As D.G. Ritchie proclaimed: \n\nThe third factor underlying the currency of the new liberalism was\nprobably the most fundamental: a growing conviction that, so far from\nbeing ‘the guardian of every other right’ (Ely, 1992: 26),\nproperty rights foster an unjust inequality of power. They entrench a\nmerely formal equality that in actual practice systematically fails to\nsecure the kind of equal positive liberty that matters on the ground\nfor the working class. This theme is central to what is now called\n‘liberalism’ in American politics, combining a strong\nendorsement of civil and personal liberties with indifference or even\nhostility to private ownership. The seeds of this newer liberalism can\nbe found in Mill’s On Liberty. Although Mill insisted\nthat the ‘so-called doctrine of Free Trade’ rested on\n‘equally solid’ grounds as did the ‘principle of\nindividual liberty’ (1963, vol. 18: 293), he nevertheless\ninsisted that the justifications of personal and economic liberty were\ndistinct. And in his\nPrinciples of Political Economy Mill consistently emphasized\nthat it is an open question whether personal liberty can flourish\nwithout private property (1963, vol. 2; 203–210), a view that Rawls\nwas to reassert over a century later (2001: Part IV). \n\nOne consequence of Rawls’s great work, A Theory of\nJustice (1999 [first published in 1971]) is that the ‘new\nliberalism’ has become focused on developing a theory of social\njustice. Since the 1960s when Rawls began to publish the elements of\nhis emerging theory, liberal political philosophers have analyzed, and\ndisputed, his famous ‘difference principle’ according to\nwhich a just basic structure of society arranges social and economic\ninequalities such that they are to the greatest advantage of the least\nwell off representative group (1999b:266). For Rawls, the default is\nan equal distribution of (basically) income and wealth; only\ninequalities that best enhance the long-term prospects of the least\nadvantaged are just. As Rawls sees it, the difference principle\nconstitutes a public recognition of the principle of reciprocity: the\nbasic structure is to be arranged such that no social group advances\nat the cost of another (2001: 122–24). Many followers of Rawls have\nfocused less on the ideal of reciprocity than on the commitment to\nequality (Dworkin, 2000). Indeed, what was previously called\n‘welfare state’ liberalism is now often described as\nliberal egalitarianism. However, see Jan Narveson’s essay on\nHobbes’s seeming defense of the welfare state (in Courtland\n2018) for historical reflections on the difference). \nAnd in one way that is especially appropriate: in his later work Rawls\ninsists that welfare-state capitalism does not constitute a just basic\nstructure (2001: 137–38). If some version of capitalism is to be just\nit must be a ‘property owning democracy’ with a wide\ndiffusion of ownership; a market socialist regime, in Rawls’s\nview, is more just than welfare-state capitalism (2001: 135-38). Not\ntoo surprisingly, classical liberals such as Hayek (1976) insist that\nthe contemporary liberal fixation on ‘the mirage of social\njustice’ leads modern liberals to ignore the extent to which, as\na matter of historical observation, freedom depends on a decentralized\nmarket based on private property, the overall results of which are\nunpredictable. \nThus, Robert Nozick (1974: 160ff) famously classifies Rawls’s\ndifference principle as patterned but not historical: prescribing a\ndistribution while putting no moral weight on who produced the goods\nbeing distributed. One stark difference that emerges from this is that\nnew liberalism’s theory of justice is a theory about how to treat the\npie while old liberalism’s theory of justice is a theory about how to\ntreat bakers (Schmidtz, 2017: 231).  \nThe problem with patterned principles is that, in Nozick’s words,\nliberty upsets patterns.  “No end-state principle or distributional\npatterned principle of justice can be continuously realized without\ncontinuous interference with people’s lives.” To illustrate, Nozick\nasks you to imagine that society achieves a pattern of perfect justice\nby the lights of whatever principle you prefer. Then someone offers\nWilt Chamberlain a dollar for the privilege of watching Wilt play\nbasketball. Before we know it, thousands of people are paying Wilt a\ndollar each, every time Wilt puts on a show. Wilt gets rich. The\ndistribution is no longer equal, and no one complains. Nozick’s\nquestion: If justice is a pattern, achievable at a given moment, what\nhappens if you achieve perfection? Must you then prohibit\neverything—no further consuming, creating, trading, or\neven giving—so as not to upset the perfect pattern?\nNotice: Nozick neither argues nor presumes people can do whatever they\nwant with their property. Nozick, recalling the focus on connecting\nproperty rights to liberty that animated liberalism in its classical\nform, notes that if there is anything at all people can do,\neven if the only thing they are free to do is give a coin to an\nentertainer, then even that tiniest of liberties will, over time,\ndisturb the favored pattern. Nozick is right that if we focus on time\nslices, we focus on isolated moments, and take moments too seriously,\nwhen what matters is not the pattern of holdings at a moment but the\npattern of how people treat each other over time.  Even tiny liberties\nmust upset the pattern of a static moment. By the same token, however,\nthere is no reason why liberty must upset an ongoing pattern of fair\ntreatment. A moral principle forbidding racial discrimination, for\nexample, prescribes no particular end-state.  Such a principle is what\nNozick calls weakly patterned, sensitive to history as well as to\npattern, and prescribing an ideal of how people should be treated\nwithout prescribing an end-state distribution. It affects the\npattern without prescribing a pattern.  And if a principle\nforbidding racial discrimination works its way into a society via\ncultural progress rather than legal intervention, it need not involve\nany interference whatsoever. So, although Nozick sometimes speaks as\nif his critique applies to all patterns, we should take seriously his\nconcession that “weak” patterns are compatible with liberty.  Some may\npromote liberty, depending on how they are introduced and\nmaintained. See Schmidtz and Brennan (2010: chap.6). For work by\nmodern liberals that resonates with Nozick’s dissection of the\ndimensions of equality that plausibly can count as liberal, see also\nAnderson (1999), Young (1990), and Sen (1992).  \nAccordingly, even granting to Nozick that time-slice principles\nlicense immense, constant, intolerable interference with everyday\nlife, there is some reason to doubt that Rawls intended to embrace any\nsuch view.  In his first article, Rawls said, “we cannot determine the\njustness of a situation by examining it at a single moment.” Years\nlater, Rawls added, “It is a mistake to focus attention on the varying\nrelative positions of individuals and to require that every change,\nconsidered as a single transaction viewed in isolation, be in itself\njust.  It is the arrangement of the basic structure which is to be\njudged, and judged from a general point of view.” Thus, to Rawls,\nbasic structure’s job is not to make every transaction work to the\nworking class’s advantage, let alone to the advantage of each member\nof the class.  Rawls was more realistic than that.  Instead, it is the\ntrend of a whole society over time that is supposed to benefit the\nworking class as a class.  To be sure, Rawls was a kind of\negalitarian, but the pattern Rawls meant to endorse was a pattern of\nequal status, applying not so much to a distribution as to an ongoing\nrelationship. This is not to say that Nozick’s critique had no\npoint. Nozick showed what an alternative theory might look like,\nportraying Wilt Chamberlain as a separate person in a more robust\nsense (unencumbered by nebulous debts to society) than Rawls could\ncountenance. To Nozick, Wilt’s advantages are not what\nWilt finds on the table; Wilt’s advantages are what\nWilt brings to the table.  And respecting what Wilt brings to\nthe table is the exact essence of respecting him as a separate\nperson. In part due to Nozick, today’s egalitarians now acknowledge\nthat any equality worthy of aspiration will focus less on justice as a\nproperty of a time-slice distribution and more on how people are\ntreated: how they are rewarded for their contributions\nand enabled over time to make contributions worth\nrewarding. (Schmidtz and Brennan, 2010: chap.6). \n\nAs his work evolved, Rawls (1996: 5ff) insisted that his liberalism\nwas not a ‘comprehensive’ doctrine, that is, one which\nincludes an overall theory of value, an ethical theory, an\nepistemology, or a controversial metaphysics of the person and\nsociety. Our modern societies, characterized by a ‘reasonable\npluralism’, are already filled with such doctrines. The aim of\n‘political liberalism’ is not to add yet another sectarian\ndoctrine, but to provide a political framework that is neutral between\nsuch controversial comprehensive doctrines (Larmore, 1996: 121ff). If\nit is to serve as the basis for public reasoning in our diverse\nwestern societies, liberalism must be restricted to a core set of\npolitical principles that are, or can be, the subject of consensus\namong all reasonable citizens. Rawls’s notion of a purely political\nconception of liberalism seems more austere than the traditional\nliberal political theories discussed above, being largely restricted\nto constitutional principles upholding basic civil liberties and the\ndemocratic process. \n\nAs Gaus (2004) has argued, the distinction between\n‘political’ and ‘comprehensive’ liberalism\nmisses a great deal. Liberal theories form a broad continuum, from\nthose that constitute full-blown philosophical systems, to those that\nrely on a full theory of value and the good, to those that rely on a\ntheory of the right (but not the good), all the way to those that seek\nto be purely political doctrines. Nevertheless, it is important to\nappreciate that, though liberalism is primarily a political theory, it\nhas been associated with broader theories of ethics, value, and\nsociety. Indeed, many believe that liberalism cannot rid itself of all\ncontroversial metaphysical (Hampton, 1989) or epistemological (Raz,\n1990) commitments. \n\nFollowing Wilhelm von Humboldt (1993 [1854]), in On Liberty\nMill argues that one basis for endorsing freedom (Mill\nbelieves there are many), is the goodness of developing individuality\nand cultivating capacities: \n\nThis is not just a theory about politics: it is a substantive,\nperfectionist, moral theory about the good. On this view, the\nright thing to do is to promote development or perfection, but only a\nregime securing extensive liberty for each person can accomplish this\n(Wall, 1998). This moral ideal of human perfection and development\ndominated liberal thinking in the latter part of the nineteenth century, and\nmuch of the twentieth: not only Mill, but T.H. Green,\nL.T. Hobhouse, Bernard Bosanquet, John Dewey and even Rawls show\nallegiance to variants of this perfectionist ethic and the claim that\nit provides a foundation for endorsing a regime of liberal rights\n(Gaus, 1983a). And it is fundamental to the proponents of liberal\nautonomy discussed above, as well as ‘liberal virtue’\ntheorists such as William Galston (1980).  That the good life is\nnecessarily a freely chosen one in which a person develops his unique\ncapacities as part of a plan of life is probably the dominant liberal\nethic of the past century. \n\nThe main challenge to Millian perfectionism’s status as the\ndistinctly liberal ethic comes from moral contractualism, which can be\ndivided into what might very roughly be labeled ‘Kantian’\nand ‘Hobbesian’ versions. According to Kantian\ncontractualism, “society, being composed of a plurality of\npersons, each with his own aims, interests, and conceptions of the\ngood, is best arranged when it is governed by principles that do\nnot themselves presuppose any particular conception of the\ngood…” (Sandel, 1982: 1). On this view, respect for the\npersonhood of others demands that we refrain from imposing our view of\nthe good life on them. Only principles that can be justified to all\nrespect the personhood of each. We thus witness the tendency of recent\nliberal theory (Reiman, 1990; Scanlon, 1998) to transform the social\ncontract from an account of the state to an overall justification of\nmorality, or at least a social morality. Basic to such ‘Kantian\ncontractualism’ is the idea that suitably idealized individuals\nare motivated not by the pursuit of gain, but by a commitment or\ndesire to\n publicly justify\n the claims they\nmake on others (Reiman, 1990; Scanlon, 1982). A moral code\nthat could be the object of agreement among such individuals is\nthus a publicly justified morality. \n\nIn contrast, distinctively Hobbesian contractualism supposes only\nthat individuals are self-interested and correctly perceive that each\nperson’s ability to effectively pursue her interests is enhanced by a\nframework of norms that structure social life and divide the fruits of\nsocial cooperation (Gauither, 1986; Hampton, 1986; Kavka,\n1986). Morality, then, is a common framework that advances the\nself-interest of each. The claim of Hobbesian contractualism to be a\ndistinctly liberal conception of morality stems from the importance of\nindividual freedom and property in such a common framework: only\nsystems of norms that allow each person great freedom to pursue her\ninterests as she sees fit could, it is argued, be the object of\nconsensus among self-interested agents (Courtland, 2008; Gaus 2003a:\nchap. 3; Gaus, 2012; Ridge, 1998; Gauthier, 1995). The continuing problem for\nHobbesian contractualism is the apparent rationality of free-riding:\nif everyone (or enough) complies with the terms of the contract, and\nso social order is achieved, it would seem rational to defect, and act\nimmorally when one can gain by doing so. This is essentially the\nargument of Hobbes’s ‘Foole’, and from Hobbes (1948\n[1651]: 94ff) to Gauthier (1986: 160ff), Hobbesians have tried to\nreply to it. \n\nTurning from rightness to goodness, we can identify three main\ncandidates for a liberal theory of value. We have already encountered\nthe first: perfectionism. Insofar as perfectionism is a theory of\nright action, it can be understood as an account of\nmorality. Obviously, however, it is an account of rightness that\npresupposes a theory of value or the good: the ultimate human value is\ndeveloped personality or an autonomous life. Competing with this\nobjectivist theory of value are two other liberal accounts: pluralism\nand subjectivism. \n\nIn his famous defence of negative liberty, Berlin insisted that values\nor ends are plural, and no interpersonally justifiable ranking among\nthese many ends is to be had. More than that, Berlin maintained that\nthe pursuit of one end necessarily implies that other ends will not be\nachieved. In this sense ends collide. In economic terms, the pursuit\nof one end entails opportunity costs: foregone pursuits which cannot\nbe impersonally shown to be less worthy. There is no interpersonally\njustifiable way to rank the ends, and no way to achieve them all. Each\nperson must devote herself to some ends at the cost of ignoring\nothers. For the pluralist, then, autonomy, perfection or development\nare not necessarily ranked higher than hedonistic pleasures,\nenvironmental preservation or economic equality. All compete for our\nallegiance, but because they are incommensurable, no choice can be\ninterpersonally justified. \n\nThe pluralist is not a subjectivist: that values are many, competing\nand incommensurable does not imply that they are somehow dependent on\nsubjective experiences. But the claim that what a person values rests\non experiences that vary from person to person has long been a part of\nthe liberal tradition. To Hobbes, what one values depends on what one\ndesires (1948 [1651]: 48). Locke advances a ‘taste theory of\nvalue’: \n\nThe perfectionist, the pluralist and the subjectivist concur on the\ncrucial point: the nature of value is such that reasonable people\npursue different ways of living. To the perfectionist, this is because\neach person has unique capacities, the development of which confers\nvalue on her life; to the pluralist, it is because values are many and\nconflicting, and no one life can include them all, or make the\ninterpersonally correct choice among them; and to the subjectivist, it\nis because our ideas about what is valuable stem from our desires or\ntastes, and these differ from one individual to another. All three\nviews, then, defend the basic liberal idea that people rationally\nfollow different ways of living. But in themselves, such notions of\nthe good are not full-fledged liberal ethics, for an additional\nargument is required linking liberal value with norms of equal\nliberty, and to the idea that other people command a certain respect\nand a certain deference simply by virtue of having values of their\nown. To be sure, Berlin seems to believe this is a very quick\nargument: the inherent plurality of ends points to\nthe political preeminence of liberty (see, for example, Gray:\n2006). Guaranteeing each a measure of negative liberty is, Berlin\nargues, the most humane ideal, as it recognizes that ‘human\ngoals are many’, and no one can make a choice that is right for\nall people (1969: 171). It is here that subjectivists and pluralists\nalike sometimes rely on versions of moral contractualism. Those who\ninsist that liberalism is ultimately nihilistic can be interpreted as\narguing that this transition cannot be made successfully: liberals, on\ntheir view, are stuck with a subjectivistic or pluralistic theory of\nvalue, and no account of the right emerges from it. \n\nThroughout the last century, liberalism has been beset by\ncontroversies between, on the one hand, those broadly identified as\n‘individualists’ and, on the other,\n‘collectivists’, ‘communitarians’ or\n‘organicists’ (for skepticism about this, though, see\nBird, 1999).  These vague and sweeping designations have been applied\nto a wide array of disputes; we focus here on controversies concerning\n(i) the nature of society; (ii) the nature of the self. \n\nLiberalism is, of course, usually associated with individualist\nanalyses of society.  ‘Human beings in society’, Mill\nclaimed, ‘have no properties but those which are derived from,\nand which may be resolved into, the laws of the nature of individual\nmen’ (1963, Vol. 8: 879; see also Bentham: 1970 [1823]: chap. I,\nsec. 4). Herbert Spencer agreed: “the properties of the mass are\ndependent upon the attributes of its component parts” (1995\n[1851]: 1).  In the last years of the nineteenth century this\nindividualist view was increasingly subject to attack, especially by\nthose who were influenced by idealist philosophy.  D. G.  Ritche,\ncriticizing Spencer’s individualist liberalism, denies that\nsociety is simply a ‘heap’ of individuals, insisting that\nit is more akin to an organism, with a complex internal life (1896:\n13).  Liberals such as L. T. Hobhouse and Dewey refused to adopt\nradically collectivist views such as those advocated by Bernard\nBosanquet (2001), but they too rejected the radical individualism of\nBentham, Mill and Spencer.  Throughout most of the first half of the\ntwentieth century such ‘organic’ analyses of society held\nsway in liberal theory, even in economics (see A.F Mummery and\nJ. A. Hobson, 1956: 106; J.M. Keynes, 1972: 275).  \n\nDuring and after the Second World War the idea that liberalism was\nbased on inherently individualist analysis of humans-in-society arose\nagain. Karl Popper’s The Open Society and its Enemies (1945)\npresented a sustained critique of Hegelian and Marxist theory and its\ncollectivist and historicist, and to Popper, inherently illiberal,\nunderstanding of society.  The reemergence of economic analysis in\nliberal theory brought to the fore a thoroughgoing methodological\nindividualism.  Writing in the early 1960s, James Buchanan and Gordon\nTullock adamantly defended the ‘individualistic postulate’\nagainst all forms of ‘organicism’: “This\n[organicist] approach or theory of the collectivity….is essentially\nopposed to the Western philosophical tradition in which the human\nindividual is the primary philosophical entity” (1965:\n11–12). Human beings, insisted Buchanan and Tullock, are the only real\nchoosers and decision-makers, and their preferences determine both\npublic and private actions.  The renascent individualism of\nlate-twentieth century liberalism was closely bound up with the\ninduction of Hobbes as a member of the liberal pantheon.  Hobbes’s\nrelentlessly individualistic account of society, and the manner in\nwhich his analysis of the state of nature lent itself to\ngame-theoretical modeling, yielded a highly individualist, formal\nanalysis of the liberal state and liberal morality. \n\nOf course, as is widely known, the last twenty-five years have\nwitnessed a renewed interest in collectivist analyses of liberal\nsociety —though the term ‘collectivist’ is abjured\nin favor of ‘communitarian’.  Writing in 1985, Amy Gutmann\nobserved that “we are witnessing a revival of communitarian\ncriticisms of liberal political theory. Like the critics of the 1960s,\nthose of the 1980s fault liberalism for being mistakenly and\nirreparably individualistic” (1985: 308).  Starting with Michael\nSandel’s (1982) famous criticism of Rawls, a number of critics charge\nthat liberalism is necessarily premised on an abstract conception of\nindividual selves as pure choosers, whose commitments, values and\nconcerns are possessions of the self, but never constitute the self.\nAlthough the ‘liberal-communitarian’ debate ultimately involved\nwide-ranging moral, political and sociological disputes about the\nnature of communities, and the rights and responsibilities of their\nmembers, the heart of the debate was about the nature of liberal\nselves. For Sandel the flaw at the heart of Rawls’s liberalism is its\nimplausibly abstract theory of the self, the pure autonomous chooser.\nRawls, he charges, ultimately assumes that it makes sense to identify\nus with a pure capacity for choice, and that such pure choosers might\nreject any or all of their attachments and values and yet retain their\nidentity.  \n\nFrom the mid-1980s onwards various liberals sought to show how\nliberalism may consistently advocate a theory of the self which finds\nroom for cultural membership and other non-chosen attachments and\ncommitments which at least partially constitute the self (Kymlicka,\n1989). Much of liberal theory has became focused on the issue as to\nhow we can be social creatures, members of cultures and raised in\nvarious traditions, while also being autonomous choosers who employ\nour liberty to construct lives of our own. \n\nIn On Liberty Mill argued that “Liberty, as a\nprinciple, has no application to any state of things anterior to the\ntime when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and\nequal discussion” (1963, vol. 18: 224). Thus “Despotism is\na legitimate form of government in dealing with barbarians, provided\nthe end be their improvement…” (1963, vol. 18: 224). This\npassage — infused with the spirit of nineteenth century\nimperialism (and perhaps, as some maintain, latent racism) — is\noften ignored by defenders of Mill as an embarrassment (Parekh, 1994;\nParekh, 1995; Mehta, 1999; Pitts, 2005).This is not to say that such\nMillian passages are without thoughtful defenders. See, for example,\nInder Marawah (2011). Nevertheless, it raises a question that still\ndivides liberals: are liberal political principles justified for all\npolitical communities? In The Law of Peoples Rawls argues\nthat they are not. According to Rawls there can be a ‘decent\nhierarchical society’ which is not based on the liberal\nconception of all persons as free and equal, but instead views persons\nas “responsible and cooperating members of their respective\ngroups” but not inherently equal (1999a: 66).  Given this, the\nfull liberal conception of justice cannot be constructed out of shared\nideas of this ‘people’, though basic human rights,\nimplicit in the very idea of a social cooperative structure, apply to\nall peoples. David Miller (2002) develops a different defense of this\nanti-universalistic position, while those such as Thomas Pogge (2002:\nch. 4) and Martha Nussbaum (2002) reject Rawls’s position,\ninstead advocating versions of moral universalism: they claim that\nliberal moral principles apply to all states. \n\nThe debate about whether liberal principles apply to all political\ncommunities should not be confused with the debate as to whether\nliberalism is a state-centered theory, or whether, at least ideally,\nit is a cosmopolitan political theory for the community of all\nhumankind. Immanuel Kant — a moral universalist if ever there\nwas one — argued that all states should respect the dignity of\ntheir citizens as free and equal persons, yet denied that humanity\nforms one political community. Thus he rejected the ideal of a\nuniversal cosmopolitan liberal political community in favor of a world\nof states, all with internally just constitutions, and united in a\nconfederation to assure peace (1970 [1795]). \n\nOn a classical liberal theory, the difference between a world of\nliberal communities and a world liberal community is not of\nfundamental importance. Since the aim of government in a community is\nto assure the basic liberty and property rights of its citizens,\nborders are not of great moral significance in classical liberalism\n(Lomasky, 2007). In contrast under the\n‘new’ liberalism, which stresses redistributive programs\nto achieve social justice, it matters a great deal who is included\nwithin the political or moral community. If liberal principles require\nsignificant redistribution, then it is crucially important whether\nthese principles apply only within particular communities, or whether\ntheir reach is global. Thus a fundamental debate between Rawls and\nmany of his followers is whether the difference principle should only\nbe applied within a liberal state such as the United States (where the\nleast well off are the least well off Americans), or whether it should\nbe applied globally (where the least well off are the least well off\nin the world) (Rawls, 1999a: 113ff; Beitz, 1973: 143ff; Pogge, 1989:\nPart Three). \n\nLiberal political theory also fractures concerning the appropriate\nresponse to groups (cultural, religious, etc.) which endorse illiberal\npolicies and values. These groups may deny education to some of their\nmembers, advocate female genital mutilation, restrict religious\nfreedom, maintain an inequitable caste system, and so on. When, if\never, should a liberal group interfere with the\ninternal governance of an illiberal group?  \n\nSuppose first that the illiberal group is another political community\nor state. Can liberals intervene in the affairs of non-liberal states?\nMill provides a complicated answer in his 1859 essay ‘A Few\nWords on Non-Intervention’. Reiterating his claim from On\nLiberty that civilized and non-civilized countries are to be\ntreated differently, he insists that “barbarians have no rights\nas a nation, except a right to such treatment as may, at the\nearliest possible period, fit them for becoming one. The only moral\nlaws for the relation between a civilized and a barbarous government,\nare the universal rules of morality between man and man” (1963,\nvol. 21: 119). Although this strikes us today as simply a case for an\nobjectionable paternalistic imperialism (and it certainly was such a\ncase), Mill’s argument for the conclusion is more complex, including a\nclaim that, since international morality depends on reciprocity,\n‘barbarous’ governments that cannot be counted on to\nengage in reciprocal behavior have no rights qua\ngovernments. In any event, when Mill turns to interventions among\n‘civilized’ peoples he develops an altogether more\nsophisticated account as to when one state can intervene in the\naffairs of another to protect liberal principles. Here Mill is\ngenerally against intervention. “The reason is, that there can\nseldom be anything approaching to assurance that intervention, even if\nsuccessful, would be for the good of the people themselves. The only\ntest possessing any real value, of a people’s having become fit for\npopular institutions, is that they, or a sufficient proportion of them\nto prevail in the contest, are willing to brave labour and danger for\ntheir liberation” (1963, vol. 21: 122). \n\nIn addition to questions of efficacy, to the extent that peoples or\ngroups have rights to collective self-determination, intervention by a\nliberal group to induce a non-liberal community to adopt liberal\nprinciples will be morally objectionable. As with individuals,\nliberals may think that peoples or groups have freedom to make\nmistakes in managing their collective affairs. If people’s\nself-conceptions are based on their participation in such groups, even\nthose whose liberties are denied may object to, and perhaps in some\nway harmed by, the imposition of liberal principles (Margalit and Raz,\n1990; Tamir, 1993). Thus rather than proposing a doctrine of\nintervention many liberals propose various principles of\ntoleration which specify to what extent liberals must tolerate\nnon-liberal peoples and cultures. As is usual, Rawls’s discussion is\nsubtle and enlightening. In his account of the foreign affairs of\nliberal peoples, Rawls argues that liberal peoples must distinguish\n‘decent’ non-liberal societies from ‘outlaw’\nand other states; the former have a claim on liberal peoples to\ntolerance while the latter do not (1999a: 59–61). Decent peoples,\nargues Rawls, ‘simply do not tolerate’ outlaw states which\nignore human rights: such states may be subject to ‘forceful\nsanctions and even to intervention’ (1999a: 81). In contrast,\nRawls insists that “liberal peoples must try to encourage\n[non-liberal] decent peoples and not frustrate their vitality by\ncoercively insisting that all societies be liberal” (1999a:\n62). Chandran Kukathas (2003) — whose liberalism derives from\nthe classical tradition — is inclined to almost complete\ntoleration of non-liberal peoples, with the non-trivial proviso that there must be\nexit rights. \n\nThe status of non-liberal groups within liberal societies has\nincreasingly become a subject of debate, especially with respect to\nsome citizens of faith.  We should distinguish two questions: (i) to\nwhat extent should non-liberal cultural and religious communities be\nexempt from the requirements of the liberal state? and, (ii) to what\nextent can they be allowed to participate in decision-making in the\nliberal state? \n\nTurning to (i), liberalism has a long history of seeking to\naccommodate religious groups that have deep objections to certain\npublic policies, such as the Quakers, Mennonites or Sikhs. The most\ndifficult issues in this regard arise in relation to children and\neducation (see Galston, 2003; Fowler, 2010; Andersson, 2011) Mill, for\nexample, writes: \nOver the last thirty years, there has been a particular case that is\nat the core of this debate — Wisconsin vs. Yoder: [406\nU.S. 205 (1972)].  In this case, the United States Supreme Court\nupheld the right of Amish parents to avoid compulsory schooling laws\nand remove their children from school at the age of 14 — thus,\naccording to the Amish, avoiding secular influences that might\nundermine the traditional Amish way of life. Because cultural and\nreligious communities raise and educate children, they cannot be seen\nas purely voluntary opt-outs from the liberal state: they exercise\ncoercive power over children, and so basic liberal principles about\nprotecting the innocent from unjustified coercion come into play. Some\nhave maintained that liberal principles require that the state should\nintervene (against groups like the Amish) in order to [1] provide the\nchildren with an effective right of exit that would otherwise be\ndenied via a lack of education (Okin, 2002), [2] to protect the\nchildren’s right to an autonomous and ‘open future’\n(Feinberg, 1980) and/or [3] to insure that children will have the\ncognitive tools to prepare them for their future role as citizens\n(Galston, 1995: p. 529; Macedo, 1995: pp. 285–6). Other liberal\ntheorists, on the other hand, have argued that the state should not\nintervene because it might undermine the inculcation of certain values\nthat are necessary for the continued existence of certain\ncomprehensive doctrines (Galston, 1995: p. 533; Stolzenberg, 1993: pp.\n582–3). Moreover, some such as Harry Brighouse (1998) have argued that\nthe inculcation of liberal values through compulsory education might\nundermine the legitimacy of liberal states because children would not\n(due to possible indoctrination) be free to consent to such\ninstitutions. \n \nQuestion (ii) — the extent to which non-liberal beliefs and\nvalues may be employed in liberal political discussion— has\nbecome the subject of sustained debate in the years following Rawls’s\nPolitical Liberalism. According to Rawls’s liberalism —\nand what we might call ‘public reason liberalism’ more\ngenerally — because our societies are characterized by\n‘reasonable pluralism’, coercion cannot be justified on\nthe basis of comprehensive moral or religious systems of belief. But\nmany friends of religion (e.g., Eberle, 2002; Perry, 1993) argue that\nthis is objectionably ‘exclusionary’: conscientious\nbelievers are barred from voting on their deepest convictions. Again\nliberals diverge in their responses. Some such as Stephen Macedo take\na pretty hard-nosed attitude: ‘if some people…feel\n“silenced” or “marginalized” by the fact that\nsome of us believe that it is wrong to shape basic liberties on the\nbasis of religious or metaphysical claims, I can only say “grow\nup!”’ (2000: 35). Rawls, in contrast, seeks to be more\naccommodating, allowing that arguments based on religious\ncomprehensive doctrines may enter into liberal politics on issues of\nbasic justice “provided that, in due course, we give properly\npublic reasons to support the principles and policies that our\ncomprehensive doctrine is said to support” (1999a: 144). Thus\nRawls allows the legitimacy of religious-based arguments against\nslavery and in favor of the United States civil rights movement,\nbecause ultimately such arguments were supported by public reasons.\nOthers (e.g., Greenawalt, 1995) hold that even this is too\nrestrictive: it is difficult for liberals to justify a moral\nprohibition on a religious citizen from voicing her view in liberal\npolitical debate. Gaus and Vallier seek to ameliorate such tensions,\nin part, by acknowledging an asymmetry between the ‘reasons\nto justify to another a law’ and the ‘reasons\nto reject’ a law (2009: 54). They argue that although\n“a secular rationale is necessary in our society for a publicly\njustified law, it can be defeated by a reasonable religious conviction\nwithout secular backing” (2009: 63). Thus, citizens of faith\nwould be able to preserve their religious integrity, all the while\nremaining unable to coerce others via unshared religious reasons. \n\nGiven that liberalism fractures on so many issues — the nature\nof liberty, the place of property and democracy in a just society, the\ncomprehensiveness and the reach of the liberal ideal — one might\nwonder whether there is any point in talking of\n‘liberalism’ at all. It is not, though, an unimportant or\ntrivial thing that all these theories take liberty to be the grounding\npolitical value. Radical democrats assert the overriding value of\nequality, communitarians maintain that the demands of belongingness\ntrump freedom, and conservatives complain that the liberal devotion to\nfreedom undermines traditional values and virtues and so social order\nitself. Intramural disputes aside, liberals join in rejecting these\nconceptions of political right.","contact.mail":"dschmidtz01@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
