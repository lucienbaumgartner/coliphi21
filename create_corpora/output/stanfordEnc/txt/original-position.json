The original position\nis designed to be a fair and impartial point of view that is to be\nadopted in our reasoning about fundamental principles of justice. In\ntaking up this point of view, we are to imagine ourselves in the\nposition of free and equal persons who jointly agree upon and commit\nthemselves to principles of social and political justice. The main\ndistinguishing feature of the original position is “the veil of\nignorance”: to insure impartiality of judgment, the parties are\ndeprived of all knowledge of their personal characteristics and social\nand historical circumstances. They do know of certain fundamental\ninterests they all have, plus general facts about psychology,\neconomics, biology, and other social and natural sciences. The parties\nin the original position are presented with a list of the main\nconceptions of justice drawn from the tradition of social and\npolitical philosophy, and are assigned the task of choosing from among\nthese alternatives the conception of justice that best advances their\ninterests in establishing conditions that enable them to effectively\npursue their final ends and fundamental interests. Rawls contends that\nthe most rational choice for the parties in the original position are\ntwo principles of justice: The first guarantees the equal basic rights\nand liberties needed to secure the fundamental interests of free and\nequal citizens and to pursue a wide range of conceptions of the good.\nThe second principle provides fair equality of educational and\nemployment opportunities enabling all to fairly compete for powers and\npositions of office; and it secures for all a guaranteed minimum of\nthe all-purpose means (including income and wealth) that individuals\nneed to pursue their interests and to maintain their self-respect as\nfree and equal persons.\n\nThe idea of the moral point of view can be traced back to David\nHume’s account of the “judicious spectator.” Hume\nsought to explain how moral judgments of approval and disapproval are\npossible given that people normally are focused on achieving their\nparticular interests and concerns. He conjectured that in making moral\njudgments individuals abstract in imagination from their own\nparticular interests and adopt an impartial point of view from which\nthey assess the effects of their own and others’ actions on the\ninterests of everyone. Since, according to Hume, we all can adopt this\nimpartial perspective in imagination, it accounts for our agreement in\nmoral judgments (see Hume 1739 [1978, 581]; Rawls, LHMP 84–93,\nLHPP 184–187). \nSubsequently, philosophers posited similar perspectives for moral\nreasoning designed to yield impartial judgments once individuals\nabstract from their particular aims and interests and assess\nsituations from an impartial point of view. But rather than being\nmainly explanatory of moral judgments like Hume’s\n“judicious spectator,” the role of these impartial\nperspectives is to serve as a basis from which to assess and justify\nmoral rules and principles. Kant’s categorical imperative\nprocedure, Adam Smith’s “impartial spectator,”, and\nSidgwick’s “point of view of the universe” are all\ndifferent versions of the moral point of view.  \nAn important feature of the moral point of view is that it is designed\nto represent what is essential to the activity of moral reasoning. For\nexample, Kant’s categorical imperative is envisioned as a point\nof view any reasonable morally motivated person can adopt in\ndeliberating about what he/she ought morally to do (Rawls, CP 498ff).\nWhen joined with the common assumption that the totality of moral\nreasons is final and override non-moral reasons, the moral point of\nview might be regarded as the most fundamental perspective that we can\nadopt in practical reasoning about what we ought to do.  \nRawls’s idea of the original position, as initially conceived,\nis his account of the moral point of view with regard to matters of\njustice. The original position is a hypothetical perspective that we\ncan adopt in our moral reasoning about the most basic principles of\nsocial and political justice. What primarily distinguishes\nRawls’s impartial perspective from its antecedents (in Hume,\nSmith, Kant, etc.) is that, rather than representing the judgment of\none person, it is conceived socially, as a general agreement by\n(representatives of all adult) members of an ongoing society. The\npoint of view of justice is then represented as a general social\n“contract” or agreement by free and equal persons on the\nbasic terms of cooperation for their society.  \nHistorically the idea of a social contract had a more limited role\nthan Rawls assigns to it. In Hobbes and Locke the social contract\nserves as an argument for the legitimacy of political authority.\nHobbes argues that in a pre-social state of nature it would be\nrational for all to agree to authorize one person to exercise the\nabsolute political power needed to enforce norms necessary for social\ncooperation. By contrast, Locke argued against absolute monarchy by\ncontending that no existing political constitution is legitimate or\njust unless it could be contracted into starting from a\nposition of equal right within a (relatively peaceful) state of\nnature, and without violating any natural rights or duties. For\nRousseau and perhaps Kant too, the idea of a social contract played a\ndifferent role: as part of their accounts of the General Will, the\nsocial contract is a point of view that lawmakers and citizens should\nadopt for assessing existing laws and deciding on measures that\nachieve justice and citizens’ common good. Rawls generalizes on\nLocke’s, Rousseau’s and Kant’s natural right\ntheories of the social contract (TJ vii/xviii): the purpose of his\noriginal position is to yield principles to determine and assess the\njustice of political constitutions and of economic and social\narrangements. To do so, he seeks in the original position “to\ncombine into one conception the totality of conditions which we are\nready upon due reflection to recognize as reasonable in our conduct\ntowards one another” (TJ 587/514). \nWhy does Rawls represent principles of justice as originating in a\nkind of social contract? Rawls says that “justice as fairness\nassigns a certain primacy to the social” (CP 339). Unlike\nKant’s categorical imperative procedure, the original position\nis designed to represent the predominantly social bases of justice. To\nsay that justice is predominantly social does not mean that people do\nnot have “natural” moral rights and duties outside society\nor in non-cooperative circumstances—Rawls clearly thinks there\nare human rights (see LP sect.10) and natural duties (TJ sects. 19,\n51) that apply to all human beings as such. But whatever our natural\nor human rights and duties may be, they do not provide an adequate\nbasis for ascertaining the rights and duties of justice that we owe\none another as members of the same ongoing political society. It is in\nlarge part due to “the profoundly social nature of human\nrelationships” (PL 259) that Rawls sees political and economic\njustice as grounded in social cooperation and reciprocity. For this\nreason Rawls eschews the idea of a state of nature wherein pre-social\nbut fully rational individuals agree to cooperative norms (as in\nHobbesian views), or where pre-political persons with antecedent\nnatural rights agree on the form of a political constitution (as in\nLocke). We are social beings in the sense that in the absence of\nsociety and social development we have but inchoate and unrealized\ncapacities, including our capacities for rationality, morality, even\nlanguage itself. As Rousseau says, outside society we are but\n“stupid and shortsighted animals” (Rousseau, bk.I, ch.8,\npar. 1). This undermines the main point of the idea of a state of\nnature in many views, which is to distinguish the rights, claims,\nduties, powers and competencies we have prior to membership in society\nfrom those we acquire as members of society. Not being members of some\nsociety is not an option for us. In so far as we are rational and\nreasonable beings at all, we have developed as members of a society,\nwithin its social framework and institutions. Accordingly Rawls says\nthat no sense can be made of the notion of that part of an\nindividual’s social benefits that exceed what would have been\nthat person’s situation in a state of nature (PL 278). The\ntraditional idea of pre-social or even pre-political rational moral\nagents thus plays no role in Rawls’s account of justice and the\nsocial contract; for him the state of nature is an idea without moral\nsignificance (PL 278–280). The original position is set forth\nlargely as an alternative to the state of nature and is regarded by\nRawls as the appropriate initial situation for a social contract.\n(Below we consider a further reason behind Rawls’s rejection of\nthe state of nature: it does not adequately allow for impartial\njudgment and the equality of persons.) \nAnother way in which Rawls represents the “profoundly\nsocial” bases of principles of justice is by focusing on\n“the basic structure of society.” The “first subject\nof justice,” Rawls says, is principles that regulate the basic\nsocial institutions that constitute the “basic structure of\nsociety” (TJ sect.2). These basic institutions include the\npolitical constitution, which specifies procedures for legislating and\nenforcing laws and the system of trials for adjudicating disputes; the\nbases of the economic system, including the norms of property, its\ntransfer and distribution, contractual relations, etc. which are all\nnecessary for economic production, exchange, and consumption; and\nfinally norms that define and regulate permissible forms of the\nfamily, which is needed to perpetuate society. It is the role of\nprinciples of justice to specify and assess the system of rules that\nconstitute these basic institutions, and determine the fair\ndistribution of rights, duties, opportunities, powers and positions of\noffice to be realized within them. What makes these institutions and\ntheir arrangement the first subject for principles of social justice\nis that they are all necessary to social cooperation and have such\nprofound influences on our circumstances, aims, characters, and future\nprospects. No stable, enduring society could exist without certain\nrules of property, contract, and transfer of goods and resources, for\nthey make economic production, trade, and consumption possible. Nor\ncould a society long endure without some political mechanism for\nresolving disputes and making, revising, interpreting, and enforcing\nits economic and other cooperative norms; nor without some form of the\nfamily, to reproduce, sustain, and nurture members of its future\ngenerations. This is what distinguishes the social institutions\nconstituting the basic structure from other profoundly influential\nsocial institutions, such as religion; religion and other social\ninstitutions are not basic in Rawls’s sense because they are not\ngenerally necessary to social cooperation among members of society.\n(Even if certain religions have been ideologically necessary to\nsustain the norms of particular societies, many societies can and do\nexist without the involvement or support of religious institutions).\n \nAnother reason Rawls regards the original position as the appropriate\nsetting for a social contract is implicit in his stated aim in A\nTheory of Justice: it is to discover the most appropriate moral\nconception of justice for a democratic society wherein persons regard\nthemselves as free and equal citizens (TJ viii/xviii). Here he assumes\nan ideal of citizens as “moral persons” who regard\nthemselves as free and equal, have a conception of their rational\ngood, and also have a “sense of justice.” “Moral\npersons” (an 18th century term) are not necessarily\nmorally good persons. Instead moral persons are persons who are\ncapable of being rational since they have the capacities to form,\nrevise and pursue a conception of the good; moreover, moral persons\nalso are capable of being reasonable since they have a moral capacity\nfor a sense of justice—to cooperate with others on terms that\nare fair and to understand, apply, and act upon principles of justice\nand their requirements. Because people have these capacities, or\n“moral powers,” we hold them responsible for their\nactions, and they are regarded as capable of pursuing their interests\nand engaging in social cooperation. Rawls’s idea is that, being\nreasonable and rational, persons (like us) who regard ourselves as\nfree and equal should be in a position to accept and endorse as\nmorally justifiable the principles of justice regulating our basic\nsocial institutions and individual conduct. Otherwise our conduct is\ncoerced for reasons we cannot (reasonably or rationally) accept and we\nare not fundamentally free persons. Starting from these assumptions,\nRawls construes the moral point of view from which to decide moral\nprinciples of justice as a social contract in which\n(representatives of) free and equal persons are given the task of\ncoming to an agreement on principles of justice that are to regulate\ntheir social and political relations in perpetuity. How otherwise,\nRawls contends, should we represent the justification of principles of\njustice for free and equal persons who have different conceptions of\ntheir good, as well as different religious, philosophical, and moral\nviews? There is no commonly accepted moral or religious authority or\ndoctrine to which they could appeal in order to discover principles of\njustice that all could agree to and accept. Rawls contends that, since\nhis aim is to discover a conception of justice appropriate for a\ndemocratic society, it should be justifiable to free and equal persons\nin their capacity as citizens on terms which all can endorse and\naccept. The role of the social contract is to represent this idea,\nthat the basic principles of social cooperation are justifiable hence\nacceptable to all members of society, and that they are principles\nwhich all can commit themselves to support and comply with.  \nHow is this social contract to be conceived? It is not an historical\nevent that must actually take place at some point in time (TJ\n120/104). It is rather a hypothetical situation, a kind of\n“thought experiment” (JF 17), that is designed to uncover\nthe most reasonable principles of justice. Rawls maintains (in LHPP,\ncf. p.15) that the major advocates of social contract\ndoctrine—Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Kant—all regarded\nthe social contract, as a hypothetical event. Hobbes and Locke thus\nposited a hypothetical state of nature in which there is no political\nauthority, and where people are regarded as rational and (for Locke)\nalso reasonable. The purpose of this hypothetical social contract is\nto demonstrate what types of governments are politically legitimate,\nand determine the nature of individuals’ political obligations\n(ibid. p.16). The presumption is that if a government could\nor would be agreed to by all rational persons subject to it in an\nappropriately described pre-political situation, then it is acceptable\nto rational persons generally, including you and me, and hence is\nlegitimate and is the source of our political obligations. Thus Hobbes\nargues that all rational persons in a state of nature would agree to\nauthorize an absolute sovereign, while Locke comes to the opposite\nconclusion, contending that absolutism would be rejected in favor of\nconstitutional monarchy. Similarly, in Rousseau and Kant, the social\ncontract is a way to reason about the General Will, or the laws that\nhypothetical moral agents would all agree to in order to promote the\ncommon good and realize the freedom and equality of citizens. \nRawls employs the idea of a hypothetical social contract for more\ngeneral purposes than his predecessors. He aims to provide principles\nof justice that can be applied to determine not only the justice of\npolitical constitutions and the laws, but also the justice of the\ninstitution of property and of social and economic arrangements for\nthe production and distribution of income and wealth, as well as the\ndistribution of educational and work opportunities, and of powers and\npositions of office and responsibility. \nSome have objected that hypothetical agreements cannot bind or\nobligate people; only actual contracts or agreements can impose\nobligations and commitments (Dworkin, 1977, 150ff). But the original\nposition is not intended to impose new obligations on us; rather it is\na device for discovery and is to be used, as Rawls says, “to\nhelp us work out what we now think” (CP 402); it incorporates\n“conditions…we do in fact accept” (TJ 587/514) and\nis a kind of “thought experiment for the purpose of public- and\nself-clarification” (JF, p.17). Hypothetical agreement in the\noriginal position does not then bind anyone to duties or commitments\nhe/she does not already have. Its point rather is to help discover and\nexplicate the requirements of our moral concepts of justice and enable\nus to draw the consequences of considered moral convictions of justice\nthat we all presumably share. Whether we in turn consciously accept or\nagree to these consequences and the principles and duties they\nimplicate once brought to our awareness is irrelevant to their\njustification. The point rather of conjecturing the outcome of a\nhypothetical agreement is that, assuming that the premises underlying\nthe original position correctly represent our most deeply held\nconsidered moral convictions and concepts of justice, then we are\ncommitted to endorsing the resulting principles and duties whether or\nnot we actually accept or agree to them. Not to do so implies a\nfailure to accept and live up to the consequences of our own moral\nconvictions about justice. \nRawls calls his conception “justice as fairness.” His aim\nin designing the original position is to describe an agreement\nsituation that is fair among all the parties to the hypothetical\nsocial contract. He assumes that if the parties to the social contract\nare fairly situated and take all relevant information into account,\nthen the principles they would agree to are also fair. The fairness of\nthe original agreement situation transfers to the principles everyone\nagrees to; furthermore, whatever laws or institutions are required by\nthe principles of justice are also fair. The principles of justice\nchosen in the original position are in this way the result of a choice\nprocedure designed to “incorporate pure procedural justice at\nthe highest level” (CP, 310, cf. TJ 120/104). This feature of\nRawls’s original position is closely related to his\nconstructivism, and his subsequent understanding of the original\nposition as a “procedure of construction” (see below,\n§9). \nThere are different ways to define a fair agreement situation\ndepending on the purpose of the agreement and the description of the\nparties to it. For example, certain facts are relevant to entering\ninto a fair employment contract – a prospective employee’s\ntalents, skills, prior training, experience, motivation, and\nreliability, for example – that may not be relevant to other\nfair agreements. What is a fair agreement situation among free and\nequal persons when the purpose of the agreement is fundamental\nprinciples of justice for the basic structure of society? What sort of\nfacts should the parties to such a fundamental social contract know,\nand what sort of facts are irrelevant or even prejudicial to a fair\nagreement? Here it is helpful to compare Rawls’s and\nLocke’s social contracts. A feature of Locke’s social\ncontract is that it transpires in a state of nature among free and\nequal persons who know everything about themselves that you and I know\nabout ourselves and each other. Thus Locke’s parties know their\nnatural talents, skills, education, and other personal\ncharacteristics; their racial and ethnic group, gender, social class,\nand occupations; their level of wealth and income, their religious and\nmoral beliefs, an so on. Given this knowledge, Locke assumes that,\nwhile starting from a position of equal political right, the great\nmajority of free and equal persons in a state of nature –\nincluding all women and racial minorities, and all other men who do\nnot meet a rigid property qualification – could and most likely\nwould rationally agree to alienate their natural rights of equal\npolitical jurisdiction in order to gain the benefits of political\nsociety. Thus Locke envisions as legitimate a constitutional monarchy\nthat is in effect a gender-and-racially biased class state, a state\nwherein a small class of amply propertied white males exercise\npolitical rights to vote, hold office, exercise political and social\ninfluence, and enjoy other important benefits and responsibilities to\nthe exclusion of everyone else (see Rawls, LHPP, 138–139). \nThe problem with this arrangement, of course, is that gender and\nracial classifications, social class, wealth and lack thereof, are,\nlike absence of religious belief, not good reasons for depriving\npeople of their equal political rights or opportunities to occupy\nsocial and political positions. Knowledge of these and other facts are\nnot morally relevant for deciding who should qualify to vote, hold\noffice, and actively participate in governing and administering\nsociety. Rawls suggests that the reason Locke’s social contract\nresults in this unjust outcome is that it transpires (hypothetically)\nunder unfair conditions of a state of nature, where the parties have\ncomplete knowledge of their circumstances, characteristics and social\nsituations. Socially powerful and wealthy parties then have access to\nand are able to take advantage of their knowledge of their\n“favorable position and exercise their threat advantage”\nto extract favorable terms of cooperation for themselves from those in\nless favorable positions (JF 16). Consequently the parties’\njudgments regarding constitutional provisions are biased by their\nknowledge of their particular circumstances and their decisions are\ninsufficiently impartial.  \nThe remedy for such biases of judgment is to redefine the initial\nsituation. Rather than a state of nature Rawls situates the parties to\nhis social contract so that they do not have access to factual\nknowledge that can distort their judgments and result in unfair\nprinciples. Rawls’s original position is an initial agreement\nsituation wherein the parties are without information that enables\nthem to tailor principles of justice favorable to their personal\ncircumstances. Among the essential features of the original position\nis that no one knows his or her place in society, class position or\nsocial status, nor does any one know his or her race or gender,\nfortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities, level of\nintelligence, strength, education, and the like. Rawls even assumes\nthat the parties do not know their values or “conceptions of the\ngood,” their religious or philosophical convictions, or their\nspecial psychological propensities. The principles of justice are\nchosen behind a “veil of ignorance” (TJ 12/11). This veil\nof ignorance deprives the parties of all knowledge of particular facts\nabout themselves, about one another, and even about their society and\nits history.  \nThe parties are not however completely ignorant of facts. They know\nall kinds of general facts about persons and societies, including\nknowledge of relatively uncontroversial scientific laws and\ngeneralizations accepted within the natural and social sciences\n– economics, psychology, political science, biology and other\nnatural sciences (including applications of Darwinian evolutionary\ntheory that are generally accepted by scientists, however\ncontroversial they may be among religious fundamentalists). They know\nthen about the general tendencies of human behavior and psychological\ndevelopment, about neuropsychology and biological evolution, and about\nhow economic markets work, including neo-classical price theory of\nsupply and demand. As discussed below, they also know about the\ncircumstances of justice—moderate scarcity and limited\naltruism—as well as the desirability of the “primary\nsocial goods” that are needed by anyone to live a good life and\nto develop their “moral powers” and other capacities. What\nthe parties lack however is knowledge of any particular facts about\ntheir own and other persons’ lives, as well as knowledge of any\nhistorical facts about their society and its population, its level of\nwealth and resources, religious institutions, etc.. Rawls thinks that\nsince the parties are required to come to an agreement on objective\nprinciples that supply universal standards of justice applying across\nall societies, knowledge of particular and historical facts about any\nperson or society is morally irrelevant and potentially prejudicial to\ntheir decision. \nAnother reason Rawls gives for such a “thick” veil of\nignorance is that it is designed to be a strict “position of\nequality” (TJ 12/11) that represents persons purely in their\ncapacity as free and equal moral persons. The parties in the original\nposition do not know any particular facts about themselves or society;\nthey all have the same general information made available to them.\nThey are then situated equally in a very strong way,\n“symmetrically” (JF 18) and purely as free and equal moral\npersons. They know only characteristics and interests they share in\ncommon in their capacity as free and equal moral persons—their\n“higher-order interests” in developing the moral powers of\njustice and rationality, their need for the primary social goods, and\nso on. The moral powers, Rawls contends, are the “basis of\nequality, the features of human beings in virtue of which they are to\nbe treated in accordance with the principles of justice” (TJ,\n504/441). Knowledge of the moral powers and their essential role in\nsocial cooperation, along with knowledge of other general facts, is\nall that is morally relevant, Rawls believes, to a decision on\nprinciples of justice that are to reflect people’s status as\nfree and equal moral persons. A thick veil of ignorance thus is\ndesigned to represent the equality of persons purely as moral persons,\nand not in any other contingent capacity or social role. In this\nregard the veil interprets the Kantian idea of equality as equal\nrespect for moral persons (cf. CP 255). \nMany criticisms have been leveled against Rawls’s veil of\nignorance. Among the most frequent is that choice in the original\nposition is indeterminate (Sen, 2009, 11–12, 56–58). Among\nother reasons for this, it is said that the parties are deprived of so\nmuch information about themselves that they are psychologically\nincapable of making a choice, or they are incapable of making a\nrational choice. For how can we make any rational choice without\nknowing our primary ends, or fundamental values and commitments?\n(MacIntyre, 1981; Sandel 1982)  \nOne answer is that we do not need to know everything about ourselves,\nincluding our primary purposes, to make rational decisions about the\nbackground social conditions needed to pursue those primary purposes.\nFor example, whatever our ends, we know that personal security and an\nabsence of social chaos are conditions of most anyone’s living a\ngood life (as Hobbes contends). Similarly, though Rawls’s\nparties do not know their particular values and commitments, they do\nknow that they require an adequate share of primary social goods\n(rights and liberties, powers and opportunities, income and wealth,\nand the social bases of self-respect) to effectively pursue their\npurposes, whatever they may be. They also know they have a\n“higher-order interest” in adequately developing and\nexercising their “moral powers” – the capacities to\nbe rational and reasonable – which are conditions of responsible\nagency and social cooperation. Rawls contends that knowledge of these\nbasic social needs (he also calls them “essential goods”)\nis sufficient for a rational choice on principles of justice by the\nparties in the original position. To resolve this controversy, critics\nneed to examine the details of Rawls’s argument and be more\nspecific about where it is claimed to fail.  \nTo the objection that choice behind the veil of ignorance is\npsychologically impossible, Rawls says that it is important not to get\ntoo caught up in the theoretical fiction of the original position, as\nif it were some historical event among real people who are being asked\nto do something impossible. The original position is not supposed to\nbe realistic, but is a “device of representation” (PL 27),\nor a “thought experiment,” (JF, 83), that is designed to\norganize our considered convictions of justice and clarify their\nimplications. The parties in it are not real but are “artificial\npersons” who have a role to play in this thought experiment.\nThey represent an ideal of free and equal reasonable and rational\nmoral persons that Rawls assumes is implicit in our reasoning about\njustice. The veil of ignorance is a representation of the kinds of\nreasons and information that are relevant to a decision on principles\nof justice for the basic structure of a society of free and equal\nmoral persons (TJ 17/16). Many different kinds of reasons and facts\nare not morally relevant to that kind of decision (e.g., information\nabout people’s race, gender, religious affiliation, wealth, and\neven, Rawls says more controversially, their conceptions of their\ngood), just as many different kinds of reasons and facts are\nirrelevant to mathematicians’ ability to work out the formal\nproof of a theorem. As a mathematician, scientist, or musician\nexercise their expertise by ignoring their knowledge of particular\nfacts about themselves, presumably we can do so too in reasoning about\nprinciples of justice. Rawls says we can “enter the original\nposition at any time simply by reasoning in accordance with the\nenumerated restrictions on information,” (PL 27) and taking into\naccount general facts about persons, their needs, and social and\neconomic cooperation that are provided to the parties (TJ 120/104,\n587/514). \nA related criticism of Rawls’s “thick” veil of\nignorance is that even if the parties can make certain rational\ndecisions in their interest without knowledge of their final ends,\nstill they cannot come to a decision about principles of justice. For\njustice consists, allegedly, of the measures that effectively promote\ngood consequences. Without knowledge what is ultimately good (however\nthat is to be defined) the parties cannot discover the principles of\njustice that best promote it. This criticism is mirrored in\nutilitarian versions of the moral point of view, which incorporate a\n“thin” veil of ignorance that represents a different idea\nof impartiality. The impartial sympathetic spectator found in David\nHume and Adam Smith, or the self-interested rational chooser in John\nHarsanyi’s average utilitarian account, all have complete\nknowledge of everyone’s desires, interests and purposes as well\nas knowledge of particular facts about people and their historical\nsituations. Impartiality is achieved by depriving the impartial\nobserver or rational chooser of any knowledge of its own identity.\nThis leads it to give equal consideration to everyone’s desires\nand interests, and impartially take everyone’s desires and\ninterests into account. Since rationality is presumed to involve\nmaximizing something – or taking the most effective means to\npromote the greatest realization of one’s ends – the\nimpartial observer/chooser rationally chooses the rule or course of\naction that maximizes the satisfaction of desires, or utility\n(aggregate or average), summed across all persons.  \nRawls’s original position with its “thick” veil of\nignorance represents a different conception of impartiality than the\nutilitarian requirement that equal consideration be given to\neveryone’s desires. The original position abstracts from all\ninformation about current circumstances and the status quo, including\neveryone’s desires and particular interests. Utilitarians take\npeoples’ desires and interests as given and seek to maximize\ntheir satisfaction; in so doing utilitarians suspend judgment\nregarding the moral permissibility of peoples’ desires and\npreferences and of the social circumstances and institutions within\nwhich desires and preferences are formed. For Rawls, a primary reason\nfor a thick veil of ignorance is to enable an unbiased assessment of\nthe justice of existing social and political institutions and of\nexisting desires, preferences and conceptions of the good. If the\nparties to Rawls’s original position had knowledge of\npeoples’ beliefs and desires, as well as knowledge of the laws,\ninstitutions and circumstances of their society, then this knowledge\nwould influence their decisions on principles of justice. The\nprinciples agreed to would then not be sufficiently detached from the\nvery desires, circumstances, and institutions these principles are to\ncritically assess. Since utilitarians take peoples’ desires and\npreferences as given under existing circumstances, any principles,\nlaws or institutions chosen behind their thin veil of ignorance will\nreflect and be biased by the status quo. To take an obvious\ncounterexample, there is little if any justice in laws approved from a\nutilitarian impartial perspective when these laws take into account\nracially prejudiced preferences which are cultivated by grossly\nunequal, racially discriminatory and segregated social conditions. To\nimpartially give equal consideration to everyone’s desires\nformed under such under unjust conditions is hardly sufficient to meet\nrequirements of justice. This illustrates some of the reasons for a\n“thick” as opposed to a “thin” veil of\nignorance.  \nRawls says that in the original position, “the Reasonable frames\nthe Rational” (CP 319). He means the OP is a situation where\nrational choice of the parties is made subject to reasonable (or\nmoral) constraints. In what sense are the parties and their choice and\nagreement rational? Philosophers have different understandings of\npractical rationality. Rawls seeks to incorporate a relatively\nuncontroversial account of rationality into the original position, one\nthat he thinks most any account of practical rationality would endorse\nas at least necessary for rational decision. The parties are then\ndescribed as rational in a formal or “thin” sense that is\ncharacteristic of the theories of rational and social choice. They are\nresourceful, take effective means to their ends, and seek to make\ntheir preferences consistent. They also take the course of action that\nis more likely to achieve their ends (other things being equal). And\nthey choose courses of action that satisfy more rather than fewer of\ntheir purposes. Rawls calls these principles of rational choice the\n“counting principles” (TJ sect. 25, JF 87).  \nMore generally, for Rawls rational persons upon reflection can\nformulate a conception of their good, or of their primary\nvalues and purposes and the best way of life for themselves to live\ngiven their purposes. This conception incorporates their primary aims,\nambitions, and commitments to others, and is informed by the\nconscientious moral, religious, and philosophical convictions that\ngive meaning for them to their lives. Ideally, rational persons have\ncarefully thought about these things and their relative importance,\nand they can coherently order their purposes and commitments into a\n“rational plan of life,” which extends over their\nlifetimes (TJ sect. 63). For Rawls, rational persons regard life as a\nwhole, and do not give preference to any particular period of it.\nRather in drawing up their rational plans, they are equally concerned\nwith their (future) good at each part of their lives. In this regard,\nrational persons are prudent—they care for their future\ngood, and while they may discount the importance of future purposes\nbased on probability assessments, they do not discount the achievement\nof their future purposes simply because they are in the future (TJ,\nsect. 45).  \nThese primary aims, convictions, ambitions, and commitments are among\nthe primary motivations of the parties in the original position. The\nparties want to provide favorable conditions for the pursuit of the\nvarious elements of the rational plan of life that defines a good life\nfor them. This is ultimately what the parties are trying to accomplish\nin their choice of principles of justice. In this sense they are\nrational.  \nRawls says the parties in the original position are “mutually\ndisinterested,” in the sense that they take no interest in one\nanother’s interests. This does not mean that they are generally\nself-interested or selfish persons, indifferent to the welfare of\nothers. Most people are concerned, not just with their own happiness\nor welfare, but with that of others as well, and have all kinds of\ncommitments to others, including other-regarding and beneficent\npurposes, that are part of their conceptions of the good. But in the\noriginal position itself the parties are not altruistically motivated\nto benefit each other, in their capacity as contracting\nparties. They try to do as best as they can for themselves and\nfor those persons and causes that they care for. Their situation is\ncomparable, Rawls says, to that of trustees acting to promote\nthe interests of the beneficiaries they represent. Trustees cannot\nsacrifice the well-being of the beneficiaries they represent to\nbenefit other trustees or individuals. If they did, they would be\nderelict in their duties. It is perhaps to address the common\ncriticism that the parties to the original position are\nself-interested that Rawls in his later writings increasingly says\nthat we should imagine that the parties are representatives or\ntrustees of other individuals’ interests, and seek to do as best\nas they can for the particular individuals that each trustee\nrepresents. In either case, Rawls believes this account of the\nparties’ motivations promotes greater clarity, and that to\nattribute to the parties moral motivations or benevolence towards each\nother would not result in definite choice of a conception of justice\n(TJ, 148–9/128–9; 584/512). (For example, how much\nbenevolence should they have towards one another? Surely not impartial\nbenevolence towards everyone, for then we might as well dispense with\nthe social contract and rely on an impartial spectator point of view.\nBut if not equal concern for all parties, then how much?) \nMutual disinterest of the parties also means they are not moved by\nenvy or rancor towards each other or others generally. This implies\nthat the parties do not strive to be wealthier or better off than\nothers for its own sake, and thus do not sacrifice advantages to\nprevent others from having more than they do. Instead, each party in\nthe original position is motivated to do as well as he/she can in\nabsolute terms in promoting the optimal achievement of the many\npurposes that make up a conception of the good, without regard to how\nmuch or how little others may have. For this reason they strive to\nguarantee themselves a share of primary social goods sufficient to\nenable them to pursue their (unknown) conception of the good. \nThough the parties are not motivated by beneficence or even a concern\nfor justice, still they have a capacity for reasonableness\nand a sense of justice (TJ, 145/125 rev.). Rawls\ndistinguishes between the requirements of rationality and\nreasonableness; both are part of practical reasoning about what we\nought to do (JF 6–7; 81–2). The concept of “the\nRational” concerns a person’s good—hence\nRawls refers to his account of the good as “goodness as\nrationality.” A person’s good for Rawls is the rational\nplan of life he/she would choose under hypothetical conditions of\n“deliberative rationality,” where there is full knowledge\nof one’s circumstances, capacities, and interests, as well as\nknowledge of the likelihoods of succeeding at alternative life plans\none may be attracted to (TJ, sect. 64). “The Reasonable”\non the other hand has to do with the concept of right, which\nincludes individual moral duties and moral requirements of right and\njustice applying to institutions and society. Both rationality and\nreasonableness are independent aspects of practical reason for Rawls.\nThey are independent in that Rawls, unlike Hobbes, does not regard\njustice and the reasonable as simply the principles of prudence that\nare beneficial for a person to comply with in order to successfully\npursue his or her purposes in social contexts. Unlike Hobbes, Rawls\ndoes not claim that an immoral person is irrational, or that morality\nis necessarily required by rationality. However, a rational person who\nviolates reasonable demands of justice is unreasonable in that he or\nshe infringes upon moral requirements of practical reasoning. Being\nreasonable, even if not required by rationality, is still an\nindependent aspect of practical reason. Rawls resembles Kant in this\nregard (PL 25n); his distinction between the reasonable and rational\nparallels Kant’s distinction between categorical and\nhypothetical imperatives.  \nEssential to being reasonable is having a sense of justice.\nThe sense of justice is a normally effective desire to comply with\nduties and obligations required by justice; it includes a willingness\nto cooperate with others on terms that are fair and that reasonable\npersons can accept and endorse. Rawls sees a sense of justice as an\nattribute people normally have; it “would appear to be a\ncondition for human sociability” (TJ, 495/433 rev.). He rejects\nthe idea that people are motivated only by self-interest in\nall that they do; he also rejects the Hobbesian assumption that a\nwillingness to do justice must be grounded in self-interest. It is\nessential to Rawls’s argument for the feasibility and stability\nof justice as fairness that the parties upon entering society have an\neffective sense of justice, and that, as members of society, they are\ncapable of doing what justice requires of them, either for its own\nsake, or because the believe this is what morality requires of them.\nAn amoralist, Rawls believes, is largely a philosophical construct;\nthe amoralists who actually exist Rawls sees as sociopaths. \nSubsequent to A Theory of Justice, in Kantian and Political\nConstructivism, Rawls says that the parties to the original position\nhave a “higher-order interest” in the exercise and\ndevelopment of their capacity for a sense of justice (as well as in\ntheir capacity to be rational), and that fulfilling this interest is\none of the main aims behind their agreement on principles of justice.\nThe parties’ interest in developing these two “moral\npowers” is a substantive feature of Rawls’s account of the\nrationality of free and equal persons. (In this regard, his account of\ngoodness as rationality is not as “thin” as in social\ntheory; cf. TJ 143/124.) Here is it is important to see that Rawls is\nstill not attributing specifically moral motives—a desire to be\nreasonable and do what is right and just for their own sake—to\nthe parties in the original position. The idea behind the\nparties’ rationality in cultivating their sense of justice is\nthat, since reasonableness is a condition of human sociability and\nsocial cooperation, then it is in people’s rational\ninterest—part of their good—that they normally\ndevelop their capacities for justice under social conditions.\nOtherwise they will not be in a position to cooperate with others and\nbenefit from social life. A person who is without a sense of justice\nis wholly unreasonable and as a result is normally eschewed by others,\nfor he or she is not trustworthy or reliable or even safe to interact\nwith. Since having a sense of justice is a condition of taking part in\nsocial cooperation, the parties have a “higher-order\ninterest” in establishing conditions for the full development\nand effective exercise of their capacity for a sense of justice. The\nparties’ interest in developing their capacity for a sense of\njustice is then a rational interest in being reasonable; justice is\nthen regarded by the parties as instrumental to their\nrealizing their conception of the good. (Here again, it is important\nto distinguish the purely rational motivation of the parties or their\ntrustees in the original position from that of free and equal citizens\nin a well-ordered society, who are normally morally motivated by their\nsense of justice to do what is right and just for its own sake.) \nThree factors then play a role in motivating the parties in the\noriginal position: (1) First, they aim to advance their determinate\nconception of the good, or rational plan of life, even though they do\nnot know what that conception is. Moreover, they also seek conditions\nthat enable them to exercise and develop their “moral\npowers,” namely (2) their rational capacities to form, revise\nand rationally pursue a conception of their good, and (3) their\ncapacity to be reasonable and to have an effective sense of justice.\nThese are the three “higher-order interests” the parties\nto Rawls’s original position aim to promote in their agreement\non principles of justice.  \nThe three higher-order interests provide the basis for Rawls’s\naccount of primary social goods. The primary goods are the\nall-purpose social means that are necessary to the exercise and\ndevelopment of the moral powers and to pursue a wide variety of\nconceptions of the good. Rawls describes them initially in\nTheory as goods that any rational person should want,\nwhatever his or her rational plan of life. The primary social goods\nare: rights and liberties; powers and diverse opportunities; income\nand wealth; and the social bases of self-respect. ‘Powers’\nrefer not simply to a capacity to effect outcomes or influence\nothers’ behavior. Rawls rather uses the term\n‘powers’ to refer to the legal and institutional abilities\nand prerogatives that attend offices and social positions. Hence, he\nsometimes refers to the primary goods of “powers and\nprerogatives of offices and positions of authority and\nresponsibility” (JF 58). Members of various professions and\ntrades have institutional powers and prerogatives that are\ncharacteristic of their position and which are necessary if they are\nto carry out their respective roles and responsibilities. By income\nand wealth Rawls says he intends “all-purpose means” that\nhave an exchange value, which are generally needed to achieve a wide\nrange of ends (JF 58–59). Finally, “the social bases of\nself-respect” are features of institutions that are needed to\nenable people to have the confidence that they and their position in\nsociety are respected and that their conception of the good is worth\npursuing and achievable by themselves. These features depend upon\nhistory and culture. Primary among these social bases of self respect\nin a democratic society, Rawls will contend, are equal recognition of\npersons as citizens, and hence the institutional conditions needed for\nequal citizenship, including equality of basic rights and liberties\nwith equal political rights; fair equality of opportunities; and\npersonal independence guaranteed by adequate material means for\nachieving it. The social bases of self-respect are crucial to\nRawls’s argument for equal basic liberties, especially\npolitical equality and equal rights of political participation.  \nThe parties to the original position are motivated to achieve a fully\nadequate share of primary goods so they can achieve their higher-order\ninterests in pursuing their rational plans of life and exercising\ntheir moral powers. “They assume that they normally prefer more\nprimary social goods rather than less” (TJ, 142/123 rev.). This\ntoo is part of being rational. Because they are not envious, their\nconcern is with the absolute level of primary goods, not their share\nrelative to other persons.  \nTo sum up, the parties in the original position are formally rational\nin that they are assumed to have and to effectively pursue a rational\nplan of life with a schedule of coherent purposes and commitments that\ngive their lives meaning. As part of their rational plans, they have a\nsubstantive interest in the development and exercise of their\ncapacities to be rational and to be reasonable. These\n“higher-order interests” together with their rational life\nplans provide them with reason to procure for themselves in their\nchoice of principles of justice an adequate share of the primary\nsocial goods that enable them to achieve these higher-order ends and\neffectively pursue their conceptions of the good. \nA final feature of Rawls’s account of rationality is a normal\nhuman tendency he calls “the Aristotelian principle” (TJ\nsect.65). This “deep psychological fact” says that, other\nthings equal, people normally find activities that call upon the\nexercise of their developed capacities to be more interesting and\npreferable to engaging in simpler tasks, and their enjoyment increases\nthe more the capacity is developed and realized and the greater the\ncomplexity of activities (TJ, 426/374). Moreover Rawls believes that\ndevelopment of our “higher capacities” (J.S. Mill’s\nterm) is important to our sense of self-respect. These general facts\nimply that rational people should incorporate into their life plans\nactivities that call upon the exercise and development of their\ntalents and skills and distinctly human capacities (TJ 432/379). This\nmotivation is especially relevant to Rawls’s argument for the\nstability of justice as fairness and the good of justice (see below,\n§5.3). The important point here is that the Aristotelian\nprinciple is taken into account by the parties in their decision on\nprinciples of justice. They want to choose principles that maintain\ntheir self-respect and enable them to freely develop their human\ncapacities and pursue a wide range of activities, as well as engage\ntheir capacities for a sense of justice.  \nThe veil of ignorance is the primary condition that constrains the\nrational choice of the parties in the original position. There are\nseveral other conditions imposed on their agreement \nAmong the general facts the parties know are “the circumstances\nof justice.” Rawls says these are “conditions under which\nhuman cooperation is both possible and necessary” (TJ 126/109\nrev.). Following Hume, Rawls distinguishes two general kinds: the\nobjective and subjective circumstances of justice. The former include\nphysical facts about human beings, such as their rough similarity in\nmental and physical faculties, and vulnerability to the united force\nof others. Objective circumstances also include conditions of moderate\nscarcity of resources: there are not enough resources to satisfy\neveryone’s demands, but there are enough to provide all with\nadequate satisfaction of their basic needs; unlike conditions of\nextreme scarcity (e.g. famine) cooperation then seems productive and\nworthwhile for people. \nAmong the subjective circumstances of justice is the parties’\nmutual disinterestedness, which reflects the “limited\naltruism” (TJ 146/127) of persons in society.. Free and equal\npersons have their own plans of life and special commitments to\nothers, as well as different philosophical and religious beliefs and\nmoral doctrines (TJ 127/110). Hume says that if humans were\nimpartially benevolent, equally concerned with everyone’s\nwelfare, then justice would be unnecessary. People then would\nwillingly sacrifice their interests for the greater advantage of\nother. They would not be concerned about their personal rights or\npossessions, and property would be unnecessary (Hume 1777 [1970,\n185–186]). But we are more concerned with our own aims and\ninterests—which include our interests in the interests of those\nnearer and dearer to us—than we are with the interests of\nstrangers with whom we have few if any interactions. This implies a\npotential conflict of human interests. Rawls adds that concern for our\ninterests and plans of life does not mean we are selfish or have\ninterests only in ourselves—interests of a self should\nnot be confused with interests in oneself; we have interests\nin others and in all kinds of causes and ends (TJ 127/110). But, as\nhistory shows, our benevolent interests in others and in religious and\nphilosophical doctrines are as often the cause of conflict as is\nself-interest.  \nThe subjective circumstances of justice also include limitations on\nhuman knowledge, thought, and judgment, as well as emotional\ninfluences and great diversity of experiences. These lead to biases\nand inevitable disagreements in factual and other judgments, as well\nas to differences in religious, philosophical, and moral convictions.\nIn Political Liberalism, Rawls highlights these subjective\ncircumstances, calling them “the burdens of judgment” (PL\n54–58). They imply, significantly, that regardless how impartial\nand altruistic people are, they still will disagree in their factual\njudgments and in religious, philosophical and moral doctrines.\nDisagreements in these matters are inevitable even among rational and\nreasonable people. This is “the fact of reasonable\npluralism” (PL 36), which is another general fact known to the\nparties in the original position. Reasonable pluralism of doctrines\nlends significant support to Rawls’s arguments for the first\nprinciple of justice, especially to equal basic liberties of\nconscience, expression, and association. \nThere are five “formal constraints” associated with the\nconcept of right that Rawls says the parties must take into account in\ncoming to agreement. The more a conception of justice satisfies these\nformal constraints of right, the more reason the parties have to\nchoose that conception. The formal constraints of right are:\ngenerality, universality in application, ordering of conflicting\nclaims, publicity, and finality. The ordering condition says\nthat a conception of justice should aspire to completeness: it should\nbe able to resolve conflicting claims and order their priority.\nOrdering implies a systematicity requirement: principles of justice\nshould provide a determinate resolution to problems of justice that\narise under them; and in so far as a conception of justice is not able\nto order conflicting claims and resolve problems of justice, that is a\nreason against choosing it in the original position. The ordering\ncondition is important in Rawls’s argument against pluralist\nmoral doctrines he calls “Intuitionism.”  \nSidgwick attaches a great deal of importance to the ordering\ncondition, and contends that “Universal Hedonism” is the\nonly reasonable moral doctrine that can satisfy it (Sidgwick 1907\n[1981], 406). Rawls would have to concede that justice as fairness\ndoes not possess the same degree of systematicity as hedonistic\nutilitarianism. For example, while Rawls’s priority principles\ncan resolve conflicting claims regarding the priority of basic\nliberties over fair equality of opportunity and the difference\nprinciple, there is no priority principle to resolve many conflicts\nbetween basic liberties themselves (e.g. conflicts between freedom of\nspeech vs. rights of security and integrity of persons in hate speech\ncases; or the conflict between free speech and the fair value of equal\npolitical liberties in restrictions on campaign finance\ncontributions). Often in such conflicts we have to weigh competing\nconsiderations and come to a decision about where the greater balance\nof reasons lies, much like intuitionist views. The lack of an ordering\nprinciple does not mean the balance of reasons in such conflicts\nregarding basic liberties is indeterminate but rather that reasonable\nindividuals will often disagree, and that final decisions will have to\nbe made through the appropriate democratic, judicial, or other\nprocedures. But for Rawls a moral conception’s capacity to\nclearly order conflicting claims in a way that all reasonable persons\ncan agree is but one among several formal and substantive moral\nconditions that a conception of justice should satisfy (ultimately in\nreflective equilibrium). \nThe publicity condition says that the parties are to\nassume that the principles of justice they choose will be publicly\nknown to members of society and recognized by them as the bases\nfor their social cooperation. This implies that people will not be\nuninformed or have false beliefs about the bases of their social and\npolitical relations. There are to be no “noble lies”,\nfalse ideologies, or “fake news” obscuring a\nsociety’s principles of justice. The publicity of principles of\njustice is ultimately for Rawls a condition of respect for persons as\nfree and equal moral persons. Rawls believes that individuals in a\ndemocratic society should know the bases of their social and political\nrelations and not have to be deceived about them in order to cooperate\nand live together on fair terms. This condition plays an important\nrole in Rawls’s arguments against utilitarianism and other\nconsequentialist conceptions. The idea of publicity is further\ndeveloped in Political Liberalism through the ideas of public\njustification and the role of public reason in political deliberation.\n \nRelated to publicity is that principles should be universal in\napplication. This implies not simply that “they hold for\neveryone in virtue of their being moral persons” (TJ 132/114\nrev.). It also means that everyone can understand the principles of\njustice and use them in their deliberations. Universality in\napplication then imposes a limit on how complex principles of justice\ncan be—they must be understandable to common moral sense, and\nnot so complicated that only experts can apply them in deliberations.\nFor among other things, these principles are to guide democratic\ncitizens in their judgments and shared deliberations about just laws\nand policies.  \nBoth publicity and universality in application (as Rawls defines it)\nare controversial conditions. Utilitarians, for example, have argued\nthat the truth about morality and justice is so complicated and\ncontroversial that it might be necessary to keep it hidden from most\nindividuals’ awareness. For morality often requires much that is\ncontrary to their personal interests. Also sometimes it’s just\ntoo complicated for people to understand why their moral duties\nrequire of them what they do. So long as they understand their\nindividual duties, it may be better if they do not understand the\nprinciples and reasons behind them. So Sidgwick argues that the aims\nof utilitarianism might better be achieved if it remains an\n“esoteric morality,” knowledge of which is confined to\n“an enlightened few” (Sidgwick 1907 [1981], 489–90).\nThe reason Rawls sees publicity and universality as necessary relates\nto the conception of the person implicit in justice as fairness. If we\nconceive of persons as free and equal moral persons capable of\nrational and moral autonomy, then they should not be under any\nillusions about the bases of their social relations, but should be\nable to understand, accept, and apply these principles in their\ndeliberations about justice. These are important conditions for the\nfreedom and autonomy (moral and political) of democratic citizens.\n \nRawls says, “An important feature of a conception of justice is\nthat it should generate its own support. Its principles should be such\nthat when they are embodied in the basic structure of society, people\ntend to acquire the corresponding sense of justice and develop a\ndesire to act in accordance with its principles. In this case a\nconception of justice is stable” (TJ, 138/119). The parties in\nthe original position are to take into account the “relative\nstability” of a conception of justice and the society that\ninstitutes it. The stability of a just society does not mean that it\nmust be unchanging. It means rather that in the face of inevitable\nchange members of a society should be able to maintain their\nallegiance to principles of justice and the institutions they support.\nWhen disruptions to society do occur (via economic crises, war,\nnatural catastrophes, etc.) and/or society departs from justice,\ncitizens’ commitments to principles of justice are sufficiently\nrobust that just institutions are eventually restored. The role of the\nstability requirement for Rawls is twofold: first, to test whether\npotential principles of justice are compatible with human natural\npropensities, or our moral psychology and general facts about social\nand economic institutions; and second, to determine whether principles\nare conducive to realizing the human good. \nTo be stable principles of justice should be realizable in a\nfeasible and enduring social world. They need to be\npracticably possible given the limitations of the human condition.\nMoreover, this feasible social world must be one that can endure over\ntime, not by just any means, but by gaining the willing support of\npeople who live in it. People should knowingly want to uphold and\nmaintain society’s just institutions not just because they\nbenefit from them, but on grounds of their sense of justice.\nIn choosing principles of justice, the parties in the original\nposition must take into account their “relative\nstability.” They have to consider the degree to which a\nconception (in comparison with other conceptions) describes an\nachievable and sustainable system of social cooperation, and whether\nthe institutions and demands of such a society will attract\npeople’s willing compliance and generally engage their sense of\njustice. \nFor example, suppose principles of justice were to impose a duty to\npractice impartial benevolence towards all people, and thus a duty to\nshow no greater concern for the welfare of ourselves and loved ones\nthan we do towards millions if not billions of others. This principle\ndemands too much of human nature and would not be sustainable or even\nfeasible—people simply would reject its onerous demands. But\nRawls’s stability requirement implies more than just\n‘ought implies can.’ It says that principles of justice\nand the scheme of social cooperation they describe should evince\n“stability for the right reasons” (PL xliii, CP 589).\nRecall here the higher-order interests of the parties in development\nand exercise of their capacities for justice. A just society should be\nable to endure not simply as a modus vivendi, by coercive\nenforcement of its provisions and its promoting the majority of\npeoples’ interests. Stability “for the right\nreasons” requires that people support society for moral\nreasons of justice; society’s basic principles must respond\nto reasonable persons’ capacities for justice and engage their\nsense of justice. Rawls regards our moral capacities for justice as an\nintegral part of our nature as sociable beings. He believes that one\nrole of a conception of justice is to accommodate human capacities for\nsociability, the capacities for justice that enable us to be\ncooperative social beings. So not only should a conception of justice\nadvance human interests, but it should also answer to our moral\npsychology by enabling us to knowingly and willingly exercise our\nmoral capacities and sensibilities, which are among the moral powers\nto be reasonable. This is one way that Rawls’s conception of\njustice is “ideal-based” (CP 400–401 n.): it is based in\nan ideal of human beings as free and equal moral persons and an ideal\nof their social relations as generally acceptable and justifiable to\nall reasonable persons whatever their circumstances (the ideal of a\nwell-ordered society).  \nThis relates to the second ground for the stability condition, which\ncan only be mentioned here: it is that principles of justice should be\ncompatible with, and even conducive to, the human good. It\nspeaks strongly in favor of a conception of justice that it is\ncompatible with and promotes the human good. First, if a conception of\njustice requires of many reasonable people that they change their\nconscientious philosophical or religious convictions for the sake of\nsatisfying a majority’s beliefs, or abandon their pursuit of the\nimportant interests that constitute their plan of life, this\nconception could not gain their support and would not be stable over\nsustained periods of time. Moreover, Rawls assumes that a conception\nof justice should enable citizens to adequately exercise and fully\ndevelop their moral powers. It must then engage their sense of\njustice; ideally, they should not regard justice as a burden but\nshould come to experience that acting on and from principles of\njustice is worth doing for its own sake. For Rawls, it speaks strongly\nin favor of a conception of justice that acting for the sake of its\nprinciples is experienced as an activity that is good in itself. For\nthen justice and exercise of the sense of justice are for those\npersons intrinsic goods and a precondition for their living a good\nlife. \nNow turn to the arguments for the principles of justice in the\noriginal position. \nThe original position is not a bargaining situation where the parties\nmake proposals and counterproposals and negotiate over different\nprinciples of justice. Nor is it a wide ranging discussion where the\nparties deliberate and design their own conception of justice (unlike,\nfor example, Habermas’ discourse ethics; see Habermas, 1995).\nInstead, the parties’ deliberations are much more constrained.\nThey are presented with a list of conceptions of justice taken from\nthe tradition of western political philosophy. These include different\nversions of utilitarianism, perfectionism, and intuitionism (or\npluralist views), rational egoism, justice as fairness, and a group of\n“mixed conceptions” that combine elements of these (For\nRawls’s initial list see TJ 124/107) (Rawls later says\nlibertarianism should also be added to the list, and the principles of\njustice would still be agreed to [JF 83]; Nozick [1974, 198ff] agrees\nand says the OP is incapable of yielding entitlement principles due to\nthe self-interest of the parties.). The parties’ deliberations\nare confined to discussing and agreeing upon the conception that each\nfinds most rational, given their specified interests. In a series of\npairwise comparisons, they consider all the conceptions of justice\nmade available to them and ultimately agree unanimously to accept the\nconception that survives this winnowing process. In this regard, the\noriginal position is best seen as a kind of selection process wherein\nthe parties’ deliberations are constrained by the background\nconditions imposed by the original position as well as the list of\nconceptions of justice provided to them. They are assigned the task of\nagreeing on principles for designing the basic structure of a\nself-contained society under the circumstances of justice.  \nIn making their decision, the parties are motivated only by their own\nrational interests. They do not take moral considerations of justice\ninto account except in so far as these considerations bear on their\nachieving their interests. Their interests again are defined in terms\nof their each acquiring an adequate share of primary social goods\n(rights and liberties, powers and opportunities, income and wealth,\netc.) and achieving the background social conditions enabling them to\neffectively pursue their conception of the good and realize their\nhigher-order interests in developing and exercising their moral\npowers. Since the parties are ignorant of their particular conceptions\nof the good and of all other particular facts about their society,\nthey are not in a position to engage in bargaining. In effect they all\nhave the same general information and are motivated by the same\ninterests.  \nRawls makes four arguments in Theory, Part I for the\nprinciples of justice. The main argument for the difference principle\nis made later in section 49, and is substantially amended and\nclarified in Justice as Fairness: A Restatement. The common\ntheme throughout the original position arguments is that it is more\nrational for the parties to choose the principles of justice over any\nother alternative. Rawls devotes most of his attention to the\ncomparison of justice as fairness with classical and average\nutilitarianism, with briefer discussions of perfectionism (TJ, sect.\n50) and intuitionism. Here I’ll focus discussion on\nRawls’s comparison between justice as fairness and\nutilitarianism. \nDescribing the parties’ choice as a rational choice subject to\nthe reasonable constraints imposed by the original position allows\nRawls to invoke the theory of rational choice and decision under\nconditions of uncertainty. In rational choice theory there are a\nnumber of potential “strategies” or rules of choice that\nare more or less reliably used depending on the circumstances. One\nrule of choice—called “maximin”—directs that\nwe play it as safe as possible by choosing the alternative whose worst\noutcome leaves us better off than the worst outcome of all other\nalternatives. The aim is to “maximize the minimum” regret\nor loss to well-being. To follow this strategy, Rawls says you should\nchoose as if your enemy were to assign your social position in\nwhatever kind of society you end up in. By contrast another strategy\nleads us to focus on the most advantaged position and says we should\n“maximize the maximum” potential\ngain—“maximax”—and choose the alternative\nwhose best outcome leaves us better off than all other alternatives.\nWhich, if either, of these strategies is more sensible to use depends\non the circumstances and many other factors. \nA third strategy advocated by orthodox Bayesian decision theory, says\nwe should always choose to directly maximize expected\nutility. To do so under conditions of uncertainty of outcomes,\nthe degree of uncertainty should be factored into one’s utility\nfunction, with probability estimates assigned to alternatives based on\nthe limited knowledge that one has. Given these subjective estimates\nof probability incorporated into one’s utility function, one can\nalways choose the alternative that maximizes expected\nutility. Since it simplifies matters to apply the same rule of choice\nto all decisions this is a highly attractive idea, so long as\none can accept that it is always safe to assume that that the\nmaximization of expected utility leads over time to\nmaximizing actual utility. \nWhat about those extremely rare instances where there is absolutely\nno basis upon which to make probability estimates? Suppose\nyou don’t even have a hunch regarding the greater likelihood of\none alternative over another. According to orthodox Bayesian decision\ntheory, the “principle of insufficient reason” then should\nbe observed; it says that when there is no reason to assign a greater\nlikelihood to one alternative rather than another, then an equal\nprobability is to be assigned to each potential outcome. This\nmakes sense on the assumption that if you have no more premonition of\nthe likelihood of one option rather than another, they are for all\nyou know equally likely to occur. By observing this rule of\nchoice consistently over time, a rational chooser presumably should\nmaximize his or her individual expected utility, and hopefully actual\nutility as well. \nWhat now is the appropriate decision rule to be used to choose\nprinciples of justice under conditions of complete uncertainty of\nprobabilities in Rawls’s original position? Rawls argues that,\ngiven the enormous gravity of choice in the original position, plus\nthe fact that the choice is not repeatable, it is rational for the\nparties to follow the maximin strategy when choosing between the\nprinciples of justice and principles of average or aggregate utility\n(or most any other principle). Not surprisingly, following the maximin\nrule of choice results in choice of the principles of justice over the\nprinciples of utility (average or aggregate); for unlike\nutilitarianism, justice as fairness guarantees equal basic liberties,\nfair equal opportunities, and an adequate social minimum for all\ncitizens.  \nWhy does Rawls think maximin is the rational choice rule? Recall what\nis at stake in choice from the original position. The decision is not\nan ordinary choice. It is rather a unique and irrevocable choice where\nthe parties decide the basic structure of their society, or the kind\nof social world they will live in and the background conditions\nagainst which they will develop and pursue their aims. It is a kind of\nsuperchoice—an inimitable choice of the background conditions\nfor all one’s future choices. Rawls argues that because of the\nunique importance of the choice in the original\nposition—including the gravity of the choice, the fact that it\nis not renegotiable or repeatable, and the fact that it determines all\none’s future prospects—it is rational to follow the\nmaximin rule and choose the principles of justice. For should even the\nworst transpire, the principles of justice provide an adequate share\nof primary goods enabling one to maintain one’s conscientious\nconvictions and sincerest affections and pursue a wide range of\npermissible ends by protecting equal basic liberties and fair equal\nopportunities and guaranteeing a social minimum of income and wealth.\nThe principles of utility, by contrast, provide no guarantee of any of\nthese benefits. \nRawls says that in general there are three conditions that must be met\nin order to make it rational to follow the maximin rule (TJ\n154–55/134). First, there should be no basis or at most a very\ninsecure basis upon which to make estimates of probabilities. Second,\nthe choice singled out by observing the maximin rule is an acceptable\nalternative we can live with, so that one cares relatively little by\ncomparison for what is to be gained above the minimum conditions\nsecured by the maximin choice. When this condition is satisfied, then\nno matter what position one eventually ends up in, it is at least\nacceptable. The third condition for applying the maximin rule is that\nall the other alternatives have (worse) outcomes that we could not\naccept and live with. Of these three conditions Rawls later says that\nthe first plays a minor role, and that it is the second and third\nconditions that are crucial to the maximin argument for justice as\nfairness (JF 99). This seems to suggest that, even if the veil of\nignorance were not as thick and parties did have some degree of\nknowledge of the likelihood of ending up in one social position rather\nthan another, still it would be more rational to choose the principles\nof justice over the principle of utility.  \nRawls contends all three conditions for the maximin strategy are\nsatisfied in the original position when choice is made between the\nprinciples of justice and the principle of utility (average and\naggregate). Because all one’s values, commitments, and future\nprospects are at stake in the original position, and there is no hope\nof renegotiating the outcome, a rational person would agree to the\nprinciples of justice instead of the principle of utility. For the\nprinciples of justice imply that no matter what position you occupy in\nsociety, you will have the rights and resources needed to maintain\nyour valued commitments and purposes, to effectively exercise your\ncapacities for rational and moral deliberation and action, and to\nmaintain your sense of self-respect as an equal citizen. With the\nprinciple of utility there is no such guarantee; everything is\n“up for grabs” (so to speak) and subject to loss if\nrequired by the greater sum of utilities. Conditions (2) and (3) for\napplying maximin are then satisfied in the comparison of justice as\nfairness with the principle of (average or aggregate) utility. \nIt is often claimed that Rawls’s parties are\n“risk-averse;” otherwise they would never follow the\nmaximin rule but would take a chance on riskier but more rewarding\noutcomes provided by the principle of utility. Thus, John Harsanyi\ncontends that it is more rational under conditions of complete\nuncertainty always to choose according to the principle of\ninsufficient reason and assume an equal probability of occupying any\nposition in society. When the equiprobability assumption is made, the\nparties in the original position would choose the principle of average\nutility instead of the principles of justice (Harsanyi 1975). \nRawls denies that the parties have a psychological disposition to\nrisk-aversion. He argues however that it is rational to choose as\nif one were risk averse under the highly exceptional\ncircumstances of the original position. His point is that, while there\nis nothing rational about a fixed disposition to risk aversion, it is\nnonetheless rational in some circumstances to choose conservatively to\nprotect certain fundamental interests against loss or compromise. It\ndoes not make one a risk averse person, but instead normally it is\nentirely rational to purchase auto liability, health, home, and life\ninsurance against accident or calamity. The original position is such\na situation writ large. Even if one knew in the original position that\nthe citizen one represents enjoys taking risks, this would still not\nbe a reason to gamble with his or her rights, liberties and starting\nposition in society. For if the risktaker were born into a\ntraditional, repressive, or fundamentalist society, she might well\nhave little opportunity for taking the kinds of risks, such as\ngambling, that she normally enjoys. It is rational then even for\nrisktakers to choose conservatively in the original position and\nguarantee their future opportunities to gamble or otherwise take\nrisks. \nHarsanyi and other orthodox Bayesians contend that maximin is an\nirrational decision rule, and provide ample examples. But examples do\nnot suffice here; simply because maximin is under many circumstances\nirrational does not mean that it is never rational. No doubt\nmaximin is an irrational strategy under most circumstances of\nchoice uncertainty, particularly under circumstances where we will\nhave future opportunities to recoup our potential losses and choose\nagain. But these are not the circumstances of the original position;\nonce the rules of justice are decided, they apply in perpetuity, and\nthere is no opportunity to renegotiate or escape the situation. One\nwho relies on the equiprobability assumption in choosing principles of\njustice in the original position is being foolishly reckless given the\ngravity of choice at stake. It is not being risk-averse, but rather\nentirely rational to refuse to gamble with one’s basic\nliberties, fair equal opportunities and adequate resources needed to\npursue one’s most cherished ends and commitments, simply for the\nsake of gaining the marginally greater social powers, income and\nwealth that might be available to some in a society governed entirely\nby the principle of utility. \nRawls exhibits the force of the maximin argument in discussing liberty\nof conscience. He says (TJ, sect. 33) that a person who is willing to\njeopardize the right to hold and practice his or her conscientious\nreligious, philosophical and moral convictions, all for the sake of\ngaining uncertain added benefits via the principle of utility, does\nnot know what it means to have conscientious beliefs, or at least does\nnot take such beliefs seriously (TJ 207–08/181–82). A\nrational person with convictions about what gives life meaning is not\nwilling to negotiate with and gamble away the right to hold and\nexpress those convictions and the freedom to act on them. After all\nwhat could be the basis for negotiation, for what could matter more\nthan the objects of one’s most sincere convictions and\ncommitments? Some people (e.g. some nihilists) may not have\nany conscientious convictions, and are simply willing to act\non impulse or on whatever thoughts and desires they happen to have at\nthe moment. But behind the veil of ignorance no one knows whether he\nor she is such a person, and there are no grounds for making this\nassumption. Knowing general facts about human propensities and\nsociability, the parties must take into account that they may well\nhave convictions and values and commitments they are unwilling to\ncompromise. (Besides, the nihilist should want to protect his or her\nfreedom to be a nihilist, to protect against ending up in an\nintolerant religious society.) Thus it remains irrational to\njeopardize basic liberties by choosing the principle of utility\ninstead of the principles of justice. \nNone of this is to say that maximin is normally a rational choice\nstrategy. Rawls himself says it “is not, in general, a suitable\nguide for choices under uncertainty” (TJ 153). As we see below\nin Section 6.4, it is not even a rational strategy in the original\nposition when the alternatives for choice guarantee basic liberties,\nequal opportunities, and a social minimum, unlike the principle of\nutility. Rawls relies upon the maximin argument mainly to argue for\nthe first principle of justice and a guaranteed social minimum. Other\narguments are needed to justify the difference principle. \nThere are three additional arguments Rawls makes to support justice as\nfairness (all in TJ, sect. 29). Each of these depends on the concept\nof a “well-ordered society.” The ideal of a\nwell-ordered society is Rawls’s development of social\ncontract doctrine. It is a society in which (1) everyone willingly\naccepts and affirms the same principles of justice; (2) these\nprinciples are successfully realized in basic social institutions,\nincluding laws and conventions, and are generally complied with by\ncitizens; and (3) reasonable persons are morally motivated to comply\nby their sense of justice – they want to do what justice\nrequires of them (TJ 4–5, §69). Rawls says at various\npoints that a well-ordered society is a “perfectly just\nsociety.” (TJ 9) The parties in the original position choose\nprinciples that are to govern a perfectly just well-ordered society\nwhere everyone agrees, complies with, and wants to comply with its\nprinciples of justice. There are then two sides to Rawls’s\nsocial contract. The parties in the original position have the task of\nagreeing to principles that all rationally can accept under the\ncircumstances of the original position. But their rational choice is\npartially determined by the principles that free and equal moral\npersons in a well ordered society reasonably can accept and agree to\nas the basic principles governing their social and political\nrelations. \nThe assumption of reasonable persons’ “strict\ncompliance” with principles of justice within a well-ordered\nsociety is part of what Rawls calls “ideal theory,” which\nis characteristic of social contract views. (Kant’s ideal of a\nKingdom of Ends involves a similar assumption in ideal theory.) To\ndetermine the most appropriate principles of justice to govern\nrelations among ourselves, we are discover the principles that would\nbe generally accepted and endorsed among free and equal reasonable and\nrational persons with a sense of justice in an ideal society where\nthese principles were fully realized and generally complied with. The\nassumption of strict compliance is made within contract views to\ninsure the integrity of the agreement: it means the parties will not\nrenege but can rely on each other to act according to the principles\nagreed to and that their agreement is not in vain (TJ 145). More\ngenerally, Rawls says the same principles chosen for an ideal society\nare to be applied to assess the justice of institutions and laws in\nour own non-ideal world where societies and individuals only partially\ncomply with them (if at all). Principles of justice that apply to an\nideal society lay bare how much our current circumstances depart from\nideal justice; injustices are to be “identified by the extent of\nthe deviation from perfect justice.” (TJ 216). Moreover, ideal\ntheory provides a target for non-ideal theory; the principles of\njustice “define then a perfectly just scheme [and] set up an aim\nto guide the course of social reform.” (TJ 215) Finally, ideal\ntheory provides a way to discover universal principles that apply to\nall social worlds and circumstances. By determining the principles of\njustice that would apply in an ideal society, we can claim to have\ndiscovered objective universal principles that can be applied to every\nsociety to ascertain the degree of injustice and to guide reform. \nRawls’s and other ideal theories recently have been criticized\nas unnecessary to address injustice (Sen 2009, Appiah 2017), or as\nunrealistic, unduly demanding, and not relevant to the kinds of\npersons we really are or to our non-ideal circumstances (Gaus 2016,\nSchmidtz 2018); or ideal theory is said to be distracting,\nideological, irrelevant to, or incapable of addressing past and\nenduring racial and other injustices in our society (Mills 2016).\nSome of these arguments are motivated by political conservatism or\npessimism about human capacities for change (Gaus 2016, Schmidtz\n2018). Others are motivated by an alternative account of the impartial\npoint of view that involves consequentialist ranking of the justice of\nstates of affairs instead of agreement on general principles of\njustice for the basic structure (Sen 2009); and some arguments against\nideal theory are accompanied by claims of Rawls’s purported\nindifference and refusal to seriously address questions of corrective\njustice for past and continuing injustices against racial and other\nminorities (Mills 2016). These are complex criticisms and the debate\nover ideal theory warrants far more discussion than can be given here.\n(See Simmons 2010 on Rawls, and Stemplowska & Swift 2012 more\ngenerally for helpful discussions of ideal theory.) \nNow to return to Rawls’s arguments for his principles of\njustice. The first of Rawls’s three arguments highlights the\nidea that choice in the original position is an agreement,\nand involves certain “strains of commitment,”\nassumed by all to comply with the principles they agree to (TJ\n176f./153f. and CP 250ff). Knowing that they are required to choose\nprinciples for a well-ordered society, the parties must choose\nprinciples that they sincerely believe they will be able to accept,\nendorse and willingly comply with under conditions where these\nprinciples are generally enforced. For reasons to be discussed\nshortly, Rawls says this condition favors agreement on the principles\nof justice over utilitarianism and other alternatives. \nBut first, consider the frequent objection that there is no genuine\nagreement at all in the original position, for the thick veil of\nignorance deprives the parties of all bases for bargaining (cf. TJ,\n139–40/120–21 rev.). In the absence of bargaining, it is\nsaid, there can be no contract. For contracts must involve a quid\npro quo—something given for something received (called\n‘consideration’ at common law). The parties in the OP\ncannot bargain without knowing what they have to offer or to gain in\nexchange. So (the objection continues) Rawls’s original position\ndoes not involve a real contract; rather, since the parties are all\n“described in the same way,” it is simply the rational\nchoice of one person (see Hampton, 1980, 334; see also Gauthier, 1985,\n203). \nIn response, not all contracts involve bargaining or are of the nature\nof economic transactions. Some involve a mutual pledge and commitment\nto shared purposes and principles. Marriage contracts, or agreements\namong friends or the members of a religious, benevolent, or political\nassociation are often of this nature. For example, the Mayflower\nCompact was a “covenant” to “combine ourselves\ntogether into a civil body politic” charged with making and\nadministering “just and equal laws…for the general\ngood.” The agreement in Rawls’s original position is more\nof this nature. Even though ignorant of particular facts about\nthemselves, the parties in fact do give something in exchange for\nsomething received: they all exchange their mutual commitment to\naccept and abide by the principles of justice and to uphold just\ninstitutions once they enter their well-ordered society. Each agrees\nonly on condition others do too, and all tie themselves into social\nand political relations in perpetuity. Their agreement is final, and\nthey will not permit its renegotiation should circumstances turn out\nto be different than some hoped for. Their mutual commitment to\njustice is reflected by the fact that once these principles become\nembodied in institutions there are no legal means that permit anyone\nto depart from the terms of their agreement. As a result, the parties\nhave to take seriously the legal obligations and social sanctions they\nwill incur as a result of their agreement, for there is no going back\nto the initial situation. So if they do not sincerely believe that\nthey can accept the requirements of a conception of justice and\nconform their actions and life plans accordingly, then these are\nstrong reasons to avoid choosing those principles. It would not be\nrational for a party to take risks, falsely assuming that if he ends\nup badly, he can violate at will the terms of agreement or later\nregain his initial situation and renegotiate terms of cooperation (see\nFreeman, 1990; Freeman, 2007b, 180–182). \nRawls gives special poignancy to this mutual commitment of the parties\nby making it a condition that the parties cannot choose and agree to\nprinciples in bad faith; they have to be able, not simply to live with\nand grudgingly accept, but instead to willingly endorse the principles\nof justice as members of society. Essential to Rawls’s argument\nfor stability is the assumption of everyone’s willing\ncompliance with requirements of justice. This is a feature of a\nwell-ordered society. The parties are assumed to have a sense of\njustice; indeed the development and exercise of it is one of their\nfundamental interests. Hence they must choose principles that that\nthey can not only accept and live with, but which are responsive to\ntheir sense of justice and they can unreservedly endorse. Given these\nconditions on choice, a party cannot take risks with principles he\nknows he will have difficulty complying with voluntarily. He would be\nmaking an agreement in bad faith, and this is ruled out by the\nconditions of the original position.  \nRawls contends that these “strains of commitment” created\nby the parties’ agreement strongly favor the principles of\njustice over the principles of utility and other teleological views.\nFor everyone’s freedom and basic needs are met by the principles\nof justice because of their egalitarian nature. Given the lack of\nthese guarantees under the principle of utility, it is much more\ndifficult for those who end up worse off in a utilitarian society to\nwillingly accept their situation and commit themselves to the utility\nprinciple. It is a rare person indeed who can freely and without\nresentment sacrifice his or her life prospects so that those who are\nbetter off can have even greater comforts, privileges, and powers.\nThis is too much to demand of our capacities for human benevolence. It\nrequires a kind of commitment that people cannot make in good faith,\nfor who could willingly support laws that are so detrimental to\noneself and the people one cares about most that they must sacrifice\ntheir fundamental interests for the sake of those more advantaged?\nBesides, why should we encourage such subservient dispositions and the\naccompanying lack of self-respect? The principles of justice, by\ncontrast, conform better with everyone’s interests, their desire\nfor self-respect and their natural moral capabilities to reciprocally\nrecognize and respect others’ legitimate interests while freely\npromoting their own good. The strains of commitment incurred by\nagreement in the original position provide strong reasons for the\nparties to choose the principles of justice and reject the risks\ninvolved in choosing the principles of average or aggregate utility.\n \nRawls’s strains-of-commitment argument explicitly relies upon a\nrarely noted feature of his argument: it involves in effect two\nsocial contracts. First, hypothetical agents situated equally in\nthe original position unanimously agree to principles of justice. This\nagreement has attracted the most attention from Rawls’s critics.\nBut the parties’ hypothetical agreement in the original position\nis patterned on the general acceptability of a conception of justice\nby free and equal persons in a well-ordered society. Rawls says,\n“The reason for invoking the concept of a contract in the\noriginal position lies in its correspondence with the features of a\nwell-ordered society [which] require…that everyone accepts, and\nknows that the others accept, the same principles of justice”\n(CP 250). In order for the hypothetical parties in the original\nposition to agree on principles of justice, there must be a high\nlikelihood that real persons, given human nature and general facts\nabout social and economic cooperation, can also agree and act on the\nsame principles, and that a society structured by these principles is\nfeasible and can endure. This is the stability requirement\nreferred to earlier. One conception of justice is relatively more\nstable than another the more willing people are to observe its\nrequirements under conditions of a well-ordered society. Assuming that\neach conception of justice has a corresponding society that is as\nwell-ordered as can be according to its terms, the stability question\nraised in Theory is: Which conception of justice is more\nlikely to engage the moral sensibilities and sense of justice of free\nand equal persons as well as affirm their good? This requires an\ninquiry into moral psychology and the human good, which takes up most\nof Part III of A Theory of Justice. \nRawls makes two arguments from the original position that invoke the\nstability requirement, the arguments (1) from publicity and (2) from\nself-respect. \n(1) The argument from publicity: Rawls contends that utilitarianism,\nperfectionism, and other “teleological” conceptions are\nnot likely to be freely acceptable to many citizens when made fully\npublic under the conditions of a well-ordered society. Recall the\npublicity condition discussed earlier: A feature of a\nwell-ordered society is that its regulative principles of justice are\npublicly known and appealed to as a basis for deciding laws and\njustifying basic institutions. A conception of justice that cannot\nmaintain the stability of a well-ordered society that satisfies the\npublicity condition is to be rejected by the parties in the original\nposition. Rawls contends that under the publicity condition justice as\nfairness generally engages citizens’ sense of justice and\nremains more stable than utilitarianism (TJ 177f./154f.). For public\nknowledge that reasons of maximum average (or aggregate) utility\ndetermine the distribution of benefits and burdens would lead those\nworse-off to object to and resent their situation, and reject the\nprinciple of utility as the basic principle governing social\ninstitutions. After all, the well-being and interests of the least\nadvantaged, perhaps even their basic liberties, are being sacrificed\nfor the greater happiness of those who are already more fortunate and\nhave a greater share of primary social goods. It is too much to expect\nof human nature that people should freely acquiesce in and embrace\nsuch terms of cooperation. By contrast, the principles of justice are\ndesigned to advance reciprocally everyone’s position; those who\nare better off do not achieve their gains at the expense of the less\nadvantaged. “Since everyone’s good is affirmed, all\nacquire inclinations to uphold the scheme” (TJ, 177/155). It is\na feature of our moral psychology, Rawls contends, that we normally\ncome to form attachments to people and institutions that are concerned\nwith our good; moreover we tend to resent those persons and\ninstitutions that take unfair advantage of us and act contrary to our\ngood. Rawls argues at length in chapter 8 of Theory,\n§§70–75, that justice as fairness accords better than\nalternative principles with the reciprocity principles of moral\npsychology that are characteristic of human beings’ moral\ndevelopment.  \n(2) The argument from the social bases of self-respect: The publicity\ncondition is also crucial to Rawls’ fourth argument for the\nprinciples of justice, from the social bases of self-respect (TJ,\n178–82/155–59 rev.). These principles, when publicly\nknown, give greater support to citizens’ sense of\nself-respect than do utilitarian and perfectionist principles.\nRawls says self-respect is “perhaps the most important primary\ngood,” (TJ, 440/386 rev.) since few things seem worth doing if a\nperson has little sense of his or her own worth or no confidence in\nhis or her abilities to execute a worthwhile life plan. The parties in\nthe original position will then aim to choose principles that best\nsecure their sense of self-respect. Now being regarded by others as a\nfree and independent person of equal status with others is crucial to\nthe self-respect of persons who regard themselves as free and equal\nmembers of a democratic society. Justice as fairness, by affording and\nprotecting the priority of equal basic liberties and fair equal\nopportunities for all, secures the status of each as free and equal\ncitizens. For example, because of equal political liberties, there are\nno “passive citizens” who must depend on others to\npolitically protect their rights and interests; and with fair equal\nopportunities no one has grounds to experience the resentment that\ninevitably arises in societies where social positions are effectively\nclosed off to those less advantaged or less powerful. Moreover, the\nsecond principle secures adequate social powers and economic resources\nfor all so that they find the exercise of their equal basic liberties\nto be worthwhile. The second principle has the effect of making\ncitizens socially and economically independent, so that no one need be\nsubservient to the will of another. Citizens then can regard and\nrespect one another as equals, and not as masters or subordinates.\n(“Non-domination,” an idea central to contemporary\nRepublicanism, is then essential to citizens’ sense of\nself-respect in Rawls’s sense. See Pettit 1997.) Equal basic\nliberties, fair equal opportunities, and political and economic\nindependence are primary among the social bases of self-respect in a\ndemocratic society. The parties in the original position should then\nchoose the principles of justice over utilitarianism and other\nteleological views both to secure their sense of self-respect, and to\nprocure the same for others, thereby guaranteeing greater overall\nstability.  \nRawls substantially relies on the publicity condition to argue against\nutilitarianism and perfectionism. He says publicity “arises\nnaturally from a contractarian standpoint” (TJ, 133/115 rev.).\nIn Theory he puts great weight on publicity ultimately\nbecause he thinks that giving people knowledge of the moral bases of\ncoercive laws and the principles governing society is a condition of\nfully acknowledging and respecting them as free and responsible\nrational moral agents. With publicity of first principles, people have\nknowledge of the real reasons for their social and political relations\nand the formative influences of the basic structure on their\ncharacters, plans and prospects. In a well-ordered society with a\npublic conception of justice, there is no need for an “esoteric\nmorality” that must be confined “to an enlightened\nfew” (as Sidgwick says of utilitarianism, Sidgwick 1907 [1981],\n490). Moreover, public principles of justice can serve agents in their\npractical reasoning and provide democratic citizens a common basis for\npolitical argument and justification. These considerations underlie\nRawls’s later contention that having knowledge of the principles\nthat determine the bases of social relations is a precondition of\nindividuals’ freedom.( CP 325f.) Rawls means in part that\npublicity of society’s fundamental principles is a condition of\ncitizens’ exercise of the powers and abilities that enable them\nto take full responsibility for their lives. Full publicity is then a\ncondition of the political, rational, and moral autonomy of persons,\nwhich are all significant values according to justice as fairness. \nRawls’s second principle of justice says: \nThe difference principle (the first part of the second principle,\nthrough (a)), addresses differences or inequalities in the\ndistribution of the primary goods of income and wealth and powers and\npositions of office and responsibility. It basically requires that a\nsociety is to institute the economic system that would make the least\nadvantaged class better off than they would be in any other feasible\neconomic system, compatible with maintaining citizens equal basic\nliberties and fair equality of opportunity. Rawls defines “least\nadvantaged” as those with the least share of the primary goods\nof income and wealth, and powers and positions of office. He also\nassumes the least advantaged are “fully cooperating” (JF\n179), and “full and active participants in society” (CP,\n259) who do their fair share in contributing to economic activity and\nthe social product. Rawls thus regards “distributive\nshares” under the difference principle as the benefits that\naccrue to persons for doing their part in socially productive\ncooperation. The class of unskilled workers receiving minimum income\nsatisfies his definition of least advantaged (TJ 98/84 rev.). Those\nwho are able but unwilling to work “must somehow support\nthemselves” (JF 179; cf. PL 182n). Disability payments to meet\nthe needs of severely handicapped citizens who are permanently unable\nto work are not ascertained by reference to the difference principle\nfor Rawls, but instead are to be determined by principles of\nassistance, which he leaves unspecified (PL 272n). As a principle for\nstructuring basic economic institutions on grounds of reciprocity, the\ndifference principle itself is not an appropriate principle for\ncompensating mental and physical handicaps and other disabilities. \nRawls contends it is an empirical question which economic system\nsatisfies the difference principle. He claims however that under ideal\nconditions of a well-ordered society, where the principles of justice\nare generally accepted, either a “property-owning\ndemocracy” or liberal (market) socialism are most likely to\nsatisfy the difference principle, to the exclusion of laissez-faire\ncapitalism, command economy communism, and even the modern capitalist\nwelfare state. Property-owning democracy (POD) differs from the\ncapitalist welfare state mainly in that it is not marked by such broad\ndiscrepancies in income and wealth, but instead provides for\nwidespread private ownership of productive wealth and means of\nproduction, including opportunities for greater freedom and control in\nthe workplace. Thus, akin to market socialism, POD is not marked by\nsharp divisions between capital and labor but manifests broad\ndistribution of economic powers and positions, as well as a more equal\ndistribution of income and wealth (see JF 135–140,\n158–162, 178). For these reasons, and since a property-owning\ndemocracy also secures the fair value of equal political liberties and\nfair equality of opportunities, a property-owning democracy provides a\nmore secure basis for citizens’ sense of self-respect (the\nremaining primary social good covered by the difference principle in\npart) than does welfare-state capitalism (see Freeman 2007b,\n219–235; Freeman 2013). \nRawls relies on the maximin rule of choice to argue against the\nprinciple of utility. Since the maximin rule and the difference\nprinciple both require maximizing the minimum position, it seems\nnatural to assume that the maximin choice rule leads directly to\nchoice of the difference principle in the original position. Though\nRawls might have conveyed this impression in Theory\n(§26), he later says that in fact the maximin rule alone cannot\nbe used to justify the difference principle (JF, 43n, 94–95).\nFor when the difference principle is compared with those “mixed\nconceptions” of economic justice that protect basic liberties\nand provide some form of equal opportunities and a social minimum,\nthen the third condition for applying maximin is not satisfied (see\nabove, sect. VI,A). The third condition for the maximin rule implies\nthat there can only be one acceptable alternative for choice.\nIf there is a second alternative the consequences of which rational\npersons can live with and accept if they end up in the least\nadvantaged position (for example it protects basic liberties and\nopportunities, and guarantees a social safety net), then the maximin\nrule is not a rational rule of decision. For then there is no\nlikelihood of grave risks to one’s future prospects.  \n“Mixed conceptions” of justice (see TJ §49) protect\nthe basic liberties, and in most cases provide equal opportunities and\nguarantee a social minimum of income and wealth sufficient to meet\nbasic needs. But they determine the social minimum in some way other\nthan the difference principle. For example, the social minimum may be\ndetermined by balancing citizens’ moral intuitions regarding a\ndecent minimum; or according the rule that the adequate social minimum\nis one-third of the median market income in society; or that it is\nwhatever amount that is needed to maintain social stability and avoid\ndisruption by the less advantaged. Once the social minimum is\nsatisfied mixed conceptions might then rely upon the principle of\naverage utility (or some alternative) to decide economic policies and\ndistributions. Rawls calls this the “principle of restricted\nutility,” (JF 120, 126) since the pursuit of social utility is\nrestricted by the basic liberties, fair opportunities, and a fixed\nsocial minimum. This is one of several possible mixed conceptions that\ncombine the first principle of justice with a principle of\ndistributive justice with a social minimum other than the difference\nprinciple (TJ, 124/107 rev.). Rawls apparently regards the capitalist\nwelfare state as based in mixed conceptions that incorporate such a\nprinciple of restricted utility (JF 120–130, 139–140). \nRawls concedes that “mixed conceptions are much more difficult\nto argue against than the principle of utility,” since\n“the strong arguments from liberty cannot be used as\nbefore” (TJ, 316/278 rev.). He discusses mixed conceptions in\nTheory, §49, and devotes more attention to them later in\nJustice as Fairness: A Restatement (§§34–38).\nRawls provides several considerations or “grounds” that\nshould lead the parties in the original position to agree on the\ndifference principle – publicity, stability, and reciprocity\n– and he adds several more specific arguments that speak against\nchoice of the principle of restricted utility (TJ sect.49; JF\nsect.38). Mention has already been made of his argument (TJ sect.29)\nthat the difference principle affirms the self-respect of the least\nadvantaged since, unlike the principle of utility, it treats them as\nends in themselves and not as means to the greater well-being of the\nmore advantaged. Though still relevant, the force of this argument\nfrom self-respect is not as strong when the difference principle is\ncompared with a principle of restricted utility that guarantees a\nsocial minimum. \nThe main argument in favor of the difference principle seems to depend\non a strong idea of reciprocity (JF §36). In a society\nstructured by the difference principle gains to those more advantaged\nare never made at the expense of those less advantaged; instead, any\ngains to the more advantaged always benefit also the least advantaged,\nand do so more than any other alternative measure. By contrast\nrestricted utility, even if it provides a social minimum, still\npermits disadvantages and losses to the worst off so that those better\noff may prosper; any degree of inequality is allowed in the name of\nmaximizing utility so long as it does not violate the social minimum.\nSuch a situation, Rawls contends, would be morally unacceptable to\nfree and equal persons in a well-ordered society, and is rationally\nunacceptable to the parties in the original position. \nThere are different ways to conceive of an economic system based in\nreciprocity. Even a laissez-faire entitlement system of free transfer\nand exchange that satisfies Pareto efficiency satisfies reciprocity in\na weak sense (assuming the absence of negative externalities) since\neveryone is presumably made better off by the exchanges and transfers\nthey make. But the Pareto principle and laissez-faire entitlement\nprinciples are compatible with enormous gains to the more advantaged\nwhile the least advantaged gain only minimally, if at all. This is\n“trickle-down,” where the poor in effect cannot advance\nunless the rich maximally benefit, and where benefits to the rich need\nnot benefit the poor at all. The kind of reciprocity provided by the\nprinciple of restricted utility is more robust than laissez-faire and\nthe Pareto principle since it guarantees a social minimum. Everyone\nhas a stake in the economic system at least to the degree that it\nmeets the basic economic needs of all. But, beyond this point wealth\nand income are generated and distributed so as to maximize overall\nwealth and therewith (presumably) overall utility. Further gains to\nthose better off need not advance the position of the least\nadvantaged, and indeed sometimes may come at their expense so long as\nthe social minimum is maintained. \nThe “deeper idea of reciprocity” (JF 124) implicit in the\ndifference principle has just the opposite tendencies: the more\nadvantaged may not gain at any point unless their gains benefit the\nleast advantaged and benefit them maximally, better than any\nalternative arrangement of institutions. The best way to understand\nthe deeper idea of reciprocity Rawls incorporates into the difference\nprinciple is by referring to figure 6 in Theory (sect. 13)\nand figure 1 in Justice as Fairness (p.62). The difference\nprinciple requires the distribution of powers, prerogatives, and\neconomic resources that put the least advantage on the highest point\non the efficient production curve, D, which is the point that is\nclosest to an equal distribution. At D and all prior points on the\ncurve, improvements to the most advantaged are always accompanied by\nimprovements to the least advantaged and vice versa. Hence with all\nincrements to social output, no one gains at any point at the expense\nof the other. This relationship of reciprocity does not hold at points\nto the right of D, where further gains to the more advantaged may\nincrease aggregate wealth and utility, but come at the expense of the\nless advantaged. \nWhat bearing does this have on choice in the original position? Even\nif the deeper reciprocity achieved by the difference principle seems\nmorally appealing to us, the parties are not similarly motivated by\nmoral intuitions of fairness. They must be moved to agree on the\ndifference principle for rational considerations alone. So why should\nthe parties in the original position care about the deeper reciprocity\nachieved by the difference principle? Why wouldn’t it be\nrational for them to agree to a more superficial reciprocity, as\nallowed by restricted utility, thereby taking a chance that they might\nbe among the affluent in the capitalist welfare state? After all, if\nthey end up among the least advantaged, they may only be moderately\nworse off than they would have been under the difference\nprinciple. \nThe reasons that speak in favor of the parties’ rational choice\nof the difference principle are their higher-order interest in\ndeveloping their capacities for justice, their concern for their\nself-respect, their concern for stability, and the strains of\ncommitment. Compare the difference principle with the principle of\nrestricted utility: Once the social minimum is met, restricted utility\ndoes not guarantee that the worse off will benefit in any way from\nfurther gains to those better off. Quite the contrary, further gains\nto more advantaged may even disadvantage the less advantaged—for\nexample, a falling minimal wage rate in the face of an increased\nsupply of labor results in a greater share going to capital, which may\nbenefit owners and middle class consumers but not the less advantaged\nworkers. With restricted utility there is no consistent and continuing\ntendency toward reciprocity of benefits, for once the social minimum\nis satisfied the less advantaged are as likely to gain nothing as to\nbenefit from further gains to those better off.  \nRawls’s conjecture is that in the capitalist welfare state\nstructured by restricted utility, the less advantaged are likely to\nbecome dispirited, resentful, and frustrated with their situation, for\nthey know that their well-being is neglected and often intentionally\nsacrificed so that the majority of citizens may prosper. While\nstability is maintained among the less advantaged as a modus\nvivendi, still they are likely to withdraw from active\nparticipation in politics and public life; for they justifiably feel\nleft behind by society and no longer see themselves as having a stake\nin increasing social prosperity or as enjoying a respected position in\npublic life. This all-too-familiar phenomenon in the modern capitalist\nwelfare-state is evident from the striking lack of political\nparticipation by the poorest members of our society. It may be that\nwelfare-state capitalism is stable, but it is the stability of\nindifference or hopelessness among the less advantaged, not\nstability for the right reasons, which is grounded in equal\ncitizens’ affirmation of social institutions out of their sense\nof justice (PL xlii, 391). Due to their lack of self-respect, and the\nexcessive demands the capitalist welfare-state places on their moral\nsensibilities and capacities for justice, the least advantaged are\nunable to willingly affirm the organizing principles of society on\ngrounds of their sense of justice. The principle of restricted utility\nthen places excessive strains of commitment on the worse off, and\nundermines their sense of self-respect, causing them to be resentful\nof their situation. Moreover, restricted utility invites continuing\ndisagreement over the size of the social minimum, since there is no\ncriterion other than citizens’ differing views regarding what is\nneeded to satisfy the basic needs of the least advantaged. So, as is\ncharacteristic of the capitalist welfare state, there will be\ncontinual disagreement on a decent minimum and continual efforts by\nthe more advantaged to reduce the social minimum. The difference\nprinciple by contrast provides a definite standard for determining the\nsocial minimum. Finally, citizens’ higher-order interest in the\nfull development and effective exercise of their capacities for a\nsense of justice are not well served by restricted utility, since it\nfails to achieve economic reciprocity and the social bases of\nself-respect to a significant degree for all citizens. Because of\ntheir interests in fully exercising their moral and rational\ncapacities, their sense of self-respect, and their concern for\nstability, the parties in the original position cannot in good faith\nrationally affirm restricted utility and the capitalist welfare state\nwhen they have the alternative of choosing the difference principle\n(cf. JF, 128–129). This seems to be Rawls’s main argument\nfor the difference principle from the original position. \nNow that the arguments for the principles of justice have been\noutlined, this is a good place to consider the objection that the\noriginal position is not necessary or even morally relevant. There are\nat least two notable versions of this argument; the more common one\nthat was initially set forth by Hume will be discussed in the final\nsection. Here I outline a more sympathetic version of the objection by\na fellow contractualist, T.M. Scanlon. \nAs discussed earlier, Rawls depicts two social contracts: rational\nagreement among interested parties in the original position\ncorresponds to reasonable agreement among members of a well-ordered\nsociety motivated by their sense of justice. This correspondence\nsuggests, T.M. Scanlon says, that, rather than the original position,\n“the point of view which the theory takes as fundamental is\nactually that of a person in society” (Scanlon, 1975, 177).\nScanlon contends that since the arguments in the original position\nexcept maximin depend upon general acceptance of the principles of\njustice among reasonable persons in a well-ordered society, the\noriginal position is not necessary. Moreover, the idea of\nself-interested agreement behind the veil of ignorance distracts from\nthe real justification for the principles of justice—that they\nare reasonably acceptable and could be justified to persons with a\nsense of justice in a well-ordered society (Scanlon, 1982, 127).\nScanlon’s own contractualism relies upon a similar idea of\nmorally motivated persons’ agreement on a system of rules for\nthe regulation of behavior that no one could reasonably reject (1982,\n110). He abjures the idea of rational choice and agreement by\ninterested parties from an original position or other impartial\nperspective.  \nRawls says that one reason for denying the parties information about\nthemselves and imposing the veil of ignorance is that for a contract\ntheory to rely only on an informal idea of reasonable acceptability\nand agreement among persons situated in society is less precise and\nits results less definite. If full information of particular facts\nwere allowed the parties, “only a few rather obvious cases could\nbe decided. A conception of justice based on unanimity in these\ncircumstances would indeed be weak and trivial” (TJ 141). Here\none might reply that Rawls is shortchanging the force of his own\narguments, from the strains of commitment, publicity, self-respect,\nand reciprocity, all of which depend on the point of view of\nreasonable persons in a well-ordered society. Perhaps Rawls thought\nthe maximin argument was needed to complement these arguments. In any\ncase the main objection Scanlon raises seems to be that purely\nrational choice and agreement based in individuals’ interests is\nnot representative of or relevant to moral justification of\nprinciples. The (self-) interested choice of rational individuals,\neven if behind the veil of ignorance, bears little resemblance or\nrelationship to moral judgment and justification among reasonable\npersons in society. Joshua Cohen has raised similar objections (J.\nCohen 2015).  \nThe answer to this objection (if there is one) is too complex to deal\nwith here. It might begin with Rawls’s assumption of the\ncircumstances of justice, his assumption that questions of social\njustice arise due to the conflict of individuals’ legitimate\npursuit of their individual interests. Since justice for Rawls\nconcerns the fair terms of social cooperation among persons with\ndifferent interests and conceptions of their good, he evidently thinks\ntheir “essential interests,” – those essential to\nthe rational pursuit of their good, including the moral powers and\nprimary social goods – should be represented in the agreement on\nprinciples of justice that structure their social relations. These\ninterests are especially relevant to agreement on principles of\njustice for the basic structure, for the primary goods are what these\nprinciples distribute.  \nSecond, like Kant, Rawls regards moral principles as the imposition of\nreasonable constraints on individuals’ rational deliberations\nand choices in pursuit of their interests. This is the “priority\nof right” over the good (TJ 31f./27f.), which for Rawls\nrepresents the structure of practical reasoning of moral persons. As\nKant (according to Rawls, LHMP and CP 497ff.) seeks to model the\nstructure of practical reasoning in the categorical imperative\nprocedure, so Rawls seeks to model the priority of right over the good\nin the original position by the reasonable constraints imposed on\nrational individuals’ choice of principles that equitably\npromote their good.  \nThird, Rawls is deeply concerned (again like Kant) with demonstrating\nthat the Right and the Good are “congruent.” Congruence in\nTheory means, first, that, assuming the most reasonable\nprinciples are established, justice and the corresponding sense of\njustice are compatible with our rational pursuit of our individual\ninterests. Moreover, justice and the exercise of their capacities for\njustice can be a fundamental good for moral persons, worth pursuing\nand incorporating into their life plans for their own sake (TJ 398/350\nrev.; 567–75/496–505 rev.). (See also, Freeman, 2003,\n277–315.) These considerations are all relevant to Rawls’s\nreasons for “modeling” reasonable agreement on principles\namong members of a well-ordered society by the original position and\nthe parties’ rational agreement behind the veil of\nignorance. \nIn The Law of Peoples, his essay on international justice,\nRawls appeals to the original position a second time, to argue for\nprinciples of justice that hold among different political societies,\nor “peoples.” Rawls contends that a theory of social and\npolitical justice requires principles of justice to regulate the\nforeign relations of well-ordered societies with one another. He calls\nthese principles “the Law of Peoples.” Since he conceives\nof the Law of Peoples as regulating relationships between political\nsocieties, he imagines an agreement, not among all the individuals in\nthe world’s population, but, first, among the representatives of\nliberal democratic well-ordered societies. In this agreement among\n(liberal) peoples, each political society is to be regarded as equal,\nwith equal rights of participation in this agreement; they each have\nthe same number of representatives, no matter the size of their\npopulation. To represent the equality of peoples and guarantee\nfairness of the agreement, Rawls once again utilizes the original\nposition as a hypothetical situation from which representatives of\nwell-ordered liberal peoples decide principles of international\njustice. The parties to this agreement are once again to be regarded\nas ignorant of particular facts about their societies, including the\nsize of their population, their natural resources and level of\nproduced wealth, their social and ethnic cultures, and other\nparticular facts, knowledge of which might result in unfair bargaining\nadvantages and lead to an unfair agreement. The representatives of\neach society are motivated by their fundamental interest in\nmaintaining the justice of their own societies, as this is defined by\njustice as fairness or some other liberal conception. \nRawls contends that the Law of Peoples that would be agreed to among\nrepresentatives of “free and democratic peoples” from the\noriginal position consists of (at least) eight principles (LP 38).\nThese principles, except for the last requiring a duty of assistance\nowed to “burdened peoples,” are familiar: They require\nrespect for peoples’ freedom and independence; the obligation to\nobserve treaties and undertakings; the equality of peoples; a duty of\nnon-intervention; a right of self-defense and no right to instigate\nwar except in self-defense; a duty to honor human rights; a duty to\nobserve restrictions on the conduct of wars; and finally the duty to\nassist people living under unfavorable conditions that prevent their\nhaving a just or decent political and social regime (LP, 37). Rawls\nfurther maintains that non-liberal but “decent” peoples\nwould also agree to these same principles in an original position.\nDecent peoples, though normally hierarchical and non-democratic, still\nrespect human rights of everyone, and have a common good idea of\njustice that benefits all members of society. Rawls’s list of\nhuman rights include a right to life, including rights to means of\nsubsistence and security; to liberty, including freedom from servitude\nand forced occupation and a certain degree of freedom of conscience to\ninsure freedom of religion and of thought; a right to hold personal\nproperty; and to formal equality, that similar cases be treated\nsimilarly (LP, 65). Liberal peoples have a duty to observe the Law of\nPeoples in relations with decent peoples, even though decent peoples\nare not democratic or otherwise wholly just in a liberal sense in\ntheir internal organization and towards their members. But the Law of\nPeoples, including the duty of non-intervention, does not entirely\napply in interactions with “outlaw regimes,” those which\ndo not respect the human rights or good of their own people or of\nnon-members. Liberal and decent societies may intervene in their\ninternal affairs in order to protect the human rights of their members\nand others.  \nRawls’s Law of Peoples has been widely criticized since it does\nnot allow for an original position agreement among all the\nworld’s members but only among their societies’\nrepresentatives. Nor (a related criticism) does Rawls envision\nagreement upon a global principle of distributive justice, such as a\nglobal difference principle, nor even a global tax on more advantaged\nsocieties’ wealth or natural resources, to be redistributed to\nless advantaged societies (see, e.g., Beitz, 1999; Pogge 1989, 2007).\nThese are complicated issues that cannot be addressed here. (For a\ndefense of Rawls, see Freeman 2007a, ch. 8–9 and 2007b ch.10.)\nIn general, Rawls’s positions on these issues are grounded on an\nassumption of the political and institutional bases of distributive\njustice, and the fundamental role of society and its basic social\ninstitutions in the development of our natural and moral capacities\nand in determining our characters, aims, and future prospects. \nIn A Theory of Justice Rawls provides a “Kantian\nInterpretation” of the original position and the principles of\njustice (TJ §§ 40, 78). The Kantian interpretation is a\nprecursor to Rawls’s Kantian constructivism (CP, ch. 16), and\nhis later political constructivism (PL, ch.3). Rawls says that for\nKant, “a person is acting autonomously when the principles of\nhis action are chosen by him as the most adequate possible expression\nof his nature as a free and equal rational being” (TJ 252/222).\nWhat is missing from Kant, Rawls says, is an attempt to show how moral\nprinciples express our nature. “This defect is made good [by]\nthe original position” (TJ 255 /224). The original position can\nbe interpreted as a “procedural interpretation” of our\nnature as free and equal rational beings, and therewith of\nKant’s conception of autonomy and the categorical imperative (TJ\n256 /226). For in the original position, because of the veil of\nignorance and other moral constraints, the parties’ choice is\nmade “independent of natural contingencies and accidental social\ncircumstances” (TJ 515/451); thus the principles of justice are\nnot chosen “heteronomously,” on the basis of our social\nposition, natural endowments, particular wants, or the particular kind\nof society we live in (TJ 252/222). Instead, the parties are all\nrepresented in the same way, as free and equal rational persons with a\ncapacity for a sense of justice who choose principles of justice\nsubject to all relevant moral conditions. Rawls says that the original\nposition might thus be regarded as incorporating “conditions\nthat best express their nature as free and equal rational\nbeings.” On a Kantian view, our moral nature is defined by the\nmoral powers, our capacities for practical reasoning, to be rational\nand reasonable. The moral powers are the relevant capacities of\npractical reasoning that relate to justice. “Acting autonomously\nis acting from principles that we would consent to as free and equal\nrational beings” (TJ 516/453). The description of the original\nposition expresses “what it means to be a free and equal\nrational being,” and even “resembles the point of view of\nnoumenal selves” (TJ 255–256/225). \nIn addition to expressing our autonomy, the original position is also\nobjective (TJ 587/514). For it requires that the parties adopt a\ncommon impartial standpoint and make a considered rational choice and\nagree under conditions that require them to abstract from their\nparticular interests and circumstances. Moreover, all are motivated by\nhigher-order interests in their moral powers, which represent their\n“nature as free and equal rational beings.” Finally, the\nOP is designed to incorporate all the relevant reasons and\nrestrictions on arguments for principles of social and political\njustice (TJ 18/16). In so far as the OP is an appropriately defined\nobjective point of view incorporating all relevant moral reasons and\nconditions on rational choice of principles of justice, and the\nparties therein come to a unanimous agreement, then, Rawls says, the\nprinciples agreed to are also objective (TJ 516–517/453).\nTogether with the universality requirement, we can infer from the\nobjectivity of the principles of justice that they apply to and are\nbinding on persons in all societies. As Rawls says of the original\nposition in concluding TJ, “to see our place in society from the\nperspective of this position is to see it sub specie\naeternitatis: it is to regard the human situation not only from\nall social but also all temporal points of view” (TJ 587/514).\n \nRawls affirms the objectivity and “correctness” of the\nprinciples of justice, and he says they are the “most\nreasonable” principles. But he does not say at any point that\nthe principles of justice are “true.” He does however say\nthat judgments based upon the principles of justice are true, and this\napplies to both particular judgments and to the moral rules of justice\nthat are required by the principles of justice (CP 355). These claims\nare implicit in Rawls’s Kantian constructivism. (It is\nnoteworthy that Kant himself did not say that the categorical\nimperative is true; instead he said it is “universally\nvalid.”) In general, constructivism in moral philosophy is a\nview about the possibility of the correctness of moral principles and\njudgment. “Realism” says that the correctness of moral\njudgments resides in their truth, and that truth of most fundamental\nmoral principles consists in their corresponding to a moral order (of\nmoral facts or objects) that is antecedent to reason and to principles\nof practical reasoning. Objectivity of moral judgment is then defined\nby realists as judgment made from a perspective of reasoning that is\nlikely to lead to discernment of these antecedent objects of truth. In\n“Kantian Constructivism in Moral Theory” (Lecture III, CP\n340ff.), Rawls discusses a version of realism found in Henry Sidgwick\nand G.E. Moore, “rational intuitionism,” which he\ncontrasts with moral constructivism.  \nKantian constructivism inverts the relationship realists see between\nobjectivity and truth; rather than objective judgments being grounded\nin the discernment of antecedent objects of truth, objectivity (of\njudgment) precedes the object (of truth). This means that at the level\nof fundamental moral principles the correctness of these principles\ndepends, not on their correspondence to a prior moral order, but on\ntheir following from (or being among) the fundamental principles of\npractical reasoning. The objectivity of judgment that is involved in\nreasoning from an objective perspective according to relevant\nprinciples of practical reasoning results in objective moral\nprinciples that are the bases for judgments of moral truth. The moral\nfacts that are the objects of these moral truths are not then prior\nto, but are the facts that are singled out as relevant by moral\nprinciples and principles of practical reasoning (CP 516).  \nAmong other advantages, moral constructivism relieves moral theory of\nthe burden of having to account for the correctness of moral judgments\nin terms of their correspondence to a mysterious domain of moral facts\n(natural or non-natural) that must exist prior to practical reasoning.\nConstructivism also enables Rawls to provide an account of the\nobjectivity of moral judgment and correctness of moral principles that\nis consistent with a Kantian idea of autonomy, In setting forth in\ndetail the manner in which the principles of justice are justified on\nthe basis of certain conceptions and principles that originate in\npractical reasoning itself, Rawls sees himself as having carried\nthrough with the Kantian aspiration of showing how moral principles of\njustice are the result of “reason giving principles to itself,\nout of its own resources.”  \nThe original position plays a crucial role in Kantian constructivism.\nRawls says the original position is a “procedure of\nconstruction” that specifies an objective point of view from\nwhich to derive objective principles of justice. Principles of justice\nare “constructed” on the basis of ideal conceptions of the\nperson and of society (‘ideas of reason’, in Kant’s\nsense). In Kantian constructivism (CP ch.16), Rawls alters the Kantian\ninterpretation’s idea of “our nature as free and equal\nrational beings,” into an ideal “conception of the\nperson,” regarded as a “free and equal moral\nperson,” with the two moral powers of practical reasoning. It is\nthis conception of the person, along with the ideal of social\ncooperation represented by a well-ordered society, that is\n“modeled” or “mirrored” by the original\nposition. In “Kantian Constructivism,” Lecture II, Rawls\nexplains how each of the relevant features of the original position\n(including the veil of ignorance and the description of the parties as\n“rational agents of construction”) “represent”\nin some fashion the ideal conception of the person and of society that\nunderwrite Kantian constructivism. Since the original position\npresumably represents all the relevant ideas and principles of\npractical reason, Rawls contends that whatever principles chosen\ntherein are objectively correct, as a matter of “pure procedural\njustice at the highest level” of practical reasoning. (See below\non the role of the original position in reflective equilibrium.) \nSubsequently, in Political Liberalism, Rawls\n“brackets” (he neither affirms nor denies) claims about\nthe nature and possibility of moral truth and universal objectivity of\nmoral judgments. Still, Rawls affirms “for political\npurposes” the objectivity of the original position and therewith\nof the principles of justice. Once again, the original position is set\nup to represent and model an ideal of persons and society. But Rawls\ndetaches the ideal of free and equal moral persons from the Kantian\nInterpretation, and now regards it as a purely “political\nideal” of citizens that is implicit in the political culture of\na democratic society. The political ideals of citizens and of society\nas well-ordered provide the basis for “political\nconstructivism” where the original position again plays its role\nas a procedure of construction for political principles of justice.\nRawls contends that the original position bestows “political\nobjectivity” on principles of justice. Political objectivity is\na kind of objectivity that presumably even the moral skeptic can\naccept, so long as he/she is “reasonable”, or has an\neffective sense of justice. It does not imply that the principles of\njustice apply universally across all social and temporal conditions.\nInstead, principles of justice are objective in so far as they apply\nto all reasonable and rational persons who conceive of themselves as\nfree and equal citizens, have a sense of justice, and want to\ncooperate with others on terms that reasonable persons call all\naccept. \nIf we see the original position as a procedure of construction, then\nperhaps we can gain a clearer idea of the role of the idea a social\ncontract in Rawls’s and other arguments for principles of\njustice. A frequent criticism of social contract doctrines, dating\nback to David Hume, is that the idea of agreement (hypothetical or\nactual) does no real work in justifying principles of justice. The\njustification of principles is said rather to reside in the\nreasons for the parties’ agreement; the social contract\nitself does not add to but only obscures the force of these reasons.\nThus Hume argued that Locke’s social contract argument is an\nunnecessary shuffle, and that political obligations and the duty of\nallegiance cannot be based simply on a promise or agreement. For why\nshould we honor our promises and agreements? It can only be because of\ntheir public utility, Hume says. But political obligation is also\ngrounded in the public utility of people respecting political\nauthority and obeying its laws. Hence there is no need to refer to any\nsocial contract to ground political obligations, since all have their\njustification in public utility (Hume 1748 [1777]; Rawls, LHPP,\n169–173). \nTo respond: It is certainly true that the reasons motivating the\nparties in the original position (their freedom to pursue their good,\ntheir higher-order interests in developing the moral powers, acquiring\nan adequate share of primary goods, etc.) as well as the reasons and\nideals modeled by the original position itself (the freedom and\nequality of moral persons, fairness, publicity, the ideal of a\nwell-ordered society, and so on) are fundamental to the justification\nof the principles of justice agreed to. But this does not mean that\nthe agreement from the original position plays no essential role in\nthe justification of these principles. For the original position\nitself is designed to be a representation and summary of all the moral\nreasons and rational interests relevant to justifying principles of\njustice. Even if it be conceded that rational choice and agreement in\nthe original position, or reasonable agreement in a well-ordered\nsociety, do not provide independent reasons for principles of justice,\nstill they serve the crucial, perhaps necessary role of organizing the\nreasons that the original position incorporates and authorizing\ninference to the principles of justice. \nConsider a parallel argument to the contention that agreement in the\noriginal position provides no reasons for and plays no role in\njustifying principles of justice. We would surely think it peculiar if\nsomeone said of a formal proof: “The reasons for the proven\ntheorem are provided by the axioms it presupposes and not by the rules\nof inference enabling proof.” For rules of inference are\nindispensable for proof of any deductive conclusion. Agreement in the\noriginal position stands in a similar relationship to the principles\nof justice. Agreement in the original position is not itself a proof\nfrom prior premises according to rules of deductive inference. But\nlike rules of deductive inference, agreement in the original position\nestablishes the justifying connection between relevant moral and\npractical reasons (incorporated into the original position itself) and\nprinciples of justice.  \nRawls conjectures in Theory that the argument in the OP\n“aims eventually to be strictly deductive….a kind of\nmoral geometry” (TJ 121/104–5; see also JF 17, 83). This\nis not a concession to Hume’s argument, since Rawls envisions\nthe parties’ selection of the principles of justice as part of\nthis conjectured deduction (JF 133). Moreover, even assuming there is\na very complicated deductive proof (not what Hume envisioned) of the\nprinciples of justice that does not rely on a hypothetical contract.\nRawls’s attitude would be that the original position argument\nstill serves as a useful heuristic for public reason that enables\ncitizens to understand the enormous complexities of this conjectured\nproof. Finally, Rawls later qualifies his claim of deductive proof and\nsays that in fact the argument from the original position cannot\n“fully attain” an ideal of rigorous deductive reasoning;\nfor there are indefinitely many considerations to be appealed to in\nthe original position, and deciding the balance of reasons in favor of\nthe principles of justice depends, not on deduction, but “on\njudgment informed and guided by reasoning” (JF 133–4).\n \nFinally, what is the relationship between the original position and\nRawls’s non-foundationalist method of justification,\n“reflective equilibrium”? Rawls distinguishes three points\nof view; that of the artificial parties in the original position; of\nthe idealized members of a well-ordered society; and “that of\nyou and me” (PL 28), which is the position from which any\nconception of justice is to be assessed in reflective equilibrium.\nReflective equilibrium begins with our shared “considered\nconvictions” of justice at all levels of generality, from\nparticular to our most general judgments. It then seeks to discover\nthe principles of justice that best “fit” with these\nconsidered convictions in a “wide reflective equilibrium,”\nafter considering all the reasonable alternative conceptions of\njustice (see TJ § 9; JF § 10). \nRawls said at one point that “reflective equilibrium works\nthrough the original position.” The suggestion is that\nthe original position itself supplies, in large part, the relevant\nsense of “best fit” of considered moral convictions with\nprinciples of justice. The principles of justice that best fit with\nour considered convictions of justice are those that would be chosen\nby rational persons within this hypothetical-choice “procedure\nof construction,” which itself “represents” our\nconsidered convictions regarding all the relevant reasons for\narguments about principles of social justice. Rawls says in concluding\nA Theory of Justice, “Each aspect of the original\nposition can be given a supporting explanation. Thus what we are doing\nis to combine into one conception the totality of conditions which we\nare ready upon due reflection to recognize as reasonable in our\nconduct towards one another” (TJ 587/514). Thus, in response to\nthe Humean argument that social contract doctrine is superfluous:\nUntil opponents of Rawls’s contract doctrine present an an\nalternative argument for the principles of justice that is more\npersuasive and inclusive of all the relevant reasons bearing on\njustice, Rawls’s original position argument should be regarded\nas essential to justification of the principles of justice (in so far\nas they are justifiable).","contact.mail":"sfreeman@sas.upenn.edu","contact.domain":"sas.upenn.edu"}]
