It is\ncertainly hard to find many thinkers who can be said to have had\ncomparable influence in the creation of the modern world. However,\nMarx was trained as a philosopher, and although often portrayed as\nmoving away from philosophy in his mid-twenties—perhaps towards\nhistory and the social sciences—there are many points of contact\nwith modern philosophical debates throughout his writings.\n\n\nThe themes picked out here include Marx’s philosophical\nanthropology, his theory of history, his economic analysis, his\ncritical engagement with contemporary capitalist society (raising\nissues about morality, ideology, and politics), and his prediction of\na communist future.\n\n\nMarx’s early writings are dominated by an understanding of\nalienation, a distinct type of social ill whose diagnosis looks to\nrest on a controversial account of human nature and its flourishing.\nHe subsequently developed an influential theory of history—often\ncalled historical materialism—centred around the idea that forms\nof society rise and fall as they further and then impede the\ndevelopment of human productive power. Marx increasingly became\npreoccupied with an attempt to understand the contemporary capitalist\nmode of production, as driven by a remorseless pursuit of profit,\nwhose origins are found in the extraction of surplus value from the\nexploited proletariat. The precise role of morality and moral\ncriticism in Marx’s critique of contemporary capitalist society\nis much discussed, and there is no settled scholarly consensus on\nthese issues. His understanding of morality may be related to his\naccount of ideology, and his reflection on the extent to which certain\nwidely-shared misunderstandings might help explain the stability of\nclass-divided societies. In the context of his radical journalism,\nMarx also developed his controversial account of the character and\nrole of the modern state, and more generally of the relation between\npolitical and economic life. Marx sees the historical process as\nproceeding through a series of modes of production, characterised by\n(more or less explicit) class struggle, and driving humankind towards\ncommunism. However, Marx is famously reluctant to say much about the\ndetailed arrangements of the communist alternative that he sought to\nbring into being, arguing that it would arise through historical\nprocesses, and was not the realisation of a pre-determined plan or\nblueprint.\n\nKarl Marx was born in 1818, one of nine children. The family lived in\nthe Rhineland region of Prussia, previously under French rule. Both of\nhis parents came from Jewish families with distinguished rabbinical\nlineages. Marx’s father was a lawyer who converted to\nChristianity when it became necessary for him to do so if he was to\ncontinue his legal career. \nFollowing an unexceptional school career, Marx studied law and\nphilosophy at the universities of Bonn and Berlin. His doctoral thesis\nwas in ancient philosophy, comparing the philosophies of nature of\nDemocritus (c.460–370 BCE) and Epicurus (341–270 BCE).\nFrom early 1842, he embarked on a career as a radical journalist,\ncontributing to, and then editing, the Rheinische Zeitung,\nuntil the paper was closed by the Prussian authorities in April\n1843. \nMarx married Jenny von Westphalen (1814–1881), his childhood\nsweetheart, in June 1843. They would spend their lives together and\nhave seven children, of whom just three daughters—Jenny\n(1844–1883), Laura (1845–1911), and Eleanor\n(1855–1898)—survived to adulthood. Marx is also widely\nthought to have fathered a child—Frederick Demuth\n(1851–1929)—with Helene Demuth (1820–1890),\nhousekeeper and friend of the Marx family. \nMarx’s adult life combined independent scholarship, political\nactivity, and financial insecurity, in fluctuating proportions.\nPolitical conditions were such, that, in order to associate and write\nas he wished, he had to live outside of Germany for most of this time.\nMarx spent three successive periods of exile in the capital cities of\nFrance, Belgium, and England. \nBetween late 1843 and early 1845, Marx lived in Paris, a cosmopolitan\ncity full of émigrés and radical artisans. He was\nsubsequently expelled by the French government following Prussian\npressure. In his last months in Germany and during this Paris exile,\nMarx produced a series of “early writings”, many not\nintended for publication, which significantly altered interpretations\nof his thought when they were published collectively in the twentieth\ncentury. Papers that actually saw publication during this period\ninclude: “On the Jewish Question” (1843) in which Marx\ndefends Jewish Emancipation against Bruno Bauer (1809–1882), but\nalso emphasises the limitations of “political” as against\n“human” emancipation; and the “Critique of\nHegel’s Philosophy of Right: Introduction” (1844) which\ncontains a critical account of religion, together with some prescient\nremarks about the emancipatory potential of the proletariat. The most\nsignificant works that Marx wrote for self-clarification rather than\npublication in his Paris years are the so-called “1844\nManuscripts” (1844) which provide a suggestive account of\nalienation, especially of alienation in work; and the “Theses on\nFeuerbach” (1845), a set of epigrammatic but rich remarks\nincluding reflections on the nature of philosophy. \nBetween early 1845 and early 1848, Marx lived in Brussels, the capital\nof a rapidly industrialising Belgium. A condition of his residency was\nto refrain from publishing on contemporary politics, and he was\neventually expelled after political demonstrations involving foreign\nnationals took place. In Brussels Marx published The Holy\nFamily (1845), which includes contributions from his new friend\nand close collaborator Friedrich Engels (1820–1895), continuing\nthe attack on Bruno Bauer and his followers. Marx also worked, with\nEngels, on a series of manuscripts now usually known as The German\nIdeology (1845–46), a substantial section of which\ncriticises the work of Max Stirner (1806–1856). Marx also wrote\nand published The Poverty of Philosophy (1847) which\ndisparages the social theory of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon\n(1809–1865). All these publications characteristically show Marx\ndeveloping and promoting his own views through fierce critical attacks\non contemporaries, often better-known and more established than\nhimself. \nMarx was politically active throughout his adult life, although the\nevents of 1848—during which time he returned to Paris and\nCologne—inspired the first of two periods of especially intense\nactivity. Two important texts here are The Communist\nManifesto (1848) which Marx and Engels published just before the\nFebruary Revolution, and, following his move to London, The Class\nStruggles in France (1850) in which Marx examined the subsequent\nfailure of 1848 in France. Between these two dates, Marx commented on,\nand intervened in, the revolution in Germany through the Neue\nRheinische Zeitung (1848–49), the paper he helped to\nestablish and edit in Cologne. \nFor well over half of his adult life—from late 1849 until his\ndeath in 1883—Marx lived in London, a city providing a secure\nhaven for political exiles and a superb vantage point from which to\nstudy the world’s most advanced capitalist economy. This third\nand longest exile was dominated by an intellectual and personal\nstruggle to complete his critique of political economy, but his\ntheoretical output extended far beyond that project. \nMarx’s initial attempt to make sense of Napoleon III’s\nrise to power in contemporary France is contained in The\nEighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852). Between 1852 and\n1862 Marx also wrote well over three hundred articles for the New\nYork Daily Tribune; sometimes unfairly disparaged as merely\nincome-generating journalism, they frequently contain illuminating\nattempts to explain contemporary European society and politics\n(including European interventions in India and China) to an American\naudience (helpfully) presumed to know little about them. \nThe second of Marx’s two especially intense periods of political\nactivity—after the revolutions of 1848—centred on his\ninvolvement in the International Working Men’s Association\nbetween 1864 and 1874, and the events of the Paris Commune (1871), in\nparticular. The character and lessons of the Commune—the\nshort-lived, and violently suppressed, municipal rebellion that\ncontrolled Paris for several months in the aftermath of the\nFranco-Prussian war—are discussed in The Civil War in\nFrance (1871). Also politically important was Marx’s\n“Critique of the Gotha Programme” (1875), in which he\ncriticises the theoretical influence of Ferdinand Lassalle\n(1825–1864) on the German labour movement, and portrays the\nhigher stage of a future communist society as endorsing distribution\naccording to “the needs principle”. \nMarx’s critique of political economy remains controversial. He\nnever succeeded in fixing and realising the wider project that he\nenvisaged. Volume One of Capital, published in 1867, was the\nonly significant part of the project published in his own lifetime,\nand even here he was unable to resist heavily reworking subsequent\neditions (especially the French version of 1872–75). What we now\nknow as Volume Two and Volume Three of Capital were put\ntogether from Marx’s raw materials by Engels and published in\n1885 and 1894, respectively, and Marx’s own drafts were written\nbefore the publication of Volume One and barely touched by him in the\nremaining fifteen years of his life. An additional three supplementary\nvolumes planned by Engels, and subsequently called Theories of\nSurplus Value (or, more colloquially, the “fourth volume of\nCapital”) were assembled from remaining notes by Karl\nKautsky (1854–1938), and published between 1905 and 1910. (The\nsection of the “new MEGA”—see below—concerned\nwith Capital-related texts contains fifteen thick volumes,\nand provides some sense of the extent and character of these later\neditorial interventions.) In addition, the publication in 1953—a\nprevious two-volume edition (1939 and 1941) had only a highly\nrestricted circulation—of the so-called Grundrisse\n(written in 1857–58) was also important. Whether this text is\ntreated as a freestanding work or as a preparatory step towards\nCapital, it raises many questions about Marx’s method,\nhis relation to G.W.F. Hegel (1770–1831), and the evolution of\nMarx’s thought. In contrast, the work of political economy that\nMarx did publish in this period—A Contribution to a Critique\nof Political Economy (1859)—was largely ignored by both\ncontemporaries and later commentators, except for the, much reprinted\nand discussed, summary sketch of his theory of history that Marx\noffered in the so-called “1859 Preface” to that\nvolume. \nMarx’s later years (after the Paris Commune) are the subject of\nmuch interpretative disagreement. His inability to deliver the later\nvolumes of Capital is often seen as emblematic of a wider and\nmore systematic intellectual failure (Stedman Jones 2016). However,\nothers have stressed Marx’s continued intellectual creativity in\nthis period, as he variously rethought his views about: the core and\nperiphery of the international economic system; the scope of his\ntheory of history; social anthropology; and the economic and political\nevolution of Russia (Shanin 1983; K. Anderson 2010). \nAfter the death of his wife, in 1881, Marx’s life was dominated\nby illness, and travel aimed at improving his health (convalescent\ndestinations including the Isle of Wight, Karlsbad, Jersey, and\nAlgiers). Marx died in March 1883, two months after the death of his\neldest daughter. His estate was valued at £250. \nEngels’s wider role in the evolution of, and, more especially\nthe reception and interpretation of, Marx’s work is much\ndisputed. The truth here is complex, and Engels is not always\nwell-treated in the literature. Marx and Engels are sometimes\nportrayed as if they were a single entity, of one mind on all matters,\nwhose individual views on any topic can be found simply by consulting\nthe other. Others present Engels as the distorter and manipulator of\nMarx’s thought, responsible for any element of Marxian theory\nwith which the relevant commentator might disagree. Despite their\nfamiliarity, neither caricature seems plausible or fair. The\nbest-known jointly authored texts are The Holy\nFamily, the “German Ideology” manuscripts, and\nThe Communist Manifesto, but there are nearly two hundred\nshorter items that they both contributed to (Draper 1985:\n2–19). \nMany of Marx’s best-known writings remained unpublished before\nhis death. The attempt to establish a reliable collected edition has\nproved lengthy and fraught. The authoritative\nMarx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe, the so-called “new\nMEGA” (1975–), is still a work in progress, begun\nunder Soviet auspices but since 1990 under the guidance of the\n“International Marx-Engels Stiftung” (IMES). In its\ncurrent form—much scaled-down from its original\nambitions—the edition will contain some 114 volumes (well over a\nhalf of which are published at the time of writing). In addition to\nhis various published and unpublished works, it includes Marx’s\njournalism, correspondence, drafts, and (some) notebooks. Texts are\npublished in their original language (variously German, English, and\nFrench). For those needing to utilise English-language resources, the\nfifty volume Marx Engels Collected Works (1975–2004)\ncan be recommended. (References to Marx and Engels quotations here are\nto these MECW volumes.) There are also several useful single\nvolume selections of Marx and Engels writings in English (including\nMarx 2000). \nAlienation is a concept especially, but not uniquely, associated with\nMarx’s work, and the intellectual tradition that he helped\nfound. It identifies a distinct kind of social ill, involving a\nseparation between a subject and an object that properly belong\ntogether. The subject here is typically an individual or a group,\nwhile the object is usually an “entity” which variously is\nnot itself a subject, is another subject(s), or is the original\nsubject (that is, the relation here can be reflexive). And the\nrelation between the relevant subject and object is one of problematic\nseparation. Both elements of that characterisation are important. Not\nall social ills, of course, involve separations; for instance, being\noverly integrated into some object might be dysfunctional, but it is\nnot characteristic of alienation. Moreover, not all separations are\nproblematic, and accounts of alienation typically appeal to some\nbaseline unity or harmony that is frustrated or violated by the\nseparation in question. \nTheories of alienation vary considerably, but frequently: first,\nidentify a subset of these problematic separations as being of\nparticular importance; second, include an account (sometimes implicit)\nof what makes the relevant separations problematic; and, third,\npropound some explanatory claims about the extent of, and prognosis\nfor, alienation, so understood. \nMarx’s ideas concerning alienation were greatly influenced by\nthe critical writings on religion of Ludwig Feuerbach\n(1804–1872), and especially his The Essence of\nChristianity (1841). One key text in this respect is Marx’s\n“Contribution of Hegel’s Critique of Right:\nIntroduction” (1843). This work is home to Marx’s\nnotorious remark that religion is the “opium of the\npeople,” a harmful, illusion-generating painkiller\n(MECW 3: 175). It is here that Marx sets out his account of\nreligion in most detail. \nWhile traditional Christian theology asserts that God created man in\nGod’s own image, Marx fully accepted Feuerbach’s inversion\nof this picture, proposing that human beings had invented God in their\nown image; indeed a view that long pre-dated Feuerbach.\nFeuerbach’s distinctive contribution was to argue that\nworshipping God diverted human beings from enjoying their own human\npowers. In their imagination humans raise their own powers to an\ninfinite level and project them on to an abstract object. Hence\nreligion is a form of alienation, for it separates human beings from\ntheir “species essence.” Marx accepted much of\nFeuerbach’s account but argues that Feuerbach failed to\nunderstand why people fall into religious alienation, and so is unable\nto explain how it can be transcended. Feuerbach’s view appears\nto be that belief in religion is purely an intellectual error and can\nbe corrected by persuasion. Marx’s explanation is that religion\nis a response to alienation in material life, and therefore cannot be\nremoved until human material life is emancipated, at which point\nreligion will wither away. \nPrecisely what it is about material life that creates religion is not\nset out with complete clarity. However, it seems that at least two\naspects of alienation are responsible. One is alienated labour, which\nwill be explored shortly. A second is the need for human beings to\nassert their communal essence. Whether or not we explicitly recognise\nit, human beings exist as a community, and what makes human life\npossible is our mutual dependence on the vast network of social and\neconomic relations which engulf us all, even though this is rarely\nacknowledged in our day-to-day life. Marx’s view appears to be\nthat we must, somehow or other, acknowledge our communal existence in\nour institutions. At first it is “deviously acknowledged”\nby religion, which creates a false idea of a community in which we are\nall equal in the eyes of God. After the post-Reformation fragmentation\nof religion, where religion is no longer able to play the role even of\na fake community of equals, the modern state fills this need by\noffering us the illusion of a community of citizens, all equal in the\neyes of the law. Interestingly, the political or liberal state, which\nis needed to manage the politics of religious diversity, takes on the\nrole offered by religion in earlier times of providing a form of\nillusory community. But the political state and religion will both be\ntranscended when a genuine community of social and economic equals is\ncreated. \nAlthough Marx was greatly inspired by thinking about religious\nalienation, much more of his attention was devoted to exploring\nalienation in work. In a much-discussed passage from the 1844\nManuscripts, Marx identifies four dimensions of alienated labour\nin contemporary capitalist society (MECW 3: 270–282).\nFirst, immediate producers are separated from the product of their\nlabour; they create a product that they neither own nor control,\nindeed, which comes to dominate them. (Note that this idea of\n“fetishism”—where human creations escape our\ncontrol, achieve the appearance of independence, and come to oppress\nus—is not to be equated with alienation as such, but is rather\none form that it can take.) Second, immediate producers are separated\nfrom their productive activity; in particular, they are forced to work\nin ways which are mentally and/or physically debilitating. Third,\nimmediate producers are separated from other individuals; contemporary\neconomic relations socialise individuals to view others as merely\nmeans to their own particular ends. Fourth, and finally, immediate\nproducers are separated from their own human nature; for instance, the\nhuman capacities for community and for free, conscious, and creative,\nwork, are both frustrated by contemporary capitalist relations. \nNote that these claims about alienation are distinct from other,\nperhaps more familiar, complaints about work in capitalist society.\nFor instance, alienated labour, as understood here, could\nbe—even if it is often not—highly remunerated, limited in\nduration, and relatively secure. \nMarx holds that work has the potential to be something creative and\nfulfilling. He consequently rejects the view of work as a necessary\nevil, denying that the negative character of work is part of our fate,\na universal fact about the human condition that no amount of social\nchange could remedy. Indeed, productive activity, on Marx’s\naccount, is a central element in what it is to be a human being, and\nself-realisation through work is a vital component of human\nflourishing. That he thinks that work—in a different form of\nsociety—could be creative and fulfilling, perhaps explains the\nintensity and scale of Marx’s condemnation of contemporary\neconomic arrangements and their transformation of workers into\ndeformed and “dehumanised” beings (MECW 3:\n284). \nIt was suggested above that alienation consists of dysfunctional\nseparations—separations between entities that properly belong\ntogether—and that theories of alienation typically presuppose\nsome baseline condition whose frustration or violation by the relevant\nseparation identifies the latter as dysfunctional. For Marx, that\nbaseline seems to be provided by an account of human flourishing,\nwhich he conceptualises in terms of self-realisation (understood here\nas the development and deployment of our essential human capacities).\nLabour in capitalism, we can say, is alienated because it embodies\nseparations preventing the self-realisation of producers; because it\nis organised in a way that frustrates the human need for free,\nconscious, and creative work. \nSo understood, and returning to the four separations said to\ncharacterise alienated labour, we can see that it is the implicit\nclaim about human nature (the fourth separation) which identifies the\nother three separations as dysfunctional. If one subscribed to the\nsame formal model of alienation and self-realisation, but held a\ndifferent account of the substance of human nature, very different\nclaims about work in capitalist society might result. Imagine a\ntheorist who held that human beings were solitary, egoistic creatures,\nby nature. That theorist could accept that work in capitalist society\nencouraged isolation and selfishness, but deny that such results were\nalienating, because those results would not frustrate their baseline\naccount of what it is to be a human being (indeed, they would rather\nfacilitate those characteristics). \nMarx seems to hold various views about the historical location and\ncomparative extent of alienation. These include: that some systematic\nforms of alienation—presumably including religious\nalienation—existed in pre-capitalist societies; that systematic\nforms of alienation—including alienation in work—are only\na feature of class divided societies; that systematic forms of\nalienation are greater in contemporary capitalist societies than in\npre-capitalist societies; and that not all human societies are scarred\nby class division, in particular, that a future classless society\n(communism) will not contain systematic forms of alienation. \nMarx maintains that alienation flows from capitalist social relations,\nand not from the kind of technological advances that capitalist\nsociety contains. His disapproval of capitalism is reserved for its\nsocial arrangements and not its material accomplishments. He had\nlittle time for what is sometimes called the “romantic critique\nof capitalism”, which sees industry and technology as the real\nvillains, responsible for devastating the purportedly communitarian\nidyll of pre-capitalist relations. In contrast, Marx celebrates the\nbourgeoisie’s destruction of feudal relations, and sees\ntechnological growth and human liberation as (at least, in time)\nprogressing hand-in-hand. Industry and technology are understood as\npart of the solution to, and not the source of, social problems. \nThere are many opportunities for scepticism here. In the present\ncontext, many struggle to see how the kind of large-scale industrial\nproduction that would presumably characterise communist\nsociety—communism purportedly being more productive than\ncapitalism—would avoid alienation in work. Interesting responses\nto such concerns have been put forward, but they have typically come\nfrom commentators rather than from Marx himself (Kandiyali 2018). This\nis a point at which Marx’s self-denying ordinance concerning the\ndetailed description of communist society prevents him from engaging\ndirectly with significant concerns about the direction of social\nchange. \nIn the text “On The Jewish Question” (1843) Marx begins to\nmake clear the distance between himself and his radical liberal\ncolleagues among the Young Hegelians; in particular Bruno Bauer. Bauer\nhad recently written against Jewish emancipation, from an atheist\nperspective, arguing that the religion of both Jews and Christians was\na barrier to emancipation. In responding to Bauer, Marx makes one of\nthe most enduring arguments from his early writings, by means of\nintroducing a distinction between political\nemancipation—essentially the grant of liberal rights and\nliberties—and human emancipation. Marx’s reply to Bauer is\nthat political emancipation is perfectly compatible with the continued\nexistence of religion, as the contemporary example of the United\nStates demonstrates. However, pushing matters deeper, in an argument\nreinvented by innumerable critics of liberalism, Marx argues that not\nonly is political emancipation insufficient to bring about human\nemancipation, it is in some sense also a barrier. Liberal rights and\nideas of justice are premised on the idea that each of us needs\nprotection from other human beings who are a threat to our liberty and\nsecurity. Therefore, liberal rights are rights of separation, designed\nto protect us from such perceived threats. Freedom on such a view, is\nfreedom from interference. What this view overlooks is the\npossibility—for Marx, the fact—that real freedom is to be\nfound positively in our relations with other people. It is to be found\nin human community, not in isolation. Accordingly, insisting on a\nregime of liberal rights encourages us to view each other in ways that\nundermine the possibility of the real freedom we may find in human\nemancipation. Now we should be clear that Marx does not oppose\npolitical emancipation, for he sees that liberalism is a great\nimprovement on the systems of feudalism and religious prejudice and\ndiscrimination which existed in the Germany of his day. Nevertheless,\nsuch politically emancipated liberalism must be transcended on the\nroute to genuine human emancipation. Unfortunately, Marx never tells\nus what human emancipation is, although it is clear that it is closely\nrelated to the ideas of non-alienated labour and meaningful\ncommunity. \nEven with these elaborations, many additional questions remain about\nMarx’s account. Three concerns are briefly addressed here. \nFirst, one might worry about the place of alienation in the evolution\nof Marx’s thought. The once-popular suggestion that Marx only\nwrote about alienation in his early writings—his published and\nunpublished works from the early 1840s—is not sustained by the\ntextual evidence. However, the theoretical role that the concept of\nalienation plays in his writings might still be said to evolve. For\nexample, it has been suggested that alienation in the early writings\nis intended to play an “explanatory role”, whereas in his\nlater work it comes to have a more “descriptive or\ndiagnostic” function (Wood 1981 [2004: 7]). \nA second concern is the role of human nature in the interpretation of\nalienation offered here. In one exegetical variant of this worry, the\nsuggestion is that this account of alienation rests on a model of\nuniversal human nature which Marx’s (later) understanding of\nhistorical specificity and change prevents him from endorsing.\nHowever, there is much evidence against this purported later rejection\nof human nature (see Geras 1983). Indeed, the “mature”\nMarx explicitly affirms that human nature has both constant and\nmutable elements; that human beings are characterised by universal\nqualities, constant across history and culture, and variable\nqualities, reflecting historical and cultural diversity (McMurtry\n1978: 19–53). One systematic, rather than exegetical, variant of\nthe present worry suggests that we should not endorse accounts of\nalienation which depend on “thick” and inevitably\ncontroversial accounts of human nature (Jaeggi 2016). Whatever view we\ntake of that claim about our endorsement, there seems little doubt\nabout the “thickness” of Marx’s own account of human\nflourishing. To provide for the latter, a society must satisfy not\nonly basic needs (for sustenance, warmth and shelter, certain climatic\nconditions, physical exercise, basic hygiene, procreation and sexual\nactivity), but also less basic needs, both those that are not always\nappreciated to be part of his account (for recreation, culture,\nintellectual stimulation, artistic expression, emotional satisfaction,\nand aesthetic pleasure), and those that Marx is more often associated\nwith (for fulfilling work and meaningful community) (Leopold 2007:\n227–245). \nThird, we may ask about Marx’s attitude towards the distinction\nsometimes made between subjective and objective alienation. These two\nforms of alienation can be exemplified separately or conjointly in the\nlives of particular individuals or societies (Hardimon 1994:\n119–122). Alienation is “subjective” when it is\ncharacterised in terms of the presence (or absence) of certain beliefs\nor feelings; for example, when individuals are said to be alienated\nbecause they feel estranged from the world. Alienation is\n“objective” when it is characterised in terms which make\nno reference to the beliefs or feelings of individuals; for example,\nwhen individuals are said to be alienated because they fail to develop\nand deploy their essential human characteristics, whether or not they\nexperience that lack of self-realisation as a loss. Marx seems to\nallow that these two forms of alienation are conceptually distinct,\nbut assumes that in capitalist societies they are typically found\ntogether. Indeed, he often appears to think of subjective alienation\nas tracking the objective variant. That said, Marx does allow that\nthey can come apart sociologically. At least, that is one way of\nreading a passage in The Holy Family where he recognises that\ncapitalists do not get to engage in self-realising activities of the\nright kind (and hence are objectively alienated), but\nthat—unlike the proletariat—they are content in\ntheir estrangement (and hence are lacking subjective alienation),\nfeeling “at ease” in, and even “strengthened”\nby, it (MECW 4: 36). \nMarx did not set out his theory of history in great detail.\nAccordingly, it has to be constructed from a variety of texts, both\nthose where he attempts to apply a theoretical analysis to past and\nfuture historical events, and those of a more purely theoretical\nnature. Of the latter, the “1859 Preface” to A\nCritique of Political Economy has achieved canonical status.\nHowever, the manuscripts collected together as The German\nIdeology, co-written with Engels in 1845-46, are also a much used\nearly source. We shall briefly outline both texts, and then look at\nthe reconstruction of Marx’s theory of history in the hands of\nhis philosophically most influential recent exponent, G.A. Cohen\n(Cohen 1978 [2001], 1988), who builds on the interpretation of the\nearly Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov (1856–1918)\n(Plekhanov 1895 [1947]). \nWe should, however, be aware that Cohen’s interpretation is far\nfrom universally accepted. Cohen provided his reconstruction of Marx\npartly because he was frustrated with existing Hegelian-inspired\n“dialectical” interpretations of Marx, and what he\nconsidered to be the vagueness of the influential works of Louis\nAlthusser (1918–1990), neither of which, he felt, provided a\nrigorous account of Marx’s views. However, some scholars believe\nthat the interpretation that we shall focus on is faulty precisely for\nits insistence on a mechanical model and its lack of attention to the\ndialectic. One aspect of this criticism is that Cohen’s\nunderstanding has a surprisingly small role for the concept of class\nstruggle, which is often felt to be central to Marx’s theory of\nhistory. Cohen’s explanation for this is that the “1859\nPreface”, on which his interpretation is based, does not give a\nprominent role to class struggle, and indeed it is not explicitly\nmentioned. Yet this reasoning is problematic for it is possible that\nMarx did not want to write in a manner that would engage the concerns\nof the police censor, and, indeed, a reader aware of the context may\nbe able to detect an implicit reference to class struggle through the\ninclusion of such phrases as “then begins an era of social\nrevolution,” and “the ideological forms in which men\nbecome conscious of this conflict and fight it out”. Hence it\ndoes not follow that Marx himself thought that the concept of class\nstruggle was relatively unimportant. Furthermore, when A Critique\nof Political Economy was replaced by Capital, Marx made\nno attempt to keep the 1859 Preface in print, and its content\nis reproduced just as a very much abridged footnote in\nCapital. Nevertheless, we shall concentrate here on\nCohen’s interpretation as no other account has been set out with\ncomparable rigour, precision and detail. \nIn his “Theses on Feuerbach” (1845) Marx provides\na background to what would become his theory of history by stating his\nobjections to “all hitherto existing” materialism and\nidealism, understood as types of philosophical theories. Materialism\nis complimented for understanding the physical reality of the world,\nbut is criticised for ignoring the active role of the human subject in\ncreating the world we perceive. Idealism, at least as developed by\nHegel, understands the active nature of the human subject, but\nconfines it to thought or contemplation: the world is created through\nthe categories we impose upon it. Marx combines the insights of both\ntraditions to propose a view in which human beings do indeed create\n—or at least transform—the world they find themselves in,\nbut this transformation happens not in thought but through actual\nmaterial activity; not through the imposition of sublime concepts but\nthrough the sweat of their brow, with picks and shovels. This\nhistorical version of materialism, which, according to Marx,\ntranscends and thus rejects all existing philosophical thought, is the\nfoundation of Marx’s later theory of history. As Marx puts it in\nthe “1844 Manuscripts”, “Industry is the actual\nhistorical relationship of nature … to man”\n(MECW 3: 303). This thought, derived from reflection on the\nhistory of philosophy, together with his experience of social and\neconomic realities, as a journalist, sets the agenda for all\nMarx’s future work. \nIn The German Ideology manuscripts, Marx and Engels contrast\ntheir new materialist method with the idealism that had characterised\nprevious German thought. Accordingly, they take pains to set out the\n“premises of the materialist method”. They start, they\nsay, from “real human beings”, emphasising that human\nbeings are essentially productive, in that they must produce their\nmeans of subsistence in order to satisfy their material needs. The\nsatisfaction of needs engenders new needs of both a material and\nsocial kind, and forms of society arise corresponding to the state of\ndevelopment of human productive forces. Material life determines, or\nat least “conditions” social life, and so the primary\ndirection of social explanation is from material production to social\nforms, and thence to forms of consciousness. As the material means of\nproduction develop, “modes of co-operation” or economic\nstructures rise and fall, and eventually communism will become a real\npossibility once the plight of the workers and their awareness of an\nalternative motivates them sufficiently to become revolutionaries. \nIn the sketch of The German Ideology, many of the key\nelements of historical materialism are present, even if the\nterminology is not yet that of Marx’s more mature writings.\nMarx’s statement in the “1859 Preface” renders\nsomething of the same view in sharper form. Cohen’s\nreconstruction of Marx’s view in the Preface begins from what\nCohen calls the Development Thesis, which is pre-supposed, rather than\nexplicitly stated in the Preface (Cohen 1978 [2001]: 134–174).\nThis is the thesis that the productive forces tend to develop, in the\nsense of becoming more powerful, over time. The productive forces are\nthe means of production, together with productively applicable\nknowledge: technology, in other words. The development thesis states\nnot that the productive forces always do develop, but that there is a\ntendency for them to do so. The next thesis is the primacy thesis,\nwhich has two aspects. The first states that the nature of a\nsociety’s economic structure is explained by the level of\ndevelopment of its productive forces, and the second that the nature\nof the superstructure—the political and legal institutions of\nsociety—is explained by the nature of the economic structure.\nThe nature of a society’s ideology, which is to say certain\nreligious, artistic, moral and philosophical beliefs contained within\nsociety, is also explained in terms of its economic structure,\nalthough this receives less emphasis in Cohen’s interpretation.\nIndeed, many activities may well combine aspects of both the\nsuperstructure and ideology: a religion is constituted by both\ninstitutions and a set of beliefs. \nRevolution and epoch change is understood as the consequence of an\neconomic structure no longer being able to continue to develop the\nforces of production. At this point the development of the productive\nforces is said to be fettered, and, according to the theory, once an\neconomic structure fetters development it will be\nrevolutionised—“burst asunder” (MECW 6:\n489)—and eventually replaced with an economic structure better\nsuited to preside over the continued development of the forces of\nproduction. \nIn outline, then, the theory has a pleasing simplicity and power. It\nseems plausible that human productive power develops over time, and\nplausible too that economic structures exist for as long as they\ndevelop the productive forces, but will be replaced when they are no\nlonger capable of doing this. Yet severe problems emerge when we\nattempt to put more flesh on these bones. \nPrior to Cohen’s work, historical materialism had not been\nregarded as a coherent view within English-language political\nphilosophy. The antipathy is well summed up with the closing words of\nH.B. Acton’s The Illusion of the Epoch: “Marxism\nis a philosophical farrago” (1955: 271). One difficulty taken\nparticularly seriously by Cohen is an alleged inconsistency between\nthe explanatory primacy of the forces of production, and certain\nclaims made elsewhere by Marx which appear to give the economic\nstructure primacy in explaining the development of the productive\nforces. For example, in The Communist Manifesto Marx and\nEngels state that: “The bourgeoisie cannot exist without\nconstantly revolutionising the instruments of production”\n(MECW 6: 487). This appears to give causal and explanatory\nprimacy to the economic structure—capitalism—which brings\nabout the development of the forces of production. Cohen accepts that,\non the surface at least, this generates a contradiction. Both the\neconomic structure and the development of the productive forces seem\nto have explanatory priority over each other. Unsatisfied by such\nvague resolutions as “determination in the last instance”,\nor the idea of “dialectical” connections, Cohen\nself-consciously attempts to apply the standards of clarity and rigour\nof analytic philosophy to provide a reconstructed version of\nhistorical materialism. \nThe key theoretical innovation is to appeal to the notion of\nfunctional explanation, also sometimes called “consequence\nexplanation” (Cohen 1978 [2001]: 249–296). The\nessential move is cheerfully to admit that the economic structure,\nsuch as capitalism, does indeed develop the productive forces, but to\nadd that this, according to the theory, is precisely why we have\ncapitalism (when we do). That is, if capitalism failed to develop the\nproductive forces it would disappear. And, indeed, this fits\nbeautifully with historical materialism. For Marx asserts that when an\neconomic structure fails to develop the productive forces—when\nit “fetters” the productive forces—it will be\nrevolutionised and the epoch will change. So the idea of\n“fettering” becomes the counterpart to the theory of\nfunctional explanation. Essentially fettering is what happens when the\neconomic structure becomes dysfunctional. \nNow it is apparent that this renders historical materialism\nconsistent. Yet there is a question as to whether it is at too high a\nprice. For we must ask whether functional explanation is a coherent\nmethodological device. The problem is that we can ask what it is that\nmakes it the case that an economic structure will only persist for as\nlong as it develops the productive forces. Jon Elster has pressed this\ncriticism against Cohen very hard (Elster 1985: 27–35). If we were\nto argue that there is an agent guiding history who has the purpose\nthat the productive forces should be developed as much as possible\nthen it would make sense that such an agent would intervene in history\nto carry out this purpose by selecting the economic structures which\ndo the best job. However, it is clear that Marx makes no such\nmetaphysical assumptions. Elster is very critical—sometimes of\nMarx, sometimes of Cohen—of the idea of appealing to\n“purposes” in history without those being the purposes of\nanyone. \nIndeed Elster’s criticism was anticipated in fascinating terms\nby Simone Weil (1909–1943), who links Marx’s appeal to\nhistory’s purposes to the influence of Hegel on his thought: \nWe must remember the Hegelian origins of Marxist thought. Hegel\nbelieved in a hidden mind at work in the universe, and that the\nhistory of the world is simply the history of this world mind, which,\nas in the case of everything spiritual, tends indefinitely towards\nperfection. Marx claimed to “put back on its feet” the\nHegelian dialectic, which he accused of being “upside\ndown”, by substituting matter for mind as the motive power of\nhistory; but by an extraordinary paradox, he conceived history,\nstarting from this rectification, as though he attributed to matter\nwhat is the very essence of mind—an unceasing aspiration towards\nthe best. (Weil 1955 [1958: 43]) \nCohen is well aware of the difficulty of appealing to purposes in\nhistory, but defends the use of functional explanation by comparing\nits use in historical materialism with its use in evolutionary\nbiology. In contemporary biology it is commonplace to explain the\nexistence of the stripes of a tiger, or the hollow bones of a bird, by\npointing to the function of these features. Here we have apparent\npurposes which are not the purposes of anyone. The obvious counter,\nhowever, is that in evolutionary biology we can provide a causal story\nto underpin these functional explanations; a story involving chance\nvariation and survival of the fittest. Therefore these functional\nexplanations are sustained by a complex causal feedback loop in which\ndysfunctional elements tend to be filtered out in competition with\nbetter functioning elements. Cohen calls such background accounts\n“elaborations” and he concedes that functional\nexplanations are in need of elaborations. But he points out that\nstandard causal explanations are equally in need of elaborations. We\nmight, for example, be satisfied with the explanation that the vase\nbroke because it was dropped on the floor, but a great deal of further\ninformation is needed to explain why this explanation works. \nConsequently, Cohen claims that we can be justified in offering a\nfunctional explanation even when we are in ignorance of its\nelaboration. Indeed, even in biology detailed causal elaborations of\nfunctional explanations have been available only relatively recently.\nPrior to Charles Darwin (1809–1882), or arguably Jean-Baptiste\nLamarck (1744–1829), the only candidate causal elaboration was\nto appeal to God’s purposes. Darwin outlined a very plausible\nmechanism, but having no genetic theory was not able to elaborate it\ninto a detailed account. Our knowledge remains incomplete in some\nrespects to this day. Nevertheless, it seems perfectly reasonable to\nsay that birds have hollow bones in order to facilitate flight.\nCohen’s point is that the weight of evidence that organisms are\nadapted to their environment would permit even a pre-Darwinian atheist\nto assert this functional explanation with justification. Hence one\ncan be justified in offering a functional explanation even in the\nabsence of a candidate elaboration: if there is sufficient weight of\ninductive evidence. \nAt this point the issue, then, divides into a theoretical question and\nan empirical one. The empirical question is whether or not there is\nevidence that forms of society exist only for as long as they advance\nproductive power, and are replaced by revolution when they fail. Here,\none must admit, the empirical record is patchy at best, and there\nappear to have been long periods of stagnation, even regression, when\ndysfunctional economic structures were not revolutionised. \nThe theoretical issue is whether a plausible elaborating explanation\nis available to underpin Marxist functional explanations. Here there\nis something of a dilemma. In the first instance it is tempting to try\nto mimic the elaboration given in the Darwinian story, and appeal to\nchance variations and survival of the fittest. In this case\n“fittest” would mean “most able to preside over the\ndevelopment of the productive forces”. Chance variation would be\na matter of people trying out new types of economic relations. On this\naccount new economic structures begin through experiment, but thrive\nand persist through their success in developing the productive forces.\nHowever the problem is that such an account would seem to introduce a\nlarger element of contingency than Marx seeks, for it is essential to\nMarx’s thought that one should be able to predict the eventual\narrival of communism. Within Darwinian theory there is no warrant for\nlong-term predictions, for everything depends on the contingencies of\nparticular situations. A similar heavy element of contingency would be\ninherited by a form of historical materialism developed by analogy\nwith evolutionary biology. The dilemma, then, is that the best model\nfor developing the theory makes predictions based on the theory\nunsound, yet the whole point of the theory is predictive. Hence one\nmust either look for an alternative means of producing elaborating\nexplanation, or give up the predictive ambitions of the theory. \nThe driving force of history, in Cohen’s reconstruction of Marx,\nis the development of the productive forces, the most important of\nwhich is technology. But what is it that drives such development?\nUltimately, in Cohen’s account, it is human rationality. Human\nbeings have the ingenuity to apply themselves to develop means to\naddress the scarcity they find. This on the face of it seems very\nreasonable. Yet there are difficulties. As Cohen himself acknowledges,\nsocieties do not always do what would be rational for an individual to\ndo. Co-ordination problems may stand in our way, and there may be\nstructural barriers. Furthermore, it is relatively rare for those who\nintroduce new technologies to be motivated by the need to address\nscarcity. Rather, under capitalism, the profit motive is the key. Of\ncourse it might be argued that this is the social form that the\nmaterial need to address scarcity takes under capitalism. But still\none may raise the question whether the need to address scarcity always\nhas the influence that it appears to have taken on in modern times.\nFor example, a ruling class’s absolute determination to hold on\nto power may have led to economically stagnant societies.\nAlternatively, it might be thought that a society may put religion or\nthe protection of traditional ways of life ahead of economic needs.\nThis goes to the heart of Marx’s theory that man is an\nessentially productive being and that the locus of interaction with\nthe world is industry. As Cohen himself later argued in essays such as\n“Reconsidering Historical Materialism” (1988), the\nemphasis on production may appear one-sided, and ignore other powerful\nelements in human nature. Such a criticism chimes with a criticism\nfrom the previous section; that the historical record may not, in\nfact, display the tendency to growth in the productive forces assumed\nby the theory. \nMany defenders of Marx will argue that the problems stated are\nproblems for Cohen’s interpretation of Marx, rather than for\nMarx himself. It is possible to argue, for example, that Marx did not\nhave a general theory of history, but rather was a social scientist\nobserving and encouraging the transformation of capitalism into\ncommunism as a singular event. And it is certainly true that when Marx\nanalyses a particular historical episode, as he does in the 18th\nBrumaire of Louis Napoleon (1852), any idea of fitting events\ninto a fixed pattern of history seems very far from Marx’s mind.\nOn other views Marx did have a general theory of history but it is far\nmore flexible and less determinate than Cohen insists (Miller 1984).\nAnd finally, as noted, there are critics who believe that\nCohen’s interpretation is entirely wrong-headed owing to its\ndismissive attitude to dialectical reasoning (Sayers 1984 [1990]). \nHow to read Marx’s economic writings, and especially his\nmasterpiece Capital Volume 1,  remains a matter of\ncontroversy. An orthodox reading is that Marx’s essential task\nis to contribute to economic theory, based on a modified form of the\nlabour theory of value. Others warn against such a narrow\ninterpretation, pointing out that the character of Marx’s\nwriting and presentation is very far from what one would expect in a\nstandard economic text. Hence William Clare Roberts (2017), for\nexample, argues that Capital Volume 1 is fundamentally a work\nof political theory, rather than economics. Be that as it may,\nnevertheless, the work does contain substantial presentation of an\neconomic analysis of capitalism, and it is on this that we will focus\nhere. \nCapital Volume 1 begins with an analysis of the idea of\ncommodity production. A commodity is defined as a useful external\nobject, produced for exchange on a market. Thus, two necessary\nconditions for commodity production are: the existence of a market, in\nwhich exchange can take place; and a social division of labour, in\nwhich different people produce different products, without which there\nwould be no motivation for exchange. Marx suggests that commodities\nhave both use-value—a use, in other words—and an\nexchange-value—initially to be understood as their price. Use\nvalue can easily be understood, so Marx says, but he insists that\nexchange value is a puzzling phenomenon, and relative exchange values\nneed to be explained. Why does a quantity of one commodity exchange\nfor a given quantity of another commodity? His explanation is in terms\nof the labour input required to produce the commodity, or rather, the\nsocially necessary labour, which is labour exerted at the average\nlevel of intensity and productivity for that branch of activity within\nthe economy. Thus the labour theory of value asserts that the value of\na commodity is determined by the quantity of socially necessary labour\ntime required to produce it. \nMarx provides a two-stage argument for the labour theory of value. The\nfirst stage is to argue that if two objects can be compared in the\nsense of being put on either side of an equals sign, then there must\nbe a “third thing of identical magnitude in both of them”\nto which they are both reducible. As commodities can be exchanged\nagainst each other, there must, Marx argues, be a third thing that\nthey have in common. This then motivates the second stage, which is a\nsearch for the appropriate “third thing”, which is labour\nin Marx’s view, as the only plausible common element. Both steps\nof the argument are, of course, highly contestable. \nCapitalism can be distinguished from other forms of commodity\nexchange, Marx argues, in that it involves not merely the exchange of\ncommodities, but the advancement of capital, in the form of money,\nwith the purpose of generating profit through the purchase of\ncommodities and their transformation into other commodities which can\ncommand a higher price, and thus yield a profit. Marx claims that no\nprevious theorist has been able adequately to explain how capitalism\nas a whole can make a profit. Marx’s own solution relies on the\nidea of exploitation of the worker. In setting up conditions of\nproduction the capitalist purchases the worker’s labour\npower—his or her ability to labour—for the day. The cost\nof this commodity is determined in the same way as the cost of every\nother; that is, in terms of the amount of socially necessary labour\npower required to produce it. In this case the value of a day’s\nlabour power is the value of the commodities necessary to keep the\nworker alive for a day. Suppose that such commodities take four hours\nto produce. Accordingly the first four hours of the working day is\nspent on producing value equivalent to the value of the wages the\nworker will be paid. This is known as necessary labour. Any work the\nworker does above this is known as surplus labour, producing surplus\nvalue for the capitalist. Surplus value, according to Marx, is the\nsource of all profit. In Marx’s analysis labour power is the\nonly commodity which can produce more value than it is worth, and for\nthis reason it is known as variable capital. Other commodities simply\npass their value on to the finished commodities, but do not create any\nextra value. They are known as constant capital. Profit, then, is the\nresult of the labour performed by the worker beyond that necessary to\ncreate the value of his or her wages. This is the surplus value theory\nof profit. \nIt appears to follow from this analysis that as industry becomes more\nmechanised, using more constant capital and less variable capital, the\nrate of profit ought to fall. For as a proportion less capital will be\nadvanced on labour, and only labour can create value. In\nCapital Volume 3 Marx does indeed make the prediction that\nthe rate of profit will fall over time, and this is one of the factors\nwhich leads to the downfall of capitalism. (However, as pointed out by\nPaul Sweezy in The Theory of Capitalist Development (1942),\nthe analysis is problematic.) A further consequence of this analysis\nis a difficulty for the theory that Marx did recognise, and tried,\nalbeit unsuccessfully, to meet also in the manuscripts that make up\nCapital Volume 3. It follows from the analysis so far that\nlabour-intensive industries ought to have a higher rate of profit than\nthose which use less labour. Not only is this empirically false, it is\ntheoretically unacceptable. Accordingly, Marx argued that in real\neconomic life prices vary in a systematic way from values. Providing\nthe mathematics to explain this is known as the transformation\nproblem, and Marx’s own attempt suffers from technical\ndifficulties. Although there are sophisticated known techniques for\nsolving this problem now there is a question about the degree to which\nthey do rescue Marx’s project. If it is thought that the labour\ntheory of value was initially motivated as an intuitively plausible\ntheory of price then when the connection between price and value is\nrendered as indirect as it is in the final theory, the intuitive\nmotivation of the theory drains away. Others consider this to be a\nsuperficial reading of Marx, and that his general approach allows us\nto see through the appearances of capitalism to understand its\nunderlying basis, which need not coincide with appearances. How\nMarx’s theory of capitalism should be read remains an active\narea of scholarly debate (Heinrich 2012). \nA further objection is that Marx’s assertion that only labour\ncan create surplus value is unsupported by any argument or analysis,\nand can be argued to be merely an artefact of the nature of his\npresentation. Any commodity can be picked to play a similar role.\nConsequently, with equal justification one could set out a corn theory\nof value, arguing that corn has the unique power of creating more\nvalue than it costs. Formally this would be identical to the labour\ntheory of value (Roemer 1982). Nevertheless, the claims that somehow\nlabour is responsible for the creation of value, and that profit is\nthe consequence of exploitation, remain intuitively powerful, even if\nthey are difficult to establish in detail. \nHowever, even if the labour theory of value is considered discredited,\nthere are elements of his theory that remain of worth. The Cambridge\neconomist Joan Robinson, in An Essay on Marxian Economics\n(1942), picked out two aspects of particular note. First, Marx’s\nrefusal to accept that capitalism involves a harmony of interests\nbetween worker and capitalist, replacing this with a class-based\nanalysis of the worker’s struggle for better wages and\nconditions of work, versus the capitalist’s drive for ever\ngreater profits. Second, Marx’s denial that there is any\nlong-run tendency to equilibrium in the market, and his descriptions\nof mechanisms which underlie the trade-cycle of boom and bust. Both\nprovide a salutary corrective to aspects of orthodox economic\ntheory. \nAs noted, traditionally Marx’s definition of exploitation is\ngiven in terms of the theory of surplus value, which in turn is taken\nto depend on the labour theory of value: the theory that the value of\nany commodity is proportional to the amount of “socially\nnecessary” labour embodied in it. However, the question arises\nof whether the basic idea of exploitation should be so dependent on a\nparticular theory of value. For if it is, the notion of exploitation\nbecomes vulnerable to Robert Nozick’s objection: that if the\nlabour theory of value can be shown to be faulty, the Marxist theory\nof exploitation collapses too (Nozick 1974). \nOthers have felt that it is possible to restore the intuitive core of\na Marxist theory of exploitation independent of the labour theory of\nvalue (cf. Cohen 1979, Wolff 1999, Vrousalis 2013). John Roemer, to\ntake one leading case, states: \nMarxian exploitation is defined as the unequal exchange of labor for\ngoods: the exchange is unequal when the amount of labor embodied in\nthe goods which the worker can purchase with his income … is\nless than the amount of labor he expended to earn that income.(Roemer\n1985: 30) \nSuppose I work eight hours to earn my wages. With this perhaps the\nbest thing I can buy is a coat. But imagine that the coat took only a\ntotal of four hours to make. Therefore I have exchanged my eight hours\nwork for only four hours of other people’s work, and thereby, on\nthis view, I am exploited. \nThe definition requires some refinement. For example, if I am taxed\nfor the benefit of those unable to work, I will be exploited by the\nabove definition, but this is not what the definition of exploitation\nwas intended to capture. Worse still, if there is one person exploited\nmuch more gravely than anyone else in the economy, then it may turn\nout that no-one else is exploited. Nevertheless, it should not be\ndifficult to adjust the definition to take account of these\ndifficulties, and as noted several other accounts of Marx-inspired\naccounts of exploitation have been offered that are independent of the\nlabour theory of value. \nMany of these alternative definitions add a notion of unfreedom or\ndomination to unequal exchange of labour and goods (Vrousalis 2013).\nThe exploited person is forced to accept a situation in which he or\nshe just never gets back what they put into the labour process. Now\nthere may be, in particular cases, a great deal to be said about why\nthis is perfectly acceptable from a moral point of view. However, on\nthe face of it such exploitation appears to be unjust. Nevertheless,\nwe will see in the next section why attributing such a position to\nMarx himself is fraught with difficulty. \nThe issue of Marx and morality poses a conundrum. On reading\nMarx’s works at all periods of his life, there appears to be the\nstrongest possible distaste towards bourgeois capitalist society, and\nan undoubted endorsement of future communist society. Yet the terms of\nthis antipathy and endorsement are far from clear. Despite\nexpectations, Marx never directly says that capitalism is unjust.\nNeither does he directly say that communism would be a just form of\nsociety. In fact he frequently takes pains to distance himself from\nthose who engage in a discourse of justice, and makes a conscious\nattempt to exclude direct moral commentary in his own works. The\npuzzle is why this should be, given the weight of indirect moral\ncommentary one also finds in his writings. \nThere are, initially, separate questions concerning Marx’s\nattitude to capitalism and to communism. There are also separate\nquestions concerning his attitude to ideas of justice, and to ideas of\nmorality more broadly concerned. This, then, generates four questions:\n(a) Did Marx think capitalism unjust?; (b) did he think that\ncapitalism could be morally criticised on other grounds?; (c) did he\nthink that communism would be just? (d) did he think it could be\nmorally approved of on other grounds? These are some of the questions\nwe consider in this section. \nThe initial argument that Marx must have thought that capitalism is\nunjust is based on the observation that Marx argued that all\ncapitalist profit is ultimately derived from the exploitation of the\nworker. Capitalism’s dirty secret is that it is not a realm of\nharmony and mutual benefit but a system in which one class\nsystematically extracts profit from another. How could this fail to be\nunjust? Yet it is notable that Marx never explicitly draws such a\nconclusion, and in Capital he goes as far as to say that such\nexchange is “by no means an injury to the seller” (MECW\n35: 204), which some commentators have taken as evidence that Marx did\nnot think that capitalism was unjust, although other readings are\npossible. \nAllen Wood (1972) is perhaps the leading advocate of the view that\nMarx did not believe that capitalism is unjust. Wood argues that Marx\ntakes this approach because his general theoretical approach excludes\nany trans-epochal standpoint from which one can comment on the justice\nof an economic system. Even though it is acceptable to criticise\nparticular behaviour from within an economic structure as unjust (and\ntheft under capitalism would be an example) it is not possible to\ncriticise capitalism as a whole. This is a consequence of Marx’s\nanalysis of the role of ideas of justice from within historical\nmaterialism. Marx claims that juridical institutions are part of the\nsuperstructure, and that ideas of justice are\nideological. Accordingly, the role of both the superstructure and\nideology, in the functionalist reading of historical materialism\nadopted here, is to stabilise the economic structure. Consequently, to\nstate that something is just under capitalism is simply a judgement\nthat it will tend to have the effect of advancing capitalism.\nAccording to Marx, in any society the ruling ideas are those of the\nruling class; the core of the theory of ideology. \nZiyad Husami (1978) however, argues that Wood is mistaken,\nignoring the fact that for Marx ideas undergo a double determination.\nWe need to differentiate not just by economic system, but also by\neconomic class within the system. Therefore the ideas of the\nnon-ruling class may be very different from those of the ruling class.\nOf course, it is the ideas of the ruling class that receive attention\nand implementation, but this does not mean that other ideas do not\nexist. Husami goes as far as to argue that members of the proletariat\nunder capitalism have an account of justice that matches communism.\nFrom this privileged standpoint of the proletariat, which is also\nMarx’s standpoint, capitalism is unjust, and so it follows that\nMarx thought capitalism unjust. \nPlausible though it may sound, Husami’s argument fails to\naccount for two related points. First, it cannot explain why Marx\nnever explicitly described capitalism as unjust, and second, it\noverlooks the distance Marx wanted to place between his own scientific\nsocialism, and that of other socialists who argued for the injustice\nof capitalism. Hence one cannot avoid the conclusion that the\n“official” view of Marx is that capitalism is not\nunjust. \nNevertheless, this leaves us with a puzzle. Much of Marx’s\ndescription of capitalism—his use of the words\n“embezzlement”, “robbery” and\n“exploitation”—belie the official account. Arguably,\nthe only satisfactory way of understanding this issue is, once more,\nfrom G.A. Cohen, who proposes that Marx believed that capitalism was\nunjust, but did not believe that he believed it was unjust (Cohen\n1983). In other words, Marx, like so many of us, did not have perfect\nknowledge of his own mind. In his explicit reflections on the justice\nof capitalism he was able to maintain his official view. But in less\nguarded moments his real view slips out, even if never in explicit\nlanguage. Such an interpretation is bound to be controversial, but it\nmakes good sense of the texts. \nWhatever one concludes on the question of whether Marx thought\ncapitalism unjust, it is, nevertheless, obvious that Marx thought that\ncapitalism was not the best way for human beings to live. Points made\nin his early writings remain present throughout his writings, if no\nlonger connected to an explicit theory of alienation. The worker finds\nwork a torment, suffers poverty, overwork and lack of fulfilment and\nfreedom. People do not relate to each other as humans should. Does\nthis amount to a moral criticism of capitalism or not? In the absence\nof any special reason to argue otherwise, it simply seems obvious that\nMarx’s critique is a moral one. Capitalism impedes human\nflourishing. It is hard to disagree with the judgement that Marx \nthinks that the capitalist exploitation of labor power is a wrong that\nhas horrendous consequences for the laborers. (Roberts 2017: 129) \nMarx, though, once more refrained from making this explicit; he seemed\nto show no interest in locating his criticism of capitalism in any of\nthe traditions of moral philosophy, or explaining how he was\ngenerating a new tradition. There may have been two reasons for his\ncaution. The first was that while there were bad things about\ncapitalism, there is, from a world historical point of view, much good\nabout it too. For without capitalism, communism would not be possible.\nCapitalism is to be transcended, not abolished, and this may be\ndifficult to convey in the terms of moral philosophy. \nSecond, and perhaps more importantly, we need to return to the\ncontrast between Marxian and other forms of socialism. Many\nnon-Marxian socialists appealed to universal ideas of truth and\njustice to defend their proposed schemes, and their theory of\ntransition was based on the idea that appealing to moral sensibilities\nwould be the best, perhaps only, way of bringing about the new chosen\nsociety. Marx wanted to distance himself from these other socialist\ntraditions, and a key point of distinction was to argue that the route\nto understanding the possibilities of human emancipation lay in the\nanalysis of historical and social forces, not in morality. Hence, for\nMarx, any appeal to morality was theoretically a backward step. \nThis leads us now to Marx’s assessment of communism. Would\ncommunism be a just society? In considering Marx’s attitude to\ncommunism and justice there are really only two viable possibilities:\neither he thought that communism would be a just society or he thought\nthat the concept of justice would not apply: that communism would\ntranscend justice. \nCommunism is described by Marx, in the Critique of the Gotha\nProgramme, as a society in which each person should contribute\naccording to their ability and receive according to their need. This\ncertainly sounds like a theory of justice, and could be adopted as\nsuch (Gilabert 2015). However, many will hold that it is truer to\nMarx’s thought to say that this is part of an account in which\ncommunism transcends justice, as Lukes has argued (Lukes 1987). \nIf we start with the idea that the point of ideas of justice is to\nresolve disputes, then a society without disputes would have no need\nor place for justice. We can see this by reflecting upon the idea of\nthe circumstances of justice in the work of David Hume\n(1711–1776). Hume argued that if there was enormous material\nabundance—if everyone could have whatever they wanted without\ninvading another’s share—we would never have devised rules\nof justice. And, of course, there are suggestions in Marx’s\nwritings that communism would be a society of such abundance. But Hume\nalso suggested that justice would not be needed in other\ncircumstances; if there were complete fellow-feeling between all human\nbeings, there would be no conflict and no need for justice. Of course,\none can argue whether either material abundance or human\nfellow-feeling to this degree would be possible, but the point is that\nboth arguments give a clear sense in which communism transcends\njustice. \nNevertheless, we remain with the question of whether Marx thought that\ncommunism could be commended on other moral grounds. On a broad\nunderstanding, in which morality, or perhaps better to say ethics, is\nconcerned with the idea of living well, it seems that communism can be\nassessed favourably in this light. One compelling argument is that\nMarx’s career simply makes no sense unless we can attribute such\na belief to him. But beyond this we can be brief in that the\nconsiderations adduced in\n Section 2\n above apply again. Communism clearly advances human flourishing, in\nMarx’s view. The only reason for denying that, in Marx’s\nvision, it would amount to a good society is a theoretical antipathy\nto the word “good”. And here the main point is that, in\nMarx’s view, communism would not be brought about by high-minded\nbenefactors of humanity. Quite possibly his determination to retain\nthis point of difference between himself and other socialists led him\nto disparage the importance of morality to a degree that goes beyond\nthe call of theoretical necessity. \nThe account of ideology contained in Marx’s writings is\nregularly portrayed as a crucial element of his intellectual legacy.\nIt has been identified as among his “most influential”\nideas (Elster 1986: 168), and acclaimed as “the most\nfertile” part of his social and political theory (Leiter 2004:\n84). Not least, these views on ideology are said to constitute\nMarx’s claim to a place—alongside Friedrich Nietzsche\n(1844–1900) and Sigmund Freud (1856–1939)—as one of\nthe “masters of suspicion”; that is, as an author whose\nwork casts doubt on the transparency of our everyday understandings of\nboth our own identity and the social world we inhabit (Ricouer 1970:\n32–33). \nGiven this enthusiastic reception, it can come as something of a\nsurprise to turn to Marx’s writings and discover how little they\ncontain about ideology, and how inchoate and opaque those infrequent\nand passing observations on that topic are. There are, of course, some\nfamous quotations, not least from The German Ideology\nmanuscripts. The references there to ideology as involving an\n“inversion” of the relation between individuals and their\ncircumstances, perhaps analogous to the workings of a “camera\nobscura”—an optical device which projected an image of its\nsurroundings, upside down but preserving perspective, onto a screen\ninside—have often mesmerised commentators but not always\ngenerated much genuine illumination (MECW 5: 36). The point\nshould not be exaggerated, but these striking images notwithstanding,\nthere is no clear and sustained discussion of ideology in the Marxian\ncorpus. \nMany commentators maintain that the search for a single model of\nideology in his work has to be given up. Indeed, there is something of\nan “arms race” in the literature, as commentators discover\ntwo, three, even five, competing models of ideology in Marx’s\nwritings (Mepham 1979; Wood 1981 [2004]; Rosen 1996). Most\nsurprisingly, it seems that some licence can be found in Marx’s\ncorpus for three very different ways of thinking about what ideology\nis. There is textual evidence of his variously utilising: a\n“descriptive” account of ideology involving a broadly\nanthropological study of the beliefs and rituals characteristic of\ncertain groups; a “positive” account of ideology as a\n“worldview” providing the members of a group with a sense\nof meaning and identity; and a “critical” account seeking\nto liberate individuals from certain false and misleading forms of\nunderstanding (Geuss 1981: 4–26). \nIt is the last of these—the critical account rather than either\nof the two “non-critical” accounts—which is central\nto his wider social and political theory, but this account is itself\nsubject to some considerable interpretative disagreement. Marx’s\ntheory of ideology is usually portrayed as an element in what might be\ncalled Marx’s sociology, as distinct from his philosophical\nanthropology say, or his theory of history (although complexly related\nto the latter). \nMarx does not view ideology as a feature of all societies, and, in\nparticular, suggests that it will not be a feature of a future\ncommunist society. However, ideology is portrayed as a feature of all\nclass-divided societies, and not only of capitalist\nsociety—although many of Marx’s comments on ideology are\nconcerned with the latter. The theory of ideology appears to play a\nrole in explaining a feature of class-divided societies which might\notherwise appear puzzling, namely what might be called their\n“stability”; that is, the absence of overt and serious\nconflict between social classes. This stability is not permanent, but\nit can last for extended historical periods. This stability appears\npuzzling to Marx because class-divided societies are flawed in ways\nwhich not only frustrate human flourishing, but also work to the\nmaterial advantage of the ruling minority. Why do the subordinate\nclasses, who form a majority, tolerate these flaws, when resistance\nand rebellion of various kinds might be in their objective\ninterests? \nMarx’s account of the sources of social stability in\nclass-divided societies appeals to both repressive and non-repressive\nmechanisms. Such societies might often involve the direct repression\n(or the threat of it) of one group by another, but Marx does not think\nthat this is the whole story. There are also non-repressive sources of\nsocial stability, and ideology is usually, and plausibly, considered\none of these. Very roughly, Marx’s account of ideology claims\nthat the dominant social ideas in such societies are typically false\nor misleading in a fashion that works to the advantage of the\neconomically dominant class. \nWe should note that ideology would seem to be a part and not the whole\nof Marx’s account of the non-repressive sources of stability in\nclass divided societies. Other factors might include: dull economic\npressure, including the daily grind of having to earn a living;\ndoubts—justified or otherwise—about the feasibility of\nalternatives; sensitivity to the possible costs of radical social\nchange; and collective action problems of various kinds which face\nthose who do want to rebel and resist. Marx does not think individuals\nare permanently trapped within ideological modes of thinking. Ideology\nmay have an initial hold, but it is not portrayed as impervious to\nreason and evidence, especially in circumstances in which the\nobjective conditions for social change obtain. \nFor Marx ideological beliefs are social in that they are widely\nshared, indeed so widely-shared that for long periods they constitute\nthe “ruling” or “dominant” ideas in a given\nclass-divided society (MECW 5: 59). And they are social in\nthat they directly concern, or indirectly impact upon, the\naction-guiding understandings of self and society that individuals\nhave. These action-guiding understandings include the dominant legal,\npolitical, religious, and philosophical views within particular\nclass-divided societies in periods of stability (MECW 29: 263). \nNot all false or misleading beliefs count for Marx as ideological.\nHonest scientific error, for example can be non-ideological. And\nideological belief can be misleading without being strictly false. For\nexample, defenders of the capitalist economy portray what Marx calls\nthe “wage form”, with its exchange of equivalents, as the\nwhole (rather than a part) of the story about the relation between\ncapital and labour, thereby ignoring the exploitation which occurs in\nthe sphere of production. Indeed, the notion of the\n“falsity” of ideology needs to be expanded beyond the\ncontent of the “ideas” in question, to include cases where\ntheir origins are in some way contaminated (Geuss 1981: 19–22).\nPerhaps the only reason I believe something to be the case is that the\nbelief in question has a consoling effect on me. Arguably such a\nbelief is held ideologically, even if it happens to be true.\nNevertheless paradigmatic examples of ideology have a false content.\nFor example, ideology often portrays institutions, policies, and\ndecisions which are in the interests of the economically dominant\nclass, as being in the interests of the society as a whole\n(MECW 5: 60); and ideology often portrays social and\npolitical arrangements which are contingent, or historical, or\nartificial, as being necessary, or universal, or natural\n(MECW 35: 605). \nIn addition to false or misleading content, ideological beliefs\ntypically have at least two additional characteristics, relating to\ntheir social origin and their class function. By the “social\norigin” of ideology is meant that Marx thinks of these ideas as\noften originating with, and being reinforced by, the complex structure\nof class-divided societies—a complex structure in which a\ndeceptive surface appearance is governed by underlying essential\nrelations (Geras 1986: 63–84). Capitalism is seen as especially\ndeceptive in appearance; for example, Marx often contrasts the\nrelative transparency of “exploitation” under feudalism,\nwith the way in which the “wage form” obscures the ratio\nof necessary and surplus labour in capitalist societies. Ideology\nstems, in part, from this deceptive surface appearance which makes it\ndifficult to grasp the underlying social flaws that benefit the\neconomically dominant class. Marx portrays the striving to uncover\nessences concealed by misleading appearances as characteristic of\nscientific endeavour (MECW 37, 804). And, in this context, he\ndistinguishes between classical political economy, which\nstrove—albeit not always successfully—to uncover the\nessential relations often concealed behind misleading appearances, and\nwhat he calls vulgar economy, which happily restricts itself to the\nmisleading appearances themselves (MECW 37, 804). \nBy the “class function” of ideology is meant that Marx\nholds that the pervasiveness of ideology is explained by the fact it\nhelps stabilise the economic structure of societies. All sorts of\nideas might get generated for all sorts of reasons, but the ones that\ntend to “stick” (become widely accepted) in class-divided\nsocieties do so, not because of their truth, but because they conceal\nor misrepresent or justify flaws in that society in ways which redound\nto the benefit of the economically dominant class (Rosen & Wolff\n1996: 235–236). \nIn response critics often see this as just another example of sloppy\nfunctional reasoning—purportedly widespread in the Marxist\ntradition—whereby a general pattern is asserted without the\nidentification of any of the mechanisms which might generate that\npattern. In the present case, it is said that Marx never properly\nexplains why the ruling ideas should be those of the ruling class\n(Elster 1985: 473). Yet there are obvious possible mechanisms here. To\ngive two examples. First, there is the control of the ruling class\nover the means of mental production, and in particular the print and\nbroadcast media which in capitalist societies are typically owned and\ncontrolled by the very wealthy (MECW 5, 59). A second\npossible mechanism appeals to the psychological need of individuals\nfor invented narratives that legitimise or justify their social\nposition; for instance, Marx identifies a widespread need, in flawed\nsocieties, for the consolatory effects of religion (MECW 3,\n175). \nThis broad heading—the state and politics—could cover very\nmany different issues. To make the present account manageable, only\ntwo are addressed here: Marx’s account of the state in\ncapitalist society; and Marx’s account of the fate of the state\nin communist society. (Consequently, many other important political\nissues—the nature of pre-capitalist states, relations between\nstates, the political transition to communism, and so on—are not\ndealt with.) \nMarx offers no unified theoretical account of the state in capitalist\nsociety. Instead his remarks on this topic are scattered across the\ncourse of his activist life, and deeply embedded in discussions of\ncontemporary events, events which most modern readers will know very\nlittle about. Providing some initial order to that complexity, Jon\nElster helpfully identifies three different models in Marx’s\nwritings of the relationship, in capitalist society, between the\npolitical state, on the one hand, and the economically dominant class,\non the other. (The next three paragraphs draw heavily on Elster 1985:\n409–437.) \nFirst, the “instrumental” model portrays the state as\nsimply a tool, directly controlled by the economically dominant class,\nin its own interests, at the expense of the interests both of other\nclasses and of the community as a whole. Marx is usually said to\nendorse the instrumental account in the Communist Manifesto,\nwhere he and Engels insist that “the executive of the modern\nstate is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole\nbourgeoisie” (MECW 6: 486). On this account, the state\nmight also act against the short term, or the factional, interests of\nparticular capitalists. The picture here is of the state as an\ninstrument directed—presumably by a subset of capitalists or\ntheir representatives—in ways which promote the long term\ninterests of the bourgeoisie as a whole. The precise mechanisms which\nmight facilitate that result are not clear in Marx’s\nwritings. \nSecond, the “class balance” model portrays the state as\nhaving interests of its own, with capitalist interests as merely one\nof the strategic limits on its pursuit of these. This model gets its\nname from the exceptional social circumstances said to explain the\nindependence of the state in this case. In situations where the social\npower of the two warring classes of contemporary\nsociety—capitalists and workers—are very nearly balanced,\nthe political state (and especially the executive) can gain\nindependence from both, exploiting that conflict in order to promote\nits own interests (the interests of the political caste). Something\nlike this picture appears in Marx’s discussions of the continued\nexistence of certain absolutist states after the revolutions of 1848,\nand of the Bonapartist state established in France by the coup of\nNapoleon III in December 1851. The state now competes with capitalists\nand proletarians (and is not merely the tool of the former), and by\n“promising each of the major classes to protect it against the\nother, the government can rule autonomously” (Elster 1985: 425).\nOn this account, the state has interests of its own, but presumably\nonly gets to pursue them if those promises to others are plausible,\nfinding some reflection in its policies and behaviour. Capitalist\ninterests accordingly remain a political constraint, but they are now\nonly one of the factors constraining the state’s actions rather\nthan constituting its primary goal. \nThird, the “abdication” model presents the bourgeoisie as\nstaying away from the direct exercise of political power, but doing\nthis because it is in their economic interests to do so. As Elster\nnotes, strictly speaking, “abdication” here covers two\nslightly different cases—first, where the bourgeoisie\nabdicate from the political power that they initially\ncontrolled (relevant to France); and, second, where the bourgeoisie\nabstain from taking political power in the first place\n(relevant to Britain and Germany)—but they can be treated\ntogether. In both cases, Marx identifies a situation where “in\norder to save its purse, [the bourgeoisie] must forfeit the\ncrown” (MECW 11: 143). Where the instrumental picture\nclaims that the state acts in the interests of the capitalist class\nbecause it is directly controlled by the latter, the\nabdication picture advances an explanatory connection between\nthe promotion of bourgeois interests and the retreat from the direct\nexercise of power. Circumstances obtain where “the political\nrule of the bourgeoisie” turns out to be\n“incompatible” with its continued economic flourishing,\nand the bourgeoisie seeks “to get rid of its own political rule\nin order to get rid of the troubles and dangers of ruling”\n(MECW 11: 173). There are several possible explanations of\nwhy the bourgeoisie might remain outside of politics in order to\npromote their own interests. To give three examples: the bourgeoisie\nmight recognise that their own characteristic short-termism could be\nfatal to their own interests if they exercised direct political as\nwell as economic power; the bourgeoisie might find political rule\nsufficiently time and effort consuming to withdraw from it,\ndiscovering that the economic benefits kept on coming regardless; or\nthe bourgeoisie might appreciate that abdication weakened their class\nopponents, forcing the proletariat to fight on two fronts (against\ncapital and government) and thereby making it less able to win those\nstruggles. \nThere are many questions one might have about these three models. \nFirst, one might wonder which of these three models best embodies\nMarx’s considered view? The instrumental account is the earliest\naccount, which he largely abandons from the early 1850s, presumably\nnoticing how poorly it captured contemporary political\nrealities—in particular, the stable existence of states which\nwere not directly run by the capitalist class, but which still in some\nway served their interests. That outcome is possible under either of\nthe two other accounts. However, Marx seems to have thought of the\nclass balance model as a temporary solution in exceptional\ncircumstances, and perhaps held that it failed to allow the stable\nexplanatory connection that he sought between the extant political\narrangements and the promotion of dominant economic interests. In\nshort, for better or worse, Marx’s considered view looks closer\nto the abdication account, reflecting his conviction that the central\nfeatures of political life are explained by the existing economic\nstructure. \nSecond, one might wonder which model allows greatest\n“autonomy” to the political state? A weak definition of\nstate autonomy might portray the state as autonomous when it is\nindependent of direct control by the economically dominant class. On\nthis definition, both the class balance and abdication\nmodels—but not the instrumental account—seem to provide\nfor autonomy. A stronger definition of state autonomy might require\nwhat Elster calls “explanatory autonomy”, which exists \nwhen (and to the extent that) its structure and policies cannot be\nexplained by the interest of an economically dominant class. (Elster\n1985: 405) \nOnly the class balance view seems to allow significant explanatory\nautonomy. In his preferred abdication account, Marx allows that the\nstate in capitalist society is independent of direct capitalist\ncontrol, but goes on to claim that its main structures (including that\nvery independence) and policies are ultimately explained by the\ninterests of the capitalist class. \nFor reasons discussed below (see\n Section 8),\n Marx declines to say much about the basic structure of a future\ncommunist society. However, in the case of the fate of the state, that\nreluctance is partially mitigated by his view that the institutional\narrangements of the Paris Commune prefigured the political dimensions\nof communist society. \nMarx’s views on the nature and fate of the state in communist\nsociety are to be distinguished from his infrequent, and subsequently\nnotorious, use of the term “the dictatorship of the\nproletariat”. (On the infrequency, context, and content, of\nthese uses see Draper 1986 and Hunt 1974.) The idea of\n“dictatorship” in this historical context has the\n(ancient) connotation of emergency rule rather than the (modern)\nconnotation of totalitarianism. Marx’s use makes it clear that\nany such temporary government should be democratic; for instance, in\nhaving majority support, and in preserving democratic rights (of\nspeech, association, and so on). However, it is by definition\n“extra-legal” in that it seeks to establish a new regime\nand not to preserve an old one. So understood, the dictatorship of the\nproletariat forms part of the political transition to communist\nsociety (a topic not covered here), rather than part of the\ninstitutional structure of communist society itself. The\n“dictatorial”—that is, the temporary and\nextra-legal—character of this regime ends with establishment of\na new and stable polity, and it is the latter which is discussed here\n(Hunt 1974: 297). \nThe character of the state in communist society consists, in part, of\nits form (its institutional arrangements) and its function (the tasks\nthat it undertakes). \nSome sense of the form of the state in communist society can\nbe gained from Marx’s engagement with the Paris Commune. His\npreferred future political arrangements involve a high degree of\nparticipation, and the radical “de-professionalisation” of\ncertain public offices. First, Marx is enthusiastic about regular\nelections, universal suffrage, mandat impératif,\nrecall, open executive proceedings, decentralisation, and so on.\nSecond, he objects to public offices (in the legislature, executive,\nand judiciary) being the spoils of a political caste, and sought to\nmake them working positions, remunerated at the average worker’s\nwage, and regularly circulating (through election). This combination\nof arrangements has been characterised as “democracy without\nprofessionals” (Hunt 1974: 365). Marx saw it as reflecting his\nview that: \nFreedom consists in converting the state from an organ superimposed\nupon society into one completely subordinate to it. (MECW 24:\n94) \nSome sense of the function of the state in communist society\ncan be gained from Marx’s distinction between\n“necessary” tasks that a state would need to undertake in\nall societies (at least, economically developed societies), and\n“unnecessary” tasks that a state would only need to\nundertake in class-divided societies. The difficulty here is less in\nallowing this distinction, than in deciding what might fall into each\ncategory. On the necessary side, Marx appears to require that the\nstate in communist society provide both: democratic solutions to\ncoordination problems (deciding which side of the road traffic should\ndrive on, for instance); and the supply of public goods (health,\nwelfare, education, and so on). On the unnecessary side, Marx seems to\nthink that a communist society might hugely reduce, or even eliminate,\nthe element of organised coercion found in most states (in the form of\nstanding armies, police forces, and so on). At least, this reduction\nmight be feasible once communist society had reached its higher stage\n(where distribution is based on “the needs principle”),\nand there is no longer a threat from non-communist societies. \nAgain, there are many reservations that one might have about this\naccount. \nFirst, many will be sceptical about its feasibility, and perhaps\nespecially of the purported reduction, still less elimination, of\nstate coercion. That scepticism might be motivated by the thought that\nthis would only be possible if communist society were characterised by\nwidespread social and political consensus, and that such consensus is,\nboth unlikely (at least, in modern societies), and undesirable\n(diversity and disagreement having a value). However, the reduction,\nor even elimination, of state coercion might be compatible with\ncertain forms of continuing disagreement about the ends and means of\ncommunist society. Imagine that a democratic communist polity\nintroduces a new law prohibiting smoking in public places, and that a\nrepresentative smoker (call her Anne) obeys that law despite being\namong the minority who wanted this practice permitted. Anne’s\nmotivation for obedience, we can stipulate, is grounded, not in fear\nof the likely response of bodies of armed persons enforcing the law,\nbut rather in respect for the democratic majority of the community of\nwhich she is a part. In short, reasonably strong assumptions about the\ndemocratic commitments of individuals might allow the scaling down of\norganised coercion without having to presume universal agreement\namongst citizens on all issues. \nSecond, some might object to the reference, throughout this section,\nto the “state” in communist society. It might be said that\na polity whose form and functions are so radically\ntransformed—the form by democratic participation and\nde-professionalisation, the function by eliminating historically\nunnecessary tasks—is insufficiently “state-like” to\nbe called a state. That is certainly possible, but the terminological\nclaim would appear to assume that there is greater clarity and\nagreement about just what a state is, either than is presupposed here\nor than exists in the world. Given that lack of consensus,\n“state” seems a suitably prudent choice. As well as being\nconsistent with some of Marx’s usage, it avoids prejudging this\nvery issue. However, anyone unmoved by those considerations can simply\nreplace “state”, in this context, with their own preferred\nalternative. \nIt is well-known that Marx never provided a detailed account of the\nbasic structure of the future communist society that he predicted.\nThis was not simply an omission on his part, but rather reflects his\ndeliberate commitment, as he colloquially has it, to refrain from\nwriting “recipes” for the “restaurants” of the\nfuture (MECW 35: 17, translation amended). \nThe reasoning that underpins this commitment can be reconstructed from\nMarx’s engagement with the radical political tradition that he\ncalled “utopian socialism”, and whose founding triumvirate\nwere Charles Fourier (1772–1837), Henri Saint-Simon\n(1760–1825), and Robert Owen (1771–1858). Note that the\ndistinction between Marxian socialism and utopian socialism is not an\nexhaustive one. Marx happily allows that there are socialists who are\nneither Marxian nor Utopian; for example, the “feudal\nsocialists” discussed in the Communist Manifesto. \nWhat distinguishes utopian from other socialists is, in large part,\ntheir view that providing persuasive constructive plans and\nblueprints of future socialist arrangements is a legitimate and\nnecessary activity. (The expression “plans and blueprints”\nis used here to capture the necessary detail of these\ndescriptions, and not to suggest that these designs have to be thought\nof as “stipulative”, as having to be followed to the\nletter.) On the utopian account, the socialist future needs to be\ndesigned before it can be delivered; the plans and blueprints being\nintended to guide and motivate socialists in their transformative\nambitions. Of course, that Marx is not in this sense utopian\ndoes not rule out the possibility of additional (here unspecified)\nsenses in which he might accurately be so described. \nMarx’s account of utopian socialism might appear contradictory.\nIt is certainly easy to find not only passages fiercely criticising\nutopian authors and texts, but also passages generously praising them.\nHowever, that criticism and that praise turn out to attach to slightly\ndifferent targets, revealing an underlying and consistent structure to\nhis account. \nThat underlying structure rests on two main distinctions. The first\ndistinction is a chronological one running between the\nfounding triumvirate, on the one hand, and second and subsequent\ngenerations of utopian socialists, on the other. (These later\ngenerations including both loyal followers of the founding\ntriumvirate, and independent later figures such as Étienne\nCabet (1788–1856)). The second distinction is a\nsubstantive one running between the critical part of utopian\nwritings (the portrayal of faults within contemporary capitalist\nsociety), on the one hand, and the constructive part of utopian\nwritings (the detailed description of the ideal socialist future), on\nthe other. \nNote that these distinctions underpin the asymmetry of Marx’s\nassessment of utopian socialism. Simply put: he is more enthusiastic\nand positive about the achievements of the first generation of\nutopians, by comparison with those of second and subsequent\ngenerations; and he is more enthusiastic and positive about the\nutopians’ criticism of contemporary society, by comparison with\nthe utopians’ constructive endeavours. \nThe remainder of this section will focus on Marx’s disapproval\nof the constructive endeavours of the utopians. \nIn trying to organise and understand Marx’s various criticisms\nof utopianism, it is helpful to distinguish between foundational and\nnon-foundational variants. (This distinction is intended to be\nexhaustive, in that all of his criticisms of utopianism will fall into\none of these two categories.) Non-foundational criticisms of\nutopian socialism are those which, if sound, would provide us with a\nreason to reject views which might be held by, or even be\ncharacteristic of, utopian socialists, but which are not constitutive\nof their utopianism. That is, they would give us a reason to abandon\nthe relevant beliefs, or to criticise those (including utopians) who\nheld them, but they would not give us cause to reject utopianism as\nsuch. In contrast, foundational criticisms of utopian\nsocialism are those which, if sound, would provide us with a reason to\nreject utopianism as such; that is, a reason to refrain from engaging\nin socialist design, a reason not to describe in relevant detail the\nsocialist society of the future. (Of course, that reason might not be\ndecisive, all things considered, but it would still count against\nutopianism per se.) \nMany of Marx’s best-known criticisms of utopian socialism are\nnon-foundational. For instance, in the Communist Manifesto,\nhe complains that utopian socialists hold a mistaken\n“ahistorical” view of social change. The utopians\npurportedly fail to understand that the achievement of socialism\ndepends on conditions which can only emerge at a certain stage of\nhistorical development. They might, for instance, recognise that there\nare strategic preconditions for socialism (for instance, the right\nblueprint and sufficient will to put it into practice), but\n(mistakenly on Marx’s account) imagine that those preconditions\ncould have appeared at any point in time. This complaint is\nnon-foundational in that one can accept that there are historical\nconditions for establishing a socialist society, and that the utopian\nsocialists fail to understand this, without thereby having a reason to\nabandon utopianism as such. A commitment to the necessity and\ndesirability of socialist design does not require one to hold an\n“ahistorical” view of social change. \nAssessing the soundness of non-foundational criticisms, and their\nrelevance to the utopian socialist tradition, is a complicated task\n(see Leopold 2018). However, even if sound and relevant, these\ncriticisms would provide no reason to abandon utopianism as\nsuch. Consequently, they are pursued no further here. Instead,\nthe focus is on the three main foundational arguments against\nutopianism that can be located in Marx’s writings; namely, that\nutopian plans and blueprints are necessarily undemocratic,\nimpossible, and redundant (see Leopold 2016). \nMarx’s first argument involves a normative claim that\nutopian plans and blueprints are undemocratic.\n(“Democracy” here connoting individual and collective\nself-determination, rather than political forms of governance.) The\nbasic argument runs: that it is undemocratic to limit the\nself-determination of individuals; that providing a plan or blueprint\nfor a socialist society limits the self-determination of individuals;\nand that therefore the provision of plans and blueprints for a\nsocialist society is undemocratic. If we add in the assumption that\nundemocratic means are undesirable; then we can conclude that it is\nundesirable to provide plans or blueprints of a future socialist\nsociety. One central reason for resisting this argument is that it is\nhard to identify a plausible account of the conditions for\nself-determination, according to which it is necessarily true that\nmerely providing a socialist plan or blueprint restricts\nself-determination. Indeed, one might heretically think that detailed\nplans and blueprints often tend to promote self-determination, helping\nindividuals think about where it is they want to go, and how they want\nto get there. \nMarx’s second argument rests on an epistemological\nclaim that that utopian plans and blueprints are impossible,\nbecause they require accurate knowledge of the future of a kind which\ncannot be had. The basic argument starts from the assumption that to\nbe of any use a blueprint must facilitate the construction of a future\nsocialist society. Moreover, to facilitate the construction of a\nfuture socialist society a blueprint must be completely accurate; and\nto be completely accurate a blueprint must predict all the relevant\ncircumstances of that future society. However, since it is not\npossible—given the complexity of the social world and the\nlimitations of human nature—to predict all the relevant\ncircumstances of that future society, we can conclude that socialist\nblueprints are of no use. One central reason for resisting this\nargument is that, whilst it is hard to deny that completely accurate\nplans are impossible (given the complexity of the world and the\nlimitations of human understanding), the claim that only completely\naccurate plans are useful seems doubtful. Plans are not simply\npredictions, and providing less than wholly accurate plans for\nourselves often forms part of the process whereby we help determine\nthe future for ourselves (insofar as that is possible). \nMarx’s third argument depends on an empirical claim\nthat utopian plans and blueprints are unnecessary, because\nsatisfactory solutions to social problems emerge automatically from\nthe unfolding of the historical process without themselves needing to\nbe designed. The basic argument runs as follows: that utopian\nblueprints describe the basic structure of the socialist society of\nthe future; and that such blueprints are necessary if and only if the\nbasic structure of future socialist society needs to be designed.\nHowever, given that the basic structure of the future socialist\nsociety develops automatically (without design assistance) within\ncapitalist society; and that the role of human agency in this\nunfolding historical process is to deliver (not design) that basic\nstructure, Marx concludes that utopian blueprints are redundant.\nReasons for resisting this argument include scepticism about both\nMarx’s reasoning and the empirical record. Marx is certain that\nhumankind does not need to design the basic structure of the future\nsocialist society, but it is not really made clear who or what does\nthat designing in its place. Moreover, the path of historical\ndevelopment since Marx’s day does not obviously confirm the\ncomplex empirical claim that the basic structure of socialist society\nis developing automatically within existing capitalism, needing only\nto be delivered (and not designed) by human agency. \nThis brief discussion suggests that there are cogent grounds for\ndoubting Marx’s claim that utopian plans and blueprints are\nnecessarily undemocratic, impossible, and redundant. \nFinally, recall that Marx is less enthusiastic about the second and\nsubsequent generations of utopians, than he is about the original\ntriumvirate. We might reasonably wonder about the rationale for\ngreater criticism of later utopians. It is important to recognise that\nit is not that second and subsequent generations make more or grosser\nerrors than the original triumvirate. (Indeed, Marx appears to think\nthat all these different generations largely held the same views, and\nmade the same mistakes). The relevant difference is rather that, by\ncomparison with their successors, this first generation were not to\nblame for those errors. In short, the rationale behind Marx’s\npreference for the first over the second and subsequent generations of\nutopian socialists is based on an understanding of historical\ndevelopment and an associated notion of culpability. \nMarx held that the intellectual formation of this first generation\ntook place in a historical context (the cusp of the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries) which was sufficiently developed to provoke\nsocialist criticism, but not sufficiently developed for that socialist\ncriticism to escape serious misunderstandings (Cohen 2000: 51). Since\nneither the material conditions of modern society, nor the historical\nagent capable of bringing socialism about, were sufficiently\ndeveloped, this first generation were bound to develop faulty accounts\nof the nature of, and transition to, socialism. However, that\ndefence—the historical unavoidability of error—is not\navailable to subsequent generations who, despite significantly changed\ncircumstances, hold fast to the original views of their intellectual\nforerunners. Marx maintains that more recent utopians, unlike the\noriginal triumvirate, really ought to know better. \nAt this point, we might be expected briefly to survey Marx’s\nlegacy. \nThat legacy is often elaborated in terms of movements and thinkers.\nHowever, so understood, the controversy and scale of that legacy make\nbrevity impossible, and this entry is already long enough. All we can\ndo here is gesture at the history and mention some further\nreading. \nThe chronology here might provisionally be divided into three\nhistorical periods: from Marx’s death until the Russia\nRevolution (1917); from the Russian Revolution to the fall of the\nBerlin Wall (1989); and since 1989. It seems hard to say much that is\ncertain about the last of these periods, but some generalisations\nabout the first two might be hazarded. \nThat first period of “Classical Marxism” can be thought of\nin two generational waves. The first smaller group of theorists was\nassociated with the Second International, and includes Karl Kautsky\n(1854–1938) and Plekhanov. The succeeding more activist\ngeneration includes Rosa Luxemburg (1871–1919), V.I. Lenin\n(1870–1924) and Leon Trotsky (1879–1940). \nThe second period is perhaps dominated by “Soviet Marxism”\nand the critical reaction from other Marxists that it provoked. The\nrepressive bureaucratic regimes which solidified in the Soviet Union\nand Eastern Europe repressed independent theoretical work, including\nscholarly editorial work on the writings of Marx and Engels. However,\nthey also provoked a critical reaction in the form of a body of\nthought often called “Western Marxism”, usually said to\ninclude the work of Antonio Gramsci (1891–1937), Theodor Adorno\n(1903–1969), and Althusser. The later parts of this period saw\nthe continuing development of “Critical Theory”, as well\nas the birth of currents such as “Analytical Marxism”\nwhose longer term impact is uncertain. \nThese first two periods are both partly covered by the Polish\nphilosopher and historian of ideas, Leszek Kołakowski, in the\nfinal two volumes of his encyclopaedic three volume Main Currents\nof Marxism (1976 [1978]). A succinct critical account of the\nemergence and distinctive character of Western Marxism is provided by\nPerry Anderson in his Considerations on Western Marxism\n(1976). And some of the more philosophically interesting authors in\nthis latter tradition are also covered elsewhere in this Encyclopaedia\n(see the\n Related Entries\n section below). Finally, and edging a little into the third of these\nhistorical periods, Christoph Henning offers an account of the (mis)\nreadings of Marx—especially those replacing social theory with\nmoral philosophy—in German philosophy from Heidegger to Habermas\nand beyond, in his Philosophy After Marx (2014). \nHowever, we might also think of Marx’s legacy, less in terms of\nthinkers and movements, and more in terms of reasons for wanting to\nstudy Marx’s ideas. In that context, we would stress that this\nis not simply a question of the truth of his various substantive\nclaims. The work of philosophers is, of course, also valued for the\noriginality, insight, potential, and so on, that it may also contain.\nAnd, so judged, Marx’s writings have much to offer. \nThe various strands of Marx’s thought surveyed here include his\nphilosophical anthropology, his theory of history, his critical\nengagement with the economic and political dimensions of capitalism,\nand a frustratingly vague outline of what might replace it. Whatever\nthe connections between these threads, it seems implausible to suggest\nthat Marx’s ideas form a system which has to be swallowed or\nrejected in its entirety. It might, for instance, be that Marx’s\ndiagnosis looks more persuasive than his remedies. Readers may have\nlittle confidence in his solutions, but that does not mean that the\nproblems he identifies are not acute.","contact.mail":"jonathan.wolff@bsg.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"bsg.ox.ac.uk"},{"date.published":"2003-08-26","date.changed":"2020-12-21","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marx/","author1":"Jonathan Wolff","author2":"David Leopold","author1.info":"http://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/people/jonathan-wolff","entry":"marx","body.text":"\n\n\nKarl Marx (1818–1883) is often treated as a revolutionary, an\nactivist rather than a philosopher, whose works inspired the\nfoundation of many communist regimes in the twentieth century. It is\ncertainly hard to find many thinkers who can be said to have had\ncomparable influence in the creation of the modern world. However,\nMarx was trained as a philosopher, and although often portrayed as\nmoving away from philosophy in his mid-twenties—perhaps towards\nhistory and the social sciences—there are many points of contact\nwith modern philosophical debates throughout his writings.\n\n\nThe themes picked out here include Marx’s philosophical\nanthropology, his theory of history, his economic analysis, his\ncritical engagement with contemporary capitalist society (raising\nissues about morality, ideology, and politics), and his prediction of\na communist future.\n\n\nMarx’s early writings are dominated by an understanding of\nalienation, a distinct type of social ill whose diagnosis looks to\nrest on a controversial account of human nature and its flourishing.\nHe subsequently developed an influential theory of history—often\ncalled historical materialism—centred around the idea that forms\nof society rise and fall as they further and then impede the\ndevelopment of human productive power. Marx increasingly became\npreoccupied with an attempt to understand the contemporary capitalist\nmode of production, as driven by a remorseless pursuit of profit,\nwhose origins are found in the extraction of surplus value from the\nexploited proletariat. The precise role of morality and moral\ncriticism in Marx’s critique of contemporary capitalist society\nis much discussed, and there is no settled scholarly consensus on\nthese issues. His understanding of morality may be related to his\naccount of ideology, and his reflection on the extent to which certain\nwidely-shared misunderstandings might help explain the stability of\nclass-divided societies. In the context of his radical journalism,\nMarx also developed his controversial account of the character and\nrole of the modern state, and more generally of the relation between\npolitical and economic life. Marx sees the historical process as\nproceeding through a series of modes of production, characterised by\n(more or less explicit) class struggle, and driving humankind towards\ncommunism. However, Marx is famously reluctant to say much about the\ndetailed arrangements of the communist alternative that he sought to\nbring into being, arguing that it would arise through historical\nprocesses, and was not the realisation of a pre-determined plan or\nblueprint.\n\nKarl Marx was born in 1818, one of nine children. The family lived in\nthe Rhineland region of Prussia, previously under French rule. Both of\nhis parents came from Jewish families with distinguished rabbinical\nlineages. Marx’s father was a lawyer who converted to\nChristianity when it became necessary for him to do so if he was to\ncontinue his legal career. \nFollowing an unexceptional school career, Marx studied law and\nphilosophy at the universities of Bonn and Berlin. His doctoral thesis\nwas in ancient philosophy, comparing the philosophies of nature of\nDemocritus (c.460–370 BCE) and Epicurus (341–270 BCE).\nFrom early 1842, he embarked on a career as a radical journalist,\ncontributing to, and then editing, the Rheinische Zeitung,\nuntil the paper was closed by the Prussian authorities in April\n1843. \nMarx married Jenny von Westphalen (1814–1881), his childhood\nsweetheart, in June 1843. They would spend their lives together and\nhave seven children, of whom just three daughters—Jenny\n(1844–1883), Laura (1845–1911), and Eleanor\n(1855–1898)—survived to adulthood. Marx is also widely\nthought to have fathered a child—Frederick Demuth\n(1851–1929)—with Helene Demuth (1820–1890),\nhousekeeper and friend of the Marx family. \nMarx’s adult life combined independent scholarship, political\nactivity, and financial insecurity, in fluctuating proportions.\nPolitical conditions were such, that, in order to associate and write\nas he wished, he had to live outside of Germany for most of this time.\nMarx spent three successive periods of exile in the capital cities of\nFrance, Belgium, and England. \nBetween late 1843 and early 1845, Marx lived in Paris, a cosmopolitan\ncity full of émigrés and radical artisans. He was\nsubsequently expelled by the French government following Prussian\npressure. In his last months in Germany and during this Paris exile,\nMarx produced a series of “early writings”, many not\nintended for publication, which significantly altered interpretations\nof his thought when they were published collectively in the twentieth\ncentury. Papers that actually saw publication during this period\ninclude: “On the Jewish Question” (1843) in which Marx\ndefends Jewish Emancipation against Bruno Bauer (1809–1882), but\nalso emphasises the limitations of “political” as against\n“human” emancipation; and the “Critique of\nHegel’s Philosophy of Right: Introduction” (1844) which\ncontains a critical account of religion, together with some prescient\nremarks about the emancipatory potential of the proletariat. The most\nsignificant works that Marx wrote for self-clarification rather than\npublication in his Paris years are the so-called “1844\nManuscripts” (1844) which provide a suggestive account of\nalienation, especially of alienation in work; and the “Theses on\nFeuerbach” (1845), a set of epigrammatic but rich remarks\nincluding reflections on the nature of philosophy. \nBetween early 1845 and early 1848, Marx lived in Brussels, the capital\nof a rapidly industrialising Belgium. A condition of his residency was\nto refrain from publishing on contemporary politics, and he was\neventually expelled after political demonstrations involving foreign\nnationals took place. In Brussels Marx published The Holy\nFamily (1845), which includes contributions from his new friend\nand close collaborator Friedrich Engels (1820–1895), continuing\nthe attack on Bruno Bauer and his followers. Marx also worked, with\nEngels, on a series of manuscripts now usually known as The German\nIdeology (1845–46), a substantial section of which\ncriticises the work of Max Stirner (1806–1856). Marx also wrote\nand published The Poverty of Philosophy (1847) which\ndisparages the social theory of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon\n(1809–1865). All these publications characteristically show Marx\ndeveloping and promoting his own views through fierce critical attacks\non contemporaries, often better-known and more established than\nhimself. \nMarx was politically active throughout his adult life, although the\nevents of 1848—during which time he returned to Paris and\nCologne—inspired the first of two periods of especially intense\nactivity. Two important texts here are The Communist\nManifesto (1848) which Marx and Engels published just before the\nFebruary Revolution, and, following his move to London, The Class\nStruggles in France (1850) in which Marx examined the subsequent\nfailure of 1848 in France. Between these two dates, Marx commented on,\nand intervened in, the revolution in Germany through the Neue\nRheinische Zeitung (1848–49), the paper he helped to\nestablish and edit in Cologne. \nFor well over half of his adult life—from late 1849 until his\ndeath in 1883—Marx lived in London, a city providing a secure\nhaven for political exiles and a superb vantage point from which to\nstudy the world’s most advanced capitalist economy. This third\nand longest exile was dominated by an intellectual and personal\nstruggle to complete his critique of political economy, but his\ntheoretical output extended far beyond that project. \nMarx’s initial attempt to make sense of Napoleon III’s\nrise to power in contemporary France is contained in The\nEighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852). Between 1852 and\n1862 Marx also wrote well over three hundred articles for the New\nYork Daily Tribune; sometimes unfairly disparaged as merely\nincome-generating journalism, they frequently contain illuminating\nattempts to explain contemporary European society and politics\n(including European interventions in India and China) to an American\naudience (helpfully) presumed to know little about them. \nThe second of Marx’s two especially intense periods of political\nactivity—after the revolutions of 1848—centred on his\ninvolvement in the International Working Men’s Association\nbetween 1864 and 1874, and the events of the Paris Commune (1871), in\nparticular. The character and lessons of the Commune—the\nshort-lived, and violently suppressed, municipal rebellion that\ncontrolled Paris for several months in the aftermath of the\nFranco-Prussian war—are discussed in The Civil War in\nFrance (1871). Also politically important was Marx’s\n“Critique of the Gotha Programme” (1875), in which he\ncriticises the theoretical influence of Ferdinand Lassalle\n(1825–1864) on the German labour movement, and portrays the\nhigher stage of a future communist society as endorsing distribution\naccording to “the needs principle”. \nMarx’s critique of political economy remains controversial. He\nnever succeeded in fixing and realising the wider project that he\nenvisaged. Volume One of Capital, published in 1867, was the\nonly significant part of the project published in his own lifetime,\nand even here he was unable to resist heavily reworking subsequent\neditions (especially the French version of 1872–75). What we now\nknow as Volume Two and Volume Three of Capital were put\ntogether from Marx’s raw materials by Engels and published in\n1885 and 1894, respectively, and Marx’s own drafts were written\nbefore the publication of Volume One and barely touched by him in the\nremaining fifteen years of his life. An additional three supplementary\nvolumes planned by Engels, and subsequently called Theories of\nSurplus Value (or, more colloquially, the “fourth volume of\nCapital”) were assembled from remaining notes by Karl\nKautsky (1854–1938), and published between 1905 and 1910. (The\nsection of the “new MEGA”—see below—concerned\nwith Capital-related texts contains fifteen thick volumes,\nand provides some sense of the extent and character of these later\neditorial interventions.) In addition, the publication in 1953—a\nprevious two-volume edition (1939 and 1941) had only a highly\nrestricted circulation—of the so-called Grundrisse\n(written in 1857–58) was also important. Whether this text is\ntreated as a freestanding work or as a preparatory step towards\nCapital, it raises many questions about Marx’s method,\nhis relation to G.W.F. Hegel (1770–1831), and the evolution of\nMarx’s thought. In contrast, the work of political economy that\nMarx did publish in this period—A Contribution to a Critique\nof Political Economy (1859)—was largely ignored by both\ncontemporaries and later commentators, except for the, much reprinted\nand discussed, summary sketch of his theory of history that Marx\noffered in the so-called “1859 Preface” to that\nvolume. \nMarx’s later years (after the Paris Commune) are the subject of\nmuch interpretative disagreement. His inability to deliver the later\nvolumes of Capital is often seen as emblematic of a wider and\nmore systematic intellectual failure (Stedman Jones 2016). However,\nothers have stressed Marx’s continued intellectual creativity in\nthis period, as he variously rethought his views about: the core and\nperiphery of the international economic system; the scope of his\ntheory of history; social anthropology; and the economic and political\nevolution of Russia (Shanin 1983; K. Anderson 2010). \nAfter the death of his wife, in 1881, Marx’s life was dominated\nby illness, and travel aimed at improving his health (convalescent\ndestinations including the Isle of Wight, Karlsbad, Jersey, and\nAlgiers). Marx died in March 1883, two months after the death of his\neldest daughter. His estate was valued at £250. \nEngels’s wider role in the evolution of, and, more especially\nthe reception and interpretation of, Marx’s work is much\ndisputed. The truth here is complex, and Engels is not always\nwell-treated in the literature. Marx and Engels are sometimes\nportrayed as if they were a single entity, of one mind on all matters,\nwhose individual views on any topic can be found simply by consulting\nthe other. Others present Engels as the distorter and manipulator of\nMarx’s thought, responsible for any element of Marxian theory\nwith which the relevant commentator might disagree. Despite their\nfamiliarity, neither caricature seems plausible or fair. The\nbest-known jointly authored texts are The Holy\nFamily, the “German Ideology” manuscripts, and\nThe Communist Manifesto, but there are nearly two hundred\nshorter items that they both contributed to (Draper 1985:\n2–19). \nMany of Marx’s best-known writings remained unpublished before\nhis death. The attempt to establish a reliable collected edition has\nproved lengthy and fraught. The authoritative\nMarx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe, the so-called “new\nMEGA” (1975–), is still a work in progress, begun\nunder Soviet auspices but since 1990 under the guidance of the\n“International Marx-Engels Stiftung” (IMES). In its\ncurrent form—much scaled-down from its original\nambitions—the edition will contain some 114 volumes (well over a\nhalf of which are published at the time of writing). In addition to\nhis various published and unpublished works, it includes Marx’s\njournalism, correspondence, drafts, and (some) notebooks. Texts are\npublished in their original language (variously German, English, and\nFrench). For those needing to utilise English-language resources, the\nfifty volume Marx Engels Collected Works (1975–2004)\ncan be recommended. (References to Marx and Engels quotations here are\nto these MECW volumes.) There are also several useful single\nvolume selections of Marx and Engels writings in English (including\nMarx 2000). \nAlienation is a concept especially, but not uniquely, associated with\nMarx’s work, and the intellectual tradition that he helped\nfound. It identifies a distinct kind of social ill, involving a\nseparation between a subject and an object that properly belong\ntogether. The subject here is typically an individual or a group,\nwhile the object is usually an “entity” which variously is\nnot itself a subject, is another subject(s), or is the original\nsubject (that is, the relation here can be reflexive). And the\nrelation between the relevant subject and object is one of problematic\nseparation. Both elements of that characterisation are important. Not\nall social ills, of course, involve separations; for instance, being\noverly integrated into some object might be dysfunctional, but it is\nnot characteristic of alienation. Moreover, not all separations are\nproblematic, and accounts of alienation typically appeal to some\nbaseline unity or harmony that is frustrated or violated by the\nseparation in question. \nTheories of alienation vary considerably, but frequently: first,\nidentify a subset of these problematic separations as being of\nparticular importance; second, include an account (sometimes implicit)\nof what makes the relevant separations problematic; and, third,\npropound some explanatory claims about the extent of, and prognosis\nfor, alienation, so understood. \nMarx’s ideas concerning alienation were greatly influenced by\nthe critical writings on religion of Ludwig Feuerbach\n(1804–1872), and especially his The Essence of\nChristianity (1841). One key text in this respect is Marx’s\n“Contribution of Hegel’s Critique of Right:\nIntroduction” (1843). This work is home to Marx’s\nnotorious remark that religion is the “opium of the\npeople,” a harmful, illusion-generating painkiller\n(MECW 3: 175). It is here that Marx sets out his account of\nreligion in most detail. \nWhile traditional Christian theology asserts that God created man in\nGod’s own image, Marx fully accepted Feuerbach’s inversion\nof this picture, proposing that human beings had invented God in their\nown image; indeed a view that long pre-dated Feuerbach.\nFeuerbach’s distinctive contribution was to argue that\nworshipping God diverted human beings from enjoying their own human\npowers. In their imagination humans raise their own powers to an\ninfinite level and project them on to an abstract object. Hence\nreligion is a form of alienation, for it separates human beings from\ntheir “species essence.” Marx accepted much of\nFeuerbach’s account but argues that Feuerbach failed to\nunderstand why people fall into religious alienation, and so is unable\nto explain how it can be transcended. Feuerbach’s view appears\nto be that belief in religion is purely an intellectual error and can\nbe corrected by persuasion. Marx’s explanation is that religion\nis a response to alienation in material life, and therefore cannot be\nremoved until human material life is emancipated, at which point\nreligion will wither away. \nPrecisely what it is about material life that creates religion is not\nset out with complete clarity. However, it seems that at least two\naspects of alienation are responsible. One is alienated labour, which\nwill be explored shortly. A second is the need for human beings to\nassert their communal essence. Whether or not we explicitly recognise\nit, human beings exist as a community, and what makes human life\npossible is our mutual dependence on the vast network of social and\neconomic relations which engulf us all, even though this is rarely\nacknowledged in our day-to-day life. Marx’s view appears to be\nthat we must, somehow or other, acknowledge our communal existence in\nour institutions. At first it is “deviously acknowledged”\nby religion, which creates a false idea of a community in which we are\nall equal in the eyes of God. After the post-Reformation fragmentation\nof religion, where religion is no longer able to play the role even of\na fake community of equals, the modern state fills this need by\noffering us the illusion of a community of citizens, all equal in the\neyes of the law. Interestingly, the political or liberal state, which\nis needed to manage the politics of religious diversity, takes on the\nrole offered by religion in earlier times of providing a form of\nillusory community. But the political state and religion will both be\ntranscended when a genuine community of social and economic equals is\ncreated. \nAlthough Marx was greatly inspired by thinking about religious\nalienation, much more of his attention was devoted to exploring\nalienation in work. In a much-discussed passage from the 1844\nManuscripts, Marx identifies four dimensions of alienated labour\nin contemporary capitalist society (MECW 3: 270–282).\nFirst, immediate producers are separated from the product of their\nlabour; they create a product that they neither own nor control,\nindeed, which comes to dominate them. (Note that this idea of\n“fetishism”—where human creations escape our\ncontrol, achieve the appearance of independence, and come to oppress\nus—is not to be equated with alienation as such, but is rather\none form that it can take.) Second, immediate producers are separated\nfrom their productive activity; in particular, they are forced to work\nin ways which are mentally and/or physically debilitating. Third,\nimmediate producers are separated from other individuals; contemporary\neconomic relations socialise individuals to view others as merely\nmeans to their own particular ends. Fourth, and finally, immediate\nproducers are separated from their own human nature; for instance, the\nhuman capacities for community and for free, conscious, and creative,\nwork, are both frustrated by contemporary capitalist relations. \nNote that these claims about alienation are distinct from other,\nperhaps more familiar, complaints about work in capitalist society.\nFor instance, alienated labour, as understood here, could\nbe—even if it is often not—highly remunerated, limited in\nduration, and relatively secure. \nMarx holds that work has the potential to be something creative and\nfulfilling. He consequently rejects the view of work as a necessary\nevil, denying that the negative character of work is part of our fate,\na universal fact about the human condition that no amount of social\nchange could remedy. Indeed, productive activity, on Marx’s\naccount, is a central element in what it is to be a human being, and\nself-realisation through work is a vital component of human\nflourishing. That he thinks that work—in a different form of\nsociety—could be creative and fulfilling, perhaps explains the\nintensity and scale of Marx’s condemnation of contemporary\neconomic arrangements and their transformation of workers into\ndeformed and “dehumanised” beings (MECW 3:\n284). \nIt was suggested above that alienation consists of dysfunctional\nseparations—separations between entities that properly belong\ntogether—and that theories of alienation typically presuppose\nsome baseline condition whose frustration or violation by the relevant\nseparation identifies the latter as dysfunctional. For Marx, that\nbaseline seems to be provided by an account of human flourishing,\nwhich he conceptualises in terms of self-realisation (understood here\nas the development and deployment of our essential human capacities).\nLabour in capitalism, we can say, is alienated because it embodies\nseparations preventing the self-realisation of producers; because it\nis organised in a way that frustrates the human need for free,\nconscious, and creative work. \nSo understood, and returning to the four separations said to\ncharacterise alienated labour, we can see that it is the implicit\nclaim about human nature (the fourth separation) which identifies the\nother three separations as dysfunctional. If one subscribed to the\nsame formal model of alienation and self-realisation, but held a\ndifferent account of the substance of human nature, very different\nclaims about work in capitalist society might result. Imagine a\ntheorist who held that human beings were solitary, egoistic creatures,\nby nature. That theorist could accept that work in capitalist society\nencouraged isolation and selfishness, but deny that such results were\nalienating, because those results would not frustrate their baseline\naccount of what it is to be a human being (indeed, they would rather\nfacilitate those characteristics). \nMarx seems to hold various views about the historical location and\ncomparative extent of alienation. These include: that some systematic\nforms of alienation—presumably including religious\nalienation—existed in pre-capitalist societies; that systematic\nforms of alienation—including alienation in work—are only\na feature of class divided societies; that systematic forms of\nalienation are greater in contemporary capitalist societies than in\npre-capitalist societies; and that not all human societies are scarred\nby class division, in particular, that a future classless society\n(communism) will not contain systematic forms of alienation. \nMarx maintains that alienation flows from capitalist social relations,\nand not from the kind of technological advances that capitalist\nsociety contains. His disapproval of capitalism is reserved for its\nsocial arrangements and not its material accomplishments. He had\nlittle time for what is sometimes called the “romantic critique\nof capitalism”, which sees industry and technology as the real\nvillains, responsible for devastating the purportedly communitarian\nidyll of pre-capitalist relations. In contrast, Marx celebrates the\nbourgeoisie’s destruction of feudal relations, and sees\ntechnological growth and human liberation as (at least, in time)\nprogressing hand-in-hand. Industry and technology are understood as\npart of the solution to, and not the source of, social problems. \nThere are many opportunities for scepticism here. In the present\ncontext, many struggle to see how the kind of large-scale industrial\nproduction that would presumably characterise communist\nsociety—communism purportedly being more productive than\ncapitalism—would avoid alienation in work. Interesting responses\nto such concerns have been put forward, but they have typically come\nfrom commentators rather than from Marx himself (Kandiyali 2018). This\nis a point at which Marx’s self-denying ordinance concerning the\ndetailed description of communist society prevents him from engaging\ndirectly with significant concerns about the direction of social\nchange. \nIn the text “On The Jewish Question” (1843) Marx begins to\nmake clear the distance between himself and his radical liberal\ncolleagues among the Young Hegelians; in particular Bruno Bauer. Bauer\nhad recently written against Jewish emancipation, from an atheist\nperspective, arguing that the religion of both Jews and Christians was\na barrier to emancipation. In responding to Bauer, Marx makes one of\nthe most enduring arguments from his early writings, by means of\nintroducing a distinction between political\nemancipation—essentially the grant of liberal rights and\nliberties—and human emancipation. Marx’s reply to Bauer is\nthat political emancipation is perfectly compatible with the continued\nexistence of religion, as the contemporary example of the United\nStates demonstrates. However, pushing matters deeper, in an argument\nreinvented by innumerable critics of liberalism, Marx argues that not\nonly is political emancipation insufficient to bring about human\nemancipation, it is in some sense also a barrier. Liberal rights and\nideas of justice are premised on the idea that each of us needs\nprotection from other human beings who are a threat to our liberty and\nsecurity. Therefore, liberal rights are rights of separation, designed\nto protect us from such perceived threats. Freedom on such a view, is\nfreedom from interference. What this view overlooks is the\npossibility—for Marx, the fact—that real freedom is to be\nfound positively in our relations with other people. It is to be found\nin human community, not in isolation. Accordingly, insisting on a\nregime of liberal rights encourages us to view each other in ways that\nundermine the possibility of the real freedom we may find in human\nemancipation. Now we should be clear that Marx does not oppose\npolitical emancipation, for he sees that liberalism is a great\nimprovement on the systems of feudalism and religious prejudice and\ndiscrimination which existed in the Germany of his day. Nevertheless,\nsuch politically emancipated liberalism must be transcended on the\nroute to genuine human emancipation. Unfortunately, Marx never tells\nus what human emancipation is, although it is clear that it is closely\nrelated to the ideas of non-alienated labour and meaningful\ncommunity. \nEven with these elaborations, many additional questions remain about\nMarx’s account. Three concerns are briefly addressed here. \nFirst, one might worry about the place of alienation in the evolution\nof Marx’s thought. The once-popular suggestion that Marx only\nwrote about alienation in his early writings—his published and\nunpublished works from the early 1840s—is not sustained by the\ntextual evidence. However, the theoretical role that the concept of\nalienation plays in his writings might still be said to evolve. For\nexample, it has been suggested that alienation in the early writings\nis intended to play an “explanatory role”, whereas in his\nlater work it comes to have a more “descriptive or\ndiagnostic” function (Wood 1981 [2004: 7]). \nA second concern is the role of human nature in the interpretation of\nalienation offered here. In one exegetical variant of this worry, the\nsuggestion is that this account of alienation rests on a model of\nuniversal human nature which Marx’s (later) understanding of\nhistorical specificity and change prevents him from endorsing.\nHowever, there is much evidence against this purported later rejection\nof human nature (see Geras 1983). Indeed, the “mature”\nMarx explicitly affirms that human nature has both constant and\nmutable elements; that human beings are characterised by universal\nqualities, constant across history and culture, and variable\nqualities, reflecting historical and cultural diversity (McMurtry\n1978: 19–53). One systematic, rather than exegetical, variant of\nthe present worry suggests that we should not endorse accounts of\nalienation which depend on “thick” and inevitably\ncontroversial accounts of human nature (Jaeggi 2016). Whatever view we\ntake of that claim about our endorsement, there seems little doubt\nabout the “thickness” of Marx’s own account of human\nflourishing. To provide for the latter, a society must satisfy not\nonly basic needs (for sustenance, warmth and shelter, certain climatic\nconditions, physical exercise, basic hygiene, procreation and sexual\nactivity), but also less basic needs, both those that are not always\nappreciated to be part of his account (for recreation, culture,\nintellectual stimulation, artistic expression, emotional satisfaction,\nand aesthetic pleasure), and those that Marx is more often associated\nwith (for fulfilling work and meaningful community) (Leopold 2007:\n227–245). \nThird, we may ask about Marx’s attitude towards the distinction\nsometimes made between subjective and objective alienation. These two\nforms of alienation can be exemplified separately or conjointly in the\nlives of particular individuals or societies (Hardimon 1994:\n119–122). Alienation is “subjective” when it is\ncharacterised in terms of the presence (or absence) of certain beliefs\nor feelings; for example, when individuals are said to be alienated\nbecause they feel estranged from the world. Alienation is\n“objective” when it is characterised in terms which make\nno reference to the beliefs or feelings of individuals; for example,\nwhen individuals are said to be alienated because they fail to develop\nand deploy their essential human characteristics, whether or not they\nexperience that lack of self-realisation as a loss. Marx seems to\nallow that these two forms of alienation are conceptually distinct,\nbut assumes that in capitalist societies they are typically found\ntogether. Indeed, he often appears to think of subjective alienation\nas tracking the objective variant. That said, Marx does allow that\nthey can come apart sociologically. At least, that is one way of\nreading a passage in The Holy Family where he recognises that\ncapitalists do not get to engage in self-realising activities of the\nright kind (and hence are objectively alienated), but\nthat—unlike the proletariat—they are content in\ntheir estrangement (and hence are lacking subjective alienation),\nfeeling “at ease” in, and even “strengthened”\nby, it (MECW 4: 36). \nMarx did not set out his theory of history in great detail.\nAccordingly, it has to be constructed from a variety of texts, both\nthose where he attempts to apply a theoretical analysis to past and\nfuture historical events, and those of a more purely theoretical\nnature. Of the latter, the “1859 Preface” to A\nCritique of Political Economy has achieved canonical status.\nHowever, the manuscripts collected together as The German\nIdeology, co-written with Engels in 1845-46, are also a much used\nearly source. We shall briefly outline both texts, and then look at\nthe reconstruction of Marx’s theory of history in the hands of\nhis philosophically most influential recent exponent, G.A. Cohen\n(Cohen 1978 [2001], 1988), who builds on the interpretation of the\nearly Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov (1856–1918)\n(Plekhanov 1895 [1947]). \nWe should, however, be aware that Cohen’s interpretation is far\nfrom universally accepted. Cohen provided his reconstruction of Marx\npartly because he was frustrated with existing Hegelian-inspired\n“dialectical” interpretations of Marx, and what he\nconsidered to be the vagueness of the influential works of Louis\nAlthusser (1918–1990), neither of which, he felt, provided a\nrigorous account of Marx’s views. However, some scholars believe\nthat the interpretation that we shall focus on is faulty precisely for\nits insistence on a mechanical model and its lack of attention to the\ndialectic. One aspect of this criticism is that Cohen’s\nunderstanding has a surprisingly small role for the concept of class\nstruggle, which is often felt to be central to Marx’s theory of\nhistory. Cohen’s explanation for this is that the “1859\nPreface”, on which his interpretation is based, does not give a\nprominent role to class struggle, and indeed it is not explicitly\nmentioned. Yet this reasoning is problematic for it is possible that\nMarx did not want to write in a manner that would engage the concerns\nof the police censor, and, indeed, a reader aware of the context may\nbe able to detect an implicit reference to class struggle through the\ninclusion of such phrases as “then begins an era of social\nrevolution,” and “the ideological forms in which men\nbecome conscious of this conflict and fight it out”. Hence it\ndoes not follow that Marx himself thought that the concept of class\nstruggle was relatively unimportant. Furthermore, when A Critique\nof Political Economy was replaced by Capital, Marx made\nno attempt to keep the 1859 Preface in print, and its content\nis reproduced just as a very much abridged footnote in\nCapital. Nevertheless, we shall concentrate here on\nCohen’s interpretation as no other account has been set out with\ncomparable rigour, precision and detail. \nIn his “Theses on Feuerbach” (1845) Marx provides\na background to what would become his theory of history by stating his\nobjections to “all hitherto existing” materialism and\nidealism, understood as types of philosophical theories. Materialism\nis complimented for understanding the physical reality of the world,\nbut is criticised for ignoring the active role of the human subject in\ncreating the world we perceive. Idealism, at least as developed by\nHegel, understands the active nature of the human subject, but\nconfines it to thought or contemplation: the world is created through\nthe categories we impose upon it. Marx combines the insights of both\ntraditions to propose a view in which human beings do indeed create\n—or at least transform—the world they find themselves in,\nbut this transformation happens not in thought but through actual\nmaterial activity; not through the imposition of sublime concepts but\nthrough the sweat of their brow, with picks and shovels. This\nhistorical version of materialism, which, according to Marx,\ntranscends and thus rejects all existing philosophical thought, is the\nfoundation of Marx’s later theory of history. As Marx puts it in\nthe “1844 Manuscripts”, “Industry is the actual\nhistorical relationship of nature … to man”\n(MECW 3: 303). This thought, derived from reflection on the\nhistory of philosophy, together with his experience of social and\neconomic realities, as a journalist, sets the agenda for all\nMarx’s future work. \nIn The German Ideology manuscripts, Marx and Engels contrast\ntheir new materialist method with the idealism that had characterised\nprevious German thought. Accordingly, they take pains to set out the\n“premises of the materialist method”. They start, they\nsay, from “real human beings”, emphasising that human\nbeings are essentially productive, in that they must produce their\nmeans of subsistence in order to satisfy their material needs. The\nsatisfaction of needs engenders new needs of both a material and\nsocial kind, and forms of society arise corresponding to the state of\ndevelopment of human productive forces. Material life determines, or\nat least “conditions” social life, and so the primary\ndirection of social explanation is from material production to social\nforms, and thence to forms of consciousness. As the material means of\nproduction develop, “modes of co-operation” or economic\nstructures rise and fall, and eventually communism will become a real\npossibility once the plight of the workers and their awareness of an\nalternative motivates them sufficiently to become revolutionaries. \nIn the sketch of The German Ideology, many of the key\nelements of historical materialism are present, even if the\nterminology is not yet that of Marx’s more mature writings.\nMarx’s statement in the “1859 Preface” renders\nsomething of the same view in sharper form. Cohen’s\nreconstruction of Marx’s view in the Preface begins from what\nCohen calls the Development Thesis, which is pre-supposed, rather than\nexplicitly stated in the Preface (Cohen 1978 [2001]: 134–174).\nThis is the thesis that the productive forces tend to develop, in the\nsense of becoming more powerful, over time. The productive forces are\nthe means of production, together with productively applicable\nknowledge: technology, in other words. The development thesis states\nnot that the productive forces always do develop, but that there is a\ntendency for them to do so. The next thesis is the primacy thesis,\nwhich has two aspects. The first states that the nature of a\nsociety’s economic structure is explained by the level of\ndevelopment of its productive forces, and the second that the nature\nof the superstructure—the political and legal institutions of\nsociety—is explained by the nature of the economic structure.\nThe nature of a society’s ideology, which is to say certain\nreligious, artistic, moral and philosophical beliefs contained within\nsociety, is also explained in terms of its economic structure,\nalthough this receives less emphasis in Cohen’s interpretation.\nIndeed, many activities may well combine aspects of both the\nsuperstructure and ideology: a religion is constituted by both\ninstitutions and a set of beliefs. \nRevolution and epoch change is understood as the consequence of an\neconomic structure no longer being able to continue to develop the\nforces of production. At this point the development of the productive\nforces is said to be fettered, and, according to the theory, once an\neconomic structure fetters development it will be\nrevolutionised—“burst asunder” (MECW 6:\n489)—and eventually replaced with an economic structure better\nsuited to preside over the continued development of the forces of\nproduction. \nIn outline, then, the theory has a pleasing simplicity and power. It\nseems plausible that human productive power develops over time, and\nplausible too that economic structures exist for as long as they\ndevelop the productive forces, but will be replaced when they are no\nlonger capable of doing this. Yet severe problems emerge when we\nattempt to put more flesh on these bones. \nPrior to Cohen’s work, historical materialism had not been\nregarded as a coherent view within English-language political\nphilosophy. The antipathy is well summed up with the closing words of\nH.B. Acton’s The Illusion of the Epoch: “Marxism\nis a philosophical farrago” (1955: 271). One difficulty taken\nparticularly seriously by Cohen is an alleged inconsistency between\nthe explanatory primacy of the forces of production, and certain\nclaims made elsewhere by Marx which appear to give the economic\nstructure primacy in explaining the development of the productive\nforces. For example, in The Communist Manifesto Marx and\nEngels state that: “The bourgeoisie cannot exist without\nconstantly revolutionising the instruments of production”\n(MECW 6: 487). This appears to give causal and explanatory\nprimacy to the economic structure—capitalism—which brings\nabout the development of the forces of production. Cohen accepts that,\non the surface at least, this generates a contradiction. Both the\neconomic structure and the development of the productive forces seem\nto have explanatory priority over each other. Unsatisfied by such\nvague resolutions as “determination in the last instance”,\nor the idea of “dialectical” connections, Cohen\nself-consciously attempts to apply the standards of clarity and rigour\nof analytic philosophy to provide a reconstructed version of\nhistorical materialism. \nThe key theoretical innovation is to appeal to the notion of\nfunctional explanation, also sometimes called “consequence\nexplanation” (Cohen 1978 [2001]: 249–296). The\nessential move is cheerfully to admit that the economic structure,\nsuch as capitalism, does indeed develop the productive forces, but to\nadd that this, according to the theory, is precisely why we have\ncapitalism (when we do). That is, if capitalism failed to develop the\nproductive forces it would disappear. And, indeed, this fits\nbeautifully with historical materialism. For Marx asserts that when an\neconomic structure fails to develop the productive forces—when\nit “fetters” the productive forces—it will be\nrevolutionised and the epoch will change. So the idea of\n“fettering” becomes the counterpart to the theory of\nfunctional explanation. Essentially fettering is what happens when the\neconomic structure becomes dysfunctional. \nNow it is apparent that this renders historical materialism\nconsistent. Yet there is a question as to whether it is at too high a\nprice. For we must ask whether functional explanation is a coherent\nmethodological device. The problem is that we can ask what it is that\nmakes it the case that an economic structure will only persist for as\nlong as it develops the productive forces. Jon Elster has pressed this\ncriticism against Cohen very hard (Elster 1985: 27–35). If we were\nto argue that there is an agent guiding history who has the purpose\nthat the productive forces should be developed as much as possible\nthen it would make sense that such an agent would intervene in history\nto carry out this purpose by selecting the economic structures which\ndo the best job. However, it is clear that Marx makes no such\nmetaphysical assumptions. Elster is very critical—sometimes of\nMarx, sometimes of Cohen—of the idea of appealing to\n“purposes” in history without those being the purposes of\nanyone. \nIndeed Elster’s criticism was anticipated in fascinating terms\nby Simone Weil (1909–1943), who links Marx’s appeal to\nhistory’s purposes to the influence of Hegel on his thought: \nWe must remember the Hegelian origins of Marxist thought. Hegel\nbelieved in a hidden mind at work in the universe, and that the\nhistory of the world is simply the history of this world mind, which,\nas in the case of everything spiritual, tends indefinitely towards\nperfection. Marx claimed to “put back on its feet” the\nHegelian dialectic, which he accused of being “upside\ndown”, by substituting matter for mind as the motive power of\nhistory; but by an extraordinary paradox, he conceived history,\nstarting from this rectification, as though he attributed to matter\nwhat is the very essence of mind—an unceasing aspiration towards\nthe best. (Weil 1955 [1958: 43]) \nCohen is well aware of the difficulty of appealing to purposes in\nhistory, but defends the use of functional explanation by comparing\nits use in historical materialism with its use in evolutionary\nbiology. In contemporary biology it is commonplace to explain the\nexistence of the stripes of a tiger, or the hollow bones of a bird, by\npointing to the function of these features. Here we have apparent\npurposes which are not the purposes of anyone. The obvious counter,\nhowever, is that in evolutionary biology we can provide a causal story\nto underpin these functional explanations; a story involving chance\nvariation and survival of the fittest. Therefore these functional\nexplanations are sustained by a complex causal feedback loop in which\ndysfunctional elements tend to be filtered out in competition with\nbetter functioning elements. Cohen calls such background accounts\n“elaborations” and he concedes that functional\nexplanations are in need of elaborations. But he points out that\nstandard causal explanations are equally in need of elaborations. We\nmight, for example, be satisfied with the explanation that the vase\nbroke because it was dropped on the floor, but a great deal of further\ninformation is needed to explain why this explanation works. \nConsequently, Cohen claims that we can be justified in offering a\nfunctional explanation even when we are in ignorance of its\nelaboration. Indeed, even in biology detailed causal elaborations of\nfunctional explanations have been available only relatively recently.\nPrior to Charles Darwin (1809–1882), or arguably Jean-Baptiste\nLamarck (1744–1829), the only candidate causal elaboration was\nto appeal to God’s purposes. Darwin outlined a very plausible\nmechanism, but having no genetic theory was not able to elaborate it\ninto a detailed account. Our knowledge remains incomplete in some\nrespects to this day. Nevertheless, it seems perfectly reasonable to\nsay that birds have hollow bones in order to facilitate flight.\nCohen’s point is that the weight of evidence that organisms are\nadapted to their environment would permit even a pre-Darwinian atheist\nto assert this functional explanation with justification. Hence one\ncan be justified in offering a functional explanation even in the\nabsence of a candidate elaboration: if there is sufficient weight of\ninductive evidence. \nAt this point the issue, then, divides into a theoretical question and\nan empirical one. The empirical question is whether or not there is\nevidence that forms of society exist only for as long as they advance\nproductive power, and are replaced by revolution when they fail. Here,\none must admit, the empirical record is patchy at best, and there\nappear to have been long periods of stagnation, even regression, when\ndysfunctional economic structures were not revolutionised. \nThe theoretical issue is whether a plausible elaborating explanation\nis available to underpin Marxist functional explanations. Here there\nis something of a dilemma. In the first instance it is tempting to try\nto mimic the elaboration given in the Darwinian story, and appeal to\nchance variations and survival of the fittest. In this case\n“fittest” would mean “most able to preside over the\ndevelopment of the productive forces”. Chance variation would be\na matter of people trying out new types of economic relations. On this\naccount new economic structures begin through experiment, but thrive\nand persist through their success in developing the productive forces.\nHowever the problem is that such an account would seem to introduce a\nlarger element of contingency than Marx seeks, for it is essential to\nMarx’s thought that one should be able to predict the eventual\narrival of communism. Within Darwinian theory there is no warrant for\nlong-term predictions, for everything depends on the contingencies of\nparticular situations. A similar heavy element of contingency would be\ninherited by a form of historical materialism developed by analogy\nwith evolutionary biology. The dilemma, then, is that the best model\nfor developing the theory makes predictions based on the theory\nunsound, yet the whole point of the theory is predictive. Hence one\nmust either look for an alternative means of producing elaborating\nexplanation, or give up the predictive ambitions of the theory. \nThe driving force of history, in Cohen’s reconstruction of Marx,\nis the development of the productive forces, the most important of\nwhich is technology. But what is it that drives such development?\nUltimately, in Cohen’s account, it is human rationality. Human\nbeings have the ingenuity to apply themselves to develop means to\naddress the scarcity they find. This on the face of it seems very\nreasonable. Yet there are difficulties. As Cohen himself acknowledges,\nsocieties do not always do what would be rational for an individual to\ndo. Co-ordination problems may stand in our way, and there may be\nstructural barriers. Furthermore, it is relatively rare for those who\nintroduce new technologies to be motivated by the need to address\nscarcity. Rather, under capitalism, the profit motive is the key. Of\ncourse it might be argued that this is the social form that the\nmaterial need to address scarcity takes under capitalism. But still\none may raise the question whether the need to address scarcity always\nhas the influence that it appears to have taken on in modern times.\nFor example, a ruling class’s absolute determination to hold on\nto power may have led to economically stagnant societies.\nAlternatively, it might be thought that a society may put religion or\nthe protection of traditional ways of life ahead of economic needs.\nThis goes to the heart of Marx’s theory that man is an\nessentially productive being and that the locus of interaction with\nthe world is industry. As Cohen himself later argued in essays such as\n“Reconsidering Historical Materialism” (1988), the\nemphasis on production may appear one-sided, and ignore other powerful\nelements in human nature. Such a criticism chimes with a criticism\nfrom the previous section; that the historical record may not, in\nfact, display the tendency to growth in the productive forces assumed\nby the theory. \nMany defenders of Marx will argue that the problems stated are\nproblems for Cohen’s interpretation of Marx, rather than for\nMarx himself. It is possible to argue, for example, that Marx did not\nhave a general theory of history, but rather was a social scientist\nobserving and encouraging the transformation of capitalism into\ncommunism as a singular event. And it is certainly true that when Marx\nanalyses a particular historical episode, as he does in the 18th\nBrumaire of Louis Napoleon (1852), any idea of fitting events\ninto a fixed pattern of history seems very far from Marx’s mind.\nOn other views Marx did have a general theory of history but it is far\nmore flexible and less determinate than Cohen insists (Miller 1984).\nAnd finally, as noted, there are critics who believe that\nCohen’s interpretation is entirely wrong-headed owing to its\ndismissive attitude to dialectical reasoning (Sayers 1984 [1990]). \nHow to read Marx’s economic writings, and especially his\nmasterpiece Capital Volume 1,  remains a matter of\ncontroversy. An orthodox reading is that Marx’s essential task\nis to contribute to economic theory, based on a modified form of the\nlabour theory of value. Others warn against such a narrow\ninterpretation, pointing out that the character of Marx’s\nwriting and presentation is very far from what one would expect in a\nstandard economic text. Hence William Clare Roberts (2017), for\nexample, argues that Capital Volume 1 is fundamentally a work\nof political theory, rather than economics. Be that as it may,\nnevertheless, the work does contain substantial presentation of an\neconomic analysis of capitalism, and it is on this that we will focus\nhere. \nCapital Volume 1 begins with an analysis of the idea of\ncommodity production. A commodity is defined as a useful external\nobject, produced for exchange on a market. Thus, two necessary\nconditions for commodity production are: the existence of a market, in\nwhich exchange can take place; and a social division of labour, in\nwhich different people produce different products, without which there\nwould be no motivation for exchange. Marx suggests that commodities\nhave both use-value—a use, in other words—and an\nexchange-value—initially to be understood as their price. Use\nvalue can easily be understood, so Marx says, but he insists that\nexchange value is a puzzling phenomenon, and relative exchange values\nneed to be explained. Why does a quantity of one commodity exchange\nfor a given quantity of another commodity? His explanation is in terms\nof the labour input required to produce the commodity, or rather, the\nsocially necessary labour, which is labour exerted at the average\nlevel of intensity and productivity for that branch of activity within\nthe economy. Thus the labour theory of value asserts that the value of\na commodity is determined by the quantity of socially necessary labour\ntime required to produce it. \nMarx provides a two-stage argument for the labour theory of value. The\nfirst stage is to argue that if two objects can be compared in the\nsense of being put on either side of an equals sign, then there must\nbe a “third thing of identical magnitude in both of them”\nto which they are both reducible. As commodities can be exchanged\nagainst each other, there must, Marx argues, be a third thing that\nthey have in common. This then motivates the second stage, which is a\nsearch for the appropriate “third thing”, which is labour\nin Marx’s view, as the only plausible common element. Both steps\nof the argument are, of course, highly contestable. \nCapitalism can be distinguished from other forms of commodity\nexchange, Marx argues, in that it involves not merely the exchange of\ncommodities, but the advancement of capital, in the form of money,\nwith the purpose of generating profit through the purchase of\ncommodities and their transformation into other commodities which can\ncommand a higher price, and thus yield a profit. Marx claims that no\nprevious theorist has been able adequately to explain how capitalism\nas a whole can make a profit. Marx’s own solution relies on the\nidea of exploitation of the worker. In setting up conditions of\nproduction the capitalist purchases the worker’s labour\npower—his or her ability to labour—for the day. The cost\nof this commodity is determined in the same way as the cost of every\nother; that is, in terms of the amount of socially necessary labour\npower required to produce it. In this case the value of a day’s\nlabour power is the value of the commodities necessary to keep the\nworker alive for a day. Suppose that such commodities take four hours\nto produce. Accordingly the first four hours of the working day is\nspent on producing value equivalent to the value of the wages the\nworker will be paid. This is known as necessary labour. Any work the\nworker does above this is known as surplus labour, producing surplus\nvalue for the capitalist. Surplus value, according to Marx, is the\nsource of all profit. In Marx’s analysis labour power is the\nonly commodity which can produce more value than it is worth, and for\nthis reason it is known as variable capital. Other commodities simply\npass their value on to the finished commodities, but do not create any\nextra value. They are known as constant capital. Profit, then, is the\nresult of the labour performed by the worker beyond that necessary to\ncreate the value of his or her wages. This is the surplus value theory\nof profit. \nIt appears to follow from this analysis that as industry becomes more\nmechanised, using more constant capital and less variable capital, the\nrate of profit ought to fall. For as a proportion less capital will be\nadvanced on labour, and only labour can create value. In\nCapital Volume 3 Marx does indeed make the prediction that\nthe rate of profit will fall over time, and this is one of the factors\nwhich leads to the downfall of capitalism. (However, as pointed out by\nPaul Sweezy in The Theory of Capitalist Development (1942),\nthe analysis is problematic.) A further consequence of this analysis\nis a difficulty for the theory that Marx did recognise, and tried,\nalbeit unsuccessfully, to meet also in the manuscripts that make up\nCapital Volume 3. It follows from the analysis so far that\nlabour-intensive industries ought to have a higher rate of profit than\nthose which use less labour. Not only is this empirically false, it is\ntheoretically unacceptable. Accordingly, Marx argued that in real\neconomic life prices vary in a systematic way from values. Providing\nthe mathematics to explain this is known as the transformation\nproblem, and Marx’s own attempt suffers from technical\ndifficulties. Although there are sophisticated known techniques for\nsolving this problem now there is a question about the degree to which\nthey do rescue Marx’s project. If it is thought that the labour\ntheory of value was initially motivated as an intuitively plausible\ntheory of price then when the connection between price and value is\nrendered as indirect as it is in the final theory, the intuitive\nmotivation of the theory drains away. Others consider this to be a\nsuperficial reading of Marx, and that his general approach allows us\nto see through the appearances of capitalism to understand its\nunderlying basis, which need not coincide with appearances. How\nMarx’s theory of capitalism should be read remains an active\narea of scholarly debate (Heinrich 2012). \nA further objection is that Marx’s assertion that only labour\ncan create surplus value is unsupported by any argument or analysis,\nand can be argued to be merely an artefact of the nature of his\npresentation. Any commodity can be picked to play a similar role.\nConsequently, with equal justification one could set out a corn theory\nof value, arguing that corn has the unique power of creating more\nvalue than it costs. Formally this would be identical to the labour\ntheory of value (Roemer 1982). Nevertheless, the claims that somehow\nlabour is responsible for the creation of value, and that profit is\nthe consequence of exploitation, remain intuitively powerful, even if\nthey are difficult to establish in detail. \nHowever, even if the labour theory of value is considered discredited,\nthere are elements of his theory that remain of worth. The Cambridge\neconomist Joan Robinson, in An Essay on Marxian Economics\n(1942), picked out two aspects of particular note. First, Marx’s\nrefusal to accept that capitalism involves a harmony of interests\nbetween worker and capitalist, replacing this with a class-based\nanalysis of the worker’s struggle for better wages and\nconditions of work, versus the capitalist’s drive for ever\ngreater profits. Second, Marx’s denial that there is any\nlong-run tendency to equilibrium in the market, and his descriptions\nof mechanisms which underlie the trade-cycle of boom and bust. Both\nprovide a salutary corrective to aspects of orthodox economic\ntheory. \nAs noted, traditionally Marx’s definition of exploitation is\ngiven in terms of the theory of surplus value, which in turn is taken\nto depend on the labour theory of value: the theory that the value of\nany commodity is proportional to the amount of “socially\nnecessary” labour embodied in it. However, the question arises\nof whether the basic idea of exploitation should be so dependent on a\nparticular theory of value. For if it is, the notion of exploitation\nbecomes vulnerable to Robert Nozick’s objection: that if the\nlabour theory of value can be shown to be faulty, the Marxist theory\nof exploitation collapses too (Nozick 1974). \nOthers have felt that it is possible to restore the intuitive core of\na Marxist theory of exploitation independent of the labour theory of\nvalue (cf. Cohen 1979, Wolff 1999, Vrousalis 2013). John Roemer, to\ntake one leading case, states: \nMarxian exploitation is defined as the unequal exchange of labor for\ngoods: the exchange is unequal when the amount of labor embodied in\nthe goods which the worker can purchase with his income … is\nless than the amount of labor he expended to earn that income.(Roemer\n1985: 30) \nSuppose I work eight hours to earn my wages. With this perhaps the\nbest thing I can buy is a coat. But imagine that the coat took only a\ntotal of four hours to make. Therefore I have exchanged my eight hours\nwork for only four hours of other people’s work, and thereby, on\nthis view, I am exploited. \nThe definition requires some refinement. For example, if I am taxed\nfor the benefit of those unable to work, I will be exploited by the\nabove definition, but this is not what the definition of exploitation\nwas intended to capture. Worse still, if there is one person exploited\nmuch more gravely than anyone else in the economy, then it may turn\nout that no-one else is exploited. Nevertheless, it should not be\ndifficult to adjust the definition to take account of these\ndifficulties, and as noted several other accounts of Marx-inspired\naccounts of exploitation have been offered that are independent of the\nlabour theory of value. \nMany of these alternative definitions add a notion of unfreedom or\ndomination to unequal exchange of labour and goods (Vrousalis 2013).\nThe exploited person is forced to accept a situation in which he or\nshe just never gets back what they put into the labour process. Now\nthere may be, in particular cases, a great deal to be said about why\nthis is perfectly acceptable from a moral point of view. However, on\nthe face of it such exploitation appears to be unjust. Nevertheless,\nwe will see in the next section why attributing such a position to\nMarx himself is fraught with difficulty. \nThe issue of Marx and morality poses a conundrum. On reading\nMarx’s works at all periods of his life, there appears to be the\nstrongest possible distaste towards bourgeois capitalist society, and\nan undoubted endorsement of future communist society. Yet the terms of\nthis antipathy and endorsement are far from clear. Despite\nexpectations, Marx never directly says that capitalism is unjust.\nNeither does he directly say that communism would be a just form of\nsociety. In fact he frequently takes pains to distance himself from\nthose who engage in a discourse of justice, and makes a conscious\nattempt to exclude direct moral commentary in his own works. The\npuzzle is why this should be, given the weight of indirect moral\ncommentary one also finds in his writings. \nThere are, initially, separate questions concerning Marx’s\nattitude to capitalism and to communism. There are also separate\nquestions concerning his attitude to ideas of justice, and to ideas of\nmorality more broadly concerned. This, then, generates four questions:\n(a) Did Marx think capitalism unjust?; (b) did he think that\ncapitalism could be morally criticised on other grounds?; (c) did he\nthink that communism would be just? (d) did he think it could be\nmorally approved of on other grounds? These are some of the questions\nwe consider in this section. \nThe initial argument that Marx must have thought that capitalism is\nunjust is based on the observation that Marx argued that all\ncapitalist profit is ultimately derived from the exploitation of the\nworker. Capitalism’s dirty secret is that it is not a realm of\nharmony and mutual benefit but a system in which one class\nsystematically extracts profit from another. How could this fail to be\nunjust? Yet it is notable that Marx never explicitly draws such a\nconclusion, and in Capital he goes as far as to say that such\nexchange is “by no means an injury to the seller” (MECW\n35: 204), which some commentators have taken as evidence that Marx did\nnot think that capitalism was unjust, although other readings are\npossible. \nAllen Wood (1972) is perhaps the leading advocate of the view that\nMarx did not believe that capitalism is unjust. Wood argues that Marx\ntakes this approach because his general theoretical approach excludes\nany trans-epochal standpoint from which one can comment on the justice\nof an economic system. Even though it is acceptable to criticise\nparticular behaviour from within an economic structure as unjust (and\ntheft under capitalism would be an example) it is not possible to\ncriticise capitalism as a whole. This is a consequence of Marx’s\nanalysis of the role of ideas of justice from within historical\nmaterialism. Marx claims that juridical institutions are part of the\nsuperstructure, and that ideas of justice are\nideological. Accordingly, the role of both the superstructure and\nideology, in the functionalist reading of historical materialism\nadopted here, is to stabilise the economic structure. Consequently, to\nstate that something is just under capitalism is simply a judgement\nthat it will tend to have the effect of advancing capitalism.\nAccording to Marx, in any society the ruling ideas are those of the\nruling class; the core of the theory of ideology. \nZiyad Husami (1978) however, argues that Wood is mistaken,\nignoring the fact that for Marx ideas undergo a double determination.\nWe need to differentiate not just by economic system, but also by\neconomic class within the system. Therefore the ideas of the\nnon-ruling class may be very different from those of the ruling class.\nOf course, it is the ideas of the ruling class that receive attention\nand implementation, but this does not mean that other ideas do not\nexist. Husami goes as far as to argue that members of the proletariat\nunder capitalism have an account of justice that matches communism.\nFrom this privileged standpoint of the proletariat, which is also\nMarx’s standpoint, capitalism is unjust, and so it follows that\nMarx thought capitalism unjust. \nPlausible though it may sound, Husami’s argument fails to\naccount for two related points. First, it cannot explain why Marx\nnever explicitly described capitalism as unjust, and second, it\noverlooks the distance Marx wanted to place between his own scientific\nsocialism, and that of other socialists who argued for the injustice\nof capitalism. Hence one cannot avoid the conclusion that the\n“official” view of Marx is that capitalism is not\nunjust. \nNevertheless, this leaves us with a puzzle. Much of Marx’s\ndescription of capitalism—his use of the words\n“embezzlement”, “robbery” and\n“exploitation”—belie the official account. Arguably,\nthe only satisfactory way of understanding this issue is, once more,\nfrom G.A. Cohen, who proposes that Marx believed that capitalism was\nunjust, but did not believe that he believed it was unjust (Cohen\n1983). In other words, Marx, like so many of us, did not have perfect\nknowledge of his own mind. In his explicit reflections on the justice\nof capitalism he was able to maintain his official view. But in less\nguarded moments his real view slips out, even if never in explicit\nlanguage. Such an interpretation is bound to be controversial, but it\nmakes good sense of the texts. \nWhatever one concludes on the question of whether Marx thought\ncapitalism unjust, it is, nevertheless, obvious that Marx thought that\ncapitalism was not the best way for human beings to live. Points made\nin his early writings remain present throughout his writings, if no\nlonger connected to an explicit theory of alienation. The worker finds\nwork a torment, suffers poverty, overwork and lack of fulfilment and\nfreedom. People do not relate to each other as humans should. Does\nthis amount to a moral criticism of capitalism or not? In the absence\nof any special reason to argue otherwise, it simply seems obvious that\nMarx’s critique is a moral one. Capitalism impedes human\nflourishing. It is hard to disagree with the judgement that Marx \nthinks that the capitalist exploitation of labor power is a wrong that\nhas horrendous consequences for the laborers. (Roberts 2017: 129) \nMarx, though, once more refrained from making this explicit; he seemed\nto show no interest in locating his criticism of capitalism in any of\nthe traditions of moral philosophy, or explaining how he was\ngenerating a new tradition. There may have been two reasons for his\ncaution. The first was that while there were bad things about\ncapitalism, there is, from a world historical point of view, much good\nabout it too. For without capitalism, communism would not be possible.\nCapitalism is to be transcended, not abolished, and this may be\ndifficult to convey in the terms of moral philosophy. \nSecond, and perhaps more importantly, we need to return to the\ncontrast between Marxian and other forms of socialism. Many\nnon-Marxian socialists appealed to universal ideas of truth and\njustice to defend their proposed schemes, and their theory of\ntransition was based on the idea that appealing to moral sensibilities\nwould be the best, perhaps only, way of bringing about the new chosen\nsociety. Marx wanted to distance himself from these other socialist\ntraditions, and a key point of distinction was to argue that the route\nto understanding the possibilities of human emancipation lay in the\nanalysis of historical and social forces, not in morality. Hence, for\nMarx, any appeal to morality was theoretically a backward step. \nThis leads us now to Marx’s assessment of communism. Would\ncommunism be a just society? In considering Marx’s attitude to\ncommunism and justice there are really only two viable possibilities:\neither he thought that communism would be a just society or he thought\nthat the concept of justice would not apply: that communism would\ntranscend justice. \nCommunism is described by Marx, in the Critique of the Gotha\nProgramme, as a society in which each person should contribute\naccording to their ability and receive according to their need. This\ncertainly sounds like a theory of justice, and could be adopted as\nsuch (Gilabert 2015). However, many will hold that it is truer to\nMarx’s thought to say that this is part of an account in which\ncommunism transcends justice, as Lukes has argued (Lukes 1987). \nIf we start with the idea that the point of ideas of justice is to\nresolve disputes, then a society without disputes would have no need\nor place for justice. We can see this by reflecting upon the idea of\nthe circumstances of justice in the work of David Hume\n(1711–1776). Hume argued that if there was enormous material\nabundance—if everyone could have whatever they wanted without\ninvading another’s share—we would never have devised rules\nof justice. And, of course, there are suggestions in Marx’s\nwritings that communism would be a society of such abundance. But Hume\nalso suggested that justice would not be needed in other\ncircumstances; if there were complete fellow-feeling between all human\nbeings, there would be no conflict and no need for justice. Of course,\none can argue whether either material abundance or human\nfellow-feeling to this degree would be possible, but the point is that\nboth arguments give a clear sense in which communism transcends\njustice. \nNevertheless, we remain with the question of whether Marx thought that\ncommunism could be commended on other moral grounds. On a broad\nunderstanding, in which morality, or perhaps better to say ethics, is\nconcerned with the idea of living well, it seems that communism can be\nassessed favourably in this light. One compelling argument is that\nMarx’s career simply makes no sense unless we can attribute such\na belief to him. But beyond this we can be brief in that the\nconsiderations adduced in\n Section 2\n above apply again. Communism clearly advances human flourishing, in\nMarx’s view. The only reason for denying that, in Marx’s\nvision, it would amount to a good society is a theoretical antipathy\nto the word “good”. And here the main point is that, in\nMarx’s view, communism would not be brought about by high-minded\nbenefactors of humanity. Quite possibly his determination to retain\nthis point of difference between himself and other socialists led him\nto disparage the importance of morality to a degree that goes beyond\nthe call of theoretical necessity. \nThe account of ideology contained in Marx’s writings is\nregularly portrayed as a crucial element of his intellectual legacy.\nIt has been identified as among his “most influential”\nideas (Elster 1986: 168), and acclaimed as “the most\nfertile” part of his social and political theory (Leiter 2004:\n84). Not least, these views on ideology are said to constitute\nMarx’s claim to a place—alongside Friedrich Nietzsche\n(1844–1900) and Sigmund Freud (1856–1939)—as one of\nthe “masters of suspicion”; that is, as an author whose\nwork casts doubt on the transparency of our everyday understandings of\nboth our own identity and the social world we inhabit (Ricouer 1970:\n32–33). \nGiven this enthusiastic reception, it can come as something of a\nsurprise to turn to Marx’s writings and discover how little they\ncontain about ideology, and how inchoate and opaque those infrequent\nand passing observations on that topic are. There are, of course, some\nfamous quotations, not least from The German Ideology\nmanuscripts. The references there to ideology as involving an\n“inversion” of the relation between individuals and their\ncircumstances, perhaps analogous to the workings of a “camera\nobscura”—an optical device which projected an image of its\nsurroundings, upside down but preserving perspective, onto a screen\ninside—have often mesmerised commentators but not always\ngenerated much genuine illumination (MECW 5: 36). The point\nshould not be exaggerated, but these striking images notwithstanding,\nthere is no clear and sustained discussion of ideology in the Marxian\ncorpus. \nMany commentators maintain that the search for a single model of\nideology in his work has to be given up. Indeed, there is something of\nan “arms race” in the literature, as commentators discover\ntwo, three, even five, competing models of ideology in Marx’s\nwritings (Mepham 1979; Wood 1981 [2004]; Rosen 1996). Most\nsurprisingly, it seems that some licence can be found in Marx’s\ncorpus for three very different ways of thinking about what ideology\nis. There is textual evidence of his variously utilising: a\n“descriptive” account of ideology involving a broadly\nanthropological study of the beliefs and rituals characteristic of\ncertain groups; a “positive” account of ideology as a\n“worldview” providing the members of a group with a sense\nof meaning and identity; and a “critical” account seeking\nto liberate individuals from certain false and misleading forms of\nunderstanding (Geuss 1981: 4–26). \nIt is the last of these—the critical account rather than either\nof the two “non-critical” accounts—which is central\nto his wider social and political theory, but this account is itself\nsubject to some considerable interpretative disagreement. Marx’s\ntheory of ideology is usually portrayed as an element in what might be\ncalled Marx’s sociology, as distinct from his philosophical\nanthropology say, or his theory of history (although complexly related\nto the latter). \nMarx does not view ideology as a feature of all societies, and, in\nparticular, suggests that it will not be a feature of a future\ncommunist society. However, ideology is portrayed as a feature of all\nclass-divided societies, and not only of capitalist\nsociety—although many of Marx’s comments on ideology are\nconcerned with the latter. The theory of ideology appears to play a\nrole in explaining a feature of class-divided societies which might\notherwise appear puzzling, namely what might be called their\n“stability”; that is, the absence of overt and serious\nconflict between social classes. This stability is not permanent, but\nit can last for extended historical periods. This stability appears\npuzzling to Marx because class-divided societies are flawed in ways\nwhich not only frustrate human flourishing, but also work to the\nmaterial advantage of the ruling minority. Why do the subordinate\nclasses, who form a majority, tolerate these flaws, when resistance\nand rebellion of various kinds might be in their objective\ninterests? \nMarx’s account of the sources of social stability in\nclass-divided societies appeals to both repressive and non-repressive\nmechanisms. Such societies might often involve the direct repression\n(or the threat of it) of one group by another, but Marx does not think\nthat this is the whole story. There are also non-repressive sources of\nsocial stability, and ideology is usually, and plausibly, considered\none of these. Very roughly, Marx’s account of ideology claims\nthat the dominant social ideas in such societies are typically false\nor misleading in a fashion that works to the advantage of the\neconomically dominant class. \nWe should note that ideology would seem to be a part and not the whole\nof Marx’s account of the non-repressive sources of stability in\nclass divided societies. Other factors might include: dull economic\npressure, including the daily grind of having to earn a living;\ndoubts—justified or otherwise—about the feasibility of\nalternatives; sensitivity to the possible costs of radical social\nchange; and collective action problems of various kinds which face\nthose who do want to rebel and resist. Marx does not think individuals\nare permanently trapped within ideological modes of thinking. Ideology\nmay have an initial hold, but it is not portrayed as impervious to\nreason and evidence, especially in circumstances in which the\nobjective conditions for social change obtain. \nFor Marx ideological beliefs are social in that they are widely\nshared, indeed so widely-shared that for long periods they constitute\nthe “ruling” or “dominant” ideas in a given\nclass-divided society (MECW 5: 59). And they are social in\nthat they directly concern, or indirectly impact upon, the\naction-guiding understandings of self and society that individuals\nhave. These action-guiding understandings include the dominant legal,\npolitical, religious, and philosophical views within particular\nclass-divided societies in periods of stability (MECW 29: 263). \nNot all false or misleading beliefs count for Marx as ideological.\nHonest scientific error, for example can be non-ideological. And\nideological belief can be misleading without being strictly false. For\nexample, defenders of the capitalist economy portray what Marx calls\nthe “wage form”, with its exchange of equivalents, as the\nwhole (rather than a part) of the story about the relation between\ncapital and labour, thereby ignoring the exploitation which occurs in\nthe sphere of production. Indeed, the notion of the\n“falsity” of ideology needs to be expanded beyond the\ncontent of the “ideas” in question, to include cases where\ntheir origins are in some way contaminated (Geuss 1981: 19–22).\nPerhaps the only reason I believe something to be the case is that the\nbelief in question has a consoling effect on me. Arguably such a\nbelief is held ideologically, even if it happens to be true.\nNevertheless paradigmatic examples of ideology have a false content.\nFor example, ideology often portrays institutions, policies, and\ndecisions which are in the interests of the economically dominant\nclass, as being in the interests of the society as a whole\n(MECW 5: 60); and ideology often portrays social and\npolitical arrangements which are contingent, or historical, or\nartificial, as being necessary, or universal, or natural\n(MECW 35: 605). \nIn addition to false or misleading content, ideological beliefs\ntypically have at least two additional characteristics, relating to\ntheir social origin and their class function. By the “social\norigin” of ideology is meant that Marx thinks of these ideas as\noften originating with, and being reinforced by, the complex structure\nof class-divided societies—a complex structure in which a\ndeceptive surface appearance is governed by underlying essential\nrelations (Geras 1986: 63–84). Capitalism is seen as especially\ndeceptive in appearance; for example, Marx often contrasts the\nrelative transparency of “exploitation” under feudalism,\nwith the way in which the “wage form” obscures the ratio\nof necessary and surplus labour in capitalist societies. Ideology\nstems, in part, from this deceptive surface appearance which makes it\ndifficult to grasp the underlying social flaws that benefit the\neconomically dominant class. Marx portrays the striving to uncover\nessences concealed by misleading appearances as characteristic of\nscientific endeavour (MECW 37, 804). And, in this context, he\ndistinguishes between classical political economy, which\nstrove—albeit not always successfully—to uncover the\nessential relations often concealed behind misleading appearances, and\nwhat he calls vulgar economy, which happily restricts itself to the\nmisleading appearances themselves (MECW 37, 804). \nBy the “class function” of ideology is meant that Marx\nholds that the pervasiveness of ideology is explained by the fact it\nhelps stabilise the economic structure of societies. All sorts of\nideas might get generated for all sorts of reasons, but the ones that\ntend to “stick” (become widely accepted) in class-divided\nsocieties do so, not because of their truth, but because they conceal\nor misrepresent or justify flaws in that society in ways which redound\nto the benefit of the economically dominant class (Rosen & Wolff\n1996: 235–236). \nIn response critics often see this as just another example of sloppy\nfunctional reasoning—purportedly widespread in the Marxist\ntradition—whereby a general pattern is asserted without the\nidentification of any of the mechanisms which might generate that\npattern. In the present case, it is said that Marx never properly\nexplains why the ruling ideas should be those of the ruling class\n(Elster 1985: 473). Yet there are obvious possible mechanisms here. To\ngive two examples. First, there is the control of the ruling class\nover the means of mental production, and in particular the print and\nbroadcast media which in capitalist societies are typically owned and\ncontrolled by the very wealthy (MECW 5, 59). A second\npossible mechanism appeals to the psychological need of individuals\nfor invented narratives that legitimise or justify their social\nposition; for instance, Marx identifies a widespread need, in flawed\nsocieties, for the consolatory effects of religion (MECW 3,\n175). \nThis broad heading—the state and politics—could cover very\nmany different issues. To make the present account manageable, only\ntwo are addressed here: Marx’s account of the state in\ncapitalist society; and Marx’s account of the fate of the state\nin communist society. (Consequently, many other important political\nissues—the nature of pre-capitalist states, relations between\nstates, the political transition to communism, and so on—are not\ndealt with.) \nMarx offers no unified theoretical account of the state in capitalist\nsociety. Instead his remarks on this topic are scattered across the\ncourse of his activist life, and deeply embedded in discussions of\ncontemporary events, events which most modern readers will know very\nlittle about. Providing some initial order to that complexity, Jon\nElster helpfully identifies three different models in Marx’s\nwritings of the relationship, in capitalist society, between the\npolitical state, on the one hand, and the economically dominant class,\non the other. (The next three paragraphs draw heavily on Elster 1985:\n409–437.) \nFirst, the “instrumental” model portrays the state as\nsimply a tool, directly controlled by the economically dominant class,\nin its own interests, at the expense of the interests both of other\nclasses and of the community as a whole. Marx is usually said to\nendorse the instrumental account in the Communist Manifesto,\nwhere he and Engels insist that “the executive of the modern\nstate is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole\nbourgeoisie” (MECW 6: 486). On this account, the state\nmight also act against the short term, or the factional, interests of\nparticular capitalists. The picture here is of the state as an\ninstrument directed—presumably by a subset of capitalists or\ntheir representatives—in ways which promote the long term\ninterests of the bourgeoisie as a whole. The precise mechanisms which\nmight facilitate that result are not clear in Marx’s\nwritings. \nSecond, the “class balance” model portrays the state as\nhaving interests of its own, with capitalist interests as merely one\nof the strategic limits on its pursuit of these. This model gets its\nname from the exceptional social circumstances said to explain the\nindependence of the state in this case. In situations where the social\npower of the two warring classes of contemporary\nsociety—capitalists and workers—are very nearly balanced,\nthe political state (and especially the executive) can gain\nindependence from both, exploiting that conflict in order to promote\nits own interests (the interests of the political caste). Something\nlike this picture appears in Marx’s discussions of the continued\nexistence of certain absolutist states after the revolutions of 1848,\nand of the Bonapartist state established in France by the coup of\nNapoleon III in December 1851. The state now competes with capitalists\nand proletarians (and is not merely the tool of the former), and by\n“promising each of the major classes to protect it against the\nother, the government can rule autonomously” (Elster 1985: 425).\nOn this account, the state has interests of its own, but presumably\nonly gets to pursue them if those promises to others are plausible,\nfinding some reflection in its policies and behaviour. Capitalist\ninterests accordingly remain a political constraint, but they are now\nonly one of the factors constraining the state’s actions rather\nthan constituting its primary goal. \nThird, the “abdication” model presents the bourgeoisie as\nstaying away from the direct exercise of political power, but doing\nthis because it is in their economic interests to do so. As Elster\nnotes, strictly speaking, “abdication” here covers two\nslightly different cases—first, where the bourgeoisie\nabdicate from the political power that they initially\ncontrolled (relevant to France); and, second, where the bourgeoisie\nabstain from taking political power in the first place\n(relevant to Britain and Germany)—but they can be treated\ntogether. In both cases, Marx identifies a situation where “in\norder to save its purse, [the bourgeoisie] must forfeit the\ncrown” (MECW 11: 143). Where the instrumental picture\nclaims that the state acts in the interests of the capitalist class\nbecause it is directly controlled by the latter, the\nabdication picture advances an explanatory connection between\nthe promotion of bourgeois interests and the retreat from the direct\nexercise of power. Circumstances obtain where “the political\nrule of the bourgeoisie” turns out to be\n“incompatible” with its continued economic flourishing,\nand the bourgeoisie seeks “to get rid of its own political rule\nin order to get rid of the troubles and dangers of ruling”\n(MECW 11: 173). There are several possible explanations of\nwhy the bourgeoisie might remain outside of politics in order to\npromote their own interests. To give three examples: the bourgeoisie\nmight recognise that their own characteristic short-termism could be\nfatal to their own interests if they exercised direct political as\nwell as economic power; the bourgeoisie might find political rule\nsufficiently time and effort consuming to withdraw from it,\ndiscovering that the economic benefits kept on coming regardless; or\nthe bourgeoisie might appreciate that abdication weakened their class\nopponents, forcing the proletariat to fight on two fronts (against\ncapital and government) and thereby making it less able to win those\nstruggles. \nThere are many questions one might have about these three models. \nFirst, one might wonder which of these three models best embodies\nMarx’s considered view? The instrumental account is the earliest\naccount, which he largely abandons from the early 1850s, presumably\nnoticing how poorly it captured contemporary political\nrealities—in particular, the stable existence of states which\nwere not directly run by the capitalist class, but which still in some\nway served their interests. That outcome is possible under either of\nthe two other accounts. However, Marx seems to have thought of the\nclass balance model as a temporary solution in exceptional\ncircumstances, and perhaps held that it failed to allow the stable\nexplanatory connection that he sought between the extant political\narrangements and the promotion of dominant economic interests. In\nshort, for better or worse, Marx’s considered view looks closer\nto the abdication account, reflecting his conviction that the central\nfeatures of political life are explained by the existing economic\nstructure. \nSecond, one might wonder which model allows greatest\n“autonomy” to the political state? A weak definition of\nstate autonomy might portray the state as autonomous when it is\nindependent of direct control by the economically dominant class. On\nthis definition, both the class balance and abdication\nmodels—but not the instrumental account—seem to provide\nfor autonomy. A stronger definition of state autonomy might require\nwhat Elster calls “explanatory autonomy”, which exists \nwhen (and to the extent that) its structure and policies cannot be\nexplained by the interest of an economically dominant class. (Elster\n1985: 405) \nOnly the class balance view seems to allow significant explanatory\nautonomy. In his preferred abdication account, Marx allows that the\nstate in capitalist society is independent of direct capitalist\ncontrol, but goes on to claim that its main structures (including that\nvery independence) and policies are ultimately explained by the\ninterests of the capitalist class. \nFor reasons discussed below (see\n Section 8),\n Marx declines to say much about the basic structure of a future\ncommunist society. However, in the case of the fate of the state, that\nreluctance is partially mitigated by his view that the institutional\narrangements of the Paris Commune prefigured the political dimensions\nof communist society. \nMarx’s views on the nature and fate of the state in communist\nsociety are to be distinguished from his infrequent, and subsequently\nnotorious, use of the term “the dictatorship of the\nproletariat”. (On the infrequency, context, and content, of\nthese uses see Draper 1986 and Hunt 1974.) The idea of\n“dictatorship” in this historical context has the\n(ancient) connotation of emergency rule rather than the (modern)\nconnotation of totalitarianism. Marx’s use makes it clear that\nany such temporary government should be democratic; for instance, in\nhaving majority support, and in preserving democratic rights (of\nspeech, association, and so on). However, it is by definition\n“extra-legal” in that it seeks to establish a new regime\nand not to preserve an old one. So understood, the dictatorship of the\nproletariat forms part of the political transition to communist\nsociety (a topic not covered here), rather than part of the\ninstitutional structure of communist society itself. The\n“dictatorial”—that is, the temporary and\nextra-legal—character of this regime ends with establishment of\na new and stable polity, and it is the latter which is discussed here\n(Hunt 1974: 297). \nThe character of the state in communist society consists, in part, of\nits form (its institutional arrangements) and its function (the tasks\nthat it undertakes). \nSome sense of the form of the state in communist society can\nbe gained from Marx’s engagement with the Paris Commune. His\npreferred future political arrangements involve a high degree of\nparticipation, and the radical “de-professionalisation” of\ncertain public offices. First, Marx is enthusiastic about regular\nelections, universal suffrage, mandat impératif,\nrecall, open executive proceedings, decentralisation, and so on.\nSecond, he objects to public offices (in the legislature, executive,\nand judiciary) being the spoils of a political caste, and sought to\nmake them working positions, remunerated at the average worker’s\nwage, and regularly circulating (through election). This combination\nof arrangements has been characterised as “democracy without\nprofessionals” (Hunt 1974: 365). Marx saw it as reflecting his\nview that: \nFreedom consists in converting the state from an organ superimposed\nupon society into one completely subordinate to it. (MECW 24:\n94) \nSome sense of the function of the state in communist society\ncan be gained from Marx’s distinction between\n“necessary” tasks that a state would need to undertake in\nall societies (at least, economically developed societies), and\n“unnecessary” tasks that a state would only need to\nundertake in class-divided societies. The difficulty here is less in\nallowing this distinction, than in deciding what might fall into each\ncategory. On the necessary side, Marx appears to require that the\nstate in communist society provide both: democratic solutions to\ncoordination problems (deciding which side of the road traffic should\ndrive on, for instance); and the supply of public goods (health,\nwelfare, education, and so on). On the unnecessary side, Marx seems to\nthink that a communist society might hugely reduce, or even eliminate,\nthe element of organised coercion found in most states (in the form of\nstanding armies, police forces, and so on). At least, this reduction\nmight be feasible once communist society had reached its higher stage\n(where distribution is based on “the needs principle”),\nand there is no longer a threat from non-communist societies. \nAgain, there are many reservations that one might have about this\naccount. \nFirst, many will be sceptical about its feasibility, and perhaps\nespecially of the purported reduction, still less elimination, of\nstate coercion. That scepticism might be motivated by the thought that\nthis would only be possible if communist society were characterised by\nwidespread social and political consensus, and that such consensus is,\nboth unlikely (at least, in modern societies), and undesirable\n(diversity and disagreement having a value). However, the reduction,\nor even elimination, of state coercion might be compatible with\ncertain forms of continuing disagreement about the ends and means of\ncommunist society. Imagine that a democratic communist polity\nintroduces a new law prohibiting smoking in public places, and that a\nrepresentative smoker (call her Anne) obeys that law despite being\namong the minority who wanted this practice permitted. Anne’s\nmotivation for obedience, we can stipulate, is grounded, not in fear\nof the likely response of bodies of armed persons enforcing the law,\nbut rather in respect for the democratic majority of the community of\nwhich she is a part. In short, reasonably strong assumptions about the\ndemocratic commitments of individuals might allow the scaling down of\norganised coercion without having to presume universal agreement\namongst citizens on all issues. \nSecond, some might object to the reference, throughout this section,\nto the “state” in communist society. It might be said that\na polity whose form and functions are so radically\ntransformed—the form by democratic participation and\nde-professionalisation, the function by eliminating historically\nunnecessary tasks—is insufficiently “state-like” to\nbe called a state. That is certainly possible, but the terminological\nclaim would appear to assume that there is greater clarity and\nagreement about just what a state is, either than is presupposed here\nor than exists in the world. Given that lack of consensus,\n“state” seems a suitably prudent choice. As well as being\nconsistent with some of Marx’s usage, it avoids prejudging this\nvery issue. However, anyone unmoved by those considerations can simply\nreplace “state”, in this context, with their own preferred\nalternative. \nIt is well-known that Marx never provided a detailed account of the\nbasic structure of the future communist society that he predicted.\nThis was not simply an omission on his part, but rather reflects his\ndeliberate commitment, as he colloquially has it, to refrain from\nwriting “recipes” for the “restaurants” of the\nfuture (MECW 35: 17, translation amended). \nThe reasoning that underpins this commitment can be reconstructed from\nMarx’s engagement with the radical political tradition that he\ncalled “utopian socialism”, and whose founding triumvirate\nwere Charles Fourier (1772–1837), Henri Saint-Simon\n(1760–1825), and Robert Owen (1771–1858). Note that the\ndistinction between Marxian socialism and utopian socialism is not an\nexhaustive one. Marx happily allows that there are socialists who are\nneither Marxian nor Utopian; for example, the “feudal\nsocialists” discussed in the Communist Manifesto. \nWhat distinguishes utopian from other socialists is, in large part,\ntheir view that providing persuasive constructive plans and\nblueprints of future socialist arrangements is a legitimate and\nnecessary activity. (The expression “plans and blueprints”\nis used here to capture the necessary detail of these\ndescriptions, and not to suggest that these designs have to be thought\nof as “stipulative”, as having to be followed to the\nletter.) On the utopian account, the socialist future needs to be\ndesigned before it can be delivered; the plans and blueprints being\nintended to guide and motivate socialists in their transformative\nambitions. Of course, that Marx is not in this sense utopian\ndoes not rule out the possibility of additional (here unspecified)\nsenses in which he might accurately be so described. \nMarx’s account of utopian socialism might appear contradictory.\nIt is certainly easy to find not only passages fiercely criticising\nutopian authors and texts, but also passages generously praising them.\nHowever, that criticism and that praise turn out to attach to slightly\ndifferent targets, revealing an underlying and consistent structure to\nhis account. \nThat underlying structure rests on two main distinctions. The first\ndistinction is a chronological one running between the\nfounding triumvirate, on the one hand, and second and subsequent\ngenerations of utopian socialists, on the other. (These later\ngenerations including both loyal followers of the founding\ntriumvirate, and independent later figures such as Étienne\nCabet (1788–1856)). The second distinction is a\nsubstantive one running between the critical part of utopian\nwritings (the portrayal of faults within contemporary capitalist\nsociety), on the one hand, and the constructive part of utopian\nwritings (the detailed description of the ideal socialist future), on\nthe other. \nNote that these distinctions underpin the asymmetry of Marx’s\nassessment of utopian socialism. Simply put: he is more enthusiastic\nand positive about the achievements of the first generation of\nutopians, by comparison with those of second and subsequent\ngenerations; and he is more enthusiastic and positive about the\nutopians’ criticism of contemporary society, by comparison with\nthe utopians’ constructive endeavours. \nThe remainder of this section will focus on Marx’s disapproval\nof the constructive endeavours of the utopians. \nIn trying to organise and understand Marx’s various criticisms\nof utopianism, it is helpful to distinguish between foundational and\nnon-foundational variants. (This distinction is intended to be\nexhaustive, in that all of his criticisms of utopianism will fall into\none of these two categories.) Non-foundational criticisms of\nutopian socialism are those which, if sound, would provide us with a\nreason to reject views which might be held by, or even be\ncharacteristic of, utopian socialists, but which are not constitutive\nof their utopianism. That is, they would give us a reason to abandon\nthe relevant beliefs, or to criticise those (including utopians) who\nheld them, but they would not give us cause to reject utopianism as\nsuch. In contrast, foundational criticisms of utopian\nsocialism are those which, if sound, would provide us with a reason to\nreject utopianism as such; that is, a reason to refrain from engaging\nin socialist design, a reason not to describe in relevant detail the\nsocialist society of the future. (Of course, that reason might not be\ndecisive, all things considered, but it would still count against\nutopianism per se.) \nMany of Marx’s best-known criticisms of utopian socialism are\nnon-foundational. For instance, in the Communist Manifesto,\nhe complains that utopian socialists hold a mistaken\n“ahistorical” view of social change. The utopians\npurportedly fail to understand that the achievement of socialism\ndepends on conditions which can only emerge at a certain stage of\nhistorical development. They might, for instance, recognise that there\nare strategic preconditions for socialism (for instance, the right\nblueprint and sufficient will to put it into practice), but\n(mistakenly on Marx’s account) imagine that those preconditions\ncould have appeared at any point in time. This complaint is\nnon-foundational in that one can accept that there are historical\nconditions for establishing a socialist society, and that the utopian\nsocialists fail to understand this, without thereby having a reason to\nabandon utopianism as such. A commitment to the necessity and\ndesirability of socialist design does not require one to hold an\n“ahistorical” view of social change. \nAssessing the soundness of non-foundational criticisms, and their\nrelevance to the utopian socialist tradition, is a complicated task\n(see Leopold 2018). However, even if sound and relevant, these\ncriticisms would provide no reason to abandon utopianism as\nsuch. Consequently, they are pursued no further here. Instead,\nthe focus is on the three main foundational arguments against\nutopianism that can be located in Marx’s writings; namely, that\nutopian plans and blueprints are necessarily undemocratic,\nimpossible, and redundant (see Leopold 2016). \nMarx’s first argument involves a normative claim that\nutopian plans and blueprints are undemocratic.\n(“Democracy” here connoting individual and collective\nself-determination, rather than political forms of governance.) The\nbasic argument runs: that it is undemocratic to limit the\nself-determination of individuals; that providing a plan or blueprint\nfor a socialist society limits the self-determination of individuals;\nand that therefore the provision of plans and blueprints for a\nsocialist society is undemocratic. If we add in the assumption that\nundemocratic means are undesirable; then we can conclude that it is\nundesirable to provide plans or blueprints of a future socialist\nsociety. One central reason for resisting this argument is that it is\nhard to identify a plausible account of the conditions for\nself-determination, according to which it is necessarily true that\nmerely providing a socialist plan or blueprint restricts\nself-determination. Indeed, one might heretically think that detailed\nplans and blueprints often tend to promote self-determination, helping\nindividuals think about where it is they want to go, and how they want\nto get there. \nMarx’s second argument rests on an epistemological\nclaim that that utopian plans and blueprints are impossible,\nbecause they require accurate knowledge of the future of a kind which\ncannot be had. The basic argument starts from the assumption that to\nbe of any use a blueprint must facilitate the construction of a future\nsocialist society. Moreover, to facilitate the construction of a\nfuture socialist society a blueprint must be completely accurate; and\nto be completely accurate a blueprint must predict all the relevant\ncircumstances of that future society. However, since it is not\npossible—given the complexity of the social world and the\nlimitations of human nature—to predict all the relevant\ncircumstances of that future society, we can conclude that socialist\nblueprints are of no use. One central reason for resisting this\nargument is that, whilst it is hard to deny that completely accurate\nplans are impossible (given the complexity of the world and the\nlimitations of human understanding), the claim that only completely\naccurate plans are useful seems doubtful. Plans are not simply\npredictions, and providing less than wholly accurate plans for\nourselves often forms part of the process whereby we help determine\nthe future for ourselves (insofar as that is possible). \nMarx’s third argument depends on an empirical claim\nthat utopian plans and blueprints are unnecessary, because\nsatisfactory solutions to social problems emerge automatically from\nthe unfolding of the historical process without themselves needing to\nbe designed. The basic argument runs as follows: that utopian\nblueprints describe the basic structure of the socialist society of\nthe future; and that such blueprints are necessary if and only if the\nbasic structure of future socialist society needs to be designed.\nHowever, given that the basic structure of the future socialist\nsociety develops automatically (without design assistance) within\ncapitalist society; and that the role of human agency in this\nunfolding historical process is to deliver (not design) that basic\nstructure, Marx concludes that utopian blueprints are redundant.\nReasons for resisting this argument include scepticism about both\nMarx’s reasoning and the empirical record. Marx is certain that\nhumankind does not need to design the basic structure of the future\nsocialist society, but it is not really made clear who or what does\nthat designing in its place. Moreover, the path of historical\ndevelopment since Marx’s day does not obviously confirm the\ncomplex empirical claim that the basic structure of socialist society\nis developing automatically within existing capitalism, needing only\nto be delivered (and not designed) by human agency. \nThis brief discussion suggests that there are cogent grounds for\ndoubting Marx’s claim that utopian plans and blueprints are\nnecessarily undemocratic, impossible, and redundant. \nFinally, recall that Marx is less enthusiastic about the second and\nsubsequent generations of utopians, than he is about the original\ntriumvirate. We might reasonably wonder about the rationale for\ngreater criticism of later utopians. It is important to recognise that\nit is not that second and subsequent generations make more or grosser\nerrors than the original triumvirate. (Indeed, Marx appears to think\nthat all these different generations largely held the same views, and\nmade the same mistakes). The relevant difference is rather that, by\ncomparison with their successors, this first generation were not to\nblame for those errors. In short, the rationale behind Marx’s\npreference for the first over the second and subsequent generations of\nutopian socialists is based on an understanding of historical\ndevelopment and an associated notion of culpability. \nMarx held that the intellectual formation of this first generation\ntook place in a historical context (the cusp of the eighteenth and\nnineteenth centuries) which was sufficiently developed to provoke\nsocialist criticism, but not sufficiently developed for that socialist\ncriticism to escape serious misunderstandings (Cohen 2000: 51). Since\nneither the material conditions of modern society, nor the historical\nagent capable of bringing socialism about, were sufficiently\ndeveloped, this first generation were bound to develop faulty accounts\nof the nature of, and transition to, socialism. However, that\ndefence—the historical unavoidability of error—is not\navailable to subsequent generations who, despite significantly changed\ncircumstances, hold fast to the original views of their intellectual\nforerunners. Marx maintains that more recent utopians, unlike the\noriginal triumvirate, really ought to know better. \nAt this point, we might be expected briefly to survey Marx’s\nlegacy. \nThat legacy is often elaborated in terms of movements and thinkers.\nHowever, so understood, the controversy and scale of that legacy make\nbrevity impossible, and this entry is already long enough. All we can\ndo here is gesture at the history and mention some further\nreading. \nThe chronology here might provisionally be divided into three\nhistorical periods: from Marx’s death until the Russia\nRevolution (1917); from the Russian Revolution to the fall of the\nBerlin Wall (1989); and since 1989. It seems hard to say much that is\ncertain about the last of these periods, but some generalisations\nabout the first two might be hazarded. \nThat first period of “Classical Marxism” can be thought of\nin two generational waves. The first smaller group of theorists was\nassociated with the Second International, and includes Karl Kautsky\n(1854–1938) and Plekhanov. The succeeding more activist\ngeneration includes Rosa Luxemburg (1871–1919), V.I. Lenin\n(1870–1924) and Leon Trotsky (1879–1940). \nThe second period is perhaps dominated by “Soviet Marxism”\nand the critical reaction from other Marxists that it provoked. The\nrepressive bureaucratic regimes which solidified in the Soviet Union\nand Eastern Europe repressed independent theoretical work, including\nscholarly editorial work on the writings of Marx and Engels. However,\nthey also provoked a critical reaction in the form of a body of\nthought often called “Western Marxism”, usually said to\ninclude the work of Antonio Gramsci (1891–1937), Theodor Adorno\n(1903–1969), and Althusser. The later parts of this period saw\nthe continuing development of “Critical Theory”, as well\nas the birth of currents such as “Analytical Marxism”\nwhose longer term impact is uncertain. \nThese first two periods are both partly covered by the Polish\nphilosopher and historian of ideas, Leszek Kołakowski, in the\nfinal two volumes of his encyclopaedic three volume Main Currents\nof Marxism (1976 [1978]). A succinct critical account of the\nemergence and distinctive character of Western Marxism is provided by\nPerry Anderson in his Considerations on Western Marxism\n(1976). And some of the more philosophically interesting authors in\nthis latter tradition are also covered elsewhere in this Encyclopaedia\n(see the\n Related Entries\n section below). Finally, and edging a little into the third of these\nhistorical periods, Christoph Henning offers an account of the (mis)\nreadings of Marx—especially those replacing social theory with\nmoral philosophy—in German philosophy from Heidegger to Habermas\nand beyond, in his Philosophy After Marx (2014). \nHowever, we might also think of Marx’s legacy, less in terms of\nthinkers and movements, and more in terms of reasons for wanting to\nstudy Marx’s ideas. In that context, we would stress that this\nis not simply a question of the truth of his various substantive\nclaims. The work of philosophers is, of course, also valued for the\noriginality, insight, potential, and so on, that it may also contain.\nAnd, so judged, Marx’s writings have much to offer. \nThe various strands of Marx’s thought surveyed here include his\nphilosophical anthropology, his theory of history, his critical\nengagement with the economic and political dimensions of capitalism,\nand a frustratingly vague outline of what might replace it. Whatever\nthe connections between these threads, it seems implausible to suggest\nthat Marx’s ideas form a system which has to be swallowed or\nrejected in its entirety. It might, for instance, be that Marx’s\ndiagnosis looks more persuasive than his remedies. Readers may have\nlittle confidence in his solutions, but that does not mean that the\nproblems he identifies are not acute.","contact.mail":"david.leopold@politics.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"politics.ox.ac.uk"}]
