Positive liberty is the possibility of\nacting — or the fact of acting — in such a way as to take\ncontrol of one's life and realize one's fundamental purposes. While\nnegative liberty is usually attributed to individual agents, positive\nliberty is sometimes attributed to collectivities, or to individuals\nconsidered primarily as members of given collectivities.\n\n\nThe idea of distinguishing between a negative and a positive sense of\nthe term ‘liberty’ goes back at least to Kant, and was\nexamined and defended in depth by Isaiah Berlin in the 1950s and\n’60s. Discussions about positive and negative liberty normally\ntake place within the context of political and social philosophy. They\nare distinct from, though sometimes related to, philosophical\ndiscussions about\n free will.\n Work on the nature of positive liberty often overlaps, however, with\nwork on the nature of\n autonomy.\n \n\nAs Berlin showed, negative and positive liberty are not merely two\ndistinct kinds of liberty; they can be seen as rival, incompatible\ninterpretations of a single political ideal. Since few people claim to\nbe against liberty, the way this term is interpreted and defined can\nhave important political implications. Political\n liberalism\n tends to presuppose a negative definition of liberty: liberals\ngenerally claim that if one favors individual liberty one should place\nstrong limitations on the activities of the state. Critics of\nliberalism often contest this implication by contesting the negative\ndefinition of liberty: they argue that the pursuit of liberty\nunderstood as self-realization or as self-determination (whether of\nthe individual or of the collectivity) can require state intervention\nof a kind not normally allowed by liberals.\n\n\nMany authors prefer to talk of positive and negative freedom.\nThis is only a difference of style, and the terms\n‘liberty’ and ‘freedom’ are normally used\ninterchangeably by political and social philosophers. Although some\nattempts have been made to distinguish between liberty and freedom\n(Pitkin 1988; Williams 2001; Dworkin 2011), generally speaking these\nhave not caught on. Neither can they be translated into other European\nlanguages, which contain only the one term, of either Latin or\nGermanic origin (e.g. liberté, Freiheit), where English\ncontains both.\n\nImagine you are driving a car through town, and you come to a fork in\nthe road. You turn left, but no one was forcing you to go one way or\nthe other. Next you come to a crossroads. You turn right, but no one\nwas preventing you from going left or straight on. There is no traffic\nto speak of and there are no diversions or police roadblocks. So you\nseem, as a driver, to be completely free. But this picture of your\nsituation might change quite dramatically if we consider that the\nreason you went left and then right is that you're addicted to\ncigarettes and you're desperate to get to the tobacconists before it\ncloses. Rather than driving, you feel you are being\ndriven, as your urge to smoke leads you uncontrollably to turn\nthe wheel first to the left and then to the right. Moreover, you're\nperfectly aware that your turning right at the crossroads means you'll\nprobably miss a train that was to take you to an appointment you care\nabout very much. You long to be free of this irrational desire that is\nnot only threatening your longevity but is also stopping you right now\nfrom doing what you think you ought to be doing. \nThis story gives us two contrasting ways of thinking of liberty. On\nthe one hand, one can think of liberty as the absence of obstacles\nexternal to the agent. You are free if no one is stopping you from\ndoing whatever you might want to do. In the above story you appear, in\nthis sense, to be free. On the other hand, one can think of liberty as\nthe presence of control on the part of the agent. To be free, you must\nbe self-determined, which is to say that you must be able to control\nyour own destiny in your own interests. In the above story you appear,\nin this sense, to be unfree: you are not in control of your own\ndestiny, as you are failing to control a passion that you yourself\nwould rather be rid of and which is preventing you from realizing what\nyou recognize to be your true interests. One might say that while on\nthe first view liberty is simply about how many doors are open to the\nagent, on the second view it is more about going through the right\ndoors for the right reasons. \nIn a famous essay first published in 1958, Isaiah Berlin called these\ntwo concepts of liberty negative and positive respectively (Berlin\n 1969).[1]\n The reason for using these labels is that in the first case liberty\nseems to be a mere absence of something (i.e. of obstacles,\nbarriers, constraints or interference from others), whereas in the\nsecond case it seems to require the presence of something\n(i.e. of control, self-mastery, self-determination or\nself-realization). In Berlin's words, we use the negative concept of\nliberty in attempting to answer the question “What is the area\nwithin which the subject — a person or group of persons —\nis or should be left to do or be what he is able to do or be, without\ninterference by other persons?”, whereas we use the positive\nconcept in attempting to answer the question “What, or who, is\nthe source of control or interference that can determine someone to\ndo, or be, this rather than that?” (1969, pp. 121–22). \nIt is useful to think of the difference between the two concepts in\nterms of the difference between factors that are external and factors\nthat are internal to the agent. While theorists of negative freedom\nare primarily interested in the degree to which individuals or groups\nsuffer interference from external bodies, theorists of positive\nfreedom are more attentive to the internal factors affecting the\ndegree to which individuals or groups act autonomously. Given this\ndifference, one might be tempted to think that a political philosopher\nshould concentrate exclusively on negative freedom, a concern with\npositive freedom being more relevant to psychology or individual\nmorality than to political and social institutions. This, however,\nwould be premature, for among the most hotly debated issues in\npolitical philosophy are the following: Is the positive\nconcept of freedom a political concept? Can individuals or groups\nachieve positive freedom through political action? Is it possible for\nthe state to promote the positive freedom of citizens on their behalf?\nAnd if so, is it desirable for the state to do so? The classic texts\nin the history of western political thought are divided over how these\nquestions should be answered: theorists in the classical liberal\ntradition, like Constant, Humboldt, Spencer and Mill, are typically\nclassed as answering ‘no’ and therefore as defending a\nnegative concept of political freedom; theorists that are critical of\nthis tradition, like Rousseau, Hegel, Marx and T.H. Green, are\ntypically classed as answering ‘yes’ and as defending a\npositive concept of political freedom. \nIn its political form, positive freedom has often been thought of as\nnecessarily achieved through a collectivity. Perhaps the clearest case\nis that of Rousseau's theory of freedom, according to which individual\nfreedom is achieved through participation in the process whereby one's\ncommunity exercises collective control over its own affairs in\naccordance with the ‘general will’. Put in the simplest\nterms, one might say that a democratic society is a free society\nbecause it is a self-determined society, and that a member of that\nsociety is free to the extent that he or she participates in its\ndemocratic process. But there are also individualist applications of\nthe concept of positive freedom. For example, it is sometimes said\nthat a government should aim actively to create the conditions\nnecessary for individuals to be self-sufficient or to achieve\nself-realization. The welfare state has sometimes been defended on\nthis basis, as has the idea of a universal basic income. The negative\nconcept of freedom, on the other hand, is most commonly assumed in\nliberal defences of the constitutional liberties typical of\nliberal-democratic societies, such as freedom of movement, freedom of\nreligion, and freedom of speech, and in arguments against paternalist\nor moralist state intervention. It is also often invoked in defences\nof the right to private property. This said, some philosophers have\ncontested the claim that private property necessarily enhances\nnegative liberty (Cohen 1991, 1995), and still others have tried to\nshow that negative liberty can ground a form of egalitarianism\n(Steiner 1994). \nAfter Berlin, the most widely cited and best developed analyses of the\nnegative concept of liberty include Hayek (1960), Day (1971),\nOppenheim (1981), Miller (1983) and Steiner (1994). Among the most\nprominent contemporary analyses of the positive concept of liberty are\nMilne (1968), Gibbs (1976), C. Taylor (1979) and Christman (1991,\n2005). \nMany liberals, including Berlin, have suggested that the positive\nconcept of liberty carries with it a danger of authoritarianism.\nConsider the fate of a permanent and oppressed minority. Because the\nmembers of this minority participate in a democratic process\ncharacterized by majority rule, they might be said to be free on the\ngrounds that they are members of a society exercising self-control\nover its own affairs. But they are oppressed, and so are surely\nunfree. Moreover, it is not necessary to see a society as democratic\nin order to see it as self-controlled; one might instead adopt an\norganic conception of society, according to which the collectivity is\nto be thought of as a living organism, and one might believe that this\norganism will only act rationally, will only be in control of itself,\nwhen its various parts are brought into line with some rational plan\ndevised by its wise governors (who, to extend the metaphor, might be\nthought of as the organism's brain). In this case, even the majority\nmight be oppressed in the name of liberty. \nSuch justifications of oppression in the name of liberty are no mere\nproducts of the liberal imagination, for there are notorious\nhistorical examples of their endorsement by authoritarian political\nleaders. Berlin, himself a liberal and writing during the cold war,\nwas clearly moved by the way in which the apparently noble ideal of\nfreedom as self-mastery or self-realization had been twisted and\ndistorted by the totalitarian dictators of the twentieth century\n— most notably those of the Soviet Union — so as to claim\nthat they, rather than the liberal West, were the true champions of\nfreedom. The slippery slope towards this paradoxical conclusion\nbegins, according to Berlin, with the idea of a divided self. To\nillustrate: the smoker in our story provides a clear example of a\ndivided self, for she is both a self that desires to get to an\nappointment and a self that desires to get to the tobacconists, and\nthese two desires are in conflict. We can now enrich this story in a\nplausible way by adding that one of these selves — the keeper of\nappointments — is superior to the other: the self that is a\nkeeper of appointments is thus a ‘higher’ self, and the\nself that is a smoker is a ‘lower’ self. The higher self\nis the rational, reflecting self, the self that is capable of moral\naction and of taking responsibility for what she does. This is the\ntrue self, for rational reflection and moral responsibility are the\nfeatures of humans that mark them off from other animals. The lower\nself, on the other hand, is the self of the passions, of unreflecting\ndesires and irrational impulses. One is free, then, when one's higher,\nrational self is in control and one is not a slave to one's passions\nor to one's merely empirical self. The next step down the slippery\nslope consists in pointing out that some individuals are more rational\nthan others, and can therefore know best what is in their and others'\nrational interests. This allows them to say that by forcing people\nless rational than themselves to do the rational thing and thus to\nrealize their true selves, they are in fact liberating them from their\nmerely empirical desires. Occasionally, Berlin says, the defender of\npositive freedom will take an additional step that consists in\nconceiving of the self as wider than the individual and as represented\nby an organic social whole — “a tribe, a race, a church, a\nstate, the great society of the living and the dead and the yet\nunborn”. The true interests of the individual are to be\nidentified with the interests of this whole, and individuals can and\nshould be coerced into fulfilling these interests, for they would not\nresist coercion if they were as rational and wise as their coercers.\n“Once I take this view”, Berlin says, “I am in a\nposition to ignore the actual wishes of men or societies, to bully,\noppress, torture in the name, and on behalf, of their\n‘real’ selves, in the secure knowledge that whatever is\nthe true goal of man ... must be identical with his freedom”\n(Berlin 1969, pp. 132–33). \nThose in the negative camp try to cut off this line of reasoning at\nthe first step, by denying that there is any necessary relation\nbetween one's freedom and one's desires. Since one is free to the\nextent that one is externally unprevented from doing things, they say,\none can be free to do what one does not desire to do. If being free\nmeant being unprevented from realizing one's desires, then one could,\nagain paradoxically, reduce one's unfreedom by coming to desire fewer\nof the things one is unfree to do. One could become free simply by\ncontenting oneself with one's situation. A perfectly contented slave\nis perfectly free to realize all of her desires. Nevertheless, we tend\nto think of slavery as the opposite of freedom. More generally,\nfreedom is not to be confused with happiness, for in logical terms\nthere is nothing to stop a free person from being unhappy or an unfree\nperson from being happy. The happy person might feel free,\nbut whether they are free is another matter (Day, 1970).\nNegative theorists of freedom therefore tend to say not that having\nfreedom means being unprevented from doing as one desires, but that it\nmeans being unprevented from doing whatever one might desire to do\n(Steiner 1994. Cf. Van Parijs 1995; Sugden 2006). \nSome theorists of positive freedom bite the bullet and say that the\ncontented slave is indeed free — that in order to be free the\nindividual must learn, not so much to dominate certain merely\nempirical desires, but to rid herself of them. She must, in other\nwords, remove as many of her desires as possible. As Berlin puts it,\nif I have a wounded leg ‘there are two methods of freeing myself\nfrom pain. One is to heal the wound. But if the cure is too difficult\nor uncertain, there is another method. I can get rid of the wound by\ncutting off my leg’ (1969, pp. 135–36). This is the\nstrategy of liberation adopted by ascetics, stoics and Buddhist sages.\nIt involves a ‘retreat into an inner citadel’ — a\nsoul or a purely noumenal self — in which the individual is\nimmune to any outside forces. But this state, even if it can be\nachieved, is not one that liberals would want to call one of freedom,\nfor it again risks masking important forms of oppression. It is, after\nall, often in coming to terms with excessive external limitations in\nsociety that individuals retreat into themselves, pretending to\nthemselves that they do not really desire the worldly goods or\npleasures they have been denied. Moreover, the removal of desires may\nalso be an effect of outside forces, such as brainwashing, which we\nshould hardly want to call a realization of freedom. \nBecause the concept of negative freedom concentrates on the external\nsphere in which individuals interact, it seems to provide a better\nguarantee against the dangers of paternalism and authoritarianism\nperceived by Berlin. To promote negative freedom is to promote the\nexistence of a sphere of action within which the individual is\nsovereign, and within which she can pursue her own projects subject\nonly to the constraint that she respect the spheres of others.\nHumboldt and Mill, both advocates of negative freedom, compared the\ndevelopment of an individual to that of a plant: individuals, like\nplants, must be allowed to grow, in the sense of developing their own\nfaculties to the full and according to their own inner logic. Personal\ngrowth is something that cannot be imposed from without, but must come\nfrom within the individual. \nCritics, however, have objected that the ideal described by Humboldt\nand Mill looks much more like a positive concept of liberty than a\nnegative one. Positive liberty consists, they say, in exactly this\ngrowth of the individual: the free individual is one that develops,\ndetermines and changes her own desires and interests autonomously and\nfrom within. This is not liberty as the mere absence of obstacles, but\nliberty as autonomy or self-realization. Why should the mere absence\nof state interference be thought to guarantee such growth? Is there\nnot some third way between the extremes of totalitarianism and the\nminimal state of the classical liberals — some non-paternalist,\nnon-authoritarian means by which positive liberty in the above sense\ncan be actively promoted? \nMuch of the more recent work on positive liberty has been motivated by\na dissatisfaction with the ideal of negative liberty combined with an\nawareness of the possible abuses of the positive concept so forcefully\nexposed by Berlin. John Christman (1991, 2005, 2009), for example, has\nargued that positive liberty concerns the ways in which\ndesires are formed — whether as a result of rational reflection\non all the options available, or as a result of pressure, manipulation\nor ignorance. What it does not regard, he says, is the\ncontent of an individual's desires. The promotion of positive\nfreedom need not therefore involve the claim that there is only one\nright answer to the question of how a person should live, nor need it\nallow, or even be compatible with, a society forcing its members into\ngiven patterns of behavior. Take the example of a Muslim woman who\nclaims to espouse the fundamentalist doctrines generally followed by\nher family and the community in which she lives. On Christman's\naccount, this person is positively unfree if her desire to conform was\nsomehow oppressively imposed upon her through indoctrination,\nmanipulation or deceit. She is positively free, on the other hand, if\nshe arrived at her desire to conform while aware of other reasonable\noptions and she weighed and assessed these other options rationally.\nEven if this woman seems to have a preference for subservient\nbehavior, there is nothing necessarily freedom-enhancing or\nfreedom-restricting about her having the desires she has, since\nfreedom regards not the content of these desires but their mode of\nformation. On this view, forcing her to do certain things rather than\nothers can never make her more free, and Berlin's paradox of positive\nfreedom would seem to have been avoided. \nIt remains to be seen, however, just what a state can do, in practice,\nto promote positive liberty in Christman's sense without encroaching\non any individual's sphere of negative liberty: the conflict between\nthe two ideals seems to survive his alternative analysis, albeit in a\nmilder form. Even if we rule out coercing individuals into specific\npatterns of behavior, a state interested in promoting autonomy in\nChristman's sense might still be allowed considerable space for\nintervention of an informative and educational nature, perhaps\nsubsidizing some activities (in order to encourage a plurality of\ngenuine options) and financing this through taxation. Liberals might\ncriticize this on anti-paternalist grounds, objecting that such\nmeasures will require the state to use resources in ways that the\nsupposedly heteronomous individuals, if left to themselves, might have\nchosen to spend in other ways. Some liberals will make an exception in\nthe case of the education of children (in such a way as to cultivate\nopen minds and rational reflection), but even here other liberals will\nobject that the right to negative liberty includes the right to decide\nhow one's children should be educated. \nOther theorists of liberty have remained closer to the negative\nconcept but have attempted to go beyond it, saying that liberty is not\nmerely the enjoyment of a sphere of non-interference but the enjoyment\nof certain conditions in which such non-interference is guaranteed\n(see especially Pettit 1997, 2001, 2014, and Skinner 1998, 2002).\nThese conditions may include the presence of a democratic constitution\nand a series of safeguards against a government wielding power\narbitrarily, including the separation of powers and the exercise of\ncivic virtues on the part of citizens. As Berlin admits, on the\nnegative view, I am free even if I live in a dictatorship just as long\nas the dictator happens, on a whim, not to interfere with me (see also\nHayek 1960). There is no necessary connection between negative liberty\nand any particular form of government. On the alternative view\nsketched here, I am free only if I live in a society with the kinds of\npolitical institutions that guarantee the independence of each citizen\nfrom exercises of arbitrary power. Quentin Skinner has called this\nview of freedom ‘neo-Roman’, invoking ideas about freedom\nboth of the ancient Romans and of a number of Renaissance and early\nmodern writers. Philip Pettit has called the same view\n‘republican’, and this label has tended to dominate in the\nrecent literature (Weinstock and Nadeau 2004; Larmore 2004; Laborde\nand Maynor 2008). \nRepublican freedom can be thought of as a kind of status: to\nbe a free person is to enjoy the rights and privileges attached to the\nstatus of republican citizenship, whereas the paradigm of the unfree\nperson is the slave. Freedom is not simply a matter of\nnon-interference, for a slave may enjoy a great deal of\nnon-interference at the whim of her master. What makes her unfree is\nher status, such that she is permanently liable to interference of any\nkind. Even if the slave enjoys non-interference, she is, as Pettit\nputs it, ‘dominated’, because she is permanently subject\nto the arbitrary power of her owner. \nContemporary republicans therefore claim that their view of freedom is\nquite distinct from the negative view of freedom. As we have seen, one\ncan enjoy non-interference without enjoying non-domination;\nconversely, according to Pettit, one can enjoy non-domination while\nnevertheless being interfered with, just as long as the interference\nin question is constrained, through republican power structures, to\ntrack one's interests. Only arbitrary power is inimical to freedom,\nnot power as such. On the other hand, republican freedom is also\ndistinct from positive freedom as expounded and criticized by Berlin.\nFirst, republican freedom does not consist in the activity of virtuous\npolitical participation; rather, that participation is seen as\ninstrumentally related to freedom as non-domination. Secondly, the\nrepublican concept of freedom cannot lead to anything like the\noppressive consequences feared by Berlin, because it has a commitment\nto non-domination and to liberal-democratic institutions already built\ninto it. \nIt remains to be seen, however, whether the republican concept of\nfreedom is ultimately distinguishable from the negative concept, or\nwhether republican writers on freedom have not simply provided good\narguments to the effect that negative freedom is best promoted, on\nbalance and over time, through certain kinds of political\ninstitutions rather than others. While there is no necessary\nconnection between negative liberty and democratic government, there\nmay nevertheless be a strong empirical correlation between the two.\nIan Carter (1999, 2008), Matthew H. Kramer (2003, 2008), and Robert\nGoodin and Frank Jackson (2007) have argued, along these lines, that\nrepublican policies are best defended empirically on the basis of the\nstandard negative ideal of freedom, rather than on the basis of a\nconceptual challenge to that ideal. An important premise in such an\nargument is that the extent of a person's negative freedom is a\nfunction not simply of how many single actions are prevented, but of\nhow many different act-combinations are prevented. On this\nbasis, people who can achieve their goals only by bowing and scraping\nto their masters must be seen as less free than people who can achieve\nthose goals unconditionally. Another important premise is that the\nextent to which a person is negatively free depends, in part, on\nthe probability with which he or she will be constrained from\nperforming future acts or act-combinations. People who are subject to\narbitrary power can be seen as less free in the negative sense even if\nthey do not actually suffer interference, because the probability of\ntheir suffering constraints is always greater (ceteris\nparibus, as a matter of empirical fact) than it would be if they\nwere not subject to that arbitrary power. Perhaps this non-trivial\nprobability is sufficient to explain the sense of exposure and\nprecariousness of the ‘dominated’. In reply, Pettit\n(2008a, 2008b) and Skinner (2008) have insisted that what matters for\nan agent's freedom is the impossibility of others interfering with\nimpunity, not the improbability of their doing so. \nMuch of the most recent literature on political and social freedom has\nconcentrated on the above debate over the differences between the\nrepublican and liberal (i.e. negative) conceptions of freedom.\nCritiques of the republican conception that build on, or are otherwise\nsympathetic to, those of Carter and Kramer, can be found in Bruin\n(2009), Lang (2012) and Shnayderman (2012). Pettit himself has\ncontinued to refine his position, and has further discussed its\nrelation to that of Berlin (Pettit 2011). Berlin's own conception of\nnegative liberty, he argues, occupies an inherently unstable position\nbetween the more restrictive Hobbesian view and the more expansive\nview of freedom as non-domination. \nPettit's analysis of freedom has inspired a number of recent works by\npolitical theorists sympathetic to the republican tradition. Frank\nLovett has developed an account of domination as a descriptive\nconcept, and of justice as the minimization of domination (Lovett\n2010). Several other authors have made use of the concept of\ndomination in addressing more specific problems in normative political\ntheory, such as disability rights, workplace democracy, social\nequality, and education policy (De Wispelaere and Casassas 2014; Breen\nand McBride 2015).  \nThe two sides identified by Berlin disagree over which of two\ndifferent concepts best deserves the name of ‘liberty’.\nDoes this fact not denote the presence of some more basic\nagreement between the two sides? How, after all, could they\nsee their disagreement as one about the definition of liberty if they\ndid not think of themselves as in some sense talking about the\nsame thing? In an influential article, the American legal\nphilosopher Gerald MacCallum (1967) put forward the following answer:\nthere is in fact only one basic concept of freedom, on which both\nsides in the debate converge. What the so-called negative and\npositive theorists disagree about is how this single concept of\nfreedom should be interpreted. Indeed, in MacCallum's view, there are\na great many different possible interpretations of freedom, and it is\nonly Berlin's artificial dichotomy that has led us to think in terms\nof there being two. \nMacCallum defines the basic concept of freedom — the concept on\nwhich everyone agrees — as follows: a subject, or agent, is free\nfrom certain constraints, or preventing conditions, to do or become\ncertain things. Freedom is therefore a triadic relation — that\nis, a relation between three things: an agent, certain\npreventing conditions, and certain doings or becomings of the agent.\nAny statement about freedom or unfreedom can be translated into a\nstatement of the above form by specifying what is free or\nunfree, from what it is free or unfree, and what it is free\nor unfree to do or become. Any claim about the presence or\nabsence of freedom in a given situation will therefore make certain\nassumptions about what counts as an agent, what counts as a constraint\nor limitation on freedom, and what counts as a purpose that the agent\ncan be described as either free or unfree to carry out. \nThe definition of freedom as a triadic relation was first put forward\nin the seminal work of Felix Oppenheim in the 1950s and 60s. Oppenheim\nsaw that an important meaning of ‘freedom’ in the context\nof political and social philosophy was as a relation between two\nagents and a particular (impeded or unimpeded) action. This\ninterpretation of freedom remained, however, what Berlin would call a\nnegative one. What MacCallum did was to generalize this triadic\nstructure so that it would cover all possible claims about freedom,\nwhether of the negative or the positive variety. In MacCallum's\nframework, unlike in Oppenheim's, the interpretation of each of the\nthree variables is left open. In other words, MacCallum's position is\na meta-theoretical one: his is a theory about the differences between\ntheorists of freedom. \nTo illustrate MacCallum's point, let us return to the example of the\nsmoker driving to the tobacconists. In describing this person as\neither free or unfree, we shall be making assumptions about each of\nMacCallum's three variables. If we say that the driver is\nfree, what we shall probably mean is that an agent,\nconsisting in the driver's empirical self, is free from external\n(physical or legal) obstacles to do whatever he or she might want to\ndo. If, on the other hand, we say that the driver is unfree,\nwhat we shall probably mean is that an agent, consisting in a higher\nor rational self, is made unfree by internal, psychological\nconstraints to carry out some rational, authentic or virtuous plan.\nNotice that in both claims there is a negative element and a positive\nelement: each claim about freedom assumes both that freedom\nis freedom from something (i.e., preventing conditions)\nand that it is freedom to do or become something.\nThe dichotomy between ‘freedom from’ and ‘freedom\nto’ is therefore a false one, and it is misleading to say that\nthose who see the driver as free employ a negative concept and those\nwho see the driver as unfree employ a positive one. What these two\ncamps differ over is the way in which one should interpret each of the\nthree variables in the triadic freedom-relation. More precisely, we\ncan see that what they differ over is the extension to be\nassigned to each of the variables. \nThus, those whom Berlin places in the negative camp typically conceive\nof the agent as having the same extension as that which it is\ngenerally given in ordinary discourse: they tend to think of the agent\nas an individual human being and as including all of the empirical\nbeliefs and desires of that individual. Those in the so-called\npositive camp, on the other hand, often depart from the ordinary\nnotion, in one sense imagining the agent as more extensive than in the\nordinary notion, and in another sense imagining it as less extensive:\nthey think of the agent as having a greater extension than in ordinary\ndiscourse in cases where they identify the agent's true desires and\naims with those of some collectivity of which she is a member; and\nthey think of the agent as having a lesser extension than in ordinary\ndiscourse in cases where they identify the true agent with only a\nsubset of her empirical beliefs and desires — i.e., with those\nthat are rational, authentic or virtuous. Secondly, those in Berlin's\npositive camp tend to take a wider view of what counts as a constraint\non freedom than those in his negative camp: the set of relevant\nobstacles is more extensive for the former than for the latter, since\nnegative theorists tend to count only external obstacles as\nconstraints on freedom, whereas positive theorists also allow that one\nmay be constrained by internal factors, such as irrational desires,\nfears or ignorance. And thirdly, those in Berlin's positive camp tend\nto take a narrower view of what counts as a purpose one can be free to\nfulfill. The set of relevant purposes is less extensive for them than\nfor the negative theorists, for we have seen that they tend to\nrestrict the relevant set of actions or states to those that are\nrational, authentic or virtuous, whereas those in the negative camp\ntend to extend this variable so as to cover any action or state the\nagent might desire. \nOn MacCallum's analysis, then, there is no simple dichotomy between\npositive and negative liberty; rather, we should recognize that there\nis a whole range of possible interpretations or\n‘conceptions’ of the single concept of liberty. Indeed, as\nMacCallum says and as Berlin seems implicitly to admit, a number of\nclassic authors cannot be placed unequivocally in one or the other of\nthe two camps. Locke, for example, is normally thought of as one of\nthe fathers or classical liberalism and therefore as a staunch\ndefender of the negative concept of freedom. He indeed states\nexplicitly that ‘[to be at] liberty is to be free from restraint\nand violence from others’. But he also says that liberty is not\nto be confused with ‘license’, and that “that ill\ndeserves the name of confinement which hedges us in only from bogs and\nprecipices” (Second Treatise, parags. 6 and 57). While\nLocke gives an account of constraints on freedom that Berlin would\ncall negative, he seems to endorse an account of MacCallum's third\nfreedom-variable that Berlin would call positive, restricting this to\nactions that are not immoral (liberty is not license) and to those\nthat are in the agent's own interests (I am not unfree if prevented\nfrom falling into a bog). A number of contemporary libertarians have\nprovided or assumed definitions of freedom that are similarly morally\nloaded (e.g. Nozick 1974; Rothbard 1982). This would seem to confirm\nMacCallum's claim that it is conceptually and historically misleading\nto divide theorists into two camps — a negative liberal one and\na positive non-liberal one. \nTo illustrate the range of interpretations of the concept of freedom\nmade available by MacCallum's analysis, let us now take a closer look\nat his second variable — that of constraints on freedom. \nAdvocates of negative conceptions of freedom typically restrict the\nrange of obstacles that count as constraints on freedom to those that\nare brought about by other agents. For theorists who conceive of\nconstraints on freedom in this way, I am unfree only to the extent\nthat other people prevent me from doing certain things. If I\nam incapacitated by natural causes — by a genetic handicap, say,\nor by a virus or by certain climatic conditions — I may be\nrendered unable to do certain things, but I am not, for that\nreason, rendered unfree to do them. Thus, if you lock me in\nmy house, I shall be both unable and unfree to leave. But if I am\nunable to leave because I suffer from a debilitating illness or\nbecause a snow drift has blocked my exit, I am nevertheless not\nunfree, to leave. The reason such theorists give, for restricting the\nset of relevant preventing conditions in this way, is that they see\nunfreedom as a social relation — a relation between\npersons (see Oppenheim 1961; Miller 1983; Steiner 1983;\nKristjánsson 1996; Kramer 2003; Morriss 2012; Shnayderman 2013;\nSchmidt forthcoming). Unfreedom as mere inability is thought by such\nauthors to be more the concern of engineers and medics than of\npolitical and social philosophers. (If I suffer from a natural or\nself-inflicted inability to do something, should we to say that I\nremain free to do it, or should we say that the inability\nremoves my freedom to do it while nevertheless not implying that I am\nunfree to do it? In the latter case, we shall be endorsing a\n‘trivalent’ conception, according to which there are some\nthings that a person is neither free nor unfree to do. Kramer 2003\nendorses a trivalent conception according to which freedom is\nidentified with ability and unfreedom is the prevention (by others) of\noutcomes that the agent would otherwise be able to bring about.)  \nIn attempting to distinguish between natural and social obstacles we\nshall inevitably come across gray areas. An important example is that\nof obstacles created by impersonal economic forces. Do economic\nconstraints like recession, poverty and unemployment merely\nincapacitate people, or do they also render them unfree? Libertarians\nand egalitarians have provided contrasting answers to this question by\nappealing to different conceptions of constraints. Thus, one way of\nanswering the question is by taking an even more restrictive view of\nwhat counts as a constraint on freedom, so that only a subset of the\nset of obstacles brought about by other persons counts as a\nrestriction of freedom: those brought about intentionally. In\nthis case, impersonal economic forces, being brought about\nunintentionally, do not restrict people's freedom, even\nthough they undoubtedly make many people unable to do many\nthings. This last view has been taken by a number of market-oriented\nlibertarians, including, most famously, Friedrich von Hayek (1960,\n1982), according to whom freedom is the absence of coercion, where to\nbe coerced is to be subject to the arbitrary will of another. (Notice\nthe somewhat surprising similarity between this conception of freedom\nand the republican conception discussed earlier, in section 3.2)\nCritics of libertarianism, on the other hand, typically endorse a\nbroader conception of constraints on freedom that includes not only\nintentionally imposed obstacles but also unintended obstacles for\nwhich someone may nevertheless be held responsible (for Miller and\nKristjánsson and Shnayderman this means morally\nresponsible; for Oppenheim and Kramer it means causally\nresponsible), or indeed obstacles created in any way whatsoever, so\nthat unfreedom comes to be identical to inability (see Crocker 1980;\nCohen 1988; Sen 1992; Van Parijs 1995). \nThis analysis of constraints helps to explain why socialists and\negalitarians have tended to claim that the poor in a capitalist\nsociety are as such unfree, or that they are less free than the rich,\nwhereas libertarians have tended to claim that the poor in a\ncapitalist society are no less free than the rich. Egalitarians\ntypically (though not always) assume a broader notion than\nlibertarians of what counts as a constraint on freedom. Although this\nview does not necessarily imply what Berlin would call a positive\nnotion of freedom, egalitarians often call their own definition a\npositive one, in order to convey the sense that freedom requires not\nmerely the absence of certain social relations of prevention but the\npresence of abilities, or what Amartya Sen has influentially called\n‘capabilities’ (Sen 1985, 1988, 1992). (Important\nexceptions to this egalitarian tendency to broaden the relevant set of\nconstraints include Waldron (1993) and Cohen (2011), who demonstrate,\nfor the sake of argument, that relative poverty is in fact empirically\ninseparable from, and indeed proportional to, the imposition of\nphysical barriers by other agents, and Steiner (1994), who grounds a\nleft-libertarian theory of justice in the idea of an equal\ndistribution of social freedom.) \nWe have seen that advocates of a negative conception of freedom tend\nto count only obstacles that are external to the agent. Notice,\nhowever, that the term ‘external’ is ambiguous in this\ncontext, for it might be taken to refer either to the location of the\ncausal source of an obstacle or to the location of the obstacle\nitself. Obstacles that count as ‘internal’ in terms of\ntheir own location include psychological phenomena such as ignorance,\nirrational desires, illusions and phobias. Such constraints can be\ncaused in various ways: for example, they might have a genetic origin,\nor they might be brought about intentionally by others, as in the case\nof brainwashing or manipulation. In the first case we have an internal\nconstraint brought about by natural causes; in the second, an internal\nconstraint intentionally imposed by another human agent. \nMore generally, we can now see that there are in fact two different\ndimensions along which one's notion of a constraint might be broader\nor narrower. A first dimension is that of the source of a\nconstraint — in other words, what it is that brings about a\nconstraint on freedom. We have seen, for example, that some theorists\ninclude as constraints on freedom only obstacles brought about by\nhuman action, whereas others also include obstacles with a natural\norigin. A second dimension is that of the type of constraint\ninvolved, where constraint-types include the types of internal\nconstraint just mentioned, but also various types of constraint\nlocated outside the agent, such as physical barriers that render an\naction impossible, obstacles that render the performance of an action\nmore or less difficult, and costs attached to the performance of a\n(more or less difficult) action. The two dimensions of type and source\nare logically independent of one another. Given this independence, it\nis theoretically possible to combine a narrow view of what counts as a\nsource of a constraint with a broad view of what types of obstacle\ncount as unfreedom-generating constraints, or vice versa. As\na result, it is not clear that theorists who are normally placed in\nthe ‘negative’ camp need deny the existence of internal\nconstraints on freedom (see Kramer 2003; Garnett 2007). \nTo illustrate the independence of the two dimensions of type and\nsource, consider the case of the unorthodox libertarian Hillel Steiner\n(1974–5, 1994). On the one hand, Steiner has a much\nbroader view than Hayek of the possible sources of\nconstraints on freedom: he does not limit the set of such sources to\nintentional human actions, but extends it to cover all kinds of human\ncause, whether or not any humans intend such causes and whether or not\nthey can be held morally accountable for them, believing that any\nrestriction of such non-natural sources can only be an arbitrary\nstipulation, usually arising from some more or less conscious\nideological bias. On the other hand, Steiner has an even\nnarrower view than Hayek about what type of obstacle\ncounts as a constraint on freedom: for Steiner, an agent only counts\nas unfree to do something if it is physically impossible for\nher to do that thing. Any extension of the constraint variable to\ninclude other types of obstacle, such as the costs anticipated in\ncoercive threats, would, in his view, necessarily involve a reference\nto the agent's desires, and we have seen (in sec. 2) that for those\nliberals in the negative camp there is no necessary relation between\nan agent's freedom and her desires. Consider the coercive threat\n‘Your money or your life!’. This does not make it\nimpossible for you to refuse to hand over your money, only much less\ndesirable for you to do so. If you decide not to hand over the money,\nyou will suffer the cost of being killed. That will count as\na restriction of your freedom, because it will render physically\nimpossible a great number of actions on your part. But it is not the\nissuing of the threat that creates this unfreedom, and you are not\nunfree until the sanction (described in the threat) is carried out.\nFor this reason, Steiner excludes threats — and with them all\nother kinds of imposed costs — from the set of obstacles that\ncount as freedom-restricting. This conception of freedom derives from\nHobbes (Leviathan, chs. 14 and 21), and its defenders often\ncall it the ‘pure’ negative conception (M. Taylor 1982;\nSteiner 1994; Carter and Kramer 2008) to distinguish it from those\n‘impure’ negative conceptions that make at least minimal\nreferences to the agent's beliefs, desires or values. \nSteiner's account of the relation between freedom and coercive threats\nmight be thought to have counterintuitive implications, even from the\nliberal point of view. Many laws that are normally thought to restrict\nnegative freedom do not physically prevent people from doing what is\nprohibited, but deter them from doing so by threatening punishment.\nAre we to say, then, that these laws do not restrict the negative\nfreedom of those who obey them? A solution to this problem may consist\nin saying that although a law against doing some action, x,\ndoes not remove the freedom to do x, it nevertheless renders\nphysically impossible certain combinations of actions that\ninclude doing x and doing what would be precluded by the\npunishment. There is a restriction of the person's overall\nnegative freedom — i.e. a reduction in the overall number of\nact-combinations available to her — even though she does not\nlose the freedom to do any specific thing taken in isolation (Carter\n1999). \nThe concept of overall freedom appears to play an important role both\nin everyday discourse and in contemporary political philosophy. It is\nonly recently, however, that philosophers have stopped concentrating\nexclusively on the meaning of a particular freedom — the freedom\nto do or become this or that particular thing — and have started\nasking whether we can also make sense of descriptive claims to the\neffect that one person or society is freer than another or of liberal\nnormative claims to the effect that freedom should be maximized or\nthat people should enjoy equal freedom or that they each have a right\nto a certain minimum level of freedom. The literal meaningfulness of\nsuch claims depends on the possibility of gauging degrees of overall\nfreedom, sometimes comparatively, sometimes absolutely. \nTheorists disagree, however, about the importance of the notion of\noverall freedom. For some libertarian and liberal egalitarian\ntheorists, freedom is valuable as such. This suggests that more\nfreedom is better than less (at least ceteris paribus), and\nthat freedom is one of those goods that a liberal society ought to\ndistribute in a certain way among individuals. For other liberal\ntheorists, like Ronald Dworkin (1977, 2011) and the later Rawls\n(1991), freedom is not valuable as such, and all claims about maximal\nor equal freedom ought to be interpreted not as literal references to\na quantitative good called ‘liberty’ but as elliptical\nreferences to the adequacy of lists of certain particular liberties,\nor types of liberties, selected on the basis of values other than\nliberty itself. Generally speaking, only the first group of theorists\nfinds the notion of overall freedom interesting. \nThe theoretical problems involved in measuring overall freedom include\nthat of how an agent's available actions are to be individuated,\ncounted and weighted, and that of comparing and weighting different\ntypes (but not necessarily different sources) of constraints on\nfreedom (such as physical prevention, punishability, threats and\nmanipulation). How are we to make sense of the claim that the number\nof options available to a person has increased? Should all options\ncount for the same in terms of degrees of freedom, or should they be\nweighted according to their importance in terms of other values? In\nthe latter, does the notion of overall freedom really add anything of\nsubstance to the idea that people should be granted those specific\nfreedoms that are valuable? Should the degree of variety among options\nalso count? And how are we to compare the unfreedom created by the\nphysical impossibility of an action with, say, the unfreedom created\nby the difficulty or costliness or punishability of an action? It is\nonly by comparing these different kinds of actions and constraints\nthat we shall be in a position to compare individuals' overall degrees\nof freedom. These problems have been addressed, with differing degrees\nof optimism, not only by political philosophers (Steiner 1983; Carter\n1999; Kramer 2003; Garnett 2016) but also, and increasingly, by social\nchoice theorists interested in finding a freedom-based alternative to\nthe standard utilitarian or ‘welfarist’ framework that has\ntended to dominate their discipline (e.g. Pattanaik and Xu 1991, 1998;\nHees 2000; Sen 2002; Sugden 1998, 2003, 2006; Bavetta 2004; Bavetta\nand Navarra 2012, 2014). \nMacCallum's framework is particularly well suited to the clarification\nof such issues. For this reason, theorists working on the measurement\nof freedom tend not to refer a great deal to the distinction between\npositive and negative freedom. This said, most of them are concerned\nwith freedom understood as the availability of options. And the notion\nof freedom as the availability of options is unequivocally negative in\nBerlin's sense at least where two conditions are met: first, the\nsource of unfreedom-creating constraints is limited to the actions of\nother agents, so that natural or self-inflicted obstacles are not seen\nas decreasing an agent's freedom; second, the actions one is free or\nunfree to perform are weighted in some value-neutral way, so that one\nis not seen as freer simply because the options available to one are\nmore valuable or conducive to one's self-realization. Of the\nabove-mentioned authors, only Steiner embraces both conditions\nexplicitly. Sen rejects both of them, despite not endorsing anything\nlike positive freedom in Berlin's sense. \nWe began with a simple distinction between two concepts of liberty,\nand have progressed from this to the recognition that liberty might be\ndefined in any number of ways, depending on how one interprets the\nthree variables of agent, constraints, and purposes. Despite the\nutility of MacCallum's triadic formula and its strong influence on\nanalytic philosophers, however, Berlin's distinction remains an\nimportant point of reference for discussions about the meaning and\nvalue of political and social freedom. Are these continued references\nto positive and negative freedom philosophically well-founded? \nIt might be claimed that MacCallum's framework is less than wholly\ninclusive of the various possible conceptions of freedom. In\nparticular, it might be said, the concept of self-mastery or\nself-direction implies a presence of control that is not captured by\nMacCallum's explication of freedom as a triadic relation. MacCallum's\ntriadic relation indicates mere possibilities. If one thinks\nof freedom as involving self-direction, on the other hand, one has in\nmind an exercise-concept of freedom as opposed to an\nopportunity-concept (this distinction comes from C. Taylor 1979). If\ninterpreted as an exercise concept, freedom consists not merely in the\npossibility of doing certain things (i.e. in the lack of\nconstraints on doing them), but in actually doing certain\nthings in certain ways — for example, in realizing one's true\nself or in acting on the basis of rational and well-informed\ndecisions. The idea of freedom as the absence of constraints on the\nrealization of given ends might be criticised as failing to capture\nthis exercise concept of freedom, for the latter concept makes no\nreference to the absence of constraints. \nHowever, this defence of the positive-negative distinction as\ncoinciding with the distinction between exercise- and\nopportunity-concepts of freedom has been challenged by Eric Nelson\n(2005). As Nelson points out, most of the theorists that are\ntraditionally located in the positive camp, such as Green or\nBosanquet, do not distinguish between freedom as the absence of\nconstraints and freedom as the doing or becoming of certain things.\nFor these theorists, freedom is the absence of any kind of constraint\nwhatsoever on the realization of one's true self (they adopt a\nmaximally extensive conception of constraints on freedom), and the\nabsence of all factors that could prevent the action\nx is, quite simply, equivalent to the realization of\nx. In other words, if there really is nothing\nstopping me from doing x — if I possess all the means\nto do x, and I have a desire to do x, and no desire,\nirrational or otherwise, not to do x — then I do\nx. An equivalent way to characterize the difference between\nsuch positive theorists and the so-called negative theorists of\nfreedom lies in the degree of specificity with which they describe\nx. For those who adopt a narrow conception of constraints,\nx is described with a low degree of specificity (x\ncould be exemplified by the realization of any of a large array of\noptions); for those who adopt a broad conception of constraints,\nx is described with a high degree of specificity (x\ncan only be exemplified by the realization of a specific option, or of\none of a small group of options). \nWhat perhaps remains of the distinction is a rough categorization of\nthe various interpretations of freedom that serves to indicate their\ndegree of fit with the classical liberal tradition. There is indeed a\ncertain family resemblance between the conceptions that are normally\nseen as falling on one or the other side of Berlin's divide, and one\nof the decisive factors in determining this family resemblance is the\ntheorist's degree of concern with the notion of the self. Those on the\n‘positive’ side see questions about the nature and sources\nof a person's beliefs, desires and values as relevant in determining\nthat person's freedom, whereas those on the ‘negative’\nside, being more faithful to the classical liberal tradition, tend to\nconsider the raising of such questions as in some way indicating a\npropensity to violate the agent's dignity or integrity (Carter 2011a).\nOne side takes a positive interest in the agent's beliefs, desires and\nvalues, while the other recommends that we avoid doing so.
