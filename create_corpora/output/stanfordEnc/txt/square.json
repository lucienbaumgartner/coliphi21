This body of doctrine provided a\nfoundation for work in logic for over two millenia. For most of this\nhistory, logicians assumed that negative particular propositions\n(“Some S is not P”) are vacuously true\nif their subjects are empty. This validates the logical laws embodied\nin the diagram, and preserves the doctrine against modern\ncriticisms. Certain additional principles\n(“contraposition” and “obversion”) were\nsometimes adopted along with the Square, and they genuinely yielded\ninconsistency. By the nineteenth century an inconsistent set of\ndoctrines was widely adopted. Strawson’s 1952 attempt to rehabilitate\nthe Square does not apply to the traditional doctrine; it does salvage\nthe nineteenth century version but at the cost of yielding inferences\nthat lead from truth to falsity when strung together.\n\n\n\n\nThe doctrine of the square of opposition originated with Aristotle in\nthe fourth century BC and has occurred in logic texts ever since.\nAlthough severely criticized in recent decades, it is still regularly\nreferred to. The point of this entry is to trace its history from the\nvantage point of the early twenty-first century, along with closely\nrelated doctrines bearing on empty terms.  \n\nThe square of opposition is a group of theses embodied in a diagram.\nThe diagram is not essential to the theses; it is just a useful way to\nkeep them straight. The theses concern logical relations among four\nlogical forms: \n\nThe diagram for the traditional square of opposition is:  \n\nThe theses embodied in this diagram I call ‘SQUARE’.\nThey are: \n\nSQUARE \n\nThese theses were supplemented with the following explanations:  \n\nProbably nobody before the twentieth century ever held exactly these\nviews without holding certain closely linked ones as well. The most\ncommon closely linked view that is associated with the traditional\ndiagram is that the E and I\npropositions convert simply; that is, ‘No S is\nP’ is equivalent in truth value to ‘No P\nis S’, and ‘Some S is P’\nis equivalent in truth value to ‘Some P is\nS’. The traditional doctrine supplemented with simple\nconversion is a very natural view to discuss. It is Aristotle’s view,\nand it was widely endorsed (or at least not challenged) before the late 19th century. I call this\ntotal body of doctrine ‘[SQUARE]’: \n\nwhere  \n\nSo [SQUARE] includes the relations illustrated in the diagram plus the\nview that ‘No S is P’ is equivalent to\n‘No P is S’, and the view that\n‘Some S is P’ is equivalent to\n‘Some P is S’. \n\nMost contemporary logic texts symbolize the traditional forms as\nfollows: \n\nIf this symbolization is adopted along with standard views about the\nlogic of connectives and quantifiers, the relations embodied in the\ntraditional square mostly disappear. The modern diagram looks like\nthis: \n\n  \n\nThis has too little structure to be particularly useful, and so it\nis not commonly used. According to Alonzo Church, this modern view\nprobably originated sometime in the late nineteenth\n century.[1]\n This representation of the four forms is now generally accepted,\nexcept for qualms about the loss of subalternation in the left-hand\ncolumn. Most English speakers tend to understand ‘Every\nS is P’ as requiring for its truth that there\nbe some Ss, and if that requirement is imposed, then\nsubalternation holds for affirmative propositions.  Every modern logic\ntext must address the apparent implausibility of letting ‘Every\nS is P’ be true when there are no\nSs. The common defense of this is usually that this is a\nlogical notation devised for purposes of logic, and it does not claim\nto capture every nuance of the natural language forms that the symbols\nresemble. So perhaps\n ‘∀x(Sx →\nPx)’ does fail to do complete justice to\nordinary usage of ‘Every S is P’, but\nthis is not a problem with the logic.  If you think that ‘Every\nS is P’ requires for its truth that there be\nSs, then you can have that result simply and easily: just\nrepresent the recalcitrant uses of ‘Every S is\nP’ in symbolic notation by adding an extra conjunct to\nthe symbolization, like this:\n ∀x(Sx\n → Px)\n &\n ∃xSx. \n\nThis defense leaves logic intact and also meets the objection, which\nis not a logical objection, but merely a reservation about the\nrepresentation of natural language. \n\nAuthors typically go on to explain that we often wish to make\ngeneralizations in science when we are unsure of whether or not they\nhave instances, and sometimes even when we know they do not, and they\nsometimes use this as a defense of symbolizing the A\nform so as to allow it to be vacuously true. This is an\nargument from convenience of notation, and does not bear on logical\ncoherence. \n\nWhy does the traditional square need revising at all? The argument\nis a simple\n one:[2] \n\nThe puzzle about this argument is why the doctrine of the\ntraditional square was maintained for well over 20 centuries in the\nface of this consideration. Were 20 centuries of logicians so obtuse as\nnot to have noticed this apparently fatal flaw? Or is there some other\nexplanation? \n\nOne possibility is that logicians previous to the 20th century must\nhave thought that no terms are empty. You see this view referred to\nfrequently as one that others\n held.[3]\n But with a few very\nspecial exceptions (discussed below) I have been unable to find anyone\nwho held such a view before the nineteenth century. Many authors do not\ndiscuss empty terms, but those who do typically take their presence for\ngranted. Explicitly rejecting empty terms was never a mainstream\noption, even in the nineteenth century. \n\nAnother possibility is that the particular I form\nmight be true when its subject is empty.  This was a common view\nconcerning indefinite propositions when they are read\ngenerically, such as ‘A dodo is a bird’, which (arguably)\ncan be true now without there being any dodos now, because being a\nbird is part of the essence of being a dodo.  But the truth of such\nindefinite propositions with empty subjects does not bear on the forms\nof propositions that occur in the square.  For although the indefinite\n‘A dodo ate my lunch’ might be held to be equivalent to\nthe particular proposition ‘Some dodo ate my lunch’,\ngeneric indefinites like ‘A dodo is a bird’, are quite\ndifferent, and their semantics does not bear on the quantified\nsentences in the square of opposition.  \nIn fact, the traditional doctrine of [SQUARE] is completely coherent\nin the presence of empty terms. This is because on the traditional\ninterpretation, the O form lacks existential\nimport. The O form is (vacuously) true if its subject\nterm is empty, not false, and thus the logical interrelations of\n[SQUARE] are unobjectionable. In what follows, I trace the development\nof this view. \n The doctrine that I call [SQUARE], occurs in Aristotle. It\nbegins in De Interpretatione 6–7, which contains three\nclaims: that A and O are\ncontradictories, that E and I are\ncontradictories, and that A and E\nare contraries (17b.17–26): \n This gives us the following fragment of the square:  \n\nBut the rest is there by implication. For example, there is enough to\nshow that I and O are subcontraries:\nthey cannot both be false. For suppose that I is\nfalse. Then its contradictory, E, is true. So\nE’s contrary, A, is false. So\nA’s contradictory, O, is true. This\nrefutes the possibility that I and O\nare both false, and thus fills in the bottom relation of\nsubcontraries. Subalternation also follows. Suppose that the\nA form is true. Then its contrary E\nform must be false. But then the E form’s\ncontradictory, I, must be true. Thus if the\nA form is true, so must be the I\nform. A parallel argument establishes subalternation from\nE to O as well. The result is\nSQUARE. \n\nIn Prior Analytics I.2, 25a.1–25 we get the additional\nclaims that the E and I propositions\nconvert simply. Putting this together with the doctrine of De\nInterpretatione we have the full\n [SQUARE].[4] \n\nThe diagram accompanying and illustrating the doctrine shows up\nalready in the second century CE; Boethius incorporated it into his\nwriting, and it passed down through the dark ages to the high medieval\nperiod, and from thence to today. Diagrams of this sort were popular\namong late classical and medieval authors, who used them for a variety\nof purposes. (Similar diagrams for modal propositions were especially\npopular.) \n\nAckrill’s translation contains something a bit unexpected: Aristotle’s\narticulation of the O form is not the\nfamiliar ‘Some S is not P’ or one of its\nvariants; it is rather ‘Not every S is\nP’. With this wording, Aristotle’s doctrine\nautomatically escapes the modern criticism. (This holds for his views\nthroughout De\n Interpretatione.[5])\n For assume again that ‘S’ is an empty term, and\nsuppose that this makes the I form ‘Some\nS is P’ false. Its contradictory, the\nE form: ‘No S is P’, is\nthus true, and this entails the O form in Aristotle’s\nformulation: ‘Not every S is P’, which\nmust therefore be true. When the O form was worded\n‘Some S is not P’ this bothered us, but\nwith it worded ‘Not every S is P’ it\nseems plainly right. Recall that we are granting that ‘Every\nS is P’ has existential import, and so if\n‘S’ is empty the A form must be\nfalse. But then ‘Not every S is P’\nshould be true, as Aristotle’s square requires. \n\nOn this view affirmatives have existential import, and\nnegatives do not—a point that became elevated to a general\nprinciple in late medieval\n times.[6]\n The ancients thus did\nnot see the incoherence of the square as formulated by Aristotle\nbecause there was no incoherence to see. \n\nAristotle’s work was made available to the Latin west principally via\nBoethius’s translations and commentaries, written a bit after 500\nCE. In his translation of De interpretatione, Boethius\npreserves Aristotle’s wording of the O form as “Not\nevery man is white.” But when Boethius comments on this text he\nillustrates Aristotle’s doctrine with the now-famous diagram, and he\nuses the wording ‘Some man is not\n just’.[7]\n So this must have seemed\nto him to be a natural equivalent in Latin. It looks odd to us in\nEnglish, but he wasn’t bothered by it. \n\nEarly in the twelfth century Abelard objected to Boethius’s\nwording of the O\n form,[8]\n but Abelard’s writing was not widely influential, and except for him\nand some of his followers people regularly used ‘Some S\nis not P’ for the O form in the\ndiagram that represents the square. Did they allow the\nO form to be vacuously true? Perhaps we can get some\nclues to how medieval writers interpreted these forms by looking at\nother doctrines they endorsed.  These are the theory of the syllogism\nand the doctrines of contraposition and obversion. \n\nOne central concern of the Aristotelian tradition in logic is the\ntheory of the categorical syllogism. This is the theory of\ntwo-premised arguments in which the premises and conclusion share\nthree terms among them, with each proposition containing two of\nthem. It is distinctive of this enterprise that everybody agrees on\nwhich syllogisms are valid.  The theory of the syllogism partly\nconstrains the interpretation of the forms. For example, it determines\nthat the A form has existential import, at least if\nthe I form does. For one of the valid patterns (Darapti) is: \n\nThis is invalid if the A form lacks existential\nimport, and valid if it has existential import. It is held to be\nvalid, and so we know how the A form is to be\ninterpreted. One then naturally asks about the O\nform; what do the syllogisms tell us about it? The answer is that they\ntell us nothing.  This is because Aristotle did not discuss weakened\nforms of syllogisms, in which one concludes a particular proposition\nwhen one could already conclude the coresponding universal.  For\nexample, he does not mention the form: \n\nIf people had thoughtfully taken sides for or against the validity of\nthis form, that would clearly be relevant to the understanding of\nthe O form.  But the weakened forms were typically\nignored. \n\nOne other piece of subject-matter bears on the interpretation of the O\nform. People were interested in Aristotle’s discussion of “infinite”\n negation,[9]\n which is the use of negation to form a term from a term instead of a\nproposition from a proposition. In modern English we use “non” for\nthis; we make “non-horse,” which is true of exactly those things that\nare not horses. In medieval Latin “non” and “not” are the same word,\nand so the distinction required special discussion.  It became common\nto use infinite negation, and logicians pondered its logic. Some\nwriters in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries adopted a principle\ncalled “conversion by contraposition.” It states that \n\nUnfortunately, this principle (which is not endorsed by\n Aristotle[10])\n conflicts with the idea that there may be empty or universal\nterms. For in the universal case it leads directly from the truth: \n\nto the falsehood:  \n\n(which is false because the universal affirmative has existential\nimport, and there are no non-beings). And in the particular case it\nleads from the truth (remember that the O form has no\nexistential import): \n\nto the falsehood:  \n\nThese are Buridan’s examples, used in the fourteenth century to show\nthe invalidity of contraposition. Unfortunately, by Buridan’s time the\nprinciple of contraposition had been advocated by a number of authors.\nThe doctrine is already present in several twelfth century\n tracts,[11]\n and it is endorsed in the thirteenth\ncentury by Peter of\n Spain,[12]\n whose work was republished for centuries,\nby William\n Sherwood,[13]\nand by Roger Bacon.[14]\n By the fourteenth century, problems\nassociated with contraposition seem to be well-known, and authors\ngenerally cite the principle and note that it is not valid, but that it\nbecomes valid with an additional assumption of existence of things\nfalling under the subject term. For example, Paul of Venice in his\neclectic and widely published Logica Parva from the end of the\nfourteenth century gives the traditional square with simple\n conversion[15]\n but rejects conversion by contraposition,\nessentially for Buridan’s reason.  \n\nA similar thing happened with the principle of obversion. This is\nthe principle that states that you can change a proposition from\naffirmative to negative, or vice versa, if you change the predicate\nterm from finite to infinite (or infinite to finite). Some examples\nare: \n\nAristotle discussed some instances of obversion in De\nInterpretatione. It is apparent, given the truth conditions for\nthe forms, that these inferences are valid when moving from affirmative\nto negative, but not in the reverse direction when the terms may be\nempty, as Buridan makes\n clear.[16]\n Some medieval writers\nbefore Buridan accepted the fallacious versions, and some did\n not.[17] \n\nIn Paul of Venice’s other major work, the Logica Magna\n(circa 1400), he gives some pertinent examples of particular\nnegative propositions that follow from true universal negatives. His\nexamples of true particular negatives with patently empty subject terms\nare\n these:[18] \n\nWhat is different from being is not. \n\nSome thing willed against by a chimera is not willed against by\na chimera. \n\nA chimera does not exist. \n\nSome man whom a donkey has begotten is not his son. \n\nSo by the end of the 14th century the issue of empty terms was\nclearly recognized. They were permitted in the theory, the\nO form definitely did not have existential import,\nand the logical theory, stripped of the incorrect special cases of\ncontraposition and obversion, was coherent and immune to 20th century\ncriticism. \n\nThe fact that universal affirmatives with empty subject terms are\nfalse runs into a problem with Aristotelian scientific theory.\nAristotle held that ‘Every human is an animal’ is a\nnecessary truth.  If so, it is true at every time.  So at every time\nits subject is non-empty.  And so there are humans at every time.  But\nthe dominant theology held that before the last day of creation there\nwere no humans.  So there is a contradiction. \nOckham avoids this problem by abandoning parts of Aristotle’s theory: \nThe contradiction might also vanish if propositions in scientific\ntheory have unusual meanings.  One option is that universal\naffirmatives are understood in scientific theory as universalized\nconditionals, as they are understood today.  This would not interfere\nwith the fact that they are not conditionals in uses outside of\nscientific theory.  Although De Rijk (1973, 52) states that Ockham\nholds such a view, he seems to explicitly reject it, stating that\n‘A human is a rational animal’ is not equivalent to\n‘If a human is then a human is a rational animal “because\nthis is a conditional and not a categorical”. [Ockham SL\nII.11] \nBuridan’s view is neater.  He holds that when engaged in\nscientific theory, the subject matter is not limited to presently\nexisting things.  Instead, the propositions have their usual meanings,\nbut an expanded subject matter.  When the word ‘human’ is\nused, one is discussing every human, past and future, and even\npossible humans. [Buridan SdD 4.3.4] With such an understanding, the\nsubject of ‘Every human is an animal’ is not empty at\nall. \nWork on logic continued for the next couple of centuries, though\nmost of it was lost and had little influence. But the topic of empty\nterms was squarely faced, and solutions that were given within the\nMedieval tradition were consistent with [SQUARE]. I rely here on\nAshworth 1974, 201–02, who reports the most common themes in the\ncontext of post-medieval discussions of contraposition. One theme is\nthat contraposition is invalid when applied to universal or empty\nterms, for the sorts of reasons given by Buridan. The O form is\nexplicitly held to lack existential import. A second theme, which\nAshworth says was the most usual thing to say, is also found in\nBuridan: additional inferences, such as contraposition, become valid\nwhen supplemented by an additional premise asserting that the terms in\nquestion are non-empty. \n\nThere is one odd view that occurs at least twice, which may have as a\nconsequence that there are no empty terms. In the thirteenth century,\nLambert of Lagny (sometimes identified as Lambert of Auxerre) proposed\nthat a term such as ‘chimera’ which stands for no existing\nthing must “revert to nonexistent things.” So if we\nsuppose that no roses exist, then the term ‘rose’ stands\nfor nonexistent\n things.[19] \n A related view also occurs much later;\nAshworth reports that Menghus Blanchellus Faventinus held that\nnegative terms such as ‘nonman’ are true of non-beings,\nand he concluded from this that ‘A nonman is a chimera’ is\ntrue (apparently assuming that ‘chimera’ is also true of\nnonbeings).[20]\nHowever, neither of these views seems to have been clearly developed,\nand neither was widely\n adopted.[21]\n Nor is it clear that either of them is\nsupposed to have the consequence that there are no empty terms. \n\nAccording to\n Ashworth,[22]\n serious and sophisticated investigation of logic ended at about the\nthird decade of the sixteenth century. The Port Royal Logic\nof the following (seventeenth) century seems typical in its approach:\nits authors frequently suggest that logic is trivial and\nunimportant. Its doctrine includes that of the square of opposition,\nbut the discussion of the O form is so vague that\nnobody could pin down its exact truth conditions, and there is\ncertainly no awareness indicated of problems of existential\nimport, in spite of the fact that the authors state that\nthe E form entails the O form (4th\ncorollary of chapter 3 of part 3). This seems to typify popular texts\nfor the next while. In the nineteenth century, the apparently most\nwidely used textbook in Britain and America was Whately’s Elements\nof Logic. Whately gives the traditional doctrine of the square,\nwithout any discussion of issues of existential import or of empty\nterms. He includes the problematic principles of contraposition (which\nhe calls “conversion by negation”): \n\nHe also endorses\n obversion:[23] \n\nHe says that this principle is “not found in Aldrich,” but that it is\n“in frequent\n use.”[24]\n This “frequent use” continued; later\nnineteenth and early twentieth century text books in England and\nAmerica continued to endorse obversion (also called “infinitation” or\n“permutation”), and contraposition (also called “illative\n conversion”).[25]\n This full nineteenth century tradition is consistent only on the\nassumption that empty (and universal) terms are prohibited, but\nauthors seem unaware of this; Keynes 1928, 126, says generously “This\nassumption appears to have been made implicitly in the traditional\ntreatment of logic.” De Morgan is atypical in making the assumption\nexplicit: in his 1847 text (p. 64) he forbids universal terms (empty\nterms disappear by implication because if A is empty,\nnon-A will be universal), but later in the same text (p. 111) he\njustifies ignoring empty terms by treating this as an idealization, adopted\nbecause not all of his readers are\n mathmeticians.[26] \nIn the twentieth century Łukasiewicz also developed a version\nof syllogistic that depends explicitly on the absence of empty terms;\nhe attributed the system to Aristotle, thus helping to foster the\ntradition according to which the ancients were unaware of empty\nterms. \n\nToday, logic texts divide between those based on contemporary logic\nand those from the Aristotelian tradition or the nineteenth century\ntradition, but even many texts that teach syllogistic teach it with the\nforms interpreted in the modern way, so that e.g. subalternation is\nlost. So the traditional square, as traditionally interpreted, is now\nmostly abandoned. \n\nIn the twentieth century there were many creative uses of logical\ntools and techniques in reassessing past doctrines. One might\nnaturally wonder if there is some ingenious interpretation of the\nsquare that attributes existential import to the O\nform and makes sense of it all without forbidding empty or\nuniversal terms, thus reconciling traditional doctrine with modern\nviews. Peter Geach, 1970, 62–64, shows that this can be done\nusing an unnatural interpretation. Peter Strawson, 1952, 176–78,\nhad a more ambitious goal. Strawson’s idea was to justify the square\nby adopting a nonclassical view of truth of statements, and by\nredefining the logical relation of validity. First, he suggested, we\nneed to suppose that a proposition whose subject term is empty is\nneither true nor false, but lacks truth value altogether.  Then we say\nthat Q entails R just in case there are no instances\nof Q and R such that the instance of Q is\ntrue and the instance of R is false. For example, the\nA form ‘Every S is P’\nentails the I form ‘Some S is\nP’ because there is no instance of the\nA form that is true when the corresponding instance\nof the I form is false. The troublesome cases\ninvolving empty terms turn out to be instances in which one or both\nforms lack truth value, and these are irrelevant so far as entailment\nis concerned. With this revised account of entailment, all of the\n“traditional” logical relations result, if they are worded as follows: \n\nThese doctrines are not, however, the doctrines of [SQUARE]. The\ndoctrines of [SQUARE] are worded entirely in terms of the possibilities\nof truth values, not in terms of entailment. So “entailment” is\nirrelevant to [SQUARE]. It turns out that Strawson’s revision of truth\nconditions does preserve the principles of SQUARE (these can\neasily be checked by\n cases),[27]\n but not the additional conversion principles of [SQUARE], and also\nnot the traditional principles of contraposition or obversion. For\nexample, Strawson’s reinterpreted version of conversion holds for the\nI form because any I form\nproposition entails its own converse: if ‘Some A is\nB’ and ‘Some B is A’ both\nhave truth value, then neither has an empty subject term, and so if\nneither lack truth value and if either is true the other will be true\nas well. But the original doctrine of conversion says that an\nI form and its converse always have the same truth value, and\nthat is false on Strawson’s account; if there are As but no\nBs, then ‘Some A is B’ is false\nand ‘Some B is A’ has no truth value at\nall. Similar results follow for contraposition and obversion. \n\nThe “traditional logic” that Strawson discusses is much closer to\nthat of nineteenth century logic texts than it is to the version that\nheld sway for two millennia before\n that.[28]\n But even though he\nliterally salvages a version of nineteenth century logic, the view he\nsaves is unable to serve the purposes for which logical principles are\nformulated, as was pointed out by Timothy Smiley in a short note in\nMind in\n 1967.[29]\n People have always taken the square to\nembody principles by which one can reason, and by which one can\nconstruct extended chains of reasoning. But if you string together\nStrawson’s entailments you can infer falsehoods from truths, something\nthat nobody in any tradition would consider legitimate. For example,\nbegin with this truth (the subject term is non-empty): \n\nBy conversion, we get:  \n\nBy obversion:  \n\nBy subalternation:  \n\nBy conversion:  \n\nSince there are non-men, the conclusion is not truth-valueless, and\nsince there are no chimeras it is false. Thus we have passed from a\ntrue claim to a false one. (The example does not even involve the\nproblematic O form.) All steps are validated by\nStrawson’s doctrine. So Strawson reaches his goal of preserving\ncertain patterns commonly identified as constituting traditional\nlogic, but at the cost of sacrificing the application of logic to\nextended reasoning.","contact.mail":"tparsons@ucla.edu","contact.domain":"ucla.edu"}]
