Compatibilism is the thesis that free will is\ncompatible with determinism. Because free will is typically taken to\nbe a necessary condition of moral responsibility, compatibilism is\nsometimes expressed as a thesis about the compatibility between moral\nresponsibility and determinism.\n\nCompatibilism emerges as a response to a problem posed by causal\ndeterminism. But what problem is that? Well, suppose, as the thesis of\ncausal determinism tells us, that everything that occurs is the\ninevitable result of the laws of nature and the state of the world in\nthe distant past. If this is the case, then everything human agents do\nflows from the laws of nature and the way the world was in the distant\npast. But if what we do is simply the consequence of the laws of\nnature and the state of the world in the distant past—then we\ncannot do anything other than what we ultimately do. Nor are we in any\nmeaningful sense the ultimate causal source of our actions, since they\nhave their causal origins in the laws of nature and the state of the\nworld long ago. Determinism therefore seems to prevent human agents\nfrom having the freedom to do otherwise, and it also seems to prevent\nthem from being the sources of their actions. If either of these is\ntrue, then it’s doubtful that human agents are free or\nresponsible for their actions in any meaningful sense.  \nThese lines of argument, which have been regimented in the work of\nGinet (1966), van Inwagen (1975, 1983), Wisdom (1934), Mele (1995),\nand Pereboom (1995, 2001), among many others, present a real problem\nfor those who are inclined to think that we are free and responsible\nfor our choices and actions and that the natural world might operate\nas a deterministic system (or if not completely deterministic, one in\nwhich an indeterminism is merely stochastic noise that is causally\nirrelevant at the level of human agency). How to respond to such\narguments? On the one hand, incompatibilists accept (some\nversion of at least one of) these arguments and so insist that our\nself-conception as free and responsible agents would be seriously\nmisguided if causal determinism turns out to be true. Some\nincompatibilists argue for these conclusions indirectly—first by\narguing that determinism precludes freedom or control and then second\nby arguing that such freedom is necessary for moral responsibility.\nOther incompatibilists argue directly that causal determinism\nprecludes moral responsibility. \nCompatibilists, on the other hand, claim that these concerns miss the\nmark. Some compatibilists hold this because they think the truth of\ncausal determinism would not undermine our freedom to do otherwise\n(Berofsky 1987, Campbell 1997, Vihvelin 2013, etc.). As a result,\nthese compatibilists tell us, the truth of causal determinism poses no\nthreat to our status as morally responsible agents (notice the\nenthymematic premise here: the freedom to do otherwise is sufficient\nfor the kind of control an agent must possess to be morally\nresponsible for her actions). Other compatibilists show less concern\nin rebutting the conclusion that the freedom to do otherwise is\nincompatible with determinism. Compatibilists of this stripe reject\nthe idea that such freedom is necessary for meaningful forms of free\nwill (e.g., Frankfurt 1969, 1971; Watson 1975, Dennett 1984)—the\n“varieties of free will worth wanting,” (Dennett\n1984). And even more notably, some compatibilists simply deny that\nfreedom of this sort is in any way connected to morally responsible\nagency (e.g., Fischer 1994, Fischer & Ravizza 1998, Scanlon 1998,\nWallace 1994, Sartorio 2016). What we see here is not a unified front\nin the face of the incompatibilist challenge(s).  Instead,\ncompatibilists have been careful to identify the precise elements of\nincompatibilists’ arguments that they take to be erroneous, and\nthen build their respective theories of freedom and responsibility\nwith that in mind.  \nTo help better situate compatibilist theories, we will now consider in\nmore detail the arguments that incompatibilists have advanced on\nbehalf of their own theories, since it is these arguments that have\nshaped the contours of compatibilist theories. As we mentioned above,\nthe truth of causal determinism apparently poses a problem for freedom\nand responsibility in at least two ways. First, it might entail that\nno one has the freedom to do otherwise, which is a kind of\npower or control over one’s actions that many have regarded as\nnecessary for moral responsibility. Second, it might entail that no\none is the ultimate causal source of his or her actions. That our\nactions originate in our free will and not in forces outside of us\nalso seems like a plausible condition on morally responsible agency.\nWe take each of these potential threats in turn. \nA natural way to think of an agent’s control over her conduct at\na moment in time is in terms of her ability to select among, or choose\nbetween, alternative courses of action. This picture of control stems\nfrom common features of our perspectives as practical deliberators\nsettling on courses of action. If a person is choosing between voting\nfor Clinton as opposed to Trump, it is plausible to assume that her\nfreedom with regard to her voting consists, at least partially, in her\nability to choose between these two alternatives. On this account,\nacting with free will requires alternative possibilities. A\nnatural way to model this account of free will is in terms of an\nagent’s future as a garden of forking paths branching off from a\nsingle past. A locus of freely willed action arises when the present\noffers, from an agent’s (singular) past, more than one path into\nthe future. On this model of human agency, then, when a person acts of\nher own free will, she could have acted otherwise. \nThis conception of free will immediately invites the thought that\ndeterminism might be a threat. For determinism, understood in the\nstrict sense characterized above, tells us that, at any time, given\nthe facts of the past and the laws of nature, only one future\nis possible. But according to the conception of human agency under\nconsideration, a freely willing agent could have acted other than she\ndid and, hence, that more than one future is possible. \nHere is an incompatibilist argument that codifies the considerations\nset out above: \nFor ease of reference and discussion throughout this entry, let us\nsimplify the above argument as follows: \nCall this simplified argument the Classical Incompatibilist\nArgument. According to the argument, if determinism is true, no\none has access to alternatives of the sort you might plausibly think\nto be required for free will. \nThere is a second conception of the sort of control that might be\nnecessary for morally responsible agency. This conception starts with\nthe observation that an agent’s control seems to consist in her\nplaying a crucial role in the production of her actions. Think in\nterms of the transparent difference between those events that are\nproducts of one’s agency and those that are merely\nbodily happenings. For instance, consider the choice to pick up a cup\nof coffee as opposed to the event of one’s heart beating or\none’s blood circulating. In the latter cases, one recognizes\nevents happening to one; in the former, one is the source and producer\nof that happening. On this model of human agency, control is\nunderstood in terms of being the source of one’s actions. \nFixing just upon this conception of agency, how might determinism pose\na threat to free will? If determinism is true, then what happened in\nthe distant past, when combined with the laws of nature, is causally\nsufficient for the production of every human action. But if this is\nso, then, while it might be true that an agent herself is crucially\ninvolved in the production of her action, that action actually has its\nsource in causal antecedent that originate outside of her.\nHence, she, as an agent, is not the ultimate source of her\nactions. \nWhat is meant here by an ultimate source, and not just a source? An\nagent is an ultimate source of her action only if, at the very least,\nsomething necessary for her action originates within the agent\nherself. It cannot be located in places and times prior to the\nagent’s freely willing her action. If an agent is not the\nultimate source of her actions, then her actions do not originate in\nher, and if her actions are the outcomes of conditions guaranteeing\nthem, how can she be said to control them? The conditions sufficient\nfor their occurrence were already in place long before she even\nexisted! \nHere is an incompatibilist argument that codifies the considerations\nset out above: \nFor ease of reference and discussion throughout this entry, let us\nsimplify the above argument as follows: \nCall this simplified argument the Source Incompatibilist\nArgument. It is important to see that the demand for alternative\npossibilities is not (at least not obviously) relevant to this\nincompatibilist argument. Suppose that a putatively freely willing\nagent had access to the relevant sort of alternative possibilities.\nAccording to the Source Incompatibilist Argument, a further\ncondition is that she must have been the ultimate source of her freely\nwilled actions. That is, the sourcehood theorist denies that\nalternative possibilities are enough to guarantee freedom. \nIn response to these arguments, compatibilists have denied that\nfreedom requires the ability to do otherwise; that causal determinism\nprecludes the ability to do otherwise; and that freedom or control\nrequire sourcehood. [Compatibilists have only rarely denied Premise 2\nof the Source Incompatibilist Argument (McKenna 2008 and\nperhaps Bjornsson & Persson 2012 are important exceptions.] But\ncompatibilists’s denials of these premises have not been\nflatfooted. Instead they are grounded in attractive conceptions of\nhuman agency. So in what follows, we’ll turn to the details of\nsuch theories, and in so doing, uncover just how distinct\ncompatibilist theories answer the incompatibilist arguments set out\nabove.  \nCompatibilism’s place in contemporary philosophy has developed\nin at least three stages. The first stage involves the classical form\nof compatibilism, which was developed in the modern era by the\nempiricists Hobbes and Hume, and reinvigorated in the early part of\nthe twentieth century. The second stage involves three distinct\ncontributions in the 1960s, contributions that challenged many of the\ndialectical presuppositions driving classical compatibilism. The third\nstage involves various contemporary forms of compatibilism, forms that\ndiverge from the classical variety and that emerged out of, or\nresonate with, at least one of the three contributions found in the\nsecond transitional stage. This section is devoted to the first stage,\nthat of classical compatibilism. \nAccording to one strand within classical compatibilism, freedom is\nnothing more than an agent’s ability to do what she wishes in\nthe absence of impediments that would otherwise stand in her way. For\ninstance, Hobbes offers an exemplary expression of classical\ncompatibilism when he claims that a person’s freedom consists in\nhis finding “no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or\ninclination to doe [sic]” (Leviathan, p.108). On\nthis view, freedom involves two components, a positive and a negative\none. The positive component (doing what one wills, desires, or\ninclines to do) consists in nothing more than what is involved in the\npower of agency. The negative component (finding “no\nstop”) consists in acting unencumbered or unimpeded. Typically,\nthe classical compatibilists’ benchmark of impeded or encumbered\naction is compelled action. Compelled action arises when one is forced\nby some external source to act contrary to one’s will. \nFor the classical compatibilist, then, free will is an ability to do\nwhat one wants. It is therefore plausible to conclude that the truth\nof determinism does not entail that agents lack free will since it\ndoes not entail that agents never do what they wish to do, nor that\nagents are necessarily encumbered in acting. Compatibilism is thus\nvindicated. \nBut how convincing is the classical compatibilist account of free\nwill? As it stands, it cries out for refinement. To cite just one\nshortcoming, various mental illnesses can cause a person to act as she\nwants and do so unencumbered; yet, intuitively, it would seem that she\ndoes not act of her own free will. For example, imagine a person\nsuffering from a form of psychosis that causes full-fledged\nhallucinations. While hallucinating, she might “act as she wants\nunencumbered,” but she could hardly be said to be acting of her\nown free will. Consequently, the classical compatibilist owes us more.\nTo see how it might be supplemented, we turn to a distinctively\nincompatibilist way of undermining classical compatibilism \nConsider the following incompatibilist objection to the classical\ncompatibilist account of free will: \nIf determinism is true, and if at any given time, an unimpeded agent\nis completely determined to have the wants that she does have, and if\nthose wants causally determine her actions, then, even though she does\ndo what she wants to do, she cannot ever do otherwise. She\nsatisfies the classical compatibilist conditions for free will. But\nfree will requires the ability to do otherwise, and determinism is\nincompatible with this. Hence, the classical compatibilist account of\nfree will is inadequate. Determinism is incompatible with free will\nand moral responsibility because determinism is incompatible with the\nability to do otherwise. \nThe classical compatibilist account of freedom set out thus far can be\nthought of as accounting for one-way freedom, which fixes\nonly on what a person does do, not on what alternatives she had to\nwhat she did. The incompatibilist challenge at issue here is that such\nfreedom, even if necessary, is insufficient in the absence of a\nfurther freedom to do other than as one does.  \nClassical compatibilists have responded by arguing that determinism\nis compatible with the ability to do otherwise. To show this,\nthey attempted to analyze an agent’s ability to do otherwise in\nconditional terms (e.g., Hume, Enquiry Concerning Human\nUnderstanding, p.73; Ayer 1954; or Hobart 1934). Since\ndeterminism is a thesis about what must happen in the future given\nthe actual past, determinism is consistent with the future being\ndifferent given a different past. So the classical\ncompatibilists analyzed any assertion that an agent could have done\notherwise as a conditional assertion reporting what an agent would\nhave done under certain counterfactual conditions. These conditions\ninvolved variations on what a freely willing agent wanted (chose,\nwilled, or decided) to do at the time of her freely willed action.\nSuppose that an agent freely willed X. According to the\nclassical compatibilist conditional analysis, to say that, at\nthe time of acting, she could have done Y and not X\nis just to say that, had she wanted (chosen, willed, or\ndecided) to do Y and not X at that time,\nthen she would have done Y and not done X.\nHer ability to have done otherwise at the time at which she acted\nconsisted in some such counterfactual truth. \nBut given that a determined agent is determined at the time of action\nto have the wants that she does have, how is it helpful to state what\nshe would have done had she had different wants than the wants that\nshe did have? Assuming the truth of determinism, at the time at which\nshe acted she could have had no other wants than the wants that her\ncausal history determined her to have.  \nIn response, the classical compatibilist holds that that the\nconditional analysis brings into relief a rich picture of freedom. In\nassessing an agent’s action, the analysis accurately\ndistinguishes those actions she would have performed if she wanted,\nfrom those actions she could not have performed even if she wanted.\nThis, the classical compatibilist held, effectively distinguishes\nthose alternative courses of action that were within the scope of the\nagent’s abilities at the time of action, from those courses of\naction that were not. This just is the distinction between what an\nagent was free to do and what she was not free to do. This is not at\nall a superficial freedom; it demarcates what persons have within\ntheir control from what falls outside that purview. \nDespite the classical compatibilists’ ingenuity, their analysis\nof could have done otherwise failed decisively. The classical\ncompatibilists wanted to show their incompatibilist interlocutors that\nwhen one asserted that a freely willing agent had alternatives\navailable to her—that is, when it was asserted that she could\nhave done otherwise—that assertion could be analyzed as a\nconditional statement, a statement that is perspicuously compatible\nwith determinism. But as it turned out, the analysis was refuted when\nit was shown that the conditional statements sometimes yielded the\nimproper result that a person was able to do otherwise even though it\nwas clear that at the time the person acted, she had no such\nalternative and therefore was not able to do otherwise in the\npertinent sense (Chisholm 1964, in Watson (ed.) 1982, pp.26–7;\nor van Inwagen 1983, pp. 114–9). Here is such an example: \nSuppose that Danielle is psychologically incapable of wanting to touch\na blond haired dog. Imagine that, on her sixteenth birthday, unaware\nof her condition, her father brings her two puppies to choose between,\none being a blond haired Lab, the other a black haired Lab. He tells\nDanielle just to pick up whichever of the two she pleases and that he\nwill return the other puppy to the pet store. Danielle happily, and\nunencumbered, does what she wants and picks up the black Lab. \nWhen Danielle picked up the black Lab, was she able to pick up the\nblond Lab? It seems not. Picking up the blond Lab was an alternative\nthat was not available to her. In this respect, she could not have\ndone otherwise. Given her psychological condition, she cannot\neven form a want to touch a blond Lab, hence she could not pick one\nup. But notice that, if she wanted to pick up the blond Lab,\nthen she would have done so. Of course, if she wanted to pick\nup the blond Lab, then she would not suffer from the very\npsychological disorder that causes her to be unable to pick up blond\nhaired doggies. The classical compatibilist analysis of ‘could\nhave done otherwise’ thus fails. According to the analysis, when\nDanielle picked up the black Lab, she was able to pick up the\nblonde Lab, even though, due to her psychological condition, she\nwas not able to do so in the relevant respect. Hence, the\nanalysis yields the wrong result. \nSo even if an unencumbered agent does what she wants, if she is\ndetermined, at least as the incompatibilist maintains, she could not\nhave done otherwise. Since, as the objection goes, freedom of will\nrequires freedom involving alternative possibilities, classical\ncompatibilist freedom falls. \nThe classical compatibilists failed to answer the Classical\nIncompatibilist Argument. What they attempted to do by way of the\nconditional analysis was deny the claim that if determinism is true,\nno one can do otherwise. But, given their failure, it was incumbent\nupon them to respond to the argument in some manner. It is only\ndialectically fair to acknowledge that determinism does pose a\nprima facie threat to free will when free will is understood\nas requiring the ability to do otherwise. The Classical\nIncompatibilist Argument is merely a codification of this natural\nthought. In light of the failure of the classical\ncompatibilists’ conditional analysis, the burden of proof rests\nsquarely on the compatibilists. How can the freedom to do otherwise be\nreconciled with determinism? As we’ll see below, contemporary\ncompatibilists attempt to speak to this issue. \nIn the 1960s, three major contributions to the free will debate\nradically altered it. One was an incompatibilist argument that put\ncrisply the intuition that a determined agent lacks control over\nalternatives. This argument, first developed by Carl Ginet, came to be\nknown as the Consequence Argument (Ginet 1966). Another\ncontribution was Harry Frankfurt’s argument against the\nPrinciple of Alternative Possibilities (PAP), a principle\nstating that an agent is morally responsible for what she does only if\nshe can do otherwise (Frankfurt 1969). Finally, P.F. Strawson\ndefended compatibilism by inviting both compatibilists and\nincompatibilists to attend more carefully to the central role of\ninterpersonal relationships and the reactive attitudes in\nunderstanding the concept of moral responsibility (Strawson 1962).\nEach of these contributions changed dramatically the way that the free\nwill problem is addressed in contemporary discussions. No account of\nfree will, compatibilist or incompatibilist, is advanced today without\ntaking into account at least one (if not more) of these three\npieces. \nThis argument invokes a compelling pattern of inference (one that is\nperhaps lurking in the background of the Classical Incompatibilist\nArgument) regarding claims about what is power necessary for\na person. Power necessity, as applied to true propositions (or facts),\nconcerns what is not within a person’s power. Or, put\ndifferently, it concerns facts that a person does not have power over.\nTo say that a person does not have power over a fact is to say\nthat she cannot act in such a way that the fact would not obtain.\nTo illustrate, no person has power over the truths of mathematics.\nThat is, no person can act in such a way that the truths of\nmathematics would be false. Hence, the truths of mathematics are, for\nany person, power necessities. \nThe intuitive pattern of inference applied to these claims is this. If\na person has no power over a certain fact, and if she also has no\npower over the further fact that the original fact has some other fact\nas a consequence, then she also has no power over the consequent fact.\nPowerlessness, it seems, transfers from one fact to its consequences.\nFor example, if poker-playing Diamond Jim, who is holding only two\npairs, has no power over the fact that Calamity Sam draws a straight\nflush, and if a straight flush beats two pairs (and assuming Jim has\nno power to alter this fact), then it follows that Jim has no power\nover the fact that Sam’s hand beats Jim’s. This general\npattern of inference is applied to the thesis of causal determinism to\nyield a powerful argument for incompatibilism. The argument requires\nthe assumption that determinism is true, and that the facts of the\npast and the laws of nature are fixed. Given these assumptions, here\nis a rough, non-technical sketch of the argument: \nAccording to the Consequence Argument, if determinism is\ntrue, it appears that no person has any power to alter how her own\nfuture will unfold. \nThis argument shook compatibilists, and rightly so. The classical\ncompatibilists’ failure to analyze statements of an\nagent’s abilities in terms of counterfactual conditionals left\nthe compatibilists with no perspicuous retort to the crucial second\npremise of the Classical Incompatibilist Argument. And the Consequence\nArgument provides powerful support for this argument’s second\npremise. If, according to the Argument, determinism implies that the\nfuture will unfold in only one way given the past and the laws, and if\nno one has any power to alter its unfolding in that particular way,\nthen it seems that no one can do other than she does. \nIt is fair to say that the Consequence Argument earned the\nincompatibilists an important dialectical advantage. Compatibilists\nowe us an account of what’s was wrong with the Consequence\nArgument, and perhaps also, some positive account of the ability to do\notherwise. So even though many compatibilists are committed to\nthinking that the Consequence Argument is unsound, it nevertheless set\nthe agenda for many contemporary compatibilist theories of free will\nand moral responsibility. \nOne compatibilist strategy for responding to the Classical\nIncompatibilist Argument is to concede that perhaps the Consequence\nArgument provides us with good reason for thinking that determinism\nrules out the ability to do otherwise while maintaining that such an\nability is not necessary for free will. In other words, the\ncompatibilist might sidestep the issues raised by the Consequence\nArgument by directly attacking the first premise of the Classical\nIncompatibilist Argument, which states is if a person acts of her own\nfree will, then she could have done otherwise. This compatibilist\nresponse rejects a conception of human agency that locates control in\nthe ability to do otherwise. Alternatively, it seeks to ground an\nagent’s control over his action in other features of his or her\nagency. In “Alternate Possibilities and Moral\nResponsibility,” (1969) Harry Frankfurt powerfully develops an\nargument that gives compatibilists the resources to argue in just this\nway. \nFrankfurt’s argument was directed against the Principle of\nAlternative Possibilities (PAP): \nPAP: A person is morally responsible for what she does do\nonly if she can do otherwise. \nCentral to Frankfurt’s attack on PAP are a class of examples in\nwhich an agent is morally responsible for her conduct, but could not,\nat the time of the pertinent action, do otherwise. Here is a close\napproximation to the example Frankfurt presented in his original\npaper: \nJones has resolved to shoot Smith. Black has learned of Jones’s\nplan and wants Jones to shoot Smith. But Black would prefer that Jones\nshoot Smith on his own. However, concerned that Jones might waver in\nhis resolve to shoot Smith, Black secretly arranges things so that, if\nJones should show any sign at all that he will not shoot Smith\n(something Black has the resources to detect), Black will be able to\nmanipulate Jones in such a way that Jones will shoot Smith. As things\ntranspire, Jones follows through with his plans and shoots Smith for\nhis own reasons. No one else in any way threatened or coerced Jones,\noffered Jones a bribe, or even suggested that he shoot Smith. Jones\nshot Smith under his own steam. Black never intervened. \nIn this example, Jones shot Smith on his own, and did so unencumbered\n— did so freely. But, given Black’s presence in the\nscenario, Jones could not have failed to shoot Smith (i.e., he could\nnot have done otherwise). Hence, we have a counterexample to PAP. \nIf Frankfurt’s argument against PAP is sound, the free will\ndebate has been systematically miscast through much of the history of\nphilosophy. If determinism threatens free will and moral\nresponsibility, it is not because it is incompatible with the\nability to do otherwise. Even if determinism is incompatible\nwith a sort of freedom involving the ability to do otherwise, it\nis not the kind of freedom required for moral responsibility. \nPerhaps not surprisingly, an enormous (and intricate) literature has\nemerged around the success of Frankfurt’s argument and, in\nparticular, around the example Frankfurt offered as contrary to PAP.\nThe debate is very much alive, and no clear victor has emerged (in the\nway that the incompatibilists can rightly claim to have laid to rest\nthe compatibilists’ conditional analysis strategy (see section\n3.3)). Regardless, what is most relevant to this essay is that\nFrankfurt’s argument inspired many compatibilists to begin\nthinking about accounts of freedom or control that unabashedly turn\naway from alternative possibilities. \nIn “Freedom and Resentment” (1962), P.F. Strawson broke\nranks with the classical compatibilists. Strawson developed three\ndistinct arguments for compatibilism, arguments quite different from\nthose the classical compatibilists endorsed. But more valuable than\nhis arguments was his general theory of what moral responsibility is,\nand hence, what is at stake in arguing about it. Strawson held that\nboth the incompatibilists and the compatibilists had misconstrued the\nnature of moral responsibility. Each disputant, Strawson suggested,\nadvanced arguments in support of or against a distorted simulacrum of\nthe real deal. \nTo understand moral responsibility properly, Strawson invited his\nreader to consider the reactive attitudes one has towards\nanother when she recognizes in another’s conduct an attitude of\nill will. The reactions that flow naturally from witnessing ill will\nare themselves attitudes that are directed at the perpetrator’s\nintentions or attitudes. When a perpetrator wrongs a person, she, the\nwronged party, typically has a personal reactive attitude of\nresentment. When the perpetrator wrongs another, some third party, the\nnatural reactive attitude is moral indignation, which amounts to a\n“vicarious analogue” of resentment felt on behalf of the\nwronged party. When one is oneself the wronging party, reflecting upon\nor coming to realize the wrong done to another, the natural reactive\nattitude is guilt. \nStrawson wanted contestants to the free will debate to see more\nclearly than they had that excusing a person — electing not to\nhold her blameworthy — involves more than some objective\njudgment that she did not do such and such, or did not intend so and\nso, and therefore does not merit some treatment or other. It involves\na suspension or withdrawal of certain morally reactive attitudes,\nattitudes involving emotional responses. On Strawson’s view,\nwhat it is to hold a person morally responsible for wrong conduct\nis nothing more than the propensity towards, or the\nsustaining of, a moral reactive attitude like indignation. Crucially,\nthe indignation is in response to the perceived attitude of ill will\nor culpable motive in the conduct of the person being held\nresponsible. Hence, Strawson explains, posing the question of whether\nthe entire framework of moral responsibility should be given up as\nirrational (if it were discovered that determinism is true) is\ntantamount to posing the question of whether persons in the\ninterpersonal community — that is, in real life — should\nforswear having reactive attitudes towards persons who wrong others,\nand who sometimes do so intentionally. Strawson invites us to see that\nthe morally reactive attitudes that are the constitutive basis of our\nmoral responsibility practices, as well as the interpersonal relations\nand expectations that give structure to these attitudes, are deeply\ninterwoven into human life. These attitudes, relations and\nexpectations are so much an expression of natural, basic features of\nour social lives — of their emotional textures — that it\nis practically inconceivable to imagine how they could be\ngiven up. \nThree major contributions in the 1960s profoundly altered the face of\ncompatibilism: the incompatibilists’ Consequence Argument,\nFrankfurt’s attack on the Principle of Alternative Possibilities\n(PAP), and Strawson’s focus upon the reactive attitudes. Every\nresultant compatibilist account in the contemporary literature is\nshaped in some way by at least one of these influences. This section\nwill focus upon six of the most significant contemporary compatibilist\npositions. Those wishing to learn about cutting edge work can read the\nsupplement on\n Compatibilism: The State of the Art. \nThe Consequence Argument (section 3.1) makes a strong case for the\nincompatibility of determinism and the freedom to do otherwise.\nAssuming that determinism is true, it states that: \nCompatibilists who accept that alternative possibilities are necessary\nfor moral responsibility must show what is wrong with this powerful\nargument. They also should offer some account of what John Martin\nFischer (1994) has called regulative control—a form of\ncontrol agents possess when they can bring about X and can refrain\nfrom bringing about X— that makes clear how it is possible even\nat a determined world. We will first consider three different\ncompatibilist attempts to unseat the Consequence Argument. Then we\nwill consider how some compatibilists, the so-called New\nDispositionalists, explain regulative control, that is, how they might\nexplain the freedom to do otherwise in a way that is compatible with\ncausal determinism. \nSome compatibilists have argued against the first premise of the\nConsequence Argument by attempting to show that a person can\nact in such a way that the past would be different. Consider the\ndifference between a person in the present who has the ability to act\nin such a way that she alters the past, as opposed to a\nperson who has the ability to act in such a way such that, if she\ndid so act, the past would have been different. Notice that the\nformer ability is outlandish; it would require magical powers. But the\nlatter ability is, at least by comparison, uncontroversial. It merely\nindicates that a person who acted a certain way at a certain time\npossessed abilities to act in various sorts of ways. Had she exercised\none of those abilities, and thereby acted differently, then the past\nleading up to her action would have been different. To illustrate how\ncomparatively mild such a claim about an agent’s ability and the\npast might be, think about a logically similar sort of claim that is\nsimply about what would be required for an agent to act differently.\nFor example, consider the claim, If I were dancing on the French\nRiviera right now, I’d be a lot richer than I am. Certainly\nthis claim does not mean that if I go to the French Riviera to dance,\nI will thereby be made richer. It only means that were I to\nhave gone there to tango, I would have to have had a lot more cash\nbeforehand in order to finance my escapades. Some compatibilists\n(e.g., Saunders 1968; Perry 2010; Dorr 2016) have argued that\nincompatibilist defenders of the Consequence Argument rely upon the\noutlandish notion of ability in the first premise of their argument.\nBut, these compatibilists maintain, the first premise is falsified\nwhen interpreted with a milder notion of ability. \nOther compatibilists have argued against the first premise of the\nConsequence Argument in a parallel way by attempting to show that a\nperson can act in such a way that a law of nature would not\nobtain. As with the distinction drawn regarding ability and the past,\nconsider the difference between a person who has the ability to act in\nsuch a way that she violates a law of nature, as opposed to a\nperson (at a deterministic world) who has the ability to act in such a\nway that, if she were to so act, some law of nature that does\nobtain would not. Notice that the former ability would require\nmagical powers. According to the compatibilist, the latter, by\ncontrast, would require nothing outlandish. It merely tells us that a\nperson who acted a certain way at a certain time possessed abilities\nto act in various sorts of ways. Had she exercised one of those\nabilities, and thereby acted differently, then the laws of nature that\nwould have entailed what she did in that hypothetical situation would\nbe different from the actual laws of nature that did entail what she\ndid actually do. This latter ability does not assume that agents are\nable to violate laws of nature; it just assumes that whatever the laws\nof nature are (at least at deterministic worlds), they must be such as\nto entail, given the past, what an agent will do. If an agent acts\ndifferently in some possible world than she acts in the actual world,\nthen some other set of laws will be the ones that entail what she does\nin that world. Some compatibilists (most notably Lewis 1981, but see\nalso Graham 2008 and Pendergraft 2011), fixing upon ability\npertaining to the laws of nature, have argued that incompatibilist\ndefenders of the Consequence Argument rely upon the outlandish notion\nof ability in the first premise of their argument. But, these\ncompatibilists maintain, that first premise is falsified when\ninterpreted with an uncontroversial notion of ability. \nMichael Slote (1982) attempted to refute the Consequence Argument by\nshowing that its central inference is invalid. The central point\ntowards which Slote works is that notions like unavoidability\n(or power necessity) are sensitive to contexts in a way that\nonly “selectively” permits the sort of inference at work\nin the Consequence Argument. Let us work with the idea of\nunavoidability. According to Slote, when we say that something is\nunavoidable for a person, we have in mind “selective”\ncontexts in which the facts pertaining to the unavoidability have\nnothing to do with that person — the facts bypass that\nperson’s agency altogether (Slote 1982, p.19). It is\nunavoidable for me, for instance, that Caesar crossed the Rubicon, or\nthat most motor vehicles now run on gasoline. Nothing about my agency\n— about what I can do — can alter such facts. This\nsuggests that unavoidability is misapplied when it concerns aspects of\na person’s own agency. But notice that in the Consequence\nArgument unavoidability (or power necessity) trades between a context\nin which the notion is appropriately applied, and one in which,\naccording to Slote, it is not. The first premise cites considerations\nthat have nothing to do with a person’s agency — facts\nprior to her birth, and the laws of nature. It is claimed that these\nfacts are unavoidable for a person, but from this a conclusion is\ndrawn that the very actions a person performs are unavoidable for her.\nYet this, Slote and other compatibilists (such as Dennett 1984a;\nMcKay & Johnson 1996) have suggested, is to draw incompatibilist\nconclusions illicitly from reasonable claims regarding\nunavoidability. \nEven if some compatibilist reply proves that the Consequence Argument\nis unsound, this alone would not amount to a positive argument for\ncompatibilism. It would merely mean that one key argument for the\nincompatibility of determinism and regulative control is untenable.\nBut that is consistent with the incompatibility of\ndeterminism and regulative control. Indeed, some argue for this\nincompatibility without relying upon the potentially problematic\nassumptions about power necessity at work in the Consequence Argument\n(Fischer 1994; and Ginet 1990, 2003). Furthermore, even if the\ncompatibilist could discredit all current arguments for the\nincompatibility of determinism and regulative control, it still\nbehooves her to offer a positive argument demonstrating the\ncompatibility of determinism and regulative control. Compatibilists\nwishing to defend regulative control, such Berofsky (1987, 1995,\n2012), Campbell (1997), Nelkin (2011), and Vihvelin (2013), still have\ntheir work cut out for them. \nRecently several compatibilists have offered a positive account of\nregulative control (e.g., Fara 2008; M. Smith 2003; and Vihvelin 2004,\n2013). Call the view these compatibilists advance, the new\ndispositionalism. \nIn advancing a compatibilist thesis, Vihvelin speaks of the ability to\ndo otherwise (and especially choose otherwise) in terms of a bundle of\ndispositions (2004, p. 429). Likewise, Fara proposes a dispositional\nanalysis of the ability to do otherwise. And Smith speaks of the\nrational capacities to believe and desire otherwise (and so,\npresumably, do otherwise) in terms of a “raft of\npossibilities” (2003, p.27). For Fara, Vihvelin, and Smith, we\nassess claims about the disposition constitutive of the ability to do\notherwise, or the dispositions in the bundle, or the possibilities in\nthe raft, by attending to the intrinsic properties of an agent in\nvirtue of which she acts when she tries (Fara 2008, p.861), or the\ncausal bases of the pertinent dispositions (Vihvelin 2004, p. 436), or\nthe underlying structure of a rational capacity (Smith, p. 29). How\nso?  Fara does not say, though it seems likely he would agree to\nsomething like the proposals offered by Vihvelin and Smith. According\nto them, we hold fixed the relevant causal base or underlying\nstructure of an agent’s disposition to, say, wave hello to a\nfriend, or tell the truth under interrogation, and we consider various\ncounterfactual conditions in which that causal base or underlying\nstructure operates unimpaired. Does the agent in an appropriately rich\nrange of such counterfactual conditions wave hello or tell the truth?\nIf she does, then even if in the actual world she does not wave hello\nor tell the truth, she was able to do so. She had at the time of\naction the pertinent agential abilities or capacities. And this is\ntrue even if that world is determined (see, e.g., Vihvelin 2004,\n437). Why?  Because there is no basis for contending that when we test\nthe relevant dispositions at other possible worlds, we have to\nrestrict the worlds to ones in which we hold fixed the past and the\nlaws. Note how the problems with the classical compatibilists’\ncounterfactual analysis are circumvented. If we are attending to the\ncausal base of the relevant dispositions, we can easily see how\nDanielle’s relevant causal base is ill-equipped for picking up\nblond haired dogs. \nThe new dispositionalism clearly improves upon classical\ncompatibilism. But how does it fare in its own right? Do we have here\na compelling positive account of the ability—and so the\nfreedom—to do otherwise that is compatible with determinism? One\nslippery matter has to do with the way the relevant worlds are\nidentified in the preceding paragraph. We have to restrict our\nattention to possible worlds in which the causal base of, or\nunderlying structure for, the ability operates unimpaired. Some will\nclaim that this restriction is not dialectically innocent. Consider a\nFrankfurt example (section 4.2). Suppose Jones freely shoots Smith,\nbut if he were about to do otherwise, Black would cause Jones to do so\nagainst his (Jones’s) will. When Jones shoots Smith on his own,\nhe does so freely and is morally responsible, despite the fact that,\ndue to Black’s presence, he was not free to do otherwise. Fara\n(2008, pp.854–5), Nelkin (2012), Smith (2003, p. 19), and\nVihvelin (2000, 2004, pp.445–8, 2013) say otherwise. They say\nJones could have done otherwise, was able to do otherwise, and was\nfree to do otherwise when he shot Smith on his own. Why? Roughly,\nbecause if we fix on the underlying causal structure implicated in\nSmith’s shooting Jones on his own, and if we go only to other\nworlds in which that causal structure operates unimpeded, we will rule\nout worlds in which the counterfactual intervener Black is at play.\nThen we will be able to specify a range of true counterfactuals in\nwhich an agent had some reason, for instance, to do otherwise, and she\ndid otherwise. The delicate question here, one which we will not\nattempt to resolve, is whether in accounting for the freedom to do\notherwise the new dispositionalists are entitled to restrict\nattention only to worlds in which the relevant causal base operates\nunimpeded. \nOther compatibilists, most notably, John Martin Fischer (1994), and\nFischer and Mark Ravizza (1998) (see section 5.5 below), have appealed\nto similar restrictions. But in doing so, they only mean to explain\nthe nature of the freedom or control exhibited in how the agent did\nact—that is, what Fischer has termed her guidance\ncontrol. In striking contrast to how the new dispositionalists\nreason, they do not think they are thereby entitled to claim that an\nagent in a Frankfurt example is free to do otherwise. So it is\npossible that what the new dispositionalists have identified with the\npertinent counterfactuals they fix upon is not the freedom to do\notherwise, but instead, a freedom located in what an agent does do\n(which is a matter of guidance control, not regulative control). This,\nat least, is how compatibilists like Fischer and Ravizza would reason.\n[For a lively debate over just this issue, see the exchange between\nFischer (2008) and Vihvelin (2008).] \nOn the back of his rejection of the Principle of Alternative\nPossibilities, Harry Frankfurt (1971) developed a compatibilist theory\nthat does not appeal to regulative control in any way.\nFrankfurt’s hierarchical mesh theory can instead be\nseen as a development of classical compatibilist attempts to\nunderstand freedom in terms of an agent’s unencumbered ability\nto get what she wants (see Section 3.1.). More precisely, Frankfurt\nexplains freely willed action in terms of actions that issue from\ndesires that suitably mesh with hierarchically ordered elements of a\nperson’s psychology. The key idea is that a person who acts of\nher own free will acts from desires that are nested within more\nencompassing elements of her self. On this view, when a freely willing\nagent acts, her actions emanate from her rather than from\nsomething foreign. \nFrankfurt distinguishes between first-order and second-order desires.\nThis serves as the basis for his hierarchical account of freedom. The\nformer desires have as their objects actions, such as eating a slice\nof cheesecake, taking in a movie, or gyrating one’s hips to the\nsweet sounds of B. B. King. The latter are desires about desires. They\nhave as their objects, desires of the first-order, such as the desire\nto have the motivation to exercise daily (something that, regrettably,\ntoo many of us lack): “If only I wanted to go to the\ngym today, then it would be easy for me to get my tail off this\ncouch!” \nAmongst the first-order desires that a person has, some are ones that\ndo not move her to action, such as one’s (unsatisfied)\ndesire to say to her boss what she knows that she should not. Other\nfirst-order desires, however, do move a person to action,\nsuch as one’s (satisfied) desire to follow through on her\nboss’s request. Frankfurt identifies an agent’s\nwill with her effective first-order desire, the one moving a\nperson, as Frankfurt puts it, “all the way to action”\n(1971, p. 84). \nFrankfurt also distinguishes between different sorts of second-order\ndesires. Some are merely desires to have first-order desires, but\nnot that those first-order desires would comprise her will.\nFrankfurt uses the example of a psychotherapist who wishes to\nexperience a desire for narcotics so as to understand a patient\nbetter. The therapist has no wish that this desire be effective in\nleading her to action (1971, pp.84–5). She wants to know what it\nis like to feel the craving for the drug; she has no wish to take it.\nOn the other hand, other second-order desires that a person has are\ndesires for effective first-order desires, desires that would\ncomprise her will, and would thereby be effective in moving her all\nthe way to action. For instance, the dieter who is constantly\nfrustrated by her sugar cravings might desire a more effective desire\nfor health, one that would be more effective in guiding her eating\nhabits than it often is. These second-order desires Frankfurt calls\nsecond-order volitions. There is no theoretical limit to how\nhighly-ordered one’s desires might be. The dieter in the above\nexample might develop a third-order desire for her second-order desire\n(regarding her desire for health) not to play such a dominant role in\nher daily deliberations. Other things, she might reason, are of more\nimportance in life than concerning herself with her dietary\nmotivations. \nOnce this conceptual apparatus is in place, Frankfurt contrasts\ndifferent sorts of addicts to illustrate his concept of free will.\nConsider first the unwilling addict, who is someone that has\nboth a first-order desire to take the drug, and a first-order desire\nnot to take the drug. Crucially, however, the unwilling addict also\nhas a second-order volition that her first-order desire to take the\ndrug not be her will. This is the basis for her\nunwillingness. Regrettably, her irresistible addictive desire to take\nthe drug constitutes her will. Next, consider the case of the\nwilling addict. The willing addict, like the unwilling\naddict, has conflicting first-order desires as regards taking the drug\nto which she is addicted. But the willing addict, by way of a\nsecond-order volition, embraces her addictive first-order desire to\ntake the drug. She wants to be as she is and act as she does. \nIt is now easy to illustrate Frankfurt’s hierarchical theory of\nfree will. The unwilling addict does not take the drug of her own free\nwill since her will conflicts at a higher level with what she wishes\nit to be. The willing addict, however, takes the drug of her own free\nwill since her will meshes with what she wishes it to be.\nFrankurt’s theory can now be set out as follows: \nOne acts of her own free will if and only if her action issues from\nthe will she wants. \nIt might seem strange that Frankfurt’s willing addict acts of\nher own free will since, due to her addiction, she could not do\notherwise. But recall that Frankfurt does not believe that freedom\ninvolving alternative possibilities is required for moral\nresponsibility. Frankfurt instead believes that the freedom pertinent\nto moral responsibility concerns what an agent does do and her actual\nbasis for doing it. That is, Frankfurt believes that it is, to again\nreturn to Fischer’s helpful distinction, guidance control that\nis necessary for moral responsibility, not regulative control. The\nwilling addict possesses the sort of freedom required for moral\nresponsibility because the will leading to her action is the one that\nshe wishes it to be; she acts with guidance control. \nFrankfurt’s hierarchical theory has faced intense scrutiny. Here\nwe consider two objections that emerge from structural aspects of it.\nOne has to do with its hierarchical nature. The other has to do with\nits relying exclusively upon a mesh between different features of an\nagent’s psychology. (For a discussion of Frankfurt’s\nattempts to respond to these problems, see section A of the\nsupplement,\n Compatibilism: The State of the Art.) \nConsider the hierarchical problem. According to Frankfurt, a\nperson facing a problem with regard to her will’s freedom faces\na situation in which she is conflicted about one (or more) of her\nfirst-order desires. Which desire “speaks for” the agent?\nWith which desire can she be identified? To resolve conflicts between\nfirst-order desires (or between an agent’s attitudes about a\nspecific first-order desire), Frankfurt tells us that a person forms a\nsecond-order desire that has as its object the first-order desire(s)\nshe wants to move her to action. By this means, an agent endorses or\nidentifies with one of the first-order desires and, if all goes\nsmoothly, that one becomes her will. Through this process, she draws\nwithin the sphere of her self one sort of desire and alienates\nanother. But here, a problem arises. A person cannot be identified\nwith her first-order desires because she can be alienated from them.\nYet she can also be alienated from second, or even at higher-orders\n(Watson 1975). After all, she might find herself both wanting that\nsome specific first-order desire be her will and horrified at the\nthought (i.e., not want it to be the case that that particular\nfirst-order desire be her will). Hence, the problem of an\nagent’s free will can reappear at these ever ascending stages.\nIf this is correct, Frankfurt’s view is incomplete. Maybe his\naccount of free will does articulate a necessary condition for acting\nof one’s own free will, but it appears not to be sufficient. It\nneeds supplementing so as to avoid the problem of a spiraling\nreoccurrence of challenges to an agent’s freedom. \nNext consider the mesh problem. According to Frankfurt, if\nfreely willed action for which an agent is morally responsible wholly\ndepends on the relation between an agent’s will and her\nsecond-order volitions, then it does not matter in any way how an\nagent came to have that particular mesh. But cases can be constructed\nthat seem to suggest that it does matter how an agent came to\nhave a particular mesh between her first-order and her second-order\ndesires. (For example, see Slote 1980; and Fischer & Ravizza 1998,\npp. 194–206.) Using Frankfurt’s own example of the willing\naddict, suppose that the addict’s second-order willingness is\nitself caused by the effects of the drug use. Suppose that the drug\nuse has impaired her evaluations or preferences arising at a\nsecond-order of reflection on her own mental states. Or, setting this\nsort of case aside, imagine that an agent is brainwashed or\nmanipulated through some means or another, say by hypnosis, or by\naliens zapping a person into having a different set of psychological\npreferences than those that she would otherwise have. In all of these\ncases—just call them manipulation cases—Frankfurt\nseems committed to the view that such agents act of their own free\nwill and are morally responsible so long as the appropriate\npsychological mesh is in place, no matter what sort of (merely\napparent) freedom and responsibility-undermining history gave way to\nan agent’s having that particular mesh. \nThis highlights the real difficulty Frankfurt’s view faces in\nlight of the Source Incompatibilist Argument. Since Frankfurt holds\nthat what matters for moral responsibility is the relationship between\nan agent’s effective first-order desire and her second-order\nvolition, and not the source of those respective desires, he is\ncommitted to thinking that even if the desires are implanted by some\nalien force, the agent can still be responsible for acting on them.\nBut many have found it dubious that an agent could be responsible for\nan action that flows from motives that can be traced back to forces\noutside of the agent. In response, Frankfurt must show that being the\nsource of one’s motives is not needed for moral responsibility.\nIf he cannot, then it seems that the source incompatibilist has the\nupper hand. She can straightforwardly argue that, if one sort alien\ncausal history that gives rise to the Frankfurtian mesh undermines\nagents’ freedom and responsibility, then why wouldn’t a\ndeterministic history do the same? \nIn Freedom within Reason (1990), as well as in several\nprovocative papers (1980, 1987), Susan Wolf develops a theory of free\nwill and moral responsibility that highlights a mesh between an\nagent’s action and what she (correctly) regards as valuable. For\nWolf, free will concerns an agent’s ability to act in accord\nwith the True and the Good. Unlike Frankfurt’s, the conditions\nof Wolf’s mesh theory require an anchor external to the\nagent’s internal psychological states (the True and the Good).\nThe crucial question for Wolf concerns whether an agent is able to act\nupon moral reasons. Hence, Wolf embraces the title, The Reason\nView. A related, though importantly different version of the\nReason View has more recently been defended by Nelkin (2011). \nIn her effort to make free will track moral reasons, Wolf (and later\nNelkin) develops a surprising asymmetry thesis according to which\npraiseworthy conduct does not require the freedom to do otherwise but\nblameworthy behavior does (1980; and 1990, pp.79–81). Put in\nterms of guidance and regulative control, only blameworthy conduct\nrequires regulative control. Guidance control is sufficient for\npraiseworthy conduct. Wolf’s reasoning is that, if an agent does\nact in accord with the True and the Good, and if indeed she is so\npsychologically determined that she cannot but act in accord with the\nTrue and the Good, her inability to act otherwise does not threaten\nthe sort of freedom that morally responsible agents need. For how\ncould her freedom be in any way enhanced simply by adding an ability\nto act irrationally? But blameworthy behavior, Wolf reasons, does\nrequire regulative control since, if an agent acts contrary to the\nTrue and the Good, but is so psychologically determined that she\ncannot act in accord with it, then, being unable to act as reason\nrequires, it would be unreasonable to blame her. \nBecause Wolf’s asymmetrical view requires regulative control in\nthe case of blameworthy actions, her compatibilism is open to\nrefutation by incompatibilist arguments designed to show that\ndeterminism is incompatible with freedom involving alternative\npossibilities. As a result, Wolf argues that physical determination\ndoes not entail psychological determination. She then argues that\nphysical determination is consistent with the ability to do otherwise\nbecause the relevant ability is one that only requires the falsity of\npsychological determinism, which is a thesis she takes to have no\nsupport. (Interestingly, this means that although Wolf is a\ncompatibilist about blameworthiness and physical determinism, she is\nan incompatibilist about blameworthiness and psychological\ndeterminsim.) \nWhat about the Source Incompatibilist Argument? On Wolf’s view,\nif an agent does act from reasons, and if her reasons are (or are\nsusceptible to) the True and the Good, then she as an agent is a\nsource of conduct that carries with it (or is able to carry with it)\nthe stamp of moral reason. Enough said. But what about the Source\nIncompatibilist Argument, and the premise concerning ultimacy that\nseems to plague most every brand of compatibilism: A person acts of\nher own free will only if she is its ultimate source? Like\nFrankfurt’s mesh theory, Wolf’s too is endangered by the\nthought that an agent could be artificially manipulated in a\nresponsibility-undermining manner into satisfying the mesh\nWolf’s theory demands. And mightn’t such manipulation be\nno different than the manner in which a deterministic world shapes an\nagent to have the psychological structure and motives she has? Does\nnot the prospect of manipulation cases show that without ultimacy, an\nagent cannot be the proper source of her action? So it appears that\nWolf is at the same crossroads as is Frankfurt. Either she must show\nwhat is defective in the manipulation cases so as to distinguish\nagents so manipulated from the sort of proper mesh demanded by her\ntheory, or she must bite the same bullet and accept that these sorts\nof manipulated agents, by the conditions of her theory, do act of\ntheir own free wills and are morally responsible for their\nconduct. \nSeveral compatibilists have suggested that freely willed actions issue\nfrom volitional features of agency that are sensitive to an\nappropriate range of reasons (see Dennett 1984a; Fingarette 1972;\nGert & Duggan 1979; Glover 1970; MacIntyre 1957; Neely 1974; and\nNozick 1981). Agents who are unresponsive to appropriate rational\nconsiderations (such as compulsives or neurotics) do not act of their\nown free wills. But agents who are responsive to some range\nof rational considerations do. This view has been artfully refined in\nrecent years by Fischer (1987,  1994), and\nsubsequently, Fischer and Ravizza (1998). (For a more advanced\ndiscussion of Fischer and Ravizza’s view, which many regard as\nthe gold standard for contemporary compatibilism, see section B of the\nsupplement\n Compatibilism: The State of the Art.)\n  \nA reasons-responsiveness theory turns upon dispositional\nfeatures of an agent’s relation to reasons issuing in freely\nwilled action. Appropriately reasons-responsive conduct is sensitive\nto rational considerations. Importantly, the view is not merely that\nan agent would display herself in some counterfactual situations to be\nresponsive to reasons, but rather that her responsiveness to reasons\nin some counterfactual situations is evidence that her actual conduct\nitself — the causes giving rise to it —\nis also in response to rational considerations. (Amendments need to be\nadded to accommodate cases of spur-of-the-moment, or impulsive freely\nwilled action.) \nThe most natural way to understand a reasons-responsive theory is in\nterms of an agent’s responsiveness to reasons. To\nillustrate, suppose that Frank Zappa plays the banjo of his own free\nwill. According to a reasons-responsive theory, his playing the banjo\nfreely at that time requires that if, in at least some hypothetical\ncases, he had reason not to, then he would refrain from playing the\nbanjo. For instance, if Jimi Hendrix were to have stepped into\nFrank’s recording studio and asked Frank to play his electric\nguitar, Frank would have wanted to make Jimi happy and thus would have\ngladly put his banjo aside and picked up his electric guitar. It\nseems, then, that for Frank to play the banjo of his own free will,\nFrank — the agent — must have regulative control\nand not merely guidance control over his playing. His freedom must\nconsist partially in his ability to act upon alternatives. \nNotice that, because Frankfurt examples challenge the\nincompatibilists’ demand for regulative control, they also\nchallenge an agent-based reasons-responsive theory (Fischer\n& Ravizza 1998, pp. 34–41). Imagine that the benevolent demon\nJerry Garcia wants Frank to play the banjo at the relevant time. Jerry\nwould much prefer that Frank play the banjo on his own. But worried\nthat Frank might elect not to play the banjo, Jerry covertly arranges\nthings so as to manipulate Frank if the need arises. If Frank should\nshow any indication that he will not play the banjo, Jerry will\nmanipulate Frank so that Frank will play the banjo. Hence, when Frank\ndoes play the banjo uninfluenced by Jerry’s possible\nintervention, he does so of his own free will. But he has neither\nregulative control, nor does he seem to be reasons-responsive, with\nrespect to his banjo playing. Due to Jerry’s presence, he cannot\nbut play the banjo even if Jimi Hendrix were to ask Frank to play\nhis guitar. \nTo alleviate the tension between a reasons-responsive theory and\nFrankfurt examples, Fischer argued that reasons-responsive\ncompatibilism can be cast in such a way that it involves only guidance\ncontrol. Consider the example with Frank, Jimi, and Jerry. Frank did\nnot have regulative control over his playing the banjo since\nJerry’s presence ensured that Frank play the banjo even if Jimi\nwere to ask Frank to play his guitar. The scenario in which Jimi asks\nFrank not to play his banjo is one that Frank normally would\nfind to be a compelling reason to refrain from his banjo playing.\nHence, by his own lights, Frank would find\nJimi’s request compelling. Yet, due to Jerry’s presence,\nFrank is not responsive to such a weighty reason. What would\nbe required to illustrate responsiveness would be to subtract Jerry\nfrom the scenario. This would do the trick. So suppose that Frank\nplays the banjo of his own free will, even with Jerry passively\nstanding by. How can it be shown that Frank’s conduct was, in\nsome manner, reasons-responsive? How can it be shown that what he\nactually did was in response to a reason? Well, if Jimi\nHendrix had asked Frank not to play the banjo but the guitar instead,\nand if Jerry’s presence were to be subtracted from the\nsituation, then Frank would respond to Jimi’s request\nand play the guitar and not the banjo. This suggests that Frank does\nplay the banjo of his own free will even in the actual situation in\nwhich Jerry is passively standing by. \nIllustrating reasons-responsiveness in a Frankfurt example seems to\nrequire recognizing counterfactual conditions in which an agent acts\notherwise in response to reasons. But in a Frankfurt example, one has\nto subtract from those conditions the presence of the ensuring\nconditions (the counterfactual intervener) designed to guarantee that\nthe agent not act otherwise. How can this move be legitimate? How is\nit not just an arbitrary addendum to cram together two compatibilist\nthemes that otherwise appear to be at odds (reasons-responsiveness and\nFrankfurt examples)? It is not arbitrary, and here is why. Think about\nwhat happens in the actual scenario of a Frankfurt example. As things\nunfold, the demon is inactive. The agent acts for her own\nreasons. But now, focusing solely on what the agent does in\nthis actual scenario, and the reasons that give her a basis for doing\nwhat she does, consider what deliberative features of her agency\nplayed the causal role in the actual sequence of events\nbringing about her action. So, just fix upon whatever constitutes that\nnarrower range of agential characteristics within the wider spectrum\nof all of the features that made up Frank Zappa, the agent. Since it\nis only that narrower spectrum that we propose to identify with the\ncausal production of Frank’s conduct, just call it the\nmechanism that produces his action. \nOnce we have located the mechanism of action that is at work in the\nactual causal sequence of a Frankfurt example, we can turn our\nattention to understanding the dispositional features of it\nas a causal mechanism. If other reasons bear upon it, then it\nwould be sensitive to some of those reasons. It would produce\ndifferent conduct in some reasonable range of cases. If it would,\nthen that very mechanism is responsive to reasons. Confirming\nthat that very mechanism is responsive to reasons would not merely\nillustrate that, in scenarios other than the actual, the agent acts\nupon a mechanism sensitive to reasons. It would also illustrate that\nin the Frankfurt scenario in which the agent really does act,\nwhat does play a role in the actual causal sequence of her\naction is some feature of her agency (a mechanism) that\nitself is in fact a response to a reason. \nFischer offers an actual-sequence, mechanism-based,\nreasons-responsive analysis of guidance control. He maintains\nthat his analysis of guidance control is compatible with determinism.\nAccording to Fischer, an agent, and the mechanism of her action, can\nbe entirely determined in the actual sequence of events in which she\nacts. Yet the actual manner in which her mechanism responds to reasons\ncould be appropriately sensitive to reasons such that, if different\nreasons were to bear upon it, it would respond differently, and the\nagent whose mechanism it is would act differently than she does\nact. \nRecently, however, Carolina Sartorio (2016) has argued that\nactual-sequence compatibilist do not need to appeal to mechanisms in\norder to vindicate their theories. According to Sartorio, we can\nexplain Frank’s responsibility by appeal to the actual causes of\nhis behavior, which are, she claims, much richer than has previously\nbeen realized. Not only is his behavior caused by his sensitive to\nreasons there are, on Sartorio’s view, it is also caused by\nthe absence of other reasons (in this case, e.g., the absence\nof Jimi’s request is itself a cause in the actual-sequence).\n \nFischer’s reasons-responsiveness compatibilist starts by\nrejecting the key premise of the Classical Incompatibilist Argument,\nin that it rejects the thesis that freedom of the sort required for\nmoral responsibility requires the ability to do otherwise. But how\ndoes Fischer’s view stack up against the Source Incompatibilist\nArgument? The challenge Fischer faces here, which is pushed forcefully\nby Pereboom (2001) and Mele (2019), is the same as that faced by\nFrankfurt and Wolf. The source incompatibilist maintains that it is a\nnecessary condition of free will that one be an ultimate source of her\naction, and determinism is incompatible with one’s being an\nultimate source of her action. The compatibilist’s task is to\nshow that her treatment of the source of an agent’s conduct is\nsufficient for free will. But the source incompatibilist will point to\nmanipulation cases that suggest that some causal histories giving rise\nto compatibilist-friendly psychological structures, such as\nreasons-responsive mechanisms, are freedom and responsibility\nundermining. If so, then why is determinism any different from a\nmanipulation case? The burden, it seems, is on the compatibilist to\nshow how it is that manipulation cases differ from a normal\ndeterministic history. The compatibilist’s only other strategy\nis simply to deny that the pertinent manipulated agents are not free\nand morally responsible. This problem is not lost on\nreasons-responsiveness compatibilists, of course (see Fischer 2004 for\none attempt to address these issues). \nFinally, let’s consider views inspired by Strawson’s\ncompatibilism. \nSeveral contemporary philosophers have advanced Strawsonian themes.\nFor example, Gary Watson (1987) sought to elaborate these themes by\nthinking of our moral responsibility practices, and in particular the\nmorally reactive attitudes, along the lines of a communication-based\ntheory in which a morally responsible agent’s competence turns\nin some way upon being a potential interlocutor to moral conversations\nbetween her and the moral community in which she operates. On this\nview, the control condition for moral responsibility would have to fit\nthe capacity to communicate morally through word and deed with members\nof the moral community. \nIn a somewhat different development of Strawson’s thought, John\nMartin Fischer and Mark Ravizza hold that an account of guidance\ncontrol aids in providing the conditions of application for the\nconcept of moral responsibility, a concept that they maintain is\nStrawsonian (1998, pp.1–27). Fischer and Ravizza intend their\nStrawsonian theory as an amendment to Strawson’s suggestion that\nmoral responsibility is to be associated with the reactions of those\nwithin the moral community to members of the community. They advise\nthat moral responsibility be developed by thinking in terms of the\npropriety conditions for the morally reactive attitudes.  \nSusan Wolf defends (with significant reservations) the Strawsonian\nthesis that the interpersonal viewpoint (that permits access to the\nmorally reactive attitudes) is one that a freely willing agent cannot\ngive up (1981). Wolf diverges at points with Strawson’s own\nmanner of defending this. But Wolf’s central thesis is\nStrawsonian. A person cannot fully forswear the point of view of the\ninterpersonal attitudes, and this point of view is the point of view\nfrom whence our morally reactive attitudes gain their force and figure\nin our conduct. (Related defenses of the Strawsonian thesis are also\nfound in Shabo 2012 and Coates 2018.) \nPaul Russell (1995) has also defended a form of Strawsonian\ncompatibilism, the central features of which he finds anticipated in\nHume’s writings on free will and moral responsibility. According\nto Russell, we can learn from Hume, as Strawson did, to understand our\nmoral responsibility practices as fundamentally a matter of our\nsentiments and our social expectations as structured and sustained by\nthese sentiments. Fixing on our moral natures, as we should, dispels\nany presumption that determinism would somehow pose a threat to our\nconceptions of freedom and moral responsibility. \nR. Jay Wallace (1994) offers an extension of Strawson’s general\nstrategy in terms of moral norms of fairness for holding responsible\nreflected in our moral responsibility practices (1994,\npp.103–9). From these moral norms—and not from the mere\nnaturalistic facts that we have these practices—Wallace proceeds\nto uncover the conditions required for being responsible.\nWallace’s position has emerged as a serious alternative to the\nsorts of approaches to the free will problem that take as their\ntheoretical starting point the nature of persons, or the\naction-theoretic characteristics of the process issuing in freely\nwilled action.  \nAnd finally, perhaps the most detailed recent defense of Strawsonian\ncompatibilism is due to David Shoemaker (2017). Shoemaker argues for a\nresponse-dependent account of moral responsibility first by defending\na response-dependent account of amusement. He then argues the norms of\nhumor are tightly parallel to those of responsibility-entailing\nemotions like anger. And from there, he builds his response-dependent\naccount of moral responsibility.","contact.mail":"msmckenna@u.arizona.edu","contact.domain":"u.arizona.edu"},{"date.published":"2004-04-26","date.changed":"2019-11-26","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/","author1":"Michael McKenna","author1.info":"http://philosophy.arizona.edu/michael-mckenna","author2.info":"http://djustincoates.com","entry":"compatibilism","body.text":"\n\n\nCompatibilism offers a solution to the free will problem,\nwhich concerns a disputed incompatibility between free will and\ndeterminism. Compatibilism is the thesis that free will is\ncompatible with determinism. Because free will is typically taken to\nbe a necessary condition of moral responsibility, compatibilism is\nsometimes expressed as a thesis about the compatibility between moral\nresponsibility and determinism.\n\nCompatibilism emerges as a response to a problem posed by causal\ndeterminism. But what problem is that? Well, suppose, as the thesis of\ncausal determinism tells us, that everything that occurs is the\ninevitable result of the laws of nature and the state of the world in\nthe distant past. If this is the case, then everything human agents do\nflows from the laws of nature and the way the world was in the distant\npast. But if what we do is simply the consequence of the laws of\nnature and the state of the world in the distant past—then we\ncannot do anything other than what we ultimately do. Nor are we in any\nmeaningful sense the ultimate causal source of our actions, since they\nhave their causal origins in the laws of nature and the state of the\nworld long ago. Determinism therefore seems to prevent human agents\nfrom having the freedom to do otherwise, and it also seems to prevent\nthem from being the sources of their actions. If either of these is\ntrue, then it’s doubtful that human agents are free or\nresponsible for their actions in any meaningful sense.  \nThese lines of argument, which have been regimented in the work of\nGinet (1966), van Inwagen (1975, 1983), Wisdom (1934), Mele (1995),\nand Pereboom (1995, 2001), among many others, present a real problem\nfor those who are inclined to think that we are free and responsible\nfor our choices and actions and that the natural world might operate\nas a deterministic system (or if not completely deterministic, one in\nwhich an indeterminism is merely stochastic noise that is causally\nirrelevant at the level of human agency). How to respond to such\narguments? On the one hand, incompatibilists accept (some\nversion of at least one of) these arguments and so insist that our\nself-conception as free and responsible agents would be seriously\nmisguided if causal determinism turns out to be true. Some\nincompatibilists argue for these conclusions indirectly—first by\narguing that determinism precludes freedom or control and then second\nby arguing that such freedom is necessary for moral responsibility.\nOther incompatibilists argue directly that causal determinism\nprecludes moral responsibility. \nCompatibilists, on the other hand, claim that these concerns miss the\nmark. Some compatibilists hold this because they think the truth of\ncausal determinism would not undermine our freedom to do otherwise\n(Berofsky 1987, Campbell 1997, Vihvelin 2013, etc.). As a result,\nthese compatibilists tell us, the truth of causal determinism poses no\nthreat to our status as morally responsible agents (notice the\nenthymematic premise here: the freedom to do otherwise is sufficient\nfor the kind of control an agent must possess to be morally\nresponsible for her actions). Other compatibilists show less concern\nin rebutting the conclusion that the freedom to do otherwise is\nincompatible with determinism. Compatibilists of this stripe reject\nthe idea that such freedom is necessary for meaningful forms of free\nwill (e.g., Frankfurt 1969, 1971; Watson 1975, Dennett 1984)—the\n“varieties of free will worth wanting,” (Dennett\n1984). And even more notably, some compatibilists simply deny that\nfreedom of this sort is in any way connected to morally responsible\nagency (e.g., Fischer 1994, Fischer & Ravizza 1998, Scanlon 1998,\nWallace 1994, Sartorio 2016). What we see here is not a unified front\nin the face of the incompatibilist challenge(s).  Instead,\ncompatibilists have been careful to identify the precise elements of\nincompatibilists’ arguments that they take to be erroneous, and\nthen build their respective theories of freedom and responsibility\nwith that in mind.  \nTo help better situate compatibilist theories, we will now consider in\nmore detail the arguments that incompatibilists have advanced on\nbehalf of their own theories, since it is these arguments that have\nshaped the contours of compatibilist theories. As we mentioned above,\nthe truth of causal determinism apparently poses a problem for freedom\nand responsibility in at least two ways. First, it might entail that\nno one has the freedom to do otherwise, which is a kind of\npower or control over one’s actions that many have regarded as\nnecessary for moral responsibility. Second, it might entail that no\none is the ultimate causal source of his or her actions. That our\nactions originate in our free will and not in forces outside of us\nalso seems like a plausible condition on morally responsible agency.\nWe take each of these potential threats in turn. \nA natural way to think of an agent’s control over her conduct at\na moment in time is in terms of her ability to select among, or choose\nbetween, alternative courses of action. This picture of control stems\nfrom common features of our perspectives as practical deliberators\nsettling on courses of action. If a person is choosing between voting\nfor Clinton as opposed to Trump, it is plausible to assume that her\nfreedom with regard to her voting consists, at least partially, in her\nability to choose between these two alternatives. On this account,\nacting with free will requires alternative possibilities. A\nnatural way to model this account of free will is in terms of an\nagent’s future as a garden of forking paths branching off from a\nsingle past. A locus of freely willed action arises when the present\noffers, from an agent’s (singular) past, more than one path into\nthe future. On this model of human agency, then, when a person acts of\nher own free will, she could have acted otherwise. \nThis conception of free will immediately invites the thought that\ndeterminism might be a threat. For determinism, understood in the\nstrict sense characterized above, tells us that, at any time, given\nthe facts of the past and the laws of nature, only one future\nis possible. But according to the conception of human agency under\nconsideration, a freely willing agent could have acted other than she\ndid and, hence, that more than one future is possible. \nHere is an incompatibilist argument that codifies the considerations\nset out above: \nFor ease of reference and discussion throughout this entry, let us\nsimplify the above argument as follows: \nCall this simplified argument the Classical Incompatibilist\nArgument. According to the argument, if determinism is true, no\none has access to alternatives of the sort you might plausibly think\nto be required for free will. \nThere is a second conception of the sort of control that might be\nnecessary for morally responsible agency. This conception starts with\nthe observation that an agent’s control seems to consist in her\nplaying a crucial role in the production of her actions. Think in\nterms of the transparent difference between those events that are\nproducts of one’s agency and those that are merely\nbodily happenings. For instance, consider the choice to pick up a cup\nof coffee as opposed to the event of one’s heart beating or\none’s blood circulating. In the latter cases, one recognizes\nevents happening to one; in the former, one is the source and producer\nof that happening. On this model of human agency, control is\nunderstood in terms of being the source of one’s actions. \nFixing just upon this conception of agency, how might determinism pose\na threat to free will? If determinism is true, then what happened in\nthe distant past, when combined with the laws of nature, is causally\nsufficient for the production of every human action. But if this is\nso, then, while it might be true that an agent herself is crucially\ninvolved in the production of her action, that action actually has its\nsource in causal antecedent that originate outside of her.\nHence, she, as an agent, is not the ultimate source of her\nactions. \nWhat is meant here by an ultimate source, and not just a source? An\nagent is an ultimate source of her action only if, at the very least,\nsomething necessary for her action originates within the agent\nherself. It cannot be located in places and times prior to the\nagent’s freely willing her action. If an agent is not the\nultimate source of her actions, then her actions do not originate in\nher, and if her actions are the outcomes of conditions guaranteeing\nthem, how can she be said to control them? The conditions sufficient\nfor their occurrence were already in place long before she even\nexisted! \nHere is an incompatibilist argument that codifies the considerations\nset out above: \nFor ease of reference and discussion throughout this entry, let us\nsimplify the above argument as follows: \nCall this simplified argument the Source Incompatibilist\nArgument. It is important to see that the demand for alternative\npossibilities is not (at least not obviously) relevant to this\nincompatibilist argument. Suppose that a putatively freely willing\nagent had access to the relevant sort of alternative possibilities.\nAccording to the Source Incompatibilist Argument, a further\ncondition is that she must have been the ultimate source of her freely\nwilled actions. That is, the sourcehood theorist denies that\nalternative possibilities are enough to guarantee freedom. \nIn response to these arguments, compatibilists have denied that\nfreedom requires the ability to do otherwise; that causal determinism\nprecludes the ability to do otherwise; and that freedom or control\nrequire sourcehood. [Compatibilists have only rarely denied Premise 2\nof the Source Incompatibilist Argument (McKenna 2008 and\nperhaps Bjornsson & Persson 2012 are important exceptions.] But\ncompatibilists’s denials of these premises have not been\nflatfooted. Instead they are grounded in attractive conceptions of\nhuman agency. So in what follows, we’ll turn to the details of\nsuch theories, and in so doing, uncover just how distinct\ncompatibilist theories answer the incompatibilist arguments set out\nabove.  \nCompatibilism’s place in contemporary philosophy has developed\nin at least three stages. The first stage involves the classical form\nof compatibilism, which was developed in the modern era by the\nempiricists Hobbes and Hume, and reinvigorated in the early part of\nthe twentieth century. The second stage involves three distinct\ncontributions in the 1960s, contributions that challenged many of the\ndialectical presuppositions driving classical compatibilism. The third\nstage involves various contemporary forms of compatibilism, forms that\ndiverge from the classical variety and that emerged out of, or\nresonate with, at least one of the three contributions found in the\nsecond transitional stage. This section is devoted to the first stage,\nthat of classical compatibilism. \nAccording to one strand within classical compatibilism, freedom is\nnothing more than an agent’s ability to do what she wishes in\nthe absence of impediments that would otherwise stand in her way. For\ninstance, Hobbes offers an exemplary expression of classical\ncompatibilism when he claims that a person’s freedom consists in\nhis finding “no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or\ninclination to doe [sic]” (Leviathan, p.108). On\nthis view, freedom involves two components, a positive and a negative\none. The positive component (doing what one wills, desires, or\ninclines to do) consists in nothing more than what is involved in the\npower of agency. The negative component (finding “no\nstop”) consists in acting unencumbered or unimpeded. Typically,\nthe classical compatibilists’ benchmark of impeded or encumbered\naction is compelled action. Compelled action arises when one is forced\nby some external source to act contrary to one’s will. \nFor the classical compatibilist, then, free will is an ability to do\nwhat one wants. It is therefore plausible to conclude that the truth\nof determinism does not entail that agents lack free will since it\ndoes not entail that agents never do what they wish to do, nor that\nagents are necessarily encumbered in acting. Compatibilism is thus\nvindicated. \nBut how convincing is the classical compatibilist account of free\nwill? As it stands, it cries out for refinement. To cite just one\nshortcoming, various mental illnesses can cause a person to act as she\nwants and do so unencumbered; yet, intuitively, it would seem that she\ndoes not act of her own free will. For example, imagine a person\nsuffering from a form of psychosis that causes full-fledged\nhallucinations. While hallucinating, she might “act as she wants\nunencumbered,” but she could hardly be said to be acting of her\nown free will. Consequently, the classical compatibilist owes us more.\nTo see how it might be supplemented, we turn to a distinctively\nincompatibilist way of undermining classical compatibilism \nConsider the following incompatibilist objection to the classical\ncompatibilist account of free will: \nIf determinism is true, and if at any given time, an unimpeded agent\nis completely determined to have the wants that she does have, and if\nthose wants causally determine her actions, then, even though she does\ndo what she wants to do, she cannot ever do otherwise. She\nsatisfies the classical compatibilist conditions for free will. But\nfree will requires the ability to do otherwise, and determinism is\nincompatible with this. Hence, the classical compatibilist account of\nfree will is inadequate. Determinism is incompatible with free will\nand moral responsibility because determinism is incompatible with the\nability to do otherwise. \nThe classical compatibilist account of freedom set out thus far can be\nthought of as accounting for one-way freedom, which fixes\nonly on what a person does do, not on what alternatives she had to\nwhat she did. The incompatibilist challenge at issue here is that such\nfreedom, even if necessary, is insufficient in the absence of a\nfurther freedom to do other than as one does.  \nClassical compatibilists have responded by arguing that determinism\nis compatible with the ability to do otherwise. To show this,\nthey attempted to analyze an agent’s ability to do otherwise in\nconditional terms (e.g., Hume, Enquiry Concerning Human\nUnderstanding, p.73; Ayer 1954; or Hobart 1934). Since\ndeterminism is a thesis about what must happen in the future given\nthe actual past, determinism is consistent with the future being\ndifferent given a different past. So the classical\ncompatibilists analyzed any assertion that an agent could have done\notherwise as a conditional assertion reporting what an agent would\nhave done under certain counterfactual conditions. These conditions\ninvolved variations on what a freely willing agent wanted (chose,\nwilled, or decided) to do at the time of her freely willed action.\nSuppose that an agent freely willed X. According to the\nclassical compatibilist conditional analysis, to say that, at\nthe time of acting, she could have done Y and not X\nis just to say that, had she wanted (chosen, willed, or\ndecided) to do Y and not X at that time,\nthen she would have done Y and not done X.\nHer ability to have done otherwise at the time at which she acted\nconsisted in some such counterfactual truth. \nBut given that a determined agent is determined at the time of action\nto have the wants that she does have, how is it helpful to state what\nshe would have done had she had different wants than the wants that\nshe did have? Assuming the truth of determinism, at the time at which\nshe acted she could have had no other wants than the wants that her\ncausal history determined her to have.  \nIn response, the classical compatibilist holds that that the\nconditional analysis brings into relief a rich picture of freedom. In\nassessing an agent’s action, the analysis accurately\ndistinguishes those actions she would have performed if she wanted,\nfrom those actions she could not have performed even if she wanted.\nThis, the classical compatibilist held, effectively distinguishes\nthose alternative courses of action that were within the scope of the\nagent’s abilities at the time of action, from those courses of\naction that were not. This just is the distinction between what an\nagent was free to do and what she was not free to do. This is not at\nall a superficial freedom; it demarcates what persons have within\ntheir control from what falls outside that purview. \nDespite the classical compatibilists’ ingenuity, their analysis\nof could have done otherwise failed decisively. The classical\ncompatibilists wanted to show their incompatibilist interlocutors that\nwhen one asserted that a freely willing agent had alternatives\navailable to her—that is, when it was asserted that she could\nhave done otherwise—that assertion could be analyzed as a\nconditional statement, a statement that is perspicuously compatible\nwith determinism. But as it turned out, the analysis was refuted when\nit was shown that the conditional statements sometimes yielded the\nimproper result that a person was able to do otherwise even though it\nwas clear that at the time the person acted, she had no such\nalternative and therefore was not able to do otherwise in the\npertinent sense (Chisholm 1964, in Watson (ed.) 1982, pp.26–7;\nor van Inwagen 1983, pp. 114–9). Here is such an example: \nSuppose that Danielle is psychologically incapable of wanting to touch\na blond haired dog. Imagine that, on her sixteenth birthday, unaware\nof her condition, her father brings her two puppies to choose between,\none being a blond haired Lab, the other a black haired Lab. He tells\nDanielle just to pick up whichever of the two she pleases and that he\nwill return the other puppy to the pet store. Danielle happily, and\nunencumbered, does what she wants and picks up the black Lab. \nWhen Danielle picked up the black Lab, was she able to pick up the\nblond Lab? It seems not. Picking up the blond Lab was an alternative\nthat was not available to her. In this respect, she could not have\ndone otherwise. Given her psychological condition, she cannot\neven form a want to touch a blond Lab, hence she could not pick one\nup. But notice that, if she wanted to pick up the blond Lab,\nthen she would have done so. Of course, if she wanted to pick\nup the blond Lab, then she would not suffer from the very\npsychological disorder that causes her to be unable to pick up blond\nhaired doggies. The classical compatibilist analysis of ‘could\nhave done otherwise’ thus fails. According to the analysis, when\nDanielle picked up the black Lab, she was able to pick up the\nblonde Lab, even though, due to her psychological condition, she\nwas not able to do so in the relevant respect. Hence, the\nanalysis yields the wrong result. \nSo even if an unencumbered agent does what she wants, if she is\ndetermined, at least as the incompatibilist maintains, she could not\nhave done otherwise. Since, as the objection goes, freedom of will\nrequires freedom involving alternative possibilities, classical\ncompatibilist freedom falls. \nThe classical compatibilists failed to answer the Classical\nIncompatibilist Argument. What they attempted to do by way of the\nconditional analysis was deny the claim that if determinism is true,\nno one can do otherwise. But, given their failure, it was incumbent\nupon them to respond to the argument in some manner. It is only\ndialectically fair to acknowledge that determinism does pose a\nprima facie threat to free will when free will is understood\nas requiring the ability to do otherwise. The Classical\nIncompatibilist Argument is merely a codification of this natural\nthought. In light of the failure of the classical\ncompatibilists’ conditional analysis, the burden of proof rests\nsquarely on the compatibilists. How can the freedom to do otherwise be\nreconciled with determinism? As we’ll see below, contemporary\ncompatibilists attempt to speak to this issue. \nIn the 1960s, three major contributions to the free will debate\nradically altered it. One was an incompatibilist argument that put\ncrisply the intuition that a determined agent lacks control over\nalternatives. This argument, first developed by Carl Ginet, came to be\nknown as the Consequence Argument (Ginet 1966). Another\ncontribution was Harry Frankfurt’s argument against the\nPrinciple of Alternative Possibilities (PAP), a principle\nstating that an agent is morally responsible for what she does only if\nshe can do otherwise (Frankfurt 1969). Finally, P.F. Strawson\ndefended compatibilism by inviting both compatibilists and\nincompatibilists to attend more carefully to the central role of\ninterpersonal relationships and the reactive attitudes in\nunderstanding the concept of moral responsibility (Strawson 1962).\nEach of these contributions changed dramatically the way that the free\nwill problem is addressed in contemporary discussions. No account of\nfree will, compatibilist or incompatibilist, is advanced today without\ntaking into account at least one (if not more) of these three\npieces. \nThis argument invokes a compelling pattern of inference (one that is\nperhaps lurking in the background of the Classical Incompatibilist\nArgument) regarding claims about what is power necessary for\na person. Power necessity, as applied to true propositions (or facts),\nconcerns what is not within a person’s power. Or, put\ndifferently, it concerns facts that a person does not have power over.\nTo say that a person does not have power over a fact is to say\nthat she cannot act in such a way that the fact would not obtain.\nTo illustrate, no person has power over the truths of mathematics.\nThat is, no person can act in such a way that the truths of\nmathematics would be false. Hence, the truths of mathematics are, for\nany person, power necessities. \nThe intuitive pattern of inference applied to these claims is this. If\na person has no power over a certain fact, and if she also has no\npower over the further fact that the original fact has some other fact\nas a consequence, then she also has no power over the consequent fact.\nPowerlessness, it seems, transfers from one fact to its consequences.\nFor example, if poker-playing Diamond Jim, who is holding only two\npairs, has no power over the fact that Calamity Sam draws a straight\nflush, and if a straight flush beats two pairs (and assuming Jim has\nno power to alter this fact), then it follows that Jim has no power\nover the fact that Sam’s hand beats Jim’s. This general\npattern of inference is applied to the thesis of causal determinism to\nyield a powerful argument for incompatibilism. The argument requires\nthe assumption that determinism is true, and that the facts of the\npast and the laws of nature are fixed. Given these assumptions, here\nis a rough, non-technical sketch of the argument: \nAccording to the Consequence Argument, if determinism is\ntrue, it appears that no person has any power to alter how her own\nfuture will unfold. \nThis argument shook compatibilists, and rightly so. The classical\ncompatibilists’ failure to analyze statements of an\nagent’s abilities in terms of counterfactual conditionals left\nthe compatibilists with no perspicuous retort to the crucial second\npremise of the Classical Incompatibilist Argument. And the Consequence\nArgument provides powerful support for this argument’s second\npremise. If, according to the Argument, determinism implies that the\nfuture will unfold in only one way given the past and the laws, and if\nno one has any power to alter its unfolding in that particular way,\nthen it seems that no one can do other than she does. \nIt is fair to say that the Consequence Argument earned the\nincompatibilists an important dialectical advantage. Compatibilists\nowe us an account of what’s was wrong with the Consequence\nArgument, and perhaps also, some positive account of the ability to do\notherwise. So even though many compatibilists are committed to\nthinking that the Consequence Argument is unsound, it nevertheless set\nthe agenda for many contemporary compatibilist theories of free will\nand moral responsibility. \nOne compatibilist strategy for responding to the Classical\nIncompatibilist Argument is to concede that perhaps the Consequence\nArgument provides us with good reason for thinking that determinism\nrules out the ability to do otherwise while maintaining that such an\nability is not necessary for free will. In other words, the\ncompatibilist might sidestep the issues raised by the Consequence\nArgument by directly attacking the first premise of the Classical\nIncompatibilist Argument, which states is if a person acts of her own\nfree will, then she could have done otherwise. This compatibilist\nresponse rejects a conception of human agency that locates control in\nthe ability to do otherwise. Alternatively, it seeks to ground an\nagent’s control over his action in other features of his or her\nagency. In “Alternate Possibilities and Moral\nResponsibility,” (1969) Harry Frankfurt powerfully develops an\nargument that gives compatibilists the resources to argue in just this\nway. \nFrankfurt’s argument was directed against the Principle of\nAlternative Possibilities (PAP): \nPAP: A person is morally responsible for what she does do\nonly if she can do otherwise. \nCentral to Frankfurt’s attack on PAP are a class of examples in\nwhich an agent is morally responsible for her conduct, but could not,\nat the time of the pertinent action, do otherwise. Here is a close\napproximation to the example Frankfurt presented in his original\npaper: \nJones has resolved to shoot Smith. Black has learned of Jones’s\nplan and wants Jones to shoot Smith. But Black would prefer that Jones\nshoot Smith on his own. However, concerned that Jones might waver in\nhis resolve to shoot Smith, Black secretly arranges things so that, if\nJones should show any sign at all that he will not shoot Smith\n(something Black has the resources to detect), Black will be able to\nmanipulate Jones in such a way that Jones will shoot Smith. As things\ntranspire, Jones follows through with his plans and shoots Smith for\nhis own reasons. No one else in any way threatened or coerced Jones,\noffered Jones a bribe, or even suggested that he shoot Smith. Jones\nshot Smith under his own steam. Black never intervened. \nIn this example, Jones shot Smith on his own, and did so unencumbered\n— did so freely. But, given Black’s presence in the\nscenario, Jones could not have failed to shoot Smith (i.e., he could\nnot have done otherwise). Hence, we have a counterexample to PAP. \nIf Frankfurt’s argument against PAP is sound, the free will\ndebate has been systematically miscast through much of the history of\nphilosophy. If determinism threatens free will and moral\nresponsibility, it is not because it is incompatible with the\nability to do otherwise. Even if determinism is incompatible\nwith a sort of freedom involving the ability to do otherwise, it\nis not the kind of freedom required for moral responsibility. \nPerhaps not surprisingly, an enormous (and intricate) literature has\nemerged around the success of Frankfurt’s argument and, in\nparticular, around the example Frankfurt offered as contrary to PAP.\nThe debate is very much alive, and no clear victor has emerged (in the\nway that the incompatibilists can rightly claim to have laid to rest\nthe compatibilists’ conditional analysis strategy (see section\n3.3)). Regardless, what is most relevant to this essay is that\nFrankfurt’s argument inspired many compatibilists to begin\nthinking about accounts of freedom or control that unabashedly turn\naway from alternative possibilities. \nIn “Freedom and Resentment” (1962), P.F. Strawson broke\nranks with the classical compatibilists. Strawson developed three\ndistinct arguments for compatibilism, arguments quite different from\nthose the classical compatibilists endorsed. But more valuable than\nhis arguments was his general theory of what moral responsibility is,\nand hence, what is at stake in arguing about it. Strawson held that\nboth the incompatibilists and the compatibilists had misconstrued the\nnature of moral responsibility. Each disputant, Strawson suggested,\nadvanced arguments in support of or against a distorted simulacrum of\nthe real deal. \nTo understand moral responsibility properly, Strawson invited his\nreader to consider the reactive attitudes one has towards\nanother when she recognizes in another’s conduct an attitude of\nill will. The reactions that flow naturally from witnessing ill will\nare themselves attitudes that are directed at the perpetrator’s\nintentions or attitudes. When a perpetrator wrongs a person, she, the\nwronged party, typically has a personal reactive attitude of\nresentment. When the perpetrator wrongs another, some third party, the\nnatural reactive attitude is moral indignation, which amounts to a\n“vicarious analogue” of resentment felt on behalf of the\nwronged party. When one is oneself the wronging party, reflecting upon\nor coming to realize the wrong done to another, the natural reactive\nattitude is guilt. \nStrawson wanted contestants to the free will debate to see more\nclearly than they had that excusing a person — electing not to\nhold her blameworthy — involves more than some objective\njudgment that she did not do such and such, or did not intend so and\nso, and therefore does not merit some treatment or other. It involves\na suspension or withdrawal of certain morally reactive attitudes,\nattitudes involving emotional responses. On Strawson’s view,\nwhat it is to hold a person morally responsible for wrong conduct\nis nothing more than the propensity towards, or the\nsustaining of, a moral reactive attitude like indignation. Crucially,\nthe indignation is in response to the perceived attitude of ill will\nor culpable motive in the conduct of the person being held\nresponsible. Hence, Strawson explains, posing the question of whether\nthe entire framework of moral responsibility should be given up as\nirrational (if it were discovered that determinism is true) is\ntantamount to posing the question of whether persons in the\ninterpersonal community — that is, in real life — should\nforswear having reactive attitudes towards persons who wrong others,\nand who sometimes do so intentionally. Strawson invites us to see that\nthe morally reactive attitudes that are the constitutive basis of our\nmoral responsibility practices, as well as the interpersonal relations\nand expectations that give structure to these attitudes, are deeply\ninterwoven into human life. These attitudes, relations and\nexpectations are so much an expression of natural, basic features of\nour social lives — of their emotional textures — that it\nis practically inconceivable to imagine how they could be\ngiven up. \nThree major contributions in the 1960s profoundly altered the face of\ncompatibilism: the incompatibilists’ Consequence Argument,\nFrankfurt’s attack on the Principle of Alternative Possibilities\n(PAP), and Strawson’s focus upon the reactive attitudes. Every\nresultant compatibilist account in the contemporary literature is\nshaped in some way by at least one of these influences. This section\nwill focus upon six of the most significant contemporary compatibilist\npositions. Those wishing to learn about cutting edge work can read the\nsupplement on\n Compatibilism: The State of the Art. \nThe Consequence Argument (section 3.1) makes a strong case for the\nincompatibility of determinism and the freedom to do otherwise.\nAssuming that determinism is true, it states that: \nCompatibilists who accept that alternative possibilities are necessary\nfor moral responsibility must show what is wrong with this powerful\nargument. They also should offer some account of what John Martin\nFischer (1994) has called regulative control—a form of\ncontrol agents possess when they can bring about X and can refrain\nfrom bringing about X— that makes clear how it is possible even\nat a determined world. We will first consider three different\ncompatibilist attempts to unseat the Consequence Argument. Then we\nwill consider how some compatibilists, the so-called New\nDispositionalists, explain regulative control, that is, how they might\nexplain the freedom to do otherwise in a way that is compatible with\ncausal determinism. \nSome compatibilists have argued against the first premise of the\nConsequence Argument by attempting to show that a person can\nact in such a way that the past would be different. Consider the\ndifference between a person in the present who has the ability to act\nin such a way that she alters the past, as opposed to a\nperson who has the ability to act in such a way such that, if she\ndid so act, the past would have been different. Notice that the\nformer ability is outlandish; it would require magical powers. But the\nlatter ability is, at least by comparison, uncontroversial. It merely\nindicates that a person who acted a certain way at a certain time\npossessed abilities to act in various sorts of ways. Had she exercised\none of those abilities, and thereby acted differently, then the past\nleading up to her action would have been different. To illustrate how\ncomparatively mild such a claim about an agent’s ability and the\npast might be, think about a logically similar sort of claim that is\nsimply about what would be required for an agent to act differently.\nFor example, consider the claim, If I were dancing on the French\nRiviera right now, I’d be a lot richer than I am. Certainly\nthis claim does not mean that if I go to the French Riviera to dance,\nI will thereby be made richer. It only means that were I to\nhave gone there to tango, I would have to have had a lot more cash\nbeforehand in order to finance my escapades. Some compatibilists\n(e.g., Saunders 1968; Perry 2010; Dorr 2016) have argued that\nincompatibilist defenders of the Consequence Argument rely upon the\noutlandish notion of ability in the first premise of their argument.\nBut, these compatibilists maintain, the first premise is falsified\nwhen interpreted with a milder notion of ability. \nOther compatibilists have argued against the first premise of the\nConsequence Argument in a parallel way by attempting to show that a\nperson can act in such a way that a law of nature would not\nobtain. As with the distinction drawn regarding ability and the past,\nconsider the difference between a person who has the ability to act in\nsuch a way that she violates a law of nature, as opposed to a\nperson (at a deterministic world) who has the ability to act in such a\nway that, if she were to so act, some law of nature that does\nobtain would not. Notice that the former ability would require\nmagical powers. According to the compatibilist, the latter, by\ncontrast, would require nothing outlandish. It merely tells us that a\nperson who acted a certain way at a certain time possessed abilities\nto act in various sorts of ways. Had she exercised one of those\nabilities, and thereby acted differently, then the laws of nature that\nwould have entailed what she did in that hypothetical situation would\nbe different from the actual laws of nature that did entail what she\ndid actually do. This latter ability does not assume that agents are\nable to violate laws of nature; it just assumes that whatever the laws\nof nature are (at least at deterministic worlds), they must be such as\nto entail, given the past, what an agent will do. If an agent acts\ndifferently in some possible world than she acts in the actual world,\nthen some other set of laws will be the ones that entail what she does\nin that world. Some compatibilists (most notably Lewis 1981, but see\nalso Graham 2008 and Pendergraft 2011), fixing upon ability\npertaining to the laws of nature, have argued that incompatibilist\ndefenders of the Consequence Argument rely upon the outlandish notion\nof ability in the first premise of their argument. But, these\ncompatibilists maintain, that first premise is falsified when\ninterpreted with an uncontroversial notion of ability. \nMichael Slote (1982) attempted to refute the Consequence Argument by\nshowing that its central inference is invalid. The central point\ntowards which Slote works is that notions like unavoidability\n(or power necessity) are sensitive to contexts in a way that\nonly “selectively” permits the sort of inference at work\nin the Consequence Argument. Let us work with the idea of\nunavoidability. According to Slote, when we say that something is\nunavoidable for a person, we have in mind “selective”\ncontexts in which the facts pertaining to the unavoidability have\nnothing to do with that person — the facts bypass that\nperson’s agency altogether (Slote 1982, p.19). It is\nunavoidable for me, for instance, that Caesar crossed the Rubicon, or\nthat most motor vehicles now run on gasoline. Nothing about my agency\n— about what I can do — can alter such facts. This\nsuggests that unavoidability is misapplied when it concerns aspects of\na person’s own agency. But notice that in the Consequence\nArgument unavoidability (or power necessity) trades between a context\nin which the notion is appropriately applied, and one in which,\naccording to Slote, it is not. The first premise cites considerations\nthat have nothing to do with a person’s agency — facts\nprior to her birth, and the laws of nature. It is claimed that these\nfacts are unavoidable for a person, but from this a conclusion is\ndrawn that the very actions a person performs are unavoidable for her.\nYet this, Slote and other compatibilists (such as Dennett 1984a;\nMcKay & Johnson 1996) have suggested, is to draw incompatibilist\nconclusions illicitly from reasonable claims regarding\nunavoidability. \nEven if some compatibilist reply proves that the Consequence Argument\nis unsound, this alone would not amount to a positive argument for\ncompatibilism. It would merely mean that one key argument for the\nincompatibility of determinism and regulative control is untenable.\nBut that is consistent with the incompatibility of\ndeterminism and regulative control. Indeed, some argue for this\nincompatibility without relying upon the potentially problematic\nassumptions about power necessity at work in the Consequence Argument\n(Fischer 1994; and Ginet 1990, 2003). Furthermore, even if the\ncompatibilist could discredit all current arguments for the\nincompatibility of determinism and regulative control, it still\nbehooves her to offer a positive argument demonstrating the\ncompatibility of determinism and regulative control. Compatibilists\nwishing to defend regulative control, such Berofsky (1987, 1995,\n2012), Campbell (1997), Nelkin (2011), and Vihvelin (2013), still have\ntheir work cut out for them. \nRecently several compatibilists have offered a positive account of\nregulative control (e.g., Fara 2008; M. Smith 2003; and Vihvelin 2004,\n2013). Call the view these compatibilists advance, the new\ndispositionalism. \nIn advancing a compatibilist thesis, Vihvelin speaks of the ability to\ndo otherwise (and especially choose otherwise) in terms of a bundle of\ndispositions (2004, p. 429). Likewise, Fara proposes a dispositional\nanalysis of the ability to do otherwise. And Smith speaks of the\nrational capacities to believe and desire otherwise (and so,\npresumably, do otherwise) in terms of a “raft of\npossibilities” (2003, p.27). For Fara, Vihvelin, and Smith, we\nassess claims about the disposition constitutive of the ability to do\notherwise, or the dispositions in the bundle, or the possibilities in\nthe raft, by attending to the intrinsic properties of an agent in\nvirtue of which she acts when she tries (Fara 2008, p.861), or the\ncausal bases of the pertinent dispositions (Vihvelin 2004, p. 436), or\nthe underlying structure of a rational capacity (Smith, p. 29). How\nso?  Fara does not say, though it seems likely he would agree to\nsomething like the proposals offered by Vihvelin and Smith. According\nto them, we hold fixed the relevant causal base or underlying\nstructure of an agent’s disposition to, say, wave hello to a\nfriend, or tell the truth under interrogation, and we consider various\ncounterfactual conditions in which that causal base or underlying\nstructure operates unimpaired. Does the agent in an appropriately rich\nrange of such counterfactual conditions wave hello or tell the truth?\nIf she does, then even if in the actual world she does not wave hello\nor tell the truth, she was able to do so. She had at the time of\naction the pertinent agential abilities or capacities. And this is\ntrue even if that world is determined (see, e.g., Vihvelin 2004,\n437). Why?  Because there is no basis for contending that when we test\nthe relevant dispositions at other possible worlds, we have to\nrestrict the worlds to ones in which we hold fixed the past and the\nlaws. Note how the problems with the classical compatibilists’\ncounterfactual analysis are circumvented. If we are attending to the\ncausal base of the relevant dispositions, we can easily see how\nDanielle’s relevant causal base is ill-equipped for picking up\nblond haired dogs. \nThe new dispositionalism clearly improves upon classical\ncompatibilism. But how does it fare in its own right? Do we have here\na compelling positive account of the ability—and so the\nfreedom—to do otherwise that is compatible with determinism? One\nslippery matter has to do with the way the relevant worlds are\nidentified in the preceding paragraph. We have to restrict our\nattention to possible worlds in which the causal base of, or\nunderlying structure for, the ability operates unimpaired. Some will\nclaim that this restriction is not dialectically innocent. Consider a\nFrankfurt example (section 4.2). Suppose Jones freely shoots Smith,\nbut if he were about to do otherwise, Black would cause Jones to do so\nagainst his (Jones’s) will. When Jones shoots Smith on his own,\nhe does so freely and is morally responsible, despite the fact that,\ndue to Black’s presence, he was not free to do otherwise. Fara\n(2008, pp.854–5), Nelkin (2012), Smith (2003, p. 19), and\nVihvelin (2000, 2004, pp.445–8, 2013) say otherwise. They say\nJones could have done otherwise, was able to do otherwise, and was\nfree to do otherwise when he shot Smith on his own. Why? Roughly,\nbecause if we fix on the underlying causal structure implicated in\nSmith’s shooting Jones on his own, and if we go only to other\nworlds in which that causal structure operates unimpeded, we will rule\nout worlds in which the counterfactual intervener Black is at play.\nThen we will be able to specify a range of true counterfactuals in\nwhich an agent had some reason, for instance, to do otherwise, and she\ndid otherwise. The delicate question here, one which we will not\nattempt to resolve, is whether in accounting for the freedom to do\notherwise the new dispositionalists are entitled to restrict\nattention only to worlds in which the relevant causal base operates\nunimpeded. \nOther compatibilists, most notably, John Martin Fischer (1994), and\nFischer and Mark Ravizza (1998) (see section 5.5 below), have appealed\nto similar restrictions. But in doing so, they only mean to explain\nthe nature of the freedom or control exhibited in how the agent did\nact—that is, what Fischer has termed her guidance\ncontrol. In striking contrast to how the new dispositionalists\nreason, they do not think they are thereby entitled to claim that an\nagent in a Frankfurt example is free to do otherwise. So it is\npossible that what the new dispositionalists have identified with the\npertinent counterfactuals they fix upon is not the freedom to do\notherwise, but instead, a freedom located in what an agent does do\n(which is a matter of guidance control, not regulative control). This,\nat least, is how compatibilists like Fischer and Ravizza would reason.\n[For a lively debate over just this issue, see the exchange between\nFischer (2008) and Vihvelin (2008).] \nOn the back of his rejection of the Principle of Alternative\nPossibilities, Harry Frankfurt (1971) developed a compatibilist theory\nthat does not appeal to regulative control in any way.\nFrankfurt’s hierarchical mesh theory can instead be\nseen as a development of classical compatibilist attempts to\nunderstand freedom in terms of an agent’s unencumbered ability\nto get what she wants (see Section 3.1.). More precisely, Frankfurt\nexplains freely willed action in terms of actions that issue from\ndesires that suitably mesh with hierarchically ordered elements of a\nperson’s psychology. The key idea is that a person who acts of\nher own free will acts from desires that are nested within more\nencompassing elements of her self. On this view, when a freely willing\nagent acts, her actions emanate from her rather than from\nsomething foreign. \nFrankfurt distinguishes between first-order and second-order desires.\nThis serves as the basis for his hierarchical account of freedom. The\nformer desires have as their objects actions, such as eating a slice\nof cheesecake, taking in a movie, or gyrating one’s hips to the\nsweet sounds of B. B. King. The latter are desires about desires. They\nhave as their objects, desires of the first-order, such as the desire\nto have the motivation to exercise daily (something that, regrettably,\ntoo many of us lack): “If only I wanted to go to the\ngym today, then it would be easy for me to get my tail off this\ncouch!” \nAmongst the first-order desires that a person has, some are ones that\ndo not move her to action, such as one’s (unsatisfied)\ndesire to say to her boss what she knows that she should not. Other\nfirst-order desires, however, do move a person to action,\nsuch as one’s (satisfied) desire to follow through on her\nboss’s request. Frankfurt identifies an agent’s\nwill with her effective first-order desire, the one moving a\nperson, as Frankfurt puts it, “all the way to action”\n(1971, p. 84). \nFrankfurt also distinguishes between different sorts of second-order\ndesires. Some are merely desires to have first-order desires, but\nnot that those first-order desires would comprise her will.\nFrankfurt uses the example of a psychotherapist who wishes to\nexperience a desire for narcotics so as to understand a patient\nbetter. The therapist has no wish that this desire be effective in\nleading her to action (1971, pp.84–5). She wants to know what it\nis like to feel the craving for the drug; she has no wish to take it.\nOn the other hand, other second-order desires that a person has are\ndesires for effective first-order desires, desires that would\ncomprise her will, and would thereby be effective in moving her all\nthe way to action. For instance, the dieter who is constantly\nfrustrated by her sugar cravings might desire a more effective desire\nfor health, one that would be more effective in guiding her eating\nhabits than it often is. These second-order desires Frankfurt calls\nsecond-order volitions. There is no theoretical limit to how\nhighly-ordered one’s desires might be. The dieter in the above\nexample might develop a third-order desire for her second-order desire\n(regarding her desire for health) not to play such a dominant role in\nher daily deliberations. Other things, she might reason, are of more\nimportance in life than concerning herself with her dietary\nmotivations. \nOnce this conceptual apparatus is in place, Frankfurt contrasts\ndifferent sorts of addicts to illustrate his concept of free will.\nConsider first the unwilling addict, who is someone that has\nboth a first-order desire to take the drug, and a first-order desire\nnot to take the drug. Crucially, however, the unwilling addict also\nhas a second-order volition that her first-order desire to take the\ndrug not be her will. This is the basis for her\nunwillingness. Regrettably, her irresistible addictive desire to take\nthe drug constitutes her will. Next, consider the case of the\nwilling addict. The willing addict, like the unwilling\naddict, has conflicting first-order desires as regards taking the drug\nto which she is addicted. But the willing addict, by way of a\nsecond-order volition, embraces her addictive first-order desire to\ntake the drug. She wants to be as she is and act as she does. \nIt is now easy to illustrate Frankfurt’s hierarchical theory of\nfree will. The unwilling addict does not take the drug of her own free\nwill since her will conflicts at a higher level with what she wishes\nit to be. The willing addict, however, takes the drug of her own free\nwill since her will meshes with what she wishes it to be.\nFrankurt’s theory can now be set out as follows: \nOne acts of her own free will if and only if her action issues from\nthe will she wants. \nIt might seem strange that Frankfurt’s willing addict acts of\nher own free will since, due to her addiction, she could not do\notherwise. But recall that Frankfurt does not believe that freedom\ninvolving alternative possibilities is required for moral\nresponsibility. Frankfurt instead believes that the freedom pertinent\nto moral responsibility concerns what an agent does do and her actual\nbasis for doing it. That is, Frankfurt believes that it is, to again\nreturn to Fischer’s helpful distinction, guidance control that\nis necessary for moral responsibility, not regulative control. The\nwilling addict possesses the sort of freedom required for moral\nresponsibility because the will leading to her action is the one that\nshe wishes it to be; she acts with guidance control. \nFrankfurt’s hierarchical theory has faced intense scrutiny. Here\nwe consider two objections that emerge from structural aspects of it.\nOne has to do with its hierarchical nature. The other has to do with\nits relying exclusively upon a mesh between different features of an\nagent’s psychology. (For a discussion of Frankfurt’s\nattempts to respond to these problems, see section A of the\nsupplement,\n Compatibilism: The State of the Art.) \nConsider the hierarchical problem. According to Frankfurt, a\nperson facing a problem with regard to her will’s freedom faces\na situation in which she is conflicted about one (or more) of her\nfirst-order desires. Which desire “speaks for” the agent?\nWith which desire can she be identified? To resolve conflicts between\nfirst-order desires (or between an agent’s attitudes about a\nspecific first-order desire), Frankfurt tells us that a person forms a\nsecond-order desire that has as its object the first-order desire(s)\nshe wants to move her to action. By this means, an agent endorses or\nidentifies with one of the first-order desires and, if all goes\nsmoothly, that one becomes her will. Through this process, she draws\nwithin the sphere of her self one sort of desire and alienates\nanother. But here, a problem arises. A person cannot be identified\nwith her first-order desires because she can be alienated from them.\nYet she can also be alienated from second, or even at higher-orders\n(Watson 1975). After all, she might find herself both wanting that\nsome specific first-order desire be her will and horrified at the\nthought (i.e., not want it to be the case that that particular\nfirst-order desire be her will). Hence, the problem of an\nagent’s free will can reappear at these ever ascending stages.\nIf this is correct, Frankfurt’s view is incomplete. Maybe his\naccount of free will does articulate a necessary condition for acting\nof one’s own free will, but it appears not to be sufficient. It\nneeds supplementing so as to avoid the problem of a spiraling\nreoccurrence of challenges to an agent’s freedom. \nNext consider the mesh problem. According to Frankfurt, if\nfreely willed action for which an agent is morally responsible wholly\ndepends on the relation between an agent’s will and her\nsecond-order volitions, then it does not matter in any way how an\nagent came to have that particular mesh. But cases can be constructed\nthat seem to suggest that it does matter how an agent came to\nhave a particular mesh between her first-order and her second-order\ndesires. (For example, see Slote 1980; and Fischer & Ravizza 1998,\npp. 194–206.) Using Frankfurt’s own example of the willing\naddict, suppose that the addict’s second-order willingness is\nitself caused by the effects of the drug use. Suppose that the drug\nuse has impaired her evaluations or preferences arising at a\nsecond-order of reflection on her own mental states. Or, setting this\nsort of case aside, imagine that an agent is brainwashed or\nmanipulated through some means or another, say by hypnosis, or by\naliens zapping a person into having a different set of psychological\npreferences than those that she would otherwise have. In all of these\ncases—just call them manipulation cases—Frankfurt\nseems committed to the view that such agents act of their own free\nwill and are morally responsible so long as the appropriate\npsychological mesh is in place, no matter what sort of (merely\napparent) freedom and responsibility-undermining history gave way to\nan agent’s having that particular mesh. \nThis highlights the real difficulty Frankfurt’s view faces in\nlight of the Source Incompatibilist Argument. Since Frankfurt holds\nthat what matters for moral responsibility is the relationship between\nan agent’s effective first-order desire and her second-order\nvolition, and not the source of those respective desires, he is\ncommitted to thinking that even if the desires are implanted by some\nalien force, the agent can still be responsible for acting on them.\nBut many have found it dubious that an agent could be responsible for\nan action that flows from motives that can be traced back to forces\noutside of the agent. In response, Frankfurt must show that being the\nsource of one’s motives is not needed for moral responsibility.\nIf he cannot, then it seems that the source incompatibilist has the\nupper hand. She can straightforwardly argue that, if one sort alien\ncausal history that gives rise to the Frankfurtian mesh undermines\nagents’ freedom and responsibility, then why wouldn’t a\ndeterministic history do the same? \nIn Freedom within Reason (1990), as well as in several\nprovocative papers (1980, 1987), Susan Wolf develops a theory of free\nwill and moral responsibility that highlights a mesh between an\nagent’s action and what she (correctly) regards as valuable. For\nWolf, free will concerns an agent’s ability to act in accord\nwith the True and the Good. Unlike Frankfurt’s, the conditions\nof Wolf’s mesh theory require an anchor external to the\nagent’s internal psychological states (the True and the Good).\nThe crucial question for Wolf concerns whether an agent is able to act\nupon moral reasons. Hence, Wolf embraces the title, The Reason\nView. A related, though importantly different version of the\nReason View has more recently been defended by Nelkin (2011). \nIn her effort to make free will track moral reasons, Wolf (and later\nNelkin) develops a surprising asymmetry thesis according to which\npraiseworthy conduct does not require the freedom to do otherwise but\nblameworthy behavior does (1980; and 1990, pp.79–81). Put in\nterms of guidance and regulative control, only blameworthy conduct\nrequires regulative control. Guidance control is sufficient for\npraiseworthy conduct. Wolf’s reasoning is that, if an agent does\nact in accord with the True and the Good, and if indeed she is so\npsychologically determined that she cannot but act in accord with the\nTrue and the Good, her inability to act otherwise does not threaten\nthe sort of freedom that morally responsible agents need. For how\ncould her freedom be in any way enhanced simply by adding an ability\nto act irrationally? But blameworthy behavior, Wolf reasons, does\nrequire regulative control since, if an agent acts contrary to the\nTrue and the Good, but is so psychologically determined that she\ncannot act in accord with it, then, being unable to act as reason\nrequires, it would be unreasonable to blame her. \nBecause Wolf’s asymmetrical view requires regulative control in\nthe case of blameworthy actions, her compatibilism is open to\nrefutation by incompatibilist arguments designed to show that\ndeterminism is incompatible with freedom involving alternative\npossibilities. As a result, Wolf argues that physical determination\ndoes not entail psychological determination. She then argues that\nphysical determination is consistent with the ability to do otherwise\nbecause the relevant ability is one that only requires the falsity of\npsychological determinism, which is a thesis she takes to have no\nsupport. (Interestingly, this means that although Wolf is a\ncompatibilist about blameworthiness and physical determinism, she is\nan incompatibilist about blameworthiness and psychological\ndeterminsim.) \nWhat about the Source Incompatibilist Argument? On Wolf’s view,\nif an agent does act from reasons, and if her reasons are (or are\nsusceptible to) the True and the Good, then she as an agent is a\nsource of conduct that carries with it (or is able to carry with it)\nthe stamp of moral reason. Enough said. But what about the Source\nIncompatibilist Argument, and the premise concerning ultimacy that\nseems to plague most every brand of compatibilism: A person acts of\nher own free will only if she is its ultimate source? Like\nFrankfurt’s mesh theory, Wolf’s too is endangered by the\nthought that an agent could be artificially manipulated in a\nresponsibility-undermining manner into satisfying the mesh\nWolf’s theory demands. And mightn’t such manipulation be\nno different than the manner in which a deterministic world shapes an\nagent to have the psychological structure and motives she has? Does\nnot the prospect of manipulation cases show that without ultimacy, an\nagent cannot be the proper source of her action? So it appears that\nWolf is at the same crossroads as is Frankfurt. Either she must show\nwhat is defective in the manipulation cases so as to distinguish\nagents so manipulated from the sort of proper mesh demanded by her\ntheory, or she must bite the same bullet and accept that these sorts\nof manipulated agents, by the conditions of her theory, do act of\ntheir own free wills and are morally responsible for their\nconduct. \nSeveral compatibilists have suggested that freely willed actions issue\nfrom volitional features of agency that are sensitive to an\nappropriate range of reasons (see Dennett 1984a; Fingarette 1972;\nGert & Duggan 1979; Glover 1970; MacIntyre 1957; Neely 1974; and\nNozick 1981). Agents who are unresponsive to appropriate rational\nconsiderations (such as compulsives or neurotics) do not act of their\nown free wills. But agents who are responsive to some range\nof rational considerations do. This view has been artfully refined in\nrecent years by Fischer (1987,  1994), and\nsubsequently, Fischer and Ravizza (1998). (For a more advanced\ndiscussion of Fischer and Ravizza’s view, which many regard as\nthe gold standard for contemporary compatibilism, see section B of the\nsupplement\n Compatibilism: The State of the Art.)\n  \nA reasons-responsiveness theory turns upon dispositional\nfeatures of an agent’s relation to reasons issuing in freely\nwilled action. Appropriately reasons-responsive conduct is sensitive\nto rational considerations. Importantly, the view is not merely that\nan agent would display herself in some counterfactual situations to be\nresponsive to reasons, but rather that her responsiveness to reasons\nin some counterfactual situations is evidence that her actual conduct\nitself — the causes giving rise to it —\nis also in response to rational considerations. (Amendments need to be\nadded to accommodate cases of spur-of-the-moment, or impulsive freely\nwilled action.) \nThe most natural way to understand a reasons-responsive theory is in\nterms of an agent’s responsiveness to reasons. To\nillustrate, suppose that Frank Zappa plays the banjo of his own free\nwill. According to a reasons-responsive theory, his playing the banjo\nfreely at that time requires that if, in at least some hypothetical\ncases, he had reason not to, then he would refrain from playing the\nbanjo. For instance, if Jimi Hendrix were to have stepped into\nFrank’s recording studio and asked Frank to play his electric\nguitar, Frank would have wanted to make Jimi happy and thus would have\ngladly put his banjo aside and picked up his electric guitar. It\nseems, then, that for Frank to play the banjo of his own free will,\nFrank — the agent — must have regulative control\nand not merely guidance control over his playing. His freedom must\nconsist partially in his ability to act upon alternatives. \nNotice that, because Frankfurt examples challenge the\nincompatibilists’ demand for regulative control, they also\nchallenge an agent-based reasons-responsive theory (Fischer\n& Ravizza 1998, pp. 34–41). Imagine that the benevolent demon\nJerry Garcia wants Frank to play the banjo at the relevant time. Jerry\nwould much prefer that Frank play the banjo on his own. But worried\nthat Frank might elect not to play the banjo, Jerry covertly arranges\nthings so as to manipulate Frank if the need arises. If Frank should\nshow any indication that he will not play the banjo, Jerry will\nmanipulate Frank so that Frank will play the banjo. Hence, when Frank\ndoes play the banjo uninfluenced by Jerry’s possible\nintervention, he does so of his own free will. But he has neither\nregulative control, nor does he seem to be reasons-responsive, with\nrespect to his banjo playing. Due to Jerry’s presence, he cannot\nbut play the banjo even if Jimi Hendrix were to ask Frank to play\nhis guitar. \nTo alleviate the tension between a reasons-responsive theory and\nFrankfurt examples, Fischer argued that reasons-responsive\ncompatibilism can be cast in such a way that it involves only guidance\ncontrol. Consider the example with Frank, Jimi, and Jerry. Frank did\nnot have regulative control over his playing the banjo since\nJerry’s presence ensured that Frank play the banjo even if Jimi\nwere to ask Frank to play his guitar. The scenario in which Jimi asks\nFrank not to play his banjo is one that Frank normally would\nfind to be a compelling reason to refrain from his banjo playing.\nHence, by his own lights, Frank would find\nJimi’s request compelling. Yet, due to Jerry’s presence,\nFrank is not responsive to such a weighty reason. What would\nbe required to illustrate responsiveness would be to subtract Jerry\nfrom the scenario. This would do the trick. So suppose that Frank\nplays the banjo of his own free will, even with Jerry passively\nstanding by. How can it be shown that Frank’s conduct was, in\nsome manner, reasons-responsive? How can it be shown that what he\nactually did was in response to a reason? Well, if Jimi\nHendrix had asked Frank not to play the banjo but the guitar instead,\nand if Jerry’s presence were to be subtracted from the\nsituation, then Frank would respond to Jimi’s request\nand play the guitar and not the banjo. This suggests that Frank does\nplay the banjo of his own free will even in the actual situation in\nwhich Jerry is passively standing by. \nIllustrating reasons-responsiveness in a Frankfurt example seems to\nrequire recognizing counterfactual conditions in which an agent acts\notherwise in response to reasons. But in a Frankfurt example, one has\nto subtract from those conditions the presence of the ensuring\nconditions (the counterfactual intervener) designed to guarantee that\nthe agent not act otherwise. How can this move be legitimate? How is\nit not just an arbitrary addendum to cram together two compatibilist\nthemes that otherwise appear to be at odds (reasons-responsiveness and\nFrankfurt examples)? It is not arbitrary, and here is why. Think about\nwhat happens in the actual scenario of a Frankfurt example. As things\nunfold, the demon is inactive. The agent acts for her own\nreasons. But now, focusing solely on what the agent does in\nthis actual scenario, and the reasons that give her a basis for doing\nwhat she does, consider what deliberative features of her agency\nplayed the causal role in the actual sequence of events\nbringing about her action. So, just fix upon whatever constitutes that\nnarrower range of agential characteristics within the wider spectrum\nof all of the features that made up Frank Zappa, the agent. Since it\nis only that narrower spectrum that we propose to identify with the\ncausal production of Frank’s conduct, just call it the\nmechanism that produces his action. \nOnce we have located the mechanism of action that is at work in the\nactual causal sequence of a Frankfurt example, we can turn our\nattention to understanding the dispositional features of it\nas a causal mechanism. If other reasons bear upon it, then it\nwould be sensitive to some of those reasons. It would produce\ndifferent conduct in some reasonable range of cases. If it would,\nthen that very mechanism is responsive to reasons. Confirming\nthat that very mechanism is responsive to reasons would not merely\nillustrate that, in scenarios other than the actual, the agent acts\nupon a mechanism sensitive to reasons. It would also illustrate that\nin the Frankfurt scenario in which the agent really does act,\nwhat does play a role in the actual causal sequence of her\naction is some feature of her agency (a mechanism) that\nitself is in fact a response to a reason. \nFischer offers an actual-sequence, mechanism-based,\nreasons-responsive analysis of guidance control. He maintains\nthat his analysis of guidance control is compatible with determinism.\nAccording to Fischer, an agent, and the mechanism of her action, can\nbe entirely determined in the actual sequence of events in which she\nacts. Yet the actual manner in which her mechanism responds to reasons\ncould be appropriately sensitive to reasons such that, if different\nreasons were to bear upon it, it would respond differently, and the\nagent whose mechanism it is would act differently than she does\nact. \nRecently, however, Carolina Sartorio (2016) has argued that\nactual-sequence compatibilist do not need to appeal to mechanisms in\norder to vindicate their theories. According to Sartorio, we can\nexplain Frank’s responsibility by appeal to the actual causes of\nhis behavior, which are, she claims, much richer than has previously\nbeen realized. Not only is his behavior caused by his sensitive to\nreasons there are, on Sartorio’s view, it is also caused by\nthe absence of other reasons (in this case, e.g., the absence\nof Jimi’s request is itself a cause in the actual-sequence).\n \nFischer’s reasons-responsiveness compatibilist starts by\nrejecting the key premise of the Classical Incompatibilist Argument,\nin that it rejects the thesis that freedom of the sort required for\nmoral responsibility requires the ability to do otherwise. But how\ndoes Fischer’s view stack up against the Source Incompatibilist\nArgument? The challenge Fischer faces here, which is pushed forcefully\nby Pereboom (2001) and Mele (2019), is the same as that faced by\nFrankfurt and Wolf. The source incompatibilist maintains that it is a\nnecessary condition of free will that one be an ultimate source of her\naction, and determinism is incompatible with one’s being an\nultimate source of her action. The compatibilist’s task is to\nshow that her treatment of the source of an agent’s conduct is\nsufficient for free will. But the source incompatibilist will point to\nmanipulation cases that suggest that some causal histories giving rise\nto compatibilist-friendly psychological structures, such as\nreasons-responsive mechanisms, are freedom and responsibility\nundermining. If so, then why is determinism any different from a\nmanipulation case? The burden, it seems, is on the compatibilist to\nshow how it is that manipulation cases differ from a normal\ndeterministic history. The compatibilist’s only other strategy\nis simply to deny that the pertinent manipulated agents are not free\nand morally responsible. This problem is not lost on\nreasons-responsiveness compatibilists, of course (see Fischer 2004 for\none attempt to address these issues). \nFinally, let’s consider views inspired by Strawson’s\ncompatibilism. \nSeveral contemporary philosophers have advanced Strawsonian themes.\nFor example, Gary Watson (1987) sought to elaborate these themes by\nthinking of our moral responsibility practices, and in particular the\nmorally reactive attitudes, along the lines of a communication-based\ntheory in which a morally responsible agent’s competence turns\nin some way upon being a potential interlocutor to moral conversations\nbetween her and the moral community in which she operates. On this\nview, the control condition for moral responsibility would have to fit\nthe capacity to communicate morally through word and deed with members\nof the moral community. \nIn a somewhat different development of Strawson’s thought, John\nMartin Fischer and Mark Ravizza hold that an account of guidance\ncontrol aids in providing the conditions of application for the\nconcept of moral responsibility, a concept that they maintain is\nStrawsonian (1998, pp.1–27). Fischer and Ravizza intend their\nStrawsonian theory as an amendment to Strawson’s suggestion that\nmoral responsibility is to be associated with the reactions of those\nwithin the moral community to members of the community. They advise\nthat moral responsibility be developed by thinking in terms of the\npropriety conditions for the morally reactive attitudes.  \nSusan Wolf defends (with significant reservations) the Strawsonian\nthesis that the interpersonal viewpoint (that permits access to the\nmorally reactive attitudes) is one that a freely willing agent cannot\ngive up (1981). Wolf diverges at points with Strawson’s own\nmanner of defending this. But Wolf’s central thesis is\nStrawsonian. A person cannot fully forswear the point of view of the\ninterpersonal attitudes, and this point of view is the point of view\nfrom whence our morally reactive attitudes gain their force and figure\nin our conduct. (Related defenses of the Strawsonian thesis are also\nfound in Shabo 2012 and Coates 2018.) \nPaul Russell (1995) has also defended a form of Strawsonian\ncompatibilism, the central features of which he finds anticipated in\nHume’s writings on free will and moral responsibility. According\nto Russell, we can learn from Hume, as Strawson did, to understand our\nmoral responsibility practices as fundamentally a matter of our\nsentiments and our social expectations as structured and sustained by\nthese sentiments. Fixing on our moral natures, as we should, dispels\nany presumption that determinism would somehow pose a threat to our\nconceptions of freedom and moral responsibility. \nR. Jay Wallace (1994) offers an extension of Strawson’s general\nstrategy in terms of moral norms of fairness for holding responsible\nreflected in our moral responsibility practices (1994,\npp.103–9). From these moral norms—and not from the mere\nnaturalistic facts that we have these practices—Wallace proceeds\nto uncover the conditions required for being responsible.\nWallace’s position has emerged as a serious alternative to the\nsorts of approaches to the free will problem that take as their\ntheoretical starting point the nature of persons, or the\naction-theoretic characteristics of the process issuing in freely\nwilled action.  \nAnd finally, perhaps the most detailed recent defense of Strawsonian\ncompatibilism is due to David Shoemaker (2017). Shoemaker argues for a\nresponse-dependent account of moral responsibility first by defending\na response-dependent account of amusement. He then argues the norms of\nhumor are tightly parallel to those of responsibility-entailing\nemotions like anger. And from there, he builds his response-dependent\naccount of moral responsibility.","contact.mail":"djcoates@uh.edu","contact.domain":"uh.edu"}]
