Traditionally traced to the\nmythical Laozi “Old Philosopher,” Philosophical Daoism\nowes more to “philosopher Zhuang” (Zhuangzi)\n(4th Century BCE). Daoism is an umbrella that covers a\nrange of similarly motivated doctrines. The term “Daoism”\nis also associated with assorted naturalistic or mystical religions.\nSometimes the term “Lao-Zhuang Philosophy” is used to\ndistinguish the philosophical from the more religious\n“Huang-Lao” (Yellow Emperor-Laozi) strain of Daoist\nthought.\n\n\nBoth the Daode Jing and the Zhuangzi are composite\ntexts written and rewritten over centuries with varied input from\nmultiple anonymous writers. Each has a distinctive rhetorical style,\nthe Daode Jing terse and poetic, the Zhuangzi\nprolix, funny, elusive and filled with fantasy dialogues. Both texts\nflow from reflections on the nature of\n dao\n (way) and related\n concepts\n that were central to the ethical disputes of Ancient China. The\nconcept of “Daoism” as a theme or group did not exist at\nthe time of the Classical Daoists, but we have some reasons to suspect\nthe communities focusing on the Zhuangzi and Laozi\ntexts were in contact with each other. The texts share some figurative\nexpressions and themes, an ironic detachment from the first order\nmoral issues so hotly debated by the Mohists and Confucians preferring\na reflective, metaethical focus on the nature and development of\nways. Their metaethics vaguely favored different first-order\nnormative theories (anarchism, pluralism, laissez faire government.\nThe meta-ethical focus and the related less demanding first order\nethics mostly distinguishes “Daoists” from other thinkers\nof the period.\n\n\nThe meta-ethical reflections were by turns skeptical then relativist,\nhere naturalist and there mystical. Daoism per se has no\n“constant dao.” However, it does have a common\nspirit. Dao-centered philosophical reflection engendered a distinctive\nambivalence in advocacy—manifested in their indirect,\nnon-argumentative style, their use of poetry and parable. In ancient\nChina, the political implication of this Dao-ism was mainly an\nopposition to authority, government, coercion, and even to normal\nsocialization in values. Daoist “spontaneity” was\ncontrasted with subtle or overt indoctrination in any specific or\nsocial dao.\n\nDefinitions of Daoism are controversial because of the complex twists\nin its development as it played its role in the long history of China.\nEven the coining of the term creates ambiguity about what counts as\n‘Daoism’. Three to seven centuries after they were\nsupposed to have lived, Han dynasty (around 100 BCE) historians\nidentified Laozi and Zhuangzi as Daoists. The historians postulated\nsix schools of classical thought—Confucian, Mohist, Yin-yang,\nLegalist, Daoist and school of names. They coined the term\ndao-jia (way-school) or (dao-de jia) (way\nand virtue school) and came to identify Laozi and Zhuangzi as\nparadigms of the study of \ndaoway[2].\n Other texts were linked by their incorporation of themes from the two\nclassics including the Liehzi, the Baopuzi and the\nHuinanzi. After it was linked to the interpretation of the\nLaozi by Wang Bi, the Yijing came to be thought of\nas a classic of Daoism.  \nThe Qin had brought a sudden end to the institutions that generated\nthe sophisticated classical period of Chinese philosophy. At first,\ntheir ideologies, “Legalist” and Huang-Lao thought,\ndominated an impoverished intellectual life. When the Han Dynasty\nbegan trying to reconstruct China’s classical history , its historians\ncoined the term “Daoism,” probably thinking of Huang-Lao\ncontent. However, they implicitly fixed its\nreference by pointing to Laozi and Zhuangzi as exemplars. So\nan operative definition of philosophical Daoism could be\n“what\n Laozi\n and\n Zhuangzi\n taught” leaving details to interpretation. Other early Han\nwriters using their own interpretations, cribbed and copied from the\noriginal texts but, under Huang-Lao influence, exhibited little\nfurther philosophical reflection. The products of this\n“recovery” have also come to be thought of as Daoist texts\nand include the Huinanzi (around 140 BCE) and the\nLiezi (third Century AD) and the Yijing. The\noperative definition if we included these texts would, of course,\nchange.  \nDuring the early Han, Confucianism became an official orthodoxy.\nQuasi-supernatural cosmological speculation (five-phase theory and\nportentology) dominated Han thought and the intellectual lives of\nChinese thinkers for four centuries. When the Han declined, the\nsterile Confucianism lost much of its appeal to intellectuals who\nturned to Lao-Zhuang for fresh inspiration—but now read through\ncosmological Confucian lenses. Western scholars identify this movement\nas\n Neo-Daoist\n but since it fixed the enduring forms of a “traditional\ntext” and provided the first systematic commentaries, that\ncosmological conception has come to dominate traditional Chinese views\nof Daoism. The Neo-Daoist movement also overlapped and facilitated the\nintroduction and spread of\n Buddhism\n in China. Neo-Daoist discourse practices were vehicles for the\nconceptually alien Buddhist ideas and Daoism probably influenced the\nemergence of distinctively Chinese forms of Buddhism, particularly\nChan (Zen). This development so blended Neo-Daoism and Mahayana\nBuddhism in the intellectual consciousness that the Neo-Confucians\neventually took the two to be essentially similar\nreligious-metaphysical outlooks.  \nMeantime, “Daoist” religious groups adopted the\ninstitutions of Buddhism (Nuns, monks, monasteries etc.) and became\nlinked to martial-arts, to alchemy, and to popular movements (often\nrebellious or millenarian movements) that emerged in subsequent\ndynasties. Because of Daoism’s “naturalistic” and\nanti-authoritarian ethos, its inherent focus on “ways,”\nthe term ‘Daoism’ could encompass virtually any such\nmovement or “local” religion with its familiar natural\n“Gods.” ‘Daoist’ is a natural characterization\nof the ideology behind any non-Confucian or anti-conformist strains of\nthought. The result is that ‘Religious Daoism’ has become\na deeply malleable concept. Creel’s famous question “What is\nTaoism?” (1970) remains as difficult as ever for Daoist\nreligion. We defer to scholars of religion to sort out the conceptual\nlimits of Daoist religion and baldly focus on what philosophical\ncontent can be extracted from the classical exemplars: Laozi and\nZhuangzi.  \nThis somewhat arbitrary conceptual division leaves ample ambiguity to\nsort out in interpretation. The two texts, in both style in content,\ninvite lines of elaboration that are congenial to the religious\nimpulse and those that are more philosophical. That is partly because\nthe subject matter of religion and philosophy overlap. We distinguish\nphilosophy from religion better by pointing to philosophy’s\ndisciplinary commitment to reflectively warranted norms guiding its\ntheorizing and its critical assessment of theories. The norms\nthemselves are subject to discursive, norm guided reflection and\nrevision—which gives philosophy the familiar open,\n“meta” character that underwrites its image as\n“thinking about thinking.” Relatively religious approaches\n(even within philosophy) rely on appeals to “higher”\ntranscendent or hyper-human perspectives to guide thinking. This\ndisciplinary difference in the approach to areas of overlap, e.g.,\nmetaphysics and ethics, emerges from philosophy’s relatively greater\nfocus on logic and epistemology.  \nTraditional accounts of Daoism deal with two areas of overlap:\nmetaphysics and ethics. Philosophical interpretations that are\nhospitable to religious movements include transcendent monism,\nmysticism, and ethical intuitionism or supernaturalism (identifying\nright with attitudes of transcendent ethical judges). Absent a Chinese\nor Daoist logic, the challenge for a more critical philosophical view\nis showing that Daoists took a reflective, second level, meta-stance\nin discussing these issues and how (or whether) the more religious\nconclusions could survive reflection according to the norms of\nreasoning enshrined in the philosophical high-tide of the classical\nperiod of thought. Is there a classical basis for a warranted Chinese\nskepticism and could the more credulous readings of the text withstand\nthe critical challenge of such a skepticism? The central sections of\nthis article will trace the conceptual basis for a fully philosophical\ninterpretation of the two core texts of Daoism while pointing out\nalong the way where the more religious readings find footing in the\ntexts. The effects of these religious readings will be traced in\nsurveying later Daoist movements and impacts. \nThough tradition has treated Laozi and Zhuangzi as the Socrates and\nPlato of ‘Daoism,’ the use of Lao-Zhuang to identify a\nstrain of thought may have become common only as with Neo-Daoism in\nthe 3rd Century AD. Not only is it true that\n“Zhuangzi never knew he was a Daoist”, (Graham 1981, 128)\nhe probably also didn’t know anything about the\nLaozi. However, writers responsible for later chapters of the\nZhuangzi established the first connection between the two\ntexts. A large chunk of the “outer” chapters use the\ncharacter of Laozi as spokesman for a closely related meta-ethical\nposition and occasionally echoes the style and attitudes of the\nDaode Jing—though it seldom quotes directly from\nany extant version. Common themes, tropes and modes of expression\nseem to link the authors of the outer chapters with Daode\nJing. One plausible speculation is that anonymous students of the\nZhuangzi, working after his death, were\n“developing” the Zhuangzi text while in contact\nwith the group anonymously composing the Daode Jing. They\nseemingly shaped each other’s themes, expressions and ideas. See\nfurther discussion in\n Texts and Textual Theory.\n  \nThe underlying basis for our distinction between the philosophical and\nreligious poles is epistemic. Both species of Daoism start from a\ncommon critique of “ordinary” knowing of\ndaoway:guide. From this\nmildly skeptical or relativist base, philosophical Daoism tends toward\npluralism, perspectivalism, skepticism, political equality and\nfreedom. Religious “mysticism” usually is accompanied by a\ncredulous assertion of supernatural epistemic abilities—control\nof some abstruse or magical way of overcoming skepticism.\nThis is often explained by a supposed Daoist correlate of Confucian\ncultivation and the sage. It is typically the\nassociated with some intuitive or “superlative” direct\naccess to a single correct daoway:guide.\nAs its special insight cannot be\njustified to those with “ordinary” perspectives and/or\ncannot be put into language and argument, it tends to generate the\nesoteric, hierarchical and authoritarian attitudes familiar in\nreligions as well as the institutions that initiate and cultivate the\ncommon human into the idealized adept.  \nThe Confucian-like emphasis on “cultivating” this special\nepistemic ability, obediently following teachers and traditions\ncontrasts with the philosophical strain’s emphasis on natural\nspontaneity, freedom and egalitarianism which seems to Confucians like\na plea for anarchy. This is because in the context of Ancient China,\nthe assumed role of government is cultivating moral character, that\nis, instilling the same moral daoway:guide\nin everyone whether by education,\nattraction or force. (The gap between the religious and philosophical\nversions of the political attitudes can be partially closed if it\ntreats the content of the transcendent dao\nas egalitarian, empty or anarchist—hence available equally to\nall with no need of hierarchy or training). \nConfucianism argues that the shared interest in cultivating a\nhyper-normal epistemic status means that Confucianism and Daoism are\nultimately compatible. Both have at their core a dogmatic asseveration\nof their “special,” cultivated ability of direct (not\nmediated by language or reasons) access to the single, correct,\ndao—which cannot be cast in the form of\n“fixed” principles. So even if they disagree about the\nethical details, they share a similarly anti-skeptical, unreflective\nauthoritarian epistemology. The supposedly shared presupposition is\nthe possibility of mysteriously cultivating an infallible or\nsuperhuman intuitive guidance system. The question is: can an asserted\ncommitment to that view survive the the philosophical arguments found\nin two Daoist texts—the worrisome sections that fuel skeptical\nor relativist interpretations? Insofar as they can answer those\narguments in justifying their claims to special access, such\ntendencies in dogmatic absolutist directions can still count as\n‘philosophical’. We draw the line distinguishing\nphilosophy from religion where the claim to special insight rests on\nsimple assertion, unexplained intuition, special pleading, appeal to\neither authority or “revelation” or naïve\nsupernaturalism.  \nThe domination of Confucianism in Chinese intellectual life has\nbrought with it the wide acceptance of this “friendly”\northodox religious interpretation of Daoism. History does little to\nsettle which line of interpretation is “original” since\nlines of thought leading in each direction can be found in early\nclassical sources. This difficulty is compounded by the diffidence of\nthe writing styles in both the Daode Jing and the\nZhuangzi—which is so marked that it is often tempting\nto suspect the writers intended to be ambiguous, to invite divergent\ninterpretation as an object lesson in the “inconstancy” of\nany discourse-based dao. Conceivably, therefore, both trends\nmay have drawn “support” from reading the early texts as\nexpressing ideas compatible with their own. See\n Origins of Daoism. \nThe plethora of strains of Daoism makes any specific content\nattributed to philosophical Daoism controversial to others who are\nequally attracted to the texts and their ideas. Treatments range from\ninterpreting Daoism as a sophisticated metaethical position rooted in\nanalytic studies of language tending toward ethical skepticism and\nrelativism at one end and “praising” Daoism as an\nanti-logical, deliberately self-contradictory mysticism—a\ncultural rebuke of Western rationality—at the other. Despite (or\nbecause of?) their “Rorschach” quality, the two main texts\nremain among the most popular in Chinese philosophy. No one doubts\ntheir literary qualities and attractive style which, combined with\ntheir lighthearted humor, leaves readers with a compelling inkling\nthat these texts are somehow philosophically profound. See\nthe section\n Philosophical Daoism: A Primer.\n  \nThis entry will focus on exploring that hint of philosophical depth in\nDaoism and touch on the familiar religious interpretations mainly for\ncontext and contrast. We will look at a range of loosely related\nphilosophical positions and some of the interpretive theory fueling\nthem. The philosophical side of Daoism takes the\nru-moConfucianism-Mohism\ndebate about dao as a model of what goes wrong in trying to\nformulate a “constant dao .” This critique takes\nthe form of metaethics—a study of the nature or metaphysics of\ndaoways as well as\ndao’s knowability and objectivity as well as the pragmatics\nof dispute about dao. This strategy generates a distinctive\nanalysis of key normative concepts of Ancient China. See the section\n Important Daoist Concepts. \nPhilosophical Daoist interest in daoways:guides\nis thus distinct from the\nfirst-order normative focus of Confucians and Mohists, who certainly\nused the word dao as often as did the\nclassical Daoist thinkers. We distinguish Daoism here as\nmeta-theorizing rather than direct advocacy of some first-order\ndao . Often the reflections have (or seem to have)\nimplications for how to choose which first-order dao to\nfollow (or whether to abandon all of them). Meta-reflection\nconstitutes the umbrella that covers this wide range of first-order\noptions and the meta-positions include nihilism, relativism,\nskepticism, intuitionism, mysticism, primitivism, value contrarianism\nand naturalist stoicism. Echoes of all these can be found in both\ntexts—often, as we noted, as if the various contributors to the\ntexts were divided on what follows from such a philosophical ascent to\nmeta-critique. The metaethical views also motivate some of the\ncommonly attributed first-order political daos, e.g.,\ndaos of suspicion of political authority (anarchism), social\nconvention and traditional mores. The philosophical focus thus\nconstrues Daoism as a meta-level challenge to Confucianism,\nwhile the religious focus tends to treat it as a sibling—with\nsimilar emphasis on cultivation, direct intuition, sages and a prosaic\ninterest only in guilelessly asserting their alternative first-order\nnormative dao. \nAncient Chinese thinkers discussed mainly three parts of dao:\nhuman (or social) dao, tiannaturaldao, and great dao.\nWhen I instruct you to put your hand on your partner’s head, I am\ndelivering some human dao. Human dao is typically\nenshrined in a language—which may include the language of\nplanning. Human daos are normative space-time\nstructures—recommended possible histories. Natural\ndao (often translated heavenly dao) is akin to what\nwe would consider the constancies of science. It is the ways things\nreliably (constantly) have happened and will happen. Great\ndao refers to the entire actual history of\neverything—whatever has happened, is happening or actually will\nhappen in the universe constitutes the great dao.  \nDaoists, however, do not formulate these categories\nexplicitly—partly because they may seem to overlap. A\nform of determinism, for example, would treat tian dao and\ngreat dao as identical—the laws of nature make\nonly one world-history possible. Common sense\nindeterminism would regard many possible world histories as\nconsistent with tian dao. In general, however, it is best to\nthink of Great dao as simply the counterpart of\nWittgenstein’s “All that is the case”—the extended\nactual space-time world. One of the insights of the Zhuangzi,\nnot as clearly reflected in the Laozi, is that human\ndao is embedded in, part of and consistent with, both great\ndao and natural dao (tian dao).  \nDaoist philosophers typically express their doubts about first-order\nhuman dao (paradigmatically Confucian and Mohist\ndao) by considering them in relation to natural dao\nand/or great dao (the actual dao).\nThis plays on the tendency of rival schools of ancient Chinese\nmoralists to treat tiannature:sky\nas the authority for their favored\nhuman daos. Mature Daoist analysis centers on the insight\nthat while human daos are normative, neither the natural nor\nthe actual dao are. Natural dao and Great\ndao are\n “constant”\n while human dao are inherently changeable and subject to\ninterpretation. This insight is most famously expressed in the first\nline of the Daode Jing “daoguides\nthat can daoguide\nare not constant daoguides.” \nGiven the shared ru-moConfucian-Mohist\nassumption that normative\nauthority for their competing first-order daos comes from\nsome form of endorsement by tiannature:sky,\nDaoists aver that nature does not\nauthorize or endorse any particular social dao. This\nclaim has two versions: pluralist and primitivist. Denying that it\nendorses a particular one is compatible with its\nallowing either many or none. The\nnihilistic answer might take the form of an assertion that reality is\nan amorphous chaos and all daos impose an illusory or unreal\nsocial structure on Chaos. This version, however, has no obvious\nnormative implications.  \nTo answer “none” and still treat tiannature:sky\nas the normative authority generates\na dichotomy between human and natural dao. The metaphysical\ntype of human social dao is guiding discourse, so this line\nof thought motivates Daoist “silence”—the notorious\nreluctance to use language. The philosophical quietism is also\nmotivational and intentional quietism—essentially an extreme\nform of stoicism. This treats accepting natural dao as not\nusing guidance or identifying the “highest” guidance with\n“whatever happens” the quintessential position of Shen\nDao. Technically, however, Shen Dao does not formulate a doctrine of\ndeterminism (the identity of naturally possible dao and the actual\n“Great” dao. The appearance of fatalism comes\nfrom concluding that we have no moral responsibility—to\nenact the Great dao in our actions. \nThe Zhuangzi strain, informed by contact with Chinese philosophy of\nlanguage, recognized that a blanket anti-language position was\nself-censuring. The instruction not to follow any dao is\nitself a dao and thus enjoins against following\nitself—a prescriptive paradox. The pluralist reading is that all\nde facto rival practices are natural daos in virtue\nof their being actual practices. Human daos\nin general are a part of natural dao. That they “are\nwalked” shows they are, in that sense, compatible with natural\nconstancies. Similarly, all actual rival daos are\npart of great dao simply in virtue of being followed—as\nthe Zhuangzi says, “daos are made by walking\nthem”.  \nBoth pluralist and primitivist Daoism would reject the\nConfucian-Mohist conclusion that political authority should be used to\nbring about a harmony of daos—making everyone follow a\nsingle dao. The social world survives as well (or better)\nwhen people follow different ways of life. Focus on either\ntiannature:skydao\nor Great dao helps to undermine the sense that it is\nimperative to master or impose any\nparticular first-order dao.\nTiannaturedao,\nlike great dao justifies no particular judgment whatever. \nThe primitivist version of Daoism, however, can religiously take a\nmore assertive form that nature does endorse a\nparticular normative dao, albeit not a\nhuman one (particularly one in discourse form). There\nis a single, constant, correct way of life that cannot be expressed or\npresented in practices, rules, narratives, maps, examples, songs or\nany other human or social form of communication and advocacy.\nIt implicitly must be a super-human dao accessed via\nsuper-human epistemic capacities—mystical or esoteric\ndao. Though it is usually expressed as the\nnatural dao, there is no obvious reason why there might not\nbe multiple super-human daos.  \nA different version of the primitivist interpretive line is that there\nare fully natural ways but that they require finer or more complex\ndiscriminations than normal humans are capable of. Humans could follow\nthem, as it were, by luck or accident, but not reliably via any\nlearnable pattern. If one subtracts the claims to superhuman epistemic\ncapacities, then an interpretive hypothesis would yield a combination\nof both natural realism and skepticism. Still another possibility\nwould be of naturalistic ways to do something that\nare humanly accessible—but in different ways to\neach different human or in each situation. There would be no learnable\nsocial formula that could be of any use and no one’s having\nsuccessfully done it could count as “knowing”\nit in the sense of being reliably able to do it again or in\nthe sense of being able to teach others. In that case, the\ninterpretation would be both realistic and relativist and\nmildly skeptical—most of us don’t actually know and, though in\nprinciple we could do it on occasions, no one could know a reliable\nshareable process or content for acquiring that dao. \nA contrarian version expresses itself via deliberate flaunting or\n“reversing” all the norms and attitudes in the\nconventional dao. Laozi’s is the most famous example of this\ndao of reversal, though overtones can be found in Zhuangzi’s\ndescription of “the perfect” person or ability as one that\nis so incomprehensible and so irrelevant to our concerns that he\nappears as the opposite whatever we normally respect. The political\nconsequence is still a government guided by a discourse\ndao—the systematic reversal of the dominant Confucian\ndao. \nRelativist (pluralist) or skeptical versions need not deny that there\nare norms for endorsing some daos over others, but would\nacknowledge that the norms of endorsing a dao constitute a\ndistinct dao that we presuppose in choosing it. This\nmeta-dao, by hypothesis, is also natural in being “actual”\nso the relativism involved need not be irrealism. Such relativism\ndeserves the ‘Daoist’ appellation on the further ground\nthat it entails that normative authority comes from higher-level\ndao, not from the Confucian-Mohist\n tiannature:sky.\nHowever, actual nature gives us\nmany candidate daos. It’s conclusion, thus, is not\nthat we should flaunt or violate nature, but that we simply cannot\nflaunt it. Any of the options actually available to us for guidance\nare components of both the natural and Great daos. Hence,\n“follow the natural dao” is empty (tautological)\nas a normative guide—a dao that does not dao.\nWhatever dao we choose will be a natural one, in virtue of\nbeing one we in fact can choose and “walk”.  \nThe naturalist, mystical, and intuitionist versions similarly draw\ndifferently nuanced conclusions from this analysis of the role of\ndaos in nature and actual history. Intuitionism teeters\ntoward the religious strain’s claim of special epistemic access, but\ncould be developed in an egalitarian and even a naturalistic way.\nNaturalism is inherently more egalitarian but tends, uncritically, to\nconfuse being neutral with rejecting actually existing social\ndao. Mysticism’s implications are, by definition, unclear.\nDaoist mysticism tends toward what some call “external\nmysticism.” It arises from reflections on the context\nsensitivity and normative complexity of dao rather than from\nsome “inner” experience as of an inexpressible\n“oneness.” If combined with some doctrine or a particular\n(discourse or non-discourse) dao, it tends to foster\nreligious claims of superlative “access” to a mystically\n“correct” penetration of the complexity—though it\nmay still claim that the insight is equally accessible to everyone.\nThis access need not be mystical if it consists simply in giving up\nany attempt to determine how to guide one’s behavior but even that\ncounts as a dao—but probably contains a prescriptive\nparadox.  \nDespite the divergence in these versions of Daoism, all can claim to\nunderwrite a theme of harmony with nature—the pluralist sees the\npoint of such harmony as permissive and tolerant, while the\nprimitivist sees it as a more intolerant rejection or\nprohibition of any conventional dao. \nMetaphysically, Daoism is naturalistic in that any first-order moral\ndao must be rooted in natural ways. It doesn’t\ncharacterize the natural dao as either physical or mental.\nLike the varieties of metaphysical naturalism that eschew both a\ncommitment to realism or anti-realism, it simply accepts natural\ndao without a separate theory of whether it is real or not.\n \nMuch of the thrust of Daoism, as we have seen, naturally motivates a\nreaction against the moralistic and elitist inclinations of\nConfucianism. Confucianism stood for a rigid, detailed, traditional\npattern of hierarchical social behavior. Duties were assigned to all\nof one’s social roles—and a person typically had many such\nroles, e.g., husband, father, minister, younger brother, teacher,\nstudent, etc. One could escape this heavy scheme of obligations mainly\nin retirement or, paradoxically, the traditional duty to spend three\nyears “in mourning” for the death of one’s father. The\nwithdrawal from society, the antipathy toward ritual roles,\ntraditional “morality,” and any social structures or\ntraditional culture suggests a kind of Daoist “ethos” as\nan antithesis to Confucianism in China. We can trace the origin of\nDaoism, accordingly, in two ways. One is attitudinal, the other\ntheoretical. The theoretical mark of Daoism is an interest in the\nmeaning or nature of dao which may inform or encourage Daoist\nattitudes. In view of the religious strain, however, we have to\nrecognize two attitudes as marks of proto-Daoism in China. The first\nis the vague reaction against the demanding scheme of traditional\nConfucian rules. The second is interest in techniques for cultivating\nthe adept to achieve an elevated epistemic status resulting in with\nsome special or transcendent access to a dao that is\nimpenetrable to those who have not had this\n“cultivation.” \nTraditionally scholars have traced the first “Daoist\nspirit” back to “proto-Daoist” hermits who crop up\nsporadically in the Analects, confronting Confucius and his\ndisciples as they traveled to or fled from various rulers. Their\napproximate message was an early version of Yangist purification by\nwithdrawal from society. Robert\n Eno[3]\n argues that Confucius himself had a heavy dose of this\n“Daoist” attitude and his “political” theory\nwas actually a justification of his staying remote from\ngovernment—at least until a sage is in power! This attitude\ntends to be expressed as anti-moral or amoral mainly because it\ntargets a Confucian conception that systematically elides morality and\nconventional mores. It also seems to include some of the attitudes\nthat led to the agriculturalists with their opposition to the division\nof labor, the differential social status and ranks to which it gives\nrise. These, however, seem to involve no meta-theory of dao\nof the type traced in the Zhuangzi history although they can\nbe seen as early indications of the value of Daoist egalitarianism and\nimpartiality. \nAnother candidate for this “proto-Daoist” status, Yang\nZhu, we know mainly from Mencian attacks. According to Mencius, Yang\nZhu derived opposition to society and politics from an ethical egoism\n(emphasizing “me”). Angus Graham has influentially (and\ncontroversially) reconstructed Yang Zhu’s ideas, but they too do not\ninclude explicit meta-theorizing about the nature of dao.\nYangism mainly proposes a (shocking!) rival first order normative\ndao—egoism. Yangist echoes surface prominently in the\nLaozi and in huge chunks of the “outer chapters”\nof the Zhuangzi. At its core is an arguably Daoist worry that\nsocial conventions and structures damage our natural spontaneity and\ninterfere with efficient functioning of our natural powers. Early\nChinese moral theory flowed too easily between mores and\nmorality and we may see the lure of Daoist impartiality in\nthe Yangist desire to dispense with relative social mores. \nOthers credited as precursors of Daoism seemed to reflect a version of\nthe moralists’ confidence that they had achieved some non-linguistic\nor\n intuitive\n access to a daoguide that\nresists “ordinary” formulation. It amounts to direct\naccess to what, for ordinary people, is the product of\ninterpreting a first order dao. Thus it lacks the inherent\nvagueness of a formulaic dao. The Confucian value of\nrenhumanity is the\nmoralists’ most prominent manifestation of this tendency. Such\nintuitionism, while cursorily evading interpretive variability, led\ninstead to insoluble conflicts of authority. They disagreed with each\nother about who else had such access and any attempt to resolve that\ntransmuted into an attempt to formulate or theorize about the\nintuition, thus threatening to abandon their hard won interpretive\nconstancy. This is because the common formulation of these disputes\nconstitutes a theory or dao of how to cultivate the unerring\ninterpretive access to other dao.  \nHal Roth emphasizes this line of thought and follows Graham in linking\nit to two recently prominent chapters of an early Legalist\ntext, the Guanzi (neiyeinward\ntraining and xin shuheart-mind\nmethods). The writers claim to have\nachieved this direct access to dao and Roth links the\n“achievement” to evidence of early Chinese interests in\nmeditative practices including breath control, fasting (and\nnotoriously wine and possibly other hallucinogens). Victor Mair,\nsuggests that Yogic techniques, already transmitted from India, played\nthis role. The epistemic commitment both hypotheses impute to their\nproto-Daoists, however, is that these techniques help achieve\nincorruptible practical access to the correct normative\ndaoguide. Usually this\naccess was direct and unmediated by language or culture. So they might\necho the anarchists rejection of rules or principles but for quite\ndifferent reasons, i.e., that they can neither formulate nor\ninferentially defend their intuitively “correct”\ndao.  \nThe inferred interpretive reliability in this stream of Daoism\nreflects a kind of impartiality, the irresolvability of rival claims\nto infallible practical guidance threatens that goal. It can be\ndeveloped in an egalitarian way (i.e., everyone has such immediate,\nunerring guidance) that also removes any conflict by inviting a\nradically subjective relativism or romantic, primitivist\n optimism.[4]\n But it is more routinely developed into esoteric and authoritative\ndirections, requiring adepts to subject themselves to the some version\nof the dogmatic cultivation techniques. Both may, however, share\nDaoism’s implicit enmity toward the first-order moralists and Daoism\nmay draw from its suspicion of traditional texts and normative\nprecepts. \nThere can be little doubt that this dogmatic, self-congratulatory\ntrend of “authoritarian intuitionism” existed in classical\nthinking. One can, however, doubt that it is either a necessary or\nsufficient distinguisher of Daoism. It finds a more comfortable home\nin proto-Legalist texts and arguably blends the ingredients of\nHuang-Lao ruler-worship. It is also quite obviously manifest in\nauthoritarian and intuitionistic Confucianism with its emphasis on\ncultivation. Confucian interpretations, like religious ones, typically\ntreat Daoists as making Confucian-style, elitist cultivation claims.\n \nPhilosophical interpretations are naturally less comfortable taking\nthese authoritarians as forerunners of Daoism and usually require some\nversion of them that pushes them toward relativism or optimistic\nprimitivism. The esoteric or authoritarian developments seem too\ncavalierly to brush-off the skeptical doubts that generated\nphilosophical reflection on dao and the impulse to seek an\nimpartial resolution. A characteristically religious excuse for\ncoercive indoctrination is available. After “proper\ncultivation,” the rebellious person would “see” and\nappreciate their wisdom in thus coercing him. Thus the Huang-Lao\ntradition could mesh with the authoritarian Confucian and Legalist\nelites who dominated the Han. With the Mawang Dui discovery (see\n Texts and Textual Theory)\n came more evidence of Huang-Lao theory. Just how far back its history\nextends into the classical period remains controversial. It was highly\ninfluential in the Qin and Han, when it seemed to be highly favored by\nthe superstitious rulers. Han historians categorized many of the\nfigures in the Daoist history as students of Huang-Lao.  \nMany scholars have treated the Mawang Dui discovery as proving the\nLaozi stems from such authoritarian forerunners of this cult.\nThe arguments are inconclusive, necessarily so since the\nLaozi’s emergence remains so obscure. In the definitional\ntexts, the Laozi and the Zhuangzi, the epistemic\ngrounds are arguably more skeptical and perspectival than dogmatic.\nThere is little unambiguous appeal to direct mystical experience or\ninsight. In these texts, hypothetical exemplars of such authoritative,\nsuperlative knowledge of dao are typically described as being both\nincomprehensible and irrelevant to us and our practical questions. In\nany case, the ambiguous style of both texts comports poorly with the\nimplicit authoritarianism of the religious movement and it is very\nhard to show how philosophically the use of breathing techniques,\nmeditation, proto-yogic practices or hallucinogens could vouchsafe\nsuch supernatural epistemic achievements. They do nothing to explain\nor justify the sophisticated philosophical understanding of\ndao we can find in these texts.  \nUltimately, the philosophical question is whether these assertions of\nintuitionist access would or would not be refuted by the skeptical\narguments that Zhuangzi directed against the Confucians. Given their\nsimilarities, it’s difficult to imagine how these religious\nconclusions could escape his analysis. Modern champions of\nirrationalist Daoism, of course, would not be disturbed by this\ninconsistency, of course, since, they allege, that Daoists refuse to\nthink logically. Finally, like the attitudinal Daoist stream, the\nauthoritarian intuition approach deals with the epistemology of access\nto dao rather than to an analysis of its nature and how\ninsight into that nature can illuminate and correct disputes about\nfirst order dao. \nWe have alluded to the earliest known “history of thought”\nin ancient China comprising Chapter 33 (Tianxiaunder\nheaven) of the Zhuangzi. It\nsurveys the streams of thought leading from the “ancients”\n(the Chinese golden age?) to Zhuangzi. After introducing the idealized\nancient dao, it implies a “fall,” then lists a\nseries of groups of thinkers, each striving for impartial objectivity,\nleading eventually to a Laozi group and then to Zhuangzi.  \nThe list takes key thinkers to be motivated by goals of neutrality,\nuniversality, freedom from bias and natural “spontaneity”\nin action. The list starts with a group that includes Mozi (universal,\nimpartial utilitarians), then discusses anti-conventionalists headed\nby Song Xing, third came Shen Dao’s group (metaphysical anti-knowledge\nstoics), then Laozi and Zhuangzi. Its last topic however is not\nZhuangzi but his friend and frequent philosophical debating companion,\nHui Shi, who along with other members of the school of\n names,\n is introduced mainly for condemnation as if (contrary to all other\nevidence) he were irrelevant to the motivation and understanding of\nZhuangzi’s thought. Clearly, we can use this history only with some\ncaution. It does serve as a “manifest history of thought”\nthat helps us appreciate the philosophical agenda of the writer. We,\nhowever, must blend this internal Daoist history with external\ninformation about these groups and their thought to get a plausible\nexplanatory justification for the classic Zhuangzi position.  \nInitially, it is a surprise to see Mozi listed as a\n“forerunner” of Daoism since in many respects, passages in\nthe Zhuangzi take the Mohist dispute with Confucianism as a\ncritical target (examples of question-begging rival first-order\ntheories of dao). However, in both our theoretical senses,\nDaoism could be said to have roots in the anti-Confucian Mozi\n(5th Century BCE). First, his early challenge to\nConfucianism initiated higher level philosophical reflections on\ndao, its role and the kind of thinking it involved. Mozi, for\nexample, theorized that a dao should be constant, not a\nmatter of a special history or arbitrary social convention. He\nsupported his use of a utilitarian standard to evaluate social\ndaos on grounds of the impartiality and constancy of the\nbenefit-harm distinction. He taught this “constant”\nfeature of utilitarianism was evidence that it was\ntiannature’s standard. He\nthought of this as an objective fastandard\nfor making shi-feithis-not\nthis distinctions. \nMozi’s challenge to Confucianism focused on his crucial insight that\nthe fact that traditional norms are our own, do not warrant taking\nthem as correct. Mozi thus launched the meta-search for a way\nimpartially to select a first-order dao. He\nformulates the initial version of the goal of unbiased, constant\nuniversality in morality. Both of these results, further, involved\nimportant theoretical insights into the concept of dao. The\nMohists developed much of the terminology of analysis that other\nChinese thinkers, including Mencius and Zhuangzi, adopted. (See\n Concepts.)\n Zhuangzi deployed this language with considerable skill in his\nskeptical undermining of all claims to special moral authority.  \nHowever, Mohism did advocate a first order normative dao and\nfollowed Confucianism in the assumption that an orderly society needs\nto follow a single constant dao. Though they\ndeveloped an account of how to justify a dao and first\nformulated the standard of dao adequacy (constancy). What\nthey did not notice was that those standards constituted a\nmeta-dao—a dao for selecting and interpreting\na first-order dao. This reflects their failure to reflect on the\nnature of dao, and then to address whether and how such a\ndao was knowable. They disagreed with Confucianism mainly on\nthe content of the daoguide\nto be imposed on society by authority while addressing only from their\nown perspective how that disagreement should be resolved. Theoretical\nDaoism focused on the insolubility of this ru-moConfucian-Mohist\ndebate. \nWe know far less of the doctrine of the next figure cited in the\ndevelopment—Song Xing. Our main sources are the\nZhuangzi description here and a lengthy attack on Song Xing\nin the Xunzi . He is said to have specialized in a theory of\nthe xinheart-mind and to\nhave argued that socialization in conventional attitudes injected\ndestructive values into the heart. The qingpre-socialyudesires\nare relatively few and easy to satisfy.\nSocialization creates a plethora of desires for “social\ngoods” such as status, reputation, and pride. Song Xin suggested\nthat the conventional values, because of their social,\ncomparative nature incite competition and then violence. The\nway to social order is for people to eliminate these socialize\nambitions, which create attitudes of resentment and anger. Hence his\nslogan that being insulted (conventional value) is no\n(qingreal) disgrace. The\nslogan aims to eliminate the violence occasioned by “honor and\nmoral rectitude.” In effect, names do not harm me.  \nMozi had also seen different daos as a source of conflict,\nbut advocated unifying the social dao rather than abandoning\nit. The abandonment theme is developed with some skill in Laozi’s\nDaode Jing. It has roots in the search for impartiality and\nuniversality that also motivated Mozi since it contrasts changeable\nsocial values with pre-social or natural ones. The theme,\nhowever can have both elitist, dogmatic and supernatural elaborations.\nWe might treat the ability to forget social conditioning (returning to\nnature) as something only some are capable of, ignore the\nself-rebutting threat of the attempt, and romanticize the abilities or\nmoral purity that would result from removing socialization.  \nZhuangzi built on a related view—that people develop different\nmoral attitudes from different natural upbringings and each\nfeels his own views are obvious and natural. But his version\ntreats all as equally natural, not regarding some as more able than\nothers to avoid being “blinded by socialization.” Zhuangzi\nalso adopts a closely related view of how xinheart-mind\nis shaped by socialization. So there\nis a role for Song Xing, along with Mozi in the motivations for Daoist\ntheorizing. However, again we find little hint that Song Xing\nreflected on the concept of dao itself and how it is involved\nin this analysis of how society injects attitudes into\nxinheart-mind. \nThe first plausible candidate for a theoretical Daoist comes next in\nthe Zhuangzi historical survey. We will pick Shen Dao as the\nbest-known representative of this group of scholars. He is sometimes\nincluded in the list of Huang-Lao thinkers and cited as a source of\nLegalist thinking. We will not attempt here to reconcile this latter\nwith the essentially Daoist view presented in the Zhuangzi\nhistory. Shen Dao’s theory (perhaps unwittingly) lays the foundation\nfor Daoism’s rejecting the authority of tiannature:sky\nin favor of daoguide:way.\n(In religious language, we can\ndescribe this as worshipping daoguide\nrather than tiannature:sky.)\nThe key insight here is that (like\nGod and Nature) appeal to tiannature:sky\nis normatively empty. All authority\npresupposes some daoguide.\n(God’s moral authority presupposes we accept a dao of\n“obey God.”) The Later\n Mohists[5]\n dialecticians also noticed this problem. They even more clearly argue\nthat the appeal to tiannature:sky\ncould justify the thief as well as\nthe sage.  \nHere is the Zhuangzi “Tianxia” account of Shen\nDao’s group:  \nFor the general public, not cliques; changing and without selfishness;\ndecisive but without any control; responsive to things without\ndividing in two. Not absorbed with reflection. Not calculating in\nknowing how. Not choosing among natural kinds and flowing along with\nthem.  \nThey took bonding all the natural kinds together as the key. They\nsaid, “tiannature:sky\nconstancies can cover but cannot sustain; Earthly cycles can sustain\nbut cannot cover it. Great daoguide\ncan embrace it but cannot distinguish\nit.” We know the myriad natural kinds all have both that which\nis acceptable and that which is unacceptable. So they said, “If\nyou select then you cannot be comprehensive, if you teach you cannot\nconvey all of it. Daoguide\ndoes not leave anything out.”  \nHence Shen Dao “abandoned knowledge and discarded\n‘self’.” He flowed with the inevitable and was\nindifferent to natural kinds … . He lived together with\nshi and fei, mixed acceptable and avoidable. He\ndidn’t treat knowing and deliberation as guides, didn’t know front\nfrom back. He was indifferent to everything.  \nIf he was pushed he went, if pulled he followed—like a leaf\nwhirling in the stream, like a feather in a wind, like dust on a\nmillstone. He was complete and distinguished (fei) nothing\n… . So he said, “reach for being like things without\nknowledge of what to do. Don’t use worthies and sages. Even a clod of\nearth cannot miss Dao.”  \nThe worthy officials all laughed at him and said, “Shen Dao’s\ndao does not lead to the conduct of a living man but the tendency of a\ndead man. It is really very strange… .”\n(Zhuangzi Ch. 33) \nShen Dao’s conception of great dao reminds us of the\nactual world among possible worlds—it is the actual history of\nthe universe. Shen Dao avers that there is just one such total\nhistory—one actual past and one actual future. The actual is,\nobviously, natural so the great dao (the natural pattern of\nbehaviors, events and processes) requires no learning, no knowledge,\nno language or shi-feithis-not\nthis distinctions. “Even a clod of earth cannot\nmiss the great dao.” Shen Dao’s insight undermines all these\nguiding schemes that claim tiannature’s\napproval as justification. The crucial\nimplication of his approach is that great dao has no\nnormative force. To say “follow great daoguide”\nis as trivial as “do what\nyou actually will do.” When we think of dao as the\nactual course of all nature, it is obvious we will follow it.\n \nThis reasoning drives Shen Dao’s slightly different stoicism. His\nslogan was “abandon knowledge; discard self.”\n“Abandon knowledge” means do not guide your behavior using\nprescriptive discourse—a learned daoguide.\n“Discard self”\nprescribes the corollary that even Yang Zhu’s dao of\nself-preservation is not natural. Our death is part of great\ndao—down to its very moment. Egoistic guidance is a\ndaoguide similarly\ncommitted to right-wrong, normative guiding distinctions rooted in a\ndistinction between ‘self’ and ‘other’. It\nrecommends a particular possible future history. So to abandon\nknowledge is to also discard ‘self’ as a\nprescriptive term—to give up using ‘self-other’ as a\nguiding distinction. Yangzhu’s egoism violates Shen Dao’s\nanti-language naturalism as much as does Confucius’s traditionalism or\nMozi’s utilitarianism. \nWhy does Shen Dao think we should give up guiding ourselves by shared\nmoral prescriptions? His stoic attitude and some of his slogans\nsuggest that like the Stoics, he was a fatalist. However Shen Dao’s\nargument has no predictive capacity or law-like basis. It is simply\nlogical determinism: “what will be will be.” The account\nabove also has no hint of any concept of free will, but Shen Dao does\nadvocate a parallel to giving up moral responsibility. We should not\nmake shi-feithis-not this\njudgments. Consequently, he should not be saying that we\nshould follow the great dao, because that would be to\nshithis:right whatever\nactually happens. He avoids this inconsistency and thus is not\ncommitted to the Stoic view that the natural/actual course of events\nis rational or good. It simply happens. \nHowever, another inconsistency is rampant in Shen Dao’s theory of\ngreat dao. In using the notion of the actual dao to motivate\navoiding any prescriptive discourse, Shen Dao is saying to Confucians\nand Mohists, “if you allege to speak for the nature of things,\nsay nothing!” Nature does not prescribe. What about Shen Dao’s\nnaturalism itself, however? Is it other than “natural”\n(and part of great dao) that humans use language to\ncoordinate behavior, to order their interactions, to accumulate and\ntransmit knowledge? Further, his injunction against shi-fei judgments\nis an injunction—a negative prescription. His\n“slogan” is expressed as a guide, as something we can\nlearn and follow. “Abandon knowledge” amounts to a\nprescriptive paradox. The concept of knowledge it uses is prescriptive\nknowledge. In form and intent, it is a prescription—a\ndaoguide. If we obey it, we\ndisobey it. This is our first example of Daoist paradox! Shen Dao’s\ndaoguide is a\ndaoguide that can’t\ndaoguide us.  \nThe Zhuangzi history, where we find this account of Shen\nDao’s doctrine, criticizes Shen Dao’s position along these lines.\nStill, it places Shen Dao in the dialectic just before Laozi, who\ndirectly precedes Zhuangzi. Laozi has a different line of reasoning to\n“abandon knowledge.” He avoids the fatalist\nimplications—and, with it implicitly, the concept of great\ndao as a guide (though he keeps tiannature’sdao). We can view the Laozi\npersona as combining Song Xing and Shen Dao. His reason to\n“abandon knowledge” is that knowledge is a form of social\ncontrol that instills unnatural desires, stimulates\nunnatural action thus it constrains and distorts natural\nspontaneity. The Zhuangzi ordering is theoretically\ninformative, though chronologically inaccurate. \nWe will discuss, here, mainly the contributions the Laozi\nmakes to this Daoist dialectic. For a more complete and detailed\ntreatment of the philosophy of the text, see the entry under Laozi.\n \nThe Zhuangzi history lists Laozi (along with Guan Yin)\nbetween Shen Dao and Zhuangzi. Whatever its actual date and manner of\ncomposition, the Laozi is assigned a role in the development\nof Zhuangzi’s thought that best fits in that slot. The most famous\nline of Daoist meta-theory of dao opens the Daode\nJing. “Dao that can be dao-ed is not\nconstant dao.” Though the text betrays no hint of\nexposure to the\n School of Names,\n this famous slogan is duplicated with mingname\nreplacing dao. It thus shifts the\nfocus of meta-discourse about dao from grounding its\nauthority in nature to issues of language and the role of\nmingwords in\ndao-ing. Since words are not constant, no dao that\ncan be conveyed using words can be. \nWhat is being denied in saying such dao are not\n constant?\n The text does not elaborate on the concept, however the issue in\nancient Chinese thought emerges as the crux of the dispute between\nMohists and Confucians. Mohists attempted to regiment the debate by\ninsisting on fastandards\nfor interpreting guiding language. They argued tiannature:sky’s\nstandard lies in the distinction\nbetween benefit and harm—which was by association a\nconstant standard. The writers of the Confucian\nAnalects inclined toward a notion of an administrator\n“rectifying names.” A name is rectified when an\ninstruction containing it (a ritual or a law) correctly\nguides peoples action. “If names are not rectified …\npeople will not know how to move hand or foot”\n(Analects 13:3). The typical Confucian way of\nrectifying a name is to set an example—either of correct use of\nthe term or correct action in following a dao that contains\nthe term.  \nSo what is Laozi denying when he is made to say “names that can\nbe named are not\n constant\n names?” The skepticism here can be read in two ways. One\nis there is no correct way to use a name so contrary to\nMohism, no standard is “nature’s” constant standard of\nchoice of a dao. The other reading is interpretive—no\npattern of correct past use (no social practice) uniquely determines\nwhat concrete behavior counts as correct here-now (or in\nthe future). So, as Mozi had argued, tradition cannot determine\nwhat is the correct dao, but, the Laozi seems to\nadd, that is so even presupposing a tradition. There is no\nconstant (correct) way to interpret that\npractice/dao into action. \nThe negative result may be read in several ways.  \nThe second and third are compatible with their being a correct or\nconstant dao and the third even with someone’s\nknowing it. It simply cannot be conveyed. The rest of the\ntext—the very fact that there is more to the text—makes\nthese two readings, particularly the last, the most common ones.\nHowever the traditional story of Laozi undermines the argument for\nplacing too much emphasis on the fact that after this opening stanza,\nhe goes on to write a text. It suggests that he writes only\nbecause compelled to do so by the keeper of the pass.  \nAdopting readings 2 or 3 doesn’t remove all paradox from Laozi’s\nposition. Laozi is still left with his variation on Shen Dao’s\n“abandon knowledge.” The text, however, does develop a\ndifferent motivation for it. We find few traces of Shen Dao’s\nfatalistic or stoic reasoning. Laozi’s opposition to knowledge derives\nmore from Song Xing’s insights about how social knowledge shapes our\nvalues and desires. We can attribute to the Laozi the next\ndevelopment in Chinese pragmatics of language, how language shapes\naction. \nLaozi draws illustrations using ming (word)\npairs—opposites. He draws analogies between naming and cutting\nor “carving” (hence the symbol of the nameless\n pusimplicity—uncarved,\nraw wood). When we\nlearn a way of using a word (e.g. watching teachers\n“rectify” names) we internalize a community practice of\n“cutting” stuff and assigning names to the portions. This\nis how we pick out how to act—what to pick up, put down, go\ntoward and so on. We interpret a dao by dividing\nthings up into types. We learn this in concrete practice as we avoid\nor pursue the things named. Thus, with the names we acquire a\ndisposition to behavior toward that type—we acquire a socialized\nvalue or desire for one of the two discriminants. These acquired\ndesires then shape our weideeming:action.\n \nMuch of the further reasoning found in the Laozi follows that\nof Song Xing. The artificially created desires lead to unnecessary\ncompetition and strife. When we see that they are not natural,\nacquiring socialized desires (e.g. for status, reputation, for rare\nobjects) starts to look ill advised. He hints at places that acquiring\nthe system of names dulls our capacity for appreciation or reaction to\nnature—“the five colors blind the eye …”\n(Daode Jing Ch. 12). And most important, acquiring knowledge\nin this way is losing the natural spontaneity and becoming subject to\nsocial control.  \nThe text, accordingly, entices us to free ourselves from this system\nsignified by the slogan wu-weilack-action.\nWe are to set about forgetting all\nour socialization and return to the state of a newborn babe. The\nslogan is famously paradoxical and is even formulated in the text in a\nparadoxical way—“lack acting and yet lack\n‘don’t-act’.”  \nThe bulk of the Daode Jing is thus given over to motivating\nthis paradoxical attitude. Its familiar strategy centers on the notion\nof “reversal.” In passage after passage, advice is given\nthat reverses conventional values (usu. in Confucian-Mohist\ndiscourse)—either rejecting the usual positive value term\n(benevolence, sages, morality, social activism) or motivating valuing\nthe opposite (non-being, water, the female, the lower position etc.).\n \nThe result is a fascinating exercise in normative advocacy including\nLaozi’s famous political theory—which you can find elaborated\nmore fully in the Laozi entry. Clearly, such advocacy is inconsistent\nwith the meta-theory and its purpose must be indirect—perhaps to\ninduce us to “see” one of the three negative positions\nconsidered above. Still it gives the text a tone that we referred to\nabove as primitivism—nullifying socialization and cultivating\nonly the “natural” attitudes and actions. \nOne stark difference between the two main texts of Daoism is the\nrelation to the School of Names. The Laozi, though clearly\nhaving a theory of the pragmatics of naming, betrays neither exposure\nto the doctrines nor the analytical terminology developed by the\ndialectical Mohists for dealing with theory of language. The\nZhuangzi clearly does reveal that exposure. To understand\nthis phase in the development of Daoism, we note briefly what the\noutstanding linguistic issues were and how they were formulated, then\nwe will look at the implications of Daoist\nresponses—particularly those found in the Zhuangzi.\n \nThe focus on mingwords:names\ngrows from recognizing the\ninterpretive problem concerning acting on some guide. The disputes\nabout dao are intimately tied to issues about words—in\nparticular, what is to count as a correct use and what action or\nobjects count as following the guidance. \nThe early Mohists advocated using a utilitarian standard to determine\nboth the correct application of words to actions and the choice of\nword order in social guiding discourse. “Which dao\nshould we follow” became “which words shall we use to\nsocialize people and how should we interpret the words of social\nguiding discourse in guiding our behavior?” In effect, the early\nMohist answer to both questions is settled by making allegedly\n“natural” distinctions between benefit and harm. Thus\nlanguage content and conventions of interpretation should be governed\nby the utility principle. \nLater Mohists formulated a more “realistic” theory of what\ncounts as the normatively correct way to use names. We should mark the\ndistinctions that underlie names in ways that trace patterns of\nobjective similarity and difference in things. This realism governs\nthe correct ways both to use terms and to interpret them. We rely on\nutility to determine how we structure terms into strings in\nguidance—in discourse dao . So, for example, a thief is\na man—is governed by the rules of similarity. Still, we allow\nguidance that includes both the guiding strings “don’t kill\nmen” and “you may kill thieves.”  \nThis realism led the later Mohists to linguistic conclusions that\nchallenged any anti-language attitude—including those expressed\nby early Daoists. First, the later Mohists argued that in any\ndisagreement about how to distinguish realities with names, there was\na right answer. It may, however, be hard to know or prove. So, for\nexample, if we are disputing about whether to use “ox” or\n“non-ox” of some obscure object, one of the answers will\nbe correct. This undermines both the nihilistic and the anti-language\noptions to understanding Laozi. Second, Mohists argued that any\nattempt to formulate the anti-language position was self condemning.\n“All language is bad” must be a “bad” thing to\nsay. \nOther figures classified in the School of Names responded to the\nMohist realists. Gongsun Long (mentioned sporadically in the\nZhuangzi) took himself to be defending Confucian accounts of\nrectifying names and Hui Shi constructs what looks like a relativist\nchallenge to Later Mohist accounts. We will look only at Hui Shi’s\naccount here because he plays such a significant role in the text of\nthe Zhuangzi . \nHui Shi implicitly addressed the claim that the correct use of words\ndepends on objective patterns of similarity and difference. What we\nknow of his writings (which the Zhuangzi history suggests\nwere prodigious) is mainly a sequence of theses cited at the end of\nthe Zhuangzi history. These focused on propositions about\ncomparative “names”—e.g., large and small. Clearly\nsome things properly termed ‘large’ are objectively\nsmaller than other things properly called ‘small’. A small\nelephant is considerably larger than a huge ant! So correct naming\nmust not be based on objective distinctions in the world, but on our\nprojections from a point of view or purpose in using them. Similarly,\n‘tall’, ‘short’, and time words (e.g.,\n‘before’ and ‘after’, ‘today’ and\n‘tomorrow’) are implausibly attributed to objective\ndistinctions \nFrom this, according to the list of propositions in the\nZhuangzi history, Hui Shi apparently concluded that we can\ncluster things in arbitrary ways. This insight is not taken to be\nabout sets and members, but about divisions into parts and wholes. So\nwe can speak of a great “one” that is a kind of everything\nconcept—nothing lies outside it and of a small “one”\nwhich cannot be further distinguished or divided. Objectively there\nare no distinctions—the cosmos is one, and we should direct the\nsame guiding attitudes toward the whole—“love all things\nequally.” \nFrom internal evidence, we would judge Hui Shi to have had much more\ninfluence on Zhuangzi than his knowledge of Laozi or of the contents\nof the Daode Jing as we know it. Hui Shi appears more often\nin dialogue with Zhuangzi than any other figure and in ways that\nsuggest a long-term philosophical involvement and interaction, like\nrelationship of philosophical\n friends.[6]\n And, as we observed, the inner chapters of the Zhuangzi show\nmastery of the technical terminology and state of the art theories of\nlanguage in ancient China. Still the tone seems “Daoist”\nin the senses we’ve identified. Zhuangzi marks the high point of\nmature Daoist philosophical theory as he finds a better way to answer\nlater Mohist challenges than did Hui Shi.  \nZhuangzi finds a “naturalist” position that coherently\nexplains why dao has normative priority over\ntiannature:sky. The way to\navoid the anti-language trap is: \nThe first may superficially appear to give in to the Confucians and\nMohists—allowing them to claim that tiannature’s\nendorses their respective social\nways. However, its Daoist thrust consists in depriving the\nabsolutists of what they really want—the ability to\ndeclare that their opponent violates tiannature:sky\nor lacks its similar approval. The\nstrategy draws on the correct lesson to be learned from Shen Dao’s\nnotion of great dao—that “follow nature”\nhas no normative significance.  \nWe can only answer normative questions from within dao, not\nfrom the perspective of nature or any other authority. The point is\nthat ‘authority’ is a normative concept within some\ndao so any appeal presupposes a dao of following it.\nThus Zhuangzi’s first step does not warrant treating all discourse\ndao as right or as wrong—or even as equal. We make\nnormative or evaluative judgments only against the background of a\npresupposed way of justifying and interpreting them. The judgments\ndepend on some discourse dao. \nThe priority of dao over tiannature:sky\nunderwrites the themes of dependency\nand relativism that pervade the Zhuangzi and ultimately the\nskepticism, the open-minded toleration and the political anarchism (or\ndisinterest in political activity or involvement). Yet, while nature\nis not a standard, Daoism does countenance natural daos.\nMohism had presupposed one (a natural impulse to benefit) as had the\nConfucian intuitionist, Mencius (a natural moral tendency in the\nheart-mind). Zhuangzi’s accepts there must be some natural or\n innate guides,\n but notes: \nSo the dependence on dao multiplies endlessly. The\nZhuangzi hints at this in a famous image, humans live and act\nin ways as fish live and act in water. We don’t notice in how many\nways we depend on ways. Being in a sea of ways is\nbeing human. (This insight has inspired many writers to draw a\nparallel with Heidegger’s Dasein.) We cannot get outside of\ndao to any more ultimate kind of authority.  \nThese meta-reflections inform relativist (perspectival or pluralist)\nand skeptical themes in the inner chapters of the Zhuangzi.\nThe style furthers both themes. Rather than speaking with an authorial\nvoice, the text is filled with fantasy conversations between\nperspectives, including those of millipedes, convicts, musicians and\nthe wind. A Zhuangzi reflective passage is more likely to end\nwith a double rhetorical question (“is it … or isn’t it\n… ?”) than a strong conclusion.  \nDoes Zhuangzi then have anything to teach us? His is an example of the\nkey lesson—open-minded receptivity to all the different voices\nof dao—particularly those who have run afoul of human\nauthority or seem least authoritative. Each actual (naturally)\nexisting dao has insights. They may be surprisingly\nvaluable—as viewed from within our different ways. On\nthe flip side, we gain nothing from trying to imagine a perfect or\nultimate source of guidance. If there were a perfect man or ideal\nobserver-actor, we probably could not understand him. Would his ways\nhave any relevance for us with our limits? Perfection may well look\nlike its opposite to us.  \nLaozi may have been tempted to postulate a perfect dao. It\nwould be a dao with no social contribution. So the\nZhuangzi differs in this important attitude from the\nLaozi—we need not try to escape from social life and\nconventions. Conventions underlie the possibility of communication and\nare, thus, useful. This gives Zhuangzi’s Daoism less of the primitive\nthrust of the Daode Jing (the term wu-wei virtually\ndisappears in the inner chapters).  \nThe most dramatic message of the Zhuangzi is a theme that\nlinks Daoism to Zen (Chan—the distinctively Daoist influenced\nbranch of Buddhism)—the “mysticism” of losing\noneself in activity, particularly the absorption in skilled execution\nof a highly cultivated way . His most famous example concerns\na butcher—hardly a prestige or status profession—who\ncarves beef with the focus and absorption of a virtuoso dancer in an\nelegantly choreographed performance. The height of human satisfaction\ncomes in achieving and exercising such skills with the focus and\ncommitment that gets us “outside ourselves” and into such\nan intimate connection with our dao .  \nOther examples include lute players, cicada catchers, wheelwrights and\nlogicians. Each description has a hint of realism in the recognition\nwe must put in effort to acquire the skills and then to convert them\nto “second nature.” We come to see them as natural and as\nourselves being at one with nature. Yet in the throes of skillful\nperformance, we still can perfect them more and no matter how good we\nmay become at one thing, may be miserable at others—particularly\nat conveying the skills to others. \nFinally politically, Zhuangzi famously prefers fishing to high status\nand political office. He asks what a turtle would choose if offered\nthe option of being nailed in a place of veneration an honor in some\nplace of worship or staying at the lake and “dragging his tail\nin the mud.” However this anti-political stance is unlikely to\nbe grounded in simple self-preservation. The openness of Zhuangzi’s\npluralism does undermine the justification of political authority that\nwas assumed in ancient China. Confucians and Mohists disagreed\nbitterly about what dao to follow in a society, but agreed\nwithout question that proper order was achieved only when a society\nfollowed a single dao . Zhuangzi’s stance suggests that\nsociety could function with people following many ways of acting.\nNothing requires suppressing or eliminating a dao that works from some\npoint of view.  \nThe Zhuangzi text, as we noted, contains the writings of a\nrange of thinkers loosely allied with these Daoist themes. Large\nsections lean toward the primitivism of Laozi and others emphasize the\nrelativism, and still others become eclectic and uncritical in their\nopenness. For a more complete account see the entry on Zhuangzi and\n Texts and Textual Theory\n below. \nThe establishment of an authoritarian empire and the long-lived but\nphilosophically dogmatic (Confucian) Han dynasty temporarily drained\nthe vibrancy from Chinese philosophical thought. Classical Daoist\nphilosophy was successfully extinguished by the imperial suppression\nof analytic thought. Confucian authoritarians like Xunzi argued that\nanalysis of names leads to confusion and disorder. The substitution of\nthe Qin ruler’s superstitious search for long life through alchemy and\nhis consequent fostering of Huang-Lao religion combined with\nsuppression of dialectic thought initiated China’s philosophical\n“Dark Age.” The later substitution of Confucianism as the\nofficial orthodoxy during the Han cemented the intellectual stagnation\nfirmly in place. Only Huang-Lao thinking remained as a live influence\nand archivist of Daoist texts. Its superstitions and cosmologies\nmingled in the emerging eclectic Han-Confucianism.  \nThe fall of the Han some 400 years later saw the emergence of a\nmodified worldview drawing on the preserved texts which we call\nNeo-Daoism (See Neo-Daoism). Its most influential writers, Wang Bi and\nGuo Xiang who wrote commentaries respectively on the Daode\nJing and the Zhuangzi, were avowed Confucians. Their\nphilosophy reinvested a stoic spirit which they interpreted as the\npoint of their new-Daoism. They expressed their combination of\nConfucian social activity with their version of Daoist quietism in the\nenduring slogan “Sage within, king without.” They framed\ntheir Daoism as a kind of inner emptiness or non-commitment coupled\nwith a meticulous conformity to one’s actual role in the\ntimes—whatever fate might have it. Thus they were Confucians on\nthe outside and Daoists inside. This elaborated, for Neo-Daoists, the\nconcept of wu-wei (non-deeming action). \nThey buttressed this social stoicism with metaphysical systems focused\non the puzzle of “being and non-being.” The drew this\ntopic from one of Laozi’s frequent inclusion of this pair to\nillustrate his contrast theory of language. Trying to figure what the\nbackground of a being and non-being contrast was formed a central\nissue for their “abstruse studies.” Wang Bi (ca. 300) took\nnon-being to be the background and thus to “give rise to”\nbeing. He interpreted the Laozi alongside a Confucianized\ncosmological divination manual, The Book of Changes (I\nChing or Yijing). The Book of Changes with its\nyin-yang account of change and its generational cosmology\nthus entered the list of Daoist texts and the Daode Jing was\ntransformed in conventional wisdom into a detached cosmology. \nWang Bi identified dao with non-being while still treating it\nas the source of all creation—the basic substance (which he\nassociated with the taijiGreat\nultimate of the Yijing).\nWhile the basic substance is nothing, its “function” is\nbeing—thus being depends on non-being, from which it is\nconstantly produced as a kaleidoscopic function of an unchanging,\nparadoxical reality of nothing. (The ideal Daoist-Confucian person\nmirrors this cosmology—an expression of being a “Sage\nwithin; king without”.) \nThe second famous Neo-Daoist, Guo Xiang commented on the\nZhuangzi . His cosmology developed an interesting twist on\nthat of Wang Bi. Non-being, he argued, did not, after all, exist. It\nwas simply nothing and thus could not create anything. Simply put,\nthere is no non-being—there is only being. And so there is no\n“giving rise to.” Being always was and comes of itself. It\ngenerates and changes itself constantly by the totality the\ninterrelations among its parts. These differences in emphasis partly\nreflect the differences in the original texts—the Daode\nJing’s emphasis on wunon-being-values\nand the Zhuangzi’s\ndiverse pluralism and sense of freedom from any ultimate cosmic source\nof guidance. \nPragmatically, the two pictures were not very different. Each still\nhad nothing at the center (Daoist sage) and being (Confucian King)\naround the edges, but Guo Xiang deemphasized any lines of force from\nnon-being to being and emphasized instead the situation and contextual\nrelations within the realm of being. Both similarly read their\ncosmologies as ways of viewing things that support and help achieve\nthe shared lifestyle slogan “sage within, king without.”\n \nBuddhism came to China at a time when the intellectuals were hungry\nfor fresh ideas, but it arrived with massive handicaps. It was saddled\nwith the Indo-European focus on an appearance-reality metaphysics and\nepistemology, with with approximations to concepts of\n‘truth’, sense-data experience, mind as a container of a\nsubjective world populated by counterparts of sensible objects,\npropositional knowledge, representational belief, a belief-desire\npsychology together with a logic-informed concept of\n‘reason’ as both a human faculty and a property of beliefs\nand concepts. The highly developed Buddhist arguments had little\npurchase on Chinese intellectuals and the only available common form\nof discourse that could “domesticate” this alien system\nwas Neo-Daoist “abstruse learning” which focused on the\nmetaphysical notions of being and non-being. That issue resonated\nsuperficially with a Buddhist puzzle about the nature of Nirvana. If\nNirvana was the opposite of Samsara (the eternal cycle of rebirth or\nreincarnation) then was it a state of being or of non-being? Nirvana\nis the achievement of the Buddha—the expression of\nBuddha-nature. So the cosmology of this version of Buddhism, like that\nof the Neo-Daoists, aided achievement of some goal. Realization of the\npuzzling nature of this state led to Buddhahood. \nMeantime, Buddhism came armed with a paradox that would delight\nthinkers of a Daoist turn of mind—the fabled paradox of desire.\nRebirth was caused by desire and Nirvana could be achieved only by the\ncessation of desire. That meant that in order to achieve Nirvana, one\nhad to cease to want to achieve it. This argument informs the Mahayana\nnotion of a Bodhisattva, who qualifies for Nirvana but voluntarily\nstays behind in the cycle of rebirth to help the rest of us.\nEnlightenment could only be achieved all at once. (This conclusion was\nalso a consequence of the Buddhist view that the ego is an illusion.)\nThe Mahayana wing of Buddhism was the more successful in China because\nthis implicit egalitarianism—everyone could be Buddha, just as\neveryone can be a Daoist or Confucian Sage. \nThe other Buddhist philosophy that had the greatest appeal in China\nwas Madyamika, which answered the question of the nature of Nirvana or\nthe Buddha nature by not answering it—Neo-Daoist quietism. The\nrealization of this emptiness was a kind of non-realization, a giving\nup, or an inexpressible, mystical, prajna-knowledge which\ncontrasts with “ordinary” knowledge. This helped blend\ndiscussion of dao and Buddha-nature even more and fueled the\neventually widespread Confucian bias that they were the same basic\nreligion. \nMeantime, the introduction of a more “Western” religious\nmodel (monasticism) to China and coincided with the launch of\norganized “Daoist” religions. Modeled thus in style and\nprogressively in content, Daoist religion, the quasi-religious\nNeo-Daoist stoical quietism began to blend with Buddhism.  \nIn China, the two dominant theoretical Buddhist sects reflect the\ncosmological structures of the two Neo-Daoists. Tian-tai is\n“center dominated” with a single thought (the\ninexpressible Madyamika Buddha-nature) determining everything. Hua-yan\nshifts emphasis to the inter-relations of all “dharmas.”\nIt’s a cosmos of interaction that constitutes the expression of Buddha\nnature.  \nThe most Daoist of Chinese sects is famously the Chan (Japanese\n‘Zen’) sect. We can understand its Daoist character by\nreturning to the paradox of desire. Laozi’s analysis says artificial\ndesires are those created by learned distinctions. If we are to\neliminate the desire for Nirvana, it must be by\n“forgetting” the dichotomy of Nirvana-Samsara. This\nrealization is both the inner reality of enlightenment and corresponds\nto a mystical answer to the being/non-being of Nirvana. It underwrites\nthe Chan/Zen emphasis on practice, the here and\nnow—“every moment Zen”—and the signature\n“realization” that we are already Buddha. The Buddha\nnature is your self-nature—again exemplifying the Neo-Daoist\n“Sage within, King without” spirit. \nDaoist simplicity stimulated Chan’s abandonment of Buddhist\ntheory and was accompanied by another traditional Daoist\nfeature—the emphasis on total absorption in practice of a highly\ncultivated skill. Chinese Zen was dominated by the notion of\n“sudden enlightenment” which consists of the denial that\nany process leads anyone closer to the Buddha-nature. You can’t get\nany closer—you’re just there. Pay attention!  \nSome important concepts that have played a role in the doctrines of\nDaoism are:  \nDaoism has a reputation of being impenetrable mainly because of its\ncentral concept, dao. Yet surprisingly, the almost universal\ntranslation in English uses one of the smallest, simplest, most\nfamiliar and least consciously noticed terms of the\nlanguage—‘way.’ This common translation,\n‘way’, is apt in several ways. Dao (Tao) is a\npivotal concept of ancient Chinese thought. ‘Way’ is\nsimilarly primitive (it resists analytic definition). We can only\noffer synonyms: e.g., ‘course’, ‘method’,\n‘manner’, ‘mode’, ‘style’,\n‘means’, ‘practice’, ‘fashion’,\n‘technique’ and so on. We discover the circularity when we\ntry to analyze one of the synonyms without recourse to the term\n‘way’ with which we began. \nThe partial synonyms, however, remind us of a second way in which\n‘way’ is an apt translation of dao. A way is the\nanswer to a “how” or “what-to-do” question. We\ntypically use talk of ways in advising someone. Ways are deeply\npractical (i.e., prescriptive or normative).  \nDao is also used concretely to refer to a road or path in Chinese,\ne.g., Queen’s Road. Again, ‘way’ fits this metaphorical\nrole—as in highway and Broadway. In figurative\nEnglish use they are interchangeable—the road/way to salvation.\nRoads guide us and facilitate our arrival at a desired destination.\nThey are, as it were, physically real guiding or\nprescriptive structures. \nThough practical, describing something as a dao or a way need\nnot be to recommend it. The Zhuangzi reminds us that thievery\nhas a dao . We can use both dao and\n‘way’ mainly to describe—as when a Confucian\nundertakes to pursue his father’s dao for three years after\nhis death or we say “I saw the way you did that.”  \nThere are interesting differences between dao and\n‘way’. Chinese nouns lack pluralization, so dao\nfunctions grammatically like a singular or mass term and semantically\nlike a plural. The first tempts translators to render all occurrences\nas “the way.” One is better advised to treat\ndao as a collective noun—as the part-whole sum of ways.\nWhat we think of as one way would be one\npart of dao.  \nWe partition dao by modification. So we can talk about, e.g.,\nmy-dao, Sage-King’s-dao, natural-dao,\npast-time’s-dao and so forth. This feature explains why\ndao appears more metaphysical than ‘way’ and\ninvites the familiar Daoist spatial metaphors like “humans\ninteract in dao as fish do in water” (Zhuangzi\nCh. 6). Dao is a little like the\nwater—an expanse constituting the realm in which humans live,\nwork and play. To be human is to be in a realm of ways to guide us.\nDaoists are more likely to play with these metaphysical metaphors than\nare Confucians or Mohists—who mainly point to (their favored\npart of) dao.  \nAnother difference is that while both dao and\n‘way’ are almost ineliminable terms in their respective\nlanguages, We have hardly noticed the word ‘way’ in\nphilosophy. It’s barely visible in the history of Western\nphilosophy—more like a bit of grammatical filler. Western\nphilosophers have endlessly analyzed and dissected a cluster of terms\nthought to be central to our thinking, e.g., ‘good’,\n‘right’, ‘being’ (to be), ‘know’,\n‘believe’, ‘true’, ‘beautiful’,\n‘reason’, ‘change’, ‘subject’,\n‘mind’, ‘meaning’, ‘refer’,\n‘object’, ‘property’, and so forth. Some\ntrends have focused on sub-types and partial counterparts like\n‘methods’, ‘modes’, ‘practices’,\n‘manners’, ‘plans’ and in some sense even\n‘forms’. Yet one looks in vain to find a Western\nphilosopher showering her analytic attention on the more general\nconcept of ‘way’.  \nDao, by contrast, was the center of Chinese\nphilosophical discussion. It occupies the position at the center of\nthought that in Western philosophy is filled by terms like\n‘being’ or ‘truth’. The centrality tempts\ninterpreters to identify dao with the central concepts of the\nWestern philosophical agenda, but that is to lose the important\ndifference between the two traditions. Metaphysics and epistemology\ndominated early Western philosophy while ethics, politics and\nphilosophy of education/psychology dominated Chinese thought. Although\nit’s insightful to say humans live in dao as fish do in\nwater, the insight is lost if we simply treat dao as being or\nsome pantheistic spiritual realm. Dao remains essentially a\nconcept of guidance, a prescriptive or normative term. In the late\nClassical period, dao paired with devirtuosity\nto form the Chinese term for\n‘ethics’ “dao-de.” Dao is\nthe pivot of Chinese philosophy—but it still translates as\n‘way’, not ‘being’. \nA third difference is that unlike ‘way’, dao may\nbe used as a verb. The best known example is the famous first line of\nthe Daode Jing. Literally “dao can be\ndao not constant dao.” For the dao in\nthe middle of the three daos in the passage, roughly one out\nof three translators uses ‘speak’, another third use\n‘tell’ and the rest use near synonyms such as\n‘expressed’, “defined in words”, or\n‘stated’. In a famous Confucian example of this use,\nConfucius criticizes dao-ing the people with laws rather than\ndao-ing them with ritual. (This verbal sense is now often\nmarked by a graphic variation daoto\ndirect). \nThroughout classical texts, we find that daos are spoken,\nheard, forgotten, transmitted, learned, studied, understood and\nmisunderstood, distorted, mastered, and performed with pleasure.\nDifferent countries and historical periods have different\ndao. Footprints of the linguistic component of the concept of\ndao are scattered through all kinds of modern Chinese\ncompound words. ‘Preach’ is jiang-dao—speak a\ndao. To know is to know a dao. The character\ndao is part of compounds translated as\n‘doctrine’, ‘truth’, ‘principle’,\n‘law’ and of course, ‘morality’ or\n‘ethics’, ‘reason’, ‘religion’,\n‘philosophy’, ‘orthodoxy’,\n‘thank’, ‘apologize’, ‘tell’,\n‘explain’, ‘inform’ and so on.  \nIs ‘speak’ the right way to translate these verbal uses of\ndao? It is in some ways too narrow and in others too broad.\nWe can write, gesture, point, and exemplify as well as speak\ndaos. On the other hand, not all speaking (writing etc.) is\ndao-ing—particularly not if we think of language as\ndescribing, representing, picturing, expressing, defining, or\n“capturing” some reality. The Chinese verbal use, is more\naccurately translated normatively as “to guide”, “to\nrecommend, advocate, acknowledge, endorse”, etc. The activity of\ndao-ing is primarily normative: giving guidance. To\ndao is to put guidance into language—including body\nlanguage (e.g. pointing as meaning something in our “form of\nlife.”)  \nConsider, again, the concrete translation for dao:\n‘road’ or ‘path’. A woodsman with an ax\ndaos when he chops bark from the trees as he enters the\nforest; He is dao-ing when “blazing” the trail.\nWe grasp this concept best if we resist treating roads as simple\nnatural objects—they are, like the woodman’s blazes, akin to\ntexts that we “read” for guidance as we proceed that\nway. Roads or paths are embodied in a physical\nreality, but are not simply the reality. They are objectively real\nnormative structures that guide or invite us to “pass this\nway”.  \nOne feature that dao and speech share is the need for\ninterpretation. But with dao the interpretation takes the\nform of xingwalk:conduct,\nnot that of a theory or a belief. In this respect, the relevant notion\nof interpretation is aesthetic. It is the kind of interpretation done\nwhen a conductor interprets a score, an actor a character in a play, a\nsoldier his orders in the course of battle. A complete metaphysics of\ndao requires a distinction between normative way\ntypes and interpretive, real-time tokens . Daoist\ntheory does introduces the tokens most dramatically with Shen Dao who\nfocuses on what he calls Great Dao—the actual history of the\nworld past, present and future. That image draws our attention to a\npurely descriptive way—a way that is not a (normative) way (not\na guide).  \nTo talk, however, about a way of interpreting a way, is to remind\nourselves of Zhuangzi’s point. That we can never free normative ways\nfrom ways of choosing and interpreting them. In selecting it from the\nalternative “invitations” open to us, and then in\ninterpreting in our actual “walking” we always rely on\nsome higher-order dao to justify our choice and execution of\nit. We are in a sea of dao.  \nBesides the Great Dao (the actual history of the universe),\nwe can speak of tiannature:skydaos, which are\nalso descriptive. Daos that advise us to accept or live by\nour nature, in effect, choose among equally natural daos.\nSince we have natural ways to reform or compensate for our natures.\nAny dao we can choose or interpret is natural in the sense\nthat it has for us at the time some physical realization—sound\nwaves or pixels on a computer screen. All daos available for\nchoice or recommendation are natural. If determinism is true, the\nGreat Dao is the only tiannature:skydao and every available\ndao for normative choice is a proper part of Great Dao.  \nA Daoist formula for de is “dao within.”\nIt may be the result of innate skill or of careful cultivation and\ntraining. Translators most commonly use “virtue” as a\ntranslation but hurry to remind us that it is ‘virtue’ in\nthe ancient Greek sense of an excellence. ‘Power’ is an\nalternative translation that reflects the link between de and\nsuccessful action or achievement for its possessor. Given our use of\nan aesthetic conception of interpretation of dao, we may\nthink of one’s de as her ‘virtuosity’. Virtuosity\nexhibits itself in a performer by making his\n“interpretation” of the thing performed (a ceremony, chant\nor ritual) work in the context. Thus de links dao\nwith correct performance. This elegantly blends in the perceived\novertones of “power” in the form of the performer’s\nability to respond to clues in the context that make the performance\n“work.” The “powerful” performance achieves\nthe dao’s goal in real time. \nThe character mingnames\nreally includes all words. Grammatically, Chinese common nouns share\nmore features with proper names and one-place predicates (transitive\nverbs and adjectives) than do familiar Indo-European nouns. Chinese\ncommon nouns lack case and gender markings and Chinese grammar\nrequires no grammatical noun-verb agreement. Like mass nouns, Chinese\ncommon nouns do not undergo pluralization and can stand alone as noun\nphrases. For related reasons, Chinese analysis postulated no\nsubstance-attribute structure to adjective-noun relations. So the\ntranslation ‘name’ is not inept nor is the ancient Chinese\ntheory assumption that all words name the part of reality which the\nword “picks out”—roughly “naming” what\nwe think of as its denotation or scope. Thus ‘white’ is a\nname and ‘horse’ is a name. Each names a region\nor part of the world.  \nThe most familiar statement of a widely shared implicit theory of\nnames in ancient China is expressed beautifully in the Daode\nJing. Call it the “contrast theory” of names. It\ntreats all words (norms or values) as “coming with” a\ncomplement, converse or opposite. To learn and understand a word is to\nknow what is and what is not picked out by it. In the Daode\nJing, the theory lends itself to a linguistic idealist\ninterpretation. Names literally “create” things. This line\nof interpretation informs the “chaos” interpretation of\nDaoist metaphysics in which reality is an undifferentiated stuff which\nhumans divide into “things” by the use of\nmingnames.  \nAn interesting near homonym is mingcommand-fate\nwhich was routinely used as a\nverbal form of mingnames.\nThe familiar practice is to translate it as either\n‘command’ (reminding us of the Chinese view that the role\nof language and names is guiding and coordinating behavior) or as\n‘fate’. Another meaning-related near homonym is\nmingdiscerning:clear. \nThere is less controversy about the meaning of\nchangconstant, but its uses\nand importance in Chinese thought are not well understood. We can\nbetter appreciate the uses of changconstant\nin ancient Chinese by analogy with\ncausal and reliability theories in epistemology and semantics. Hu Shih\nspeculated that in this use, changconstant\nresembled a pragmatic conception of\n‘true’. He pointed to a related use in the Mozi\nwhich advocates that we should changconstant\nlanguage that promotes [good?]\nbehavior. This quasi-imperative use underlies its role in Daoist\nrelativistic and skeptical analysis. The Daode Jing has the\nmost famous example of its use in the parallel opening couplet where\nit modifies both dao and mingnames.\n \nMohist use of the concept is instructive.\nTiannature:sky is a\nparadigm of constancy. The Mohists alluded to its regularity and\nuniversality to contrast with the temporary and local authority of\nsocial conventions and guidance by authority. They cast their\ndisagreement with Confucians in terms of who offered a constant\ndao. This seems to bridge three measures of constancy.  \nDaoists, as the Laozi famously puts it, suggest that any\ndao that can dao (guide or be used as a guide) will\nnot be a constant dao. It follows this claim with a parallel\nclaims about mingnames. Any\nname that can name is an inconstant name. This is arguably offered as\nthe explanation of the inconstancy of dao asserted in the earlier\nsentence.  \nLaozi’s famous slogan has puzzled interpreters for centuries and has\ngiven rise to numerous analyses. The first character is not the main\nproblem. Wu is simply “does not exist.” In this\nphrase, however, interpreters treat it as a negative prescription:\n“avoid wei.” The harder problem is to understand\nwei. \nIn modern Mandarin, the character has two different tones. The fourth\ntone reading is usually translated as “for the sake of.”\nIn the second tone reading, the character would normally be translated\nas ‘to act’. Textbook interpretations say wei\nmeans ‘purpose’ as well as ‘action’, so the\nslogan means “non-purposive action.” The second tone\nreading, however, has another important use. Some grammar textbooks\ncall it the putative sense—“to deem, regard or\ninterpret.” Wei functions in this sense in Literary\nChinese belief ascriptions which focus on the predicate. So a belief\nthat S is P takes the de re form [believer] takes S to be\n(wei) P. Wei also figures in a related way in\nknowledge contexts with nominal predicates—“know to deem\nas (wei) [noun].”  \nAncient Chinese has several meaning-related homonyms, including weiis-only,\nweito\nbe called, and weiartificial.\nThe latter adds a\n‘human’ radical to weido:deem.\nTypical translations of this character\ninclude ‘artificial’ or ‘false’. The cluster\nof concepts correspond to the pivotal Daoist contrast between\ntian (nature) and ren (the human). Wei is\nsomething done by human conceptualizing rather than something\n“natural.” If we include this content in our explanation\nof Laozi’s use of wei, we can explain its role more fully\nthan does the theory on acts while lacking ‘purpose’ or\ndeliberation. Little in the Laozi (or earlier Chinese\nthought) suggests any development of a distinction between voluntary,\ndeliberate, or purposive action and its opposite. To act without\nwei is to remove the social, conceptual character from our\nbehavior and act on “natural” instinct or intuition. This\nmakes the concept cohere nicely with Laozi’s analysis of names and\nknowledge as forms of social control. \nAs we noted, the “inner chapters” of the Zhuangzi\nrarely mentions the slogan. However, its use in the “outer\nchapters” invites us to construct a possible Zhuangzi version of\nthe slogan. One tempting view associates wu-wei with the\n“inner chapter” discussions of skillful behavior that\ndevelops into a kind of satisfying and tranquil state of harmony with\naction that we might describe as “second nature.” In\neffect one acts while in an aesthetic or performative trance. The most\nfamous expression of this ideal comes in the paean to the butcher who\ncarved oxen with the grace of a dancer. Such behavior requires a focus\nand absorption that is incompatible with ordinary self-consciousness,\npurpose and rehearsal of instructions. Besides this loss of a sense of\nthe ego, the experience is credited with creating a unity between the\nactor and the external world, and with a sense of heightened awareness\nand tranquility that comes with the masterful practice of an acquired\nskill. We experience mastery as “becoming one with the\nactivity.” In some sense, our weiing has become\n[second?] natural! \nThe wu-wei ideal also informs the Neo-Daoist slogan\n“Sage within; king without.” It suggests (following\nZhuangzi) that Daoist wu-wei may be consistent with being a\ngood Confucian. Being a scholar-official is as much a skill as being a\nbutcher and one may practice it with the same attitude of inner\nemptiness. As long as one takes the “right” attitude, one\nmay pursue any activity consistent\nwith Daoism. Neo-Daoists conform to Confucian roles without regarding\nor interpreting them as ultimately right—or as anything\nelse. \nWith the importation of Indo-European Buddhism from India,\nwu-wei started to be interpreted via the Western conceptual\napparatus contrasting desire or purpose and reason. This shaped the\nmodern Chinese interpretation and probably undermined the ideal. It\nbecame the target of attack among “modern” Chinese who\nregarded Daoist “non-striving” or\n“purposelessness” as the source of Chinese passivity. The\nactivist 19th century reformer, Kang You-wei (Kang\nhave-wei) took the denial of the slogan as his scholarly\nname. \nThe Daoist “primitivist” ideal as expressed mainly in the\nLaozi. It metaphorically represents the result of forgetting\nmingnames and desires (See\n Wu-wei).\n Translations include simplicity, “raw” wood, and D. C.\nLau’s more elaborate “uncarved block.” The detailed\ntranslation more sensitively expresses Laozi’s point in using the\nmetaphor in the context of a view of names as “cutting”\nthings into types and Laozi’s distinctive theory that such socially\nconstructed distinctions (institutions) control us by controlling our\ndesires. When societies adopt names or terms, it does so in order to\ninstill and regulate desires for one of the pair created by the\nname-induced distinction. Thus Daoist forgetting requires forgetting\nnames and distinctions, but in doing so, frees itself from the\nsocially induced, unnatural desires that cause strife and unhappiness\nin society (e.g. status, rare objects, fame, authority). Hence:\n“The Nameless uncarved block thus amounts to freedom from\ndesire.” (Daode Jing 37) \nQuestions of textual theory are the focus of the bulk of modern\nscholarship. They include these kinds of questions. \nTraditional “fantastic” textual stories dominated\nexplanations of religious Daoism. This effectively replaces\nphilosophical content with mythical narrative and claims of pedigree\nor status of the founder. This aversion to exposition is compounded\nwith the traditional view that Daoist philosophy defies rational\nclarification. This philosophical site, accordingly, will give only\nabbreviated attention to these textual theories.  \nThe traditional story centers on Laozi and the Daode Jing. It\ncredits the text to Laozi who was stopped at the pass while attempting\nto leave China (to go to India and come to be known as Buddha). The\nkeeper of the pass required him to leave his dao behind so\nLaozi dashed off 5000-odd quick characters of poetry. Zhuangzi\ninherited the insights and developed the Daoist outlook in parable\nform.  \nModern text detectives, Chinese and Western, have successfully cast\ndoubt on this traditional view. However, their alternative scenarios,\nwhile collectively more plausible than the traditional story, are\ndiverse enough to lead a skeptic to conclude that no one\nknows the correct textual theories—even if some of them\nturn out to be true. The time is too remote and the evidence too\nscarce to warrant using “know” of any detailed textual\ntheory. \nTextual theorists themselves tend more toward interpretive skepticism.\nThey argue that textual theory is prior to and more certain than\ninterpretation—which they treat as subjective projection. They\nwould reject textual skepticism as defeatism and as self-defeating for\nan interpretive theorist.  \nCurrent textual thinking tends toward the view that all the classical\nChinese texts were being continuously edited and maintained in textual\ncommunities over sometimes hundreds of years. This editing and\nemendation often reflected interaction with other text communities as\nthey worked out alternative answers to shared questions. Clearly such\nan accretion theory undermines the traditional goal of uncovering the\n“original” in the sense of the earliest version of the\ntext. Text selection for interpretive and theoretical purposes becomes\na more normative issue—which text is best?  \nTextual theory was further complicated when archeologists unearthed\nnew copies of the Daode Jing. The traditionally dominant text\nwas named after one of the earliest commentators—the Wang Bi\nversion. Most translations deviated only slightly from that\ntraditional version prior to the first archeological discovery in\n1973. In that year, two versions of the Daode Jing were\nunearthed in a Mawang Dui tomb site. The discovery energized textual\ntheorists who reasoned that as the earliest physically extant text,\nthe Mawang Dui must be closer to the original should be treated as\nauthoritative. The discovery was quickly followed by a rash of new\ntranslations of the Dedao Jing (the two parts of the text\nwere reversed in the newly discovered manuscripts).  \nThe argument for its authoritative status was weak. The enthusiasm\nrested on the traditional attachment to an “original” text\n(earlier in time). In fact, the discovery tended to confirm the\nevolutionary, multiple-editor view, while this enthusiasm treated\ntextual evolution as if it took place by successive operations on a\nsingle physical text item. Like physiological evolution, text\nevolution more probably operated on a population or\n“stream” of copies, abridgements and additions.  \nWang Bi probably had access to a range of that population in selecting\nhis version. The archeological discovery was of a single\ninstance—a branch of the stream. The historical circumstances of\nthe presumed time of burial further undermined the optimistic\nassumption that the Mawang Dui was the original. The tomb’s date\nplaces the texts after a radical disruption of textual\nhusbandry—in 200 BCE when the Qin “burned books and buried\nscholars.”  \nThe Qin had set out to destroy traditional learning. The later Han\nostensibly cherished and tried to recover textual scholarship. In the\nsucceeding Han, text collection, veneration preservation (and copying)\nbecame the norm. The theory that the Mawang Dui was the authoritative\ntext assumes that the destructive political frenzy at the end of\nclassical period had not affected the integrity of transmission that\nproduced the Mawang Dui instances. Then it must insist that in the\nsucceeding period of textual veneration and\npreservation, radical changes were introduced into the entire\npopulation of copies and versions of the text so that all\nthose on which Wang Bi drew on after the Han were corrupted—and\nin similar ways—from the orthodox Mawang Dui version.  \nThe opposite story is more probable—the sample was a version\nwritten with punctuation and interpretive emendation for a member of\nthe superstitious ruling class. Taking it as representing of the whole\npopulation of texts at the time is an elementary sampling error.  \nThe Mawang Dui fervor was further undermined in 1993 when another\ndiscovery of a still older pair of abridged texts (dating from before\n200 BCE) turned out to be more like the traditional text (the order of\nselection reflected the traditional daode arrangement). Even\nmore notably, it strongly confirmed the gradual accretion view of the\ntext suggesting that the Daode Jing was still in the process\nof being compiled at that late date. This locates the composition of\nthe Daode Jing and the Zhuangzi almost\nside-by-side. \nLaozi’s existence is widely disputed partly because the traditional\nstory seems impossible for one person to satisfy. That only entails,\nhowever, that not all the things in the story are true of him, not\nthat he didn’t exist. On the other hand, there is little positive\nevidence that he did and there are many alternative stories of how he\ncame to be regarded as the author of the Daode Jing. It is\ncommon for theorists to treat ‘Laozi’ as a definite\ndescription referring to “whoever wrote the Daode\nJing.—”Many thus regard the question of his existence\nas equivalent to the question of his authorship of at least a part of\nthe text—hence improbable given current textual theory. The\nissues, however, are also separate. Laozi could have existed and not\nwritten any of the text attributed to him. On balance, the existence\nof Zhuangzi is considerably more probable, though little is known of\nhim that is not from the text bearing his name—many of whose\nstories are obviously fanciful.  \nIn China today, parts of the traditional theory have been resurrected.\nSome scholars are arguing for a pre-Confucius date for Laozi on\nvarious textual grounds (especially poetic structure). Traditional as\nwell as modern scholarship tends to attribute the first eight\n“inner” chapters to Zhuangzi and there has been little\ndoubt about his existence. So far, one important implication of modern\ntextual theory has had little effect on popular interpretations. If we\ninevitably rely on the stories in the Zhuangzi—for\nour knowledge about him, then the known chief intellectual\ninfluence on Zhuangzi should be treated as the sophist and linguistic\ntheorist, Hui Shi, not Laozi or the Daode Jing. \nTextual theories of the Zhuangzi are more elaborate and\nconsistent. Though they differ in details and identification of parts,\ntext scholars largely converge on attributing the chapters, outside of\nthe eight assigned to Zhuangzi himself, to students of Zhuangzi, to\nprimitivists who are associated with Yang Zhu (Yangists), and to other\nmore eclectic and religious writers associated probably with the\nproduction of the other texts associated with Daoism. To be strict,\nhowever, despite the prevalence of the opinion, there is nothing\nresembling a convincing argument that Zhuangzi wrote all eight of the\nso called “inner chapters.”  \nProbably the association of the Laozi and Zhuangzi texts began when\nstudents of Zhuangzi noticed some shared or reinforcing themes\nexpressed in a contemporary anonymous textual group working\non the evolving Daode Jing. Perhaps both groups appreciated\nthe affinity and began to exchange themes, expressions, and related\nlines of thought. Graham argued that the association of Laozi with the\nDaode Jing dates from a conspiratorial attempt to gain\nauthority over Confucianism by claiming that the Daode Jing\nstemmed from Confucius’ teacher who was known in legend as Laozi. \nThis is a rough table of the state of textual theories of the two\ndefining texts of Daoism. There are four main questions; the table\nlists, for each question, the traditional story, the range of\ntheories, and the most plausible answer to the question. \nOther textual theories address the authorship, dating and relations to\nthe two canonical Daoist texts to the later “religious”\ntexts mentioned above. Essentially the upshot is that they borrowed\nheavily from the two classical texts, often changing the context and\nfailing to understand the philosophical point. The quotations they\nused were embedded in popular cosmological and religious contexts.\n","contact.mail":"chansen@hku.hk","contact.domain":"hku.hk"}]
