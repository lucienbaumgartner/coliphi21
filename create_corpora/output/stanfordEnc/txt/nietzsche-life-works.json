He was interested in the enhancement of\nindividual and cultural health, and believed in life, creativity,\npower, and down-to-earth realities, rather than those\nsituated in a world beyond. Central to his philosophy is the idea of\n“life-affirmation,” which involves an honest questioning of\nall doctrines that drain life’s expansive energies, however socially\nprevalent those views might be. Often referred to as one of the first\nexistentialist philosophers along with Søren Kierkegaard\n(1813–1855), Nietzsche’s revitalizing philosophy has inspired leading\nfigures in all walks of cultural life, including dancers, poets,\nnovelists, painters, psychologists, philosophers, sociologists and\nsocial revolutionaries.\n\n\n\nIn the small German village of Röcken bei Lützen, located in\na rural farmland area southwest of Leipzig, Friedrich Wilhelm\nNietzsche was born at approximately 10:00 a.m. on October 15,\n1844. The date coincided with the 49th birthday of the Prussian King,\nFriedrich Wilhelm IV, after whom Nietzsche was named, and who had been\nresponsible for Nietzsche’s father’s appointment as\nRöcken’s town minister. \n\nNietzsche’s uncle and grandfathers were also Lutheran ministers, and\nhis paternal grandfather, Friedrich August Ludwig Nietzsche\n(1756–1826), was further distinguished as a Protestant scholar, one of\nwhose books (1796) affirmed the “everlasting survival of\nChristianity.” Nietzsche’s grandparents on both sides were from\nthe Province of Saxony, with his paternal grandfather, paternal\ngrandmother (Erdmuthe Dorothea Krause, 1778–1856), maternal grandfather\n(David Ernst Ohler, 1787–1859) and maternal grandmother (Johanna\nElisabeth Wilhelmine Hahn, 1794–1876) having been born respectively in\nthe small towns of Bibra (just south of Jena), Reichenbach (southeast\nof Jena), Zeitz (between Jena and Leipzig), and Wehlitz (just northwest\nof Leipzig). \n\nWhen Nietzsche was nearly 5 years old, his father, Karl Ludwig\nNietzsche (1813–1849) died from a brain ailment (July 30, 1849) and the\ndeath of Nietzsche’s two-year-old brother, Ludwig Joseph, traumatically\nfollowed six months later (January 4, 1850). Having been living only\nyards away from Röcken’s church in the house reserved for the\npastor and his family, the Nietzsche family left their home soon after\nKarl Ludwig’s death. They moved to nearby Naumburg an der Saale, where\nNietzsche (called “Fritz” by his family) lived with his\nmother, Franziska (1826–1897), his grandmother, Erdmuthe, his father’s\ntwo sisters, Auguste and Rosalie (d. 1855 and 1867, respectively), and\nhis younger sister, Therese Elisabeth Alexandra (1846–1935). \n\nFrom the ages of 14 to 19 (1858–1864), Nietzsche attended a\nfirst-rate boarding school, Schulpforta, located about 4km from his\nhome in Naumburg, where he prepared for university studies. The\nschool’s rigid educational atmosphere was reflected in its long\nhistory as a former Cistercian monastery (1137–1540), with\nbuildings that included a 12th century Romanesque chapel and a 13th\ncentury Gothic church. At Schulpforta—a school whose alumni\nincluded the German Idealist philosopher, Johann Gottlieb Fichte\n(1762–1814) and the philologist, Ulrich von\nWilamowitz-Möllendorff (1848–1931)—Nietzsche met his\nlifelong friend, Paul Deussen (1845–1919), who was confirmed at\nNietzsche’s side in 1861, and who was to become an Orientalist,\nhistorian of philosophy, and in 1911, the founder of the Schopenhauer\nSociety. During his summers in Naumburg, Nietzsche led a small music\nand literature club named “Germania,” and became\nacquainted with Richard Wagner’s music through the club’s\nsubscription to the Zeitschrift für Musik. The teenage\nNietzsche also read the German romantic writings of Friedrich\nHölderlin and Jean-Paul Richter, along with David Strauss’s\ncontroversial and demythologizing Life of Jesus Critically\nExamined (Das Leben Jesu kritisch bearbeitet, 1848). \n\nAfter graduating from Schulpforta, Nietzsche entered the University\nof Bonn in 1864 as a theology and philology student, and his interests\nsoon gravitated more exclusively towards philology—a discipline\nwhich then centered upon the interpretation of classical and biblical\ntexts. As a student of philology, Nietzsche attended lectures by Otto\nJahn (1813–1869) and Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl (1806–1876). Jahn was a\nbiographer of Mozart who had studied at the University of Berlin under\nKarl Lachmann (1793–1851)—a philologist known both for his\nstudies of the Roman philosopher, Lucretius (ca. 99–55 BCE), and for\nhaving developed the genealogical, or stemmatic, method in textual\nrecension; Ritschl was a classics scholar whose work centered on the\nRoman comic poet, Plautus (254–184 BCE). \n\nInspired by Ritschl, and following him to the University of Leipzig\nin 1865—an institution located closer to Nietzsche’s hometown\nof Naumburg—Nietzsche quickly established his own academic\nreputation through his published essays on two 6th century BCE poets,\nTheognis and Simonides, as well as on Aristotle. In Leipzig, he\ndeveloped a close friendship with Erwin Rohde (1845–1898), a fellow\nphilology student and future philologist, with whom he would correspond\nextensively in later years. Momentous for Nietzsche in 1865 was his\naccidental discovery of Arthur Schopenhauer’s The World as Will and\nRepresentation (1818) in a local bookstore. He was then 21.\nSchopenhauer’s atheistic and turbulent vision of the world, in\nconjunction with his high praise of music as an art form, captured\nNietzsche’s imagination, and the extent to which the “cadaverous\nperfume” of Schopenhauer’s world-view continued to permeate\nNietzsche’s mature thought remains a matter of scholarly debate. After\ndiscovering Schopenhauer, Nietzsche read F.A. Lange’s newly-published\nHistory of Materialism and Critique of its Present\nSignificance (1866)—a work that criticizes materialist\ntheories from the standpoint of Kant’s critique of metaphysics, and\nthat attracted Nietzsche’s interest for its view that metaphysical\nspeculation is an expression of poetic illusion. \n\nIn 1867, as he approached the age of 23, Nietzsche entered his\nrequired military service and was assigned to an equestrian field\nartillery regiment close to Naumburg, during which time he lived at\nhome with his mother. While attempting to leap-mount into the saddle,\nhe suffered a serious chest injury and was put on sick leave after his\nchest wound refused to heal. He returned shortly thereafter to the\nUniversity of Leipzig, and in November of 1868, met the composer\nRichard Wagner (1813–1883) at the home of Hermann Brockhaus\n(1806–1877), an Orientalist who was married to Wagner’s sister,\nOttilie. Brockhaus was himself a specialist in Sanskrit and Persian\nwhose publications included (1850) an edition of the Vendidad\nSade—a text of the Zoroastrian religion, whose prophet was\nZarathustra (Zoroaster). \nWagner and Nietzsche shared an enthusiasm for Schopenhauer, and\nNietzsche—who had been composing piano, choral and orchestral\nmusic since he was a teenager—admired Wagner for his musical\ngenius, magnetic personality and cultural influence. Wagner was the\nsame age Nietzsche’s father would have been, and he had also\nattended the University of Leipzig many years before. The\nNietzsche-Wagner relationship was quasi-familial and sometimes-stormy,\nand it affected Nietzsche deeply.  Early on, he could write (in 1869)\nthat his friendship with Wagner was the “greatest\nachievement” [die größte Errungenschaft] of\nhis life, and he was still energetically engaged in appraising and\npondering Wagner’s cultural significance twenty years later at\nthe end of his writing life.  But Nietzsche broke with Wagner\npersonally and intellectually in the late 1870s, and his assessments\nbecame increasingly negative (and more and more explicit) as time went\non.  Nevertheless, even after their break, Nietzsche was still\nreminiscing wistfully in 1882 about how his days with Wagner had been\nthe best of his life.  During the months surrounding Nietzsche’s\ninitial meeting with Wagner, Ritschl recommended Nietzsche for a\nposition on the classical philology faculty at the University of\nBasel. The Swiss university offered Nietzsche the professorial\nposition, and he began teaching there in May, 1869, at the age of 24.\n \n\nAt Basel, Nietzsche’s satisfaction with his life among his philology\ncolleagues was limited, and he established closer intellectual ties to\nthe historians Franz Overbeck (1837–1905) and Jacob Burkhardt\n(1818–1897), whose lectures he attended. Overbeck—who roomed\nfor five years in the same house as Nietzsche—became\nNietzsche’s close and enduring friend, exchanging many letters with him\nover the years, and rushing to Nietzsche’s assistance in Turin\nimmediately after his devastating collapse in 1889. Nietzsche also\ncultivated his friendship with Richard Wagner and visited him often at\nhis Swiss home in Tribschen, a small town near Lucerne. Never in\noutstanding health, further complications arose from Nietzsche’s\nAugust-October 1870 service as a 25-year-old hospital attendant during\nthe Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), where he participated in the siege\nof Metz. He witnessed the traumatic effects of battle, took close care\nof wounded soldiers, and contracted diphtheria and dysentery. \n\nNietzsche’s enthusiasm for Schopenhauer, his studies in classical\nphilology, his inspiration from Wagner, his reading of Lange, his\ninterests in health, his professional need to prove himself as a young\nacademic, and his frustration with the contemporary German culture, all\ncoalesced in his first book—The Birth of Tragedy\n(1872)—which was published in January 1872 when Nietzsche was\n27. Wagner showered the book with praise, but a vitriolic,\npainfully-memorable and yet authoritative critical reaction by Ulrich\nvon Wilamowitz-Möllendorff—who later became one of Germany’s leading philologists—immediately\ndampened the book’s reception, not to mention Nietzsche’s class\nenrollments in Basel. \n\nWilamowitz-Möllendorff came from an aristocratic family\nof distant Polish descent and knew Nietzsche as a student at Schulpforta. In his critique, he referred to Nietzsche as a disgrace to\nSchulpforta, and said that in light of the latter’s prophetic,\nsoothsaying, exaggerated and historically uninformed style of writing,\nNietzsche should instead “gather tigers and panthers about his knees,\nbut not the youth of Germany.” It is intriguing that in Thus Spoke\nZarathustra, written thirteen years later, Nietzsche invokes the\ncomparable imagery of a lion nuzzling warmly at the knees of\nZarathustra in the book’s concluding and inspirational scene, as if to\nacknowledge that his proper audience is, indeed, not a set of\nuniversity professors. \n\nAs Nietzsche continued his residence in Switzerland between 1872 and\n1879, he often visited Wagner at his new (1872) home in Bayreuth,\nGermany. In 1873, he met Paul Rée (1849–1901), who, while living\nin close company with Nietzsche in Sorrento during the autumn of 1876,\nwould write On the Origin of Moral Feelings (1877). During\nthis time, Nietzsche completed a series of four studies on contemporary\nGerman culture—the Unfashionable Observations\n(1873–76)—which focus respectively upon (1) the historian of\nreligion and culture critic, David Strauss, (2) issues concerning the\nsocial value of historiography, (3) Arthur Schopenhauer and (4) Richard\nWagner, both as heroic inspirations for new cultural standards. \n\nNear the end of his university career, Nietzsche completed\nHuman, All-Too-Human (1878)—a book that marks a\nturning point in his philosophical style and that, while reinforcing\nhis friendship with Rée, also ends his friendship with the\nanti-Semitic Wagner, who comes under attack in a thinly-disguised\ncharacterization of “the artist.” Despite the damage done\nby the unflattering review of The Birth of Tragedy, Nietzsche\nremained respected in his professorial position in Basel, but his\ndeteriorating health, which led to migraine headaches, eyesight\nproblems and vomiting, necessitated his resignation from the university\nin June, 1879, at age 34. At this point, he had been a university\nprofessor for ten years, and had just less than another ten years of\nproductive intellectual life remaining. \n\nFrom 1880 until his collapse in January 1889, Nietzsche led a\nwandering, Roma-like existence as a stateless person (having given up\nhis German citizenship, and not having acquired Swiss citizenship),\ncircling almost annually between his mother’s house in Naumburg and\nvarious French, Swiss, German and Italian cities. His travels took him\nthrough the Mediterranean seaside city of Nice (during the winters),\nthe Swiss alpine village of Sils-Maria (during the summers, located\nnear the present-day ski resort of St. Moritz), Leipzig (where he had\nattended university, and had been hoping to resume his teaching career\nin 1883), Turin, Genoa, Recoaro, Messina, Rapallo, Florence, Venice,\nand Rome, never residing in any place longer than several months at a\ntime. \n\nOn a visit to Rome in 1882, Nietzsche, now at age thirty-seven, met\nLou von Salomé (1861–1937), a 21 year old Russian woman\nwho was studying philosophy and theology in Zurich. He quickly fell in\nlove with her. Declining to develop her relationship with\nNietzsche on a romantic level, Nietzsche’s friendship\nwith her and Paul Rée took a turn for the worse, for Salomé and Rée left Nietzsche and moved to Berlin. In\nthe years to follow, Salomé would become an associate of\nSigmund Freud, and would write with psychological insight of her\nassociation with Nietzsche.  Salomé also shows some real insight into Nietzsche’s works, and was one of the first to propose the division of Nietzsche’s writings into early, middle, and late periods. \n\nThese nomadic years were the occasion of Nietzsche’s main works,\namong which are Daybreak (1881), The Gay Science\n(1882/1887), Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883–85), Beyond Good\nand Evil (1886), and On the Genealogy of Morals (1887).\nNietzsche’s final active year, 1888, saw the completion of The Case\nof Wagner (May-August 1888), Twilight of the Idols\n(August-September 1888), The Antichrist (September 1888),\nEcce Homo (October-November 1888) and Nietzsche Contra\nWagner (December 1888). \n\nOn the morning of January 3, 1889, while in Turin, Nietzsche\nexperienced a mental breakdown which left him an invalid for the rest\nof his life. Coincidentally, on virtually the same date, viz., January\n4, his little brother, Joseph, had died many years before. Nietzsche,\nupon witnessing a horse being whipped by a coachman at the Piazza Carlo\nAlberto—although this episode with the horse could be \nanecdotal—threw his arms around the horse’s neck and collapsed in the\nplaza, never to return to full sanity. \n\nSome argue that Nietzsche was afflicted with a syphilitic infection\n(this was the original diagnosis of the doctors in Basel and Jena)\ncontracted either while he was a student or while he was serving as a\nhospital attendant during the Franco-Prussian War; some claim that his\nuse of chloral hydrate, a drug which he had been using as a sedative,\nundermined his already-weakened nervous system; some speculate that\nNietzsche’s collapse was due to a brain disease he inherited from his\nfather; some maintain that a mental illness gradually drove him insane;\nsome maintain that he suffered from a slow-growing, frontal cranial\nbase tumor; some maintain that he suffered from CADASIL syndrome, a\nhereditary stroke disorder; some maintain that Nietzsche suffered from a tumor on the surface of the brain growing behind his right eye. The exact cause of Nietzsche’s incapacitation remains unclear. That he had an extraordinarily sensitive nervous constitution and took an assortment of medications is\nwell-documented as a more general fact. To complicate matters of\ninterpretation, Nietzsche states in a letter from April 1888 that he\nnever had any symptoms of a mental disorder. \n\nDuring his creative years, Nietzsche struggled to bring his writings\ninto print and never doubted that his books would have a lasting\ncultural effect. He did not live long enough to experience his\nworld-historical influence, but he had a brief glimpse of his growing\nintellectual importance in discovering that he was the subject of 1888\nlectures given by Georg Brandes (Georg Morris Cohen) at the University\nof Copenhagen, to whom he directed the above April 1888 correspondence,\nand from whom he received a recommendation to read Kierkegaard’s works.\nNietzsche’s collapse, however, followed soon thereafter. \n\nAfter a brief hospitalization in Basel, he spent 1889 in a\nsanatorium in Jena at the Binswanger Clinic, and in March 1890 his\nmother took him back home to Naumburg, where he lived under her care\nfor the next seven years in the house he knew as a youngster. After his\nmother’s death in 1897, his sister Elisabeth—having returned\nhome from Paraguay in 1893, where she had been working since 1886 with\nher husband Bernhard Förster to establish an Aryan, anti-Semitic\nGerman colony called “New Germany” (“Nueva\nGermania”)—assumed responsibility for Nietzsche’s\nwelfare. In an effort to promote her brother’s philosophy, she rented\nthe “Villa Silberblick,” a large house in Weimar, and moved\nboth Nietzsche and his collected manuscripts to the residence. This\nbecame the new home of the Nietzsche Archives (which had been located\nat the family home for the three years preceding), where Elisabeth\nreceived visitors who wanted to observe the now-incapacitated\nphilosopher. \n\nOn August 25, 1900, Nietzsche died in the villa as he approached his\n56th year, apparently of pneumonia in combination with a stroke. His\nbody was then transported to the family gravesite directly beside the\nchurch in Röcken bei Lützen, where his mother and sister now\nalso rest. The Villa Silberblick was eventually turned into a museum,\nand since 1950, Nietzsche’s manuscripts have been located in Weimar at\nthe Goethe- und Schiller-Archiv \n\nNietzsche’s first book was published in 1872 and was entitled\nThe Birth of Tragedy, Out of the Spirit of Music (Die\nGeburt der Tragödie aus dem Geiste der Musik). Overall, it sets forth a more energetic alternative to the late\n18th/early 19th century understanding of Greek culture—an\nunderstanding largely inspired by Johann Winckelmann’s History of\nAncient Art (1764)—which, grounded on the aesthetics of\nclassical sculpture, hailed ancient Greece as the epitome of noble\nsimplicity, calm grandeur, clear blue skies, and rational serenity. In\n1886, Nietzsche’s book was reissued with a revised title, The Birth\nof Tragedy, Or: Hellenism and Pessimism (Die Geburt der\nTragödie, Oder: Griechentum und Pessimismus), along with a\nlucid and revealing prefatory essay—“An Attempt at\nSelf-Criticism”—which expresses Nietzsche’s own critical\nreflections on the book, looking back fourteen years. Although he remained proud of the work, Nietzsche also describes it as questionable, strange and almost inaccessible, filled with Kantian\nand Schopenhauerian formulas that were inherently at odds with the new\nvaluations he was trying to express. \n\nHaving by this time absorbed the Schopenhauerian view that non-rational forces reside at\nthe foundation of all creativity and of reality itself, and that these forces are artistically best conveyed in music, Nietzsche identifies a\nstrongly instinctual, wild, amoral, “Dionysian” energy\nwithin pre-Socratic Greek culture as an essentially creative and\nhealthy force, locating its prime expression in the tragic chorus, and constituting the very life of the tragedy. Surveying the history of Western culture since the time\nof the Greeks, Nietzsche laments over how this Dionysian, creative\nenergy had been submerged and weakened as it became overshadowed by the\n“Apollonian” forces of logical order and stiff sobriety. He\nconcludes that European culture since the time of Socrates has remained\none-sidedly Apollonian, repressed, scientific, and relatively unhealthy. \n\nAs a means towards a cultural rebirth, Nietzsche advocates in contemporary life, the resurrection\nand fuller release of Dionysian artistic energies—those which\nhe associates with primordial creativity, joy in existence and ultimate\ntruth. The seeds of this liberating rebirth Nietzsche perceives in the German music of his time (viz., Bach, Beethoven and\nespecially Wagner), and the concluding part of The Birth of\nTragedy, in effect, adulates the emerging German artistic, tragic\nspirit as the potential savior of European culture. As one of his early\nbooks, The Birth of Tragedy has a strong Schopenhauerian flavor, and scholars disagree about the extent to which\nNietzsche departs from Schopenhauer in this work and in\nlater works. \n\nSome regard Nietzsche’s 1873 unpublished essay, “On Truth and\nLies in a Nonmoral Sense” (“Über Wahrheit und\nLüge im außermoralischen Sinn”) as a keystone in\nhis thought; some believe that it is a peripheral, conflicted and\nnon-representative fragment in his writings. In this essay, Nietzsche\nrejects the idea of universal constants, and claims, presumably as a\ntruth, that what we call “truth” is only “a mobile\narmy of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms.” His view at\nthis time is that arbitrariness prevails within human experience:\nconcepts originate via the transformation of nerve stimuli into images,\nand “truth” is nothing more than the invention of fixed\nconventions for practical purposes, especially those of repose,\nsecurity and consistency. Nietzsche regards our “knowledge” as human, all-too-human, mostly a matter of self-deception that issues from a deep-seated exercise of metaphorical thought. Viewing our existence from a vast and\nsobering distance, Nietzsche further notes that there was an eternity\nbefore human beings came into existence, and believes that after\nhumanity dies out, nothing significant will have changed in the great\nscheme of things. \n\nBetween 1873 and 1876, Nietzsche wrote the Unfashionable\nObservations (Unzeitgemässe Betrachtungen, also translated as Untimely Meditations or Thoughts Out of Season). These\nare four (of a projected, but never completed, thirteen) studies\nconcerned with the quality of European, and especially German, culture\nduring Nietzsche’s time. They are unfashionable and nonconformist (or\n“untimely,” or “unmodern,” or “out of place”) insofar as Nietzsche\nregarded his standpoint as culture-critic to be in tension with the\nself-congratulatory spirit of the times. The four studies were:\nDavid Strauss, the Confessor and the Writer (David\nStrauss, der Bekenner und der Schriftsteller, 1873); On the\nUses and Disadvantages of History for Life (Vom Nutzen und\nNachteil der Historie für das Leben, 1874); Schopenhauer\nas Educator (Schopenhauer als Erzieher, 1874);\nRichard Wagner in Bayreuth (1876). \n\nThe first of these attacks David Strauss, whose popular six-edition\nbook, The Old and the New Faith: A Confession (1871)\nencapsulated for Nietzsche the general cultural atmosphere in Germany.\nResponding to Strauss’s advocacy of a “new faith” grounded\nupon a scientifically-determined universal mechanism—one,\nhowever, lubricated by the optimistic, “soothing oil” of\nhistorical progress—Nietzsche criticizes Strauss’s view as a\nvulgar and dismal sign of cultural degeneracy. Nietzsche’s friend,\nOverbeck, in his contemporaneous writings, also adopted a critical\nattitude towards Strauss. The second “untimely meditation”\nsurveys alternative ways to write history, and discusses how these ways\ncould contribute to a society’s health. Here Nietzsche claims that the\nprinciple of “life” is a more pressing and higher concern\nthan that of “knowledge,” and that the quest for knowledge\nshould serve the interests of life. This parallels how, in The\nBirth of Tragedy, Nietzsche had looked at art through the perspective\nof life.  \nThe third and fourth studies—on Schopenhauer and Wagner,\nrespectively—address how these two thinkers, as paradigms of\nphilosophic and artistic genius, hold the potential to inspire a\nstronger, healthier and livelier German culture. Nietzsche states here\nthat we all have a duty to help nature complete its goal of producing\nthe highest examples of the human being—these will be the\n“new redeemers”—which he recognizes in superb\ninstances of the philosopher, the artist and the saint\n(“Schopenhauer as Educator,” Section 5).  These\ncelebratory studies on Schopenhauer and Wagner reveal how, as a\nrecurring feature of Nietzsche’s thought, he presents us with some\nhigher type of character—he offers different models of heroic\ncharacters as the years go by—as an ideal towards which he\nwould have his best readers aspire. \n\nNietzsche completed Human, All-Too-Human in 1878,\nsupplementing this with a second part in 1879, Mixed Opinions and\nMaxims (Vermischte Meinungen und Sprüche), and a\nthird part in 1880, The Wanderer and his Shadow (Der\nWanderer und sein Schatten). The three parts were published\ntogether in 1886 as Human All-Too-Human, A Book for Free\nSpirits (Menschliches, Allzumenschliches, Ein Buch für\nfreie Geister). Reluctant to construct a philosophical\n“system,” and sensitive to the importance of style in\nphilosophic writing, Nietzsche composed these works as a series of\nseveral hundred short passages and aphorisms—concise condensations of his assorted insights—whose typical length ranges from a line or\ntwo to a page or two. Here, he often reflects upon cultural and\npsychological phenomena by connecting them to individuals’ organic and\nphysiological constitutions. The idea of power (for which he would\nlater become known) sporadically appears as an explanatory principle,\nbut Nietzsche tends at this time to invoke hedonistic considerations of\npleasure and pain in his explanations of cultural and psychological\nphenomena. Given his harsh criticisms of hedonism and\nutilitarianism in later works (e.g., Thus Spoke Zarathustra,\nre: “the Last Man”), Human All-Too-Human appears to many\nreaders as an uncharacteristic work, more science- than art-inspired in\nits approach to health, where Nietzsche was struggling to break free of\nWagner’s spell, and which, presupposing a fundamentally hedonistic moral psychology, does not fully embody the\npain-and-power-centered approach that he later developed. \n\nIn Daybreak: Reflections on Moral Prejudices\n(Morgenröte. Gedanken über die moralischen\nVorurteile, 1881), Nietzsche continues writing in his aphoristic\nstyle, but he marks a new beginning by accentuating as opposed to\npleasure, the importance of the “feeling of power” in his\nunderstanding of human, and especially of so-called “moral”\nbehavior. Always having been interested in the nature of health, his\nemerging references to power stem from his earlier efforts to discover\nthe secret of the ancient Greeks’ outstanding health, which he had\nregarded as the effects of how “agon” (i.e.,\ncompetition, one-upmanship, or contest, as conceived in his 1872 essay,\n“Homer’s Contest”) permeated their cultural attitudes. In\nthis respect, Daybreak contains the seeds of Nietzsche’s\ndoctrine of the “will to power”—a doctrine that\nappears explicitly for the first time two years later in Thus Spoke\nZarathustra (1883–85). Daybreak is also one of\nNietzsche’s clearest, intellectually calmest, and most intimate,\nvolumes, providing many social-psychological insights in conjunction\nwith some of his first sustained critical reflections on the cultural\nrelativity at the basis of Christian moral evaluations. In this \nbook—as he remarks retrospectively in Ecce Homo \n(1888)—Nietzsche begins his “crusade [Feldzug] against morality.” \n\nIn a more well-known aphoristic work, The Gay Science\n(Die fröhliche Wissenschaft, 1882)—whose title\nwas inspired by the troubadour songs of southern-French Provence\n(1100–1300)—Nietzsche sets forth some of the existential ideas\nfor which he became famous, namely, the proclamation that “God is\ndead” and the doctrine of eternal recurrence—a doctrine\nthat attends to how people of different levels of health are likely to\nreact to the prospect of being reborn, over and over again, to replay\nlife’s experience exactly as before in every pleasurable and painful\nsequence of detail. Nietzsche’s atheism—his account of\n“God’s murder” (section 125)—expresses in a literary manner, his philosophical condemnation of all absolute perspectives and values. His atheism also\naims to redirect people’s attention to their inherent freedom, the\npresently-existing world, and away from escapist, pain-relieving,\nheavenly otherworlds. \n\nTo a similar end, Nietzsche’s doctrine of eternal recurrence\n(sections 285 and 341) serves to draw attention away from all worlds\nother than the one in which we presently live, since eternal recurrence\nprecludes the possibility of any final escape from the present world.\nThe doctrine also functions as a measure for judging someone’s overall\npsychological strength and mental health, since Nietzsche believed that\nthe doctrine of eternal recurrence was the hardest world-view to\naffirm. There are some differences of scholarly opinion concerning\nwhether Nietzsche primarily intends this doctrine to describe a serious\nmetaphysical theory, or whether he is offering merely one way to\ninterpret the world among many others, which if adopted therapeutically\nas a psychologically healthy myth, can help us become stronger. \n\nIn 1887, The Gay Science was reissued with an important\npreface, an additional fifth Book, and an appendix of songs,\nreminiscent of the troubadours. \n\nThus Spoke Zarathustra, A Book for All and None (Also\nSprach Zarathustra, Ein Buch für Alle und Keinen, 1883–85),\nis one of Nietzsche’s most famous works, and Nietzsche regarded it as\namong his most significant. It is a manifesto of personal\nself-overcoming, and a guidebook for others towards the same\nrevitalizing end. Thirty years after its initial publication, 150,000\ncopies of the work were printed by the German government and issued as\ninspirational reading, along with the Bible, to the young soldiers\nduring WWI. Though Thus Spoke Zarathustra is antagonistic to\nthe Judeo-Christian world-view, its poetic and prophetic style relies\nupon many, often inverted, Old and New Testament allusions. Nietzsche\nalso filled the work with nature metaphors, almost in the spirit of\npre-Socratic naturalist philosophy, which invoke animals, earth, air,\nfire, water, celestial bodies, plants, all in the service of describing\nthe spiritual development of Zarathustra, a solitary, reflective,\nexceedingly strong-willed, sage-like, laughing and dancing voice of\nheroic self-mastery who, accompanied by a proud, sharp-eyed eagle and a\nwise snake, envisions a mode of psychologically healthier being beyond\nthe common human condition. Nietzsche refers to this higher mode of\nbeing as “superhuman” (übermenschlich), and\nassociates the doctrine of eternal recurrence—a doctrine for\nonly the healthiest who can love life in its entirety—with this\nspiritual standpoint, in relation to which all-too-often downhearted,\nall-too-commonly-human attitudes stand as a mere bridge to be crossed\nand overcome. \n\nWithin Nietzsche’s corpus, Thus Spoke Zarathustra has a\ncontroversial place, owing mainly to its peculiar literary style.\nNietzsche speaks in parables and short narratives populated by\nfictional characters—“the hunchback,” “the ugliest man,” “the\nsoothsayer,” “the saint,” “the tightrope walker,” “the jester,” and\n“the Last Man,” to name a few—leaving their philosophical import open to a variety of interpretations. One of Nietzsche’s most\nwell-known and morally troubling figures—the \nsuperhuman—also appears substantially only in this work, rendering it questionable\nto some interpreters whether this ideal of supreme human health is indeed central to Nietzsche’s thought as a whole. There is also some interpretive uncertainty about whether the work, which was written across the span of three years, properly ends triumphantly at the conclusion of the Third Part, thus situating the psychologically\ncomplex Fourth Part as a question-raising supplement, or whether the\nbook’s narrative moves smoothly and progressively across the entire\nfour parts. \n\nBeyond Good and Evil, Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future\n(Jenseits von Gut und Böse. Vorspiel einer Philosophie der\nZukunft, 1886) is arguably a rethinking of Human,\nAll-too-Human, since their respective tables of contents and\nsequence of themes loosely correspond to one another. In Beyond\nGood and Evil, Nietzsche identifies imagination, self-assertion,\ndanger, originality and the “creation of values” as\nqualities of genuine philosophers, as opposed to mere scholars engaged in positive research in the sciences and humanities, or the dusty classification of philosophical outlooks. Nietzsche takes aim at some of the world’s great philosophers, who ground their outlooks wholeheartedly upon concepts such as “self-consciousness,” “free\nwill,” and “either/or” bipolar thinking. \n\nNietzsche alternatively philosophizes from the perspective of life\nlocated beyond good and evil, and challenges the entrenched moral idea\nthat exploitation, domination, injury to the weak, destruction and\nappropriation are universally objectionable behaviors. Above all, he\nbelieves that living things aim to discharge their strength and express\ntheir “will to power”—a pouring-out of expansive\nenergy as if one were like a perpetually-shining sun that, quite\nnaturally, can entail danger, pain, lies, deception and masks. Here,\n“will” is not an inner emptiness, lack, feeling of deficiency, or\nconstant drive for satisfaction, but is a fountain of\nconstantly-swelling energy, or power. \n\nAs he views things from the perspective of life, Nietzsche further\ndenies that there is a universal morality applicable indiscriminately\nto all human beings, and instead designates a series of moralities in\nan order of rank that ascends from the plebeian to the noble: some\nmoralities are more suitable for subordinate roles; some are more\nappropriate for dominating and leading social roles. What counts as a\npreferable and legitimate action depends upon the kind of person one\nis. The deciding factor is whether one is weaker, sicker and on the\ndecline, or whether one is healthier, more powerful and overflowing\nwith life. \n\nOn the Genealogy of Morals, A Polemic (Zur Genealogie\nder Moral, Eine Streitschrift, 1887) is composed of three\nsustained essays that advance the critique of Christianity expressed in\nBeyond Good and Evil. The first essay continues the discussion\nof master morality versus servant morality, and maintains that the\ntraditional ideals set forth as holy and morally good within Christian\nmorality are products of self-deception, since they were forged in the\nbad air of revenge, resentment, hatred, impotence, and cowardice. In\nthis essay, as well as the next, Nietzsche’s controversial references\nto the “blond beast” in connection with master morality\nalso appear. In the second essay, Nietzsche continues with an account\nof how feelings of guilt, or the “bad conscience,” arise\nmerely as a consequence of an unhealthy Christian morality that turns\nan evil eye towards our natural inclinations. He also discusses how\npunishment, conceived as the infliction of pain upon someone in\nproportion to their offense, is likely to have been grounded in the\ncontractual economic relationship between creditor and debtor, i.e., in\nbusiness relationships. In the third essay, Nietzsche focusses upon the\ntruth-oriented ascetic ideals that underlie and inform prevailing\nstyles of art, religion and philosophy, and he offers a particularly\nscathing critique of the priesthood: the priests are allegedly a group\nof weak people who shepherd even weaker people as a way to experience\npower for themselves. The third essay also contains one of Nietzsche’s\nclearest expressions of “perspectivism” (section \n12)—the idea that there is no absolute, “God’s eye”\nstandpoint from which one can survey everything that is. \n\nOn the Genealogy of Morals is Nietzsche’s “polemic,” i.e.,\nattack, against the assumptions and methods (which, incidentally, are\nstill popular) characteristic of works such as Paul Rée’s\nThe Origin of the Moral Sensations (1877). Inspired by\nutilitarianism and Darwinism, Rée offers a naturalistic account\nof our moral values, especially altruism, but by Nietzsche’s lights,\ndoes not question the value of the moral values themselves. In the\nGenealogy, Nietzsche offers a competing account of the origin\nof moral values, aiming to reveal their life-negating foundations and\nfunctions. \n\nNietzsche ultimately advocates valuations that issue from a\nself-confident, self-reinforcing, self-governing, creative and\ncommanding attitude, as opposed to those that issue from reactive\nattitudes that determine values more mechanically and subordinatingly to those who are inherently more powerful. For Nietzsche,\nthose who prefer to think in terms of “good vs. bad” exemplify the\nformer, leading and superior mentality, and those who think in terms of\n“good vs. evil,” exemplify the latter, inferior and subservient\nmentality. From the standpoint of a leader, in the appropriate circumstances it is good to be able to inflict pain and instil fear among those who are led, and bad not to be able to do so.  From the standpoint of those who are led, the infliction of pain and instillation of fear upon subordinates does not appear typically to be good at all, but rather evil. \n\nThe Case of Wagner, A Musician’s Problem (Der Fall\nWagner, Ein Musikanten-Problem, May-August 1888), contrasts\nsharply with Nietzsche’s laudatory portrayal of Wagner in The\nBirth of Tragedy (1872), and compares well with his 1873 meditation on\nDavid Strauss in its unbridled attack on a popular cultural figure. In\nThe Case of Wagner, Nietzsche “declares war” upon\nRichard Wagner, whose music is characterized as the epitome of modern\ncultural achievement, but also crucially as sick and decadent. The work\nis a brilliant display of Nietzsche’s talents as a music critic, and\nincludes memorable ridicule of Wagner’s theatrical style, reflections\non redemption via art, a “physiology of art,” and discussion of the\nvirtues associated, respectively, with ascending and descending life\nenergies. As the therapeutic inversion and antithesis of Wagner’s\ndebilitatingly serious music, Nietzsche refers us to Georges Bizet\n(1838–1875) whose music he finds cheerful, revitalizing, redeeming and\nlight-hearted. Wagner himself had some years earlier (1850) condemned\nFelix Mendelssohn (1809–1847) for having confounded the public’s taste\nin music. Nietzsche, writing almost thirty years later, here accuses\nWagner of having done the same. \n\nThe title, Twilight of the Idols, or How One Philosophizes with\na Hammer (Götzen-Dämmerung, oder Wie man mit dem\nHammer philosophiert, August-September 1888), word-plays upon\nWagner’s opera, The Twilight of the Gods (Die\nGötterdämmerung). Nietzsche reiterates and elaborates\nsome of the criticisms of Socrates, Plato, Kant and Christianity found\nin earlier works, criticizes the then-contemporary German culture as\nbeing unsophisticated and too-full of beer, and shoots some\ndisapproving arrows at key French, British, and Italian cultural\nfigures such as Rousseau, Hugo, Sand, Michelet, Zola, Renan, Carlyle,\nMill, Eliot, Darwin, and Dante. In contrast to these alleged\nrepresentatives of cultural decadence, Nietzsche applauds Caesar,\nNapoleon, Goethe, Dostoevski, Thucydides and the Sophists as healthier\nand stronger types. The phrase “to philosophize with a\nhammer” primarily signifies a way to test idols by tapping on\nthem lightly; one “sounds them out” to determine whether\nthey are hollow, or intact, etc., as physician would use a percussion\nhammer upon the abdomen as a diagnostic instrument. \n\nIn The Antichrist, Curse on Christianity (Der\nAntichrist. Fluch auf das Christentum, September 1888 [published\n1895]), Nietzsche expresses his disgust over the way noble values in\nRoman Society were corrupted by the rise of Christianity, and he\ndiscusses specific aspects and personages in Christian \nculture—the Gospels, Paul, the martyrs, priests, the crusades—with a\nview towards showing that Christianity is a religion for weak and\nunhealthy people, whose general historical effect has been to undermine\nthe healthy qualities of the more noble cultures. The\nAntichrist was initially conceived of as the first part of a\nprojected four-part work for which Nietzsche had in mind the title,\nRevaluation of All Values (the second part was to be entitled,\n“The Free Spirit”). As in most of his 1888 works, Nietzsche criticizes,\neither implicitly or explicitly, the anti-Semitic writers of his day. In\nthis particular study, one of his main targets is the French,\nanti-Semitic, Christian historian, Ernest Renan (1823–1892), who was\nknown for works such as The Life of Jesus (1863) and\nHistory of the Origins of Christianity (1866–1881), the fourth\nbook of which was entitled The Antichrist (1873). Some\ninterpret Nietzsche’s title for his book as meaning, “the\nAntichristian.” It should be noted that in an 1883 letter to his\nfriend, Peter Gast [Johann Heinrich Köselitz], Nietzsche does\ndescribe himself self-entertainingly as “the Antichrist,” and also more\nseriously as “the most terrible opponent of Christianity.” \n\nNietzsche describes himself as “a follower of the philosopher\nDionysus” in Ecce Homo, How One Becomes What One Is\n(Ecce Homo, Wie man wird, was man ist, October-November \n1888)—a book in which he examines retrospectively his entire corpus,\nwork by work, offering critical remarks, details of how the works were\ninspired, and explanatory observations regarding their philosophical\ncontents. He begins this fateful intellectual autobiography—he\nwas to lose his mind little more than a month later—with three\neyebrow-raising sections entitled, “Why I Am So Wise,”\n“Why I Am So Clever,” and “Why I Write Such Good\nBooks.” Nietzsche claims to be wise as a consequence of his acute\naesthetic sensitivity to nuances of health and sickness in people’s\nattitudes and characters; he claims to be clever because he knows how\nto choose the right nutrition, climate, residence and recreation for\nhimself; he claims to write such good books because they allegedly\nadventurously open up, at least for a very select group of readers, a\nnew series of noble and delicate experiences. After examining each of\nhis published works, Nietzsche concludes Ecce Homo with the\nsection, “Why I Am a Destiny.” He claims that he is a\ndestiny because he regards his anti-moral truths as having the\nannihilating power of intellectual dynamite; he expects them to topple\nthe morality born of sickness which he perceives to have been reigning\nwithin Western culture for the last two thousand years. In this way, he\nexpresses his hope that Dionysus, the god of life’s exuberance, would\nreplace Jesus, the god of the heavenly otherworld, as the premier\ncultural standard for future millennia. \n\nAlthough Ecce Homo stands historically as Nietzsche’s final\nautobiographical statement, if we consider that—although the\nplans were in flux—Nietzsche was embarking on a new work, at\none point to be entitled, Revaluation of All Values, his 1888\nautobiographical excursion can be appreciated as a kind of\nhouse-cleaning and summing-up of where he had intellectually arrived at\nthat point. Rather than being a final self-definition, it can be seen\nas yet another among Nietzsche’s several efforts over the years to\nclear the way for a freer intellectual development or metamorphosis. In\nthis respect, it compares to Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Book IV,\nwhich appears to be Nietzsche’s squarely facing, almost as a kind of\nexorcism, the variety of inner characters that constituted his\npersonality. Along the same lines, Ecce Homo recalls the\ninterval between Human-All-too-Human and Daybreak,\nwhen Nietzsche plunged to a very low point in his health, coming close\nto death, and then dramatically recuperated. \n\nNietzsche Contra Wagner, Out of the Files of a Psychologist\n(Nietzsche contra Wagner, Aktenstücke eines Psychologen,\nDecember 1888) is a short, but classic, selection of passages Nietzsche\nextracted from his 1878–1887 published works. Many concern Wagner, but\nthe excerpts serve mostly as a foil for Nietzsche to express his own\nviews against Wagner’s. In this self-portrait, completed only a month\nbefore his collapse, Nietzsche characterizes his own anti-Christian\nsentiments, and contemplates how even the greatest people usually\nundergo significant corruption. In Wagner’s case, Nietzsche claims that\nthe corrupting force was Christianity. One cannot help remembering here\nhow, using the same kind of rationale, Wagner claimed that Felix\nMendelssohn’s corrupting force was Judaism. At the same time, Nietzsche\ndescribes how he truly admired some of Wagner’s music for its profound\nexpressions of loneliness and suffering—expressions which\nNietzsche admitted were psychologically impossible for he himself to\narticulate. \n\nThe writings of Nietzsche’s final active year are peppered with some\nwild phrasings, but they remain lucid and philosophically penetrating\non the whole. Given the utter loss of Nietzsche’s intellectual\ncapacities upon his collapse, this prior lucidity is puzzling. The\nabruptness of his breakdown in combination with the lucidity of his\nfinal writings has fed speculation that rather than suffering from a\nslowly progressive mental disease, Nietzsche had a physical condition\n(e.g., a brain tumor) whose silent growth eventually reached a critical\nmass that caused his mental composure to snap. \n\nNietzsche’s unpublished writings often reveal his more tentative and\nspeculative ideas. This material is surrounded by controversy, since\nsome of it conflicts with views he expresses in his published works.\nDisagreement regarding Nietzsche’s notebooks, also known as his\nNachlass, centers around the degree of interpretive priority\nwhich ought to be given to the unpublished versus the published\nwritings. One popular approach in the tradition of classical\nscholarly interpretation is to maintain that Nietzsche’s published\nworks express his more considered and polished views, and that these\nshould take precedence over the unpublished manuscripts when conflicts\narise; a second attitude, given voice by Martin Heidegger (who lectured\non Nietzsche in Nazi Germany, 1936–1940), and broadly consistent with a\npsychoanalytic approach as well, is to regard what Nietzsche published\nas representative of what he decided was publicly presentable, and what\nhe kept privately to himself in unpublished form as containing his more\nauthentic views; a third, more comprehensive, interpretive style tries\nto grasp all of Nietzsche’s texts together in an effort to form the\nmost coherent interpretation of Nietzsche’s thought, judging the\npriority of published versus unpublished works on a thematic, or\ncase-by-case basis; a fourth position influenced by the French\ndeconstructionist perspective maintains that any rigid prioritizing\nbetween published and private works is impossible, since all of the\ntexts embody a comparable multidimensionality of meaning. \n\nIn his unpublished manuscripts, Nietzsche sometimes elaborates the\ntopics found in the published works, such as his early 1870s\nnotebooks, where there is important material concerning his theory of\nknowledge. In the 1880s notebooks—those from which his sister\ncollected together a large selection after his death under the\ntitle, The Will to Power: Attempt at a Revaluation of all\nValues—Nietzsche sometimes adopts a more metaphysical\norientation towards the doctrines of Eternal Recurrence and the Will\nto Power, speculating upon their structure, implications, and\nintellectual strength as interpretations of reality\nitself. Side-by-side with these speculations, and complicating efforts\ntowards developing an interpretation which is both comprehensive and\ncoherent, Nietzsche’s 1880s notebooks also repeatedly state that\n“there are no facts, only interpretations.” \n\nNietzsche’s thought extended a deep influence during the 20th\ncentury, especially in Continental Europe. In English-speaking\ncountries, his positive reception has been less resonant. During the\nlast decade of Nietzsche’s life and the first decade of the 20th\ncentury, his thought was particularly attractive to avant-garde artists\nwho saw themselves on the periphery of established social fashion and\npractice. Here, Nietzsche’s advocacy of new, healthy beginnings, and of\ncreative artistry in general stood forth. His tendency to seek\nexplanations for commonly-accepted values and outlooks in the\nless-elevated realms of sheer animal instinct was also crucial to\nSigmund Freud’s development of psychoanalysis. Later, during the\n1930s, aspects of Nietzsche’s thought were espoused by the Nazis and\nItalian Fascists, partly due to the encouragement of Elisabeth\nFörster-Nietzsche through her associations with Adolf Hitler and\nBenito Mussolini. It was possible for the Nazi interpreters to\nassemble, quite selectively, various passages from Nietzsche’s writings\nwhose juxtaposition appeared to justify war, aggression and domination\nfor the sake of nationalistic and racial self-glorification. \n\nUntil the 1960s in France, Nietzsche appealed mainly to writers and\nartists, since the academic philosophical climate was dominated by\nG.W.F. Hegel’s, Edmund Husserl’s and Martin Heidegger’s thought, along\nwith the structuralist movement of the 1950s. Nietzsche became\nespecially influential in French philosophical circles during the\n1960s–1980s, when his “God is dead” declaration, his\nperspectivism, and his emphasis upon power as the real motivator and\nexplanation for people’s actions revealed new ways to challenge\nestablished authority and launch effective social critique. In the\nEnglish-speaking world, Nietzsche’s unfortunate association with the\nNazis kept him from serious philosophical consideration until the\n1950s and 60s, when landmark works such as Walter Kaufmann’s,\nNietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist (1950) and\nArthur C. Danto’s, Nietzsche as Philosopher (1965), paved the\nway for a more open-minded discussion. \n\nSpecific 20th century figures who were influenced, either quite\nsubstantially, or in a significant part, by Nietzsche include painters,\ndancers, musicians, playwrights, poets, novelists, psychologists,\nsociologists, literary theorists, historians, and philosophers: Alfred\nAdler, Georges Bataille, Martin Buber, Albert Camus, E.M. Cioran,\nJacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, Isadora Duncan, Michel Foucault,\nSigmund Freud, Stefan George, André Gide, Hermann Hesse, Carl\nJung, Martin Heidegger, Gustav Mahler, André Malraux, Thomas\nMann, H.L. Mencken, Rainer Maria Rilke, Jean-Paul Sartre, Max Scheler,\nGiovanni Segantini, George Bernard Shaw, Lev Shestov, Georg Simmel,\nOswald Spengler, Richard Strauss, Paul Tillich, Ferdinand Tönnies,\nMary Wigman, William Butler Yeats and Stefan Zweig. \n\nThat Nietzsche was able to write so prolifically and profoundly for\nyears, while remaining in a condition of ill-health and often intense\nphysical pain, is a testament to his spectacular mental capacities and\nwillpower. Lesser people under the same physical pressures might not\nhave had the inclination to pick up a pen, let alone think and record\nthoughts which—created in the midst of striving for healthy\nself-overcoming—would have the power to influence an entire\ncentury.","contact.mail":"r.wicks@auckland.ac.nz","contact.domain":"auckland.ac.nz"}]
