Political philosophy as a\ngenre was invented in this period by Plato and, in effect, reinvented\nby Aristotle: it encompasses reflections on the origin of political\ninstitutions, the concepts used to interpret and organize political\nlife such as justice and equality, the relation between the aims of\nethics and the nature of politics, and the relative merits of\ndifferent constitutional arrangements or regimes. Platonic models\nremained especially important for later authors throughout this\nperiod, even as the development of later “Hellenistic”\nschools of Greek philosophy, and distinctively Roman forms of\nphilosophical adaptation, offered new frameworks for construing\npolitics from a philosophical point of view. Engagement in these Greek\nand Roman traditions of political philosophy among late antique\nscholars continued through and beyond the eventual abdication of the\nlast pretenders to the Roman imperial throne in the Western part of\nthe empire in 476 CE, and further still among medieval scholars and\ntheir successors writing in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and (later on)\nArabic.\n\nWe find the etymological origins of two key terms in the title of this\narticle, “political” and “philosophy”, in\nancient Greek: the former originally pertaining to the polis\nor city-state; the latter being the practice of a particular kind of\ninquiry conceived literally as the “love of wisdom”\n(philosophia). These ideas were transmitted beyond the\nconfines of the classical polis as the Greek city-states came\nunder the suzerainty of larger kingdoms after an initial Macedonian\nconquest at the end of the fourth century B.C; those kingdoms in turn\nwere eventually conquered and significantly assimilated by the Roman\nrepublic, later transmuted into an empire. Philosophers writing in\nLatin engaged self-consciously with the earlier and continuing\ntraditions of writing about philosophy in Greek. Already from its\norigins, Greek political philosophy put the question of the forms of\nregimes or “constitutions” (politeia, singular)\nat the center of its concerns. The classification of types of\nconstitutions already found in Herodotus, fleshed out by Plato, and\nfurther adapted by Aristotle— in Aristotle’s version, there were\nthree “good” good regimes:monarchy, aristocracy, and a\nmoderate form of democracy; and their three “perversions”:\ntyranny, oligarchy, and a bad form of democracy—would continue\nto inform the discussion of politics into the context of the\n“mixed regime” of the Roman republic, held to combine\nelements of all three of the good regimes. These discussions were\nindexed to the particular historical setting under consideration while\nalso offering general principles that remain relevant in many ways,\neven as the questions and contexts for political philosophy have\nchanged. \nBecause the field of political philosophy so delineated has had a long\nhistory since then, long past the time when the ancient models were\naccepted as defining the field and determining the\n“problems” to be considered, it is a mistake to approach\ntheir thought with a modern menu of expectations of what the subject\nwill contain. At the same time, because the Greeks also developed\nother genres widely recognized today—among them, history,\ntragedy, comedy, and rhetoric—no understanding of their thought\nabout politics can restrict itself to the genre of political\nphilosophy alone. Some argue, for example, that Thucydides’\nelaboration of the nature of the political through his\nHistory of the fifth-century Peloponnesian War between\nleagues led by Athens and Sparta is more important and instructive\nthan that issuing from Plato’s philosophical dialogues (Geuss 2005).\nWhile that argument is contentious, it rests on an important broader\npoint. “Politics” and what is “political”\nemerged as part of a widespread set of sociolinguistic practices, most\nnotably and best documented in Athens, while “philosophy”\nwas invented by a relatively small number of self-professed\n“philosophical” thinkers. Thus the invention of\n“political philosophy” as a genre can be understood as a\ndeliberate challenge to existing practices, and conceptions, of\n“the political.” The challenge was directed in particular,\nthough not exclusively, to democratic practices in mid to late fifth\ncentury Athens, which was the polis both intellectually\ndominant and in many ways politically exemplary at the time, as well\nas bequeathing the lion’s share of our surviving evidence from ancient\nGreece (Meier 1990, Ober 2008; on the surviving evidence for ancient\nGreek philosophy in general, see the entry on\n doxography for ancient philosophy). \nThis article therefore begins by surveying political practices and the\nreflective accounts to which they gave rise in the classical Greek\nperiod of the independent polis. It then turns to the\nthinkers who invented “political philosophy” par\nexcellence: Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. It continues to Hellenistic\nGreek thinkers before considering the main currents and roles of\npolitical philosophy in the Roman republic. While offering a survey of\ncertain developments in the Roman empire, it leaves aside the\ndistinctive contributions made by Jewish and Christian thinkers in\nthat period, and in particular the great upheaval of thought effected\nby Augustine, who was deeply engaged with classical authors such as\nPlato and Cicero, but who is one starting point for\n medieval political philosophy.\n The article concludes with some reflections on how the nature of\n“ancient political philosophy” should, and should not, be\nunderstood. \nThe distinctive understanding of “politics” forged in\nGreece was marked by the historical emergence of the independent\n city-state[1]\n and the variety of regimes which it could harbor. Notwithstanding\nfantasies of a pre-political “Age of Kronos”, the\npolis was widely understood as the acme of human civilization\nand the principal domain in which human fulfillment could be sought.\nThe city was the domain of potential collaboration in leading the good\nlife, though it was by the same token the domain of potential\ncontestation should that pursuit come to be understood as pitting some\nagainst others. Political theorizing began in arguments about what\npolitics was good for, who could participate in politics, and why,\narguments which were tools in civic battles for ideological and\nmaterial control as well as attempts to provide logical or\narchitectonic frameworks for those battles. \nSuch conflicts were addressed by the idea of justice, which was\nfundamental to the city as it emerged from the archaic age into the\nclassical period. Justice was conceived by poets, lawgivers, and\nphilosophers alike as the structure of civic bonds which were\nbeneficial to all (rich and poor, powerful and weak alike) rather than\nan exploitation of some by others. Hesiod’s late eighth-century epic\npoem Works and Days, for example, contrasts the brute\nstrength with which a hawk can dominate a nightingale (“You are\nbeing held by one who is much stronger… I will make a meal of\nyou, if I want, or let you go,” lines 206–208), with the\npeace and plenty which flourishes wherever justice, such as rendering\nfair verdicts to foreigners, is preserved (lines 225–230). \nSo understood, justice defined the basis of equal citizenship and was\nsaid to be the requirement for human regimes to be acceptable to the\ngods. The ideal was that, with justice as a foundation, political life\nwould enable its participants to flourish and to achieve the\noverarching human end of happiness (eudaimonia), expressing a\ncivic form of virtue and pursuing happiness and success through the\ncompetitive forums of the city. Whether justice applied to the city’s\nrelation with other cities was a further and highly contested point,\nmemorably explored in Thucydides’ recounting of the “Melian\nDialogue” in 416 BCE, in which emissaries of the Athenians\ndebated the meaning of justice with the leaders of the island-city of\nMelos, a city they were threatening with death and disaster should\nthey fail to submit to Athenian imperial demands (Thuc. V.\n84–114). \nJustice, then, depended on treating equals equally, and distributing\ncitizenship and the privileges of officeholding accordingly. Yet how\nshould “the equal” be understood? This became the major\npolitical faultline of the Greek fifth century BCE. Oligarchical\nregimes might consider only the\n kalokagathoi[2]\n —the elite and well-born, usually also wealthy landowners\n—to be full equals; democratic regimes, by contrast, tended to\ntreat the “many” (or some large proportion of them) as\npolitical equals of the elite “few,” in the fullest\ndemocracies enfranchising all free- and native-born\n men.[3]\n Sparta, a unique political entity, still exemplified the same broad\npattern in naming its citizens “the equals” or (more\nliterally) “the peers” (hoi\n homoioi).[4]\n The absence of slave status made one free but not necessarily a\ncitizen. Slavery for its part was very little debated as a political\nquestion, serving to demarcate the domain of “politics” by\ncontrast with it rather than being considered as a topic within it\n(see Garnsey 1996 for a full account including exceptions to that\ngeneralization). The exclusion of women from active citizenship in\nAthens was more consciously felt, giving rise to fantasies of\nfemale-dominated politics in Aristophanic comedy (Lysistrata,\nAssemblywomen) and to tortured reflection in many tragedies\n(consider the titles of Medea and Trojan Women, both\nAthenian works setting their explorations of women’s roles in the\ndramatic contexts of archaic foreign polities). \nAmong equals, however defined, the space of the political was the\nspace of participation in decision-making concerning public affairs\nand actions. That invention of the political (what Meier 1990 calls\nThe Greek Discovery of Politics) was the hallmark of the\nclassical Greek world. Citizens, whether the few (usually the rich) or\nthe many (including the poorer and perhaps the poorest free adult\nmen), gathered together to conduct public affairs, sharing either by\ncustom, by election, or by lot—the latter seen in Athens as the\nmost democratic, though it was never the sole mechanism used in any\nGreek democracy—in holding, or holding accountable, the offices\nfor carrying them out. Rhetoric played an important role in shaping\nthose decisions, especially, though not only, in democracies, where\ndiscursive norms shaped by the poor majority were hegemonic in public\neven over the rich (Ober 1989). \nAt the same time, politics was shaped by the legacy of archaic poetry\nand its heroic ethos and by the religious cults which included,\nalongside pan-Hellenic and familial rites, important practices\ndistinct to each city-state. This was a polytheistic, rather than\nmonotheistic, setting, in which religion was at least in large part a\nfunction of civic identity. It was a world innocent of modern\nbureaucracy and of the modern move to intellectual abstraction in\ndefining the state: the entity we would call “Athens” in\nthe abstract was called in its own day by the collective noun for its\nliving and breathing citizens, “the Athenians.” So if\nancient political philosophy left out much that modern political\nphilosophy would include (e.g., for the most part, the question of the\njustness of slavery), it also included much that the latter would tend\nto exclude. Not only the civic religious cult, but also the patterns\nof child-rearing, cultural stories expressed in music, epic, and\ndrama, gender roles and sexual practices, military participation, and\nso on, were features of the “way of life” which\nconstituted the politeia or “constitution” in its\nbroadest sense (Lane 2014a, 59–62). This broadest sense was\ninitially most evident to the Athenians when they looked at the\npeculiar customs of Sparta, but Plato taught them to recognize that\ndemocratic Athens was as distinctive a regime (Schofield 2006:\n31–43), one embodying a particular set of ethical goals and\npractices in its political arrangements. \nMost of those generally recognized as “wise men” (sophoi) and\n“students of nature” (physikoi) who appeared in this milieu,\nthought within the same broad terms as the poets and orators. Justice\nwas widely, if not universally, treated as a fundamental constituent\nof cosmic order. Some of the physikoi influenced political\nlife, notably a number of the Pythagoreans in southern Italy. Others\nheld themselves aloof from political action while still identifying\ncommonalities or consonances between nature and politics, for example,\nDemocritus of Abdera, whose atomist philosophy comported with a\ndefense of political life, and so of the justice that it required\nindividuals to enact, as being necessary for individual flourishing\n(see e.g. Democritus’ fragment DK B252 = Taylor D116). However, these\nportraits of broad consonance between nature and politics were\nchallenged in the mid to late fifth century BCE by some among a new\nbreed of thinker and actor, the professional teachers\n(“sophists”), who began to ask whether the laws and\ncustoms (nomos, singular; nomoi, plural) embodying\npolitical justice were truly a reflection of justice in nature\n(phusis), or merely an imposition of arbitrary human norms.\nMost of the sophists argued the latter, though they did so along a\nspectrum of interpretation (for which our evidence rests heavily on\nPlato, who portrays Socrates arguing with a considerable number of\nsophists): for Protagoras (an itinerant teacher from Abdera who is\ndepicted in Plato’s Protagoras and Theaetetus), the\nhuman creation of political life was a cause of celebrating human\nvirtues and practical abilities; for Thrasymachus (an ambassador to\nAthens from Chalcedon, a city in Asia Minor near modern Istanbul, who is\ndepicted in Plato’s Republic), it was a cause of\ncondemnation, the powerful in any city imposing laws to serve their\nown advantage. This nomos-phusis debate raised a\nfundamental challenge to the governing intellectual assumptions of the\npolis, even though the sophists advertised themselves as\nteaching skills for success within it, a number of them being employed\nas diplomats by cities eager to exploit their rhetorical abilities.\nSocrates and Plato would respond to this challenge in shaping a new\ngenre of “philosophy” which broke the mould of their\npredecessors (on the genre of philosophy, see Nightingale 1993a).\nWhile it is broadly true to say that Greek political thinkers\ngenerally presupposed the importance of justice, in the fifth and\nfourth centuries BCE many of them also increasingly problematized\nit. \nIn giving birth to philosophy, the polis also gave birth to a\ntension between what Aristotle would describe as two lives: the life\nof politics and the life of philosophy. A faultline between ethics and\npolitics, so closely connected in an ancient culture preoccupied with\nflourishing (eudaimonia) and virtue (aretê),\nopened here. Should philosophers act politically (and if so,\nshould they engage in ordinary politics in existing regimes, or work\nto establish new ones), or should they abstain from politics in order\nto live a life of pure contemplation? There was likewise a question as\nto whether philosophers should think politically: were human\naffairs worth thinking about in the broadest perspective opened by the\nstudy of nature and of the gods? In engaging with questions of\nrhetoric, virtue, knowledge, and justice, Socrates’ philosophical life\nwas engaged with the political even before his death (his trial and\nexecution at the hands of the Athenian democratic regime) embattled\nhim with it. But for his student Plato and Plato’s student Aristotle,\nthe practice and even the study of human affairs such as politics were\nless divine, and so less admirable, than the broader study of truth\nabout the natural and the divine realms. Philosophy might have to\naddress the political but its highest calling soared above it. If\nSocrates’ political fate was part of the stimulus for Plato to invent\na new metaphysics and epistemology in order to articulate an\nalternative realm of political possibility, Plato’s dialogues show\nSocrates simultaneously asserting an independence for those\ndisciplines from the bonds of the political\n alone.[5] \nThis distinctive Greek—and particularly Platonic – outlook\nmust condition any historical understanding of the development of\nancient political philosophy. While one influential approach to the\nhistory of political thought takes its bearings from what a thinker\nwas trying to do in and by what he or she said or wrote, it is\nimportant to recognize that the founders of ancient political\nphilosophy were in part trying to define a new space of doing as\nphilosophizing, independent of ordinary political action. This is not\nto say that they did not also have ordinary political intentions, but\nrather to stress that the invention of political philosophy was also\nintended as a mode of reflection upon the value of ordinary political\nlife. \nAccording to Cicero, Socrates (469–399 BCE) was the first to\nbring philosophy down from heaven, locating it in cities and even in\npeople’s kitchens (Tusc.V.10). A humbly born man who\nrefused the lucrative mantle of the sophistic professional teacher,\nyet attracted many of the most ambitious and aristocratic youth of\nAthens to accompany him in his questioning of them and their elders as\nto the nature of the virtues they claimed to possess or understand, he\nleft no philosophical writings. We know him only through the surviving\ntestimony of others, first the lampoons in Aristophanes’ comic plays,\nand above all the “Socratic” dialogues written by his student Plato\nand his associate Xenophon (dialogues by others are known only by\ntitles or fragments), and the remarks of Plato’s student Aristotle, as\nwell as other sources from after or even long after his death (for a\ncollection, see Giannantoni 1990, and see the entry on\n Socrates). \nSocrates seems to have been the first philosopher to treat ethics\n– as opposed to cosmology and physics—as a distinct area\nof inquiry. Asserting in Plato’s Apology (38a) that\n“the unexamined life is not worth living,” he pressed for\ndefinitions of the virtues or excellences which were widely recognized\nand claimed by his fellows, but which they found difficult to explain.\nAs depicted by Plato, the search for such definitions led invariably\nto a concern with knowledge of how best to live, as not only one of\nthe conventional virtues (in the form of wisdom) but also as\nunderpinning, even constituting, them all. That elevation of knowledge\nin turn led Socrates to militate against the practices of rhetoric and\njudgment which animated the political institutions of Athens—the\nlaw-courts, Assembly and Council. Instead he posited the existence, or\nat least the possibility, of political expertise, claiming (in Plato’s\nGorgias) to be the one person in Athens who at least tried to\npursue such a true politikê technê, a complex\nnotion that can be understood as meaning politics as a kind of\nprofessional expertise (Grg. 521d). The notion of political\nknowledge limited to one or a few experts, as opposed to the embedded\nand networked knowledge produced and exercised by the whole\ndêmos of Athens in their judgments and political roles\n(Ober 2008), struck at the central premises of Athenian democracy and\nthose of Greek politics more generally (in oligarchies, wealth rather\nthan knowledge was the relevant criterion for rule; in tyrannies,\nsheer power). Thus the nature of Socrates’ concern with ethics led him\ndirectly into a form of political philosophizing. The relation between\npolitics and knowledge, the meaning of justice as a virtue, the value\nof the military courage which all Greek cities prized in their\ncitizens, all seem to have been central topics of Socratic\nconversation. \nThat engagement with political philosophy was dramatically intensified\nwhen Socrates was, at the age of seventy, arraigned, tried, and\nsentenced to death by an Athenian popular jury. In a prosecution\nbrought by a group of his fellow citizens who claimed to be\nshouldering that burden for the sake of the city (the usual way in\nwhich prosecutions were brought in Athens), the charges laid were\nagainst him were three-fold: not acknowledging the city’s gods;\nintroducing new gods; and corrupting the young (Apol. 24b).\nEach of these had a political dimension, given the civic control of\ncentral religious cults mentioned earlier, and the broad political\nimportance of educating the young to take their place in the civic\norder. Timed a few years after the overthrow of a short-lived\noligarchic regime (known as that of “The Thirty”) which\nhad been led by several of Socrates’ sometime associates (Critias,\nCharmides), itself following the ignominious Athenian defeat in the\nwar with Sparta which had earlier seen another associate of Socrates\n(Alcibiades) turn traitor to Athens, the trial must be suspected of\nhaving served as a substitute for the prohibited political trials of\nthe oligarchic partisans (such trials having been generally barred by\nan amnesty passed in 403 BCE by the restored democracy; see Cartledge\n2009, Ch.7, Carawan 2013, Shear 2011). \nSocrates’ speeches in the court trial—literary versions of which\nwere produced by Plato, Xenophon, and a number of other\nfollowers—forced him to confront directly the question of his\nrole in an Athens defined by its democratic institutions and norms.\nSocrates had played his part as an ordinary citizen, allowing his name\nto go forward for selection by lot to serve on the Council, and\nserving in the army when required. But he had not engaged actively in\n“public affairs” (ta pragmata, Apol.\n32e): he had not spoken in the Assembly (31c), nor, so far as we know,\nbrought any prosecutions in the law-courts. In Plato’s account, after\ncountering the religious accusations, Socrates acknowledged this\nabstention from public affairs but claimed to have had a more\nsignificant mission laid on him by the god Apollo when his oracle at\nDelphi declared that no man was wiser than Socrates: his mission was\nto stir up the city like a gadfly (30e), discussing virtue and related\nmatters (38a), and benefiting each person by “trying to persuade\nhim” to care for virtue rather than wealth for himself and for\nthe city (36c–d). He went so far as to claim that as a civic\nbenefactor, he deserved not death but the lifelong publicly provided\nmeals commonly awarded to an Olympic champion (36e–37a). Socrates here\ndepicts himself as a new kind of citizen, conceptualizing the public\ngood in a new way and so serving it best through unprecedented\nactions, in contrast to the conventionally defined paths of political\ncontest and success (Villa 2001). \nWhile depicting himself in his defense speeches in Plato’s\nApology as a new kind of virtuous citizen, Socrates makes\nthree remarks which have in modern times been seized upon as\nindications of the principled limits which he might have put on the\nrequirement to obey the law. The first two recalled political\nincidents: while serving on the Council, he had voted against an\nillegal proposal (32b–c); and under the brief oligarchical domination\nof “The Thirty”, he had disobeyed an order of the ruling\nbody to arrest a democratic partisan for execution (32c–d). The third\nis a hypothetical remark. If, he imagines, the jurors were to say to\nhim, “we acquit you, but only on condition that you spend no\nmore time on this investigation and do not practice philosophy, and if\nyou are caught doing so you will die,” his reply would be:\n“I will obey the god rather than you, and as long as I draw\nbreath and am able, I shall not cease to practice philosophy”\n(both quotations excerpted from longer sentences, 29c–d). Particularly\nin twentieth-century Anglophone scholarship, these remarks have\nengendered a view of Socrates as endorsing civil disobedience in\ncertain circumstances, and so have framed the question of civil\ndisobedience and the grounds for political obligation as arising in\nPlato. A significant debate on these matters took shape in the United\nStates in the 1960s and 1970s at the time of widespread civil\ndisobedience relating to civil rights and the Vietnam War: see for\nexample Konvitz 1964, Woozley 1972. \nThat debate has had to confront the fact that Socrates did not\nactually disobey his own death sentence with which his trial\nconcluded: when the time came, he drank the poisonous hemlock as\nprescribed by the jury. Before that moment, Plato imagines Socrates\nbeing visited in prison by his friend Crito (in a dialogue which bears\nthe latter’s name), and urged to escape for the sake of his friends\nand family, a practice which was frequently tolerated in Athens so\nlong as the escapee fled into exile. Socrates is not persuaded by\nCrito’s arguments. He begins his examination of them by recalling\nprinciples to which he and Crito had in the past agreed, including the\nprinciple that it is better to suffer injustice than to commit it\n(Cri. 47a–50a). He then goes on to ventriloquize a series of\nspeeches against escape, which he ascribes to the “Laws of\n Athens”.[6]\n These speeches articulate a set of special connections between\nSocrates and the Laws of Athens which, depending on one’s reading,\neither flesh out the principle that it is better to suffer injustice\nthan to do it (by dramatizing reasons for which it would unjust for\nSocrates to escape), or else stand in tension with it by invoking\nabsolutist grounds with implications more extensive than such a\nprinciple would authorize (Harte 1999). On any reading, it is\nimportant to bear in mind that Socrates is choosing to obey a jury\nverdict that has commanded him to suffer what is arguably an\ninjustice, but not to commit one, so that one of his fundamental\nethical principles here as elsewhere in Plato (that it is better to\nsuffer an injustice than to commit one) is at least compatible with\nhis acceptance of the jury’s sentence. \nThe “Laws of Athens” appeal to a kind of social contract\nmade between themselves and Socrates. The contract is unequal: the\n“Laws” compare themselves to parents and slaveowners, and\nSocrates to child and slave. Obedience to them is owed, they claim,\nbecause the “Laws” have provided the whole basis for\nSocrates’ education and life in the city, a city in which he has\nnotably chosen to remain, never traveling abroad except on military\nservice. But the “Laws” also speak of the opportunity they\nafford to Socrates to “persuade or obey” them (51b;\n51e–52a). The meaning of this clause and its relevance to civil\ndisobedience is again much debated (Kraut 1984 remains a landmark).\nNevertheless, the image of Socrates tried, convicted, and made to die\n(by his own hand) at the city’s command has come to be a vivid and\npowerful symbol of tension in the relationship between political\nphilosophy and political authority. \nThe Crito depends upon a notion of justice and injustice\nwhich it never defines. In the Republic, by contrast, a\ndialogue in which Socrates is also the main character (and\nfirst-person narrator) but in which the views he advances go beyond\nthe tight-knit pattern of debates in the dialogues discussed in\nsection 3.1, Plato (424/3–348/7\n BCE)[7]\n offers an account of justice linking the political to the\npsychological and justice to a higher understanding of true goodness.\n(See the entry on\n Plato.)\n The Republic is, with the Laws, an order of\nmagnitude longer than any other Platonic dialogue. Readers today are\nlikely to think of the Republic as the home par excellence of\npolitical philosophy. But that view has also been challenged by\nscholars who see it as primarily an ethical dialogue, driven by the\nquestion of why the individual should be just (Annas 1999). This\nsection argues that the ethical and political concerns, and purposes,\nof the dialogue are inextricably intertwined. \nNear the beginning of the dialogue, a challenge is launched by the\ncharacter Thrasymachus, mentioned above, asserting that all actual\ncities define justice so as to serve the advantage of the rulers. He\ntakes this to mean that the laws which their subjects are bound to\nobey and the associated ethical virtue of justice which they are\nenjoined to cultivate (traditionally seen as the necessary bond among\ncitizens and the justification for political rule), in fact amount to\na distorted sham. (See the entry on\n Callicles and Thrasymachus.)\n The question which Thrasymachus poses and which Plato’s brothers\nGlaucon and Adeimantus reformulate—why should the individual be\njust if he or she can get away with not being just, when elevated\nabove the demands of ordinary justice either by special power or good\nfortune?—thus already has a political valence from the\noutset. \nSocrates then launches a speculation as to the origins of cities: the\ncity is held to have an existence independently of ethical concerns,\ncoming into being for economic reasons and immediately needing to\ndefend itself in war (and also to be able to make offensive war for\neconomic gain). However, this origin already gives rise to a\nproto-ethical dimension, first insofar as the members of the primitive\ncity each do their own work (the structure of what will emerge as the\nvirtue of justice), which is fleshed out when political rulers are\nestablished who are able to use their wisdom to help their subjects\nmaintain a psychological balance in their souls that approximates, if\nit does not fully embody, the virtues of moderation and justice and so\nenables them to enjoy a unified rather than a divided soul. The\nquestion of why the individual should be just, figured at the outset\nby the contrast with the putatively happy tyrant, is resolved\neventually by demonstrating that the tyrant will necessarily, in\nvirtue of the disorder of his soul, be at once maximally unjust and\nmaximally unhappy. \nThat resolution rests on the division of the soul into three parts by\nwhich the Republic places moral psychology at the heart of\npolitical philosophy. Both soul and city are posited by Socrates in\narguments in Books II–IV and VIII–IX, in particular, to have a\ntripartite structure when the soul is embodied in a living person. In\nthe soul and city respectively, the rational part or class should\nrule; the spirited part or class should act to support the rule of\nthat rational part; and the appetitive part of the soul and producing\nclass in the city should accept being governed by it. Both soul and\ncity are therefore in need of, and capable of exhibiting, four virtues\n(427e–444a). Two of these pertain to individual parts: the rational\npart being capable of wisdom, the spirited part of courage. Two\nhowever are defined by relations between the parts: moderation as the\nagreement of all three parts that reason should rule, justice as each\npart doing its own (this echoes, in a radically new context, a\nconservative Athenian suspicion of excessive democratic\npolupragmosunê or busybody interference). \nThe result is that justice is defined as primarily a condition of\none’s soul or city as a whole, not as any specific just action; yet if\nthe soul or city is so ordered, the individual will have no cause to\nengage in the paradigmatically unjust action of pleonexia or\ngrasping for more than one’s fair share. A just soul will indeed\nreliably issue in traditionally just actions, such as refraining from\ntheft, murder, and sacrilege (contra Sachs 1963, who argues that Plato\nhas simply abandoned the usual domain of justice). But what makes its\n‘justice’ count as such goes beyond these particular actions and\nomissions, lying in the health and orderliness of such a soul\ncontrasted with the chaotic or even tyrannical character of an unjust\nsoul (Burnyeat 2013). To be a truly effective, because wholly unified,\nagent, one must be just, moderate, courageous and wise. The just\nperson enjoys psychic health, which is advantageous no matter how he\nis treated (fairly or unfairly) by gods and men; correspondingly, the\njust society enjoys civic unity, which is advantageous in being the\nfundamental way to avoid the assumed supreme evil of civil war. In\ncontrast, all other cities are characterized as riven by civil war\nbetween the rich and the poor; none of them counts as a single,\nunified city at all (see Rep. 422e–423a, and more generally, Book VIII\nof that dialogue). \nBy treating these ethical and political questions as interrelated, and\nthen going on to depict both an ideal political regime\n(“Kallipolis”, the fine or beautiful city) in which they\ncould be solved, and the imperfect regimes into which such an ideal\nregime will decay, the Republic lays out a novel and\nambitious template for political philosophy: not only to interrogate\nthe meaning of virtue and citizenship, but also to develop an ideal\nregime and an account of how and why such regimes may fail. That\ntemplate will be followed by Aristotle’s Politics, by\nCicero’s De re publica, and by Thomas More’s Utopia,\namong other successors. In Plato’s hands, however, this template\nincluded some specific political prescriptions to maintain the unity\nof the ideal city which most of his successors abhorred. In\nparticular, Book V of the Republic suggests that a\nsufficiently unified regime can be achieved only by depriving its\nguardian-rulers of private property and of private families, instead\nmaking them live in austere communal conditions in which they are\nfinancially supported by their money-making subjects and allowed to\nprocreate only when and with whom will best serve the city. In Book II\nof his Politics, Aristotle would read this prescription as\napplying to all the citizens in the city envisaged in the Republic, and\nboth he and, later on, Cicero would deplore what they construed as\nthis abolition of private property. Even those following and\nradicalizing Plato precisely by advocating the abolition of property\nfor all the citizens, rather than only deprivation of it for the\nrulers, as would the sixteenth-century Sir Thomas More, were generally\nopposed to if not also scandalized by the suggestion of procreative\ncommunism. \nThe Republic initiates a further tradition in political\nphilosophy by laying out a template for the integration of ethics and\npolitical philosophy into a comprehensive account of epistemology and\nmetaphysics. By making the claim of the philosophers to rule depend on\ntheir knowledge of the good and of the other Platonic Forms (in\nconjunction with their moral character and tested practical\nexperience), the dialogue vindicates the Socratic and Platonic thought\nthat ruling well—what we might call “rule” proper\n– requires a rare form of expertise rather than lay judgment,\nrhetorical advice, or common knowledge. In the Republic, the\nknowledge required for rule is not specialized, but comprehensive: the\nknowledge of the good and the Forms is somehow to translate into an\nability to make laws as well as the everyday decisions of rule. The\nrulers are philosophers who take turns over their lifetime in\nexercising collective political authority. They define their vocation\nas that of philosophizing, engaging in rule out of some sort of\ncompulsion or necessity (see the entry on\n Plato’s ethics and politics in the Republic).\n To that extent the Republic presents a paradox: if it is\nwidely considered the first major work of political\n philosophy,[8]\n it is nevertheless a work in which there is no special content to\npolitical knowledge nor any special vocation for politics. \nIn the Statesman, Plato turns his attention to precisely the\ntopics identified at the end of the last section above. In a\ndiscussion led by an unnamed person, a philosopher visiting Athens\nfrom Elea, political expertise (harking back to the politikê\ntechnê met above with Socrates, sect. 3.1) is identified by\nseparating it progressively by a set of distinctions from other forms\nof expertise. The discussion is interrupted but ultimately enriched by\na story or myth in which politics is shown to be a matter of humans\nruling other humans in place of living under divine guidance. That\nhuman expertise of statecraft is ultimately distinguished by its\nknowledge of the correct timing (kairos) as to when its\nclosest rivals should be exercised: these are three forms of expertise\nthat in fact corresponded to key political roles, some of them formal\noffices, in Greek cities at the time, namely, rhetoric, generalship,\nand judging (Lane 1998, Lane 2013c). The statesman is wholly defined\nby the possession of that knowledge of when it is best to exercise\nthese and the other subordinate forms of expertise, and by the role of\nexercising that knowledge in binding or weaving the different groups\nof citizens together, a knowledge which depends on a broader\nphilosophical grasp but which is peculiarly political (El Murr 2014).\nHere, political philosophy operates not just to assimilate politics to\na broader metaphysical horizon but also to identify its\nspecificity. \nThe Statesman also raises an important question about the\nnature and value of rule by law, as opposed to rule by such expert\nknowledge as embodied in a rare and likely singular individual. For\nits part, the Republic had taken law in its stride as the\nstandard formulation to be utilized in the construction of the city in\nspeech by the dialogue’s principal interlocutors from Book II onward,\nwho constitute themselves as Kallipolis’ ‘founders’ (Annas\n2017, Lane 2013a). By contrast, the Statesman analyzes law as\nin principle a stubborn and imperfect substitute for the flexible\ndeployment of expertise (293e–303c). However, the principal\ninterlocutors of the latter dialogue go on to agree that if the choice\nis between an ignorant imitator of the true political expert who\nchanges the laws on the basis of whim, and a law-bound polity, the\nlatter would be preferable, so bringing law back into the picture as\nan alternative to the ideal after all. \nThe Laws, a work reported to have been still on wax tablets,\nand so possibly left unfinished when Plato died (Diogenes Laertius\nIII. 37), treats the specificity of politics as a matter not of\ndistinct vocational expertise but of the requirements of a\n“second-best” (739a) city, one in which private property\nis allowed, as opposed to an ideal or implicitly first-best regime in\nwhich private property would be prohibited to all (thus going beyond\neven the ideal regime of Kallipolis in the Republic). In this\nsection, as in most scholarly discussions, I will assume that the\nsecond-best city for which laws are laid out in the later books is the\nprojected Cretan colony of Magnesia, of which the Cretan (Cleinias)\namong the dialogue’s three interlocutors has announced himself to be\none of the intended founders. (For an alternative argument, that the\nsecond-best city is not meant to be Magnesia, see Bartels 2017.) In\nthis second-best city, the legislation for which is sketched out in\nspeech by the three interlocutors of the dialogue, politics still aims\nat virtue, and at the virtue of all the citizens, but those citizens\nall play a part in holding civic offices; the ordinary activities of\npolitics are shared, in what is described as a mixture of monarchy and\ndemocracy. That description gives rise to an idea of the “mixed\nregime” or “mixed constitution” which later became\ninfluential in its own right, as we shall see below (section 6). \nAnother influential aspect of the Laws is its positive\nevaluation of the nature of law itself as a topic proper to political\nphilosophy. While the Laws shares with the Statesman\nthe notion of law in an isolated and singular sense as being brutish\nand stubborn compared to expert knowledge, it recommends a\n“double” notion of law, in which each such command is\nprefaced with a persuasive account of its rationale, addressed to the\ncitizens, who are expected to read and understand it (719b–723d, and\npassim). Some scholars have found that to be a distinctively\ndemocratic and liberal account of law (Bobonich 2002; see also the\nentry on\n Plato on utopia).\n That arguably goes too far in a proceduralist direction, given that\nthe value of law remains its embodiment of reason or understanding\n(nous), so that while adding persuasive preludes is a better\nway to exercise the coercive force of law, no agreement on the basis\nof persuasion could justify laws which departed from the standard of\nnous (Laks 2005). Nevertheless, the emphasis on law as an\nembodiment of reason, and as articulating the political ideals of the\ncity in a form that its citizens are to study and internalize\n(Nightingale 1993b, 1999), is distinctive to this dialogue. \nAlso notable is that the Laws’ emphasis on all citizens as\neligible, and so presumptively capable, to hold offices, differs\nsignificantly from the Republic, where it is not clear\nwhether there are to be in Kallipolis any formally constituted offices\nat all, and if there are, they would seem to be monopolized by the\nphilosopher-rulers and the auxiliary guardians who assist\n them.[9]\n The outlook in the Laws may have somewhat more affinity with\nthe closing passages of the Statesman, which refer to the\noffices or quasi-offices of rhetor, general and judge which at least\ncertain citizens will hold, those with the relevant expertise to play\neach role. The Statesman however reserves a special\nextraordinary role (a higher office, or perhaps not a formal office as\nsuch) for the statesman whenever he is present in the city (Lane\n2013b). The role of the Statesman’s eponymous figure must\ntherefore be distinguished from that of the “Nocturnal\nCouncil” in the Laws (which is actually to meet just\nbefore dawn), a body of citizens who are selected for wisdom and\njudiciousness and whose role is to review and revise the laws rather\nthan (as in the Statesman, at least theoretically) to\noverride them when it is better to do so. \nMuch literature on Plato’s political philosophy has debated whether\nthe turn in the Laws to the “second-best”\nreflects a new form of realism on Plato’s part about politics more\ngenerally, invoking other remarks by the Visitor from Athens, one of\nthe three interlocutors, along with Cleinias and the Spartan Megillus,\nwhich suggest that no one could ever be uniformly and reliably\nvirtuous and immune to corruption, though this is not unequivocally\nstated (e.g. 874e–875d). Has Plato in the Laws given up on\nhis earlier idealism which rested on the possibility of the\nphilosopher-king, or on the idea of the perfectly knowledgeable\nstatesman? If so, should that be interpreted as disillusionment or\npessimism on his part, or as a more democratic or liberal turn? Or are\nthere more fundamental continuities that connect and underlie even\nthese seeming shifts? These questions structure the broad debate about\nthe meaning and trajectory of Platonic political philosophy (for an\noverview, compare Klosko 2006 to Schofield 2006). \nThe two Platonic themes of superior political knowledge and, expressed\nparticularly in his Laws, political participation, also\nstructure the political thought of Aristotle (384–322 BCE), who\nstudied in Plato’s Academy as a youth and researched there for many\nyears thereafter. Living much of his life as a resident alien in\nAthens, with close familial ties to the extra-polis\nMacedonian court which would, near the end of his life, bring Athens\nunder its sway, Aristotle at once thematized the fundamental\nperspective of the Greek citizenship of equals and at the same time\nacknowledged the claim to rule of anyone of truly superior political\nknowledge. While building on Plato’s project of demarcating political\nexpertise and depicting ideal as well as imperfect cities, the\nadvances and new directions that Aristotle pioneered in political\nphilosophy reflect certain disagreements with Plato in their wider\nphilosophies, though also with some deep commonalities. \nWhereas Plato’s philosophy continually sought a single or small set of\nunifying truths behind the veil of appearance, Aristotle’s\nwide-ranging researches into what would now be considered the natural\nsciences, as well as in logic and other areas of inquiry, manifested\nrespect for the opinions of “the many and the wise” as a\nstarting-point for philosophical understanding. His approach likewise\nmanifested appreciation of the multiplicity of forms of knowledge, in\nparticular the cleavage between theoretical understanding of the world\nas it necessarily is, and practical knowledge of how to deliberate\nabout acting in relation to whatever “could be otherwise.”\nUniting his accounts of phenomena as different as plants, animals,\nethics and politics, was a teleological structure of explanation.\nBiological creatures work to fulfill the realization of their end or\ntelos, a specific way of living a complete life\ncharacteristic of the plants or animals of their own kind, which is\nthe distinctive purpose that defines their fundamental\nnature—just as human artifacts are designed and used for\nspecific ends. While every human being, in acting, posits a particular\ntelos as the purpose making that action intelligible, this\nshould ideally reflect the overall natural telos of humans as\nsuch. \nHere, however, arises a problem unique to humans. Whereas other\nanimals have a single telos defining their nature (living the\nfull life of a frog, including reproduction, being the sole\ntelos of each frog, in the example used by Lear 1998), humans\nboth have a distinctive human nature—arising from the unique\ncapacity to use language to deliberate about how to act — and\nalso share in the divine nature in their ability to use reason to\nunderstand the eternal and intelligible order of the world. Practical\nreason is the domain of ethics and politics, the uniquely human\ndomain. Yet the political life is not necessarily the best life,\ncompared with that devoted to the divinely shared human capacity for\ntheoretical reason and philosophical thinking (compare Nicomachean\nEthics I with X.7–9). \nIn considering practical reason to be the domain of both ethics and\npolitics, Aristotle follows Plato in drawing no sharp line between\nthose two domains (see on this point for ancient testimonies and\nmodern arguments respectively, Bodéüs 1993: 22–24\nand 59–63, and Vander Waerdt 1991, though for a contrary\nargument, see Duvall and Dotson 1998). In fact he closes his\nNicomachean Ethics by remarking that for most people, the\npractice of ethics can only be ensured by their being governed by law,\nwhich combines necessity (compulsion) with reason. Because, for most\npeople, the ethical life presupposes government by law, the student of\nethics must become a student of political science, studying the\nscience of legislation in light of the collection of constitutions\nassembled by Aristotle and his school in the Lyceum. All but part of\none of the over one hundred items in this collection reported in\nantiquity have been lost: a considerable part of the analysis of the\n“Constitution of Athens” was recovered from a papyrus\ndiscovered in the nineteenth century. Aristotle’s theoretical claims\nabout the nature of politics in the Politics must be\nunderstood against this backdrop. The legislator (whose standpoint is\nadopted in the Politics, see the entry on\n Aristotle’s political theory)\n needs to have a grasp of the nature of politics as such (pursued\nespecially in Books I and III); an understanding of the major\nfaultlines in the interpretation and practice of politics (pursued\nespecially in Books II and IV–VI); and a grip on the structure and\ncharacteristics of the specific city for which he aims to legislate\n(pursued also in Book II for existing constitutions and constitutional\nmodels; Books IV–VI for types of flawed constitutions; and Books\nVII–VIII for the “best constitution” (1323a14). \nAt the beginning of Book IV (1288b1–39), Aristotle offers a\nfourfold account of what the expertise regarding constitutions must\nencompass. As glossed by Eugene Garver (2011: 107), and drawing on\nstandard Aristotelian terminology distinguishing formal from material\ncauses, these include: “The first, ‘that which is best in\nthe abstract’...orients politics around the end of politics, the\nbest life. The second, the best relative to circumstances, starts with\nthe material cause and organizes political inquiry around the best\nthat can be made out of given material. The third, the best on a\nhypothesis, starts not from the true end of politics, but any posited\nend, and so looks for means and devices that will preserve any given\nconstitution. The final inquiry, the search for ‘the form of\nconstitution which is best suited to states in general,’\narticulates a formal cause that can organize almost any material, any\nkind of people.” These four elements of expertise regarding\nconstitution are not tidily segregated in different parts of the text;\nthey are pursued variously, sometimes in combination, and draw on\nwider discussions of the nature of politics and the human good that\nare threaded throughout. \nThe Politics begins by setting the stage for the first kind\nof understanding of constitutions identified above, by offering an\nanalysis of the teleological ends of life and the human capacity for\nspeech which together support its two most famous contentions: that\n“it is evident that the state is a creation of nature, and that\nman is by nature a political animal” (I.2, 1253a2–3).\nWhile for some modern readers this sentence asserts that political\nparticipation is necessary for virtuous human flourishing (as for\nIrwin 1990), others contend that “the argument that man is a\npolitical animal does not imply that man must participate in politics\nto become virtuous, only that he must literally be a part of a\npolis and live under its laws.” (Mulgan 1990:\n 205)[10]\n In either case, as Hannah Arendt (1958) emphasizes, Aristotle’s\nunderstanding of civic unity insists on respect for human plurality as\nthe condition of political action; in Book II, he criticizes Plato’s\nKallipolis for interpreting the requirement of civic unity in so\nextreme a fashion as to have obliterated the properly political domain\naltogether (Nussbaum 1980). Nevertheless, civic unity is still an aim\nof Aristotle’s ideal virtuous regime, and a limited Platonic spirit\nsurvives in the common meals that this regime would offer to all\ncitizens: VII.10. \nIn another famous contention of the work—that “a citizen\nis one who shares in governing and being governed” (III.13,\n1283b42–1284a1, also translatable as “ruling and being\nruled in turn”), the Greek dictum of citizenship among equals is\npresented as an analytical truth, leaving open how such equality is to\nbe conceived in practice. The citizen “shares in the\nadministration of justice, and in offices” (III.1,\n1275a23–24). In defective regimes, the good citizen and the good\nman may come apart. The good citizen of a defective regime is one\nwhose character suits the particular regime in question (whether\noligarchic, or democratic, say) and equips him to support it loyally;\nhence he may be deformed or stunted by a role of holding (or a role of\nholding accountable) offices defined on incorrect terms. In “the\nbest state,” however, the citizen is “one who is able and\nchooses to be governed and to govern with a view to the life of\nexcellence” (III.13, 1284a1–3). In such a state,\n“the citizens must not lead the life of artisans or tradesmen,\nfor such a life is ignoble and inimical to excellence” (VII.9,\n1328b39–41), nor that of farmers, as political participation\nrequires leisure. Here the limitations and exclusions among actual\nhumans licensed by the principled formulation of the\npossibility—requiring actual realization—of human virtue\nbecome apparent. \nAristotle recognizes that there are other possible claims, or as it\nwere titles, to political rule: “There is also a doubt as to\nwhat is to be the supreme power in the state:—Is it the\nmultitude? Or the wealthy? Or the good? Or the one best man? Or a\ntyrant?” (III.10, 1281a11–13). He develops in particular\ndetail the arguments that might be made on behalf of the many and the\nknowledgeable one respectively. The many can judge, as they did in\nAthenian dramatic audiences, juries, and the Assembly (where they\n“judged”, by voting on, the merits of something advanced\nfor their consideration, whether a play, an indictment, or a speaker’s\nproposed resolution). Aristotle uses the image of a collectively\nprovided feast to illustrate the potential superiority of such\ncollective judgement; how to interpret this image (whether as a\npotluck, Waldron 1995, Wilson 2011, Ober 2013, or in a more\naggregative way, Bouchard 2011, Cammack 2013, Lane 2013a) and other\nimages that he uses is a matter of some renewed controversy (for a\nrecent review, see Bobonich 2015). But the lesson Aristotle draws from\nthe various images is clearly limited to vindicating a role of the\nmany in electing and holding accountable incumbents of the highest\noffices rather than in holding such offices themselves (III.11,\n1281b31; Lane 2013a). The many can contribute to virtuous\ndecision-making in their collective capacity of\njudgment—presumably in assemblies and juries—but not as\nindividual high officials (Lane 2013a, 2014b, Poddighe 2014). \nIn the contrasting case of the one supremely excellent person,\nAristotle argues that such a person has, strictly speaking, no equals,\nand so cannot be made justly to take a turn in rule, holding office\nfor a time, as one citizen among others. Instead it is right that such\na person should rule without the term limits that political office\nwould ordinarily require: \nIf, however, there be some one person, or more than one, although not\nenough to make up the full complement of a state, whose excellence is\nso pre-eminent that the excellence or the political capacity of all\nthe rest admit of no comparison with his or theirs, he or they can be\nno longer regarded as part of a state; for justice will not be done to\nthe superior, if he is reckoned only as the equal of those who are so\nfar inferior to him in excellence and in political capacity. Such a\nman may truly be deemed a god among men ….men like him should\nbe kings in their state for life (III.13,\n1284a3–11…1284b32–34; cf. III.17,\n1288a24–29). \nOn one recent reading, this implies that virtuous monarchy does indeed\ncount as a political regime, albeit one in which only one or a few of\nthe citizens are eligible to hold the highest offices (Riesbeck 2014).\nYet this argument is left at the hypothetical level. In the absence of\nsuch a superlatively virtuous, even godlike individual, the\nformulation of political rule as involving some kind of turn-taking by\na large body of sufficiently virtuous citizens remains preeminent\n(though even this should not be read to imply that all should in fact\nalternate in office, or even that all should necessarily be eligible\nfor all offices). \nAs Aristotle turn to consideration of the best constitutions relative\nto particular (and imperfect) circumstances, the major issue is\nconflict between rival factions over the basis for defining equality\nand so justice. In the Nicomachean Ethics, Book V, Aristotle\nhad identified two types of equality: geometrical, or proportional to\nmerit; and arithmetical, or proportional to mere numerical counting.\nIn Politics III.9 he picks up this distinction and aligns it\nwith the conflict between oligarchical and democratic justice. As he\nlater puts it, “Democrats say that justice is that to which the\nmajority agree, oligarchs that to which the wealthier class\nagree…” (VI.3, 1318a18–20), while truly\naristocratic justice would enfranchise only those equal in virtue.\nThis attention to the actual political contentions of rival Greek\ngroups leads into a discussion of the relative goodness and badness of\nimperfect regimes, modeled in part on Plato’s Statesman.\nWhereas that Platonic text had distinguished monarchy from tyranny,\naristocracy from oligarchy, and good from bad democracy on the basis\nof obedience to law (all these regimes being conceived as lacking the\ngenuine political knowledge of the true statesman), Aristotle instead\nmakes the dividing line the question of ruling for the common\nadvantage as opposed to ruling for the advantage of a single faction.\nThe “bad” democracy, for example, rules for the faction of\nthe many as opposed to the faction of the few, whereas the\n“good” democracy—which Aristotle baptizes\n“polity”, using the general word for\n“constitution” (politeia) —rules for the\nadvantage of all citizens. Aristotle augments this analysis with\nappeals to historical narrative, overlapping with the narrative of\nAthenian political history offered in the\nConstitution of Athens compiled by him or, more likely, by\nmembers of his school. On his telling in the Politics,\nAthenian democracy had degenerated from an aboriginal democracy of\nnon-meddling farmers (VI.4), through various intermediate forms, to a\ndemocracy (seemingly that of contemporary fourth-century Athens) in\nwhich men rule, not laws. Yet this trajectory does not prevent him\nfrom asserting that in general democracy is “most\ntolerable” of the three perversions (IV.2, 1289b4–5) and\nnoting that it at least involves the characteristic political liberty\nof ruling and being ruled in turn (VI.2). \nA further major turn in the analysis comes when the question of some\nsingle “best” regime is replaced by a question about not\nwhat is “best” in the “ideal” sense, but the\ngood constitution “that is easily attainable by all”\n(IV.1, 1288a37–39) and in practice best for most cities (IV.11).\nThis Aristotle calls the middling regime: a political, because\nsociological, mean between oligarchy and democracy, in which the\nmiddle classes hold the preponderance of both wealth distribution and\npolitical power. Thus it is attainable through reform of either an\noligarchy or a democracy, the most prevalent constitutions among the\nGreeks. Strikingly, his example of such a regime is Sparta: presented\nas a case of a characteristically democratic distribution of education\n(among citizens only, of course) coupled with the characteristically\naristocratic principle of election to offices rather than selection by\nlot (IV.9) (though to be sure, democracies such as Athens made use of\nelection for certain of the highest offices as well). \n“All modern discussions of citizenship as a noninstrumental\ngood-in-itself are indebted, if only indirectly, to him [sc.\nAristotle]” (Ober 1998: 290). The Politics emphasizes\nthat “a state is not a mere society, having a common place,\nestablished for the prevention of mutual crime and for the sake of\nexchange” but is rather “a community of families and\naggregations of families [sc. united] in well-being, for the sake of a\nperfect and self-sufficing life” (III.9, 1280b30–34, with square\nbrackets added). It has been suggested in this article that the final\nclause of that sentence is important: Aristotelian citizenship counts\nas a noninstrumental good-in-itself only so long as it does indeed aim\nat the telos of a perfect life. That is, while Aristotle\nindeed valued the possibility of political participation in\nofficeholding and the control of officeholding as part of the best\nconstitution, he saw it as an intrinsic good only insofar as it was an\nexpression of virtue, as it would be in that best constitution\n(whether governed by a collectivity of virtuous citizens as in the\nregime described in Books VII and VIII, or in the rare and perhaps\npurely hypothetical case of a superlatively virtuous monarch). Without\nvirtue, political participation in officeholding and the control of\nofficeholding was rather to be valued on the basis of expedience,\nthough even then, membership in the political community of the\npolis remains essential to full human flourishing. \nNevertheless, Ober’s observation rings true more broadly for the\nhistorical significance of Aristotle’s political thought. The medieval\nrediscovery in the West of the full Greek texts of Aristotle’s\nEthics and Politics and their translation into Latin\nin the thirteenth century served as a basis for reconceiving civic\nlife as valuable on the basis of reason independent of revelation.\nThus 1260 – the date of William of Moerbeke’s complete Latin\ntranslation of the Politics—symbolizes a fundamental\nturning point in political philosophy, one in which Aristotelian\nphilosophy would be widely deployed within certain strands of thought\nof the Catholic Church, while also inspiring a wide range of\nphilosophical movements and later becoming the target of others.\nIndeed, modern debates over the meaning of Aristotle find him a\nprecursor of or inspiration for a range of intellectual and political\npositions: Aristotle as a communitarian (MacIntyre 1984) vs. Aristotle\nas an exponent of class conflict (Yack 1993); Aristotle as a democrat,\nor at least as providing the basis for democracy (Frank 2005), vs.\nAristotle in opposition to Athenian democracy in his day (Ober 1998).\nOne interesting development has been the use of Aristotle to\narticulate an ethics of capability (Nussbaum 1993). In evaluating\nAristotle’s political thought, it is important to distinguish between\nmodern democratic assumptions and his own starting points, many of\nwhich were in tension with the democracies of his own time. \nImportant developments in political thinking and practice took place\nunder the Hellenistic kingdoms that supplanted Macedon in its\nsuzerainty over the formerly independent Greek city-states. These\nincluded, for example, a genre of rhetorical letters addressed to\nrulers, and the important analysis of Greek and Roman constitutional\nchange by the second-century Greek historian Polybius (Hahm 2000). As\nkingships flourished among the Hellenistic kingdoms until they in turn\ncame under Roman rule, not only the value of political participation,\nbut also the proper domains of politics, were widely debated.\nDifferent authors would orient themselves respectively to\nstill-surviving polis communities and the various leagues which united\nmany of them in the Hellenistic period; to the kingdoms mentioned\nabove; to the Roman constitution, and eventually to the special forms\nof imperial power which eventually arose therein; and in more\nphilosophical terms, to the cosmos as a whole and all rational beings\nwithin it. \nIn addition to the major movements of Epicureanism and Stoicism\ntreated separately below, other schools also persisted and arose in\nthis period. Those persisting included the Platonic Academy\n(transformed in a skeptical direction) and the Aristotelian Lyceum\n(the Peripatetic School). Newcomers, albeit tracing themselves to\ntheir own understanding of the figure of Socrates, included the Cynics\nand the Pyrrhonist skeptics, and we focus on these latter two\nhere. \nThe Cynics took their name from the Greek for “dog,”\nreferring to the animal-like life indifferent to social conventions\nwhich they pursued, carrying out all their bodily functions in full\npublic view. While this generally led them to advocate what might be\nconsidered more an anti-politics than a politics, a provocative\nstatement by their founder Diogenes of Sinope (c.404–323 BCE)\n– answering a query about his birthplace by asserting himself to\nbe a “citizen of the world” (Diogenes Laertius, VI. 63)\n– would resonate with later Stoics and others developing a\npolitical philosophy that has become known as cosmopolitanism (see the\nentry on\n cosmopolitanism).\n Diogenes’ indifference to political power was also reflected in his\nreported reply to the visiting world-conqueror Alexander the Great,\nasking him to request a boon: all the Cynic wanted was for the emperor\nto step out of his light (Diogenes Laertius, VI. 38). In a lineage\nstretching from Diogenes to his follower Crates, who became the\nteacher of Zeno, the founder of Stoicism, we can see the Cynic-Stoic\nkinship especially in the early Stoics’ rejection of many conventional\npolitical and moral opinions. Yet the Cynics also manifested some\nparallels with the Epicureans and even with the skeptics. \nOne branch of ancient skepticism had its roots in Plato’s Academy,\nwhich from the time of Arcesilaus’ headship in the mid-260s BCE turned\nin a skeptical direction, arguing that there was no clear criterion of\ntruth and so philosophers can only suspend judgment. While that was an\n“Academic” position within philosophical debate, a\npossible forebear (Pyrrho) had in the fourth century BCE putatively\ndemonstrated the tranquility of mind which such a position could\nbring, by living a life seemingly without any investment in the truth\nof his beliefs (though the question of how, and how far, Pyrrho was\nguided by appearances would perplex later followers). (See the entry\non\n Pyrrho.)\n From the first century BCE, a radical movement of\n“Pyrrhonist” skepticism was developed outside the Academy\nby Aenesidemus, followed about a century later by Agrippa, in a\nmovement summed up for posterity in the second-century CE work of\nSextus Empiricius (Outlines of Pyrrhonism) which would have a\nconsiderable influence on early modern philosophy. Meanwhile the\nmilder “Academic” skepticism, allowing the inquirer to\nincline to one side or another though not to invest in full belief,\nhad significant influence on first-century BCE figures such as Cicero.\n(See the entry on\n ancient skepticism.) \nFounded by Epicurus in his “Garden” in Athens in the early\nthird century BCE, and elaborated by, among others, the remarkable\nLatin poet Lucretius in the mid first century BCE, the various members\nof the Epicurean school did not see politics as a straightforward part\nof the good life or a fulfillment of the flourishing of human nature,\nthough their views of its origins, nature, and largely instrumental\nvalue were complex (for an overview, see Robitzsch 2017). For his\npart, Epicurus himself (see the entry on\n Epicurus)\n is reported in his “Key Doctrines” to have held a\ncontractarian view of justice for mutual protection from harm\n(reminiscent of Glaucon’s initial proposal about justice in\nRepublic Book II, which itself seems to echo the\nnomos-phusis debate among the 5th c. BCE sophists). Justice\nserves utility (Alberti 1995): as Epicurus wrote, “If someone\nmakes a law and it does not happen to accord with the utility of\nsocial relationships, it no longer has the nature of justice”\n(KD 36, LS 22B). The greatest utility is that of tranquility\nor security, which is the naturally desired end or goal. While, as\nAnnas 1993: 298 argues, the individual Epicurean agent will be\ndisposed to justice as part of the path to tranquility properly\nunderstood (“The just <life> is most free from\ndisturbance…”, KD 36, LS 22B), nevertheless laws\nwill be necessary to enforce obedience to the contract by most people,\nand indeed one should obey the laws in order to attain peace of mind\n(KD 34–35, LS 22A4–5). \nFor Epicureans, the city serves a legitimate and necessary function in\nensuring security. But this does not mean that an active public life\nis also normally the most rational path to security. On the contrary,\nwhile many people will be attracted to the possible fortune and glory\nof such a life, and while cities need such people, the Epicurean sage\nwill on the whole refrain from active political participation (for\ndiscussion of texts, including some exceptions, both in Lucretius and\nother evidence, see Fowler 2007). Instead the insecurities of life are\nbest met by the formation of a community of friends living together\nand sharing their lives. Friendships both secure us against risks and\nanxieties (more reliably than the hazards of a political career) and\nalso provide pleasures and indeed joy: to quote Epicurus once again,\n“The man of noble character is chiefly concerned with wisdom and\nfriendship. Of these the former is a mortal good, but the latter is\nimmortal” (Vatican Sayings 78, LS 22F (7)). \nA potential sticking point for Epicurean ethics and politics is the\njustification for a still further dimension of communal life: the\nwillingness to sacrifice oneself for a friend, or to risk breaking the\nlaw for the greater good of one’s fellow citizens (Sharples 1996:\n122). It would seem difficult to construct a compelling theoretical\njustification for such actions from Epicurean premises, which\nprivilege obedience to law in order to avoid civic strife (as seen for\nexample in key moments in Lucretius’ poem De Rerum Natura,\nV.925–1157; see Campbell 2003, especially on lines 1011–1027),\nthough Cicero has Torquatus report in De Finibus (I.69) that\nat least some Epicureans believed that friendly relationships could\nmature into love of a friend for their own sake. Whatever the\ntheoretical conundrum, it did not prevent a number of Epicureans from\nundertaking such risky public service, among them more than one of the\nassassins of Julius Caesar (Sedley 1997; Fowler 1989 discusses a wide\nrange of Roman Epicurean attitudes). A more modest but still striking\nexample of Epicurean public service is the huge portico inscribed with\nEpicurean sayings and exegesis in second-century Oenoanda (in\nmodern-day Turkey) by one Diogenes of that city (Smith 1992, 2003).\nWhether or not his fellow citizens appreciated the instruction, modern\narchaeologists and philosophers are grateful for this unparalleled\nsource of knowledge of Epicurean philosophy. \nWhile Epicurus held that the sage would not engage in politics except\nin “some special circumstance,” Zeno, the founder of the\nStoic school (see the entry on\n Stoicism),\n held rather that a true sage “will engage in politics unless\nsomething prevents it” (Seneca, De Otio 3.2, as\ntranslated and quoted in Sharples 1996: 124; SVF 1.271). As\nwe shall see, a Stoic commitment to politics generally took it to be\npart of nature’s rational plan for human happiness, though this was\nnot incompatible with a Cynic tincture of questioning whether existing\nlaws are truly in accordance with the natural law (Vogt 2008). The\nquestion however of the nature of the polity in which politics was to\nbe exercised remains contested as a matter of the interpretation of\nvarious Stoic figures, who across the lifetime of the school\nencompassed both the early generation of the school’s leaders (Zeno\nand his successor Chrysippus) and later figures thriving in the Roman\nperiod who wrote variously in Greek and in Latin (for an overview, see\nLaurand 2005). To be sure, the polity in question was invariably\nfigured as a city, according to the account given in Dio Chrysostom\n(36.20: “ They [the Stoics] say that a city is a group of people\nliving in the same place and administered by law” (SVF\n3.329, as translated in LS 67J). But which people? Whether the members\nof this city were to be all humans together with the gods, or only\nhuman sages and the gods, and whether the city is to be envisaged as a\ndistinct foundation or as identical with the cosmos, has much\nexercised both Stoic thinkers and subsequent interpreters. And which\nlaw? How does or should the law of a particular city relate to the\nnatural law? These questions are canvassed further as this section\nunfolds. \nBoth Zeno and Chrysippus wrote works in the Platonic genre entitled\nRepublic, neither of which survives in full. (So too,\nreportedly, had Diogenes the Cynic.) Zeno’s was written as a young\nman, allegedly under Cynic influence, rejecting the use of money in\nthe characteristic Cynic vein. His portrait of the republic combines\nthe Stoic idea of a natural law by which human conduct is harmonized\nwith cosmic order, with a classical vision of politics in which a\nPlatonic ideal of friendship through communist and sexual bonding\n(more erotic than familial for Zeno) persists (following Schofield\n1991: 22–56). He seems to have adopted Plato’s prescription for\nthe community of women and children, and at least some aspects of his\ninsistence on the potential civic equality of men and women and\npolitical irrelevance of their anatomical differences. Humans share\nmany characteristics and tendencies with other animals, and their\ninitial impulse to form into society is a social rather than strictly\npolitical one: they are animated by a tendency to associate with those\nakin to themselves (the Stoic notion of oikeiôsis). \nSuch a social tendency is, according to what is reported of the\nopening of Chrysippus’ lost treatise On Law, transformed into\na political relationship by means of law: “Law is king of all\nthings human and divine. Law must preside over what is honourable and\nbase, as ruler and as guide, and thus be the standard of right and\nwrong, prescribing to animals whose nature is political what they\nshould do, and prohibiting them from what they should not do”\n(SVF 3.314, as translated in LS 67R). Yet, in keeping with\nsome tendencies in Platonism and Cynicism, such law might have to be\nradically different from existing laws if it is to be in full\nconformity with nature and reason. For Chrysippus, even certain forms\nof incest are said to have been “discredited without\nreason” (SVF 3.753, as translated in LS 67F): a\ncomparison with animals would license them. \nPlutarch’s characterization of Zeno’s Republic\nas prescribing that “we should regard all men as our\nfellow-citizens and local residents” (SVF 1.262, as\ntranslated in LS 67A), composed around the end of the first century of the Common Era, has often been read as prescribing a kind of\ncosmopolitanism that builds on Diogenes’ paradoxical Cynic version of\nthat stance.  However, the reliability of this text as an account of Zeno\nhas been questioned, and just how this fellowship of all humans\nrelates to the fellowship of rationally perfect sages and to the\nsharing of humans and gods in the cosmos has been debated (for a\ndefense and interpretation of Plutarch’s claim as applying to all\nhumans, see Vogt 2008: 86–90, contra the views of Schofield 1991 and\nVander Waerdt\n 1991).[11]\n Arguably, as in the case of Aristotle, the underlying kinship by\nnature establishes a potential for a full civic membership which is to\nbe based solely on virtue, itself potentially available to all\nrational beings but realized in practice by few or perhaps even none.\nThis is one interpretation of the report that Zeno presented\n“only virtuous people in the Republic as citizens,\nfriends, relations and free” (as translated in LS 67B; this is\npreserved in Diogenes Laertius 7.32–7.33, found in SVF\n1.226 and 1.222 respectively). \nEspecially for the early Stoics, existing cities remained an accepted\narena both for political action in practice—Stoic sages and\nscholars advising kings and serving in offices (SVF 3.686;\ntranslated in LS 67W)—insofar as the notion of a distinctive\nindividual city remained the principal framework for defining the\nnature of politics in terms of justice. Yet the role of natural law\nalready in the early Stoics, and certainly in later ones, came to\nsupport an alternative horizon for politics on the scale of the cosmos\nas a whole (Laurand 2005). Malcolm Schofield (1991: 103) has argued\nthat this development “mediates the transition from\nrepublicanism to natural law theory,” so bequeathing a crucial\nresource to early modern thinkers who sought to construct new versions\nof the latter. Meanwhile, in the years of the Roman republic, certain\naffinities between Stoic and republican ideas proved significant, as\nwe shall now see. \nRoman fascination with Greek philosophy was catalyzed by the Athenian\nembassy of three leading philosophers sent to Rome to plead the legal\ncase of their city in 156/155\n BCE;[12]\n it continued as late as the early sixth century CE, as seen\nespecially in the life of the eminent philosophical polymath and Roman\nsenator under barbarian rule, Boethius. Roman aristocrats were\nespecially attracted to the Stoic willingness to countenance the\nkingly and political lives alongside the scholarly one as equally\npreferable (SVF 3.686, translated in LS 67W). They began to\nstudy the Stoa seriously from the late second century BCE. The\naffinity between Stoicism and Roman republicanism was enhanced by the\nsecond-century Stoic teacher Panaetius, who seems to have argued that\nthe Roman mos maiorum or ancient ways and customs were the\nbest form of government, so burnishing philosophical principle with\nthe ancestral piety dear to the Romans. To be sure, in the later\nthroes of civil war, many Stoics would have difficulty in justifying\nassassination of tyrants, insofar as civil war would be worse than\neven a monarchy flouting the law, as one Roman adherent to the school\nwould say in rebuffing Junius Brutus’ attempt to recruit him to the\nconspiracy to murder Caesar (Plut. Brut. 12. 3–4).\nOther Romans were strongly attracted to Epicureanism or to Cynicism,\nand some of these, however paradoxically, likewise played significant\nroles in political life. Thus the distinctive lineaments of the Roman\nrepublic, now to be described, were debated and interpreted by the\nphilosophically minded in terms of Greek political theory. \nWhile the founders of the city of Rome were said to be the legendary\ntwins Romulus and Remus, Romans would come to identify the origins of\ntheir distinctive liberty in the killing of a tyrannical king,\ngenerally dated in 509 BCE, by the ancestor of the Junius Brutus who\nwould eventually kill Julius Caesar. The position of king was replaced\nby two annually elected consuls, the royal council became the Senate,\nand popular assemblies were established to elect magistrates and pass\nthe laws they proposed. By Cicero’s time, this\nregime—self-identified as the S.P.Q.R., the “Senatus\npopulusque Romanus” or “Senate and people of\n Rome”[13]–\n had become interpreted as a version of the “mixed\nconstitution” which had had a long if complicated and until then\nrelatively minor history as an idea in the works of Thucydides, Plato,\nand Aristotle (Hahm 2009). An influential account of Rome as such a\nmixed constitution, in this case combining the three classical regime\nforms of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, had already been given\nby the Greek historian Polybius, who referred to the distinction\nbetween the characteristic powers in each kind of regime and their\nmutual checking and balancing (Histories 6.11–18; see\nvon Fritz 1954). Whereas in Polybius the achievement of balance\nbetween the different powers was portrayed as resulting from mutual\nrivalrous self-assertion, Cicero would refer to it in more harmonious\nlanguage, a form of balancing (compensatio, De rep.\nII. 57) with the ideas of mixing and tempering paramount, as observed\nby E.M. Atkins (2000: 491). (For a useful overview of Roman political\nthought, see J.W. Atkins 2018.) \nAccording to Polybius, each element of the constitution exercised a\ndistinctive form of power. The elected consuls wielded\nimperium, a form of executive command; the Senate enjoyed the\npower to deliberate and consent to specific policies; and the popular\nassemblies served as the source of authoritative law, also electing\nthe magistrates, including the popular tribunes who in turn exercised\nveto powers over the Senate. An originally republican formula relating\nthe consuls to the people as the source of authoritative law survives\nin a complete prescript of the Augustan period: “Titus Quinctius\nCrispinus [consul] lawfully asked the people, and the people lawfully\nresolved,” as translated in Lintott 1999: 3. The perennial Greek\ncontest between oligarchs and democrats had been tamed in Rome to\nallow a recognized security of role for the Senate, a group drawn from\nno lower than the minor ranks of aristocracy and typically rewarding\nbirth as well as the merit that had been gained and expressed in\nelection to high political offices. Yet the tumultuous personal quest\nfor office and influence led many aristocrats to seek support among\nthe people, sometimes with radical measures of land reform which\nCicero, among others, would resolutely oppose. The theorizing of the\nproper role of aristocratic leadership and Senatorial independence,\ntogether with Platonic analogies for the requisite concord and harmony\nin the city, would become central themes of Cicero’s political\nphilosophy, as he wrote: “What the musicians call harmony with\nrespect to song is concord in the state, the tightest and best bond of\nsafety in every republic; and that concord can never exist without\njustice” (De rep. II.69.) \nMarcus Tullius Cicero (106–43 BCE) was the most famous\n“homo novus” or new man of Roman politics, hailing from a\nminor provincial landowning family rather than the great clans of\nhereditary nobility. He rose to the office of consul and the lifetime\nSenatorial membership it subsequently conferred by his audacious wit\nas a lawyer and orator in public prosecutions. His greatest moment as\nconsul in 63 BCE came in exposing a conspiracy by Catiline; the brutal\nsuppression of the conspiracy by executing Roman citizens without\ntrial, however, would tar his political legacy. He became an enemy of\nJulius Caesar (though accepting a pardon from him at the end of a\nstretch of civil wars in 47 BCE), seeing the assertion of power first\nby Caesar and then Marc Antony as fatal to the republic. Having\ndefended in his De officiis the kind of tyrannicide that he\ntook the killing of Caesar in 44 BCE to have constituted, and attacked\nAntony mercilessly in his series of fourteen Philippics the\nfollowing year, Cicero was murdered in response by partisans of the\nthen-ruling Triumvirate to which Antony belonged. \nThe writings of Cicero were virtually canonized subsequent to his\ndeath as classic models of rhetoric and philosophy; as Richard Tuck\n(1990: 43) has remarked, “For fifteen hundred years, from the\nfourth century to the nineteenth, schoolchildren in Europe were\nexposed daily to two books. One was the Bible, and the other was the\nworks of Cicero.” His many speeches and letters are themselves\nof considerable political and often philosophical interest, reworking\nthe evaluative vocabulary of Roman law and politics in ways which\nsuited his overarching (and changing) political purposes (for a\ncritical assessment, see Gildenhard 2011, which concludes that\n“In his rhetoric Cicero...consistently refused to recognize the\npositions of his adversaries as genuine political positions and\nchallenged their identities as senatorial peers, Roman citizens, or\neven human beings ”(Gildenhard 2011: 390). While his\nphilosophical writings—composed for the most part as a student\nof philosophy in Rome and Athens, and then in a brief period\n(46–44 BCE) when political developments led him to retreat from\nactive public life — cover a wide range of topics, including for\nexample, among those especially relevant to politics are two works on\nthe political role of the orator and the nature of oratory or\nrhetoric, celebrating the moral purposes of the orator as essential to\nthe success of republican government. \nWhile Cicero adhered to a moderate skepticism in general philosophical\nmatters, he would draw on a number of Stoic ideas in formulating his\nown ethical and political teachings: these were shaped by the lectures\nhe had attended by the Stoic Posidonius in Rhodes, the writings of\nPosidonius’ teacher Panaetius and other earlier and contemporary Stoic\ntexts, as well as (we may speculate) conversation with the Stoic\nDiodotus whom he accommodated in his household in Rome for many years.\nIn particular, Cicero emphasized the Stoic themes of the natural\naffinity for society and the existence of natural law. At the same\ntime, Platonic themes and models were also important in his political\nwritings. The discussion below is limited to the two dialogues which\nare explicitly modeled on Plato’s Republic and Laws,\ntitled by Cicero in Latin De re publica and De\nlegibus ( On the Commonwealth and On the Laws),\ntogether with his most important work on political ethics, the De\nofficiis (On Duties), which exercised particular\ninfluence on subsequent Western moral and political thought. \nDe re publica was composed by Cicero between 54 and 51 BCE, a\nturbulent period of strife in Roman politics. Its dramatic setting is\nin 129 BCE during the crisis caused by Tiberius Gracchus, a consul who\nhad championed a property redistribution law for the people and whom\nmembers of the Senate had violently suppressed as a putative threat to\nRoman civil order. All of it except the “Dream of Scipio”\n(Book VI) was lost from the Middle Ages onward; it has been\nreconstructed from references and excerpts in later authors,\nsupplemented by a palimpsest of much of Books I–III discovered in\n1819. Framed as a dialogue between Scipio Aemilianus, a hero of the\nresistance against Tiberius Gracchus and his like-minded brother, and\nseveral others of his actual contemporaries, the dialogue has a\ndiscernible structure identified by E.M. Atkins (2000: 490): Books\nI–II treat “the best condition of the res\npublica”; Books III–IV treat “justice and human\nnature”, topics common to the best city and the best citizen;\nand Books V–VI treat the “best citizen’ in discussing the\nstatesman and in the Dream of Scipio. \nWhile justice was for Cicero, as for the Greeks, the fundamental bond\nof the commonwealth, he offered distinctive and influential linked\ndefinitions of the res publica (”commonwealth“,\nor more literally the ”public thing“) as the res\npopuli, the ”property/thing of the people“, and of a\npopulus or ”people“ in turn as ”an\nassemblage associated with one another by agreement on “law”\n[iuris consensu] and community of interest [utilitatis\ncommunione]“ (both, I.39). This could be interpreted either\nas a strong normative claim —the people agree on ”law“\n[ius], also translatable as right or justice, and share a\ncommon interest — or alternatively in a weaker deflationary\nmanner, the people nominally accepting a common law and sharing a\ncommon conception of their self-interest which may or may not be in\naccord with\n justice.[14]\n Such ambiguity would be famously exploited by Augustine, who used\nCicero’s definition to argue that lacking justice, conflicted and\ndivided republican Rome had been no commonwealth, before offering his\nown even weaker definition of a ”people“ as those united\nin (any) common love (City of God, II.21). In Cicero’s own\nhands, the definitions were used to stress that the commonwealth was\nthe property of the people, who entrusted it to the magistrates to be\nused for the common good (I.51–2), and that the ”welfare\nof the people is the supreme law“ (”salus populi suprema\nlex“, De leg. III.8; this was a reference to a maxim in\nthe ancient ”Twelve Tables“ compendium of Roman law). It\nfollowed too that just as Plato denied the title of a (single unified)\nregime to the imperfect regimes torn by civil discord, so Cicero\ninferred that a corrupt regime was not strictly speaking a res\npublica at all (III.43–48). The role of the statesman\n(rector rei publicae) is to aim at the happiness of the\ncitizens, defined in a laxer way than most Greek philosophers would\nallow, as wealth, true glory, and virtue all combined. \nThe character Scipio adheres to Greek philosophical principles in\ndeclaring that ”the commonwealth cannot possibly function\nwithout justice“ (II.70), adhering to the standard abstract\ndefinition in an Aristotelian vein of justice as ”giving each\ntheir due“ (ius suum cuique tribuere). In Book III, two\nother dialogue participants present respectively the famous arguments\ngiven on one day for justice, and on the next day against justice, by\nthe skeptical Greek philosopher and ambassador to Rome Carneades\nduring the embassy in 156/155 BCE mentioned above. Cicero’s\npresentation reverses the order, no doubt to give justice the last\nword. \nIn Cicero’s hands, Carneades’ case against justice avails itself of\nthe nomos/phusis contrast and of the kind of ambition for\npower expressed by Plato’s character Callicles in the\nGorgias. Justice is not natural, as it differs radically\namong different peoples; it conflicts with wisdom, which tells us\n”to rule over as many people as possible, to enjoy pleasures, to\nbe powerful, to rule, to be a lord“ (III.24b), and it is fatal\nfor states and empires, which can’t survive without injustice. In\nreply, the speech for justice avails itself of Stoic themes:\n”true law is right reason, consonant with nature“; there\nis ”one eternal and unchangeable law“ [i.e. what has come\nto be known as ”natural law“] (III.33). This includes rule\nof the best over the weakest for the benefit of the latter (III.36):\nas in Plato’s Republic, the justice of rulership is not\nexploitation but paternalistic benefit. And as in Plato’s\nRepublic Book X, where the myth of Er supplies a revisionary\nreligious justification for justice (it will help you to choose your\nnext reincarnation well), so Cicero’s Republic concludes with\na dream recounted by Scipio Aemilianus about his even more eminent\nRoman ancestor, Scipio Africanus. The dream describes the divine order\nwhich not only rewards humans for just service to their city (VI.13),\nbut also puts human affairs in a cosmic perspective designed to\nembolden them to care more for justice than for petty human\nadvantage: \nyou must always look at these heavenly bodies and scorn what is human.\nWhat fame can you achieve in what men say, or what glory can you\nachieve that is worth seeking?” (VI.20) \nIn a dramatic rejection even of the traditional Roman motives of honor\nand glory as conventional motivations to virtue, the imagined elder\nstatesman asks: “…and even the people who talk about\nus—how long will they do that?” (VI.21). As Jed W. Atkins\nhas observed (2013:76), glory is in the Dream “first devalued,\nand then revalued”, in a Platonically inspired image of\n“the glory of the heavenly realm to which good statesmen will\nreturn” (2013: 77–78). \nDe legibus, or On the Laws, is also written as a\ndialogue, but one set in Cicero’s own day with himself, his brother,\nand closest friend as the interlocutors, gathered at his country\nestate of Arpinum. Probably begun after De re publica, it was\nlikewise written in the years immediately before 51 BCE, and similarly\nsurvives only in piecemeal and fragmentary form. Books I–II treat\nnatural law or ius naturae, with “Marcus” (Cicero\nhimself) declaring that “law is the highest reason, rooted in\nnature” (I.18), and that men, bound to the gods by reason, are\n“born for justice” (I.28–32). However, “the\ncorruption of bad habits…extinguishes…the sparks given\nby nature” (I.33) and can result in the formation of bad laws.\nSuch iniquitous laws as those passed by tyrants are not just (I.42);\nnor is the title of law to be conferred upon “what bandits have\nagreed among themselves” (II.13). \nIn Books II–III, the speakers prescribe an ideal law code, based on\nbut modifying Roman law; notably, for example, the institution of the\ntribunate is defended (III.16–17). As these prescriptions, and\nthe circumstances of their writing (a temporary retreat from active\npolitics), suggest, Cicero had a complex attitude to the Greek dilemma\nposing the lives of philosophy and of politics as opposed\nalternatives. He saw philosophy as a source of insight and perspective\nrelevant to politics, but after his early studies, devoted himself to\nit primarily when temporarily debarred from more active pursuits. One\nmight say that philosophy became, beyond its intrinsic value, a form\nof alternative public service when the forum was too dangerous for him\nto enter (here following the reflection along these lines offered by\nBaraz 2012). \n“The De officiis, not the De re publica, is\nCicero’s Republic” (Long 1995: 240). This dictum of A.\nA. Long holds true not only in the sense that for Cicero, as for Plato\nand Aristotle, ethics was inseparable from politics. It is true also\nand more profoundly insofar as the De officiis takes up the\nsame subject as Plato’s Republic, namely the apparent\nconflict between justice and individual advantage, and proposes\nbroadly the same resolution, namely that the conflict is only ever\napparent: violating one’s officia or duties can never serve\none’s advantage so long as both are properly understood. Book I treats\nwhat is virtuous, or honestas; Book II treats what is\nadvantageous, or utilitas; and Book III considers cases to\nshow that any apparent conflict is illusory. \nThe most difficult case to resolve according to the overall argument\nof the book is that of advantage when understood as political\nambition, driven by greatness of spirit. As Cicero acknowledges, and\nas was especially true in the highest echelons of Roman society,\n“Men are led most of all to being overwhelmed by forgetfulness\nof justice when they slip into desiring positions of command or honour\nor glory” (I.26). The solution is to aim only at true glory,\nsuch as can be gained only through the fulfillment of one’s\nofficia. Similar casuistry enables Cicero to resolve in\naccordance with his thesis a range of common cases where advantage\nmight be sought at the expense of justice (in administering the estate\nof an orphan, for example, a common duty of eminent Romans). Yet such\ncasuistry is always advanced within a context of celebration of\njustice and natural law: it is not simply that in fact justice never\nconflicts with advantage, but that justice properly understood is\nalways to one’s advantage as a human being. \nAs in Plato, a redefinition of the virtues plays a crucial role in the\noverall argument for the benefits of justice. For Cicero, the virtues\nare Romanized as officia, understood not only as duties in\nthe abstract but rather as obligations of role or relationship, each\nattaching to someone in virtue of a distinct persona (whether\nas father, consul, neighbor, and so on, or simply as a human being).\nSome virtues are rooted in one’s persona as a human being\nsubject to natural law, others in the specific roles and customs of\none’s city. Four principal virtues are identified: wisdom; justice,\nresting on fides (good faith and credit) and respect for\nproperty; greatness of spirit; and decorum. Respect for property is a\nkeystone of Cicero’s political thought, here very far from the current\nin Platonism which subordinated property to civic harmony. \nStrikingly, whereas tyrannicide might appear to be a difficult case\nfor such an ethical code to confront, Cicero presents it —\nwriting later in the year that Caesar was assassinated—as the\nstraightforwardly ethically correct choice. Cicero couches his case in\nStoic terms of naturalness and fellowship (Dyck 1996, ad loc.\nto Off.III.29–32). His pivotal move is to deny that tyrants\nare party to the otherwise universal nature of human fellowship. Thus\nhe asserts that “there can be no fellowship between us and\ntyrants…just as some limbs are amputated if they\nare…harming other parts of the body, similarly if the wildness\nand monstrousness of a beast appears in human form, it must be removed\nfrom the common humanity…of the body”\n(Off.III.32: ostensibly about the tyrant Phalaris). \nAlthough Rome ruled over an empire long before Cicero died, and the\nrepublican constitution that he had served would remain formally\nintact in many respects long after that date as well, the imperial era of Roman\ngovernment is standardly associated with the elevation of Octavian by\nthe Senate in 27 BCE by according him the title of\n“Augustus” (among other novel titles and combinations of\noffices that he was then and later accorded). Octavian and a number of\nhis successors were also referred to as the princeps,\nliterally the first man, implicitly the first among nominal equals,\nsometimes translated by the English derivation ‘prince’, and so giving\nrise to the description of the period from 27 BCE–284 CE as the\nPrincipate (to be followed in turn by the Dominate). In this period,\nStoicism continued to exercise an important hold, drawing in part on\nthe Hellenistic genre of advice to kings; Platonism too, and forms of\nPythagoreanism, regained much sway. Moreover, a number of Stoic-minded\nwriters and orators played their parts in Roman political life, some\nfashioning the life of a philosopher itself into a distinctive form of\nwhat might be called non-political politics (Trapp 2007). In this\narticle, I cannot explore the full ramifications of these\nphilosophical developments under the Empire, in writers in Greek as\nwell as in Latin, and influencing not only pagan but also Jewish and\nChristian thinkers. The article also leaves aside the many and varied\nimportant contributions to political thought in Rome and its\npossessions made not by philosophers but by historians, including\nLivy, Sallust, Diodorus Siculus, Tacitus, and Suetonius. (Again, for\nan overview that seeks to integrate political and historical\ndevelopments with political theorizing, see J.W. Atkins 2018.) \nIf Cicero as a new man made senator had to contend with the\ncompetitive pressures of republican politics, Seneca (c. 3\nBCE–65 CE), as a new man (from Spain) made senator a century\nlater, had to contend with the problem of advising, and surviving, the\npoisonous politics of intimacy with the princeps. For Seneca,\nStoic philosophy (of which he was an avowed exponent, though other\nphilosophical influences can also be found in his ideas), can be best\nsquared with politics if the ruler is supremely virtuous: in that\ncase, the Stoic wise man is the king or prince. \nLike Cicero, Seneca wrote essays in natural as well as political\nphilosophy, including for example a significant analysis of the give\nand take of benefits or reciprocal gifts and favors in political life\n(De beneficiis, recently translated afresh by Griffin and\nInwood, 2011), and even a De officiis (which is lost). Like\nCicero, he wrote important collections of letters (and where Cicero\nwrote poetry, Seneca also wrote plays). The letters include his\ndistinctive “consolations” which would inaugurate a new\nphilosophical and literary genre (see the entry on\n Seneca).\n  \nIn this large corpus, arguably his most important surviving work for\npolitical philosophy is his De clementia (“On\nMercy”), addressed to the emperor Nero whom he served as tutor\n(in rhetoric, not in philosophy) and later in the capacity of\nofficially designated amicus or friend (Veyne 2003, vii, 19).\nPresented as a “mirror” in which Nero could see himself\nand the consequences of his virtue (1.1.1), this text would become a\nfountainhead of the “mirror for princes” genre in\nsubsequent centuries. The challenge was how to reconcile the virtue of\njustice with that of clementia, clemency or mercy, a\ndistinctively Roman virtue (not corresponding exactly to any Greek\nword: Braund 2009, 33) that had been incorporated into public life as\na virtue of the Roman people (clementia populi Romani) and\nattributed specifically in cultic form to Caesar Augustus (previously\nOctavian) as clementia Caesaris (included as one of\n“the four virtues attributed to Augustus on an honorific\nshield,” as observed by Griffin 2000: 540; see more generally\nFlamerie de Lachapelle 2011). Appealing to the related Stoic virtue of\nphilanthrôpia in Greek, humanitas in Latin, or\nlove of humankind, Seneca claimed that, by taking into account all the\ncircumstances of the affair, clemency can claim to embody, as it were,\na more perfect justice (iustissimum), than would the\nobservance of the strict letter of the law (2.7.3, as discussed by\nBraund 2009, 66–70). \nSeneca manages to defend clemency’s claim to the rank of virtue by\ndistinguishing it both from its opposite, crudelitas or\ncruelty, and from a related disposition, misericordia, pity\nor compassion, which for the Stoics counted as a vice (2.4.4). The\nStoic sage will exercise clemency by attending to the circumstances\nand causes of the criminal’s act, but also by seeking in various ways\nto improve the latter’s character (1.14.1–3, 1.16.1–3), an approach\nthat goes back at least to Plato (Prt. 324a–c,\nGrg.469a–b), doing so with parsimony and discernment\nbetween those who are curable and those who are not (again with Plato,\nGrg.525a–526b). Indeed, Seneca asserts that those who\nare curable will generally strive subsequently to become worthy of the\nclemency shown to them by the prince (2.2.1), a principle illustrated\nby the story of Augustus’ clemency toward the conspirator Cnaeus\nCornelius Cinna, who would become his lifelong friend (1.9). In good\nStoic fashion, Seneca finally shows that the virtue of clemency is\nboth valuable in itself and also beneficial. It sustains the rule of a\nprince by inspiring love in his subjects (1.19.6), whereas cruelty\naugments the number of his enemies (1.8.7). And conversely, whereas\nmisericordia wallows in a wrongful and inefficient emotional\npity for the treatment that justice would prescribe of the criminal\n(2.6.1), clemency improves the criminal more efficiently than cruelty\nwould do (1.22.1), and for this and other reasons better aims at the\ngood of mankind. It is worth noting finally that, while Seneca\nspecifies that clemency should also extend to slaves, his\ncosmopolitanism stopped short of advocating their manumission or the\nabolition of slavery (Griffin 1992:\n 256–85).[15] \nSeneca did not limit himself to the political function of advising\nrulers. Instead, he conceived the role of philosophy as benefiting\npeople generally, in the widest sense of a cosmopolitan ethics and\neven politics. His De otio (“On Leisure”)\ncontrasts the single commonwealth embracing gods and men in a cosmic\ncitizenship, with the ordinary multiple commonwealths to which the\naccidents of birth assign us (though these also rightly command\nallegiance) (4.1). Should such an ordinary regime turn lethal, the\nphilosopher remains a citizen of the cosmic commonwealth, and so his\nserenity can and should remain intact. That fate befell Seneca himself\nin 65 CE, when Nero accused him of conspiring in a planned\nassassination of the emperor and ordered him to commit suicide. To be\nsure, however, Seneca’s suicide reflected not only political\nobedience, but also, and perhaps more fundamentally, the belief,\npreviously expressed in his writings (in particular De\nprovidentia and De ira, as well as his letters) that\nsuicide is a supreme mark of freedom. No tyranny can so enslave us as\nto take away this freedom: a freedom to act based on the inner\nliberation of realizing that death and other worldly losses are in\nfact indifferent and irrelevant to happiness (Inwood 2005:\n307–9). \nSeneca was far from the only Stoic politically active in his day or in\nsuccessive generations. Others like Thrasea Paetus and Barea Soranus\nunder Nero, Helvidius Priscus under Vespasian, and Paconius Agrippinus\nunder Tiberius, chose to defy those whom they saw as tyrannical\nrulers, becoming known as the so-called ‘Stoic martyrs’. (On the\nvarieties of Stoicism under the principate, see the classic study of\nBrunt 2013, originally published in 1975.) Some Stoics spoke out\nagainst a wider range of customs that they took to be cruel or\nunfounded or otherwise irrational, most notably Musonius Rufus against\nsuch practices as the Athenians’ holding of gladiatorial games in the\nsame theatre of Dionysus where they celebrated religious festivals\n(assuming that it is indeed he who is described in Dio Chrysostom’s\nOrationes XXXI, 122), and against the social convention of\nexcluding women from philosophizing (for his fragments, see King\n2011). Yet these later Stoics made rather few detailed contributions\nto political philosophy, even if their fundamental analysis of living\naccording to nature and reason, as further developed by figures\nranging from the once-enslaved Epictetus to the emperor Marcus\nAurelius, remained an important touchstone for thinking about\npolitics. \nWhile the men of affairs in the Roman Senate and imperial court turned\noften (though not exclusively) to Stoicism, in the Greek centers of\nphilosophy and among provincial Greek men of affairs Platonism\nremained an important framework for thinking about both ethics and\npolitics, as did a related if somewhat shadowy form of\n Pythagoreanism\n which can be seen as a continuation of the genre of Hellenistic\nkingship treatises (Centrone 2000). The most important contributions\nmade to political thought by the Platonist philosopher of the\nsecond-century AD, Plutarch (c.46–c.120 CE), are his paired\nbiographical lives of Greek and Roman statesmen, each with a\ncomparison drawing political morals. Together with the histories of\nThucydides, Livy and Sallust, these Lives instructed\ngenerations of students in the principles and perils of political\nethics, and instituted the distinction between statesman and demagogue\nas we have come to know it today: with figures like the fifth-century\nBCE Athenian “Aristides the Just” embodying the ideal\nstatesmen, in contrast to the Platonic view of all past and present\nstatesmen as fatally flawed. Plutarch also made important\ncontributions to political philosophy in the many essays collected in\nhis volumes of Moralia. \nPlutarch was a committed but in some ways revisionist Platonist. His\nattitude to public life was more Roman than Platonic (befitting the\nrole in public affairs that he played in his own city): the political\nlife was for him unproblematically noble, not inferior to the life of\nphilosophy. Similarly, he revised the strict Platonic dictum that\nphilosophers must rule by allowing that philosophers might rule merely\nin the sense of advising rulers, not of being rulers themselves. (In\nfact, this move had some Platonic pedigree in the Statesman’s\ninsistence that the science of statecraft is the same whether known\nand exercised by an advisor or by an actual ruler (259a).) And he\nconsidered philosophy to be more of a character-building study than a\nsource of knowledge of exact or politically relevant knowledge. Where\nstatesmen were educated in philosophy, as for example in the\nLives of Pericles, Cicero, Brutus, and Cato Minor, he treats\nthis as valuable mainly because of the virtue—in particular,\nmoderation and self-restraint—which it imparts to them (Van\nRaalte 2005). The study of philosophy serves as a sort of inoculation\nagainst greed and immoderate ambition. But it need not impart any\nparticular substantive knowledge to the statesman (so competing\nphilosophies could all be useful in shaping virtue: Anaxagaorean\ninfluence on Pericles, an eclectic mixture of Stoicism, Academic\nskepticism, and Platonism on Cicero; Stoicism on the younger Cato).\nIndeed, excessively rigid adherence to a philosophy could be\ndeleterious, making a statesman rigid and inflexible. The younger Cato\nwas defeated when he stood for the consulship because, Plutarch says,\nhe experienced the same thing that happens to fruits that appear\n“out of season” (Phoc. 3.1). Like such fruits, he\nwas admired, but “the weight and grandeur” of his virtue\nwas “out of all proportion to the immediate times”\n(asummetron tois kathestōsi kairois, Phoc.\n3.2–3).  \nPlutarch’s political sympathies lay with monarchy. He treated the\nexemplary Greek or Roman statesman as inherently and ideally a kind of\nmonarchical figure, even when functioning within a democratic or\nrepublican environment. “Aristocratic and kingly” was his\npraise for Pericles’ type of true statesmanship (literally, his\n“politics” or “policy”, politeia),\nonce he has given up his initial recourse to demagogic methods\n(Per.14.2). Thus for all his admiration for Greek statesmen\nof the classical age, and his profound later influence on republican\nsentiments in Europe, Plutarch preferred monarchy as the best\nconstitution and believed that he was following his master Plato in so\ndoing. As John Dillon puts it, he held “that the accomplished\nstatesman, like a first-rate musician, will be able to make the best\nof any of the three basic constitutions [monarchy, aristocracy, or\ndemocracy] that he is given to work on” (Dillon 1997). To quote\nPlutarch himself on this point from his fragmentary writing “On\nMonarchy, Democracy, and Oligarchy”: \n…if he [the statesman] is given the choice among governments,\nlike so many tools, he would follow Plato’s advice and choose no other\nthan monarchy, the only one which is able to sustain that top note of\nvirtue, high in the highest sense, and never let it be tuned down\nunder compulsion or expediency. For the other forms of government in a\ncertain sense, although controlled by the statesman, control him, and\nalthough carried along by him, carry him along, since he has no firmly\nestablished strength to oppose those from whom his strength is\nderived… (Peri mon. 827bc) \nPlato’s collective virtuous aristocracy in the Republic (his\nphilosopher-kings and -queens, in the plural), was transmuted by\nPlutarch, perhaps under the influence of the singular kingly political\nexpert in the Statesman, into a monarchical\n ideal.[16] \nLater Platonic philosophers, known as Neoplatonists (see the entry on\n Plotinus),\n also focused primarily on ethics in the context of cosmology and\ntheology, stressing the ascent of the soul to a disembodied pure\nunderstanding of the One. Yet they made room for the political virtues\nof the embodied soul as a first step in this process of divinization\nor “becoming like God” (O’Meara 2003). In working out the\npolitical implications of such views, Plato’s Laws became an\nimportant model for theocratic political reform, especially as\nNeoplatonism became influential for a certain strand of Christian\nthinkers, in particular those able to absorb the translation of Greek\ntexts into Arabic. \nOn a continuum of political rule stretching from the sheer domination\nof some over others on one extreme, to a vision of collaborative\ndeliberation among equals for the sake of the good life on the other,\nmany ancient Greek and Roman political philosophers clearly staked out\nthe latter ground. The very idea of the city and the civic bond as\nrooted in justice was common ground across much of the spectrum of\nancient political philosophy. Even the Epicureans saw society as\nrooted in justice, although understanding justice in turn as rooted in\n utility.[17]\n Philosophers adhering to this approach were not however ignorant of\npossible objections to it. The diagnosis of politics as domination has\nnever been more powerfully advanced than by Plato’s character\nThrasymachus, nor has the attack on justice as a good life for the\nindividual ever been as powerfully made as by Plato’s character\nCallicles or the skeptic Carneades. The nostalgic view of ancient\npolitical philosophy as predicated on widely shared conceptions of\nhuman nature and the human good, before the splintering and fracturing\nof modernity, is an oversimplification. \nIt is true that those ancient visions of politics which rooted\nthemselves in a commitment to ethical cultivation and the common good\ndid not have to contend with the absolutist claims of rival versions\nof monotheistic religions. But the ancients did have to answer various\nforms of relativism, immoralism, and skepticism, contending with rival\nphilosophical schools which disagreed profoundly with one another. If\nsome of them chose to see politics as a domain of common benefit and a\nspace for the cultivation of virtue, this was not because it had not\noccurred to them that it could be thought of otherwise, but in part\nbecause they had developed powerful philosophical systems to support\nthis view. The experience and practices of the Greek poleis\n(the plural of polis) and the Roman res publica\nplayed important roles in shaping these approaches. \nPlato and Aristotle can in many ways be seen as defending some\nfundamental tenets of Greek ethics (such as the value of justice), but\ndoing so by means of advancing revisionist philosophical doctrines and\ndistancing themselves from the ways in which those tenets were\ninterpreted by the democratic institutions of their day. The range of\nethical and political views which they, along with their Hellenistic\nsuccessors, laid out, continue to define many of the fundamental\nchoices for modern philosophy, despite the many important innovations\nin institutional form and intellectual approach which have been made\nsince. Many of those innovations, indeed, came in response to a\nrevival of the ancient skeptical and relativist challenges: challenges\nalready known from their evolution within ancient political philosophy\nitself.","contact.mail":"mslane@princeton.edu","contact.domain":"princeton.edu"}]
