[{"date.published":"2021-04-15","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sin-christian/","author1":"Kevin Timpe","entry":"sin-christian","body.text":"\n\n\nWhile some have sought to give naturalistic accounts of sin (see Ruse\n2002), this entry treats sin as a religious concept. Sin plays a\ncentral role in many of the world’s major religions (see Graham\n2007), and this role is arguably its central connotation (see M. Adams\n1991). A full treatment of sin as a topic in the philosophy of\nreligion would therefore need to canvass a wide array of religious\ntraditions, such as Judaism and Islam (Watt 2009 and McGinnis 2018).\nSince Christianity develops out of Judaism, a historical discussion of\nChristian understandings of sin would also need to pay careful\nattention to sin as understood in Judaism BCE (see Anderson 2009, Katz\n2006, Graves 2016, and Bashevkin 2019). The present article focuses\nspecifically on treatments of sin within the contemporary Christian\nanalytic theological tradition.\n\n\nEven limited just to the contemporary Christian tradition,\n“sin” denotes a broad category which can be subcategorized\nin a number of ways. One could, for instance, classify sins in terms\nof offenses against different individuals or groups, as when one\ndistinguishes between sins against God, sins against others, and sins\nagainst oneself (see Sweeney 2018: 351; for other subcategorizations\nof sin in these terms, see Couenhoven 2013 and McCall 2019: chapter\n5). One could also differentiate between the moral wrong that has been\ndone by an act of sin (sometimes called “the problem of past\nsin”), and the moral wrong or sin that one is likely to do\n(sometimes called “the problem of future sin”; see Stump\n1988: 64). Future sins can be further divided between moral wrongs\nthat one is likely to do in virtue of one’s personal\ninclinations or dispositions, and moral wrongs that one is likely to\ndo in virtue of possessing a fallen or sinful human nature. The\npresent article will explore sin as an action\n (section 2),\n sin as a disposition or vice\n (section 3)\n and sin as a state or “the condition of being in\nsin”\n (section 4;\n see Plantinga 2000: 207).\n\n\nIt is important to note that commitment to one of these three\ncategories of sin does not entail a commitment to either or both of\nthe others; a commitment to the existence of sinful acts, for\ninstance, does not entail a commitment to sinful dispositions or\nvices. There are some in the Christian tradition who think that being\nvicious doesn’t entail being sinful (e.g., William of Ockham;\nsee Sweeney 2018). Furthermore, one can affirm the existence of both\nsinful actions and sinful dispositions without being committed to the\nexistence of sin as a state of being, that is, without being committed\nto the doctrine of original sin. Immanuel Kant, for instance, affirms\nthe two former categories while rejecting the latter (Kant\nReligion Within the Limits of Reason Alone [1793]; see also\nQuinn 1990). In addition to considering sin as action, disposition,\nand state, the present article also addresses the noetic effects of\nsin\n (section 5)\n and the idea of structural sin\n (section 6),\n according to which sin can be embedded in the structures of various\nsocial systems.\n\n\nMost contemporary philosophy of religion assumes either a framework of\ngeneric theism or the framework of Christianity. (While the present\ntreatment largely reflects this focus from the literature on which it\ndraws, it should be noted that this focus has been criticized on a\nnumber of fronts. (See, for instance, Knepper 2014, Draper &\nNichols 2013, Schilbrack 2014, Simmons 2019a, and Timpe & Hereth\n2019).) Discussions that assume the framework of generic theism often\nproceed along the lines of what Marilyn McCord Adams calls “a\nreligion-neutral value theory”. Religion-neutral value theories\nseek both to avoid dependence on values specific to a particular\nreligious tradition and to include only such value assumptions as\nwould also be acceptable to an atheologian (M. Adams 1988: 127; for a\ncriticism of such an approach, see Moser 2019). Philosophers who have\nadopted such theories have tended \nnot to speak of sin, but of moral agency and responsibility, of moral\ngoodness or turpitude. (M. Adams 1991: 1) \nMcCord Adams herself thinks this assumption of neutrality is\nunjustified, however, citing the significant difference in ontological\ncommitment between theists and atheologians, and the implications this\ndifference has for their moral theorizing: \nDifferent ontological commitments with their different stores of\nvaluables widen or narrow the range of options for defeating evils\nwith goods. Secular value theories can offer only packages of immanent\ngoods; some religious theories posit an infinite transcendent goodness\nand invite relationship to it; while Christianity believes the\ninfinite good to be personal, and locates the happiness of finite\npersons in loving personal intimacy with the divine persons. (M. Adams\n1988: 129; see also Plantinga 1985: 36) \nIn short, the degree to which a belief system can make sense of a\nparticular claim or theory depends on the resources within that belief\nsystem (see Hasker 2008: 17–19, 120). \nA religion-value neutral approach to sin, in particular, would be\nconstrained by the relatively small number of shared values between\ntheists and atheologians regarding the core concepts at stake,\nincluding the nature of the harms involved and the opportunities for\nreparation. As suggested by Plantinga 2000, M. Adams 1988, and Stump\n2010, the simple fact that different religious traditions have\ndifferent constraints to work with and different resources to draw on\ndoesn’t weigh for or against the plausibility of those\ntraditions. In this case, contemporary Christianity sets the value\nsystem within which conceptions of sin will be examined. \nWithin the Christian tradition, sin is typically seen as a privation,\nin line with the general privation view of evil (Mann 2001, Stump\n2003, and Couenhoven 2013). Otherwise, sin and evil become reified. If\nsin were a positively existing entity in its own right, then insofar\nas God is the creator and sustainer of all things, God would be\nresponsible for creating and sustaining sin. Yet as Copan notes, such\na position cuts directly against the fundamental goodness of\nGod’s creating act: \nWe do a disservice to the Christian doctrine of anthropology by\nemphasizing human wickedness to such a degree that we obscure the\ngoodness of God’s creation…. While Christian philosophers\nought not ignore the painfully obvious fact of human depravity, they\nmust set this against the backdrop of the goodness of God’s\ncreation. (Copan 2003: 522; see also Hasker 2008: 75; and Sweeney\n2018, 366) \nThis example demonstrates how Christian doctrines of sin can’t\nbe fully understood in isolation from other related theological\ndoctrines (see Timpe forthcoming, for methodological criticisms of\nChristian analytic theology). Rather, conceptions of sin should be\nunderstood in the context of human life and creation as a whole, \nin relation to God’s original intentions for humanity at\ncreation and the effects of God’s mercy, cleansing and\nforgiveness. (Johnson & Lauber 2016b: xi) \nA full exploration of the theological doctrine of sin, or\nhamartiology, in the Christian tradition would thus require\nextended engagement not only with particular biblical texts, but also\nwith other core Christian doctrines to which the doctrine of sin is\nclosely linked, such as creation, Christology, anthropology,\natonement, the sacraments, redemption, and eschatology (Bauerschmidt\n2016: 199). \nThe New Testament, like the Hebrew Scriptures, uses a wide range of\nterms for sin (the literature here is immense; See McCall 2019:\nchapter 1; Green 2017; and the essays in Johnson & Lauber 2016a),\nas well as employing a number of metaphors drawn from the earlier\nJewish tradition. Most prominent among those metaphors is the idea of\nsin as a stain, a burden, or a debt. These metaphors help establish\nthe contours in which a Christian hamartiology must be worked out, but\nnone of them fully encapsulates the Scriptures’ teaching on sin\n(Bashevkin 2019: 6). As these metaphors differ, what appears to be the\nproper response to sin also differs. Stains need to be cleansed.\nBurdens need to be lifted. Debts need to be paid or otherwise\ndischarged. (See Anderson’s Sin: A History for a\ndescription of the different uses of these metaphors and how the\ndominant metaphor shifts over the course of various Biblical texts.)\nMetaphors used to describe sin thus have a large impact on its\nphilosophical treatment in the Christian tradition. \nOne of the most common ways in which sinful actions have been\ncharacterized is as actions in conflict with the behaviors and\npatterns of life to which God calls humanity. The term\n“actions” should here be broadly construed to include\nomissions as well as commissions: we sin when we fail to love our\nneighbors as ourselves, for instance, even if we do not actively harm\nthem. Sinful actions are, in short, actions that fail to live up to\nthe will or commands of God (see Stump 2018). \nMany sinful actions will be deliberately chosen or intentional. In\nfact, it is common in some parts of the Christian tradition to take\n“sin properly so called” to be a willful transgression of\na known law of God. Ruth Groenhout, for instance, describes sin as \nthe deliberate choice of a lesser good in preference to a greater,\nchosen in spite of and against the loving, creative, and wholly good\nwill of God. (Groenhout 2006: 135) \nGroenhout here is drawing on a tradition that goes back at least to\nAugustine, according to which sin necessarily involves inordinate\ndesire for a lesser good. Augustine held the privation view of sin,\naccording to which—insofar as evil is the absence of\ngood—sinful actions involve “not a desire for naturally\nevil things, but an abandonment of better things” (as quoted in\nMann 2001: 45; see also Augustine On Free Choice of the\nWill). \nWe sin, then, if we knowingly do that which we know we ought not, and\nif we knowingly do not do that which we know we ought. According to\nmany views, we also sin when we internally endorse a sinful action,\nwhether or not we carry through with that endorsement and perform the\naction. These views often appeal to the following passage from the\nSermon on the Mount: \nYou have heard that it was said to those of ancient times, “You\nshall not murder”; and “whoever murders shall be liable to\njudgment”. But I say to you that if you are angry with a brother\nor sister, you will be liable to judgment.…You have heard that\nit was said, “You shall not commit adultery”. But I say to\nyou that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed\nadultery with her in his heart. (Matthew 5:21–22 and\n27–28, New Revised Standard Version) \nOn some views, Christianity also countenances involuntary or\nunintentional sins, holding that some emotions and desires can be\nsinful even if they’re not directly under our voluntary control.\nAccording to Robert Adams, for instance, failing to take\nresponsibility for our emotions and motives is both self-alienating\nand blameworthy even when those emotions and motives are involuntary,\nalthough the appropriate response to involuntary sins differs from\nthat for voluntary sins and voluntariness can affect the degree of\nwrongness (R. Adams 1985). William Wainwright also defends the view\nthat we can sometimes be blameworthy for involuntary actions, broadly\nconstrued to include desires and beliefs (see Wainwright 1988:\n40). \nFurthermore, some philosophers think that there are sinful actions\nthat don’t violate any normative restrictions. Here, Richard\nSwinburne’s distinction between “objective” and\n“subjective” sins can be helpful. Objective sins occur\nwhen a person does what is objectively wrong, whether they realize\nthat it’s wrong or not. Subjective sins occur when a person does\nwhat they believe to be wrong, acting against their conception of the\ngood (Swinburne 1989: 124). On this differentiation, it’s\npossible for an action to be both objectively and subjectively sinful,\nobjectively but not subjectively sinful (as in the case of people who\nsin believing they are acting in the right), and subjectively but not\nobjectively sinful (as in the case of a person who acts against an\nerring conscience). According to Philip Quinn, \nTheists who believe that erring conscience binds will want to allow\nfor cases in which, on account of a mistaken belief about the moral\nwrongness of an action, a person does what is subjectively but not\nobjectively wrong and so sins subjectively but not objectively. (Quinn\n1986: 542; see also Stump 2003: 90) \nHowever, one could also think that what is sinful about\n“subjective sins” is that one is acting against\none’s conscience, and thus “objectively” sinning\ninsofar as one is not following one’s conscience, even when\none’s conscience is in error. Even on this interpretation,\nhowever, the class of sins is broader than “willful\ntransgressions of a known law of God”. \nMuch of the philosophical work engaging sinful actions in contemporary\nphilosophy of religion has been in connection with the problem of\nevil, understood as a family of related arguments that take among\ntheir premises facts about evil and seek to conclude either that God\n(understood as having a particular nature) does not exist or that it\nis irrational to believe that such a being exists. Sinful acts and\nmoral evil are often taken to be either co-extensive or nearly so (see\nHasker 2008: 160), and so versions of the problem of evil that focus\non the problem of moral evil also often talk about sin. The main\nthrust of most of the versions is that an all-powerful, all-knowing,\nall-good God would not allow human beings to perpetuate or suffer\nhorrendous evils. Because human beings do both perpetuate and suffer\nhorrendous evils, either God must not be all-powerful, all-knowing,\nand/or all-good, or God must not exist. The question of sin is not,\nhowever, limited to discussions of the logical problem of moral evil;\nit also comes up in discussions of evidential versions of the problem\nof evil and even the problem of natural evils (see, for instance,\nSwinburne 2009 and 1978); van Inwagen 2006: lecture 7; and\nO’Connor 1991). \nOne of the most famous responses to this version of the problem of\nevil is what Alvin Plantinga has termed “The Free Will\nDefense”. According to this response, God’s creating human\nbeings with free will (and refraining from tampering with the freedom\nof that will) makes the existence of moral evils/sinful actions at\nleast possible – and perhaps even likely: \nFor any free creature God creates, this falling into sin is clearly a\npossibility; God can’t create significantly free creatures\n[i.e., a person who is free with respect to a morally significant\naction it would be morally wrong for them to perform and morally right\nto refrain from, or vice versa] who cannot fall into sin. And perhaps\na high probability of such a fall attaches to free creatures\n(creatures with an area of autonomy) who are created in the image of\nGod. God sets out to create beings in his own image: they resemble him\nin having will and intellect, and they recognize the lustrous beauty,\nglory, and desirability of God’s position. God is himself the\ncenter of the universe; his creatures see the splendor and wonderful\ndesirability of that condition. Perhaps, insofar as one is free, and\nsees both the glory of this position and its enormous desirability,\nthere is a powerful tendency to desire it for oneself. Perhaps there\nis a high probability that beings created in the image of God will\nalso wind up resembling him in this: that they want to see and do see\nthemselves as the center of the universe. Perhaps a substantial\nprobability of falling into this condition is built into the very\nnature of free creatures who have knowledge of God’s glorious\nstatus and do see it as indeed glorious and desirable. (Plantinga\n2000: 212f; see also Plantinga 1974, Plantinga 1977, and M. Adams\n1999) \nAs this argument makes clear, one’s view about the nature of\nsinful act will be closely related to one’s view about the\nnature of human freedom (see McFadyen 2016, Timpe 2014a, and\nCouenhoven 2013). Plantinga here assumes a libertarian, and hence\nincompatibilist, understanding of free will. While all Christian views\nhave to explain how God is not complicit in sin given the doctrines of\nconservation and concurrence (Kvanvig 2009; Vander Laan 2017; and\nMcCall 2019: chapter 7), the question of God’s relation to\nsinful human acts is especially pressing for compatibilist views,\nwhich hold that God could have caused human agents to never freely\nsin, and theological determinist views, which hold that God causes all\nevents (see McCall 2019: chapter 3; Bignon 2018: part 2; White 2016;\nBruce 2016; McCall 2016; Rogers 2008; McCann 2005; and Crisp 2005,\nparticularly chapter 3). \nAccount of the nature of sinful acts are closely related to accounts\nof the theological need for forgiveness, redemption, and atonement.\nWhile some philosophers claim that the correct understanding of these\ndoctrines comes as a package (see Copan 2003: 525f), there is\nsignificant disagreement about how best to understand them, both\nindividually and in relation to each other. (There is, for instance, a\nwide range of views about how best to understand the atonement; see,\namong others, Stump 2018, S. Porter 2004, Swinburne 1989 and 1988,\nLewis 1997, and Quinn 1986. For a discussion directly of how sin\nrelates to atonement, see Crisp 2009.) \nAmong individual acts of sin, special importance attaches to the\ntemporally first sin, which is referred to as the “primal\nsin”. (Most take this to be the temporally first sin regardless\nof whether it was committed by an angelic or human being, although\nsome take it to be the first human sin committed.) Scott MacDonald\ndescribes the primal sin as follows: \nThe fall of the angels constitutes the paradigm case [of\nevil-originating free choice] since, unlike Adam’s and\nEve’s sin in the garden, the first angelic sin is entirely\nunprecedented. We can think of that first evil free choice as\nconstituting primal sin. The first sin deserves to be called primal,\nhowever, not just because it is temporally first but also because it\nis something radically new in creation: the first evil appears against\na backdrop of utter goodness. All things created by God, including the\nrational creatures whose free choices are the original evils, are\nwholly good and without flaw.…There can be no context of defect\nor corruption into which the first sin fits. Good creatures with good\nwills voluntarily introduce evil into a world where there was none\nbefore. Primal sin is not only unprecedented but also seemingly\nunprepared for and unprompted. (MacDonald 1998: 110–1; see also\nRogers 2008 and Couenhoven 2013: chapter 1) \nThe very notion of a primal sin implies that there was a time when\ncreation was without sin. While a temporally first sin would seem to\nbe required by a finite past, discussions of the primal sin often\npresuppose that there was a time of perfect creation prior to a fall,\nwhich is more contentious. As Craig A. Boyd argues, given that it\nconflicts with contemporary science, \nthe claim that creation was originally perfect in every\nrespect—the idea that an idyllic paradise existed without death,\ndisease, poison or weeds before the first human [or angelic]\nsin—is especially problematic. (Boyd 2009: 111) \nBut one need not take the story of the fall literally to think that\nthere was a primal sin. (For a discussion of the historicity of the\nfall as it relates to sin, see McLeod-Harrison 2019; Smith 2017; and\nMcCall 2019, appendix.) Even if one rejects the notion of a historical\nfall, Christianity nevertheless traditionally holds that all that God\ncreates is good. But if both humans and angels are created good, how\nis it that at least some of them do evil? (This is what John Hick\nrefers to as the problem of the “origin of evil ex\nnihilo”; see Hick 1968: 595.) The answer to this question,\nof course, is that an agent does evil because it wills to do\nevil. But this answer immediately raises another question: where does\nwill for evil originate in free agents? This question is especially\npressing given that many Christian traditions have held that free\nagents were created able both to sin and to refrain from sinning, a\nstate sometimes called the status integritatis. While a\ncreature’s having free will in the status integritatis\nmight account for the possibility of evil, it isn’t sufficient\nto explain why that possibility was actualized by an otherwise morally\nuntarnished creature. The primal sin can thus be seen as a specific\ninstance of what Peter Kivy calls “the secular problem of\nevil”: “cases of evil [action] in which the perpetrator\nappears to pursue no real or apparent good” (Kivy 1980). One\nmight say that the initial choice to sin involved a perceived good,\nperhaps the assertion of one’s own independence from God in an\nact of pride, self-love, or envy. What is perplexing is how that sin\ncould come about in a non-sinful being—why is it that a\nnon-sinful agent would wrongly but culpably conceive of such as act as\ngood? How could a non-sinful agent be drawn to a sinful action in the\nfirst place? \nIn general, two different approaches to explaining the primal sin have\nbeen offered. Because the philosophical work on the primal sin is\nconducted largely in dialogue with medieval figures, drawing on a\ncomplex moral psychology in which the faculties of the intellect and\nwill play an essential role, I also discuss these two approaches in\nthose terms. Put simply, there can be no sin without the involvement\nof the intellect and will (see McCluskey 2017: 21 and 100); the\ndifference between the two approaches is whether they locate that sin\nprimarily in the will or in the intellect. Voluntarists, on the one\nhand, hold that human beings act freely primarily in virtue of the\nfaculty of the will, and thus explain the primal sin primarily in the\nmisuse of that faculty. (Robert Brown notes that in the history of\nChristian theology, voluntarism is the dominant view; see Brown 1978).\nIntellectualism, on the other hand, holds that human beings act freely\nprimarily in virtue of the role of the intellect, and thus that the\nprimal sin must be explained primarily in intellectual terms. \nIn what follows, I focus on two of the most developed extant accounts\nof primal sin in the contemporary literature: Katherin Rogers’s\naccount of Anselm’s voluntarist view and Scott MacDonald’s\naccount of Augustine’s intellectualism. Leaving aside the\nquestion of whether Rogers’s and MacDonald’s\ninterpretations of their historical subjects are accurate, both of\nthese interpretations present libertarian accounts insofar as they\npresuppose that the truth of theological determinism would render the\ndevil unfree, and thus not responsible, in his fall. (It is worth\nnoting that while Anselm is widely regarded as a libertarian [see\nVisser & Williams 2008 and Rogers 2008], there is disagreement\nabout how best to interpret Augustine’s view of free will\n[compare Stump 2001 and Couenhoven 2017].) \nOn Rogers’s account, Anselm holds that a free will involves two\ninclinations (or affectiones): the desire for benefit and the\ndesire for justice. The desire for benefit is the desire for things\nthe possession of which one thinks will lead to their happiness. The\ndesire for justice, in contrast, is \na desire for “rightness of will preserved for its own\nsake”. It is therefore a second order desire that one’s\nfirst order desires should be properly ordered, should be as they\nought to be. (Rogers 2008: 67) \nAnselm doesn’t think anyone wills injustice, or any other sin,\nfor its own sake; rather, they will it under the description of\nsomething beneficial. Why would one choose the lower good of benefit\nover the higher good of justice? Anselm’s answer cannot be\n“ignorance” but simply “because that is how the\nagent formed their volition”. Is such a choice explicable?\nAccording to Rogers, in one sense it isn’t: \n“But why did he will what he ought not?” asks the student.\n“No cause preceded this will, unless it was that he was able to\nwill”. But this ability per se is not really the cause, since\nthe good angels were equally able to desert justice. “Why then\ndid he will?” ’The teacher responds, “Only because\nhe willed. For this choice had no other cause by which it was by any\nmeans impelled or drawn, but it was its own efficient cause, and\neffect, if such a thing can be said”. Here we have\nlibertarianism of the self-causation variety stated with brutal\nclarity and with no attempt to downplay its core problem.…\nAnselm does not go on and try to mitigate the problem of\nintelligibility. (Rogers 2008: 97) \nOn this sort of view, any attempt to fully understand the primal sin\nfalls short and must ultimately remain \nmysterious and irrational. Those who were made to love God should not\nhave found the prospect of defying God attractive, and pride should\nnot have come naturally to them. (Couenhoven 2016: 189) \nOn MacDonald’s interpretation of Augustine, by contrast, the\nprimal sin involves the agent’s will, but that act of will is\npreceded by an act of the intellect. As MacDonald describes the\nsituation: \nWhat could primal sinners have done to guard against sinning? I think\nthe answer must be that they failed to pay attention to the reason\nthey had for loving God above all things, namely, their knowledge that\nGod is the highest good.… Had they attended to the reasons they\npossessed, they would have seen that rationality required them to love\nGod above all things.… Primal sinners, then, must have made\ntheir evil choices in some sense without thinking, without\ndeliberating sufficiently, without taking account of relevant\ninformation that was nevertheless in their possession. (MacDonald\n1998: 120–1) \nIn other words, the intellect’s failing to properly grasp or\nweigh the normative reasons in the first place is the primary cause of\nthe primal sin. The will’s volition in the primal sin thus\nisn’t a will to act contrary to what the agent knows ought not\nbe done, but results rather from ignorance or failure to give the\nright reasons the right weight (for more, see Timpe 2014a: chapter\n3). \nAquinas’s intellectualism builds on but differs from\nAugustine’s (see Stump 2001). Jonathan Edwards appears to have a\ndifferent sort of intellectualist account. On Edwards’s view,\nthe will must follow its strongest motivation (Crisp 2005: 41), which\nis an output of the intellect. And more recently, Alvin Plantinga also\nendorses an intellectualist account. He suggests that while primal sin\ninvolves both affective and intellectual elements, it must originate\nwith “an intellectual defect; it must be by way of\nsomehow acquiring a false belief” (Plantinga 2000: 211). In\nother words, there must be a “prior intellectual fault”\n(Plantinga 2000: 212) before any affective failure. \nAs mentioned above, acts of sin relate closely to those versions of\nthe problem of evil that focus on moral evils, where one tries to\nexplain free creatures doing what is wrong. It is common in these\ndiscussions to differentiate a defense from a theodicy. Alvin\nPlantinga describes a theodicy as “the attempt to specify\nGod’s reason for permitting evil”, while a defense is the\nattempt to specify not what God’s reason is but what it\n“might possibly be” (Plantinga 1977: 27f; see\nalso van Inwagen 2006). Versions of free will theodicy argue that the\nexistence of free will is the good that justifies God’s\npermitting evil, while free will defenses argue that the existence of\nfree will might be such a reason. Both free will theodicies\nand defenses typically presuppose libertarian understandings of free\nwill, and thus the possibility of moral evil, although they need not\n(see, for instance, Almeida 2016 and Turner 2013). Given the focus\nhere on sin, one particular response to the problem of moral evil is\nworth extended attention: a response known as “O Felix\nCulpa”, according to which God not only allows but even\ndesires evil insofar as it furthers his plans. \nWhile John Hick (1966) and Paul Helm (1994) both discuss O Felix\nCulpa theodicies, Alvin Plantinga’s work has been\nespecially influential in contemporary philosophical discussions, and\nso I will focus on Plantinga. In earlier work (see Plantinga 1977 and\n1985), Plantinga was interested in only giving a defense, explicitly\nrejecting theodicies. In fact, at one point he claimed that \nmost attempts to explain why God permits evil—theodicies, as we\nmay call them—strike me as tepid, shallow, and ultimately\nfrivolous. (Plantinga 1985: 35) \nHis later 2000 Warrant and Christian Belief is an extended\nresponse to defeaters to Christian belief, but it also contains the\nelements of his later O Felix Culpa theodicy. As Kevin Diller\ncomments, \nthis argument is a new species from Plantinga in the genus of\nresponses to the problem of evil. This is a theodicy, not merely a\ndefense, not merely a defeater defeater, but an explanation for why\nGod allows evil—a reason for evil, that does not remove all the\nperplexity, but at a general level gives us an understanding for why\nit exists. (Diller 2008: 90) \nHe continues: \nUnlike a free will theodicy, in a [O] Felix Culpa\ntheodicy God desires evil [perhaps not for its own sake but]\nas a means to his good purposes. This move has a dangerously\ndistorting moral and theological impact. We can no longer condemn evil\nand injustice as wholly antithetical to what is good. Evil is\nultimately the will of God…. In a free will theodicy it is the\npermission of evil that is essential to the greater good that\nGod intends, in the Felix Culpa theodicy it is the evil\nitself that is essential to the greater good. Evil is made\nreasonable as a functional good. (Diller 2008: 96) \nOn this view, \nthere is also a contingent good-making characteristic of our\nworld—one that isn’t present in all worlds—that\ntowers enormously above all the rest of the contingent states of\naffairs included in our world: the unthinkably great good of divine\nincarnation and atonement. (Plantinga 2004: 7) \nGiven his other commitments, including what Marilyn McCord Adams calls\nthe “swamping effect” of God’s goodness (M. Adams\n2008: 126), Plantinga thinks that every possible world is a very good\nworld. God’s existence is not only necessary but also infinitely\ngood, God’s existence outweighs any evil, and every possible\nworld is thus one that is infinitely good. But not all infinities are\nequal. In some worlds, there are additional goods that outweigh the\nevil of sin, namely the goods of incarnation and atonement. Since the\nincarnation and atonement, on Plantinga’s view, follow only\nafter sin, which is contingent, the (infinite) good of the incarnation\nand atonement is also contingent. God’s willing the incarnation\nand atonement is logically prior to God’s decisions to permit\nsin, and thus sin becomes the means to that justifying good. Such a\nposition is called “supralapsarianism”. The way Plantinga\nunderstands the supralapsarianism, \nthe [divine] decree to save [at least] some of the fallen [via the\nincarnation and atonement] precedes the decree to permit sin.\n(Plantinga 2004: 1) \n(Diller objects to Plantinga characterizing the\nsupralapsarian/infralapsarian debate in this way; see Diller 2008:\n94). \nPlantinga gives three different versions of the argument, each based\non a different assumption about value. Since Plantinga endorses the\nstrongest of these, which Hud Hudson calls “the Strong Value\nAssumption” (Hudson 2019: 269), I’ll focus on this\nversion. (It’s worth noting that Plantinga thinks that only the\nweakest of the three value assumptions is needed for the O Felix\nCulpa theodicy, although Hudson 2019 argues otherwise.) The\nStrong Value Assumption is as follows: \nAny world with incarnation and atonement is a better world than any\nwithout it—or at any rate better than any world in which God\ndoes nothing comparable to incarnation and atonement. (Plantinga 2004:\n1) \nMore fully: \nNo matter how much sin and suffering and evil [world] W\ncontains, it is vastly outweighed by the goodness of God, so that\nW is a good world, and indeed a very good world. It follows,\nonce more, that every possible world is a very good world. But that\ndoesn’t mean that none are more valuable than others. The fact\nis: some possible worlds are much better than others. For there is a\nfeature to be found only in some and not all possible worlds. This is\nthe towering and magnificent good of divine incarnation and\natonement.…No matter how much evil, how much sin and suffering\na world contains, the aggregated badness would be outweighed by the\ngoodness of incarnation and atonement, outweighed in such a way that\nthe world in question is very good. In this sense, therefore, any\nworld with incarnation and atonement is of infinite value by virtue of\ncontaining two goods of infinite value: the existence of God, and\nincarnation and atonement. (Plantinga 2004: 9f) \nPlantinga thinks that since all possible worlds containing the goods\nof incarnation and atonement also contain moral evil, the introduction\nof sin into the world is justified by those goods. (For concerns about\nhow Plantinga’s O Felix Culpa theodicy might conflict\nwith his defense to the logical problem of evil, see Davis &\nFranks 2018 and M. Adams 2008.) \nThere are a number of objections to Plantinga’s O Felix\nCulpa theodicy. The first involves Plantinga’s treating the\nincarnation and atonement together as a package contained in all the\nbest worlds. While he considers the possibility that there may be\nother worlds not involving incarnation and atonement that are equally\ngood, he says that it’s hard to imagine those worlds and\nsuggests we ignore them. But there are reasons to think that the set\nof worlds containing the incarnation and the set of worlds containing\nthe atonement are not identical. Marilyn McCord Adams, for instance,\nwrites, \nIn fact, as the great medieval theologians recognized, Incarnation and\natonement are logically independent: all agreed, it would have been\nmetaphysically or logically possible for God to become Incarnate, even\nif creatures had never sinned; and Incarnation without atonement would\nstill have been cosmic excellence enhancing. (M. Adams 2008: 131) \nAnselm seems to have thought that God couldn’t have reconciled\nwith us in any other way, thereby making the incarnation not only\nfitting (Cur Deus Homo I.1, in Anselm BW; see also the\ndiscussions in Flint 2009 and M. Adams 2004) but also conditionally\nnecessary on human sinfulness (Cur Deus Homo II.6–7, in\nAnselm BW; see also Williams forthcoming). But numerous other\ntheologians after him in the medieval period thought he was just wrong\nabout this, including Alexander of Hale, Bonaventure, and Aquinas.\nBonaventure, for instance, believes that the ability of God to bring\nabout the atonement without becoming incarnate follows from divine\npower. And according to Thomas Williams, the non-necessity of the\nincarnation for atonement was “the dominant medieval view”\n(Williams forthcoming). \nThe incarnation and the atonement can come apart in the other\ndirection as well: God could have become incarnate even in the absence\nof sin. Scholastic philosopher and theologian Robert Grosseteste lists\nno fewer than nineteen reasons why God might have become incarnate\neven without sin (see M. Adams 2004: 143). Aquinas held (Summa\ntheologiae III.1.3) that while God could have become\nincarnate even had there been no sin, God would not have chosen to do\nso. (It’s worth noting that other notable theologians, such as\nAugustine and Pope Leo, disagreed; see M. Adams 2004: 147). Duns\nScotus also thought sin wasn’t required for God’s decision\nto become incarnate. \nAs Kevin Diller understands Plantinga’s O Felix Culpa\ntheodicy, the incarnation and atonement play different roles: \nSuffering is not just a necessary byproduct of the plan to effectuate\nincarnation and atonement, but it also allows us to have a kind of\nintimacy and solidarity with Christ that would not otherwise have been\npossible. (Diller 2008: 90) \nDiller argues that intimacy and solidarity are made possible by the\nincarnation. But these goods could be achieved even without sin and\nthe need for atonement: \nthe incarnation alone does not require suffering and evil, so neither\nthen is evil required for enhancing the intimacy of human relationship\nwith God. If it is not an enhancement in our relationship with God\nthat necessitates evil, then Plantinga’s argument stands solely\non the first claim: that the value of the atonement, which outweighs\nthe required evil and suffering, is its being an, otherwise\nimpossible, towering display of God’s love. (Diller 2008:\n96) \nFor his theodicy to work, Plantinga would need to argue that it is the\ngood of the atonement in particular that assures the relevant\ngoodness, thereby revising the Strong Value Assumption to\nsomething like \nany world with atonement is a better world than any without\nit—or at any rate better than any world in which God does\nnothing comparable to atonement \n(see also Hudson 2019: 282). \nFurthermore, regarding the value of the atonement, Diller suggests\nthat it is not the actual atonement that is required for the good, but\nrather God’s disposition or willingness to engage in the\natonement: \nEven in worlds without sin—if such worlds are indeed\npossible—the counterfactuals of God’s love are the same.\nPerhaps Plantinga’s view is not that there would be anything\nlacking in God’s love for us without atonement, but that there\nwould be something lacking in our perception of that love. It is\nreasonable to think that it is part of God’s loving purposes\nthat the beloved would understand how loved they are. The argument, in\nthis case, would be that the enactment of God’s love in\nredemption gives us a view of the nature of that love which we would\nnot otherwise have had. But how could we know what God’s\nlimitations are with respect to communicating to us a knowledge of the\ndepth of his love? The weight of the theodicy rests on this\nassumption, but we are not given a good reason to accept it. (Diller\n2008: 92; citations omitted) \nMarilyn McCord Adams rejects the entire framework of the instrumental\nvalue of evils that the O Felix Culpa theodicy assumes. For\nher, “horrors” are defined as \nevils the participation in (the doing or suffering of) which\nconstitutes prima facie reason to doubt whether the\nparticipant’s life could (given their inclusion in it) have\npositive meaning for him/her on the whole. (M. Adams 2006: 32) \nShe elaborates elsewhere: \nMy own conclusion is that means/end connections between greater goods\nand the worst evils (the ones I have identified as horrors) do not\nhelp the project of Christian theodicy. There need to be meaningful\nconnections of another kind. Where horrors are concerned, it\nwon’t be enough to suggest—as Plantinga does—that\nthe greater good outweighs the evil either. For precisely because\nhorrors threaten to take away the possibility of positive personal\nmeaning, they require recontextualizing to confer some positive\nmeaning upon them. (M. Adams 2008: 137) \nHorrors, in Adams’ view, need to be defeated rather than simply\nbalanced out or outweighed. And defeat must happen in the life of the\nperson who has suffered or perpetrated the horror, not someone else;\nthat is, we must restrict defeat to the agent involved in the horror.\nWithout this agent-centered restriction, it isn’t possible for\nPlantinga to argue that \nnot only are perfect love and mercy compatible with requiring the\nsuffering of a person for ends that are unconnected to her own good\nbut that these traits are also compatible with that suffering extended\nto being wrecked and ruined, damnable and (maybe in some cases)\ndamned. (Hudson 2019: 283) \nDiller picks up the same thread: \nFor Plantinga’s theodicy to be successful, he must hold that a\nworld including all of the same people would be better off with a fall\nthan without a fall, even though it could not be better for those who\nsuffer eternally broken relationship with God. The good of having\nparticipated in making the world a better place would not individually\noffset the quite personal cost of entering hell or even being\nannihilated. Barring a commitment to universalism, it seems once\nagain, from this angle, that on the Felix Culpa view the value of the\nextravagance of God’s sacrifice is made to be more valuable than\nthe right relationship with God that the sacrifice is meant to\nrestore. (Diller 2008: 94) \nMcCord Adams argues that it is actually worse than Diller thinks.\nPlantinga doesn’t clearly endorse the double predestination that\nis sometimes paired with supralapsarianism. But, given his rejection\nof universalism, God does knowingly choose to create some free\ncreatures who will be damned: \nPlantinga’s “Felix Culpa” Supralapsarianism has God\ndecide on what careers incompatibilist free creatures will have prior\nin the order of explanation to their existence. Once again, for\nPlantinga, incompatibilist free creatures, considered as merely\npossible, are not “truth-makers” for the counterfactuals\nof freedom about them. (M. Adams 2008: 134) \nThe culprit here is actually Plantinga’s Molinism, however, not\nnecessarily the O Felix Culpa. (For concerns about Molinism\non this point, see Perszyk 2011a: 8f; Wierenga 2011: 131–135;\nand Timpe 2018. For a rejection of this concern, see Merricks 2011:\n66). \nWilliam Hasker thinks that the most serious objection to\nPlantinga’s O Felix Culpa theodicy is that \nGod in this theodicy is using his creatures, treating them as\nmeans and not as ends in themselves, by placing them in great peril in\norder to get the glory of saving them. (Hasker 2008: 168f) \nBut that glory might not even be for saving those individuals that\nsin, since Plantinga thinks that not all who sin are saved. This\nbenefit of the atonement might extend only to some of those who\nsuffer, again raising Adam’s agent-centered constraint. As\nHasker notes, God’s using or instrumentalizing people in this\nway for the sake of some other good seems to run afoul of Romans 3:8,\nwhich explicitly rejects the thinking that we should do evil\n“that good may come”. \nFinally, Hud Hudson raises another objection to Plantinga’s\ntheodicy that he thinks is decisive as an objection to theodicy in\ngeneral. Plantinga writes that \nany world with incarnation and atonement is better than any world with\nit—or at any rate better than any world in which God does\nnothing comparable to incarnation and atonement. It is hard to imagine\nwhat God could do that is in fact comparable to incarnation and\natonement; but perhaps this is just a limitation of our imagination.\nBut since this is so hard to imagine, I propose that we ignore those\npossible worlds, if there are any, in which God does not arrange for\nincarnation and atonement, but does something else of comparable\nexcellence. (Plantinga 2004: 10) \nHudson thinks this line of argument fails because it’s a\n“simple and straightforward noseeum inference” where\nabsence of evidence doesn’t amount to evidence of absence\n(Hudson 2019: 285). And Hudson thinks we have no reason to endorse\nsuch an inference in this case. (For another criticism of Plantinga on\nthis point, see also Hasker 2008.) \nIn addition to being a category of action, sin can also be understood\nas an inclination or disposition to engage in sinful action. As\nPlantinga puts in, \nsin is also and perhaps primarily an affective disorder or\nmalfunction. Our affections are skewed, directed to the wrong objects;\nwe love and hate the wrong things. Instead of seeking first the\nkingdom of God, I am inclined to seek first my own personal\nglorification and aggrandizement, bending all of my efforts toward\nmaking myself look good. Instead of loving God above all and my\nneighbor as myself, I am inclined to love myself above all and,\nindeed, to hate God and my neighbor. (Plantinga 2000: 208) \nThe relation between sinful acts and sinful dispositions is complex.\nHaving a sinful disposition can certainly make it easier to commit a\nparticular kind of sin (e.g., being gluttonous makes it easier for me\nto drink another coffee beyond what I should), but a sinful\ndisposition is neither necessary nor sufficient for committing a\nsinful act. It can’t be necessary, given that the primal sin\nisn’t explained by the presence of a sinful disposition. And it\ncan’t be sufficient, since we don’t do all the sinful\nactions that a vice disposes us towards. \nAs is also the case for examining individual acts of sin, a full\naccount of sinful dispositions will depend on one’s larger\nnormative framework. Sinful dispositions understood as inclinations\ntowards certain kinds of sinful acts can be understood as disordered\ndispositions to not follow the natural law or divine comments, or\nwithin the framework of a Kantian-inspired deontological account. It\nis, however, perhaps most natural to think of such dispositions within\nthe general normative framework of virtue ethics as vices (J. Porter\n1997: 466; McCluskey 2017: 7). The vices, on this approach, are habits\nof the soul that are contrary to individuals’ flourishing and\nare opposed to, or involve the privation of, a particular virtue.\nAccording to Colleen McCluskey (2017), Thomas Aquinas holds that only\nactions can be sinful, strictly speaking, while vices are bad habits\nwithout those dispositions being themselves sinful. There is long\ntradition within Christianity, however, of treating sin in terms of\ndispositions as well as actions. Today, in part because of the\ninfluence of ethicists such as Anscombe, Foot, Murdoch and MacIntyre,\nmany contemporary Christian philosophers and theologians draw on the\nmedieval virtue ethics tradition and its portrayal of vices as sinful\ndispositions. \nMuch of the relevant work on sinful dispositions focuses either on\nparticular categories of vice (e.g., vices opposed to the cardinal\nvirtues, or the seven capital vices) or on individual vices. (For\nexamples, see DeYoung 2020, Sweeney 2018, and McCluskey 2017.) As\nRebecca DeYoung notes, a common Christian response to vice is to\nconcentrate on sanctification, which is the change or transformation\nof character required to remove sinful dispositions (DeYoung 2020:\nviii; for different models of the nature of sanctification, see Alston\n1988, S. Porter & Rickabaugh 2018, and Yeo 2014.) Sanctification\nimportantly includes spiritual disciplines in the process of virtue\nformation (see DeYoung 2020 and Smith 2016). \nIn addition to thinking of sin in terms of action and/or dispositions,\nparts of the Christian tradition also think of sin as in terms of an\nontological state. Marilyn McCord Adams, for instance, thinks of sin,\nat its most basic level, as ontological “uncleanness”. On\nthis view, sin is fundamentally an \nimpropriety in the relation between God and created person.…\nSin is uncleanness arising from the incommensuration of Divine and\ncreated natures, in the incapacity of any finite being to do or to be\nanything, naturally or intrinsically, worthy of God. (M. Adams 1991:\n20f) \nThis incommensuration is \na metaphysically necessary consequence of what God and creatures are,\nnot the outcome of the free and contingent exercise of anyone’s\nagency. (M. Adams 1991: 21) \nElsewhere, McCord Adams describes it as an outgrowth of “the\nmetaphysical gap” between humans and God, in virtue of\ndifferences in their natures: \nWe have no more rightful place in God’s household than worms and\nmaggots do in our ours (Job 24:4–6); nothing we could naturally\nbe or do would make us suitable for Divine company. Because Divine and\ncreated natures are incommensurate, God will be unclassifiable\nrelative to any merely human order (social, political, international)\nor to any human perception of natural order. Since we are unable to\nfit Him into any of our categories, we experience God as …\nwholly other, and therefore as utterly unpredictable. (M. Adams 1999:\n94) \nThis state of uncleanness, on her view, isn’t a result of sinful\nactions but is instead simply a function of the radical limitation and\nfinitude of created natures in comparison with God. \nBecause of the size gap nothing we could be or do could\ncount—simply by virtue of what it is—as an appropriate\nmove in relation to God. (M. Adams 1999: 95) \nBecause sin is primarily a function of our created state rather than a\nresult of human actions, this view doesn’t portray human freedom\nor forgiveness as playing a key role overcoming the state of sin.\nRather, the gap is straddled by covenant and, ultimately,\nincarnation. \nThe Christian doctrine of original sin can also be understood as a\nkind of state or “condition” (see Mann 2001: 47). While,\nas discussed in\n section 2.1,\n primal sin refers to the temporally first sin, original sin is\noriginal in the sense that “it is an evil at the origins of\nhuman agency, and from which human agency flows” (Couenhoven\n2016: 193). Original sin is sometimes referred to as human beings\npossessing a “sinful nature”. This view leads to certain\nChristological worries, however: if the Second Person of the Trinity\nbecomes incarnate and assumes a human nature, then if human nature is\nsomehow itself sinful, Christ would also be sinful. But all Christian\ntheories hold that the Incarnate Christ is fully human as well as\nfully divine, and yet without original sin. (For discussions of the\nrelationship between Christ’s divine nature and the human nature\nassumed in the Incarnation, see Pawl 2019 and 2016). Some Christian\ntraditions also hold that Mary the mother of Jesus also was free from\nsin via the immaculate conception. Because such language about human\nnature itself becoming sinful can be misleading (see Copan 2003: 523)\nand also potentially in conflict with the conviction that all things\ncreated by God are good, original sin is perhaps better described in\nterms of human nature’s being distorted. In virtue of its\ndistorting effects, original sin thus “becomes the origin of\nactual sins” (Blocher 1997: 19), and perhaps even a condition\nthat almost inevitably leads to sinful actions (see Franks 2012:\n3). \nWhile the doctrine of original sin isn’t explicitly taught in\nthe Christian scriptures, it “was developed from scriptural\nwarrants” (Green 2017: 115). It also is a distinctively\nChristian doctrine (Quinn 1997: 541), rejected by both Judaism and\nIslam. Augustine played a central role in the historical development\nof the doctrine of original sin. In contrast to Pelagius and\nCaelestius who denied that humans inherit original sin via the fall\n(see Timpe 2014a: chapter 4 and Couenhoven 2013), Augustine maintained\nthat through Adam’s sin, the whole human race is now \nbound by the chain of death and justly condemned, …lead by a\nsuccession of miseries from its depraved origin, as from a corrupt\nroot. (Augustine City of God, XIII.14) \nAugustine’s view in this debate was codified by the Councils of\nCarthage (418) and Orange (529), with Pelagius’ view being\ndeclared heresy in the West, and thus the components of this view\ndeserves a closer look. (For a discussion of the history of the\ndoctrine, see Vanneste 1971.) \nIn what follows, I will follow Jesse Couenhoven, who argues that\nAugustine’s doctrine of original sin has five parts and\ndistinguishes between them as follows: \nOf these, (1) has already been dealt with above in\n section 2.1.\n (2) is a claim about the scope of those who are affected by original\nsin, and in what follows I will assume the restriction that excludes\nJesus and, in Catholicism and parts of the Orthodox tradition, his\nmother Mary. I address claims (3) and (4) respectively in\n section 4.3\n and\n section 4.4.\n Other than noting that there are a range of options regarding how\noriginal sin (which is sometimes referred to as hereditary sin, or\nerbsünde in Germanic languages) is transmitted, ranging\nfrom Augustine’s view that this transmission occurs via semen as\npart of sexual intercourse to its occurring through participation in\nsinful human community (see Couenhoven 2013: chapter 7), I will not\nfocus on claim (5) either in what follows. \nCouenhoven describes the third component of the doctrine of original\nsin as its conceptual center, with the other parts of the doctrine\nproviding “a background that assists us in understanding the\ncenter of the doctrine” (Couenhoven 2013: 47). This third\ncomponent is itself the conjunction of two claims: the first being\nabout constitutional fault, which Couenhoven also sometimes calls\n“original sin itself” (Couenhoven 2013: 23), and the\nsecond being that one is morally blameworthy or suffers from original\nguilt in virtue of that constitutional fault. While Couenhoven may be\ncorrect that much of the historical reflection on original sin\ninvolves both of these elements, the second of these claims is\ncontroversial in contemporary philosophical work on original sin. \nCouenhoven describes constitutional fault as a kind of moral\n“improper functioning qua human being”\n(Couenhoven 2013: 12) that involves “an inherited state of\ndisordered desire and ignorance” (Couenhoven 2013: 30). This\nelement has also been described as a disordering of human desires such\nthat they “are now congenitally turned away from God” and\nin bondage to sin (McFarland 2016: 308). There are two main ways of\nunderstanding the distortion or corruption involved in constitutional\nfault. The first is as a loss of original righteousness or “a\ndeprivation of original holiness and justice” (Catechism of\nthe Catholic Church 2003, part I, section 2, paragraph 7, 405).\nThe second is as an actual perversion of the moral nature of humanity\n(see McCall 2019: 159). \nOriginal guilt, on the other hand, is defended by very few\nphilosophers, although William Wainwright suggests that original guilt\nis essential to the doctrine of original sin (Wainright 1988: 31).\nThomas McCall refers to those views that reject original guilt as\n“corruption-only doctrines” (McCall 2019: 156). The denial\nof original guilt is found in the Catholic tradition (see\nCatechism of the Catholic Church 2003, part I, section 2,\nparagraph 7, 405) and many of the Orthodox traditions (see Louth\n2020). Among contemporary philosophers, corruption-only views are\nendorsed by Crisp 2020a, McFarland 2016, McFadyen 2016, Hudson 2014,\nWyma 2004, Plantinga 2000, Quinn 1997, Morris 1992, and Swinburne\n1989. \nAccording to Michael C. Rea (2007), much of the opposition to the idea\nof original guilt comes from its prima facie conflict with\nthe following “principle of possible prevention”: \nRea argues that no part of the doctrine of original sin, including\noriginal guilt, contradicts (MR). Rather, one gets a contradiction\nwhen the doctrine of original sin is conjoined with the following\nplausible assumption: \nRea then develops two different theories of original guilt that are\ninconsistent with (A1), one drawing on realism and perdurantism\n(roughly, the view that ordinary objects like humans persist through\ntime in virtue of having temporal parts) and the other drawing on\nMolinist assumptions. (For criticisms of Rea’s proposals, see\nHudson 2014: chapter 4.) \nClosely connected with the concept of constitutional fault is the idea\nof just punishment for that fault. According to those views which\nreject original guilt, we are justly punished only for our actual\nsinful actions and dispositions. For those views which affirm original\nguilt, a question arises concerning where this guilt comes from, given\nthat it doesn’t seem that the post-Adam person in question\ncommitted the sin to which the original guilt attaches. There are two\nmain families of views that seek to address this issue: federalism and\nrealism. According to federalism, which is sometimes also referred to\nas representationalism, we are held to be guilty for original sin and\nfor our constitutional fault in virtue of Adam (or Adam and Eve) being\nour “federal” or “representative” head. In\nshort, \nwe are condemned because Adam stood in for us as the representative of\nthe whole human race; due to his relationship to us as our\n“federal head” or “legally appointed\nrepresentative”, his guilt thus counts as our guilt. (McCall\n2019: 162) \nFederalism involves a “treating as if”, or a “legal\nfiction”, where guilt is imputed via taking Adam to be a\nrepresentative of the human race (see Madueme 2020; for a criticism of\nsuch imputation, see Crisp 2009). \nIn contrast, realism holds that there is a real unity between all who\nare justly punished for original guilt and Adam (or, again, Adam and\nEve). As Augustine puts it, \nThe first human beings … having become the first sinners, were\nthen punished by death in such a way that whatsoever sprang from their\nstock should also be subject to the same penalty. For nothing could be\nborn of them which was not what they themselves had been …so\nthat what arose as a punishment in the first human beings who sinned\nalso follows as a natural consequence in the rest who are born of\nthem. (Augustine City of God, XIII.iii) \nBecause of our common human nature, all humans have an organic unity\nin virtue of which the punishment for original sin is just (for a\ndiscussion and criticism, see Crisp 2020b). However, Augustine\n“never really explains how all did exist and act in Adam,\nleaving the matter rather mysterious” (Couenhoven 2013: 27). \nThe realist view perhaps best known is that of Jonathan Edwards, who\nheld that all humans are one simply because as God declares us to\nbe: \nthere is no identity or oneness [that does not] depend on the\narbitrary constitution of the Creator.… Divine\nconstitution [God’s treating all humans as one entity] is\nthe thing which makes truth. (Edwards 1758: part 4, ch. III\n[1970: 404]) \nInfluenced by Jonathan Edwards, a number of philosophers have\nsuggested that the theory of perdurantism might provide a basis for\nrealism. (See the discussions in Wainwright 1988, Wyma 2004, Crisp\n2005 and 2009, Rea 2007, and Hudson 2014.) \nEven the rejection of original guilt doesn’t solve all the\nconcerns related to the third component of the doctrine of original\nsin: constitutional fault also faces philosophical and theological\nchallenges. While some argue that constitutional fault merely inclines\none to commit sinful acts (see Swinburne 1989: 138), most have held\nthat acts of sin are inevitable given the state of original sin (Crisp\n2019: 150). As Paul Copan puts it, \nthough we do not sin necessarily (that is, it is not assured that we\nmust commit this or that particular sin), we sin inevitably (that is,\nin addition to our propensity to sin, given the vast array of\nopportunities to sin, we eventually do sin at some point. (Copan 2003:\n531) \nPaul Franks raises the following problem for views like Copan’s\n(and Plantinga’s and Wyma’s), which affirm the\ninevitability of sin without original guilt. On these views, the\nfollowing claim is true: \n(This claim would seem to entail that every world tainted by original\nsin includes sinners who give birth to other creatures capable of\nsinning. That looks to be false if there’s a world where the\nfirst sinners are annihilated immediately afterwards and new human\nbeings are created, but Franks doesn’t consider this\npossibility.) Now consider a possible world in which a human performs\nonly one morally significant action in their lifetime. This would mean\nthat: \nFranks thinks that the truth of (2) “seems assured” and\nfinds “no reason one could give for thinking it to be\nfalse” (Franks 2012: 7 and 11). However, according to (1a)\nabove, it is true of the human in question that they inevitably sin in\nthat particular action. That is, it follows from (1a) and (2) that \nHowever, from (1b) it follows that: \n(3) and (4) together entail a contradiction. \nOne way to reject (1b) is to accept a compatibilist view on which at\nleast some human free actions, namely those in which one sins, are\ndetermined by God. But those with libertarian commitments seem to be\ncommitted to (1b). Since Franks is a libertarian, he rejects that the\nconstitutional fault of original sin necessitates sinful actions:\n“we are influenced by a fallen world to sin, but are free at any\npoint to refrain from sinning” (Franks 2012: 370). As mentioned\nabove, Swinburne also rejects the inevitability of sin on the basis of\noriginal sin: \nAdam’s responsibility for our sinfulness is confined to a\nresponsibility for beginning the social transmission of morality (as\nsuch a good thing) which made sin possible, but a morality which, as a\nresult of his own sinful example and perhaps false moral beliefs, was\nno doubt a corrupt morality and so made it easier for our genetically\ninherited proneness to sin to work in Adam’s successors.\n(Swinburne 1989: 143) \nAccording to Swinburne, sinful acts are “almost\nunavoidable” but not inevitable. Those incompatibilists who want\nto hold that committing at least one sinful action is inevitable while\navoiding the inevitability (and thus non-responsibility) of each\nparticular sinful action need to provide an account of what ensures\nsinful action. \nThe depravity brought about by sin is held to affect all parts of\nhuman nature. In addition to sin as act, disposition, and fallen\nstate, Christian philosophers have also done significant work on the\nnoetic effects of sin, including but not limited specifically to its\nepistemic effects. The Reformed tradition in particular emphasizes the\neffects of sin not just on the will but on the human intellect. Alvin\nPlantinga, for instance, states that “Original sin involves both\nintellect and will; it is both cognitive and affective”\n(Plantinga 2000: 207). On Plantinga’s view, the affective\ndimension of sin—particularly the skewing of affections toward\nthe sin of pride—is perhaps “the deepest root of the condition\nof sin”, but a full accounting of sin must also include its\nimpact on our epistemic faculties: \nOne the one hand, [sin] carries with it a sort of blindness,\na sort of imperceptiveness, dullness, stupidity. This is a cognitive\nlimitation that first of all prevents its victim from proper knowledge\nof God and his beauty, glory, and love; it also prevents him from\nseeing what is worth loving and what worth hating, what should be\nsought and what eschewed. It therefore comprises both knowledge of\nfact and knowledge of value. (Plantinga 2000: 207) \nPlantinga develops an influential view of warrant which he calls the\nextended Aquinas/Calvin (A/C) model. Though an account of warrant in\ngeneral, it was developed specifically to show how religious beliefs\ncould be justified (both internally and externally); rational; and, if\nthese beliefs are true, could have warrant. \nThe central feature of this model is the stipulation that God has\ncreated us human beings with a belief-producing process or source of\nbelief, the sensus divinitatis; this source works under\nvarious conditions to produce beliefs about God, including, of course,\nbeliefs that immediately entail his existence. (Plantinga 2000:\n199) \nFor Plantinga, religious belief can be immediate and basic; a\nreligious belief can be warranted even if it is not held on the basis\nof argument, so long as it is reliably produced by the sensus\ndivinitatis. The A/C model is explicitly constructed to be able\nto account for the noetic effects of sin: \nOur fall into sin has had cataclysmic consequences, both affective and\ncognitive. As to affective consequences, our affections are skewed and\nour hearts now harbor deep and radical evil: we love ourselves above\nall, rather than God. There were also ruinous cognitive\nconsequences. Our original knowledge of God and of his marvelous\nbeauty, glory, and loveliness has been severely compromised; in this\nway the narrow image of God in us was destroyed and the broad image\ndamaged, distorted. In particular, the sensus divinitatis has\nbeen damaged and deformed; because of the fall, we no longer know God\nin the same natural and unproblematic way in which we know each other\nand the world around us. Still further, sin induces in us a\nresistance to the deliverances of the sensus\ndivinitatis, muted as they are by the first factor; we\ndon’t want to pay attention to its deliverances. We are\nunable by our own efforts to extricate ourselves from this quagmire.\n(Plantinga 2000: 205) \nPlantinga thinks that “the most serious noetic effects of\nsin” (Plantinga 2000: 214) are the deleterious effects sin has\non our knowledge of God: \nOur original knowledge of God and his glory is muffled and impaired;\nit has been replaced (by virtue of sin) by stupidity, dullness,\nblindness, inability to perceive God or to perceive him in his\nhandiwork. Our knowledge of his character and his love toward us can\nbe smothered: it can even be transformed into a resentful thought that\nGod is to be feared and mistrusted; we may see him as indifferent or\neven malignant.… The most important cognitive consequence of\nsin, therefore, is failure to know God. And this failure can have\nfurther cognitive consequences…. If we don’t know there\nis such a person as God, we don’t know the first thing (the most\nimportant thing) about ourselves, each other, and the world.\n(Plantinga 2000: 215 and 217) \nThe noetic effects of sin aren’t limited simply to knowledge of\nGod, however. They extend to our knowledge of the moral demands on our\nlives given our relationship with God, our emotions, imagination and\neven non-epistemic mental functions (see McMartin 2016). \nDespite sin’s epistemic effects, Plantinga thinks that knowledge\nof God is still possible in two ways. First, knowledge of God is\npossible via natural theology (see Walls & Dougherty 2018).\nSecond, knowledge of God is possible despite the noetic effects of sin\ngiven the role of the Holy Spirit in bringing about faith. Faith, for\nPlantinga, has both affective and cognitive elements. Central to the\ncognitive dimension of faith is “a firm and certain knowledge of\nGod” (Plantinga 2000: 206; see also Diller 2014) and knowledge\nof other central aspects of Christian belief. The sensus\ndivinitatis is repaired by the working of the Holy Spirit.\n“Without some special activity on the part of the Lord, we\nwouldn’t believe” (Plantinga 2000: 269). While sin has\ndamaged the sensus divinitatis, the Holy Spirit can\nregenerates it, allowing it to again function properly and remove\ndefeaters from warranted religion belief. \nMerold Westphal is another contemporary Christian philosopher who\nexplores sin’s noetic effects. Westphal claims that to take St.\nPaul seriously is to take seriously the universality of sin (Westphal\n1990; see also Westphal 1993), including sin’s effects on how we\nthink about God. Westphal worries that much philosophical theology is\ntoo optimistic about human reason, ignoring the impact of sin on our\nepistemic capacities and functioning. By “sin”, Westphal\nhas in mind both sinful acts and the general disposition to commit\nsinful acts, and he maintains that both acts and dispositions can be\nindividual and communal. Following Augustine, Westphal also sees sin\nas best described in terms of pride, \nthe self-assertion which usurps a role in life not proper to me,\ndepriving God and neighbor of their rightful places as, respectively,\nmy absolute superior and my equal. (Westphal 1990: 200) \nUltimately, sin isn’t weakness but rather idolatry.\nWestphal’s “Law of Inverse Rationality” holds\nthat \nthe ability of human thought to be undistorted by sinful desire is\ninversely proportional to the existential import of the subject\nmatter. (Westphal 1990: 205; see also Timpe 2014b) \nThis worry about the noetic effects of sin is one of the major\nmotivations for Westphal’s criticism of Reformed epistemology,\nfor we can’t be sure that our epistemic faculties, including the\nsensus divinitatis, are functioning properly if they’re\ndistorted by sin. \nWilliam Abraham suggest that Westphal’s approach insufficiently\nappreciates the role grace places as a remedy to sin: \nIf the sensus divinitatis is damaged all the way down without\nrepair, it is hard to see how we would even know anything that really\ncounted about God or about ourselves. Merold Westphal runs this risk\nis his very insightful essay. We need to remember that epistemically\nas well as spiritually, where sin abounds, grace amounts all the more.\n(Abraham 2006: 111 n. 17) \nAbraham suggests a \nmore robust vision of [human] cognitive capacities and practices, like\nintuition, percept, reason, memory, testimony, and the like \non the basis of the recognition that these capacities and practices,\neven while affected by sin, are “underwritten by the power and\ngoodness of God” (Abraham 2006: 121). \nDiscussions of the noetic effects of sin aren’t limited to the\nones mentioned here, nor to these topics. For a discussion of the\ncompatibility of the noetic effects of sin with evolutionary\nepistemology, for instance, particularly with an eye toward the\ncognitive science of religion, see De Cruz and Smedt 2013 and Barrett\n2009. Peter Harrison also argues that sin’s noetic effects\nhelped shape the experimental method in science (Harrison 2007). \nThe discussions of sin in the previous sections all have social\nimplications insofar as sin qua action, disposition, state,\nand epistemic factor can all harm human community. A sinful action can\nnot only harm others but also spark retaliatory sinful actions by the\none originally sinned against. The noetic effects of sin impact social\nlearning and instruction, with those effects being passed from\nindividuals and groups to others. The doctrine of original sin also\nclearly has social implications: if all human beings suffer from\noriginal sin, then their social interactions will be impacted by it.\nEven Swinburne, who rejects that humans suffer from original sin in a\nway that makes sin inevitable to us, holds that we contribute to the\nproneness of our communities to sin such that we are involved in the\nsins of our communities (Swinburne 1989: 145). These forms of sin\naffect our relationships, not just between individuals and other\nindividuals, but between individuals and groups and between groups and\nother groups. In short, sin corrupts the moral imaginations of not\njust individuals, but of entire communities. \nWe can also think of sin, however, not just in terms of individual\nacts and attitudes, but in terms of social structures. In this case,\nthere is a further “sociability” of sin that’s not\ncaptured by the previous discussions. The sixth century Byzantine monk\nand theologian Maximus the Confessor, for instance, held that sin\nleads to a breakdown in community, leading to individualism and social\nfragmentation. He went so far as to compare this state to a kind of\nbestiality (Deane-Drummond 2017: 38). Henri de Lubac interprets\nMaximus as understanding \noriginal sin as a separation, an individualization it might be called\nin the depreciatory sense of the word. (de Lubac 1988: 33) \nIf this is correct, then thinking of sin solely in individual terms is\nitself a result of sin. \nIt has seemed plausible to many others as well that sin can be\nembedded within social structures such that it is committed by groups\nand not just individuals. Writing within the Reformed tradition, Ruth\nGroenhout suggests we can think of “total depravity” as\nthe conviction that \nthe corruption of sin is not limited to smallish pockets of existence\nbut instead runs through every aspect of creation that we encounter as\na fracture that affects every part of our human reality. (Groenhout\n2006: 134) \nSin thus impacts not just individuals or groups, but the very nature\nof our social systems themselves: \nWhen sins such as pride, greed, and covetousness infect those who\nlegislate for society, as they almost always do, the legislation and\nresulting social structures are themselves corrupt, and will produce\noften predictable pathologies in society: poverty, racial segregation,\ndestruction of lives and relationships in the name of profit.\n(Groenhout 2006: 138) \nOn this view, human structures and systems as well as human nature are\nmarred or distorted by sin. Parallel to structural accounts of\ninjustices, structural approaches to sin hold that it “creates\nand exists within structures that shape the material reality of our\nplanet and all life on it” (Ray 2016: 417). This approach to sin\nis often found in liberation theologies (see McCall 2019: 259ff). \nConsider, for instance, racism. McCluskey 2017, chapter 6 contains a\ndiscussion of racism as involving not only bad actions but also bad\nhabits: \nA common habit among whites is to check that their car doors are\nlocked whenever they see an African-American walking on the street\nwhile they are driving. Seeing a white person walking does not trigger\nthe same response. Underlying this habit is the unacknowledged\njudgement by the privileged (white) group prevalent in a racist\nsociety that blacks, especially young black men, are criminals and\ntherefore to be feared. Racial profiling by the police leads to\nstopping persons of color on a habitual basis simply because of their\nskin color and is also grounded in the explicit or implicit belief\nthat members of these groups are more likely to commit crimes.\n(McCluskey 2017: 176; citations omitted) \nThose instances of racism that are caused by willful ignorance or\nresistance to self-scrutiny will also reflect the epistemic dimension\nof sin. But beyond this, it may be that racism is an example of an\nirreducibly structural sin, as Stephen Ray argues. Racism, like race\nitself, on his view, is socially constructed. If racism isn’t\njust habits of individuals (made more likely, surely, by the habits\nand actions prevalent in their community or society) but something\nstructural itself, it may also be helpful to think of some sin as\nstructural along similar lines. This holds for two important reasons,\none of which regards the existence of oppressive structures and the\nsecond about how their existence is masked: \nFirst, … is the realization that sin becomes apparent in\nstructures through the material consequence of their\noperation.… The second reason is that, because the evidence of\nsin’s presence is usually undeniable, it effectively shields\nitself from scrutiny and intervention by constructing ideological\nformations that take the presence of ill-being and death as simply the\nnatural order of things. (Ray 2016: 424) \nThis latter is what he means by saying that structural sin is\n“mundane”. \nKatie Walker Grimes argues that a response to racism framed primarily\nin terms of “white privilege” rather than white supremacy\nor antiblackness is insufficient because such an approach is overly\nindividualistic and doesn’t take the social nature of sin\nsufficiently seriously (see Grimes 2016: xxi). Grimes develops an\naccount of anti-blackness built on “corporate virtue\ntheory”, which focuses on the relationship between habits and\ncharacter of social bodies rather than individuals. The forces that\nresult in antiblackness are inherently social (e.g., economics,\nsegregated space), and so antiblack racism should be seen as\ninherently social as well. A number of theologians also explore\nvictim-oriented soteriologies that focus primarily on the plight of\nindividuals who are victims of institutional oppression and injustice,\ntrying to articulate what reconciliation looks like in those settings\n(see Hunsinger 2016 and Hieb 2013). \nA number of feminist scholars have also argued that sexism can be\nunderstood along the lines of structural sin. Elisabeth\nSchüseller Fiorenza, for instance, characterizes sexism as \nthe dehumanizing trends, injustices, and discrimination of\ninstitutions, the theology and symbol system that legitimate these\ninstitutions, and the collective and personal “false\nconsciousness” created by sexist institutions and ideologies and\ninternalized in socialization and education. This “false\nconsciousness” permits oppressed people and groups to accept\ntheir oppression and to internalize the values of the oppressor. This\nunderstanding of patriarchal sexism as structural sin and evil power\ninstitutionalized in society and ecclesial oppressive structures is\nakin to [Saint] Paul’s understanding of sin as transpersonal,\ndestructive power whose ultimate expression is the life-destroying\npower of death. (Schüseller Fiorenza 1993: 140) \nMany of these scholars see traditional approaches to sin as\nindividualistic action or disposition to be problematic and harmful to\nwomen (see, for instance, the work of Saiving 1992, Plaskow 1980, and\nDunfee 1982 for historically influential examples). Rachel Sophia\nBaard’s work is one example of this line of criticism. Baard\nargues that sin-talk contributes to communal praxis, shaping where and\nhow our practices reproduce themselves. As she puts it, our language\nand understanding of sin creates a script that people perform; for\ninstance, if sin is simply understood as individual actions, then it\nwould encourage us not to see the social structures involved in\npatriarchy as sinful, thereby making it more likely that those\nstructures continue rather than addressing them as problematic.\nTraditional understandings of sin rooted in pride, she continues,\nwhich lie at the heart of many Christian institutions, and cultural\nbeliefs and practices, \ncreate a social climate in which gender violence is not only\nimaginable but tolerated or accepted as “normal”, indeed,\nas simply part of the human condition. (Baard 2019: 49; see also Jones\n2000) \nIf all sin is ultimately rooted in pride and self-exertion, the proper\nresponse to sin is found in humility and self-sacrifice. But in\nsituations of oppression and gender-based violence, such a response\nencourages further harm and a denial of proper agency: \nby and large, female pathology is typically not rooted in the\nelevation of the self but in the negation of the self—hence,\ncalling for the shattering of the self or the humility that\n“regards others as better than ourselves” will end up\naggravating, rather than addressing, women’s sin. (Baard 2019:\n61) \nThis can be seen historically in how women have been blamed for sin,\nand that blame then used to deny opportunities for or justify violence\nagainst women. Baard argues that a shift to a rhetoric of the systemic\nnature of oppression rather than pride is often called for, shifting\nfocus away from the purported moral failing of the individual to the\nandrocentric rhetoric and practices that perpetuates structures that\noppress. \nIn addition to racism and sexism, other social forms of oppression can\nalso be understood as examples of structural sins. Leigh Vicens\nsuggests that we can understand implicit bias as a kind of socially\nbased structural sin (Vicens 2018; for a recent discussion of the\nstate of research on implicit bias, see Brownstein, Madva, and\nGawronski 2020). Marjorie Suchocki argues that sin is \nparticipation through intent or action in unnecessary violence that\ncontributes to the ill-being of any aspect of earth or its\ninhabitants. (Suchocki 1994: 12) \nwhere that participation is part of our inheritance thorough social\nsolidarity with other sinful humans. Sin is “individual only\ninsofar as we participate in the whole society” (Suchocki 1994:\n157). She uses this account to illuminate oppression, economic\nsystems, and homophobia. Patriarchy can perhaps be understood in a\nsimilar way (see Baard 2019 and Ruether 1993). And Ruth Groenhout\nexplores the relationship between systemic sin and contemporary\nhealthcare systems (Grouenhout 2006).","contact.mail":"kt24@calvin.edu","contact.domain":"calvin.edu"}]
