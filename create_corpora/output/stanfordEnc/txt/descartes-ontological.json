Fascination with the argument stems from the effort to\nprove God’s existence from simple but powerful premises. Existence is\nderived immediately from the clear and distinct idea of a supremely\nperfect being. Ironically, the simplicity of the argument has also\nproduced several misreadings, exacerbated in part by Descartes’\ntendency to formulate it in different ways.\n\n\n\nThe main statement of the argument appears in the Fifth Meditation.\nThis comes on the heels of an earlier causal argument for God’s\nexistence in the Third Meditation, raising questions about the order\nand relation between these two distinct proofs. Descartes repeats the\nontological argument in a few other central texts including the\nPrinciples of Philosophy. He also defends it in the First,\nSecond, and Fifth Replies against scathing objections by some of the\nleading intellectuals of his day.\n\n\n\nDescartes was not the first philosopher to formulate an ontological\nargument. An earlier version of the argument had been vigorously\ndefended by St. Anselm in the eleventh century, and then criticized by\na monk named Gaunilo (Anselm’s contemporary) and later by St. Thomas\nAquinas. Aquinas’ critique was regarded as so devastating that\nthe ontological argument died out for several centuries. It thus came\nas a surprise to Descartes’ contemporaries that he should attempt to\nresurrect it. Although he claims not to be familiar with Anselm’s\nversion of the proof, Descartes appears to craft his own argument so as\nto block traditional objections.\n\n\n\nDespite similarities, Descartes’ version of the argument differs\nfrom Anselm’s in important ways. The latter’s version is\nthought to proceed from the meaning of the word “God,” by\ndefinition, God is a being a greater than which cannot be\nconceived. Descartes’ argument, in contrast, is grounded in two\ncentral tenets of his philosophy — the theory of innate ideas\nand the doctrine of clear and distinct perception. He purports to rely\nnot on an arbitrary definition of God but rather on an innate idea\nwhose content is “given.” Descartes’ version is also\nextremely simple. God’s existence is inferred directly from the\nfact that necessary existence is contained in the clear and distinct\nidea of a supremely perfect being. Indeed, on some occasions he\nsuggests that the so-called ontological “argument” is not\na formal proof at all but a self-evident axiom grasped intuitively by\na mind free of philosophical prejudice.\n\n\n\nDescartes often compares the ontological argument to a geometric\ndemonstration, arguing that necessary existence cannot be excluded\nfrom idea of God anymore than the fact that its angles equal two right\nangles, for example, can be excluded from the idea of a triangle. The\nanalogy underscores once again the argument’s supreme\nsimplicity. God’s existence is purported to be as obvious and\nself-evident as the most basic mathematical truth. It also attempts to\nshow how the “logic” of the demonstration is rooted in our\nordinary reasoning practices.\n\n\n\nIn the same context, Descartes also characterizes the ontological\nargument as a proof from the “essence” or\n“nature” of God, arguing that necessary existence cannot\nbe separated from the essence of a supremely perfect being without\ncontradiction. In casting the argument in these terms, he is\nimplicitly relying on a traditional medieval distinction between a\nthing’s essence and its existence. According to this tradition, one\ncan determine what something is (i.e. its essence), independently of\nknowing whether it exists. This distinction appears useful to\nDescartes’ aims, some have thought, because it allows him to specify\nGod’s essence without begging the question of his existence.\n\n\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Descartes’ version of the ontological\nargument is its simplicity. Indeed, it reads more like the report of an\nintuition than a formal proof. Descartes underscores the simplicity of\nhis demonstration by comparing it to the way we ordinarily establish\nvery basic truths in arithmetic and geometry, such as that the number\ntwo is even or that the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to the\nsum of two right angles. We intuit such truths directly by inspecting\nour clear and distinct ideas of the number two and of a triangle. So,\nlikewise, we are able to attain knowledge of God’s existence simply by\napprehending that necessary existence is included in the clear and\ndistinct idea of a supremely perfect being. As Descartes writes in the\nFifth Meditation: \n\nOne is easily misled by the analogy between the ontological argument\nand a geometric demonstration, and by the language of\n“proof” in this passage and others like it. Descartes does\nnot conceive of the ontological argument on the model of an Euclidean or\naxiomatic proof, in which theorems are derived from epistemically\nprior axioms and definitions.  On the contrary, he is drawing our\nattention to another method of establishing truths that informs our\nordinary practices and is non-discursive. This method employs\nintuition or, what is the same for Descartes, clear and distinct\nperception. It consists in unveiling the contents of our clear and\ndistinct ideas. The basis for this method is the rule for truth, which\nwas previously established in the Fourth Meditation. According to the\nversion of this rule invoked in the Fifth Meditation, whatever I\nclearly and distinctly perceive to be contained in the idea of\nsomething is true of that thing. So if I clearly and distinctly\nperceive that necessary existence pertains to the idea of a supremely\nperfect being, then such a being truly exists. \n\nAlthough Descartes maintains that God’s existence is ultimately\nknown through intuition, he is not averse to presenting formal versions\nof the ontological argument. He never forgets that he is writing for a\nseventeenth-century audience, steeped in scholastic logic, that would\nhave expected to be engaged at the level of the Aristotelian syllogism.\nDescartes satisfies such expectations, presenting not one but at least\ntwo separate versions of the ontological argument. These proofs,\nhowever, are stunningly brief and betray his true intentions. One\nversion of the argument simply codifies the psychological process by\nwhich one intuits God’s existence, in the manner described above: \n\nThe rule for truth appears here in the guise of the first premise,\nbut it is more naturally read as a statement of Descartes’ own\nalternative method of “demonstration” via clear and distinct perception\nor intuition. In effect, the first “premise” is designed to instruct\nthe meditator on how to apply this method, the same role that the\nanalogy with a geometric demonstration serves in passage [1]. \n\nWhen presenting this version of the argument in the First Replies,\nDescartes sets aside this first premise and focuses our attention on\nthe second. In so doing, he is indicating the relative unimportance of\nthe proof itself. Having learned how to apply Descartes’ alternative\nmethod of reasoning, one need only perceive that necessary existence\npertains to the idea of a supremely perfect being. Once one attains\nthis perception, formal arguments are no longer required; God’s\nexistence will be self-evident (Second Replies, Fifth Postulate; AT\n7:163–4; CSM 2:115). \n\nDescartes sometimes uses traditional arguments as heuristic devices,\nnot merely to appease a scholastically trained audience but to help\ninduce clear and distinct perceptions. This is evident for example in\nthe version of the ontological argument standardly associated with his\nname: \n\nWhile this set of sentences has the surface structure of a formal\nargument, its persuasive force lies at a different level. A meditator\nwho is having trouble perceiving that necessary existence is contained\nin the idea of a supreme perfect being can attain this perception\nindirectly by first recognizing that this idea includes every\nperfection. Indeed, the idea of a supremely perfect being just is the\nidea of a being having all perfections. To attempt to exclude any or\nall perfections from the idea of a supremely being, Descartes observes,\ninvolves one in a contradiction and is akin to conceiving a mountain\nwithout a valley (or, better, an up-slope without a down-slope). Having\nformed this perception, one need only intuit that necessary existence\nis itself a perfection. It will then be clear that necessary existence\nis one of the attributes included in the idea of a supremely perfect\nbeing. \n\nWhile such considerations might suffice to induce the requisite\nclear and distinct perception in the meditator, Descartes is aiming a\ndeeper point, namely that there is a conceptual link between necessary\nexistence and each of the other divine perfections. It is important to\nrecall that in the Third Meditation, in the midst of the causal\nargument for the existence of God, the meditator already discovered\nmany of these perfections — omnipotence, omniscience, immutability,\neternality, simplicity, etc. Because our mind is finite, we normally\nthink of the divine perfections separately and “hence may not\nimmediately notice the necessity of their being joined together” (First\nReplies, AT 7:119; CSM 2:85). But if we attend carefully to “whether\nexistence belongs to a supremely perfect being, and what sort of\nexistence it is” we shall discover that we cannot conceive any one of\nthe other attributes while excluding necessary existence from it\n(ibid.). \n\nTo illustrate this point Descartes appeals to divine omnipotence. He\nthinks that we cannot conceive an omnipotent being except as existing.\nDescartes’ illustration presupposes the traditional, medieval\nunderstanding of “necessary existence.” When speaking of\nthis divine attribute, he sometimes uses the term\n“existence” simpliciter as shorthand. But in his\nmore careful pronouncements he always insists on the phrase\n“necessary and eternal existence,” which resonates with\ntradition. Medieval, scholastic philosophers often spoke of God as the\nsole “necessary being,” by which they meant a being who\ndepends only on himself for his existence. This is the notion of\n“aseity” or self-existence (a se esse). Since\nsuch a being does not depend on anything else for its existence, he\nhas neither a beginning nor an end, but is eternal. Returning to the\ndiscussion in the First Replies, one can see how omnipotence is linked\nconceptually to necessary existence in this traditional sense. An\nomnipotent or all-powerful being does not depend ontologically on\nanything (for if it did then it would not be omnipotent). It exists by\nits own power: \n\nSome readers have thought that Descartes offers yet a third version of\nthe ontological argument in this passage (Wilson, 1978, 174–76), but\nwhether or not that was his intention is unimportant, since his\nprimary aim, as indicated in the last line, is to enable his meditator\nto intuit that necessary existence is included in the idea of\nGod. Since there is a conceptual link between the divine attributes, a\nclear and distinct perception of one provides a cognitive route to any\nof the others. \n\nAlthough Descartes sometimes uses formal versions of the ontological\nargument to achieve his aims, he consistently affirms that God’s\nexistence is ultimately known through clear and distinct perception.\nThe formal versions of the argument are merely heuristic devices, to be\njettisoned once one has attained the requisite intuition of a supremely\nperfect being. Descartes stresses this point explicitly in the Fifth\nMeditation, immediately after presenting the two versions of the\nargument considered above: \n\nHere Descartes develops his earlier analogy between the (so-called)\nontological argument and a geometric demonstration. He suggests that\nthere are some meditators for whom God’s existence is immediately\nmanifest; for them God’s existence is akin to an axiom or definition in\ngeometry, such as that the hypotenuse of a right triangle subtends its\nlargest angle. But other meditators, whose minds are confused and mired\nin sensory images, must work much harder, and might even require a\nproof to attain the requisite clear and distinct perception. For them,\nGod’s existence is akin to the Pythagorean Theorem. The important point\nis that both kinds of meditators ultimately attain knowledge of God’s\nexistence by clearly and distinctly perceiving that necessary existence is\ncontained in the idea of supremely perfect being. Once one has achieved\nthis perception, God’s existence will be manifest or, as Descartes says\nelsewhere, “self-evident” (per se notam) (Second Replies,\nFifth Postulate; AT 7: 164; CSM 2:115). \n\nDescartes’ contemporaries would have been surprised by this last\nremark. While reviewing an earlier version of the ontological argument,\nAquinas had rejected the claim that God’s existence is self-evident, at\nleast with respect to us. He argued that what is self-evident cannot be\ndenied without contradiction, but God’s existence can be denied.\nIndeed, the proverbial fool says in his heart “There is no God” (Psalm\n53.1). \n\nWhen confronted with this criticism by a contemporary objector,\nDescartes tries to find common ground: “St. Thomas asks whether\nexistence is self-evident as far as we are concerned, that is, whether\nit is obvious to everyone; and he answers, correctly, that it is not”\n(First Replies, AT 7:115; CSM 2:82). Descartes interprets Aquinas to be\nclaiming that God’s existence is not self-evident to everyone,\nwhich is something with which he can agree. Descartes does not hold\nthat God’s existence is immediately self-evident, or self-evident to\neveryone, but that it can become self-evident to some careful and\nindustrious meditators. \n\nIn the Fifth Meditation and elsewhere Descartes says that God’s\nexistence follows from the fact that existence is contained in the\n“true and immutable essence, nature, or form” of a\nsupremely perfect being, just as it follows from the essence of a\ntriangle that its angles equal two right angles. This way of putting\nthe a priori argument has puzzled commentators and has led to\na lively debate about the ontological status of Cartesian essences and\nthe objects which are purported to “have” them. Some\ncommentators have thought that Descartes is committed to a species of\nPlatonic realism.  According to this view, some objects that fall\nshort of actual existence nevertheless subsist as abstract, logical\nentities outside the mind and beyond the physical world (Kenny, 1968;\nWilson, 1978).  Another commentator places Cartesian essences in God\n(Schmaltz 1991), while two recent revisionist interpretations\n(Chappell, 1997; Nolan, 1997) read Descartes as a conceptualist who\ntakes essences to be ideas in human minds. \n\nDescartes’ reference to “essences” raises another important issue\nmore directly related to the ontological argument. In claiming that\nnecessary existence cannot be excluded from the essence of God,\nDescartes is drawing on the traditional medieval distinction between\nessence and existence. According to this distinction, one can say\nwhat something is (i.e. its essence), prior to knowing whether\nit exists. So, for example, one can define what a horse is —\nenumerating all of its essential properties — before knowing whether\nthere are any horses in the world. The only exception to this\ndistinction was thought to be God himself, whose essence just is to\nexist. It is easy to see how this traditional distinction could be\nexploited by a defender of the ontological argument. Existence is\nincluded in the essence of a supremely perfect being, but not in the\nessence of any finite thing. Thus it follows solely from the essence of\nthe former that such a being actually exists. At times, Descartes\nappears to support this interpretation of the ontological argument. In\nthe Fifth Replies, for example, he writes that “the existence of a\ntriangle should not be compared with the existence of God, since the\nrelation between existence and essence is manifestly quite different in\nthe case of God from what it is in the case of the triangle. God is his\nown existence, but this is not true of the triangle” (AT 7:383; CSM\n2:263). But Descartes’ complete view is subtler and more sophisticated\nthan these remarks first suggest. Understanding this view requires a\nmore careful investigation of the distinction between essence and\nexistence as it appears in medieval sources. Although one often speaks\nof the “traditional” distinction, the exact nature of the relation\nbetween essence and existence in finite things was the subject of a\nfierce debate among medieval philosophers. Seeing where Descartes’\nposition fits within this debate will provide a deeper understanding of\nhis version of the ontological argument. \n\nThe distinction between essence and existence can be traced back as\nfar as Boethius in the fifth century. It was later developed by\nIslamic thinkers such as Avicenna. But the issue did not become a\nmajor philosophical problem until it was taken up by Aquinas in the\nthirteenth century. The issue arose not as part of an effort to\nestablish God’s existence on a priori grounds (as mentioned\nabove, Aquinas was one of the staunchest critics of the ontological\nargument), but out of concern to distinguish God from finite spiritual\nentities such as angels. Like many scholastic philosophers, Aquinas\nbelieved that God is perfectly simple and that created beings, in\ncontrast, have a composite character that accounts for their finitude\nand imperfection. Earthly creatures are composites of matter and form\n(the doctrine of hylomorphism), but since purely spiritual beings are\nimmaterial, Aquinas located their composite character in the\ndistinction between essence and existence. \n\nSome of the details of Aquinas’ account will emerge from our\ndiscussion below. The primary interest of his theory for our purposes,\nhowever, is that it led to a lively debate among his successors both as\nto how to interpret the master and about the true nature of the\nrelation between essence and existence in created things. This debate\nproduced three main positions: \n\nProponents of the first view conceived the distinction between essence\nand existence as obtaining between two separate things. In the eyes of\nmany Thomists, this view was considered to be quite radical,\nespecially as an interpretation of Aquinas’ original position. The\nlatter is sometimes expressed by saying that essence and existence are\n“principles of being” rather than beings themselves. One\nproblem then with the theory of real distinction, at least as espoused\nby many of Aquinas’ followers, was that it reified essence and\nexistence, treating them as real beings in addition to the created\nentity that they compose. \n\nThe theory of real distinction was also considered objectionable for\nphilosophical reasons. Following Aquinas, many participants in the\ndebate urged that essence and existence are related to each other as\npotency and act, so that existence can be said to\n“actualize” essence.  On the theory of real distinction,\nthis view leads to an infinite regress. If an essence becomes actual\nonly in virtue of something else — viz. existence\n— being superadded to it, then what gives existence its reality,\nand so on ad infinitum? (Wippel, 1982, 393f). \n\nIn response to these difficulties some scholastic philosophers\ndeveloped a position at the polar extreme from the theory of real\ndistinction. This was the view that there is merely a rational\ndistinction or a “distinction of reason” between essence\nand existence in created beings. As the term suggests, this theory\nheld that essence and existence of a creature are identical in reality\nand distinguished only within our thought by means of reason. Needless\nto say, proponents of this theory were forced to distinguish purely\nspiritual entities from God on grounds other than real\ncomposition. \n\nGiving up the doctrine of real composition seemed too much for another\ngroup of thinkers who were also critical of the theory of real\ndistinction. This led to the development of a number of intermediate\npositions, including Duns Scotus’ curious notion of a formal\ndistinction and the view that essence and existence are modally\ndistinct such that existence constitutes a mode of a thing’s\nessence. \n\nLike Francisco Suárez, his most immediate scholastic\npredecessor, Descartes sides with the proponents of a rational\ndistinction between essence and existence. His position is unique,\nhowever, insofar as it springs from a more general theory of\n“attributes”. Articulating this theory in an important\npassage in the\nPrinciples of Philosophy, Descartes claims that there is\nmerely a distinction of reason between a substance and any one of its\nattributes or between any two attributes of a single substance (1:62,\nAT 8A:30; CSM 1:214). For Descartes’ purposes, the most significant\ninstance of a rational distinction is that which obtains between a\nsubstance and its essence — or what he sometimes refers to as its\n“principal attribute” (1:53, AT 8A:25; CSM 1:210). Since thought and\nextension constitute the essence of mind and body, respectively, a mind\nis merely rationally distinct from its thinking and a body is merely\nrationally distinct from its extension (1:63, AT 8A:31; CSM 1:215). But\nDescartes insists that a rational distinction also obtains between any\ntwo attributes of a substance. Since existence qualifies as an\nattribute in this technical sense, the essence and existence of a\nsubstance are also distinct merely by reason (1:56, AT 8A:26; CSM\n1:211). Descartes reaffirms this conclusion in a letter intended to\nelucidate his account of the relation between essence and\nexistence: \n\nIndications are given here as to how a rational distinction is\nproduced in our thought. Descartes explains that we regard a single\nthing in different abstract ways. Case in point, we can regard a thing\nas existing, or we can abstract from its existence and attend to its\nother aspects. In so doing, we have distinguished the existence of a\nsubstance from its essence within our thought. Like scholastic\nproponents of the theory of rational distinction, however, Descartes\nis keen to emphasize that this distinction is purely\nconceptual. Indeed, he goes on to explain that the essence and\nexistence of a substance are “in no way distinct” outside\nthought (AT 4:350; CSMK 3:280). In reality they are identical. \n\nWhile borrowing much from scholasticism, Descartes’ account is\ndistinguished by its scope of application. He extends the theory of\nrational distinction from created substances to God. In general, the\nessence and the existence of a substance are merely rationally\ndistinct, and hence identical in reality. \n\nThis result appears to wreak havoc on Descartes’ ontological\nargument. One of the most important objections to the argument is that\nif it were valid, one could proliferate such arguments for all sorts of\nthings, including beings whose existence is merely contingent. By\nsupposing that there is merely a rational distinction between essence\nand existence abroad in all things, Descartes seems to confirm this\nobjection. In general, a substance is to be identified with its\nexistence, whether it is God or a finite created thing. \n\nThe problem with this objection, in this instance, is that it\nassumes that Descartes locates the difference between God and creatures\nin the relation each of these things bears to its existence. This is\nnot the case. In a few important passages, Descartes affirms that\nexistence is contained in the clear and distinct idea of every single\nthing, but he also insists that there are different grades of\nexistence: \n\nIn light of this passage and others like it, we can refine the\ntheory of rational distinction. What one should say, strictly speaking,\nis that God is merely rationally distinct from his necessary\nexistence, while every finite created thing is merely rationally\ndistinct from its possible or contingent existence.\nThe distinction between possible or contingent existence on the one\nhand, and necessary existence on the other, allows Descartes to account\nfor the theological difference between God and his creatures. \n\nNow, when Descartes says that a substance (be it finite or infinite)\nis merely rationally distinct from its existence, he always means an\nactually existing substance. So how are we to understand the claim that\na finite substance is merely rationally distinct from its\npossible existence? What is meant by “possible (or contingent)\nexistence”? It is tempting to suppose that this term means non-actual\nexistence. But as we saw already with the case of necessary existence,\nDescartes does not intend these terms in their logical or modal senses.\nIf “necessary existence” means ontologically independent existence,\nthen “possible existence” means something like dependent\nexistence. After all, Descartes contrasts possible existence not with\nactual existence but with necessary existence in the traditional sense.\nThis account is also suggested by the term “contingent.” Created things\nare contingent in the sense that they depend for their existence on\nGod, the sole independent being. \n\nThis result explains why Descartes believes that we cannot\nproliferate ontological arguments for created substances. It is not\nthat the relation between essence and existence is any different in God\nthan it is in finite things. In both cases there is merely a rational\ndistinction. The difference is in the grade of existence that attaches\nto each. Whereas the concept of an independent being entails that such\na being exists, the concept of a finite thing entails only that it has\ndependent existence. \n\nLooking back at the problematic passage cited above from the Fifth\nReplies, it becomes clear that Descartes intended something along\nthese lines even there. He says that “the existence of a\ntriangle should not be compared with the existence of God”,\nreinforcing the point that it is the kind of existence involved that\nmakes God unique. And just before this statement, he writes, “in\nthe case of God necessary existence…applies to him alone and\nforms a part of his essence as it does of no other thing”. Later\nhe adds: “I do not … deny that possible existence is a\nperfection in the idea of a triangle, just as necessary existence is\nperfection in the idea of God” (AT 7:383; CSM 2:263). Descartes’\nfinal position then is that essence and existence are identical in all\nthings. What distinguishes God from creatures is his grade of\nexistence. We can produce an ontological argument for God, and not for\nfinite substances, because the idea of a supremely perfect being\nuniquely contains necessary — or ontologically independent\n— existence. \n\nBecause of its simplicity, Descartes’ version of the ontological\nargument is commonly thought to be cruder and more obviously fallacious\nthan the one put forward by Anselm in the eleventh century. But when\nthe complete apparatus of the Cartesian system is brought forth, the\nargument proves itself to be quite resilient, at least on its own\nterms. Indeed, Descartes’ version is superior to his predecessor’s\ninsofar as it is grounded in a theory of innate ideas and the doctrine\nof clear and distinct perception. These two doctrines inoculate\nDescartes from the charge made against Anselm, for example, that the\nontological argument attempts to define God into existence by\narbitrarily building existence into the concept of a supremely perfect\nbeing. In the Third Meditation, the meditator discovers that her idea\nof God is not a fiction that she has conveniently invented but\nsomething native to the mind. As we shall see below, these two\ndoctrines provide the resources for answering other objections as\nwell. \n\nGiven our earlier discussion concerning the non-logical status of\nthe ontological argument, it may seem surprising that Descartes would\ntake objections to it seriously. He should be able to dismiss most\nobjections in one neat trick by insisting on the non-logical nature of\nthe demonstration. This is especially true of the objection that the\nontological argument begs the question. If God’s existence is\nultimately self-evident and known by a simple intuition of the mind,\nthen there are no questions to be begged. Unfortunately, not all of the\nobjections to the ontological argument can be dismissed so handily, for\nthe simple reason that they do not all depend on the assumption that we\nare dealing with a formal proof. \n\nAlthough it is often overlooked, many of the best known criticisms\nof the ontological argument were put to Descartes by official objectors\nto the Meditations. He in turn responded to these objections\n— sometimes in lengthy replies — though many contemporary readers\nhave found his responses opaque and unsatisfying. We can better\nunderstand his replies and, in some cases, improve upon them by\nappealing to discussions from previous sections. \n\nOne classical objection to the ontological argument, which was first\nleveled by Gaunilo against Anselm’s version of the proof, is that it\nmakes an illicit logical leap from the mental world of concepts to the\nreal world of things. The claim is that even if we were to concede that\nnecessary existence is inseparable from the idea of God (in Kant’s\nterms, even if necessary existence were analytic of the concept “God”),\nnothing follows from this about what does or does not exist in the\nactual world. Johannes Caterus, the author of the First Set of\nObjections to the Meditations, puts the point as follows: \n\nTo meet this challenge, Descartes must explain how he “bridges” the\ninferential gap between thought and reality. The principle of clear and\ndistinct perception is intended to do just that. According to this\nprinciple, for which he argues in the Fourth Meditation, whatever one\nclearly and distinctly perceives or understands is true — true not\njust of ideas but of things in the real world represented by those\nideas. Thus, Descartes’ commitment to the principle of clear and\ndistinct perception allows him to elude another objection that had\nhaunted Anselm’s version of the argument. \n\nThe previous objection is related to another difficulty raised by\nCaterus. In order to illustrate that the inference from the mental to\nthe extra-mental commits a logical error, critics have observed that if\nsuch inferences were legitimate then we could proliferate ontological\narguments for supremely perfect islands, existing lions, and all sorts\nof things which either do not exist or whose existence is contingent\nand thus should not follow a priori from their concept. The\ntrick is simply to build existence into the concept. So, while existence\ndoes not follow from the concept of lion as such, it does\nfollow from the concept of an “existing lion.” \n\nDescartes’ actual reply to this objection, which he took very\nseriously, is highly complex and couched in terms of a theory of “true\nand immutable natures.” We can simplify matters by focusing on its key\nelements. One of his first moves is to introduce a point that we\ndiscussed earlier (see passage [5] in section 2),\nnamely that existence is contained in the idea of every thing that we\nclearly and distinctly perceive: possible (or dependent) existence is\ncontained in our clear and distinct idea of every finite thing and\nnecessary (or independent) existence is uniquely contained in the idea\nof God (AT 7:117; CSM 2:83). So for Descartes one does not have to\nbuild existence into the idea of something if that idea is clear and\ndistinct; existence is already included in every clear and distinct\nidea. But it does not follow that the thing represented by such an idea\nactually exists, except in the case of God. We cannot produce\nontological arguments for finite things for the simple reason that the\nclear and distinct ideas of them contain merely dependent existence.\nActual existence is demanded only by the idea of God, which uniquely\ncontains independent existence. \n\nA natural rejoinder to this reply would be to ask about the idea of\na lion having not possible but wholly necessary existence. If\nDescartes’ method of reasoning were valid, it would seem to follow from\nthis idea that such a creature exists. This formulation of the\nobjection requires Descartes’ second and deeper point, which is only\nhinted at in his official reply. This is that the idea of a lion — let\nalone the idea of a lion having necessary existence — is hopelessly\nobscure and confused. As Descartes says, the nature of a lion is “not\ntransparently clear to us” (Axiom 10, Second Replies; AT 7:117; CSM\n2:84). Since this idea is not clear and distinct, the method of\ndemonstration employed in the ontological argument does not apply to\nit. Recall that the geometrical method of demonstration is grounded in\nthe principle of clear and distinct perception and consists in drawing\nout the contents of our clear and distinct ideas. If an idea is not\nclear and distinct then we cannot draw any conclusions from it about\nthings outside thought. \n\nThe key difference then between the idea of God on the one hand and\nthe idea of a necessarily existing lion is that the former can be\nclearly and distinctly perceived. For Descartes, it is just a brute\nfact that certain ideas can be clearly and distinctly perceived and\nothers cannot. Some critics have charged him with dogmatism in this\nregard. Why should Descartes be allowed to legislate the scope of our\nclear and distinct perceptions? Perhaps we can clearly and distinctly\nperceive something that he could not. \n\nDescartes cannot be saved entirely from this charge, but two\nimportant points can be made in his defense. First, he has principled\nreasons for thinking that everyone has the same set of innate or clear\nand distinct ideas. When the meditator first proved God’s existence in\nthe Third Meditation, she also established that God is supremely good\nand hence no deceiver. One consequence of God’s perfect benevolence is\nthat he implanted the same set of innate ideas in all finite minds.\nThus, Descartes feels justified in concluding that the limits of his\ncapacity for clear and distinct perception will be shared by\neveryone. \n\nSecond, when responding to objections to the ontological argument\nsuch as the ones considered above, Descartes typically does more than\ninsist dogmatically on a unique set of clear and distinct ideas. He\nalso tries to dispel the confusion which he thinks is at the root of\nthe objection. Since the ontological argument ultimately reduces to an\naxiom, the source of an objection according to Descartes’ diagnosis is\nthe failure of the objector to perceive this axiom clearly and\ndistinctly. Thus, Descartes devotes the bulk of his efforts to trying\nto remove those philosophical prejudices which are hindering his\nobjector from intuiting the axiom. These efforts are not always\nobvious, however. Descartes is good at maintaining the pretense of\nanswering criticisms to a formal proof. But his replies to Caterus’\nobjections to the ontological argument are best read as an extended\neffort to dispel prejudice and confusion, so as to enable his reader to\nintuit God’s existence for himself. \n\nLet us return for a moment to the objection that the ontological\nargument slides illicitly from the mental to the extramental realm. We\nhave seen how Descartes responds to it, but it is related to another\nobjection that has come to be associated with Leibniz. Leibniz claims\nthat Descartes’ version of the ontological argument is incomplete. It\nshows merely that if God’s existence is possible or non-contradictory,\nthen God exists.  But it fails to demonstrate the antecedent of this\nconditional (Robert Adams 1998, 135). To reinforce this objection, it\nis sometimes observed that the divine perfections (omnipotence,\nomniscience, benevolence, eternality, etc.) might be inconsistent with\none another.  This objection is related to the previous one in that\nthe point in both cases is that Descartes’ argument restricts us to\nclaims about the concept of God and lacks existential import. In order\nto redress this issue himself, Leibniz formulates a different version\nof the ontological argument (see Adams 1998, 141f). \n\nDescartes was dead long before Leibniz articulated this criticism but\nit was familiar to him from the Second Set of Objectors (Marin\nMersenne et al.) (AT 7:127; CSM 2:91). He replies by\nappealing once again to the principle of clear and distinct\nperception, which states that if something is contained in the clear\nand distinct idea of something then it is not only possible but also\ntrue of that thing in reality. (Descartes might have said that if\nsomething is conceivable then it is possible, and a being having all\nperfections is conceivable, but he has an even stronger principle at\nhis disposal in the rule for truth.) In effect, Descartes thinks he\nhas already satisfied Mersenne and Leibniz’s extra condition.  But\nMersenne’s version of the objection goes further, urging that in order\nto know with certainty that God’s nature is possible, one must have an\nadequate idea that encompasses all of the divine attributes and the\nrelations between them (ibid.) — something that Descartes denies\nthat we have. Descartes responds to this criticism as follows: \n\nIt is difficult to see how this statement on its own addresses\nMersenne’s criticism, but here again we can gain a better grip on what\nDescartes has in mind by appealing to our earlier discussion in\nsection 2. We noted there that on Descartes’ view there is merely a\nrational distinction between a substance and each of its attributes,\nand between any two attributes of a single substance. He also\nmaintains that God has only attributes and no modes or accidental\nproperties. This implies that there is merely a rational distinction\nbetween all of the divine perfections, something that he expressly\naffirms in his correspondence (see, e.g., AT 4:349; CSMK 3:280). In\nthe Third Meditation he also notes that “the unity, simplicity,\nor the inseparability of all the divine attributes of God is one of\nthe most important of the perfections which I understand him to\nhave” (AT 7:50; CSM 2:34). So not only is there no inconsistency\nbetween the divine perfections, but we understand that one of the most\nimportant perfections is simplicity (contra Curley 2005), which is\njust to say that in God there is no distinction between his\nattributes: God’s omnipotence just is his omniscience, which just is\nhis benevolence, etc. The very distinction between the divine\nattributes is confined to our thought or reason. This then is what he\nmeans by saying in passage [7] that the divine attributes are\n“interconnected,” which echoes a remark in the Third\nMeditation passage concerning “the interconnection and\ninseparability of the perfections” (ibid.). Descartes’ responses\nprobably would not have satisfied Leibniz and Mersenne, but we can\nappreciate how they have a fundamental basis in his philosophical\nsystem. \n\nPerhaps the most famous objection to the ontological argument is that\nexistence is not a property or predicate. Popularized by Kant, this\nobjection enjoys the status of a slogan known by every undergraduate\nphilosophy major worth her salt. In claiming that existence is\nincluded in the idea of a supremely perfect being, along with all the\nother divine attributes, Descartes’ version of the argument appears to\nsuccumb to this objection. \n\nIt is not obvious of course that existence is not a\npredicate. To convince us of this point, Kant observes that there is\nno intrinsic difference between the concept of a hundred real thalers\n(coins common in Kant’s time) and the concept of a hundred possible\nthalers. Whenever we think of anything, we regard it as\nexisting, even if the thing in question does not actually exist. Thus,\nexistence does not add anything to the concept of a thing. What then\nis existence if not a predicate? Kant’s answer is that existence is\n“merely the positing of a thing” or “the copula of a\njudgment,” the point being that when we say “God\nexists” we are simply affirming that there is an object\nanswering to the concept of God. We are not ascribing any new\npredicates to God, but merely judging that there is a subject, with\nall its predicates, in the world (CPR:B626–27). \n\nKant’s formulation of the objection was later refined by Bertrand\nRussell in his famous theory of descriptions. He argues that\nexistential statements such as “God exists” are misleading\nas to their logical form. While serving grammatically as a predicate,\nthe term “exists” in this sentence has a much different\nlogical function, which is revealed only by analysis. Properly\nanalyzed, “God exists” means “there is one (and only\none) x such that ‘x is omnipotent, omniscient, etc.’ is\ntrue.” Russell thinks this translation shows that, appearances\nto the contrary, the statement “God exists” is not\nascribing existence to a subject, but asserting that a certain\ndescription (in single quotes) applies to something in reality.\nRussell’s view is reflected in the standard modern logical treatment\nof existence as a quantifier rather than a predicate. \n\nIt is widely believed that Descartes did not have a response to this\nobjection, indeed that he blithely assumed that existence is a\nproperty without ever considering the matter carefully. But this is\nnot the case. The seventeenth-century empiricist Pierre Gassendi\nconfronted Descartes with this criticism in the Fifth Set of\nObjections (and deserves credit for being the first to enunciate it):\n“existence is not a perfection either in God or in anything\nelse; it is that without which no perfections can be present”\n(AT 7:323; CSM 2:224). As with most of his replies to Gassendi (whom\nhe regarded as a loathsome materialist and quibbler), Descartes\nresponded somewhat curtly. But it is clear from the discussion in\nsection 2 that he had the resources for addressing this objection in a\nsystematic manner. \n\nBefore examining how Descartes might defend himself, it is important\nto note that the question at issue is typically framed in non-Cartesian\nterms and thus often misses its target. Both Kant and Russell for\nexample are interested in the logical issue of whether existence is a\npredicate. Descartes, in contrast, was not a logician and\ndisparaged the standard subject-predicate logic inherited from\nAristotle. Although, as discussed above, he sometimes presents formal\nversions of the ontological arguments as heuristic devices, Descartes\nthought that God’s existence is ultimately known through intuition.\nThis intuitive process is psychological in character. It is not a\nmatter of assigning predicates to subjects but of determining whether\nthe idea of a supremely perfect being can be clearly and distinctly\nperceived while excluding necessary existence from it through a purely\nintellectual operation. To be sure, Descartes was interested in the\nontological question of whether existence is a\n“property” of substances. For him, however, the analogues\nof properties are clear and distinct ideas and ways of regarding them,\nnot predicates. \n\nHaving said that, Descartes’ best strategy for answering the\nontological version of the objection is to concede it, or at least\ncertain aspects of it. Descartes explicitly affirms Kant’s point that\nexistence does not add anything to the idea of something (provided\nthat the terms “idea” and “concept” are\nregarded as psychological items).  Once again we should recall passage\n[4] from the Second Replies: “Existence is contained in the idea\nor concept of every single thing, since we cannot conceive of anything\nexcept as existing” (Axiom 10, AT 7:166; CSM 2:117). So,\nDescartes agrees with Kant that there is no conceptual difference\nbetween conceiving of a given substance as actually existing and\nconceiving it as merely possible. In the first instance one is\nattending to the existence that is contained in every clear and\ndistinct idea, and in the other instance one is ignoring the thing’s\nexistence without actively excluding it. He would, however, stress\nanother conceptual difference that Kant and other critics do not\naddress, namely that between the two grades of existence —\ncontingent and necessary. The clear and distinct ideas of all finite\nthings contain merely contingent or dependent existence, whereas the\nclear and distinct idea of God uniquely contains necessary or wholly\nindependent existence (ibid.). As discussed previously, the\nontological argument hinges on this distinction. \n\nAnother intuition underlying the claim that existence is not a\nproperty is that there is more intimate connection between an\nindividual and its existence than the traditional one between a\nsubstance and a property, especially if the property in question is\nconceived as something accidental. If existence were accidental, then a\nthing could be without its existence, which seems absurd. It seems no\nless absurd to say that existence is a property among other properties\n(accidental or essential), for how can a thing even have properties if\nit does not exist? Descartes shares this intuition. He does not think\nthat existence is a property in the traditional sense or is even\ndistinct from the substance that is said to bear it. Recall the view\ndiscussed in section 2 that there is merely a rational distinction\nbetween a substance and its existence, or between the essence and\nexistence of a substance. This means that the distinction between a\nsubstance and its existence is confined to thought or reason. Human\nbeings, in their efforts to understand things using their finite\nintellects, draw distinctions in thought that do not obtain in reality.\nIn reality, a substance (whether created or divine) just is its\nexistence. \n\nThe purpose of this defense of Descartes is not to render a verdict\nas whether he has the correct account of existence, but to show that he\nhas a rather sophisticated and systematic treatment of what has been\none of the great bugbears in the history of philosophy. He does not\nmake the ad hoc assumption that existence is an attribute in\norder to serve the needs of the ontological argument. Indeed, on\nDescartes’ view, existence is not a property in the traditional sense,\nnor can one conceive of something without regarding it as existing.\nDescartes’ critics might not be convinced by his account of existence,\nbut then they have the burden of providing a better account. The focus\nof the debate will then be shifted to the question of who has the\ncorrect ontology, rather than whether the ontological argument is sound.","contact.mail":"lawrence.nolan@csulb.edu","contact.domain":"csulb.edu"}]
