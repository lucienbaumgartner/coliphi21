Preferences and their\nlogical properties also have a central role in rational choice theory,\na subject that in its turn permeates modern economics, as well as\nother branches of formalized social science. The notion of preference\nand the way it is analysed vary between these disciplines. A treatment\nis still lacking that takes into account the needs of all usages and\ntries to combine them in a unified approach. This entry surveys the\nmost important philosophical uses of the preference concept and\ninvestigates their compatibilities and conflicts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn common parlance, the term \"preference\" assumes different meanings,\nincluding that of comparative evaluation, prioritisation or favouring,\nand choice ranking (See for instance the Oxford English\nDictionary). In this entry, we discuss the notion of preference\nas subjective comparative evaluations, of the form\n“Agent A prefers X to Y”. This\ncharacterisation distinguishes preference from other evaluative\nconcepts.  \nPreferences are evaluations: they concern matters of value,\ntypically in relation to practical reasoning, i.e. questions about what\nshould be done. This distinguishes preferences from concepts that\nconcern matters of fact.  \nFurthermore, preferences are subjective in that the\nevaluation is typically attributed to an agent – where this\nagent might be either an individual or a collective. This\ndistinguishes them from statements to the effect that\n“X is better than Y” in an objective\nsense. The logic of preference has often also been used to represent\nsuch objective evaluations (e.g. Broome 1991b), but the substantial\nnotion of preference includes this subjective element.  \nFinally, preferences are comparative in that they express the\nevaluation of an item X  relative to another item\nY. This distinguishes them from monadic concepts like\n“good”, “is desired”, etc. which only evaluate\none item.  \nMost philosophers take the evaluated items to be propositions. In\ncontrast to this, economists commonly conceive of items as bundles of\n goods.[1] \nThey are represented as vectors, where each position in the\nvector represents a specific good, and the scalar at that position\ndenotes the number of units of that good. For convenience, economists\noften operate in two-goods worlds, where one good—the\nnumeraire—stands for all the other goods (money is the\nmost common numeraire). However, this approach has a difficult ambiguity. If\npreferences are subjective evaluations of the alternatives, then what\nmatters are the results that can be obtained with the help of these\ngoods, not the goods themselves. Whether an agent has a preference\ne.g. for a batch of wood over a crate of bricks will depend on whether\nshe intends to use it to generate warmth, build a shelter or create a\nsculpture. Economists have tried to solve this ambiguity by coupling\npreferences over goods with household production functions (Lancaster\n1966, Becker and Michael 1973); but as these components are very\ndifficult to determine, it is often thought more parsimonious to stick\nwith the sentential or propositional representations of states of the\nworld.  \nSerious engagement with preferences began in the 20th\ncentury. In the social sciences, the preference concept became\nimportant for explanatory and predictive purposes with Irving\nFisher’s (1892) and Vilfredo Pareto’s (1909)\nmethodological criticisms of hedonistic cardinal utility. Previously,\neconomists largely agreed that decisions were motivated by the\nindividual’s quest for pleasure, and that the difference in\nquantity of pleasure derived from different alternatives was an\nimportant influence on decisions. In that framework, the notion of\npreference, to the extent that it was used at all, was merely derived\nfrom hedonistic utility: X is preferred to Y iff\nX yields more utility than Y. Pareto argued that\nbecause an accurate measurement procedure for cardinal hedonic utility\nwas not available, social scientists should constrain themselves to\nmerely ordinal comparisons (Bruni and Guala 2001). This argument\nturned preference into a fundamental notion of the social sciences,\nreplacing (hedonic) utility.  \nEconomists in the 1930s (Hicks and Allen 1934) radicalised\nPareto’s idea and argued that cardinal utility should be\nexcluded in order to expunge economics from psychological hedonism.\nHowever, their concept of preference retained psychological content:\npeople are assumed to act purposefully and therefore to have\npreferences that really constitute mental evaluations, rather than\nbeing ex-post rationalisations of behaviour (Lewin 1996). Furthermore,\nRamsey (1926) and later von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944) devised\nformal tools allowing the representation of preference magnitudes as\nutility functions. This new utility, however, was very different from\nthe older hedonic concept: here the preference concept is basic, and\nthe cardinal utility function merely derived.  \nPsychologists also sought to move away from the old psychophysical\nassumptions and began seeing mental concepts like preferences with\nincreased suspicion. Instead, they sought not only to connect and\nmeasure psychological events, but indeed replace them by the\nbehavioural criteria with which they were hitherto connected. (See the\nentry on\n behaviorism).\n Again, it was an economist, Paul Samuelson, who formulated this\nprinciple most explicitly for the concept of preference. In 1938 he\nsuggested to “start anew … dropping off the last vestiges\nof the utility analysis” (1938, pp. 61–62). Preferences\nwere supposed to be defined in terms of choice, thus eliminating\nreference to mental states altogether. Although this approach was highly influential at\nthe time, economists have largely not followed Samuelson in this\nradical proposal (Hausman 2012), and it might indeed be the case that\nSamuelson himself later changed his mind (Hands 2014). With the\nincreasing convergence of (parts of) economics and psychology, the\nordinal psychological interpretation of preferences appears to\ncurrently dominate in these disciplines. However, there is an ongoing\ndiscussion amongst philosophers whether the current concept of\npreference used by economists is this mental,\n“folk-theoretic” notion or a seperate theoretical concept\n(Mäki 2000, Ross 2014).  \nIn philosophy, the concept of preference gained increased attention in\nthe wake of the conceptual developments in the social sciences.\nBecause the hedonic utility notion was increasingly questioned,\nutilitarian philosophers sought alternative foundations for their\nethical theories. Today, preferentialism defends satisfaction\nof individual preferences as the only intrinsic value bearer, and thus\nis a subcategory of the broad welfarist family of value theories,\nwhich identify intrinsic value with well-being. Few people defend the\nview that well-being is constituted by the satisfaction of\nany preference, but a number of authors defend refined\nversions of preferentialism (e.g. Rawls 1971, Scanlon 1998).\nPhilosophers have also discussed the formal properties of preferences\nin preference logic. To this we turn in the next section.\n \nAlthough not all philosophical references to preference make use of\nformal tools, preferences are almost always assumed to have structural\nproperties of a type that is best described in a formalized language.\nThe study of the structural properties of preferences can be traced\nback to Book III of Aristotle’s Topics. Since the early\ntwentieth century several philosophers have studied the structure of\npreferences with logical tools. In 1957 and in 1963, respectively,\nSören Halldén and Georg Henrik von Wright proposed the\nfirst complete systems of preference logic (Halldén 1957, von\nWright 1963). The subject also has important roots in utility theory\nand in the theory of games and decisions. The preferences studied in\npreference logic are usually the preferences of rational individuals,\nbut preference logic is also used in psychology and behavioural\neconomics, where the emphasis is on actual preferences as revealed in\nbehaviour. \nThere are two fundamental comparative value concepts, namely\n“better” (strict preference) and “equal in value\nto” (indifference) (Halldén 1957, 10). These terms are\nused to express the wishes of persons, but they are also used for\nother purposes, for instance to express objective or intersubjectively\nvalid betterness that does not coincide with the pattern of wishes of\nany individual person. However, the structural (logical) properties of\nbetterness and value equality do not seem to differ between the cases\nwhen they correspond to what we usually call “preferences”\nand the cases when they do not. The term “preference\nlogic” is standardly used to cover the logic of these concepts\neven in cases when we would typically not use the term\n“preference” in a non-formalized context. \nThe relations of preference and indifference between alternatives are\nusually denoted by the symbols ≻ and ∼ or alternatively by\nP and I. In accordance with a long-standing\nphilosophical tradition, A≻B is taken to\nrepresent “B is worse than A”, as well\nas “A is better than B”. \nThe following four properties of the two exclusionary comparative\nrelations are usually taken to be part of the meaning of the concepts\nof (strict) preference and indifference: \n(1) A≻B →\n¬(B≻A)    (asymmetry of\npreference)\n \n(2) A∼B → B∼A\n   (symmetry of indifference)\n \n(3) A∼A    (reflexivity of\nindifference)\n \n(4) A≻B →\n¬(A∼B)\n   (incompatibility of preference and\nindifference)\n \nIt follows from (1) that strict preference is irreflexive, i.e. that\n¬(A≻A). \nThe relation ≽, “at least as good as” (or more\nprecisely: “better than or equal in value to”), can be\ndefined as follows: \nA≽B ↔ A≻B ∨\nA∼B    (weak preference)\n \nThe alternative notation R is sometimes used instead of\n≽. \nFor reasons of convenience, weak preference is usually taken to be the\nprimitive relation of preference logic. Then both (strict) preference\nand indifference are introduced as derived relations, as follows: \nA≻B if and only if A≽B\nand ¬(B≽A)\n \nA∼B if and only if A≽B\nand B≽A\n \n≻ is the strict part of ≽ and ∼ its\nsymmetric part. \nTwo common notational conventions should be mentioned. First, chains\nof relations can be contracted. Hence,\nA≽B≽C abbreviates\nA≽B ∧ B≽C, and\nA≻B≻C∼D\nabbreviates A≻B ∧\nB≻C ∧ C∼D. Second,\nthe ancestral symbol * is used to contract repeated uses of the same\nrelation; hence ≻* stands for ≻ repeated any finite\nnon-zero number of times (and similarly for the other relations). Thus\nA≻*C denotes that either\nA≻C or there are B1\n… Bn such that\nA≻B1 ∧\nB1≻B2 ∧ …\nBn−1≻Bn\n∧ Bn≻C. \nIn most applications of preference logic, it is taken for granted that\nthe following property, called completeness or\nconnectedness, should be satisfied: \nA≽B ∨ B≽A\n \nor equivalently: \nA≻B ∨ A∼B ∨\nB≻A\n \nThe following weaker version of the property is sometimes useful:  \nIf A≠B, then A≽B ∨\nB≽A (weak connectivity)\n (Completeness holds if and only if both weak\nconnectivity and reflexivity of indifference hold.)\n \nCompleteness (connectedness) is commonly assumed in many applications,\nnot least in economics. Bayesian decision theory is a case in point.\nThe Bayesian decision maker is assumed to make her choices in\naccordance with a complete preference ordering over the available\noptions. However, in many everyday cases, we do not have, and do not\nneed, complete preferences. Consider a person who has to choose\nbetween five objects A, B, C, D,\nand E. If she knows that she prefers A to the\nothers, she does not have to make up her mind about the relative\nranking among B, C, D, and E. \nIn terms of resolvability, there are three major types of preference\nincompleteness. First, incompleteness may be uniquely\nresolvable, i.e. resolvable in exactly one way. The most natural\nreason for this type of incompleteness is lack of knowledge or\nreflection. Behind what we perceive as an incomplete preference\nrelation there may be a complete preference relation that we can\narrive at through observation, introspection, logical inference, or\nsome other means of discovery.  \nSecondly, incompleteness may be multiply resolvable, i.e.\npossible to resolve in several different ways. In this case it is\ngenuinely undetermined what will be the outcome of extending the\nrelation to cover the previously uncovered cases. \nThirdly, incompleteness may be irresolvable. The most natural\nreason for this is that the alternatives differ in terms of advantages\nor disadvantages that we are unable to put on the same footing. A\nperson may be unable to say which she prefers—the death of two\nspecified acquaintances or the death of a specified friend. She may\nalso be unable to say whether she prefers the destruction of the\npyramids in Giza or the extinction of the giant panda. In\nenvironmental economics, as a third example, it is a controversial\nissue whether and to what extent environmental damage is comparable to\nmonetary loss. \nTwo alternatives are called “incommensurable” whenever it\nis impossible to measure them with the same unit of measurement. Cases\nof irresolvable incompleteness are often also cases of\nincommensurability (Chang 1997). In moral philosophy, irresolvable\nincompleteness is usually discussed in terms of the related notion of\na moral dilemma. \nBy far the most discussed logical property of preferences is the\nfollowing: \nA≽B ∧ B≽C →\nA≽C    (transitivity of\nweak preference)\n \nThe corresponding properties of the other two relations are defined\nanalogously: \nA∼B ∧ B∼C →\nA∼C    (transitivity of\nindifference)\n \nA≻B ∧ B≻C →\nA≻C    (transitivity of\nstrict preference)\n \nA weak preference relation ≽ is called quasi-transitive\nif its strict part ≻ is transitive. \nMany other properties have been defined that are related to\ntransitivity. The following three are among the most important of\nthese: \nA∼B ∧ B≻C →\nA≻C\n   (IP-transitivity)\n \nA≻B ∧ B∼C →\nA≻C\n   (PI-transitivity)\n \nThere is no series\nA1,…,An of\nalternatives such that A1\n≻…≻An≻A1\n   (acyclicity)\n \nAll of these are weakenings of the transitivity of ≽. In other\nwords, if ≽ satisfies transitivity then ≻  and ∼\nare also transitive, and furthermore, IP-transitivity, PI-transitivity\nand acyclicity hold. \nFurthermore, if ≽ is transitive, then no cycles containing\n≻ are possible, i.e. there are no A and B such\nthat A≽*B≻A. Preferences with\nsuch a ≻-containing cycle are called cyclic\npreferences. \nTransitivity is a controversial property, and many examples have been\noffered to show that it does not hold in general. A classic type of\ncounterexample to transitivity is the so-called Sorites Paradox. It\nemploys a series of objects that are so arranged that we cannot\ndistinguish between two adjacent members of the series, whereas we can\ndistinguish between members at greater distance (Armstrong 1939,\nArmstrong 1948, Luce 1956). Consider 1000 cups of coffee, numbered\nC0, C1,\nC2, … up to C999. Cup\nC0 contains no sugar, cup C1\none grain of sugar, cup C2 two grains etc. Since\none cannot taste the difference between C999 and\nC998, one might consider them to be equally good\n(of equal value),\nC999∼C998. For the same\nreason, we have C998∼C997,\netc. all the way up to\nC1∼C0, but clearly\nC0 ≻ C999. This\ncontradicts transitivity of indifference, and therefore also\ntransitivity of weak preference. \nIn a famous example proposed by Warren S. Quinn, a device has been\nimplanted into the body of a person (the self-torturer). The device\nhas 1001 settings, from 0 (off) to 1000. Each increase leads to a\nnegligible increase in pain. Each week, the self-torturer “has\nonly two options—to stay put or to advance the dial one setting.\nBut he may advance only one step each week, and he may never\nretreat. At each advance he gets $10,000.” In this way\nhe may “eventually reach settings that will be so painful that\nhe would then gladly relinquish his fortune and return to 0”\n(Quinn 1990, 79). \nIn an important type of counterexample to transitivity of strict\npreference, different properties of the alternatives dominate in\ndifferent pairwise comparisons. Consider an agent choosing between\nthree boxes of Christmas ornaments (Schumm 1987). Each box contains\nthree balls, coloured red, blue and green, respectively; they are\nrepresented by the vectors\n〈R1,G1,B1〉,\n〈R2,G2,B2〉,\nand\n〈R3,G3,B3〉.\nThe agent strictly prefers box 1 to box 2, since they contain (to her)\nequally attractive blue and green balls, but the red ball of box 1 is\nmore attractive than that of box 2. She prefers box 2 to box 3, since\nthey are equal but for the green ball of box 2, which is more\nattractive than that of box 3. And finally, she prefers box 3 to box\n1, since they are equal but for the blue ball of box 3, which is more\nattractive than that of box 1. Thus, \nR1≻R2∼R3∼R1,\nG1∼G2≻G3∼G1,\nB1∼B2∼B3≻B1;\nand\n\n〈R1,G1,B1〉≻〈R2,G2,B2〉≻〈R3,G3,B3〉≻〈R1,G1,B1〉.\n \nThe described situation yields a preference cycle, which contradicts\ntransitivity of strict preference. (Notice the structural similarity\nto Condorcet’s Paradox, see the entry on\n voting methods.) \nThese and similar examples can be used to show that actual human\nbeings may have cyclic preferences. It does not necessarily follow,\nhowever, that the same applies to the idealized rational\nagents of preference logic. Perhaps such patterns are due to\nirrationality or to factors, such as lack of knowledge or\ndiscrimination, that prevent actual humans from being rational. There\nis a strong tradition, not least in economic applications, to regard\nfull ≽-transitivity as a necessary prerequisite of\nrationality. \nThe most famous argument in favour of preference transitivity is the\nmoney pump argument. The basic idea was developed by F.P. Ramsey\n(1928a, 182), who pointed out that if a subject’s behaviour\nviolated axioms of probability and preference, then “[h]e could\nhave a book made against him by a cunning better and would then stand\nto lose in any event”. The argument is developed in more detail\nin Davidson et al. (1955).  \nThe following example can be used to show how the argument works in a\nnon-probabilistic context: A certain stamp-collector\nhas cyclic preferences with respect to three stamps, denoted\nA, B, and C. She prefers A to\nB, B to C, and C to A.\nFollowing Ramsey, we may assume that there is an amount of money, say\n10 cents, that she is prepared to pay for exchanging B for\nA, C for B, or A for C.\nShe comes into a stamp shop with stamp A. The stamp-dealer\noffers her to trade in A for C, if she pays 10\ncents. She accepts the deal. \nFor a precise notation, let 〈X,V〉 denote\nthat the collector owns stamp X and has paid V cents\nto the dealer. She has now moved from the state\n〈A,0〉 to the state 〈C,10〉. \nNext, the stamp-dealer takes out stamp B from a drawer, and\noffers her to swap C for B, against another payment\nof 10 cents. She accepts, thus moving from the state\n〈C,10〉 to 〈B,20〉. The shop-owner\ncan go on like this forever. What causes the trouble is the following\nsequence of preferences: \n〈C,10〉 ≻ 〈A,0〉\n\n〈B,20〉 ≻ 〈C,10〉\n\n〈A,30〉 ≻ 〈B,20〉\n\n〈C,40〉 ≻ 〈A,30〉\n\n〈B,50〉 ≻ 〈C,40〉\n\n〈A,60〉 ≻ 〈B,50〉\n\n…\n \nThe money-pump argument relies on a particular, far from\nuncontroversial, way to combine preferences in two dimensions, which\nis only possible if two crucial assumptions are satisfied: (1) The\nprimary alternatives (the stamps) can be combined with some other\ncommodity (money) to form composite alternatives. (2) Irrespectively\nof the previous transactions there is always, for each preferred\nchange of primary alternatives, some non-zero loss of the auxiliary\ncommodity (money) that is worth that change. The money-pump can be\nused to extract money from a subject with cyclic preferences only if\nthese two conditions are satisfied. \nAnother argument for the normative appropriateness of preference\ntransitivity suggests that transitivity is constitutive of the meaning\nof preference, in addition to the minimal properties mentioned in\nsection 2.1. Drawing an analogy to length measurement, Davidson (1976,\n273) asks: “If length is not transitive, what does it mean to\nuse a number to measure length at all? We could find or invent an\nanswer, but unless or until we do, we must strive to interpret\n‘longer than’ so that it comes out transitive. Similarly\nfor ‘preferred to’”. Violating transitivity,\nDavidson claims, thus undermines the very meaning of preferring on\noption over others.  \nYet another argument rests on the importance of preferences for\nchoice. When agents choose at once from all the elements of an\nalternative set, then preferences should be choice guiding.\nThey should have such a structure that they can be used to guide our\nchoice among the elements of that set. But when choosing e.g. from\n{A,B,C}, a preference relation ≻ such that\nA≻B≻C≻A does not\nguide choice at all: any or none of the alternatives should be chosen\naccording to ≻. The transitivity of preference, it is therefore\nsuggested, is a necessary condition for a meaningful connection\nbetween preferences and choice. A critic, however, can point out that\npreferences are important even when they cannot guide choices. Take\ne.g. preferences over lottery outcomes: these are real preferences,\nregardless of the fact that one cannot choose between lottery\noutcomes. Further, the necessary criteria for choice guidance are much\nweaker than weak transitivity (Hansson 2001, 23–25; compare also\nversions of decision theory in which transitivity fails, e.g. Fishburn\n1991). Last, the indifference relation does not satisfy choice\nguidance either. That does not make it irrational to be indifferent\nbetween alternatives. Thus choice guidance can be an argument for the\nnormative appropriateness of transitivity only under certain\nrestrictions, if at all (For further discussion, see Anand 1993).  \nOne more property of preference relations needs to be specified. A\nrelation is antisymmetric if \nA≽B ∧ B≽A →\nA=B    (antisymmetry of\npreference)\n \nThe categories summarized in the table below (based on Sen 1970a) are\nstandardly used to denominate preference relations that satisfy\ncertain logical properties. \nSections 2.1–2.4 were devoted to exclusionary preferences, i.e.\npreferences that refer to a set of mutually exclusive alternatives. In\npractice, people also have preferences between relata that are not\nmutually exclusive. These are called combinative preferences.\n \nRelata of combinative preferences typically are not specified enough\nto be mutually exclusive. To say that one prefers having a dog over\nhaving a cat does neglect the possibility that one may have both at\nthe same time. Depending on how one interprets it, this preference\nexpression may say very different things. It may mean that one prefers\na dog (and no cat) to a cat (and no dog). Or, if one already has a\ncat, it may mean that one prefers a dog and a cat to just having a\ncat. Or, if one already has a dog, it may mean that one prefers just a\ndog to both a cat and a dog. Combinative preferences are usually taken\nto have states of affairs as their relata. These are represented by\nsentences in sentential logic. It is usually assumed that logically\nequivalent expressions can be substituted for each other. \nProperties such as completeness, transitivity and acyclicity can be\ntransferred from exclusionary to combinative preferences. In addition,\nthere are interesting logical properties that can be expressed with\ncombinative preferences but not with exclusionary preferences. The\nfollowing are some examples of these (some of which are\ncontroversial): \np≽q →\np≽(p∨q)≽q\n   (disjunctive interpolation)\n \np≽q →\n¬q≽¬p\n   (contraposition of weak preference)\n \np∼q → ¬q∼¬p\n   (contraposition of indifference)\n \np≻q → ¬q≻\n¬p    (contraposition of strict\npreference)\n \np≽q ↔\n(p∧¬q)≽(q∧¬p)\n   (conjunctive expansion of weak preference)\n \np≻q ↔\n(p∧¬q)≻(q∧¬p)\n   (conjunctive expansion of strict\npreference)\n \np∼q ↔\n(p∧¬q)∼(q∧¬p)\n   (conjunctive expansion of indifference)\n \n(p∨q)≽r ↔\np≽r ∧ q≽r\n   (left disjunctive distribution of ≽)\n \np≽(q∨r) ↔\np≽q ∧ p≽r\n   (right disjunctive distribution of ≽)\n \nCombinative preferences can be derived from exclusionary preferences,\nwhich are then taken to be more basic. In most variants of this\napproach, the underlying alternatives (to which the exclusionary\npreferences refer) have been possible worlds, represented by maximal\nconsistent subsets of the language (Rescher 1967, von Wright 1972). \nHowever, it has been argued that a more realistic\napproach should be based on smaller alternatives that cover all the\naspects under consideration – but not all the aspects that might\nhave been considered. This approach may be seen as an application of\nSimon’s “bounded rationality view” (Simon 1957,\n196–200). \nThe derivation of combinative preferences from exclusionary\npreferences can be produced with a representation function. By this is\nmeant a function f that takes us from a pair\n〈p,q〉 of sentences to a set\nf(〈p,q〉) of pairs of alternatives\n(perhaps possible worlds). Then\np≽fq holds if and only if\nA≽B for all 〈A,B〉\n∈ f(〈p,q〉) (Hansson 2001,\n70–73). \nIn addition to the comparative notions, “better” and\n“of equal value”, informal discourse on values contains\nmonadic (one-place) value predicates, such as “good”,\n“best”, “very bad”, “fairly good”,\netc. Predicates representing these notions can be inserted into a\nformal structure that contains a preference relation. \nTwo major attempts have been made to define the principal monadic\npredicates “good” and “bad” in terms of the\npreference relation. One of these defines “good” as\n“better than its negation” and “bad” as\n“worse than its negation” (Brogan 1919). \nGN p ↔ p≻¬p\n   (negation-related good)\n \nBN p ↔ ¬p≻p\n   (negation-related bad)\n \nThe other definition requires that we introduce, prior to\n“good” and “bad”, a set of neutral\npropositions. Goodness is predicated of everything that is better than\nsome neutral proposition, and badness of everything that is worse than\nsome neutral proposition. The best-known variant of this approach was\nproposed by Chisholm and Sosa (1966). According to these authors, a\nstate of affairs is indifferent if and only if it is neither better\nnor worse than its negation. Furthermore, a state of affairs is good\nif and only if it is better than some indifferent state of affairs,\nand bad if and only if some indifferent state of affairs is better\nthan it. \nGI p ↔\n(∃q)(p≻q∼¬q)\n   (indifference-related good)\n \nBI p ↔\n(∃q)(¬q∼q≻p)\n   (indifference-related bad)\n \nThe negation-related and the indifference-related “good”\nrespectively “bad” do not necessarily coincide. Both\ndefinitions have been developed with complete preference relations in\nmind, but extensions are available that cover the more general cases.\n(Hansson 2001) \nA proposal for defining preferences in terms of the monadic predicates\nfor “good” and “bad” was put forward by van\nBenthem (1982, p. 195). It assumes that goodness and badness are\ndefined in relation to an alternative set, so that for instance\nG{x,y}x means that x is\ngood among the alternatives in {x,y} and\nB{x,z,w}x that x is bad\namong the alternatives in {x,z,w}. This gives rise to the\nfollowing definitions:  \nx ≻ y if and only if\nG{x,y}x &\n¬G{x,y}y (goodness-based\npreference)\n \nx ≻ y if and only if\nB{x,y}y &\n¬B{x,y}x (badness-based\npreference)\n \nHowever, these two definitions are not equivalent, and neither of them\nis plausible in all cases. For instance, let x be good and\nnot bad in the context {x,y}, and let y be neither\ngood nor bad in the same context. Then x ≻ y\nholds according to first definition but ¬(x ≻\ny) according to the second. To avoid such problems, Hansson\nand Liu (2014) proposed the following definition:  \nx ≻ y if and only if either\nG{x,y}x &\n¬G{x,y}y or\nB{x,y}y &\n¬B{x,y}x (bivalently based\npreference)\n \nPreferences can be represented numerically.\nA≻B is then expressed by a numerical utility\nfunction u that assigns a higher value to A than to\nB, while A∼B is represented by\nassigning the same value to the two. Such numerical representations\nmight serve different purposes, one being that utility functions can\nbe analysed with the tools of maximisation under constraints, as done\nin economics. It is important, however, to stress the limitations of\nsuch representations. First, not all preferences can be represented\nnumerically. Second, there are different scales by which preferences\ncan be represented, which require premises of different strengths.\nThird, the resulting utility representation must be clearly\ndistinguished from the older hedonistic concept of utility.  \nThe simplest form of numerical representation stipulates the following\nequivalence:  \nA≻B iff\nu(A)>u(B)\n   (Ordinal representation)\n \nAny function u that assigns a larger number to A\nthan to B will work as such a representation. Consequently,\nthe function u can be replaced with any function\nu’ as long as u’ is a positive\nmonotone transformation of u. As this transformation\nproperty is the defining characteristic of ordinal scales, we\ncall this an ordinal preference representation (See the entry on\n  measurement in science.) \nA preference relation has an ordinal representation only if it\nsatisfies both completeness and transitivity. However, even if\nA is finite, there can be\ncomplete and transitive preference relations on A\nthat cannot be represented by a utility\nfunction (for a counter-example based on a lexicographic preference\nrelation, see Debreu\n 1954).[2] \nAn incomplete preference ordering also has a value\nrepresentation of the following type: \nIf A≻B, then\nu(A)>u(B)\n \nThe inverse is obviously not true. However, under fairly wide\ncircumstances, given the set of all utility functions thus\ndefined, one can find the preference relation (Aumann 1962).  \nOrdinal numerical representations of preference are just a convenient\ntool – they do not represent any information that cannot be\nrepresented by the relation ≻ itself. However, there is\nrelevant information about preferences that is not represented by the\nrelation ≻ itself. For example, when an agent expresses\ntwo preferences, say A≻B and\nC≻B, one might ask how much the agent\nprefers A to B, in particular in comparison how much\nshe prefers C to B. To answer this question, one\nneeds to determine both a measurement procedure for measuring\npreference intensities and a measurement scale for representing these\nmeasurements.  \nMeasurement scales that represent magnitudes of intervals between\nproperties, or even magnitudes of ratios between properties, are\ncalled cardinal scales. Although the discussion in the social\nsciences often merely distinguishes between ordinal and cardinal\npreference measures, it is important to further distinguish between\ninterval and ratio scales among the latter, as these require different\nassumptions to hold. An interval scale allows for meaningful\ncomparisons of differences. (43 °C is as much hotter than 41\n°C as 29 °C is hotter than 27 °C.) In addition, a ratio\nscale is allows for meaningful comparisons of ratios. (12 m is twice\nas long as 6 m.) Although there have been some attempts to measure\npreferences on a ratio scale (in particular, see Kahneman and\nTversky’s (1979) Prospect Theory, which requires a\nnatural zero point and thus a ratio scale), most efforts have focussed\non measuring preferences on an interval scale.  \nThe basic idea of interval preference measurement is to assume that\nacts have uncertain consequences, and that each act is equivalent to a\nlottery between these outcomes. An agent who expresses a preference\nfor an act over others by choosing it thus expresses a preference for\nthe equivalent lottery over the lotteries equivalent to other acts.\nThe utilities of these acts are then determined as the expected\nutilities of the equivalent lotteries, calculated as the\nprobability-weighted average of the lottery’s consequences. This\napproach was pioneered by Ramsey (1928) and refined by von Neumann and\nMorgenstern (1944); other approaches have been presented by Savage\n(1954/72) and Jeffrey (1965/90). There are substantial differences\nbetween these approaches and their respective assumptions. For more\ndetail, see\n decision theory. \nAs mentioned in section 3.1, all transitive and complete preference\nrelations can be represented by a utility function according to the\nfollowing simple relationship \nA≻B iff\nu(A)\n>\nu(B)\n \nHowever, as can be seen from the Sorites paradox discussed in section\n2.3, this recipe for the representation of preferences is too\ndemanding for some purposes. If u(A)>\nu(B), but\nu(A)-u(B) is so small that it\ncannot be discerned, then A≻B cannot be\nexpected to hold. One way to represent this feature is to employ a\ncardinal utility function and to introduce a fixed limit of\nindiscernibility, such that A≻B holds if and\nonly if u(A)−u(B) is larger\nthan that limit. Such a limit is commonly called a just noticeable\ndifference (JND). \nA≻B iff\nu(A)−u(B)>δ,\n   (JND representation, δ>0)\n \nIf the set of alternatives is finite, then ≽ has a JND\nrepresentation if and only if ≽ is complete, and satisfies the\ntwo properties that for all\nA,B,C,D:\nA≻B ∧ B≻C →\nA≻D ∨ D≻C and\nA≻B ∧ C≻D →\nA≻D ∨ C≻B. \nAnother interesting construction is to assign to each alternative an\ninterval instead of a single number. This requires two real-valued\nfunctions, umax and umin, such\nthat for all A, umax(A)≥\numin(A). Here,\numax(A) represents the upper limit of the\ninterval assigned to A, and\numin(A) its lower limit. A\n≻B holds if and only if all elements of the interval\nassigned to A have higher value than all elements of the\nB interval: \nA≻B iff\numin(A)>\numax(B)    (Interval\nrepresentation)\n \nIt has been shown that a preference relation ≽ has an interval\nrepresentation if and only if it satisfies completeness and the\nproperty that for all A,B,C,D:\nA≻B ∧ C≻D →\nA≻D ∨ C≻B. \nA final generalization is to let the threshold of discrimination\ndepend on both relata. \nA≻B iff\nu(A)−u(B)>σ(A,\nB)    (Doubly variable threshold\nrepresentation, σ(A,B)>0)\n \nIf the set of alternatives is finite, then ≽ has a doubly\nvariable threshold representation if and only if it satisfies\nacyclicity. \nFor more details on these representations, see Scott and Suppes (1958)\nand Abbas (1995)  \nIn practical decision making, there are often several preference\nrelations that have to be taken into account. The different preference\nrelations represent different aspects of the subject matter concerned\nby the decision. For instance, when choosing among alternative\narchitectural designs for a new building, we will have a whole set of\naspects, each of which can be expressed with a preference relation:\ncosts, sustainability, aesthetics, fire safety etc. In some cases, the\nvarious preference relations represent the wishes or interests of\ndifferent persons. This applies for instance when a group of people\nwith different preferences plan a joint vacation trip.  \nThe most convenient way to represent problems with multiple preference\naspects is to introduce a vector 〈\n≽1,…,≽n 〉 whose\nelements are the preference relations we have to take into account.\nFor simplicity, we can assume that all these preferences are complete\n(or we can treat incompleteness as indifference). We can call such a\nvector conflict free if and only if it has no elements\n≽k and ≽m such\nthat X ≻kY and Y\n≻mX for any alternatives X\nand Y. If 〈\n≽1,…,≽n 〉 is\nconflict free, then we can define a combined preference relation\n≽ such that (1) X≻Y if there is some\n≽k such that\nX≻kY, (2)\nY≻X if there is some\n≽k such that\nY≻kX, and (3) otherwise\nX∼Y. This is a plausible construction for\nconflict free preferences, since the combined preference relation does\nnot contradict any of the strict preferences expressed in the\ncomponent vectors.  \nFor conflictual preference vectors, i.e. vectors that are not\nconflict free, there is no such simple solution that is plausible in\nall applications. There are four common ways to deal with conflicts\namong preferences. \n1. Reduction to a single dimension. Such reductions are\nusually performed by first translating all preference relations into\nsome numerical value, and then, for each alternative, adding up the\nvalues assigned to it for all aspects. In utilitarian moral\nphilosophy, a fictional value unit, “utile”, is used for\nthis purpose. In economics, monetary units are used. Such reductions\nare standardly used in cost-benefit analysis. However in many cases\nthere is uncertainty or disagreement on how the reductions should be\nperformed.  \n2. Assuming that all conflicts cancel each other out. This\namounts to extending the above definition of a combined preference\nrelation so that X∼Y will hold in all cases of\nconflict, i.e. whenever there are ≽k and\n≽m such that X\n≻kY and Y\n≻mX. Although usually not expressed\nin this way, this is the effect of applying efficiency as the sole\ncriterion (e.g. Pareto efficiency as the sole criterion in a\nmulti-person case). This method has the obvious disadvantage that it\nsometimes lets a small disadvantage in one dimension outweigh a large\nadvantage in another dimension.  \n3. Majoritarian solutions. Another way to deal with conflicts\nis to look for the alternatives that are favoured by most (although\nnot all) of the preference relations. This requires that the aspects\ncovered by the different preference relations are valued equally.\nTherefore, this solution is commonly used when the elements of the\nvector correspond to the wishes or interests of different persons, but\nnot when they correspond to more general aspects of a decision (such\nas sustainability and aesthetics in the example of of choosing an\narchitectural design).  \n4. Intuitive weighing. In practice, decision makers often\nweigh different preference dimensions against each other intuitively,\nwithout any prior attempt to reduce the multi-dimensionality of the\ndecision. This way of dealing with multiple preferences has practical\nadvantages, but it also has the disadvantage of lacking efficient\nmechanisms for ensuring consistency in decision-making.  \n5. Modifying at least one of the conflicting preference\nrelations. This is what happens when people involved in\nnegotiations or discussions approach each other’s views in ways that\nmake their preference relations less conflicting. The Delphi method is\na systematized procedure that can be used to reduce interindividual\ndifferences in preferences. On an intraindividual level, strivings for\na reflective equilibrium can take the form of adjusting preference\nrelations that concern different aspects of an issue to each\nother. From a psychological point of view, such changes can be\ndescribed as reductions of cognitive dissonance in value issues. \nVoting procedures are often described as methods for aggregating or\ncombining preferences. Such aggregation can also be performed by a\nbenevolent planner striving to take the wishes and/or interests of all\nconcerned persons into account. The aggregation of preferences is a\nmajor topic of social choice theory. See the entry on \n social choice theory. \nConsider again the choice among alternative architectural designs for\na new building. As indicated above, our preferences can be expressed\nwith a vector 〈\n≽1,…,≽n 〉, each of\nwhose elements represents our partial preferences with\nrespect to some particular aspect such as sustainability or\naesthetics. If we manage to aggregate the vector to a single\npreference relation ≽, then ≽ represents our total\npreferences, or, as they are also called, our “preferences\ntout court” or “preferences all things\nconsidered”.  \nSome authors have argued that the preference notion in economics\nalways refers to total preferences (Hausman 2012). However, there are\nalso economists who recognize partial preferences, often identifying\nthem with preferences over properties or characteristics of economic\ngoods (Lancaster 1966). In contrast, philosophers often treat partial\npreferences as referring to different reasons that one may have to\nprefer one of the options to another (Pettit 1991, Osherson and\nWeinstein 2012).  \nAuthors who recognize partial preferences usually give them priority,\nand consider total preferences to be completely determined by the\npartial preferences. In other words, they assume that a total\npreference relation is uniquely determined by the partial preference\nrelations through a process of aggregation. There are different views\non the nature of this process. According to a quantitative\napproach, each partial preference is connected with a cardinal partial\nutility function for the aspect in question, and the total preference\nrelation can be obtained by aggregating these partial utility\nfunctions using an appropriate set of weights. This requires strong\nassumptions of preference independence in order to justify additivity\nof utility (Keeney and Raiffa 1993).  \nAn alternative strategy employs tools from social choice\ntheory to map a vector of partial preferences into a total\npreference relation. This approach only makes use of ordinal\ninformation, and disregards any utility information that has no impact\non the partial preference relations. Unsurprisingly, the impossibility\nresults of social choice theory affect this method. Steedman and\nKrause (1986) have shown that there is no rule for deriving total\npreferences from a preference vector that satisfies four seemingly\nplausible conditions and also yields a transitive and complete total\npreference ordering. When applied to an intrapersonal conflict this\nmeans that an agent may be rational in the sense of having a complete\nand transitive (partial) relation for each of the aspects, but may\nstill be irrational either in the sense of not satisfying plausible\nconditions on the relations between partial and total preferences, or\nin the sense of not having a complete and transitive total preference\nordering for her overall appraisal of the options in question. This\nargument connects with a long philosophical tradition, including Plato\nand Bishop Butler, that draws an analogy between intrapersonal\nconflicts and citizens’ conflicting preferences within a state.\n \nThere are also authors who reject the idea that total preferences are\nuniquely derivable from partial preferences. Instead they claim that\ntotal preferences are constructed at the moment of\nelicitation, and thus influenced by contexts and framings of the\nelicitation procedure that are not encoded in pre-existing partial\npreferences (Payne, Bettman and Johnson 1993). Total preferences seem\nto be influenced by direct affective responses that are independent of\ncognitive processes (Zajone 1980). For instance, food preferences seem\nto be partly determined by habituation and are therefore difficult to\nexplain as the outcome of a process exclusively based on well-behaved\npartial preferences. According to this view, partial preferences are\nin many cases ex post rationalisations of total preferences,\nrather than the basis from which total preferences are derived.  \nA closely related standpoint was expressed by Nozick (1981, 244):\n“Reasons do not come with previously assigned weights; the\ndecision process is not one of discovering such precise weights but of\nassigning them. The process not only weighs reasons, it (also) weights\nthem.” According to Kranz (1991, 34), “[p]eople do and\nshould act as problem solvers, not maximizers, because they have\nmany different and incommensurable … goals to achieve”.\nMuch in the same vein, Levi (1986, 246) maintained that “an\nagent may terminate deliberation and take decisions without having\nresolved the moral, political, economic and aesthetic conflicts\nrelevant to their predicaments”.  \nThere is a strong tradition, particularly in economics, to relate\npreference to choice. Preference is linked to hypothetical choice, and\nchoice to revealed preference. We begin this section by presenting\nchoice functions and some of their main properties. We then proceed to\ndiscuss how choice functions and their properties can be derived from\npreferences. Finally we view the relationship from the other end, and\nintroduce some approaches to inferring preferences from observed\nchoices. \nGiven an alternative set A, we can\nrepresent (hypothetical) choice as a function C that,\nfor any given subset B of A,\ndelivers those elements of B\nthat a deliberating agent has not ruled out\nfor choice. For brevity’s sake we will call them ‘chosen\nelements’. The formal definition of a choice function is as\nfollows: \nC is a choice function for A\nif and only if it is a function such that\nfor all B ⊆ A:\n(1) C(B)\n⊆ B,\nand (2) if B\n≠ ∅, then \nC(B) ≠\n∅.\n \nA large number of rationality properties have been proposed for choice\nfunctions. The two most important of these are described here. \nIf B ⊆ A\nthen B ∩\nC(A)\n⊆ C(B)\n   (Property\nα, “Chernoff”)\n \nThis property states that if some element of subset B\nof A is chosen\nfrom A, then it is also chosen from\nB. According to property α,\nremoving some of the alternatives that are not chosen does not\ninfluence choice. This property has often been assumed to hold, but\ncounterarguments have been raised against it. Consider the following\nexample. Erna is invited to an acquaintance’s house for\ndinner. Her choice for dessert is between an apple (which is the last\npiece of fruit in the fruit basket) (X) and nothing instead\n(Y). Because Erna is polite, she chooses Y. Had she\nfaced a choice between an apple (X), nothing (Y) and\nan orange (Z), she would have taken the apple. Thus her\nchoices are: \nC({X,Y,Z}) ={X}\n \nand \nC({X,Y}) ={Y},\n \nwhich violate property α. More generally, property α has\nbeen contested with reference to cases when alternatives are preferred\nfor their position in an alternative set, when the set of alternatives\nitself constitutes important information about the alternative chosen,\nor when certain alternatives provide the chooser with the freedom to\nreject them (Sen 1993,\n 501–503).[3] \nThe second property states that if X and Y are both\nchosen from B, a subset of A,\nthen one of them cannot be chosen in A\nwithout the other also being chosen. \nIf B ⊆ A\nand X, Y ∈\nC(B), then\nX ∈ C(A)\niff Y ∈ C(A)\n   (Property\nβ)\n \nTo exemplify property β, suppose that we have three restaurants,\nX, Y and Z, within walking distance, and\ntwo additional restaurants, V and W, that we can\nreach by car. Furthermore suppose that we begin by choosing among the\nrestaurants within walking distance. We agree that the choice is\nbetween X and Y, but we find no reasons to choose\none of them rather than the other, i.e. C({X, Y,\nZ})={X, Y}. Then we find out that we do in fact have access to a car.\nProperty β says that if X is one of the chosen\nrestaurants in this situation, then so is Y, and vice versa.\nIn other words: X∈C({X,\nY, Z, V, W}) holds if and only if\nY ∈C({X, Y, Z,\nV, W}).  \nA third property, γ, is described in\n footnote.[4] \nThe above properties are mainly found in the social choice literature.\nA related property in the economic literature is the so-called\nWeak Axiom of Revealed Preferences (WARP). It says that if\nX is chosen when Y is available, then there must not\nbe an alternative set B containing both\nalternatives for which Y is chosen and X is not.\n \nIf X,Y∈A\nand X∈C(A),\nthen for all B,\nif X∈B,\nand\nY∈C(B),\nthen X∈C(B)\n   (WARP)\n \nWARP is equivalent to the combination of properties α and β\n(Sen 1971, 50). A stronger version, SARP, is discussed in the first\npart of the supplementary document \n The Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference\n  \nCounterexamples have been offered to show that these properties are\nnot plausible in all situations. Consider an agent who chooses to stay\nat a friend’s house for a cup of tea (T) rather than to\ngo home (H), but who leaves in a hurry when the friend offers\na choice between tea and cocaine (C) at his next visit. Then\nC({T,H}) ={T} and\nC({T,H,C}) ={H}, and hence the\nvisitor violates both properties α and β.  \nA choice function that is defined on the basis of a preference\nrelation is called relational (also binary). The\nmost obvious way to construct a choice function from a preference\nrelation ≽ is to have the function always choose the elements\nthat are best according to ≽: \nThe best choice connectionCB(B) =\n{X ∈ B |\n∀Y ∈ B:\n(X≽Y)} \n \nCB is a choice function (i.e. satisfies\nthe defining criteria for a choice function given in section 5.1) if\nand only if ≽ is complete and acyclical. It will then \nsatisfy properties α and γ. Furthermore,\nCB satisfies property β if and only\nif ≽ is transitive and complete (Sen 1970a, 19). \nWhen the underlying preference relation is incomplete, there may not\nbe an element that is preferred to all other elements. A function\nC constructed according to the best choice connection\nwill then be empty, and hence not a choice function. To avoid this, an\nalternative connection constructs the choice function as choosing\nthose elements that are not dispreferred to any other elements of the\nset: \nThe non-dominance choice connectionCL(B) =\n{X ∈ B |\n∀Y ∈ B:\n¬(Y≻X)}\n \nCL is a choice function if and only if\n≽ is acyclical. It will then satisfy properties\nα and γ. Furthermore, CL\nsatisfies property β if and only if ≽ is transitive and\ncomplete (Herzberger 1973). \nWhen the preference relation over A is\ncyclical, neither CB nor\nCL may be a relational choice function for\nA. In the simplest case, with a cyclical\npreference\nA≻B≻C≻A,\nCB(A,B,C) =\nCL(A,B,C) =\n∅. Schwarz (1972) therefore proposes a third relational choice\nfunction, which operates even on the basis of cyclical preferences.\nIts basic idea is to select elements that are not dominated by\nnon-cyclical preference. \nThe close connections between preference axioms and choice axioms can\nalso be employed to construct a preference ordering from a choice\nfunction that satisfies certain axioms. In economics, the revealed\npreference approach has been used to define preference in terms\nof choice. Historically, this approach developed out of the pursuit of\nbehaviouristic foundations for economic theories—i.e. the\nattempt to eliminate the preference framework altogether. Today, it\nserves to derive preference orderings from an agent’s observed\nchoices, and to test the empirical validity of the preference axioms\nby testing for the violation of choice axioms (Grüne-Yanoff\n2004). \nThere are many ways to construct preference relations from observed\nchoices. The simplest defines an alternative X as “at\nleast as good as” an alternative Y if and only if\nX is chosen from some set of alternatives that also contains\nY. \nIf the choice function is defined over all subsets of B,\n≽S is complete.\n≻S does not necessarily satisfy transitivity\nof strict preference, transitivity of indifference, IP- or\nPI-transitivity. Two further methods are described in the\nsupplementary document: \n The Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference\n  \nThe above-discussed theoretical effort sees preferences as completely\ntied to choices. Various caveats concerning this connection are in\norder. First, it must be pointed out that choices and preferences are\nin fact entities of quite different categories. Preferences are\nstates of mind whereas choices are actions. The\nstrong behaviourist program, which sought to eliminate the notion of\npreference by reducing it to choices, is therefore rightly regarded\nwith suspicion today (Hausman 2012).  \nSecondly, it is necessary to distinguish between those agents who\nindeed have preferences as states of minds—e.g. humans, and\nmaybe higher animals—and those agents who do not—e.g.\nmachines, plants or institutions. The former category may choose on\nthe basis of their preferences, and hence the above-discussed effort\ncan aim at eliciting the preferences on which their choices are based.\nThe latter category, despite their lack of states of mind, may\nnevertheless exhibit behaviour that can be interpreted as relational\nchoice. In those cases, one can only speak of preferences\nreconstructed from choice, without claiming that these\npreferences describe mental states at all (Gul and Pesendorfer 2008,\nHands 2013, Ross 2014).  \nThirdly, it seems obvious that there are preferences over alternatives\nthat one cannot choose between—for example preferences for\nwinning a certain prize of a lottery, or for particular configurations\nof Paradise. This contradicts the claim that preferences exclusively\ntranspire from choices. One way to substantiate preferences over\nalternatives that one cannot choose between is to ask people what they\nprefer. Their answers can be interpreted as further choice\nevidence—as verbal or writing behaviour. This\ninterpretation treats their answers on a par with all other forms of\nbehaviour. It thus acknowledges that their answers are possibly\ninfluenced by other preferences, e.g. for privacy, status or pretend\nplay, and explains why answers may not be true. Alternatively, their\nanswers can be interpreted as introspective reports. This\ninterpretation treats answers as agents’ privileged access to\ntheir own minds; and it becomes difficult to explain\n“false” answers.  \nFourthly, some choices are not based on stable preferences over\nactions, but are constructed from more basic cognitive and evaluative\nelements. A simple choice—like e.g. choosing between two pieces\nof candy—might be based on a preference for a world in which one\neats candy X over a world in which one eats candy Y.\nBut more complex choices—e.g. choosing one’s higher\neducation—depend on what one believes these choices to\nbring about, and how one evaluates the consequences of these choices.\nIn those cases, a more complex framework specifies beliefs about the\nprobability or plausibility of possible states of the world,\npreferences over the consequences of choices in those worlds, and an\naggregation mechanism of these preferences under those beliefs. Often,\nthis framework yields a preference relation over actions much like the\nsimple case. However, alternative frameworks have been developed in\nwhich this is not the case (e.g. Loomes and Sugden 1982).  \nLast, the introspective concept of preference is closely connected to\nthe notion of welfare. An agent who prefers X to\nY is expected to judge herself to be better off with\nX than with Y. But if preferences are tightly linked\nto choice, the welfare interpretation is jeopardized. As Sen argues,\npeople choose not only on the basis of their concern for their own\nwelfare, but also on the basis of commitments—e.g.\ntraditions, habits, moral maxims, etc. (Sen 1977). So it seems that\npreferences can either be interpreted as welfare judgements,\nor as the basis of choices, but not as both at the same time.\nWe discuss the relation of preference and welfare in the next\nsection. \nPreference relates to welfare in rather intricate ways. Welfare is a\nfundamental concept in moral philosophy and economics. It refers to\nthe fundamental good for individual human beings, and it is therefore\nan anthropocentric and individualist concept. In order to clarify the\nrelationship between preference and welfare we need to distinguish\nbetween three variants of the concept of welfare.  \nAccording to the material view, a person’s welfare is a\nmatter of her material conditions, such as access to food, shelter,\nhealthcare and, generally speaking, the necessities and perhaps\nluxuries of life. This view of welfare has been criticized for being\nmaterialistic in the sense of pursuing material possessions at the\nexpense of higher values. It also has to face the difficulties\ninherent in weighing different material goods against each other.  \nThe other two principal views both treat welfare as a mental rather\nthan a material issue. The wish-based mental view uses each\nperson’s wishes (i.e. preferences in the informal sense of that\nword) as the criterion of welfare (Sen 1979). A person is considered\nto have more welfare, the more her wishes are satisfied. If this view\nis applied within a utilitarian framework, then it gives rise to\npreference utilitarianism. This view of welfare has difficulties in\ndealing with misinformed and self-defeating wishes. It can also have\ndifficulties with certain types of other-regarding wishes, e.g.\nmalevolent ones. The usual way to deal with this is to require that\npreferences are filtered (“laundered”) and/or refined\nbefore they are used to judge a person’s welfare.  \nThe filtering (“laundering”) of preferences can be\njustified by the everyday experience that some preferences are much\nmore important for a person’s well-being than others. It can be\nargued that a plausible preference-based account of welfare cannot be\nbased on total preferences, but would have to be based on a subset of\n“core” preferences that are important for the individual.\nThe determination of that subset is expectedly contentious. If it is\nto be determined by others than the individual whose welfare is\nconcerned, then problems of paternalism will be difficult to avoid.\n \nRefinement of preferences is usually assumed to result in the\nperson’s (hypothetical) “rational” or “ideally\nconsidered” preferences. “My ideally considered\npreferences are those I would have if I were to engage in\nthoroughgoing deliberation about my preferences with full pertinent\ninformation, in a calm mood, while thinking clearly and making no\nreasoning errors.” (Arneson 1989, 83; cf. Brandt 1979 and Rosati 2009) A problem\nfor this view is that there does not seem to be any easy way to\ndetermine, based on a person’s preferences and circumstances,\nwhat her ideally considered preferences would be.  \nFinally, the state-dependent mental view identifies a\nperson’s welfare with some mental state such as happiness or\nsatisfaction. It is assumed that the relevant states of mind can at\nleast in principle be judged by external assessors. If such a view is\napplied within a utilitarian framework, then it can give rise to\nhedonistic utilitarianism. This view can be criticized for paternalism\nand for being uncritical towards arrangements in which individuals are\nhappy in spite of being oppressed or deprived. Furthermore, the\ndifficulties involved in comparing mental properties such as happiness\nin different persons creates a problem for views that depend on such\ncomparisons for the determination of welfare. However, recent work on\nthe measurement of happiness and life satisfaction has challenged that\nview, and may have opened up new avenues for research in both\neconomics and moral philosophy. (Ng 1997)  \nOnly one of these three views, namely the wish-based one, refers to\nwhat we usually call preferences. However, the other two can also be\nexpressed in terms of preference (betterness) relations. We can use\nsuch relations to order material conditions respectively mental states\nin terms of how they satisfy the criteria of welfare that we have\nchosen to apply. It is important to distinguish between on the one\nhand preferences in the common sense of comparative likings, and on\nthe other hand the use of a preference relation to express grades of\nany property whose structure satisfies the common formal requirement\nof such a relation.  \nA common problem for attempts to account for welfare in terms of\npreference is that we expect a person’s view of her own welfare\nto be essentially self-regarding, but her preferences can refer to\nconcerns that are not self-regarding, such as her concerns for other\npeople, her views on social justice, and her commitments for instance\nto traditions, conventions, and moral ideas (Sen 1977). Our choices\nare influenced by this wide range of preferences. Therefore, it does\nnot seem possible to link preferences strongly to welfare and at the\nsame time link them strongly to choice.  \nPreferences relate to time in several ways. Preference at one point in\ntime can refer to what happens or happened at other points in time.\nFurthermore, preferences can change over time, due to changes in\nbeliefs, values, tastes, or a combination of these. Section 7.1\nexplains why preference change requires explanatory and theoretical\n treatment.[5]\n In the following sections, three types of explanatory models are\ndiscussed. (For more detail, see Grüne-Yanoff and Hansson 2009.) \nTime preference models (section 7.2) only refer to\nthe temporal relationship between the occurrence of a preference and\nthe objects it refers to. Doxastic change models (section\n7.3) investigate how a change of an agent’s beliefs leads to a\nchange in her preferences. Valuational change models (section\n7.4) investigate how a change in an agent’s basic evaluations\nleads to a change in her preferences. \nSome authors have argued that preference change is only a superficial\nperception, and that the underlying preferences remain stable over\ntime. But there are at least four arguments to the effect that\npeople’s preferences really do change over time. First, many\nsuccessful explanations of behavioural change have interpreted the\nempirical behavioural evidence as preference change. These\nexplanations can be differentiated into models of external\ninfluences and models of internal coherence. External\ninfluence models attempt to establish general links between external\nevents and agents’ preference formations. They include, for\nexample, social imitation (Leibenstein 1950), parental influence\n(Cavalli-Sforza 1973), habit formation (Pollack 1976), and the effect\nof production patterns on consumption (Duesenberry 1949). Internal\ncoherence models take certain external influences as given, and model\npreference change as an accommodation of these external influences.\nThey include, for example, religious convictions (Iannaccone 1990) and\nthe effect of cognitive dissonance on preferences (Elster 1982). \nA second argument for preference change is based on the correlations\nbetween physiological changes and changes in behaviour. Changes in\nblood sugar levels, for example, are correlated to feeding behaviour,\nsexual behaviour varies with hormonal changes, and many behavioural\npatterns change with increasing age (for references and discussion,\nsee Loewenstein 1996). These correlations are not deterministic, such\nbehavioural changes can be resisted in many cases. It is plausible to\nincorporate these potential physiological effects as visceral\npreferences in the general preference framework, and to treat the\nrelevant physiological changes as closely connected with preference\nchanges. \nThird, most humans have introspective evidence for their own\npreferences changing over time. The favourite activities of a child\nare replaced by new pleasures as we grow up. Thus was the experience\nof Shakespeare’s Benedick: “…but doth not the\nappetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot\nendure in his age” (Much ado about nothing Act II,\nScene III). Even in adult life, we are literally overcome by sudden\nand very radical (\"transformative\") changes of preference. Laurie A. Paul (2014) has investigated the types of decision-making that this involves. It would be strange to\nclaim in such cases that it is only our beliefs about the different types of\nactivities that change. Explanations in terms of preference change are\nmuch more in line with how we spontaneously interpret our experiences\nof such changes. \nLast, certain concepts like taste refinement or self-restraint cannot\neasily be understood without a notion of real preference change. In\nparticular, self-restraint presupposes that the motivational\ncomponents of one’s self can change, for example, through\nmaturation or social influence; and that one can and should plan\none’s future self by curbing certain appetites or by designing\nthe environment in ways that affect one’s preferences. \nThe value that we assign to obtaining an advantage or disadvantage\nusually varies with the point in time when we obtain it. In typical\ncases, values decrease with time. For instance, most of us would\nprefer receiving a large sum of money now to receiving it five years\nlater. Analytically, this temporal factor of evaluations is often\nseparated from time-independent factors of evaluations. \nThe standard approach to this issue in economic analysis treats\npreference as based on value. Value is dealt with in a bifactorial\nmodel, in which the value of a future good is assumed to be equal to\nthe product of two factors. One of these factors is a time-independent\nevaluation of the good in question, i.e. the value of obtaining it\nimmediately. The other factor represents the subject’s pure time\npreferences. It is a function of the length of the delay, and is the\nsame for all types of goods. The most common type of time preference\nfunction can be written \nv(A,ti) =\nv(A,ti−1) / (1 +\nr)t\n \nwhere r is a discount rate and t =\nti−ti−1 the duration of the\ndelay. This is the discounted utility model, proposed by\nSamuelson (1937), which still dominates in economic analysis. \nThe choice of a discount rate can have a large impact on the\ncalculated values. It is therefore often politically controversial. As\none example of this, the discount rate used in assessing the economic\neffects of climate change can have significant consequences for the\npolicy recommendations that are based on these assessments. \nThere is a some evidence that the standard discounted utility model\ndoes not adequately represent human behaviour. For a simple example,\nconsider a person who prefers one apple today to two apples tomorrow,\nbut yet (today) prefers two apples in 51 days to one apple in 50 days.\nAlthough this is a plausible preference pattern, it is incompatible\nwith the exponentially discounted utility model. It can\nhowever be accounted for in a bifactorial model with a declining\ndiscount rate. Pioneered by Ainslie (1992), psychologists and\nbehavioural economists have therefore proposed to replace\nSamuelson’s exponential discounting model with a model of\nhyperbolic discounting. The hyperbolic model discounts the future\nconsumption with a parameter inversely proportional to the delay of\nthe consumption, and hence covers examples like the above.  \nOther deviations from the discounted utility model have also been\ndemonstrated. Experimental evidence indicates that we tend to discount\ngains more than losses, and small amounts more than large amounts.\nDiscount rates also differ between different goods (such as money and\nhealth). For some—but only some—types of goods, improving\nsequences of outcomes are preferred to declining sequences. These are\nall patterns that cannot be handled in the bifactorial model with its\nobject-independent time preferences (Loewenstein et al 2002). Given\nthe empirical evidence, it is an open question whether the concept of\n“time preferences” is at all descriptively adequate. \nIt is a separate question whether pure time preferences are rational.\nCritics argue that one should want one’s life, as a\nwhole, to go as well as possible, and that counting some parts of\nlife more than others interferes with this goal (Pigou, 1920; Ramsey,\n1928b; Rawls 1971). According to this view, it is irrational to prefer\na smaller immediate good to a greater future good, because now and\nlater are equally parts of one life. Choosing the smaller good or the\ngreater bad makes one’s life, as a whole, turn out worse:\n“Rationality requires an impartial concern for all parts of our\nlife. The mere difference of location in time, of something’s\nbeing earlier or later, is not a rational ground for having more or\nless regard for it” (Rawls 1971, 293). Critics of pure temporal\npreferences often attribute apparent departures from temporal\nneutrality to a cognitive illusion (which causes people to\nsee future pleasures or pains in some diminished form) or to a\nweakness of will (which causes people to choose options\nagainst their better judgment). \nAgainst the temporal neutrality of preferences, some have argued that\nthere is no enduring, irreducible entity over time to whom all future\nutility can be ascribed; they deny that all parts of one’s\nfuture are equally parts of oneself (Parfit 1984). They\nargue, instead, that a person is a succession of overlapping selves\nrelated to varying degrees by memories, physical continuities, and\nsimilarities of character and interests, etc. By this view, it may be\njust as rational to discount one’s “own” future\npreferences, as to discount the preferences of another distinct\nindividual, because the divisions between the stages of one’s\nlife may be as “deep” as the distinctions between\nindividuals. \nA quite different critical approach to discounting is connected with\nthe idea of sustainability. If sustainability is interpreted as\nmeaning that future generations should have access to the same\nresources as those that the present generation has at its disposal,\nthen sustainability is sure to be in conflict with economic policies\nbased on exponential discounting. However, there are also views on\nsustainability that allow us to use up natural resources if we replace\nthem by non-natural resources such as new technologies that will\ncompensate for the loss. Such a “weak” notion of\nsustainability appears to be compatible with policies based on\ndiscounting of future effects, but their compatibility with\nsustainability has been challenged. (Ng 2005) \nTwo kinds of beliefs are especially important for doxastic models. The\nfirst is the belief that the presence of state X makes a\ndesired state Y more likely. Take for example the belief that\nfluoride prevents dental cavities. This can lead a person to prefer\nfluoride toothpaste to others. If she comes to disbelieve this\nconnection, she may well abandon this preference. More generally, if\nX∧Y is preferred to\nX∧¬Y, then a rise of the probability that\nY given X will result in a rise in the desirability\nof X, and vice versa. \nThe second kind of belief relevant for doxastic preference change\nconcerns prospects that influence the preference for other prospects\nwithout being probabilistically related. For example, one’s\npreference for winning a trip to Florida in the lottery will crucially\ndepend on one’s belief about the weather there during the\nspecified travel time, even though these two prospects are\nprobabilistically unrelated. More generally, if\nX∧Y is preferred to\nX∧¬Y, with X and Y\nprobabilistically not correlated, then a rise of the probability that\nX will result in a rise in the desirability of Y\n(even if it does not affect the probability of Y), and vice\nversa. \nJeffrey (1977) provides a simple model of preference change as the\nconsequence of an agent coming to believe a proposition A to\nbe true. His model incorporates both kinds of belief relevant for\ndoxastic preference change. It is based on the notion of conditional\npreferences. Jeffrey treats preferences as a relation over\npropositions, viz. sets of possible worlds. They are represented by a\nutility function U (see section 2), such that: \nX≽Y iff U(X) ≥\nU(Y)\n \nU(X) in turn is defined as the weighted\naverage of the utility u of all the possible worlds\nw in which X is true: \nU(X) = [1/P(X)]\n∑w∈X [u(w)\n× P(w|X)]\n \nwhere P is the probability weight (Jeffrey’s original\nnotation here is adapted to the discrete case).\n〈u,P〉 represents the unconditional\npreference ≽ if P is the probability distribution based\non the agent’s actual information. The conditional preference\nordering ≽A, in contrast, is represented by\nthe tuple 〈u,PA〉, where\nPA is the probability distribution based on the\ncounterfactual scenario that the agent accepts proposition A\nas true. That is, the agent imagines that if he changed his whole\nbelief system from P to PA (and\nhence specifically P(A)<1 to\nPA(A)=1), then he would have the\npreference relation ≽A as represented by\n〈u,PA〉 (for more\ndiscussion on the existence and uniqueness conditions of conditional\npreferences, see Luce and Krantz 1971, Joyce 1999, chapter 4, Bradley\n1999). Jeffrey shows that the posterior utility function\nUA is related to the prior\nutility function U as follows: \nConditional preferences allow modelling doxastic preference change.\nWhat matters for an agent’s evaluation and behaviour are his\nunconditional preferences, ≽t, which are\nunconditional only in the sense that they rely on the agent’s\nactual information at time t. When the agent accepts a new\nproposition A at time t+1, his\nconditional-on-A preferences become his unconditional\npreferences at t+1: ≽t+1 =\n≽A. \nJeffrey’s model is restricted in two ways. First, it requires an\nunchanging evaluative function u defined over the atoms of\nthe propositional space, viz. possible worlds. Thus for all\ndoxastically changed preference orderings, the preferences over worlds\nremain identical. Second, the model only considers the effects of a\nbelief change to certainty. But it is plausible that one’s\npreference—say, for a vacation in Florida—changes just\nbecause one believes that it is more likely that there will be a\nhurricane next week. Jeffrey’s model can be generalised by\nintroducing a more general probability updating rule (e.g., Jeffrey\nconditionalisation). An alternative solution was proposed by Bradley\n(2005). It is based on relatively strong assumptions on the relation\nbetween prior and posterior unconditional preferences. \nAn important discussion from economics needs mentioning, namely the\nquestion whether models of doxastic preference change are capable in\nprinciple to represent all preference changes. This question\noriginates with an important paper by Stigler and Becker (1977), who\nargued that a wide range of phenomena which are commonly thought of as\npreference changes—like addiction, habitual behaviour, fashions\nand the effects of marketing—can be explained by stable,\nwell-behaved preferences. In a rather informal fashion, they argue\nthat such explanations involve only changes in information (more\nprecisely: prices and income), while leaving preferences intact. As a\nresult of this, economists largely abandoned the discussion of\npreference change, believing that all preference change phenomena can\nbe explained in this way. Prima facie, their proposed explanations\nexhibit important similarities to the discussed accounts of doxastic\npreference change. The results from that discussion, which show that\nmodels of doxastic preference change are subject to relatively strong\nconstraints, may therefore put doubt on the orthodox position in\neconomics that models of doxastic preference change are capable in\nprinciple to represent all preference changes. \nIf an agent forms a specific preference as a result of some\nexperience, further changes in her overall preference state are often\nnecessary to regain consistency. A model of preference change can\ntherefore be constructed as an input-output model in the same style as\nstandard models of belief change. (Hansson 1995, Liu 2011) Changes in\npreference are triggered by inputs that are represented by sentences\nexpressing new preference patterns. Hence, if the subject grows tired\nof her previous favourite brand of mustard, A, and starts to\nlike brand C better, then this will be represented by a\nchange with the sentence “C is better than\nA”, in formal language C≻A, as\nan input. However, a change in which the previous preference\nA≻C is replaced by the new preference\nC≻A can take place in different ways. For\ninstance, there may be a third brand B that was previously\nplaced between A and C in the preference ordering.\nThe instruction to make the new preference relation satisfy\nC≻A does not tell us where B should\nbe placed in the new ordering. The new ordering may for instance be\neither C≻A≻B or\nC≻B≻A. One way to deal with\nthis is to include additional information in the input, for instance\nspecifying which element(s) of the alternative set should be moved\nwhile the others keep their previous positions. In our example, if\nonly C is going to be moved, then the outcome should satisfy\nC≻A≻B. These and other\nconsiderations make it necessary to modify the standard model of\nbelief change in order to accommodate the subject matter of\npreferences. \nIn scholarly discussions, preferences are usually taken to be open to\nrational criticism only insofar as (i) they have been inconsistent,\nviolating some of the rationally justifiable preference axioms, or\n(ii) they (in combination with beliefs) commit the agent to\ninconsistent inferences.  \nCan there be rationally justifiable claims that certain\nintrinsic preferences – i.e preferences that are not\ndependent on other preferences – are wrong, or should be\nchanged? The Humean position answers no. Hume distinguished reason\nfrom the passion, and argued “that reason alone can never be a\nmotive to any action of the will; that it can never oppose passion in\nthe direction of the will” (Treatise, Book II, Part\nIII, Section III). Humeans often took this distinction between beliefs\nand desires to imply not only that beliefs alone cannot motivate\naction, but also that desires are not open to similar rational\ncriticism as beliefs. Therefore, Humeans conclude, preferences can\nonly be criticised if they are extrinsic – i.e.\ninstrumentally derived from other preferences on the basis of beliefs\n– or inconsistent. Such criticism of extrinsic preferences would\nseem ultimately to be a criticism of false beliefs, and it could be\nargued that it is therefore not really criticism of preferences\n(Broome 1993).  \nSeveral authors have argued for a more substantial criticism of\npreferences, including that of intrinsic ones. Some critics argue that\nsome or all preferences are in fact a kind of belief, and hence open\nto the same rational criticism as beliefs. Two defences have been\npresented to counter this challenge. First, it has been claimed that\nthat desires (standing for motivation in general) are fundamentally\ndistinct from epistemic states in their direction of fit.\nBeliefs are directed to fit the world; hence their insufficient fit\nprovides the basis for their criticism. Desires are directed to fit\nthe world to them; hence they lack this basis for criticism (Smith\n1987). Second, Humeans have argued that treating desires as beliefs is\nincompatible with Bayesian decision theory and also with other,\nnon-quantitative, decision theories (Lewis 1988, Collins 1991,\nByrne/Hajek 1997).  \nSome proponents of the criticizability of preferences have referred to\nsecond-order preferences. An addict may prefer not to prefer smoking;\na malevolent person may prefer not to prefer evil actions; an indolent\nmay prefer not to prefer to shun work; a daydreamer may prefer not to\nprefer what cannot be realised, etc. First-order preferences are\ncriticisable if they do not comply with second-order preferences. (For\naccounts of second-order preferences, see Frankfurt 1971, Sen 1977.)\nSecond-order preferences may trigger attempts to change one’s\npreferences. Methods of self-restraint, self-command and\nself-improvement have been extensively described (Schelling 1984,\nElster 1989, 2000). Already Hume described the possibility of\nrationally choosing such expedience (Grüne-Yanoff & McClennen\n2006).  \nCritics have argued against the possibility of rationally choosing\nsuch indirect preference-modifying strategies. Millgram (1998) argues\nthat knowledge of the way such desires-at-will were brought about\nmakes it impossible for them to actually function as the desires they\nare intended to be. He gives the example of a car salesman, who, in\norder to be successful in his work, makes himself prefer the various\nuseless knick-knacks that the brand he represents offers for its cars.\nWhen the salesman is laid off, the car-dealer offers him a car with\nall the useless extras that he made himself prefer. Because he\nremembers how he acquired these preferences, he chooses not to act on\nthem. So, Millgram argues, the desire-at-will was not genuine.What is\nmissing, he points out, are the backward-directed inferential\ncommitments that genuine preferences bring with them. Only if one\nforgets that one acquired a specific preference at will, or if one\nalso acquires the inferential commitments of such a preference, can\npreferring-at-will be successful.

Preferences and their\nlogical properties also have a central role in rational choice theory,\na subject that in its turn permeates modern economics, as well as\nother branches of formalized social science. The notion of preference\nand the way it is analysed vary between these disciplines. A treatment\nis still lacking that takes into account the needs of all usages and\ntries to combine them in a unified approach. This entry surveys the\nmost important philosophical uses of the preference concept and\ninvestigates their compatibilities and conflicts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn common parlance, the term \"preference\" assumes different meanings,\nincluding that of comparative evaluation, prioritisation or favouring,\nand choice ranking (See for instance the Oxford English\nDictionary). In this entry, we discuss the notion of preference\nas subjective comparative evaluations, of the form\n“Agent A prefers X to Y”. This\ncharacterisation distinguishes preference from other evaluative\nconcepts.  \nPreferences are evaluations: they concern matters of value,\ntypically in relation to practical reasoning, i.e. questions about what\nshould be done. This distinguishes preferences from concepts that\nconcern matters of fact.  \nFurthermore, preferences are subjective in that the\nevaluation is typically attributed to an agent – where this\nagent might be either an individual or a collective. This\ndistinguishes them from statements to the effect that\n“X is better than Y” in an objective\nsense. The logic of preference has often also been used to represent\nsuch objective evaluations (e.g. Broome 1991b), but the substantial\nnotion of preference includes this subjective element.  \nFinally, preferences are comparative in that they express the\nevaluation of an item X  relative to another item\nY. This distinguishes them from monadic concepts like\n“good”, “is desired”, etc. which only evaluate\none item.  \nMost philosophers take the evaluated items to be propositions. In\ncontrast to this, economists commonly conceive of items as bundles of\n goods.[1] \nThey are represented as vectors, where each position in the\nvector represents a specific good, and the scalar at that position\ndenotes the number of units of that good. For convenience, economists\noften operate in two-goods worlds, where one good—the\nnumeraire—stands for all the other goods (money is the\nmost common numeraire). However, this approach has a difficult ambiguity. If\npreferences are subjective evaluations of the alternatives, then what\nmatters are the results that can be obtained with the help of these\ngoods, not the goods themselves. Whether an agent has a preference\ne.g. for a batch of wood over a crate of bricks will depend on whether\nshe intends to use it to generate warmth, build a shelter or create a\nsculpture. Economists have tried to solve this ambiguity by coupling\npreferences over goods with household production functions (Lancaster\n1966, Becker and Michael 1973); but as these components are very\ndifficult to determine, it is often thought more parsimonious to stick\nwith the sentential or propositional representations of states of the\nworld.  \nSerious engagement with preferences began in the 20th\ncentury. In the social sciences, the preference concept became\nimportant for explanatory and predictive purposes with Irving\nFisher’s (1892) and Vilfredo Pareto’s (1909)\nmethodological criticisms of hedonistic cardinal utility. Previously,\neconomists largely agreed that decisions were motivated by the\nindividual’s quest for pleasure, and that the difference in\nquantity of pleasure derived from different alternatives was an\nimportant influence on decisions. In that framework, the notion of\npreference, to the extent that it was used at all, was merely derived\nfrom hedonistic utility: X is preferred to Y iff\nX yields more utility than Y. Pareto argued that\nbecause an accurate measurement procedure for cardinal hedonic utility\nwas not available, social scientists should constrain themselves to\nmerely ordinal comparisons (Bruni and Guala 2001). This argument\nturned preference into a fundamental notion of the social sciences,\nreplacing (hedonic) utility.  \nEconomists in the 1930s (Hicks and Allen 1934) radicalised\nPareto’s idea and argued that cardinal utility should be\nexcluded in order to expunge economics from psychological hedonism.\nHowever, their concept of preference retained psychological content:\npeople are assumed to act purposefully and therefore to have\npreferences that really constitute mental evaluations, rather than\nbeing ex-post rationalisations of behaviour (Lewin 1996). Furthermore,\nRamsey (1926) and later von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944) devised\nformal tools allowing the representation of preference magnitudes as\nutility functions. This new utility, however, was very different from\nthe older hedonic concept: here the preference concept is basic, and\nthe cardinal utility function merely derived.  \nPsychologists also sought to move away from the old psychophysical\nassumptions and began seeing mental concepts like preferences with\nincreased suspicion. Instead, they sought not only to connect and\nmeasure psychological events, but indeed replace them by the\nbehavioural criteria with which they were hitherto connected. (See the\nentry on\n behaviorism).\n Again, it was an economist, Paul Samuelson, who formulated this\nprinciple most explicitly for the concept of preference. In 1938 he\nsuggested to “start anew … dropping off the last vestiges\nof the utility analysis” (1938, pp. 61–62). Preferences\nwere supposed to be defined in terms of choice, thus eliminating\nreference to mental states altogether. Although this approach was highly influential at\nthe time, economists have largely not followed Samuelson in this\nradical proposal (Hausman 2012), and it might indeed be the case that\nSamuelson himself later changed his mind (Hands 2014). With the\nincreasing convergence of (parts of) economics and psychology, the\nordinal psychological interpretation of preferences appears to\ncurrently dominate in these disciplines. However, there is an ongoing\ndiscussion amongst philosophers whether the current concept of\npreference used by economists is this mental,\n“folk-theoretic” notion or a seperate theoretical concept\n(Mäki 2000, Ross 2014).  \nIn philosophy, the concept of preference gained increased attention in\nthe wake of the conceptual developments in the social sciences.\nBecause the hedonic utility notion was increasingly questioned,\nutilitarian philosophers sought alternative foundations for their\nethical theories. Today, preferentialism defends satisfaction\nof individual preferences as the only intrinsic value bearer, and thus\nis a subcategory of the broad welfarist family of value theories,\nwhich identify intrinsic value with well-being. Few people defend the\nview that well-being is constituted by the satisfaction of\nany preference, but a number of authors defend refined\nversions of preferentialism (e.g. Rawls 1971, Scanlon 1998).\nPhilosophers have also discussed the formal properties of preferences\nin preference logic. To this we turn in the next section.\n \nAlthough not all philosophical references to preference make use of\nformal tools, preferences are almost always assumed to have structural\nproperties of a type that is best described in a formalized language.\nThe study of the structural properties of preferences can be traced\nback to Book III of Aristotle’s Topics. Since the early\ntwentieth century several philosophers have studied the structure of\npreferences with logical tools. In 1957 and in 1963, respectively,\nSören Halldén and Georg Henrik von Wright proposed the\nfirst complete systems of preference logic (Halldén 1957, von\nWright 1963). The subject also has important roots in utility theory\nand in the theory of games and decisions. The preferences studied in\npreference logic are usually the preferences of rational individuals,\nbut preference logic is also used in psychology and behavioural\neconomics, where the emphasis is on actual preferences as revealed in\nbehaviour. \nThere are two fundamental comparative value concepts, namely\n“better” (strict preference) and “equal in value\nto” (indifference) (Halldén 1957, 10). These terms are\nused to express the wishes of persons, but they are also used for\nother purposes, for instance to express objective or intersubjectively\nvalid betterness that does not coincide with the pattern of wishes of\nany individual person. However, the structural (logical) properties of\nbetterness and value equality do not seem to differ between the cases\nwhen they correspond to what we usually call “preferences”\nand the cases when they do not. The term “preference\nlogic” is standardly used to cover the logic of these concepts\neven in cases when we would typically not use the term\n“preference” in a non-formalized context. \nThe relations of preference and indifference between alternatives are\nusually denoted by the symbols ≻ and ∼ or alternatively by\nP and I. In accordance with a long-standing\nphilosophical tradition, A≻B is taken to\nrepresent “B is worse than A”, as well\nas “A is better than B”. \nThe following four properties of the two exclusionary comparative\nrelations are usually taken to be part of the meaning of the concepts\nof (strict) preference and indifference: \n(1) A≻B →\n¬(B≻A)    (asymmetry of\npreference)\n \n(2) A∼B → B∼A\n   (symmetry of indifference)\n \n(3) A∼A    (reflexivity of\nindifference)\n \n(4) A≻B →\n¬(A∼B)\n   (incompatibility of preference and\nindifference)\n \nIt follows from (1) that strict preference is irreflexive, i.e. that\n¬(A≻A). \nThe relation ≽, “at least as good as” (or more\nprecisely: “better than or equal in value to”), can be\ndefined as follows: \nA≽B ↔ A≻B ∨\nA∼B    (weak preference)\n \nThe alternative notation R is sometimes used instead of\n≽. \nFor reasons of convenience, weak preference is usually taken to be the\nprimitive relation of preference logic. Then both (strict) preference\nand indifference are introduced as derived relations, as follows: \nA≻B if and only if A≽B\nand ¬(B≽A)\n \nA∼B if and only if A≽B\nand B≽A\n \n≻ is the strict part of ≽ and ∼ its\nsymmetric part. \nTwo common notational conventions should be mentioned. First, chains\nof relations can be contracted. Hence,\nA≽B≽C abbreviates\nA≽B ∧ B≽C, and\nA≻B≻C∼D\nabbreviates A≻B ∧\nB≻C ∧ C∼D. Second,\nthe ancestral symbol * is used to contract repeated uses of the same\nrelation; hence ≻* stands for ≻ repeated any finite\nnon-zero number of times (and similarly for the other relations). Thus\nA≻*C denotes that either\nA≻C or there are B1\n… Bn such that\nA≻B1 ∧\nB1≻B2 ∧ …\nBn−1≻Bn\n∧ Bn≻C. \nIn most applications of preference logic, it is taken for granted that\nthe following property, called completeness or\nconnectedness, should be satisfied: \nA≽B ∨ B≽A\n \nor equivalently: \nA≻B ∨ A∼B ∨\nB≻A\n \nThe following weaker version of the property is sometimes useful:  \nIf A≠B, then A≽B ∨\nB≽A (weak connectivity)\n (Completeness holds if and only if both weak\nconnectivity and reflexivity of indifference hold.)\n \nCompleteness (connectedness) is commonly assumed in many applications,\nnot least in economics. Bayesian decision theory is a case in point.\nThe Bayesian decision maker is assumed to make her choices in\naccordance with a complete preference ordering over the available\noptions. However, in many everyday cases, we do not have, and do not\nneed, complete preferences. Consider a person who has to choose\nbetween five objects A, B, C, D,\nand E. If she knows that she prefers A to the\nothers, she does not have to make up her mind about the relative\nranking among B, C, D, and E. \nIn terms of resolvability, there are three major types of preference\nincompleteness. First, incompleteness may be uniquely\nresolvable, i.e. resolvable in exactly one way. The most natural\nreason for this type of incompleteness is lack of knowledge or\nreflection. Behind what we perceive as an incomplete preference\nrelation there may be a complete preference relation that we can\narrive at through observation, introspection, logical inference, or\nsome other means of discovery.  \nSecondly, incompleteness may be multiply resolvable, i.e.\npossible to resolve in several different ways. In this case it is\ngenuinely undetermined what will be the outcome of extending the\nrelation to cover the previously uncovered cases. \nThirdly, incompleteness may be irresolvable. The most natural\nreason for this is that the alternatives differ in terms of advantages\nor disadvantages that we are unable to put on the same footing. A\nperson may be unable to say which she prefers—the death of two\nspecified acquaintances or the death of a specified friend. She may\nalso be unable to say whether she prefers the destruction of the\npyramids in Giza or the extinction of the giant panda. In\nenvironmental economics, as a third example, it is a controversial\nissue whether and to what extent environmental damage is comparable to\nmonetary loss. \nTwo alternatives are called “incommensurable” whenever it\nis impossible to measure them with the same unit of measurement. Cases\nof irresolvable incompleteness are often also cases of\nincommensurability (Chang 1997). In moral philosophy, irresolvable\nincompleteness is usually discussed in terms of the related notion of\na moral dilemma. \nBy far the most discussed logical property of preferences is the\nfollowing: \nA≽B ∧ B≽C →\nA≽C    (transitivity of\nweak preference)\n \nThe corresponding properties of the other two relations are defined\nanalogously: \nA∼B ∧ B∼C →\nA∼C    (transitivity of\nindifference)\n \nA≻B ∧ B≻C →\nA≻C    (transitivity of\nstrict preference)\n \nA weak preference relation ≽ is called quasi-transitive\nif its strict part ≻ is transitive. \nMany other properties have been defined that are related to\ntransitivity. The following three are among the most important of\nthese: \nA∼B ∧ B≻C →\nA≻C\n   (IP-transitivity)\n \nA≻B ∧ B∼C →\nA≻C\n   (PI-transitivity)\n \nThere is no series\nA1,…,An of\nalternatives such that A1\n≻…≻An≻A1\n   (acyclicity)\n \nAll of these are weakenings of the transitivity of ≽. In other\nwords, if ≽ satisfies transitivity then ≻  and ∼\nare also transitive, and furthermore, IP-transitivity, PI-transitivity\nand acyclicity hold. \nFurthermore, if ≽ is transitive, then no cycles containing\n≻ are possible, i.e. there are no A and B such\nthat A≽*B≻A. Preferences with\nsuch a ≻-containing cycle are called cyclic\npreferences. \nTransitivity is a controversial property, and many examples have been\noffered to show that it does not hold in general. A classic type of\ncounterexample to transitivity is the so-called Sorites Paradox. It\nemploys a series of objects that are so arranged that we cannot\ndistinguish between two adjacent members of the series, whereas we can\ndistinguish between members at greater distance (Armstrong 1939,\nArmstrong 1948, Luce 1956). Consider 1000 cups of coffee, numbered\nC0, C1,\nC2, … up to C999. Cup\nC0 contains no sugar, cup C1\none grain of sugar, cup C2 two grains etc. Since\none cannot taste the difference between C999 and\nC998, one might consider them to be equally good\n(of equal value),\nC999∼C998. For the same\nreason, we have C998∼C997,\netc. all the way up to\nC1∼C0, but clearly\nC0 ≻ C999. This\ncontradicts transitivity of indifference, and therefore also\ntransitivity of weak preference. \nIn a famous example proposed by Warren S. Quinn, a device has been\nimplanted into the body of a person (the self-torturer). The device\nhas 1001 settings, from 0 (off) to 1000. Each increase leads to a\nnegligible increase in pain. Each week, the self-torturer “has\nonly two options—to stay put or to advance the dial one setting.\nBut he may advance only one step each week, and he may never\nretreat. At each advance he gets $10,000.” In this way\nhe may “eventually reach settings that will be so painful that\nhe would then gladly relinquish his fortune and return to 0”\n(Quinn 1990, 79). \nIn an important type of counterexample to transitivity of strict\npreference, different properties of the alternatives dominate in\ndifferent pairwise comparisons. Consider an agent choosing between\nthree boxes of Christmas ornaments (Schumm 1987). Each box contains\nthree balls, coloured red, blue and green, respectively; they are\nrepresented by the vectors\n〈R1,G1,B1〉,\n〈R2,G2,B2〉,\nand\n〈R3,G3,B3〉.\nThe agent strictly prefers box 1 to box 2, since they contain (to her)\nequally attractive blue and green balls, but the red ball of box 1 is\nmore attractive than that of box 2. She prefers box 2 to box 3, since\nthey are equal but for the green ball of box 2, which is more\nattractive than that of box 3. And finally, she prefers box 3 to box\n1, since they are equal but for the blue ball of box 3, which is more\nattractive than that of box 1. Thus, \nR1≻R2∼R3∼R1,\nG1∼G2≻G3∼G1,\nB1∼B2∼B3≻B1;\nand\n\n〈R1,G1,B1〉≻〈R2,G2,B2〉≻〈R3,G3,B3〉≻〈R1,G1,B1〉.\n \nThe described situation yields a preference cycle, which contradicts\ntransitivity of strict preference. (Notice the structural similarity\nto Condorcet’s Paradox, see the entry on\n voting methods.) \nThese and similar examples can be used to show that actual human\nbeings may have cyclic preferences. It does not necessarily follow,\nhowever, that the same applies to the idealized rational\nagents of preference logic. Perhaps such patterns are due to\nirrationality or to factors, such as lack of knowledge or\ndiscrimination, that prevent actual humans from being rational. There\nis a strong tradition, not least in economic applications, to regard\nfull ≽-transitivity as a necessary prerequisite of\nrationality. \nThe most famous argument in favour of preference transitivity is the\nmoney pump argument. The basic idea was developed by F.P. Ramsey\n(1928a, 182), who pointed out that if a subject’s behaviour\nviolated axioms of probability and preference, then “[h]e could\nhave a book made against him by a cunning better and would then stand\nto lose in any event”. The argument is developed in more detail\nin Davidson et al. (1955).  \nThe following example can be used to show how the argument works in a\nnon-probabilistic context: A certain stamp-collector\nhas cyclic preferences with respect to three stamps, denoted\nA, B, and C. She prefers A to\nB, B to C, and C to A.\nFollowing Ramsey, we may assume that there is an amount of money, say\n10 cents, that she is prepared to pay for exchanging B for\nA, C for B, or A for C.\nShe comes into a stamp shop with stamp A. The stamp-dealer\noffers her to trade in A for C, if she pays 10\ncents. She accepts the deal. \nFor a precise notation, let 〈X,V〉 denote\nthat the collector owns stamp X and has paid V cents\nto the dealer. She has now moved from the state\n〈A,0〉 to the state 〈C,10〉. \nNext, the stamp-dealer takes out stamp B from a drawer, and\noffers her to swap C for B, against another payment\nof 10 cents. She accepts, thus moving from the state\n〈C,10〉 to 〈B,20〉. The shop-owner\ncan go on like this forever. What causes the trouble is the following\nsequence of preferences: \n〈C,10〉 ≻ 〈A,0〉\n\n〈B,20〉 ≻ 〈C,10〉\n\n〈A,30〉 ≻ 〈B,20〉\n\n〈C,40〉 ≻ 〈A,30〉\n\n〈B,50〉 ≻ 〈C,40〉\n\n〈A,60〉 ≻ 〈B,50〉\n\n…\n \nThe money-pump argument relies on a particular, far from\nuncontroversial, way to combine preferences in two dimensions, which\nis only possible if two crucial assumptions are satisfied: (1) The\nprimary alternatives (the stamps) can be combined with some other\ncommodity (money) to form composite alternatives. (2) Irrespectively\nof the previous transactions there is always, for each preferred\nchange of primary alternatives, some non-zero loss of the auxiliary\ncommodity (money) that is worth that change. The money-pump can be\nused to extract money from a subject with cyclic preferences only if\nthese two conditions are satisfied. \nAnother argument for the normative appropriateness of preference\ntransitivity suggests that transitivity is constitutive of the meaning\nof preference, in addition to the minimal properties mentioned in\nsection 2.1. Drawing an analogy to length measurement, Davidson (1976,\n273) asks: “If length is not transitive, what does it mean to\nuse a number to measure length at all? We could find or invent an\nanswer, but unless or until we do, we must strive to interpret\n‘longer than’ so that it comes out transitive. Similarly\nfor ‘preferred to’”. Violating transitivity,\nDavidson claims, thus undermines the very meaning of preferring on\noption over others.  \nYet another argument rests on the importance of preferences for\nchoice. When agents choose at once from all the elements of an\nalternative set, then preferences should be choice guiding.\nThey should have such a structure that they can be used to guide our\nchoice among the elements of that set. But when choosing e.g. from\n{A,B,C}, a preference relation ≻ such that\nA≻B≻C≻A does not\nguide choice at all: any or none of the alternatives should be chosen\naccording to ≻. The transitivity of preference, it is therefore\nsuggested, is a necessary condition for a meaningful connection\nbetween preferences and choice. A critic, however, can point out that\npreferences are important even when they cannot guide choices. Take\ne.g. preferences over lottery outcomes: these are real preferences,\nregardless of the fact that one cannot choose between lottery\noutcomes. Further, the necessary criteria for choice guidance are much\nweaker than weak transitivity (Hansson 2001, 23–25; compare also\nversions of decision theory in which transitivity fails, e.g. Fishburn\n1991). Last, the indifference relation does not satisfy choice\nguidance either. That does not make it irrational to be indifferent\nbetween alternatives. Thus choice guidance can be an argument for the\nnormative appropriateness of transitivity only under certain\nrestrictions, if at all (For further discussion, see Anand 1993).  \nOne more property of preference relations needs to be specified. A\nrelation is antisymmetric if \nA≽B ∧ B≽A →\nA=B    (antisymmetry of\npreference)\n \nThe categories summarized in the table below (based on Sen 1970a) are\nstandardly used to denominate preference relations that satisfy\ncertain logical properties. \nSections 2.1–2.4 were devoted to exclusionary preferences, i.e.\npreferences that refer to a set of mutually exclusive alternatives. In\npractice, people also have preferences between relata that are not\nmutually exclusive. These are called combinative preferences.\n \nRelata of combinative preferences typically are not specified enough\nto be mutually exclusive. To say that one prefers having a dog over\nhaving a cat does neglect the possibility that one may have both at\nthe same time. Depending on how one interprets it, this preference\nexpression may say very different things. It may mean that one prefers\na dog (and no cat) to a cat (and no dog). Or, if one already has a\ncat, it may mean that one prefers a dog and a cat to just having a\ncat. Or, if one already has a dog, it may mean that one prefers just a\ndog to both a cat and a dog. Combinative preferences are usually taken\nto have states of affairs as their relata. These are represented by\nsentences in sentential logic. It is usually assumed that logically\nequivalent expressions can be substituted for each other. \nProperties such as completeness, transitivity and acyclicity can be\ntransferred from exclusionary to combinative preferences. In addition,\nthere are interesting logical properties that can be expressed with\ncombinative preferences but not with exclusionary preferences. The\nfollowing are some examples of these (some of which are\ncontroversial): \np≽q →\np≽(p∨q)≽q\n   (disjunctive interpolation)\n \np≽q →\n¬q≽¬p\n   (contraposition of weak preference)\n \np∼q → ¬q∼¬p\n   (contraposition of indifference)\n \np≻q → ¬q≻\n¬p    (contraposition of strict\npreference)\n \np≽q ↔\n(p∧¬q)≽(q∧¬p)\n   (conjunctive expansion of weak preference)\n \np≻q ↔\n(p∧¬q)≻(q∧¬p)\n   (conjunctive expansion of strict\npreference)\n \np∼q ↔\n(p∧¬q)∼(q∧¬p)\n   (conjunctive expansion of indifference)\n \n(p∨q)≽r ↔\np≽r ∧ q≽r\n   (left disjunctive distribution of ≽)\n \np≽(q∨r) ↔\np≽q ∧ p≽r\n   (right disjunctive distribution of ≽)\n \nCombinative preferences can be derived from exclusionary preferences,\nwhich are then taken to be more basic. In most variants of this\napproach, the underlying alternatives (to which the exclusionary\npreferences refer) have been possible worlds, represented by maximal\nconsistent subsets of the language (Rescher 1967, von Wright 1972). \nHowever, it has been argued that a more realistic\napproach should be based on smaller alternatives that cover all the\naspects under consideration – but not all the aspects that might\nhave been considered. This approach may be seen as an application of\nSimon’s “bounded rationality view” (Simon 1957,\n196–200). \nThe derivation of combinative preferences from exclusionary\npreferences can be produced with a representation function. By this is\nmeant a function f that takes us from a pair\n〈p,q〉 of sentences to a set\nf(〈p,q〉) of pairs of alternatives\n(perhaps possible worlds). Then\np≽fq holds if and only if\nA≽B for all 〈A,B〉\n∈ f(〈p,q〉) (Hansson 2001,\n70–73). \nIn addition to the comparative notions, “better” and\n“of equal value”, informal discourse on values contains\nmonadic (one-place) value predicates, such as “good”,\n“best”, “very bad”, “fairly good”,\netc. Predicates representing these notions can be inserted into a\nformal structure that contains a preference relation. \nTwo major attempts have been made to define the principal monadic\npredicates “good” and “bad” in terms of the\npreference relation. One of these defines “good” as\n“better than its negation” and “bad” as\n“worse than its negation” (Brogan 1919). \nGN p ↔ p≻¬p\n   (negation-related good)\n \nBN p ↔ ¬p≻p\n   (negation-related bad)\n \nThe other definition requires that we introduce, prior to\n“good” and “bad”, a set of neutral\npropositions. Goodness is predicated of everything that is better than\nsome neutral proposition, and badness of everything that is worse than\nsome neutral proposition. The best-known variant of this approach was\nproposed by Chisholm and Sosa (1966). According to these authors, a\nstate of affairs is indifferent if and only if it is neither better\nnor worse than its negation. Furthermore, a state of affairs is good\nif and only if it is better than some indifferent state of affairs,\nand bad if and only if some indifferent state of affairs is better\nthan it. \nGI p ↔\n(∃q)(p≻q∼¬q)\n   (indifference-related good)\n \nBI p ↔\n(∃q)(¬q∼q≻p)\n   (indifference-related bad)\n \nThe negation-related and the indifference-related “good”\nrespectively “bad” do not necessarily coincide. Both\ndefinitions have been developed with complete preference relations in\nmind, but extensions are available that cover the more general cases.\n(Hansson 2001) \nA proposal for defining preferences in terms of the monadic predicates\nfor “good” and “bad” was put forward by van\nBenthem (1982, p. 195). It assumes that goodness and badness are\ndefined in relation to an alternative set, so that for instance\nG{x,y}x means that x is\ngood among the alternatives in {x,y} and\nB{x,z,w}x that x is bad\namong the alternatives in {x,z,w}. This gives rise to the\nfollowing definitions:  \nx ≻ y if and only if\nG{x,y}x &\n¬G{x,y}y (goodness-based\npreference)\n \nx ≻ y if and only if\nB{x,y}y &\n¬B{x,y}x (badness-based\npreference)\n \nHowever, these two definitions are not equivalent, and neither of them\nis plausible in all cases. For instance, let x be good and\nnot bad in the context {x,y}, and let y be neither\ngood nor bad in the same context. Then x ≻ y\nholds according to first definition but ¬(x ≻\ny) according to the second. To avoid such problems, Hansson\nand Liu (2014) proposed the following definition:  \nx ≻ y if and only if either\nG{x,y}x &\n¬G{x,y}y or\nB{x,y}y &\n¬B{x,y}x (bivalently based\npreference)\n \nPreferences can be represented numerically.\nA≻B is then expressed by a numerical utility\nfunction u that assigns a higher value to A than to\nB, while A∼B is represented by\nassigning the same value to the two. Such numerical representations\nmight serve different purposes, one being that utility functions can\nbe analysed with the tools of maximisation under constraints, as done\nin economics. It is important, however, to stress the limitations of\nsuch representations. First, not all preferences can be represented\nnumerically. Second, there are different scales by which preferences\ncan be represented, which require premises of different strengths.\nThird, the resulting utility representation must be clearly\ndistinguished from the older hedonistic concept of utility.  \nThe simplest form of numerical representation stipulates the following\nequivalence:  \nA≻B iff\nu(A)>u(B)\n   (Ordinal representation)\n \nAny function u that assigns a larger number to A\nthan to B will work as such a representation. Consequently,\nthe function u can be replaced with any function\nu’ as long as u’ is a positive\nmonotone transformation of u. As this transformation\nproperty is the defining characteristic of ordinal scales, we\ncall this an ordinal preference representation (See the entry on\n  measurement in science.) \nA preference relation has an ordinal representation only if it\nsatisfies both completeness and transitivity. However, even if\nA is finite, there can be\ncomplete and transitive preference relations on A\nthat cannot be represented by a utility\nfunction (for a counter-example based on a lexicographic preference\nrelation, see Debreu\n 1954).[2] \nAn incomplete preference ordering also has a value\nrepresentation of the following type: \nIf A≻B, then\nu(A)>u(B)\n \nThe inverse is obviously not true. However, under fairly wide\ncircumstances, given the set of all utility functions thus\ndefined, one can find the preference relation (Aumann 1962).  \nOrdinal numerical representations of preference are just a convenient\ntool – they do not represent any information that cannot be\nrepresented by the relation ≻ itself. However, there is\nrelevant information about preferences that is not represented by the\nrelation ≻ itself. For example, when an agent expresses\ntwo preferences, say A≻B and\nC≻B, one might ask how much the agent\nprefers A to B, in particular in comparison how much\nshe prefers C to B. To answer this question, one\nneeds to determine both a measurement procedure for measuring\npreference intensities and a measurement scale for representing these\nmeasurements.  \nMeasurement scales that represent magnitudes of intervals between\nproperties, or even magnitudes of ratios between properties, are\ncalled cardinal scales. Although the discussion in the social\nsciences often merely distinguishes between ordinal and cardinal\npreference measures, it is important to further distinguish between\ninterval and ratio scales among the latter, as these require different\nassumptions to hold. An interval scale allows for meaningful\ncomparisons of differences. (43 °C is as much hotter than 41\n°C as 29 °C is hotter than 27 °C.) In addition, a ratio\nscale is allows for meaningful comparisons of ratios. (12 m is twice\nas long as 6 m.) Although there have been some attempts to measure\npreferences on a ratio scale (in particular, see Kahneman and\nTversky’s (1979) Prospect Theory, which requires a\nnatural zero point and thus a ratio scale), most efforts have focussed\non measuring preferences on an interval scale.  \nThe basic idea of interval preference measurement is to assume that\nacts have uncertain consequences, and that each act is equivalent to a\nlottery between these outcomes. An agent who expresses a preference\nfor an act over others by choosing it thus expresses a preference for\nthe equivalent lottery over the lotteries equivalent to other acts.\nThe utilities of these acts are then determined as the expected\nutilities of the equivalent lotteries, calculated as the\nprobability-weighted average of the lottery’s consequences. This\napproach was pioneered by Ramsey (1928) and refined by von Neumann and\nMorgenstern (1944); other approaches have been presented by Savage\n(1954/72) and Jeffrey (1965/90). There are substantial differences\nbetween these approaches and their respective assumptions. For more\ndetail, see\n decision theory. \nAs mentioned in section 3.1, all transitive and complete preference\nrelations can be represented by a utility function according to the\nfollowing simple relationship \nA≻B iff\nu(A)\n>\nu(B)\n \nHowever, as can be seen from the Sorites paradox discussed in section\n2.3, this recipe for the representation of preferences is too\ndemanding for some purposes. If u(A)>\nu(B), but\nu(A)-u(B) is so small that it\ncannot be discerned, then A≻B cannot be\nexpected to hold. One way to represent this feature is to employ a\ncardinal utility function and to introduce a fixed limit of\nindiscernibility, such that A≻B holds if and\nonly if u(A)−u(B) is larger\nthan that limit. Such a limit is commonly called a just noticeable\ndifference (JND). \nA≻B iff\nu(A)−u(B)>δ,\n   (JND representation, δ>0)\n \nIf the set of alternatives is finite, then ≽ has a JND\nrepresentation if and only if ≽ is complete, and satisfies the\ntwo properties that for all\nA,B,C,D:\nA≻B ∧ B≻C →\nA≻D ∨ D≻C and\nA≻B ∧ C≻D →\nA≻D ∨ C≻B. \nAnother interesting construction is to assign to each alternative an\ninterval instead of a single number. This requires two real-valued\nfunctions, umax and umin, such\nthat for all A, umax(A)≥\numin(A). Here,\numax(A) represents the upper limit of the\ninterval assigned to A, and\numin(A) its lower limit. A\n≻B holds if and only if all elements of the interval\nassigned to A have higher value than all elements of the\nB interval: \nA≻B iff\numin(A)>\numax(B)    (Interval\nrepresentation)\n \nIt has been shown that a preference relation ≽ has an interval\nrepresentation if and only if it satisfies completeness and the\nproperty that for all A,B,C,D:\nA≻B ∧ C≻D →\nA≻D ∨ C≻B. \nA final generalization is to let the threshold of discrimination\ndepend on both relata. \nA≻B iff\nu(A)−u(B)>σ(A,\nB)    (Doubly variable threshold\nrepresentation, σ(A,B)>0)\n \nIf the set of alternatives is finite, then ≽ has a doubly\nvariable threshold representation if and only if it satisfies\nacyclicity. \nFor more details on these representations, see Scott and Suppes (1958)\nand Abbas (1995)  \nIn practical decision making, there are often several preference\nrelations that have to be taken into account. The different preference\nrelations represent different aspects of the subject matter concerned\nby the decision. For instance, when choosing among alternative\narchitectural designs for a new building, we will have a whole set of\naspects, each of which can be expressed with a preference relation:\ncosts, sustainability, aesthetics, fire safety etc. In some cases, the\nvarious preference relations represent the wishes or interests of\ndifferent persons. This applies for instance when a group of people\nwith different preferences plan a joint vacation trip.  \nThe most convenient way to represent problems with multiple preference\naspects is to introduce a vector 〈\n≽1,…,≽n 〉 whose\nelements are the preference relations we have to take into account.\nFor simplicity, we can assume that all these preferences are complete\n(or we can treat incompleteness as indifference). We can call such a\nvector conflict free if and only if it has no elements\n≽k and ≽m such\nthat X ≻kY and Y\n≻mX for any alternatives X\nand Y. If 〈\n≽1,…,≽n 〉 is\nconflict free, then we can define a combined preference relation\n≽ such that (1) X≻Y if there is some\n≽k such that\nX≻kY, (2)\nY≻X if there is some\n≽k such that\nY≻kX, and (3) otherwise\nX∼Y. This is a plausible construction for\nconflict free preferences, since the combined preference relation does\nnot contradict any of the strict preferences expressed in the\ncomponent vectors.  \nFor conflictual preference vectors, i.e. vectors that are not\nconflict free, there is no such simple solution that is plausible in\nall applications. There are four common ways to deal with conflicts\namong preferences. \n1. Reduction to a single dimension. Such reductions are\nusually performed by first translating all preference relations into\nsome numerical value, and then, for each alternative, adding up the\nvalues assigned to it for all aspects. In utilitarian moral\nphilosophy, a fictional value unit, “utile”, is used for\nthis purpose. In economics, monetary units are used. Such reductions\nare standardly used in cost-benefit analysis. However in many cases\nthere is uncertainty or disagreement on how the reductions should be\nperformed.  \n2. Assuming that all conflicts cancel each other out. This\namounts to extending the above definition of a combined preference\nrelation so that X∼Y will hold in all cases of\nconflict, i.e. whenever there are ≽k and\n≽m such that X\n≻kY and Y\n≻mX. Although usually not expressed\nin this way, this is the effect of applying efficiency as the sole\ncriterion (e.g. Pareto efficiency as the sole criterion in a\nmulti-person case). This method has the obvious disadvantage that it\nsometimes lets a small disadvantage in one dimension outweigh a large\nadvantage in another dimension.  \n3. Majoritarian solutions. Another way to deal with conflicts\nis to look for the alternatives that are favoured by most (although\nnot all) of the preference relations. This requires that the aspects\ncovered by the different preference relations are valued equally.\nTherefore, this solution is commonly used when the elements of the\nvector correspond to the wishes or interests of different persons, but\nnot when they correspond to more general aspects of a decision (such\nas sustainability and aesthetics in the example of of choosing an\narchitectural design).  \n4. Intuitive weighing. In practice, decision makers often\nweigh different preference dimensions against each other intuitively,\nwithout any prior attempt to reduce the multi-dimensionality of the\ndecision. This way of dealing with multiple preferences has practical\nadvantages, but it also has the disadvantage of lacking efficient\nmechanisms for ensuring consistency in decision-making.  \n5. Modifying at least one of the conflicting preference\nrelations. This is what happens when people involved in\nnegotiations or discussions approach each other’s views in ways that\nmake their preference relations less conflicting. The Delphi method is\na systematized procedure that can be used to reduce interindividual\ndifferences in preferences. On an intraindividual level, strivings for\na reflective equilibrium can take the form of adjusting preference\nrelations that concern different aspects of an issue to each\nother. From a psychological point of view, such changes can be\ndescribed as reductions of cognitive dissonance in value issues. \nVoting procedures are often described as methods for aggregating or\ncombining preferences. Such aggregation can also be performed by a\nbenevolent planner striving to take the wishes and/or interests of all\nconcerned persons into account. The aggregation of preferences is a\nmajor topic of social choice theory. See the entry on \n social choice theory. \nConsider again the choice among alternative architectural designs for\na new building. As indicated above, our preferences can be expressed\nwith a vector 〈\n≽1,…,≽n 〉, each of\nwhose elements represents our partial preferences with\nrespect to some particular aspect such as sustainability or\naesthetics. If we manage to aggregate the vector to a single\npreference relation ≽, then ≽ represents our total\npreferences, or, as they are also called, our “preferences\ntout court” or “preferences all things\nconsidered”.  \nSome authors have argued that the preference notion in economics\nalways refers to total preferences (Hausman 2012). However, there are\nalso economists who recognize partial preferences, often identifying\nthem with preferences over properties or characteristics of economic\ngoods (Lancaster 1966). In contrast, philosophers often treat partial\npreferences as referring to different reasons that one may have to\nprefer one of the options to another (Pettit 1991, Osherson and\nWeinstein 2012).  \nAuthors who recognize partial preferences usually give them priority,\nand consider total preferences to be completely determined by the\npartial preferences. In other words, they assume that a total\npreference relation is uniquely determined by the partial preference\nrelations through a process of aggregation. There are different views\non the nature of this process. According to a quantitative\napproach, each partial preference is connected with a cardinal partial\nutility function for the aspect in question, and the total preference\nrelation can be obtained by aggregating these partial utility\nfunctions using an appropriate set of weights. This requires strong\nassumptions of preference independence in order to justify additivity\nof utility (Keeney and Raiffa 1993).  \nAn alternative strategy employs tools from social choice\ntheory to map a vector of partial preferences into a total\npreference relation. This approach only makes use of ordinal\ninformation, and disregards any utility information that has no impact\non the partial preference relations. Unsurprisingly, the impossibility\nresults of social choice theory affect this method. Steedman and\nKrause (1986) have shown that there is no rule for deriving total\npreferences from a preference vector that satisfies four seemingly\nplausible conditions and also yields a transitive and complete total\npreference ordering. When applied to an intrapersonal conflict this\nmeans that an agent may be rational in the sense of having a complete\nand transitive (partial) relation for each of the aspects, but may\nstill be irrational either in the sense of not satisfying plausible\nconditions on the relations between partial and total preferences, or\nin the sense of not having a complete and transitive total preference\nordering for her overall appraisal of the options in question. This\nargument connects with a long philosophical tradition, including Plato\nand Bishop Butler, that draws an analogy between intrapersonal\nconflicts and citizens’ conflicting preferences within a state.\n \nThere are also authors who reject the idea that total preferences are\nuniquely derivable from partial preferences. Instead they claim that\ntotal preferences are constructed at the moment of\nelicitation, and thus influenced by contexts and framings of the\nelicitation procedure that are not encoded in pre-existing partial\npreferences (Payne, Bettman and Johnson 1993). Total preferences seem\nto be influenced by direct affective responses that are independent of\ncognitive processes (Zajone 1980). For instance, food preferences seem\nto be partly determined by habituation and are therefore difficult to\nexplain as the outcome of a process exclusively based on well-behaved\npartial preferences. According to this view, partial preferences are\nin many cases ex post rationalisations of total preferences,\nrather than the basis from which total preferences are derived.  \nA closely related standpoint was expressed by Nozick (1981, 244):\n“Reasons do not come with previously assigned weights; the\ndecision process is not one of discovering such precise weights but of\nassigning them. The process not only weighs reasons, it (also) weights\nthem.” According to Kranz (1991, 34), “[p]eople do and\nshould act as problem solvers, not maximizers, because they have\nmany different and incommensurable … goals to achieve”.\nMuch in the same vein, Levi (1986, 246) maintained that “an\nagent may terminate deliberation and take decisions without having\nresolved the moral, political, economic and aesthetic conflicts\nrelevant to their predicaments”.  \nThere is a strong tradition, particularly in economics, to relate\npreference to choice. Preference is linked to hypothetical choice, and\nchoice to revealed preference. We begin this section by presenting\nchoice functions and some of their main properties. We then proceed to\ndiscuss how choice functions and their properties can be derived from\npreferences. Finally we view the relationship from the other end, and\nintroduce some approaches to inferring preferences from observed\nchoices. \nGiven an alternative set A, we can\nrepresent (hypothetical) choice as a function C that,\nfor any given subset B of A,\ndelivers those elements of B\nthat a deliberating agent has not ruled out\nfor choice. For brevity’s sake we will call them ‘chosen\nelements’. The formal definition of a choice function is as\nfollows: \nC is a choice function for A\nif and only if it is a function such that\nfor all B ⊆ A:\n(1) C(B)\n⊆ B,\nand (2) if B\n≠ ∅, then \nC(B) ≠\n∅.\n \nA large number of rationality properties have been proposed for choice\nfunctions. The two most important of these are described here. \nIf B ⊆ A\nthen B ∩\nC(A)\n⊆ C(B)\n   (Property\nα, “Chernoff”)\n \nThis property states that if some element of subset B\nof A is chosen\nfrom A, then it is also chosen from\nB. According to property α,\nremoving some of the alternatives that are not chosen does not\ninfluence choice. This property has often been assumed to hold, but\ncounterarguments have been raised against it. Consider the following\nexample. Erna is invited to an acquaintance’s house for\ndinner. Her choice for dessert is between an apple (which is the last\npiece of fruit in the fruit basket) (X) and nothing instead\n(Y). Because Erna is polite, she chooses Y. Had she\nfaced a choice between an apple (X), nothing (Y) and\nan orange (Z), she would have taken the apple. Thus her\nchoices are: \nC({X,Y,Z}) ={X}\n \nand \nC({X,Y}) ={Y},\n \nwhich violate property α. More generally, property α has\nbeen contested with reference to cases when alternatives are preferred\nfor their position in an alternative set, when the set of alternatives\nitself constitutes important information about the alternative chosen,\nor when certain alternatives provide the chooser with the freedom to\nreject them (Sen 1993,\n 501–503).[3] \nThe second property states that if X and Y are both\nchosen from B, a subset of A,\nthen one of them cannot be chosen in A\nwithout the other also being chosen. \nIf B ⊆ A\nand X, Y ∈\nC(B), then\nX ∈ C(A)\niff Y ∈ C(A)\n   (Property\nβ)\n \nTo exemplify property β, suppose that we have three restaurants,\nX, Y and Z, within walking distance, and\ntwo additional restaurants, V and W, that we can\nreach by car. Furthermore suppose that we begin by choosing among the\nrestaurants within walking distance. We agree that the choice is\nbetween X and Y, but we find no reasons to choose\none of them rather than the other, i.e. C({X, Y,\nZ})={X, Y}. Then we find out that we do in fact have access to a car.\nProperty β says that if X is one of the chosen\nrestaurants in this situation, then so is Y, and vice versa.\nIn other words: X∈C({X,\nY, Z, V, W}) holds if and only if\nY ∈C({X, Y, Z,\nV, W}).  \nA third property, γ, is described in\n footnote.[4] \nThe above properties are mainly found in the social choice literature.\nA related property in the economic literature is the so-called\nWeak Axiom of Revealed Preferences (WARP). It says that if\nX is chosen when Y is available, then there must not\nbe an alternative set B containing both\nalternatives for which Y is chosen and X is not.\n \nIf X,Y∈A\nand X∈C(A),\nthen for all B,\nif X∈B,\nand\nY∈C(B),\nthen X∈C(B)\n   (WARP)\n \nWARP is equivalent to the combination of properties α and β\n(Sen 1971, 50). A stronger version, SARP, is discussed in the first\npart of the supplementary document \n The Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference\n  \nCounterexamples have been offered to show that these properties are\nnot plausible in all situations. Consider an agent who chooses to stay\nat a friend’s house for a cup of tea (T) rather than to\ngo home (H), but who leaves in a hurry when the friend offers\na choice between tea and cocaine (C) at his next visit. Then\nC({T,H}) ={T} and\nC({T,H,C}) ={H}, and hence the\nvisitor violates both properties α and β.  \nA choice function that is defined on the basis of a preference\nrelation is called relational (also binary). The\nmost obvious way to construct a choice function from a preference\nrelation ≽ is to have the function always choose the elements\nthat are best according to ≽: \nThe best choice connectionCB(B) =\n{X ∈ B |\n∀Y ∈ B:\n(X≽Y)} \n \nCB is a choice function (i.e. satisfies\nthe defining criteria for a choice function given in section 5.1) if\nand only if ≽ is complete and acyclical. It will then \nsatisfy properties α and γ. Furthermore,\nCB satisfies property β if and only\nif ≽ is transitive and complete (Sen 1970a, 19). \nWhen the underlying preference relation is incomplete, there may not\nbe an element that is preferred to all other elements. A function\nC constructed according to the best choice connection\nwill then be empty, and hence not a choice function. To avoid this, an\nalternative connection constructs the choice function as choosing\nthose elements that are not dispreferred to any other elements of the\nset: \nThe non-dominance choice connectionCL(B) =\n{X ∈ B |\n∀Y ∈ B:\n¬(Y≻X)}\n \nCL is a choice function if and only if\n≽ is acyclical. It will then satisfy properties\nα and γ. Furthermore, CL\nsatisfies property β if and only if ≽ is transitive and\ncomplete (Herzberger 1973). \nWhen the preference relation over A is\ncyclical, neither CB nor\nCL may be a relational choice function for\nA. In the simplest case, with a cyclical\npreference\nA≻B≻C≻A,\nCB(A,B,C) =\nCL(A,B,C) =\n∅. Schwarz (1972) therefore proposes a third relational choice\nfunction, which operates even on the basis of cyclical preferences.\nIts basic idea is to select elements that are not dominated by\nnon-cyclical preference. \nThe close connections between preference axioms and choice axioms can\nalso be employed to construct a preference ordering from a choice\nfunction that satisfies certain axioms. In economics, the revealed\npreference approach has been used to define preference in terms\nof choice. Historically, this approach developed out of the pursuit of\nbehaviouristic foundations for economic theories—i.e. the\nattempt to eliminate the preference framework altogether. Today, it\nserves to derive preference orderings from an agent’s observed\nchoices, and to test the empirical validity of the preference axioms\nby testing for the violation of choice axioms (Grüne-Yanoff\n2004). \nThere are many ways to construct preference relations from observed\nchoices. The simplest defines an alternative X as “at\nleast as good as” an alternative Y if and only if\nX is chosen from some set of alternatives that also contains\nY. \nIf the choice function is defined over all subsets of B,\n≽S is complete.\n≻S does not necessarily satisfy transitivity\nof strict preference, transitivity of indifference, IP- or\nPI-transitivity. Two further methods are described in the\nsupplementary document: \n The Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference\n  \nThe above-discussed theoretical effort sees preferences as completely\ntied to choices. Various caveats concerning this connection are in\norder. First, it must be pointed out that choices and preferences are\nin fact entities of quite different categories. Preferences are\nstates of mind whereas choices are actions. The\nstrong behaviourist program, which sought to eliminate the notion of\npreference by reducing it to choices, is therefore rightly regarded\nwith suspicion today (Hausman 2012).  \nSecondly, it is necessary to distinguish between those agents who\nindeed have preferences as states of minds—e.g. humans, and\nmaybe higher animals—and those agents who do not—e.g.\nmachines, plants or institutions. The former category may choose on\nthe basis of their preferences, and hence the above-discussed effort\ncan aim at eliciting the preferences on which their choices are based.\nThe latter category, despite their lack of states of mind, may\nnevertheless exhibit behaviour that can be interpreted as relational\nchoice. In those cases, one can only speak of preferences\nreconstructed from choice, without claiming that these\npreferences describe mental states at all (Gul and Pesendorfer 2008,\nHands 2013, Ross 2014).  \nThirdly, it seems obvious that there are preferences over alternatives\nthat one cannot choose between—for example preferences for\nwinning a certain prize of a lottery, or for particular configurations\nof Paradise. This contradicts the claim that preferences exclusively\ntranspire from choices. One way to substantiate preferences over\nalternatives that one cannot choose between is to ask people what they\nprefer. Their answers can be interpreted as further choice\nevidence—as verbal or writing behaviour. This\ninterpretation treats their answers on a par with all other forms of\nbehaviour. It thus acknowledges that their answers are possibly\ninfluenced by other preferences, e.g. for privacy, status or pretend\nplay, and explains why answers may not be true. Alternatively, their\nanswers can be interpreted as introspective reports. This\ninterpretation treats answers as agents’ privileged access to\ntheir own minds; and it becomes difficult to explain\n“false” answers.  \nFourthly, some choices are not based on stable preferences over\nactions, but are constructed from more basic cognitive and evaluative\nelements. A simple choice—like e.g. choosing between two pieces\nof candy—might be based on a preference for a world in which one\neats candy X over a world in which one eats candy Y.\nBut more complex choices—e.g. choosing one’s higher\neducation—depend on what one believes these choices to\nbring about, and how one evaluates the consequences of these choices.\nIn those cases, a more complex framework specifies beliefs about the\nprobability or plausibility of possible states of the world,\npreferences over the consequences of choices in those worlds, and an\naggregation mechanism of these preferences under those beliefs. Often,\nthis framework yields a preference relation over actions much like the\nsimple case. However, alternative frameworks have been developed in\nwhich this is not the case (e.g. Loomes and Sugden 1982).  \nLast, the introspective concept of preference is closely connected to\nthe notion of welfare. An agent who prefers X to\nY is expected to judge herself to be better off with\nX than with Y. But if preferences are tightly linked\nto choice, the welfare interpretation is jeopardized. As Sen argues,\npeople choose not only on the basis of their concern for their own\nwelfare, but also on the basis of commitments—e.g.\ntraditions, habits, moral maxims, etc. (Sen 1977). So it seems that\npreferences can either be interpreted as welfare judgements,\nor as the basis of choices, but not as both at the same time.\nWe discuss the relation of preference and welfare in the next\nsection. \nPreference relates to welfare in rather intricate ways. Welfare is a\nfundamental concept in moral philosophy and economics. It refers to\nthe fundamental good for individual human beings, and it is therefore\nan anthropocentric and individualist concept. In order to clarify the\nrelationship between preference and welfare we need to distinguish\nbetween three variants of the concept of welfare.  \nAccording to the material view, a person’s welfare is a\nmatter of her material conditions, such as access to food, shelter,\nhealthcare and, generally speaking, the necessities and perhaps\nluxuries of life. This view of welfare has been criticized for being\nmaterialistic in the sense of pursuing material possessions at the\nexpense of higher values. It also has to face the difficulties\ninherent in weighing different material goods against each other.  \nThe other two principal views both treat welfare as a mental rather\nthan a material issue. The wish-based mental view uses each\nperson’s wishes (i.e. preferences in the informal sense of that\nword) as the criterion of welfare (Sen 1979). A person is considered\nto have more welfare, the more her wishes are satisfied. If this view\nis applied within a utilitarian framework, then it gives rise to\npreference utilitarianism. This view of welfare has difficulties in\ndealing with misinformed and self-defeating wishes. It can also have\ndifficulties with certain types of other-regarding wishes, e.g.\nmalevolent ones. The usual way to deal with this is to require that\npreferences are filtered (“laundered”) and/or refined\nbefore they are used to judge a person’s welfare.  \nThe filtering (“laundering”) of preferences can be\njustified by the everyday experience that some preferences are much\nmore important for a person’s well-being than others. It can be\nargued that a plausible preference-based account of welfare cannot be\nbased on total preferences, but would have to be based on a subset of\n“core” preferences that are important for the individual.\nThe determination of that subset is expectedly contentious. If it is\nto be determined by others than the individual whose welfare is\nconcerned, then problems of paternalism will be difficult to avoid.\n \nRefinement of preferences is usually assumed to result in the\nperson’s (hypothetical) “rational” or “ideally\nconsidered” preferences. “My ideally considered\npreferences are those I would have if I were to engage in\nthoroughgoing deliberation about my preferences with full pertinent\ninformation, in a calm mood, while thinking clearly and making no\nreasoning errors.” (Arneson 1989, 83; cf. Brandt 1979 and Rosati 2009) A problem\nfor this view is that there does not seem to be any easy way to\ndetermine, based on a person’s preferences and circumstances,\nwhat her ideally considered preferences would be.  \nFinally, the state-dependent mental view identifies a\nperson’s welfare with some mental state such as happiness or\nsatisfaction. It is assumed that the relevant states of mind can at\nleast in principle be judged by external assessors. If such a view is\napplied within a utilitarian framework, then it can give rise to\nhedonistic utilitarianism. This view can be criticized for paternalism\nand for being uncritical towards arrangements in which individuals are\nhappy in spite of being oppressed or deprived. Furthermore, the\ndifficulties involved in comparing mental properties such as happiness\nin different persons creates a problem for views that depend on such\ncomparisons for the determination of welfare. However, recent work on\nthe measurement of happiness and life satisfaction has challenged that\nview, and may have opened up new avenues for research in both\neconomics and moral philosophy. (Ng 1997)  \nOnly one of these three views, namely the wish-based one, refers to\nwhat we usually call preferences. However, the other two can also be\nexpressed in terms of preference (betterness) relations. We can use\nsuch relations to order material conditions respectively mental states\nin terms of how they satisfy the criteria of welfare that we have\nchosen to apply. It is important to distinguish between on the one\nhand preferences in the common sense of comparative likings, and on\nthe other hand the use of a preference relation to express grades of\nany property whose structure satisfies the common formal requirement\nof such a relation.  \nA common problem for attempts to account for welfare in terms of\npreference is that we expect a person’s view of her own welfare\nto be essentially self-regarding, but her preferences can refer to\nconcerns that are not self-regarding, such as her concerns for other\npeople, her views on social justice, and her commitments for instance\nto traditions, conventions, and moral ideas (Sen 1977). Our choices\nare influenced by this wide range of preferences. Therefore, it does\nnot seem possible to link preferences strongly to welfare and at the\nsame time link them strongly to choice.  \nPreferences relate to time in several ways. Preference at one point in\ntime can refer to what happens or happened at other points in time.\nFurthermore, preferences can change over time, due to changes in\nbeliefs, values, tastes, or a combination of these. Section 7.1\nexplains why preference change requires explanatory and theoretical\n treatment.[5]\n In the following sections, three types of explanatory models are\ndiscussed. (For more detail, see Grüne-Yanoff and Hansson 2009.) \nTime preference models (section 7.2) only refer to\nthe temporal relationship between the occurrence of a preference and\nthe objects it refers to. Doxastic change models (section\n7.3) investigate how a change of an agent’s beliefs leads to a\nchange in her preferences. Valuational change models (section\n7.4) investigate how a change in an agent’s basic evaluations\nleads to a change in her preferences. \nSome authors have argued that preference change is only a superficial\nperception, and that the underlying preferences remain stable over\ntime. But there are at least four arguments to the effect that\npeople’s preferences really do change over time. First, many\nsuccessful explanations of behavioural change have interpreted the\nempirical behavioural evidence as preference change. These\nexplanations can be differentiated into models of external\ninfluences and models of internal coherence. External\ninfluence models attempt to establish general links between external\nevents and agents’ preference formations. They include, for\nexample, social imitation (Leibenstein 1950), parental influence\n(Cavalli-Sforza 1973), habit formation (Pollack 1976), and the effect\nof production patterns on consumption (Duesenberry 1949). Internal\ncoherence models take certain external influences as given, and model\npreference change as an accommodation of these external influences.\nThey include, for example, religious convictions (Iannaccone 1990) and\nthe effect of cognitive dissonance on preferences (Elster 1982). \nA second argument for preference change is based on the correlations\nbetween physiological changes and changes in behaviour. Changes in\nblood sugar levels, for example, are correlated to feeding behaviour,\nsexual behaviour varies with hormonal changes, and many behavioural\npatterns change with increasing age (for references and discussion,\nsee Loewenstein 1996). These correlations are not deterministic, such\nbehavioural changes can be resisted in many cases. It is plausible to\nincorporate these potential physiological effects as visceral\npreferences in the general preference framework, and to treat the\nrelevant physiological changes as closely connected with preference\nchanges. \nThird, most humans have introspective evidence for their own\npreferences changing over time. The favourite activities of a child\nare replaced by new pleasures as we grow up. Thus was the experience\nof Shakespeare’s Benedick: “…but doth not the\nappetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot\nendure in his age” (Much ado about nothing Act II,\nScene III). Even in adult life, we are literally overcome by sudden\nand very radical (\"transformative\") changes of preference. Laurie A. Paul (2014) has investigated the types of decision-making that this involves. It would be strange to\nclaim in such cases that it is only our beliefs about the different types of\nactivities that change. Explanations in terms of preference change are\nmuch more in line with how we spontaneously interpret our experiences\nof such changes. \nLast, certain concepts like taste refinement or self-restraint cannot\neasily be understood without a notion of real preference change. In\nparticular, self-restraint presupposes that the motivational\ncomponents of one’s self can change, for example, through\nmaturation or social influence; and that one can and should plan\none’s future self by curbing certain appetites or by designing\nthe environment in ways that affect one’s preferences. \nThe value that we assign to obtaining an advantage or disadvantage\nusually varies with the point in time when we obtain it. In typical\ncases, values decrease with time. For instance, most of us would\nprefer receiving a large sum of money now to receiving it five years\nlater. Analytically, this temporal factor of evaluations is often\nseparated from time-independent factors of evaluations. \nThe standard approach to this issue in economic analysis treats\npreference as based on value. Value is dealt with in a bifactorial\nmodel, in which the value of a future good is assumed to be equal to\nthe product of two factors. One of these factors is a time-independent\nevaluation of the good in question, i.e. the value of obtaining it\nimmediately. The other factor represents the subject’s pure time\npreferences. It is a function of the length of the delay, and is the\nsame for all types of goods. The most common type of time preference\nfunction can be written \nv(A,ti) =\nv(A,ti−1) / (1 +\nr)t\n \nwhere r is a discount rate and t =\nti−ti−1 the duration of the\ndelay. This is the discounted utility model, proposed by\nSamuelson (1937), which still dominates in economic analysis. \nThe choice of a discount rate can have a large impact on the\ncalculated values. It is therefore often politically controversial. As\none example of this, the discount rate used in assessing the economic\neffects of climate change can have significant consequences for the\npolicy recommendations that are based on these assessments. \nThere is a some evidence that the standard discounted utility model\ndoes not adequately represent human behaviour. For a simple example,\nconsider a person who prefers one apple today to two apples tomorrow,\nbut yet (today) prefers two apples in 51 days to one apple in 50 days.\nAlthough this is a plausible preference pattern, it is incompatible\nwith the exponentially discounted utility model. It can\nhowever be accounted for in a bifactorial model with a declining\ndiscount rate. Pioneered by Ainslie (1992), psychologists and\nbehavioural economists have therefore proposed to replace\nSamuelson’s exponential discounting model with a model of\nhyperbolic discounting. The hyperbolic model discounts the future\nconsumption with a parameter inversely proportional to the delay of\nthe consumption, and hence covers examples like the above.  \nOther deviations from the discounted utility model have also been\ndemonstrated. Experimental evidence indicates that we tend to discount\ngains more than losses, and small amounts more than large amounts.\nDiscount rates also differ between different goods (such as money and\nhealth). For some—but only some—types of goods, improving\nsequences of outcomes are preferred to declining sequences. These are\nall patterns that cannot be handled in the bifactorial model with its\nobject-independent time preferences (Loewenstein et al 2002). Given\nthe empirical evidence, it is an open question whether the concept of\n“time preferences” is at all descriptively adequate. \nIt is a separate question whether pure time preferences are rational.\nCritics argue that one should want one’s life, as a\nwhole, to go as well as possible, and that counting some parts of\nlife more than others interferes with this goal (Pigou, 1920; Ramsey,\n1928b; Rawls 1971). According to this view, it is irrational to prefer\na smaller immediate good to a greater future good, because now and\nlater are equally parts of one life. Choosing the smaller good or the\ngreater bad makes one’s life, as a whole, turn out worse:\n“Rationality requires an impartial concern for all parts of our\nlife. The mere difference of location in time, of something’s\nbeing earlier or later, is not a rational ground for having more or\nless regard for it” (Rawls 1971, 293). Critics of pure temporal\npreferences often attribute apparent departures from temporal\nneutrality to a cognitive illusion (which causes people to\nsee future pleasures or pains in some diminished form) or to a\nweakness of will (which causes people to choose options\nagainst their better judgment). \nAgainst the temporal neutrality of preferences, some have argued that\nthere is no enduring, irreducible entity over time to whom all future\nutility can be ascribed; they deny that all parts of one’s\nfuture are equally parts of oneself (Parfit 1984). They\nargue, instead, that a person is a succession of overlapping selves\nrelated to varying degrees by memories, physical continuities, and\nsimilarities of character and interests, etc. By this view, it may be\njust as rational to discount one’s “own” future\npreferences, as to discount the preferences of another distinct\nindividual, because the divisions between the stages of one’s\nlife may be as “deep” as the distinctions between\nindividuals. \nA quite different critical approach to discounting is connected with\nthe idea of sustainability. If sustainability is interpreted as\nmeaning that future generations should have access to the same\nresources as those that the present generation has at its disposal,\nthen sustainability is sure to be in conflict with economic policies\nbased on exponential discounting. However, there are also views on\nsustainability that allow us to use up natural resources if we replace\nthem by non-natural resources such as new technologies that will\ncompensate for the loss. Such a “weak” notion of\nsustainability appears to be compatible with policies based on\ndiscounting of future effects, but their compatibility with\nsustainability has been challenged. (Ng 2005) \nTwo kinds of beliefs are especially important for doxastic models. The\nfirst is the belief that the presence of state X makes a\ndesired state Y more likely. Take for example the belief that\nfluoride prevents dental cavities. This can lead a person to prefer\nfluoride toothpaste to others. If she comes to disbelieve this\nconnection, she may well abandon this preference. More generally, if\nX∧Y is preferred to\nX∧¬Y, then a rise of the probability that\nY given X will result in a rise in the desirability\nof X, and vice versa. \nThe second kind of belief relevant for doxastic preference change\nconcerns prospects that influence the preference for other prospects\nwithout being probabilistically related. For example, one’s\npreference for winning a trip to Florida in the lottery will crucially\ndepend on one’s belief about the weather there during the\nspecified travel time, even though these two prospects are\nprobabilistically unrelated. More generally, if\nX∧Y is preferred to\nX∧¬Y, with X and Y\nprobabilistically not correlated, then a rise of the probability that\nX will result in a rise in the desirability of Y\n(even if it does not affect the probability of Y), and vice\nversa. \nJeffrey (1977) provides a simple model of preference change as the\nconsequence of an agent coming to believe a proposition A to\nbe true. His model incorporates both kinds of belief relevant for\ndoxastic preference change. It is based on the notion of conditional\npreferences. Jeffrey treats preferences as a relation over\npropositions, viz. sets of possible worlds. They are represented by a\nutility function U (see section 2), such that: \nX≽Y iff U(X) ≥\nU(Y)\n \nU(X) in turn is defined as the weighted\naverage of the utility u of all the possible worlds\nw in which X is true: \nU(X) = [1/P(X)]\n∑w∈X [u(w)\n× P(w|X)]\n \nwhere P is the probability weight (Jeffrey’s original\nnotation here is adapted to the discrete case).\n〈u,P〉 represents the unconditional\npreference ≽ if P is the probability distribution based\non the agent’s actual information. The conditional preference\nordering ≽A, in contrast, is represented by\nthe tuple 〈u,PA〉, where\nPA is the probability distribution based on the\ncounterfactual scenario that the agent accepts proposition A\nas true. That is, the agent imagines that if he changed his whole\nbelief system from P to PA (and\nhence specifically P(A)<1 to\nPA(A)=1), then he would have the\npreference relation ≽A as represented by\n〈u,PA〉 (for more\ndiscussion on the existence and uniqueness conditions of conditional\npreferences, see Luce and Krantz 1971, Joyce 1999, chapter 4, Bradley\n1999). Jeffrey shows that the posterior utility function\nUA is related to the prior\nutility function U as follows: \nConditional preferences allow modelling doxastic preference change.\nWhat matters for an agent’s evaluation and behaviour are his\nunconditional preferences, ≽t, which are\nunconditional only in the sense that they rely on the agent’s\nactual information at time t. When the agent accepts a new\nproposition A at time t+1, his\nconditional-on-A preferences become his unconditional\npreferences at t+1: ≽t+1 =\n≽A. \nJeffrey’s model is restricted in two ways. First, it requires an\nunchanging evaluative function u defined over the atoms of\nthe propositional space, viz. possible worlds. Thus for all\ndoxastically changed preference orderings, the preferences over worlds\nremain identical. Second, the model only considers the effects of a\nbelief change to certainty. But it is plausible that one’s\npreference—say, for a vacation in Florida—changes just\nbecause one believes that it is more likely that there will be a\nhurricane next week. Jeffrey’s model can be generalised by\nintroducing a more general probability updating rule (e.g., Jeffrey\nconditionalisation). An alternative solution was proposed by Bradley\n(2005). It is based on relatively strong assumptions on the relation\nbetween prior and posterior unconditional preferences. \nAn important discussion from economics needs mentioning, namely the\nquestion whether models of doxastic preference change are capable in\nprinciple to represent all preference changes. This question\noriginates with an important paper by Stigler and Becker (1977), who\nargued that a wide range of phenomena which are commonly thought of as\npreference changes—like addiction, habitual behaviour, fashions\nand the effects of marketing—can be explained by stable,\nwell-behaved preferences. In a rather informal fashion, they argue\nthat such explanations involve only changes in information (more\nprecisely: prices and income), while leaving preferences intact. As a\nresult of this, economists largely abandoned the discussion of\npreference change, believing that all preference change phenomena can\nbe explained in this way. Prima facie, their proposed explanations\nexhibit important similarities to the discussed accounts of doxastic\npreference change. The results from that discussion, which show that\nmodels of doxastic preference change are subject to relatively strong\nconstraints, may therefore put doubt on the orthodox position in\neconomics that models of doxastic preference change are capable in\nprinciple to represent all preference changes. \nIf an agent forms a specific preference as a result of some\nexperience, further changes in her overall preference state are often\nnecessary to regain consistency. A model of preference change can\ntherefore be constructed as an input-output model in the same style as\nstandard models of belief change. (Hansson 1995, Liu 2011) Changes in\npreference are triggered by inputs that are represented by sentences\nexpressing new preference patterns. Hence, if the subject grows tired\nof her previous favourite brand of mustard, A, and starts to\nlike brand C better, then this will be represented by a\nchange with the sentence “C is better than\nA”, in formal language C≻A, as\nan input. However, a change in which the previous preference\nA≻C is replaced by the new preference\nC≻A can take place in different ways. For\ninstance, there may be a third brand B that was previously\nplaced between A and C in the preference ordering.\nThe instruction to make the new preference relation satisfy\nC≻A does not tell us where B should\nbe placed in the new ordering. The new ordering may for instance be\neither C≻A≻B or\nC≻B≻A. One way to deal with\nthis is to include additional information in the input, for instance\nspecifying which element(s) of the alternative set should be moved\nwhile the others keep their previous positions. In our example, if\nonly C is going to be moved, then the outcome should satisfy\nC≻A≻B. These and other\nconsiderations make it necessary to modify the standard model of\nbelief change in order to accommodate the subject matter of\npreferences. \nIn scholarly discussions, preferences are usually taken to be open to\nrational criticism only insofar as (i) they have been inconsistent,\nviolating some of the rationally justifiable preference axioms, or\n(ii) they (in combination with beliefs) commit the agent to\ninconsistent inferences.  \nCan there be rationally justifiable claims that certain\nintrinsic preferences – i.e preferences that are not\ndependent on other preferences – are wrong, or should be\nchanged? The Humean position answers no. Hume distinguished reason\nfrom the passion, and argued “that reason alone can never be a\nmotive to any action of the will; that it can never oppose passion in\nthe direction of the will” (Treatise, Book II, Part\nIII, Section III). Humeans often took this distinction between beliefs\nand desires to imply not only that beliefs alone cannot motivate\naction, but also that desires are not open to similar rational\ncriticism as beliefs. Therefore, Humeans conclude, preferences can\nonly be criticised if they are extrinsic – i.e.\ninstrumentally derived from other preferences on the basis of beliefs\n– or inconsistent. Such criticism of extrinsic preferences would\nseem ultimately to be a criticism of false beliefs, and it could be\nargued that it is therefore not really criticism of preferences\n(Broome 1993).  \nSeveral authors have argued for a more substantial criticism of\npreferences, including that of intrinsic ones. Some critics argue that\nsome or all preferences are in fact a kind of belief, and hence open\nto the same rational criticism as beliefs. Two defences have been\npresented to counter this challenge. First, it has been claimed that\nthat desires (standing for motivation in general) are fundamentally\ndistinct from epistemic states in their direction of fit.\nBeliefs are directed to fit the world; hence their insufficient fit\nprovides the basis for their criticism. Desires are directed to fit\nthe world to them; hence they lack this basis for criticism (Smith\n1987). Second, Humeans have argued that treating desires as beliefs is\nincompatible with Bayesian decision theory and also with other,\nnon-quantitative, decision theories (Lewis 1988, Collins 1991,\nByrne/Hajek 1997).  \nSome proponents of the criticizability of preferences have referred to\nsecond-order preferences. An addict may prefer not to prefer smoking;\na malevolent person may prefer not to prefer evil actions; an indolent\nmay prefer not to prefer to shun work; a daydreamer may prefer not to\nprefer what cannot be realised, etc. First-order preferences are\ncriticisable if they do not comply with second-order preferences. (For\naccounts of second-order preferences, see Frankfurt 1971, Sen 1977.)\nSecond-order preferences may trigger attempts to change one’s\npreferences. Methods of self-restraint, self-command and\nself-improvement have been extensively described (Schelling 1984,\nElster 1989, 2000). Already Hume described the possibility of\nrationally choosing such expedience (Grüne-Yanoff & McClennen\n2006).  \nCritics have argued against the possibility of rationally choosing\nsuch indirect preference-modifying strategies. Millgram (1998) argues\nthat knowledge of the way such desires-at-will were brought about\nmakes it impossible for them to actually function as the desires they\nare intended to be. He gives the example of a car salesman, who, in\norder to be successful in his work, makes himself prefer the various\nuseless knick-knacks that the brand he represents offers for its cars.\nWhen the salesman is laid off, the car-dealer offers him a car with\nall the useless extras that he made himself prefer. Because he\nremembers how he acquired these preferences, he chooses not to act on\nthem. So, Millgram argues, the desire-at-will was not genuine.What is\nmissing, he points out, are the backward-directed inferential\ncommitments that genuine preferences bring with them. Only if one\nforgets that one acquired a specific preference at will, or if one\nalso acquires the inferential commitments of such a preference, can\npreferring-at-will be successful.
