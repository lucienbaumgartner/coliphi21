It has practical or\n‘means-end’ limits; what lawmakers try to do may misfire\nin many ways.  More interestingly, though, does law have\nprincipled limits? The best known positive answer to this\nquestion is that given by John Stuart Mill.  Mill's ‘harm\nprinciple’ is examined in this entry, together with the more\nrecent defences of the principle by Joel Feinberg and Joseph Raz.\nOther influential proposals for principled limits to the law are also\nexamined: for example, the suggestion that law must eschew certain\nkinds of otherwise valid moral reasons and that the law must be in\nsome sense neutral.  Finding principled limits to the law, it will be\nsuggested, is an elusive task.\n\n\nI think, therefore, that it is not possible to set\ntheoretical limits to the power of the State to legislate against\nimmorality. It is not possible to settle in advance exceptions to the\ngeneral rule or to define inflexibly areas of morality into which the\nlaw is in no circumstances to be allowed to enter. \n\nLaw has limits. That is obvious. Legal officials at various times\nand in various places have objectives and they need to find the best\nway of achieving them. Some might seek to end casual street violence,\nso impose stiff legal penalties on anyone caught engaging in such\nconduct. Some might seek to end demonstrable harms caused by alcohol or\ndrugs through prohibiting their sale and consumption. Others might seek\nto meet housing needs by imposing minimum standards for accommodation\non those who rent out their properties. Though they seek the best means\nof reaching their goals, they might fail and the failure could be\ndramatic. \n\nIn all the examples mentioned above the aims sought may not\nmaterialize. The stiff legal penalties imposed by those seeking to\ncurtail street violence may lead only to an increase in violence as\nperpetrators reason they may as well be hung for a sheep as a\nlamb. The prohibition of alcohol consumption may merely drive\nconsumption underground, failing in its purpose and succeeding only in\nadding to the stock of societal harms as further criminality incident\non the prohibition grows. Property owners, rather than forking out for\nlegally mandated improvements to their rental property, may simply\ntake their properties off the market, resulting in fewer affordable\nproperties available for rental and fewer needs met. In each case the\nlaw has overreached itself. Having observed the results of their\nefforts, the legal officials may conclude that it would have been\nbetter to have used other means or maybe even to have done nothing, to\nhave tolerated the former level of harm, since their means of putting\nit to an end did not solve the problem aimed at, but exacerbated\nit. In pursuing the best result as they see it, they have achieved\nonly the third-best and now the problem might be the embarrassing one\nof getting back to second-best. \n\nThese are familiar stories in skeletal form and illustrate the\ncommonplace that the methods the law might use can simply misfire.\nThere are limits to what the law can achieve because some of its tools\nare blunt. Some tools do not work, others are counter-productive; some\nexacerbate the problem they were supposed to resolve. Knowing what\nworks and what does not and what will be counterproductive is\nimportant knowledge indeed. Again, enforcement of a desired policy may\nbe prohibitively expensive and divert resources away from still more\nimportant goals a state may wish to pursue. A state may also need to\nconsider in some contexts the psychology of its citizens. Perhaps\nthere is something in the Freudian notion of ‘pale\ncriminality’: ‘the condition of one who commits a crime\nbecause of, rather than in spite of, its forbidden status’\n(Scheffler 1992,\n pp. 70-71).[1]\n There may also be what David Lewis calls a ‘mixture\nproblem.’ Lewis had in mind in particular John Stuart Mill's\npoint that truth and error may be found combined in one package deal,\nso that there is no way of suppressing the error without suppressing\ntruth as well (Lewis 2000, p. 164). But the point can be made more\ngeneral: there may be no way for a state to suppress a greatly\nundesired activity without also disturbing a greatly desired\n activity.[2]\n The law in short is limited by the tools it has at its disposal and\nthe effects that these tools will have. We might call these\n‘means-ends limits’ or ‘practical limits’. Law\ncan coerce, it can make rules, it can adjudicate, but one can only go\nso far with these tools (Fuller 1978). Law must seek to do the best\npossible with the tools available. \n\nLaw does have limits. It has at least the means-ends or practical\nlimits that have just been discussed. But this is too uncontroversial\nto be a particularly interesting claim and it gives nothing of the\nflavour of what has made this topic such a controversial one. We turn\nto that in a moment. It is important to bear such practical limits in\nmind nevertheless, since one possible way to delineate the limits of\nthe law is that such practical limits are the only limits\nthat States must negotiate in its legislative and more broadly legal\nbehaviour, beyond the platitude that it must act in a morally\nacceptable way. In this sense the immorality of an action or value of\nthe goal to be achieved are none of them sufficient of themselves for\nstate coercion. The controversy begins when the question of\nprincipled limits is raised. Means-ends or practical limits\napply just as much to evil and unjustified regimes as they do to\nlegitimate ones, albeit in different ways. If we assume that through\nthe instruments of its law a state has or ought to have the formal aim\nof legitimate government, we should ask whether there are any\nprincipled limits to the law? Lord Devlin in the quotation at the\nstart of the essay denies that there are any such limits. As we shall\nsee, answering the challenge to articulate principled limits is a far\nfrom straightforward task. \n\nMuch of the debate has revolved around the place of moral reasoning in\njustifying state action, most commonly in justifying the use of\ncoercion. Everyone agrees that the immorality of an action is not a\nsufficient reason for state coercion since as we have seen there are\nmeans-ends limits and practical limits. But there is little more\ncommon ground. Must the state abstain from considering and acting upon\ncertain kinds of consideration in order to rise above the sectarian\nadherence or invocation of one controversial understanding of what\nmakes for a good life? I shall suggest that the central tension is\nover the recourse that a state should have to moral premises for which\ntruth is claimed. If one denies that there is anything in principle to\nrestrain a state's recourse to moral truth in the passing of the law,\nthere is the problem of disagreement. Disagreement can be widespread\nand intractable. So what should a state do in the here-and-now where\nthere is no consensus, even among reasonable people, about what ought\nto be done? Can it simply enforce what it takes, controversially, to\nbe the right solution? On the other hand if one tries to restrain in\nprinciple the State's recourse to moral argument, ruling out of\nconsideration certain kinds of argument based on moral truth, the\nchallenge is to do this on a satisfying basis that is not merely\nad hoc. \n\nFar and away the best known proposal for a principled limit to the\nlaw is the ‘harm principle’ of John Stuart Mill: \n\nMill thought that the principle was ultimately based upon\n utility[3]—in\n the ‘largest sense, grounded on the permanent interests of man\nas a progressive being.’ (Mill 1993, p. 79; Gray 1996, p. 6). He\ndid not think the principle applied to persons living in communities\nthat had not yet progressed to the point of ‘civilisation’\n(Mill 1993, p.79). In communities in which there had been sufficient\nprogress towards civilisation, it is of great importance to protect\nand promote liberty of action for all. States in general should\nacknowledge the importance of such liberty of action and should limit\ntheir law accordingly. Interference with liberty of action, especially\nby the use of power or coercion, required a special sort of\njustification: that it was needed to prevent harm to\nothers. To coerce on the basis that one wishes to avoid harm to others\nis of course to coerce on a moral ground. Mill thought that no other\nmoral ground would be good enough. \n\nThis view has been highly influential. There does indeed seem on the\nface of it to be something special about harm. The point of describing\nan outcome as harmful, it has been thought by many, is to say that\n‘it is deleterious from the point of view of a very wide range\nof conceptions of the good’ (Barry 1995, pp. 87-88; Scanlon\n1975, pp. 655-659). For Mill, harm is uniquely powerful and to many\nsubsequent proponents of ‘the harm principle,’ as we shall\nsee, it has been considered especially powerful if not quite unique.\nHarm to others, for Mill, is to be contrasted with\noffence to others, with harm to the person to be coerced\nherself, who normally consents to the harm, and with the\nbare (harmless) immorality of the conduct she would\notherwise seek to engage in. Mill had in mind in particular the\nsecurity interests and autonomy interests of persons. The State may\nlegitimately stop A from beating up B, even though this limits his\nfreedom of action, because this prevents harm to B, it protects his\ninterest in security. And it may stop A from stealing from B, as it\nprotects inter alia B's freedom to dispose of his property as\nhe wishes. But the State oversteps its proper limits on this view if\nit purports to stop A smashing up his own property; or to protect C\nfrom the offence she will take knowing that A is doing this. \n\nIn more recent times Joel Feinberg has sought to vindicate a broadly\nMillian understanding of the limits of the law. He proposes a\ndifferent version of the harm principle, thus: \n\nIn comparison with Mill's principle this seems rather weak.  Harm to\nothers, Mill booms, is the ‘only purpose’ that\ncould license State coercion; while Feinberg's formulation claims more\ngently that it gives the State ‘a good reason’ to\ncoerce. His claim that harm to others merely furnishes ‘a good\nreason’ allows him to invoke another ‘good reason’\nfor state coercion—‘the offence principle.’ \n\nDespite the fact that Mill claimed his Harm Principle was ‘one\nvery simple principle’ which excludes offence from its purview,\nFeinberg in fact thinks there is support to be found for his own\n‘Offense Principle’ in Mill's text, though, whether or not\nthat is true, his deeper claim is that his principle is worthy of\nsupport. So if ‘harm to others’ and ‘offence to\nothers’ can each constitute ‘a good reason’ for\nstate coercion, how many more ‘good reasons’ are there, in\nFeinberg's view, for state coercion? He proposes a broad answer over\nthe course of his four volume study of the limits of the law, albeit\nwith some trepidation: it is, quite simply, none—there are no\nother good reasons for State coercion. The ‘liberal\nposition’ he suggests demands of the State that it should\nrecognize as legitimate only the two grounds for coercion just\nmentioned. If there is no harm to others and no offence to others to\ncounter, there must be no coercion. Many other ‘good\nreasons’ have been proposed for state coercion, he acknowledges,\nbut though they are reasons for coercion, they are not good enough or\nlegitimate reasons. In this way Feinberg professes his fidelity to the\nanimating spirit of Mill's On Liberty. \n\nFeinberg to some extent echoes Mill in his understanding of harm in\nrelation to the ‘interests’ of persons. He does not, to be\nsure, adopt Mill's emphasis on ‘the permanent interests of man\nas a progressive being.’ He understands a harmed\ncondition as one in which there is a ‘set-back to\ninterests;’ and there is a good reason for coercion if the\nset-back is wrongful, not simply a setback of the order of\nlosing a professional tennis competition or being driven out of\nbusiness by a rival's superior product. The two sorts of reason that\nFeinberg is keenest to exclude, on the other hand, are ‘Legal\nPaternalism’ and ‘Legal Moralism’. The former he\ndescribes thus: \n\nImportant as ‘Legal Paternalism’ is to the question of the\nlimits of the law, I shall say very little about it as it has an entry\nof its own elsewhere in this Encyclopaedia (G Dworkin, 2002).  Suffice\nit to say here that Feinberg is not equally hostile to all forms of\nlegal paternalism. He distinguishes ‘soft paternalism’\nfrom ‘hard paternalism’. In many cases the forcible\nimplementation of a person's will can accord with his personal\nautonomy. Feinberg describes such cases as involving ‘soft\npaternalism’ and contrasts them with those involving ‘hard\npaternalism’ (Feinberg 1986, p. 26). It is the\n‘hard’ variety that Feinberg sets himself against, the\nforcible coercion of a person against her will for her own good. This\nhe rules out on grounds of legitimacy. In fact he does not believe\nthat ‘soft’ paternalism is really paternalism at all,\nproperly called and so stops short of adding it to his list of\npotentially legitimating reasons for legal coercion. \n\nFeinberg is as keen to deny the legitimacy of ‘Legal\nMoralism’ as a legitimating ground as he is (hard)\npaternalism. \n\nIn the next section we will be centrally concerned with this as a\nrival to the Harm Principle. \n\nThe introduction of ‘Offence’ and certain kinds of\npaternalism as potentially legitimating grounds, makes it a little\nmisleading to speak of the ‘Harm Principle’ as one\nprinciple shared by all the leading thinkers associated with the\nprinciple. I shall continue to do so merely as shorthand. The table\nbelow illustrates some divergence in the views of the leading thinkers\nassociated with the Harm Principle as to the proper limits of the legal\ncoercion. No one of them has an account with exactly the same\nconclusions as any of the others. \n\nI will later come to another strand of thinking about the limits of\nthe law: that the law must remain neutral between different\nunderstandings of the nature of the good. It must coerce, when it\ncoerces, neutrally between such understandings. \n\nH.L.A Hart began his essay entitled ‘Social Solidarity and the\nEnforcement of Morality’ in this way: \n\nHaving gone to the trouble to state the thesis in question—that\nthe State should see to it that people live good lives—and to\ncite two heavyweights in its support, Hart's final sentence comes as\nsomething of a surprise. He took the view, it would seem, that there\nwas little to be said for a view of morality according to which it\nawaited discovery by reason or disclosure through revelation. So much\nso that it was not worthy of serious discussion. It is contrasted with\n‘man-made’ morality which Hart does consider worth\ndiscussing in the present context. \n\nThe reason-based, revelation-based and the man-made versions of the\nview all tend to arouse suspicion. The moralist has been branded a\nkill-joy and, more darkly, an inquisitor. Shakespeare's Sir Toby Belch\nmakes the first sort of complaint: ‘Dost thou think that because\nthou art virtuous there shall be no more cakes and ale?’\n(Twelfth Night Act II, Scene III). Harmless activities which\ngive pleasure or are otherwise valued by some are thought fair game by\nthe moralist because immoral or vice-ridden. Arthur Miller's image of\nthe crucible is an apt characterisation of the second sort of\nsuspicion: a crucible is ‘a vessel in which metals are heated to\nextreme temperatures, melted down, and purified’ (Miller 1952,\nSinger and Singer 2005, p. 568). The moralist, on this view, is the\ninquisitor apt to see those who fail to conform to the ‘right\nideas’ as impure and prepared to go to great lengths—to\nheat to extreme temperatures—in order to ‘purify’\nsuch persons. \n\nThe specific version of Legal Moralism that Hart was opposing was that\nof Lord Devlin. Lord Devlin, at the time an English High Court judge,\nwas reacting to a government report recommending the legalisation of\nhomosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private. The report,\nknown as the ‘Wolfendon Report’, concluded that there\n‘must remain a realm of private morality and immorality which\nis, in brief and crude terms, not the law's business’\n(‘Wolfendon Report’ 1957, para 61).  Devlin's main point\nwas to argue that this specific theoretical conclusion did not stand\nup. Mill of course believed that harmless behaviour was not the law's\nbusiness, whether or not it could be styled immoral, and Hart's\npurpose in challenging Devlin was to reassert a modified version of\nMill's view. \n\nMill's canonical formulation of his Harm Principle begins as we have\nseen with the following words: ‘the sole end for which mankind\nare warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the\nliberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.’\nDevlin, while of course implacably opposed to how Mill was to continue\nthe passage, seems to agree. ‘Self protection,’ for him,\nstretches to the idea of self-protection on the part of the state. In\nDevlin's view a society is in part constituted by its morality and it\ntherefore has a right to defend itself against any attack on that\nmorality. \n\nA society needs its morality as it needs a government and it is\ntherefore, for the sake of self protection, entitled to ‘use the\nlaw to preserve morality in the same way as it uses it to safeguard\nanything else that is essential to its existence’ (Devlin 1965,\np. 11). For Devlin, then, to say, as the Wolfendon Committee does,\nthat there is an area of the morality and immorality that is not the\nlaw's business is not just ‘crude’ and\n‘brief’; it is downright mistaken. The law must do what it\nhas to do to exact the price of society, which is the protection of\nthe morality of that society. \n\nIt was said earlier that Devlin's moralism is in Hart's terms of the\n‘man-made’ variety. He believed that the invisible bonds\nof common thought in a given society are not the same in different\nsocieties. Some societies abhor polygamy for example and others find\nit a worthy form of social organisation. In different ways both\nmonogamy and polygamy can partly constitute the invisible bonds of\ncommon thought in different societies. For Devlin, it follows that in\none society the law can be used to enforce monogamy against polygamy\nand in the other it can be used to enforce polygamy against monogamy,\nshould the latter threaten the former in either case.  In\nindustrialized societies, Devlin tells us, it is generally true that\nmonogamy ‘is built into the house in which we live and could not\nbe removed without bringing it down’ (Devlin, 1965, p. 10). But\nthis is merely a contingent truth and if our houses were built\ndifferently the content of the law to be enforced could legitimately\nbe the opposite of what it is. Morality is, for Devlin,\nconventional. \n\nThe relevant sense of morality for Devlin is relative. One is to\nconsider the views of the ordinary person living in that society to\ndetermine the content of the morality; in Devlin's English terms, it\nis ‘the juryman’ whose views one should ask for, or the\n‘man on the Clapham omnibus’. In enforcing the criminal\nlaw ‘there must be toleration of the maximum individual freedom\nthat is consistent with the integrity of society.’ (Devlin 1965,\np. 16). Devlin famously says that the limits of toleration are reached\nnot simply when a majority dislikes a practice; ‘no society, he\nsays, ‘can do without intolerance, indignation and disgust, they\nare the forces behind the moral law, and indeed it can be argued that\nif they or something like them are not present, the feelings of\nsociety cannot be weighty enough to deprive the individual of freedom\nof choice.’ (Devlin 1965, p. 17). In the late 1950s in English\nsociety, it was at least arguable in Devlin's view that there was\nenough intolerance, indignation and disgust to justify the criminal\nlaw prohibition against homosexual behaviour between consenting\nadults. \n\nThere is nothing to be said in favour of Devlin's construal of\nhomosexuality as ‘addictive’ or a ‘miserable way of\nlife’ (Devlin 1965, p. v), but he himself does not rest much\ntheoretical weight on this construal himself: what matters to him\ntheoretically appears to be the beliefs of a population, backed up by\nthe emotion of disgust and a degree of cool reflection. Presumably, if\nalive today, Devlin would argue on the same premises for the\nillegitimacy of the criminalisation of homosexual behaviour\nbetween consenting adults. In English society today none of the\nmainstream political parties takes the view of homosexuality Devlin\nthought widespread in the 1950s, or, more pertinently in Devlinite\nterms, believes that there are votes to be gained from advocating such\na view. \n\nBut it is this very aspect of his thought which makes his view\nuntenable. Bernard Williams has shown that the tempting line of\nthought of the sort adopted by Devlin is often underlain by an\nunstable amalgam of relative and non-relative views. \n\nBut the conclusion does not follow. It may be true that if certain\nsteps are not taken, the society will disintegrate. Apartheid in South\nAfrica disintegrated. What if by a more sustained enforcement of its\ncentral racist elements it had managed to persist longer? Would this\ncontinued existence be underwritten by a moral right? Does anyone now\nowe the society the duty to restore the system or did such a duty lie\nfor a period after its disintegration? The suggestions are absurd. The\npoint of course is that some societies are so lacking in legitimacy\nthat it may be emphatically for the best that they\ndisintegrate. Devlin is in error when he says ‘What is important\nis not the quality of the creed but the strength of the belief in\nit. (Devlin 1965, p.  114)’ \n\nAccording to Ronald Dworkin what is wrong with the Devlin thesis is\nthat it misidentifies what a moral argument is. We do not argue\nmorally, he says, when we prejudge, when we parrot, when we\nrationalize and when we merely emote. Certainly one will occasionally\noverhear exchanges with genuine moral content, some of them robust, if\none takes Devlin's advice and catches the Clapham omnibus, but one\nwill also get served up as much prejudgment, as many rationalizations\nand parrotings, and as much mere emotion. Devlin gives us nothing to\nhelp us discriminate: it all counts equally for him. Not everybody\naccepts in turn Dworkin's claim that emotional responses cannot be\nmoral responses; but Devlin has nevertheless picked on an\nemotion—disgust—that is particularly susceptible to\ndistortion (cf. Nussbaum 2004). It is clear that in arguing for\n‘the enforcement of morality’ Devlin has not focussed on\nmoral argument at all. \n\nDevlin's account unacceptably implies that a corrupt and immoral\nsociety has as much right to perpetuate itself as a decent society,\nprovided it is able to integrate the society. He also as we have just\nseen operates with an unsatisfactory understanding of what morality\nis. This leaves the possibility of another account of legal moralism\nthat does not make these errors and sees morality aright as\nreason-based, but which also holds to Devlin's claim quoted right at\nthe beginning of the paper that ‘there is no area of morality\ninto which the law is under no circumstances allowed to\nenter.’ His own account fails to give any clear route, but his\nchallenge to those who propose the harm principle and similar\nlimitation principles is to show an adequate basis for insulating\ncertain domains of morality from the state in the passing of its\nlaw. \n\nThe most influential recent defence of the ‘harm\nprinciple’—from a theorist with a reason-sensitive account\nof morality—is that of Joseph Raz (Raz,\n 1986).[5]\n I shall come in a moment to Raz's proposed basis for the harm\nprinciple. But first a word about Mill's original grounding of the\nprinciple. Mill declared utility to be the ultimate appeal on all\nethical questions. But given some other things that Mill says about\nit, it is initially puzzling why he should think that utility gives\nany support to the harm principle.  For he also held of the principle\nof utility that ‘actions are right in proportion as they tend to\npromote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of\nhappiness’(Mill 1993 p.7). This last formulation seems to\ncounsel states to keep their options open in their\nlawmaking. ‘Do what you can to reverse unhappiness,’ the\nadvice seems to be, ‘and do what you can to promote\nhappiness.’ ‘Coerce to prevent harm to others if that will\nreverse unhappiness; coerce for some other end if that will equally do\nthe trick.’ But as we have just seen, coercion to prevent\nharmless wrongdoing is ruled out by Mill, irrespective of whether such\nan action is the State's best bet for reversing unhappiness.  Never\nmind if that harmless wrong makes everyone miserable; never mind if\ncoercing those who perpetuate it would take away the misery: the State\nmust not coerce and the misery must remain. Has confusion here wrought\nMill's masterpiece? \n\nNot on certain accounts. For all this tension points to is the need\nfor more care in stating the correct basis of Mill's\nutilitarianism. John Gray argues, with great subtlety that cannot be\nreproduced here, that what is needed is a form of indirect\nutilitarianism or indirect consequentialism (Gray 1996). Acting always\nto promote happiness can be self-defeating and although Mill does say,\nas we have seen, ‘actions are right in proportion as\nthey tend to promote happiness,’ this remark cannot be taken\nliterally, according to Gray, when read with the remainder of the\nMillian corpus. What Mill recommends, in Gray's interpretation, is\nthat the successful maximization of happiness must proceed with a ban\nin certain contexts on its direct pursuit: in particular the state\nmust respect the harm principle instead of appealing directly to the\nprinciple of utility (Gray 1996 p. 136). That way happiness, which in\nsubstance turns out to require a considerable measure of liberty for\npersons, will be maximized the better. Gray himself, however, in the\nsecond edition of his book, comes to the conclusion that the\nreconciliation cannot succeed. He gives many arguments. One of them\nclaims that the proposed reconciliation cannot give liberty strong\nenough priority: \n\nIn general and in a variety of ways, the principle of liberty sailing\nunder the protection of the harm principle and the principle of\nutility end up after all at war with one another, and Utility simply\ncannot be guaranteed to underwrite as strong a principle of liberty as\nthe harm principle. \n\nRaz does not follow Mill's utilitarian path to the defence of the harm\nprinciple. Adopting a value-pluralist notion of morality, he argues in\nshort that even though: \n\nOn this argument even if the seemingly very strong concession in (1)\nis made to the legal moralist, the issue is very far from concluded.\nFor principled limits can be generated out of the means that the law\nproposes to achieve its aims. (2), not (1), leads Raz to endorse the\nHarm Principle. At first sight it seems strange that a proponent of\nthe claim in (1) can also be a proponent of the harm principle. For is\nnot the principle precisely aimed at imposing principled\nlimits on the law, ruling out justifications based on the goodness or\nworthiness of options? How can this be reconciled with the claim that\nthere are no principled limits to the pursuit of moral goals\non the part of the state? \n\nBefore addressing this, a few more words are in order about the deep\nstructure of Raz's ‘perfectionism.’ To reiterate as far as\n(1) is concerned, Raz's view of morality is light years from that of\nLord Devlin: it is emphatically reason-based. There is no hint of\nDevlin's idea that morality is constituted simply by the moral\nbeliefs, feelings of disgust etc of a given society. Morality is\nreason-based, but Raz's concern is limited to states with\n‘autonomy-respecting cultures’ and with what it is to live\na good life in such societies. The key, as the phrase\n‘autonomy-respecting culture’ would suggest, is autonomy.\nIt is a state's primary duty in the relevant kind of society to\npromote, protect and foster the autonomy of all citizens. This\nrequires furnishing all with an ‘adequate range of valuable\noptions.’ But the qualification ‘valuable’ is of\nfundamental importance to the account. The state need not lift a\nfinger in defence of worthless options; it has no duty of, say,\nneutrality to keep itself above the fray between the options that\npeople desire to pursue. Raz is clear, moreover, that the autonomy\nprinciple ‘permits and even requires governments to create\nmorally valuable opportunities, and to eliminate repugnant\nones’ (Raz 1986, p. 417). \n\nThis account, to my mind, is highly plausible. But in the light of it,\nhow does the harm principle get a look in? Why should coercion not be\nused to eliminate repugnant options? There are certainly bound to be\nwhat we earlier called ‘means-ends’ or\n‘practical’ problems in using coercion to eliminate a\nrepugnant option. The use of coercion may be prohibitively expensive,\nfor example, denting seriously the resources a state might otherwise\nuse to promote other valuable options. There is likely to be a\nformidable ‘mixture’ problem: eliminating what is\nworthless by coercive means may increase the chance that what is of\ngenuine value will be dragged down along with it. Repugnant options\nare unlikely to subsist in society entirely isolated from other\noptions that are not worthless. But let us imagine that this has all\nbeen taken into account and whatever price has to be paid is not\nadjudged excessively high. Is there an argument to show why a state\nmay still not use coercion to suppress the worthless option that goes\nbeyond arguments from ‘practical’ or\n‘means-ends’ limits? Let us look in detail at Raz's\nargument. His central claim is that the harm principle is defensible\non the basis of the principle of autonomy for one simple reason:\n‘the means used, coercive interference, violates the autonomy of\nthe victim.’ He explains: \n\nBoth of these points require some attention. I will begin with the\nsecond point for this way around the first point will emerge more\nclearly. Is, then, the use of coercion a ‘global and\nindiscriminate invasion of autonomy? There is no doubt whatsoever that\nsometimes it is. ‘Depriving a person of opportunities or of the\nability to use them is’, as Raz says, ‘a way of causing\nhim harm.’ Again ‘frustrating [a person's] pursuit of\nprojects and relationships he has set upon’ can cause harm (Raz\n1986, p. 413). The most common context for the invocation of the harm\nprinciple is the criminal law. Much behaviour that is criminalized is\ndone under the threat of imprisonment and imprisonment can cut off a\nvery large range of options; or it can reduce them\nconsiderably by various forms of disruption or destruction: of family\nlife, deep personal relations, work opportunities, pursuit of valuable\noutdoor activities, political participation and so on. \n\nThis is correct and important to stress. However, it is also clear\nthere are many more forms of coercion in regular use to back up\ncriminal proscriptions than simple imprisonment: fines, community\nservice orders and electronic tagging orders are three examples. Even\nif one restricts oneself to the criminal law, there are many methods\nshort of imprisonment which can affect options, but which may not\nleave the convicted criminal short of an adequate range of\nvaluable options. The methods may well be to varying degrees coercive,\nbut the assault on autonomy will not in most be total or\nnear-total. \n\nTake the last mentioned example of the previous paragraph: the\nmandatory wearing of electronic tagging devices. Jermaine Pennant, an\nEngland Under-21 soccer international, was included in Birmingham's\nstarting line-up to face Spurs in a game in the top division of the\nEnglish football league: the stuff that most English lads' dreams are\nmade of! Only while Pennant was playing he was in the process of\nserving a sentence following his conviction for a drink-driving\noffence. Part of his sentence required him to wear an electronic\ntag. The referee decided the tagging device was safe so long as it was\nsuitably padded under his sock. ‘He just wants to get on with\nhis life again and go out and play football’ his manager Steve\nBruce announced. By all appearances he was doing an excellent job of\nit, notwithstanding the cloud he was under. As he was running around\nthe pitch, we clearly would not say that he had an inadequate range of\nvaluable options, while he was at the same time serving out a criminal\n sentence.[6] \n\nSimilarly, fining is an extremely common form of criminal penalty.\nRobert Adams in developing a view of the limits of the law stressing,\nlike Raz, the evils of coercion cites the following case: \n\nI believe it would be wrong to subject the possession and use of\ntobacco (where it does not foul the air for others) to serious\ncriminal penalties, because of the evils of coercion and\npunishment. Other governmental action to discourage smoking or make it\nmore difficult, without coercion, perhaps by raising taxes on tobacco\nproducts, seems entirely appropriate’ (Adams 1999, p. 327). \n\nA number of arguments could be made in support of Adams' view\nfor the specific conclusion that one should not criminalize the\npossession of tobacco by those who choose to smoke it, despite the\ndemonstrable harm to which smoking leads. But the threat to the\nadequacy of such a person's valuable options seems not to be one of\nthem. Imagine a state that taxes smoking heavily—an entirely\nappropriate course of action in Adams' view that discourages\nsomething of little value without a heavy coercive bludgeon. Imagine\nnext that it changes tack and criminalizes possession and use of\ntobacco. It will therefore stop taxing tobacco. One could also\nimagine, finally, that the fines imposed add up to much less money to\nbe paid per annum, even by the most recalcitrant of offenders, than\nwas paid formerly by anyone in taxes. The stigma attaching to such a\ncrime is unlikely to be much higher than for a parking offence, so\nagain the conclusion seems to be that much can be criminalized without\nany serious assault on the adequacy of a person's options. In fact\nsometimes criminal penalties might affect options less than taxation\n(cf. Alexander 2003). \n\nPerhaps what this shows is that one of the key functions of the harm\nprinciple needs to be restricted in scope. Perhaps it should be\nthought of in this context not as a principle of criminalization or\neven of fixing the law's limits in general, but as a principle\ngoverning the appropriate use of\n imprisonment?[7]\n Such a principle could be coupled with a principle of precaution in\nrelation to the less coercive sanctions mentioned above, which would\nrequire serious scrutiny in the use of these sanctions precisely due\nto the presence to some extent of coercion in them. This would,\nhowever, be to cut down severely the job description of the sort of\nlimitation principle that has been sought by means of the harm\nprinciple. Not only would it no longer be a general principle limiting\nthe scope of the law; it would be dramatically curtailed in relation\nto the criminal law as well. \n\nBut such a conclusion would be premature. Raz is well aware that\ncoercion will not always impinge seriously on a person's\nautonomy. This is where his other argument comes in, based on the\ncondition of independence. We should now consider whether this\nargument can make up the slack. We have already stated that for Raz\nautonomy is to be understood as an adequate range of valuable\noptions. That one has such a range of options is not yet sufficient,\nin his view, to establish that one is autonomous: one must also\nsatisfy the condition of independence. This is best explained with the\nconceivable, if practically unlikely, possibility of the willing\nslave: a slave who engages in valuable activity and would choose to do\nwhatever he actually does under the command of the slave-owner, even\nif not so commanded. Such a person is not independent and so is not\nautonomous, irrespective of the adequacy of his valuable options. \n\nCoercion, the second argument runs, violates the condition of\nindependence and expresses a relation of domination and an attitude of\ndisrespect for the coerced individual. I will suggest that the claim\nturns on an argument about social meanings and the argument may be\ndifficult to contain in a way that would be necessary to support the\nharm principle. In detail the argument is this: \n\nFor present purposes the essential steps of the argument seem to be\nthese: \n\nNot all coercion is a global assault on autonomy—it is\ntrue—but there is ample support for a principled limit to the\nlaw based on coercion, because a social convention takes up the slack\nin cases in which coercion is not a serious threat to autonomy. This,\nthen, is the argument. Less serious forms of coercion disrespect\npersons and express contempt for them. Presumably, to return to the\ncriminalization of smoking example, it would not be enough, on this\nargument, to point to the fact that there may be no diminution in the\nadequacy of valuable options available to the smoker if the conclusion\nis to be that criminal fines should legitimately be imposed.\nCriminalizing the smoking would express disrespect or contempt for the\nsmoker, not because his options are in fact left inadequate, but\nbecause a convention has formed giving coercion this sort of\n meaning.[8] \n\nOne worry with this argument is that it may be difficult to determine\nwhat the authority of such a convention would be, especially as it may\nnot prove easy to determine the difference in a given case between an\nexception to the convention and an application of it. In a given\ncontext, the question that needs to be answered is: are we confronted\nwith a case in which the meaning of the convention condemns a token\naction that does not contain the original consequence that\ngave meaning to the convention, viz. the reduction of the adequacy of\nvaluable options, or simply with an exception to the convention.\nAnother problem, on which I will focus more, is what I will call the\nproblem of discrimination. If there exist such conventions based on\nnatural facts that invest acts of coercion with such meaning, what\nwill guarantee that such conventions only countenance coercion when\nused against harmful behaviour, not when used against\n(harmless) immoral or worthless behaviour? Can the\ncoercion-based account be discriminating enough to do the job for\nwhich it is intended? After considering whether the convention-based\nargument just sketched can deal satisfactorily with the discrimination\nproblem, I go on to consider whether a different argument, which I\nwill call ‘the asymmetry’ argument, can also help to\ndeflect the discrimination problem away from the perfectionist defence\nof the harm principle. \n\nTo explore the first, convention-based argument, let us consider a\nthesis of Meir Dan-Cohen's, with a similar structure to that of Raz,\nbut with a very different, indeed inconsistent, conclusion.\nDan-Cohen's focus is on the criminal law rather than the law in\ngeneral, but his concern is to argue for a replacement of the harm\nprinciple with the dignity principle. The main goal of the\ncriminal law, he proposes, ‘is to defend the unique moral worth\nof every human being’ (Dan-Cohen 2002, p. 150). Dignity demands\n‘that our actions, practices, and institutions convey an\nattitude of respect to people.’ (Dan-Cohen 2002, p. 161). He\nalso alludes to the ‘happy slave’ thought-experiment,\narguing that it makes compelling a strong notion of dignity that is\nindependent of autonomy and welfare and prior to\nboth. ‘If,’ he argues, ‘two people can enjoy in fact\nthe same level of welfare and exercise the same degree of choice, yet\none of them be a slave while the other is not,’ the evil of\nslavery must ultimately not lie in the ideas of autonomy or welfare\n(Dan-Cohen 2002, pp. 156-157).  Slavery is evil even in such a case\nbecause of its violation of dignity. The lesson of the happy slave\nhypothetical for Raz is that independence is part and parcel of\nautonomy; for Dan-Cohen its lesson is different: it points to a\ndignity principle altogether independent of autonomy. \n\nAfter citing with approval the Kantian imperative that persons must be\ntreated as ends and not merely as means, Dan-Cohen continues: \n\nThe argument has a similar structure to Raz's second argument\nabove. Slavery tends to inflict suffering, harm and\ndisregard’ and this fact has become the basis of a social\nconvention which loads slavery with symbolic meaning expressing\nindignity, even (sometimes) where there is no suffering, harm\nor disregard. As Dan-Cohen summarizes his point: ‘Once an\naction-type has acquired a symbolic significance by virtue of the\ndisrespect it typically displays, its tokens will possess that\nsignificance and communicate the same content even if the reason does\nnot apply to them.’ (Dan-Cohen 2002, p. 162). \n\nIn State v Brown for example, the assumed facts were that the\ndefendant beat his wife when she drank alcohol, doing so at her prior\nrequest, as she thought this would be the most effective way to cure\nher severe alcoholism. The defendant was convicted of an assault\noffence and rightly so, suggests Dan-Cohen. But the (assumed) justice\nof the conviction can be explained satisfactorily neither by recourse\nto the principle of autonomy (as the victim consented to the\nbeatings), nor to the principle of welfare (if this really was the\nbest way to end the blight that alcoholism had become on Mrs Brown's\nlife it would arguably enhance her welfare). There is legitimate\ncoercion here, Dan-Cohen argues; the harm principle cannot explain\nwhy, and so much the worse for the harm principle. \n\nRaz and Dan-Cohen's arguments are similar in structure. If they are\ncombined we can claim that coercion, violence and slavery are very\ncommonly associated with severe setbacks to the autonomy and welfare\nof persons, but not invariably so. Where they are not, their\ncondemnation is still secure on the basis of the conventional\nunderstanding of the nature of those ideas. Perhaps neither argument\nis correct—as we have already mentioned, it may not be clear how\nsuch conventions gain moral authority for one thing. Or perhaps\nDan-Cohen's argument is wrong and Raz's is correct: their similarity,\nperhaps, more apparent than real. The matter cannot be settled\nhere. But on the face of it, if there is plausibility in both\narguments, then the law may legitimately coerce to prevent harm\nand it may legitimately coerce to prevent, in some cases,\n(harmless) indignity. If so, the perfectionist argument does not\nsucceed in restricting the limits of the law to harm-based\nconsiderations. \n\nWhat, then, of the second way of negotiating the discrimination\nproblem, of explaining why the evil of coercion itself rules out\ncoercion on the basis of (harmless) immoralities, but not on the basis\nof harm? According to the asymmetry argument: coercing to prevent harm\nleads to autonomy-gain, coercing to prevent (harmless) immorality\nleads to autonomy-loss; and that explains why legal coercion should be\nlimited by harm-based considerations. It is for the sake of\nautonomy. \n\nThe argument depends on a particular understanding of harm as\nautonomy. One often voiced complaint against the harm principle is\nthat the idea of harm is something of a black box into which anything\none objects to could potentially be placed. Seeing harm in terms of\nautonomy, as Raz does, gives the idea content and does so on the basis\nof an obviously highly significant moral concept. The argument is\nthis.  Coercing persons out of harmful behaviour,\nviz. autonomy-damaging, is at least for the sake of autonomy in the\nend. But coercing persons out of behaviour that is (harmlessly)\nworthless gives one no autonomy-gain.  There is no autonomy-loss to be\nsure, in doing away with worthless behaviour, but that is not the\npoint: one must factor in the autonomy-loss involved in the coercion\nitself. So coercing against harmful behaviour, if done properly,\nleaves one with an autonomy-gain on balance. But coercing against\n(harmless) immorality gives one an autonomy-loss, due to the coercion\nitself, which puts the account in debit, with no positive gain in\nautonomy to counterbalance the loss.  Unlike coercion against harmful\nbehaviour, autonomy simply loses. In Raz's words: \n\nBut is there such an asymmetry? It might be true that ‘the\navailability of repugnant options, and even their free pursuit by\nindividuals, does not detract from their autonomy,’ but this is\nlargely an empirical matter. Prior to looking and seeing it is not\nclear that this is so. Could it not be that the availability of some\nrepugnant options does detract from the autonomy of some\npeople? The image of the tree surgeon comes to mind. Some branches are\nlopped off by the tree surgeon for the health of the tree. Taking off\na branch gives the tree a better chance to flourish. Could there not\nbe some worthless options in society that are like one of the branches\non the tree? If one assumes for the sake of argument that gambling for\nnon-trivial amounts is a worthless option and that some who pursue\nthis option will do so to the detriment of what is valuable and what\nthey care about most, their families, jobs and long-term\nhobbies. Might it not be that the existence of the option detracts\nfrom the chances of many to achieve success in these valuable\npursuits? I actually suspect, to be sure, that any attempt to coerce\ngambling along these lines would have many negative side-effects and\nfor this reason should not be pursued in practice, but this would\nlargely be due to practical and means-ends limits rather than any\nmatter of principle. Serious gambling probably does get in the way of\nvaluable options of many and does not enhance the value of the life of\nanyone. Perhaps this judgement is wrong. But it would in any case be a\nsurprising empirical result to discover that autonomy could never be\nenhanced by the societal equivalent of tree surgery in this case or in\nany other. It is not implausible to think that the availability of\nsome repugnant options just makes the autonomous life\n harder.[9]\n If this is the case, the asymmetry argument seems not to\nwork. Perhaps coercion to prevent harmless immorality may lead to an\nautonomy gain, just as it does, all going correctly, when the aim is\nto prevent harm. \n\nRaz's account I think succeeds in establishing the very great\nsignificance of autonomy in political morality. As far as the limits\nof the law is concerned, it establishes that very great caution is in\norder in the use of imprisonment, given what this can do to the\nadequacy of the prisoner's valuable options. Caution, too is important\nover lesser degrees of coercion. It does not, however, seem able to\nsupport the harm principle for the coercion based considerations do\nnot neatly settle only on harm-based considerations. \n\nThe perfectionist, as we have seen, denies there is anything in the\nnature of morality itself that should impose principled limits on the\nlaw's pursuit of moral goals: such limits are thought rather to get in\nvia the back door, through reflection on the nature of coercion.  It\nwas the purpose of the last section to examine the latter view.  Many,\nhowever, challenge the former view and assert there is something in\nthe nature of human morality itself that should lead us to conclude\nthat principled limits to the law do exist. Most notably, it is said,\nthe fact of persistent moral disagreement should push us in this\ndirection. As Rawls has argued, it is not reasonable to think that\nmoral disagreement will disappear in the medium- or even the\nlong-term.  And much of this disagreement cannot simply be blamed on\nthe bloody-mindedness of some or on those biased in favour of\nthemselves, their families or groups. If it could, perhaps their views\nmight be safely ignored. Some of the disagreement is based, rather, on\ndifferences over what evidence is appropriate, how much weight should\nbe given to the evidence where it can be agreed upon, how priorities\nand choices should be made among the vast range of possible values and\nso on. Rawls describes factors such as these as ‘the burdens of\njudgment’ (Rawls 1993, 56-57). This sort of disagreement is not\nunreasonable and perhaps morality itself may mandate a self-denying\nordinance against coercing persons out of their (possibly mistaken)\nreasonable views. \n\nEarlier another strand of thinking about the limits of the law, that\nthe law must remain neutral between different understandings of the\nnature of the good, was briefly noted. The state, according to this\nview, may coerce only if it does so neutrally between such\nunderstandings. The broad intuition is that the right is prior to the\ngood. The state need not be neutral as between matters of the right,\non the one hand, and the good, on the other, between murderers and\ncharity workers (Mulhall and Swift 1996, pp. 29-30). It must be\nneutral between different views of what makes life good or worthwhile,\nbetween, say, charity workers and opera lovers. \n\nIn general the kind of neutrality most often supported by the\nproponents of this view is neutrality of justification,\nrather than neutrality of effect. Neutrality of justification\nimplies that the justification for laws must not involve reference to\njudgements about the relative merits of those different ways of life\n(Mulhall and Swift 1996, p. 30). For example, imagine one group who\nlove the outdoors and another who love television. Assume the\nestablishment of national parks would make the outdoor life easier to\nenjoy and a life of television watching more difficult, since the\nbeautiful trees would mess up the broadcasts. According to neutrality\nof effect, the state must not establish the parks unless it can find a\nway of improving the broadcasts to the appropriate degree as well. To\nhelp the hearty outdoor types, the neutrality-of-effect lawmaker must\nhelp the couch potatoes too. According to neutrality of justification,\non the other hand, it would not matter in itself that television\nwatching would get less enjoyable. Provided the justification for this\nis not to favour the outdoor enthusiasts or shake up the lazy\ntelevision watchers a bit, but is instead, say, to provide for clean\nair, it would be perfectly legitimate. Setting up the national parks\nis no violation of the principles held dear by the\nneutrality-of-justification lawmaker (Brighouse 2000, p. 7). This can\nmake state support for high art such as opera difficult to justify, a\nproblem not faced by the perfectionist (Dworkin 1985; Mulhall and\nSwift 1996, pp. 302-308). \n\nIn Thomas Nagel's view a state's law has to do better than just tell\nthose with certain conceptions of the good that they are mistaken;\nsomething more must be offered them relating, he argues, to the point\nof view of such persons. According to him we must support: \n\nThis argument is slightly different from the argument of neutrality,\nthough they are close\n cousins.[10]\n If we assume: \n\nNevertheless: \n\nThere can in Nagel's view be values that, while true or valid, are\ninadmissible from the point of view of the coercee. He has produced a\nnumber of arguments for this position (Nagel\n 1987)[11].\n Recently he has stressed the Kantian imperative against treating\npeople as a means only (Nagel 1991). Can a principled limit to the law\nemerge from such considerations? \n\nIt has been pointed out many times by Kantians that treating someone\nas a means only is not the same as treating someone as a means. One\ncan take a taxi even though that involves treating the taxi-driver as\na means to one's ends, but the driver must not be treated as a\nmeans only. However: \n\nNagel is not here appealing in any straightforward way to the consent\nof the coercee. For one cannot simply allow that the withholding by\nsomeone of their actual consent should block legal enforcement, no\nmatter what the basis of the view is in reason. On his view it might\nbe permissible to force someone to serve an end if that person can be\ngiven adequate reason to share the end, even if he does not\naccept it. Giving someone adequate reason then is not a matter of\nsimply deferring to the views of others. \n\nA major worry here is that this has not advanced us at all. The idea\nis that the law should not use controversial premises about the good\nin order to make law. Take for example a lawmaker, perhaps religious,\nwho adopts the view of a small minority that personhood begins from\nthe moment of conception and makes a law declaring abortion illegal on\nthis basis. This is precisely the sort of move that Nagel and Rawls\nwant to rule out. A controversial view such as this one has, for them,\nno place in making law for the public backed up by\ncoercion. Irrespective of whether or not it is true metaphysically\nthat personhood begins from the moment of conception, a view of this\nsort should be firmly locked out. \n\nRawls thus argues for a ‘duly qualified right’ on the part\nof a woman ‘to decide whether or not to end her pregnancy during\nthe first trimester.’(Rawls 1993, p. 243). In his view\n‘any comprehensive doctrine that leads to a balance of political\nvalues excluding that duly qualified right in the first trimester is\nto that extent unreasonable.’ The lawmaker in our example would\ntherefore, on this argument, be acting illegitimately and overstepping\nthe proper limits of the law. But why is this? What sorts of argument\ncould possibly be raised against the lawmaker? First, one might say\nhis legislation is inadmissible because it is not based on public\nreason.  Secondly, one might say it is illegitimate because it\nconcerns the good and not the right. Third, one might say the argument\nis inadequate because it is a highly controversial view, believed only\nby a small number and rejected by most. Finally—and this clearly\nis the line that Rawls and Nagel wish to avoid—one might simply\nsay that it is untrue to say that personhood begins at conception. Let\nus take these considerations in turn. \n\nAs for the first, there does not seem to be any basis for thinking\nthat reasons cannot be adduced for this rule that could be presented\npublicly, combined with the claim that they are reasons all should\nshare. Robert George for one spends some time arguing this, claiming\nthat from the point of conception there is ‘a genetically\ncomplete organism directed towards its own functioning.’ (George\n1999, pp. 209-213). As for the second point, the argument about\nabortion also shows the difficulty of trying to separate out arguments\nabout ‘the good’ from arguments about ‘the\nright.’ For if George is right that abortion is murder,\nit cannot be relegated to a question of the right and excluded from\npolitical justification. As we saw when discussing neutrality, no\nneutralist argues the law need be neutral about what is right. A\ngroup, call them the ‘evolutionary exterminators,’ could\nnot be heard by the neutralist to argue that their desire to kill all\nhomeless people should be treated in the same way as the desires of\nbird-watchers. Bird watchers, the neutralist would say, do not violate\nrights; ‘evolutionary exterminators’ do, or would if\nallowed their way. This still leaves open the question of what counts\nas a rights violation. If abortion is murder that\nwould. \n\nThe third point is no help either. It would no doubt be tempting to\nsay to our imagined lawmaker: ‘You might call abortion murder\nand you might think you've based your view on good reasons. But\nlook around you; virtually everyone thinks you are wrong. So you must\nrestrict your views only to those others who share your views, not\nimpose them on everyone else.’ The lawmaker would have an easy\nresponse to this, namely that the argument amounts to little more than\nhead-counting. It seems to be drifting back into Lord Devlin's\nterritory, assimilating legal morality to moral beliefs and gut\nreactions. This, as we have seen, will not do: if most people believed\nslavery permissible, that would not make it\n so.[12]\n None of these arguments do anything to show that our imaginary\nlegislator is acting illegitimately. George's argument is perfectly\npublic, it can be placed in terms of the right rather than the good;\nqua argument against homicide, it violates no neutrality\nconstraint. And it is no objection to say that the view is a minority\none. It is only the fourth argument that would show the illegitimacy\nof the imaginary legislator's actions. For what it is worth I believe\nGeorge's arguments are unconvincing and could be shown to be mistaken\nsimply on the basis of substantive counter-arguments to his own. But,\nof course, even if that is right, it is the very kind of argument that\nRawls and Nagel want excluded from the debate, so could not help them,\non their premises, to establish the conclusion of illegitimacy they\nseek to establish. The best arguments against George's position would\nbe ruled out of court. \n\nNagel's argument claims that one treats a person as a means only if\none does not give him adequate reason to share the end you are\ncoercing him into. One starts to wonder if any work is being\ndone by anything other than the idea of ‘adequate\nreason’. Coerce where you have adequate reason! If the idea of\n‘a reason he can share’ becomes a reason he\nought to share, then there may be nothing to this latter idea\nother than a useful heuristic device. The idea of ‘sharing\nreasons’ simply drops out of the picture. John Finnis, like\nRobert George a well known proponent of Natural Law theory, rather\ndisarmingly announces that ‘Natural Law theory is nothing other\nthan the account of all the reasons-for-action which people ought to\nbe able to accept, precisely because these are good, valid and sound\nas reasons.’ (Finnis 1996, pp. 10-11). Now clearly if a\ncomprehensive doctrine such as natural law theory with its robust\nconception of the good life can pass the test, the test is likely to\nbe a blunt instrument. It will need to show it can avoid ruling out\ntoo little to become a live option. \n\nFor all the fatal deficiencies of Lord Devlin's own view of the limits\nof the law, his challenge is extremely difficult to meet.  Principled\nlimits beyond means-ends or practical limits are elusive and hard to\njustify. The central dilemma revolves around the question of recourse\non the part of law-makers to moral truth. Should this be unlimited\nexcept by practical and means-ends limits and the considerable\ninternal limits that a genuine sensitivity to the truth brings? In\nthis case it will be difficult to dispel the notion that law-makers\nare being cut too much slack and that some persons are being specially\nblessed by the law in comparison to others: for disagreement on\nmatters of what is genuinely demanded by truth and morality is showing\nno sign of going away. This may merely be a facet of the human\ncondition and in fighting it we may be tilting at\n windmills.[13] \n\nOn the other hand, is the better view that law-makers should, as a\nmatter of principle, be denied recourse to certain moral premises\nbased on the good life, not because the premises are false, but in an\nattempt to dissipate the feeling that partisan conceptions of the\ngood, held by some only, are being especially favoured? Here one soon\nruns into the problem that in eschewing full recourse to the truth in\npolitical argument, one is apt to come up against some awkward\nopponents, espousing sometimes unpalatable views, who are happy to\nrender their arguments public, happy to make them subject to\n‘reasonable rejectability’ and happiest of all to assert\nthat their principles cannot be reasonably rejected. The\ndebate is set to continue for some time yet.","contact.mail":"john.stanton-ife@kcl.ac.uk","contact.domain":"kcl.ac.uk"}]
