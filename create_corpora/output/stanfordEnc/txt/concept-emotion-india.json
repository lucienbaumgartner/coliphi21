The word rasa can mean juice, sap, essence,\ncondiment or even flavour and refers to the different sentiments\ninvoked by a work of art, for example a piece of music. However, this\nentry focuses on the emotions in Indian philosophical thinking outside\nof the realm of aesthetics. While there is no equivalent for the term\n“emotion” in Sanskrit, the concept nevertheless plays an\nimportant role in Indian philosophy. Terms used in Sanskrit texts\ninclude vedanā (feeling) and bhāva\n(feeling) as well as names of individual emotions, such as\nrāga (love, attraction), dveṣa (hatred,\naversion), harṣa (joy), bhaya (fear) and\nśoka (sorrow). One of the reasons why emotions are\nphilosophically interesting in India and the West is their\nrelationship with the mental phenomenon of\nvijñāna or jñāna which is\ntranslated as “cognition”. The relationship between\nemotion and cognition is important for any account of reason and\nrationality. While the importance of the emotions for rational\ndeliberation and decision-making has been acknowledged in recent\ndiscussions in the philosophy of mind, the history of Western\nphilosophy contains many views, for example those of Plato, Aristotle,\nand the Stoics, which emphasize the dangerous and destructive role of\nthe emotions. At the heart of these views lies a division of our\nmental lives into cognitions and feelings. Cognitions are\nrepresentational thoughts. They are often regarded as rational because\nthey are capable of representing the external world and therefore they\nprovide us with access to the external world, based on the best\navailable evidence. So, according to this view of rationality, when I\nthink that there is a book on the table, based on my available\nevidence, and there really is one, then my thought is rational.\nHowever, if I am hallucinating that there is a book on the table, my\nthought that there is a book might also be rational because the\navailable evidence points towards this thought. In order to make sure\nthat our thoughts represent reality correctly, we require an account\nof what counts as good evidence, which is one of the main foci of\nepistemology in Indian and Western philosophy. Nevertheless,\ncognitions derive their status as thoughts capable of rationality from\nthe fact that they have objects which represent the external world. By\ncontrast, feelings are some of the non-representational attitudes one\ncan have towards the objects of the representations of our thoughts.\nFor example, when a person thinks about her daughters, she has a\ncognition which represents her daughters. The objects of her thought\nare her daughters and her thought picks them out among various objects\nand subjects in the world. There are several ways in which these\nobjects can be picked out: one can simply have the thought that one\nhas two daughters or one's thought can be “coloured” with\nlove and affection. This “colouring” of thought is often\nregarded as an affect. Together with the thought, it accounts for an\nemotion. So, the emotion of love, for example, is the thought of the\nobject of love plus an affect. The affect is non-representational and\nregarded as a “mere” feeling.\n\n\nThe reason why many philosophers regard the emotions as an obstacle to\nrational thought is the influence of the non-representational feeling.\nThe fact that feelings do not seem to have objects means, according to\nsome views, that they can interfere with rational thought. According\nto these views, rational thought, which is representational and\ntherefore object-directed, is subject to disturbing interferences from\nthe feelings. The feelings themselves, however, are non-rational\nbecause they arise due to some physical imbalance in the body, for\nexample through an imbalance of the various “humours”.\nThis imbalance can negatively influence rational thought. An example\nis the person who acts against her better judgment because she is in\nthe grip of some feeling. This is of course also the basis for the\nterm “passion” as something that we “suffer”,\nwhich was discussed by many philosophers in the seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries, e.g. Descartes, Spinoza and Hume. Since rational\nthought is an ideal for many philosophers and the feelings can\ninterfere with this ideal, the natural consequence seems to be to\nadvocate for the extinction or at least the control of the feelings\nand, as a consequence, of the emotions. This is what many philosophers\nthroughout the history of philosophy have done, most notably of course\nthe Stoics. While they often recognize that the emotions contain a\ncognitive, and therefore potentially rational, element, they try to\nuncover this element by advocating its separation from the affect. Of\ncourse, if the affect were to be purged from the emotion, the\nresulting cognition would cease to be an emotion.\n\n\nThere is a parallel between this Western view and a prejudice that\nattaches to Indian philosophy. The prejudice is that Indian\nphilosophy, because of its soteriological nature with its emphasis on\nthe attainment of liberation, is about freeing the mind from feelings\nand emotions because they constitute an attachment to the world. While\nthis is true of some schools of Indian philosophy, it is by no means a\njustified account of Indian philosophy as a whole. The different\npositions within Indian philosophy on this topic are more complex, as\nis the case with regard to Western philosophy. This article introduces\nsome of the main positions regarding the emotions and their relation\nto cognitions in Indian philosophy. The sections of the article\nroughly correspond to the division into philosophical schools in\nclassical Indian philosophy. Since arguably Buddhist philosophers have\npaid more attention to those phenomena that Western philosophers would\nclassify as emotions than other Indian philosophers, the Buddhist\naccount of the emotions will be discussed in more detail than the\nother accounts.\n\nThe discussion of this account will focus on the\nNyāya-sūtras, Vātsyāyana's\nNyāya-bhāṣya, Uddyotakara's\nNyāya-vārttika and Jayanta Bhaṭṭa's\nNyāya-mañjarī. In addition, the\nVaiśeṣika-sūtras together with\nŚaṅkara Miśra's\nVaiśeṣika-sūtra-upaskāra will be\nmentioned. The Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika account of the emotions\ninvolves a strict division into cognition (jñāna)\nand mental phenomena that include a feeling aspect, such as love or\nattraction (rāga) and aversion (dveṣa).\nOne of the main reasons for this is the acceptance of the existence of\na permanent immaterial self (ātman) by the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers. According to their\narguments, the ātman is a substance (dravya)\nwhich possesses several qualities (guṇas), such as\ncognition, desire, effort, aversion, pleasure and pain. This\nenumeration shows that there is no common Sanskrit term for the\nconcept “emotion” in the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika\ntexts. One general term used is saṃvedana which\ntranslates as “feeling”, for example\nsukha-saṃvedana (feeling of pleasure). \nThe important aspect of the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika account is\nthat the individual emotions, such as attachment and aversion are\nregarded as defects (doṣas) [NB 1.1.18] or impurities\n(upadhā) [VS and VSU 6.2.4]. These defects are the\nresult of ignorance (mithyājñāna) and they\ngive rise to actions that lead to the feeling of pleasure or pain. The\nreason why this is regarded as negative is that the feeling of\npleasure and pain is responsible for our attachment to the world and,\nmore importantly, for our attachment to the self and therefore\npresents an obstacle to liberation. For this reason, any emotion is\ndeemed to have a negative influence on the individual. However, NV\n1.1.22 mentions one exception, namely the desire for eternal pleasure\nand absence from pain which is final liberation. While, strictly\nspeaking, a desire is not an emotion, it usually has the same negative\neffect because it results in attachment to the object of desire. The\ndesire for eternal pleasure, however, is not detrimental to\nliberation; in fact it is a precondition for liberation. \nThe Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers clearly distinguish\nbetween pleasure (sukha) and pain (duḥkha) on\nthe one hand and the experience of pleasure (sukha-pratyaya)\nand pain (duḥkha-pratyaya) on the other hand. Pain and\npleasure are qualities of the soul but they need to be cognized by the\nself in order to be experienced. This means that cognition has a\nspecial status among the qualities of self: no other quality can be\nexperienced without cognition. \nAnother reason why cognition is an important quality is that it is not\nnecessarily a defect whereas the other qualities are always defects.\nThe defects fall into 3 groups: i) attraction (rāga),\nii) aversion (dveṣa) and iii) illusion (moha)\n[NS 4.1.3]. Among the first group we find love, selfishness and greed.\nThe second group includes anger, jealousy, envy, malice and\nresentment. The Third group encompasses error, suspicion, pride and\nnegligence. These groupings show that, according to the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika account, there are no positive\nemotions. Even love, which is regarded as a positive emotion in many\ncultures, is ultimately a defect because all emotions lead to\nattachment and error. \nThe opposite of all three types of defect is described in NB 4.1.4 as\nknowledge of truth (tattvajñāna), right knowledge\n(samyaṅmati), truthful cognition\n(āryaprajñā) and right apprehension\n(sambodha). This shows that, according to the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers, emotions are defects\nbecause they prevent our thinking from turning into right knowledge.\nThis knowledge can thus only be had if we eliminate these defects and\nthereby our emotions. \nAccording to NS 4.1.6, illusion is the worst defect because without it\nthe others are not going to appear. This means that one has to be\nunder an illusion already in order to think that the object of one's\nattraction provides pleasure and the object of one's aversion pain. In\nfact, NS and NB 4.1.58 state that ordinary pleasure should be regarded\nas pain: \nThis quote shows that ultimately the feeling of pleasure is an\nillusion and that our ordinary existence is necessarily beset with\npain. This demonstrates the link between feeling and error, according\nto the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers. Both pleasure and\npain are two factors that are responsible for our notion of\n“I” that prevents us from attaining final liberation.\nTherefore, the pursuit of pleasure is futile and ought to be abandoned\nin favour of final liberation. \nFor the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers, pleasure and\npain are not forms of cognition because they have different causes\nthan cognitions [VS and VSU 10.1.5–6]. This means that we can\nhave a cognition without a feeling and we can also have a feeling\nwithout a cognition. In addition, they are experienced differently\n[NM, vol. 1, p. 118]. This separation between cognitions and feelings,\ntogether with the view that feelings are defects that disturb\ncognitions, means that feelings are regarded as purely negative. They\nlead to an attachment to the world which causes a sense of self and\nthis sense of self provides an obstacle to liberation. \nThe Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika view shows similarities with the\nreceived view of the emotions in Western philosophy with regard to the\npoint that feelings are a disturbance of cognition. However, in many\nWestern accounts cognition is regarded as an end in itself because it\ncoincides with the ideal of rational thinking, whereas according to\nthe Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers cognition is not an\nend in itself. Rather, it is supposed to lead to the conclusion that\nfinal liberation is the ultimate aim and final liberation means the\nend of cognition. \nIn his commentary on the Brahma-sūtras,\nŚaṃkara makes the well-known argument that the self\n(ātman) exists because its existence is the only way to\naccount for the idea of a subject of experience. This argument relies\non the idea that the self has certain mental qualities, which are\ntermed manas (mind), buddhi (intellect),\nvijñāna (cognition) or citta\n(consciousness), depending on what mental function is ascribed to\nthem. Different mental functions are doubt, resolution, egoism or\nrecollection [BSBh 2.4.6]. These mental functions, regardless of how\nthey are referred to, have several qualities or modifications,\nincluding desire, imagination, doubt, faith, want of faith, memory,\nforgetfulness, shame, reflection and fear [BSBh 2.3.32] as well as\nlove, aversion, pleasure and pain [BSBh 2.3.29]. This means that,\naccording to Śaṃkara, the mind's cognitive and emotional\nabilities are the qualities of our mental functioning which is\ndifferent from the self. \nAt the heart of Śaṃkara's teaching lies the notion that the\ntrue knowledge of the ātman is knowledge that is devoid\nof any of the above-mentioned qualities. In this respect one can find\na similarity between the Nyāya school and Śaṃkara\nbecause for both of them cognitive and emotional qualities are due to\nfalse knowledge or ignorance of the true self. This means that the\nremoval of ignorance results in a removal of emotions as well as\ncognitions. However, it is clear that the emotions present the main\nobstacle for the realization of the true self because desire and\naversion lead to attachment and clinging which cause us to neglect the\nsearch for liberation that is crucial to Vedānta teaching. So,\nwhile Śaṃkara distinguishes between what Western\nphilosophers would call cognitions and emotions, he does not present a\npurely cognitive state of mind without emotions as the ideal state of\nmind because such a state would be impossible. By definition, any\npurely cognitive state of mind presupposes the existence of a mind or\nintellect. For Śaṃkara, however, the problem is that a mind\nwill always have certain qualities that would be called emotive in\nWestern philosophy, such as desire, aversion, hatred, pleasure or\npain. So, as long there are cognitions, there will also be emotions.\nTherefore, both must be eliminated in order for the self to attain\nliberation. On this point, Śaṃkara agrees with the\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers. While Śaṃkara\ndistinguishes between emotions and cognitions, his distinction is not\nas pronounced as that of the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika\nphilosophers. He regards both as qualities of the mind or\nintellect. \nUnlike the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika and Vedānta accounts\nof the emotions, the Sāṃkhya-Yoga account does not draw a\nfundamental distinction between feelings and cognitions. The reason\nfor this is that the Sāṃkhya account rests on the division\nbetween puruṣa and prakṛti. The former\nis pure consciousness and does not contain any cognitions or feelings\nwhereas prakṛti is primordial matter and has the three\nqualities (guṇas) sattva, rajas and\ntamas, which are aligned with different feelings:\nsattva with pleasure (sukha), rajas with\npain (duḥkha) and tamas with confusion or\nillusion (moha). The terms sattva, rajas\nand tamas are difficult to translate but are sometimes\nrendered as “reflection”, “activity” and\n“inertia”. The important point about this dualist\nstructure for the emotions is that, according to the\nSāṃkhya account, both cognition and feeling belong to the\nrealm of prakṛti which means that they are material.\nThis stands in contrast to many dualist accounts in the history of\nWestern philosophy, for example that of Descartes, according to which\ncognitions are immaterial whereas emotions or passions are material,\nthus making it easier to oppose the two. Larson and Bhattacharya\n(1987) summarize the difference between Western and Sāṃkhya\ndualism in the following way: \nThe relationship between puruṣa and\nprakṛti in Sāṃkhya philosophy is complex:\npuruṣa as pure consciousness is characterized by\ninaction (akartṛbhāva) and pure presence\n(sākṣitva). It does not stand in any relation with\nprakṛti, which comprises the material world, including\nmental processes. Nevertheless, puruṣa forms the\nfoundation of prakṛti. This means that\npuruṣa provides the meaning for all material processes.\nThus prakṛti exists for puruṣa and it is\nonly because of this that the world is not simply a collection of\nmeaningless physical processes. In addition, the intellect as part of\nprakṛti is supposed to realize that it is not\nconsciousness and it is to become aware of pure consciousness as the\nway to liberation. This means that the intellect is supposed to\nunderstand the contentless pure consciousness but of course in order\nto do so it would have to become contentless itself, which seems\nimpossible. Therefore, the intellect can only achieve this in an\nindirect way without cognition. Instead, we require meditative or\nyogic exercises to understand the difference between\npuruṣa and prakṛti. \nIn spite of the fact that cognition and emotion are both material,\nemotions have a negative connotation in Sāṃkhya philosophy.\nIn this regard the account is similar to that of many Western\nphilosophers. However, in Western philosophy the idea is to have\ncognition free from emotion. By contrast, the Sāṃkhya\nphilosophers do not think of cognition as a desirable end in itself.\nRather, their idea is that ultimate liberation lies in the recognition\nof puruṣa by prakṛti. This means that\nour everyday experience of ourselves as conscious intellects with\ncognitions and emotions is an obstacle on the way to realizing what\npure contentless consciousness is. In fact, Sāṃkhya\nphilosophers argue that our experience of ourselves as conscious\nbeings is a mistake that needs to be rectified in order to achieve\nliberation. This realization is extremely difficult to achieve and\ntherefore Sāṃkhya proposes first of all to clear the mind\nof the passions [SSu 2.15] by separating them from cognition and then\nto free the mind from cognition in order to comprehend contentless\nconsciousness. So emotions or passions are regarded as negative but\nthey are not contrasted with cognitions because cognitions themselves\nare supposed to be overcome in order to understand\npuruṣa. \nIn the Yogasūtras, Patañjali provides a method\nfor understanding the difference between puruṣa and\nprakṛti via a series of exercises that aim at stripping\naway all of the disturbing influences from the mind, including what\nWestern philosophers would classify as emotions. In fact,\nPatañjali argues that the mind is affected by afflictions\n(kleśas) that keep it from becoming clear about the\ndifference between puruṣa and prakṛti.\nIn YS 2.3, Patañjali lists the afflictions: \nThese afflictions need to be removed in order to achieve liberation.\nUnlike in many Western accounts of the emotions, the removal of the\nafflictions is not supposed to lead to a form of rational thinking\nthat is divorced from any emotion. Rather, rational thinking itself\nneeds to be overcome, in order to achieve true liberation by\nseparating puruṣa from prakṛti. \nThe main reason why emotions such as attachment and aversion are\nregarded as afflictions is that they lead to a desire to change our\ncircumstances and therefore to an attachment to the world. This\nattachment, however, is precisely what is to be given up in order to\nachieve liberation. So, Patañjali and his commentators argue\nthat emotions lead to desire and therefore have to be given up as one\nof the root causes of ignorance that causes attachment to the world.\nOnly then can the mind discriminate between puruṣa and\nprakṛti. \nOne interesting parallel between Western accounts of the emotions and\nPatañjali is the use of the “colouring”\n(uparāga) or “coloured” (uparaktam)\nmetaphor with regard to the mind [e.g. in YS 4.23]. Patañjali\nclaims that the mind is “coloured” by all of the objects\nit knows, including cognitions and emotions. This means that in order\nto understand the difference between itself and pure consciousness\n(puruṣa), it has to free itself from these colourings\nand become pure. Only then can it recognize that it is different from\nthe puruṣa which cannot be known in itself because it\ncannot become an object of the mind. Vyāsa, in his commentary on\nYS 4.23, explains that the mind itself is an object that appears as a\nconscious subject which is why many philosophers mistake it for the\nsubject. However, once the mind becomes empty of all objects the\ndifference between the mind and puruṣa reveals itself.\nVyāsa makes the argument that a mind which is empty of all\nobjects can still know itself and thus it would have to become an\nobject in the mind, i.e. itself. In other words, cognition would have\nto be cognized by itself. This, however, is impossible, according to\nhim. Instead, puruṣa shows itself as that which makes\ncognition possible. In this sense, puruṣa can be\ncompared to Husserl's idea of the “transcendental ego”.\nSo, puruṣa can only reveal itself indirectly by\nemptying the mind of all cognitions, including emotions. This means\nthat emotions are regarded as an obstacle to liberation but at the\nsame time, they share this designation with other cognitions of the\nworld. \nThe Sāṃkhya-Yoga account of the emotions thus shows some\nsimilarities with the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika account in that\nboth regard the emotions as the first obstacle to liberation. Both\naccounts differ from many Western views in that they regard\nemotion-free thinking not as an end in itself but as the next obstacle\nto be removed. For the Sāṃkhya-Yoga philosophers there is a\ndistinction between veridical and non-veridical cognition\n(vijñāna). The latter is classified as ignorance\n(avidyā), which, together with certain emotions, forms\nthe afflictions (kleśas). The Yoga-sūtras\n[YS 2.4] emphasize that ignorance is the most fundamental affliction\nthat is the root of all other afflictions. In his commentary on YS\n2.3, Vyāsa states that “the afflictions are the five forms\nof unreal cognition.” So, as Sinha points out: \nWe therefore see similarities between a cognitive account of the\nemotions and the Sāṃkhya-Yoga account because both claim\nthat emotions have mental objects but at the same time there is a\ndifference in how emotions can relate to knowledge, with the\nSāṃkhya-Yoga philosophers claiming that knowledge and\nemotions are incompatible. \nWhile there are many nuances in the accounts of the emotions among\nBuddhist writers, there are also certain key ideas that are common to\nall of them. This section, tries to bring out these key ideas by\nanalyzing some of the writings of the Buddhist philosophers\nDharmakīrti, Śāntarakṣita and\nKamalaśīla. \nAs with other Indian accounts of the emotions, the Buddhist conception\nof emotion appears in the context of the discussion about the role of\ncognition (vijñāna). Buddhist philosophers argue\nagainst the existence of a self (ātman). At the same\ntime, they acknowledge the existence of a non-physical momentary\nconsciousness or chain of cognitions (santāna\nvijñāna) which carries over from former births into\nthe present and future rebirths. Thus, Buddhists try to find a middle\nground between a permanent non-physical self and the materialism of\nthe Lokāyata school (materialist school of philosophy) which\nargues that the self is purely the result of bodily processes.\nAccording to the materialists, the self comes into existence with the\nbody and ceases to exist when the body ceases to exist. \nIn the Pramāṇa-siddhi-chapter of the\nPramāṇa-vārttika, Dharmakīrti argues\nthat past lives exist. We can know this because of the authority of\nthe Buddha and we have reason to accept his authority because of his\ninfinite compassion. This compassion can only be the result of\npractice over many life times [PV 36]. The Lokāyata philosophers\nargue that cognitions require the support of a body and therefore\ncease to exist when the body ceases to exist. Dharmakīrti objects\nto this by arguing that mental cognitions do not derive from any\nphysical support [PV 49]. Śāntarakṣita and\nKamalaśīla state that the relationship between the support\nand what is supported can be analyzed either as a causal relationship\nor as the relationship between an object and its capacity [TS and TSP\n1858–1859]. In this respect they do not deviate from\nDharmakīrti who rejects this position of the Lokāyata\nphilosophers by arguing that the body could be neither the cause of\ncognition nor could it have the capacity of cognition. Franco explains\nDharmakīrti's argument in the following way: \nOf course, there is no reason why the Lokāyata philosophers\nshould say that the body is changeless. It might precisely be the\nchanges that appear in the body, for example in the brain, which are\nresponsible for cognition. Dharmakīrti argues that if cognition\nrequired the support of the body, there is no reason why it should not\narise everywhere where there exists a body or matter [PV 37–38].\nThe obvious objection to this argument is that not any form of matter\nsupports cognition. It has to be a particular kind of matter, ordered\nin a particular way, as is the case in human beings and many\nanimals. \nAccording to Buddhist “psychology”, love and hatred are\ntwo of the afflictions (kleśas) that befall human beings\nand that need to be removed in order to attain liberation. There are a\nnumber of sections in the Yogācāra-bhūmi,\npossibly written by either Asaṅga or Maitreya, that discuss\nthese kleśas. The text provides several lists, most of\nwhich include love (rāga) and hatred or enmity\n(pratigha). Other kleśas are:\nsatkāya-dṛṣṭi (false view with regard\nto the satkāya (five skandhas)), attachment to\nextreme views, attachment to unwholesome views, attachment to\npractices and observances, pride, ignorance and doubt. These\nkleśas could be associated with one or more of the five\npossible feelings: pleasant feeling (sukha), unpleasant\nfeeling (duḥkha), neutral feeling\n(upekṣā), happy mood (sau-manasya) or\nunhappy mood (daur-manasya). A translation of the\npsychological categories of the Yogācāra-bhūmi\ninto the categories of Western philosophy of mind would render the\nfollowing distinctions: a kleśa is a mental phenomenon\nthat consists of a representation of an object plus a certain feeling,\nsensation or affect. For example, in the case of love, the\nYogācāra-bhūmi states that we have the object\nof love plus either a pleasant sensation or a happy mood or\nindifference (neutral feeling). It is interesting to note that the\nmental phenomenon of love can be connected with indifference. In\ngeneral, this suggests that a sensation is comparable to a\npsychological attitude and that we always have to have one attitude or\nanother towards a mental object. This means that our thinking is never\nwithout a feeling, even if it is a “neutral” feeling. It\nis unclear, however, in what way we could experience the emotion of\nlove with the sensation of indifference. It seems that love always\nrequires a positive feeling. The\nYogācāra-bhūmi allows for a mental phenomenon\nto count as the experience of love, as long as it does not involve a\n“negative”, i.e. unhappy or unpleasant, feeling. \nIn addition, the text acknowledges that a representation can be about\na real object or an imagined object. In the latter case, the question\narises in what way we can distinguish between an object and its\nrepresentation. This suggests that at least some Buddhist traditions\ndistinguish between a cognition, the object of a cognition and the\nfeeling accompanying a cognition. Śāntarakṣita\nmentions kleśas in TS 1955 and it is obvious that he\noperates within the context of this psychological distinction which\nbecomes clear in his discussion of love (rāga) and\nhatred (dveṣa). \nŚāntarakṣita argues that love and hatred exist due to\nhabit and repetition which is ascertained by confirming and\ndisconfirming concomitance. This means that they are learned through\nexperience. For example, love is learned by a person being confronted\nwith objects to which this feeling is attributed and thus reinforced\nthe more of these objects a person encounters. However, we can observe\nthe existence of love and hatred in babies who have not had the\nrepeated experience of these objects in this life.\nŚāntarakṣita claims that the existence of love and\nhatred cannot be due to the first encounter with the object of love or\nhatred because it would be possible, as indeed happens according to\nhim, to encounter this object without the respective feelings of love\nor hatred or to encounter it with another feeling, such as disgust. As\nan example, Śāntarakṣita mentions the attraction a man\nmight feel towards a woman. He claims that men are attracted to women\nif they also attribute “goodness” and\n“devotedness” to them, even though a particular woman\nmight not possess these qualities. So the qualities that make, for\nexample, a woman “lovable” do not have to exist in the\nwoman and therefore, according to Śāntarakṣita, the\nwoman cannot be said to be the cause of the feeling of love in the\nman. Love, then is not an object of the senses\n(viṣaya). Therefore, the reason why these feelings\nexist is through force of habit in previous lives. We have learned\nover time that women are “lovable”. This argument is meant\nto demonstrate that love and hatred could not exist if the\nmaterialists were right and mental life was simply the result of\nbodily processes. \nKamalaśīla explains this argument in his commentary on TS\n1948–1953 in a rather straightforward way and adds a very\nhelpful example: \nIn this passage, Kamalaśīla draws a distinction between the\ncognition of blue and the feeling of love. His point is that the\ncognition of blue is a perception and therefore requires an object\nwhereas a feeling of love does not. There is no basis for love in the\nway that there is a basis for our perception of blue. So,\nŚāntarakṣita's argument, as explained by\nKamalaśīla, consists of two parts: a) love, hatred etc. are\nlearned through experience and reinforced by repetition and b) love,\nhatred etc. are not perceptions. \nIn TS 1958, Śāntarakṣita provides a similar example of\nmale animals that become “perturbed” by the touch of\nfemale animals even though they do not know anything about any\n“doings” (vṛttānta) or sexual\nintercourse, yet. His argument is that this feeling must be due to\nexperiences in previous lives. He does not account for the possibility\nof instinctual behaviour. If Śāntarakṣita allowed for\nthe existence of instinctual behaviour then his observation of babies\nand animals might have let him to believe that love and hatred are\nmental phenomena that are not learned through experience. \nŚāntarakṣita clearly believes that there is something\nfundamental about the feelings of love and hatred. They are so\nfundamental that even babies feel them. At the same time, they require\nexperience. So the question is how was the first feeling of love (or\nhatred) acquired? There might have been a time when humans did not\nhave the feeling of love and they only acquired it at some point in\ntheir lives through experience and subsequent repetition of the\nexperience. This sounds like a strange idea precisely because love and\nhatred are so fundamental to our unenlightened lives that the\nexistence of a time when they did not exist seems impossible. Yet,\nŚāntarakṣita's view implies either that there must\nhave been such a time or that there is an infinite chain of these\nfeelings stretching backwards. In TS 1872,\nŚāntarakṣita makes it clear that he believes in the\nlatter option: \nSo, Śāntarakṣita might argue that love and hatred are\njust as much part of a “chain of cognitions” that is\nwithout beginning and end as all other cognitions. The reason why he\npostulates the existence of this eternal “chain of\ncognitions” is the argument that no cognition could be caused by\nanything other than a previous cognition and hence there cannot be a\nfirst cognition for anything we call a particular being. If there was\na first cognition for a particular being then, according to\nŚāntarakṣita (TS 1878–1885), there would be five\noptions: i) the first cognition does not have a cause; ii) it is\nproduced by an eternal cause; iii) it is eternal and unchanging; iv)\nit is caused by another substance; and v) it is caused by a cognition\n“from another chain”. \nŚāntarakṣita rejects the first option because he\nargues that according to this idea the foetus would somehow receive\nthe first cognition without any cause. This means that the cognition\nwould be eternal, rather than momentary. Śāntarakṣita\nrejects the second option because if the cognition is produced by an\neternal non-material cause then it should itself be eternal. The\nargument is that if something which exists eternally can bring about a\ncognition then there is no point in time at which this cause could\nhave brought about the effect. So the effect is eternal in the same\nway as the cause. But an eternal effect cannot exist because something\nwhich is eternal does not have a cause. The third option that the\ncognition is eternal runs counter to our experience which tells us\nthat cognitions are momentary. Śāntarakṣita also\ndismisses the Lokāyata position that cognitions are produced by\nphysical substances because the Lokāyata philosophers argue that\nmaterial substances are eternal. So, Śāntarakṣita\nmakes a similar argument to the rejection of option two. An eternal\ncause has to have an eternal effect but cognitions are not eternal.\nOption five is rejected in TS 1893–1896 where\nŚāntarakṣita argues that the first cognition of one\nchain cannot be solely caused by a cognition from another chain\nbecause in that case we would expect the knowledge of parents to carry\nover into their babies. \nThe second part (b) of Śāntarakṣita's argument, that\nlove and hatred are different from perception, is intriguing in that\nhe claims that there cannot be an external cause for love and hatred\nbecause whatever we might want to postulate as this external object\ncan elicit different feelings in different people. The object of one\nperson's love might be the object of another person's aversion. For\nthis reason, love and hatred cannot be acquired in this life, like\nperceptions. So the love and hatred that exist in a baby or young\nanimal must be carried over from another life. This argument assumes\nthat there could not be non-perceptual cognition that can arise\nwithout previous experience and therefore faces the same challenges as\nthe claim that all feelings have to be learned through repeated\nexperience. But it goes beyond this discussion in that it raises the\nquestion of what the object of love and hatred is.\nKamalaśīla uses the term vaśa (desire, love)\nrather than rāga in his commentary on TS 1948–1953\nwhich suggests that he does not clearly distinguish between desire and\nlove. If it is true that rāga is a kleśa\nthen it is plausible that there is no distinction between love and\ncraving. So he could be making the obvious point that we can desire\nsomething without a basis in the external world, i.e. what I desire\nmight not exist, or that I might desire something for the wrong\nreasons. Love, hatred and desire all require the existence of an\nobject. However, unlike a perceptual object, the objects of love and\ndesire can be “merely” mental. I can love the idea of\nequality or I can desire something which does not exist. This\n“non-existence” can be two-fold: i) I can desire something\nwhich cannot exist either logically or physically, for example, I can\ndesire that I had wings; ii) if I desire something to be the case,\nthen what I desire does not exist, yet. For example, if I desire an\nice-cream then the state of affairs in which I have an ice-cream does\nnot exist, yet. In contrast with love and desire, perception, at least\non a realist account, requires its object to exist in the external\nworld. \nWhile the argument about the difference between perception and love\ndoes not show that love requires previous experience, it raises, (at\nleast) two interesting questions about the Buddhist account of the\nemotions: i) why does Śāntarakṣita draw a distinction\nbetween perception and feeling on the basis of the non-existence of\nexternal objects in the case of love, hatred and desire? ii) why does\nhe make a specific argument about love and hatred when he has already\nargued in previous verses of the\nLokāyata-parīkṣā that all cognitions\nrequire other cognitions as their causes? \nIn what follows, these questions are addressed briefly in reverse\norder. The second question raises the general problem of the\ntranslatability of the concept of feeling or emotion into Sanskrit. As\nmentioned in the introduction, there is no general term in Sanskrit\nfor emotion and Śāntarakṣita uses the expression\n“love and hatred etc.” (rāga-dveṣa +\nādi). In the translation, Jha has taken the\n“etc.” as referring to other feelings, assuming that\nŚāntarakṣita was operating with a psychological\ncategory such as “feeling”. However, there is no single\nword in the text which would translate as feeling every time it\nappears in the translation. In fact, it is clear that\nŚāntarakṣita does not mean “feelings” in\nthe sense of non-representational attitudes towards objects because\nlove and hatred have objects according to him, albeit mental objects.\nSince Śāntarakṣita remains within the context of\nBuddhist psychology and clearly refers to Dharmakīrti, it is\nplausible that he means “other kleśas”\ninstead of “other feelings” because love and hatred are\nkleśas and have objects. \nIn this context, it is also important to discuss the translation of\nthe term vijñāna as “cognition”. Both\nterms refer to a mental phenomenon that provides knowledge. This means\nthat they refer to a state of affairs that pertains in the world. Both\nterms presuppose an external or mental object they are directed\ntowards. One important difference between these two terms, which shows\nthe difficulty with translating vijñāna as\ncognition, is that, according to Śāntarakṣita, a\nvijñāna always has an object but it does not have\nto have conceptual content. In this sense, even a sensation or\nfeeling, such as the sensation of pleasure, is a\nvijñāna because it has an object but lacks\nconceptual content, according to Śāntarakṣita. The\nsensation has an object because it provides knowledge about mental\nstates and therefore has to have an object of knowledge. However, this\nobject is not conceptual. So, according to\nŚāntarakṣita, a vijñāna includes\naffective mental states, such as feelings, sensations and emotions and\ntherefore kleśas. The Western term\n“cognition”, by contrast, excludes affective mental\nstates. \nThe whole of the Lokāyata-parīkṣā of the\nTattva-saṃgraha is one argument for the existence of an\ninfinite chain of vijñānas that is independent of\nits physical manifestation. For Śāntarakṣita,\n“love, hatred and the rest” are examples of\nvijñānas. These vijñānas are\nalso kleśas but not all vijñānas\nare kleśas. Love and hatred are especially useful for\nhis argument because they are fundamental to our experience and\nemphasize the continuity of the “chain of\nvijñānas”. \nAccording to Śāntarakṣita,\nvijñānas can include feelings and emotions\nwhereas in Western psychology and philosophy cognitions are distinct\nfrom emotions and feelings. This means that the role of\nvijñānas in Śāntarakṣita's system\nis different from the role of cognitions in Western psychology and\nphilosophy. As I mentioned above, in the history of Western philosophy\nthe distinction between feeling and cognition has often been used as\nthe demarcation between feeling and rational thought with the ideal of\naffectless thought. For Śāntarakṣita and other\nBuddhist philosophers the ideal is not necessarily that of affectless\nthought. Instead, their ideal is that of an existence free from\nafflictions (kleśas). So, they try to extinguish one\nkind of mental phenomenon but their distinction is different from the\ndistinction between feeling and thought. For them, all mental\nphenomena that provide an obstacle to liberation should be eliminated.\nThis includes what Western psychologists would call emotions or\nfeelings. However, it also includes many affectless cognitions. This\nmeans that the Western psychological category “emotions”\ndoes not feature prominently in Śāntarakṣita's account\nof the mind. In fact, it is not clear that he would even recognize\nsuch a category. According to Buddhist psychology, some\nkleśas straddle the Western divide between feeling and\nthought. They involve both feeling and thought and they are a mental\nphenomenon, called a vijñāna. Whereas for many\nphilosophers in the history of Western philosophy, the ideal has been\nto purge feeling from thought, in order to attain a standard of\nrationality, the ideal for Śāntarakṣita and other\nBuddhist philosophers is to free our mental life from those\nvijñānas which are kleśas. The\nreason is not to attain some standard of rationality because, for\nBuddhists, most vijñānas are suspect in that they\ninvolve an attachment to the present life and therefore pose an\nobstacle to liberation. \nOne question that arises in this context is “why does\nŚāntarakṣita single out love and hatred, instead of\ndiscussing kleśas in general?”. One answer might\nbe that they are fundamental to our human experience and therefore\nlend themselves to Śāntarakṣita's argument that\ncognitions in general do not come into existence with the body. \nIn Western discussions of this topic, feelings are very often\nassociated with some physical change, such as a quicker heartbeat or a\nchange in the chemical make up of the brain. For this reason, emotions\nare very often regarded as providing some link between the mental and\nthe physical. Śāntarakṣita mentions this link between\nfeeling and physical changes in TS 1960. He claims that phlegm\n(balāsa) and other bodily changes are not responsible\nfor love, hatred or perturbations through sexual arousal because there\nis no observed concomitance between them. While this claim might be\ntrue with regard to phlegm, it is obviously false with regard to other\nphysical changes, especially changes in the brain. However, it would\nbe wrong to completely dismiss Śāntarakṣita's argument\nsimply because he turned out to be wrong about this empirical claim.\nAfter all, the argument raises important questions about the status of\nmental phenomena, such as love and hatred. This becomes clear when we\nthink about the other question mentioned earlier: why does\nŚāntarakṣita distinguish between perceptions on the\none hand and love and hatred on the other hand based on the existence\nor non-existence of external objects? While\nŚāntarakṣita often adopts an idealist position\ncompatible with the Yogācāra standpoint in the\nTattva-saṃgraha, he seems to switch to a realist\nposition in this case which is compatible with a\nSautāntrika standpoint. The best explanation for this\nswitch is that Śāntarakṣita and Kamalaśīla\nare arguing against Lokāyata philosophers (materialists), who do\nnot share the Yogācāra outlook on reality. This means that\nŚāntarakṣita and Kamalaśīla try to find\ncommon ground with these philosophers and therefore share their\nassumptions about the mind-independent existence of an external world.\nŚāntarakṣita's and Kamalaśīla's argument\nthen is that even with this assumption in place, it does not follow\nthat all cognitions are dependent on or even identical with the body.\nAccording to them, the Lokāyata philosophers would have to draw a\ndistinction between perceptions on the one hand and love and hatred on\nthe other hand, and while they might be able to account for\nperceptions they are not able to account for love and hatred. \nFrom the preceding arguments by the Buddhist philosophers\nDharmakīrti, Śāntarakṣita and\nKamalaśīla it becomes clear that Buddhist philosophers do\nnot operate with the psychological category “emotion”; at\nleast not in the way that other Indian (and Western) philosophers do.\nFor example, Śāntarakṣita and Kamalaśīla do\nnot consider love and hatred to be irrational because they involve\nnon-cognitive feelings that do not represent an external reality.\nKamalaśīla in particular makes it clear that for him love\nand hatred do not require a relationship to objects in the external\nworld. He argues that not having an external object is a salient\nfeature of love and hatred. In Western philosophy of mind we often use\nthe presence or absence of an object of love in order to distinguish\nbetween rational and irrational love. Śāntarakṣita and\nKamalaśīla, however, do not use this distinction in order to\nargue that love and hatred should be eliminated. As Buddhists, their\nconcern lies with the afflictions that prevent the mind from becoming\nliberated and whatever mental state is an affliction ought to be\neliminated. Emotions then are vijñānas and as\nsuch they always have an object. This position stands in contrast to\nphilosophical traditions, be they Indian or Western, in which feelings\nand emotions are often distinguished from cognitions because they lack\nan object. \nA number of themes emerge from this overview: 1) The Western\ncategories of “cognition” and “emotion” do not\nhave equivalents in classical Indian philosophy. This is interesting\nbecause it suggests that these concepts are not psychological\ncategories but perhaps social categories. While there has been some\nanthropological work done by, for example, Catherine Lutz on the\ndifferences in the categorization of specific emotions across\ncultures, there is the possibility that the category as a whole might\nnot translate into all cultures (see Danziger 1997). 2) One common\ntheme in classical Indian philosophy is that the phenomena that would\nbe labelled as “emotions” in Western philosophy are to be\neradicated because they prevent liberation. 3) None of the Indian\nphilosophical schools aim at “emotion-free” cognitions as\nan end in itself. In fact, those states that would be labelled\n“cognitions” in Western philosophy are also to be\neradicated because they also prevent liberation. 4) Indian schools\ndiffer over the inclusion of feeling states under the concept of\nvijñāna (cognition). Some schools distinguish\nbetween feeling states and vijñāna whereas\nothers, most notably Buddhists, do not. This last point suggests that\nthere is an interesting comparison to be made between Buddhist\naccounts and cognitive accounts of the emotions. However, any\ncomparison must be sensitive to the difficulties in translating the\nconcepts involved.","contact.mail":"jptuske@salisbury.edu","contact.domain":"salisbury.edu"}]
