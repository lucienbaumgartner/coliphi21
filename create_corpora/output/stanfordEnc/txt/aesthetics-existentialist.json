In most cases, a substantial\ninvolvement in artistic practice (as novelists, playwrights or\nmusicians) nourished their thinking on aesthetic experience. This is\ntrue already of two of the major philosophers who inspired\n20th century existentialism: Søren Kierkegaard and\nFriedrich Nietzsche. For reasons of space, however, this entry is\nrestricted to 20th century thinkers who at one point or\nanother accepted the tag “existentialist” as an accurate\ncharacterisation of their thinking, and who have made the most\nsignificant contributions to aesthetics: Albert Camus, Simone de\nBeauvoir, Gabriel Marcel, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Jean-Paul\nSartre.\n\n\n\nExistentialism owes its name to its emphasis on\n“existence”. For all the thinkers mentioned above,\nregardless of their differences, existence indicates the special way in\nwhich human beings are in the world, in contrast with other beings. For\nthe existentialists, the human being is “more” than what it\nis: not only does the human being know that it is but, on the\nbasis of this fundamental knowledge, this being can choose how\nit will “use” its own being, and thus how it will relate to\nthe world. “Existence” is thus closely related to freedom\nin the sense of an active engagement in the world. This metaphysical\ntheory regarding human freedom leads into a distinct approach to\nontology, i.e., the study of the different ways of being.\n\n\n\nThis ontological aspect of existentialism ties it to aesthetic\nconsiderations. Existentialist thinkers believe that, under certain\nconditions, freedom grants the human being the capacity of revealing\nessential features of the world and of the beings in it. Since artistic\npractice is one of the prime examples of free human activity, it is\ntherefore also one of the privileged modes of revealing what the world\nis about. However, since most of the existentialists followed Nietzsche\nin the conviction that “God is dead,” art’s power of\nrevelation is to a large extent devoted to expressing the absurdity of\nthe human condition. For the existentialists, the world is no longer\nhospitable to our human desire for meaning and order.\n\n\n\nThis ontological approach to art underpins some of the most\ndistinctive features of existentialist aesthetics. Because it views art\nin terms of “revelation,” it favors representative art and\nis suspicious of formalist avant-gardes. And because it grounds\nexpressive capacity on the notion of human freedom, it demands that\nartistic representation be strongly informed by ethical and political\nconcerns. This is why at times existentialist aesthetics can appear out\nof touch with the aesthetic avant-gardes of the 20th\ncentury.\n\n\n\nSome of the existentialists wrote substantial analyses about\ndifferent art forms and how they can be compared, elaborating something\nlike a “system of the arts” similar to that of classical\naesthetics. All the existentialist thinkers, with the exception of\nMerleau-Ponty, thought that the form that best enabled the revelatory\npotential of art was the theatre, followed by the novel.\n\n\n\nThe term “aesthetics” as it first emerged in modern\nphilosophy (in A. G. Baumgarten’s 1750 Aesthetica)\nencompassed the theory of perception, the theory of beauty and the\ntheory of art. This remained true of all classical philosophical\naesthetics in the late 18th and 19th centuries.\nIn this brand of aesthetics, the aesthetic moment is but one aspect of\nthe general theory of how humans perceive, know, and act in the world;\nthe theories of beauty and of artistic practice depend on the theories\nof perception, knowledge and judgement, and those in turn are premised\nupon more fundamental considerations regarding the nature of reality\nand our relationship to it. By contrast with the specialised aesthetic\ntheories developed in the last few decades, existentialist aesthetics\nis a continuation of this grand tradition. Existentialist aesthetics is\nintimately connected to certain metaphysical views, and it owes its\nrichness and consistency to the fact that it is part of a complex and\ncoherent philosophical system. Therefore we should begin by delineating\nthe most salient features of this metaphysical outlook. \n\nThe key insight that defines and unites existentialism as a\nphilosophical position, despite all the divergences between the authors\nincluded under that denomination, is the emphasis on the radical nature\nof human freedom, and the metaphysical and ontological imports of that\nfreedom. The metaphysical and ontological significance of freedom\nprecedes its moral, ethical, and political aspects, since the ways in\nwhich human beings “hook up” to the world should be\nconsidered before issues of duty or justice. For existentialism, human\nfreedom grounds the very possibility of knowledge in its deepest form,\ni.e., the capacity of human beings to reveal something about reality. A\nChristian existentialist like Gabriel Marcel interprets the\nmetaphysical reach of human freedom in terms of the capacity and\nresponsibility of individuals to make themselves\n“available” to the mystery of their participation in\ncreation, in particular by responding to the appeal of the great\n“Thou” (see in particular Marcel 1960b). Atheistic\nexistentialists (Camus, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Merleau-Ponty), on the\ncontrary, do not ground freedom in faith and the hope of accessing the\ntranscendent; instead they emphasise the difficulty of assuming that\nfreedom, since nothing can ensure that our attempts at finding meaning\nin the world will actually yield something objectively present in it.\nBut in all cases freedom is the ultimate ground of human beings’\ncapacity to relate to the world. \n\nFor the 20th century existentialists, a decisive\nphilosophical inspiration was phenomenology, the philosophical method\ndevised by the German philosopher, Edmund Husserl, during the late\n19th and early 20th centuries, and which his\nfamous student, Martin Heidegger, developed into a combination of\nexistential analysis and deep ontology. Even Camus, who does not define\nhimself as a phenomenologist, and indeed sometimes rejects the tag of\n“existentialist” (1945), appropriates the notion of\nintentionality, central to Husserl’s phenomenology, in his most\nfamous work, The Myth of Sisyphus (Camus 1942b,\n44–50). It follows that existentialist aesthetics and the\nphenomenological approach to aesthetic perception and judgement\n(Ingarden 1962, 1965) are two closely related areas. Mikel Dufrenne\nsituates his work precisely at this intersection (see especially\nDufrenne 1973). However, the existentialists’ approach to\nphenomenology is highly original, and has significant and distinctive\nimplications for aesthetics. \n\nWhat does intentionality mean, and why is it such a central notion\nin existentialist thinking about art? Husserl shows that when any type\nof meaning is articulated (in cognitive, moral, affective, aesthetic\nattitudes, etc.), a specific act of consciousness occurs. The\nspecificity of the meaning in question depends on the particular way in\nwhich consciousness “intends” its content in each case,\ni.e., the specific way in which it relates to a given (e.g., an object\nto know, judge, perceive, enjoy, and so on). In other words, different\ntypes of meaning depend on the specific structure of the acts of\nconsciousness that carry them; in particular, they depend on the\nspecific temporality of these mental acts. To give an example that made\nits way into some of the most famous existentialist literary works\n(e.g., in the famous descriptions in Nausea, Sartre’s\nfirst novel): there is a specific temporality involved in perceiving an\nobject in space. The object is not given in an instant, and every\nperception points to a potential new perception which will confirm or\nrevise the previous ones. This temporality of perception implies\nrecourse to memory and a unification of past moments of perception.\nThis emphasis on the way human consciousness “intends” the\nworld in different ways accounts not just for the content of human\nknowledge, but also, more radically, for the relationship of the human\nbeing to reality. It is not just an epistemological but a metaphysical\nposition. \n\nThis approach to the basic problem of metaphysics is highly\nsignificant because it circumvents the dualisms of classical\nphilosophy: subject vs. object, impression vs. a priori\nprinciples as the basis of knowledge, freedom vs. determinism, and so\non. The emphasis on intentionality avoids these dualisms because it\nentails, on the one hand, that all meanings are constituted through\nacts of human consciousness, thus insisting on the active role of the\nsubject in the formulation of any meaningful aspect of the world. On\nthe other hand, however, the theory of intentionality also implies that\nthe world already contains the meanings that consciousness reveals,\neither because these meanings are potentialities from the point of view\nof human action (this is Sartre’s view), or simply because these\nmeanings are already in the world (Merleau-Ponty’s view, but also\nthat of Marcel, for whom true knowledge arises from the openness to the\nfullness of Being). \n\nThe existentialists explicitly embraced the philosophical solution\nthat phenomenology provided. For example, Sartre’s What is\nLiterature?, the key text of existentialist aesthetics, starts off\nby reformulating the fundamental lesson of Husserlian\nphenomenology: \n\nSartre draws a basic aesthetic implication from the thesis that\nmeaning in the world depends on acts of consciousness: the fundamental\naim of the work of art is to deliberately and consistently exert this\nuniquely human quality to introduce meaningful order and regularities\ninto the world. Whereas in the “natural attitude” this\nhappens without the agent’s awareness (in the form of natural\nperception, folk and scientific knowledge), in artistic practice\nthe order, regularities, perspectives, and meaningful relationships are\nformalised, emphasised, systematised, and wilfully arranged. The\nsimultaneous effect is to “reveal” significant features of\nthe world and to gain a reflexive sense of being\nrevealers of the world and ‘manifesting’ it. Thus, our\nsense of freedom is tremendously increased: \n\nThus the first aspect of aesthetic pleasure is this double\n“joy” (Sartre 1948a, 41) of “disclosing” the\nworld and fully appropriating the unique power to do so, becoming aware\nand exercising our radical freedom. This first aspect of aesthetic\npleasure can be called “metaphysical”, since it arises from\nthe fundamental relation between humans and the world (Howells 1988). \n\nIndeed, such is the metaphysical reach of human freedom that every\nattempt to disclose a portion of the world tends to aim for the\ndisclosure of the “totality” of beings. This is because (as\nHusserl already insisted) the most partial or minute act of\nperception entails a reference to a broader horizon of future potential\nperceptions. Many existentialist writers have stressed this primordial,\nmetaphysical function of the work of art as a partial revealing that\naims to uncover the totality of Being. This idea is found, most\nnotably, in Simone de Beauvoir’s defence of the metaphysical\nnovel (de Beauvoir 1946, 1965, 73; see also, Merleau-Ponty’s\nreflections in his review of de Beauvoir’s first novel,\n1945c). \n\nSuch an intimate link between metaphysics and art explains why\nexistentialists often place certain artists on a level equal or\nsuperior to the philosophers: Camus with Dostoievski, Marcel with Bach,\nMerleau-Ponty with Cézanne, Sartre and de Beauvoir with Faulkner\nand Kafka. It also partly explains why most existentialist philosophers\nwere equally, or in fact more, active as creative writers. According to\nthem, metaphysical inquiry and\nartistic practice share a fundamental aim: both are ways of revealing to human beings their own\nfreedom and responsibility. \n\nThe metaphysical and ethical dimensions of human freedom are\nintimately related. This is the most significant difference between the\nexistentialists and Husserlian phenomenology: the existentialists link\nthe power to disclose the world to the necessity of human beings to\ndecide who they should be, in terms of the fundamental values directing\na person’s life. The concept of “existence”\ndesignates precisely this ethical dimension of human life. The\nexistentialists argue that, of all the beings existing in the world,\nthe human being is the only one that can decide what it should be;\nindeed, it is forced to do so since it has no fixed nature. As the\nexistentialist motto goes, “man is condemned to be free.”\nHere, freedom is not just independence in the sense of independence\nfrom, but in the sense of being able to decide who and what\none should be. This ethical dimension of freedom as the power of\nself-determination (which also entails the duty to use it) explains the\ncentral place of the notion of “ engagement (commitment).” Before it\ndesignates any necessity to choose in particular situations,\n“engagement” refers to the fundamental position of the\nhuman individual, whose very being consists in having to make use of\nits freedom. On the existentialists’ outlook, the only positive\nfeature of “human reality,” strictly speaking, is\nresponsibility towards others and towards oneself (and, for the\nChristian existentialists, towards God). Many human beings refuse\nthis burden and flee from their ontological responsibility by accepting\npre-given roles. This is what Sartre’s “bad faith”\nand Marcel’s “functional man” designate. \n\nWhat is the link between the metaphysical and the ethical dimensions\nof human freedom, and how does this latter concern aesthetics? \n\nLet us begin with the first part of the question. We will first\napproach it by using a mode of argument typical of phenomenology. Many\nexistentialists insist that the ways in which a human consciousness\n“intends” the world (that is, imposes a certain order and\nregularity in external phenomena) is intrinsically dependent on the\nvalues the person has set for herself. A mountain climber views a\nmountain in a way radically different from an intellectual who has\ndevoted his or her life to books. The difference in their perspectives\nrelates to the deep projects of selves that distinguish these two\npersons. In other words, behind every perception there is a value\ninfluencing the perception in advance and thus ultimately determining\nits precise content. On a deeper, ontological level, the experience\nthat there is something at all, the experience of being, cannot be\nconceived if there is not a desire for it (an “ontological\nexigency” says Marcel). The very capacity of human beings to\nconceive something in the world at all is premised on their capacity to\nposit values (Sartre 1943a; Marcel 1960a, for the religious\nperspective). \n\nIf that is true, however, then every “revelation” of the\nworld in the first, metaphysical sense also entails a revelation of the\nfundamental ethical (or, as the existentialists preferred, existential)\nproject underpinning this perception. This answers, then, the second\npart of the question regarding the relation between the work of art and\nthe ethical aspect of freedom. For the existentialists, as we saw, the\nwork of art brings to a higher level of reflexivity and consistency the\ninnate capacity of human beings to disclose the world. However, since\nthis capacity is itself rooted in the ethical or religious nature of\nhuman beings, the work of art plays a central role in conveying a more\nacute sense of ethical responsibility. It follows that there is an\nintimate link between art and engagement: every aesthetic ordering of\nthe world brings with it a conception of human freedom and suggests\nways to use it. \n\nHence, Sartre’s definition of the literary work, which applies\nbroadly to all works of art: “… an imaginary presentation\nof the world inasmuch as it requires human freedom” (1948a, 45).\nIn other words, the artwork serves the purpose of “making us feel\nessential in relation to the world.” The work of art presents the\nworld not just in the sense that it reveals aspects of it, but also in\nthe sense that it calls for human involvement, notably in collective\naction (or, for Marcel, ‘communion’) (Goldthorpe 1992). \n\nThis definition of the artwork remains ambiguous inasmuch as it does\nnot specify whose freedom is required. A number of features can be\ndelineated as a result, depending on whose freedom is emphasised in\neach case. \n\nThe freedom required by the world is first of all that of the\nartist. Every artwork reveals a fundamental, existential attitude\ntowards the world, and is the expression of an existential choice. We\nwill return to the fundamental notion of expression below, but we can\nalready note that putting existential weight on every act of disclosure\nleads directly to the conclusion that artistic practice is intimately\nlinked to ethical and political choices. \n\nHowever, the ‘expressive’ aspect of the artwork, the\nfact that it is the manifestation of a unique subjectivity, is not the\nmost interesting one for the existentialists; from this perspective,\nexistentialist aesthetics is quite distant from romanticism. This is\nbecause existence, freedom and self-determination are, for the\nexistentialists, essentially active and practical notions. The\nexistential choice is not simply a choice of who one should\nbe, in the sense of a choice of personality or character; the theory of\nexistence does not translate into a theory of genius. Rather, the\nemphasis is on the active relationship within the world, and especially\nwith others. Accordingly, one defines who one is by what one\ndoes with one’s freedom in the world, through the ways\nin which one proposes to change the world, notably in relation to other\nhuman agents. When the artist presents the world, whether he or she\nlikes it or not this presentation also proposes to others ways to\nlive in the world and possibly (at least for the most politically\nminded authors, such as Sartre, de Beauvoir and Merleau-Ponty) ways to\nchange it. In Sartre’s words, every “imaginary presentation\nof the world” is an act of “a” freedom speaking to\n“other” freedoms about possible ways of engaging freedom in\nthe world. Extending Sartre’s definition of the novel, then, we\ncould say that every artwork is an “appeal” (Sartre 1948a,\n32). \n\nTherefore the artwork involves a freedom that is not just that of\nthe artist, but also that of the audience. In existentialist language,\nit is freedom considered as ‘engaged,’ that is, irreducibly\ncaught up in engagement and forced to do something about it. Hence,\nSartre offers another definition of the artwork that identifies the\ndifferent poles of the metaphysical power of art: “… the\nwriter has chosen to reveal the world and particularly to reveal man to\nother men so that the latter may assume full responsibility before the\nobject which has thus been laid bare” (Sartre 1948a, 14). \n\nIn their own artistic practice and their work as critics, the\nexistentialists tended to interpret this conception of art’s\nmission (as revelation and appeal) as an argument in favour of\nrepresentational approaches, and against formalistic and puristic\napproaches. They were generally sceptical of ‘autotelic’\nconceptions of the artwork that view it as a self-contained object\nanswerable only to its own formal rules. In this respect, again, they\ndiffer from some modernist views. Indeed, this insistence on the\nrepresentative dimension of art might appear old-fashioned, inasmuch as\nthe more modern insistence on the autonomy of the artwork has marked\nmost late 19th century aesthetic projects and their\n20th century descendants. The existentialists’\ninsistence on the intrinsic ethical and political significance of the\nartwork further distances them from these other aesthetic\napproaches. \n\nSo far we have only considered the subjective side of the link\nbetween human revelation of the world and the world itself.\nExistentialism, however, also emphasizes the objective side of the\nlink; that is, the world itself as object of perception and knowledge,\nand as the context in which human action takes place. Here, there are\nsome notable differences between ‘optimistic’ and\n‘tragic’ conceptions of the world in terms of our human\nendeavours. \n\nThe ‘optimistic’ ontologies, like those of Marcel or\nMerleau-Ponty, see the world as being on the whole a welcoming place\nfor human knowledge and action. Marcel, despite his critical analyses\nof what he sees as the ills of modern society, is the most optimistic\nof all, mainly due to the theological grounding of his ontology.\nUltimately there is no gap for him between the yearning for full\nparticipation in the world (including in God) and the world itself,\nsince we owe our very existence and capacity for participation to the\nultimate origin of this world. As he writes in his diary:\n“Knowledge is within being, enfolded by it” (1935, 115).\nAlthough Merleau-Ponty does not share this theological conviction, he\nagrees with Marcel on a crucial point: our incarnation in the world\nthrough our bodies is the fundamental beginning of our learning to\ninhabit the world meaningfully. As a result of our being both in and of\nthe world through our bodies, Merleau-Ponty believes that on the whole\nour presentations of the world reveal objective features of it. \n\nThe ‘tragic’ ontologies of Sartre, de Beauvoir and\nCamus, on the other hand, insist on the inhospitality of the world\ntowards human endeavours insofar as the world is mostly reticent to our\nattempts at introducing meaning and unity into it. For Camus, the\n‘absurd’ mainly designates this resistance of the world to our\nendeavours. Whilst we crave for sense and harmony, the world has\nnothing to offer but chaos and a random play of blind forces. All our\nefforts to impose order and sense upon a world that can ultimately\naccommodate neither are therefore doomed to fail. The absurd, then,\ndenominates both the most fundamental state of the world and the\nabsurdity of human attempts at overcoming this basic fact. \n\nHowever, whilst Camus’ ‘absurd’ names the\nessentially tragic state of humanity, it is counterbalanced by his awe\ntowards the indifferent majesty of Nature. For Camus, one of the ways\nof liberating oneself from the illusion of meaning and unity is to open\nup to the beauty of Nature and partake in it, abandoning oneself in\nprivileged moments of hedonistic communion with wild environments, such\nas the rugged Algerian landscape or the Mediterranean, or in eroticism\n(1938a; see the moments of happiness in The Outsider, for\nexample, 1942a, 23–24, 116–117). \n\nSartre, on the other hand, insists on the “disgusting”,\n“nauseating” aspect of a world reticent to meaning, order\nand beauty. His first novel, Nausea, painstakingly chronicles\nthis ontological disgust towards the strangeness of the world. A\nproffered hand becomes “a big white worm,” a glass of beer\na hostile partner whose “gaze” the hero attempts to avoid\nfor half an hour; a pebble on the beach reveals the\n“nausea” that is communicated from the world “through\nthe hands.” Even here, however, aesthetic experiences trigger\nsome exceptional moments in which the hero manages to escape\nontological ‘nausea’. This occurs, for example, when the\nnovel’s main character suddenly hears a jazz song in a\ncafé, which, like a “band of steel,” points to a\ndifferent time beyond the drudgery of the everyday (Sartre 1938,\n21–23). \n\nMany of the existentialists’ literary creations attempt to\ndescribe the entanglements of human freedom in these fundamental\nontological features of the world. Admittedly, this applies to some\nexistentialist authors more than others. For instance, Marcel’s\nplays explore the difficulties that modern individuals encounter in\nresponding to the appeal of transcendence, and in giving in to faith\nand hope. But these obstacles arise mainly from social institutions\n(notably around marriage) and historical events (the tragic\ncircumstances of the 20th century and what Marcel sees as\nthe dangerous objectivism of modern society). Similarly, de\nBeauvoir’s novels tend to portray individuals seeking their true\nselves beyond the strictures of social morality. In contrast, a great\npart of Camus’ and Sartre’s literary work is dedicated to\ndescribing the difficulties that people face when trying to find their\nplace, not just in their social, but also in their natural and material\nenvironments. As we have noted, some of the best-known passages in\ntheir literary writings also describe moments in which the\nobtrusiveness of the world is overcome, yielding fleeting yet sublime\nexperiences of sensuous communion with nature and others. \n\nSartre drew some particularly interesting conclusions from the\ndefinition of the functions of art on the basis of an existentialist\nmetaphysics. These conclusions relate to what, in contemporary\ndiscussions, is called the ‘ontology’ of the artwork: the\ntype of reality of the artwork’s different elements and their\ninternal relations. Mikel Dufrenne has most thoroughly pursued this\nontological approach. \n\nSartre’s early texts on the imagination already provided\nsignificant insights in that regard (in particular, see\nDufrenne’s lengthy discussions of them in his The\nPhenomenology of Aesthetic Experience, 1973). The freedom that\ncharacterises human subjectivity is manifested most vividly in a\nspecific type of intentionality: the imagining of an object.\nImagination exemplifies the power of human consciousness because it is\na type of intentionality that posits in the same act both the existence\nof the object and its inexistence, since it “intends” it\nprecisely as a virtual object. In imagination, the object is indeed\nintended by consciousness, but “as absent”, as\n“containing a certain part of nothingness” inasmuch as it\nis posited as not existing here and now (Sartre 1940). This\ndistinguishes it from the type of intentionality involved in\nperception, one of the key aspects of which is precisely the positing\nof its object as existent. \n\nThis emphasis on the ‘derealising’ aspect of the\nconsciousness of an image has important implications for the\nontological status of the artwork. The real, material elements of the\nartwork are, properly speaking, not the actual elements on which the\naesthetic judgement is fixed. These are fixed instead on a virtual\nobject, i.e., the work’s ideal qualities, wherein the work’s\nmeaning, power and beauty are manifested (Sartre 1940, 213; see also\nDufrenne 1973, 3). On this account, the material aspects of the artwork\nare “occasions” for the manifestation of the ideal aspects.\nSartre insists that one should reject any suspicion of dualism here:\n“There is no realisation of the imaginary, nor can we speak of\nits objectification,” (ibid.) as though a prior mental\nrepresentation had been “objectified” and realised in the\nactual artwork. Rather, the “real” artwork has two sides: a\nreal and an “unreal” (irréel, virtual, or\nideal) side. These two are, however, indistinguishable. “The\npainting should then be conceived as a material thing visited from time\nto time by an unreal which is precisely the painted object”\n(ibid; see Dufrenne 1973, 3–18). The real, says Sartre, is the\nanalogue of the ideal. Merleau-Ponty puts it in similar terms,\nat first in terms of sense and non-sense, and later on in terms of the\nvisible and the invisible: the ideal content of the artwork is\n“in transparency behind the sensible or in the heart of the\nsensible.” It “doubles up the lights and sounds from\nbeneath, is their other side or their depth” (Merleau-Ponty\n1964a, 150–151, but already in 1945a, 182–183). \n\nThis general “negative” dimension of the artwork (the\nfact that as an ideal object it is not reducible to the materiality\nthat carries it) applies also to each of the artwork’s elements\nand their relations (the colours and shapes in a painting, the words\nand sentences in a novel, and so on). Existentialist\naesthetics generally insists on the unity that artistic expression\nbrings to the world. As a consequence of this emphasis on organic\nunity, it seems to propound a rather conventional image of the\naesthetic qualities of the artwork (see, for example, from a\ntheologically informed perspective, Marcel’s discussion of the\nsymphony and the fugue as examples of self-enclosed\n“perfection” [1960b, 53–54]). \n\nHowever, Sartre’s analyses of the relationship between the\nartwork’s elements shows that the insistence on unity as a\ncriterion of artistic beauty is perhaps not as banal as it might sound.\nSartre’s pre-war texts on the imagination are especially\ninformative on this topic. In them, Sartre shows the substantial\nrelationship between the power of human consciousness to\n“nihilate” the world (to overlook some of its aspects and\nemphasise others on the basis of an existential set of values) and the\ninternal coherence of the artwork: \n\nThis implies that the consistency of the existential project, from\nwhich the world is revealed in a special way, also commands the\nconsistency of the artwork. But the quote above also indicates the\nrelation between the different elements that make up the overall\ncomposition: in the end, every particular material element that\ncontributes to the general composition is related to the others through\na relation of negativity. \n\nThe theory of meaning that underpins this view of the\nartwork’s structure thus seems to anticipate a Saussurean\ndefinition of language. Famously, Saussure analysed the functioning of\nlanguage as a ‘diacritical’ system in which each sign owes\nits signification not to a substantial, one-to-one relation between\nword and referent, but rather to its place within the overall\nlinguistic system. Basically, a sign means what it means on the basis\nof ‘not being’ any of the other signs. ‘Dog’\nmeans what it does because the signifier (the material sound) and the\nsignified (the intended meaning) differs from all others, and\nespecially the proximate ones: ‘log’, ‘fog’,\n‘god’, and so on; ‘wolf’, ‘cat’,\nand so on. \n\nIn the same manner, the existentialist philosophers who dedicated\nthe most attention to the articulation of meaning (Sartre and\nMerleau-Ponty) insist on the essentially diacritical essence of the\naesthetic element in a given composition: an element has aesthetic\nsignificance on the basis of its relation to the other elements, rather\nthan owing to any substantial meaning of its own. It follows that, for\nexample, in a painting the pleasure derived from a particular colour in\nisolation from the rest of the work is not ‘aesthetic’ in\nthe strong sense but only in a lower sense: as a pleasure for the\nsenses only. This also implies that often the meaning and aesthetic\npower of a composition (a text, a painting and so on) rests just as\nmuch on what is not said or not shown; what lies in-between the\nelements of the composition, rather than on the elements explicitly\nshown. The existentialists all insist that meaning is largely to be\nfound in a certain form of silence. In the case of a\nnovel: \n\nThis means that the different elements of the artwork should not be\napproached separately or in their immediate reality, but in terms of\nhow they function organically, systematically and negatively. The\ncolours in a painting, and the choice of words and the rhythm of\nsentences in a novel are all but traces, ellipses, elisions, and\ncaesuras that suggest in the negative, just as much as the elements\npositively indicate the contours of a certain perspective onto the\nworld. \n\nThe emphasis on the capacity of human consciousness to\n‘derealise’ the world amounts to a defence of the creative\nfreedom of the artist. The artwork is the most striking example of the\npower of human consciousness to turn towards the world in such a way\nthat it takes in from it certain elements and blanks out others, in\naccordance to a fundamental existential project. Artistic practice is\none of the most eminent demonstrations of human freedom because it\nshows how human practice can recreate (Camus, Sartre, de Beauvoir,\nMerleau-Ponty) or recover (Marcel) a new, more ordered world out of the\ngiven world. Camus offers a concise formulation for a central principle\nof existentialist aesthetics: “To write is already to\nchoose” (Camus 1951, 271). \n\nThe existentialist philosophers did not refrain from formulating\ninternal (aesthetic) and external (ethical and political) constraints\nto artistic practice, but their aesthetics fundamentally proclaims the\nradical freedom of the artist, also seeing in it the privileged\nexemplar of human freedom in general. Camus, for example, makes\nartistic activity, the choice of becoming an artist, one of the\nprivileged modes for humans to deal with the absurd (Camus 1942b,\n86–88). Many existentialist texts dedicated to aesthetic matters\nemphasise the ‘mystery’ of creativity, the amazing\n‘solution’ that an artwork represents, the ‘miracle\nof expression’ that elicits admiration from the audience and the\nphilosopher. \n\nBut radical freedom is ambiguous, as it must work with a\nfacticity (a term the existentialists adopted from Heidegger),\nviz., a set of given factors (physical, social and so on) that it has\nnot created. In the case of the artist, the ambiguity resides already\nin the decision and the passion to become an artist. Although a set of\ngenetic and social preconditions influences that decision, it is\nequally the product of an individual decision in that specific\nsituation. \n\nThe work of art is caught up in the same ambiguity. On the one hand,\nit is the free creation of an unconstrained person, a purely\nidiosyncratic expression of an individuality. On the other, it is\nconstrained by various factors that exert influence on its very\nstructure: the audience, the historical period that will receive the\nwork, the material elements that make up the artwork, and in\nparticular, the already signifying elements that the artist reuses and\nrecomposes to create a new work. \n\nMerleau-Ponty’s writings of the 1950s advance an original\nexistentialist theory of expression that addresses this latter\ndimension in particular. It can be argued that this theory of\nexpression captures and makes explicit thoughts that a number of other\nexistentialist writers shared on these questions. \n\nIn The Prose of the World (1964), Merleau-Ponty explored the emergence and logic of meaning and meaning-giving activity, of\nsignification and expression, using the example of literary works\n(particularly the novel). Stendhal provided him with a paradigmatic\ncase study. Such an attempt to draw deep philosophical conclusions from\nartworks is typical of existentialist practice. \n\nFirstly, the literary work can help us understand the phenomenon of\nmeaning and meaning-giving by seeing the writer as creating new\nmeanings, indeed a new language (a Joycean version of English, a\nFlaubertian French, and so on) by recomposing a language he or she\nshares with an entire historical community. This is a truly ambiguous\naspect that can be taken (on one hand) as the proof of the mystery of\nexpression, evidence of a creative power required to make possible the\nemergence of the new out of the old, while (on the other hand) this new\nis possible only on the basis of the already-instituted. But this\ninitial remark points to a much deeper level; here, it is painting that\noffers the most precious indications. In discussing André\nMalraux’s seminal essays on the history of painting (Malraux\n1953), Merleau-Ponty articulated a detailed existentialist theory of\nmeaning where the artwork plays the central role. The Husserlian\nmetaphor of ‘perspective’ is appropriated and transformed\ninto a general formula for both the power of perception and the\nmetaphysical condition of the human being. \n\nIntentionality can be said to coincide with the establishment of a\nperspective in a world where there is, prior to human presence, none.\nFor reality to appear in all its different qualities and structures,\nhuman consciousness is required. What distinguishes the artist from\nother language-users is the consistency and coherence of a specific\noutlook onto the world. Such coherent perspective introduces an element\nof regularity and structure in the chaos of the world. It introduces\ndirections: a high and a low, a right and a left. That is, it\nintroduces sense. \n\nThis link between artistic expression and meaning leads to a major\nre-evaluation of the notion of style. Rather than a superficial way of\nformulating meanings that remain unchanged by their expression, style\nin this context now indicates a fundamental perspective from which the\nworld can be approached; it indicates a perspective that would not have\nexisted prior to the expressive act. It designates an\n“irreplaceable deviation” that is possible only from a\nspecific way of being-in-the-world, and which is subsequently\nrecaptured in symbolic language, whether the linguistic form of\nliterature, or the “indirect language” of painting. Style\nis a coherent perspective, a “coherent deformation,” a way\nof being-in-the-world and of approaching the world from a certain\nangle. On this model, style does not express pre-existing meaning, but\ncreates it. Camus, in the pages of The Rebel devoted to the\naesthetic dimensions of rebellion, developed a concomitant conception\nof artistic expression: \n\nThis in turn gives a more specific meaning to the relation of the\nnew and the old in expression. True expression (whether the first\ngenuine self-expression of the learning speaker, a new scientific\nmeaning, or true artistic achievement) is both totally idiosyncratic,\nand a re-composition of shared elements; it transforms the old. For\ntrue expression to occur, two forms of speech are thus required:\n“speaking speech” and “spoken speech”\n(Merleau-Ponty, 1945a, 197). This explains the puzzling fact that a\ntrue expression must be at once a true creation, something unheard of,\nand yet can be understood only if the language it uses (natural,\nscientific or artistic) is known. In other words, expression is always\nalso a form of communication between one “speaker” and the\ncommunity of speakers. Assuming that Merleau-Ponty’s analyses are\nrepresentative of views that were shared by the other existentialist\nwriters (see Sartre, 1948a, 56, in which the germane concept of\n“mediation” is used; “communication” is the\ncentral notion in Marcel’s philosophy of theatre), we can note\nthat once again existentialist aesthetics seems at odds with many\nmodern artistic currents, which have insisted on drawing a radical\ndistinction between the functions and uses of artistic and everyday\nlanguages. For example, a major poet and theorist of literature like\nPaul Valéry was inspired by Mallarmé’s famous\ncharacterisation of poetry as “giving a purer sense to the words\nof the tribe.” We can also mention surrealist and expressionist\npainters and film directors who sought to break through everyday\nimagery in order to transfigure reality. \n\nArtistic communication also has a certain capacity to transcend the\nages and cut across languages. Beyond the historical situatedness of\nartistic communication (the fact that an artistic language re-uses the\nlanguage of its contemporaries), the task of giving sense on the basis\nof being-in-the-world is part of the metaphysical condition of being\nhuman, and so applicable to all humans throughout history. As a result,\nconsidering that art is a ‘higher degree’ of communication,\nthe work of art is not just a striking example of genuine expression,\nbut also exemplifies the fact that every act of meaning is open to the\npast and the future of other human acts of expression. \n\nAt this point, we can note a tension within the aesthetics of many\nexistentialist writers (a tension that is quite acute in Sartre’s\nwork) between the relative trans-historical meaningfulness of artworks\nand their utter situatedness: artworks offer an image of\nengaged freedom in particular situations that are truly accessible only\nto its contemporaries (Sartre 1948a, 50–52). Merleau-Ponty, for his\npart, insists on the underlying unity of the history of painting, which\nallows us to find traces and echoes of past painters in modern ones.\nThe history of painting is a microcosmic image of history, and a\ntestament to the capacity of present generations to understand the\nactions and passions of the past (Merleau-Ponty 1964b, 72).\nMerleau-Ponty’s vision of the possibility of empathy across the\nages does not deny the historical relativity of sense formations. It\nshows how, despite the spatiotemporal distance that separates\nhistorical contexts, humans can still understand each other, historians\ncan understand previous times, anthropologists other peoples, and we\ncan somehow access some of the meanings of past artistic practices. The\nexpressive achievements of other peoples are both radically alien, and\nyet the result of expressive gestures that are commensurable to ours,\ninasmuch as they are the product of a common human capacity, viz., the\ncapacity to transcend the natural world and recreate it as a meaningful\nand ordered universe. \n\nA central, shared assumption of existentialist aesthetics, beyond\nthe stark religious and political differences of the existentialists,\nis the essential ambiguity of the human condition: I am radically free\nas consciousness, yet radically determined by my facticity, the\nphysical, social and other circumstances in which my consciousness\ncomes to the world. On this particular point Heidegger’s\nexistential analytic is a shared reference that brings\ntogether otherwise diverse (or, indeed, antagonistic) thinkers. An\nimportant implication of the emphasis on human facticity is that it\nforges a vital link between philosophy and the arts, which from this\nperspective similarly aim to explore the metaphysical ambiguity of the\nhuman\ncondition. \n\nThis grants the artist a special status from at least two\nstandpoints: \n\n1) Artistic activity as an existential choice is a privileged mode\nof assuming and realising the paradoxical nature of being human. In\nCamus’ words, artistic activity is one of the key attitudes to\nface the absurd. Camus’ celebration of art in The Myth of\nSysiphus (1942b, 127), which crowns artistic expression as the\nultimate form of “joy,” would ring true for the other\nexistentialists despite their noted differences on the question of the\nabsurd. Indeed, many other existentialist writers made similar\nstatements reflecting their own life choices, in particular their\ndecision to pursue a philosophical and literary career. The personal\ndimension that can be found in many existentialist writings grants\nthese texts a special status in the history of philosophy, since it\nblurs a boundary that has been essential to the definition of the genre\nof philosophical writing, viz., the boundary between the theoretical\nand the biographical, the personal and the general. Marcel’s\n“metaphysical diary” is a good case in point. More than\njust an original form of philosophical analysis, the diary illustrates\nMarcel’s own conception of the true self as a gradual awakening\nto the “appeal” of being through the combined practices of\nontological inquiry, artistic creation and personal engagement. Sartre\nalso wrote an autobiographical account of his discovery of the world of\nwords, Les Mots, without doubt one of his masterpieces. The\nsame can be said of Camus’ last narrative text, La\nChute, which mixes autobiography with an ironical account of his\nphilosophy. \n\nBeyond their own personal practice, the existentialists also find\nphilosophical significance in the lives of great artists, and are\ninterested in the moment they chose to become artists and how this\nprimordial choice unfolded over the course of their lives. Artists\nprovide paradigmatic case studies for the paradoxes of\n“existence” and “expression” (Sartre 1947b,\n1971). Indeed, this is true not just of writers and painters but also\nof actors. For Camus, in fact, actors are those “who draw the\nbest conclusion” from the metaphysical truth of human existence\n(1942b, 107). \n\n2) The artist’s activity is also deeply significant in terms\nof its power of articulating a coherent world. Every person has to make\nexistential choices and has a need for expression, but artists present\nparticularly pure and powerful exemplars of these facets of human\nexistence. Their achievements are worthy of admiration because they\ninvolve the creation of virtual worlds. Every consciousness, every\nbeing-in-the-world is expressive, but only rarely is this expression\ntruly new. Most of the time, human expression is only the\nrepetition of instituted meanings, as in the quasi-automatic use of\nspoken language. Only the great artists show the power of expression in\nits purity, its newness and coherence. To recreate a virtual world that\ncan do justice to the complexity of the real world is an almost\n“miraculous” fact, as Merleau-Ponty says of Cézanne.\nAs we can see, the existentialists are no longer that far from the\nromantics in what respects their emphasis on genius. \n\nSince the expressive world of a genuine artist is a new perspective\nonto the world that is identical with the artist’s whole\nidiosyncratic mode of being-in-the-world, there will be a deep,\nunderlying continuity in his or her work. The communication that the\nwork of art establishes across time and space operates, first and\nforemost, within the oeuvre itself, with themes and stylistic\ntraits echoing each other throughout it (Camus 1942b, 102–103;\nMerleau-Ponty 1964b, 67). But there is an inherent fatalism in artistic\nactivity. Expressive activity can only ever be an attempt at\nexpression, and it is structurally doomed to fail because there is too\nmuch to reveal in the world. The means of expression are finite, and\nthey operate in a twisted manner, just as much through direct\ndesignation as through ellipse and allusion. This leads Camus to\nconclude that creative activity, like all free activities, is in the\nend only another absurd attempt at dealing with the absurdity of human\nlife (1942b, 130). \n\nAn essential ambiguity characterises\nalso the experience of the audience. On the one hand, the genuine\nartist creates a new virtual world that expresses a coherent,\nidiosyncratic perspective on the world shared by all. When the audience\nmeets the artwork successfully, the spectators suddenly change their\nown mode of perception and have to adopt a new perspective. To use a\nlinguistic metaphor, the tired, instituted language of everyday\ncommunication (‘spoken’ or sedimented language) is\nrejuvenated by a ‘speaking’ language, a true expression\nthat imposes itself on the audience (be it the reader or the\nspectator). Therefore, the artwork, in a sense, creates its own\naudience (Merleau-Ponty 1964b, 86, and also 12-13; see also Dufrenne,\n1973, 63–71). \n\nNevertheless there is also an active side to artistic enjoyment, as\nin reading, for example. Without the spectator’s contemplation,\nor the reader’s reading, the artwork’s expression remains\npurely subjective. It becomes objective, manifesting its sense in\nactuality, only through the symbolic consumption of the audience. This\nact, however, is not passive: it mobilises the audience’s own\npower of expression and imagination. Reading, watching, or listening\nare, as Sartre puts it, “directed creations”: “To\nwrite is to make an appeal to the readers that they lead into objective\nexistence the revelation which I (the artist) have undertaken by means\nof language” (Sartre 1948a, 32; Dufrenne 1973, 47–60).\nMarcel’s conception of the theatre as an experience of\n‘communion’ also implies this active participation of the\naudience. \n\nThe ambiguity of aesthetic experience is linked directly to the\nabove mentioned theory of the negativity of the expressive means. The\nwork of art functions when it is able to define a coherent perspective\nonto the world, yet this perspective is mainly defined in the negative,\nas the trace of iterable and consistent attitudes in the world.\nTherefore, the spectator is required to translate the traces, caesuras\nand elisions that negatively defined the new world of expression into\npositive traits: “… the imagination of the\nspectator has not only a regulative function but a constitutive one. It\ndoes not play: it is called upon to recompose the beautiful object\nbeyond the traces left by the artist” (Sartre 1948a, 33). \n\nA metaphor Sartre and Merleau-Ponty employ frequently is that of the\ntwo sides of the artwork, comparable to the two sides of a mirror. The\nartist only sees his or her own work from the inside; he or she\nlives the artwork in a sense, since the expressive power is\nrooted in an idiosyncratic form of being-in-the-world. For the work to\nbecome an objective entity with a manifest meaning, the understanding\nand imagination of the audience needs to reconstruct the meaningful\nsilence in between the traces. And this understanding cannot be\npassive, since the truly expressive meaning involves a new form of\nbeing-in-the-world. The spectator or reader is called upon to\neffectuate the same original mode of being-in-the-world: “If he\nis a writer, that is, if he knows how to find the ellipses, elisions\nand caesuras of conduct, the reader will respond to his appeal and meet\nhim at the centre of the imaginary world he animates and rules”\n(Merleau-Ponty 1964b, 89). Once again, a key feature of aesthetic\nexperience is communication, the ‘echo’ that a subjective\nattitude to the world finds in others. \n\nThis vision of the artwork as a privileged medium of expression and\ncommunication (in the substantive, metaphysical senses given to these\nwords in existentialist philosophy) leads to a relatively coherent\napproach to the different art forms, something like a loose\nexistentialist ‘system of the arts.’ A system of the arts\nexplains not just what art is in essence, seeking a definition of art\nand determining its social, political or philosophical functions. It\nalso ranks the arts in a hierarchy, giving an account of how each form\nuses specific material and expressive means to fulfil those functions.\nIn the end, one art-form in particular is usually regarded as\nprivileged, exemplary of the mode of fulfilling the mission of art. All\nclassical philosophical aesthetics, from Kant and his immediate\nfollowers to Alain, have presented their own, more or less developed\n“système des beaux-arts” (Alain 1920,\nNatanson 1968). \n\nFor most of the existentialists, theatre is the prime art form,\ni.e., the one that best allows the artist to use his or her freedom to\ncreate a virtual world that simultaneously appeals to the\naudience’s own freedom (regardless of how we define that freedom,\ntheologically or politically). For Camus, de Beauvoir, Marcel and\nSartre, philosophical activity and recognition as playwrights were\nintimately linked (Goldthorpe 1986). Marcel defined himself as\n“philosophe-dramaturge” (philosopher-dramatist,\nsee Lazaron 1978), to insist on what was, for him, an indissoluble\nunity between philosophical meditation and playwriting. Indeed, it is\nwell worth noting that, apart from de Beauvoir (whose single attempt at\nwriting for the theatre was not very successful [see de Beauvoir 1945b\nand 1962, 672–673]), they were all equally famous as playwrights and as\nphilosophers in their time. \n\nArguably, Sartre’s theoretical reflections on the theatre of\nhis time have remained the most widely read today. In describing\nwhat were for him the defining features of existentialist theatre,\nSartre also aimed to identify some of the main aspects of theatre\nitself. As these features are grounded in his theory of freedom,\ntheatre is, for Sartre, the art par excellence. \n\nThe identification of art in general with the theatre is already\nevident in the fact that the same word – ‘situation’\n– simultaneously encapsulates the metaphysical position of the human\nbeing-in-the-world, and summarises theatre’s core aesthetic\nelement (Sartre 1976, 35). The two ‘enemies’ in French\nexistentialism, Sartre and Marcel, agree on the centrality of the\nconcept of ‘situation.’ What is literature? had\ndefined the mission of literature as the attempt “to reveal the\nworld and particularly to reveal man to other men so that the latter\nmay assume full responsibility before the object which has been thus\nlaid bare” (Sartre 1948a, 14). Centred as it is on the praxis of\nreal human beings confronted with the contradictions of concrete\nsituations, theatre is the best medium to present in purified form the\ntragic responsibility of human freedom, the fact that “we are\ncondemned to be free” in a world inhospitable to our\nprojects. \n\nThis emphasis on action and situation leads to a series of highly\nprescriptive rules, as we see in the criteria that Sartre used in\nhis critical reviews of contemporary theatre writing and production. To rise\nto the task of achieving a “theatre of situations,” writing\nand production must resist the temptation of focusing on the\ncharacters; they need to present archetypical situations in\nwhich human freedom is most radically at stake, notably through\ndifferent types of universal ‘conflicts of rights.’ Theatre\nneeds to avoid psychology and concentrate on action (in clear contrast\nto Marcel’s theatre, which is mainly concerned with staging\nconflicts of inner conscience); it must be wary of a realistic approach\nthat might take the focus away from the violence of the conflicts. For\nthe same reason, the duration of the play and the number of the\ncharacters must be reduced. The stage must be empty and the language\nmust be direct but non-realistic, compressing the acuteness of the\nsituation as powerfully as possible. In short, existentialist theatre\nexplicitly intends to return to a Greek conception, attempting to\npresent contemporary “myths” in a world without gods\n(Sartre 1976). \n\nBut the situations, precisely, are situated: they always take place\nin specific social and political contexts. The myths that the theatre\npresents, therefore, have two temporal dimensions: 1) Because they are\nabout distinguishing features of human ‘being,’ they have,\nlike Greek and Corneillian tragedy, a transhistorical appeal; they are\nplays about human freedom in general. This explains the classical bent\nof many existentialist plays. Thus, it makes perfect sense to stage the\nconundrums of modern, absurd freedom through the figure of Caligula, as\nCamus does in one of his most famous plays. 2) The situation is always\na specific one, particularly a specific social and political\ncircumstance, with its specific conflict of rights. In the years\nfollowing the Second World War, the conflict of rights is widely\nunderstood as the conflict between liberal rights and the socialist\nideal. All the existentialists agreed on this, with the notable\nexception of Marcel. The ‘communist question’ (of whether\nto embrace the proposed communist solution to the problems facing the\nworld in 1948—the date of publication of What is\nLiterature?) was one of the most urgent political questions for\nthem. More generally, we can mention the question of the value of\nindividual engagement as opposed to engagement in a collective movement\n(a question at the centre of Malraux’s novels, notably his\nHuman Condition, which approaches the existentialist\naesthetic), and the place of individual freedom in an age of conflict\nbetween global forces. These questions were at the forefront of\nexistentialist concerns when they devised their aesthetics, and wrote\ntheir plays and novels. \n\nWe have noted the similarity between Sartre and Marcel regarding\ntheir emphasis on the notion of situation. Although Sartre noted other\nfeatures of existentialist theatre that formally apply to\nMarcel’s plays, there are stark differences in their approach to\nplaywriting. Whereas for Sartre the ultimate justification of theatre\nis political, for Marcel it is metaphysical: it is a question of\nfinding salvation and hope, and safeguarding the possibility of faith.\nYet, like Sartre’s, Marcel’s plays staged the specific\nproblems of the age as he saw them, e.g., how the rise of technology\nbrings about a reductive attitude to the world and especially to other\nhuman beings, the atrocities of the century, and the moral\ndisorientation of modern individuals. Despite his metaphysical\noptimism, Marcel’s theatre shares with other existentialist plays\na patently sombre mood. He wants to depict “the drama of the soul\nin exile, of the soul that suffers from its lack of communion with\nitself and with others” (Preface to Troisfontaines 1953,\n35). Marcel’s plays consistently portray a creeping feeling of\nabsurdity that befalls the main characters. It is a forgotten fact that\nMarcel wrote more plays than any of the other existentialists. \n\nThe novel comes very close to theatre as the art-form of choice for\nthe existentialists. For most existentialists, the ultimate models were\nnot philosophers, but contemporary novelists; two of whom were\nespecially paradigmatic, viz., Dostoievsky and Kafka. Sartre, de\nBeauvoir and Camus saw themselves in equal measure as writers of\nfiction and as philosophers. They engaged with each other’s\nfictional work at least as much, if not more, than with their\ntheoretical one (Camus 1938b, 1939, Sartre 1943b). Indeed, as already\nnoted, fiction and autobiographical writings were direct applications\nof their philosophical visions. “To think is to create a\nworld,” writes Camus, showing the deep identity between\nphilosophical and fictional creation (Camus 1942b, 87–91). The reason\nis the same as with theatre: narrative fiction, focused on a series of\n‘situations’ in which the fundamental existential choices\nfacing human beings can be carefully staged, is a powerful mode of\nengaging the free imagination of the reader, and thus of calling him or\nher to action: “What in fact is a novel but a universe in which\naction is endowed with form?” (Camus 1951, 263). The novel is a\nrevelation of the world, notably in its social and political urgency,\nby a freedom for other freedoms. As Merleau-Ponty writes in\n“Metaphysics and the Novel”: “Intellectual works had\nalways been concerned with establishing a certain attitude toward the\nworld, of which literature and philosophy, like politics, are just\ndifferent expressions; but only now [thanks to existentialist\nphilosophy] has this concern become explicit” (Merleau-Ponty\n1945c, 27; see also Camus 1942b, 92 and 1951, 258–267). \n\nIn existentialist aesthetics, artistic activity and its products\nhave external aims: to reveal the world to others, both in a\nmetaphysical and political sense. As noted, this aesthetic theory\ntherefore conflicts with the notion that the artwork is an end in\nitself, or that style and form are self-justified. Thus, the\nexistentialists were deeply suspicious of some of the main artistic\nmovements of the time, particularly Surrealism, even if some of them\nadmired its rebellious spirit (Camus 1951, 88–100); or, later on, the\nNouveau Roman (Alain Robbe-Grillet, Nathalie Sarraute and\nClaude Simon) and the literature that was developed around the\npost-structuralist journal Tel Quel (de Beauvoir, in Francis\nand Gontier, 226, 233–234). Compared with Dadaism, Surrealism, and the\nliterary avant-gardes that immediately followed the existentialist era,\nexistentialist aesthetics has an outdated, almost conservative air to\nit. It unabashedly calls for a new classicism somewhere between\nformalism and realism (either in its naturalist or socialist versions),\nand beyond romanticism (Camus 1944 and 1951, 268–271), on the grounds\nthat the moral and political dimensions of literature consist not just\nin a rebellion against everyday language and the social-political order\nof the day, but also in the more demanding (yet modest) task of\nproperly naming the world in order to unveil the immense injustice\nreigning in it, while also retrieving its fleeting and inhuman beauty\n(Camus 1951, 272–279). In his prolific work as literary critic, Sartre\nconsistently rejected formalism and “art for art’s\nsake,” even in the case of illustrious French writers such as\nMallarmé or Flaubert. However, it can also be argued that, from\nthe perspective of the relation between politics and arts in the\n20th century, the existentialist demand that art retain a\nstrong connection to everyday reality (so as to fulfil its moral and\npolitical roles) is also completely of its time. \n\nThe condemnation of “art for art’s sake” applies\nto all the arts and has important repercussions for aesthetic critique\nand the conception of style. The existentialists take great pains to\nnote that their rejection of formalism, purism and autotelism in the\narts does not amount to advocating a crude version of realism (Camus\n1951, 268–270; Sartre 1948a, 44). As we have noted already in the case\nof theatre, the classical aspect of existentialist aesthetics impacts\non the choice of stylistic means: “One is not a writer for having\nchosen to say certain things, but for having chosen to say them in a\ncertain way. And to be sure, the style makes the value of the prose.\nBut it should pass unnoticed” (Sartre 1948a, 15). \n\nFurthermore, the existentialist definitions of meaning as\nnegativity, and of expression as ‘coherent distortion’,\nmean that stylistic achievement (the ability to let new sense be\nrevealed) relies as much on the choice of words and syntax as on the\n‘silences’ and omissions that define an expressive\ngesture. \n\nWith their emphasis on action in situations, the existentialists\nhave an uneasy relationship to poetry. Only Camus, following the\nexample of Nietzsche, wrote a number of poems (in his youth writings\nand his notebooks, Camus 1933, 1935–1941). In many passages in Camus,\npoetry has a positive connotation. This connotation, however, refers to\na specific quality of language, viz., the use of vivid images that\nmanage to convey some truth about the human condition, rather than to\nthe merits of poetry as a specific literary form. \n\nFor Sartre, the stance of 19th century novelists who\nengaged in ‘art for art’s sake’ is not too dissimilar\nto the problematic way modern poets approach language. In fact,\nSartre’s studies on two of the major French poets of the\n19th century, Baudelaire and Mallarmé, are tinged\nwith the same disapprobation as his immense study of Flaubert (Sartre\n1947b, 1952b, 1971–72). Modern poetry for Sartre is, in the final\nanalysis, a misguided use of language. It uses language as an end in\nitself, a thing, the same way that a painter uses colour. This ignores\nthe fact that in language the relationship between materiality and\nsignification is the inverse to what is the case in other artistic\nmedia. Language is, for the existentialists, the favoured artistic\nmedium because, as the mode of expression that is most directly a\nmedium of signification, it is the one that best reveals a situation as\nsituation in the strong sense, viz., as a part of the world\nwhere human freedom is directly engaged metaphysically, ethically and\npolitically. Poets, on the other hand, “are men who refuse to\nutilise language. Now, since the quest for truth takes place in and by\nlanguage conceived as a kind of instrument, it is unnecessary to\nimagine that they aim to discern or expound the true. Nor do they dream\nof naming the world” (Sartre 1948a, 5). In their use of language,\nmodern poets seem to overlook and act against the main qualities that\nthe existentialists grant it, namely, its representative and\ncommunicative powers. This explains why poetry remains at the margins\nof the existentialist system of the arts, as a literary genre that is\nnot as eminently philosophical and political as the theatre and the\nnovel. The existentialists are, once again, squarely at odds with the\nsurrealists, who condemned the novel and saw in poetry the real\nartistic medium. \n\nThe existentialists made, however, some notable exceptions. Camus,\nfor example, wrote a vibrant review of the work of René Char\n(Camus 1935–1936), and saw in the work of Francis Ponge an eminent\nillustration of the task of literature in the absurd situation of\npost-war France (Camus 1943). Sartre also dedicated a long and largely\npositive review to the work of Francis Ponge, seeing in it a kind of\nprofane phenomenology (Sartre 1944 in 1947a). This positive assessment\nmight well have rested on a misunderstanding, since Ponge seemed to\nhave had the exact opposite view of language as Sartre, and regarded\npoetry precisely as the form that would best be able to “name the\nworld” and make human freedom face its responsibility. \n\nThe existentialists’ lack of interest in poetry (which, in the\ncase of Sartre especially, turns into outright dismissal) is based on\ntheir view that poets make a misguided use of language. For the same\nreason, the other non-discursive arts attract almost as little interest\nas poetry (however, see Camus 1951, 257). Yet, when they are discussed,\nthey are treated more favourably than poetry, since they do not have\nlanguage as their medium, and this means that the accusation against\npoetry becomes irrelevant. The emphasis on language as the eminent\nmedium for the representation of human freedom reproduces a classical\nargument that is already at the heart of Hegel’s aesthetics (a\nfact that the existentialists are fully aware of [Sartre 1948a, 5]).\nThe implication for the other arts is that they are able to produce and\nconvey ideal contents, meaning and beauty, but that these are never as\ntransparently accessed as in linguistic expression. Rather, the ideal\ncontent in non-linguistic art-forms remains trapped, glued, as it were,\nin the materiality of the artwork: “… it is one thing to\nwork with colour and sound, and another to express oneself by means of\nwords. Notes, colours, and forms are not signs. They refer to nothing\nexterior to themselves. (…) As Merleau-Ponty has pointed out in\nThe Phenomenology of Perception, there is no quality of\nsensation so bare that it is not penetrated with significance. But the\ndim little meaning which dwells within it, a light joy, a timid\nsadness, remains immanent or trembles about like a heat mist; it\nis colour or sound” (Sartre 1948a, 1). \n\nThis seems to introduce some important differences amongst the\nexistentialists, since Merleau-Ponty, for instance, claimed that all\nart forms function like language. But Merleau-Ponty agrees with Sartre\non the important differences between art forms. The Prose of the\nWorld established that there was a single source behind all acts\nof expression, which made them commensurable to language, only to\nacknowledge the specificity of language in a manner similar to\nSartre’s. For example, the “voices” in painting — a\nmetaphor for the ideal content of painting — are ‘voices of\nsilence’ that speak only an ‘indirect language’ (the\ntitles of Malraux’s famous studies on the history of painting).\nThat is to say, they remain attached to their specific materiality,\nmaking the work a self-enclosed world. In Merleau-Ponty’s\nrepeated metaphor, every painter starts the history of painting afresh\n(1960, 309–311) because the same visible world calls for an infinite\nnumber of expressive variations, each singular in its determinate\ncoherence. The history of painting, therefore, is indeed made up of\nconstant echoes and criss-crosses, with each generation revisiting the\nvisual themes and techniques of the past generations, but the\ncommunication amongst the works are haphazard, indirect, and cannot be\naccumulated. There is no progress in the history of painting. In\nlanguage, on the other hand, meanings acquired from the past are\nsedimented in current meanings and allow for the dialectic of spoken\nand speaking speech discussed earlier (Merleau-Ponty 1964b, 97-113).\nThis means that the material of literature carries with it the\nsedimented historical experiences of the lifeworlds it speaks about.\nThere is no progress in literature either, not in a sense comparable to\nscientific progress, but the novel, simply by using the language of the\nlifeworld it arises from, is a direct witness of the broader historical\nnarrative in which it is embedded. As a result, it can portray ethical\nand political situations very powerfully. \n\nPrecisely, the poet’s sin is to treat language as though it\nwere a sound or a note; it is to treat language as a thing and to\nrevere its materiality. This ignores the nature of linguistic\nexpression, in which the signs must be traversed towards their\nsignification. The reverse error is that of Paul Klee, who, according\nto Sartre, uses colour both as sign and as object (1948a, 23). The\nexistentialist system of the arts is ordered according to the Hegelian\nprinciple where arts that involve language rule over the others,\nbecause they best express human freedom. \n\nIn Sartre’s What is Literature? this apparent disdain\nfor the materiality of painting seems at odds with another aesthetic\nprinciple of the existentialists, namely, the capacity of art to\nwitness the obtrusiveness of the world, and, in exceptional moments of\naesthetic communion, its inhuman beauty. Indeed, in a few, smaller\ntexts of Sartre’s (for example, those he wrote for exhibition\nopenings) he seems to return to this aspect of the artwork, which he\nhimself had so powerfully demonstrated in his first novel. However, it\nis true that the existentialists are more interested in the ways in\nwhich human beings sort out the entanglements of their freedom in the\nabsurd world, than in the depiction of the materiality of that world.\nMerleau-Ponty’s texts on the ontological grandeur of\nCézanne’s painting are not representative of existential\naesthetics generally, but reflect only that author’s unique\nperspective on art and ontology. \n\nMusic, which in some classical systems of the arts (in Schopenhauer\nand Nietzsche, for example) is the highest and most metaphysical, also\nreceives an ambiguous treatment in existentialist aesthetics. In\nThe Myth of Sisyphus, for example, Camus seems to be saying\nthat it is the absurd art par excellence because it realises\nin the purest form what all art conscious of the absurd should be\nabout, namely, the “triumph of the flesh” in the absence of\nany ultimate meaning: \n\nMarcel often emphasised the extent to which music had played a\nsignificant role in his philosophical inspiration. He was famous for\nhis improvisations on classical 19th century poems, which\nhis wife noted after the Second World War. We saw earlier that Sartre\nin a famous passage of Nausea had described an encounter with\njazz music in a café as a sublime experience in which the\nbeautiful inner coherence of the musical flow transcended for a moment\nthe nauseating meaninglessness of the material world. And note also de\nBeauvoir’s late enthusiasm for music (in Francis and Gontier\n1979, 67). \n\nDespite these descriptions of music as a privileged meaningful\nexperience in an absurd world, none of the existentialists has\nundertaken any sustained analysis on the relationship between music,\nphilosophy and the existential condition. Camus interprets positively\nthe formality of music, its lack of discursivity and the abstraction of\nits relation to the world of flesh (see also his early essay in Camus\n1935–1936), features that the latter Merleau-Ponty interprets\nnegatively; but, in the end, the existentialist writers do not give\nmusic any detailed consideration. \n\nThe most puzzling aspect about the existentialists’ systems of\nthe arts is their relative lack of interest, in their most famous\nwritings at least, in cinema, the privileged art form of the\n20th century. Of all the arts, this would have been the one\nthat would appear to have truly been able to present\n‘situations.’ \n\nIn the case of Sartre, this is all the more surprising given the\nintimate association of Sartre with cinema at many points in his life.\nSeveral passages in de Beauvoir’s and Sartre’s\nautobiographical writings attest to their shared enthusiasm for the new\nart (Sartre 1964). The profound influence of film on the young Sartre\nis well documented in his early writings, where he demonstrates great\nsensitivity towards the formal and political potentialities of the new\nmedium, in contrast to most of the French intelligentsia of the time\n(Sartre 1924, 1931). Indeed, these early texts credit cinema with\nprecisely the same capacities of expression that are later granted to\ntheatre, such as the capacity to present action, the necessary yet\nambiguous necessity of engagement and the capacity of artistic\nexpression to represent the masses to the masses. Literary criticism\nhas established to what extent Sartre attempted to reproduce in\nliterary form the techniques employed by cinema in the representation\nof time, space and internal states of consciousness, and specifically\nhow such an influence was crucial in his first major work,\nNausea (Johnson 1984). \n\nDuring the war, Sartre was employed as a script writer by a\nproduction company for whom he wrote eight scripts. Two of these were\npublished after the war (Sartre 1947c, 1948b), and two of them were\nfilmed. Most of these scripts provided the material for Sartre’s\nplays and novels when their realisation failed. In 1958, he also wrote\ntwo scripts for films on Freud and Joseph Le Bon. Sartre also wrote\ntwelve articles on film in total, notably a critique of Citizen\nKane in 1945, which inspired a response by André Bazin that\nwas to become one of his most famous essays (Bazin 1947). De Beauvoir\nalso recounts the deep impact that the cinematic experience had on\nSartre’s ontological views. According to her, the cinematic\nrepresentation of human actions hostage to the world’s power of\nresistance was a crucial source of inspiration for his mature ontology,\nnotably for his vision of the absurdity inherent in the world’s\ncontingency (de Beauvoir 1960). \n\nDespite this intimate connection with cinema, the enthusiasm that is\napparent in the early texts receded in the background after his\ndiscovery of phenomenology in 1933, following his study year in Germany\n(de Beauvoir 1962, 231). After that date, cinema no longer features as\nan important art form in his aesthetic writings. Indeed, in a 1958\nconference, Sartre explicitly ranks theatre above cinema because it\n“has more freedom,” as “a film depicts men who are in\nthe world and are conditioned by it,” whereas “theatre\npresents action by a man on the stage to men in the audience, and,\nthrough this action, both the world he lives in and the performer of\nthe action” (Sartre 1976, 60–61). In other words, theatre is the\ntrue art of freedom in situations. Similarly, in later years, de\nBeauvoir explicitly ranked the novel over cinema for its capacity to\n“materialise the presence of human beings to human beings”\n(de Beauvoir quoted in Francis and Gontier 1979, 200). As with the\nNouveau Roman, Sartre and de Beauvoir were quite reserved\ntowards the Nouvelle Vague, the new French cinema of the 1960s\n(ibid.). \n\nRather than Sartre, it is Merleau-Ponty who gave the most lucid\nexposition of the evident link between cinema and existentialist\nphilosophy in a conference at the National School of Cinema in\nParis (1947b). Despite this insightful text, however, compared with the\neminent philosophical status that is bestowed upon theatre, the novel, and painting for the late Merleau-Ponty, as the truly\n“metaphysical” art forms, cinema is remarkably absent from\nthe most important existentialist writings in aesthetics.","contact.mail":"jp.deranty@mq.edu.au","contact.domain":"mq.edu.au"}]
