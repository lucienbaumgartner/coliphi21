Instead, most\nviewed the family as a separate realm that needed to be protected from\nstate intrusion. The private sphere and the public sphere were\ndichotomized into separate realms with the latter beyond the reach\nof public action. Where these philosophers did not legitimate private\npower in the family, they simply ignored it.\n\n\n\nJohn Stuart Mill was a notable exception, arguing in The\nSubjection of Women, that the inequality of women in the\nfamily was incompatible with their equality in the wider social world.\nConsider, he asks, the consequences of “the self-worship, the\nunjust self preference” nourished in boys growing up in male\ndominated households in which “by the mere fact of being born\nmale he is by right the superior of all and every one of an entire\nhalf of the human race” (1869, 86–87). How will such\nboys grow up into men who treat women as equals? Feminist scholarship\nhas continued, extended and deepened this attack on the conception of\nthe family as a private personal realm. Indeed, the idea that\n“the personal [that is, the family] is political” is the\ncore idea of most contemporary feminism.\n\n\n\nFeminists argue that the so-called private realms of family, sex and\nreproduction must be part of the political realm and thus subject to\nprinciples of justice for three distinct reasons: \n\nLet us consider each of these three arguments in turn. \n\nTraditional views of the family often treat it as a pre-political or\nas a non-political institution. The family is viewed as\npre-political by those that hold that its basis lies in\ncertain facts of biology and psychology. The family is viewed as\nnon-political by those who hold that the circumstances of\npolitics — scarcity, conflict of interests and power — do\nnot obtain in the family. Both of these assumptions are problematic and\nhave been subject to feminist criticism. \n\nFor many traditional theorists of the family, nature itself\nnecessitates the division of tasks within the family. Women naturally\nwant to have and raise children; men by nature do not (Rousseau 1762).\nThere is thus a physiologically grounded basis of gender difference:\nwomen's predominant role in childrearing and domestic labor is their\nbiological destiny. \n\nFeminists have given three responses to this argument. \n\nSocial constructivists deny that there are any essential\ndifferences between male and female bodies or psychologies that\nexplain women's position in the family (Haslanger 2000). Social\nconstructivists have explored the ways in which culture and society\nhave shaped even the most ostensibly natural differences between men\nand women. They argue that many of the differences between men and\nwomen alleged to be the source of gender inequality should instead be\nviewed as the outcome of that inequality.  For example, they claim\nthat we cannot understand sex-based differentials of height and\nphysical strength without considering the influence of diet, division\nof labor, and physical training. Feminist historians and\nanthropologists have sought to demonstrate the significant roles that\nculture, religion and social class have played in shaping women's\nlives (Scott 1988). \n\nDifference feminists accept that there are essential\nbiological or psychological differences between men and women. But they\nseek to challenge the normative and social implications of these\ndifferences. Even if women are by nature more nurturing than men, or\nmore concerned with their relationships with others, the effects of\nthese differences depend on how we value them (Gilligan 1982,\nNoddings 1986). If nurturing were a more valued activity, for example,\nthen we might arrange the work world so that women (and men) could\nspend more time with their children. Or, we might pay women (and men)\nfor their household labor and work in raising children. Difference\nfeminists seek to celebrate and revalue those characteristics\ntraditionally associated with women. On their view, there is no\nnecessary problem with a sex-based division of labor, provided it is\nvoluntary and that male and female roles are appropriately valued. This\ndifference perspective is perhaps best summed up by the words of the\nfamiliar quip: women who want to be equal with men lack ambition. \n\nThe anti-subordination feminist perspective aims to dislodge\nquestions about biological and psychological difference from the center\nof debates about the family and reproduction. A narrow focus on men and\nwomen's “difference” versus their “equality”\nobscures what is at stake in treating people as equals. Even if there\nare some natural differences between men and women, the crucial point is that these differences\ndo not justify social structures that leave women vulnerable to\npoverty, unequal pay for equal work, and domestic violence.\nWhatever the facts about women's biology or psychology, such\ndifferences do not entail women's social subordination (MacKinnon\n1989, Rhode 1989). Biology does not explain coverture — the\neighteenth century doctrine that assigned a wife's property and rights\nwholly to her husband — contemporary divorce law, child custody\nlaws, or laws governing women's reproduction. Nothing in our nature\ndictates the structure of work and school hours that make it extremely\ndifficult for anyone to combine work and raising children.\nEven if nature is part of the causal story of gender differences, it\ncannot by itself explain — or more importantly justify — the\nextent of the social inequality between men and women. \n\nThe fact that law already has permeated the family — as in the\ndoctrine of coverture — is an important insight of contemporary\nfeminism. Families have always been shaped by law — by coercion,\nas well as by social convention. For example, state laws in the United States\nregulate who can marry, who has parental rights, who can divorce and on\nwhat terms, and who can inherit property. Almost all countries have\nlaws that prevent gay couples from marrying and in many places from\nadopting children; in other countries daughters cannot inherit property\nat all with devastating consequences for their well-being. The family\nhas, in fact, always been heavily regulated by the state, often in ways\ndetrimental to women's equality (Fineman 1995). \n\nNevertheless, some political thinkers argue that law —\nparticularly, the assignment of rights and obligations — are\ninappropriately applied within the family. While families may\nappropriately be regulated as a legal entity through marriage and\ndivorce, these thinkers argue that the day-to-day interactions of\nfamilies are based on different principles. Families are based on the\nties of love and affection, not justice. The circumstances of justice\n— conflict of interests, power, and scarcity — do not\nbelong in families, at least when they are functioning properly. These\nthinkers criticize the idea — which they associate with bringing\njustice into the family — that the task of washing the dishes\nshould be allocated on principles of justice (Sandel 1982). \n\nThere is something to be said for an ideal of families as\nassociations beyond justice whose participants think from a sense of\ntheir intertwined lives, of a common good. In Christopher Lasch's\nresonant phrase, such families can be a “haven in a heartless\nworld”. But this view of the family is limited in certain crucial\nrespects. First, many families, rather than based on love and consent\nare based on coercion. Real families are often characterized by\ndisagreements, and in the extreme, by violence. In these families, the\ninternalization of norms of justice would be an improvement. Second,\neven in loving families, women are made vulnerable by the unequal\ndivision of labor in the family, by assumptions about child-rearing and\nhousehold responsibilities. While ideal families may go beyond justice\nin their relations to their members, it is still appropriate for\ncitizens to reflect on the ways that domestic arrangements\naffect social justice and family life. Most of us are simultaneously\nmembers of families and members of a larger polity: there is no reason\nwhy a perspective based on harmonious affection cannot coexist with a\nperspective based on standards of justice (Okin 1989). Finally, given\nthe existence of two complementary but diverse perspectives, there is\nno reason to think that citizens will seek to apply principles of\njustice to dishwashing. \n\nJustice, however, must govern families not only because real\nfamilies are far from ideal. The state also has an interest in\npromoting and maintaining just families because of the effects of\nfamilies on future citizens and on women's opportunities and real\nfreedoms. \n\nAlmost every person in our society starts life in a family of some\nkind. The kind of family one has influences the kind of person one\ngrows up to be. In families, children first encounter concepts of\nright and wrong, as well as role models who shape their sense of what\nit is possible for them to do and be. Families are an important school\nof moral learning, but too many families teach inequality and\nsubordination, not principles of justice. Following Mill, feminist\nscholars question how children whose first experiences of adult\ninteraction are unequal altruism, domination and manipulation can\nlearn and accept the principles of justice they need to be citizens in\na democracy committed to the equal worth of all (Okin 1989). \n\nPlato also recognized the importance of the family for the moral\ndevelopment of individuals. Families inhibit or promote children's talents and abilities. In Book V of the Republic, Socrates\ndiscovers that when theorists of justice take into account the profound and often unfair effects\nof the family on the development of children's potentials , they will be forced to\nthe conclusion that the family must be abolished. While few feminists\nfollow Plato in proposing to abolish the family, almost all see the\nfamily as in need of reform. \n\nFamilies are schools of moral learning, but they are more than that.\nParents play an extremely large role in the lives of their dependent\nchildren. States need to regulate families to insure that all children\nare educated, are inoculated against contagious diseases and have\ntheir basic needs met. No state can be indifferent to whether or not\nchildren grow up to be literate, functioning members of its\neconomy. For this reason, all societies provide some degree of publicly financed education for children. All states also depend, at least in part, on the labor of\ncaretaking and childrearing, work that is today overwhelmingly done by\nwomen. Given its evident importance, why is domestic labor not given\ngreater public recognition? Feminists have made a strong case for\ntaking such care-giving within the family seriously, and for the state\nto attend to the justice issues involved in care provision (Kittay\n1999). Feminists have also argued that just states must provide care in\na way that ensures that all children — boys and girls,\nrich and poor — have equal opportunities to grow up able to take\npart in their society. \n\nDespite the advances prompted by the feminist movement during the last\nquarter of the twentieth century, most families are based on an\nunequal division of labor. Around the globe, women still do the vast\nmajority of domestic labor — not only tending the house, but\nalso raising and caring for children. Feminist scholars have attacked\ntraditional approaches to the family that obscure this inequality. For\nexample, they have criticized the dominant economic approaches to the\nfamily that regard the head of the household as an altruistic agent of\nthe interests of all the family's members (See Becker 1981 for such\nan approach). They have shown that, in poor countries, when\ndevelopment aid is given to male rather than female heads of\nhousehold, less of it goes to care for children (Haddad et\nal. 1997). \n\nFeminist economists and sociologists have also shown how women's role\nin parenting constrains their ability to pursue careers and compete\nfor demanding jobs (Bergmann 1986, Folbre 1994). Many women\ntherefore remain economically dependent on their male partners, and\nvulnerable to poverty in the event of divorce. In one widely cited\nstudy, ex-husbands' standard of living was found to have risen by 42%\nthe year after their divorce, while ex-wives' standard of living was\nreduced by 78% (Weitzman 1985). This huge discrepancy in income and\nwealth results from a number of factors, including the fact that women\nwho have devoted themselves to raising children usually have lower job\nqualifications than their husbands and less work experience. \n\nWomen's economic dependency in turn allows them to be subject to\nphysical, sexual or psychological abuse by their husbands or other male\npartners (Gordon, 1988; Global Fund for Women Report, 1992). Women have\nan asymmetric ability to exit from marriage; and this gives\nhusbands/male partners considerably more power and bargaining advantage\nwithin the marriage (Sen 1989). \n\nDefenders of the status quo often argue that if women have less\nopportunity than men, this is largely due to their own choices.\nFeminists have countered this claim by showing the ways that such\nchoices are shaped and constrained by forces that are themselves\nobjectionable and not freely chosen. Some feminists follow Nancy\nChodorow's argument (1978) that the fact that children's primary\nnurturers are mothers leads to a sexually differentiated developmental\npath for boys and girls. Girls identify with the same-sex nurturing\nparent, and feel more connected to others; boys, by identifying with\nthe absent parent, feel themselves to be more\n“individuated”. Chodorow argues that mothering is thereby\nreproduced across generations by a largely unconscious\nmechanism that, in turn, perpetuates the inequality of women at home\nand at work. \n\nChodorow's work is controversial, but it is undeniable that girls\nand boys grow up facing different expectations of how they will behave.\nChildren receive strong cultural messages — from parents, teachers,\npeers and the media — about sex-appropriate traits and behaviors. Girls\nare supposed to be nurturing, self-sacrificing, non-aggressive and\nattractive; “care” is largely seen as a feminine\ncharacteristic. These traits traditionally contribute to women's\ninequality: nurturers are not seen as good leaders. There are few women\nCEOs, generals, or political leaders. Girls may also become\ndisadvantaged by the anticipation of marriage and child-rearing,\ninsofar as they are less likely than boys to invest in their human\n“capital”. \n\nA second feminist response stresses the ways that women's choices in\nthe family interact with unjust social structures outside the\nfamily, in particular, with the sex segregated division of labor in\nthe economy, where women still earn only about 75% of what men earn,\nfor comparable work. Given women's lower wages, it is rational for\nfamilies who must provide their own childcare to choose to withdraw\nwomen from the workforce. Once women withdraw, they find themselves\nfalling further behind their male counterparts in skill development\nand earning power. Child care is an immensely time consuming activity\nand those who do it single-handedly are unlikely to be able to pursue\nother goods such as education, political office or demanding\ncareers. The structures of work and family thus form a “cycle of\nvulnerability” that conditions the lives and choices of women\n(Okin 1989). Even those who do somehow manage to combine work and\nfamily, face serious obstacles including the lack of good quality\nsubsidized day care; jobs with little flexibility for those who need\nto care for a sick child; school schedules that seem to be premised on\nhaving a parent at home; and the expectation that they will continue\nto work a “second shift”, (Hochschild 1989) assuming the\nresponsibility for the bulk of household labor. Statistical analysis\nshows that motherhood tends to lower a woman's earnings, even if she\ndoes not take any time off from paid work (Folbre 1994). Gender\ninequality persists in access to positions in economy and government\nwhere white males are about 40% of population but 95% of senior\nmanagers, 90% of newspaper editors, and 80% of congressional\nlegislators (Rhode 1997).  And although women have made progress in\nentering elite positions in the economy and government, there is\nevidence that such progress has now stalled (Correll 2004). \n\nFeminists share the view that contemporary families are not only\nrealms of choice but also realms of constraint. Feminists also agree\nthat the gender hierarchy in our society is unjust, although they\ndiffer on what they take its sources to be. Some feminists emphasize\nthe family as the “linchpin” of gender injustice (Okin\n1989); while others see the main causes in the structure of work and\nopportunity (Bergmann 1986); still others stress sexual domination and\nviolence (MacKinnon 1989). All of these strands seem important\ncontributors to gender inequality, and it is doubtful that any one can\nbe fully reduced to the others. It is therefore important to deepen\nour understanding of the interplay of these different sources of\nsubordination. There is clearly what Okin (1989) termed a “cycle\nof vulnerability” through which women's unequal position in the\nhome interacts with women's unequal position in the workplace.  For\nexample, because women tend to earn less than men, if someone has to\ntake time off to raise the kids, it makes economic sense for it to be\nthe female lower earner. Gender also undoubtedly interacts with other\naxes of social disadvantage, such as race and class. Indeed, feminist\nwork on families has increasingly recognized the diverse experiences\nof women in families that encompass not only heterosexual two parent\nfamilies, but also single women, lesbian and gay families, and\nfamilies in poverty. We need to be careful not to lump together\ndistinct social phenomena. Although I will sometimes refer to\n“the family” in this essay, it is crucial to keep in mind\nthe diversity of family forms and circumstances. \n\nWhether families are the primary cause, or a contributing cause\nalong with other social structures and culturally generated\nexpectations, feminists point to the ways that families are\npart of a system that reproduces women's social and economic\ninequality. Families cannot be viewed apart from that system or in\nisolation from it. Nor can they be assumed to be just: too many of them\nare not. The issue, for feminists, is not whether the state can\nintervene in the family and reproduction but how, and to what ends. \n\nHow should parenting and household responsibilities be distributed?\nWho should have a right to household earnings? Who has the right to\nform a family? To have a child? What defines a parent? How many parents\ncan a child have? How many children can a parent have? Answering these\nalready complex questions is additionally complicated by the existence\nof new technologies that make possible multiple ways of becoming a\nparent. Below, I examine two main values that feminists have argued\nshould guide the families we make: individual choice and equality. \n\nThe traditional family has seen many changes in the last fifty\nyears. In the decades following WW II increasing numbers of women\nentered the labor force. Divorce rates increased dramatically: the\ndivorce rate in the 1980s was almost two and a half times what it had\nbeen in 1940. The development of the birth control pill has made it\neasier for women to avoid unwanted pregnancies and to plan when to have\nchildren. There are a growing number of single parent families, gay\nfamilies, and extended families. By 1989, 25% of children were living\nin single parent households, many of which were poor, prompting a sense\nthat the family was in crisis (Minow 1997). Economic, technological\nand social factors have together made the full time-stay at home\nhousewife and mother with a working husband a statistical minority. \n\nLaws governing families have also changed. Modern laws are more\nlikely to view men and women as equals, who can be subjected to the\nauthority of each other only with their own consent. In almost all\ndeveloped nations, legal restrictions on marriage, divorce and abortion\nwere relaxed in a relatively short time, between the mid 1960s and the\nmid-1980s (Glendon 1987). In Loving v Virginia, for example,\nthe US Supreme Court struck down state laws preventing people from\ndifferent races from marrying; Roe v Wade legalized abortion.\nOf course, many of these changes have been contested and there remain\nserious constraints on women's reproductive choices. Nor can gay people\nusually marry, although laws and norms have been evolving in favor of gay marriage (see, most recently: Hollingsworth v. Perry; United States v. Windsor). The family has\nincreasingly evolved from a hierarchical institution based on a fixed\nstatus to a set of relationships between individuals based on contract.\nIndeed, many people now view marriage not as an unalterable condition,\nbut as a contract whose terms can be altered and negotiated by the\nparties involved. \n\nHow far should the contract idea of marriage be taken? Some\nfeminists have proposed extending the contract model to allow any and\nall consenting adults to marry and to freely choose the terms of their\nassociation. These feminists would abolish state-defined marriage\naltogether and replace it with individual contracts drawn up by each\ncouple wanting to marry (Fineman 1995, Weitzman 1985). Indeed,\ncontracts would allow not only gay couples to marry but would also\nallow plural marriages, as in the case of polygamy. \n\nContract or choice based feminists would allow individuals\nthemselves to determine what kinds of families they want to create.\nThus, they would allow people to make their own agreements about\nprocreation without state restriction. These arrangements could include\nnot only rights to abortion and contraception, but also rights to\ncontract away parental bonds and to sell and buy gametes and\nreproductive labor. Thus, choice feminists would allow gay or infertile\ncouples or single persons to contract for sperm or eggs or gestational\nservices before a child is conceived on terms that they alone\ndecide. \n\nOn the contract view, the traditionalist's sense that there is a\n“crisis” surrounding the family is unwarranted. What is in\ncrisis is the nuclear, heterosexual marital unit. But this unit was\nnever good for women (Coontz 1992). Advocates of contract marriage\nargue that extending the role of choice in reproduction and in the\nfamilies we make will empower women. For example, contracting can help\nspur new forms of family, enabling gay couples and single women and\nmen to have children. Gay families have traditionally been more\negalitarian in the division of domestic labor then heterosexual\nfamilies, and less likely to reproduce mothering along gender\nlines. Others argue that allowing women to sell their reproductive\nservices would empower women and improve their welfare by unleashing a\nnew source of economic power (Shalev 1989). \n\nIn contrast to the ideal of families as having an internal nature\nbeyond justice, some feminists have even proposed using a marriage\ncontract to determine the domestic division of labor. They argue that\nby moving marriage from an implicit status based, patriarchal\narrangement to an explicit contract, women's freedom and equality would\nbe enhanced (Weitzman 1985). This proposal has been criticized on\nseveral grounds: as inattentive to the background inequalities would\ngive rise to unequal bargaining power in such a contract (Sen 1989);\nas potentially undermining to intimacy and commitment within marriage\n(Anderson 1993) and as opening the door to illiberal intrusions into\nfamily life, given the need for states to enforce such contracts\n(Elshtain 1990). \n\nOther feminist authors have criticized the very idea of choice as\napplied to reproduction and marriage. They argue that practices such\nas prostitution, surrogacy or gendered marriages are based on\nobjectionable views of women — as bodies, as breeders, or as\ndomestic helpmates — and that these views in fact underlie\nseemingly freely choices to enter these practices. For example,\nCatherine MacKinnon (1989) argues that such choices can as easily be\nviewed as based on subordination and domination as on free consent.\nAnd Carole Pateman (1983) similarly questions the choices alleged to\nunderlie women's decisions to engage in prostitution. \n\nHow deep a challenge do these arguments present to the choice based\nview of marriage? Proponents of the choice view might plausibly claim\nthat if men and women could explicitly define the terms of their\nrelationships, and retain a right of exit when the terms were not\nfulfilled, then at least extreme forms of gender domination would be\nundercut. They might also stress the ways that their view accommodates\na plurality of understandings of human relationship: allowing for\nexperimentation, diversity and exit options. It is true that contracts\nwould allow men and women to contract for traditional gendered\nfamilies, but why should we object to such families if they are freely\nentered into and express the values of the participants? Behind this\ndisagreement is an important division over the extent to which a just\nsociety must accommodate different views of family relation. Where does\nsociety draw the line on toleration of hierarchical views of men and\nwomen's roles? When should a view of family form be ruled out of bounds\nbecause it is too inegalitarian? \n Many egalitarian arguments agree with much of the choice\nbased perspective and hold that choice, liberty and privacy are all\nimportant elements of just families and reproductive practices. But\nfeminists making these arguments question whether a contractual,\nchoice based approach to these issues adequately captures other values\nthat are also important. The fact that an arrangement has been chosen\ndoes not make it just. In addition to choice, egalitarian feminists\nstress gender equality and the protection of the vulnerable. \n\nConsider the domestic division of labor. Drawing on the above\ndiscussion of labor market segregation, some feminists argue that the\ngendered division of labor in the family, even if freely chosen,\noperates in the context of a background system of injustice. The fact\nthat it is freely chosen then (if it is) does not seek to justify it.\nChoices are not all that is relevant to moral evaluation for two\nreasons. First, because we need to maintain just background social\nstructures, we must be attentive to choices that would undermine these\nstructures. If gendered families encourage the subordination and\ndeference of girls, and produce unequal opportunities for boys and\ngirls, then a just society must seek to redress those effects. Second,\nthe understanding of marriage as a choice does not by itself draw\nattention to the background social institutions — institutions which\nfeminists argue are unjust. It is not enough to allow people to choose\nif their choices are unfairly constrained by unequal family and\nworkplace structures, unequal pay for equal work, and inadequate social and welfare services which\ntogether render so many women vulnerable. Over a century ago, Mill had\npointed out that women's decision to marry could scarcely be called\n“free” given women's low wages, and dim employment and\neducational prospects. The choice to marry was he said, a Hobson's\nchoice, that or nothing. Although the situation of women has improved,\nmarriage remains an economic necessity for many women today as well. We\nmust attend to the wider context in which choices are made. \n\nEgalitarians supplement and constrain the contract-based perspective\nwhere it renders woman subordinate or especially vulnerable. They might\nalso point out, with the critics of choice based views, that some\nchoices are not and cannot be fully informed. Consider, for example, a\ncontract based view of marriage and child-bearing that holds people\nfully responsible for the results of their choices. Contracts in\nmarriage and childbearing involve potentially long-term contracts, with\nimplications that are not easily known in advance. Can a woman who has\nnever been pregnant accurately predict the effects of ceding her\nparental rights to a child? Can an eighteen year old woman who agrees\nto a traditional gendered division of labor in her marriage know what\nshe will feel like as a fifty year old woman suddenly left by her\nhusband? \n\nFeminists differ on whether choices within the family that undermine\ngender equality should be respected. They also differ on how to deal\nwith those choices when it is agreed that they must be redressed. Some\nfeminists prefer to de-rail such choices indirectly, by\ncreating incentives for people to act so as to maintain just social\nstructures or by creating external counterweights to individual\nactions. Okin (1989) argues, for example, that spouses should be\nequally entitled to each other's earnings, that day care should be available to all\nfamilies, and that work should be made more flexible. She believes\nthat reconfiguring outward structures is the most appropriate way to\nshape individual choice inside the family. Alternative views give less\nroom for individual choice within the family. Consider proposals to\nlegally mandate shared domestic responsibilities. Other feminists\nconsider such a remedy worse than the malady it is designed to redress\n(Elshtain 1990). \n\nSome feminist scholars explicitly try to combine and balance a\ncommitment to choice with a commitment to equality. Molly Shanley\n(2003) advocates an “equal status” view of marriage that\ncombines a commitment to the public importance of marriage as an\ninstitution with elements of individual choice that broaden the idea\nof who can marry to groups that have been denied such status as a\nresult of their subordination and stigmatization. Shanley emphasizes\nthe public's interest in sustaining just marriages, as well\nas its interest in sustaining certain forms of family relationship in\nthe face of poverty or illness. Equal status requires attention to the\nbackground in which individual choices are made, especially to issues\nof poverty, workplace structure and job market segregation. But it\nalso attends to the value of intimacy and the role of choices as\nenabling or undermining that intimacy. \n\nChoice based arguments and equality arguments differ on the\nnature of the marriages they would allow. For example, while a choice\nbased contractual view favors plural marriages, egalitarian arguments\ndo not straightforwardly imply a right to legalized polygamy. For\negalitarians, the crucial question would be whether polygamy is\npossible without the subordination of women. \n\nThere is thus serious disagreement among feminists (and non\nfeminists!) as to how to balance freedom and equality, and more\nspecifically values based on freedom of association and freedom of\nreligion with the value of gender equality. This disagreement has\nimplications for the scope of legitimate state intervention in family\nlife. (For further discussion, see Nussbaum 2000.) \n\nAlthough some families cannot or choose not to have children, it is\nimpossible to think about issues surrounding the family and\nreproduction without considering the interests of children. Putting\nchildren into the equation also shows how we need to think very\nconcretely about the meaning and implications of the values we\nendorse. \n\nConsider choice based arguments in favor of contractual families.\nChildren do not choose to enter their families; moreover, children are,\nat least initially, completely dependent on their caretakers. Parents\nare rightly taken to have an obligation to care for their children that\ndoes not rest on children's consent or contract. Furthermore, a choice by\nparents to participate in a gendered family affects the lives of their\nchildren. The free choices of such parents generate unequal\nopportunities for their children, inequalities that children themselves\nhave not chosen. \n\nAlthough some thinkers have advocated licensing parents (Mill 1869,\nLaFollette 1980), today anyone who can biologically produce a child\ncan be a parent. (The issue becomes complicated when more than two\npeople are involved in the production of a child, as we will see\nbelow.) Adoption is highly regulated by law, but once an adoption is\ncompleted, law treats biological and non-biological parents alike with\nrespect to raising their children. Society gives wide discretion to\nall families in rearing children and intervenes only when children\nsuffer abuse, or where the family falls apart. Earlier courts used a\n“best interests” standard to determine custody in such\ncases. But this standard has been subjected to powerful criticisms:\nreasonable people will differ about what constitutes the\n“best” for their child; and the standard is easily\nsusceptible to biases based on class, race and sexual orientation. Ian\nShapiro (1999) advocates a “basic interest” standard for\nlegitimizing state intervention. We might think of such basic\ninterests as defining a line beneath which no child should be allowed\nto sink. The question for feminists here is whether gender equality is\na basic interest of children and if so how best to promote it. \n\nFeminists have begun to explore some of the gender issues\nsurrounding adoption and parental rights; including whether an unwed\nfather should have veto rights to the mother's decision to place their\nchild up for adoption; and the roles of gestational as well as genetic\ncontribution in determining parenthood (Shanley 2001). \n\nWhen we think of children, we must also think of how they are\nproduced. Some feminists see women's subordination as fundamentally\ncaused by their role in reproduction: on this view, only test tube\nbabies will make possible women's equality (Firestone 1970). But this\nseems like an overstatement: it is not the biology of child production\nthat makes women subordinate but its sociology and economics. Surely,\nadoptive mothers are as vulnerable to inegalitarian workplace\nstructures of gender hierarchy as biological ones. Nonetheless,\nbearing a child can have dramatic and negative consequences for women\nwhen it occurs in a context of little social support and rigid job\nstructures. Researchers have increasingly documented a\n“motherhood penalty”: women who raise children fall behind\ntheir unmarried counterparts in salary and position. The U.S. Family\nand Medical Leave Act was a partial step in the right direction of\ncompensating parenthood, granting twelve weeks of unpaid leave for a\nnew parent with all benefits and the right to return to the same or a\ncomparable job. But it is difficult to enforce, and work culture makes\nit hard for those entitled to exercise their right. Men, in particular\nare unlikely to take time off following the birth of a child. \n\nIt is therefore worthwhile to look into new technologies that make\npossible new ways of becoming (or failing to become) a parent. What are\nthe implications of these technologies for the condition of women? For\nchildren? \n\nHistorically, men have exercised enormous power over women's bodies\nthrough controlling their sexuality and reproduction. \n\nRoe v Wade (1973) granted women the right to terminate an unwanted\npregnancy, based on an implicit fundamental right to privacy. Although\nthe Supreme Court in its decision did not hold such right was\nabsolute, and argued that it must be weighted against competing state\ninterests in maternal safety and the protection of prenatal life, it\nprotected this right during the first trimester of pregnancy. In the\ndecades following Roe, its ruling has been weakened, most notably by\nrequirements of spousal and parental notification and consent, the\nenactment of “waiting periods” and restrictions on the use\nof public funds. In the wake of continued social controversy as well\nas violence and harassment directed at abortion service providers, the\nnumber of doctors who are willing and able to provide such services is\ndeclining. By the mid 1990s, 85% of America's counties had no facility\noffering abortions; 2 states had only 1 provider (Rhode 1997). Many\nstates have moved to criminalize late term abortions.   \n\nAlthough most feminists endorse some right to abortion, the issue of\nabortion cannot easily be reduced to the interests of men versus the\ninterests of women. Women are represented on both sides of the abortion\nissue, as leaders, activists and supporters. Even among feminist\narguments in favor of abortion there are a diversity of views as to the\ngrounds that serve to justify it. \n\nSome arguments for permitting a right to abortion depend on denying\nrights to the fetus. Only persons have rights and fetuses, it is\nargued, are not yet persons (Tooley 1972). Yet while many arguments\nagainst abortion depend on the idea that the fetus has a right to life,\nnot all arguments supporting legal abortion reject that right. Judith\nJarvis Thomson (1971) argued that even if the fetus is a person with a\nright to life, there are limits on what the state can compel women who\ncarry fetuses in their bodies to do. If women have rights over their\nown bodies, then they have rights not to have their bodies used by\nothers against their will. The state has no right to force someone to\ndonate use of her body to another person, even if that person is in\nextreme need. (In Thomson's famous example, a person is hooked up to a\nfamous violinist, who will die if she withdraws her body's support. While it might be virtuous to remain hooked up, Thomson argues that it is not required by morality.)\nThomson's argument stresses bodily integrity and self-ownership, and\nargues that if we accept these premises we can only allow fetuses to\nuse women's bodies with women's consent. Implicit in Thomson's argument\nis also a point about gender equality: since we do not in general\ncompel people (i.e., women and men) to donate use of their\nbodies to others even in cases of extreme need, then why do we think we\nare justified in only compelling women? \n\nFor some feminists Thomson's analogy is not appropriate. They reject\nthe perspective of thinking of fetus and mother as distinct persons and\nemphasize their intertwined relationship. Others worry that the\nperspective of abortion as a right having to do with ownership and\ncontrol of one's body would make it difficult to question abortions\nperformed on grounds of sex selection, a practice which is becoming\nmore common around the world in countries where having girls is\ndisfavored; or abortions sought on trivial grounds like the timing of a\nvacation. \n\nTo view abortion only in terms of the freedom of individual choice\nor even as a clash of rights neglects a range of other relevant\nconsiderations. These include: the fact that women and only women get\npregnant and bear children, that women earn less than men, that they\nare subjected to sexual violence, have little or no access to publicly\nprovided day care, and that they have less familial or political\ndecision-making power than men. Abortion is connected to other issues\nthat need to be considered, especially the effects of unwanted\npregnancies on the lives of women and children (Sherwin 1987). \n\nFeminists who see a range of values at stake in abortion are more\nlikely to advocate compromise than those who hold single valued\nperspectives. Shrage (1994), for example, proposes that given the\ndiversity of values involved in the abortion controversy\n— including views of life's sanctity (Dworkin 1993) and the\nmeaning of motherhood (Luker 1984) we seek only conditional access to\nabortion — during the first trimester — and advocate policies\nthat help minimize the need for abortion, such as easily available\ncontraception. \n\nIt is now possible for individuals or couples to transact for\nreproductive services. New technologies now make possible the creation\nof children whose genes come from people unrelated to the woman who\ngives birth to them or to the people who raise them. For example, a\ncouple can buy eggs from one woman and then implant those eggs in\nanother woman. Or they can implant a man's sperm in a woman who will\nbear the child.  \n\nOf course, market transactions regarding genetic materials are not\nnew: men have sold sperm in the United States for decades. But\ncontemporary law is unsettled on the issue of commercial surrogacy. \n\nThe so-called Baby M case is perhaps the best-known case involving\n“surrogate motherhood”, although the use of the term in\nthis case is, arguably, misleading. Mary Beth Whitehead agreed to be\ninseminated with the sperm of William Stern and to give up any\nresulting child to him and his wife for $10,000. After giving birth to\na child and turning that child over to the Sterns, Whitehead became\ndistraught. A conflict ensued over parental rights, and a New Jersey\ncourt initially gave full custody to the Sterns and discounted the fact\nthat Whitehead was the child's genetic and gestational mother. On\nappeal, the decision was overturned and the surrogacy contract was\ninvalidated. The court granted custody to the Sterns but ordered that\nWhitehead be granted visitation rights. \n\nFeminists are divided on the issue of commercial surrogacy. Those\nwho support surrogate motherhood often stress the increase in freedom\nit brings. Surrogate contracts allow women to have additional choices\nover their reproduction. Carmel Shalev (1989) goes further, arguing\nthat prohibiting such contracts fails to give due respect to the\nchoices women do make. If a woman freely enters into a contract to\nproduce a child, it is paternalistic and demeaning to prevent her\nchoice. \n\nDefenders of commercial surrogacy also carefully distinguish it from\nbaby selling: children are not sold as commodities, but rather women's\nreproductive services are for sale. Since we allow men to sell their\nsperm, why should women be prevented from participating in an analogous\ntransaction? Finally, defenders point out that commercial surrogacy\noffers new ways for gays and lesbians and single people to become\nparents. \n\nCritics of commercial surrogacy likewise offer a diversity of\nobjections. Perhaps the most common objection is based on the claim\nthat gestational labor is different from other types of labor. Margaret\nJane Radin (1988) and Carole Pateman (1983) stress the ways that the\nlabor of bearing a child is more intimately bound up with a woman's\nidentity than other types of labor. Contract pregnancy involves an\nalienation of aspects of the self so extreme as to make it an\nillegitimate practice. Selling sperm is not analogous: the work of\npregnancy is long-term, complex and involves an emotional and physical\nbonding between mother and fetus. (See also Rich 1976 for a\nbrilliant phenomenology of pregnancy.) \n\nElizabeth Anderson (1990) echoes this objection, but adds that\nsurrogacy contracts also alienate a woman from her love for the child\nand frequently involve exploitation, as surrogate sellers have less\nwealth and are more emotionally vulnerable than buyers. Other\nobjections stress the weakening of the link between parent and child,\nand the special vulnerability of children. \n\nSatz (1992) argues that there are limits to the objections based on an\nintimate connection between reproductive labor and our selves. Writers\nare intimately bound up with their writing, but they also want to be\npaid for their novels. Further, if the link between mother and\nfetus/reproductive labor is so strong, how can abortion be justified?\nInstead, Satz's argument stresses the background context of commercial\nsurrogacy: the gender inequality in modern society. Commercial\nsurrogacy allows women's labor to be used and controlled by others,\nand reinforces stereotypes about women. For example, pregnancy\ncontracts give buyers substantial control rights over women's bodies:\nrights to determine what the women eat, drink and do. They also may\ndeepen stereotypes: that women are baby-machines. Finally, the race\nand class dimensions of such markets also need to be considered. In\nanother well known case involving commercial surrogacy, a judge\nreferred to the African American women who gave birth to a child with\ngenes from a white father and a Philippina mother as the baby's\n“wet-nurse” and refused to grant her any visitation rights\nto see the child. Interestingly, practices such as in vitro fertilization, commercial\nsurrogacy and egg and gamete markets are largely unregulated. There\nare also huge for profit agencies involved in these ways of making a\nbaby.  By contrast, adoption is highly regulated: prospective parents\nhave to submit to intrusive interviews and home visits.  It is worth\nreflecting on this differential treatment, especially since many\nreproductive technologies also involve vulnerable third parties (Spar\n2006). \n\nFeminist writing on the family and reproduction is rich and\nmultifaceted. By forcing mainstream political philosophy to take into\naccount the importance of the family for social justice, feminists have\nchanged the field. At the same time, our efforts remain very much a\nwork in progress, much as are our current social practices of making\nfamilies and babies. In conclusion, I will mention two areas that need\nmore attention: \n\n(1) The claim that the family is not private is not the same as the\nclaim that there is no value to having a concept of privacy, nor does\nit entail that there is no way to draw a useful distinction between the\nprivate and public realms. How much public structuring of private\nchoices is permissible to foster gender justice? How do we balance\nclaims of gender injustice with other moral considerations like freedom\nof religion and freedom of association? \n\n(2) With notable exceptions, too few feminist philosophers have\noffered specific policy proposals for changes in domestic arrangements,\nor for policies designed to counteract those arrangements. We need more\nattention to creative family related policies that might lessen the\nhold of centuries of gender hierarchy. We also need good cross-country\ncomparisons, which draw on some of the alternative policies that have\nbeen tried in other countries, including policies designed to re-shape\nlabor markets, reform divorce law and provide safety nets for poor\nfamilies and their children.","contact.mail":"dsatz@stanford.edu","contact.domain":"stanford.edu"}]
