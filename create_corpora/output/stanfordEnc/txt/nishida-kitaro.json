Maraldo","entry":"nishida-kitaro","body.text":"\n\n\n\nNishida Kitarō was the most significant and influential Japanese\nphilosopher of the twentieth-century. His work is pathbreaking in\nseveral respects: it established in Japan the creative discipline of\nphilosophy as practiced in Europe and the Americas; it enriched that\ndiscipline by infusing Anglo-European philosophy with Asian sources of\nthought; it provided a new basis for philosophical treatments of East\nAsian Buddhist thought; and it produced novel theories of self and\nworld with rich implications for contemporary\nphilosophizing. Nishida’s work is also frustrating for its repetitive\nand often obscure style, exceedingly abstract formulations, and\ndetailed but frequently dead-end investigations.  Nishida once said of\nhis work, “I have always been a miner of ore; I have never\nmanaged to refine it” (Nishida 1958, Preface). A concise\npresentation of his achievements therefore will require extensive\nselection, interpretation and clarification.\n\n\n\nThis article presents Nishida’s work in a roughly chronological order. We\nmay understand his philosophical project overall as an attempt to\nrestore to experience and consciousness the rigor, necessity and\nuniversality accorded to logic. This project developed in a direction\nquite opposite to that of psychologism, which would reduce logic to\nthe contingencies of the individual mind or brain. It also differed\nfrom efforts to establish pure logic as a self-explanatory realm, in\nthat Nishida insisted on the starting point of experience, a priority\nhe shared with Husserl’s phenomenology and William James’ radical\nempiricism. We might characterize his philosophy in general as a\nphenomenological metaphysics for its universalizing of first-person\nexperience. It can also be considered an ontology of logical forms for\nits investigations of their experiential basis, with one\nqualification: although Nishida proposed a unitary source of such\nforms, that source is neither exclusionary nor positive; in other\nwords the source itself cannot be described monistically as a single,\nmore basic form or thing.  Nishida eventually called this source\n“mu” (nothingness), a notion he found particularly prominent in Asian traditions.  His interests led him to develop a\nphilosophy of culture, and his status as Japan’s premier philosopher led government officials to call upon him for justification of\nJapanese expansionism in the late 1930s and early 40s. His last work\nrecapitulated his non-dualistic account of world and self, but also\nreinterpreted the meaning of death.\n\n\n\nNishida was born on May 19, 1870 in the village of Unoke on the Sea of\nJapan just north of the city of Kanazawa. His birthplace, later incorporated into the town of Kahoku, is the site today of archives and a monumental museum, perhaps the world’s largest architectural structure dedicated to a single philosopher. Nishida grew up in the early years of the Meiji era (1868–1912), when Japan had reopened to the world after\ntwo and a half centuries of relative isolation and was undergoing a\nrevolutionary Europeanization of its political, educational and\ncultural institutions. As it touched Nishida’s early years, this\n“modernization” came in the form of both a rigid, often\noppressive school atmosphere that demanded obeisance to the emperor,\nand a liberating exposure to the progressive ideas of the Japanese\n“Enlightenment” that had introduced Western philosophy to\nJapan. In high school in Kanazawa he studied Chinese Confucian,\nNeo-Confucian and Daoist classics, learned to read English and German,\nexcelled in mathematics, and attempted briefly to penetrate works of\nHegel and Kant. He formed a life-long friendship with fellow student\nD.T. Suzuki, and with him dropped out of high school in 1890. Admitted\ninto Tokyo Imperial University as a “limited status”\nstudent the following year, Nishida studied Kant, Hegel and\nSchopenhauer under the first philosophy professors in Japan. After\ngraduating in 1894 with a thesis on Hume’s theory of causation, he\nmarried and held teaching positions at several provincial high schools\nand universities. During the next decade, despite the demands of\nfamily life and teaching German among other subjects, he published a\nfew philosophical essays, but was more intent on formal meditation\npractice under Zen masters in Kyoto. He began composing what later appeared as An Inquiry\ninto the Good in 1905 and on the basis of that work secured a\nposition at Kyoto Imperial University in 1910, becoming Professor of\nPhilosophy there in 1914. \n\nNishida concentrated on the philosophical books that made their way\ninto Japan and for the next decade wrote numerous essays that\nreworked ideas from the Neo-Kantians, Royce, Bergson, Hermann Lotze\nand, to a lesser extent, Husserl. These essays were collected into\nbooks that investigated a wide range of topics, including art and\nmorality, from the perspective of a theory of consciousness and the\nwill. Nishida’s fame began to spread in the 1920s.  He was\ninstrumental in securing positions at Kyoto University for Tanabe\nHajime, Watsuji Tetsurō, and Kuki Shuzō, and attracted\nstudents such as Nishitani Keiji, Miki Kiyoshi and Tosaka Jun, who all\nbecame significant philosophers in Japan. He developed his signature\ntheory of place (basho) in the mid 1920s, and continued to\nelaborate it after he became professor emeritus and moved to Kamakura\nin 1929. In the early 1930s his interests turned to the nature of\nhuman actions and interactions in the historical and social world, and\neventually to the meaning of culture and nationhood. \n\nBecause of his prestige as Japan’s premier philosopher, government\nofficials—among them his former student and then Prime Minister\nKonoe Fumimaro—appealed to him to justify Japanese\nnationalism. Nishida complied by addressing the issues, if not\nlegitimizing Japan’s expansionism and imperialism. Yet he considered much of that work\na distraction. He lectured on “The Problem of Japanese\nCulture” in 1938; when published two years later the book quickly sold\nsome 60,000 copies. He delivered an invited address to the emperor in\n1941 that advocated academic freedom and a place for each nation in\nthe global world, with each developing its own global\n perspective.[1]\n Addresses on the “Principles for the New World Order” and\non “The Body (or Essence) of the Nation” (kokutai)\nfollowed. During this time Nishida’s critics on the right considered\nhis political writings either too abstract or insufficiently\nsupportive of the government; his leftist critics, especially after the Second World War,\nfound them profusely nationalistic. Despite his failing health\nand the bombing of cities all around him, Nishida persisted in his\nphilosophical investigations, using for example Descartes’ Cogito and Leibniz’s\nPreestablished Harmony as points of departure. He\ncompleted the seminal essay, “The Logic of Place and the\nReligious Worldview,” just two months before his death on June 7,\n1945. Publication of his collected works in 19 volumes began two years\nlater. An extant photograph shows dozens of people camped out all\nnight long awaiting the issue of the first volume on July 20,\n1947. \n\nNishida’s private life, reflected only faintly in his philosophical\nwork, nevertheless left its stamp on its tenor. His perseverance\nthrough turmoil explains perhaps some of the intensity of his\nwriting. Comprehending reality for him was an emotive as well as\nintellectual achievement; his calligraphy and poetry, renowned in\ntheir own right, evince an acute awareness of transience and\ntranscendence.  Nishida experienced the death of his first wife and\nfour of his eight children; upon the passing of his first son he wrote\nthis waka poem: \n\n(Yusa 2002, 314–18). \n\nThree years later he was able to write \n\n(Nishida 1958, frontispiece, trans. by Robert Schinzinger). \n\nStarting with An Inquiry Into the Good, Nishida’s early work\ncalls into question two basic presuppositions of most modern\nepistemology: the assumptions that experience is individual and\nsubjective, and that it leads to knowledge only via a corrective\nprocess with input from the mind or other individuals. For Nishida,\nexperience in its original form is not the exercise of individuals\nequipped with sensory and mental abilities who contact an exterior\nworld; rather it precedes the differentiation into subject\nexperiencing and object experienced, and the individual is formed out\nof it. “The moment of seeing a color or hearing a sound”\nis prior not only to the thought that the color or sound is the\nactivity of an external object or that one is sensing it, but also to\nthe judgment of what the color or sound might be (Nishida 1990a,\n3). “Pure experience” names not only the basic form of\nevery sensuous and every intellectual experience, but also the\nfundamental form of reality, indeed the “one and only\nreality” from which all differentiated phenomena are to be\nunderstood. Cognitive activities such as thinking or judging, willing,\nand intellectual intuition are all derivative forms of pure experience\nbut still manifest it insofar as they are in action —when thinking,\nwilling, etc. are going on. The experience of a running horse, for\nexample, underlies the judgment that the horse is running, and the\nactivity of judging is an exercise of pure experience prior to a\nsubsequent judgment that “I am now judging.” Objective\nphenomena likewise derive from pure experience; when unified they are\ncalled “nature,” while “spirit” names the\nactivity of unifying.  Pure experience launches the dynamic process of\nreality that differentiates into subjective and objective phenomena on\ntheir way to a higher unity, and the recapture of our unitary\nfoundation is what Nishida means by the Good. \n\nNishida would deny that his position is a kind of idealism, either\nsubjective or transcendental, because no subjective mind, human or\ndivine, is the origin of what is taken as reality, and no personified\nor ego-aware spirit is its beginning or end. His notion of pure\nexperience clearly shows the influence of William James, Ernst Mach,\nand others, but it differs from their notions as well as from\ntwentieth-century expositions of pre-reflective experience by its\nemphasis on the non-individuated character and the seamless\ndevelopment of such experience. It is the pre-individual basis of a\nsystematic and all-comprehensive process. If we call his view a\n“theory” of experience, we should be aware that from his\nstandpoint the theory is a natural outgrowth of unitary experience and\nnot a reflection on it as proceeding from a different source. The\nquestion of how pure experience grounds reflective knowledge would\noccupy Nishida in works composed after An Inquiry Into the\nGood. \n\nThe directness, relative simplicity, and systematic approach of this\nbook made it perhaps the most accessible and popular of his\nworks; and many commentators have tended to emphasize it more than\nlater writings, despite Nishida’s own misgivings about its latent\npsychologism. Indeed Nishida’s initial position anticipates several\ndevelopments in his later thought.  For example, the early statements\nof experience prior to a subject experiencing and an object\nexperienced are re-formulated in the late 1920s as “seeing\nwithout a seer, hearing without a hearer.” The nullification of\nthe self in pure experience is later expressed as seeing the self from\nthe perspective of the world, where world is understood phenomenologically as a\ndetermining horizon of experience. The notion of the individual as\ndetermined by the universal concealed within (Nishida 1990a, 18)\npre-figures Nishida’s later adaptation of Hegel’s concrete universal;\nthe later works speak of the individual as the self-determination of\nthe universal. Finally, the ways in which pure experience can be said\nto be most concrete, to enfold all reality and indicate its\nundifferentiated ground, reflect methods that characterize Nishida’s\nphilosophy as a whole. \n\nThe question of how reflective thought is grounded in pure experience\nfinds a tentative answer in Nishida’s next essays. How can pure\nexperience develop into reflective thought that would seem to\ninterrupt and interpret it from an external vantage point? The\nself-reflection known as self-consciousness or self-awareness\n(jikaku) provides an answer. The most basic form of consciousness\ninherently reflects or mirrors itself within itself, so that\nthere is no difference between that which reflects and what is\nreflected. In this self-awareness, immediate experiencing and reflection\nare unified. In epistemological terms, knower and known are the same,\nand this instance of unity serves as the prototype of all\nknowledge. Two points may prevent a misunderstanding of Nishida’s\nposition here. First, his talk of self-awareness and\nself-reflection does not imply the pre-given existence of\nsome personal self that at times may be self-conscious. Secondly, if\nconsciousness is not placed in a pre-given self, it also is not placed\nin the objective world as a complex of brain cells or as the effect of\nmaterial objects on the mind or brain. As in modern phenomenology,\nconsciousness for Nishida means simply that which makes manifest or,\nto use a visual metaphor, that which illuminates. To emphasize its\nnon-objectifiable character, Nishida later will place consciousness\n“in” nothingness, that is, consider it a\n“form” of nothingness, and will eventually consider this a form of relative or oppositional nothingness, a non-being with respect to beings. In the meantime, he formulated it\nas the activity that precedes but ultimately unifies self and\nworld. Knowledge of things in the world begins with the\ndifferentiation of unitary consciousness into knower and known and\nends with self and things becoming one again. Such unification takes\nform not only in knowing but in the valuing (of truth) that directs\nknowing, the willing that directs action, and the feeling or emotive\nreach that directs sensing. In this stage of his work Nishida,\ninfluenced by Fichte and Schopenhauer, considered “absolute will” as\nthe preeminent form of self-awareness and saw it as the source of acts\nof moral decision and of the creation and appreciation of art.  Since\nthe activity of the will eludes reflection, however, Nishida\neventually abandoned this formulation of a unitary source. \n\nNishida’s epistemological motivation gradually gave way to an\nexamination of common ontological assumptions that underlie\nepistemology in the Western philosophical tradition. Not content\nmerely to expose such assumptions, however, Nishida formulated a novel\nontology of experience and self-awareness that would give them logical\nnecessity. \n\nConsidering what is taken as the ordinary consciousness of objects,\nNishida’s analysis questions both the notion of consciousness and that\nof objects. We can explicate Nishida’s first concern, with the\nontology of consciousness, in the following way: If the basic form of\nconsciousness did not have the reflexivity of self-awareness, then the\n“consciousness” of objects would be blind, as it were,\nlike a mechanical or neurological reaction to stimuli with no\nawareness whatsoever, and no way to account for awareness. The problem\nappears in attempts to define consciousness in a non-circular way. A\ndefinition of consciousness as a state of awareness or\nsentience, for example, or a state in which there is\nsomething it feels like to be in that state, merely replaces\nconsciousness with its synonyms. In a sense, awareness is\nirreducible, but it has a logical structure that accounts for its\nconnection to a world of objects. Structurally, awareness mirrors\nitself in itself, in a manner analogous to the way an infinite set\nmirrors itself in its equivalent subsets, or to the way an ideal map\nmirrors itself in all accurate representations of that\n map.[2] \n (Note that the English awareness can be used without the\nword self, but the Japanese word that translates as\nself-awareness is an inseparable compound, ji-kaku.)\nIf such self-awareness is to have logical necessity, it cannot be\nexplained as a contingent property of a particular mind or\nconsciousness that sometimes reflects on itself, that is, as a second\norder consciousness of being conscious of something. \n\nSimilarly, if self-awareness is to be an awareness of more than merely\noneself, it cannot be interior to the self alone. Modern\nepistemology’s solution was to split the world (the totality of all there is) in two, mind and\nnature, and then to see the mind as a mirror of nature, and ideas as\nrepresentations of real objects.  Nishida’s solution was to see the\nworld as mirroring itself in all the things “in the\nworld.” Whatever is “in the world” is a mirroring of\nthe world. In this sense it is the world that is\n“self-aware” or self-reflexive; and there is no outside to\nit. An individual’s “self-awareness” is a partial\nmirroring of the world; Nishida later described the individual self as\na focal point of the world. While he was still thinking in terms of\nconsciousness, however, Nishida avoided pinpointing awareness and\nspoke of the world as a field of consciousness to indicate the\nextension of the term beyond the individual self. This field is\nsimilar to Kant’s Bewußtsein überhaupt, in that it\nfunctions as the condition for the possibility of particular acts of\nconsciousness, but unlike Kant’s notion that turns everything into an\nobject of consciousness, its reflexive structure allows it to take\nitself into account without making it another object. \n\nWe may use Nishida’s own terms to explain his second concern, the way\nthat objects ordinarily function in judgments.  In what Nishida\nalternatively called the logic of objects or subjective logic, objects\nof consciousness are made the grammatical subject of propositions or judgments,\nand are specified by predicating properties of the \nsubject. Eventually a subject is reached that cannot itself be\npredicated of anything else, recalling Aristotle’s\nhypokeimenon or individual substance that can be subject but\nnever predicate. Even when modern epistemology eschewed or at least\nmodified Aristotle’s notion of substance as a substrate for contingent\nproperties, it appealed to substrates in the sense that they define\nthe primary subject of a judgment, that is, the judgment’s topic and grammatical subject.  Similar to phenomenologists,\nNishida wanted to account for the consciousness that posits such\nsubstances and underlies the subject of a judgment. Essays in From\nThat Which Acts to That Which Sees (1927) and subsequent works\ninvert Aristotle’s notion of the hypokeimenon and propose that\nconsciousness is the “transcendental predicate” that can\nnever be a subject; in other words consciousness in act can never be\nmade an object of consciousness that could become a grammatical subject.  Nishida is aware of the paradox of\nsuch formulations that would make consciousness the subject of\nsentences that describe it, and he sometimes resorts to explicitly\nparadoxical descriptions such as “seeing without a seer”\nand “seeing the form of the formless, hearing the voice of the\nvoiceless.” But he again also uses the straightforward metaphor,\nthe “field of consciousness,” to indicate its\nnon-subjective and non-objectifiable character. Consciousness cannot\nbe grasped as the property of an individual substance nor as anything\nlike a substance or underlying substrate itself. It functions as the\nfield that is the opening of world and self. \n\nIf judgments describe things and states of affairs and thus would give\nus access to reality by setting themselves over against that reality,\nwe must step back, as it were, and consider a wider reality that\nincludes judgments. In other words, we must place judgments that\npredicate universals of things into a wider field of predication, that is, in the\n“transcendental predicate” of consciousness. Here Nishida\nmight have further developed a phenomenology of the agency of\npredication, but instead he moves to a more logical account of its\nscope and developed what he called a predicate logic.[3] He thinks of\nuniversals as fields of possibility that become specified or\ndetermined (more accurately, that determine themselves) in their\nparticular instantiations. There is a necessary hierarchy of\nconcreteness among universals that Nishida expresses as the order of\ntopoi or places (basho). Most abstract are the universals\nthat serve as predicates in particular judgments. Judging or\npredication in turn takes place in the topos of consciousness, which\nis further concretized as the universal or topos of reflexive\nself-awareness wherein acts of seeing, knowing, desiring and willing\ntake place. And just as the world of self-awareness enfolds the world\nof nature described in judgments, it in turn is enfolded in the topos\n(Nishida calls it “the intelligible world”) within which\nthe creative self pursues ideal values like truth, beauty and\ngoodness. Here Nishida echoes the medieval, seemingly all-inclusive\ntranscendentalia that transcend all categories. In his terms,\nall predication would be a mirroring of the transcendentals of being\nand of the one (unum), the true (verum), and the\ngood (bonum). But those transcendentals, insofar as they\nthemselves all elude predication, actually point to a more inclusive\nand undifferentiated topos, absolute nothingness. \n\nIn summary, Nishida initially formulated his logic of place or topos\nto counter Neo-Kantian epistemology that took knowledge to be the\nsubject’s form-ruled construction of an objective world. He sought not\nonly to undermine the distinctions between subjective and objective\nbut also to place both sides within a more comprehensive and concrete\nconception. That is, while he first construed knowledge on the model\nof self-awareness in which self reflects itself within itself, he also\nfelt compelled to find a locus of non-differentiation behind the\ndistinction between such awareness and things seen from its vantage\npoint. As non-differentiated and inclusive, that locus is field-like,\na metaphor that Nishida at first replaced with the notion of topos or\n“place” (basho). Then he placed the topos of\nself-awareness in the even more inclusive and concrete value-forming\nworld. That world of creative activity anticipates what Nishida\neventually considered the ultimate topos that defies description,\npredication, or determination by something beyond or different from\nit.  His logic of place offered an alternative to the logic of\nsubstances presupposed in much traditional metaphysics. \n\nThe logical schema of topoi is paralleled by an ontological account.\nNishida articulated the topoi also in terms of what we may call a\nme-ontology, from the Greek meon or non-being. The\ntopos of being describes the world of nature. The topos\nof relative nothingness comprises the field of consciousness that is\nno-thing with respect to the things of which it is conscious. This\nnothingness, however, is still opposed to being, and so differs from\nthe absolute nothingness that underlies both sides of the opposition. Here\nand elsewhere Nishida plays on the word for absolute in Japanese,\nzettai, which literally means breaking through or overcoming\nopposition. His premise is that the meaning of “to be” is\n“to be within”; the ultimate “within” is the topos of absolute\nnothingness. \n\nThe topos of absolute nothingness is the ultimate “within\nwhich” all reality takes place.  It can be understood as an\nalternative to a transcendent determiner of the world as\nconceptualized, for example, in medieval philosophy’s notion of God,\nFichte’s transcendental ego, or Husserl’s transcendental\nsubjectivity. Nishida did use the language of transcendence to explain\nabsolute nothingness, saying it transcended the opposition between\nbeing and non-being, for example; but such language did not indicate\nany thing, power, or consciousness beyond the world. Absolute\nnothingness is infinitely determinable and its determinates form the\nactual world, but this “self-determination” occurs\n“without anything that does the determining,” like an agency without an agent. Equally paradoxical are the positive\ndescriptions Nishida gives it, in spite of the implicit claim that it\ndefies description. Rather than a mere absence of being, meaning, or\nfunction, absolute nothingness is active and creative in forming the\nactual world; and it manifests or awakens to itself through\nself-awareness. It is the foundation of the world and of the self\nwhich is a focal point of the world; but it is an uncommon kind of\nfoundation in that it functions through self-negation. It cannot be\ncalled “absolute” unless it negates any particular\ndetermination of it and simultaneously enfolds them all. It is the\nuniversal of universals. Nishida was not able to combine these various\ndescriptions into one coherent notion, but they partially converge in\nthe sense of an undifferentiated whole that includes all its\ndifferentiations. \n\nNishida intended his theory of place or topos to provide a logical\nfoundation for his previous philosophy of experience and\nself-awareness. Several overlapping models help make sense of this\nlogic. Nishida drew upon some models explicitly, for example, Plato’s\nnotion of the receptacle (chora) of ideas in the\nTimeus and Aristotle’s adaptation in his notion of\ntopos in On the Soul.  Another model Nishida used\nearly on was the notion of fields in modern physics and relativity\ntheory, in which space-time is a field inseparable from the physical\nobjects within it and determining how (when and where) they exist.\nAnalogously, for Nishida, all perceived and conceptualized objects are\n“in” the “field of consciousness” (Nishida\nborrowed the term from William James). Another early model was the\nlogic of universals that serve as predicates. Particulars or\nindividuals are placed within universals to specify their difference\nfrom other particulars or individuals, and less extensive universals\nare placed within more extensive ones, until one reaches the ultimate,\nboundless universal called nothingness. This “transcendental\npredicate” cannot become the subject matter of any description\nor proposition in positive terms, but it is ultimately entailed by\nevery specification.  \n\nOther analogies, although not explicitly mentioned by Nishida,\nnevertheless serve to clarify his logic at least in part.  A model of\ninterpretation is relevant: every text has its context, which in turn\nmay be made a text or thematized by appealing to a further context. \nThere is no final context that can be specified without referring to\nyet another context. For Nishida this relation would not be settled by invoking the notion of an infinite regress; rather it indicates the necessity of an ultimate context of a different order, one that allows the distinction between a specific text and its context. This ultimately unspecifiable context in\nNishida’s terms is called absolute nothingness.  The analysis of\nsuccessful physical theories provides yet another model. Each of\nNishida’s successive topoi serves as a level of analysis that resolves\ncontradictions on less comprehensive levels, as Einstein’s relativity\ntheory encompasses Newtonian theory and resolves contradictions in\nit. But for Nishida the final level that holds differences or\ncontradictions together is ultimately unanalyzable absolute\nnothingness. Despite Nishida’s relative ignorance of modern logic and\nhis identification of predicates with universals, we may also find\nparallels to his logic of place in mathematical logic: an axiomatic\nsystem is a topos that, according to Gödel’s theorem, is not\nself-explanatory or self-generating since it contains undecidable\npropositions, and there is no final system with a self-explanatory\nfoundation. Nishida’s absolute nothingness is the place beyond\ndiscursive determination. Discourse analysis also suggests parallels:\nit analyzes how a discourse is framed or directed to an audience with\ncertain interests, but the analysis too has its own frame that does\nnot terminate in any definitive or final frame.  Foundationalist\ntheories of knowledge and reality might seem to provide a model of\nNishida’s logic of place, but in Nishida the metaphor of grounding\ngives way to that of placing, locating, or encompassing, and in any case the ultimate\nplace is more an Abgrund or void than a positive ground. \n\nIt is clear that Nishida proposed his various topoi not as static\ncontexts terminating in an ultimate genus, but rather as a dynamic\nprocess of contextualization or world-formation. This always implied\nthe temporality of the “self-aware” world, and not merely\ntime as a dimension of the physical world.  Nevertheless, Nishida did\nnot explicitly take account of the historical nature of the world\nuntil the early 1930s, after his critics, in particular his younger\ncolleague, Tanabe Hajime, and his former students, Miki Kiyoshi and Tosaka Jun, turned his\nattention to the historical dimension of reality and human action. The\ncritics suggested that Nishida ignored the world determined by\nindividual human action by replacing individual human subjectivity\nwith trans-individual experience or consciousness and eventually\nshifting human agency to the world as a universal. In response,\nNishida began to articulate the world as a dialectical universal. The\nbasic idea is that the world is a place of mediation between acting\nindividuals. It is not a transcendent topos that one-sidedly\ndetermines individuals but a topos that arises with them through their\ncreative interactions. There are two sides of this idea to consider:\nthe world and the interacting individuals. \n\nWe conceptualize the formation of the world as history, but must think\nof history in terms of the logic of place and not simply as a temporal\nprocess. At any moment the world in process mirrors the indeterminacy or openness\nof absolute nothingness and contains the conditions for novelty and\nfuture possibilities; however it also encompasses everything that has\nalready been determined. In Nishida’s words, the historical world\nproceeds “from the created to the creating.” And it so\nproceeds not in a linear fashion, as if viewed from some point outside\nthe world, but rather “in” every moment or, conversely,\nout of an “eternal now” or “absolute present”\nthat describes the topos of its continual creation. This present in\nits absolute presence is the place where history can happen precisely\nbecause it enfolds the past, though is not entirely determined by the\npast, and it holds the future as infinite possibility. It is eternal or\nabsolute in the sense that it contains infinite time by negating\n(fixed) time (NKZ VIII, 76ff.). Viewed in terms of the absolute\npresent—the ever-present juncture between a determined past and\nan open future—the world appears as a “continuity of\ndiscontinuities.” \n\nSimilarly, we conceptualize the historical world sometimes as produced\nout of nature by human work and activity, sometimes as producing the\nindividuals who interact in it, but we should think of it primarily as\nthe mediating place of interactive creation. Individuals create their\nidentities through their interactions in the world, and that world is\ncontinually created with them.  (Nishida’s idea of a mediating place\nfinds a distant analogue in Einstein’s theory of gravitational space,\nwhere space is not independent of the physical objects in it but\nrather is shaped by them). The historical world forms itself through\nthe actions of embodied individuals who mutually form each other. Adapting a phenomenological perspective, Nishida argues that the historical world as the most concrete topos of our reality must be the starting point for understanding the more abstract world of life and even more abstract natural world. \n\nGradually Nishida came to recognize the importance of embodiment for\nhuman interaction and communication, and introduced the notion of the\nexpressive or historical body. The body is not primarily a physical\nobject and product of the natural world, but a historical subject and\nco-creator of the world. Insofar as the many historical bodies of the\none world differ from each another, they too form a\n“discontinuous continuity.” Nishida was fond of calling\nthis type of totality, which holds together differences without sublating\nthem into a higher unity, a “self-identity of contradictories.” \n\nTwo parts of Nishida’s theory deserve further explication: his novel\nconception of enactive intuition and his explanation of the relations\nbetween self & other and one & many. \n\nIn attempting to explain the formation and working of the historical\nworld, Nishida coined the term “action-oriented intuition” or “enactive intuition”\n(kōi-teki chokkan). His texts suggest a\nreciprocity between action and intuition, so that we could also speak\nof “intuition-oriented action” or simply of\n“action-intuition.”  Here again Nishida sought to discover the topos\nor common space that underlies a distinction, this time between\nintuition or seeing as a more or less passive reception of the world\nand its objects, and action as the human-engendered production of the\nworld. Hence, this is another case of his “self-identity of contradictories.” The common space is the enactive or performative\nintuition exemplified by artistic creation. \n\nFor example, we might ordinarily conceive of the\nartist as a pre-given entity who views, is inspired by, and utilizes\npre-given things in the world around her as she then goes about making\nher work. The production of the work would then be a causative process\ncontributing in turn to the production of the historical world. We\nmight also understand the work as an objectification of the artist, an\nexpression of her inner spirit that externalizes and actualizes\nit. Nishida envisioned an alternative, however. \n\nFor Nishida, the artist takes in or intuits\nthe world and transforms or enacts it, both of which are but two\nmoments in a single unfolding—not only of the world but of the\nartist as well.  Both artist and work are formed mutually and are\nreflected in one another. Whereas this mutual formation can be described\nin terms of a causative process taking time, with the person first\nintuiting or internalizing and then acting or externalizing, Nishida\ndescribed it in terms of the place or topos wherein intuiting entails\nacting and acting entails intuiting, and wherein the difference between\ninternal and external collapses. Granted, the work can take on a life\nof its own as an object of appreciation or criticism, but it always\ncarries its reference to the artist, as the identity of the artist\nlikewise cannot be separated from her work. \n\nArtistic creation is only\none example of such poiesis, as Nishida called\nit. Scientific experimentation also provides an example of enactive intuition insofar as experiments require the performance of a body acting and understanding through instruments (NKZ VIII, 326).  Enactive or performative intuition is operative in praxis or political-social action as well, insofar as it\ngrasps the world as including the self. Nishida emphasized that\nenactive intuition is a bodily achievement, the performance of an\nembodied individual who in turn is formed by the world; again, both\nbody and world must be conceived as historical.  While\nenactive intuition pertains to the dialectical way the\nindividual historical body forms and is formed by the world, the way\nthe world forms, once again, is described by the phrase “from the created to\nthe creating.” \n\nWe can shift the focus from the action of the individual historical\nbody to the interaction between distinct individuals, with\nthe world as the mediating space of mutual formation. In fact, Nishida\nmaintains that the individual, precisely as distinct, entails a plurality of\ninterrelated individuals.  The relation between “I and\nThou” was the first part that Nishida considered, although he\ncontinued to intertwine that relation with an internal relation in\nself-awareness.  Where his previous analysis of individual\nself-awareness described it as a self-reflection of the universal of\nself-awareness, his description now incorporated the dimension of\nrecognition. My recognition of you as not me makes me who I am, and\nyour recognition of me as not-you makes you who you are. Each is a\nrelative other to the self. \n\nThat Hegelian analysis is incomplete,\nhowever, without the recognition of the absolute other in the self’s\ninterior. This other, recalling Nishida’s notion of absolute, does not\nexclude the self; rather it constitutes self-identity as continually\nnegating what it has been. My personal self-awareness arises not when\nI recognize my identity through memory, for example, nor simply when I\nencounter an other I; rather it arises in experiencing the\ngroundlessness of my own existence, in recognizing what is absolutely\nother to a substantial self-same self. Recognizing the absolute other\nwithin constitutes not simply a reflexive self-awareness but a\nself-awakening, a realizing of the “true self.” \n\nNishida’s term for self-awareness is jikaku, which can also be translated as self-awakening, a Buddhist\nreading he undoubtedly intends.\nNishida allows for the Buddhist view that there is actually no self to\nawaken by referring to the self-awakening of absolute nothingness; its\nawakening is the awakening of the “true self.” Absolute\nnothingness in action, as it were, entails a negation (of a\nsubstantial, self-same self) and an affirmation (of the true self). In\nthe manner of self-negation, I am one with you while not being the\nsame as you. Not only between us does a “continuity of absolute\ndiscontinuities” obtain, but also within each of us, insofar as\nour identity is in continual formation. In the end, then, Nishida\ndenies the substantiality of the self, and he re-visions both  the radical\nalterity of other persons and the transcendence of an absolute other,\nin the guise of God for example, as we shall see. \n Eventually Nishida saw that the “I-You” relation does\nnot exhaust the discontinuous continuity of our being. We must also\ntake into account the third party, the relative\nother, “he” or “she,” who forms at least an implicit reference to every\n“I-you” interaction. Nishida seems intent not so much on\nexplaining alterity, however, as preserving interdependent\nindividuality, which of course still requires difference. He has in\nmind the individuation of all phenomena but begins with the prototype\nof individuality, the self-aware human person, who is more concretely\nan individual than other single living beings, not to speak of\nindividuated atoms or particles at the most abstract level. What\ndetermines individuality at the most concrete level is the one\nhistorical world that functions dialectically as the place or medium\nof interaction among innumerable individuals.  The world is one yet\nmany; individuals are many yet one in their mutual\ndetermination. (Nishida uses the Buddhist connective soku to\nindicate the relation between one and many and to emphasize their\ninherent reversibility. Soku translates roughly as “and at the same time”: “one and at the same time many”, “many and at the same time one.” Otherwise, however, his terminology in this part of his\nphilosophy is often more Hegelian than Buddhist.) \n\nNishida’s own formulations once again make\nuse of the pattern of an undifferentiated whole differentiating or\ndetermining itself, in this case as distinct individuals. Although the topological account of a self-determining or immanently determining historical world seems to invoke more spatial than temporal notions, the description of this topos as the space wherein individuals interact and mutually determine one another is meant to accommodate the temporal dimension as well.  The world is formed in conjunction with the individual embodied selves who interact in it; like Einstein’s space-time, it is not independent of the things “in” it and does not preexist them. But for Nishida the realization or awareness of individual selves entails the realization or awareness of the world as well. As mentioned earlier, the world too is “self-aware” (jikaku-teki) not only in the sense of being self-reflexive but also in the sense of realizing and recognizing itself via its individual selves who are its “focal points.”  Here we see another instance of Nishida’s way of universalizing first-person experience. In the discussions of the one and the\nmany, however, Nishida relatively neglected the notion of\nself-awakening––the other, Buddhist-tinged reading of jikaku\nthat is such an important part of the I-You relation. \n\nToward the end of his life, perhaps thinking of the significance of\ndeath for understanding individuality, perhaps re-considering the\ntheme of self-awakening as a kind of death and re-birth, Nishida\ndelved deeper into the relation between the individual finite human\nself and the absolute or God. In his view, this relation logically\ndefines the place of religion. Experientially it comes to the fore in\ndeath. We will consider the meaning of death first, then the nature of\nGod or the absolute in relation to the finite self. \n\nThe theme of personal death is absent in Nishida’s early work on pure\nexperience and self-awareness, and mentioned only abstractly in essays\non the historical world and the self, for example: “In absolute\ndialectics, mediation as absolute negation is mediation as absolute\ndeath, living by dying absolutely” (NKZ VII, 314). In the last\ncompleted essay, “The Logic of Place and the Religious\nWorldview” (1945), Nishida is more experiential. Death is not an\nevent at the end of one’s life but penetrates life at each and every\nmoment. It is the ever-present opening, so to speak, where one’s utter\nfinitude can come to light. Insofar as this is the finitude of the\nindividual self, it also implies a logic of individuation where the\nrole of other relative selves is diminished. “I am myself by\nknowing my own death” (NKZ XI, 420) is both a declaration of\nexistential self-awareness and a statement of what makes me uniquely\nme. What makes me an individual is not merely my differences from\nothers nor my sameness with some essential core; it is precisely what\nmost makes me not me, what negates me, in any moment\nof action. In this context, death signifies the self-negation of the\nfinite self. \n\nIf death is an ever-present opening, the other side of that opening, so\nto speak, is the absolute. To die is to stand vis-à-vis the\nabsolute. In the discussion of the “I-You” relation, this\nterm appeared as the absolute other in one’s interior; here it shifts\nto the absolute in contradistinction to finite beings. Nishida calls\nit God as well, but makes clear that he is not referring to a\npersonal, transcendent being. If transcendence is involved, it is a\ngoing beyond by going within. He also implies that it is not\nsynonymous with absolute nothingness. If relative nothingness as opposed to\nbeing is implied, it is in the verbal sense of self-negating. The\nabsolute “lives” through its own self-negation and inclusion of the\nrelative self. It does not die in the sense that relative beings do,\nfor it embraces all others whereas they, by being individual, exclude\nothers. God cannot be wholly transcendent to or exclusive of the\nself or the world. Even Nishida’s early work, An Inquiry Into the\nGood , had spoken of God in a way that undermined the notion of a\ntranscendent being outside the world; it conceived of God as the\ninfinite activity of unification at work behind the articulations of\nspirit and nature out of pure experience.  \n\nIn his final essay, Nishida\nadmits that his notion of an absolute totally embracing the relative,\neven in its diabolical forms, is more in tune with a Mahayana Buddhist\ntradition than with the Christian sources that also inspired him. To\nexpress the relation between a God and the relative finite self,\nNishida introduces a new term, “inverse correlation”(gyaku taiō). This relation is another instance of\nopposites held together in a unity, a kind of “self-identity of\ncontradictories,” but this time not a symmetrical one. The more\none faces one’s death, the negation of one’s life as an individual,\nthe more acutely one is self-aware as an individual. The closer the\nfinite self approaches God, the stronger the difference between them\nbecomes. This peculiar kind of relation implies that God and the\nrelative self are inseparable but asymmetrically co-dependent. God or the absolute embraces and never excludes the human or relative, and the relative self never coincides with or dissolves into God. Nishida’s inverse correlation is perhaps comparable to some theological notions of non-reciprocal dependence, where for example it is said that God is my being yet I am not God’s being. But in Nishida’s case, insofar as the distinction entails an undifferentiated source of their\ndifference, an absolute nothingness, the more that source is\ncontacted the stronger the distinction holds.  \n\nNishida’s discussion of the absolute and the finite self does not\nneglect the notion of religion and its relation to culture and the\nnation-state. These themes already formed an integral part of his\ntheory of the historical world, but became all the more pressing in a\ntime of world war. The concern with death was perhaps as much a\npolitical as a personal matter for Nishida, whose health in 1945 was quickly\nfailing. In one respect, he distanced himself from his milieu, where\neveryday life was dominated by an authoritarian state. In his last completed essay, he focuses on\nthe individual in relation to an absolute that in no way is subject to\nan absolutist state. His notion of the essentiality of religion is\nremarkably individualistic, removed from all social contingencies. He\nlocates the core of religion in the heart of the individual: religious\nawareness arises in one’s knowing one’s own death. \n\nOn the other hand, Nishida recognizes that religion is a social and\ncultural phenomenon, and that the contemporary individual is a subject\nof a state. He seems however to reverse any implied priority of\nculture over religion and state over individual: it is because culture\nis religious in its core that we find religion in every culture; and\nobedience to the nation must be based on true religious awareness. To\nbe sure, writing under a totalitarian government in 1945, Nishida\ncouches his statements carefully in language that would deter his\nimprisonment on grounds of lèse majesté. He also says,\nfor example, that insofar as the individual self is historically\nformed it must be understood as a nationally identified self; and\nfurther that it is selfish merely to seek one’s own peace of mind. In\nthe end, Nishida remains ambiguous about the extent to which\nindividuals are, or should be, formed by the will of the state, and\nwhether religion can or should criticize the state or society. \n\nTo say that culture is essentially religious means that it, too, is an\n“affirmation of the self-negating absolute” (NKZ XI,\n458). Religion and culture are each framed in the singular here, as\nsomething essential to all religions and cultures in the plural. At\nthis level culture and religion function almost as regulative\nideas. They are not the result but the telos of the one world forming\nits self-identity. Nishida’s formulations recapitulate much of his\ntheory of the historical world.  As the various ethnic peoples in the\nworld become aware of themselves as constituents of a global world,\nthat is, as they become “world-historical” nations, they\nmirror the formation of the historical world. As self-aware and globally historical, the world will be mirrored\nvariously in each nation. \n\nIf we hear Hegelian echoes in these formulations, we should also\nnote Nishida’s difference from Hegel: the formation of the\n“world-historical” world does not imply a hierarchy of\ncultures evolving as forms of increasing rationality; and it is\nexemplified in the everyday, as Nishida says, not the\nexceptional. Nishida’s global world seems more open to a genuine\npluralism of cultures, world religions and national identities. Each\ncan retain its uniqueness but to do so each must become self-aware by\nbecoming aware of the plurality, by relativizing or negating itself.\nThis self-negation creates the space in which true intercultural\nencounter can take place. Nishida implies that the proper relation\nbetween cultures is parallel to that between “I and Thou.”\nIn simpler language: “A true world culture will be formed only\nby various cultures preserving their own respective viewpoints, but\nsimultaneously developing themselves through global mediation”\n(NKZ VII, pp. 452–3). \n\nNevertheless a special place is accorded the nation of Japan. The\nJapanese nation is in a position to foster not only an awareness of\nthe East but also a global awareness on the part of every nation. For\nJapan is the nation in Asia that has best retained Asian traditions\nwhile adapting Western technology and values. In the new world order\nJapan can stand for Asia, and stand against the domination of the\nWest.  Nishida’s language, perhaps deliberately ambiguous to avoid his\nincarceration, ostensibly wavers as to whether this special mission\ndescribes Japan’s calling, what it can be for the world, or refers to\nits current practice in its war-time struggle with other nations. A\ncharitable reading of Nishida’s statements on the special place of\nJapan interprets them as advocating that his country overcome its\noutdated vision of itself as a colonizing nation, and embrace a global\nconception of itself as a nation interacting with other nations in a\nworld of mutually defining\n equals.[4] \n A more critical reading interprets these statements as falsely\nabsolutizing the particular nation of Japan, suggesting that\nJapan embraces other nations of the East which is abstractly\nopposed to the West. Similar challenges face us in the\ntwenty-first century not only in a world of continuing imperialism and contesting nations with different religious and cultural traditions, but also in single nations\nof multicultural composition. \n\nNishida composed essays on interrelated themes rather than sequential\nand tightly edited books. Major essays were subsequently collected and\npublished as books, but often do not form chapters of a single\ncoherent work. Instead of investigating a problem in a series of\nstraightforward linear arguments, he tended to write in spirals that\nkept circling back on previous formulations and reworking them in new\ncontexts. His style is akin to the manner in which one repeatedly\npractices a traditional Japanese art like calligraphy, poetry or even\nZen mediation: working at a particular activity or expression, getting\nbetter and better at it without erasing one’s previous attempts. It is\npossible, however, to discern four methods that pervade his philosophy\nand make it easier for the reader to follow the train of his\nthought. \n\nFirst is Nishida’s way of taking the more inclusive as the more\nconcrete, and the more restricted as the more abstract. This makes\nsense insofar as abstraction involves removal of parts, but Nishida\nalso uses this method to reverse the usual order of things in\nexplanatory schemas or hierarchies. As mentioned earlier, the historical world lived by\nhuman beings, for example, is more concrete than the material world\nstudied by physics since the historical, human world comprehends (in\nboth senses of the word) the merely physical and can never be reduced\nto it. Between these two worlds is the biological realm of life\nforms, less concrete than the human world but more concrete than the\nphysical world. \n\nSecond is Nishida’s recourse to the explanatory schema of wholes that\nreflect themselves in their parts. Here Nishida adapts the idea of\nself-representative systems presented in Josiah Royce and in Richard\nDedekind’s idea of an infinite system reflected in its parts. For\nNishida, if there are no parts outside a whole, its evident\ndifferentiation must be explained.  After his first major book, An\nInquiry into the Good, Nishida came to explain this\ndifferentiating development not in terms of a temporal process but as\nthe self-reflective or self-mirroring structure of a whole. Knowledge,\nfor example, is not a matter of two disparate realities, a knowing\nmind and a known object, conforming to one another, but a single\nconcrete reality that “reflects itself in itself” on\ndiffering levels that give rise to the more abstract notions of\nknowing subject and known objects. And after Nishida described\nself-awareness (jikaku) as the activity of self reflecting\nitself within itself, he came to speak of other structural wholes,\nincluding place or topos and even the world itself, as\n“self-aware” (jikaku-teki) insofar as they\nreflected themselves within themselves. \n\nThird is\nNishida’s way of elaborating this “within” in terms of\nenfolding or enwrapping, as a whole enfolds or contains parts that\npartially reflect it , or as the universal of color encompasses that of\nred, for example.  Nishida also referred to more limited realms as\nparticularizations or “self-determinations” of more\ninclusive realms, but he often used the metaphor of wrapping to\ndescribe the manner of determination. The ultimate universal or\nenfolding whole has no determinate features; it is\n“nothingness” (mu). \n\nThe fourth method is Nishida’s way of treating oppositions and\ndistinctions, emphasizing alternatively their undifferentiated ground\nor their irreducible relation. He often sought to return (not reduce) oppositions\nand distinctions to the non-differentiated condition that underlies\nthem, ultimately to the nothingness that gives rise to (or determines\nitself as) various distinctions. Although terms translating as\n“ground” or “foundation” are found throughout\nhis works, this emphasis undermines any recourse to a founding\nprinciple or entity wholly transcendent to, and thus ultimately\ndifferent from, the world or reality. “Absolute\nnothingness” may be understood as the lack of any positively\ndefinable transcendent ground. When for example Nishida writes\n“absolute nothingness transcends all that is, but at the same\ntime all that is arises through it” (NKZ IX, 6), we may\ninterpret him as pointing to an undifferentiated source beyond the\ndistinctions it gives rise to, a source that is necessarily entailed\nby their being brought together precisely as distinct from one\nanother. \n\nThe emphasis on relation similarly undermines any attempt to reduce\nopposed or distinguished terms to some element common to both. In mid\ncareer Nishida used the language of dialectics to describe relations,\nwhile insisting that the opposed terms were not sublated into a higher\nunity. Later he used expressions like “the self-identity of\nabsolute contradictories” to describe the way in which opposed\nterms are held together, the many and the one for example. His notion\nof an “inverse correlation” also reflects this method.\nNishida’s emphasis on relation modifies his notion of self-reflective\nstructures to make it clear that they maintain difference within a\nwhole and are not simply self-replicating or recursive. This is\nnoticeable in his last essay, for example, when he describes\nindividual selves as focal points where world reflects itself in\nitself (NKZ XI, 378). His rejection of a positive foundation or\nsubstratum, and his insistence on irreducible but inseparable terms in\nrelation, explain why the holistic tendency evident in his methodology\ndoes not devolve into a simple monism, and why many commentators refer\nto his philosophy as non-dualist instead. \n\nA grasp of both the unity and the development of Nishida’s thought is\nalso crucial to understanding it. As should be obvious, Nishida’s\nthought underwent extensive changes over the course of four\ndecades. Less evident is that the varying themes are united by a\ndeepening of the same basic insights. The Preface to the third volume\nof his Philosophical Essays published in 1939 gives us his\nown view of the unity of his progression: “It is said that that\nI repeatedly discuss the same problems, and [indeed] from An\nInquiry into the Good on, my objective has been to see things and\nthink things from the most direct and fundamental standpoint—to\ngrasp all things from the standpoint of whence they come and whither\nthey go” (NKZ IX, 3). A Preface written three years earlier to\nthe reprint of An Inquiry into the Good identifies some of\nthe crucial connections in the changing thematic: the standpoint of\npure experience articulated in that maiden work developed into that of\nabsolute will, and later into the notion of place or topos,\nconcretized further as a dialectical universal, which in turn gets\nexpressed as action-intuition. “That which I called...the\nworld of pure experience I have now come to think of as the world of\nhistorical reality. The world of enactive intuition—the world of\npoiesis—is none other than the world of pure experience”\n(Nishida 1990, xxxiii). \n\nSince Nishida composed his essays in a language and for a culture that\nhad known philosophy as a distinct discipline for little more than\nhalf a century, his view of that discipline is equally crucial for\nunderstanding the unity and progression of his thought. Although his\nview likewise evolved over the course of his life, it reveals one\nabiding feature: philosophy should be not only the articulation but\nalso the awareness of the most fundamental unities of experience,\nknowledge, action, and ultimately self and world. \n\nRelatively early in\nhis career, when he was still under the sway of Fichte, the\nNeo-Kantians, and Bergson, he defined philosophy as science\n[gakumon], i.e. unified conceptual knowledge, more\nspecifically the first and universal science that “reflects on\nthe basic concepts of the particular sciences in general and\nconstructs of them one system of knowledge.” Yet “its\nobject of study is not simply the fundamental concepts of\nreality. Basic normative notions such as truth, goodness and beauty\nmust of course enter into philosophical study. Philosophy not only\nclarifies basic notions of reality, but must also elucidate the ideals\nof human life, the ‘ought’ itself. Philosophy is not\nsimply a worldview; it is a view of human life.” Within his\nextended definition Nishida, commenting on Bergson, clarifies the role\nof intuition so crucial to his own thought: “‘intuition’ as\nsuch cannot be called philosophy. Even if its contents can derive from\nintuition, philosophy has its raison d’être when intuition takes\nthe form of conceptual knowledge.” (NKZ 13, 254). \n\nThen, later in his career, Nishida paradoxically formed concepts of the\nlimits of such knowledge and formulated his philosophy of absolute\nnothingness that is ultimately mirrored in self-awareness. Such\nawareness became a task for philosophy or, more specifically, for the\nphilosopher. Throughout his life Nishida’s own practice of philosophy\nattempted to realize an abiding insight expressed in the various\nterms he recounts in the Preface cited above.  In that sense his\nthought is systematic, while not forming a closed system. It is a\nconsistent attempt to re-conceptualize philosophy, to reframe the\nterms in which many philosophers think about self and world. This is, in part, \nwhat is meant by saying that Nishida would have us think from the\nperspective of the world rather than the “I.” \n\nMany readers of Nishida have attempted to delineate stages in the\ndevelopment of his philosophy (Elberfeld 1999, 71ff.); others have\nrejected a division into discrete stages (Heisig 2001,\n104). As a heuristic approach to a summary of his thought, we may broadly\ndistinguish three stages. The first is defined by an overwhelming\nconviction that concrete reality is at base unitary and can be\narticulated from the standpoint of consciousness. We have seen that\nNishida successively names its most basic form  “pure\nexperience,” “self-awareness,” and “absolute\nfree will.” Each of these exemplifies the fundamental reality\nfrom which all else becomes manifest through a process of\ndifferentiation. In An Inquiry Into the Good (1911), pure\nexperience describes the primal undifferentiated form that\nsubsequently dirempts into differentiated forms: experiencing subject\nand experienced objects, intellectual intuition and reflective\nthought, objectified nature and objectifying spirit—all on their\nway to a higher unity.  Intuition and Reflection in\nSelf-Awareness (1917) shifts that idealistic description to\nepistemological questions. It explicates self-awareness as the form in\nwhich reflection and immediate experience or intuition are unified, that is,\nthe form that reflects itself within itself and gives rise not only to\ndifferentiating judgments but to differently experienced systems such\nas spirit and matter and to “worlds” such as art and\nreligion.  Eventually Nishida proposes that the most basic form of\nself-awareness is not a kind of knowing at all, but a willing or\n“absolute free will” evident in valuing and creating. He\ndevelops this proposal in Problems of Consciousness (1920)\nand Art and Morality (1923).  Nishida later said his first attempts, formulated from the standpoint of consciousness,\ninvited the charges of psychologism (Nishida 1990, xxxi), and\nmysticism (Nishida 1987, xxiii), and so he abandoned the language of pure\nexperience and absolute will. It is clear, however, that his initial\nconvictions persisted a good deal longer: the most concrete form of\nreality is undifferentiated, and consciousness as the manifestation of\nreality is inseparable from it. \n\nThe second stage, broadly speaking, is defined by the standpoint of\nplace or topos (basho). This involves the attempts to\narticulate levels of differentiation and place them in more and more\ninclusive circles (to use one of Nishida’s metaphors) until one\nreaches the most concrete and comprehensive circle, a circle without\ncircumference whose center is everywhere.  Nishida calls each such\ncircle a place or topos, each alloowing things to be and to be seen as\nwhat they are. The final topos places self-awareness in the world of\naction and expression which contextualizes it, and ultimately in\nabsolute nothingness. Nishida refers to the ultimate topos, alluding to\nBuddhist doctrine, as “the form of the formless,” clearly\nreplacing earlier attempts to describe the basic form of concrete\nreality in positive and subjectivistic terms such as pure experience and absolute free will, This stage is evident in essays\nin From That Which Acts to That Which Sees (1927) and The\nSelf-aware System of Universals (1930), and extends to much of\nThe Self-aware Determination of Nothingness (1932). A\nHegelian language of dialectics gradually became more and more\nprominent in his formulations, as he turned his attention to the place\nof individuals interacting in the world. He wrote of individuals as\nthe “self-determinations” of the universal of\nself-awareness; and of absolute nothingness as a dialectical\nuniversal. \n\nThe third stage sharpens the focus on the dialectical world as a place\nof mediation between interacting individuals as historically embodied\nselves. Nishida now conceptualizes the world as the historical\nmanifestation of absolute nothingness. This stage represents what is\nfor Nishida the most comprehensive and concrete standpoint, that of\nthe historical world. The world unfolds “from the created to the\ncreating,” not in a straightforward linear progression but out\nof an “absolute present” that in each moment holds\ntogether past determinations and decisions for the future. The\nhistorical world as such is a “self-identity of\ncontradictories.” The self realizes itself not in knowing itself\nas distinct from other selves or things but through forms of\nself-negation. One form calls for the self to recognize the absolute\nother in its own core to relate truly to the Thou or other relative\nselves. Another form calls for one to give oneself over to things or\n“become one with” the things it would know—through\n“enactive intuition,” seeing them by interacting with them\nand interacting by allowing them to transform oneself. In this\nstage relations come to the fore: the relations between I and Thou,\nthe one and the many, the expressive self and its expressions, the\nJapanese nation and other nations. Each of these relations constitutes\na self-identity of contradictories and resists a monistic\ninterpretation. This stage, understood heuristically, stretches from\nthe final essays in The Self-aware Determination of\nNothingness through The World of Action and The\nDialectical World (collected as The Fundamental\nProblems of Philosophy, 1934), seven volumes of Philosophical\nEssays (1935–45) and several political writings, on to Nishida’s last\nessay, “The Logic of Place and the Religious\nWorldview”(1945). The final essay returns to the theme of\nreligious awareness and makes more explicit the Buddhist references,\nas well as the Christian influence, latent in much of Nishida’s\nphilosophy. The focus on death and finitude, while consistent with the\nidea of self-negation, suggests a shift of standpoint, but Nishida’s\nfinal reflections are too brief to be called a new stage in his\nphilosophy. \n\nBecause Nishida throughout his career cited Western philosophers far\nmore often than Asian sources, it is easy to read his thought as an\nongoing engagement with problems that have their origin in Western\ntraditions.  In addressing the concerns of Western thinkers he\nfollowed the path taken by nearly all Japanese professors of\nphilosophy since the inception of the academic discipline in the\n1880s. Yet his appropriation of ideas from Asian philosophies is also\nevident to the discerning reader, if more by way of allusion and\naffinity than by direct citation. It was not always necessary for him\nto name his Asian sources as explicitly, for he could appeal to the\ngeneral education of Japanese readers who would be familiar with the\nclassics of Asia and with the convention of appropriating ideas\nwithout directly referring to them. While commentators have long\npointed out the debt of Nishida to Zen Buddhist practice and thought,\nthey have only recently begun to identify other Asian sources of his\nphilosophy by researching his vast library in Asian languages\n(Dalissier 2009b).  In retrospect, it is clear that all along Nishida\nwas infusing Western philosophy with Asian thought far more\npervasively than the few references to Buddhism above might indicate. \n\nIn general, we can discern two ways that Nishida made use of Asian\nsources: anecdotally and systematically. Nishida’s writings are strewn\nwith unacknowledged quotations or paraphrases of verses in classical\nChinese sources, as well as allusions that may or may not identify\ntheir source in Indian, Chinese, or Japanese literature. This sort of\nallusion is anecdotal.  Unobtrusively placed in the current of a\ndiscussion on a particular issue, the anecdotal allusions serve to\nclarify an idea, to provide a concrete example, or to insert a playful\nturn of phrase into otherwise ponderous prose.  One example is the\npassage in the early work, Intuition and Reflection in\nSelf-Consciousness, where Nishida argues that the will of the\nindividual can freely express absolute will as the creative activity\nof the universe when the individual will operates spontaneously,\nwithout reflection or objectification.  Nishida inserts a saying from\nthe Zen Buddhist Record of Linji in the middle of a sentence\nto express this undivided spontaneity: “To think of the infinite\nbehind the finite, or of noumenon behind actuality, is to enter the\nrealm of objectified knowledge.  In the immediate, lived experience of\nwilling, however, the finite is immediately infinite, actuality is\nimmediately noumenon, one walks when needing to walk and sits when\nneeding to sit, and there is no interval for conceptual\nanalysis” (NKZ II, 299; see Nishida 1987b, 147). Nishida also\nincorporates Confucian phrases, often without identifying them as\nsuch. In his first book, An Inquiry Into the Good, for\nexample, arguing that logical reasons are often not sufficient to\nmotivate good conduct, he alludes to a maxim of Confucius: “The\nsaying Do not do unto others what you would not have others do\nunto you, is nearly meaningless without the motivation of\nsympathy” (Nishida 1990, 113; NKZ I, 132). \n\nNishida makes use of Asian philosophies systematically both in key\nnotions such as nothingness and in the methods that\ncharacterize his thinking.  The notion of absolute nothingness recalls\nIndian ideas as well as Chinese Daoist and Buddhist\nexpressions. Indeed, Nishida once suggested that we can distinguish\ntraditional Eastern and Western philosophies by the East’s\nprioritizing of nothingness and the West’s reliance on being (NKZ VII,\n429–30; Nishida 1970b, 237). He explicitly mentions the profound idea\nof nothingness developed in Indian religion (Nishida 1970b, 239), and\nwe can find a precedent to his notion of absolute nothingness as beyond\nbeing and nonbeing in the Hymn of Creation in book ten of the Rg\nVeda: “nonbeing existed not, nor being”\n(Radhakrishnan 1957, 23). Nishida also had in mind the Chinese Daoist\nclassics attributed to Laozi and Zhuangzi, where “the Way (or\nDao) was clearly said to be ‘nonbeing’” (Nishida\n1970b, 242). The Japanese term Nishida uses is mu\n(wu in Chinese), a sinogram that in Chinese literature\nusually functions simply as a negation of being or having and in this\nrespect fails to convey Nishida’s full sense of nothingness that does\nnot reduce to a lack of being. Nevertheless, philosophical Daoist\nliterature provided a precedent that Nishida could draw upon. In\nchapter 40 of Laozi’s Daodejing we find the statement,\n“The myriad things are born from being. Being is born from\nnonbeing.” Reminiscent of Nishida’s absolute nothingness as a\ncreative source, the Daodejing refers to the generative power\nof nonbeing and to the non-nameable Dao or Way that gives rise to the\nmyriad things. One source suggestive of Nishida’s sense of absolute\nnothingness as the most inclusive and undifferentiated place is the text\nknown by its legendary author’s name, the Zhuangzi. It refers to\na Dao that has never known boundaries but preserves the possibility of\ndistinctions. Taken up by Chinese Buddhism, wu not only\nreferred to non-existence but also served as a variant of the Mahayana\nBuddhist notion of emptiness (śūnyatā), a\nnegation of the self-subsistence of individual beings and an\naffirmation of their interdependence. Nishida drew upon such Buddhist\nand Daoist precedents in formulating his critique of substantialist\nmetaphysics and his notion of absolute nothingness as an\nall-encompassing, ultimate frame of reference that is creative yet not\ntranscendent to the world. \n\nSystematic use of Asian philosophies is also apparent in Nishida’s\nmethods. Where his arguments seek higher forms of inclusion rather\nthan rejection of opposing views, he harks back to Chinese Buddhist\nschemes of explanation that absorb and contextualize rival doctrines\nrather than exclude them. Nishida’s manner of contextualizing, in his\ntheory of place or topos, draws from Chinese cosmological methods in\nwhich “to explain and infer is to locate within the\npattern” (Graham 1989, 320; cited in Dalissier 2009b,\n226). Yogacara Buddhist theories of consciousness as the primary\nreality and explanatory principle most likely influenced Nishida’s\ntendency in his early works to explain all reality in terms of\nconsciousness. Later, his way of unifying opposites and defining\nthings in terms of self-negation adapts a\nBuddhist prajñapāramitā logic of negation,\nin which individuated terms entail their negation and are understood\nas co-relational rather than exclusive. \n\nBut the reader of Nishida can find resonances with certain Asian philosophical ideas even when Nishida did not make use of them. Even where there is no evidence of direct influence, the affinity of\nsome key notions and arguments with classical Indian Buddhist ideas is\nstriking. It is possible, for example, to read Nishida’s development of\nthe three topoi or places of being, relative nothingness, and absolute\nnothingness, as a deepening of awareness that resembles the\nprogression of awareness, described in many Buddhist schemes, where one first sees through the realm of desire, then through the\nrealm of forms, and finally awakens to the formless realm beyond discrimination (Stevens\n2009, 71). Also suggestive of the convictions underlying Nishida’s\nphilosophy are arguments of the Mādhyamaka school of\nNāgārjuna pressing for the relationality of all existents,\nand exhortations to appreciate the “groundlessless of\nthings” in the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa Sūtra\n(Priest 2009, 472). We might also recognize distant affinities—and related significant differences—between Nishida’s notion of reality (the world) itself becoming self-aware and pre-Buddhist Indian Vedanta, or its later development, non-dual Advaita Vedanta.  Where some Vedantic texts equate reality with Brahman and assert that “awareness is Brahman” (prajñānaṁbrahma, Aitareya Upanishad 3.3), “I am Brahman” (ahaṁbrahmāsmi, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.10), or “You are That” (tat tvam asi, Chandogya Upanishad 6.8.7), meaning your true self is identical with ultimate reality, Nishida places a caesura—his “inverse correlation”—in the equation of relative human self and the Absolute.  Yet when Nishida urges us to “see the self from the standpoint of the world,” he suggests a kind of phenomenological bracketing or epoché of the “I”—of the Ichdoxa—that resonates with the intentions of these Vedantic expressions.  That implied suggestion and its challenge to both Vedantic thought and Husserlian phenomenology, however, remain to be explored in the growing literature on Nishida’s philosophy.     \n  Criticisms of Nishida’s thought were a significant part of its\ndevelopment during his lifetime, and continue to this day to inform\ndebates about its meaning and relevance. Insofar as Nishida aimed at a\ncomprehensive “system of self-awareness” (Nishida 1987b,\n70)––ultimately the system of absolute nothingness\ndetermining itself as the historical world––his philosophy\nseems to preclude the possibility of radical internal critique. Nishida\ndid not envision his system as closed to development or to an open\nfuture. But several key notions that he never abandoned leave scant\nroom for acknowledging gaps: the notions of a\nuniversal that reflects itself clearly if not completely in its\nparticulars, of a world that mirrors itself in its individuals, of\nmore inclusive topoi that fully envelop less inclusive topoi, or of an\nabsolute that is immanent in all relative selves. How does such a\nsystem account for fallibility, unpredictability, distortion or\nviolence? And where does the author Nishida stand in relation to the\nsystem that he describes. Is the author too merely a reflection of the\nsystem? \nIn contrast to interpreting Nishida’s thought as presenting a system\nthat would preempt problems, one can also read it as a series of\nattempts to clarify for himself the activity of living a philosophical\nlife. From this perspective, critique appears as a constant feature of\nNishida’s personal development. During his lifetime Nishida took his\ncritics seriously and sometimes changed course because of their\ncriticisms. Takahashi Satomi, while still a graduate student at the\nUniversity of Tokyo, criticized Nishida’s notion of pure experience\nand spurred him to clarify it in an article published soon after\nAn Inquiry Into the Good. His colleague at Kyoto University,\nSōda Kiichiro, criticized the lack of clarity in his initial\nformulation of basho (place) in 1926 and prompted him to\nremove Neo-Kantian comparisons. More significantly, in the early 1930s\nhis younger colleague Tanabe Hajime and his former student and Marxist\nphilosopher Tosaka Jun criticized Nishida’s focus on consciousness and lack\nof attention to history and social being; Nishida subsequently\ndeveloped his notions of the historical world and the historical\nbody. In the last years of his life, he seemed to anticipate his death\nand recognize human finitude more strongly as an inevitable disruption\nof any comprehensive systematic account. Two years before his death in\n1945, he wrote, “Our life and our existence are not our\nown. They are the determinations of absolute nothingness…. Philosophy\nbegins with the self set on living truly. It is a way for the self to\nbecome self-aware and to live” (NKZ 10, 401,\n 472).[5] \n Nishida’s philosophy continues to live in the profusion of critical\nengagements indicated in the list of secondary literature below.  \n\nNishida is often called the father of the Kyoto School of philosophy\nbecause of his influence on a group of thinkers who were his students\nor younger colleagues. Best known outside Japan are his colleague and\ncritic, Tanabe Hajime, frequently considered the School’s co-founder,\nand his student Nishitani Keiji. As a “school” the group\ncomprises a rather fuzzy set that includes Marxist-leaning former\nstudents such as Miki Kiyoshi and Tosaka Jun, more nationalistic\nstudents like Kōyama Iwao and Kōsaka Masaaki, and lesser\nknown but close disciples like Mutai Risaku and Shimomura\nToratarō. Other colleagues, students and friends on the fringes of the\nSchool proper nevertheless show the impact of Nishida’s ideas: the Zen\nBuddhist scholar-teachers D. T. Suzuki and Hisamatsu Shin’ichi, the\nethical theorist Watsuji Tetsurō, and Kuki Shūzō, the\ninterpreter of Japanese aesthetics and culture. A third generation of\nthe School includes Tanabe’s student Takeuchi Yoshinori, Nishitani’s\nstudent Ueda Shizuteru and Hisamatsu’s student Abe Masao, who have\nbeen especially effective in introducing Nishida’s philosophy in\nEurope and North America and in applying Nishida’s thought to\ninter-religious Buddhist-Christian dialogue. \n\nNishida’s investigations inspired current\ninterpretations of Mahayana Buddhism, just as his thought was influenced\nby Buddhist ideas. For many people, his explication of pure\nexperience and self-awareness re-interprets Zen awakening; his\nintertwining of self and world develops the Buddhist teaching of\nco-dependent origination; and his philosophy of nothingness\narticulates the notion of emptiness and the experience of mu\n(nothing). His philosophy has also presented to his Buddhist and\nChristian readers serious challenges, such as a notion of a non-dual\nrelation between God and man, and an emphasis, unusual in Buddhism, on\nthe embodied self in the historical world.   Nishida’s logic of place has been a resource for theoreticians\nworking in various scientific fields, for example Imanishi Kinji in\nbiology and ecology, Shimizu Hiroshi in complexity theory and\ninformation science, Nonaka Ikujiro in management theory, and Ko Hojo\nin the philosophy of chemistry. The architect Ando Tadao, and artists\nlike the calligrapher Morita Shiryū have also drawn from\nNishida’s philosophy, as has the psychotherapist Kimura Bin.\nUltimately, Nishida himself is best considered an independent thinker,\nas the growing literature in Japanese and Western languages\nattests.","contact.mail":"jmaraldo@unf.edu","contact.domain":"unf.edu"}]
