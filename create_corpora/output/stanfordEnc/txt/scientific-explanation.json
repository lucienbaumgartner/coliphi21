However, modern discussion really begins with the development\nof the Deductive-Nomological (DN) model. This model has had\nmany advocates (including Popper 1959, Braithwaite 1953, Gardiner,\n1959, Nagel 1961) but unquestionably the most detailed and influential\nstatement is due to Carl Hempel (1942, 1965a, and Hempel & Oppenheim 1948).\nThese papers and the reaction to them have structured subsequent\ndiscussion concerning scientific explanation to an extraordinary\ndegree. After some general remarks by way of background and\norientation\n (Section 1),\n this entry describes the DN model and its extensions, and\nthen turns to some well-known objections\n (Section 2).\n It next describes a variety of subsequent attempts to develop\nalternative models of explanation, including Wesley Salmon’s\nStatistical Relevance\n (Section 3)\n and Causal Mechanical\n (Section 4)\n models, Unificationist models due to Michael Friedman and\nPhilip Kitcher\n (Section 5),\n and Pragmatic theories found in the work of van Fraassen\n (Section 6).\n Section 7 provides a summary and discusses directions for future\nwork. This article thus discusses treatments of scientific explanation\nup to the end of the twentieth century. \n\nAs will become apparent, “scientific explanation” is a\ntopic that raises a number of interrelated issues. Some background\norientation will be useful before turning to the details of competing\nmodels. A presupposition of most recent discussion has been that\nscience sometimes provides explanations (rather than something that\nfalls short of explanation—e.g., “mere description”)\nand that the task of a “theory” or “model” of\nscientific explanation is to characterize the structure of such\nexplanations. It is thus assumed that there is (at some suitably\nabstract and general level of description) a single kind or form of\nexplanation that is “scientific”. In fact, the notion of\n“scientific explanation” suggests at least two\ncontrasts—first, a contrast between those\n“explanations” that are characteristic of\n“science” and those explanations that are not, and,\nsecond, a contrast between “explanation” and something\nelse. However, with respect to the first contrast, much of the recent\nphilosophical literature assumes that there is substantial continuity\nbetween explanations found in science and some forms of explanation\nfound in ordinary, non-scientific contexts. It is further assumed that\nit is the task of a theory of explanation to capture what is common to\nboth scientific and some ordinary, non-scientific forms of\nexplanation. These assumptions help to explain (what may otherwise\nstrike the reader as curious) why, as this entry will illustrate,\ndiscussions of scientific explanation often move back and forth\nbetween examples drawn from bona-fide science (e.g., explanations of\nthe trajectories of the planets that appeal to Newtonian mechanics)\nand more homey examples (e.g., the tipping over of inkwells). \nWith respect to the second contrast, most models of explanation assume\nthat it is possible for a set of claims to be true, accurate,\nsupported by evidence, and so on and yet unexplanatory. For example,\nall of the accounts of scientific explanation described below would\nagree that an account of the appearance of a particular species of\nbird of the sort found in a bird guidebook is, however accurate, not\nan explanation of anything of interest to biologists (such as the\ndevelopment, characteristic features, or behavior of that species).\nInstead, such an account is “merely descriptive”. However,\ndifferent models of explanation provide different accounts of what the\ncontrast between the explanatory and merely descriptive consists\nin. \nA related point is that, while most theorists of scientific\nexplanation have proposed models that are intended to cover at least\nsome cases of explanation that we would not think of as part of\nscience, they have nonetheless assumed some implicit restriction on\nthe kinds of explanation they have sought to reconstruct. It has often\nbeen noted that the word “explanation” is used in a wide\nvariety of ways in ordinary English—we speak of explaining the\nmeaning of a word, explaining how to bake a pie, explaining why one\nmade a certain decision (where this is to offer a justification) and\nso on. Although the various models discussed below have sometimes been\ncriticized for their failure to capture all of these forms of\n“explanation” (see, e.g., Scriven 1959), it is clear that\nthey were never intended to do this. Instead, their intended\nexplicandum is, very roughly, explanations of why\nthings happen, where the “things” in question can be\neither particular events or something more general—e.g.,\nregularities or repeatable patterns in nature. Paradigms of this sort\nof explanation include: the explanation for the advance in the\nperihelion of mercury provided by General Relativity, the explanation\nof the extinction of the dinosaurs in terms of the impact of a large\nasteroid at the end of the Cretaceous period, the explanation provided\nby the police for why a traffic accident occurred (the driver was\nspeeding and there was ice on the road), and the standard explanation\nprovided in economics textbooks for why monopolies will, in comparison\nwith firms in perfectly competitive markets, raise prices and reduce\noutput. \nFinally, a few words about the broader epistemological and\nmethodological background to the models described below. Many\nphilosophers think of concepts like “explanation”,\n“law”, “cause”, and “support for\ncounterfactuals” as part of an interrelated family of concepts\nthat are “modal” in character. For familiar\n“empiricist” reasons, Hempel and many other early\ndefenders of the DN model regarded these concepts as not well\nunderstood, at least prior to analysis. It was assumed that it would\nbe “circular” to explain one concept from this family in\nterms of others from the same family and that they must instead be\nexplicated in terms of other concepts from outside the modal\nfamily—concepts that more obviously satisfied (what were taken\nto be) empiricist standards of intelligibility and testability. For\nexample, in Hempel’s version of the DN model, the\nnotion of a “law” plays a key role in explicating the\nconcept of “explanation”, and his assumption is that laws\nare just regularities that meet certain further conditions that are\nalso acceptable to empiricists. As we shall see, these empiricist\nstandards (and an accompanying unwillingness to employ modal concepts\nas primitives) have continued to play a central role in the models of\nexplanation developed subsequent to the DN model. \nA related issue has to do with whether all scientific explanations are\ncausal and if not, what distinguishes causal from non-causal\nexplanations. Hempel recognized both causal and non-causal forms of\nexplanation but held that both were captured by the DN model\n–in his view, causal explanations are simply DN\nexplanations that cite causal laws (which he regarded as a proper\nsubset of all laws). Many but not all of the accounts discussed below\nin effect assume that many of the problems with the DN model can be\ntraced to its commitment to an inadequate account of causation; thus\nthat getting clearer about causal notions would lead to more\nadequate accounts of explanation. By contrast, a substantial amount of\nrecent discussion of explanation has moved away from this focus on\ncausation and instead explores the possibility of non-causal forms of\nexplanation.[1] \nSuggested Readings: Salmon (1989) is a superb\ncritical survey of all the models of scientific explanation discussed\nin this entry. Kitcher and Salmon (1989), Pitt (1988), and Ruben\n(1993) are anthologies that contain a number of influential\narticles. \nAccording to the Deductive-Nomological Model, a scientific explanation\nconsists of two major “constituents”: an\nexplanandum, which is a sentence “describing the\nphenomenon to be explained” and an explanans,\n“the class of those sentences which are adduced to account for\nthe phenomenon” (Hempel & Oppenheim 1948 [1965: 247]). For\nthe explanans to successfully explain the explanandum several\nconditions must be met. First, “the explanandum must be a\nlogical consequence of the explanans” and “the sentences\nconstituting the explanans must be true” (Hempel 1948 [1965:\n248]). That is, the explanation should take the form of a sound\ndeductive argument in which the explanandum follows as a conclusion\nfrom the premises in the explanans. This is the\n“deductive” component of the model. Second, the explanans\nmust contain at least one “law of nature” and this must be\nan essential premise in the derivation in the sense that the\nderivation of the explanandum would not be valid if this premise were\nremoved. This is the “nomological” component of the\nmodel—“nomological” being a philosophical term of\nart which, suppressing some niceties, means (roughly)\n“lawful”. In its most general formulation, the DN\nmodel is meant to apply both to the explanation of “general\nregularities” or “laws” such as (to use Hempel and\nOppenheim’s examples) why light conforms to the law of\nrefraction and also to the explanation of particular events, conceived\nas occurring at a particular time and place, such as the bent\nappearance of the partially submerged oars of a rowboat on a\nparticular occasion of viewing. As an additional illustration of a\nDN explanation of a particular event, consider a derivation\nof the position of Mars at some future time from Newton’s laws\nof motion, the Newtonian inverse square law governing gravity, and\ninformation about the mass of the sun, the mass of Mars and the\npresent position and velocity of each. In this derivation the various\nNewtonian laws figure as essential premises and they are used, in\nconjunction with appropriate information about initial conditions (the\nmasses of Mars and the sun and so on), to derive the explanandum (the\nfuture position of Mars) via a deductively valid argument. The\nDN criteria are thus satisfied. \nThe notion of a sound deductive argument is (arguably) relatively\nclear (or at least something that can be regarded as antecedently\nunderstood from the point of view of characterizing scientific\nexplanation). But what about the other major component of the\nDN model—that of a law of nature? The basic intuition\nthat guides the DN model goes something like this: Within the\nclass of true generalizations, we may distinguish between those that\nare only “accidentally true” and those that are\n“laws”. To use Hempel’s examples, the\ngeneralization \nis, if true, only accidentally so. In contrast, \nis a law. Thus, according to the DN model, the latter\ngeneralization can be used, in conjunction with information that some\nparticular sample of gas has been heated under constant pressure, to\nexplain why it has expanded. By contrast, the former generalization\n (1)\n in conjunction with the information that a particular person n\nis a member of the 1964 Greensbury school board, cannot be used to\nexplain why n is bald. \nWhile this example may seem clear enough, what exactly is it that\ndistinguishes true accidental generalizations from laws? This has been\nthe subject of a great deal of philosophical discussion, most of which\nmust be beyond the scope of this\n entry.[2]\n For reasons explained in\n Section 1,\n Hempel assumes that an adequate account must explain the notion of\nlaw in terms of notions that lie outside the modal\n family.[3]\n He considers (1965b) a number\nof familiar proposals having this\n character[4]\n and finds them all wanting, remarking that the problem of\ncharacterizing the notion of law has proved “highly\nrecalcitrant” (1965b: 338). It seems fair to say, however, that\nhis underlying assumption is that, at bottom, laws are just\nexceptionless generalizations describing regularities that meet\ncertain additional distinguishing conditions that he is not at present\nable to formulate. In subsequent decades, a variety of criteria for\nlawhood have been proposed. Of these the so-called best systems\nanalysis (Lewis 1973) is\nprobably the most popular, but no single account has won general\nacceptance. Finding an adequate characterization of lawhood is thus an\nongoing issue for the DN model.  \nOne point at which this issue is particularly pressing concerns the\nexplanatory status of the so-called special sciences—biology,\npsychology, economics and so on. These sciences are full of\ngeneralizations that appear to play an explanatory role and yet fail\nto satisfy many of the standard criteria for lawfulness. For example,\nalthough Mendel’s law of segregation (M) (which states that in\nsexually reproducing organisms each of the two alternative forms\n(alleles) of a gene specifying a trait at a locus in a given organism\nhas 0.5 probability of ending up in a gamete) is widely used in models\nin evolutionary biology, it has a number of exceptions, such as\nmeiotic drive. A similar point holds for the principles of rational\nchoice theory (such as the generalization that preferences are\ntransitive) which figure centrally in economics. Other widely used\ngeneralizations in the special sciences have very narrow scope in\ncomparison with paradigmatic laws, hold only over restricted\nspatio-temporal regions, and lack explicit theoretical\nintegration. \nThere is considerable disagreement over whether such generalizations\nare laws. Some philosophers (e.g., Woodward 2000) suggest that such\ngeneralizations satisfy too few of the standard criteria to count as\nlaws but can nevertheless figure in explanations; if so, it apparently\nfollows that we must abandon the DN requirement that all\nexplanations must appeal to laws. Others (e. g., Mitchell 1997),\nemphasizing different criteria for lawfulness, conclude instead that\ngeneralizations like (M) are laws and hence no threat to the\nrequirement that explanations must invoke laws. In the absence of a\nmore principled account of laws, it is hard to evaluate these\ncompeting claims and hence hard to assess the implications of the\nDN model for the special sciences. At the very least,\nproviding such an account is an important item of unfinished business\nfor advocates of the DN model. \nThe DN model is meant to capture explanation via deduction\nfrom deterministic laws and this raises the obvious question of the\nexplanatory status of statistical laws. Do such laws explain at all\nand if so, what do they explain, and under what conditions? Hempel\n(1965b) distinguishes two\nvarieties of statistical explanation. The first of these,\ndeductive-statistical (DS) explanation, involves the\ndeduction of “a narrower statistical uniformity” from a\nmore general set of premises, at least one of which involves a more\ngeneral statistical law. Since DS explanation involves\ndeduction of the explanandum from a law, it conforms to the same\ngeneral pattern as the DN explanation of regularities.\nHowever, in addition to DS explanation, Hempel also\nrecognizes a distinctive sort of statistical explanation, which he\ncalls inductive-statistical or IS explanation,\ninvolving the subsumption of individual events (like the recovery of a\nparticular person from streptococcus infection) under (what he regards\nas) statistical laws (such as a law specifying the probability of\nrecovery, given that penicillin has been taken). \nWhile the explanandum of a DN or DS explanation can\nbe deduced from the explanans, one cannot deduce that some particular\nindividual, John Jones, has recovered from the above statistical law\nand the information that he has taken penicillin. At most what can be\ndeduced from this information is that recovery is more or less\nprobable. In IS explanation, the relation between explanans\nand explanandum is, in Hempel’s words, “inductive,”\nrather than deductive—hence the name inductive-statistical\nexplanation. The details of Hempel’s account are complex, but\nthe underlying idea is roughly this: an IS explanation will\nbe good or successful to the extent that its explanans confers high\nprobability on its explanandum outcome. \nThus if it is a statistical law that the probability of recovery from\nstreptococcus, given that one has taken penicillin, is high, and Jones\nhas taken penicillin and recovered, this information can be used to\nprovide an IS explanation of Jones’s recovery. However\nif the probability of recovery is low (e.g., less than 0.5), given\nthat Jones has taken penicillin, then, even if Jones recovers, we\ncannot use this information to provide an IS explanation of\nhis recovery. \nWhy suppose that all (or even some) explanations have a DN or\nIS structure? There are two ideas which play a central\nmotivating role in Hempel’s (1965b) discussion. The first connects the information provided by\na DN argument with a certain conception of what it is to\nachieve understanding of why something happens—it appeals to an\nidea about the object or point of giving an explanation. Hempel\nwrites \n… a DN explanation answers the question\n“Why did the explanandum-phenomenon occur?” by\nshowing that the phenomenon resulted from certain particular\ncircumstances, specified in \\(C_1,C_2,\\ldots,C_k\\), in accordance with\nthe laws \\(L_1,L_2,\\ldots,L_{\\gamma}\\). By pointing this out, the\nargument shows that, given the particular circumstances and the laws\nin question, the occurrence of the phenomenon was to be\nexpected; and it is in this sense that the explanation enables us\nto understand why the phenomenon occurred. (1965b: 337,\nitalics in original) \nOne can think of IS explanation as involving a natural\ngeneralization of this idea. While an IS explanation does not\nshow that the explanandum-phenomenon was to be expected with\ncertainty, it does the next best thing: it shows that the\nexplanandum-phenomenon is at least to be expected with high\nprobability and in this way provides understanding. Stated more\ngenerally, both the DN and IS models, share the\ncommon idea that, as Salmon (1989) puts it,  \nthe essence of scientific explanation can be described as nomic\nexpectability—that is expectability on the basis of lawful\nconnections. (1989: 57) \nThe second main motivation for the DN/IS model has to do with\nthe role of causal claims in scientific explanation. There is\nconsiderable disagreement among philosophers about whether all\nexplanations in science and in ordinary life are causal and also\ndisagreement about what the distinction (if any) between causal and\nnon-causal explanations consists in. Nonetheless, virtually everyone,\nincluding Hempel, agrees that many scientific explanations cite\ninformation about causes. However, Hempel, along with most other early\nadvocates of the DN model, is unwilling to take the notion of\ncausation as primitive in the theory of explanation—that is, he\nwas unwilling to simply say that X figures in an explanation of\nY if and only if X causes Y. Instead, adherents\nof the DN model have generally looked for an account of\ncausation that satisfies the empiricist requirements described in\n Section 1.\n In particular, advocates of the DN model have generally\naccepted a broadly Humean or regularity theory of causation, according\nto which (very roughly) all causal claims imply the existence of some\ncorresponding regularity (a “law”) linking cause to\neffect. This is then taken to show that all causal explanations\n“imply,” perhaps only “implicitly,” that such\na law/regularity exists and hence that laws are “involved”\nin all such explanations, just as the DN model claims. \nTo illustrate this line of argument, consider \n\n (3)\n is a so-called singular causal explanation, advanced by Michael\nScriven (1962) as a counterexample to the claim that the DN\nmodel describes necessary conditions for successful explanation.\nAccording to Scriven,\n (3)\n explains the tipping over of the inkwell even though no law or\ngeneralization figures explicitly in\n (3)\n and\n (3)\n appears to consist of a single sentence, rather than a deductive\nargument. Hempel’s response (1965b: 360ff) is that the\noccurrence of “caused” in\n (3)\n should not be left unanalyzed or taken as explanatory just as it\nstands. Instead\n (3)\n should be understood as “implicitly” or\n“tacitly” claiming there is a “law” or\nregularity linking knee impacts to tipping over of inkwells. According\nto Hempel, it is the implicit claim that some such law holds that\n“distinguishes”\n (3)\n from “a mere sequential narrative” in which the spilling\nis said to follow the impact but without any claim of causal\nconnection—a narrative that (Hempel thinks) would clearly not be\nexplanatory. This linking law is the nomological premise in the\nDN argument that, according to Hempel, is\n“implicitly” asserted by\n (3). \nThe basic idea is thus that a proper explication of the role of causal\nclaims in explanation leads via a Humean or regularity theory of\ncausation, to the conclusion that, at least ideally, explanations\nshould satisfy the DN/IS model. Let us call this line of\nargument the “hidden structure” argument in recognition of\nthe role it assigns to a hidden (or at least non-explicit) DN\nstructure that is claimed to be associated with\n (3). \nAt this point a comment is in order regarding a feature of this\nproposal that may seem puzzling. The boundaries of the category\n“scientific explanation” are far from clear, but while\n (3)\n is arguably an explanation, it is not what one usually thinks of as\n“science”—instead it is a claim from “ordinary\nlife” or “common sense”. This raises the question of\nwhy adherents of the DN/IS model don’t simply respond\nto the alleged counterexample\n (3)\n by denying that it is an instance of the category “scientific\nexplanation”—that is, by claiming that the DN/IS\nmodel is not an attempt to reconstruct the structure of explanations\nlike\n (3)\n but is rather only meant to apply to explanations that are properly\nregarded as “scientific”. The fact that this response is\nnot often adopted by advocates of the DN model is an\nindication of the extent to which, as noted in\n Section 1,\n it is implicitly assumed in most discussions of scientific\nexplanation that there are important similarities or continuities in\nstructure between explanations like\n (3)\n and explanations that are more obviously scientific and that these\nsimilarities that should be captured by some common account that\napplies to both. Indeed, it is a striking feature not just of Hempel\n(1965b) but of many other\ntreatments of scientific explanation that much of the discussion in\nfact focuses on “ordinary life” singular causal\nexplanations similar to\n (3),\n the tacit assumption being that conclusions about the structure of\nsuch explanations have fairly direct implications for understanding\nexplanation in science. \nAs explained above, examples like\n (3)\n are potential counterexamples to the claim that the DN model\nprovides necessary conditions for explanation. There are also\na number of well-known counterexamples to the claim that the\nDN model provides sufficient conditions for\nsuccessful scientific explanation. Here are two illustrations. \nExplanatory Asymmetries. There are many cases in\nwhich a derivation of an explanandum E from a law L and\ninitial conditions I seems explanatory but a\n“backward” derivation of I from E and the\nsame law L does not seem explanatory, even though the latter,\nlike the former, appears to meet the criteria for successful\nDN explanation. For example, one can derive the length\ns of the shadow cast by a flagpole from the height h of\nthe pole and the angle θ of the sun above the horizon and laws\nabout the rectilinear propagation of light. This derivation meets the\nDN criteria and seems explanatory. On the other hand, the\nfollowing derivation from the same laws also meets the DN\ncriteria but does not seem explanatory: \nExamples like this suggest that at least some explanations possess\ndirectional or asymmetric features to which the DN model is\ninsensitive. \nExplanatory Irrelevancies. A derivation can satisfy\nthe DN criteria and yet be a defective explanation because it\ncontains irrelevancies besides those associated with the directional\nfeatures of explanation. Consider an example due to Wesley Salmon\n(1971a: 34): \nIt is arguable that (L) meets the criteria for lawfulness\nimposed by Hempel and many other writers. (If one wants to deny that\n(L) is a law one needs some principled, generally accepted\nbasis for this judgment and, as explained above, it is unclear what\nthis basis is.) Moreover,\n (5)\n is certainly a sound deductive argument in which (L) occurs as\nan essential premise. Nonetheless, most people judge that (L)\nand (K) are no explanation of (E). There are many other\nsimilar illustrations. For example (Kyburg 1965), it is presumably a\nlaw (or at least an exceptionless, counterfactual supporting\ngeneralization) that all samples of table salt that have been hexed by\nbeing touched with the wand of a witch dissolve when placed in water.\nOne may use this generalization as a premise in a DN\nderivation which has as its conclusion that some particular hexed\nsample of salt has dissolved in water. But again the hexing is\nirrelevant to the dissolving and such a derivation is no\nexplanation. \nOne obvious diagnosis of the difficulties posed by examples like\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n focuses on the role of causation in explanation. According to this\nanalysis, to explain an outcome we must cite its causes and\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n fail to do this. As Salmon (1989a: 47) puts it,  \na flagpole of a certain height causes a shadow of a given length and\nthereby explains the length of the shadow.  \nBy contrast,  \nthe shadow does not cause the flagpole and consequently cannot explain\nits height.  \nSimilarly, taking birth control pills does not cause Jones’\nfailure to get pregnant and this is why\n (5)\n fails to be an acceptable explanation. On this analysis, what\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n show is that a derivation can satisfy the DN criteria and\nyet fail to identify the causes of an explanandum—when this\nhappens the derivation will fail to be explanatory. \nAs explained above, advocates of the DN model would not\nregard this diagnosis as very illuminating, unless accompanied by some\naccount of causation that does not simply take this notion as\nprimitive. (Salmon in fact provides such an account, which we will\nconsider in\n Section 4.)\n We should note, however, that an apparent lesson of\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n is that the regularity account of causation favored by DN\ntheorists is at best incomplete: the occurrence of c, e,\nand the existence of some regularity or law linking them (or\nx’s having property P and x’s having\nproperty Q and some law linking these) is not a\nsufficient condition for the truth of the claim that c caused\n or x’s having P is causally or\nexplanatorily relevant to x’s having Q. More\ngenerally, if the counterexamples\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n are accepted, it follows that the DN model fails to state\nsufficient conditions for explanation. Explaining an outcome\nisn’t just a matter of showing that it is nomically\nexpectable. \nThere are two possible reactions one might have to this observation.\nOne is that the idea that explanation is a matter of nomic\nexpectability is correct as far as it goes, but that something more is\nrequired as well. According to this assessment, the DN/IS\nmodel does state a necessary condition for successful\nexplanation and, moreover, a condition that is a non-redundant part of\na set of conditions that are jointly sufficient for explanation.\nHowever, some other, independent feature, X (which will account\nfor the directional features of explanation and insure the kind of\nexplanatory relevance that is apparently missing in the birth control\nexample) must be added to the DN model to achieve a\nsuccessful account of explanation. The idea is thus that Nomic\nExpectability + X = Explanation. Something like this idea is endorsed, by\nthe unificationist models of explanation developed by Friedman (1974)\nand Kitcher (1989), which are discussed in\n Section 5\n below. \nA second, more radical possible conclusion is that the DN\naccount of the goal or rationale of explanation is mistaken in some\nmuch more fundamental way and that the DN model does not even\nstate necessary conditions for successful explanation. As noted above,\nunless the hidden structure argument is accepted, this conclusion is\nstrongly suggested by examples like\n (3)\n (“The impact of my knee caused the tipping over of the\ninkwell”) which appear to involve explanation without the\nexplicit citing of a law or a deductive structure. \nSuggested Readings. The most authoritative and\ncomprehensive statement of the DN and IS models is\nprobably Hempel (1965b). This is reprinted in Hempel 1965a, along with\na number of other papers that touch on various aspects of the problem\nof scientific explanation. In addition to the references cited in this\nsection, Salmon (1989: 46ff.) describes a number of well-known\ncounterexamples to the DN/IS models and discusses their\nsignificance. \nMuch of the subsequent literature on explanation has been motivated by\nattempts to capture the features of causal or explanatory relevance\nthat appear to be left out of examples like\n (4)\n and\n (5),\n typically within the empiricist constraints described above. Wesley\nSalmon’s statistical relevance (or SR) model (Salmon\n1971a) is a very influential attempt to capture these features in\nterms of the notion of statistical relevance or conditional dependence\nrelationships. Given some class or population \\(A\\), an attribute\n\\(C\\) will be statistically relevant to another attribute\n\\(B\\) if and only if \\(P(B\\pmid A.C) \\ne P(B\\pmid A)\\)—that is,\nif and only if the probability of \\(B\\) conditional on \\(A\\) and \\(C\\)\nis different from the probability of \\(B\\) conditional on \\(A\\) alone.\nThe intuition underlying the SR model is that statistically\nrelevant properties (or information about statistically relevant\nrelationships) are explanatory and statistically irrelevant properties\nare not. In other words, the notion of a property making a difference\nfor an explanandum is unpacked in terms of statistical relevance\nrelationships. \nAs an illustration, suppose that in the birth control pills example\n (5)\n the original population T includes both sexes. Then \nwhile \nassuming that not all women in the population take birth control\npills. In other words, if you are a male in this population, taking\nbirth control pills is statistically irrelevant to whether you become\npregnant, while if you are a female it is relevant. Thus taking birth\ncontrol pills is explanatorily irrelevant to pregnancy among males but\nnot among females. \nTo characterize the SR model more precisely we need the\nnotion of a homogenous partition. A homogenous partition of\n\\(A\\) is a set of subclasses or cells \\(C_i\\) of \\(A\\) that are\nmutually exclusive and exhaustive, where \\(P(B\\pmid A.C_i) \\ne\nP(B\\pmid A.C_j)\\) for all \\(C_i \\ne C_j\\) and where no further\nstatistically relevant partition of any of the cells \\(A\\), \\(C_i\\)\ncan be made with respect to \\(B\\)—that is, there are no\nadditional attributes \\(D_k\\) in \\(A\\) such that  \nOn the SR model, an explanation of why some member x\nof the class characterized by attribute \\(A\\) has attribute \\(B\\)\nconsists of the following information: \nTo employ one of Salmon’s examples, suppose we want to construct\nan SR explanation of why x who has a strep infection =\nS, recovers quickly = Q. Let \\(T(-T)\\) according to\nwhether x is (is not) treated with penicillin, and \\(R(-R)\\) =\naccording to whether x has a penicillin-resistant strain.\nAssume for the sake of argument that no other factors are relevant to\nquick recovery. There are four possible combinations of these\nproperties: \\(T.R,\\) \\(-T.R,\\) \\(T.{-R},\\) \\({-T}.{-R},\\) but let us\nassume that \nThat is, the probability of quick recovery, given that one has strep,\nis the same for those who have the resistant strain regardless of\nwhether or not they are treated and also the same for those who have\nnot been treated. By contrast, the probability of recovery is\ndifferent (presumably greater) among those with strep who have been\ntreated and do not have the resistant strain. \nIn this case \nis a homogenous partition of S with respect to Q. The\nSR explanation of x’s recovery will consist of a\nstatement of the probability of quick recovery among all those with\nstrep ((i) above), a statement of the probability of recovery in each\nof the two cells of the above partition ((ii) above), and the cell to\nwhich x belongs, which is \\(S.T.R\\) ((iii) above). Intuitively,\nthe idea is that this information tells us about the relevance of each\nof the possible combinations of the properties T and R\nto quick recovery among those with strep and is explanatory for just\nthis reason. \nThe SR model has a number of distinctive features that have\ngenerated substantial discussion. First, note that according to the\nSR model, and in contrast to the DN/IS model, an\nexplanation is not an argument—either in the sense of a\ndeductively valid argument in which the explanandum follows as a\nconclusion from the explanans or in the sense of a so-called inductive\nargument in which the explanandum follows with high probability from\nthe explanans, as in the case of IS explanation. Instead, an\nexplanation is an assembly of information that is statistically\nrelevant to an explanandum. Salmon argues (and takes the birth control\nexample\n (5)\n to illustrate) that the criteria that a good argument must satisfy\n(e.g., criteria that insure deductive soundness or some inductive\nanalogue) are simply different from those a good explanation must\nsatisfy. Among other things, as Salmon puts it, “irrelevancies\n[are] harmless in arguments but fatal in explanations” (1989:\n102). As explained above, in associating successful explanation with\nthe provision of information about statistical relevance\nrelationships, the SR model attempts to accommodate this\nobservation. \nA second, closely related point is that the SR model departs\nfrom the IS model in abandoning the idea that a statistical\nexplanation of an outcome must provide information from which it\nfollows the outcome occurred with high probability. As the reader may\ncheck, the statement of the SR model above imposes no such\nhigh probability requirement; instead, even very unlikely outcomes\nwill be explained as long as the criteria for SR explanation\nare met. Suppose that, in the above example, the probability of quick\nrecovery from strep, given treatment and the presence of a\nnon-resistant strain, is rather low (e.g., 0.2). Nonetheless, if the\ncriteria (i)–(iii) above—a homogeneous partition with\ncorrect probability values for each cell in the partition—are\nsatisfied, we may use this information to explain why x, who\nhad a non-resistant strain of strep and was treated, recovered\nquickly. Indeed, according to the SR model, we may explain\nwhy some x which is A is B, even if the\nconditional probability of B given A and the cell\n\\(C_i\\) to which x belongs \\((p_i = P(B\\pmid A.C_i))\\) is\nless than the prior probability \\((p = P(B\\pmid A))\\) of\nB in A. For example, if the prior probability of quick\nrecovery among all those with any form of strep is 0.5 and the\nprobability of quick recovery of those with a resistant strain who are\nuntreated is 0.1, we may nonetheless explain why y, who meets\nthese last conditions \\(({-T}.R),\\) recovered quickly (assuming he\ndid) by citing the cell to which he belongs, the probability of\nrecovery given that he falls in this cell, and the other sort of\ninformation described above. More generally, what matters on the\nSR model is not whether the value of the probability of the\nexplanandum-outcome is high or low (or even high or low in comparison\nwith its prior probability) but rather whether the putative explanans\ncites all and only statistically relevant factors and whether the\nprobabilities it invokes are correct. One consequence of this, which\nSalmon endorses while acknowledging that many will regard it as\nunintuitive, is that on the SR model, the same explanans\nE may explain both an explanandum M and explananda that\nare inconsistent with M, such as \\(-M\\). For example, the same\nexplanans will explain both why a subject with strep and certain other\nproperties (e.g., T and \\(-R\\)) recovers quickly, if he does,\nand also why he does not recover if he does not. By contrast, on the\nDN or IS models, if E explains M,\nE cannot also explain \\(-M\\). \nThis judgment that, contrary to the IS model, the value that\na candidate explanans assigns to an explanandum-outcome should not\nmatter for the goodness of the explanation, is motivated as follows:\nWhen an outcome is the result of a genuinely indeterministic process\nwe understand both high probability and low probability outcomes (the\nlatter of which of course will sometimes occur) equally well: in both\ncases, once an SR model has been constructed, there are no additional\nfactors that distinguish the two outcomes. \nStepping back from the issues (such as the status of the high\nprobability requirement) that have dominated discussions of\nstatistical explanation, there are several more general issues that\ndeserve mention. One is that these models have been applied to a range\nof examples that seem prima-facie to be quite different, including\nquantum mechanical examples (e.g., radioactive decay) but also more\nordinary examples such as recovery from disease and (to use an example\nof Salmon’s) causes of juvenile delinquency. Radioactive decay\nis a process that is usually taken to be irreducibly indeterministic\nand hence is the sort of thing that Salmon’s objective\nhomogeneity requirement is designed to capture. By contrast, although\nthe evidence for many models of juvenile delinquency comes from\npopulation level statistics these models do not assume that\ndelinquency is the outcome of an irreducibly indeterministic process\n(and the models themselves are very far from satisfying an objective\nhomogeneity requirement). Indeed, taken literally, standard causal\nmodels assume the opposite: the assumed equations are deterministic\nwith the stochastic element supplied by an “error term”.\nThis raises the question of whether it is sensible to look for a\nsingle model that captures all of these examples. \nA second, more radical assessment focuses on the question of whether\nit is appropriate to think of the sorts of statistical theories and\nhypotheses on which Hempel and Salmon discuss as explaining individual\nevents or outcomes at all. For example, why not instead take quantum\nmechanics to explain (i) the probabilities with which\nindividual outcomes like decay events occur but not (ii) those\nindividual outcomes themselves? If we adopt (i) the relationship\nbetween a quantum mechanical model and such explananda will be\ndeductive and thus subsumable under whatever model of deductive\nexplanation we favor. This raises the question of what additional work\nis accomplished by models of statistical explanation of either the\nIS or SR sort.  \nPutting aside the issues raised in the previous section, the SR model\nembodies several generic assumptions of ongoing philosophical\ninterest. In particular the model assumes that (i) explanations must\ncite causal relationships and that (ii) causal relationships are fully\ncaptured by statistical relevance (or conditional dependence and\nindependence) relationships. While (i) is a matter of current\ncontroversy, (ii) is clearly false. As a substantial body of\n work[5]\n has made clear, causal relationships are greatly underdetermined by\nstatistical relevance relationships, even given additional\nassumptions. For example, a structure in which B is a common\ncause of the joint effects A and C implies (assuming the\nCausal Markov assumption which is the appropriate generalization of\nSalmon’s assumptions connecting causation and probability)\nimplies the same statistical relevance relations as a chain structure\nin which A causes B which causes C.  \nSelected Readings. Salmon (1971a) provides a detailed\nstatement and defense of the SR model. This essay, as well as\npapers by Jeffrey (1969) and Greeno (1970) which defend views broadly\nsimilar to the SR model, are collected in Salmon (1971b).\nAdditional discussion of the model as well as a more recent\ncharacterization of “objective homogeneity” can be found\nin Salmon (1984). Cartwright (1979) contains some influential\ncriticisms of the SR model. Theorems specifying the precise\nextent of the underdetermination of causal claims by evidence about\nstatistical relevance relationships can be found in Spirtes, Glymour\nand Scheines (1993 [2000: chapter 4]). For additional discussion of\n“screening off” and the principle of the common cause, see\nthe entry on\n Reichenbach’s Principle of the Common Cause. \nIn more recent work (especially, Salmon 1984) Salmon abandoned the\nattempt to characterize explanation or causal relationships in purely\nstatistical terms. Instead, he developed a new account which he called\nthe Causal Mechanical (CM) model of explanation—an\naccount which is similar in both content and spirit to so-called\ncausal process theories of causation of the sort\ndefended by philosophers like Philip Dowe (2000). We may think of the\nCM model as an attempt to capture the “something\nmore” involved in causal and explanatory relationships over and\nabove facts about statistical relevance, again while attempting to\nremain within a broadly Humean framework. \nThe CM model employs several central ideas. A causal\nprocess is a physical process, like the movement of a baseball\nthrough space, that is characterized by the ability to transmit a\nmark in a continuous way. (“Continuous”\ngenerally, although perhaps not always, means “spatio-temporally\ncontinuous”.) Intuitively, a mark is some local modification to\nthe structure of a process—for example, a scuff on the surface\nof a baseball or a dent an automobile fender. A process is capable of\ntransmitting a mark if, once the mark is introduced at one\nspatio-temporal location, it will persist to other spatio-temporal\nlocations even in the absence of any further interaction. In this\nsense the baseball will transmit the scuff mark from one location to\nanother. Similarly, a moving automobile is a causal process because a\nmark in the form of a dent in a fender will be transmitted by this\nprocess from one spatio-temporal location to another. Causal processes\ncontrast with pseudo-processes which lack the ability to\ntransmit marks. An example is the shadow of a moving physical object.\nThe intuitive idea is that, if we try to mark the shadow by modifying\nits shape at one point (for example, by altering a light source or\nintroducing a second occluding object), this modification will not\npersist unless we continually intervene to maintain it as the shadow\noccupies successive spatio-temporal positions. In other words, the\nmodification will not be transmitted by the structure of the shadow\nitself, as it would in the case of a genuine causal process. \nWe should note for future reference that, as characterized by Salmon,\nthe ability to transmit a mark is clearly a counterfactual notion, in\nseveral senses. To begin with, a process may be a causal process even\nif it does not in fact transmit any mark, as long as it is true that\nif it were appropriately marked, it would transmit the mark.\nMoreover, the notion of marking itself involves a counterfactual\ncontrast—a contrast between how a process behaves when marked\nand how it would behave if left unmarked. Although Salmon, like\nHempel, has always been suspicious of counterfactuals, his view at the\ntime that he first introduced the CM model was that the\ncounterfactuals involved in the characterization of mark transmission\nwere relatively unproblematic, in part because they seemed\nexperimentally testable in a fairly direct way. Nonetheless the\nreliance of the CM model, as originally formulated, on\ncounterfactuals shows that it does not completely satisfy the Humean\nstrictures described above. In subsequent work, described in\n Section 4.4\n below, Salmon attempted to construct a version of the CM\nmodel that completely avoids reliance on counterfactuals. \nThe other major element in Salmon’s model is the notion of a\ncausal interaction. A causal interaction involves a\nspatio-temporal intersection between two causal processes which\nmodifies the structure of both—each process comes to have\nfeatures it would not have had in the absence of the interaction. A\ncollision between two cars that dents both is a paradigmatic causal\ninteraction. \nAccording to the CM model, an explanation of some event\nE will trace the causal processes and interactions leading up\nto E (Salmon calls this the etiological aspect of the\nexplanation), or at least some portion of these, as well as describing\nthe processes and interactions that make up the event itself (the\nconstitutive aspect of explanation). In this way, the\nexplanation shows how E “fit[s] into a causal\nnexus”(1984: 9). For example, when two billiard balls collide\n(event E), the trajectory of each of the balls is a causal\nprocess (as shown by the fact that if the balls were scratched, such\nmarks would persist) and their collision is a causal interaction.\nExplaining E will involve both tracing these trajectories and\nnoting that E involves an interaction. \nAs the billiard example illustrates, the CM model takes as\nits paradigms of causal interaction examples such as collisions in\nwhich there is “action by contact” and no spatio-temporal\ngaps in the transmission of causal influence. There is little doubt\nthat explanations in which there are no such gaps (no “action at\na distance”) often strike us as particularly satisfying.\nHowever, as Christopher Hitchcock shows in an illuminating paper\n(Hitchcock 1995), even here the CM model leaves out something\nimportant. Consider the usual elementary textbook “scientific\nexplanation” of the motion of the balls in the above example\nfollowing their collision. This explanation proceeds by deriving that\nmotion from information about their masses and velocity before the\ncollision, the assumption that the collision is perfectly elastic, and\nthe law of the conservation of linear momentum. We usually think of\nthe information conveyed by this derivation as showing that it is the\nmass and velocity of the balls, rather than, say, the scratches on\ntheir surface or chalk that may be transmitted by the cue stick that\nis explanatorily relevant to their subsequent motion. However, it is\nhard to see what in the CM model allows us to pick out the\nlinear momentum of the balls, as opposed to these other features, as\nexplanatorily relevant. Part of the difficulty is that to express such\nrelatively fine-grained judgments of explanatory relevance (that it is\nlinear momentum rather than chalk marks that matters) we need to talk\nabout relationships between properties or magnitudes and it is not\nclear how to express such judgments purely in terms of facts about\ncausal processes and interactions. Both the linear momentum and the\nchalk mark communicated to the cue ball by the cue stick are marks\ntransmitted by the spatio-temporally continuous causal process\nconsisting of the motion of the cue ball. \nIronically, as Hitchcock goes on to note, a similar observation may be\nmade about the birth control pills example\n (5)\n originally devised by Salmon to illustrate the failure of the\nDN model to capture the notion of explanatory relevance.\nSpatio-temporally continuous causal processes that transmit marks as\nwell as causal interactions are at work when male Mr. Jones ingests\nbirth control pills—the pills dissolve, components enter his\nbloodstream, are metabolized or processed in some way, and so on.\nSimilarly, spatio-temporally continuous causal processes (albeit\ndifferent processes) are at work when female Ms. Jones takes birth\ncontrol pills. However, the pills are irrelevant to Mr. Jones’s\nnon-pregnancy, and relevant to Ms. Jones’s non-pregnancy. Again,\nit looks as though the relevance or irrelevance of the birth control\npills to Mr. or Ms. Jones’s failure to become pregnant cannot be\ncaptured just by asking whether the processes leading up to these\noutcomes are causal processes in Salmon’s sense.  \nA more general way of putting the problem revealed by these examples\nis that those features of a process P in virtue of which it\nqualifies as a causal process (ability to transmit mark M) may\nnot be the features of P that are causally or explanatorily\nrelevant to the outcome E that we want to explain (M may\nbe irrelevant to E with some other property R of\nP being the property which is causally relevant to E).\nSo while mark transmission may well be a criterion that correctly\ndistinguishes between causal processes and\npseudo-processes, it does not, as it stands, provide the\nresources for distinguishing those features or\nproperties of a causal process that are causally or\nexplanatorily relevant to an outcome and those features that are\nirrelevant. \nA second set of worries has to do with the application of the\nCM model to systems which depart in various respects from\nsimple physical paradigms such as the collision described above. There\nare a number of examples of such systems. First, there are theories\nlike Newtonian gravitational theory which involve “action at a\ndistance” in a physically interesting sense. Second, there are a\nnumber of examples from the literature on causation that do not\ninvolve physically interesting forms of action at a distance but which\narguably involve causal interactions without intervening\nspatio-temporally continuous processes or transfer of energy and\nmomentum from cause to effect. These include cases of causation by\nomission and causation by “double prevention” or\n “disconnection.”[6]\n In all these cases, a literal application of the CM model\nseems to yield the judgment that no explanation has been\nprovided—that Newtonian gravitational theory is unexplanatory\nand so on. Many philosophers have been reluctant to accept this\nassessment. \nYet another class of examples that raise problems for the CM\nmodel involves putative explanations of the behavior of complex or\n“higher level” systems—explanations that do not\nexplicitly cite spatio-temporally continuous causal processes\ninvolving transfer of energy and momentum, even though we may think\nthat such processes are at work at a more “underlying”\nlevel. Most explanations in disciplines like biology, psychology and\neconomics fall under this description, as do a number of\nstraightforwardly physical explanations. \nAs an illustration, suppose that a mole of gas is confined to a\ncontainer of volume \\(V_1,\\) at pressure \\(P_1,\\) and temperature\n\\(T_1\\). The gas is then allowed to expand isothermally into a larger\ncontainer of volume \\(V_2\\). One standard way of explaining the\nbehavior of the gas—its rate of diffusion and its subsequent\nequilibrium pressure \\(P_2\\)—appeals to the generalizations of\nphenomenological thermodynamics—e.g., the ideal gas law,\nGraham’s law of diffusion, and so on. Salmon appears to regard\nputative explanations based on at least the first of these\ngeneralizations as not explanatory because they do not trace\ncontinuous causal processes—he thinks of the individual\nmolecules as causal processes but not the gas as a\n whole.[7]\n However, it is plainly impossible to trace the causal processes and\ninteractions represented by each of the \\(6 \\times 10^{23}\\) molecules\nmaking up the gas and the successive interactions (collisions) it\nundergoes with every other molecule. Even the usual statistical\nmechanical treatment, which Salmon presumably would regard as\nexplanatory, does not attempt to do this. Instead, it makes certain\ngeneral assumptions about the distribution of molecular velocities and\nthe forces involved in molecular collisions and then uses these, in\nconjunction with the laws of mechanics, to derive and solve a\ndifferential equation (the Boltzmann transport equation) describing\nthe overall behavior of the gas. This treatment abstracts radically\nfrom the details of the causal processes involving particular\nindividual molecules and instead focuses on identifying higher level\nvariables that aggregate over many individual causal processes and\nthat figure in general patterns that govern the behavior of the\ngas. \nThis example raises a number of questions. Just what does the\nCM model require in the case of complex systems in which we\ncannot trace individual causal processes, at least at a fine-grained\nlevel? How exactly does the causal mechanical model avoid the\n(disastrous) conclusion that any successful explanation of the\nbehavior of the gas must trace the trajectories of individual\nmolecules? Does the statistical mechanical explanation described above\nsuccessfully trace causal processes and interactions or specify a\ncausal mechanism in the sense demanded by the CM model, and\nif so, what exactly does tracing causal processes and interactions\ninvolve or amount to in connection with such a system? A fully\nadequate development of the CM model needs to address such\nquestions. \nThere is another aspect of this example that is worthy of comment.\nSuppose that a particular sample of gas expands in a way that meets\nthe conditions described above and that it is somehow possible to\nprovide an account that traces each of the individual molecular\ntrajectories of its component molecules. Such an account would\nnonetheless leave out information that seems explanatorily relevant.\nThis information has to do with the fact that there are a large number\nof alternative trajectories besides the actual trajectories followed\nby the component molecules on this particular occasion that would lead\nto the same final pressure \\(P_2\\) which is what we want to explain.\nModal information of this sort—both about what would happen if\nthe molecules followed different trajectories consistent with the\ninitial conditions \\(P_1\\), \\(V_1\\) and \\(T_1\\) and what would happen if they instead followed initial conditions consistent trajectories consistent with different macroscopic initial conditions is better captured by a treatment in terms of upper level thermodynamic variables. \nIn more recent work (e.g., Salmon 1994), prompted in part by a desire\nto avoid certain counterexamples advanced by Philip Kitcher (1989) to\nhis characterization of mark transmission, Salmon attempted to fashion\na theory of causal explanation that completely avoids any appeal to\ncounterfactuals. In this new theory which is influenced by the\nconserved process theory of causation of Dowe (2000), Salmon defined a\ncausal process as a process that transmits a non-zero amount of a\nconserved quantity at each moment in its history. Conserved\nquantities are quantities so characterized in physics—linear\nmomentum, angular momentum, charge, and so on. A causal interaction is\nan intersection of world lines associated with causal processes\ninvolving exchange of a conserved quantity. Finally, a process\ntransmits a conserved quantity from A to B if it\npossesses that quantity at every stage without any interactions that\ninvolve an exchange of that quantity in the half-open interval\n \\((A,B]\\).[8] \nOne may doubt that this new theory really avoids reliance on\ncounterfactuals, but an even more fundamental difficulty is that it\nstill does not adequately deal with the problem of causal or\nexplanatory relevance described above. That is, we still face the\nproblem that the feature that makes a process causal (transmission of\nsome conserved quantity or other) may tell us little about which\nfeatures of the process are causally or explanatorily relevant to the\noutcome we want to explain. For example, a moving billiard ball will\ntransmit many conserved quantities (linear momentum, angular momentum,\ncharge etc.) and many of these may be exchanged during a collision\nwith another ball. What is it that entitles us to single out the\nlinear momentum of the balls, rather than these other conserved\nquantities as the property that is causally relevant to their\nsubsequent motion? In cases in which there appear to be no\nconservation laws governing the explanatorily relevant property (i.e.,\ncases in which the explanatorily relevant variables are not conserved\nquantities) this difficulty seems even more acute. Properties like\n“having ingested birth control pills,” “being\npregnant”, or “being a sample of hexed salt” do not\nthemselves figure in conservation laws. While one may say that both\nbirth control pills and hexed salt are causal processes because both\nconsist, at some underlying level, of processes that unambiguously\ninvolve the transmission of conserved quantities like mass and charge,\nthis observation does not by itself tell us what, if anything, about\nthese underlying processes is relevant to pregnancy or dissolution in\nwater. \nIn a more recent paper (Salmon 1997), Salmon conceded this point. He\nagreed that the notion of a causal process cannot by itself capture\nthe notion of causal and explanatory relevance. He suggested, however,\nthat this notion can be adequately captured by appealing to the notion\nof a causal process and information about statistical\nrelevance relationships (that is, information about conditional and\nunconditional (in)dependence relationships), with the latter capturing\nthe element of causal or explanatory dependence that was missing from\nhis previous account: \nI would now say that (1) statistical relevance relations, in the\nabsence of information about connecting causal processes, lack\nexplanatory import and that (2) connecting causal processes, in the\nabsence of statistical relevance relations, also lack explanatory\nimport. (1997: 476) \nThis suggestion is not developed in any detail in Salmon’s\npaper, and it is not easy to see how it can be made to work. We noted\nabove that statistical relevance relationships often greatly\nunderdetermine the causal relationships among a set of variables. What\nreason is there to suppose that appealing to the notion of a causal\nprocess, in Salmon’s sense, will always or even usually remove\nthis indeterminacy? We also noted that the notion of a causal process\ncannot capture fine-grained notions of relevance between properties,\nthat there can be causal relevance between properties instances of\nwhich (at least at the level of description at which they are\ncharacterized) are not linked by spatio-temporally continuous or\ntransference of conserved quantities, and that properties can be so\nlinked without being causally relevant (recall the chalk mark that is\ntransmitted from one billiard ball to another). As long as it is\npossible (and why should it not be?) for different causal claims to\nimply the same facts about statistical relevance relationships and for\nthese claims to differ in ways that cannot be fully cashed out in\nterms of Salmon’s notions of causal processes and interactions,\nthis new proposal will fail as well. \nSelected Readings: Salmon (1984) provides a detailed\nstatement of the Causal Mechanical model, as originally formulated.\nSalmon (1994 and 1997) provide a restatement of the model and respond\nto criticisms. For discussion and criticism of the CM model,\nsee Kitcher (1989, especially pages 461ff), Woodward (1989), and\nHitchcock (1995). \nIn unificationist accounts of explanation developed by philosophers,\nscientific explanation is a matter of providing a unified account of a\nrange of different\n phenomena.[9]\n This idea is unquestionably intuitively appealing. Successful\nunification may exhibit connections or relationships between phenomena\npreviously thought to be unrelated and this seems to be something that\nwe expect good explanations to do. Moreover, theory unification has\nclearly played an important role in science. Paradigmatic examples\ninclude Newton’s unification of terrestrial and celestial\ntheories of motion and Maxwell’s unification of electricity and\nmagnetism. The key question, however, is whether (and which) intuitive\nnotions of unification can be made more precise in a way that allows\nus to recover the features that we think that good explanations should\npossess. \nMichael Friedman (1974) is an important early attempt to do this.\nFriedman’s formulation of the unificationist idea was\nsubsequently shown to suffer from various technical problems (Kitcher\n1976) and subsequent development of the unificationist treatment of\nexplanation has been most closely associated with Philip Kitcher\n(especially Kitcher 1989). \nLet us begin by introducing some of Kitcher’s technical\nvocabulary. A schematic sentence is a sentence in which some\nof the nonlogical vocabulary has been replaced by dummy letters. To\nuse Kitcher’s examples, the sentence “Organisms homozygous\nfor the sickling allele develop sickle cell anemia” is\nassociated with a number of schematic sentences including\n“Organisms homozygous for A develop P” and\n“For all X if X is O and A then\nX is P”. Filling instructions are\ndirections that specify how to fill in the dummy letters in schematic\nsentences. For example, filling instructions might tell us to replace\nA with the name of an allele and P with the name of a\nphenotypic trait in the first of the above schematic sentences.\nSchematic arguments are sequences of schematic sentences.\nClassifications describe which sentences in schematic\narguments are premises and conclusions and what rules of inference are\nused. An argument pattern is an ordered triple consisting of\na schematic argument, a set or sets of filling instructions, one for\neach term of the schematic argument, and a classification of the\nschematic argument. The more restrictions an argument pattern imposes\non the arguments that instantiate it, the more stringent it\nis said to be. \nRoughly speaking, Kitcher’s guiding idea is that explanation is\na matter of deriving descriptions of many different phenomena by using\nas few and as stringent argument patterns as possible over and over\nagain-the fewer the patterns used, the more stringent they are, and\nthe greater the range of different conclusions derived, the more\nunified our explanations. Kitcher summarizes this view as follows: \nScience advances our understanding of nature by showing us how to\nderive descriptions of many phenomena, using the same pattern of\nderivation again and again, and in demonstrating this, it teaches us\nhow to reduce the number of facts we have to accept as ultimate.\n(Kitcher 1989: 432) \nKitcher does not propose a completely general theory of how the\nvarious considerations he describes—number of conclusions,\nnumber of patterns and stringency of patterns—are to be\ntraded-off against one another, but does suggest that it often will be\nclear enough what these considerations imply about the evaluation of\nparticular candidate explanations. His basic strategy is to attempt to\nshow that the derivations we regard as good or acceptable explanations\nare instances of patterns that, taken together, score better according\nto the criteria just described than the patterns instantiated by what\nwe regard as defective explanations. Following Kitcher, let us define\nthe explanatory store \\(E(K)\\) as the set of argument\npatterns that maximally unifies K, the set of beliefs accepted\nat a particular time in science. Showing that a particular derivation\nis a good or acceptable explanation is then a matter of showing that\nit belongs to the explanatory store. \nAs an illustration, consider Kitcher’s treatment of the problem\nof explanatory asymmetries (recall\n Section 2.5).\n Our present explanatory practices—call these P—are\ncommitted to the idea that derivations of a flagpole’s height\nfrom the length of its shadow are not explanatory. Kitcher compares\nP with an alternative systemization in which such derivations\nare regarded as explanatory. According to Kitcher, P includes\nthe use of a single “origin and development” (OD)\npattern of explanation, according to which the dimensions of\nobjects-artifacts, mountains, stars, organisms etc. are traced to\n“the conditions under which the object originated and the\nmodifications it has subsequently undergone” (1989: 485). Now\nconsider the consequences of adding to P an additional pattern\nS (the shadow pattern) which permits the derivation of the\ndimensions of objects from facts about their shadows. Since the\nOD pattern already permits the derivation of all facts about\nthe dimensions of objects, the addition of the shadow pattern S\nto P will increase the number of argument patterns in P\nand will not allow us to derive any new conclusions. On the other\nhand, if we were to drop OD from P and replace it with\nthe shadow pattern, we would have no net change in the number of\npatterns in P, but would be able to derive far fewer\nconclusions than we would with OD, since many objects do not\nhave shadows (or enough shadows) from which to derive all of their\ndimensions. Thus OD belongs to the explanatory store, and the\nshadow pattern does not. Kitcher’s treatment of other familiar\nproblem cases is similar. For example he claims that explanations that\ncontain irrelevancies (such as Salmon’s birth control pills case\nare less unifying than competing explanations that do not contain such\nirrelevancies.  \nKitcher acknowledges that there is nothing in the unificationist\naccount per se that requires that all explanation be\ndeductive: “there is no bar in principle to the use of\nnon-deductive arguments in the systemization of our beliefs”.\nNonetheless, “the task of comparing the unifying power of\ndifferent systemizations looks even more formidable if non-deductive\narguments are considered” and in part for this reason Kitcher\nendorses the view that “in a certain sense, all explanation\nis deductive” (1989: 448). \nWhat is the role of causation on this account? Kitcher claims that\n“the ‘because’ of causation is always derivative\nfrom the ‘because’ of explanation.” (1989: 477).\nThat is, our causal judgments simply reflect the explanatory\nrelationships that fall out of our (or our intellectual\nancestors’ ) attempts to construct unified theories of nature.\nThere is no independent causal order over and above this which our\nexplanations must capture. Like many other philosophers, Kitcher takes\nvery seriously (even if in the end he perhaps does not fully endorse)\nstandard empiricist or Humean worries about the epistemic\naccessibility and intelligibility of causal claims. Taking causal,\ncounterfactual or other notions belonging to the same family as\nprimitive in the theory of explanation is problematic. Kitcher\nbelieves that it is a virtue of his theory that it does not do this.\nInstead, Kitcher proposes to begin with the notion of explanatory\nunification, characterized in terms of constraints on deductive\nsystemizations, where these constraints can be specified in a quite\ngeneral way that is independent of causal or counterfactual notions,\nand then show how the causal claims we accept derive from our efforts\nat unification. \nAs remarked at the beginning of this section, the idea that\nexplanation is connected in some way to unification is intuitively\nappealing. Nonetheless Kitcher’s particular way of cashing out\nthis connection has been subject to criticism. In connection with\nKitcher’s treatment of explanatory asymmetries, consider,\nfollowing Barnes (1992), a time-symmetric theory like Newtonian\nmechanics, applied to a closed system like the solar system. Call\nderivations of the state of motion of planets at some future time\nt from information about their present positions (at time\n\\(t_0\\)), masses, and velocities, the forces incident on them at\n\\(t_0\\), and the laws of mechanics predictive. Now contrast\nsuch derivations with retrodictive derivations in which the\npresent motions of the planets are derived from information about\ntheir future velocities and positions at t, the forces\noperative at t, and so on. It looks as though there will be\njust as many retrodictive derivations as predictive derivations, and\neach will require premises of exactly the same general\nsort—information about positions, velocities, masses, etc. and\nthe same laws. Thus the pattern or patterns instantiated by the\nretrodictive derivations look(s) exactly as unified as the pattern or\npatterns associated with the predictive derivations. However, we\nordinarily think of the predictive derivations and not the\nretrodictive derivations as explanatory and the present state of the\nplanets as the cause of their future state and not vice-versa.  \nOne possible response to this second example is to bite the bullet and\nto argue that from the point of view of fundamental physics, there\nreally is no difference in the explanatory import of the retrodictive\nand predictive derivations, and that it is a virtue, not a defect, of\nthe unificationist approach that it reproduces this judgment. Whatever\nmight be said in favor of this response, it is not Kitcher’s.\nHis claim is that our ordinary judgments about causal asymmetries can\nbe derived from the unificationist account. The example just described\ncasts doubt on this claim. More generally, it casts doubt on\nKitcher’s contention that one can begin with the notion of\nexplanatory unification, understood in a way that does not presuppose\ncausal notions, and use it to derive the content of causal\njudgments. \nSelected Readings: The most detailed statement of\nKitcher’s position can be found in Kitcher (1989). Salmon (1989:\n94ff.) contains a critical discussion of Friedman’s version of\nthe unificationist account of explanation but ends by advocating a\n“rapprochement” between unificationist approaches and\nSalmon’s own causal mechanical model. Woodward (2003) contains\nadditional criticisms of Kitcher’s version of\nunificationism. \nDespite their many differences, the accounts of Hempel (focusing now\non just the DN rather than the IS model), Salmon,\nKitcher, and others discussed above, largely share a common overall\nconception of what the project of constructing a theory of explanation\nshould involve and (to a considerable extent) what criteria such a\ntheory should satisfy if it is to be successful.\n“Pragmatic” theories of explanation depart from this\nconsensus in important respects. Let us say that a theory of\nexplanation contains “pragmatic” elements if (i) according\nto the theory, those elements require irreducible reference to facts\nabout the interests, beliefs or other features of the psychology of\nthose providing or receiving the explanation and/or (ii) irreducible\nreference to the “context” in which the explanation\noccurs. (For what this means, see below.) Although the writers\ndiscussed above agree that pragmatic elements play some role in the\nactivity of giving and receiving explanations, they assume that there\nis a non-pragmatic core to the notion of explanation, which it is the\ncentral task of a theory of explanation to capture. That is, it is\nassumed that this core notion can be specified without reference to\npsychological features of explainers or their audiences and with\nreference to non-contextual features that are sufficiently general,\nabstract and “structural,” in the sense that they hold\nacross a range of explanations with different contents and across a\nrange of different contexts. Relations like deductive entailment or\nstatistical relevance are examples of candidates for such\n“structural” relationships. In addition, these writers see\nthe goal of a theory of explanation, as capturing the notion of a\ncorrect explanation, as opposed to the notion of an\nexplanation’s being considered explanatory by a particular\naudience or not, a matter which presumably depends on such\nconsiderations as whether the audience understands the terms in which\nthe explanation is framed. (In this sense, “correctness”\nrequires (at least) that the explanans be true or “well-confirmed” and that the explanans stands in the right\nrelationship to the explanandum.) Finally, as noted in the\nIntroduction to this entry, writers in this tradition have\nnot had the goal of capturing all the various ways in which\nthe word “explanation” is used in ordinary English. They\nhave instead focused on a much more restricted class of examples in\nwhich what is of interest is (something like) explaining\n“why” some outcome or general phenomenon occurred, as\nopposed to explaining, e.g., the meaning of a word or how to solve a\ndifferential equation. The motivation for this restriction is simply\nthe judgment that an interesting and non-trivial theory is more likely\nto emerge if it is restricted in scope in this way. For ease of\nreference, let us call this the “traditional” conception\nof the task of a theory of explanation. \nSome or all of these assumptions and goals are rejected in pragmatic\naccounts of explanation. Early contributors to this approach include\nMichael Scriven (e.g., 1962) and Sylvan Bromberger (e.g., 1966), with\nmore systematic statements, due to van Fraassen (1980) and Achinstein\n(1983) appearing in the 1980s. Since it is not always clear just what\nthe points of disagreement are between pragmatic and traditional\naccounts, some orienting remarks about this will be useful before\nturning to details. Defenders of pragmatic approaches to explanation\ntypically stress the point that whether provision of a certain body of\ninformation to some audience produces understanding or is illuminating\nfor that audience depends on the background knowledge of the audience\nmembers and on other factors having to do with the local context. For\nexample, an explanation of the deflection of starlight by the sun that\nappeals to the field equations of General Relativity may be highly\nilluminating to a trained physicist but unintelligible to a layperson\nbecause of their background. Factors of this sort are grouped together\nas “pragmatic” and their influence is taken to illustrate\nat least one way in which pragmatic considerations enter into the\nnotion of explanation. \nTaken in itself, the observation just described seems completely\nuncontroversial and not in conflict with traditional approaches to\nexplanation. Indeed, as remarked above writers like Hempel and Salmon\nexplicitly agree that explanation has a pragmatic dimension in the\nsense just described—in fact, Hempel invokes the role of\npragmatic factors at a number of points to address prima-facie\ncounterexamples to the DN model. This suggests that, often at least,\nwhat is distinctive about pragmatic approaches to explanation is not\njust the bare idea that explanation has a “pragmatic\ndimension” but rather the much stronger claim that the\ntraditional project of constructing a model of explanation pursued by\nHempel and others has so far been unsuccessful ( and perhaps is\nbound to be unsuccessful) and that this is so\nbecause pragmatic or contextual factors play a central and\nineliminable role in explanation in a way that resists incorporation\ninto models of the traditional sort. On this view, much of what is\ndistinctive about pragmatic accounts is their opposition to\ntraditional accounts and their diagnosis of why such accounts\nfail—they fail because they omit pragmatic or contextual\nelements. It will be important to keep this point in mind in what\nfollows because there is a certain tendency among advocates of\npragmatic theories to argue as though the superiority of their\napproach is established simply by the observation that explanation has\na pragmatic dimension; instead it seems more appropriate to think that\nthe real issue is whether traditional approaches are inadequate in\nprinciple because of their neglect of the pragmatic dimension of\nexplanation. \nA second issue concerns an important ambiguity in the notion of\n“pragmatic”. On one natural understanding of this notion,\na pragmatic consideration is one that has to do with utility or\nusefulness in the service of some goal connected to human interests,\nwhere these interests are in some relevant sense\n“practical”. Call this notion\n“pragmatic1”. On this construal, Hempel’s\nDN model might be correctly characterized as a\npragmatic1 theory since it links explanatory information\nclosely to the provision of information that is useful for purposes of\nprediction and prediction certainly qualifies as a pragmatic goal. For\nsimilar reasons, Woodward’s (2003) theory of explanation might\nalso be counted as a pragmatic1 theory since it connects\nexplanation with the provision of information that is useful for\nmanipulation and control—unquestionably useful goals. As these\nexamples suggest, models of explanation that aspire to traditional\ngoals can be pragmatic1 theories. \nIn the context of theories of explanation, however, the label\n“pragmatic” is usually intended to suggest a somewhat\ndifferent set of associations. In particular, as noted above,\n“pragmatic” is typically used to characterize\nconsiderations having to do with facts about the psychology\n(interests, beliefs etc.) of those involved in providing or receiving\nexplanations and/or to characterize considerations involving the local\ncontext, often with the suggestion that both sets of considerations\nmay vary in complex and idiosyncratic ways that resist incorporation\ninto the sort of general theory sought by traditional\n models.[10]\n Call this set of associations “pragmatic2”. Neither Hempel’s nor Woodward’s theory is\npragmatic2. In particular, as the example of the\nDN model illustrates, the fact that a theory is\npragmatic1 in the sense that it appeals to facts about\ngoals generally shared by human beings (such as prediction) to help to\nmotivate a model of explanation does not preclude attempting\nto construct models of explanation satisfying traditional goals and\ndoes not require commitment to the idea that explanation must be\nunderstood as a pragmatic2 notion. We need to be careful to\ndistinguish these two different ways of thinking about the\n“pragmatic” dimension of explanation. \nFinally, as emphasized above, a concern with the pragmatics of\nexplanation naturally connects with an interest in the\n“psychology” of explanation and this in turn suggests the\nrelevance of empirical studies of sorts of information that various\nsubjects (ordinary folks, scientists) find explanatory, treat as\nproviding “understanding”, the distinctions subjects make\namong explanations and so on. Although there is a growing literature\nin this area, the most prominent philosophical advocates of pragmatic\napproaches to explanation have so far tended not to make use of it. In\nthis connection, it is worth pointing out that this psychological\nliterature goes well beyond the truisms found in philosophical\ndiscussion about different people finding different sorts of\ninformation explanatory depending on their interests. In particular,\npsychologists have been very interested in exploring general features\nor structural patterns present in information that various subjects\nfind explanatory. For example, Lombrozo (2010) finds evidence that\nsubjects prefer explanations that appeal to relationships that are\nrelatively stable (in the sense of continuing to hold across changing\n circumstances)[11]\n and Lien and Cheng (2000) present evidence that in cases in which the\nexplanandum \\(E\\) has a single candidate cause \\(C\\),\nsubjects prefer levels of explanation/causal description that maximize\n\\(\\Delta p = \\Pr(E\\pmid C) - \\Pr(E \\pmid \\text{not-}C)\\). \nNotice that in both cases these are relationships or patterns of the\nsort that traditional accounts of explanation attempt to capture. As\nthese examples bring out, there is no necessary incompatibility\nbetween the project of trying to formulate an account of explanation\nthat satisfies traditional goals and an interest in the psychology of\nexplanation. It may be that subjects find certain sorts of information\nexplanatory or understanding-producing because certain\nstructural features of the sort that traditional accounts attempt to\ncharacterize are present in that information—indeed this is what\nthe Lombrozo and Lien and Cheng papers suggest. Thus, we should\ndistinguish the project of investigating the empirical psychology of\nexplanation (which can be pursued with a variety of different\ncommitments about how to best theorize about explanation) from the\nmore specific claim that the characterization of what it is for an\nexplanatory relationship to hold between explanans and explanandum\nmust be given in “psychologistic” terms, in the sense that\nthis requires irreducible reference to psychological facts about\nparticular audiences such as the vagaries of what they happen to be\ninterested in.  \nOne of the most influential recent pragmatic accounts of explanation\nis associated with constructive\n empiricism.[12]\n This is the thesis, defended by Bas van Fraassen in his 1980 book,\nThe Scientific Image, that the aim of science (or at least\n“pure” science) is the construction of theories that are\n“empirically adequate” (that is, that yield a true or\ncorrect description of observables) and not, as scientific realists\nsuppose, theories that aim to tell literally true stories about\nunobservables. Relatedly, “acceptance” of a theory\ninvolves only the belief that it is empirically adequate (van Fraassen\n1980: 12). van Fraassen’s account of explanation, which is laid\nout in several articles and, most fully, in Chapter Six of his book,\nis meant to fit with this overall conception of science: it is a\nconception according to which explanation per se is not an epistemic\naim of “pure” science (empirical adequacy is the only such\naim), but rather a “pragmatic” virtue, having to do with\nthe “application” of science. (Note that the application\nof science is arguably a matter of pragmatics1. However,\nthe idea that explanation has to do with the application of science is\nused to motivate the adoption of a pragmatic2 theory of\nexplanation. We thus have an elision of the two notions of\n“pragmatic” distinguished above.) According to van\nFraassen, because explanation is a merely pragmatic virtue, a concern\nwith explanation is not something that can require scientists to move\nbeyond belief in the empirical adequacy of their theories to belief in\nthe literal truth of claims about unobservable entities. \nAccording to van Fraassen, explanations are answers to questions and\ngetting clear about the logic of questions is central to constructing\na theory of explanation. Questions can take many different forms, but\nwhen the question of interest is a “why” question,\nexplanatory queries will typically take the following form: a query\nabout why some explanandum \\(P_k\\) rather than any one of the members\nof a contrast class \\(X\\) (a set of possible alternatives to \\(P_k\\))\nobtained. In addition, some “relevance relation” \\(R\\) is\nassumed by the question. An answer \\(A\\) to this question\nwill take the form “\\(P_k\\) in contrast to (the rest of) \\(X\\)\nbecause \\(A\\), where \\(A\\) bears the relevance relation \\(R\\) to\n\\([P_k,X]\\)”. To use van Fraassen’s example, consider\n“Why is this conductor warped?” Depending on the context,\nthe intended contrast might have to with, e.g., why this particular\nconductor is warped in contrast to some other conductor that is\nunwarped. Alternatively, it might have to do with why this particular\nconductor is warped now when it was previously unwarped. The relevance\nrelation \\(R\\) similarly depends on the context and the information\nwhich the questioner is interested in obtaining. For example, \\(R\\)\nmight involve causal information (the question might be a request for\nwhat caused the warping) but it also might have to do with information\nabout function, if the context was one in which it is assumed that the\nshape of the conductor plays some functional role in a power station\nwhich the questioner wants to know about. Thus “context”\nenters into the explanation both by playing a role in specifying the\ncontrast class \\(X\\) and the relevance relation \\(R\\). van Fraassen\ndescribes various rules for the “evaluation” of answers.\nFor example, \\(P_k\\) and \\(A\\) must be true, the other members of the\ncontrast class must not be true, \\(A\\) must “favor” (raise\nthe conditional probability of) \\(P_k\\) against alternatives, and\n\\(A\\) must compare favorably with other answers to the same question,\na condition which itself has several aspects including, for example,\nwhether \\(A\\) favors the topic more than these other answers and\nwhether \\(A\\) is screened off by other answers. However, he also makes\nit clear (as the example above suggests) that a variety of different\nrelevance relations may be appropriate depending on context and that\nthe evaluation of answers also depends on context. Moreover, he\nexplicitly denies that there is anything distinctive about the\ncategory of scientific explanation that has to do with its structure\nor form—instead, a scientific explanation is simply an\nexplanation that makes use of information that is (or at least, is\ntreated as) grounded in a “scientific” theory. \nVan Fraassen sums up his view of explanation (and gestures at his\ngrounds for rejecting traditional objectivist approaches) as\nfollows: \nThe discussion of explanation went wrong at the very beginning when\nexplanation was conceived of as a relation like description: a\nrelation between a theory and a fact. Really, it is a three-term\nrelation between theory, fact, and context. No wonder that no single\nrelation between theory and fact ever managed to fit more than a few\nexamples! Being an explanation is essentially relative for an\nexplanation is an answer… it is evaluated\nvis-à-vis a question, which is a request for information. But\nexactly… what is requested differs from context to context.\n(1980: 156) \nVan Fraassen begins his chapter on explanation with a brief story that\nprovides a good point of entry into how he intends his account to\nwork. Recall from\n Section 2.5\n that a well-known counterexample to the DN model involves\nthe claim that one can explain the length S of the shadow cast\nby a flagpole in terms of the height H of the flagpole but that\n(supposedly) one cannot explain H in terms of S, despite\nthe fact that one can construct a DN derivation from S\nto H. This is commonly taken to show that the DN model\nhas left out some factor having to do with the directional or\nasymmetric features of explanation—e.g., perhaps an asymmetry in\nthe relation between cause and effect that ought to be incorporated into\none’s model of explanation. In van Fraassen’s story, a\nstraightforward causal explanation of the usual sort of S in\nterms of H (although the object in question is a tower rather\nthan a flagpole) is first offered. Then a second explanation,\naccording to which the height of the tower is “explained”\nby the fact that it was designed to cast a shadow of a certain length\nis advanced. Presumably the moral we are to draw is that as the\ncontext and perhaps the relevance relation R are varied,\nboth \nand \nare acceptable (legitimate, appropriate etc.) explanations. Moreover,\nsince these variations in context and relevance relation turn on\nvariations in what is of interest to the explainer and his audience,\nwe are further encouraged to conclude that explanatory asymmetries\nhave their source in psychological facts about people’s\ninterests and background beliefs, rather than in, say, some asymmetry\nthat exits in nature independently of these. Pragmatists about\nexplanation think that a similar conclusion holds for other features\nof the explanatory relevance relation that philosophers have tried to\ncharacterize in terms of traditional models of explanation. \nOne obvious response to this claim, made by several critics (e.g.,\nKitcher & Salmon 1987: 317), is that the example does not really\ninvolve a case in which, depending on context, H causally\nexplains S and S causally explains H. Instead,\nalthough H does causally explain S, it is (something\nlike) the desire for a shadow of length S (rather than\nS itself) that explains (or at least causally explains) the\nheight (or the choice of height) for the tower. Or, if one prefers, in\nthe latter case we are given something like a functional explanation\n(but not a causal explanation) for the height of the tower, in the\nsense that we are told what the intended function of that choice of\nheight is. On either of these diagnoses, this will not be a case in\nwhich whether H provides a causal explanation of S or\nwhether instead S provides a causal explanation of H\nshifts depending on factors having to do with the interests of the\nspeaker or audience or other contextual factors. If so, the story\nabout the tower does not show that the asymmetry present in the\nflagpole example must be accounted for in terms of pragmatic factors.\nIt may be accounted for in some other way. In fact, although\ndiscussion must be beyond the scope of this entry, a number of\npossible candidates for such a non-pragmatic account of causal\nasymmetries have been proposed, both in philosophy and outside of it\n(for example, in the machine learning\n literature[13]).\n  \nA much more general criticism has been advanced against van\nFraassen’s version of a pragmatic theory by Kitcher and Salmon\n(1987). Basically, their complaint is that the relevance relation\nR in van Fraassen’s account is completely unconstrained,\nwith the (in their view, obviously unacceptable) consequence that for\nany pair of true propositions P and A, answer A\nis relevant to P via some relevance relation and thus\n“explains” P. For example, according to Salmon and\nKitcher, we might define a relationship of “astral\ninfluence” \\(R^*\\), meeting van Fraassen’s criteria for\nbeing a relevance relation, such that the time t of a\nperson’s death is explained in terms of \\(R^*\\) and the position\nof various heavenly bodies at t. Here it may seem that van\nFraassen has a ready response. As noted above, on van Fraassen’s\nview, background knowledge and, in the case of scientific explanation,\ncurrent scientific knowledge, helps to determine which are the\nacceptable relevance relations and acceptable answers to the questions\nposed in requests for explanation—such knowledge and the\nexpectations that go along with it are part of the relevant context\nwhen one asks for an explanation of time of death. Obviously, astral\ninfluence is not an acceptable or legitimate relevance relation\naccording to modern science—hence appeal to such a relation is\nnot countenanced as explanatory by van Fraassen’s theory. More\ngenerally it might be argued that available scientific knowledge will\nprovide constraints on the relevance relations and answers that\nexclude the “anything goes” worry raised by Salmon and\nKitcher—at least insofar as the context is one in which a\n“scientific explanation” is sought. \nWhile this response may seem plausible enough as far as it goes, it\ndoes bring out the extent to which much of the work of distinguishing\nthe explanatory from the non-explanatory in van Fraassen’s\naccount comes from a very general appeal to what is accepted as\nlegitimate background information in current science. Put differently,\nthis raises the worry that once one moves beyond van Fraassen’s\nformal machinery concerning questions and answers (which van Fraassen\nhimself acknowledges is relatively unconstraining), one is left with\nan account according to which a scientific explanation is simply any\nexplanation employing claims from current science and a currently\nscientifically approved relevance relation. Even if otherwise\nunexceptionable, this proposal is, if not exactly trivial, at least\nrather deflationary—it provides much less than many have hoped\nfor from a theory of explanation. In particular, in cases (of which\nthere are many examples) in which there is an ongoing argument or\ndispute in some area of science not about whether some proposed theory\nor model is true but rather about whether it explains some phenomenon,\nit is not easy to see how the proposal even purports to provide\nguidance. On the other hand, the obvious rejoinder that might be made\non van Fraassen’s behalf is that no more ambitious treatment\nthat would satisfy the expectations associated with more traditional\naccounts of explanation (including a demarcation of candidate\nexplanations into those that are “correct” and\n“incorrect”) is possible—a theory like van\nFraassen’s is as good as it gets. If there is no defensible\ntheory of explanation embodying a non-trivially constraining relevance\nrelation, it cannot be a good criticism of van Fraassen’s theory\nthat he fails to provide this. \nA final point that is suggested by van Fraassen’s theory is\nthis: In considering pragmatic theories, it matters a great deal\nexactly where the “pragmatic” elements are claimed to\nenter into the account of explanation. One point at which such\nconsiderations seem clearly to enter is in the selection or\ncharacterization of what an audience wants explained. This is\nreflected in van Fraassen’s theory in the choice of a \\(P_k\\)\nand an associated contrast class \\(X\\). Obviously, whether we are\nlooking for an explanation of why, say, this particular conductor is\nnow bent when it was previously straight or whether instead we want to\nknow why this conductor is bent while some other conductor is straight\nis a matter that depends on our interests. However, this particular\nsort of “interest relativity” (and associated phenomena\nhaving to do with the role of contrastive focus in the\ncharacterization of explananda, which really just serve to specify\nmore exactly which particular explananda we want explained) seems\nsomething that can be readily acknowledged by traditional\n theories.[14]\n After all, it is not a threat to the DN or other models with\nsimilar traditional aspirations that one audience may be interested in\nan explanation of the photoelectric effect but not the deflection of\nstarlight by the sun and another audience may have the opposite\ninterests. What would be a threat to the DN and similar\nmodels would be an argument that once some explanandum E is\nfully specified, whether explanans M explains E (that\nis, whether there is an explanatory relation between M and\nE) is itself “interest-relative”. It is natural to\ninterpret van Fraassen as making this latter claim, both in connection\nwith explanatory asymmetries and more generally. \nSelected Readings. van Fraassen (1980, especially\nChapter Six) and Achinstein (1983) are classic statements of pragmatic\napproaches to explanation. These pragmatic accounts are discussed and\ncriticized in Salmon (1989). van Fraassen’s account is also\ndiscussed in Kitcher and Salmon (1987). De Regt and Dieks (2005) is a\nrecent defense of what the authors describe as a\n“contextual” account of scientific understanding and which\nengages with some of the themes in the “pragmatics of\nexplanation” literature. \nWhat can we conclude from this recounting of some of the more\nprominent recent attempts to construct models of scientific\nexplanation? What important issues remain open and what are the most\npromising directions for future work? Of course, any effort at\nstock-taking will reflect a particular point of view, but with this\ncaveat in mind, several observations seem plausible, even if not\ncompletely uncontroversial. \nOne issue concerns the role of causal information in scientific\nexplanation. All of the traditional models considered above attempt to\ncapture causal explanations, although some attempt to capture\nnon-causal explanations as well. It is a natural thought (endorsed by\nmany) that many of the difficulties faced by the models described\nabove derive at least in part from their reliance on inadequate\ntreatments of causation.[15]\n The problems of explanatory asymmetries and explanatory irrelevance\ndescribed in\n Section 2.5\n seem to show that the holding of a law between C and E\nis not sufficient for C to cause E; hence not a\nsufficient condition for C to figure in an explanation of\nE. If the argument of\n section 3.3\n is correct, a fundamental problem with the SR model is that\nstatistical relevance information is insufficient to fully capture\ncausal information in the sense that different causal structures can\nbe consistent with the same information about statistical relevance\nrelationships. Similarly, the CM model faces the difficulty\nthat information about causal processes and interactions is also\ninsufficient to fully capture causal relevance relations and that\nthere is a range of cases in which causal relationships hold between\nC and E (and hence in which C figures in an\nexplanation of E) although there is no connecting causal\nprocess between C and E. Finally, a fundamental problem\nwith unificationist models is that the content of our causal judgments\ndoes not seem to fall out of our efforts at unification, at least when\nunification is understood along the lines advocated by Kitcher. For\nexample, as discussed above, considerations having to do with\nunification do not by themselves explain why it is appropriate to\nexplain effects in terms of their causes rather than vice-versa. \nThese observations suggest that insofar as we are interested in causal\nforms of scientific explanation progress may require more attention to\nthe notion of causation and a more thorough-going integration of\ndiscussions of explanation with the burgeoning literature on\ncausation, both within and outside of\n philosophy.[16]\n A number of steps in this direction have been taken. (cf. Woodward\n2003). \nDoes this mean that a focus on causation should entirely replace the\nproject of developing models of explanation or that philosophers\nshould stop talking about explanation and instead talk just about\ncausation? Despite the apparent centrality of causation to many\nexplanations, it is arguable that completely subsuming the latter into\nthe former loses connections with some important issues. For one\nthing, causal claims themselves seem to vary greatly in the extent to\nwhich they are explanatorily deep or illuminating. Causal claims found\nin Newtonian mechanics seem deeper or more satisfying from the point\nof view of explanation than causal claims of “the rock broke the\nwindow” variety. It is usually supposed that such differences\nare connected to other features—for example to how general,\nstable, coherent with background knowledge a causal claim is. However,\nnotions like “generality” are vague and not all forms of\ngenerality seem to be connected to explanatory goodness. So even if\none focuses only on causal explanation, there remains the important\nproject of trying to understand better what sorts of distinctions\namong causal claims matter for goodness in explanation. To the extent\nthis is so, the kinds of concerns that have animated traditional\ntreatments of explanation don’t seem to be entirely subsumable\ninto standard accounts of causation, which have tended to focus\nlargely on the project of distinguishing causal from non-causal\nrelationships rather than on the features that make causal\nrelationships “good” for purposes of explanation. \nAnother important question has to do with whether there are forms of\nwhy-explanation that are non-causal. If so, how important are these\nare in science and what is their structure? Hempel seems to have\nthought of causal explanations simply as those DN explanations that\nappeal to causal laws which he regarded as a proper subset of all\nlaws. Thus on his view, causal and non-causal explanations share a\ncommon structure. Kitcher’s unificationist model was also\nintended to apply to both causal and non-causal explanations such as\nunifying argument patterns in linguistics. More recently, there has\nbeen a great upsurge of interest in whether there are non-causal forms\nof explanation, with some claiming they are ubiquitous in science\n(e.g., Lange 2017, Reutlinger & Saatsi 2018). If there are such explanations, this\nraises the issue of what distinguishes them from causal explanations\nand whether there is some overarching theory that subsumes both causal\nand non-causal explanations.  \nAs noted above, one way in which the attempt to develop a single\ngeneral model of explanation might fail is that we might conclude that\nthere are causal and non-causal forms of explanation that have little\nin common. But even putting this possibility aside, another\npossibility is that explanation differs across different areas of\nscience in a way that precludes the development of a single, general\nmodel. It is, after all, uncontroversial that explanatory\npractice—what is accepted as an explanation, how explanatory\ngoals interact with others, what sort of explanatory information is\nthought to be achievable, discoverable, testable etc.—varies in\nsignificant ways across different disciplines. Nonetheless, all of the\nmodels of explanation surveyed above are “universalist” in\naspiration—they claim that a single, “one size”\nmodel of explanation fits all areas of inquiry in so far as these have\na legitimate claim to explain. Although the extreme position that\nexplanation in biology or history has nothing interesting in common\nwith explanation in physics seems unappealing (and in any case has\nattracted little support), it seems reasonable to expect that more\neffort will be devoted in the future to developing models of\nexplanation that are more sensitive to disciplinary differences.\nIdeally, such models would reveal commonalities across disciplines but\nthey should also enable us to see why explanatory practice varies as\nit does across different disciplines and the significance of such\nvariation. For example, as noted above, biologists, in contrast to\nphysicists, often describe their explanatory goals as the discovery of\nmechanisms rather than the discovery of laws. Although it is\nconceivable that this difference is purely terminological, it is also\nworth exploring the possibility that there is a distinctive story to\nbe told about what a mechanism is, as this notion is understood by\nbiologists, and how information about mechanisms contributes to\nexplanation. \nA closely related point is that at least some of the models described\nabove impose requirements on explanation that may be satisfiable in\nsome domains of inquiry but are either unachievable (in any\npractically interesting sense) in other domains or, to the extent that\nthey may be achievable, bear no discernible relationship to generally\naccepted goals of inquiry in those domains. For example, we noted\nabove that many scientists and philosophers hold that there are few if\nany laws to be discovered in biology and the social and behavioral\nsciences. If so, models of explanation that assign a central role to\nlaws may not be very illuminating regarding how explanation works in\nthese disciplines. As another example, even if we suppose that the\npartition into objectively homogeneous reference classes recommended\nby the SR model is an achievable goal in connection with\ncertain quantum mechanical phenomena, it may be that (as suggested\nabove) it is simply not a goal that can be achieved in a non-trivial\nway in economics and sociology, disciplines in which causal inference\nfrom statistics also figures prominently. In such disciplines, it may\nbe that additional statistically relevant partitions of any population\nor subpopulation of interest will virtually always be possible, so\nthat the activity of finding such partitions is limited only by the\ncosts of gathering additional information. A similar assessment may\nhold for most applications of the CM model to the social\nsciences.","contact.mail":"jfw@pitt.edu","contact.domain":"pitt.edu"},{"date.published":"2003-05-09","date.changed":"2021-05-10","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-explanation/","author1":"James Woodward","author1.info":"https://www.hps.pitt.edu/people/james-woodward","author2.info":"https://www.lps.uci.edu/~rossl/","entry":"scientific-explanation","body.text":"\n\n\nIssues concerning scientific explanation have been a focus of\nphilosophical attention from Pre-Socratic times through the modern\nperiod. However, modern discussion really begins with the development\nof the Deductive-Nomological (DN) model. This model has had\nmany advocates (including Popper 1959, Braithwaite 1953, Gardiner,\n1959, Nagel 1961) but unquestionably the most detailed and influential\nstatement is due to Carl Hempel (1942, 1965a, and Hempel & Oppenheim 1948).\nThese papers and the reaction to them have structured subsequent\ndiscussion concerning scientific explanation to an extraordinary\ndegree. After some general remarks by way of background and\norientation\n (Section 1),\n this entry describes the DN model and its extensions, and\nthen turns to some well-known objections\n (Section 2).\n It next describes a variety of subsequent attempts to develop\nalternative models of explanation, including Wesley Salmon’s\nStatistical Relevance\n (Section 3)\n and Causal Mechanical\n (Section 4)\n models, Unificationist models due to Michael Friedman and\nPhilip Kitcher\n (Section 5),\n and Pragmatic theories found in the work of van Fraassen\n (Section 6).\n Section 7 provides a summary and discusses directions for future\nwork. This article thus discusses treatments of scientific explanation\nup to the end of the twentieth century. \n\nAs will become apparent, “scientific explanation” is a\ntopic that raises a number of interrelated issues. Some background\norientation will be useful before turning to the details of competing\nmodels. A presupposition of most recent discussion has been that\nscience sometimes provides explanations (rather than something that\nfalls short of explanation—e.g., “mere description”)\nand that the task of a “theory” or “model” of\nscientific explanation is to characterize the structure of such\nexplanations. It is thus assumed that there is (at some suitably\nabstract and general level of description) a single kind or form of\nexplanation that is “scientific”. In fact, the notion of\n“scientific explanation” suggests at least two\ncontrasts—first, a contrast between those\n“explanations” that are characteristic of\n“science” and those explanations that are not, and,\nsecond, a contrast between “explanation” and something\nelse. However, with respect to the first contrast, much of the recent\nphilosophical literature assumes that there is substantial continuity\nbetween explanations found in science and some forms of explanation\nfound in ordinary, non-scientific contexts. It is further assumed that\nit is the task of a theory of explanation to capture what is common to\nboth scientific and some ordinary, non-scientific forms of\nexplanation. These assumptions help to explain (what may otherwise\nstrike the reader as curious) why, as this entry will illustrate,\ndiscussions of scientific explanation often move back and forth\nbetween examples drawn from bona-fide science (e.g., explanations of\nthe trajectories of the planets that appeal to Newtonian mechanics)\nand more homey examples (e.g., the tipping over of inkwells). \nWith respect to the second contrast, most models of explanation assume\nthat it is possible for a set of claims to be true, accurate,\nsupported by evidence, and so on and yet unexplanatory. For example,\nall of the accounts of scientific explanation described below would\nagree that an account of the appearance of a particular species of\nbird of the sort found in a bird guidebook is, however accurate, not\nan explanation of anything of interest to biologists (such as the\ndevelopment, characteristic features, or behavior of that species).\nInstead, such an account is “merely descriptive”. However,\ndifferent models of explanation provide different accounts of what the\ncontrast between the explanatory and merely descriptive consists\nin. \nA related point is that, while most theorists of scientific\nexplanation have proposed models that are intended to cover at least\nsome cases of explanation that we would not think of as part of\nscience, they have nonetheless assumed some implicit restriction on\nthe kinds of explanation they have sought to reconstruct. It has often\nbeen noted that the word “explanation” is used in a wide\nvariety of ways in ordinary English—we speak of explaining the\nmeaning of a word, explaining how to bake a pie, explaining why one\nmade a certain decision (where this is to offer a justification) and\nso on. Although the various models discussed below have sometimes been\ncriticized for their failure to capture all of these forms of\n“explanation” (see, e.g., Scriven 1959), it is clear that\nthey were never intended to do this. Instead, their intended\nexplicandum is, very roughly, explanations of why\nthings happen, where the “things” in question can be\neither particular events or something more general—e.g.,\nregularities or repeatable patterns in nature. Paradigms of this sort\nof explanation include: the explanation for the advance in the\nperihelion of mercury provided by General Relativity, the explanation\nof the extinction of the dinosaurs in terms of the impact of a large\nasteroid at the end of the Cretaceous period, the explanation provided\nby the police for why a traffic accident occurred (the driver was\nspeeding and there was ice on the road), and the standard explanation\nprovided in economics textbooks for why monopolies will, in comparison\nwith firms in perfectly competitive markets, raise prices and reduce\noutput. \nFinally, a few words about the broader epistemological and\nmethodological background to the models described below. Many\nphilosophers think of concepts like “explanation”,\n“law”, “cause”, and “support for\ncounterfactuals” as part of an interrelated family of concepts\nthat are “modal” in character. For familiar\n“empiricist” reasons, Hempel and many other early\ndefenders of the DN model regarded these concepts as not well\nunderstood, at least prior to analysis. It was assumed that it would\nbe “circular” to explain one concept from this family in\nterms of others from the same family and that they must instead be\nexplicated in terms of other concepts from outside the modal\nfamily—concepts that more obviously satisfied (what were taken\nto be) empiricist standards of intelligibility and testability. For\nexample, in Hempel’s version of the DN model, the\nnotion of a “law” plays a key role in explicating the\nconcept of “explanation”, and his assumption is that laws\nare just regularities that meet certain further conditions that are\nalso acceptable to empiricists. As we shall see, these empiricist\nstandards (and an accompanying unwillingness to employ modal concepts\nas primitives) have continued to play a central role in the models of\nexplanation developed subsequent to the DN model. \nA related issue has to do with whether all scientific explanations are\ncausal and if not, what distinguishes causal from non-causal\nexplanations. Hempel recognized both causal and non-causal forms of\nexplanation but held that both were captured by the DN model\n–in his view, causal explanations are simply DN\nexplanations that cite causal laws (which he regarded as a proper\nsubset of all laws). Many but not all of the accounts discussed below\nin effect assume that many of the problems with the DN model can be\ntraced to its commitment to an inadequate account of causation; thus\nthat getting clearer about causal notions would lead to more\nadequate accounts of explanation. By contrast, a substantial amount of\nrecent discussion of explanation has moved away from this focus on\ncausation and instead explores the possibility of non-causal forms of\nexplanation.[1] \nSuggested Readings: Salmon (1989) is a superb\ncritical survey of all the models of scientific explanation discussed\nin this entry. Kitcher and Salmon (1989), Pitt (1988), and Ruben\n(1993) are anthologies that contain a number of influential\narticles. \nAccording to the Deductive-Nomological Model, a scientific explanation\nconsists of two major “constituents”: an\nexplanandum, which is a sentence “describing the\nphenomenon to be explained” and an explanans,\n“the class of those sentences which are adduced to account for\nthe phenomenon” (Hempel & Oppenheim 1948 [1965: 247]). For\nthe explanans to successfully explain the explanandum several\nconditions must be met. First, “the explanandum must be a\nlogical consequence of the explanans” and “the sentences\nconstituting the explanans must be true” (Hempel 1948 [1965:\n248]). That is, the explanation should take the form of a sound\ndeductive argument in which the explanandum follows as a conclusion\nfrom the premises in the explanans. This is the\n“deductive” component of the model. Second, the explanans\nmust contain at least one “law of nature” and this must be\nan essential premise in the derivation in the sense that the\nderivation of the explanandum would not be valid if this premise were\nremoved. This is the “nomological” component of the\nmodel—“nomological” being a philosophical term of\nart which, suppressing some niceties, means (roughly)\n“lawful”. In its most general formulation, the DN\nmodel is meant to apply both to the explanation of “general\nregularities” or “laws” such as (to use Hempel and\nOppenheim’s examples) why light conforms to the law of\nrefraction and also to the explanation of particular events, conceived\nas occurring at a particular time and place, such as the bent\nappearance of the partially submerged oars of a rowboat on a\nparticular occasion of viewing. As an additional illustration of a\nDN explanation of a particular event, consider a derivation\nof the position of Mars at some future time from Newton’s laws\nof motion, the Newtonian inverse square law governing gravity, and\ninformation about the mass of the sun, the mass of Mars and the\npresent position and velocity of each. In this derivation the various\nNewtonian laws figure as essential premises and they are used, in\nconjunction with appropriate information about initial conditions (the\nmasses of Mars and the sun and so on), to derive the explanandum (the\nfuture position of Mars) via a deductively valid argument. The\nDN criteria are thus satisfied. \nThe notion of a sound deductive argument is (arguably) relatively\nclear (or at least something that can be regarded as antecedently\nunderstood from the point of view of characterizing scientific\nexplanation). But what about the other major component of the\nDN model—that of a law of nature? The basic intuition\nthat guides the DN model goes something like this: Within the\nclass of true generalizations, we may distinguish between those that\nare only “accidentally true” and those that are\n“laws”. To use Hempel’s examples, the\ngeneralization \nis, if true, only accidentally so. In contrast, \nis a law. Thus, according to the DN model, the latter\ngeneralization can be used, in conjunction with information that some\nparticular sample of gas has been heated under constant pressure, to\nexplain why it has expanded. By contrast, the former generalization\n (1)\n in conjunction with the information that a particular person n\nis a member of the 1964 Greensbury school board, cannot be used to\nexplain why n is bald. \nWhile this example may seem clear enough, what exactly is it that\ndistinguishes true accidental generalizations from laws? This has been\nthe subject of a great deal of philosophical discussion, most of which\nmust be beyond the scope of this\n entry.[2]\n For reasons explained in\n Section 1,\n Hempel assumes that an adequate account must explain the notion of\nlaw in terms of notions that lie outside the modal\n family.[3]\n He considers (1965b) a number\nof familiar proposals having this\n character[4]\n and finds them all wanting, remarking that the problem of\ncharacterizing the notion of law has proved “highly\nrecalcitrant” (1965b: 338). It seems fair to say, however, that\nhis underlying assumption is that, at bottom, laws are just\nexceptionless generalizations describing regularities that meet\ncertain additional distinguishing conditions that he is not at present\nable to formulate. In subsequent decades, a variety of criteria for\nlawhood have been proposed. Of these the so-called best systems\nanalysis (Lewis 1973) is\nprobably the most popular, but no single account has won general\nacceptance. Finding an adequate characterization of lawhood is thus an\nongoing issue for the DN model.  \nOne point at which this issue is particularly pressing concerns the\nexplanatory status of the so-called special sciences—biology,\npsychology, economics and so on. These sciences are full of\ngeneralizations that appear to play an explanatory role and yet fail\nto satisfy many of the standard criteria for lawfulness. For example,\nalthough Mendel’s law of segregation (M) (which states that in\nsexually reproducing organisms each of the two alternative forms\n(alleles) of a gene specifying a trait at a locus in a given organism\nhas 0.5 probability of ending up in a gamete) is widely used in models\nin evolutionary biology, it has a number of exceptions, such as\nmeiotic drive. A similar point holds for the principles of rational\nchoice theory (such as the generalization that preferences are\ntransitive) which figure centrally in economics. Other widely used\ngeneralizations in the special sciences have very narrow scope in\ncomparison with paradigmatic laws, hold only over restricted\nspatio-temporal regions, and lack explicit theoretical\nintegration. \nThere is considerable disagreement over whether such generalizations\nare laws. Some philosophers (e.g., Woodward 2000) suggest that such\ngeneralizations satisfy too few of the standard criteria to count as\nlaws but can nevertheless figure in explanations; if so, it apparently\nfollows that we must abandon the DN requirement that all\nexplanations must appeal to laws. Others (e. g., Mitchell 1997),\nemphasizing different criteria for lawfulness, conclude instead that\ngeneralizations like (M) are laws and hence no threat to the\nrequirement that explanations must invoke laws. In the absence of a\nmore principled account of laws, it is hard to evaluate these\ncompeting claims and hence hard to assess the implications of the\nDN model for the special sciences. At the very least,\nproviding such an account is an important item of unfinished business\nfor advocates of the DN model. \nThe DN model is meant to capture explanation via deduction\nfrom deterministic laws and this raises the obvious question of the\nexplanatory status of statistical laws. Do such laws explain at all\nand if so, what do they explain, and under what conditions? Hempel\n(1965b) distinguishes two\nvarieties of statistical explanation. The first of these,\ndeductive-statistical (DS) explanation, involves the\ndeduction of “a narrower statistical uniformity” from a\nmore general set of premises, at least one of which involves a more\ngeneral statistical law. Since DS explanation involves\ndeduction of the explanandum from a law, it conforms to the same\ngeneral pattern as the DN explanation of regularities.\nHowever, in addition to DS explanation, Hempel also\nrecognizes a distinctive sort of statistical explanation, which he\ncalls inductive-statistical or IS explanation,\ninvolving the subsumption of individual events (like the recovery of a\nparticular person from streptococcus infection) under (what he regards\nas) statistical laws (such as a law specifying the probability of\nrecovery, given that penicillin has been taken). \nWhile the explanandum of a DN or DS explanation can\nbe deduced from the explanans, one cannot deduce that some particular\nindividual, John Jones, has recovered from the above statistical law\nand the information that he has taken penicillin. At most what can be\ndeduced from this information is that recovery is more or less\nprobable. In IS explanation, the relation between explanans\nand explanandum is, in Hempel’s words, “inductive,”\nrather than deductive—hence the name inductive-statistical\nexplanation. The details of Hempel’s account are complex, but\nthe underlying idea is roughly this: an IS explanation will\nbe good or successful to the extent that its explanans confers high\nprobability on its explanandum outcome. \nThus if it is a statistical law that the probability of recovery from\nstreptococcus, given that one has taken penicillin, is high, and Jones\nhas taken penicillin and recovered, this information can be used to\nprovide an IS explanation of Jones’s recovery. However\nif the probability of recovery is low (e.g., less than 0.5), given\nthat Jones has taken penicillin, then, even if Jones recovers, we\ncannot use this information to provide an IS explanation of\nhis recovery. \nWhy suppose that all (or even some) explanations have a DN or\nIS structure? There are two ideas which play a central\nmotivating role in Hempel’s (1965b) discussion. The first connects the information provided by\na DN argument with a certain conception of what it is to\nachieve understanding of why something happens—it appeals to an\nidea about the object or point of giving an explanation. Hempel\nwrites \n… a DN explanation answers the question\n“Why did the explanandum-phenomenon occur?” by\nshowing that the phenomenon resulted from certain particular\ncircumstances, specified in \\(C_1,C_2,\\ldots,C_k\\), in accordance with\nthe laws \\(L_1,L_2,\\ldots,L_{\\gamma}\\). By pointing this out, the\nargument shows that, given the particular circumstances and the laws\nin question, the occurrence of the phenomenon was to be\nexpected; and it is in this sense that the explanation enables us\nto understand why the phenomenon occurred. (1965b: 337,\nitalics in original) \nOne can think of IS explanation as involving a natural\ngeneralization of this idea. While an IS explanation does not\nshow that the explanandum-phenomenon was to be expected with\ncertainty, it does the next best thing: it shows that the\nexplanandum-phenomenon is at least to be expected with high\nprobability and in this way provides understanding. Stated more\ngenerally, both the DN and IS models, share the\ncommon idea that, as Salmon (1989) puts it,  \nthe essence of scientific explanation can be described as nomic\nexpectability—that is expectability on the basis of lawful\nconnections. (1989: 57) \nThe second main motivation for the DN/IS model has to do with\nthe role of causal claims in scientific explanation. There is\nconsiderable disagreement among philosophers about whether all\nexplanations in science and in ordinary life are causal and also\ndisagreement about what the distinction (if any) between causal and\nnon-causal explanations consists in. Nonetheless, virtually everyone,\nincluding Hempel, agrees that many scientific explanations cite\ninformation about causes. However, Hempel, along with most other early\nadvocates of the DN model, is unwilling to take the notion of\ncausation as primitive in the theory of explanation—that is, he\nwas unwilling to simply say that X figures in an explanation of\nY if and only if X causes Y. Instead, adherents\nof the DN model have generally looked for an account of\ncausation that satisfies the empiricist requirements described in\n Section 1.\n In particular, advocates of the DN model have generally\naccepted a broadly Humean or regularity theory of causation, according\nto which (very roughly) all causal claims imply the existence of some\ncorresponding regularity (a “law”) linking cause to\neffect. This is then taken to show that all causal explanations\n“imply,” perhaps only “implicitly,” that such\na law/regularity exists and hence that laws are “involved”\nin all such explanations, just as the DN model claims. \nTo illustrate this line of argument, consider \n\n (3)\n is a so-called singular causal explanation, advanced by Michael\nScriven (1962) as a counterexample to the claim that the DN\nmodel describes necessary conditions for successful explanation.\nAccording to Scriven,\n (3)\n explains the tipping over of the inkwell even though no law or\ngeneralization figures explicitly in\n (3)\n and\n (3)\n appears to consist of a single sentence, rather than a deductive\nargument. Hempel’s response (1965b: 360ff) is that the\noccurrence of “caused” in\n (3)\n should not be left unanalyzed or taken as explanatory just as it\nstands. Instead\n (3)\n should be understood as “implicitly” or\n“tacitly” claiming there is a “law” or\nregularity linking knee impacts to tipping over of inkwells. According\nto Hempel, it is the implicit claim that some such law holds that\n“distinguishes”\n (3)\n from “a mere sequential narrative” in which the spilling\nis said to follow the impact but without any claim of causal\nconnection—a narrative that (Hempel thinks) would clearly not be\nexplanatory. This linking law is the nomological premise in the\nDN argument that, according to Hempel, is\n“implicitly” asserted by\n (3). \nThe basic idea is thus that a proper explication of the role of causal\nclaims in explanation leads via a Humean or regularity theory of\ncausation, to the conclusion that, at least ideally, explanations\nshould satisfy the DN/IS model. Let us call this line of\nargument the “hidden structure” argument in recognition of\nthe role it assigns to a hidden (or at least non-explicit) DN\nstructure that is claimed to be associated with\n (3). \nAt this point a comment is in order regarding a feature of this\nproposal that may seem puzzling. The boundaries of the category\n“scientific explanation” are far from clear, but while\n (3)\n is arguably an explanation, it is not what one usually thinks of as\n“science”—instead it is a claim from “ordinary\nlife” or “common sense”. This raises the question of\nwhy adherents of the DN/IS model don’t simply respond\nto the alleged counterexample\n (3)\n by denying that it is an instance of the category “scientific\nexplanation”—that is, by claiming that the DN/IS\nmodel is not an attempt to reconstruct the structure of explanations\nlike\n (3)\n but is rather only meant to apply to explanations that are properly\nregarded as “scientific”. The fact that this response is\nnot often adopted by advocates of the DN model is an\nindication of the extent to which, as noted in\n Section 1,\n it is implicitly assumed in most discussions of scientific\nexplanation that there are important similarities or continuities in\nstructure between explanations like\n (3)\n and explanations that are more obviously scientific and that these\nsimilarities that should be captured by some common account that\napplies to both. Indeed, it is a striking feature not just of Hempel\n(1965b) but of many other\ntreatments of scientific explanation that much of the discussion in\nfact focuses on “ordinary life” singular causal\nexplanations similar to\n (3),\n the tacit assumption being that conclusions about the structure of\nsuch explanations have fairly direct implications for understanding\nexplanation in science. \nAs explained above, examples like\n (3)\n are potential counterexamples to the claim that the DN model\nprovides necessary conditions for explanation. There are also\na number of well-known counterexamples to the claim that the\nDN model provides sufficient conditions for\nsuccessful scientific explanation. Here are two illustrations. \nExplanatory Asymmetries. There are many cases in\nwhich a derivation of an explanandum E from a law L and\ninitial conditions I seems explanatory but a\n“backward” derivation of I from E and the\nsame law L does not seem explanatory, even though the latter,\nlike the former, appears to meet the criteria for successful\nDN explanation. For example, one can derive the length\ns of the shadow cast by a flagpole from the height h of\nthe pole and the angle θ of the sun above the horizon and laws\nabout the rectilinear propagation of light. This derivation meets the\nDN criteria and seems explanatory. On the other hand, the\nfollowing derivation from the same laws also meets the DN\ncriteria but does not seem explanatory: \nExamples like this suggest that at least some explanations possess\ndirectional or asymmetric features to which the DN model is\ninsensitive. \nExplanatory Irrelevancies. A derivation can satisfy\nthe DN criteria and yet be a defective explanation because it\ncontains irrelevancies besides those associated with the directional\nfeatures of explanation. Consider an example due to Wesley Salmon\n(1971a: 34): \nIt is arguable that (L) meets the criteria for lawfulness\nimposed by Hempel and many other writers. (If one wants to deny that\n(L) is a law one needs some principled, generally accepted\nbasis for this judgment and, as explained above, it is unclear what\nthis basis is.) Moreover,\n (5)\n is certainly a sound deductive argument in which (L) occurs as\nan essential premise. Nonetheless, most people judge that (L)\nand (K) are no explanation of (E). There are many other\nsimilar illustrations. For example (Kyburg 1965), it is presumably a\nlaw (or at least an exceptionless, counterfactual supporting\ngeneralization) that all samples of table salt that have been hexed by\nbeing touched with the wand of a witch dissolve when placed in water.\nOne may use this generalization as a premise in a DN\nderivation which has as its conclusion that some particular hexed\nsample of salt has dissolved in water. But again the hexing is\nirrelevant to the dissolving and such a derivation is no\nexplanation. \nOne obvious diagnosis of the difficulties posed by examples like\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n focuses on the role of causation in explanation. According to this\nanalysis, to explain an outcome we must cite its causes and\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n fail to do this. As Salmon (1989a: 47) puts it,  \na flagpole of a certain height causes a shadow of a given length and\nthereby explains the length of the shadow.  \nBy contrast,  \nthe shadow does not cause the flagpole and consequently cannot explain\nits height.  \nSimilarly, taking birth control pills does not cause Jones’\nfailure to get pregnant and this is why\n (5)\n fails to be an acceptable explanation. On this analysis, what\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n show is that a derivation can satisfy the DN criteria and\nyet fail to identify the causes of an explanandum—when this\nhappens the derivation will fail to be explanatory. \nAs explained above, advocates of the DN model would not\nregard this diagnosis as very illuminating, unless accompanied by some\naccount of causation that does not simply take this notion as\nprimitive. (Salmon in fact provides such an account, which we will\nconsider in\n Section 4.)\n We should note, however, that an apparent lesson of\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n is that the regularity account of causation favored by DN\ntheorists is at best incomplete: the occurrence of c, e,\nand the existence of some regularity or law linking them (or\nx’s having property P and x’s having\nproperty Q and some law linking these) is not a\nsufficient condition for the truth of the claim that c caused\n or x’s having P is causally or\nexplanatorily relevant to x’s having Q. More\ngenerally, if the counterexamples\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n are accepted, it follows that the DN model fails to state\nsufficient conditions for explanation. Explaining an outcome\nisn’t just a matter of showing that it is nomically\nexpectable. \nThere are two possible reactions one might have to this observation.\nOne is that the idea that explanation is a matter of nomic\nexpectability is correct as far as it goes, but that something more is\nrequired as well. According to this assessment, the DN/IS\nmodel does state a necessary condition for successful\nexplanation and, moreover, a condition that is a non-redundant part of\na set of conditions that are jointly sufficient for explanation.\nHowever, some other, independent feature, X (which will account\nfor the directional features of explanation and insure the kind of\nexplanatory relevance that is apparently missing in the birth control\nexample) must be added to the DN model to achieve a\nsuccessful account of explanation. The idea is thus that Nomic\nExpectability + X = Explanation. Something like this idea is endorsed, by\nthe unificationist models of explanation developed by Friedman (1974)\nand Kitcher (1989), which are discussed in\n Section 5\n below. \nA second, more radical possible conclusion is that the DN\naccount of the goal or rationale of explanation is mistaken in some\nmuch more fundamental way and that the DN model does not even\nstate necessary conditions for successful explanation. As noted above,\nunless the hidden structure argument is accepted, this conclusion is\nstrongly suggested by examples like\n (3)\n (“The impact of my knee caused the tipping over of the\ninkwell”) which appear to involve explanation without the\nexplicit citing of a law or a deductive structure. \nSuggested Readings. The most authoritative and\ncomprehensive statement of the DN and IS models is\nprobably Hempel (1965b). This is reprinted in Hempel 1965a, along with\na number of other papers that touch on various aspects of the problem\nof scientific explanation. In addition to the references cited in this\nsection, Salmon (1989: 46ff.) describes a number of well-known\ncounterexamples to the DN/IS models and discusses their\nsignificance. \nMuch of the subsequent literature on explanation has been motivated by\nattempts to capture the features of causal or explanatory relevance\nthat appear to be left out of examples like\n (4)\n and\n (5),\n typically within the empiricist constraints described above. Wesley\nSalmon’s statistical relevance (or SR) model (Salmon\n1971a) is a very influential attempt to capture these features in\nterms of the notion of statistical relevance or conditional dependence\nrelationships. Given some class or population \\(A\\), an attribute\n\\(C\\) will be statistically relevant to another attribute\n\\(B\\) if and only if \\(P(B\\pmid A.C) \\ne P(B\\pmid A)\\)—that is,\nif and only if the probability of \\(B\\) conditional on \\(A\\) and \\(C\\)\nis different from the probability of \\(B\\) conditional on \\(A\\) alone.\nThe intuition underlying the SR model is that statistically\nrelevant properties (or information about statistically relevant\nrelationships) are explanatory and statistically irrelevant properties\nare not. In other words, the notion of a property making a difference\nfor an explanandum is unpacked in terms of statistical relevance\nrelationships. \nAs an illustration, suppose that in the birth control pills example\n (5)\n the original population T includes both sexes. Then \nwhile \nassuming that not all women in the population take birth control\npills. In other words, if you are a male in this population, taking\nbirth control pills is statistically irrelevant to whether you become\npregnant, while if you are a female it is relevant. Thus taking birth\ncontrol pills is explanatorily irrelevant to pregnancy among males but\nnot among females. \nTo characterize the SR model more precisely we need the\nnotion of a homogenous partition. A homogenous partition of\n\\(A\\) is a set of subclasses or cells \\(C_i\\) of \\(A\\) that are\nmutually exclusive and exhaustive, where \\(P(B\\pmid A.C_i) \\ne\nP(B\\pmid A.C_j)\\) for all \\(C_i \\ne C_j\\) and where no further\nstatistically relevant partition of any of the cells \\(A\\), \\(C_i\\)\ncan be made with respect to \\(B\\)—that is, there are no\nadditional attributes \\(D_k\\) in \\(A\\) such that  \nOn the SR model, an explanation of why some member x\nof the class characterized by attribute \\(A\\) has attribute \\(B\\)\nconsists of the following information: \nTo employ one of Salmon’s examples, suppose we want to construct\nan SR explanation of why x who has a strep infection =\nS, recovers quickly = Q. Let \\(T(-T)\\) according to\nwhether x is (is not) treated with penicillin, and \\(R(-R)\\) =\naccording to whether x has a penicillin-resistant strain.\nAssume for the sake of argument that no other factors are relevant to\nquick recovery. There are four possible combinations of these\nproperties: \\(T.R,\\) \\(-T.R,\\) \\(T.{-R},\\) \\({-T}.{-R},\\) but let us\nassume that \nThat is, the probability of quick recovery, given that one has strep,\nis the same for those who have the resistant strain regardless of\nwhether or not they are treated and also the same for those who have\nnot been treated. By contrast, the probability of recovery is\ndifferent (presumably greater) among those with strep who have been\ntreated and do not have the resistant strain. \nIn this case \nis a homogenous partition of S with respect to Q. The\nSR explanation of x’s recovery will consist of a\nstatement of the probability of quick recovery among all those with\nstrep ((i) above), a statement of the probability of recovery in each\nof the two cells of the above partition ((ii) above), and the cell to\nwhich x belongs, which is \\(S.T.R\\) ((iii) above). Intuitively,\nthe idea is that this information tells us about the relevance of each\nof the possible combinations of the properties T and R\nto quick recovery among those with strep and is explanatory for just\nthis reason. \nThe SR model has a number of distinctive features that have\ngenerated substantial discussion. First, note that according to the\nSR model, and in contrast to the DN/IS model, an\nexplanation is not an argument—either in the sense of a\ndeductively valid argument in which the explanandum follows as a\nconclusion from the explanans or in the sense of a so-called inductive\nargument in which the explanandum follows with high probability from\nthe explanans, as in the case of IS explanation. Instead, an\nexplanation is an assembly of information that is statistically\nrelevant to an explanandum. Salmon argues (and takes the birth control\nexample\n (5)\n to illustrate) that the criteria that a good argument must satisfy\n(e.g., criteria that insure deductive soundness or some inductive\nanalogue) are simply different from those a good explanation must\nsatisfy. Among other things, as Salmon puts it, “irrelevancies\n[are] harmless in arguments but fatal in explanations” (1989:\n102). As explained above, in associating successful explanation with\nthe provision of information about statistical relevance\nrelationships, the SR model attempts to accommodate this\nobservation. \nA second, closely related point is that the SR model departs\nfrom the IS model in abandoning the idea that a statistical\nexplanation of an outcome must provide information from which it\nfollows the outcome occurred with high probability. As the reader may\ncheck, the statement of the SR model above imposes no such\nhigh probability requirement; instead, even very unlikely outcomes\nwill be explained as long as the criteria for SR explanation\nare met. Suppose that, in the above example, the probability of quick\nrecovery from strep, given treatment and the presence of a\nnon-resistant strain, is rather low (e.g., 0.2). Nonetheless, if the\ncriteria (i)–(iii) above—a homogeneous partition with\ncorrect probability values for each cell in the partition—are\nsatisfied, we may use this information to explain why x, who\nhad a non-resistant strain of strep and was treated, recovered\nquickly. Indeed, according to the SR model, we may explain\nwhy some x which is A is B, even if the\nconditional probability of B given A and the cell\n\\(C_i\\) to which x belongs \\((p_i = P(B\\pmid A.C_i))\\) is\nless than the prior probability \\((p = P(B\\pmid A))\\) of\nB in A. For example, if the prior probability of quick\nrecovery among all those with any form of strep is 0.5 and the\nprobability of quick recovery of those with a resistant strain who are\nuntreated is 0.1, we may nonetheless explain why y, who meets\nthese last conditions \\(({-T}.R),\\) recovered quickly (assuming he\ndid) by citing the cell to which he belongs, the probability of\nrecovery given that he falls in this cell, and the other sort of\ninformation described above. More generally, what matters on the\nSR model is not whether the value of the probability of the\nexplanandum-outcome is high or low (or even high or low in comparison\nwith its prior probability) but rather whether the putative explanans\ncites all and only statistically relevant factors and whether the\nprobabilities it invokes are correct. One consequence of this, which\nSalmon endorses while acknowledging that many will regard it as\nunintuitive, is that on the SR model, the same explanans\nE may explain both an explanandum M and explananda that\nare inconsistent with M, such as \\(-M\\). For example, the same\nexplanans will explain both why a subject with strep and certain other\nproperties (e.g., T and \\(-R\\)) recovers quickly, if he does,\nand also why he does not recover if he does not. By contrast, on the\nDN or IS models, if E explains M,\nE cannot also explain \\(-M\\). \nThis judgment that, contrary to the IS model, the value that\na candidate explanans assigns to an explanandum-outcome should not\nmatter for the goodness of the explanation, is motivated as follows:\nWhen an outcome is the result of a genuinely indeterministic process\nwe understand both high probability and low probability outcomes (the\nlatter of which of course will sometimes occur) equally well: in both\ncases, once an SR model has been constructed, there are no additional\nfactors that distinguish the two outcomes. \nStepping back from the issues (such as the status of the high\nprobability requirement) that have dominated discussions of\nstatistical explanation, there are several more general issues that\ndeserve mention. One is that these models have been applied to a range\nof examples that seem prima-facie to be quite different, including\nquantum mechanical examples (e.g., radioactive decay) but also more\nordinary examples such as recovery from disease and (to use an example\nof Salmon’s) causes of juvenile delinquency. Radioactive decay\nis a process that is usually taken to be irreducibly indeterministic\nand hence is the sort of thing that Salmon’s objective\nhomogeneity requirement is designed to capture. By contrast, although\nthe evidence for many models of juvenile delinquency comes from\npopulation level statistics these models do not assume that\ndelinquency is the outcome of an irreducibly indeterministic process\n(and the models themselves are very far from satisfying an objective\nhomogeneity requirement). Indeed, taken literally, standard causal\nmodels assume the opposite: the assumed equations are deterministic\nwith the stochastic element supplied by an “error term”.\nThis raises the question of whether it is sensible to look for a\nsingle model that captures all of these examples. \nA second, more radical assessment focuses on the question of whether\nit is appropriate to think of the sorts of statistical theories and\nhypotheses on which Hempel and Salmon discuss as explaining individual\nevents or outcomes at all. For example, why not instead take quantum\nmechanics to explain (i) the probabilities with which\nindividual outcomes like decay events occur but not (ii) those\nindividual outcomes themselves? If we adopt (i) the relationship\nbetween a quantum mechanical model and such explananda will be\ndeductive and thus subsumable under whatever model of deductive\nexplanation we favor. This raises the question of what additional work\nis accomplished by models of statistical explanation of either the\nIS or SR sort.  \nPutting aside the issues raised in the previous section, the SR model\nembodies several generic assumptions of ongoing philosophical\ninterest. In particular the model assumes that (i) explanations must\ncite causal relationships and that (ii) causal relationships are fully\ncaptured by statistical relevance (or conditional dependence and\nindependence) relationships. While (i) is a matter of current\ncontroversy, (ii) is clearly false. As a substantial body of\n work[5]\n has made clear, causal relationships are greatly underdetermined by\nstatistical relevance relationships, even given additional\nassumptions. For example, a structure in which B is a common\ncause of the joint effects A and C implies (assuming the\nCausal Markov assumption which is the appropriate generalization of\nSalmon’s assumptions connecting causation and probability)\nimplies the same statistical relevance relations as a chain structure\nin which A causes B which causes C.  \nSelected Readings. Salmon (1971a) provides a detailed\nstatement and defense of the SR model. This essay, as well as\npapers by Jeffrey (1969) and Greeno (1970) which defend views broadly\nsimilar to the SR model, are collected in Salmon (1971b).\nAdditional discussion of the model as well as a more recent\ncharacterization of “objective homogeneity” can be found\nin Salmon (1984). Cartwright (1979) contains some influential\ncriticisms of the SR model. Theorems specifying the precise\nextent of the underdetermination of causal claims by evidence about\nstatistical relevance relationships can be found in Spirtes, Glymour\nand Scheines (1993 [2000: chapter 4]). For additional discussion of\n“screening off” and the principle of the common cause, see\nthe entry on\n Reichenbach’s Principle of the Common Cause. \nIn more recent work (especially, Salmon 1984) Salmon abandoned the\nattempt to characterize explanation or causal relationships in purely\nstatistical terms. Instead, he developed a new account which he called\nthe Causal Mechanical (CM) model of explanation—an\naccount which is similar in both content and spirit to so-called\ncausal process theories of causation of the sort\ndefended by philosophers like Philip Dowe (2000). We may think of the\nCM model as an attempt to capture the “something\nmore” involved in causal and explanatory relationships over and\nabove facts about statistical relevance, again while attempting to\nremain within a broadly Humean framework. \nThe CM model employs several central ideas. A causal\nprocess is a physical process, like the movement of a baseball\nthrough space, that is characterized by the ability to transmit a\nmark in a continuous way. (“Continuous”\ngenerally, although perhaps not always, means “spatio-temporally\ncontinuous”.) Intuitively, a mark is some local modification to\nthe structure of a process—for example, a scuff on the surface\nof a baseball or a dent an automobile fender. A process is capable of\ntransmitting a mark if, once the mark is introduced at one\nspatio-temporal location, it will persist to other spatio-temporal\nlocations even in the absence of any further interaction. In this\nsense the baseball will transmit the scuff mark from one location to\nanother. Similarly, a moving automobile is a causal process because a\nmark in the form of a dent in a fender will be transmitted by this\nprocess from one spatio-temporal location to another. Causal processes\ncontrast with pseudo-processes which lack the ability to\ntransmit marks. An example is the shadow of a moving physical object.\nThe intuitive idea is that, if we try to mark the shadow by modifying\nits shape at one point (for example, by altering a light source or\nintroducing a second occluding object), this modification will not\npersist unless we continually intervene to maintain it as the shadow\noccupies successive spatio-temporal positions. In other words, the\nmodification will not be transmitted by the structure of the shadow\nitself, as it would in the case of a genuine causal process. \nWe should note for future reference that, as characterized by Salmon,\nthe ability to transmit a mark is clearly a counterfactual notion, in\nseveral senses. To begin with, a process may be a causal process even\nif it does not in fact transmit any mark, as long as it is true that\nif it were appropriately marked, it would transmit the mark.\nMoreover, the notion of marking itself involves a counterfactual\ncontrast—a contrast between how a process behaves when marked\nand how it would behave if left unmarked. Although Salmon, like\nHempel, has always been suspicious of counterfactuals, his view at the\ntime that he first introduced the CM model was that the\ncounterfactuals involved in the characterization of mark transmission\nwere relatively unproblematic, in part because they seemed\nexperimentally testable in a fairly direct way. Nonetheless the\nreliance of the CM model, as originally formulated, on\ncounterfactuals shows that it does not completely satisfy the Humean\nstrictures described above. In subsequent work, described in\n Section 4.4\n below, Salmon attempted to construct a version of the CM\nmodel that completely avoids reliance on counterfactuals. \nThe other major element in Salmon’s model is the notion of a\ncausal interaction. A causal interaction involves a\nspatio-temporal intersection between two causal processes which\nmodifies the structure of both—each process comes to have\nfeatures it would not have had in the absence of the interaction. A\ncollision between two cars that dents both is a paradigmatic causal\ninteraction. \nAccording to the CM model, an explanation of some event\nE will trace the causal processes and interactions leading up\nto E (Salmon calls this the etiological aspect of the\nexplanation), or at least some portion of these, as well as describing\nthe processes and interactions that make up the event itself (the\nconstitutive aspect of explanation). In this way, the\nexplanation shows how E “fit[s] into a causal\nnexus”(1984: 9). For example, when two billiard balls collide\n(event E), the trajectory of each of the balls is a causal\nprocess (as shown by the fact that if the balls were scratched, such\nmarks would persist) and their collision is a causal interaction.\nExplaining E will involve both tracing these trajectories and\nnoting that E involves an interaction. \nAs the billiard example illustrates, the CM model takes as\nits paradigms of causal interaction examples such as collisions in\nwhich there is “action by contact” and no spatio-temporal\ngaps in the transmission of causal influence. There is little doubt\nthat explanations in which there are no such gaps (no “action at\na distance”) often strike us as particularly satisfying.\nHowever, as Christopher Hitchcock shows in an illuminating paper\n(Hitchcock 1995), even here the CM model leaves out something\nimportant. Consider the usual elementary textbook “scientific\nexplanation” of the motion of the balls in the above example\nfollowing their collision. This explanation proceeds by deriving that\nmotion from information about their masses and velocity before the\ncollision, the assumption that the collision is perfectly elastic, and\nthe law of the conservation of linear momentum. We usually think of\nthe information conveyed by this derivation as showing that it is the\nmass and velocity of the balls, rather than, say, the scratches on\ntheir surface or chalk that may be transmitted by the cue stick that\nis explanatorily relevant to their subsequent motion. However, it is\nhard to see what in the CM model allows us to pick out the\nlinear momentum of the balls, as opposed to these other features, as\nexplanatorily relevant. Part of the difficulty is that to express such\nrelatively fine-grained judgments of explanatory relevance (that it is\nlinear momentum rather than chalk marks that matters) we need to talk\nabout relationships between properties or magnitudes and it is not\nclear how to express such judgments purely in terms of facts about\ncausal processes and interactions. Both the linear momentum and the\nchalk mark communicated to the cue ball by the cue stick are marks\ntransmitted by the spatio-temporally continuous causal process\nconsisting of the motion of the cue ball. \nIronically, as Hitchcock goes on to note, a similar observation may be\nmade about the birth control pills example\n (5)\n originally devised by Salmon to illustrate the failure of the\nDN model to capture the notion of explanatory relevance.\nSpatio-temporally continuous causal processes that transmit marks as\nwell as causal interactions are at work when male Mr. Jones ingests\nbirth control pills—the pills dissolve, components enter his\nbloodstream, are metabolized or processed in some way, and so on.\nSimilarly, spatio-temporally continuous causal processes (albeit\ndifferent processes) are at work when female Ms. Jones takes birth\ncontrol pills. However, the pills are irrelevant to Mr. Jones’s\nnon-pregnancy, and relevant to Ms. Jones’s non-pregnancy. Again,\nit looks as though the relevance or irrelevance of the birth control\npills to Mr. or Ms. Jones’s failure to become pregnant cannot be\ncaptured just by asking whether the processes leading up to these\noutcomes are causal processes in Salmon’s sense.  \nA more general way of putting the problem revealed by these examples\nis that those features of a process P in virtue of which it\nqualifies as a causal process (ability to transmit mark M) may\nnot be the features of P that are causally or explanatorily\nrelevant to the outcome E that we want to explain (M may\nbe irrelevant to E with some other property R of\nP being the property which is causally relevant to E).\nSo while mark transmission may well be a criterion that correctly\ndistinguishes between causal processes and\npseudo-processes, it does not, as it stands, provide the\nresources for distinguishing those features or\nproperties of a causal process that are causally or\nexplanatorily relevant to an outcome and those features that are\nirrelevant. \nA second set of worries has to do with the application of the\nCM model to systems which depart in various respects from\nsimple physical paradigms such as the collision described above. There\nare a number of examples of such systems. First, there are theories\nlike Newtonian gravitational theory which involve “action at a\ndistance” in a physically interesting sense. Second, there are a\nnumber of examples from the literature on causation that do not\ninvolve physically interesting forms of action at a distance but which\narguably involve causal interactions without intervening\nspatio-temporally continuous processes or transfer of energy and\nmomentum from cause to effect. These include cases of causation by\nomission and causation by “double prevention” or\n “disconnection.”[6]\n In all these cases, a literal application of the CM model\nseems to yield the judgment that no explanation has been\nprovided—that Newtonian gravitational theory is unexplanatory\nand so on. Many philosophers have been reluctant to accept this\nassessment. \nYet another class of examples that raise problems for the CM\nmodel involves putative explanations of the behavior of complex or\n“higher level” systems—explanations that do not\nexplicitly cite spatio-temporally continuous causal processes\ninvolving transfer of energy and momentum, even though we may think\nthat such processes are at work at a more “underlying”\nlevel. Most explanations in disciplines like biology, psychology and\neconomics fall under this description, as do a number of\nstraightforwardly physical explanations. \nAs an illustration, suppose that a mole of gas is confined to a\ncontainer of volume \\(V_1,\\) at pressure \\(P_1,\\) and temperature\n\\(T_1\\). The gas is then allowed to expand isothermally into a larger\ncontainer of volume \\(V_2\\). One standard way of explaining the\nbehavior of the gas—its rate of diffusion and its subsequent\nequilibrium pressure \\(P_2\\)—appeals to the generalizations of\nphenomenological thermodynamics—e.g., the ideal gas law,\nGraham’s law of diffusion, and so on. Salmon appears to regard\nputative explanations based on at least the first of these\ngeneralizations as not explanatory because they do not trace\ncontinuous causal processes—he thinks of the individual\nmolecules as causal processes but not the gas as a\n whole.[7]\n However, it is plainly impossible to trace the causal processes and\ninteractions represented by each of the \\(6 \\times 10^{23}\\) molecules\nmaking up the gas and the successive interactions (collisions) it\nundergoes with every other molecule. Even the usual statistical\nmechanical treatment, which Salmon presumably would regard as\nexplanatory, does not attempt to do this. Instead, it makes certain\ngeneral assumptions about the distribution of molecular velocities and\nthe forces involved in molecular collisions and then uses these, in\nconjunction with the laws of mechanics, to derive and solve a\ndifferential equation (the Boltzmann transport equation) describing\nthe overall behavior of the gas. This treatment abstracts radically\nfrom the details of the causal processes involving particular\nindividual molecules and instead focuses on identifying higher level\nvariables that aggregate over many individual causal processes and\nthat figure in general patterns that govern the behavior of the\ngas. \nThis example raises a number of questions. Just what does the\nCM model require in the case of complex systems in which we\ncannot trace individual causal processes, at least at a fine-grained\nlevel? How exactly does the causal mechanical model avoid the\n(disastrous) conclusion that any successful explanation of the\nbehavior of the gas must trace the trajectories of individual\nmolecules? Does the statistical mechanical explanation described above\nsuccessfully trace causal processes and interactions or specify a\ncausal mechanism in the sense demanded by the CM model, and\nif so, what exactly does tracing causal processes and interactions\ninvolve or amount to in connection with such a system? A fully\nadequate development of the CM model needs to address such\nquestions. \nThere is another aspect of this example that is worthy of comment.\nSuppose that a particular sample of gas expands in a way that meets\nthe conditions described above and that it is somehow possible to\nprovide an account that traces each of the individual molecular\ntrajectories of its component molecules. Such an account would\nnonetheless leave out information that seems explanatorily relevant.\nThis information has to do with the fact that there are a large number\nof alternative trajectories besides the actual trajectories followed\nby the component molecules on this particular occasion that would lead\nto the same final pressure \\(P_2\\) which is what we want to explain.\nModal information of this sort—both about what would happen if\nthe molecules followed different trajectories consistent with the\ninitial conditions \\(P_1\\), \\(V_1\\) and \\(T_1\\) and what would happen if they instead followed initial conditions consistent trajectories consistent with different macroscopic initial conditions is better captured by a treatment in terms of upper level thermodynamic variables. \nIn more recent work (e.g., Salmon 1994), prompted in part by a desire\nto avoid certain counterexamples advanced by Philip Kitcher (1989) to\nhis characterization of mark transmission, Salmon attempted to fashion\na theory of causal explanation that completely avoids any appeal to\ncounterfactuals. In this new theory which is influenced by the\nconserved process theory of causation of Dowe (2000), Salmon defined a\ncausal process as a process that transmits a non-zero amount of a\nconserved quantity at each moment in its history. Conserved\nquantities are quantities so characterized in physics—linear\nmomentum, angular momentum, charge, and so on. A causal interaction is\nan intersection of world lines associated with causal processes\ninvolving exchange of a conserved quantity. Finally, a process\ntransmits a conserved quantity from A to B if it\npossesses that quantity at every stage without any interactions that\ninvolve an exchange of that quantity in the half-open interval\n \\((A,B]\\).[8] \nOne may doubt that this new theory really avoids reliance on\ncounterfactuals, but an even more fundamental difficulty is that it\nstill does not adequately deal with the problem of causal or\nexplanatory relevance described above. That is, we still face the\nproblem that the feature that makes a process causal (transmission of\nsome conserved quantity or other) may tell us little about which\nfeatures of the process are causally or explanatorily relevant to the\noutcome we want to explain. For example, a moving billiard ball will\ntransmit many conserved quantities (linear momentum, angular momentum,\ncharge etc.) and many of these may be exchanged during a collision\nwith another ball. What is it that entitles us to single out the\nlinear momentum of the balls, rather than these other conserved\nquantities as the property that is causally relevant to their\nsubsequent motion? In cases in which there appear to be no\nconservation laws governing the explanatorily relevant property (i.e.,\ncases in which the explanatorily relevant variables are not conserved\nquantities) this difficulty seems even more acute. Properties like\n“having ingested birth control pills,” “being\npregnant”, or “being a sample of hexed salt” do not\nthemselves figure in conservation laws. While one may say that both\nbirth control pills and hexed salt are causal processes because both\nconsist, at some underlying level, of processes that unambiguously\ninvolve the transmission of conserved quantities like mass and charge,\nthis observation does not by itself tell us what, if anything, about\nthese underlying processes is relevant to pregnancy or dissolution in\nwater. \nIn a more recent paper (Salmon 1997), Salmon conceded this point. He\nagreed that the notion of a causal process cannot by itself capture\nthe notion of causal and explanatory relevance. He suggested, however,\nthat this notion can be adequately captured by appealing to the notion\nof a causal process and information about statistical\nrelevance relationships (that is, information about conditional and\nunconditional (in)dependence relationships), with the latter capturing\nthe element of causal or explanatory dependence that was missing from\nhis previous account: \nI would now say that (1) statistical relevance relations, in the\nabsence of information about connecting causal processes, lack\nexplanatory import and that (2) connecting causal processes, in the\nabsence of statistical relevance relations, also lack explanatory\nimport. (1997: 476) \nThis suggestion is not developed in any detail in Salmon’s\npaper, and it is not easy to see how it can be made to work. We noted\nabove that statistical relevance relationships often greatly\nunderdetermine the causal relationships among a set of variables. What\nreason is there to suppose that appealing to the notion of a causal\nprocess, in Salmon’s sense, will always or even usually remove\nthis indeterminacy? We also noted that the notion of a causal process\ncannot capture fine-grained notions of relevance between properties,\nthat there can be causal relevance between properties instances of\nwhich (at least at the level of description at which they are\ncharacterized) are not linked by spatio-temporally continuous or\ntransference of conserved quantities, and that properties can be so\nlinked without being causally relevant (recall the chalk mark that is\ntransmitted from one billiard ball to another). As long as it is\npossible (and why should it not be?) for different causal claims to\nimply the same facts about statistical relevance relationships and for\nthese claims to differ in ways that cannot be fully cashed out in\nterms of Salmon’s notions of causal processes and interactions,\nthis new proposal will fail as well. \nSelected Readings: Salmon (1984) provides a detailed\nstatement of the Causal Mechanical model, as originally formulated.\nSalmon (1994 and 1997) provide a restatement of the model and respond\nto criticisms. For discussion and criticism of the CM model,\nsee Kitcher (1989, especially pages 461ff), Woodward (1989), and\nHitchcock (1995). \nIn unificationist accounts of explanation developed by philosophers,\nscientific explanation is a matter of providing a unified account of a\nrange of different\n phenomena.[9]\n This idea is unquestionably intuitively appealing. Successful\nunification may exhibit connections or relationships between phenomena\npreviously thought to be unrelated and this seems to be something that\nwe expect good explanations to do. Moreover, theory unification has\nclearly played an important role in science. Paradigmatic examples\ninclude Newton’s unification of terrestrial and celestial\ntheories of motion and Maxwell’s unification of electricity and\nmagnetism. The key question, however, is whether (and which) intuitive\nnotions of unification can be made more precise in a way that allows\nus to recover the features that we think that good explanations should\npossess. \nMichael Friedman (1974) is an important early attempt to do this.\nFriedman’s formulation of the unificationist idea was\nsubsequently shown to suffer from various technical problems (Kitcher\n1976) and subsequent development of the unificationist treatment of\nexplanation has been most closely associated with Philip Kitcher\n(especially Kitcher 1989). \nLet us begin by introducing some of Kitcher’s technical\nvocabulary. A schematic sentence is a sentence in which some\nof the nonlogical vocabulary has been replaced by dummy letters. To\nuse Kitcher’s examples, the sentence “Organisms homozygous\nfor the sickling allele develop sickle cell anemia” is\nassociated with a number of schematic sentences including\n“Organisms homozygous for A develop P” and\n“For all X if X is O and A then\nX is P”. Filling instructions are\ndirections that specify how to fill in the dummy letters in schematic\nsentences. For example, filling instructions might tell us to replace\nA with the name of an allele and P with the name of a\nphenotypic trait in the first of the above schematic sentences.\nSchematic arguments are sequences of schematic sentences.\nClassifications describe which sentences in schematic\narguments are premises and conclusions and what rules of inference are\nused. An argument pattern is an ordered triple consisting of\na schematic argument, a set or sets of filling instructions, one for\neach term of the schematic argument, and a classification of the\nschematic argument. The more restrictions an argument pattern imposes\non the arguments that instantiate it, the more stringent it\nis said to be. \nRoughly speaking, Kitcher’s guiding idea is that explanation is\na matter of deriving descriptions of many different phenomena by using\nas few and as stringent argument patterns as possible over and over\nagain-the fewer the patterns used, the more stringent they are, and\nthe greater the range of different conclusions derived, the more\nunified our explanations. Kitcher summarizes this view as follows: \nScience advances our understanding of nature by showing us how to\nderive descriptions of many phenomena, using the same pattern of\nderivation again and again, and in demonstrating this, it teaches us\nhow to reduce the number of facts we have to accept as ultimate.\n(Kitcher 1989: 432) \nKitcher does not propose a completely general theory of how the\nvarious considerations he describes—number of conclusions,\nnumber of patterns and stringency of patterns—are to be\ntraded-off against one another, but does suggest that it often will be\nclear enough what these considerations imply about the evaluation of\nparticular candidate explanations. His basic strategy is to attempt to\nshow that the derivations we regard as good or acceptable explanations\nare instances of patterns that, taken together, score better according\nto the criteria just described than the patterns instantiated by what\nwe regard as defective explanations. Following Kitcher, let us define\nthe explanatory store \\(E(K)\\) as the set of argument\npatterns that maximally unifies K, the set of beliefs accepted\nat a particular time in science. Showing that a particular derivation\nis a good or acceptable explanation is then a matter of showing that\nit belongs to the explanatory store. \nAs an illustration, consider Kitcher’s treatment of the problem\nof explanatory asymmetries (recall\n Section 2.5).\n Our present explanatory practices—call these P—are\ncommitted to the idea that derivations of a flagpole’s height\nfrom the length of its shadow are not explanatory. Kitcher compares\nP with an alternative systemization in which such derivations\nare regarded as explanatory. According to Kitcher, P includes\nthe use of a single “origin and development” (OD)\npattern of explanation, according to which the dimensions of\nobjects-artifacts, mountains, stars, organisms etc. are traced to\n“the conditions under which the object originated and the\nmodifications it has subsequently undergone” (1989: 485). Now\nconsider the consequences of adding to P an additional pattern\nS (the shadow pattern) which permits the derivation of the\ndimensions of objects from facts about their shadows. Since the\nOD pattern already permits the derivation of all facts about\nthe dimensions of objects, the addition of the shadow pattern S\nto P will increase the number of argument patterns in P\nand will not allow us to derive any new conclusions. On the other\nhand, if we were to drop OD from P and replace it with\nthe shadow pattern, we would have no net change in the number of\npatterns in P, but would be able to derive far fewer\nconclusions than we would with OD, since many objects do not\nhave shadows (or enough shadows) from which to derive all of their\ndimensions. Thus OD belongs to the explanatory store, and the\nshadow pattern does not. Kitcher’s treatment of other familiar\nproblem cases is similar. For example he claims that explanations that\ncontain irrelevancies (such as Salmon’s birth control pills case\nare less unifying than competing explanations that do not contain such\nirrelevancies.  \nKitcher acknowledges that there is nothing in the unificationist\naccount per se that requires that all explanation be\ndeductive: “there is no bar in principle to the use of\nnon-deductive arguments in the systemization of our beliefs”.\nNonetheless, “the task of comparing the unifying power of\ndifferent systemizations looks even more formidable if non-deductive\narguments are considered” and in part for this reason Kitcher\nendorses the view that “in a certain sense, all explanation\nis deductive” (1989: 448). \nWhat is the role of causation on this account? Kitcher claims that\n“the ‘because’ of causation is always derivative\nfrom the ‘because’ of explanation.” (1989: 477).\nThat is, our causal judgments simply reflect the explanatory\nrelationships that fall out of our (or our intellectual\nancestors’ ) attempts to construct unified theories of nature.\nThere is no independent causal order over and above this which our\nexplanations must capture. Like many other philosophers, Kitcher takes\nvery seriously (even if in the end he perhaps does not fully endorse)\nstandard empiricist or Humean worries about the epistemic\naccessibility and intelligibility of causal claims. Taking causal,\ncounterfactual or other notions belonging to the same family as\nprimitive in the theory of explanation is problematic. Kitcher\nbelieves that it is a virtue of his theory that it does not do this.\nInstead, Kitcher proposes to begin with the notion of explanatory\nunification, characterized in terms of constraints on deductive\nsystemizations, where these constraints can be specified in a quite\ngeneral way that is independent of causal or counterfactual notions,\nand then show how the causal claims we accept derive from our efforts\nat unification. \nAs remarked at the beginning of this section, the idea that\nexplanation is connected in some way to unification is intuitively\nappealing. Nonetheless Kitcher’s particular way of cashing out\nthis connection has been subject to criticism. In connection with\nKitcher’s treatment of explanatory asymmetries, consider,\nfollowing Barnes (1992), a time-symmetric theory like Newtonian\nmechanics, applied to a closed system like the solar system. Call\nderivations of the state of motion of planets at some future time\nt from information about their present positions (at time\n\\(t_0\\)), masses, and velocities, the forces incident on them at\n\\(t_0\\), and the laws of mechanics predictive. Now contrast\nsuch derivations with retrodictive derivations in which the\npresent motions of the planets are derived from information about\ntheir future velocities and positions at t, the forces\noperative at t, and so on. It looks as though there will be\njust as many retrodictive derivations as predictive derivations, and\neach will require premises of exactly the same general\nsort—information about positions, velocities, masses, etc. and\nthe same laws. Thus the pattern or patterns instantiated by the\nretrodictive derivations look(s) exactly as unified as the pattern or\npatterns associated with the predictive derivations. However, we\nordinarily think of the predictive derivations and not the\nretrodictive derivations as explanatory and the present state of the\nplanets as the cause of their future state and not vice-versa.  \nOne possible response to this second example is to bite the bullet and\nto argue that from the point of view of fundamental physics, there\nreally is no difference in the explanatory import of the retrodictive\nand predictive derivations, and that it is a virtue, not a defect, of\nthe unificationist approach that it reproduces this judgment. Whatever\nmight be said in favor of this response, it is not Kitcher’s.\nHis claim is that our ordinary judgments about causal asymmetries can\nbe derived from the unificationist account. The example just described\ncasts doubt on this claim. More generally, it casts doubt on\nKitcher’s contention that one can begin with the notion of\nexplanatory unification, understood in a way that does not presuppose\ncausal notions, and use it to derive the content of causal\njudgments. \nSelected Readings: The most detailed statement of\nKitcher’s position can be found in Kitcher (1989). Salmon (1989:\n94ff.) contains a critical discussion of Friedman’s version of\nthe unificationist account of explanation but ends by advocating a\n“rapprochement” between unificationist approaches and\nSalmon’s own causal mechanical model. Woodward (2003) contains\nadditional criticisms of Kitcher’s version of\nunificationism. \nDespite their many differences, the accounts of Hempel (focusing now\non just the DN rather than the IS model), Salmon,\nKitcher, and others discussed above, largely share a common overall\nconception of what the project of constructing a theory of explanation\nshould involve and (to a considerable extent) what criteria such a\ntheory should satisfy if it is to be successful.\n“Pragmatic” theories of explanation depart from this\nconsensus in important respects. Let us say that a theory of\nexplanation contains “pragmatic” elements if (i) according\nto the theory, those elements require irreducible reference to facts\nabout the interests, beliefs or other features of the psychology of\nthose providing or receiving the explanation and/or (ii) irreducible\nreference to the “context” in which the explanation\noccurs. (For what this means, see below.) Although the writers\ndiscussed above agree that pragmatic elements play some role in the\nactivity of giving and receiving explanations, they assume that there\nis a non-pragmatic core to the notion of explanation, which it is the\ncentral task of a theory of explanation to capture. That is, it is\nassumed that this core notion can be specified without reference to\npsychological features of explainers or their audiences and with\nreference to non-contextual features that are sufficiently general,\nabstract and “structural,” in the sense that they hold\nacross a range of explanations with different contents and across a\nrange of different contexts. Relations like deductive entailment or\nstatistical relevance are examples of candidates for such\n“structural” relationships. In addition, these writers see\nthe goal of a theory of explanation, as capturing the notion of a\ncorrect explanation, as opposed to the notion of an\nexplanation’s being considered explanatory by a particular\naudience or not, a matter which presumably depends on such\nconsiderations as whether the audience understands the terms in which\nthe explanation is framed. (In this sense, “correctness”\nrequires (at least) that the explanans be true or “well-confirmed” and that the explanans stands in the right\nrelationship to the explanandum.) Finally, as noted in the\nIntroduction to this entry, writers in this tradition have\nnot had the goal of capturing all the various ways in which\nthe word “explanation” is used in ordinary English. They\nhave instead focused on a much more restricted class of examples in\nwhich what is of interest is (something like) explaining\n“why” some outcome or general phenomenon occurred, as\nopposed to explaining, e.g., the meaning of a word or how to solve a\ndifferential equation. The motivation for this restriction is simply\nthe judgment that an interesting and non-trivial theory is more likely\nto emerge if it is restricted in scope in this way. For ease of\nreference, let us call this the “traditional” conception\nof the task of a theory of explanation. \nSome or all of these assumptions and goals are rejected in pragmatic\naccounts of explanation. Early contributors to this approach include\nMichael Scriven (e.g., 1962) and Sylvan Bromberger (e.g., 1966), with\nmore systematic statements, due to van Fraassen (1980) and Achinstein\n(1983) appearing in the 1980s. Since it is not always clear just what\nthe points of disagreement are between pragmatic and traditional\naccounts, some orienting remarks about this will be useful before\nturning to details. Defenders of pragmatic approaches to explanation\ntypically stress the point that whether provision of a certain body of\ninformation to some audience produces understanding or is illuminating\nfor that audience depends on the background knowledge of the audience\nmembers and on other factors having to do with the local context. For\nexample, an explanation of the deflection of starlight by the sun that\nappeals to the field equations of General Relativity may be highly\nilluminating to a trained physicist but unintelligible to a layperson\nbecause of their background. Factors of this sort are grouped together\nas “pragmatic” and their influence is taken to illustrate\nat least one way in which pragmatic considerations enter into the\nnotion of explanation. \nTaken in itself, the observation just described seems completely\nuncontroversial and not in conflict with traditional approaches to\nexplanation. Indeed, as remarked above writers like Hempel and Salmon\nexplicitly agree that explanation has a pragmatic dimension in the\nsense just described—in fact, Hempel invokes the role of\npragmatic factors at a number of points to address prima-facie\ncounterexamples to the DN model. This suggests that, often at least,\nwhat is distinctive about pragmatic approaches to explanation is not\njust the bare idea that explanation has a “pragmatic\ndimension” but rather the much stronger claim that the\ntraditional project of constructing a model of explanation pursued by\nHempel and others has so far been unsuccessful ( and perhaps is\nbound to be unsuccessful) and that this is so\nbecause pragmatic or contextual factors play a central and\nineliminable role in explanation in a way that resists incorporation\ninto models of the traditional sort. On this view, much of what is\ndistinctive about pragmatic accounts is their opposition to\ntraditional accounts and their diagnosis of why such accounts\nfail—they fail because they omit pragmatic or contextual\nelements. It will be important to keep this point in mind in what\nfollows because there is a certain tendency among advocates of\npragmatic theories to argue as though the superiority of their\napproach is established simply by the observation that explanation has\na pragmatic dimension; instead it seems more appropriate to think that\nthe real issue is whether traditional approaches are inadequate in\nprinciple because of their neglect of the pragmatic dimension of\nexplanation. \nA second issue concerns an important ambiguity in the notion of\n“pragmatic”. On one natural understanding of this notion,\na pragmatic consideration is one that has to do with utility or\nusefulness in the service of some goal connected to human interests,\nwhere these interests are in some relevant sense\n“practical”. Call this notion\n“pragmatic1”. On this construal, Hempel’s\nDN model might be correctly characterized as a\npragmatic1 theory since it links explanatory information\nclosely to the provision of information that is useful for purposes of\nprediction and prediction certainly qualifies as a pragmatic goal. For\nsimilar reasons, Woodward’s (2003) theory of explanation might\nalso be counted as a pragmatic1 theory since it connects\nexplanation with the provision of information that is useful for\nmanipulation and control—unquestionably useful goals. As these\nexamples suggest, models of explanation that aspire to traditional\ngoals can be pragmatic1 theories. \nIn the context of theories of explanation, however, the label\n“pragmatic” is usually intended to suggest a somewhat\ndifferent set of associations. In particular, as noted above,\n“pragmatic” is typically used to characterize\nconsiderations having to do with facts about the psychology\n(interests, beliefs etc.) of those involved in providing or receiving\nexplanations and/or to characterize considerations involving the local\ncontext, often with the suggestion that both sets of considerations\nmay vary in complex and idiosyncratic ways that resist incorporation\ninto the sort of general theory sought by traditional\n models.[10]\n Call this set of associations “pragmatic2”. Neither Hempel’s nor Woodward’s theory is\npragmatic2. In particular, as the example of the\nDN model illustrates, the fact that a theory is\npragmatic1 in the sense that it appeals to facts about\ngoals generally shared by human beings (such as prediction) to help to\nmotivate a model of explanation does not preclude attempting\nto construct models of explanation satisfying traditional goals and\ndoes not require commitment to the idea that explanation must be\nunderstood as a pragmatic2 notion. We need to be careful to\ndistinguish these two different ways of thinking about the\n“pragmatic” dimension of explanation. \nFinally, as emphasized above, a concern with the pragmatics of\nexplanation naturally connects with an interest in the\n“psychology” of explanation and this in turn suggests the\nrelevance of empirical studies of sorts of information that various\nsubjects (ordinary folks, scientists) find explanatory, treat as\nproviding “understanding”, the distinctions subjects make\namong explanations and so on. Although there is a growing literature\nin this area, the most prominent philosophical advocates of pragmatic\napproaches to explanation have so far tended not to make use of it. In\nthis connection, it is worth pointing out that this psychological\nliterature goes well beyond the truisms found in philosophical\ndiscussion about different people finding different sorts of\ninformation explanatory depending on their interests. In particular,\npsychologists have been very interested in exploring general features\nor structural patterns present in information that various subjects\nfind explanatory. For example, Lombrozo (2010) finds evidence that\nsubjects prefer explanations that appeal to relationships that are\nrelatively stable (in the sense of continuing to hold across changing\n circumstances)[11]\n and Lien and Cheng (2000) present evidence that in cases in which the\nexplanandum \\(E\\) has a single candidate cause \\(C\\),\nsubjects prefer levels of explanation/causal description that maximize\n\\(\\Delta p = \\Pr(E\\pmid C) - \\Pr(E \\pmid \\text{not-}C)\\). \nNotice that in both cases these are relationships or patterns of the\nsort that traditional accounts of explanation attempt to capture. As\nthese examples bring out, there is no necessary incompatibility\nbetween the project of trying to formulate an account of explanation\nthat satisfies traditional goals and an interest in the psychology of\nexplanation. It may be that subjects find certain sorts of information\nexplanatory or understanding-producing because certain\nstructural features of the sort that traditional accounts attempt to\ncharacterize are present in that information—indeed this is what\nthe Lombrozo and Lien and Cheng papers suggest. Thus, we should\ndistinguish the project of investigating the empirical psychology of\nexplanation (which can be pursued with a variety of different\ncommitments about how to best theorize about explanation) from the\nmore specific claim that the characterization of what it is for an\nexplanatory relationship to hold between explanans and explanandum\nmust be given in “psychologistic” terms, in the sense that\nthis requires irreducible reference to psychological facts about\nparticular audiences such as the vagaries of what they happen to be\ninterested in.  \nOne of the most influential recent pragmatic accounts of explanation\nis associated with constructive\n empiricism.[12]\n This is the thesis, defended by Bas van Fraassen in his 1980 book,\nThe Scientific Image, that the aim of science (or at least\n“pure” science) is the construction of theories that are\n“empirically adequate” (that is, that yield a true or\ncorrect description of observables) and not, as scientific realists\nsuppose, theories that aim to tell literally true stories about\nunobservables. Relatedly, “acceptance” of a theory\ninvolves only the belief that it is empirically adequate (van Fraassen\n1980: 12). van Fraassen’s account of explanation, which is laid\nout in several articles and, most fully, in Chapter Six of his book,\nis meant to fit with this overall conception of science: it is a\nconception according to which explanation per se is not an epistemic\naim of “pure” science (empirical adequacy is the only such\naim), but rather a “pragmatic” virtue, having to do with\nthe “application” of science. (Note that the application\nof science is arguably a matter of pragmatics1. However,\nthe idea that explanation has to do with the application of science is\nused to motivate the adoption of a pragmatic2 theory of\nexplanation. We thus have an elision of the two notions of\n“pragmatic” distinguished above.) According to van\nFraassen, because explanation is a merely pragmatic virtue, a concern\nwith explanation is not something that can require scientists to move\nbeyond belief in the empirical adequacy of their theories to belief in\nthe literal truth of claims about unobservable entities. \nAccording to van Fraassen, explanations are answers to questions and\ngetting clear about the logic of questions is central to constructing\na theory of explanation. Questions can take many different forms, but\nwhen the question of interest is a “why” question,\nexplanatory queries will typically take the following form: a query\nabout why some explanandum \\(P_k\\) rather than any one of the members\nof a contrast class \\(X\\) (a set of possible alternatives to \\(P_k\\))\nobtained. In addition, some “relevance relation” \\(R\\) is\nassumed by the question. An answer \\(A\\) to this question\nwill take the form “\\(P_k\\) in contrast to (the rest of) \\(X\\)\nbecause \\(A\\), where \\(A\\) bears the relevance relation \\(R\\) to\n\\([P_k,X]\\)”. To use van Fraassen’s example, consider\n“Why is this conductor warped?” Depending on the context,\nthe intended contrast might have to with, e.g., why this particular\nconductor is warped in contrast to some other conductor that is\nunwarped. Alternatively, it might have to do with why this particular\nconductor is warped now when it was previously unwarped. The relevance\nrelation \\(R\\) similarly depends on the context and the information\nwhich the questioner is interested in obtaining. For example, \\(R\\)\nmight involve causal information (the question might be a request for\nwhat caused the warping) but it also might have to do with information\nabout function, if the context was one in which it is assumed that the\nshape of the conductor plays some functional role in a power station\nwhich the questioner wants to know about. Thus “context”\nenters into the explanation both by playing a role in specifying the\ncontrast class \\(X\\) and the relevance relation \\(R\\). van Fraassen\ndescribes various rules for the “evaluation” of answers.\nFor example, \\(P_k\\) and \\(A\\) must be true, the other members of the\ncontrast class must not be true, \\(A\\) must “favor” (raise\nthe conditional probability of) \\(P_k\\) against alternatives, and\n\\(A\\) must compare favorably with other answers to the same question,\na condition which itself has several aspects including, for example,\nwhether \\(A\\) favors the topic more than these other answers and\nwhether \\(A\\) is screened off by other answers. However, he also makes\nit clear (as the example above suggests) that a variety of different\nrelevance relations may be appropriate depending on context and that\nthe evaluation of answers also depends on context. Moreover, he\nexplicitly denies that there is anything distinctive about the\ncategory of scientific explanation that has to do with its structure\nor form—instead, a scientific explanation is simply an\nexplanation that makes use of information that is (or at least, is\ntreated as) grounded in a “scientific” theory. \nVan Fraassen sums up his view of explanation (and gestures at his\ngrounds for rejecting traditional objectivist approaches) as\nfollows: \nThe discussion of explanation went wrong at the very beginning when\nexplanation was conceived of as a relation like description: a\nrelation between a theory and a fact. Really, it is a three-term\nrelation between theory, fact, and context. No wonder that no single\nrelation between theory and fact ever managed to fit more than a few\nexamples! Being an explanation is essentially relative for an\nexplanation is an answer… it is evaluated\nvis-à-vis a question, which is a request for information. But\nexactly… what is requested differs from context to context.\n(1980: 156) \nVan Fraassen begins his chapter on explanation with a brief story that\nprovides a good point of entry into how he intends his account to\nwork. Recall from\n Section 2.5\n that a well-known counterexample to the DN model involves\nthe claim that one can explain the length S of the shadow cast\nby a flagpole in terms of the height H of the flagpole but that\n(supposedly) one cannot explain H in terms of S, despite\nthe fact that one can construct a DN derivation from S\nto H. This is commonly taken to show that the DN model\nhas left out some factor having to do with the directional or\nasymmetric features of explanation—e.g., perhaps an asymmetry in\nthe relation between cause and effect that ought to be incorporated into\none’s model of explanation. In van Fraassen’s story, a\nstraightforward causal explanation of the usual sort of S in\nterms of H (although the object in question is a tower rather\nthan a flagpole) is first offered. Then a second explanation,\naccording to which the height of the tower is “explained”\nby the fact that it was designed to cast a shadow of a certain length\nis advanced. Presumably the moral we are to draw is that as the\ncontext and perhaps the relevance relation R are varied,\nboth \nand \nare acceptable (legitimate, appropriate etc.) explanations. Moreover,\nsince these variations in context and relevance relation turn on\nvariations in what is of interest to the explainer and his audience,\nwe are further encouraged to conclude that explanatory asymmetries\nhave their source in psychological facts about people’s\ninterests and background beliefs, rather than in, say, some asymmetry\nthat exits in nature independently of these. Pragmatists about\nexplanation think that a similar conclusion holds for other features\nof the explanatory relevance relation that philosophers have tried to\ncharacterize in terms of traditional models of explanation. \nOne obvious response to this claim, made by several critics (e.g.,\nKitcher & Salmon 1987: 317), is that the example does not really\ninvolve a case in which, depending on context, H causally\nexplains S and S causally explains H. Instead,\nalthough H does causally explain S, it is (something\nlike) the desire for a shadow of length S (rather than\nS itself) that explains (or at least causally explains) the\nheight (or the choice of height) for the tower. Or, if one prefers, in\nthe latter case we are given something like a functional explanation\n(but not a causal explanation) for the height of the tower, in the\nsense that we are told what the intended function of that choice of\nheight is. On either of these diagnoses, this will not be a case in\nwhich whether H provides a causal explanation of S or\nwhether instead S provides a causal explanation of H\nshifts depending on factors having to do with the interests of the\nspeaker or audience or other contextual factors. If so, the story\nabout the tower does not show that the asymmetry present in the\nflagpole example must be accounted for in terms of pragmatic factors.\nIt may be accounted for in some other way. In fact, although\ndiscussion must be beyond the scope of this entry, a number of\npossible candidates for such a non-pragmatic account of causal\nasymmetries have been proposed, both in philosophy and outside of it\n(for example, in the machine learning\n literature[13]).\n  \nA much more general criticism has been advanced against van\nFraassen’s version of a pragmatic theory by Kitcher and Salmon\n(1987). Basically, their complaint is that the relevance relation\nR in van Fraassen’s account is completely unconstrained,\nwith the (in their view, obviously unacceptable) consequence that for\nany pair of true propositions P and A, answer A\nis relevant to P via some relevance relation and thus\n“explains” P. For example, according to Salmon and\nKitcher, we might define a relationship of “astral\ninfluence” \\(R^*\\), meeting van Fraassen’s criteria for\nbeing a relevance relation, such that the time t of a\nperson’s death is explained in terms of \\(R^*\\) and the position\nof various heavenly bodies at t. Here it may seem that van\nFraassen has a ready response. As noted above, on van Fraassen’s\nview, background knowledge and, in the case of scientific explanation,\ncurrent scientific knowledge, helps to determine which are the\nacceptable relevance relations and acceptable answers to the questions\nposed in requests for explanation—such knowledge and the\nexpectations that go along with it are part of the relevant context\nwhen one asks for an explanation of time of death. Obviously, astral\ninfluence is not an acceptable or legitimate relevance relation\naccording to modern science—hence appeal to such a relation is\nnot countenanced as explanatory by van Fraassen’s theory. More\ngenerally it might be argued that available scientific knowledge will\nprovide constraints on the relevance relations and answers that\nexclude the “anything goes” worry raised by Salmon and\nKitcher—at least insofar as the context is one in which a\n“scientific explanation” is sought. \nWhile this response may seem plausible enough as far as it goes, it\ndoes bring out the extent to which much of the work of distinguishing\nthe explanatory from the non-explanatory in van Fraassen’s\naccount comes from a very general appeal to what is accepted as\nlegitimate background information in current science. Put differently,\nthis raises the worry that once one moves beyond van Fraassen’s\nformal machinery concerning questions and answers (which van Fraassen\nhimself acknowledges is relatively unconstraining), one is left with\nan account according to which a scientific explanation is simply any\nexplanation employing claims from current science and a currently\nscientifically approved relevance relation. Even if otherwise\nunexceptionable, this proposal is, if not exactly trivial, at least\nrather deflationary—it provides much less than many have hoped\nfor from a theory of explanation. In particular, in cases (of which\nthere are many examples) in which there is an ongoing argument or\ndispute in some area of science not about whether some proposed theory\nor model is true but rather about whether it explains some phenomenon,\nit is not easy to see how the proposal even purports to provide\nguidance. On the other hand, the obvious rejoinder that might be made\non van Fraassen’s behalf is that no more ambitious treatment\nthat would satisfy the expectations associated with more traditional\naccounts of explanation (including a demarcation of candidate\nexplanations into those that are “correct” and\n“incorrect”) is possible—a theory like van\nFraassen’s is as good as it gets. If there is no defensible\ntheory of explanation embodying a non-trivially constraining relevance\nrelation, it cannot be a good criticism of van Fraassen’s theory\nthat he fails to provide this. \nA final point that is suggested by van Fraassen’s theory is\nthis: In considering pragmatic theories, it matters a great deal\nexactly where the “pragmatic” elements are claimed to\nenter into the account of explanation. One point at which such\nconsiderations seem clearly to enter is in the selection or\ncharacterization of what an audience wants explained. This is\nreflected in van Fraassen’s theory in the choice of a \\(P_k\\)\nand an associated contrast class \\(X\\). Obviously, whether we are\nlooking for an explanation of why, say, this particular conductor is\nnow bent when it was previously straight or whether instead we want to\nknow why this conductor is bent while some other conductor is straight\nis a matter that depends on our interests. However, this particular\nsort of “interest relativity” (and associated phenomena\nhaving to do with the role of contrastive focus in the\ncharacterization of explananda, which really just serve to specify\nmore exactly which particular explananda we want explained) seems\nsomething that can be readily acknowledged by traditional\n theories.[14]\n After all, it is not a threat to the DN or other models with\nsimilar traditional aspirations that one audience may be interested in\nan explanation of the photoelectric effect but not the deflection of\nstarlight by the sun and another audience may have the opposite\ninterests. What would be a threat to the DN and similar\nmodels would be an argument that once some explanandum E is\nfully specified, whether explanans M explains E (that\nis, whether there is an explanatory relation between M and\nE) is itself “interest-relative”. It is natural to\ninterpret van Fraassen as making this latter claim, both in connection\nwith explanatory asymmetries and more generally. \nSelected Readings. van Fraassen (1980, especially\nChapter Six) and Achinstein (1983) are classic statements of pragmatic\napproaches to explanation. These pragmatic accounts are discussed and\ncriticized in Salmon (1989). van Fraassen’s account is also\ndiscussed in Kitcher and Salmon (1987). De Regt and Dieks (2005) is a\nrecent defense of what the authors describe as a\n“contextual” account of scientific understanding and which\nengages with some of the themes in the “pragmatics of\nexplanation” literature. \nWhat can we conclude from this recounting of some of the more\nprominent recent attempts to construct models of scientific\nexplanation? What important issues remain open and what are the most\npromising directions for future work? Of course, any effort at\nstock-taking will reflect a particular point of view, but with this\ncaveat in mind, several observations seem plausible, even if not\ncompletely uncontroversial. \nOne issue concerns the role of causal information in scientific\nexplanation. All of the traditional models considered above attempt to\ncapture causal explanations, although some attempt to capture\nnon-causal explanations as well. It is a natural thought (endorsed by\nmany) that many of the difficulties faced by the models described\nabove derive at least in part from their reliance on inadequate\ntreatments of causation.[15]\n The problems of explanatory asymmetries and explanatory irrelevance\ndescribed in\n Section 2.5\n seem to show that the holding of a law between C and E\nis not sufficient for C to cause E; hence not a\nsufficient condition for C to figure in an explanation of\nE. If the argument of\n section 3.3\n is correct, a fundamental problem with the SR model is that\nstatistical relevance information is insufficient to fully capture\ncausal information in the sense that different causal structures can\nbe consistent with the same information about statistical relevance\nrelationships. Similarly, the CM model faces the difficulty\nthat information about causal processes and interactions is also\ninsufficient to fully capture causal relevance relations and that\nthere is a range of cases in which causal relationships hold between\nC and E (and hence in which C figures in an\nexplanation of E) although there is no connecting causal\nprocess between C and E. Finally, a fundamental problem\nwith unificationist models is that the content of our causal judgments\ndoes not seem to fall out of our efforts at unification, at least when\nunification is understood along the lines advocated by Kitcher. For\nexample, as discussed above, considerations having to do with\nunification do not by themselves explain why it is appropriate to\nexplain effects in terms of their causes rather than vice-versa. \nThese observations suggest that insofar as we are interested in causal\nforms of scientific explanation progress may require more attention to\nthe notion of causation and a more thorough-going integration of\ndiscussions of explanation with the burgeoning literature on\ncausation, both within and outside of\n philosophy.[16]\n A number of steps in this direction have been taken. (cf. Woodward\n2003). \nDoes this mean that a focus on causation should entirely replace the\nproject of developing models of explanation or that philosophers\nshould stop talking about explanation and instead talk just about\ncausation? Despite the apparent centrality of causation to many\nexplanations, it is arguable that completely subsuming the latter into\nthe former loses connections with some important issues. For one\nthing, causal claims themselves seem to vary greatly in the extent to\nwhich they are explanatorily deep or illuminating. Causal claims found\nin Newtonian mechanics seem deeper or more satisfying from the point\nof view of explanation than causal claims of “the rock broke the\nwindow” variety. It is usually supposed that such differences\nare connected to other features—for example to how general,\nstable, coherent with background knowledge a causal claim is. However,\nnotions like “generality” are vague and not all forms of\ngenerality seem to be connected to explanatory goodness. So even if\none focuses only on causal explanation, there remains the important\nproject of trying to understand better what sorts of distinctions\namong causal claims matter for goodness in explanation. To the extent\nthis is so, the kinds of concerns that have animated traditional\ntreatments of explanation don’t seem to be entirely subsumable\ninto standard accounts of causation, which have tended to focus\nlargely on the project of distinguishing causal from non-causal\nrelationships rather than on the features that make causal\nrelationships “good” for purposes of explanation. \nAnother important question has to do with whether there are forms of\nwhy-explanation that are non-causal. If so, how important are these\nare in science and what is their structure? Hempel seems to have\nthought of causal explanations simply as those DN explanations that\nappeal to causal laws which he regarded as a proper subset of all\nlaws. Thus on his view, causal and non-causal explanations share a\ncommon structure. Kitcher’s unificationist model was also\nintended to apply to both causal and non-causal explanations such as\nunifying argument patterns in linguistics. More recently, there has\nbeen a great upsurge of interest in whether there are non-causal forms\nof explanation, with some claiming they are ubiquitous in science\n(e.g., Lange 2017, Reutlinger & Saatsi 2018). If there are such explanations, this\nraises the issue of what distinguishes them from causal explanations\nand whether there is some overarching theory that subsumes both causal\nand non-causal explanations.  \nAs noted above, one way in which the attempt to develop a single\ngeneral model of explanation might fail is that we might conclude that\nthere are causal and non-causal forms of explanation that have little\nin common. But even putting this possibility aside, another\npossibility is that explanation differs across different areas of\nscience in a way that precludes the development of a single, general\nmodel. It is, after all, uncontroversial that explanatory\npractice—what is accepted as an explanation, how explanatory\ngoals interact with others, what sort of explanatory information is\nthought to be achievable, discoverable, testable etc.—varies in\nsignificant ways across different disciplines. Nonetheless, all of the\nmodels of explanation surveyed above are “universalist” in\naspiration—they claim that a single, “one size”\nmodel of explanation fits all areas of inquiry in so far as these have\na legitimate claim to explain. Although the extreme position that\nexplanation in biology or history has nothing interesting in common\nwith explanation in physics seems unappealing (and in any case has\nattracted little support), it seems reasonable to expect that more\neffort will be devoted in the future to developing models of\nexplanation that are more sensitive to disciplinary differences.\nIdeally, such models would reveal commonalities across disciplines but\nthey should also enable us to see why explanatory practice varies as\nit does across different disciplines and the significance of such\nvariation. For example, as noted above, biologists, in contrast to\nphysicists, often describe their explanatory goals as the discovery of\nmechanisms rather than the discovery of laws. Although it is\nconceivable that this difference is purely terminological, it is also\nworth exploring the possibility that there is a distinctive story to\nbe told about what a mechanism is, as this notion is understood by\nbiologists, and how information about mechanisms contributes to\nexplanation. \nA closely related point is that at least some of the models described\nabove impose requirements on explanation that may be satisfiable in\nsome domains of inquiry but are either unachievable (in any\npractically interesting sense) in other domains or, to the extent that\nthey may be achievable, bear no discernible relationship to generally\naccepted goals of inquiry in those domains. For example, we noted\nabove that many scientists and philosophers hold that there are few if\nany laws to be discovered in biology and the social and behavioral\nsciences. If so, models of explanation that assign a central role to\nlaws may not be very illuminating regarding how explanation works in\nthese disciplines. As another example, even if we suppose that the\npartition into objectively homogeneous reference classes recommended\nby the SR model is an achievable goal in connection with\ncertain quantum mechanical phenomena, it may be that (as suggested\nabove) it is simply not a goal that can be achieved in a non-trivial\nway in economics and sociology, disciplines in which causal inference\nfrom statistics also figures prominently. In such disciplines, it may\nbe that additional statistically relevant partitions of any population\nor subpopulation of interest will virtually always be possible, so\nthat the activity of finding such partitions is limited only by the\ncosts of gathering additional information. A similar assessment may\nhold for most applications of the CM model to the social\nsciences.","contact.mail":"rossl@uci.edu","contact.domain":"uci.edu"}]
