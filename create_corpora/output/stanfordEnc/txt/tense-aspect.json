This\nphenomenon is called tense. In English, for example, adding\nthe morpheme -ed to the verb walk, to form\nwalked, indicates that the event denoted by the verb occurred\nbefore the present time. What is called aspect, on the other\nhand, deals with the internal constituency of actions, events, states,\nprocesses or situations. For instance, it may indicate that an action\nis completed or still ongoing. English typically uses the\n-ing form of verbs to indicate ongoing processes, as in\nHe is building a house. \n\n\nAfter a short introduction to basic notions of tense and aspect we\nbriefly discuss temporal logic, and then Reichenbach’s famous\ndistinction between speech time, event time and reference\ntime. Event-based semantic theories treat events as ontological\nprimitives, so in the following section we show how time can be\nconstructed from event structures, as exemplified by the Russell-Kamp\nconstruction. These sections are followed by a discussion of the most\nimportant observations concerning lexical and grammatical aspect,\nincluding the famous imperfective paradox. Next we introduce two\nwidely discussed theories of temporality and show how they cope with\nthe imperfective paradox. This section is followed by one that shows\nhow temporal information is expressed in Artificial Intelligence\n(AI). We use the event calculus from AI to present a solution of the\nimperfective paradox, by viewing it as an instance of the frame\nproblem. The last section is devoted to gathering psycholinguistic\nevidence showing that at least some of the philosophical and semantic\nconcepts discussed in this article may be cognitively real. \n\nTense roughly means reference to the time at which events\ntake place, or at which processes or states hold. English, for\nexample, clearly distinguishes between past and non-past tense as in\n(1a) and (1b) and (1c).  \nIn English, verb forms are typically used to signal the time\nwhen an action or event occurs or a state holds. Thus in (1a), John’s\npromise was given before the present time, in (1b) the promising is\nsimultaneous with the present time and (1c) says that the student’s\nwork on his thesis will occur at some time after the present. It\nshould be noted that the verb forms used to express temporal\ninformation may also be used to signal information that is not purely\ntemporal. For instance, the present tense form in John walks\n\n\ncharacterizes a certain habit of John. And in the statement The\ntrain departs at five o’clock tomorrow, the present verb form\nclearly has a futurate meaning. So English distinguishes between past\nand non-past but not between future and non-future. Moreover, many\nlinguists exclude future as a pure tense, because the auxiliary\nwill may be used to express volition as in He will go\nswimming in dangerous\n water.[1] \nApart from absolute tense—exemplified by\n(1a)–(1c)—where the reference point from which the\nlocation in time is evaluated is the present, there is also\n\nrelative tense where the reference point is not necessarily\nthe present but may be given by context. Thus in a sentence like\nThe student had worked on his thesis the student’s work took\nplace at a time before a reference point in the past, in contrast to\n(1c) where the reference point is the present. Other instances of\nrelative tense in English are the present perfect and the future\nperfect in (2a) respectively (2b).  \nThe notion of aspect according to Comrie refers to\n“[the] different ways of viewing the internal temporal\nconstituency of a situation” (1976: 3). It is customary to\ndistinguish between lexical and grammatical aspect.\nThe following are examples concerning lexical aspect. Since Vendler\n(1967) linguists distinguish at least four aspectual classes. These\nare states like know, activities like run,\naccomplishments like cross the street and achievements\nexemplified by a verb like recognize. Accomplishments\ndescribe the internal temporal constituency of a situation in a more\ndetailed way than (say) activities. Crossing the street, for\nexample, includes the starting of a crossing activity which goes on\nfor some time and involves a result state that is characterized by\nbeing on the other side of the street. No such elaborate descriptions\nare necessary for activities or achievements. There are grammatical\nmeans of distinguishing between these aspectual classes. For example,\nstates and achievements cannot occur with the progressive while\nactivities and accomplishments can; more about this below in\n Section 5.\n\n\n These differences are customarily considered to be lexical\ndifferences and this area is therefore dubbed lexical aspect.\n \nA further crucial aspectual difference is that between perfective and\nimperfective aspect. Comrie characterizes these notions as follows.\n \n…perfectivity indicates the view of the situation as a single\nwhole, without distinction of the various separate phases that make up\nthat situation, while the imperfective pays essential attention to the\ninternal structure of the situation. (Comrie 1976: 16)  \nIn English this difference is often expressed by grammatical\nmeans, for instance by past tense versus past progressive. This is an\ninstance of grammatical aspect. Slavic language often have an\nelaborate grammatical system to signal the difference between\nimperfectivity (ipv) and perfectivity (pv). Here is an example from Russian.  \nSentence (3b) presents the writing of a letter as a single whole and\nit is clear that this activity was finished when the letter was brought to the\npost office. By contrast, (3a) focuses on an ongoing activity of\nletter writing in the past which is not completed because of the\ninterruption. In fact it is consistent with the truth of (3a) that the\nletter was never completely written.  \nThe natural language categories tense and aspect\n\n\nembody the linguistic encoding of time. From a typological point of\nview these categories are typical verbal\n categories.[2]\n This means that if these categories are morphologically realized in a\nlanguage then these morphemes attach to the verb. Verbs usually\nexpress events, processes, actions or\n states[3]\n and the temporal morphemes locate these eventualities in time. Of\ncourse this does not mean that languages that lack such morphemes are\nnot able to express temporal relations. They just have to choose other\nmeans for this purpose. One famous example of a language not\ncontaining temporal morphology is Mandarin Chinese. Often tense and\naspect cannot be clearly separated. For example the Quiché\nprefix \\(x-\\) denotes a completed (aspect) action in the past\n (tense).[4] \nTypologists also observed an asymmetry between past and future. Most\nlanguages that possess temporal morphology use these means to\ndifferentiate between past and non-past. There are, however, a few\nlanguages which use temporal morphology to distinguish between future\nand non-future.  \nWe will not go into further details concerning the linguistic\nrealization of tense and aspect, but present a brief and necessarily\nincomplete review of major philosophical and semantic theories of\nthese notions.  \nTemporal logic was introduced by Arthur Prior (see for instance Prior\n1967). Here we will sketch only propositional temporal logic (for a\nmore thorough introduction the reader is advised to consult Gamut\n1991: chapters 2 and 3) and the entry on\n temporal logic.\n\n\n Temporal logic introduces operators \\(\\bG\\), \\(\\bH\\), \\(\\bF\\) and\n\\(\\bP\\), which are similar to the modal operators \\(\\Box\\) and \\(\\Diamond\\).\nWe summarize the intuitive meaning of these operators in Table 1.  \nBy adding the above operators to propositional logic we extend\npropositional logic to propositional temporal logic. Let \\(q\\)\nabbreviate the sentence Sam is working, then we are able to\nexpress the following verb tenses in temporal logic:  \nA model \\(\\sM\\) for propositional temporal logic consists of a\nnonempty set \\(T\\) of moments of time, an earlier than relation\n\\(\\prec\\) and a valuation function \\(I\\) which for each moment of\ntime and each proposition letter \\(q\\) assigns a truth value\n\\(I_{\\sM ,t}(q)\\). The following\ndefinition characterizes \\(I_{\\sM ,t}(\\phi)\\)\nfor the temporal operators.  \nThese clauses are analogous to the clauses which define the modal\noperators \\(\\Box\\) and \\(\\Diamond\\)—with \\(\\bG\\) and \\(\\bH\\)\ncorresponding to \\(\\Box\\), and \\(\\bF\\) and \\(\\bP\\) to \\(\\Diamond\\)—but\ninstead of possible worlds the valuation function takes moments of\ntime as arguments. Therefore principle (5) is valid in any model,\nsince the modal analogue is valid for \\(\\Box\\) independently of the\naccessibility relation.  \nHowever, principle (6), which is often considered as valid for\n\\(\\Box\\), is presumably not valid for \\(\\bG\\).  \nFormula (6) is equivalent to \\(\\phi \\rightarrow \\bF\\phi\\). The latter\nformula says that if \\(\\phi\\) is the case then \\(\\phi\\) will be the case,\nwhich is intuitively incorrect. Suppose that \\(\\prec\\) is irreflexive;\nthis assumption makes sense since it means that no time point is\nearlier than itself. But under this assumption, Principle (6) is\nobviously wrong. For extensions of temporal logic and more examples\nconcerning the correspondence between properties of models and the\nvalidity or invalidity of formulas see Gamut 1991: chapter 2. \nThis concludes our brief remarks about temporal logic. We now turn to\nan alternative approach due to the philosopher Hans Reichenbach.  \nThe notions speech time, event time, and\n\nreference time were introduced by Reichenbach (1947) in order\nto distinguish simple past and present perfect or, more generally,\nabsolute and relative tense. According to Comrie (1985), who refined\nReichenbach’s system (in Chapter 6 of his book on tense) speech time\nand event time are sufficient for the analysis of absolute\ntime; i.e., present, (simple) past and future. But for\nrelative tense—of which the present perfect is but one\nexample—reference time is required. Let us explain these notions\nby applying them to distinguish between past and present perfect.  \nConsider the following examples from Steedman (1997).  \nIt has often been observed that the present perfect in English has\npresent relevance. For instance the continuation of (7a) with but\nI have found it again is infelicitous in English; the German\ntranslation of this sequence is acceptable, showing that the German\nperfect is more like a past tense (but see Kamp et al. 2015 for an\nextensive discussion, in Other Internet Resources). The same\ncontinuation is fine for sentence (7b). In this sense the perfect is a\nrelative tense and the past an absolute tense in English. Let \\(E\\)\nbe short for event time and let \\(S, R\\) stand for speech\ntime and reference time respectively.  \nFor the simple past, both event time and reference time are situated\non the time line before speech time. In case of the perfect, R and S\nare simultaneous and E is earlier than both R and S. Intuitively,\nreference time represents the perspective from which an eventuality is\nperceived on the time line. This is not a purely semantic theory of\ntense like temporal logic, rather it is a pragmatic theory of tense.\nIn particular, reference time (in contrast to event time) has to be\nmutually known by communication partners. When using the present\nperfect, reference time is known since it coincides with speech time.\nHowever, reference time is not necessarily known when the past tense\nis used, since it is just required to be earlier than speech time and\nto coincide with event time. This may explain why sentences in the\npast sound strange when uttered out of the blue. Steedman (1997)\npresents the following examples:  \nThe past-tensed sentence (8a) uttered out of the blue is infelicitous,\nwhile sentence (8b) is fine, since in this case the\nwhen-clause introduces the reference time. \nThis is by no means the complete story of the perfect. For example,\nComrie (1976) distinguishes four typical uses of the perfect: the\nperfect of result, the experiential perfect, the perfect of persistent\nsituation and the perfect of recent past. For an extensive recent\ndiscussion the reader is advised to consult Kamp et al. 2015 (in Other\nInternet Resources).  \n\n\nThe following table summarizes the positions of event time, reference\ntime and speech time for other tenses:  \nComrie (1985) and Gamut (1991) point out that this cannot be a\ncomplete account for temporal constructions that occur in natural\nlanguages. For instance the temporal profile of the sentence Sam\nwould have worked cannot be analyzed by using a single reference\ntime. This is one reason for the extended requirements for a formal\ntheory of tense proposed by Comrie (1985: chapter 6). Furthermore, \nBlackburn and Jørgensen (2016) combine the key insights of Prior \nand Reichenbach in the framework of hybrid tense logic suggesting that \nthe two approaches are fully compatible with each other. In event semantics following Davidson (1967) events are commonly\ntaken as ontological primitives. This raises the philosophical\nquestion how events and times relate to each other. A construction,\ndue to Russell, Wiener and Kamp, shows that the time line can be\nconstructed from events. We will briefly sketch this construction\nbefore we move on to lexical and grammatical aspect. Russell remarked: \n\nEven if there be a physical world such as the mathematical theory of\nmotion presupposes, impressions on our sense-organs produce sensations\nwhich are not merely and strictly instantaneous, and therefore the\nobjects of sense of which we are immediately conscious are not\nstrictly instantaneous. Instants, therefore, are not among the data of\nexperience and must be either inferred or constructed. It is difficult\nto see how they can be validly inferred; thus we are left with the\nalternative that they must be constructed. (Russell 1914: lecture\nIV) Kamp (1979)\ntook up Russell’s ideas and slightly modified them. The construction\ntakes event structures as primitives from which the structure of time,\ni.e., a total order, can be derived.  \nAn event structure \\(\\langle E, P, O\\rangle\\) simply\nconsists of a set of events \\(E\\) and the relations \\(P\\)\n(precedes) and \\(O\\) (overlaps) and is\ncharacterized by axioms A1–7.  \nGiven an event structure satisfying these axioms, the set of instants\nand their strict linear ordering can be constructed according to\ndefinition 2. The idea is to identify an instant with the maximal set\nof pairwise overlapping events. Instants are thus conceived of as\nabstractions over events that happen (or go on) simultaneously. Events\nlinked by the precedence relation will give rise to distinct instants.\n \n\nWe will first illustrate the Russell-Kamp construction by way of an\nexample and then show that \\(\\langle I,\\lt \\rangle\\) has the\nproperties specified in Theorem 1: it is a strict linear ordering\nwhich gives rise to an interval structure.  \nExample 1.  Let \\(E = \\{a, b, c, d, e\\}\\) and \\(P\\) be the\nset of ordered pairs \\(\\{(a, c), (a, d), (a, e), (b, e), (c,\ne)\\}\\). Given A7, the relation \\(O\\) consists of the set of pairs\n\\(\\{(a, b), (b, c), (b, d), (c, d), (d, e)\\}\\).  \\(E\\) contains three\nmaximal subsets of pairwise overlapping events, that is, instants\n\\(i_1 = \\{a, b\\}\\), \\(i_2 = \\{b, c, d\\}\\) and \\(i_3 = \\{d,\ne\\}\\). Furthermore, \\(i_1\\), \\(i_2\\) and \\(i_3\\) are linearly ordered\nas \\(i_1 \\lt i_2 \\lt i_3\\) because \\(a \\in i_1\\), \\(c \\in i_2\\) and\n\\(P(a, c)\\) hence \\(i_1 \\lt i_2\\), and \\(c \\in i_2\\), \\(e \\in i_3\\)\nand \\(P(c, e)\\) hence \\(i_2 \\lt i_3\\), and similarly for \\(i_1 \\lt\ni_3.\\) \n \nA proof of the following theorem can be found in (Kamp 1979: 379).\n \nOnce having constructed the set \\(I\\) it is possible to define time\nintervals and these, in turn, can be used to measure the temporal\nextent of an event. In Example 1, for example, \\(a\\) goes\non in the interval [\\(i_1], b\\) in\n[\\(i_1, i_2], c\\) in\n[\\(i_2], d\\) in [\\(i_2,\ni_3\\)] and \\(e\\) in [\\(i_3\\)].\nCorollary 1 guarantees that these intervals can be constructed (Kamp\n1979: 379).  Corollary 1. For each \\(e \\in E\\), the set \\(e' =\\{i \\in I\n\\mid e \\in i\\}\\) is a non-empty interval of \\(\\langle I,\\lt\n\\rangle.\\) \nProof: If \\(i_1, i_2 \\in e'\\) and \\(i_1 \\lt i \\lt i_2\\), it has to be\nshown that \\(e \\in i\\), too. Suppose it is not.  Then there is \\(d \\in\ni\\) such that \\(\\neg O(d, e)\\), hence \\(P(d, e)\\) or \\(P(e, d)\\). In\nthe first case \\(i \\lt i_1\\) and in the second case \\(i_2 \\lt\ni\\). Both yield a contradiction.\\(\\Box\\)  \nWe cannot give further details here, but refer the interested reader\nto Thomason (1986) who discusses how to construct time as a\ncontinuum—isomorphic to the real numbers—and uses a\ndifferent construction originally proposed by Walker (1947). Empirical\nevidence for events being ontological primitives will be presented in\n section 8\nwhere we review psychological studies on event perception. We will now\nmove to lexical and grammatical aspect, that is the expression of event\ntypes and how a given event is conceptualized, which form basic\nconcepts in linguistic theory. \nLinguists distinguish four or five lexical aspectual classes or\nAktionsarten. The following four were introduced by the\nphilosopher Zeno Vendler (1967: chapter four) on the basis of earlier\nwork by philosophers such as Kenny, Ryle and Aristotle (see also the\n entry on events). For a formal\ndefinition of Aktionsart the reader is referred to van\nLambalgen and Hamm (2005: 85 ff).  \nIn addition, linguists often assume that verbs like flash,\nspot and blink form an extra class—the class\nof semelfactives or points (see Smith 1991).  \nA useful notion for distinguishing Aktionarten is the\nevent nucleus introduced by Moens and Steedman (1988). The\nevent nucleus is constructed from a preparatory phase, a culminating\nevent and a consequent phase. Activities only refer to the preparatory\nphase, states only to the consequent phase, achievements to the\nculminating event and to the consequent phase and finally\naccomplishments to all three parts of the event nucleus.  \n\nVendler proposed several linguistic tests for distinguishing these\nverb classes. We will present only the most important ones here; for a\nmuch more comprehensive list the reader is referred to Dowty (1979: 60).\nThe first test separates non-statives from statives. Only non-statives\noccur in the progressive.  \nAccomplishment verbs prefer \\(in\\)-adverbials as temporal\nmodifiers, whereas activity verbs allow only\nfor-adverbials. \nAchievement verbs are usually infelicitous with\n\nfor-adverbials but allow the combination with\n\\(in\\)-adverbials.  \nThe last test we mention here concerns the different entailment\npatterns of activities and accomplishments in the progressive.\nActivities in the past progressive entail their past reading but\naccomplishments in the past progressive don’t.  \nThis is an instance of the famous imperfective paradox. Of course,\ntaken literally this is not a paradox. Nevertheless the entailment\npatterns (12) and (13) pose a significant problem for any formal\ntheory of tense and aspect. For instance, the first formal proposal\nfor truth conditions of sentences in the past progressive stated that\na sentence S in the past progressive is true if and only if there\nexists an open interval before the speech time at which the sentence\nwithout the progressive is true. According to definition 1.4 this\nimmediately validates pattern (12) but without qualifications this\ntruth definition does not account for pattern (13). Sections\n 6\n and\n 7\ncontain extensive discussion of the imperfective paradox.  \nVendler thought of the Aktionarten as lexical properties of\nverbs. That this position is dubious was pointed out by many\nlinguists, in particular by Dowty (1979) and Verkuyl (1993). For a\nsimple case, consider the verb drink. If we assume that being\nan activity is a lexical property of this verb, then surely by\ncombining it with the noun wine this property is preserved\nfor the complex phrase drink wine. However, if we combine the\nverb drink with the noun phrase a bottle of wine we\nturn an activity into an accomplishment. The converse problem arises\nif we assume that being an accomplishment is a lexical property of\n\ndrink. This phenomenon of aspectual reinterpretation was\ndubbed coercion in Moens and Steedman (1988). In\n Section 6.1 \nwe will sketch a systematic solution for these types of coercion\n in mereological semantics (Krifka 1989, 1992).  \nAktionsart is not even definitely fixed at the VP-level. The\nverb arrive in  \nis an achievement, as demonstrated by the ungrammaticality of (14-b).\nBut if we choose a bare plural as subject it is turned into an\nactivity and sentence (15) is grammatical.  \nTherefore a final decision about aspectual class cannot be reached\nbelow the sentence level. Steedman’s famous sentence (16)  \nshows that coercion can be iterated and that aspectual class can\nswitch back and forth in this iteration process. We close this section\nwith two further examples of aspectual coercion. In the first one a\nstative verb is transformed into an activity. \nThe verb resemble is a stative verb and therefore (17a) is\nunacceptable but (17b) is fine.  \nHowever, if we add more and more every day to (17a) thus\nforming  \n\nwe get an acceptable result. This is due to the phrase more and\nmore every day which coerces a state into an activity. Our last\nexample is about temporal modification with for-adverbials.\nAs pointed out above accomplishments are usually rather bad with\nfor-adverbials. They require \\(in\\)-adverbials. But\nconsider sentence (19) from van Lambalgen and Hamm (2005).  \nThis sentence seems to be fine. However it is not interpreted as an\naccomplishment any more but is reinterpreted as an iterated activity.\nTo get this reading, a lot of non-linguistic knowledge is required.\nFirst, one has to guess that Opus 111 refers to Beethoven’s last piano\nsonata and moreover one has to be aware that this piece lasts about 25\nminutes. Under these assumptions, sentence (19) says that Pollini\nplayed Opus 111 repeatedly within a time span of two weeks. Formal\naccounts of coercion phenomena are contained in Egg (2005), van\nLambalgen and Hamm (2005) and Steedman (1997) among others. The reader\nis also advised to consult Steedman’s updated manuscript, The\nProductions of Time (see the Other Internet Resources).\nProcessing studies of coercion are reviewed in Bott (2010); see also\n Section 8.\n\n  \n\nThe most influential approach to solving the imperfective paradox is\ndue to Dowty (1979). The basic idea is to treat the progressive as a\nmodal operator \\((\\Box)\\) but restrict its domain to inertia worlds.\nThe notion of an inertia world is characterized informally.\nAn inertia world is exactly like the real world up to the time of\nevaluation; after this it may differ from the real world but is\nassumed to be as similar to the real world as possible. Given this\nnotion, the following definition introduces truth conditions for\nsentences in the progressive.  Definition 3.  PROG\\((\\phi)\\) is true with\nrespect to interval \\(I\\) and world \\(w\\) if and only if \\(\\forall w'\n\\in IE(w)\\) there exists an interval \\(I' \\supseteq I\\) such that\n\\(\\phi\\) is true with respect to \\(I'\\) and \\(w'\\). In addition \\(I\\)\nshould not be the final subinterval of \\(I'\\). \\(IE(w)\\) is the set of\ninertia worlds for \\(w\\). \nDefinition 3 does not yet account for the different entailment\npatterns of activities and accomplishments. Two additional assumptions\nare required. The first concerns activities; the second,\naccomplishments.  \nAccomplishments like Mary draw a circle are split up into two\nparts, an activity part Mary draw that satisfies principle\n(20) and a result part which is characterized by the existence of a\ncircle. Both parts are connected by a causality relation\n\nCAUSE.  \nThus an accomplishment has a richer internal structure than an\nactivity.  \nWith these additional requirements, the inference patterns for\nactivities and accomplishments follow. Let us first show that Mary\nwas pushing a cart implies Mary pushed a cart. Assume\nthat the first sentence is true in \\(w\\) with respect to speech time\n\\(S\\). Then Mary be pushing a cart is true in \\(w\\) with\nrespect to an interval \\(I\\) before \\(S\\).  According to Definition 3,\nMary push a cart is then true in every inertia world \\(w' \\in\nIE(w)\\) with respect to an interval \\(I' \\supseteq I\\). Because of\npostulate (20), Mary push a cart is true in every \\(w' \\in\nIE(w)\\) with respect to interval \\(I \\ (I\\) is a subinterval of\n\\(I')\\). Now, the definition of inertia worlds implies that\n\nMary push a cart is true in \\(w\\) with respect to interval\n\\(I\\). This means that Mary pushed a cart is true in\n\\(w\\) with respect to speech time \\(S\\).  \nA completely analogous argument shows that Mary was drawing a\ncircle implies Mary drew. But postulate (20) only holds\nfor the first part of accomplishments; the result part is only\nrequired to hold in every inertia world \\(w'\\) with respect\nto a larger interval \\(I'\\), normally one after speech time.\nSince the inertia worlds after \\(S\\) may differ from \\(w\\) and\nsince the subinterval property (20) is not required to hold for the\nresult parts of accomplishments, the stronger conclusion that Mary\ndrew a circle does not follow.  \nMany researchers assume that inertia worlds introduce a notion of\nnormality for the semantic analysis of the progressive. The\nthunderbolt in example (22) from Landman (1992) seems to break the\nnormal development of the real world. Dowty’s analysis seems to be\ntailored for cases like this one.  \n\nHowever, objections have been raised to the normality interpretation\nof inertia. The first one is attributed to Frank Vlach in Ogihara\n(1990). Consider sentence (23)  \nand a situation in which the truck is only a few centimeters away from\nJohn. Moreover the truck’s speed is such that it is impossible for it\nto stop before hitting John. In this situation, the normal course of\nevents is such that John will never reach the other side of the\nstreet. Therefore, given definition 3, sentence (23) should be false\nunder these circumstances. This is intuitively incorrect. A similar\nobjection was raised by Bonomi (1997). \nOn the other hand, the normality interpretation seems to be at least\nquestionable. Consider the following example from Naumann and\nPiñón (1997).  \nThis does presumably not mean that when you are running across a\nminefield, you normally will eventually get to the other side. \nNote that these objections all make use of a particular informal\ninterpretation of the notion inertia. Judging the validity of\nthese objections to Dowty’s theory in a precise way therefore requires\nan explicit theory of this notion with exact empirical predictions.\n \nDowty analyzes the progressive as an intensional construction. Does\nthe progressive satisfy the standard philosophical tests for\nintensional constructions, that is, the invalidity of substitution of\nco-designative proper names and the impossibility of pulling the\nexistential quantifier out of the context created by the intensional\nconstruction (see Bealer and Mönnich (1989) for a more detailed\ndiscussion)? Let us consider accomplishments, for example sentence\n(25).  \nGiven that Ruth Rendel and Barbara Vine are co-designative proper\nnames, sentence (25) implies that Jackson Pollock was painting\nBarbara Vine. Therefore the first test fails. Co-designative\nproper names are substitutable salva veritate in progressive\nconstructions. The second one, however, applies, since  \ndoes not imply that there is a house that Carlos was building. These\ntests therefore don’t provide a clear answer to the question whether\nthe progressive is an intensional construction. Even if the answer is\nyes, the progressive is certainly a different type of intensional\nconstruction than, for example, propositional attitudes like\nbelieve or doubt.  \nAn extensional alternative was developed by Parsons (1989, 1990).\nParsons, like Davidson (1967), assumes that first-order quantification\nover events is possible. But unlike Davidson, Parsons assumes\nquantification over eventualities in the sense of Bach (1986), which\nincludes events proper but also states, processes and so on. Like\nDowty, Parsons supposes that eventualities are split up into a\ndevelopment phase and a culmination phase. In order to represent this\ndifference in first-order logic two new predicates are introduced,\nCul\\((e, t)\\) and Hold\\((e,\nt)\\). The intuitive meaning of the first is that eventuality\n\\(e\\) culminates at time \\(t\\). The second one says that\n\\(e\\) is either an eventuality in its development phase or that\n\\(e\\) is a state. Given these assumptions a sentence like Mary\ndrew a circle is translated into first-order formula (27),\n\\(S\\) is again short for speech time.  \nThe semantic effect of the progressive consists in transforming events\ninto states.  \nIf ‘\\(A\\)’ is an event verb, then ‘be\n\\(A\\)-ing’ is to be treated semantically as a state verb;\notherwise, ‘be \\(A\\)-ing’ is to be treated the same as\n‘\\(A\\)’. (Parsons 1989: 222)  \nWith this assumption the logical representation of Mary was\ndrawing a circle is (28).  \nObviously (27) does not follow from (28). But (28) does imply that\nthere is a circle Mary was drawing. Of course this circle may not be\ncomplete. This means that Parson’s ontology is bound to include\nincomplete objects. For a discussion of incomplete objects see for\ninstance Baggio and van Lambalgen (2007). \nAccording to the quotation above, the progressive doesn’t change\nanything in the case of activities. Therefore Mary pushed a\ncart and Mary was pushing a cart are predicted to be\nequivalent.  \nParsons’ theory rests on the difference between the predicates\n\nCul and Hold. This difference is left to intuition.\nNo axiomatisation of these predicates is given. This is one of the\nobjections made in Zucchi (1999). Zucchi also notes that under certain\ncircumstances it is possible to derive a specific version of the\nimperfective paradox in Parsons’ theory. A careful discussion of\nDowty’ and Parsons’ approaches and a combination of the two systems is\ncontained in Landman (1992). Another approach to the imperfective paradox and - more generally -\nnon-culminating accomplishments was proposed by Copley and Harley\n(2015). They abandon event semantics and propose instead a framework\nusing situations and forces as primitives. Forces lead to transitions\nbetween situations. Their theory is motivated by the observation that\nacross languages, non-culminating accomplishments are\ncrosslinguistically in fact a very common phenomenon. Interestingly,\nthese non-culminating readings are per default conveyed by less complex\nexpressions than complete events. Often, it is the perfective and not\nthe imperfective that is marked linguistically. Prima facie, this is a\nproblem for analyses such as Dowty's which assume that the imperfective\nparadox in accomplishments hinges on an additional operator such as\nPROG. This is where Copley and Harley's causal analysis comes into\nplay. Their force-theoretic account does not run into this problem\nbecause causally efficacious forces always take effects ceteris\nparibus, for instance, an effect may not occur do to the occurence of a\ncounter force preventing the effect. They develop a compositional\nsemantic framework linking forces to the argument structure of the\nsentence. At the present stage of the theory, however, some of the\nbasic concepts also call for axiomatisation. For instance, it is\ncrucial to gain a proper understanding of what it means for a situation\nto be a ceteribus paribus successor situation for some initial\nsituation. For this purpose, their semantic framework must be connected\nto a theory of causality connecting linguistic meaning to cognition and\ncausal reasoning via a conceptual level integrating the two. We will come back to the imperfective\nparadox in\n Section 7\n where we combine linguistic theory with event theories from artificial\n intelligence. This will give us a formalization of\n ceteris paribus from which a\n new solution to the imperfective paradox will follow. Let us now show that events are also useful for a systematic\naccount of certain types of coercion that were mentioned\nabove in Section 5. Intuitively\nthere is a close link between the nominal predicates wine and a bottle\nof wine and their verbal counterparts (29-a), (29-b).  \nWhenever there are two entities to which wine applies, this\npredicate applies to their collection as well. The predicate a\nbottle of wine does not have this property. Whenever there are\ntwo different entities to which a bottle of wine applies,\nthis predicate does not apply to their collection. The first predicate\nis cumulative (see Definition 4) the second is\nquantized (see Definition 5). A similar argumentation applies\nto the difference between the activity drink wine and the\naccomplishment drink a bottle of wine. It was observed by\nmany linguists that the combination of a verb like drink with\na cumulative predicate like wine yields an atelic predicate\nlike (29-a), whereas its combination with a quantized predicate yields\na telic predicate like in (29-b). \nIn order to account for these intuitions in a precise way Krifka assumes\nthat the parts of the structure \\(\\mathcal{M} = (\\mathfrak{O},\n\\mathfrak{E}, \\mathfrak{T})\\) consisting of objects \\(\\mathfrak{O}\\),\nevents \\(\\mathfrak{E}\\) and times \\(\\mathfrak{T}\\) are each structured\nas complete join semi-lattices without a bottom element (see Grätzer,\n1978). This means that we have a two place relation \\(\\sqcup\\) (join)\nand relations \\(\\sqsubseteq\\), \\(\\sqsubset\\), and \\(\\bigcirc\\) (part,\nproper part and overlap) that impose part-whole relations (mereologies,\nsee the entry mereology)\non the sets of objects, events and times. We cannot list all the\nproperties that must hold for these structures to serve as admissible\ninterpretations of natural language but we illustrate these properties\nby giving two examples. Definition 4. Cumulative (CUM) reference:  \n\\(\\forall P (CUM(P) \\leftrightarrow \\forall x, y(P(x) \\wedge P(y) \\rightarrow P(x \\sqcup y)))\\). Definition 5. Quantized (QUA) reference:  \n\\(\\forall P(QUA(P) \\leftrightarrow \\forall x, y (P(x) \\wedge P(y) \\rightarrow \\neg y \\sqsubset x))\\). \nDefinitions 4 and 5 now allow for a formal descripion of the\nreferential difference between wine and a bottle of\nwine. For verbal predicates Krifka assumes that they are event denoting\nand moreover that thematic relations\nlike agent, theme, etc are represented as in\n(31-b). Thematic roles of verbs are crucial since they determine which\nverbs give raise to the drink wine versus drink a bottle\nof wine\n distinction.[5] It\nis now straightforward to fix the reference of the verbal predicates in\na way that exhibits their simlarity to the respective nominal\npredicates. \nCumulativity of nominal predicates corresponds to atelicity in the\nverbal domain and a quantized nominal predicate corresponds to a telic\nverbal predicate. \nThere is still something missing. How can the impact of the reference\nof the nominal predicates on the aspectual class be derived formally?\nWe will present only the basic idea of Krifka's construction here. Let\n\\(w\\) be the predicate corresponding to wine and let \\(e\\) be the event predicate representing drink wine. The basic idea is that an object is changed by the influence of  such an event in a gradual\nmanner. Since we know that \\(w\\) is cumulative this predicate also\napplies to proper parts of \\(w\\), say \\(w'\\). Then given that drink  wine\ncan be applied to \\(e\\) it should also be possible to apply it to a\nproper part of \\(e\\), say \\(e'\\). Quantized predicates show a different\nbehaviour. Since a bottle of wine is quantized no proper part of it  is a bottle of wine  and therefore no proper part of \\(e\\) can be described as drink a bottle of wine.\nTo account for this intuitive explanation in formal terms it is\nnecessary to specify certain preservation properties for thematic roles\nsince these roles relate the algebraic structure of events and the\nalgebraic structure of objects. This means that notions like summativity, uniqueness of objects etc. have to be defined for relations between events and objects; i.e. thematic roles. \nHere we will illustrate these concepts with only one example, summativity (SUM). Definition 6. \n\\(\\forall R [SUM(R) \\leftrightarrow \\forall e, e', x, x'[R(e, x)\n\\wedge R(e', x') \\rightarrow R(e\\sqcup e', x \\sqcup\nx')]]\\). \nSummativity says that the sum-operation \\(\\sqcup\\) on\nevents and objects is preserved under summative relations on events and\nobjects. For instance if we have two distinct events of drinking a bottle of wine we get an event of drinking two bottles of wine. \nWith this formal background it is now possible to state exactly when a\npredicate of events corresponding to a verb-phrase is cumulative, telic\netc.. Again we will just state one result. Let \\(\\phi = \\{ e|\\exists\nx(\\alpha(e) \\wedge \\delta(x) \\wedge \\theta(e, x))\\}\\) be such a\npredicate where \\(\\alpha\\) represents a verb - say draw - \\(\\delta\\) the nominal predicate - pictures - and \\(\\theta\\) a thematic relation - say theme.\nIt then follows that one set of conditions for \\(\\phi\\) being\ncumulative is that \\(\\delta\\) is cumulative and \\(\\theta\\) is\nsummative. An example is the verb phrase draw pictures. Similar results  characterize, iterative, telic, atelic etc. readings. \nThis concludes our glimpse of events in linguistic semantics; Readers interested in a more comprehensive treatment of this issue may find Champollion (2014, see Other Internet Resources) a useful contemporary source. We now come back to the imperfective paradox and turn to an\nevent calculus that was developed in artificial intelligence. \nIn the following section we will show that the imperfective paradox is\nan instance of the frame problem prominent in Artificial Intelligence\n(AI). To this end we will explain the event calculus, which is an\nextension of McCarthy’s situation calculus (McCarthy 1977) developed\nby Kowalski and Sergot (1986). Then we will indicate how the event\ncalculus leads to a formalization of natural language tense and aspect\nby analysing the imperfective paradox.  \nConsider narrative (33).  \nAssuming that shooting at somebody with a loaded gun will lead to the\ndeath of that person, we will interpret the discourse in a way that\nFred eventually gets killed. Arriving at this inference is, however,\nnot a trivial task. In (33) the frame problem is exemplified in the\nform of the Yale Shooting Scenario (Hanks and McDermott 1986). To\ndemonstrate this, we will start with a very simple calculus—a\nvariant of the Simple Event Calculus by Shanahan (1997) which\nonly incorporates a very basic notion of instantaneous change. Later\nwe will add axioms in order to deal with continuous change and then\nreturn to the imperfective paradox. In short, we will argue that the\nparadox can be viewed as an instance of the frame problem.  \nSuppose we have three kinds of actions/events—Load,\nSmoke and Shoot—and three time dependent\nproperties, the fluents Alive, Loaded and\n Dead.[6]\n Besides actions and fluents we will also need instants of time in our\nbasic ontology. The predicates listed in Table 4 are used to express\nactions and their effects and to locate them in time.  Table 4.\nPredicates of the simple event calculus (from Shanahan 1999) \nThe predicates are related to each other by a set of four simple\naxioms (34)–(37). In these axioms, all variables are assumed to be universally\nquantified with maximal scope. We will come to the semantics of the\nimplication when we have introduced the complete scenario.  \n The first three axioms state the conditions\nunder which a fluent can hold at a time \\(t\\): either it holds\nright from the start or it is initiated at a time \\(t_1\\)\nbefore \\(t\\) without a terminating action occurring in between the\ntwo. The fourth axiom defines the predicate Clipped\\((t_1,\nf,\nt_2)\\) saying that a fluent \\(f\\) is clipped\nbetween times \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\) if it is\nterminated by some action \\(a\\) happening between\n\\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\). Simplifying a whole\nlot, the axioms (30)–(33) formalize the notion of instantaneous\nchange, such as two balls colliding or somebody dying. Moreover, they\nembody a notion of inertia: fluents continue to hold unless\nterminated.\n\n \n\nNext, we have to translate the discourse (33) into the Simple Event\nCalculus. The first set of formulas (38)–(40) states what the\nmentioned actions do. These formulas provide a crude sketch of the\nlexical meaning of load, smoke and shoot.\nThe effect of a Load action is to make the fluent\nLoaded hold, a Shoot action makes Dead hold\n(and Alive not hold) with Loaded being a\nprecondition. Finally, Smoke is assumed to have no effects\n(thus, there are no rules involving Smoke).  \n(33) comprises a Load action followed by a Smoke\naction followed by a Shoot action. Using four arbitrarily\nchosen time points \\(T_1\\)–\\(T_4\\) the\ndiscourse can be represented as follows:  \n\nFrom this little theory we want to derive\nHoldsAt(Dead, \\(T_4)\\). Unfortunately,\nthis sequent is not valid in the classical sense of being true in all\nmodels which satisfy the theory. Think for example of a situation in\nwhich the gun obscurely becomes unloaded while Vincent is smoking. In\nsuch a model, the precondition of the shooting action is clearly not\nmet and thus the action will lack any effects. Note that nothing rules\nout such a model since it is entirely consistent with our theory. We\nthus have to further constrain the models under consideration.\nCrucially, we have to find a way to deal with the non-effects of\nactions; this is the famous frame problem.  \nHow to proceed? From the fact that no terminating action was\nmentioned, we want to conclude that no terminating event occurred. To\ndo so, we have to strengthen the assumptions of the theory in a way\nthat only those events are assumed to occur which have been explicitly\nstated in the discourse. The discourse model should be minimal,\nlinking discourse understanding intimately to closed world\nreasoning. It is important to note that this strategy forces\nreasoning to be non-monotonic: adding further premises to a theory can\nmake inferences invalid that were valid before (see the entry on \nnon-monotonic logic).  \nThere are different techniques for formalizing this line of reasoning;\none is circumscription (e.g., Shanahan 1997). Here, we will use the\ncompletion of a logic program technique, adopting the\n\nEvent Calculus of van Lambalgen and Hamm (2005). Taking a\ncloser look at the formulas of the theory\n\\(((34) \\wedge \\ldots \\wedge (45))\\), an important feature to notice is that\nformulas come in two variants: they are either facts\nconsisting of a simple predicate expression or they express\nrules with a conjunction of potentially negated formulas to\nthe left of the implication sign and a single positive atomic\nexpression to its right (in logic programming the former is called the\n\nbody and the latter is called the head of a clause).\nWe will now illustrate how the completion of a simple logic program is\ncomputed. Consider the description of a situation where the gun gets\nloaded at time 1 and a shooting event happens at time 10. This\nsituation is stated in the following program:  \nThe uncompleted program does not yet rule out intervening events. It\nis, for example, consistent with an Unload event occurring at\ntime instant 9. The completion of the program should tell us that (46)\nand (47) were the only events. The completion is computed according to\nthe following\n procedure.[7]\n We start with the facts in (46) and (47). Both of these are\nHappens formulae. The completion of the program intuitively\ncorresponds to an assertion that, given this program,\nHappens\\((e, t)\\) can only mean Load\noccurring at 1 or Shoot occurring at 10. We therefore first\nsubstitute variables for the constants and write the following\ndisjunction:  \nThen, we universally quantify over the variables \\(e\\) and \\(t\\)\nand strengthen the implication to a bi-implication:  \nFrom (49) it follows that there were no intervening events.\nStrengthening the implications to bi-implications makes it impossible\nthat a head can be true without the enabling conditions being\n met.[8]\n The uniquely determined model of (49) is the minimal model of the\nlogic program consisting of (46) and (47).  \nWe can now come back to the Yale Shooting Problem in discourse (33).\nFrom the completion of the logic program\n((34))\\(\\wedge \\ldots \\wedge\\)((45)) it follows (non-monotonically) that\nHoldsAt(Dead, \\(T_4)\\). Enriching the\nprogram with further information and computing the new completion,\nhowever, could clearly lead to cancellation of this inference.  \nIf we want to use these ideas to model natural language discourse, we\nneed to incorporate tense. In van Lambalgen and Hamm (2005) this is\ndone by adopting the classic tripartition into reference\ntime, event time and speech time due to\nReichenbach (see\n section 3).\n  \nRecall that above, when we translated discourse (33) into Shanahan’s\nEvent Calculus, we arbitrarily chose instants of time\n\\(T_1 ,\\ldots ,T_4\\) to locate actions\nin time. This is not how it is done in natural language discourse. The\nfirst sentence (Yesterday morning Vincent loaded the gun)\nstates that within some time interval \\((=\\) reference time) before now \\((=\\)\nspeech time) there was a time \\(t'\\) at which a loading event\nhappened \\((=\\) event time). The second sentence (Then he smoked a\ncigarette) is linked to this event by the connective\nthen, stating that at some later time \\(t''\\) a\nsmoking event happened with \\(t''\\) also being temporally\nlocated before now. Analogously for the third sentence: there\nis an event time \\(t'''\\) at which Shoot happens and\n\\(t'' \\lt t''' \\lt\\)\nnow. Note that when locating events in time it is\nalways done by existential statements of the form there is a\ntime. So far, however, we have only been dealing with universally\nquantified variables. Clearly, a formula like \\(\\forall t\\).Happens(Load,\n\\(t)\n\\wedge t \\lt\\) now cannot be used to represent\ntense since it would state that Load happens at all times in\nthe past. We have to find a way to introduce existentially quantified\ninformation.  \nIntuitively, it suffices to introduce new entities into the domain of\ndiscourse. This approach lies at the heart of dynamic semantic\ntheories such as Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle 1993,\nand see also the entry on\n Discourse Representation Theory)\n or File Change Semantics (Heim 1982). We will need an update\nprocedure that introduces new actions/events into the discourse model\nbut is compatible with the non-monotonic semantics introduced so far.\nFollowing van Lambalgen and Hamm (2005) we will use integrity\nconstraints—a device from database theory (for a more\ncomplete and formal treatment the reader is referred to Kowalski 1995\nand van Lambalgen and Hamm 2005: ch. 8)—to implement the notion\nof a minimal update of a discourse model. Consider discourse (50).\n \nIn interpreting the first sentence, we want to update the situation\nmodel in a way that makes the sentence true. The tense information\nwill be interpreted as a goal to minimally update the situation model\nwith a fluent Loaded that holds now. In our framework\nsemantic interpretation is thus closely linked to planning, in that\nfinding an interpretation for a sentences requires coming up with a\nsequence of actions that makes the goal succeed.  \n\nTo resolve this integrity constraint we will use the axioms of the\nSimple Event Calculus plus the world knowledge about the consequences\nof a load action stated in (52).  \n\nIn logic programming, the sort of reasoning required to resolve (51)\nis carried out by a derivation procedure called resolution.\nWe will use resolution here in a non-standard way, i.e. logic\nprogramming combined with integrity constraints (for details see van\nLambalgen and Hamm 2005). It starts with the formula that has to be\nmade true in the discourse model. Resolution proceeds by identifying\nrules which have the query as their consequent and substituting the\nconsequent with the antecedent conditions of the rule, making the\nantecedent formulas new queries themselves. The resolution stops when\nthe query cannot be further resolved, that is, when a plan has been\ncomputed whose preconditions are all fulfilled given an appropriate\nupdate of the discourse model. To get an impression of how this works\nwe will illustrate the resolution of (51). First, we have to compute\nthe completion of the program and whenever possible substitute the\nvariables with constants, in our case Loaded and\n\nnow. In logic programming this substitution is done\nautomatically via unification. Here is the completion of the\nHoldsAt predicate which forms the head of two\naxioms—(35) and (36).  \n\nSince the theory doesn’t contain the statement\nInitially(Loaded), closed world reasoning yields\nthat at time 0 the gun is not loaded\n\\((\\neg\\)Initially(Loaded)). No matter how we update\nthe discourse representation the first disjunct can never succeed. We\nthus have to move on to the second disjunct. In this case, the\ndatabase is searched for an action \\(a\\) and a time \\(s\\) such\nthat Initiates\\((a, f, s)\\),\n\nHappens\\((a, s)\\) and\n\\(\\neg\\)Clipped\\((s\\), Loaded, \\(t)\\). On the\nsole basis of the information provided in the discourse the subquery\n?Happens\\((a, s)\\) will fail, because in discourse\n(50) there is no information about a load action. However, since\nintegrity constraints are intended to be made true, the database will\nbe updated with a clause Happens(Load,\n\\(s) \\wedge s \\lt\\)\n\nnow which makes the second disjunct true and the query\nsucceed.  \nIn the following, we will analyze the imperfective paradox as an\ninstance of the frame problem (cf. Stenning and van Lambalgen 2005;\nvan Lambalgen and Hamm 2005; Stenning and van Lambalgen 2008; Baggio\nand van Lambalgen 2007; Baggio et al. 2008). Both activities and\naccomplishments involve continuous change and we therefore have to add\nadditional predicates and axioms to properly deal with gradually\nchanging objects which are under the influence of an external force.\nTable 5 introduces two new predicates; axioms A1–A5 provide a\ngeneral theory of instantaneous and continuous change (from van\nLambalgen and Hamm 2005: 40). As can be easily seen, the axiom system\nextends that of Shanahan (1997).  Table 5.\n\nPredicates for continuous change \nAxioms 4 and 5 define continuous change. Axiom 4 defines the\nTrajectory predicate. To see what it says, let’s consider a\nsituation of running a mile where \\(f_1\\) is\ninstantiated by running and \\(f_2\\) by\ndistance\\((x)\\). Should running be true during\nthe whole interval from \\(t\\) until \\(t'\\) then distance\\((a + 1)\\) will be true\nat \\(t'\\). The value of \\(x\\), that is, the actual\ndistance actually run at each time instant will be determined by the\nlaw of the process under consideration (here, running speed). Axiom 5\ndefines the predicate Clipped\\((t,\nf, t')\\)\nwhich is true if \\(f\\) is terminated or released by an event\n\\(e\\) which happens in the time interval between \\(t\\) and\n\\(t'\\). Thus Clipped covers both instantaneous and\ncontinuous change. The axioms provide a general theory of what can\nchange and what stays constant. \nFor concrete situations, we also need the specific temporal and causal\nrelationships. This kind of information is specified in so called\nscenarios representing lexical meaning. The lexical meaning\nof the accomplishment run a mile corresponds to scenario\n(54). Like the axioms, the scenario takes the form of a logic program.\nAll variables are universally quantified.  \nScenarios formalize the event nucleus of Moens and Steedman (1988).\nEvery accomplishment takes the same form of scenario, the only\ndifferences being that the individual scenarios involve different\npreparatory processes (run, build, etc.), incremental\nthemes (distance\\((x)\\), house\\((x)\\), etc.)\nand resultant states. Furthermore, it is obvious that the preparatory\nprocess run, an activity, is a proper part of scenario (54).\nThe simpler activity scenario can be easily arrived at if we remove\nclauses (d)–(f) from (54). We are now in the position to solve\nthe imperfective paradox avoiding the problems discussed in\n section 6.\n Both a past progressive activity sentence as in (55a) and a past\nprogressive accomplishment sentence (55b) will trigger a discourse\nupdate as stated in integrity constraint (55c).  \nThe discourse update of the completed program (54) yields that at some\npoint after \\(t\\) John will achieve the culmination and will have\nrun one mile (see van Lambalgen and Hamm 2005: 61ff. for a proof).\nObviously, the same integrity constraint in combination with the\nactivity in (55a) only licenses the inferences that there was some\npast running activity. In the case of an accomplishment the course of\nevents dramatically changes if we add information to the\nrepresentation as in (56b). Now, both (56a) and (56b) only allow the\ninference that there was a running event but, arguably, John didn’t\nreach his goal in (56b). Without going into further details it should\nbe clear how this non-monotonic inference works. The derivation works\nanalogously to the simpler instances of the frame problem discussed\nabove.  \nThe solution to the imperfective paradox just outlined makes reference\nto the intentions of the agent involved in the event; therefore the\nnotion of a goal or intention is built into the system right from the\nstart. Note, however, it does not involve possible worlds, or\nprimitive notions like inertia worlds; instead it is based upon\nminimal models and non-monotonic reasoning. This yields additional\nbenefits. Firstly, the Event Calculus will compute a minimal model in\ncases where an integrity constraint can be satisfied. Moreover, the\nnumber of construction steps required for this yields a precise\ncomplexity measure which (for example) allows us to derive predictions\nfor cognitive processing. Secondly, the non-monotonic nature of the\nEvent Calculus can be used to model the incremental construction of a\ntemporal model with inferences which hold locally at a discourse\nsegment \\(s_n\\) but which can be undone at some\nlater discourse unit \\(s_{n+1}\\). This is a\nnecessary prerequisite if we think of interpreting sentences like\n(56b) from left to right assuming incremental interpretation (see\ne.g., Baggio and van Lambalgen 2007 and Bott 2010 for implementations\nof the Event Calculus as a processing model). In the next section we\nwill review psychological and psycholinguistic work on the\ninterpretation of aspect which will provide empirical motivation for\nthe outlined analysis.  \nDue to limitations of space, we will not discuss psychological and\npsycholinguistic studies of tense but will focus solely on processing\nstudies of aspect. Moreover, within this topic we limit ourselves to\nstudies of the adult system. The interested reader is referred to\nDickey (2001) and the references therein for psycholinguistic work on\ntense as well as to the entry on\n the experience and perception of time\n\n and the contributions in Grondin (2008) for psychology of time in\ngeneral.  \nPsychologists have recently begun studying event perception and its\nneural basis (e.g., Zacks and Tversky 2001; Zacks, Tversky, and Iyer\n2001; Zacks et al. 2006). The underlying question behind this line of\nresearch is whether events play a role in how we cognitively structure\nand remember changing states of affairs and how they are represented.\nZacks, Tversky, and Iyer (2001) use an analogy from the domain of\nobjects to the domain of events to define an event as a “segment\nin time at a given location that is conceived by an observer to have a\nbeginning and an end” (p.30). They claim that “the ability\nto identify the parts of events and their relationships constitutes a\ndistinct perceptual process” (p.30) which they call event\nstructure perception. Just as an object is an ontological\nprimitive in the spatial domain, so an event is an ontological\nprimitive in the spatio-temporal\n domain.[9]\n Objects are recognized by shape, color etc. and have boundaries in\nspace. Analogously, events have boundaries in time, but are also\nbounded in space. An event of buttering toast, for instance, happens\nat a particular time, but also in a particular location in space and\nis therefore spatially bounded. Continuing the analogy, both objects\nand events can be identified and categorized using hierarchical\nrelations.  \n\nIn Zacks, Tversky, and Iyer’s experiments, participants segmented an\nongoing activity (like washing dishes) while watching it on\nfilm by pressing a key to mark “natural and meaningful”\nunit boundaries. The grain at which participants segmented the\nactivity was manipulated between subjects: one group was asked to mark\nthe largest meaningful units (coarse grain size), the other group the\nsmallest units (fine grain size) which still could be considered to be\ncomplete events. The placement of perceived event boundaries provides\ninformation about the psychological status of events and their\npartonomic hierarchy. If the stream of action is perceived as\nconsisting of discrete events, participants should place event\nboundaries consistently and this is what Zacks, Tversky, and Iyer\n(2001) found. Further, if participants make use of partonomic\nhierarchies, coarse event boundaries should be aligned with fine\nboundaries, since the end of each superordinate event is also the end\nof its last subevent. Again, this hypothesis was corroborated by a\nstrong hierarchical bias effect. Events thus seem to be\npsychologically real and to be hierarchically structured.  \nDuring the last decade psycholinguists have started to investigate the\ncognitive reality of lexical aspect and how it is processed. The\nexisting studies can be sub-classified into studies concerning\nAktionsart simpliciter and those concerned with shifts from\none aspectual class to an other, i.e., aspectual coercion. In\nthe following, we will provide a brief overview of both areas of\nresearch.  \nMcKoon and Macfarland (2002) were among the first to study processing\nconsequences of decompositional analyses along the lines of Dowty\n(1979). They provided evidence from reading times and lexical decision\ntimes that accomplishments \\((\\alpha\\) CAUSE \\(x\\) BECOME IN-STATE)\nare inherently more complex than achievements \\((x\\) BECOME\nIN-STATE). Similarly, Gennari and Poeppel (2003) compared eventive\npredicates (which included accomplishments, achievements and\nactivities) to statives and found that the former were more complex to\nprocess than the latter. Brennan and Pylkkänen (2010) extended\nthis line of research to psychological verbs and compared\naccomplishments (e.g., scare) with statives (e.g.,\n\ncherish) using reading time methods and\nmagnetoencephalography (MEG). They also included a comparison of the\nsimple psychological statives with modified sentences that required\ncoercion (e.g., within half an hour, the child cherished the\nprecious kitten). Reading times and MEG data indicated that\naccomplishments were more complex to comprehend than statives and,\nmoreover, that the enhanced semantic complexity led to different MEG\ncomponents than aspectual coercion. Finally, Coll-Florit and Gennari\n(2011) compared durative states and punctual event predicates (mostly\nachievements) and observed longer reading times of statives than of\nevent predicates. They attributed this effect—which runs counter\nto what would be expected under a decomposition analysis—to the\nfact that durative situations occur in semantically more diverse\ncontexts and elicit more diverse associations than event predicates\nwhich may modulate the required processing effort. Taken together, the\nexisting studies provide evidence for complexity differences between\nthe aspectual classes, lending support to decompositional analyses.\nHowever, not all issues are entirely solved yet and further research\nis required.  \nThe second line of research concerns aspectual coercion. Here, the\nmain research question has been whether aspectual coercion is a costly\noperation. Existing research has almost exclusively focused on one\ncoercion type, i.e., coercion of point action verbs into an iterative\ninterpretation (but see Brennan and Pylkkänen 2010 and Bott 2010\nfor exceptions). Again, the findings are mixed. Early studies have\nprovided evidence for coercion costs employing secondary tasks such as\ncross-modal lexical decision or stop making sense\njudgments (Piñango, Zurif, and Jackendoff 1999; Todorova\net al. 2000). Pickering et al. (2006) used the same materials as in\nthe experiments mentioned above, but tested a coerced meaning during\nordinary reading without an additional task. In two self-paced reading\nand two eyetracking experiments, they found aspectual coercion to be\nno more difficult than their aspectual control conditions. This lack\nof effect let them propose the aspectual underspecification\nhypothesis, stating that the aspectual representation stays\nunderspecified during normal reading. Brennan and Pylkkänen\n(2008) challenged this view and reported a coercion effect of coercion\nsentences like (57a) as compared to aspectual controls (57b) both in\nself-paced reading and in MEG; on the basis of a rating study they had\ncarefully selected clear instances of point action verbs. Their MEG\nstudy revealed activation in the anterior midline field, a MEG\ncomponent that has been observed for other non-aspectual cases of\ncoercion, too.  \nComplicating matters, Bott (2008, 2010) applied the same norming\nprocedures, but did not find evidence of coercion cost in iterative\npoint action verbs in German. With other types of aspectual coercion,\nhowever, there were clear indications of processing difficulty\nindicating that the underlying processes differ between coercion\ntypes. Furthermore, the study provided evidence that at least in some\ncases (achievement ⇝ accomplishment) coercion operations are not\ntriggered by an aspectual mismatch, but can proceed smoothly by\nenriching the aspectual representation with additional eventualities.\nThis was shown in an event-related potentials (ERP) study in which a\ndouble dissociation of ERP components was elicited by sentences with\naspectual coercion as compared to sentences that contained an\naspectual mismatch. \nGrammatical aspect has recently received increased interest in\npsycholinguistics (for a comprehensive review see Madden and Ferretti\n2009). One line of studies has investigated (e.g., Ferretti\net al. 2007) the accessibility of event participants in English\nprogressive and simple sentences. They provide evidence that, in line\nwith the linguistic description provided above, the progressive\npresents an event from the inside, making participants, instruments\nand places fully accessible, whereas the simple forms present events\nas complete units and the event participants are less accessible.\nUsing picture selection/verification, Madden and Zwaan (2003) found\nthat participants were faster and more likely to choose a picture\nshowing a complete event, rather than a picture depicting an ongoing\nevent, after they had read a sentence with an accomplishment verb in\nthe simple past. This indicates that English speakers encode\naccomplishments in the simple past as complete events. This finding\nwas supported by a study by Anderson et al. (2008). They compared\naccomplishments describing a path such as Tom jogged/was jogging\nto the woods and then stretched when he got there. Participants\nlistened to these sentences while using a computer mouse to drag and\ndrop a human character in a visual scene. When hearing a sentence in\nthe past progressive, many drops took place at the beginning and the\ncenter of the path, whereas in the simple past most drops were at the\nend of the path. Interestingly, the differences were by no means\ncategorical. Even in the simple past condition, the character was in\nsome trials positioned well before the end of the path. This indicates\nthat accomplishments in the simple past are consistent with incomplete\nevents.  \nAnother study relevant for the discussion in the previous sections is\nan ERP study on the imperfective paradox by Baggio et al. (2008). They\ninvestigated the processing of Dutch imperfective sentences such as\nhet meisje was een brief aan het schrijven (the girl was\nwriting a letter) which were either followed by a\n\nwhen-clause that made the culmination unlikely (when her\nfriend spilled coffee on the paper) or by a sentence which was\ncompatible with the attainment of the goal (when her friend spilled\ncoffee on the tablecloth). The first kind of sentences elicited larger\nsustained anterior negativities compared to sentences that were\ncompatible with the culmination. Moreover, the amplitude of the\nnegativity was correlated with the frequency with which participants\nresponded that the culmination was not reached. These findings\nindicate that a progressive sentence triggers a default inference to a\ncomplete event which can be canceled again, if the context so\nrequires.  \nGrammatical aspect is subject to clear crosslinguistic differences.\nThis raises the question of whether the grammatical system has an\ninfluence on how we process language. In von Stutterheim et al. (2009)\nthe authors reported findings of a production study comparing event\ndescriptions of English, German and Dutch speakers that were elicited\nwhile they were watching and describing a silent video clip. Their\nstudy revealed clear differences between productions from the three\nlanguages. English speakers used the progressive to start event\ndescriptions well before the endpoint was visible (e.g., A car is\ngoing down a lane … to a farmhouse). Germans showed a\ndifferent behavior, relating their descriptions to the endpoint of a\nmotion event. It thus seems as if production is constrained by the\nlanguage in which it is realized. Recently, von Stutterheim et al.\n(2012) extended this line of research to a sample of seven languages\nand showed that the aspectual properties of a language influence how\nspeakers conceptualize events. It’s not only that speakers of\ndifferent languages talked differently about motion events (e.g.,\nmention of endpoints), their language also had a clear influence on\ntheir viewing behavior while watching the movies and influenced their\nmemory capacity for those parts of the scene corresponding to\nendpoints.  As for comprehension, Bott and Hamm (2014)\ninvestigated how the aspectual system of a language influences\nprocessing difficulty. They compared coercion of German and English\naccomplishments which were modified by for \\(x\\) time\nadverbials. (58) is a sample item.  \nIn the German experiments, condition (58a) was read as fast as a\nnon-coercing control condition with an in x time adverbial.\nThis was different in English where the authors found coercion to\ncause a substantial slowdown of reading speed. They interpret this\ncrosslinguistic difference as follows: languages which have the\ngrammatical means to express an aspectual difference via alternative\nforms—the progressive vs. simple forms in English—enforce\nimmediate aspectual commitment, whereas languages that lack this\ngrammatical feature have to leave it underspecified. In other words,\nGerman readers will leave it to the context whether an accomplishment\nexpresses a complete or incomplete event, whereas English readers\nimmediately strengthen an accomplishment in the simple form into a\ncomplete event interpretation. They take this strengthening to be a\npragmatic process that is due to competition between alternative\ngrammatical forms. In an eyetracking during reading study, Bott and Gattnar (2015)\nfollowed up on the observed cross-linguistic variation in the\nprocessing of grammatical aspect comparing an aspect language, Russian,\nwith the non-aspect language German. They investigated whether the\ndifferences in the aspectual systems of the two languages affected the\ntime course of mismatch detection in the case of lexical aspectual\nmismatch.All test sentences contained clear instances of (in Russian always perfective) transitive achievement verbs such as  win, find, reach, notice, etc. which were modified by a semantically mismatching for-adverbial (e.g., for three hours) or a semantically fitting ago-adverbial (e.g., three hours ago)\nin aspectual control conditions. Crucially, both Russian and German\nhave relatively free word order making it possible to test for effects\nof mismatching vs. matchingadverbials in the word order  subject verb object adverbial but also in the order adverbial verb subject object. The results show that Russian readers immediately detect the aspectual  mismatch\nirrespective of whether they have seen the subject or the object\nargument yet. This is different in German where aspectual mismatch\ndetection only started after the verb plus all its obligary arguments\nhad been encountered. This result was modeled by Bott and Sternefeld\n(2017) in an incremental event semantics drawing on insights from\nmereological semantics as proposed by Krifka (1989, 1992); see\n also\n section 6.1 (and the entry\n mereology).\nThe incremental semantic derivations show that in a non-aspect language\nlike German, lexical aspect really is a property of whole sentences and\nstrongly depends on the compositional interpretation of the verb, its\narguments, and their thematic roles. In an aspect language like\nRussian, on the other hand, the grammatical aspect imposes itself\nstrong constraints on lexical aspectual interpretation. These\npsycholinguistic results thus nicely fit semantic proposals for\ngrammatical aspect that have been proposed in the framework of\nmereological semantics (see, e.g., Filip 2008, a.o.). \nTo summarize, the existing studies lend empirical support to the\naspectual distinctions made in the semantic and philosophic\nliterature. Moreover, the grammatical system of a language influences\nthe way language is processed and may even influence the way we\nexperience the world.  \nWe introduced and discussed several important semantic, philosophical\nand technical concepts and theories of temporality and at least\nindicated how these concepts and theories are related to cognition.\nHowever, we did this exclusively from a sentence internal perspective.\nTense and aspect are important means for organizing discourse as\n well.[10]\n To conclude our overview, we present French examples due to Kamp and\nRohrer (see van Lambalgen and Hamm 2005, ch. 9) and indicate the role\ntense and aspect play in discourse organization. Consider sentence\n(59) in which the passé simple (PS) occurs four times.\n\n \nFirst the PS in (59) provides temporal information; all events are\nlocated in the past. But the PS conveys aspectual information too. It\nsays that the internal constitution of the events is not important and\nthis means that PS expresses perfectivity. PS imposes a view of the\nevents “from the outside”. This is then taken to explain\nwhy multiple uses of the PS imply a succession of the events described\nas witnessed in example (59). This means that Pierre getting up\nprecedes his going up to his room and this event precedes closing the\ndoor which finally precedes turning the radio on. Thus, the PS\nstructures the above little discourse in a particular way. Early\ndiscourse representation theory explains this effect by assuming that\nthe PS introduces a new reference point after a previously introduced\none. \nThe discourse function of the French imparfait is different. Example\n(60a) shows that, like the past in English, the\n imparfait[11]\n is not felicitous when uttered out of the blue.  \nKamp explains these facts in the following way. The imparfait does not\nintroduce its own reference time and in (60a) there is no previous\nreference point given. Therefore (60a) is out. In (60b) the sentence\nin the passé simple Jean ôta sa veste introduces\na reference time that can be used to anchor If faisait chaud.\nThe imperfective aspect of the imparfait is then explained by the fact\nthat the PS event happens while the sentence in the imparfait holds.\nThus passé simple and imparfait not only provide temporal\ninformation but they also serve as means to structure discourse in\ndifferent ways. \nOf course these brief remarks about the discourse function of tense\nand aspect barely touch the tip of the iceberg. For more information\non the discourse semantics of French tense and discourse organization\nin general, the reader is advised to consult de Swart and Corblin\n(2002), Asher and Lascarides (2003) and van Lambalgen and Hamm (2005,\nespecially chapter 9). This short note on discourse structure\ncompletes our article on tense and aspect.

This\nphenomenon is called tense. In English, for example, adding\nthe morpheme -ed to the verb walk, to form\nwalked, indicates that the event denoted by the verb occurred\nbefore the present time. What is called aspect, on the other\nhand, deals with the internal constituency of actions, events, states,\nprocesses or situations. For instance, it may indicate that an action\nis completed or still ongoing. English typically uses the\n-ing form of verbs to indicate ongoing processes, as in\nHe is building a house. \n\n\nAfter a short introduction to basic notions of tense and aspect we\nbriefly discuss temporal logic, and then Reichenbach’s famous\ndistinction between speech time, event time and reference\ntime. Event-based semantic theories treat events as ontological\nprimitives, so in the following section we show how time can be\nconstructed from event structures, as exemplified by the Russell-Kamp\nconstruction. These sections are followed by a discussion of the most\nimportant observations concerning lexical and grammatical aspect,\nincluding the famous imperfective paradox. Next we introduce two\nwidely discussed theories of temporality and show how they cope with\nthe imperfective paradox. This section is followed by one that shows\nhow temporal information is expressed in Artificial Intelligence\n(AI). We use the event calculus from AI to present a solution of the\nimperfective paradox, by viewing it as an instance of the frame\nproblem. The last section is devoted to gathering psycholinguistic\nevidence showing that at least some of the philosophical and semantic\nconcepts discussed in this article may be cognitively real. \n\nTense roughly means reference to the time at which events\ntake place, or at which processes or states hold. English, for\nexample, clearly distinguishes between past and non-past tense as in\n(1a) and (1b) and (1c).  \nIn English, verb forms are typically used to signal the time\nwhen an action or event occurs or a state holds. Thus in (1a), John’s\npromise was given before the present time, in (1b) the promising is\nsimultaneous with the present time and (1c) says that the student’s\nwork on his thesis will occur at some time after the present. It\nshould be noted that the verb forms used to express temporal\ninformation may also be used to signal information that is not purely\ntemporal. For instance, the present tense form in John walks\n\n\ncharacterizes a certain habit of John. And in the statement The\ntrain departs at five o’clock tomorrow, the present verb form\nclearly has a futurate meaning. So English distinguishes between past\nand non-past but not between future and non-future. Moreover, many\nlinguists exclude future as a pure tense, because the auxiliary\nwill may be used to express volition as in He will go\nswimming in dangerous\n water.[1] \nApart from absolute tense—exemplified by\n(1a)–(1c)—where the reference point from which the\nlocation in time is evaluated is the present, there is also\n\nrelative tense where the reference point is not necessarily\nthe present but may be given by context. Thus in a sentence like\nThe student had worked on his thesis the student’s work took\nplace at a time before a reference point in the past, in contrast to\n(1c) where the reference point is the present. Other instances of\nrelative tense in English are the present perfect and the future\nperfect in (2a) respectively (2b).  \nThe notion of aspect according to Comrie refers to\n“[the] different ways of viewing the internal temporal\nconstituency of a situation” (1976: 3). It is customary to\ndistinguish between lexical and grammatical aspect.\nThe following are examples concerning lexical aspect. Since Vendler\n(1967) linguists distinguish at least four aspectual classes. These\nare states like know, activities like run,\naccomplishments like cross the street and achievements\nexemplified by a verb like recognize. Accomplishments\ndescribe the internal temporal constituency of a situation in a more\ndetailed way than (say) activities. Crossing the street, for\nexample, includes the starting of a crossing activity which goes on\nfor some time and involves a result state that is characterized by\nbeing on the other side of the street. No such elaborate descriptions\nare necessary for activities or achievements. There are grammatical\nmeans of distinguishing between these aspectual classes. For example,\nstates and achievements cannot occur with the progressive while\nactivities and accomplishments can; more about this below in\n Section 5.\n\n\n These differences are customarily considered to be lexical\ndifferences and this area is therefore dubbed lexical aspect.\n \nA further crucial aspectual difference is that between perfective and\nimperfective aspect. Comrie characterizes these notions as follows.\n \n…perfectivity indicates the view of the situation as a single\nwhole, without distinction of the various separate phases that make up\nthat situation, while the imperfective pays essential attention to the\ninternal structure of the situation. (Comrie 1976: 16)  \nIn English this difference is often expressed by grammatical\nmeans, for instance by past tense versus past progressive. This is an\ninstance of grammatical aspect. Slavic language often have an\nelaborate grammatical system to signal the difference between\nimperfectivity (ipv) and perfectivity (pv). Here is an example from Russian.  \nSentence (3b) presents the writing of a letter as a single whole and\nit is clear that this activity was finished when the letter was brought to the\npost office. By contrast, (3a) focuses on an ongoing activity of\nletter writing in the past which is not completed because of the\ninterruption. In fact it is consistent with the truth of (3a) that the\nletter was never completely written.  \nThe natural language categories tense and aspect\n\n\nembody the linguistic encoding of time. From a typological point of\nview these categories are typical verbal\n categories.[2]\n This means that if these categories are morphologically realized in a\nlanguage then these morphemes attach to the verb. Verbs usually\nexpress events, processes, actions or\n states[3]\n and the temporal morphemes locate these eventualities in time. Of\ncourse this does not mean that languages that lack such morphemes are\nnot able to express temporal relations. They just have to choose other\nmeans for this purpose. One famous example of a language not\ncontaining temporal morphology is Mandarin Chinese. Often tense and\naspect cannot be clearly separated. For example the Quiché\nprefix \\(x-\\) denotes a completed (aspect) action in the past\n (tense).[4] \nTypologists also observed an asymmetry between past and future. Most\nlanguages that possess temporal morphology use these means to\ndifferentiate between past and non-past. There are, however, a few\nlanguages which use temporal morphology to distinguish between future\nand non-future.  \nWe will not go into further details concerning the linguistic\nrealization of tense and aspect, but present a brief and necessarily\nincomplete review of major philosophical and semantic theories of\nthese notions.  \nTemporal logic was introduced by Arthur Prior (see for instance Prior\n1967). Here we will sketch only propositional temporal logic (for a\nmore thorough introduction the reader is advised to consult Gamut\n1991: chapters 2 and 3) and the entry on\n temporal logic.\n\n\n Temporal logic introduces operators \\(\\bG\\), \\(\\bH\\), \\(\\bF\\) and\n\\(\\bP\\), which are similar to the modal operators \\(\\Box\\) and \\(\\Diamond\\).\nWe summarize the intuitive meaning of these operators in Table 1.  \nBy adding the above operators to propositional logic we extend\npropositional logic to propositional temporal logic. Let \\(q\\)\nabbreviate the sentence Sam is working, then we are able to\nexpress the following verb tenses in temporal logic:  \nA model \\(\\sM\\) for propositional temporal logic consists of a\nnonempty set \\(T\\) of moments of time, an earlier than relation\n\\(\\prec\\) and a valuation function \\(I\\) which for each moment of\ntime and each proposition letter \\(q\\) assigns a truth value\n\\(I_{\\sM ,t}(q)\\). The following\ndefinition characterizes \\(I_{\\sM ,t}(\\phi)\\)\nfor the temporal operators.  \nThese clauses are analogous to the clauses which define the modal\noperators \\(\\Box\\) and \\(\\Diamond\\)—with \\(\\bG\\) and \\(\\bH\\)\ncorresponding to \\(\\Box\\), and \\(\\bF\\) and \\(\\bP\\) to \\(\\Diamond\\)—but\ninstead of possible worlds the valuation function takes moments of\ntime as arguments. Therefore principle (5) is valid in any model,\nsince the modal analogue is valid for \\(\\Box\\) independently of the\naccessibility relation.  \nHowever, principle (6), which is often considered as valid for\n\\(\\Box\\), is presumably not valid for \\(\\bG\\).  \nFormula (6) is equivalent to \\(\\phi \\rightarrow \\bF\\phi\\). The latter\nformula says that if \\(\\phi\\) is the case then \\(\\phi\\) will be the case,\nwhich is intuitively incorrect. Suppose that \\(\\prec\\) is irreflexive;\nthis assumption makes sense since it means that no time point is\nearlier than itself. But under this assumption, Principle (6) is\nobviously wrong. For extensions of temporal logic and more examples\nconcerning the correspondence between properties of models and the\nvalidity or invalidity of formulas see Gamut 1991: chapter 2. \nThis concludes our brief remarks about temporal logic. We now turn to\nan alternative approach due to the philosopher Hans Reichenbach.  \nThe notions speech time, event time, and\n\nreference time were introduced by Reichenbach (1947) in order\nto distinguish simple past and present perfect or, more generally,\nabsolute and relative tense. According to Comrie (1985), who refined\nReichenbach’s system (in Chapter 6 of his book on tense) speech time\nand event time are sufficient for the analysis of absolute\ntime; i.e., present, (simple) past and future. But for\nrelative tense—of which the present perfect is but one\nexample—reference time is required. Let us explain these notions\nby applying them to distinguish between past and present perfect.  \nConsider the following examples from Steedman (1997).  \nIt has often been observed that the present perfect in English has\npresent relevance. For instance the continuation of (7a) with but\nI have found it again is infelicitous in English; the German\ntranslation of this sequence is acceptable, showing that the German\nperfect is more like a past tense (but see Kamp et al. 2015 for an\nextensive discussion, in Other Internet Resources). The same\ncontinuation is fine for sentence (7b). In this sense the perfect is a\nrelative tense and the past an absolute tense in English. Let \\(E\\)\nbe short for event time and let \\(S, R\\) stand for speech\ntime and reference time respectively.  \nFor the simple past, both event time and reference time are situated\non the time line before speech time. In case of the perfect, R and S\nare simultaneous and E is earlier than both R and S. Intuitively,\nreference time represents the perspective from which an eventuality is\nperceived on the time line. This is not a purely semantic theory of\ntense like temporal logic, rather it is a pragmatic theory of tense.\nIn particular, reference time (in contrast to event time) has to be\nmutually known by communication partners. When using the present\nperfect, reference time is known since it coincides with speech time.\nHowever, reference time is not necessarily known when the past tense\nis used, since it is just required to be earlier than speech time and\nto coincide with event time. This may explain why sentences in the\npast sound strange when uttered out of the blue. Steedman (1997)\npresents the following examples:  \nThe past-tensed sentence (8a) uttered out of the blue is infelicitous,\nwhile sentence (8b) is fine, since in this case the\nwhen-clause introduces the reference time. \nThis is by no means the complete story of the perfect. For example,\nComrie (1976) distinguishes four typical uses of the perfect: the\nperfect of result, the experiential perfect, the perfect of persistent\nsituation and the perfect of recent past. For an extensive recent\ndiscussion the reader is advised to consult Kamp et al. 2015 (in Other\nInternet Resources).  \n\n\nThe following table summarizes the positions of event time, reference\ntime and speech time for other tenses:  \nComrie (1985) and Gamut (1991) point out that this cannot be a\ncomplete account for temporal constructions that occur in natural\nlanguages. For instance the temporal profile of the sentence Sam\nwould have worked cannot be analyzed by using a single reference\ntime. This is one reason for the extended requirements for a formal\ntheory of tense proposed by Comrie (1985: chapter 6). Furthermore, \nBlackburn and Jørgensen (2016) combine the key insights of Prior \nand Reichenbach in the framework of hybrid tense logic suggesting that \nthe two approaches are fully compatible with each other. In event semantics following Davidson (1967) events are commonly\ntaken as ontological primitives. This raises the philosophical\nquestion how events and times relate to each other. A construction,\ndue to Russell, Wiener and Kamp, shows that the time line can be\nconstructed from events. We will briefly sketch this construction\nbefore we move on to lexical and grammatical aspect. Russell remarked: \n\nEven if there be a physical world such as the mathematical theory of\nmotion presupposes, impressions on our sense-organs produce sensations\nwhich are not merely and strictly instantaneous, and therefore the\nobjects of sense of which we are immediately conscious are not\nstrictly instantaneous. Instants, therefore, are not among the data of\nexperience and must be either inferred or constructed. It is difficult\nto see how they can be validly inferred; thus we are left with the\nalternative that they must be constructed. (Russell 1914: lecture\nIV) Kamp (1979)\ntook up Russell’s ideas and slightly modified them. The construction\ntakes event structures as primitives from which the structure of time,\ni.e., a total order, can be derived.  \nAn event structure \\(\\langle E, P, O\\rangle\\) simply\nconsists of a set of events \\(E\\) and the relations \\(P\\)\n(precedes) and \\(O\\) (overlaps) and is\ncharacterized by axioms A1–7.  \nGiven an event structure satisfying these axioms, the set of instants\nand their strict linear ordering can be constructed according to\ndefinition 2. The idea is to identify an instant with the maximal set\nof pairwise overlapping events. Instants are thus conceived of as\nabstractions over events that happen (or go on) simultaneously. Events\nlinked by the precedence relation will give rise to distinct instants.\n \n\nWe will first illustrate the Russell-Kamp construction by way of an\nexample and then show that \\(\\langle I,\\lt \\rangle\\) has the\nproperties specified in Theorem 1: it is a strict linear ordering\nwhich gives rise to an interval structure.  \nExample 1.  Let \\(E = \\{a, b, c, d, e\\}\\) and \\(P\\) be the\nset of ordered pairs \\(\\{(a, c), (a, d), (a, e), (b, e), (c,\ne)\\}\\). Given A7, the relation \\(O\\) consists of the set of pairs\n\\(\\{(a, b), (b, c), (b, d), (c, d), (d, e)\\}\\).  \\(E\\) contains three\nmaximal subsets of pairwise overlapping events, that is, instants\n\\(i_1 = \\{a, b\\}\\), \\(i_2 = \\{b, c, d\\}\\) and \\(i_3 = \\{d,\ne\\}\\). Furthermore, \\(i_1\\), \\(i_2\\) and \\(i_3\\) are linearly ordered\nas \\(i_1 \\lt i_2 \\lt i_3\\) because \\(a \\in i_1\\), \\(c \\in i_2\\) and\n\\(P(a, c)\\) hence \\(i_1 \\lt i_2\\), and \\(c \\in i_2\\), \\(e \\in i_3\\)\nand \\(P(c, e)\\) hence \\(i_2 \\lt i_3\\), and similarly for \\(i_1 \\lt\ni_3.\\) \n \nA proof of the following theorem can be found in (Kamp 1979: 379).\n \nOnce having constructed the set \\(I\\) it is possible to define time\nintervals and these, in turn, can be used to measure the temporal\nextent of an event. In Example 1, for example, \\(a\\) goes\non in the interval [\\(i_1], b\\) in\n[\\(i_1, i_2], c\\) in\n[\\(i_2], d\\) in [\\(i_2,\ni_3\\)] and \\(e\\) in [\\(i_3\\)].\nCorollary 1 guarantees that these intervals can be constructed (Kamp\n1979: 379).  Corollary 1. For each \\(e \\in E\\), the set \\(e' =\\{i \\in I\n\\mid e \\in i\\}\\) is a non-empty interval of \\(\\langle I,\\lt\n\\rangle.\\) \nProof: If \\(i_1, i_2 \\in e'\\) and \\(i_1 \\lt i \\lt i_2\\), it has to be\nshown that \\(e \\in i\\), too. Suppose it is not.  Then there is \\(d \\in\ni\\) such that \\(\\neg O(d, e)\\), hence \\(P(d, e)\\) or \\(P(e, d)\\). In\nthe first case \\(i \\lt i_1\\) and in the second case \\(i_2 \\lt\ni\\). Both yield a contradiction.\\(\\Box\\)  \nWe cannot give further details here, but refer the interested reader\nto Thomason (1986) who discusses how to construct time as a\ncontinuum—isomorphic to the real numbers—and uses a\ndifferent construction originally proposed by Walker (1947). Empirical\nevidence for events being ontological primitives will be presented in\n section 8\nwhere we review psychological studies on event perception. We will now\nmove to lexical and grammatical aspect, that is the expression of event\ntypes and how a given event is conceptualized, which form basic\nconcepts in linguistic theory. \nLinguists distinguish four or five lexical aspectual classes or\nAktionsarten. The following four were introduced by the\nphilosopher Zeno Vendler (1967: chapter four) on the basis of earlier\nwork by philosophers such as Kenny, Ryle and Aristotle (see also the\n entry on events). For a formal\ndefinition of Aktionsart the reader is referred to van\nLambalgen and Hamm (2005: 85 ff).  \nIn addition, linguists often assume that verbs like flash,\nspot and blink form an extra class—the class\nof semelfactives or points (see Smith 1991).  \nA useful notion for distinguishing Aktionarten is the\nevent nucleus introduced by Moens and Steedman (1988). The\nevent nucleus is constructed from a preparatory phase, a culminating\nevent and a consequent phase. Activities only refer to the preparatory\nphase, states only to the consequent phase, achievements to the\nculminating event and to the consequent phase and finally\naccomplishments to all three parts of the event nucleus.  \n\nVendler proposed several linguistic tests for distinguishing these\nverb classes. We will present only the most important ones here; for a\nmuch more comprehensive list the reader is referred to Dowty (1979: 60).\nThe first test separates non-statives from statives. Only non-statives\noccur in the progressive.  \nAccomplishment verbs prefer \\(in\\)-adverbials as temporal\nmodifiers, whereas activity verbs allow only\nfor-adverbials. \nAchievement verbs are usually infelicitous with\n\nfor-adverbials but allow the combination with\n\\(in\\)-adverbials.  \nThe last test we mention here concerns the different entailment\npatterns of activities and accomplishments in the progressive.\nActivities in the past progressive entail their past reading but\naccomplishments in the past progressive don’t.  \nThis is an instance of the famous imperfective paradox. Of course,\ntaken literally this is not a paradox. Nevertheless the entailment\npatterns (12) and (13) pose a significant problem for any formal\ntheory of tense and aspect. For instance, the first formal proposal\nfor truth conditions of sentences in the past progressive stated that\na sentence S in the past progressive is true if and only if there\nexists an open interval before the speech time at which the sentence\nwithout the progressive is true. According to definition 1.4 this\nimmediately validates pattern (12) but without qualifications this\ntruth definition does not account for pattern (13). Sections\n 6\n and\n 7\ncontain extensive discussion of the imperfective paradox.  \nVendler thought of the Aktionarten as lexical properties of\nverbs. That this position is dubious was pointed out by many\nlinguists, in particular by Dowty (1979) and Verkuyl (1993). For a\nsimple case, consider the verb drink. If we assume that being\nan activity is a lexical property of this verb, then surely by\ncombining it with the noun wine this property is preserved\nfor the complex phrase drink wine. However, if we combine the\nverb drink with the noun phrase a bottle of wine we\nturn an activity into an accomplishment. The converse problem arises\nif we assume that being an accomplishment is a lexical property of\n\ndrink. This phenomenon of aspectual reinterpretation was\ndubbed coercion in Moens and Steedman (1988). In\n Section 6.1 \nwe will sketch a systematic solution for these types of coercion\n in mereological semantics (Krifka 1989, 1992).  \nAktionsart is not even definitely fixed at the VP-level. The\nverb arrive in  \nis an achievement, as demonstrated by the ungrammaticality of (14-b).\nBut if we choose a bare plural as subject it is turned into an\nactivity and sentence (15) is grammatical.  \nTherefore a final decision about aspectual class cannot be reached\nbelow the sentence level. Steedman’s famous sentence (16)  \nshows that coercion can be iterated and that aspectual class can\nswitch back and forth in this iteration process. We close this section\nwith two further examples of aspectual coercion. In the first one a\nstative verb is transformed into an activity. \nThe verb resemble is a stative verb and therefore (17a) is\nunacceptable but (17b) is fine.  \nHowever, if we add more and more every day to (17a) thus\nforming  \n\nwe get an acceptable result. This is due to the phrase more and\nmore every day which coerces a state into an activity. Our last\nexample is about temporal modification with for-adverbials.\nAs pointed out above accomplishments are usually rather bad with\nfor-adverbials. They require \\(in\\)-adverbials. But\nconsider sentence (19) from van Lambalgen and Hamm (2005).  \nThis sentence seems to be fine. However it is not interpreted as an\naccomplishment any more but is reinterpreted as an iterated activity.\nTo get this reading, a lot of non-linguistic knowledge is required.\nFirst, one has to guess that Opus 111 refers to Beethoven’s last piano\nsonata and moreover one has to be aware that this piece lasts about 25\nminutes. Under these assumptions, sentence (19) says that Pollini\nplayed Opus 111 repeatedly within a time span of two weeks. Formal\naccounts of coercion phenomena are contained in Egg (2005), van\nLambalgen and Hamm (2005) and Steedman (1997) among others. The reader\nis also advised to consult Steedman’s updated manuscript, The\nProductions of Time (see the Other Internet Resources).\nProcessing studies of coercion are reviewed in Bott (2010); see also\n Section 8.\n\n  \n\nThe most influential approach to solving the imperfective paradox is\ndue to Dowty (1979). The basic idea is to treat the progressive as a\nmodal operator \\((\\Box)\\) but restrict its domain to inertia worlds.\nThe notion of an inertia world is characterized informally.\nAn inertia world is exactly like the real world up to the time of\nevaluation; after this it may differ from the real world but is\nassumed to be as similar to the real world as possible. Given this\nnotion, the following definition introduces truth conditions for\nsentences in the progressive.  Definition 3.  PROG\\((\\phi)\\) is true with\nrespect to interval \\(I\\) and world \\(w\\) if and only if \\(\\forall w'\n\\in IE(w)\\) there exists an interval \\(I' \\supseteq I\\) such that\n\\(\\phi\\) is true with respect to \\(I'\\) and \\(w'\\). In addition \\(I\\)\nshould not be the final subinterval of \\(I'\\). \\(IE(w)\\) is the set of\ninertia worlds for \\(w\\). \nDefinition 3 does not yet account for the different entailment\npatterns of activities and accomplishments. Two additional assumptions\nare required. The first concerns activities; the second,\naccomplishments.  \nAccomplishments like Mary draw a circle are split up into two\nparts, an activity part Mary draw that satisfies principle\n(20) and a result part which is characterized by the existence of a\ncircle. Both parts are connected by a causality relation\n\nCAUSE.  \nThus an accomplishment has a richer internal structure than an\nactivity.  \nWith these additional requirements, the inference patterns for\nactivities and accomplishments follow. Let us first show that Mary\nwas pushing a cart implies Mary pushed a cart. Assume\nthat the first sentence is true in \\(w\\) with respect to speech time\n\\(S\\). Then Mary be pushing a cart is true in \\(w\\) with\nrespect to an interval \\(I\\) before \\(S\\).  According to Definition 3,\nMary push a cart is then true in every inertia world \\(w' \\in\nIE(w)\\) with respect to an interval \\(I' \\supseteq I\\). Because of\npostulate (20), Mary push a cart is true in every \\(w' \\in\nIE(w)\\) with respect to interval \\(I \\ (I\\) is a subinterval of\n\\(I')\\). Now, the definition of inertia worlds implies that\n\nMary push a cart is true in \\(w\\) with respect to interval\n\\(I\\). This means that Mary pushed a cart is true in\n\\(w\\) with respect to speech time \\(S\\).  \nA completely analogous argument shows that Mary was drawing a\ncircle implies Mary drew. But postulate (20) only holds\nfor the first part of accomplishments; the result part is only\nrequired to hold in every inertia world \\(w'\\) with respect\nto a larger interval \\(I'\\), normally one after speech time.\nSince the inertia worlds after \\(S\\) may differ from \\(w\\) and\nsince the subinterval property (20) is not required to hold for the\nresult parts of accomplishments, the stronger conclusion that Mary\ndrew a circle does not follow.  \nMany researchers assume that inertia worlds introduce a notion of\nnormality for the semantic analysis of the progressive. The\nthunderbolt in example (22) from Landman (1992) seems to break the\nnormal development of the real world. Dowty’s analysis seems to be\ntailored for cases like this one.  \n\nHowever, objections have been raised to the normality interpretation\nof inertia. The first one is attributed to Frank Vlach in Ogihara\n(1990). Consider sentence (23)  \nand a situation in which the truck is only a few centimeters away from\nJohn. Moreover the truck’s speed is such that it is impossible for it\nto stop before hitting John. In this situation, the normal course of\nevents is such that John will never reach the other side of the\nstreet. Therefore, given definition 3, sentence (23) should be false\nunder these circumstances. This is intuitively incorrect. A similar\nobjection was raised by Bonomi (1997). \nOn the other hand, the normality interpretation seems to be at least\nquestionable. Consider the following example from Naumann and\nPiñón (1997).  \nThis does presumably not mean that when you are running across a\nminefield, you normally will eventually get to the other side. \nNote that these objections all make use of a particular informal\ninterpretation of the notion inertia. Judging the validity of\nthese objections to Dowty’s theory in a precise way therefore requires\nan explicit theory of this notion with exact empirical predictions.\n \nDowty analyzes the progressive as an intensional construction. Does\nthe progressive satisfy the standard philosophical tests for\nintensional constructions, that is, the invalidity of substitution of\nco-designative proper names and the impossibility of pulling the\nexistential quantifier out of the context created by the intensional\nconstruction (see Bealer and Mönnich (1989) for a more detailed\ndiscussion)? Let us consider accomplishments, for example sentence\n(25).  \nGiven that Ruth Rendel and Barbara Vine are co-designative proper\nnames, sentence (25) implies that Jackson Pollock was painting\nBarbara Vine. Therefore the first test fails. Co-designative\nproper names are substitutable salva veritate in progressive\nconstructions. The second one, however, applies, since  \ndoes not imply that there is a house that Carlos was building. These\ntests therefore don’t provide a clear answer to the question whether\nthe progressive is an intensional construction. Even if the answer is\nyes, the progressive is certainly a different type of intensional\nconstruction than, for example, propositional attitudes like\nbelieve or doubt.  \nAn extensional alternative was developed by Parsons (1989, 1990).\nParsons, like Davidson (1967), assumes that first-order quantification\nover events is possible. But unlike Davidson, Parsons assumes\nquantification over eventualities in the sense of Bach (1986), which\nincludes events proper but also states, processes and so on. Like\nDowty, Parsons supposes that eventualities are split up into a\ndevelopment phase and a culmination phase. In order to represent this\ndifference in first-order logic two new predicates are introduced,\nCul\\((e, t)\\) and Hold\\((e,\nt)\\). The intuitive meaning of the first is that eventuality\n\\(e\\) culminates at time \\(t\\). The second one says that\n\\(e\\) is either an eventuality in its development phase or that\n\\(e\\) is a state. Given these assumptions a sentence like Mary\ndrew a circle is translated into first-order formula (27),\n\\(S\\) is again short for speech time.  \nThe semantic effect of the progressive consists in transforming events\ninto states.  \nIf ‘\\(A\\)’ is an event verb, then ‘be\n\\(A\\)-ing’ is to be treated semantically as a state verb;\notherwise, ‘be \\(A\\)-ing’ is to be treated the same as\n‘\\(A\\)’. (Parsons 1989: 222)  \nWith this assumption the logical representation of Mary was\ndrawing a circle is (28).  \nObviously (27) does not follow from (28). But (28) does imply that\nthere is a circle Mary was drawing. Of course this circle may not be\ncomplete. This means that Parson’s ontology is bound to include\nincomplete objects. For a discussion of incomplete objects see for\ninstance Baggio and van Lambalgen (2007). \nAccording to the quotation above, the progressive doesn’t change\nanything in the case of activities. Therefore Mary pushed a\ncart and Mary was pushing a cart are predicted to be\nequivalent.  \nParsons’ theory rests on the difference between the predicates\n\nCul and Hold. This difference is left to intuition.\nNo axiomatisation of these predicates is given. This is one of the\nobjections made in Zucchi (1999). Zucchi also notes that under certain\ncircumstances it is possible to derive a specific version of the\nimperfective paradox in Parsons’ theory. A careful discussion of\nDowty’ and Parsons’ approaches and a combination of the two systems is\ncontained in Landman (1992). Another approach to the imperfective paradox and - more generally -\nnon-culminating accomplishments was proposed by Copley and Harley\n(2015). They abandon event semantics and propose instead a framework\nusing situations and forces as primitives. Forces lead to transitions\nbetween situations. Their theory is motivated by the observation that\nacross languages, non-culminating accomplishments are\ncrosslinguistically in fact a very common phenomenon. Interestingly,\nthese non-culminating readings are per default conveyed by less complex\nexpressions than complete events. Often, it is the perfective and not\nthe imperfective that is marked linguistically. Prima facie, this is a\nproblem for analyses such as Dowty's which assume that the imperfective\nparadox in accomplishments hinges on an additional operator such as\nPROG. This is where Copley and Harley's causal analysis comes into\nplay. Their force-theoretic account does not run into this problem\nbecause causally efficacious forces always take effects ceteris\nparibus, for instance, an effect may not occur do to the occurence of a\ncounter force preventing the effect. They develop a compositional\nsemantic framework linking forces to the argument structure of the\nsentence. At the present stage of the theory, however, some of the\nbasic concepts also call for axiomatisation. For instance, it is\ncrucial to gain a proper understanding of what it means for a situation\nto be a ceteribus paribus successor situation for some initial\nsituation. For this purpose, their semantic framework must be connected\nto a theory of causality connecting linguistic meaning to cognition and\ncausal reasoning via a conceptual level integrating the two. We will come back to the imperfective\nparadox in\n Section 7\n where we combine linguistic theory with event theories from artificial\n intelligence. This will give us a formalization of\n ceteris paribus from which a\n new solution to the imperfective paradox will follow. Let us now show that events are also useful for a systematic\naccount of certain types of coercion that were mentioned\nabove in Section 5. Intuitively\nthere is a close link between the nominal predicates wine and a bottle\nof wine and their verbal counterparts (29-a), (29-b).  \nWhenever there are two entities to which wine applies, this\npredicate applies to their collection as well. The predicate a\nbottle of wine does not have this property. Whenever there are\ntwo different entities to which a bottle of wine applies,\nthis predicate does not apply to their collection. The first predicate\nis cumulative (see Definition 4) the second is\nquantized (see Definition 5). A similar argumentation applies\nto the difference between the activity drink wine and the\naccomplishment drink a bottle of wine. It was observed by\nmany linguists that the combination of a verb like drink with\na cumulative predicate like wine yields an atelic predicate\nlike (29-a), whereas its combination with a quantized predicate yields\na telic predicate like in (29-b). \nIn order to account for these intuitions in a precise way Krifka assumes\nthat the parts of the structure \\(\\mathcal{M} = (\\mathfrak{O},\n\\mathfrak{E}, \\mathfrak{T})\\) consisting of objects \\(\\mathfrak{O}\\),\nevents \\(\\mathfrak{E}\\) and times \\(\\mathfrak{T}\\) are each structured\nas complete join semi-lattices without a bottom element (see Grätzer,\n1978). This means that we have a two place relation \\(\\sqcup\\) (join)\nand relations \\(\\sqsubseteq\\), \\(\\sqsubset\\), and \\(\\bigcirc\\) (part,\nproper part and overlap) that impose part-whole relations (mereologies,\nsee the entry mereology)\non the sets of objects, events and times. We cannot list all the\nproperties that must hold for these structures to serve as admissible\ninterpretations of natural language but we illustrate these properties\nby giving two examples. Definition 4. Cumulative (CUM) reference:  \n\\(\\forall P (CUM(P) \\leftrightarrow \\forall x, y(P(x) \\wedge P(y) \\rightarrow P(x \\sqcup y)))\\). Definition 5. Quantized (QUA) reference:  \n\\(\\forall P(QUA(P) \\leftrightarrow \\forall x, y (P(x) \\wedge P(y) \\rightarrow \\neg y \\sqsubset x))\\). \nDefinitions 4 and 5 now allow for a formal descripion of the\nreferential difference between wine and a bottle of\nwine. For verbal predicates Krifka assumes that they are event denoting\nand moreover that thematic relations\nlike agent, theme, etc are represented as in\n(31-b). Thematic roles of verbs are crucial since they determine which\nverbs give raise to the drink wine versus drink a bottle\nof wine\n distinction.[5] It\nis now straightforward to fix the reference of the verbal predicates in\na way that exhibits their simlarity to the respective nominal\npredicates. \nCumulativity of nominal predicates corresponds to atelicity in the\nverbal domain and a quantized nominal predicate corresponds to a telic\nverbal predicate. \nThere is still something missing. How can the impact of the reference\nof the nominal predicates on the aspectual class be derived formally?\nWe will present only the basic idea of Krifka's construction here. Let\n\\(w\\) be the predicate corresponding to wine and let \\(e\\) be the event predicate representing drink wine. The basic idea is that an object is changed by the influence of  such an event in a gradual\nmanner. Since we know that \\(w\\) is cumulative this predicate also\napplies to proper parts of \\(w\\), say \\(w'\\). Then given that drink  wine\ncan be applied to \\(e\\) it should also be possible to apply it to a\nproper part of \\(e\\), say \\(e'\\). Quantized predicates show a different\nbehaviour. Since a bottle of wine is quantized no proper part of it  is a bottle of wine  and therefore no proper part of \\(e\\) can be described as drink a bottle of wine.\nTo account for this intuitive explanation in formal terms it is\nnecessary to specify certain preservation properties for thematic roles\nsince these roles relate the algebraic structure of events and the\nalgebraic structure of objects. This means that notions like summativity, uniqueness of objects etc. have to be defined for relations between events and objects; i.e. thematic roles. \nHere we will illustrate these concepts with only one example, summativity (SUM). Definition 6. \n\\(\\forall R [SUM(R) \\leftrightarrow \\forall e, e', x, x'[R(e, x)\n\\wedge R(e', x') \\rightarrow R(e\\sqcup e', x \\sqcup\nx')]]\\). \nSummativity says that the sum-operation \\(\\sqcup\\) on\nevents and objects is preserved under summative relations on events and\nobjects. For instance if we have two distinct events of drinking a bottle of wine we get an event of drinking two bottles of wine. \nWith this formal background it is now possible to state exactly when a\npredicate of events corresponding to a verb-phrase is cumulative, telic\netc.. Again we will just state one result. Let \\(\\phi = \\{ e|\\exists\nx(\\alpha(e) \\wedge \\delta(x) \\wedge \\theta(e, x))\\}\\) be such a\npredicate where \\(\\alpha\\) represents a verb - say draw - \\(\\delta\\) the nominal predicate - pictures - and \\(\\theta\\) a thematic relation - say theme.\nIt then follows that one set of conditions for \\(\\phi\\) being\ncumulative is that \\(\\delta\\) is cumulative and \\(\\theta\\) is\nsummative. An example is the verb phrase draw pictures. Similar results  characterize, iterative, telic, atelic etc. readings. \nThis concludes our glimpse of events in linguistic semantics; Readers interested in a more comprehensive treatment of this issue may find Champollion (2014, see Other Internet Resources) a useful contemporary source. We now come back to the imperfective paradox and turn to an\nevent calculus that was developed in artificial intelligence. \nIn the following section we will show that the imperfective paradox is\nan instance of the frame problem prominent in Artificial Intelligence\n(AI). To this end we will explain the event calculus, which is an\nextension of McCarthy’s situation calculus (McCarthy 1977) developed\nby Kowalski and Sergot (1986). Then we will indicate how the event\ncalculus leads to a formalization of natural language tense and aspect\nby analysing the imperfective paradox.  \nConsider narrative (33).  \nAssuming that shooting at somebody with a loaded gun will lead to the\ndeath of that person, we will interpret the discourse in a way that\nFred eventually gets killed. Arriving at this inference is, however,\nnot a trivial task. In (33) the frame problem is exemplified in the\nform of the Yale Shooting Scenario (Hanks and McDermott 1986). To\ndemonstrate this, we will start with a very simple calculus—a\nvariant of the Simple Event Calculus by Shanahan (1997) which\nonly incorporates a very basic notion of instantaneous change. Later\nwe will add axioms in order to deal with continuous change and then\nreturn to the imperfective paradox. In short, we will argue that the\nparadox can be viewed as an instance of the frame problem.  \nSuppose we have three kinds of actions/events—Load,\nSmoke and Shoot—and three time dependent\nproperties, the fluents Alive, Loaded and\n Dead.[6]\n Besides actions and fluents we will also need instants of time in our\nbasic ontology. The predicates listed in Table 4 are used to express\nactions and their effects and to locate them in time.  Table 4.\nPredicates of the simple event calculus (from Shanahan 1999) \nThe predicates are related to each other by a set of four simple\naxioms (34)–(37). In these axioms, all variables are assumed to be universally\nquantified with maximal scope. We will come to the semantics of the\nimplication when we have introduced the complete scenario.  \n The first three axioms state the conditions\nunder which a fluent can hold at a time \\(t\\): either it holds\nright from the start or it is initiated at a time \\(t_1\\)\nbefore \\(t\\) without a terminating action occurring in between the\ntwo. The fourth axiom defines the predicate Clipped\\((t_1,\nf,\nt_2)\\) saying that a fluent \\(f\\) is clipped\nbetween times \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\) if it is\nterminated by some action \\(a\\) happening between\n\\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\). Simplifying a whole\nlot, the axioms (30)–(33) formalize the notion of instantaneous\nchange, such as two balls colliding or somebody dying. Moreover, they\nembody a notion of inertia: fluents continue to hold unless\nterminated.\n\n \n\nNext, we have to translate the discourse (33) into the Simple Event\nCalculus. The first set of formulas (38)–(40) states what the\nmentioned actions do. These formulas provide a crude sketch of the\nlexical meaning of load, smoke and shoot.\nThe effect of a Load action is to make the fluent\nLoaded hold, a Shoot action makes Dead hold\n(and Alive not hold) with Loaded being a\nprecondition. Finally, Smoke is assumed to have no effects\n(thus, there are no rules involving Smoke).  \n(33) comprises a Load action followed by a Smoke\naction followed by a Shoot action. Using four arbitrarily\nchosen time points \\(T_1\\)–\\(T_4\\) the\ndiscourse can be represented as follows:  \n\nFrom this little theory we want to derive\nHoldsAt(Dead, \\(T_4)\\). Unfortunately,\nthis sequent is not valid in the classical sense of being true in all\nmodels which satisfy the theory. Think for example of a situation in\nwhich the gun obscurely becomes unloaded while Vincent is smoking. In\nsuch a model, the precondition of the shooting action is clearly not\nmet and thus the action will lack any effects. Note that nothing rules\nout such a model since it is entirely consistent with our theory. We\nthus have to further constrain the models under consideration.\nCrucially, we have to find a way to deal with the non-effects of\nactions; this is the famous frame problem.  \nHow to proceed? From the fact that no terminating action was\nmentioned, we want to conclude that no terminating event occurred. To\ndo so, we have to strengthen the assumptions of the theory in a way\nthat only those events are assumed to occur which have been explicitly\nstated in the discourse. The discourse model should be minimal,\nlinking discourse understanding intimately to closed world\nreasoning. It is important to note that this strategy forces\nreasoning to be non-monotonic: adding further premises to a theory can\nmake inferences invalid that were valid before (see the entry on \nnon-monotonic logic).  \nThere are different techniques for formalizing this line of reasoning;\none is circumscription (e.g., Shanahan 1997). Here, we will use the\ncompletion of a logic program technique, adopting the\n\nEvent Calculus of van Lambalgen and Hamm (2005). Taking a\ncloser look at the formulas of the theory\n\\(((34) \\wedge \\ldots \\wedge (45))\\), an important feature to notice is that\nformulas come in two variants: they are either facts\nconsisting of a simple predicate expression or they express\nrules with a conjunction of potentially negated formulas to\nthe left of the implication sign and a single positive atomic\nexpression to its right (in logic programming the former is called the\n\nbody and the latter is called the head of a clause).\nWe will now illustrate how the completion of a simple logic program is\ncomputed. Consider the description of a situation where the gun gets\nloaded at time 1 and a shooting event happens at time 10. This\nsituation is stated in the following program:  \nThe uncompleted program does not yet rule out intervening events. It\nis, for example, consistent with an Unload event occurring at\ntime instant 9. The completion of the program should tell us that (46)\nand (47) were the only events. The completion is computed according to\nthe following\n procedure.[7]\n We start with the facts in (46) and (47). Both of these are\nHappens formulae. The completion of the program intuitively\ncorresponds to an assertion that, given this program,\nHappens\\((e, t)\\) can only mean Load\noccurring at 1 or Shoot occurring at 10. We therefore first\nsubstitute variables for the constants and write the following\ndisjunction:  \nThen, we universally quantify over the variables \\(e\\) and \\(t\\)\nand strengthen the implication to a bi-implication:  \nFrom (49) it follows that there were no intervening events.\nStrengthening the implications to bi-implications makes it impossible\nthat a head can be true without the enabling conditions being\n met.[8]\n The uniquely determined model of (49) is the minimal model of the\nlogic program consisting of (46) and (47).  \nWe can now come back to the Yale Shooting Problem in discourse (33).\nFrom the completion of the logic program\n((34))\\(\\wedge \\ldots \\wedge\\)((45)) it follows (non-monotonically) that\nHoldsAt(Dead, \\(T_4)\\). Enriching the\nprogram with further information and computing the new completion,\nhowever, could clearly lead to cancellation of this inference.  \nIf we want to use these ideas to model natural language discourse, we\nneed to incorporate tense. In van Lambalgen and Hamm (2005) this is\ndone by adopting the classic tripartition into reference\ntime, event time and speech time due to\nReichenbach (see\n section 3).\n  \nRecall that above, when we translated discourse (33) into Shanahan’s\nEvent Calculus, we arbitrarily chose instants of time\n\\(T_1 ,\\ldots ,T_4\\) to locate actions\nin time. This is not how it is done in natural language discourse. The\nfirst sentence (Yesterday morning Vincent loaded the gun)\nstates that within some time interval \\((=\\) reference time) before now \\((=\\)\nspeech time) there was a time \\(t'\\) at which a loading event\nhappened \\((=\\) event time). The second sentence (Then he smoked a\ncigarette) is linked to this event by the connective\nthen, stating that at some later time \\(t''\\) a\nsmoking event happened with \\(t''\\) also being temporally\nlocated before now. Analogously for the third sentence: there\nis an event time \\(t'''\\) at which Shoot happens and\n\\(t'' \\lt t''' \\lt\\)\nnow. Note that when locating events in time it is\nalways done by existential statements of the form there is a\ntime. So far, however, we have only been dealing with universally\nquantified variables. Clearly, a formula like \\(\\forall t\\).Happens(Load,\n\\(t)\n\\wedge t \\lt\\) now cannot be used to represent\ntense since it would state that Load happens at all times in\nthe past. We have to find a way to introduce existentially quantified\ninformation.  \nIntuitively, it suffices to introduce new entities into the domain of\ndiscourse. This approach lies at the heart of dynamic semantic\ntheories such as Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle 1993,\nand see also the entry on\n Discourse Representation Theory)\n or File Change Semantics (Heim 1982). We will need an update\nprocedure that introduces new actions/events into the discourse model\nbut is compatible with the non-monotonic semantics introduced so far.\nFollowing van Lambalgen and Hamm (2005) we will use integrity\nconstraints—a device from database theory (for a more\ncomplete and formal treatment the reader is referred to Kowalski 1995\nand van Lambalgen and Hamm 2005: ch. 8)—to implement the notion\nof a minimal update of a discourse model. Consider discourse (50).\n \nIn interpreting the first sentence, we want to update the situation\nmodel in a way that makes the sentence true. The tense information\nwill be interpreted as a goal to minimally update the situation model\nwith a fluent Loaded that holds now. In our framework\nsemantic interpretation is thus closely linked to planning, in that\nfinding an interpretation for a sentences requires coming up with a\nsequence of actions that makes the goal succeed.  \n\nTo resolve this integrity constraint we will use the axioms of the\nSimple Event Calculus plus the world knowledge about the consequences\nof a load action stated in (52).  \n\nIn logic programming, the sort of reasoning required to resolve (51)\nis carried out by a derivation procedure called resolution.\nWe will use resolution here in a non-standard way, i.e. logic\nprogramming combined with integrity constraints (for details see van\nLambalgen and Hamm 2005). It starts with the formula that has to be\nmade true in the discourse model. Resolution proceeds by identifying\nrules which have the query as their consequent and substituting the\nconsequent with the antecedent conditions of the rule, making the\nantecedent formulas new queries themselves. The resolution stops when\nthe query cannot be further resolved, that is, when a plan has been\ncomputed whose preconditions are all fulfilled given an appropriate\nupdate of the discourse model. To get an impression of how this works\nwe will illustrate the resolution of (51). First, we have to compute\nthe completion of the program and whenever possible substitute the\nvariables with constants, in our case Loaded and\n\nnow. In logic programming this substitution is done\nautomatically via unification. Here is the completion of the\nHoldsAt predicate which forms the head of two\naxioms—(35) and (36).  \n\nSince the theory doesn’t contain the statement\nInitially(Loaded), closed world reasoning yields\nthat at time 0 the gun is not loaded\n\\((\\neg\\)Initially(Loaded)). No matter how we update\nthe discourse representation the first disjunct can never succeed. We\nthus have to move on to the second disjunct. In this case, the\ndatabase is searched for an action \\(a\\) and a time \\(s\\) such\nthat Initiates\\((a, f, s)\\),\n\nHappens\\((a, s)\\) and\n\\(\\neg\\)Clipped\\((s\\), Loaded, \\(t)\\). On the\nsole basis of the information provided in the discourse the subquery\n?Happens\\((a, s)\\) will fail, because in discourse\n(50) there is no information about a load action. However, since\nintegrity constraints are intended to be made true, the database will\nbe updated with a clause Happens(Load,\n\\(s) \\wedge s \\lt\\)\n\nnow which makes the second disjunct true and the query\nsucceed.  \nIn the following, we will analyze the imperfective paradox as an\ninstance of the frame problem (cf. Stenning and van Lambalgen 2005;\nvan Lambalgen and Hamm 2005; Stenning and van Lambalgen 2008; Baggio\nand van Lambalgen 2007; Baggio et al. 2008). Both activities and\naccomplishments involve continuous change and we therefore have to add\nadditional predicates and axioms to properly deal with gradually\nchanging objects which are under the influence of an external force.\nTable 5 introduces two new predicates; axioms A1–A5 provide a\ngeneral theory of instantaneous and continuous change (from van\nLambalgen and Hamm 2005: 40). As can be easily seen, the axiom system\nextends that of Shanahan (1997).  Table 5.\n\nPredicates for continuous change \nAxioms 4 and 5 define continuous change. Axiom 4 defines the\nTrajectory predicate. To see what it says, let’s consider a\nsituation of running a mile where \\(f_1\\) is\ninstantiated by running and \\(f_2\\) by\ndistance\\((x)\\). Should running be true during\nthe whole interval from \\(t\\) until \\(t'\\) then distance\\((a + 1)\\) will be true\nat \\(t'\\). The value of \\(x\\), that is, the actual\ndistance actually run at each time instant will be determined by the\nlaw of the process under consideration (here, running speed). Axiom 5\ndefines the predicate Clipped\\((t,\nf, t')\\)\nwhich is true if \\(f\\) is terminated or released by an event\n\\(e\\) which happens in the time interval between \\(t\\) and\n\\(t'\\). Thus Clipped covers both instantaneous and\ncontinuous change. The axioms provide a general theory of what can\nchange and what stays constant. \nFor concrete situations, we also need the specific temporal and causal\nrelationships. This kind of information is specified in so called\nscenarios representing lexical meaning. The lexical meaning\nof the accomplishment run a mile corresponds to scenario\n(54). Like the axioms, the scenario takes the form of a logic program.\nAll variables are universally quantified.  \nScenarios formalize the event nucleus of Moens and Steedman (1988).\nEvery accomplishment takes the same form of scenario, the only\ndifferences being that the individual scenarios involve different\npreparatory processes (run, build, etc.), incremental\nthemes (distance\\((x)\\), house\\((x)\\), etc.)\nand resultant states. Furthermore, it is obvious that the preparatory\nprocess run, an activity, is a proper part of scenario (54).\nThe simpler activity scenario can be easily arrived at if we remove\nclauses (d)–(f) from (54). We are now in the position to solve\nthe imperfective paradox avoiding the problems discussed in\n section 6.\n Both a past progressive activity sentence as in (55a) and a past\nprogressive accomplishment sentence (55b) will trigger a discourse\nupdate as stated in integrity constraint (55c).  \nThe discourse update of the completed program (54) yields that at some\npoint after \\(t\\) John will achieve the culmination and will have\nrun one mile (see van Lambalgen and Hamm 2005: 61ff. for a proof).\nObviously, the same integrity constraint in combination with the\nactivity in (55a) only licenses the inferences that there was some\npast running activity. In the case of an accomplishment the course of\nevents dramatically changes if we add information to the\nrepresentation as in (56b). Now, both (56a) and (56b) only allow the\ninference that there was a running event but, arguably, John didn’t\nreach his goal in (56b). Without going into further details it should\nbe clear how this non-monotonic inference works. The derivation works\nanalogously to the simpler instances of the frame problem discussed\nabove.  \nThe solution to the imperfective paradox just outlined makes reference\nto the intentions of the agent involved in the event; therefore the\nnotion of a goal or intention is built into the system right from the\nstart. Note, however, it does not involve possible worlds, or\nprimitive notions like inertia worlds; instead it is based upon\nminimal models and non-monotonic reasoning. This yields additional\nbenefits. Firstly, the Event Calculus will compute a minimal model in\ncases where an integrity constraint can be satisfied. Moreover, the\nnumber of construction steps required for this yields a precise\ncomplexity measure which (for example) allows us to derive predictions\nfor cognitive processing. Secondly, the non-monotonic nature of the\nEvent Calculus can be used to model the incremental construction of a\ntemporal model with inferences which hold locally at a discourse\nsegment \\(s_n\\) but which can be undone at some\nlater discourse unit \\(s_{n+1}\\). This is a\nnecessary prerequisite if we think of interpreting sentences like\n(56b) from left to right assuming incremental interpretation (see\ne.g., Baggio and van Lambalgen 2007 and Bott 2010 for implementations\nof the Event Calculus as a processing model). In the next section we\nwill review psychological and psycholinguistic work on the\ninterpretation of aspect which will provide empirical motivation for\nthe outlined analysis.  \nDue to limitations of space, we will not discuss psychological and\npsycholinguistic studies of tense but will focus solely on processing\nstudies of aspect. Moreover, within this topic we limit ourselves to\nstudies of the adult system. The interested reader is referred to\nDickey (2001) and the references therein for psycholinguistic work on\ntense as well as to the entry on\n the experience and perception of time\n\n and the contributions in Grondin (2008) for psychology of time in\ngeneral.  \nPsychologists have recently begun studying event perception and its\nneural basis (e.g., Zacks and Tversky 2001; Zacks, Tversky, and Iyer\n2001; Zacks et al. 2006). The underlying question behind this line of\nresearch is whether events play a role in how we cognitively structure\nand remember changing states of affairs and how they are represented.\nZacks, Tversky, and Iyer (2001) use an analogy from the domain of\nobjects to the domain of events to define an event as a “segment\nin time at a given location that is conceived by an observer to have a\nbeginning and an end” (p.30). They claim that “the ability\nto identify the parts of events and their relationships constitutes a\ndistinct perceptual process” (p.30) which they call event\nstructure perception. Just as an object is an ontological\nprimitive in the spatial domain, so an event is an ontological\nprimitive in the spatio-temporal\n domain.[9]\n Objects are recognized by shape, color etc. and have boundaries in\nspace. Analogously, events have boundaries in time, but are also\nbounded in space. An event of buttering toast, for instance, happens\nat a particular time, but also in a particular location in space and\nis therefore spatially bounded. Continuing the analogy, both objects\nand events can be identified and categorized using hierarchical\nrelations.  \n\nIn Zacks, Tversky, and Iyer’s experiments, participants segmented an\nongoing activity (like washing dishes) while watching it on\nfilm by pressing a key to mark “natural and meaningful”\nunit boundaries. The grain at which participants segmented the\nactivity was manipulated between subjects: one group was asked to mark\nthe largest meaningful units (coarse grain size), the other group the\nsmallest units (fine grain size) which still could be considered to be\ncomplete events. The placement of perceived event boundaries provides\ninformation about the psychological status of events and their\npartonomic hierarchy. If the stream of action is perceived as\nconsisting of discrete events, participants should place event\nboundaries consistently and this is what Zacks, Tversky, and Iyer\n(2001) found. Further, if participants make use of partonomic\nhierarchies, coarse event boundaries should be aligned with fine\nboundaries, since the end of each superordinate event is also the end\nof its last subevent. Again, this hypothesis was corroborated by a\nstrong hierarchical bias effect. Events thus seem to be\npsychologically real and to be hierarchically structured.  \nDuring the last decade psycholinguists have started to investigate the\ncognitive reality of lexical aspect and how it is processed. The\nexisting studies can be sub-classified into studies concerning\nAktionsart simpliciter and those concerned with shifts from\none aspectual class to an other, i.e., aspectual coercion. In\nthe following, we will provide a brief overview of both areas of\nresearch.  \nMcKoon and Macfarland (2002) were among the first to study processing\nconsequences of decompositional analyses along the lines of Dowty\n(1979). They provided evidence from reading times and lexical decision\ntimes that accomplishments \\((\\alpha\\) CAUSE \\(x\\) BECOME IN-STATE)\nare inherently more complex than achievements \\((x\\) BECOME\nIN-STATE). Similarly, Gennari and Poeppel (2003) compared eventive\npredicates (which included accomplishments, achievements and\nactivities) to statives and found that the former were more complex to\nprocess than the latter. Brennan and Pylkkänen (2010) extended\nthis line of research to psychological verbs and compared\naccomplishments (e.g., scare) with statives (e.g.,\n\ncherish) using reading time methods and\nmagnetoencephalography (MEG). They also included a comparison of the\nsimple psychological statives with modified sentences that required\ncoercion (e.g., within half an hour, the child cherished the\nprecious kitten). Reading times and MEG data indicated that\naccomplishments were more complex to comprehend than statives and,\nmoreover, that the enhanced semantic complexity led to different MEG\ncomponents than aspectual coercion. Finally, Coll-Florit and Gennari\n(2011) compared durative states and punctual event predicates (mostly\nachievements) and observed longer reading times of statives than of\nevent predicates. They attributed this effect—which runs counter\nto what would be expected under a decomposition analysis—to the\nfact that durative situations occur in semantically more diverse\ncontexts and elicit more diverse associations than event predicates\nwhich may modulate the required processing effort. Taken together, the\nexisting studies provide evidence for complexity differences between\nthe aspectual classes, lending support to decompositional analyses.\nHowever, not all issues are entirely solved yet and further research\nis required.  \nThe second line of research concerns aspectual coercion. Here, the\nmain research question has been whether aspectual coercion is a costly\noperation. Existing research has almost exclusively focused on one\ncoercion type, i.e., coercion of point action verbs into an iterative\ninterpretation (but see Brennan and Pylkkänen 2010 and Bott 2010\nfor exceptions). Again, the findings are mixed. Early studies have\nprovided evidence for coercion costs employing secondary tasks such as\ncross-modal lexical decision or stop making sense\njudgments (Piñango, Zurif, and Jackendoff 1999; Todorova\net al. 2000). Pickering et al. (2006) used the same materials as in\nthe experiments mentioned above, but tested a coerced meaning during\nordinary reading without an additional task. In two self-paced reading\nand two eyetracking experiments, they found aspectual coercion to be\nno more difficult than their aspectual control conditions. This lack\nof effect let them propose the aspectual underspecification\nhypothesis, stating that the aspectual representation stays\nunderspecified during normal reading. Brennan and Pylkkänen\n(2008) challenged this view and reported a coercion effect of coercion\nsentences like (57a) as compared to aspectual controls (57b) both in\nself-paced reading and in MEG; on the basis of a rating study they had\ncarefully selected clear instances of point action verbs. Their MEG\nstudy revealed activation in the anterior midline field, a MEG\ncomponent that has been observed for other non-aspectual cases of\ncoercion, too.  \nComplicating matters, Bott (2008, 2010) applied the same norming\nprocedures, but did not find evidence of coercion cost in iterative\npoint action verbs in German. With other types of aspectual coercion,\nhowever, there were clear indications of processing difficulty\nindicating that the underlying processes differ between coercion\ntypes. Furthermore, the study provided evidence that at least in some\ncases (achievement ⇝ accomplishment) coercion operations are not\ntriggered by an aspectual mismatch, but can proceed smoothly by\nenriching the aspectual representation with additional eventualities.\nThis was shown in an event-related potentials (ERP) study in which a\ndouble dissociation of ERP components was elicited by sentences with\naspectual coercion as compared to sentences that contained an\naspectual mismatch. \nGrammatical aspect has recently received increased interest in\npsycholinguistics (for a comprehensive review see Madden and Ferretti\n2009). One line of studies has investigated (e.g., Ferretti\net al. 2007) the accessibility of event participants in English\nprogressive and simple sentences. They provide evidence that, in line\nwith the linguistic description provided above, the progressive\npresents an event from the inside, making participants, instruments\nand places fully accessible, whereas the simple forms present events\nas complete units and the event participants are less accessible.\nUsing picture selection/verification, Madden and Zwaan (2003) found\nthat participants were faster and more likely to choose a picture\nshowing a complete event, rather than a picture depicting an ongoing\nevent, after they had read a sentence with an accomplishment verb in\nthe simple past. This indicates that English speakers encode\naccomplishments in the simple past as complete events. This finding\nwas supported by a study by Anderson et al. (2008). They compared\naccomplishments describing a path such as Tom jogged/was jogging\nto the woods and then stretched when he got there. Participants\nlistened to these sentences while using a computer mouse to drag and\ndrop a human character in a visual scene. When hearing a sentence in\nthe past progressive, many drops took place at the beginning and the\ncenter of the path, whereas in the simple past most drops were at the\nend of the path. Interestingly, the differences were by no means\ncategorical. Even in the simple past condition, the character was in\nsome trials positioned well before the end of the path. This indicates\nthat accomplishments in the simple past are consistent with incomplete\nevents.  \nAnother study relevant for the discussion in the previous sections is\nan ERP study on the imperfective paradox by Baggio et al. (2008). They\ninvestigated the processing of Dutch imperfective sentences such as\nhet meisje was een brief aan het schrijven (the girl was\nwriting a letter) which were either followed by a\n\nwhen-clause that made the culmination unlikely (when her\nfriend spilled coffee on the paper) or by a sentence which was\ncompatible with the attainment of the goal (when her friend spilled\ncoffee on the tablecloth). The first kind of sentences elicited larger\nsustained anterior negativities compared to sentences that were\ncompatible with the culmination. Moreover, the amplitude of the\nnegativity was correlated with the frequency with which participants\nresponded that the culmination was not reached. These findings\nindicate that a progressive sentence triggers a default inference to a\ncomplete event which can be canceled again, if the context so\nrequires.  \nGrammatical aspect is subject to clear crosslinguistic differences.\nThis raises the question of whether the grammatical system has an\ninfluence on how we process language. In von Stutterheim et al. (2009)\nthe authors reported findings of a production study comparing event\ndescriptions of English, German and Dutch speakers that were elicited\nwhile they were watching and describing a silent video clip. Their\nstudy revealed clear differences between productions from the three\nlanguages. English speakers used the progressive to start event\ndescriptions well before the endpoint was visible (e.g., A car is\ngoing down a lane … to a farmhouse). Germans showed a\ndifferent behavior, relating their descriptions to the endpoint of a\nmotion event. It thus seems as if production is constrained by the\nlanguage in which it is realized. Recently, von Stutterheim et al.\n(2012) extended this line of research to a sample of seven languages\nand showed that the aspectual properties of a language influence how\nspeakers conceptualize events. It’s not only that speakers of\ndifferent languages talked differently about motion events (e.g.,\nmention of endpoints), their language also had a clear influence on\ntheir viewing behavior while watching the movies and influenced their\nmemory capacity for those parts of the scene corresponding to\nendpoints.  As for comprehension, Bott and Hamm (2014)\ninvestigated how the aspectual system of a language influences\nprocessing difficulty. They compared coercion of German and English\naccomplishments which were modified by for \\(x\\) time\nadverbials. (58) is a sample item.  \nIn the German experiments, condition (58a) was read as fast as a\nnon-coercing control condition with an in x time adverbial.\nThis was different in English where the authors found coercion to\ncause a substantial slowdown of reading speed. They interpret this\ncrosslinguistic difference as follows: languages which have the\ngrammatical means to express an aspectual difference via alternative\nforms—the progressive vs. simple forms in English—enforce\nimmediate aspectual commitment, whereas languages that lack this\ngrammatical feature have to leave it underspecified. In other words,\nGerman readers will leave it to the context whether an accomplishment\nexpresses a complete or incomplete event, whereas English readers\nimmediately strengthen an accomplishment in the simple form into a\ncomplete event interpretation. They take this strengthening to be a\npragmatic process that is due to competition between alternative\ngrammatical forms. In an eyetracking during reading study, Bott and Gattnar (2015)\nfollowed up on the observed cross-linguistic variation in the\nprocessing of grammatical aspect comparing an aspect language, Russian,\nwith the non-aspect language German. They investigated whether the\ndifferences in the aspectual systems of the two languages affected the\ntime course of mismatch detection in the case of lexical aspectual\nmismatch.All test sentences contained clear instances of (in Russian always perfective) transitive achievement verbs such as  win, find, reach, notice, etc. which were modified by a semantically mismatching for-adverbial (e.g., for three hours) or a semantically fitting ago-adverbial (e.g., three hours ago)\nin aspectual control conditions. Crucially, both Russian and German\nhave relatively free word order making it possible to test for effects\nof mismatching vs. matchingadverbials in the word order  subject verb object adverbial but also in the order adverbial verb subject object. The results show that Russian readers immediately detect the aspectual  mismatch\nirrespective of whether they have seen the subject or the object\nargument yet. This is different in German where aspectual mismatch\ndetection only started after the verb plus all its obligary arguments\nhad been encountered. This result was modeled by Bott and Sternefeld\n(2017) in an incremental event semantics drawing on insights from\nmereological semantics as proposed by Krifka (1989, 1992); see\n also\n section 6.1 (and the entry\n mereology).\nThe incremental semantic derivations show that in a non-aspect language\nlike German, lexical aspect really is a property of whole sentences and\nstrongly depends on the compositional interpretation of the verb, its\narguments, and their thematic roles. In an aspect language like\nRussian, on the other hand, the grammatical aspect imposes itself\nstrong constraints on lexical aspectual interpretation. These\npsycholinguistic results thus nicely fit semantic proposals for\ngrammatical aspect that have been proposed in the framework of\nmereological semantics (see, e.g., Filip 2008, a.o.). \nTo summarize, the existing studies lend empirical support to the\naspectual distinctions made in the semantic and philosophic\nliterature. Moreover, the grammatical system of a language influences\nthe way language is processed and may even influence the way we\nexperience the world.  \nWe introduced and discussed several important semantic, philosophical\nand technical concepts and theories of temporality and at least\nindicated how these concepts and theories are related to cognition.\nHowever, we did this exclusively from a sentence internal perspective.\nTense and aspect are important means for organizing discourse as\n well.[10]\n To conclude our overview, we present French examples due to Kamp and\nRohrer (see van Lambalgen and Hamm 2005, ch. 9) and indicate the role\ntense and aspect play in discourse organization. Consider sentence\n(59) in which the passé simple (PS) occurs four times.\n\n \nFirst the PS in (59) provides temporal information; all events are\nlocated in the past. But the PS conveys aspectual information too. It\nsays that the internal constitution of the events is not important and\nthis means that PS expresses perfectivity. PS imposes a view of the\nevents “from the outside”. This is then taken to explain\nwhy multiple uses of the PS imply a succession of the events described\nas witnessed in example (59). This means that Pierre getting up\nprecedes his going up to his room and this event precedes closing the\ndoor which finally precedes turning the radio on. Thus, the PS\nstructures the above little discourse in a particular way. Early\ndiscourse representation theory explains this effect by assuming that\nthe PS introduces a new reference point after a previously introduced\none. \nThe discourse function of the French imparfait is different. Example\n(60a) shows that, like the past in English, the\n imparfait[11]\n is not felicitous when uttered out of the blue.  \nKamp explains these facts in the following way. The imparfait does not\nintroduce its own reference time and in (60a) there is no previous\nreference point given. Therefore (60a) is out. In (60b) the sentence\nin the passé simple Jean ôta sa veste introduces\na reference time that can be used to anchor If faisait chaud.\nThe imperfective aspect of the imparfait is then explained by the fact\nthat the PS event happens while the sentence in the imparfait holds.\nThus passé simple and imparfait not only provide temporal\ninformation but they also serve as means to structure discourse in\ndifferent ways. \nOf course these brief remarks about the discourse function of tense\nand aspect barely touch the tip of the iceberg. For more information\non the discourse semantics of French tense and discourse organization\nin general, the reader is advised to consult de Swart and Corblin\n(2002), Asher and Lascarides (2003) and van Lambalgen and Hamm (2005,\nespecially chapter 9). This short note on discourse structure\ncompletes our article on tense and aspect. ","contact.mail":"oliver.bott@uni-tuebingen.de","contact.domain":"uni-tuebingen.de"}]
