A. Fisher, S. Wright, and J. B. S.\nHaldane and the conceptual works and influential writings of  J.\nHuxley, T. Dobzhansky, and H.J. Muller. This field attempts to account\nfor evolution in terms of changes in gene and genotype frequencies\nwithin populations and the processes that convert the variation with\npopulations into more or less permanent variation between species. In\nthis view, four evolutionary forces (mutation, random genetic drift,\nnatural selection, and gene flow) acting within and among populations\ncause micro-evolutionary change and these processes are sufficient to\naccount for macro-evolutionary patterns, which arise in the longer\nterm from the collective action of these forces. That is, given very\nlong periods of time, the micro-evolutionary forces will eventually\ngive rise to the macro-evolutionary patterns that characterize the\nhigher taxonomic groups. Thus, the central challenge of Evolutionary\nGenetics is to describe how the evolutionary forces shape the patterns\nof biodiversity observed in nature.\n\n\n\n\nThe force of mutation is the ultimate source of new genetic variation\nwithin populations. Although most mutations are neutral with no effect\non fitness or harmful, some mutations have a small, positive effect on\nfitness and these variants are the raw materials for gradualistic\nadaptive evolution. Within finite populations, random genetic drift\nand natural selection affect the mutational variation.  Natural\nselection is the only evolutionary force which can produce adaptation,\nthe fit between organism and environment, or conserve genetic states\nover very long periods of time in the face of the dispersive forces of\nmutation and drift. The force of migration or gene flow has effects on\ngenetic variation that are the opposite of those caused by random\ngenetic drift. Migration limits the genetic divergence of populations\nand so impedes the process of speciation. The effect of each of these\nevolutionary forces on genetic variation within and among populations\nhas been developed in great detail in the mathematical theory of\npopulation genetics founded on the seminal works of Fisher, Wright,\nand Haldane.\n\n\n\nAmong the evolutionary forces, natural selection has long been\nprivileged in evolutionary studies because of its crucial role in\nadaptation. Ecological genetics is the study of\nevolutionary processes, especially adaptation by natural selection, in\nan ecological context in order to account for phenotypic patterns\nobserved in nature. Where population genetics tends toward a branch of\napplied mathematics founded on Mendelian axioms, often with minimal\ncontact with data, ecological genetics is grounded in the reciprocal\ninteraction between mathematical theory and empirical observations from\nfield and laboratory.\n\n\n\nIn this entry, I will review the history of evolutionary and\necological genetic of research, with the emphasis on the latter. Most\ninvestigations have focused on two of the most prominent patterns in\nnature: (1) adaptation, or the ‘fit’ between organism and\nenvironment; or, (2) polymorphism, the maintenance of two or more\nphenotypic or genetic forms in a single population. The earliest\nstudies attempted to document the action of natural selection in wild\npopulations in support of Darwin. While natural selection is the only\nevolutionary force that can account for adaptation, several\nevolutionary forces, acting alone or in combination, can sustain a\npolymorphism, at least transiently. Thus, assigning causal agency is a\nmuch more difficult problem for explanations of polymorphism than it is\nfor adaptation. Conspicuous phenotypic polymorphisms, such as the\nspotting patterns on butterfly wings or banding patterns of snail\nshells, were the material of the earliest investigations of natural\npopulations. In these studies, natural selection was\n‘privileged’ among the four evolutionary that change gene\nfrequencies as an explanation for the maintenance of\npolymorphisms. I will show that the continuing emphasis on\ndetecting natural selection is, at least in part, historical with its\nroots in the works of its founder, E. B. Ford, and his collaborators,\nnotably R. A. Fisher (cf., Ford 1975). In the beginning period\n(1928-1950), much of the problem of assigning causal agency to the\nmaintenance of genetic polymorphism was resolved by definition rather\nthan by empirical observation (see below:\n Classical Ecological Genetics and Polymorphism).\n In the later period (1966-present), molecular ecological genetics\nattempts to investigate a less biased sample of genetic polymorphisms,\nsuch as allozymes and single nucleotide polymorphisms, but still\nretains the early emphasis on natural selection as the single most\nimportant evolutionary force shaping the hereditary material. \n\nEcological genetics began at a time when the major theoretical aspects\nof the Modern Synthesis were in place, when the marvels of adaptation\nwere clear, but when few empirical examples of natural selection in\naction were available. Adaptive perfection by Fisherian gradualism\nrequires long periods of time wherein “… a very slight\nselective effect acting for a correspondingly long time will be\nequivalent to a much greater effect acting for a proportionately\nshorter time” (R. A. Fisher 1921, in correspondence with\nS. Wright, quoted in Provine [1986], p. 247). Very weak natural\nselection, however, is an impediment to the goal of ecological\ngenetics to illuminate natural selection in action. Thus, the shift in\nfocus to understanding the role of strong natural selection in\nmaintaining genetic polymorphism is understandable. As put by its\nfounder, E. B. Ford (1975, p.3), “It [ecological genetics]\nsupplies the means, and the only direct means, of investigating the\nactual process of evolution taking place in the present\ntime.” \n\nThe focus of traditional ecological genetic research on the current\naction of natural selection has been broadened in several ways over\nthe past twenty-five years. First, whereas the early studies tended to\nfocus on evolution in single populations, there is now a significant\nemphasis in ecological genetics on the population genetic structure of\nmetapopulations and the roles of migration, extinction, and\ncolonization on evolutionary and adaptive processes. Secondly, whereas\nthe earliest studies emphasized chromosomes and their influence, the\nadvent of biochemical genetics in the late 1960s significantly\nbroadened the phenotype, beginning with the application of\nelectrophoretic methods to population studies. These studies revealed\nabundant ‘hidden polymorphism’ in the new, biochemical\nphenotype of enzyme mobility. These methods extended the domain of\necological genetics from the classic ‘conspicuous phenotypic\npolymorphisms’ in color, shape and behavior to the physiological\ndomain of enzyme function. The new emphasis on biochemical phenotype,\nhowever, did not change the explanatory or causal framework of the\nfield. Determining the role of natural selection in maintaining enzyme\npolymorphisms, such as the fast/slow polymorphisms of alcohol\ndehydrogenase (which detoxifies environmental alcohol), superoxide\ndismutase (which catalyzes the removal of free oxygen radicals), or the\nesterases (which are involved in the detoxification of pesticides by\nmany insects), became a primary focus of investigation with the goal\nof finding a selective basis for the enzyme variants in terms of\ndifferences in their physical and kinetic properties.  Indeed, the\nroots of controversy between the selectionist and neutralist schools\nover the maintenance of ‘balanced’ polymorphisms\n(cf. Lewontin 1974) lie in the controversy over random genetic drift\nversus natural selection in early ecological genetic research (see\nbelow). Thirdly, the more recent advent of DNA sequencing initiated\nthe growth of molecular phylogenetics and added not only a new\nphenotype, but also a more pronounced historical dimension to\necological genetic research.  Molecular phylogenics and comparative\nsequence analysis have become the primary modern tools for the\ninvestigation of the evolutionary patterns and processes that shape\nDNA sequences. These methods have strengthened inferences regarding\nbiogeography, speciation, and adaptation, especially in regard to the\ndiversification of taxonomic lineages that attends ecological release\nand adaptive radiations. They have shifted the focus from polymorphism\nwithin species to diversification among clades and permitted the\ninvestigation of the history of individual genes. Two new patterns in\nparticular have been recognized by these DNA-based methods. The first\nis the preponderance of ‘purifying selection’, wherein the\nconservative power of natural selection is seen as a barrier to\ndiversity. It is this conservative aspect of natural selection acting\nat the molecular level that lends power to the investigation of the\ngenetic architecture of model organisms vis a vis human genetics. The\nsecond pattern is the discovery of the existence of ancient\npolymorphisms, molecular genetic variation whose duration may be\ngreater than that of the species or taxon in which it was\ndiscovered. Natural selection, however, still remains the privileged\nexplanatory force in modern sequence studies.  Indeed, the search for\nand documentation of uniquely molecular patterns, such as codon bias\nand selective sweeps, has, if anything, elevated the focal explanatory\npower of natural selection in evolutionary studies. \n\nIn this entry, I will first review classical ecological genetics and\nthen discuss the novel kinds of processes and explanations that\naccompanied the expansion of the field from single populations to\ngenetically structured metapopulations and from phenotypic to\nbiochemical and DNA sequence polymorphisms. I will show that the\ncentral early controversy over the roles of random genetic drift and\nnatural selection in evolution has continued to this day, not\nwithstanding the apparent technological refinements afforded by the\navailability of biochemical and DNA sequence data. That is, finer scale\nor more reductionistic genetic data has not yet led to a resolution of\nthe original conceptual issues that lie at the foundation of ecological\ngenetics. \n\nHistorically, the starting point of ecological genetic research has\nbeen the discovery of variation within a natural population, i.e., a\nphenotypic polymorphism. The subsequent goal is three-fold: (1)\ndetermination of whether or not the polymorphism has a genetic\ncomponent; (2) determination of the frequency of each of the\npolymorphic types; and, (3) determination of how natural selection\nmaintains the polymorphism, either alone or in combination with other\nevolutionary forces. Ford (1975 p. 109; and see also Ford 1940) defines\ngenetic polymorphism as “…the occurrence\ntogether in the same locality of two or more discontinuous forms of a\nspecies in such proportions that the rarest of them cannot be\nmaintained merely by recurrent mutation”. Although recurrent\nmutation in conjunction with mutation can maintain a polymorphism\nindefinitely at mutation-selection balance, here Ford is clearly\ninterested in a more active role for natural selection in the\nmaintenance of polymorphism. The first task was facilitated by early\ndevelopments in population genetic theory, particularly the findings of\nFisher (1930), which Ford interpreted to mean that naturally occurring,\ndiscontinuous phenotypic variation is “nearly always\ngenetic”. The reasoning stems from the theoretical findings that,\nin large populations, it is unlikely that the positive and negative\neffects of an allele (or chromosomal inversion) on fitness will be\nexactly balanced and that the number of individuals with a rare neutral\nmutation is proportional to the number of generations since its origin.\nFurthermore, if truly neutral, such alleles would spread so slowly\nthrough a large population by random genetic drift that the\n‘delicate equipoise required for their neutrality will have been\nupset by changes in the environment and in the genetic outfit of the\norganism’ (Ford 1975, p. 110) before a neutral allele reached\nappreciable frequency. In addition, recurrent mutation as a cause of\npersistent polymorphism was considered most unlikely and, in fact, this\nevolutionary cause is explicitly excluded from the definition of\ngenetic polymorphism by Ford (see above). Hence, neutral genetic\npolymorphism was considered an exceptionally rare event by the founders\nof ecological genetics and, consequently, such polymorphisms were the\nhallmark of strong, active natural selection. \n\nFord (1940) further distinguished two types of selective\npolymorphism, transient polymorphism and balanced\npolymorphism.Transient polymorphism, caused by a new\nfavorable mutation in the process of displacing its ancestral allele,\nwas considered unlikely, because “…advantageous genes will\nusually have been already incorporated into the genetic constitution of\nthe species” (Ford 1975, p. 110). This and statements like it\nreflect the viewpoint that organisms in nature are exquisitely adapted\nto their environments by the long-acting process of Fisherian\ngradualism. It is a prelude to the more explicitly adaptationist views\nfound in the current behavioral literature (see review in Shuster and\nWade 2003). This view of the evolutionary process as primarily one of\nrefinement of existing organismal adaptation is an essential part of\nthe Fisherian theory of evolutionary genetics (Wade and Goodnight\n1998). \n\nThe presumptions of a genetic basis for discontinuous phenotypic\npolymorphism and its maintenance by natural selection are clear from\nthe writings of Ford cited above but these principles also can be\nfound together in a single statement: “In view of these\nconsiderations it is clear that if any unifactorial character is at\nall widespread it must be of some [adaptive] value. Indeed, it is\nprobably true that even if it occurs at as low a frequency as 1 per\ncent, it must have been favored by selection” (Ford 1975,\np. 110). Thus, the primary goal of the ecological geneticist is to\ndiscern exactly how natural selection is acting to maintain a\nbalanced polymorphism by the relative strength of opposing\nfitness effects acting on the different sexes or at different stages\nin the life history of the organism. \n\nThe existence of males and females was discussed by Ford as a prime\nexample of a balanced polymorphism because, “It is obvious that\nany tendency for the males to increase at the expense of the females,\nor the reverse, would be opposed by selection” (Ford 1975, p.\n111). Fisher (1930) first argued that, because every individual has a\nmother and a father, the mean fitness of males must be equal to the\nmean fitness of females multiplied by the sex ratio, expressed as the\nnumber of females to males (i.e., the mean number of mates per male;\nsee also Shuster and Wade 2003, Chapter 1). As a result fitness\nincreases with rarity, and, in this circumstance, whenever the\npopulation sex ratio deviates from unity, a gene that increases the\nnumbers of the minority sex at birth will have a selective advantage.\nThus, a sex ratio of unity is a stable, balanced polymorphism, achieved\nin many species by chromosomal determination of sex, which Ford\nreferred to as a “‘built-in’ genetic\nswitch-mechanism”, characteristic of other genetic polymorphisms,\nlike Batesian mimicry. In general, the fitnesses of the different types\nconstituting a phenotypic polymorphism must be equal to be maintained\nwithin a population by natural selection at a non-zero equilibrium\nfrequency (a point recognized by Darwin 1874, p. 275). However, the\nbalance of selective forces for non-sex related (or even sex-linked)\npolymorphisms is very different from that required to maintain an equal\nsex ratio, namely, the necessity that each offspring inherit equally\nfrom each sex parent. Using the existence of the separate sexes as an\nexample of a balanced polymorphism is misleading or, at least\nunrepresentative, of the selective forces necessary to sustain balanced\npolymorphisms in general. \n\nThe founding ecological geneticists dismissed any significant role\nfor random genetic drift in evolution. The theoretical interaction of\nrandom genetic drift and natural selection for single genes with\nconstant effects can be seen in Figure 1. Fisher in his evolutionary\ntheory assumed that natural populations achieved or sustained the very\nlarge sizes as seen in his in correspondence with S. Wright (cited in\nProvine 1971) where he stated that “I believe N must usually be\nthe total population on the planet, enumerated at sexual\nmaturity”. Similarly, according to his intellectual\nbiographer W. Ewens (2000, p. 33): “Fisher never paid much\nattention to the concept [effective population size] as he should have\n… and used extremely high population sizes (up to\n1012) in his analyses, surely far too large in\ngeneral.” For such extremely large population sizes, the\nthreshold between selection and drift (see Fig. 1), which is determined\nby the effective population size,\nNe, is much lower. As a\nresult, the strength of random genetic drift, which is proportional to\n(1/2Ne), is very, very weak and\neven genes with very small values of s have\ntheir evolutionary fate determined entirely by selection. This is the\nessence of “Fisherian gradualism” — very\nsmall selective forces given sufficient time can have effects on\nadaptation similar to those of genes with much larger effects acting\nover a shorter time period. With very large\nNe, the domain of random genetic\ndrift is greatly restricted even as that of natural selection is\nexpanded (see Fig. 1). \n\nHowever, ecological geneticists did not dismiss random\ngenetic drift as a significant evolutionary force for the same reasons\nthat Fisher did. Field observations conducted with the\nmark-recapture methods developed by ecological geneticists documented\ngeneration-to-generation fluctuations in population size up to or\nexceeding an order of magnitude in most natural populations studied\nlong term. Thus, small local population sizes were not seen as unusual\nby ecological geneticists. Indeed, Ford believed that “…\norganisms automatically generate their own cycles of abundance and\nrarity and that the changes in selection pressure with which these are\nassociated many greatly increase the speed of evolution” (Ford\n1975, p. 36). Despite the not infrequent occurrence of small\npopulation sizes where drift would be expected to be most efficacious,\nrandom genetic drift was considered an irrelevant evolutionary force in\necological genetics because natural selection was viewed as being\nparticularly strong during periods of population decline. The smallest\npopulations showed little phenotypic variation, which was seen as\nevidence that they were the most fit or most finely adapted\npopulations. The stressful environmental conditions responsible for the\ndecline in numbers also were seen as causing particularly strong\nnatural selection. Thus, the lack of phenotypic variation in small\npopulations was owing to it having been eliminated by natural selection\nduring the immediately prior period of decline. Conversely, under\nperiods of population increase, natural selection was seen as weaker\nand more permissive of variation. This concept of relaxed selection\nprovided Ford with a cause for the increase in observations of rare\nphenotypic variants in large and growing natural populations. If\nselection pressure increases inversely to population size, then the\nrole of random genetic drift in evolution must be greatly\nrestricted. \n\nIn addition, Ford (1975, p. 38) considered that ecological genetic\nresearch had clearly demonstrated that the selective advantage of a\ngene in nature ‘… quite commonly exceeds 25 per cent and\nis frequently far more …” Referring to Figure 1, this\nmeans that the range for values of s in\nnatural populations lies significantly above 0.01, placing genes in\nvery small populations firmly in the domain governed by natural\nselection. \n\nFurthermore, Ford considered that not only the strength but also the\nnature of selective pressures must frequently change with density\nbecause “… an organism has not the same adaptive\nrequirements when abundant as when rare, or when the plant and animal\nforms which impinge on it are so” (Ford 1975, p. 39). Indeed, he\nthought that the fluctuating selection pressure caused by variations in\nabundance ‘invalidates’ Wright's Shifting Balance Theory of\nEvolution, which he referred to as ‘far-fetched’.\nInterestingly, Ford and his colleagues believed that genetic\nsubdivision of the sort postulated by Wright would promote rapid\nevolution but for very different genetic reasons and by different\ngenetic mechanisms (natural selection instead of random genetic drift,\nlocal selection, and interdemic selection). Ford (1975, p. 40-44)\nargued that subdivision of a large, geographically extensive population\ninto relatively small groups promotes rapid evolution because,\n“… when populations occupy a series of restricted habitats\nthey can adapt themselves independently to the local environment in\neach of them, while when spread over a larger area they can be adjusted\n[by natural selection] only to the average of the diverse conditions\nwhich obtain there. This, however, requires that the adaptations should\nnot be constantly broken down by a trickle of immigrants from one small\ncolony to another”. Here, he proposes a trade-off between\nspecialized adaptation to local conditions in the absence of migration\nand generalized adaptation to global conditions in the presence of\nmigration. In modern terms, this is called genotype-by-environment\ninteraction, where the selective effect, s, of a gene changes\nwith change in the environment. A gene might be adaptive in one\nenvironmental context (i.e., s > 0) but maladaptive in\nanother (i.e., s < 0). Migration between local environments\nmixes the adaptive and maladaptive responses to selection and reduces\nthe average magnitude of gene frequency change. In this sense,\ngenotype-by-environment interaction is viewed as an evolutionary\nconstraint because is limits the rate of gene frequency change. \nThe restraint can be removed simply by stopping gene flow or the mixing\nof genes across different local environments. Thus, the fixed selective\neffect illustrated in Figure 1, must be considered an average\nselective effect across environments. Clearly, large local effects of\nopposite sign must be averaged when there is gene flow among habitats\nand the averaging tends to reduce the gene's selective effect. Ford\nalso suggests that the genetic mechanism involves “gene\ncomplex[es] balanced to fit their own local environment”. That\nis, he claims interactions among genes, or epistasis, contribute to\nlocal adaptation. Thus, Ford invokes genotype-by-environment\ninteractions for fitness as well as gene-gene interactions for fitness\nin his cases of rapid evolution. Both of these kinds of interactions\nchange the depiction of the threshold separating natural selection from\nrandom genetic drift (Figure 1) in important ways (see below). Before\nturning to interaction effects, I will examine a representative\ndiscussion of ecological genetics of random genetic drift using data\nfrom a natural population. \n\nSeveral wing coloration variants segregating in a small natural\npopulation of the moth, Panaxia dominula (Fisher and Ford\n1947), were investigated using mark-recapture in one of the longest\ncontinuous studies of a single population in evolutionary research. The\ngoal of Fisher and Ford was to determine whether year-to-year\nfluctuations in the frequency of the variants (medionigra, a\nheterozygote, and bimaculata, a homozygote) were better\nexplained by natural selection or by random genetic drift. They\ninferred from their analysis \n\nWith this paper, Fisher and Ford moved the long-standing debate\nbetween Wright and Fisher over the relative roles of natural selection\nand random genetic drift in evolution from theory to nature. It is\nremarkable that, in the first such study with only eight years of\nobservations on a single locus with alternative alleles, they are\nconfident in rejecting Wright's theory and random genetic drift in its\nentirety. In his response (Wright 1948), Wright pointed out, first,\nthat his theory of evolution explicitly involved the simultaneous\naction of several forces (selection, drift, mutation, and migration)\nand he emphatically rejected the paradigm of Fisher and Ford that\neither selection or drift alone had to be responsible for all\nof the observed fluctuation in gene frequencies. Wright noted that, in\norder to reach their statistical conclusion, Ford and Fisher had to\ninclude gene frequency data from a decade before the more careful\nstudy, notably a period without any estimates of population size.\nWithout this earlier data point, the average fluctuations were much\nsmaller and not significant. He pointed out that, like the\nmark-recapture estimates of population numbers, the gene frequencies\nthemselves were estimates whose variation, based on the reported\nsample sizes, accounted for more than half (55.2%) of the observed\nvariance that Fisher and Ford were trying to explain. He then showed\nthat, if one assumed only the unitary explanation of natural\nselection, then the observed gene frequency fluctuations were so large\neven without the sampling variance that the temporal\nvariations in the allelic selection coefficients must range from near\nlethality (or sterility) to tremendous advantage (i.e., -0.50 to\n+0.50). However, Fisher and Ford (1947) provided no indication of\ncomparable levels of temporal variation in any environmental factor\nacting as a selective agent.  Wright argued that the effective\npopulation sizes used in the analysis were almost certainly too large,\npossibly by an order of magnitude, and that Fisher and Ford had made\nno attempt to estimate the factors expected to reduce effective size,\nlike temporal variation in breeding numbers, non-random mortality\namong larvae (mortality clustered within families as might affect a\nspecies which experiences > 85% pupal mortality owing to viral\ninfection), or other causes of the variance in offspring numbers (such\nas variation among females in egg numbers or variation among males in\nmate numbers). In an unyielding reply, Fisher and Ford (1950) labeled\nchance or random fluctuations in gene frequency, the Sewall Wright\nEffect, a term which has endured to the present day as a synonym\nfor random genetic drift. \n\nWith a larger data set covering several more years, Ford (1975, p.\n146) revisited this exchange and argued that Wright remained wrong on\neach count. Ford also showed that the selective advantage for the rarer\nof the genes varied widely, from -0.10 to +0.20, and that there was no\nevidence of heterozygote advantage. He did not find, however, the\nexpected negative correlation between strength of selection and\npopulation size in these data. In the intervening decades, data from a\nvariety of other organisms and natural population had become available\nand its review led Ford (1975, p. 389) to conclude: “As a result,\nit is no longer possible to attribute to random genetic drift or to\nmutation any significant part in the control of evolution.” Thus,\nthroughout its founding period, ecological genetics was relentlessly\nsupportive of natural selection as unitary explanation for evolutionary\nchange. (Later laboratory research has shown that the expression of the\ncolor patterns is sensitive to the thermal environment during\ndevelopment and thus the gene frequency estimates may be subject to\nsignificant measurement error, owing to the misclassification of\ngenotypes. This is yet another source of variation, not accounted for\nin the Ford analyses. In addition, empirical evidence has found, as\nWright expected, that temporal fluctuations in population size, large\nvariance among females in fecundity, and sexual selection reduce the\neffective number to less than half the Fisher-Ford estimate. In\naddition, more careful studies have reduced Ford's estimates of the\nmagnitude of the average genic selection coefficient by about two\nthirds [cf. Cook and Jones 1996].) \n\nThe existence of either genotype-by-environment interaction (G ×\nE) or gene-by-gene interaction (epistasis or G × G) greatly\ncomplicates the estimation of selection coefficients.  Ecological\ngeneticists like Ford postulated interactions of the sort that could\nchange the sign of genic selection coefficients with changes in the\nenvironment (including density) or in the genetic background.  This\nkind of reversal of selective effect requires what is known as a\n‘crossing-type’ norm of reaction for G × E or\nadditive-by-additive epistasis for G × G (Wade 2002). The\nsimplest model of crossing-type G × E, consists of additive\nselection (i.e., genotypic fitnesses of 1 + 2s, 1 +\ns, and 1 for genotypes AA, Aa, and\naa, in one environment and the opposite order in the second\nenvironment) in each of two alternative environments, E1\nand E2, with frequencies, fE1 and\nfE2, respectively. As the two environments fluctuate in\nfrequency, spatially or temporally, the selective effect of an\nA allele changes in both magnitude and sign (see Figure\n2). Depending upon the relative frequencies of the alternative\nenvironments and the amount of gene flow or migration between them,\nthe A allele on average can be a ‘good’ gene or a\n‘bad’ gene, a gene of major effect or minor effect, or\neven a neutral gene if the two environments are equally abundant. The\nsmaller the amount of migration between the environments, the greater\nis the degree of local adaptation to each as Ford suggested (see\nabove). However, the average selective effect of the gene in\nthe sense of Fisher's theory must be smaller than the average\nobservation in a particular locality at a particular time because the\nlong-term average contains both positive and negative values of\ns. Furthermore, to the extent that the local value of\ns changes sign owing to continuous fluctuations in local\nenvironmental conditions, the A allele will also move from\nthe domain of selection to the domain of drift as Wright\nsuggested. Thus, the very kind of population subdivision imagined by\nFord, with selection acting in every locality albeit in different\ndirections, creates, rather than eliminates, the opportunity for\nrandom genetic drift.   \n\nA very similar effect on the ‘gene's eye view’ of\nselection is caused by additive-by-additive epistasis (Goodnight and\nWade 2000; Wade 2001, 2002). The simplest model of this kind of G\n× G, with interaction between loci A and B,\neach with alternative alleles, results in an average genic selection\ncoefficient acting on the A allele of\ns(pB −\npb). The relative frequencies of the\nalternative alleles at the B locus, determine whether the\nA allele is a ‘good’ gene or a ‘bad’\ngene, a gene of major effect or minor effect, or even a neutral gene\nwhen the alleles are equally abundant (i.e.,\npB =\npb). Whenever allele frequencies of its\nepistatic partner change, either by drift or selection, the A\nallele's selective effect also changes and, like the case of G ×\nE, it moves between the domains of natural selection and random drift\n(Figure 2). \n\nThe central problem with using conspicuous polymorphisms for\ninvestigating the relative roles of the variety of different\nevolutionary forces is that it is not an unbiased sample of genetic\ndiversity with respect to either degree of adaptive function or amount\nof genetic variation. Indeed, the definition of genetic polymorphism\nadopted by Ford (see above) incorporates the essence of both of these\nbiases. For a period, it was believed that “The solution to our\ndilemma lies in the development of molecular genetics” (Lewontin\n1974, p. 99). With the advent of electrophoresis, the amino acid\nsequence of a random sample of proteins from almost any organism could\nbe studied and, for the first time, the level of genetic diversity, in\nthe form of amino acid substitutions, across the genome could be\nquantified. \n\nTwo measures of genetic diversity were possible using\nelectrophoresis: (1) the number of loci polymorphic; and, (2) the\naverage heterozygosity per an individual. From studies across a number\nof species, it was estimated that 15-40% of all loci were polymorphic\nand the average individual was heterozygous at 5-15% of its genome.\nSince this technique measured primarily amino acid substitutions\nresulting in charge changes, i.e., only one third of all possible amino\nacid substitutions, one could infer that these were minimal levels of\ngenetic diversity. The conclusion that genetic variation was\nubiquitous, with most genes being polymorphic, was inescapable. The\nsearch for the adaptive function of allozyme variants and balancing\nselection at the physiological level ensued. \n\nHowever, these levels of genetic polymorphism appeared to be much too\nlarge to be explained by the type of balancing selection observed by\nFord and his colleagues for conspicuous phenotypic polymorphisms in\nnatural populations. The basic problem was that the numbers of\nselective deaths necessary to account for the observed levels of\nallozyme polymorphism exceeded the reproductive excess of almost all\nspecies. Haldane (1957) called this the “cost of natural\nselection” and it is also referred to as the substitutional\nload.  Differently put, the mortality of homozygous genotypes, if\nindependently selected, (also known as the ‘segregation\nload’) would exceed the total numbers of offspring produced by a\npopualtion. For this reason, Kimura (1983) proposed his neutral theory\nof molecular evolution, founded on the theoretical observation that\nthe probability of fixation of a novel mutant allele with selective\ncoefficient, s >0, was approximately 2s. Thus,\nthe probability of loss of even a favored mutation was, for small\ns, only slightly smaller than the probability of loss by\nchance for a truly neutral allele. Studies of protein structure also\nrevealed that the functional sites of a protein, which constitute the\nminority of its amino acids, evolved several times more slowly than\nthe non-functional or structural sites. The view that much, if not\nmost, of evolutionary change at the molecular level was determined by\nrandom genetic drift and not natural selection was highly\ncontroversial. As Kimura noted (1983, p. 22), “…if a\ncertain doctrine is constantly being spoken of favorably by the\nmajority, endorsed by top authorities in their books and taught in\nclasses, then a belief is gradually built up in one's mind, eventually\nbecoming the guiding principle and the basis of value judgment. At any\nrate, this was the time when the panselectionist or\n‘neo-Darwinian’ position was most secure in the history of\nbiology: the heyday of the traditional ‘synthetic theory’\nof evolution.” \n\nIt was soon recognized that a more reductionistic approach (DNA\nsequence studies) might help to resolve the issue of whether or not\nevery amino acid was of some functional value because the redundant\npositions in the code of life were assumed to provide an estimate of\nthe true ‘neutral’ rate of evolution, owing to random\ngenetic drift acting in the absence of selection. \n\nThe neutral theory of evolution is the antithesis of ecological\ngenetics. It states that random genetic drift, rather than natural\nselection, governs most evolutionary change at the level of the DNA and\nproteins, while admitting that natural selection predominates in\nshaping the morphological and physiological traits that manifest an\nadaptive fit with the environment. This is a paradox because most of\nthe DNA appears to be non-functional while most of the externally\nobservable phenotype appears to have adaptive function. \n\nTests of the theory using DNA sequence data consist of comparisons\nof the relative evolutionary rates of different kinds of sites (base\npairs) within codons and take advantage of the redundancy in the\ngenetic code. The rate of neutral evolution is estimated from levels of\npolymorphism or numbers of segregating sites within species or the\ndivergence between species in silent or redundant site substitutions.\nSilent sites are those that do not result in an amino acid change in\nthe protein and, hence, are non-functional in the usual sense. In\ncontrast, the rate of selective change or selective constraint is\nevaluated relative to the neutral rate using replacement sites, those\nbase pair changes that result in amino acid changes. If the rate of\nsubstitution or polymorphism is lower than neutral, it is evidence of\nselective constraint or purifying natural selection acting to prevent\nchange and preserve function in the face of mutational damage. If the\nrate of substitution is higher than neutral, then it is evidence of\nadaptive substitution.  \n\nMolecular evolutionary studies also revealed the existence of\npseudogenes, non-coding stretches of DNA derived by the\ntandem duplication and subsequent inactivation by mutation of single\ncopy genes. The lack of function of the pseudogene makes all of its\ncodons effectively neutral and provides another estimate of the rate\nof neutral evolution. Importantly, ‘replacement’ sites\nthat evolve slowly in the functional gene have been shown to evolve\nmore rapidly in the nonfunctional tandem duplicate pseudogene. \n\nChanges in the pattern of neutral variation in the vicinity of a\nselected site(s) are also informative because, during an adaptive\nsubstitution, neutral variants linked to the piece of selected DNA are\ncarried or ‘swept’ to fixation along with it. This\n‘selective sweep’ temporarily reduces the level of neutral\nvariation in the vicinity of selected sites until it can be replaced by\nmutation. The degree of reduction in neutral variation or the\n‘footprint of selection’ depends upon the strength of\nselection, the frequency of recombination during selection, and the\ntime since the initiation of selection. The footprint is most\nconspicuous when a selective sweep is initiated by the advent of a\nsingle, novel favorable mutation. To the extent that novel selection\nresults from a change of environment and begins to act on existing or\nstanding variation already in the population, the impact on neutral\npolymorphisms may be quite minimal. Balancing selection of the sort\nobserved by Ford leaves its own unique ‘reverse’ footprint\non neutral diversity. Because the segments of DNA constituting\nthe balanced polymorphism are held in the population by selection much\nlonger than expected based on random drift, these segments have a\nhigher effective population size (owing to lower variation in offspring\nnumbers than random) and tend to accumulate mutational variation at\nnearby neutral sites. Thus, levels of neutral diversity are expected to\nbe enhanced in the vicinity of a molecular balanced polymorphism. When\nthe mating system restricts recombination (e.g., in selfing or\ninbreeding species), the region of elevated neutral diversity in the\nvicinity of a balanced polymorphism can be extensive. \n\nKimura predicted that silent substitutions would evolve more rapidly\nthan replacement substitutions before sequence data were\navailable to test his neutral theory of molecular evolution. Molecular\ngenetic studies have confirmed his prediction: silent sites evolve\nseveral times faster than replacement sites. These studies clearly show\nthat the primary mode of action of natural selection at the level of\nthe DNA sequence is purifying selection. It is this highly conservative\naspect of natural selection that permits comparative molecular\nevolutionary studies of developmental processes across species as\ndiverse as humans and flies. At the molecular level, most genes, though\npolymorphic in sequence, do not display evidence of balancing selection\nand instead manifest patterns of variation that accord well with\nneutral theory. \n\nThe interaction of selection and random drift across linked regions\nof DNA sequence is one of the most active current areas of theoretical\nand empirical research in molecular evolution. Theory shows that it can\nbe difficult to separate cleanly the action of the evolutionary forces\nof selection and drift except for certain regions of parameter space,\nwhose generality remains unknown and subject to much debate. Like the\nstudy by Fisher and Ford (1947), most empirical studies interpret\nall deviations away from strictly the neutral expectation as\nevidence of natural selection without addressing the issue of agency.\nThus, nonrandom or biased use of redundant codons in some regions of\nDNA sequence has been documented. Codon bias is seen as evidence that,\nalthough they have no effect on amino acid sequence, redundant codons\nare not all functionally equivalent. This is taken as evidence that\nnatural selection is all powerful, reaching down into the genome to\naffect even the smallest and least significant components of the\nhereditary material. Thus, the original ecological genetic view that\nnatural selection is the only significant evolutionary force\ncharacterizes much of molecular evolution, despite progress in theory\nand the availability of much more reductionistic genetic methods. The\nparallels between the summary statement of Ford (1975, p. 389; see\nabove) and that of the molecular evolutionary geneticist, E. Nevo\n(2001, p. 6223), twenty-five years later are remarkable:\n“Biodiversity evolution, even in small isolated populations, is\nprimarily driven by natural selection, including diversifying,\nbalancing, cyclical, and purifying selective regimes, interacting with,\nbut ultimately overriding, the effects of mutation, migration, and\nstochasticity.”"}]
