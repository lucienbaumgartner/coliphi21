When the cue ball\nknocks the nine ball into the corner pocket, in virtue of what is this\na case of causation?\n\n\nQuestions about the metaphysics of causation may be usefully divided\ninto questions about the causal relata, and questions about the causal\nrelation. Questions about the causal relata include the questions of\n(1.1) whether they are in spacetime (immanence), (1.2) how\nfine-grained they are (individuation), and (1.3) how many\nthere are (adicity). Questions about the causal relation\ninclude the questions of (2.1) how causally related and causally\nunrelated sequences differ (connection), (2.2) how sequences\nrelated as cause to effect differ from those related as effect to\ncause or as joint effects of a common cause (direction), and\n(2.3) how if at all sequences involving causes differ from those\ninvolving mere background conditions (selection).\n\n\nPhilosophers have, of course, disagreed over all of these questions.\nIn what follows, I shall survey some of the main arguments in the\nliterature.\n\nQuestion: What are the causal relata? When the cue\nball knocks the nine ball into the corner pocket, what are the terms\nof this causal relation? An account of the causal relata should reveal\nwhat sort of thing they are, how many of them there are, and what job\neach does. In short, it should reveal their category,\nnumber, and role. \nOptions: The standard view of the causal relata is\nthat they are of the category of event, and that their number\nis two, in the roles of cause and effect.\nSo on the standard view, when the cue ball knocks the nine ball into\nthe corner pocket, there is said to be an (actual) event\ne1 of the cue ball striking the nine ball, and an\n(actual, distinct) event e2 of the nine ball\nsinking into the corner pocket, such that e1 is\ncause and e2 effect. The standard view, in short,\nholds that the causal relata are a pair of events. \nThe standard view has, of course, been disputed on all counts. As to\ncategory, while the standard view casts the causal relata as events\n(Davidson 1980a and 1980b, Kim 1973, Lewis 1986b), one also finds\nconsiderable support for facts (Bennett 1988, Mellor 1995),\nand occasional support for such other entities as features\n(Dretske 1977), tropes (Keith Campbell 1990), states of\naffairs (Armstrong 1997), situations (Menzies 1989a),\nand aspects (Paul 2000). Allegiances are further complicated\nby disagreements over what events, facts, and these other creatures\nare.  \nAs to number and role, while the standard view numbers the causal\nrelata at two (Davidson 1980b, Mackie 1965, Lewis 1986a), one finds\nsome support for contrastive views featuring three and even\nfour relata (Hitchcock 1996, Woodward 2003, Maslen 2004,\nSchaffer 2005, Menzies 2007, Northcott 2008, Weslake forthcoming) with\nthe additional term(s) playing the roles of causal\nalternative and/or effectual difference. One also finds\nsome support for additional relata of a different sort, including\ndescriptions (Anscombe 1975, McDermott 1995), models\n(Menzies 2004, Halpern and Pearl 2005, Hitchcock 2007a), and/or\ndefault states (Menzies 2004, McGrath 2005, Hall 2007,\nHitchcock 2007a, Halpern 2008). (In what follows I will reserve\n“the relata” for events or facts or whatnot, and use\n“secondary relata” when I wish to speak of the prospect of\ndescriptions or models or defaults as additional relata. This is\npurely for expository convenience.)  \nCategory: What is the category of the causal relata?\nWhat sort of thing are they? An account of the category of the relata\nshould first determine which characteristics differentiate events from\nfacts from the others, and then identify which characteristics the\nrelata must have.  \nIn practice, there are two main differentiating characteristics that\none finds invoked. The first is immanence. Events and the\nothers are generally regarded as immanent, while facts are generally\nregarded as transcendent. That is, the event of Brutus's stabbing\nCaesar is something concrete that occurs at a particular\nspatiotemporal location (the Senate on the Ides of March), while the\nfact that Brutus stabbed Caesar is something abstract and\nnon-spatiotemporal. The question then arises as to whether causation\nrequires immanent or transcendent relata. \nThe second main differentiator that one finds invoked is\nindividuation. Events are sometimes (though not always) held\nto be relatively coarse-grained, while facts and the others are held\nto be relatively fine. For instance, the event of John's saying\n“hello” may be reckoned the same as the event of John's\nsaying “hello” loudly, while the fact that John said\n“hello” is different from the fact that John said\n“hello” loudly. The question then arises as to whether\ncausation requires coarse or fine relata. \nFortunately, questions of the true metaphysics of events, facts, and\nthe other candidates may be postponed here, and the questions of the\nimmanence and individuation of the causal relata may be addressed\ndirectly. Thus the issue of the category of the relata may, in\npractice, be usefully replaced by two questions: whether the relata\nare immanent (Section 1.1), and how finely they are individuated\n(Section 1.2).  \nNumber and Role: What are the number and role of the\ncausal relata? How many causal relata are there, and what kind of job\ndo they do? An account of the number and role of the relata should\nfirst formulate general determinants of the adicity of relations, and\nthen apply these determinants to causation. \nThe view that there are two relata is widely assumed but seldom\ndefended. Three main alternatives have been explored involving\ncontrastivity. The first of these alternatives, inspired by van\nFraassen's (1980) work on contrastive explanation, takes causal\nrelations to include an effectual difference. On this view\ncausal relations have the form: c causes e rather\nthan e*. The second main alternative, based on Hitchcock's\n(1993, 1995a, 1996) work on probabilistic causation, takes causal\nrelations to include a causal alternative. On this view\ncausal relations have the form: c rather than c*\ncauses e. The third main alternative, defended by Schaffer\n(2005), includes both a causal alternative and an effectual difference\nand so numbers the causal relata at four, yielding the form:\nc rather than c* causes e rather than\ne*. The question then arises whether contrasts (for cause\nand/or effect) help resolve problems and paradoxes (Section 1.3). \nThree further main alternatives have been explored positing secondary\nrelata. The first of these, inspired by Anscombe's (1975) claim that\ncausation is an intensional relation, takes causation to be relative\nto descriptions of the primary relata. On this view, causal relations\nhave the form: c causes e relative to D,\nwhere D is an ordered pair of descriptions (for c\nand for e). The second of these alternatives, arising\nespecially from Pearl's (2000) work on causal modeling, treats\ncausation as relative to a certain sort of mathematical\nrepresentation. On this view, causal relations have the form:\nc causes e relative to M, where M\nis an apt causal model of the situation. The third of these\nalternatives, which has roots in Hart and Honore's (1985) treatment of\ncausation in the law, treats causation as relative to default states,\nwhich encode the states that are considered “normal” and\n“natural,” as opposed to the deviant states. The simplest\nversion of this view runs: c causes e relative to\nN, where N is an ordered pair of natural outcomes\n(concerning c and e). These views are all\ncompatible. One could for instance hold that causal relations have the\nform: c causes e relative to D, M,\nand N. (Indeed one area of active research concerns the\ncombination of causal modeling with defaults: see Blanchard and\nSchaffer (forthcoming) for a critical overview.) The question then\narises as to whether any secondary relata are needed, or whether they\nall constitute an objectionable loss of objectivity, or an\nobjectionable departure from the allegedly “obvious\nbinarity” of causation (Section 1.3). \nPresuppositions: Both the dispute over the category\nand over the number and role of the causal relata involve\npresuppositions of uniqueness. As to category, the dispute\npresupposes that there is a unique category of entity from which all\ncausal relata must be drawn. Yet, it might be argued, ordinary\nlanguage allows for the relata to be described in eventive (imperfect\nnominal), factive (perfect nominal), and other forms (Mackie 1974,\nVendler 1984, Bennett 1988). Why not take ordinary language at its\nword, and let a thousand relata bloom?  \nAs to number and role, the dispute presupposes that there is a unique\nnumber that is the adicity. Yet, it might be argued again,\nordinary language allows for causal attributions with and without\ncausal alternatives or effectual differences (Hitchcock 1996). Why not\ntake ordinary language at its word, and let causation go\nmultigrade? \nThere are two main arguments in defense of uniqueness, the first of\nwhich is that it staves off ambiguity (Menzies 1989a). If\nthere were four choices for two relata, it might seem that there would\nbe 24=16 “causal” relations (and more if there\nwere more choices and/or relata and/or adicities). That said, it is\nunclear why there couldn't be a single causal relation (univocally\ndenoted by “causation”) which allowed different types of\nrelata. The identity relation, for instance, can relate items of any\nontological category. \nThe second argument for uniqueness is that it precludes a mysterious\nharmony (Mellor 1995). If there were a plurality of event\ncauses and fact causes and the like, some metaphysical harmony would\nbe needed amongst them, for surely they could not conflict. That is,\nit seems that the event of the cue ball's striking the nine ball, and\nthe fact that the cue ball struck the nine ball, must have comparable\neffects. But without a unique underlying causal relation, there would\nseem to be nothing keeping these effects aligned. That said, perhaps a\nplurality of causal relations could be harmonized, provided either (i)\none were fundamental and the others derivative, or (ii) all were\nderivative from a common non-causal basis, such as the regularities\namong the events.  \nQuestion: Are the causal relata immanent, or\ntranscendent? That is, are they concrete and located in spacetime, or\nabstract and non-spatiotemporal?  \nThis question is connected to the question of category. If the relata\nare transcendent, then they are facts. If they are immanent, then they\nare events, or one of the other candidates such as features, tropes,\nor situations. \nIn practice, one finds two main arguments on the question of\nimmanence. First, there is the argument from pushing, which maintains\nthat the relata must be immanent so as to push things around. Second,\nthere is the argument from absences, which maintains that the relata\nmust be transcendent so that absences can figure in causal\nrelations. \nPushing: The main argument for immanence is that only\nimmanent entities can interact. This argument is nicely\nsummarized by one of its opponents, Bennett: “Some people have\nobjected that facts are not the sort of item that can cause anything.\nA fact is a true proposition (they say); it is not something\nin the world but is rather something about the\nworld, which makes it categorically wrong for the role of a puller and\nshover and twister and bender.” (1988, p. 22; see also Hausman\n1998) According to the pushing argument, only concrete spatiotemporal\nentities can be causes and effects. \nThere are two main responses to the pushing argument, the first of\nwhich is to find substitute immanent entities. These substitute\nimmanents serve as pushers, and relate to the causal facts, while\nstill being distinct from them. Bennett, in the immediate continuation\nof the above quote, recruits objects for just such a purpose:\n“That rests on the mistaken assumption that causal statements\nmust report relations between shovers and forcers. I grant that facts\ncannot behave like elbows in the ribs, but we know what items do play\nthat role — namely, elbows. In our world the pushing and shoving\nand forcing are done by things — elementary particles\nand aggregates of them — and not by any relata of the causal\nrelation.” (1988, p. 22) Mellor (1995) offers a similar\nresponse, suggesting facta (the immanent truth-makers for\nfacts) as the immanent basis for fact causation. \nThe second response to the pushing argument is to charge that it rests\non a naive (pre-Humean) conception of causation as requiring some sort\nof metaphysical push or “oomph”. If the causal relation is\na mere matter of regularity, why can't the regularities hold between\nfacts? \nAbsences: The main argument for transcendence is that\nabsences can be involved in causal relations. Absences are\nsaid to be transcendent entities. They are nothings,\nnon-occurrences, and hence are not in the world. Thus Mellor says,\n“For the ‘C’ and ‘E’\nin a true causal ‘E because C’ need not\nassert the existence of particulars. They may deny it… They are\nnegative existential statements, made true by the\nnon-existence of such particulars,…” (1995, p.\n132) Here Mellor is arguing that, in the case where rock-climbing Don\ndoes not die because he does not fall, Don's non-falling and non-dying\nare causally related, without there being any events or other immanent\nentities to relate. \nThere are two main responses to the absence argument, the first of\nwhich is to deny that absences can be causal. In this vein, Armstrong\nclaims: “Omissions and so forth are not part of the real driving\nforce in nature. Every causal situation develops as it does as a\nresult of the presence of positive factors alone.” (1999, p.\n177; see also Beebee 2004a and Moore 2009) The theorist who denies\nabsence causation may add some conciliatory codicil to the effect that\nabsences stand in cause-like relations. Thus Dowe (2000, 2001)\ndevelops an account of ersatz causation (causation*) to explain away\nour intuitions that absences can be genuinely causal. \nThe second response to the absence argument is to deny that absences\nare transcendent. One way to do this would be to accept the existence\nof negative properties, and think of absences as events in which an\nobject instantiates a negative property. Thus Don's instantiating\nnon-falling at t0 might be counted an immanent\nevent, and a cause of the further immanent event of his instantiating\nnon-dying at t1. A second way to deny that\nabsences are transcendent would be to take absence claims as merely a\nway to describe occurrences, as Hart and Honore recommend: “The\ncorrective here is to realize that negative statements like ‘he\ndid not pull the signal’ are ways of describing the world, just\nas affirmative statements are, but they describe it by\ncontrast not by comparison as affirmative statements\ndo.” (1985, p. 38) Thus Don's not falling at\nt0 may be identified with his clinging to the rock\nat t0, and Don's not dying at\nt1 may be identified with his surviving at\nt1, which events are indeed causally related. \nQuestion: How are the causal relata individuated?\nThat is, if r1 and r2 are\ncausal relata, what are the conditions that determine whether\nr1=r2? \nThis question is related to the question of category. If the relata\nare coarse-grained, then they are events of a certain stripe. If they\nare fine-grained, then they are facts, or one of the other candidates\nsuch as features, tropes, or situations, or else events of another\nstripe. \nCombining the considerations of immanence and individuation, one\nmight, as a first approximation, distinguish a square of possible\nviews underlying the dispute over category: \nIn the upper-right quadrant one finds, alongside fine-grained events\ntheorists such as Kim and Lewis, virtually all those who have opted\nfor a third way, including Dretske, Campbell, Armstrong, Menzies, and\nPaul. Indeed, virtually all the theorists who have rejected both\nevents and facts have done so because they think that the relata must\nbe immanent and thus not facts, but fine-grained and thus not\nevents. \nBut the square is only a very rough first approximation, because\ngranularity really comes in degrees. So to a second approximation, one\nmight render granularity on a continuum, from the coarseness of\nDavidson's (1980c) view on which the causal relata are individuated by\ntheir causes and effects, to the moderate fineness of Kim's (1976)\nview on which the causal relata are individuated by their associated\n<object, property, time> triples, to the extreme fineness of\nBennett's (1988) view on which the causal relata are individuated as\nfinely as propositions. \nThe Davidson-Kim-Bennett continuum is still only an approximation\nthough, because there really are more occupied points along a wider\ncontinuum. How fine-grained Kim's events actually are depends on how\nfinely properties are individuated. If properties are taken in an\nabundant sense (individuated as finely as predicates, or at least as\nfinely as necessarily coextensive predicates) then Kimian events are\nrelatively fine-grained, whereas if properties are taken in a sparse\nsense (individuated by “the joints of nature”) then the\ngrain is coarser. How fine-grained Bennett's facts are depends on how\nfinely propositions are individuated. If propositions are taken as\nFrege conceives them, then Bennett's facts are exceptionally\nfine-grained; whereas if propositions are taken as Russell conceives\nthem, then Bennett's facts are comparable in granularity to Kim's\nevents with abundant properties. Moreover, Davidson's view is\noutflanked in coarseness by Quine's (1985; accepted by Davidson 1985)\nview that the causal relata are individuated by spacetime region.\nWhile even the Fregean variant of Bennett's view is outflanked in\nfineness by Dretske's (1977) view on which even focal differences\n(such as between Mary's kissing John, and Mary's kissing\nJohn) entail differences in relata. Putting this together\nyields the following picture: \nFurther discriminations along the granularity dimension are, of\ncourse, possible. \nIn practice, one finds three main arguments on the question of\nindividuation. First, there is the argument from causal differences,\nwhich maintains that the relata must be fine so as to mark differences\nin causal relatedness. Second, there is the argument from\ntransitivity, which maintains that the relata must be fine so as to\npreserve transitivity. Third, there is the argument from methodology,\nwhich maintains that the relata must be coarse for general reasons of\ntheoretical elegance. \nCausal Differences: The first main argument for\nfineness is that fine differences can mark causal\ndifferences. To take an example discussed by Davidson, it makes\nsense to say, “The collapse was caused, not by the fact that the\nbolt gave way, but by the fact that it gave way so suddenly and\nunexpectedly” (1980b, p. 161; see also Kim 1976). This suggests\nthat the bolt's snapping, and the bolt's snapping suddenly, must\ndiffer as causal relata. Or to take an example from Lewis (1986b),\nJohn's saying “hello” must differ from John's saying\n“hello” loudly, since only the former causes Fred to greet\nJohn in return, and only the latter is caused by John's state of\ntension. According to the causal differences argument, the relata must\nbe fine on pain of conflating conflicting causal relations. \nThere are three main responses to the causal differences argument, the\nfirst of which is that “cause” is ambiguous\nbetween causation and explanation. The causal differences\nargument is said to adduce explanatory differences only (Davidson\n1980b and 1980d, Strawson 1985). Davidson integrates this response\nwithin a general account of causation and explanation, in which\ncausation is an extensional relation that holds between coarse events,\nwhile explanation is an intensional relation that holds between the\ncoarse events under a description. So John's state of tension causes\nJohn's saying “hello,” but the explanatory relation only\nholds when the “hello” is described in terms of its\nloudness. Our judgment that John's state of tension does not\n‘cause’ John's saying “hello” is to be\nexplained away as keyed into the explanatory idiom. \nThe second response to the causal differences argument is that\n“…causes…” is an intensional\ncontext (Anscombe 1975, Achinstein 1975 and 1983, McDermott 1995).\nIntensional contexts do not license substitution of co-referring terms\nsalva veritate. Thus John's saying “hello” may\nrefer to the same event as John's saying “hello” loudly,\nbut substituting the one description for the other may still change\nthe truth-value of the causal claim. If so then different\ndescriptions of the same relata can induce causal\ndifferences. \nThe third response to the causal differences argument is that it\noverextends. It looks to require a fineness beyond what many\nof its proponents have envisioned. To take an example from Achinstein\n(1983), it may be true that “Socrates' drinking hemlock\nat dusk caused his death,” but false that “Socrates'\ndrinking hemlock at dusk caused his death.” If so, the\ncausal differences argument entails that Socrates's drinking\nhemlock at dusk, and Socrates's drinking hemlock at\ndusk, must differ as causal relata. If so, then the causal\ndifferences argument ultimately requires the extreme fineness of the\nDretskean view, which some may regard as a reductio. \nTransitivity: The second main argument for fineness\nis that it preserves transitivity. To adapt an example from\nWoodward (1984; see also Ehring 1997, Paul 2000), suppose that Tom\nputs potassium salt in the fireplace (c), Dick then tosses a\nmatch in the fireplace, which results in a purple fire blazing in the\nfireplace (d), which then spreads and immolates Harry\n(e). The coarse-grained theorist looks to be committed to the\nfollowing breakdown of transitivity: Tom's putting potassium salt in\nthe fireplace causes there to be a purple fire blazing in the\nfireplace: c causes d; there being a purple fire\nblazing in the fireplace causes Harry's immolation: d causes\ne; but Tom's putting potassium salt in the fireplace does not\ncause Harry's immolation: c does not cause e. The\nfine-grained theorist may distinguish d1: the fire\nbecoming purple at region r, from d2: the\nfire blazing at r. Now c causes\nd1 (not d2),\nd2 (not d1) causes e,\nand so the transitive inference to c's causing e\nwould be blocked. \nThere are two main responses to the transitivity argument, the first\nof which is to bite the bullet. That is, one may accept that\nc does cause e: Tom's putting potassium salts in the\nfireplace does indeed cause Harry's immolation. Our intuitions to the\ncontrary might be written off, as above, as confusing the causal and\nexplanatory idioms. Or our intuitions to the contrary might be\nexplained away on pragmatic grounds. As Lewis remarks in a related\ncontext, we are prone to “mix up questions of what is generally\nconducive to what with questions of what caused what,” though,\n“Every historian knows that actions often have unintended and\nunwanted consequences.” (2000, pp. 194–5) \nThe second reply to the transitivity argument is to deny that\ncausation is transitive. There seem to be failures of transitivity\nthat cannot be resolved by fine-graining. For instance, to borrow an\nexample from Hall (2000, see also Hitchcock 2001), suppose that the\nboulder begins to roll down the hill towards the hiker's head\n(c), which causes the hiker to duck (d), which in\nturn causes the hiker to survive (e). It seems that\nc causes d and that d causes e,\nyet it does not seem that c causes e or that slicing\nup d into different features or aspects or whatnot will help.\nIf so, then transitivity is lost anyway. \nMethodology: The main argument for coarseness is that\nit is methodologically preferable. Quine (1985, p. 167)\ncharges fine-grained conceptions of the relata with invoking poorly\nindividuated and unfamiliar entities, and recommends extremely coarse\n(spatiotemporal) individuation as principled and familiar in ontic\ncommitments. And Davidson (1985) embraces Quine's view as both\n“neater” and “better” than even Davidson's own\n(1980b) previous view. \nThere are two main replies to the methodology argument, the first of\nwhich is that some of the fine-grained conceptions are perfectly\nprincipled. Kim's (1976) fine-grained conception of events as property\ninstantiations, for instance, offers a precise criterion for\nindividuation, namely: \n(The generalization to n-ary relations is straightforward.)\nAnd the entities invoked (objects, properties, and times) should be\nperfectly familiar to all but the most austere nominalist. In fact,\nQuine himself admits not only that Kim's fine-grained conception is\nperfectly principled, but even that it “could still be\naccommodated in the ontology that I have accepted.” (1985, p.\n167) \nThe second reply to the methodology argument is that it is not clear\nthat these indecencies in individuation or multiplication of entities\nshould count for much. As to individuation, we accept physical objects\nwithout clear individuation principles for those, so why hold events\n(or whatever the relata may be) to a stricter standard? As to\nmultiplication, if one has a reductive fine-grained view\n(such as Lewis's 1986b view of events as transworld classes of\nregions), then there is no multiplication in one's basic ontology at\nall, since all the components already exist. And if one has a\nnonreductive fine-grained view, then the resulting\nmultiplication may still be blameless. The real methodological sin is\nto multiply entities without necessity, so if there is a need\nfor fine individuation (such as the causal differences and/or\ntransitivity arguments might provide), then postulation of such\nentities is methodologically pure. \nQuestion: What is the number and role of the causal\nrelata? That is, how many are there, and what kind of job does each\ndo? This question may be usefully divided into the subquestions of\nwhether to posit contrasts (Section 1.3.1), and whether to posit any\nsecondary relata such as descriptions, or models, or defaults (Section\n1.3.2).  \nAs to contrasts, one finds four main arguments. First, there is the\nargument from surface form, which maintains that the causal relata\nmust be two to fit the surface form of utterances such as “the\nshort circuit caused the fire.” Second, there is the argument\nfrom determinacy, which maintains that the causal relata must be four\nfor causal relations to be well defined. Third and fourth, there are\nthe arguments from immanence-revisited and individuation-revisited,\nwhich maintain that the causal relata must be four to resolve the\nproblems about absences and causal differences reviewed above\n(Sections 1.1 and 1.2, respectively). \nAll the arguments to be considered here call for either two or four\nrelata (not three). Indeed, one might argue against contrastive three\nrelata views that they preclude causal chains. In a causal\nchain the effect at the first link serves as the cause at the second.\nFor this to be possible, cause and effect must be formally\nexchangeable: the same structure must flank both sides of the\nrelation. Suppose the first domino knocks over the second, which then\nknocks over the third. The binary theorist can say that c:\nthe toppling of the first domino, causes d: the toppling of\nthe second; and that d in turn causes e: the\ntoppling of the third domino. The quaternary theorist can say that\nc rather than c*: the first domino's remaining\nupright, causes d rather than d*: the second\ndomino's remaining upright; and that d rather than\nd* causes e rather than e*: the third\ndomino's remaining upright. But if there were contrasts on only one\nside of the relation, then no such chains could be constructed. The\nlinks would not match. \nSurface Form: The main argument for binarity is that\nthe surface form of causal claims reveals it. Causal claims\nlike “the short circuit caused the fire” make no explicit\nreference to any contrasts. Such claims can be felicitously uttered\nout of the blue (in discourse initial position), and so do not require\nany antecedent contrast setting or presupposition fixing, either. This\nis presumably the root of the idea that causation is “obviously\nbinary”. Indeed this sort of consideration is most prominent in\nDavidson (1980b), who seeks the logical form of such surface-binary\nutterances. Relatedly, Davidson rejects the nearby notion of\ncausal relevance because, “There is no room for a\nconcept of ‘cause as’ which would make causality a\nrelation among three or four entities rather than between two.”\n(1993, p. 6) \nThere are three main replies to the surface form argument, the first\nof which is that contrastive surface forms exist too. For instance,\none also finds such claims as “Pam's throwing the rock rather\nthan the pebble caused the window to shatter,” “Pam's\nthrowing the rock caused the window to shatter rather than\ncrack,” and even the combined “Pam's throwing the rock\nrather than the pebble caused the window to shatter rather than\ncrack.” Thus surface form might seem equivocal (Hitchcock\n1996). \nThe second main reply to the surface form argument is that surface\nform may be a reduced expression of a more complex logical form. For\ninstance, “Ann prefers chocolate” may be used as a reduced\nexpression of the proposition that Ann prefers chocolate over\nvanilla. Here the contrast does not need to be explicitly\narticulated, or even noted earlier in the conversation. One can make\nsurface-binary preference claims out of the blue. So just as\npreference claims might seem to have a contrastive logical form\nbeneath their binary surface, so causal claims too might be regarded\nin this light. At any rate, as the history of semantics has shown, it\nwould be foolishly naive to think that ordinary language displays its\nlogical form on its surface. In this vein Schaffer (2012) diagnoses a\nrange of context-dependencies in causal discourse as being due to\nimplicit contrastivity.  \nThe third main reply is to go revisionary. Even if the\nlogical form of causal attributions ultimately proves to be binary,\nlogical form should not have the last word in metaphysics anyway,\nsince it might predicate a property that we have theoretical reason to\nreject. For instance, “The rock is moving” might seem to\npredicate the property of absolute motion, but physicists have\ndiscovered that there is no such thing. So just as motion claims only\nmake metaphysical sense when relativized to an inertial frame, one\nmight think that causal claims only make metaphysical sense when\nrelativized to contrasts. \nDeterminacy: The first main argument for quaternicity\nis that binary causal relations are ill defined. Suppose that\nJane smokes moderately, and develops lung cancer. Does Jane's moderate\nsmoking cause her lung cancer? Hitchcock says that there is no\ndeterminate answer unless one fixes the causal alternative: “The\nsolution to this puzzle is to deny that there is any such thing as\nthe causal relevance of moderate smoking for lung\ncancer… Relative to heavy smoking, it is a negative cause of\n(prevents) lung cancer; relative to abstaining, moderate smoking is a\npositive cause of (causes) lung cancer… Relations of positive\nor negative causal relevance only hold relative to specific\nalternatives.” (1996, p. 402) A parallel case could be made for\nneeding to fix the effectual difference. Suppose that Pablo is\nchoosing between blue, red, and green paint for his canvas. Does\nPablo's choosing blue paint rather than red cause the canvas to be\nblue? Here one might say that there is still no determinate answer.\nPablo's choosing blue paint rather than red causes the canvas to be\nblue rather than red, but does not cause the canvas to be blue rather\nthan green. Thus it may be concluded that contrasts are required for\nboth cause and effect, in order for causal claims to have determinate\ntruth-values. \nThe main reply to the determinacy argument is that binary causal\nrelations are well defined, after all. This reply should take the form\nof applying a binary account of causation to problem cases such as the\nsmoking and painting cases, and simply reading off a truth-value,\nwhatever it may be. For instance, one might think that a\nstraightforward counterfactual account of causation, on which we check\nwhether e would still have occurred had c not\noccurred, simply rules that Jane's smoking causes her lung cancer, and\nthat Pablo's choosing blue paint causes the canvas to be blue, full\nstop. \nImmanence Revisited: The second main argument for\nquaternicity revisits immanence, and maintains that\nadditional argument places reconcile immanence with absence causation\n(Schaffer 2005). The reconciliation is attempted through treating\nabsence-claims as setting the contrast to the associated occurrence.\nFor instance, “the gardener's failing to water the flowers\ncaused the flowers' wilting” is to be interpreted as: what the\ngardener actually did (viz., the actual event of his watching\ntelevision) rather than watering the flowers (the non-actual event\nthat is the associated occurrence) caused the flowers to wilt rather\nthan blossom. And this claim may well be true. In this way, all four\nof the relata may be treated as immanent entities, and absence causal\nclaims may still come out true. Indeed, in this way absence causation\nrequires no special provisions at all (which, as Dowe (2000) explains,\nis not the case on virtually any binary theory). \nThe main reply to the immanence-revisited argument is that immanence\nneeds no revisiting. No reconciliation of absences and immanence is\nneeded, and so no additional argument places are needed. This reply\nmay take the form of denying immanence (that is, embracing facts),\ndenying that absences are causal, or maintaining that there are\nimmanent absences (Section 1.1).  \nIndividuation Revisited: The third main argument for\nquaternicity revisits individuation, and maintains that\nadditional argument places tame the causal differences argument\n(Schaffer 2005). The concern is that the causal differences argument\noverextends, in requiring that Socrates' drinking hemlock at\ndusk, and Socrates' drinking hemlock at dusk, differ as\ncausal relata. The taming is attempted through treating focal\ndifferences as contrastive differences. Thus “Socrates'\ndrinking hemlock at dusk” is to be interpreted as\nc: Socrates' drinking Hemlock at dusk, rather than\nc*: Socrates' drinking wine at dusk (or some other\ncontextually salient alternative to drinking hemlock); while\n“Socrates' drinking hemlock at dusk” is to be\ninterpreted as c: Socrates' drinking Hemlock at dusk, rather\nthan c*: Socrates' drinking hemlock at dawn (or some other\ncontextually salient alternative to occurring at dusk). And these\ndifferent contrasts may induce different effects. In this way, focal\ndifferences may be allowed to yield causal differences, without having\nany implications for individuation, much less the extreme fineness of\nthe Dretskean view. \nThe main reply to the individuation-revisited argument is that\nindividuation needs no revisiting. No taming of the causal differences\nargument is required, and so no additional argument places are needed.\nThis reply may take the form of maintaining the Davidsonian\ndistinction between causation and causal explanation, of allowing that\ncausation is an intensional relation, or of simply accepting the\nDretskean view of the relata (Section 1.2). \nAs to secondary relata, one finds three main arguments. First, there\nis the argument from objectivity, which maintains that any\nrelativization of causal relations to descriptions, models, or\ndefaults is incompatible with the objectivity of causation. Second,\nthere is the argument from the success of causal modeling techniques,\nwhich maintains that causation must be relative to a model so that\nmodeling techniques may be exploited. Third, it has been argued that\ndefault relativity provides the best explanation for our intuitions\nacross a range of problem cases. (The argument from surface form\n(Section 1.3.1) may also serve as a fourth argument against any\nsecondary relata.) \nObjectivity: Leaving aside linguistic issues of\nsurface form, the main argument against descriptions, models, and/or\ndefaults as secondary relata is that including these would compromise\nthe objectivity of causation. When the cue ball knocks the nine ball\ninto the corner pocket, it might seem that there is objective\ncausation in the world. How we choose to describe the events, model\nthe situation, or label certain outcomes as “default” or\n“deviant” seems besides the point. For instance, if a\nmodel M is used in which this interaction comes out as\nnon-causal, one might well infer, not that the interaction is\nnot causal relative to M, but rather that M itself\nis a poor model of the real, model-independent causal facts. \nThere are two main (related) replies to the objectivity argument, the\nfirst of which is to bite the bullet and deny that causation is\nobjective. Such a response might be partly encouraged by the thought\nthat causation seems to drop out of fundamental physics (2.1.2). The\nsecond related reply is to maintain that there is still objectivity in\na wide range of surrounding notions. Thus Hitchcock invokes the notion\nof token causal structure for what causal models represent,\nand suggests that “we can afford to let judgments of token\ncausation be infected by pragmatic criteria without giving up on the\nobjectivity of causation generally: objectivity can be retained at the\nlevel of token causal structure” (2007a, p. 504). \nCausal Modeling: Perhaps the main argument for model\nrelativity begins with the success of causal modeling techniques, as\ndeveloped in Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines (1993), Pearl (2000), and\nHalpern and Pearl (2005), inter alia. These techniques have\nprovided working algorithms for causal discovery, and yielded elegant\naccounts of type-level causal relations. It it only prudent, the\nargument then begins, to seek an account of (actual, token) causation\nusing such techniques. Indeed it might well seem retrograde to do\notherwise. But given that different models yield different causal\nverdicts, and given that there is no unique notion of a canonical\nmodel for a given situation (at least none yet developed), it\nmight seem that the only remaining option is to relativize causal\nrelations to models (Halpern and Pearl 2005, p. 85). \nThere are at least three replies to the causal modeling argument to\nconsider. First, one might evince skepticism concerning causal\nmodeling. Causal modeling certainly provides an excellent account of\ncausal epistemology, but it is not obvious that one should draw any\nmetaphysical conclusions from that. Second, one might attempt to\ndefine the notion of a canonical model. Third, one might provide an\naccount of causation involving existential quantification over models\n(Hitchcock 2001) or even universal quantification, so as to help\noneself to modeling techniques without paying any further price in\nobjectivity. \nProblem Cases: Perhaps the main argument for\ndescription and default relativity, which also features as an argument\nfor model relativity, is the utility of such additional relata in\nresolving problem cases. This style of argument covers a wide variety\nof claims. Just to mention a few examples, McDermott (1995) builds\ndescription-relativity into an overall account of causation that\nenjoys a fair amount of success. McGrath (2005) has suggested that our\nintuitions about which absences are causes may turn on expectations as\nto which are normal. Hall (2007) has shown that certain causally\ndifferent cases may take isomorphic causal models, so that modeling\ntechniques may themselves require something like a default/deviant\ndistinction to discern these cases. And Hitchcock (2007a) uses models\nwith assigned default states to define up the notion of a\nself-contained causal network, which he then puts to work in\naddressing many of the most difficult cases in the literature. (See\nHalpern and Hitchcock 2010 and forthcoming, as well as Blanchard and\nSchaffer forthcoming, for further debate about the need for a\ndefault/deviant distinction within causal modeling.) It is difficult\nto say much more about these arguments in general, without delving\ninto all the details. Obviously further consideration of these\narguments depends on detailed considerations as to how the theories in\nquestion fare versus their rivals, and also on delicate balancing of\nwhether the solution proferred is worth the price of the additional\nrelativity. \nQuestion: What is the causal relation? When the cue\nball knocks the nine ball into the corner pocket, what is the basis\nfor this causal link? An adequate account of the causal relation\nshould reveal where the causal lines run, which direction the causal\narrows point, and what if anything distinguishes causes from mere\nbackground conditions. In short, it should reveal the basis for\nconnection, direction, and selection. \nNetwork Model: The causal relation is typically\nunderstood with reference to what Steward (1997; see also Beebee 2004)\ncalls “the network model.” The network model has two main\ncomponents. First, it pictures the causal relation as a directed\nsegment, and the causal relata as nodes. Second, the network model\npictures history as a vast causal network. On the network model, given\nsome realistic assumptions, the causal history of e forms a\nvast inverted tree (though one which ultimately narrows back down to\nthe big bang): \nAn account of connection is an account of the segments; an account of\ndirection is an account of the arrowheads. Selection on the network\nmodel would consist in highlighting certain nodes: \nThe network model without selection is implemented, for instance, in\nthe neuron diagrams popularized by Lewis. In neuron diagrams, circles\ndoubly represent neurons that fire and events that occur, and arrows\ndoubly represent synapses that stimulate and causation that\nobtains. \nThe network model without selection is also implemented in the\ndirected acyclic graphs used in causal modeling to partially visualize\nthe models (Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines 1993; Pearl 2000). In\ndirected acyclic graphs, nodes doubly represent variables with a range\nof values and occurrences with a range of alternatives, and links\ndoubly represent functional determination via the structural equations\nand causal parenthood. (For further explanation of causal modeling,\nsee the entry: causation: probabilistic.) \n(Neuron diagrams and directed acyclic graphs are different\nimplementations of the network model, though. Neurons represent events\nthat occur or not: they are two-valued. Nodes represent variables that\ncan take two, three, or even continuously many values. Synapses\nrepresent actual causation. Links represent lines of possible causal\ninfluence, and do not entail any actual causation between the actual\nvalues of their variables. See Hitchcock 2007b for comparisons and\nreasons to favor the causal modeling approach.)  \nConnection: What is the metaphysical basis for causal\nconnection? That is, what is the difference between causally related\nand causally unrelated sequences? \nThe question of connection occupies the bulk of the vast literature on\ncausation. One finds analyses of causation in terms of nomological\nsubsumption (Davidson 1980d, Kim 1973, Horwich 1987, Armstrong\n1999), statistical correlation (Good 1961 and 1962, Suppes\n1970, Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines 1993, Kvart 1997 and 2004, Pearl\n2000, Hitchcock 2001), counterfactual dependence (Lewis 1986a\nand 2000, Swain 1978, Menzies 1989b, McDermott 1995 and 2002, Ganeri,\nNoordhof, and Ramachandran 1996, Yablo 2002, Sartorio 2005),\nagential manipulability (Collingwood 1940, Gasking 1955, von\nWright 1975, Price and Menzies 1993, Woodward 2003), contiguous\nchange (Ducasse 1926), energy flow (Fair 1979, Castaneda\n1984), physical processes (Russell 1948, Salmon 1984 and\n1998, Dowe 1992 and 2000), and property transference (Aronson\n1971, Ehring 1997, Kistler 1998). One also finds views that are\nhybrids of some of the above (Fair 1979, Dowe 2000, Paul\n2000, Schaffer 2001, Hall 2004, Beebee 2004b), along with\nprimitivism (Anscombe 1975, Tooley 1987 and 2004, Carroll\n1994, Menzies 1996) and even eliminativism (Russell 1992,\nQuine 1966). \nFortunately, the details of these many and various accounts may be\npostponed here, as they tend to be variations on two basic themes. In\npractice, the nomological, statistical, counterfactual, and agential\naccounts tend to converge in the indeterministic case. All understand\nconnection in terms of probability: causing is making more\nlikely. The change, energy, process, and transference accounts\nconverge in treating connection in terms of process: causing\nis physical producing. Thus a large part of the controversy over\nconnection may, in practice, be reduced to the question of whether\nconnection is a matter of probability or process (Section 2.1). \nDirection: What is the metaphysical basis for causal\ndirection? That is, what is the difference between sequences related\nas cause to effect and those related as effect to cause or as effect\nto joint effect of a common cause? \nThe standard view on the direction of causation is that it reduces to\nthe direction of time: causes occur prior to their effects (Hume 1975,\nKant 1965, Beauchamp and Rosenberg 1981). The temporal view has fallen\ninto disfavor of late, and a number of alternatives have been\nsuggested, for instance, that the causal direction is the direction of\nforking ( Reichenbach 1956, Horwich 1987, Papineau 1993, Dowe\n2000), overdetermination (Lewis 1979), independence\n(Hausman 1998), and manipulation (von Wright 1975, Price 1991\nand 1996, Woodward 2003). On these alternative views, the coincidence\nof the causal and temporal orders is merely a contingent feature of\nthe actual world, or at least a typical feature of our patch of it. So\nthe question arises as to whether the causal direction is the temporal\ndirection, or something else (Section 2.2). \nSelection: What is the metaphysical basis for causal\nselection? That is, what is the difference between cause to effect\nsequences involving real causes, and those involving mere background\nconditions? \nThe standard view on selection is that there is no objective\nbasis for selection: selection is interest-driven, pragmatic, and\nunsystematic (Mill 1846, Lewis 1986a, Mackie 1974). This\nno-objective-basis view is occasionally challenged, and alternatives\nhave been suggested such as sufficient versus\nnecessary (Ducasse 1926) and abnormal versus\nnormal (Hart and Honore 1985). The question thus arises as to\nwhether there is any objective difference between “triggering\nconditions” and “mere background conditions”\n(Section 2.3). \nPresuppositions: The dispute over the causal\nconnection involves a presupposition of uniqueness; there has\nto be a unique metaphysical relation of causal connectedness\nfor there to be a question of that relation's nature. Yet, it might be\nargued, ordinary language allows for a range of irreducible causal\nnotions, such as “scrape,” “push,”\n“wet,” “carry,” “eat,” etc.\n(Anscombe 1975, p. 68) Why not take ordinary language at its word, and\nadopt a form of causal pluralism on which ‘cause’ is\nviewed as providing a merely nominal grouping of metaphysically\ndiverse relations? \nOne might defend uniqueness by arguing that scraping, pushing, wetting\nand the others have a real (more than nominal) unity. They have common\nstatistical, counterfactual, predictive, explanatory, and moral\nimplications. Or one might defend uniqueness as a theoretical ideal.\nEven if our actual concept of causation is ultimately what Skyrms\n(1984) calls an “amiable jumble” of principles (see also\nSober 1985, and Hall 2004), this might be taken as a call for\nconceptual revision. Why wallow in the jumble, instead of tidying\nit? \nQuestion: What is the basis for causal connection? Is\nit a matter of probability, process, or some hybrid thereof? Is causal\nconnection primitive and irreducible? Or is the entire notion merely a\nfolk myth?  \nThe probability and process views appear subject to a number of\nsystematic problems, including the problems of preemption and\nfizzling for probability views, and disconnection\nand misconnection for process views (Section 2.1.1). These\nproblems force the views to evolve and might be seen as motivating the\nhybrid, primitivist, and eliminativist alternatives (Section\n2.1.2). \nPreemption: One problem case for the probability\nview, on which the root idea of causation is that of making more\nlikely, is the case of preemption (Good 1961 and 1962, Lewis\n1986a, Menzies 1989b, Collins, Hall, and Paul 2004, Paul and Hall 2013\ninter alia). Suppose that Pam and Bob each aim a brick at a\nwindow. Pam throws and shatters the window, while Bob holds his throw\non seeing Pam in action. It seems that Pam's throw caused the window\nto shatter — her brick is what crashes through the glass. But it\ndoes not need to be the case that Pam's throw raised the probability\nof the shattering — if Bob is a more reliable vandal, then Pam's\nthrow might even have made the shattering less likely. So it\nseems that probability-raising is not necessary for causation. \nThis sort of preemption (an early cutting) can be represented\nby the following neuron diagram: \nA filled circle doubly represents a neuron firing and an event\noccurring. The line with a circular arrowhead doubly represents an\ninhibitory connection and a prevention. \nProbability theorists have responded to preemption with three main\nstrategies, the first of which is to factor intermediaries\n(Lewis 1986a, Menzies 1989, Eells 1991, Ramachandran 1997, Kvart 1997,\nNoordhof 1999, Pearl 2000, Yablo 2002). This approach looks to the\ncourse of intermediary events or probability evolutions to find some\nsense in which the preempting cause is indeed a probability-raiser.\nFor instance, if one holds fixed the fact that Bob holds his throw,\nthen it might seem that Pam's throwing becomes a probability-raiser\nafter all. The second response that probability theorists offer to\npreemption is to require precision (Rosen 1978, Lewis 1986a,\nPaul 2000, Coady 2004). This approach looks to the exact time and\nmanner of the events involved to try to find differences due to the\npreempting cause. For instance, if one considers the exact time and\nmanner of the window shattering, then it might seem that Pam's\nthrowing was a probability-raiser all along. The third response is to\nconsider intrinsic structure (Lewis 1986a, Menzies 1996, Hall\n2004) This approach looks to the intrinsic structure of the preempting\nprocess to try to find some sense in which the preempting process\n— even if it does not itself involve probability-raising —\nis at least intrinsically right for probability-raising.  \nIt is unclear how far these three strategies extend. There is a vast\nliterature on preemption involving a dizzying array of varied\ncounterexamples and revised analyses. See Paul and Hall for an\nexcellent guide to the “thick undergrowth of such\nexamples” (2013, p. 5). It is fair to say that no currently\navailable account is able to handle every case. \nFor a particularly difficult case, it has been argued that there can\nbe preemption with no intermediaries to factor or differences to be\nprecise about or intrinsic failure of the preempted backup, in cases\nof trumping (Schaffer 2000a, Lewis 2000). Suppose that the\nlaws of magic say that the first spell cast on a given day matches the\nenchantment that midnight. Merlin casts a spell (the first that day)\nto turn the prince into a frog, Morgana casts a spell (the second that\nday) to turn the prince into a frog, and at midnight the prince turns\ninto a frog. It seems that Merlin's spell caused the prince to turn\ninto a frog — his spell was the first cast that day, and that's\nwhat the laws of magic identify as the relevant feature. Only Merlin's\nspell satisfies the antecedent conditions of the imagined law of\nnature. But it does not need to be the case that Merlin's spell raised\nthe probability of the enfrogging — if Morgana is the more\nreliable wizard, then the chance of the enfrogging would have been\ngreater has Merlin left the job to Morgana. It does not need to be the\ncase that there are any intermediary events at all in the story\n— the magic might as well work directly. And it does not need to\nbe the case that there would have been any differences in what befalls\nthe prince had Merlin left it to Morgana. And finally, there does not\nseem to be any difference in “intrinsic aptness” between\nMerlin's and Morgana's spell. In fact the only relevant difference\nbetween these spells seems to be the extrinsic matter of which was\ncast first. \nThis sort of trumping preemption can be represented by the following\nneuron diagram (Paul and Hall 2013): \nHere we suppose that neurons can fire in various colors (representing\nvarious possible spells), and that by law, when a neuron receives\nmultiple stimulations, it fires in the color matching that of the\nbiggest neuron (representing the first spell that day) stimulating\nit. \nA third response that some probability theorists have advocated is to\nbite the bullet. Here it might be maintained that the effect occurred\nnot because of, but despite, the preemptor (Eells 1991,\nMellor 1995). Or it might be maintained that, at least in certain\ncases, the “preempted backup” is actually an\noverdetermining cause. For instance, Hitchcock (2011) argues that a\ncontrastive approach to causation allows one to capture much of the\nintuitive asymmetry of trumping cases, while still counting the\ntrumped event (Morgana's spell) as an overdetermining cause of the\noutcome (the prince becoming a frog).  \nFizzling: A second problem case for the probability\nview is fizzling. Suppose that Pam and Fred each aim a brick\nat a window. Pam throws and shatters the window, while Fred simply\nwalks away, or throws wide, or is preempted by Pam. It seems that\nFred's aiming did not cause the window to shatter — Fred's brick\nnever touched the glass. But it might be the case that Fred's aiming\ndid raise the probability of the shattering — if there was some\nnon-zero chance that Fred would succeed, and some non-one chance that\nPam would succeed, then Fred's aiming might well have placed the\nwindow in greater danger. So it seems that probability-raising is not\nsufficient for causation. \nThe version of fizzling in which Fred is preempted can of course be\nrepresented by the early cutting neuron diagram above, with Fred\nstanding in for Bob. \nProbability theorists have responded to fizzling with the same\nstrategies as for preemption, namely factoring intermediaries,\nrequiring precision, or looking at intrinsic aptness (Menzies 1989b,\nHitchcock 2004, Kvart 2004). For instance, if one holds fixed the fact\nthat Fred throws wide, then it might seem that Fred's throwing is not\na probability-raiser after all. Or if one considers the exact time and\nmanner of the window shattering, then it might seem that Fred's\nthrowing was not a probability-raiser after all. Or if one looks at\nthe intrinsic character of the Fred process, then it might seem as if\nthis process was intrinsically not apt to cause the window\nshattering. \nIt is unclear how far these three strategies extend. One might think\nthat there can be fizzlings with no intermediaries to factor or\ndifferences to be precise about or intrinsic defectivness of the\nfizzled non-cause, in cases of overlapping (Schaffer 2000b).\nSuppose that Merlin casts a spell with a .5 chance of turning the king\nand prince into frogs; Morgana casts a spell with an independent .5\nchance of turning the prince and queen into frogs; and the king and\nprince, but not the queen, then turn into frogs. It seems that\nMorgana's spell did not cause the prince to turn into a frog —\nthe fact that the queen was unaffected shows that Morgana's spell\nfizzled. But it is the case that Morgana's spell raised the\nprobability of the prince turning into a frog. Moreover it need not be\nthe case that there are any intermediary events in the story at all\n(the magic might as well work directly). It need not be the case that\nthere would have been any differences in what befalls the prince had\nMorgana's spell taken hold rather than Merlin's. And it need not be\nthe case that Morgana's spell was intrinsically defective in any way\n(indeed it is only the external circumstance of the queen being\nunaffected that reveals that Morgana's spell fizzled).  \nThis sort of overlapping case can be represented by the following\nneuron diagram: \nHere an arc with a number represents a conjunctive effect with a\ncertain probability. \nPreemption and fizzling cases together might be taken to show that\nprobability-raising (however interpreted and refined) is\nsystematically unable to provide necessary or sufficient conditions\nfor causation. Moreover, these cases might suggest that connection is\na matter of processes (be they physical or magical) rather than\nprobabilities. The preempting cause and the effect are linked by a\nprocess, while the fizzled non-cause and the effect are not —\njust look at the diagrams. As Armstrong writes: “Where there is\nan arrow in a diagram showing that one neuron brings it about that\nanother neuron fired, or is rendered incapable of firing, take it that\nhere there is a genuine two-term relation of singular causation\nholding between cause and effect. Where there is no such arrow, deny\nthat there is any such relation. This is the open door” (2004,\np. 446).  \nBut the process view faces problem cases of its own. \nDisconnection: One problem case for the process view,\non which the root idea of causation is that of physical connection, is\ndisconnection (Ehring 1984, Schaffer 2000c, Lewis 2004, Hall\n2004). Suppose that Pam catapults her brick through the window rather\nthan throwing it. Then it seems that Pam's catapulting the brick\ncauses the window to shatter — can it really matter here whether\nPam catapults the brick or throws it? But there need be no process\nconnecting Pam's releasing the lever and the flight of the brick\nthrough the window — no relevant energy-momentum flow, track of\nmark transmission, or persisting trope connects them. Rather what is\nhappening here is that the cocked catapult is prevented from launching\nby the catch, and Pam's releasing the lever prevents the catch from\npreventing the launch — the catapult is thus unleashed. The\nprocess of launch is purely internal to the catapult. \nThis sort of disconnection case can be represented by the following\nneuron diagram: \nThe main reply that is made to disconnections is to deny that they are\ngenuinely causal. In this vein, Aronson says: “Consider a weight\nthat is attached to a stretched spring. At a certain time, the catch\nthat holds the spring taut is released, and the weight immediately\nbegins to accelerate. One might be tempted to say that the release of\nthe catch was the cause of the weight's acceleration. If so, then what\ndid the release of the catch transfer to the weight? Nothing, of\ncourse.” (1971, p. 425; see also Dowe 2001, Hall 2004) Indeed,\nsince disconnections look to involve preventions of\nwould-be-preventers, and since prevention looks to involve absences,\none might reject causation by disconnection for the general reason\nthat there is no absence causation (Moore 2009). For instance, one\nmight deny that any causal connection can run through the absence of\nthe catch. \nMisconnection: A second problem case for the process\nview is misconnection (Hitchcock 1995b, Dowe 2000, Schaffer\n2001). Suppose that Pam throws her brick through the window, while\ninnocent Tom watches in dismay, or sprays purple paint in the air\nthrough which Pam's brick passes. Then it seems that Tom's watching or\npaint-spraying does not cause the window shattering. But there is a\nprocess connecting Tom's watching or paint-spraying to the shattering.\nWhen Tom watches there will be photons connecting him to the\nshattering. When Tom sprays paint at the brick there will be a track\nof purple paint from Tom's spray can to the brick to the window.\n(Misconnections might be subdivided into micro-connections,\nwhich are of the wrong magnitude such as the photons, and\npseudo-connections, which are of the wrong sort such as the\npaint.) \nOne finds two main replies to misconnections in the literature, the\nfirst of which is to bite the bullet. In the case of the photon\nconnection from Tom's watching to the window shattering (and\nmicro-connections generally), this might be regarded as causation of\nsuch negligible proportions that it is understandable that we might\nneglect it. Our intuitions to the contrary might also be written off,\nDavidson style, as confusing the causal and explanatory idioms.  \nThe second main reply one finds to misconnections is to fine-grain the\nprocesses involved. In the case of the paint connection from Tom's\nspraying to the window shattering, the line of paint persistence and\nthe line of brick flying through the window might be regarded as\ndistinct and merely coincident (Dowe 2000). In this way it might be\ndenied that there is a genuine process connecting the misconnecting\nnon-cause and the effect. \nDisconnection and misconnection cases together might be taken to show\nthat process-linkage (however interpreted and refined) is\nsystematically unable to provide necessary or sufficient conditions\nfor causation. Moreover, these cases might suggest that connection is\na matter of probabilities rather than processes. The disconnecting\ncause (such as Pam's release of the catapult) and the effect are\nlinked by probability, while the misconnecting non-cause (such as\nTom's bystanding or spray painting) and the effect are not. So the\nprobability theorist might claim revenge. But one might also draw the\nlarger moral that the probability and process views are at best\naspects of a bigger picture. This might inspire the search for a\nhybrid view. \nHybrids: Given the intuitive plausibility of the\nprobability and process views, and the systematic problems each\nencounters, some recent theorists have sought reconciliation. Hybrid\nviews aim to synthesize the probability and process views, capturing\nwhat is intuitively right about both ideas while resolving their\nproblem cases. \nThe most obvious hybrid views simply conjoin or disjoin the\nprobability and process views, or posit an ambiguity between the\nnotions (Hall 2004). With respect to the above four problem cases,\nhowever, this might seem unpromising. Requiring both probability and\nprocess will resolve fizzlings and misconnections (Salmon 1997), as\nthe former involves no process-linkage and the latter no\nprobability-raising. But for the same reason it will not resolve\npreemptions and disconnections, as the former involves no\nprobability-raising and the latter no process-linkage. (The\nconjunctive theorist might still avail herself of one of the above\nreplies to preemption and disconnection.) Likewise requiring either\nprobability or process will resolve preemptions and disconnections,\nbut not fizzlings and misconnections. (The disjunctive theorist might\nstill avail herself of one of the above replies to those\nproblems.) \nMore sophisticated hybrid views attempt to integrate the\nnotions of probability and process, and not merely conjoin or disjoin\nthem. Thus Fair (1979) ultimately moves from an energy flow view to a\nview that understands connection in terms of counterfactuals about\nenergy flow. And Schaffer (2001) suggests a generalization of this\napproach, on which causal connection is understood in terms of the\nprobabilities of processes. This sort of hybrid view might seem to\nresolve all of the above problem cases. The preempting cause and\ndisconnecting cause do raise the probability of the process that\nproduces the effect; the fizzled non-cause and misconnecting non-cause\ndo not.  \nHowever this sort of hybrid view has trouble with\n“hybridized” problem cases such as the following (Schaffer\n2001). Suppose that Pam throws a brick through the wall of an\naquarium, preempting Bob from doing the same. The aquarium shattering\nthen causes the soaking of the carpet, by preventing the glass from\npreventing the water from spilling. This is a preemption case fed into\na disconnection case. It seems that Pam's throw caused the soaking of\nthe carpet — her brick is what broke the aquarium. But it need\nnot be the case that Pam's throw raised the probability of the process\nproducing the soaking — if Bob is a more reliable vandal, then\nPam's throw might have even lowered the chance of the spillage\nprocess, by preempting Bob. And it might also be the case that Bob's\naiming raised the probability of the process producing the soaking\n— Bob's aiming might have raised the chance of the spillage\nprocess, by threatening the aquarium. \n(Such a case also makes trouble for the Hall style “two\nconcepts” view, since Pam's throw turns out to satisfy\nneither of the two concepts of causation Hall reports.) This\nsort of preemptive disconnection case can be represented by the\nfollowing neuron diagram: \nThe current literature on causation is now suffused with complex\nhybrid cases, including cases of preemptive prevention (McDermott\n1995, Collins 2000), disconnections inside larger chains (Hall 2004),\nand a variety of devious preemption variants (Paul and Hall 2013). No\nknown account of causation — hybrid or otherwise — gets\nall of these cases right. So it is unclear what hybrid accounts gain\nin the end. \nPrimitivism: The problems encountered by attempts to\nanalyze causal connection provide one main argument for primitivism.\nThere seems to be a pattern of failure, which might suggest that\ncausation is simply unanalyzable. \nThe second main argument for primitivism is that causation is too\ncentral to reduce. The probability and process accounts (and by\nextension hybrids) are said to be inevitably circular, because the\nnotions of probability and process cannot be understood without\nreference to causation. As to probability, each of the nomological,\nstatistical, counterfactual, and agential versions of the theory might\nbe thought to harbor causal notions. The causal relation might be\nrequired to distinguish real laws from accidental generalizations\n(Armstrong 1997), to distinguish which background conditions must be\nheld fixed in statistical assessment from which may vary (Cartwright\n1983), to distinguish which background conditions may be held fixed in\ncounterfactual supposition from which may vary (Kvart 1986), and to\nunderstand the notion of agential intervention (Hausman 1998). As to\nprocess, it might be thought that a process is nothing more than a\ncausal sequence; in the words of Sayre: “The causal process,\ncontinuous though it may be, is made up of individual events related\nto others in a causal nexus… It is by virtue of the relations\namong members of causal series that we are enabled to make the\ninferences by which causal processes are characterized.” (1977,\np. 206) \nIndeed, the primitivist might add that the notion of event (or\nwhatever the causal relata is taken to be) cannot be understood\nwithout reference to causation, because properties themselves are\nindividuated by their causal roles (Shoemaker 1980 and 1998, Ellis\n1999). As Carroll remarks in this regard, “With regard to our\ntotal conceptual apparatus, causation is at the center of the\ncenter.” (1994, p. 118) So one might think that analysis is\nimpossible because we have no more basic concepts. \nAs a third main argument for primitivism, it has been argued that\nthere are worlds that differ purely causally (Armstrong 1983, Tooley\n1987, and Carroll 1994). Suppose that it is a law of magic that all\nspells have a .5 chance of taking hold, that Merlin and Morgana each\ncast a spell to turn the prince into a frog at midnight, and that the\nprince turns into a frog at midnight. Then it may be intuited that\nthere are three distinct possibilities: one in which only Merlin's\nspell caused the enfrogging, a second in which only Morgana's spell\ndid it, and a third in which both did. These possibilities feature the\nsame laws and pattern of events. So one might claim to intuit that\ncausation is ontologically fundamental. \nBut there also three main arguments against primitivism, the first of\nwhich traces back to Hume and maintains that primitivism conflicts\nwith the existence of causal knowledge. After all, one might argue (in\na Humean vein) that all we can observe are sequences of events; as\nsuch, we could never come to know any facts about causal connection if\nconnection is anything over and above such sequences. To this the\nprimitivist might reply, either that primitive connections can be\ndirectly observed, at least in certain favorable cases such as willing\nor pressure on the body (Anscombe 1975, Strawson 1985, Fales 1990,\nArmstrong 1997); or that primitive connections can be theoretically\ninferred via inference to the best explanation (Tooley 1987). \nThe second main argument against primitivism is that primitive\ncausation is a spooky sort of primitive modality. To the extent that\ncausal relations are supposed to be necessary connections in\nnature, and to the extent that one generally favors the reduction of\nthe modal to the occurrent, one will have a general reason to resist\nany causal primitivism. \nThe third main argument against primitivism is that it leads to\neliminativism. For if the options are irreducible causation or none,\none should ask whether ‘none’ might be the better choice.\nFor if science provides the criterion for which basic contingent\nentities one ought recognize, then the question must arise as to\nwhether one could do science without any causal primitive whatsoever.\nOne might conclude that our folk notion of causation must either\nreduce or face elimination. \nEliminativism: The final view of causal connection to\nconsider is the eliminativist view, as trumpeted by Russell:\n“The law of causation,… is a relic of a bygone age,\nsurviving, like the monarchy, only because it is erroneously supposed\nto do no harm.” (1992, p. 193) The eliminativist views the\ncausal concept as a naively animistic projection of agency onto the\nworld, to be superseded in a sophisticated scientific scheme. \nThe main argument for eliminativism is that science has no need of\ncausation. The notion of causation is seen as a scientifically\nretrograde relic of Stone Age metaphysics. As Russell claims,\n“In the motions of mutually gravitating bodies, there is nothing\nthat can be called a cause, and nothing that can be called an effect;\nthere is merely a formula.” (1992, p. 202, see also Quine 1966)\nThe differential equations of sophisticated physics are said to leave\nno room for causes, or at least to have no need of them. \nRussell's argument might be effective against a primitivist treatment\nof causation, but the reductivist may reply that causation still\nreduces to scientifically respectable entities. In this respect,\n‘event,’ ‘law,’ ‘cause,’ and\n‘explanation’ are in the same boat. These nomic terms\nserve to allow a systematic understanding of science; they do not\nthemselves appear in the equations. From this perspective, Russell's\nargument might seem akin to the foolish claim that math has eliminated\nthe variable, because the term ‘variable’ does not appear\nin the equations! \nThe main objection to eliminativism is that causation is too central\nto eliminate. Causation, according to various contemporary\nphilosophers, is required for the analysis of metaphysical concepts\nsuch as persistence, scientific concepts such as explanation and\ndisposition, epistemic concepts such as perception and warrant,\nethical concepts such as action and responsibility, mental concepts\nsuch as functional role and conceptual content, and linguistic\nconcepts such as reference. Elimination is not just unjustified; it\nwould be catastrophic. So it might seem that the arguments against\nprimitivism and eliminativism bring one back to a reductive account of\ncausation, and thus back again to probability and process, and their\ndescendants. \nThough perhaps there is some middle ground between the hopeless task\nof conceptual analysis on the one hand, and the conceptual disaster of\nprimitivism/eliminativism on the other. For one should not confuse the\nprospects for conceptual analysis with the prospects for ontic\nreduction. It could well be that our concept of causation —\nsomething in the mind — is not definable via other concepts (in\nany way that would count as an informative conceptual analysis). Yet\nit could also be that the causal relation — an entity out in the\nworld — is not a fundamental constituent of reality. This middle\nposition would claim to explain both the failures of conceptual\nanalyses, and the disappearance of causation from fundamental physics.\n(See Schaffer 2007, pp. 872–873) for some further\ndiscussion.) \nQuestion: What is the basis for causal direction? Is\nit a matter of temporal direction, or something else such as the\ndirection of forking, the direction of overdetermination, the\ndirection of independence, or the direction of manipulation? Is causal\ndirectedness a primitive, irreducible affair? Or is the belief in\ncausal directedness merely a folk myth, or perhaps a projection of our\nexperience as human agents onto an undirected world?  \nIn practice, one finds six main arguments on the question of whether\nto identify causal direction with temporal direction. First, there is\nthe argument from bilking, which maintains that the causal\norder must be the temporal order, or else the effect might occur but\nthe cause then get prevented. Second, there is the argument from\ntime travel, which maintains that the causal order must not\nbe the temporal order because of the possibility of time travel.\nThird, there is the argument from simultaneous causation,\nwhich maintains that the causal order must not be the temporal order\nbecause of the possibility of cause and effect being contemporaneous.\nFourth, there is the argument from joint effects, which\nmaintains that it will not help to analyze the causal order as the\ntemporal order because there are joint effect cases in which there is\na temporally ordered connection without causation. Fifth, there is the\nargument from physics, which maintains that the causal order\nmust not be the temporal order because of various physical hypotheses\ninvolving backwards causation. Sixth, there is the argument from\nthe causal theory of time, which maintains that the causal\norder is the temporal order, but only because the temporal order is to\nbe analyzed in terms of the causal order, not vica versa. \nBilking: The main argument for the causal order being\nthe temporal order is the bilking argument (Black 1956). The argument\nis explained by Mackie, with reference to a backward causal hypothesis\nthat a drawing made by an alleged clairovoyant on Monday might be\ncaused be a pattern made Tuesday: “But on every occasion, after\nthe drawing is made, it is possible that someone or something should\nintervene so that the corresponding pattern fails to be produced.\nConsequently, it cannot on any occasion be the pattern that is\nresponsible for the details of the drawing: the precognition\nhypothesis must be false even for those occasions when the device is\nnot stopped, when the pattern is actually produced and turns out to be\njust like the drawing.” (1974, p. 178) So temporally backwards\ncausation is said to be impossible.  \nThere are two main replies to the bilking argument. The first, due to\nDummett (1964), is to note that the argument only applies to cases in\nwhich human intervention is possible. What is there to prevent\nbackwards causation when human intervention is ruled out? \nThe second main reply to the bilking argument is that it involves an\nincoherent mix of determinism and indeterminism. If the world is\ndeterministic, then the bilking intervention is impossible, as it will\nalready be fixed that the later cause will occur. If the world is\nindeterministic, then the bilking intervention is possible but no\nlonger problematic, as the case will then reduce to one in which the\nearlier event (e. g., the clairvoyant's drawing) is an uncaused\nindeterministic eruption. \nTime Travel: The first main argument against the\ncausal order being the temporal order is that temporally backwards\ncausation is possible in cases such as time travel. It seems\nmetaphysically possible that a time traveler enters a time machine at\ntime t1, thus causing her to exit the time machine\nat some earlier time t0. Indeed, this looks to be\nnomologically possible, since Gödel has proved that there are\nsolutions to Einstein's field equations that permit looping pathways:\n“By making a round trip on a rocket ship it is possible [in\nworlds governed by Einstein's field equations] to travel into any\nregion of the past, present, and future and back again, exactly as it\nis possible in other worlds to travel into distant parts of\nspace.” (1949, p. 560) \nThere are three main replies to the time travel argument. The first\nreply is that time travel is incoherent. A variety of\nincoherencies might be alleged here, including the incoherency of\nchanging what is already fixed (causing the past), of being both able\nand unable to kill one's own ancestors, or of generating a causal loop\nand thus a reflexive relation of “self-causation”, or of\ngenerating inconsistent probability assignments (Mellor 1995). The\nGödelian proof might be dismissed as a mere mathematical\nartifact, not reflecting any possible situation. \nThe second reply to the time travel argument is that time travel may\nstill take place through locally forward causal steps.\nIndeed, this is exactly what happens in the nomologically possible\ncases discovered by Gödel; spacetime is topologically structured\nin such a way that a series of locally forward steps produces a\nglobally backwards path. This is compatible with the causal order\nbeing the temporal order, at least at each particular step. It may be\nthat both the causal order and the temporal order can fail to possess\nglobal orientation. \nThe third reply to the time travel argument is that any alleged case\nof time travel is open to forward redescription. Instead of\nthe time traveler entering the machine at t1 and\nexiting at t0, the same situation may be\nredescribed in terms of the spontaneous creation at\nt0 of one individual, and the spontaneous\ndisappearance at t1 of another, with merely\ncoincidental correlations between their various mental and physical\nstates. \nSimultaneous Causation: The second main argument\nagainst the causal order being the temporal order is that\nsimultaneous causation is possible. Indeed, it might seem\nthat simultaneous causation occurs in the actual world, for instance\nwhen an iron ball depresses a cushion (Kant 1965, Taylor 1966, Brand\n1980).  \nThe main reply to the simultaneous causation argument is that the\ncases appearing to exemplify it are misdescribed (Mellor\n1995). The iron ball takes time to depress the cushion, and in general\nall bodies take time to communicate their motions. There are no\nperfectly rigid bodies, at least in any nomologically possible world.\nWithout the intuitive support of this sort of case, the simultaneous\ncausation argument may be charged with begging the question. At this\npoint methodological issues about the relevance of conceivable but\nphysically impossible cases may arise.  \nPhysics: The third main argument against the causal\norder being the temporal order is the argument from physics.\nPhysicists of the past century have entertained a variety of theories\npositing backward causation, including the Wheeler-Feynman theory of\nradiation, Feynman's tachyon theory and his theory of positrons as\nelectrons moving backwards in time, and de Beauregard's “quantum\nhandshake” explanation of the violation of the Bell\ninequalities. While none of these theories enjoys much credence today,\nthat they were serious physical hypotheses (at least once) seems to\nestablish that they at least might have been true (Horwich 1987, Dowe\n2000). \nThere are two main replies to the argument from physics, the first of\nwhich is to dismiss these theories. Perhaps these theories\nare all in the end false or even subtly incoherent. Here the\npossibility of forward redescription alluded to with time travel is\nsalient, in that the defender of the temporal order may hold that\nforward redescription is always possible, and always preferable. \nThe second reply to the argument from physics is that it\noverextends. There may be no coherent account of the causal\norder compatible with all these theories. In particular, the backwards\ncausal model of the violation of the Bell inequalities postulates a\nbackwards causal arrow that, it would seem, is neither the tine of a\npast-open fork, nor a special overdeterminer of the future, nor a\nhandle to manipulate the past. So the argument from physics might\nculminate in a general tu quoque. \nA different sort of argument from physics looks not to theories\npositing backwards causation, but rather to the lack of any relevant\nasymmetries (temporal or otherwise) in advanced physics. From this it\nis inferred that reality itself may be temporally symmetric, and that\nany sense of a direction to causal relations is due to a\nprojection of our experience as agents (Price 1996 and 2007).\nAlternatively it might be argued that physics does supply a real\ndirection — perhaps via Albert's “Past Hypothesis”\n(Albert 2000, Loewer 2007, Kutach 2007) — but one that is only\ncontingently connected to the direction of time.  \nJoint Effects: The third main argument against the\ncausal order being the temporal order is the problem of joint effects\n(Lewis 1986a). Suppose that the fall in atmospheric pressure at\nt0 causes both the dip in the barometer at\nt1 and the storm at t2. Then\nthe dip in the barometer and the storm are causally connected and\ntemporally ordered, yet this is not causation, but rather a case of\njoint effects of a common cause. \nThis case may be represented by the following neuron diagram: \nHere the left-to-right order represents the temporal order. \nThere are two main replies to the argument from joint effects, the\nfirst of which is to add some further test for a joint effect\nstructure, such as the screening off test (Reichenbach 1956,\nSuppes 1970, inter alia). The causal direction is then taken\nas the unscreened temporal direction. \nThe second main reply to the argument from joint effects is to\nrestrict the temporal order view to cases of direct connection. As the\nneuron diagram suggests, joint effects are only indirectly connected,\nvia their common cause (Horwich 1987). If one can identify the direct\nconnections and apply the temporal order to these only, one would have\nan arrow from the drop in atmospheric pressure to the dip in the\nbarometer as well as to the storm, but no arrow from barometer to\nstorm. This would match the diagram. \nCausal Theory of Time: A final argument to consider\nis the argument that the temporal order is to be analyzed in terms of\nthe causal order, not vice versa (Kant 1965, Reichenbach\n1956, Mellor 1981). This argument cuts both ways, in the sense that it\nentails that the causal order is the temporal order (contra\nthe arguments from time travel, simultaneous causation, and physics),\nbut also entails that the causal order cannot be based on the\ntemporal order on pain of circularity. \nThe main reply to the argument from the causal theory of time is, of\ncourse, to reject the causal theory of time. The temporal direction\nwill have to be understood in other terms, perhaps in terms of\nintrinsic physical asymmetries such as involved with entropy or with\nthe decay of the neutral kaon, or perhaps simply taken as primitive\n(Maudlin 2007). Though to the extent that one takes the direction of\nprimitive, there is a temptation to put this primitive to work to the\nextent possible, including understanding causal direction. \nQuestion: What is the basis for causal selection? Is\nthe distinction between real causes and mere background conditions\nmerely an arbitrary and unsystematic affair? Or is there a\nmetaphysical basis for selection having to do with sufficiency versus\nnecessity, abnormality versus normality, or anything else? \n(It should be noted that selection is widely associated with the idea\nof “the cause”. This is perhaps a mistake. We often select\nmultiple causes which act together. For instance, in a case of\njoint causation when the four movers collectively lug the\npiano up the stairs, it would be natural to select each individual\nmover's efforts as a real cause of the piano reaching the second floor\n(thereby selecting four real causes), all the while demoting various\nfactors like the presence of the staircase to the status of being\nbackground conditions. ‘The cause’, relative to a given\ncontext, simply refers to something like the most salient cause at the\ncontext, just like ‘the dog’ refers to something like the\nmost salient dog at the context; that is all a matter of what\n‘the’ means and nothing at all to do with causation, or\nwith dogs for that matter.) \nIn practice, one finds four main arguments on the question of\nselection. First, there is the argument from caprice, which maintains\nthat our actual practice of selection is too capricious to have any\nreal basis. Second, there is the argument from predictability, which\nmaintains that our actual practice of selection is too predictable to\nbe without a real basis. Third, there is the argument from\ninseparability, which maintains that we have no concept of causation\nthat subtracts selection. Fourth, there is the argument from adicity\nrevisited, which alleges that additional relata might reconcile the\npreceding three arguments.  \nCaprice: The main argument for the no-basis view is\nMill's argument from caprice: “Nothing can better show the\nabsence of any scientific ground for the distinction between the cause\nof a phenomena and its conditions, than the capricious manner in which\nwe select from among the conditions that which we choose to denominate\nthe cause.” (1846, p. 198) Mill's argument has won the field,\nand is echoed by contemporary authors such as Lewis: “We\nsometimes single out one among all the cause of some event and call it\n‘the’ cause, as if there were no others. Or we single out\na few as the ‘causes’, calling the rest mere ‘causal\nfactors’ or ‘causal conditions’… We may\nselect the abnormal or extraordinary causes, or those under human\ncontrol, or those we deem good or bad, or just those we want to talk\nabout. I have nothing to say about these principles of invidious\ndiscrimination.” (1986, p. 162) Thus selection is now generally\ndismissed as groundless, and theorists seek to isolate some\npre-selected, egalitarian conception of causation. \nPredictability: The main argument against the\nno-basis view maintains that our selections are too predictable to be\nwithout a basis. This point has been made by Hart and Honore, who\nwrite: “In most cases where a fire has broken out the lawyer,\nthe historian, and the plain man would refuse to say that the cause of\nthe fire was the presence of oxygen, though no fire would have\noccurred without it: they would reserve the title of cause for\nsomething of the order of a short-circuit, the dropping of a lighted\ncigarette, or lightning… In making this distinction it is plain\nthat our choice, though responsive to the varying context of the\nparticular occasions, is not arbitrary or haphazard.” (1985, p.\n11) \nBut what could this distinction between causes and conditions be?\nDucasse maintains that it is between sufficient causes and necessary\nconditions: “As a matter of established usage,\n‘cause’ is contrasted with ‘condition’ in a\nserviceable and clearly stated manner: The cause of a\nphenomenon is a change in its antecedent circumstances which was\nsufficient to bring it about. A condition of a\nphenomenon, on the other hand, is a change, or more frequently a\nstate, of its antecedent circumstances which was necessary to\nits having occurred when it did.” (1969. p. 19) But it is\ndifficult to see how this captures our selection of the short-circuit\nover the presence of oxygen, as each factor seems necessary and\nneither sufficient. \nHart and Honore maintain that abnormal situations and free actions are\ncauses, while normal situations and non-agential factors are\nconditions: “In distinguishing between causes and conditions two\ncontrasts are of prime importance. These are the contrasts between\nwhat is abnormal and what is normal in relation to any given thing or\nsubject matter, and between a free deliberate action and all other\nconditions.” (1985, p. 33) This seems to do better with respect\nto the short-circuit (abnormal) versus the presence of oxygen\n(normal), but at the price of such vagueness that one might think it\nonly verbally distinct from the no-basis view. \nInseparability: A further argument against the\nno-basis view is that we have no concept of causation without\nselection. As Hart and Honore put it: “The contrast of cause\nwith mere conditions is an inseparable feature of all causal thinking,\nand constitutes as much the meaning of causal expressions as the\nimplicit reference to generalizations does.” (1985, p. 12, see\nalso Schaffer 2005). The upshot of this argument is that the no-basis\nview deprives us of any intuitive grasp on the notion of cause. For\nhow are we to judge whether or not certain cases, such as the problem\ncases reviewed above or any others, involve causation or not, if our\njudgments are infected with a component of unsystematic caprice? \nLewis writes: “I am concerned with the prior question of what it\nis to be one of the causes (unselectively speaking). My analysis is\nmeant to capture a broad and nondiscriminatory concept of\ncausation.” (1986a, p. 162) But it is not obvious that we\nhave any such concept as Lewis seeks. Or at least, it is not\nobvious that our intuitions about causation can provide any\nevidence concerning this “broad and nondiscriminatory\nconcept”, if our intuitions are shot through with selection\neffects. \nAdicity Revisited: A final argument to consider on\nthe question of selection revisits adicity (Section 1.3), and\nmaintains that additional causal relata might reconcile caprice and\npredictability, and explain inseparability (Schaffer 2005 and 2012).\nWhat is capricious about selection is that different speakers, in\ndifferent conversational contexts, will disagree about what is a cause\nand what is a background condition. If one does not know what inquiry\na speaker is pursuing, one may well find her selections capricious.\nWhat is predictable about selection is that, once conversational\ncontext is fixed, one can expect widespread agreement about causes\nversus conditions. If one knows what inquiry a speaker is pursuing,\none will find her selections predictable. This might suggest that what\nis varying capriciously is which contrasts are in play in a given\ninquiry, and what is predictable is what counts as a real cause\nrelative to the contrasts in play. \nMackie (a binary theorist) speaks of the causal field with\nreference to which causal selection is made: “A causal statement\nwill be the answer to a causal question, and the question ‘What\ncaused this explosion?’ can be expanded into ‘What made\nthe difference between those times, or those cases, within a certain\nrange, in which no such explosion occurred, and this case in which an\nexplosion did occur?’ Both causes and effects are seen as\ndifferences within a field; anything that is part of the assumed (but\ncommonly unstated) description of the field itself will, then, be\nautomatically ruled out as a candidate for the role of cause.”\n(1974, p. 35) The contrastivist may offer a natural implementation of\nMackie's notion of a causal field, understood now as the aspects of\nthe situation that are assumed present and for which alternative\n(/contrasts) are not considered. This is particularly apt in\nunderstanding selection against the backdrop of causal models, in\nwhich only certain events are represented at all via variables (events\nthat are represented via variables are outfitted with a range of\nalternative values, while events that are not represented at all are\nnot). \nCausal selection, on all views, is a reflection of which alternatives\nare in question. For the quaternary theorist, selection is determined\nby the values of the contrast relata (including the matter of whether\nany contrasts at all are being considered for a given factor). It is\nthus an inseparable component of our causal concept. For the person\nwho thinks that causation is relative to a causal model, selection may\nbe determined in a comparable way by the range of events modeled by\nvariables (which are outfitted with a range of alternatives). On these\nviews the very notion of a causal connection is only well defined in\nlight of contrasts and/or models, and these additional relata explain\nselection.","contact.mail":"jonathan.schaffer@rutgers.edu","contact.domain":"rutgers.edu"}]
