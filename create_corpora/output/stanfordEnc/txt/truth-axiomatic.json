Because of the liar and other\nparadoxes, the axioms and rules have to be chosen carefully in order\nto avoid inconsistency. Many axiom systems for the truth predicate\nhave been discussed in the literature and their respective properties\nbeen analysed. Several philosophers, including many deflationists, have endorsed axiomatic theories of truth in their\naccounts of truth. The logical properties of the formal theories are\nrelevant to various philosophical questions, such as questions about\nthe ontological status of properties, Gödel’s theorems,\ntruth-theoretic deflationism, eliminability of semantic notions and\nthe theory of meaning.\n\nThere have been many attempts to define truth in terms of\n correspondence,\n coherence or other notions. \nHowever, it is far from clear that truth is a definable notion. In\nformal settings satisfying certain natural conditions, Tarski’s\ntheorem on the undefinability of the truth predicate shows that a\ndefinition of a truth predicate requires resources that go beyond\nthose of the formal language for which truth is going to be defined.\nIn these cases definitional approaches to truth have to fail. By contrast,\nthe axiomatic approach does not presuppose that truth can be\ndefined. Instead, a formal language is expanded by a new primitive\npredicate for truth or satisfaction, and axioms for that predicate are then laid\ndown. This approach by itself does not preclude the possibility that the truth predicate\nis definable, although in many cases it can be shown that the truth\npredicate is not definable. In semantic theories of truth (e.g., Tarski 1935, Kripke 1975), in\ncontrast, a truth predicate is defined for a language, the so-called\nobject language. This definition is carried out in a metalanguage or\nmetatheory, which is typically taken to include set theory or at least\nanother strong theory or expressively rich interpreted\nlanguage. Tarski’s theorem on the undefinability of the truth\npredicate shows that, given certain general assumptions, the resources\nof the metalanguage or metatheory must go beyond the resources of the\nobject-language. So semantic approaches usually necessitate the use of\na metalanguage that is more powerful than the object-language for\nwhich it provides a semantics. As with other formal deductive systems, axiomatic theories of truth can be\npresented within very weak logical frameworks. These frameworks require very\nfew resources, and in particular, avoid the need for a strong metalanguage and\nmetatheory.  Formal work on axiomatic theories of truth has helped to shed some light on\nsemantic theories of truth. For instance, it has yielded information on what is\nrequired of a metalanguage that is sufficient for defining a truth predicate.\nSemantic theories of truth, in turn, provide one with the theoretical tools\nneeded for investigating models of axiomatic theories of truth and with\nmotivations for certain axiomatic theories. Thus axiomatic and semantic\napproaches to truth are intertwined. This entry outlines the most popular axiomatic theories of truth and\nmentions some of the formal results that have been obtained concerning them. We\ngive only hints as to their philosophical applications. Theories of truth and predication are closely related to theories of\n properties and\n property attribution. To say that an open formula \\(\\phi(x)\\)\nis true of an individual \\(a\\) seems equivalent (in some sense)\nto the claim that \\(a\\) has the property of\nbeing such that \\(\\phi\\) (this property is signified by the open formula).\nFor example, one might say that ‘\\(x\\) is a poor philosopher’ is true\nof Tom instead of saying that Tom has the property of being a poor philosopher.\nQuantification over definable properties can then be mimicked in a language\nwith a truth predicate by quantifying over formulas. Instead of saying, for\ninstance, that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exactly the same properties, one\nsays that exactly the same formulas are true of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The\nreduction of properties to truth works also to some extent for sets of\nindividuals. There are also reductions in the other direction: Tarski (1935) has\nshown that certain second-order existence assumptions (e.g.,\ncomprehension axioms) may be utilized to define truth (see the entry\non Tarski’s definition of\ntruth). The mathematical analysis of axiomatic theories of truth\nand second-order systems has exhibited many equivalences between these\nsecond-order existence assumptions and truth-theoretic\nassumptions. These results show exactly what is required for defining a truth predicate\nthat satisfies certain axioms, thereby sharpening Tarski’s insights into\ndefinability of truth. In particular, proof-theoretic equivalences described in\nSection 3.3 below make explicit to what extent a\nmetalanguage (or rather metatheory) has to be richer than the object language\nin order to be able to define a truth predicate. The equivalence between second-order theories and truth theories also has\nbearing on traditional metaphysical topics. The reductions of second-order\ntheories (i.e., theories of properties or sets) to axiomatic theories of truth\nmay be conceived as forms of reductive nominalism, for they replace existence\nassumptions for sets or properties (e.g., comprehension axioms) by\nontologically innocuous assumptions, in the present case by assumptions on the\nbehaviour of the truth predicate. According to Gödel’s incompleteness theorems,\n the statement that Peano Arithmetic (PA)\nis consistent, in its guise as a number-theoretic statement (given the\ntechnique of Gödel numbering), cannot be derived in PA\nitself. But PA can be strengthened by adding this consistency\nstatement or by stronger axioms. In particular, axioms partially\nexpressing the soundness of PA can be added. These are known as\nreflection principles. An example of a reflection principle for PA\nwould be the set of\nsentences \\(Bew_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner)\n\\rightarrow \\phi\\) where \\(\\phi\\) is a formula of the language of\narithmetic, \\(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) a name for \\(\\phi\\)\nand \\(Bew_{PA}(x)\\) is the standard provability\npredicate for PA (‘\\(Bew\\)’ was introduced by\nGödel and is short for the German word\n‘beweisbar’, that is,\n‘provable’).  The process of adding reflection principles can be iterated: one\ncan add, for example, a reflection principle R for PA to PA; this\nresults in a new theory PA+R. Then one adds the reflection principle\nfor the system PA+R to the theory PA+R. This process can be continued\ninto the transfinite (see Feferman 1962 and Franzén 2004). The reflection principles express—at least\npartially—the soundness of the system. The most natural and full\nexpression of the soundness of a system involves the truth predicate\nand is known as the Global Reflection Principle (see Kreisel and\nLévy 1968). The Global Reflection Principle for a formal system\nS states that all sentences provable in S are true: \\(Bew_S (x)\\) expresses here provability of\nsentences in the system S (we omit discussion here of the problems of\ndefining \\(Bew_S (x))\\). The truth predicate\nhas to satisfy certain principles; otherwise the global reflection\nprinciple would be vacuous. Thus not only the global reflection\nprinciple has to be added, but also axioms for truth. If a natural\ntheory of truth like T(PA) below is added, however, it is no longer\nnecessary to postulate the global reflection principle explicitly, as\ntheories like T(PA) prove already the global reflection principle for\nPA. One may therefore view truth theories as reflection principles as\nthey prove soundness statements and add the resources to express these\nstatements. Thus instead of iterating reflection principles that are formulated\nentirely in the language of arithmetic, one can add by iteration new\ntruth predicates and correspondingly new axioms for the new truth\npredicates. Thereby one might hope to make explicit all the\nassumptions that are implicit in the acceptance of a theory like\nPA. The resulting theory is called the reflective closure of the\ninitial theory. Feferman (1991) has proposed the use of a single truth\npredicate and a single theory (KF), rather than a hierarchy of\npredicates and theories, in order to explicate the reflective closure\nof PA and other theories. (KF is discussed further\nin Section 4.4 below.) The relation of truth theories and (iterated) reflection principles\nalso became prominent in the discussion of truth-theoretic\ndeflationism (see Tennant 2002 and the follow-up discussion). Many proponents of\n deflationist theories of truth\n have chosen to treat truth as a primitive notion\nand to axiomatize it, often using some version of\nthe \\(T\\)-sentences as axioms. \\(T\\)-sentences are\nequivalences of the form\n\\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner \\leftrightarrow \\phi\\), where \\(T\\) is the truth predicate, \\(\\phi\\) is a sentence\nand \\(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) is a name for the\nsentence \\(\\phi\\). (More refined axioms have also been discussed by\ndeflationists.) At first glance at least, the axiomatic approach seems\nmuch less ‘deflationary’ than those more traditional\ntheories which rely on a definition of truth in terms of\ncorrespondence or the like. If truth can be explicitly defined, it can\nbe eliminated, whereas an axiomatized notion of truth may and often\ndoes come with commitments that go beyond that of the base\ntheory.  If truth does not have any explanatory force, as some deflationists\nclaim, the axioms for truth should not allow us to prove any new\ntheorems that do not involve the truth predicate. Accordingly, Horsten (1995), Shapiro (1998) and Ketland (1999) have suggested that\na deflationary axiomatization of truth should be at\nleast conservative. The new axioms for truth are conservative\nif they do not imply any additional sentences (free of occurrences of\nthe truth-predicate) that aren’t already provable without the\ntruth axioms. Thus a non-conservative theory of truth adds new\nnon-semantic content to a theory and has genuine explanatory power,\ncontrary to many deflationist views. Certain natural theories of\ntruth, however, fail to be conservative (see Section\n3.3 below, Field 1999 and Shapiro 2002 for further\ndiscussion). According to many deflationists, truth serves merely the purpose of\nexpressing infinite conjunctions. It is plain that not all\ninfinite conjunctions can be expressed because there are uncountably\nmany (non-equivalent) infinite conjunctions over a countable\nlanguage. Since the language with an added truth predicate has only\ncountably many formulas, not every infinite conjunction can be\nexpressed by a different finite formula. The formal work on axiomatic\ntheories of truth has helped to specify exactly which infinite\nconjunctions can be expressed with a truth predicate. Feferman (1991)\nprovides a proof-theoretic analysis of a fairly strong system. (Again,\nthis will be explained in the discussion about KF\nin Section 4.4 below.) In most axiomatic theories, truth is conceived as a predicate of\nobjects. There is an extensive philosophical discussion on the\ncategory of objects to which truth applies: propositions conceived as\nobjects that are independent of any language, types and tokens of\nsentences and utterances, thoughts, and many other objects have been\nproposed. Since the structure of sentences considered as types is\nrelatively clear, sentence types have often been used as the objects\nthat can be true. In many cases there is no need to make very specific\nmetaphysical commitments, because only certain modest assumptions on\nthe structure of these objects are required, independently from\nwhether they are finally taken to be syntactic objects, propositions\nor still something else. The theory that describes the properties of\nthe objects to which truth can be attributed is called the base\ntheory. The formulation of the base theory does not involve the\ntruth predicate or any specific truth-theoretic assumptions. The base\ntheory could describe the structure of sentences, propositions and the\nlike, so that notions like the negation of such an object can then be\nused in the formulation of the truth-theoretic axioms. In many axiomatic truth theories, truth is taken as a predicate\napplying to the Gödel numbers of sentences. Peano arithmetic has\nproved to be a versatile theory of objects to which truth is applied,\nmainly because adding truth-theoretic axioms to Peano arithmetic\nyields interesting systems and because Peano arithmetic is equivalent\nto many straightforward theories of syntax and even theories of\npropositions. However, other base theories have been considered as\nwell, including formal syntax theories and set theories. Of course, we can also investigate theories which result by adding\nthe truth-theoretic axioms to much stronger theories like set\ntheory. Usually there is no chance of proving the consistency of set\ntheory plus further truth-theoretic axioms because the consistency of\nset theory itself cannot be established without assumptions\ntranscending set theory. In many cases not even relative consistency\nproofs are feasible. However, if adding certain truth-theoretic axioms\nto PA yields a consistent theory, it seems at least plausible that\nadding analogous axioms to set theory will not lead to an\ninconsistency. Therefore, the hope is that research on theories of\ntruth over PA will give an some indication of what will happen when we\nextend stronger theories with axioms for the truth predicate. However, Fujimoto (2012)\n has shown that some axiomatic truth theories over set theory differ from their counterparts over Peano arithmetic in some aspects. For the sake of definiteness we assume that the language of\narithmetic has exactly \\(\\neg , \\wedge\\) and \\(\\vee\\) as connectives and\n\\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\exists\\) as quantifiers. It has as individual constants\nonly the symbol 0 for zero; its only function symbol is the unary\nsuccessor symbol \\(S\\); addition and multiplication are expressed\nby predicate symbols. Therefore the only closed terms of the language\nof arithmetic are the numerals\n\\(0, S\\)(0), \\(S(S\\)(0)), \\(S(S(S\\)(0))),\n…. \nThe language of arithmetic does not contain the unary predicate\nsymbol \\(T\\), so\nlet \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\) be the\nlanguage of arithmetic augmented by the new unary predicate\nsymbol \\(T\\) for truth. If \\(\\phi\\) is a sentence\nof \\(\\mathcal{L}_T,\n\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) is a name for \\(\\phi\\) in the\nlanguage \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\);\nformally speaking, it is the numeral of\nthe Gödel number of\n\\(\\phi\\). In general, Greek letters like \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are variables of\nthe metalanguage, that is, the language used for talking about\ntheories of truth and the language in which this entry is written\n(i.e., English enriched by some symbols). \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) range over\nformulas of the formal\nlanguage \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\). In what follows, we use small, upper case italic letters\nlike \\({\\scriptsize A}, {\\scriptsize B},\\ldots\\) as\nvariables in \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\)\nranging over sentences (or their Gödel numbers, to be\nprecise). Thus\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(\\ldots{\\scriptsize A}\\ldots)\\)\nstands for\n\\(\\forall x(Sent_T (x)\n\\rightarrow \\ldots x\\ldots)\\),\nwhere \\(Sent_T (x)\\) expresses in the\nlanguage of arithmetic that \\(x\\) is a sentence of the language\nof arithmetic extended by the predicate symbol \\(T\\). The\nsyntactical operations of forming a conjunction of two sentences and\nsimilar operations can be expressed in the language of\narithmetic. Since the language of arithmetic does not contain any\nfunction symbol apart from the symbol for successor, these operations\nmust be expressed by sutiable predicate expressions. Thus one can say\nin the language \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\)\nthat a negation of a sentence\nof \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\) is true if and\nonly if the sentence itself is not true. We would write this as  The square brackets indicate that the operation of forming the negation of\n\\({\\scriptsize A}\\) is expressed in the language of arithmetic. Since the\nlanguage of arithmetic does not contain a function symbol representing the\nfunction that sends sentences to their negations, appropriate paraphrases\ninvolving predicates must be given.  Thus, for instance, the expression is a single sentence of the language \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\) saying that a conjunction of\nsentences of \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\) is true if\nand only if both sentences are true. In contrast,  is only a schema. That is, it stands for the set of all sentences\nthat are obtained from the above expression by substituting sentences\nof \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\) for the Greek\nletters \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\). The single sentence\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}\\forall{\\scriptsize B}(T[{\\scriptsize A} \\wedge{\\scriptsize B}] \\leftrightarrow \n(T{\\scriptsize A} \\wedge T{\\scriptsize B}))\\) implies all sentences\nwhich are instances of the schema, but the instances of the schema do\nnot imply the single universally quantified sentence. In general, the\nquantified versions are stronger than the corresponding schemata.  In typed theories of truth, only the truth of sentences not\ncontaining the same truth predicate is provable, thus avoiding the\nparadoxes by observing Tarski’s distinction between object and\nmetalanguage. Certain truth predicates can be defined within the language of\narithmetic. Predicates suitable as truth predicates for sublanguages\nof the language of arithmetic can be defined within the language of\narithmetic, as long as the quantificational complexity of the formulas\nin the sublanguage is restricted. In particular, there is a\nformula \\(Tr_0 (x)\\) that expresses\nthat \\(x\\) is a true atomic sentence of the language of\narithmetic, that is, a sentence of the form \\(n=k\\),\nwhere \\(k\\) and \\(n\\) are identical numerals. For further\ninformation on partial truth predicates see, for instance,\nHájek and Pudlak (1993), Kaye (1991) and Takeuti (1987). The definable truth predicates are truly redundant, because they\nare expressible in PA; therefore there is no need to introduce them\naxiomatically. All truth predicates in the following are not definable\nin the language of arithmetic, and therefore not redundant at least in\nthe sense that they are not definable.  The typed \\(T\\)-sentences are all equivalences of the\nform \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner \\leftrightarrow \\phi\\), where \\(\\phi\\) is a sentence not containing the truth\npredicate. Tarski (1935) called any theory proving these equivalences\n‘materially adequate’. Tarski (1935) criticised an\naxiomatization of truth relying only on the \\(T\\)-sentences, not\nbecause he aimed at a definition rather than an axiomatization of\ntruth, but because such a theory seemed too weak. Thus although the\ntheory is materially adequate, Tarski thought that\nthe \\(T\\)-sentences are deductively too weak. He observed, in\nparticular, that the \\(T\\)-sentences do not prove the principle\nof completeness, that is, the sentence\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T{\\scriptsize A}\\vee T[\\neg{\\scriptsize A}\\)])\nwhere the quantifier \\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}\\) is restricted\nto sentences not containing T. Theories of truth based on the \\(T\\)-sentences, and their\nformal properties, have also recently been a focus of interest in the\ncontext of so-called deflationary theories of\ntruth. The \\(T\\)-sentences \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner \\leftrightarrow \\phi\\) (where \\(\\phi\\) does not contain \\(T)\\) are not\nconservative over first-order logic with identity, that is, they prove\na sentence not containing \\(T\\) that is not logically valid. For\nthe \\(T\\)-sentences prove that the sentences \\(0=0\\) and \\(\\neg 0=0\\) are\ndifferent and that therefore at least two objects exist. In other\nwords, the \\(T\\)-sentences are not conservative over the empty\nbase theory. If the \\(T\\)-sentences are added to PA, the\nresulting theory is conservative over PA. This means that the theory\ndoes not prove \\(T\\)-free sentences that are not already provable\nin PA. This result even holds if in addition to\nthe \\(T\\)-sentences also all induction axioms containing the\ntruth predicate are added. This may be shown by appealing to the\nCompactness Theorem. In the form outlined above, T-sentences express the equivalence between \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) and \\(\\phi\\) only when \\(\\phi\\) is a sentence.\nIn order to capture the equivalence for properties \\((x\\) has property P iff ‘P’ is true of \\(x)\\) one must generalise the T-sentences. The result are usually referred to as the uniform T-senences and are formalised by the equivalences \n\\(\\forall x(T\\ulcorner \\phi(\\underline{x})\\urcorner \\leftrightarrow \\phi(x))\\) for each open formula \\(\\phi(v)\\) with at most \\(v\\) free in \\(\\phi\\).\nUnderlining the variable indicates it is bound from the outside.\nMore precisely, \\(\\ulcorner \\phi(\\underline{x})\\urcorner\\) stands for the result of replacing the variable \\(v\\)\nin \\(\\ulcorner \\phi(v)\\urcorner\\) by the numeral\nof \\(x\\). As was observed already by Tarski (1935), certain desirable\ngeneralizations don’t follow from the T-sentences. For instance,\ntogether with reasonable base theories they don’t imply that a\nconjunction is true if both conjuncts are true. In order to obtain systems that also prove universally quantified\ntruth-theoretic principles, one can turn the inductive clauses of\nTarski’s definition of truth into axioms. In the following\naxioms, \\(AtomSent_{PA}(\\ulcorner{\\scriptsize A}\\urcorner)\\)\nexpresses that \\({\\scriptsize A}\\) is an atomic sentence of the\nlanguage of\narithmetic, \\(Sent_{PA}(\\ulcorner{\\scriptsize A}\\urcorner)\\)\nexpresses that \\({\\scriptsize A}\\) is a sentence of the language\nof arithmetic. Axiom 1 says that an atomic sentence of the language of Peano\narithmetic is true if and only if it is true according to the\narithmetical truth predicate for this language\n\\((Tr_0\\) was defined in Section\n3.1). Axioms 2–6 claim that truth commutes with all\nconnectives and quantifiers. Axiom 5 says that a universally\nquantified sentence of the language of arithmetic is true if and only\nif all its numerical instances are true.\n\n\\(Sent_{PA}(\\forall v{\\scriptsize A})\\)\nsays that \\({\\scriptsize A}(v)\\) is a formula with at\nmost \\(v\\) free (because\n\\(\\forall v{\\scriptsize A}(v)\\) is a\nsentence). If these axioms are to be formulated for a language like set theory\nthat lacks names for all objects, then axioms 5 and 6 require the use\nof a satisfaction relation rather than a unary truth predicate. Axioms in the style of 1–6 above played a central role\nin Donald Davidson‘s theory of meaning and\nin several deflationist approaches to truth.  The theory given by all axioms of PA and Axioms 1–6 but with\ninduction only for \\(T\\)-free formulae is conservative over PA,\nthat is, it doesn’t prove any new \\(T\\)-free theorems that\nnot already provable in PA. However, not all models of PA can be\nexpanded to models of PA + axioms 1–6. This follows from a\nresult due to Lachlan (1981). Kotlarski, Krajewski, and Lachlan (1981)\nproved the conservativeness very similar to PA + axioms 1–6 by\nmodel-theoretic means. Although several authors claimed that this result is also finitarily provable, no such\nproof was available until Enayat & Visser (2015) and Leigh\n(2015). Moreover, the theory given by PA + axioms 1–6 is relatively interpretable in PA. However, this result is sensitive to the choice of the base theory: it fails for finitely axiomatized theories (Heck 2015, Nicolai 2016). These proof-theoretic results have been used extensively in the discussion of truth-theoretic deflationism (see Cieśliński 2017). \nOf course PA + axioms 1–6 is restrictive insofar as it does not\ncontain the induction axioms in the language with the truth\npredicate.\n There are various labels for the system that is obtained by\nadding all induction axioms involving the truth predicate to the\nsystem PA + axioms 1–6: T(PA), CT, PA(S) or PA + ‘there is a\nfull inductive satisfaction class’. This theory is no longer\nconservative over its base theory PA. For instance one can formalise\nthe soundness theorem or global reflection principle for PA, that is,\nthe claim that all sentences provable in PA are true. The global\nreflection principle for PA in turn implies the consistency of PA,\nwhich is not provable in pure PA by\nGödel’s\n Second Incompleteness Theorem.\n Thus T(PA) is not conservative over PA. T(PA) is much\nstronger than the mere consistency statement for PA: T(PA) is\nequivalent to the second-order system ACA of arithmetical\ncomprehension (see Takeuti 1987 and Feferman 1991). More precisely,\nT(PA) and ACA are intertranslatable in a way that preserves all\narithmetical sentences. ACA is given by the axioms of PA with full\ninduction in the second-order language and the following comprehension\nprinciple: \nwhere \\(\\phi(x)\\) is any formula (in which \\(x\\) may or may\nnot be free) that does not contain any second-order quantifiers, but\npossibly free second-order variables. In T(PA), quantification\nover sets can be defined as quantification over formulas with\none free variable and membership as the truth of the formula as\napplied to a number.  \nAs the global reflection principle entails formal consistency, the conservativeness result for PA + axioms 1–6 implies that the global reflection principle for Peano arithmetic is not derivable in the typed compositional theory without expanding the induction axioms.\nIn fact, this theory proves neither the statement that all logical validities are true (global reflection for pure first-order logic) nor that all the Peano axioms of arithmetic are true.\nPerhaps surprisingly, of these two unprovable statements it is the former that is the stronger.\nThe latter can be added as an axiom and the theory remains conservative over PA (Enayat and Visser 2015, Leigh 2015).\nIn contrast, over PA + axioms 1–6, the global reflection principle for first-order logic is equivalent to global reflection for Peano arithmetic (Cieśliński 2010), and these two theories have the same arithmetic consequences as adding the axiom of induction for bounded \\((\\Delta_0)\\) formulas containing the truth predicate (Wcisło and Łełyk 2017).\n The transition from PA to T(PA) can be imagined as an act of reflection on the truth of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\)-sentences in PA. Similarly, the step from the typed \\(T\\)-sentences to the compositional axioms is also tied to a reflection principle, specifically the uniform reflection principle over the typed uniform \\(T\\)-sentences.\nThis is the collection of sentences \n\\(\\forall x\\, Bew_S (\\ulcorner \\phi(\\underline{x})\\urcorner) \\rightarrow \\phi\\)(x) where \\(\\phi\\) ranges over formulas in \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\) with one free variable and S is the theory of the uniform typed T-sentences.\nUniform reflection exactly captures the difference between the two theories: the reflection principle is both derivable in T(PA) and suffices to derive the six compositional axioms (Halbach 2001).\nMoreover, the equivalence extends to iterations of uniform reflection, in that for any ordinal \\(\\alpha , 1 + \\alpha\\) iterations of uniform reflection over the typed \\(T\\)-sentences coincides with T(PA) extended by transfinite induction up to the ordinal \\(\\varepsilon_{\\alpha}\\), namely the \\(\\alpha\\)-th ordinal with the property that \\(\\omega^{\\alpha} = \\alpha\\) (Leigh 2016).\n Much stronger fragments of second-order arithmetic can be\ninterpreted by type-free truth systems, that is, by theories of truth\nthat prove not only the truth of arithmetical sentences but also the\ntruth of sentences of the language \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\) with the truth\npredicate; see Section 4 below. The above mentioned theories of truth can be iterated by\nintroducing indexed truth predicates. One adds to the language of PA\ntruth predicates indexed by ordinals (or ordinal notations) or one\nadds a binary truth predicate that applies to ordinal notations and\nsentences. In this respect the hierarchical approach does not fit the\nframework outlined in Section 2, because the language\ndoes not feature a single unary truth predicate applying to sentences\nbut rather many unary truth predicates or a single binary truth\npredicate (or even a single unary truth predicate applying to pairs of\nordinal notations and sentences). In such a language an axiomatization of Tarski’s hierarchy of truth\npredicates can be formulated. On the proof-theoretic side iterating\ntruth theories in the style of T(PA) corresponds to iterating\nelementary comprehension, that is, to iterating ACA. The system of\niterated truth theories corresponds to the system of ramified analysis\n(see Feferman 1991).  Visser (1989) has studied non-wellfounded\nhierarchies of languages and axiomatizations thereof. If one adds\nthe \\(T\\)-sentences \\(T_n\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner \\leftrightarrow \\phi\\) to the language of arithmetic where \\(\\phi\\) contains only\ntruth predicates \\(T_k\\)\nwith \\(k\\gt n\\) to PA, a theory is\nobtained that does not have a standard \\((\\omega\\)-)model. The truth predicates in natural languages do not come with any\nouvert type restriction. Therefore typed theories of truth (axiomatic\nas well as semantic theories) have been thought to be inadequate for\nanalysing the truth predicate of natural language, although recently\nhierarchical theories have been advocated by Glanzberg (forthcoming)\nand others. This is one motive for investigating type-free theories of\ntruth, that is, systems of truth that allow one to prove the truth of\nsentences involving the truth predicate. Some type-free theories of\ntruth have much higher expressive power than the typed theories that\nhave been surveyed in the previous section (at least as long as\nindexed truth predicates are avoided). Therefore type-free theories of\ntruth are much more powerful tools in the reduction of other theories\n(for instance, second-order ones).  The set of\nall \\(T\\)-sentences \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner \\leftrightarrow \\phi\\), where \\(\\phi\\) is any sentence of the\nlanguage \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\), that\nis, where \\(\\phi\\) may contain \\(T\\), is inconsistent with PA (or\nany theory that proves the diagonal lemma) because of\nthe Liar paradox. Therefore one might\ntry to drop from the set of all \\(T\\)-sentences only those that\nlead to an inconsistency. In other words, one may consider maximal\nconsistent sets of \\(T\\)-sentences. McGee (1992) showed that\nthere are uncountably many maximal sets of \\(T\\)-sentences that\nare consistent with PA. So the strategy does not lead to a single\ntheory. Even worse, given an arithmetical sentence (i.e., a sentence\nnot containing \\(T)\\) that can neither be proved nor disproved in\nPA, one can find a consistent \\(T\\)-sentence that decides this\nsentence (McGee 1992). This implies that many consistent sets\nof \\(T\\)-sentences prove false arithmetical statements. Thus the\nstrategy to drop just the \\(T\\)-sentences that yield an\ninconsistency is doomed.  A set of \\(T\\)-sentences that does not imply any false\narithmetical statement may be obtained by allowing only those \\(\\phi\\)\nin \\(T\\)-sentences \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner \\leftrightarrow \\phi\\) that contain \\(T\\) only positively, that is, in the\nscope of an even number of negation symbols. Like the typed theory\nin Section 3.2 this theory does not prove\ncertain generalizations but proves the same T-free sentences as the\nstrong type-free compositional Kripke-Feferman theory below (Halbach\n2009). Schindler (2015) obtained a deductively very strong truth theory based on stratified disquotational principles. Besides the disquotational feature of truth, one would also like to\ncapture the compositional features of truth and generalize the axioms\nof typed compositional truth to the type-free case. To this end,\naxioms or rules concerning the truth of atomic sentences with the\ntruth predicate will have to be added and the restriction\nto \\(T\\)-free sentences in the compositional axioms will have to\nbe lifted. In order to treat truth like other predicates, one will add\nthe axiom\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[T{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow T{\\scriptsize A})\\) (where\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}\\) ranges over all sentences). If the\ntype restriction of the typed compositional axiom for\nnegation is removed, the axiom\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[\\neg{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow \\neg T{\\scriptsize A})\\) is obtained. However, the axioms\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[T{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow T{\\scriptsize A})\\) and\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[\\neg{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow \\neg T{\\scriptsize A})\\) are inconsistent over\nweak theories of syntax, so one of them has to be given up. If\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[\\neg{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow \\neg T{\\scriptsize A})\\) is retained, one will\nhave to find weaker axioms or rules for truth iteration, but truth\nremains a classical concept in the sense that\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[\\neg{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow \\neg T{\\scriptsize A})\\) implies the law of\nexcluded middle (for any sentence either the sentence itself or its\nnegation is true) and the law of noncontradiction (for no sentence the\nsentence itself and its negation are true). If, in contrast,\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[\\neg{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow \\neg T{\\scriptsize A})\\) is rejected and\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[T{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow T{\\scriptsize A})\\) retained, then it will\nbecome provable that either some sentences are true together with\ntheir negations or that for some sentences neither they nor their\nnegations are true, and thus systems of non-classical truth are\nobtained, although the systems themselves are still formulated in\nclassical logic. In the next two sections we overview the most\nprominent system of each kind. The system FS, named after Friedman and Sheard (1987), retains the\nnegation axiom\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[\\neg{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow \\neg T{\\scriptsize A})\\). The further\ncompositional axioms are obtained by lifting the type restriction to\ntheir untyped counterparts: \n If \\(\\phi\\) is a theorem, one may infer\n \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\), and conversely, if\n \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) is a theorem, one may\n infer \\(\\phi\\).  It follows from results due to McGee (1985) that FS is\n\\(\\omega\\)-inconsistent, that is, FS proves\n\\(\\exists x\\neg \\phi(x)\\), but proves also \\(\\phi\\)(0),\n\\(\\phi\\)(1), \\(\\phi\\)(2), … for some formula \\(\\phi(x)\\)\nof \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\). The\narithmetical theorems of FS, however, are all correct. In FS one can define all finite levels of the classical Tarskian\nhierarchy, but FS isn’t strong enough to allow one to recover\nany of its transfinite levels. Indeed, Halbach (1994) determined its\nproof-theoretic strength to be precisely that of the theory of\nramified truth for all finite levels (i.e., finitely iterated T(PA);\nsee Section 3.4) or, equivalently, the theory of\nramified analysis for all finite levels. If either direction of the\nrule is dropped but the other kept, FS retains its proof-theoretic\nstrength (Sheard 2001). It is a virtue of FS that it is thoroughly classical: It is\nformulated in classical logic; if a sentence is provably true in FS,\nthen the sentence itself is provable in FS; and conversely if a\nsentence is provable, then it is also provably true. Its drawback is\nits \\(\\omega\\)-inconsistency. FS may be seen as an axiomatization of\nrule-of-revision semantics for all finite levels (see the entry on\nthe revision theory of truth). The Kripke–Feferman theory retains the truth iteration axiom\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[T{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow T{\\scriptsize A})\\), but the notion of truth\naxiomatized is no longer classical because the negation axiom\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[\\neg{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow \\neg T{\\scriptsize A})\\) is dropped.  The semantical construction captured by this theory is a\ngeneralization of the Tarskian typed inductive definition of truth\ncaptured by T(PA). In the generalized definition one starts with the\ntrue atomic sentence of the arithmetical language and then one\ndeclares true the complex sentences depending on whether its\ncomponents are true or not. For instance, as in the typed case, if\n\\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are true, their conjunction \\(\\phi \\wedge \\psi\\) will be\ntrue as well. In the case of the quantified sentences their truth\nvalue is determined by the truth values of their instances (one could\nrender the quantifier clauses purely compositional by using a\nsatisfaction predicate); for instance, a universally quantified\nsentence will be declared true if and only if all its instances are\ntrue. One can now extend this inductive definition of truth to the\nlanguage \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\) by\ndeclaring a sentence of the\nform \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) true\nif \\(\\phi\\) is already true. Moreover one will declare\n\\(\\neg T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) true if\n\\(\\neg \\phi\\) is true. By making this idea precise, one obtains a variant\nof Kripke’s (1975) theory of truth with the so called Strong Kleene\nvaluation scheme (see the entry\non many-valued logic). If\naxiomatized it leads to the following system, which is known as KF\n(‘Kripke–Feferman’), of which several variants\nappear in the literature: \nApart from the truth-theoretic axioms, KF comprises all axioms of PA\nand all induction axioms involving the truth predicate. The system is\ncredited to Feferman on the basis of two lectures for the Association\nof Symbolic Logic, one in 1979 and the second in 1983, as well as in\nsubsequent manuscripts. Feferman published his version of the system\nunder the label Ref(PA) (‘weak reflective closure of PA’)\nonly in 1991, after several other versions of KF had already appeared\nin print (e.g., Reinhardt 1986, Cantini 1989, who both refer to this\nunpublished work by Feferman). KF itself is formulated in classical logic, but it describes a\nnon-classical notion of truth. For instance, one can\nprove \\(T\\ulcorner L\\urcorner \\leftrightarrow T\\ulcorner\\neg L\\urcorner\\)\nif \\(L\\) is the Liar sentence. Thus KF proves that either both\nthe liar sentence and its negation are true or that neither is\ntrue. So either is the notion of truth paraconsistent (a sentence is\ntrue together with its negation) or paracomplete (neither is\ntrue). Some authors have augmented KF with an axiom ruling out\ntruth-value gluts, which makes KF sound for Kripke’s model\nconstruction, because Kripke had ruled out truth-value gluts. Feferman (1991) showed that KF is proof-theoretically equivalent to\nthe theory of ramified analysis through all levels below\n\\(\\varepsilon_0\\), the limit of the sequence \\(\\omega ,\n\\omega^{\\omega},\n\\omega^{\\omega^{ \\omega} },\\ldots\\), or a theory of\nramified truth through the same ordinals. This result shows that in KF\nexactly \\(\\varepsilon_0\\) many levels of the classical Tarskian\nhierarchy in its axiomatized form can be recovered. Thus KF is far\nstronger than FS, let alone T(PA). Feferman (1991) devised also a\nstrengthening of KF that is as strong as full predicative analysis,\nthat is ramified analysis or truth up to the ordinal\n\\(\\Gamma_0\\). Just as with the typed truth predicate, the theory KF (more precisely, a common variant of it) can be obtained via an act of reflection on a system of untyped \\(T\\)-sentences. The system of \\(T\\)-sentences in question is the extension of the uniform positive untyped \\(T\\)-sentences by a primitive falsity predicate, that is, the theory features two unary predicates \\(T\\) and \\(F\\) and axioms \nfor every formula \\(\\phi(v)\\) positive in both \\(T\\) and \\(F\\), where \\(\\phi '\\) represents the De Morgan dual of \\(\\phi\\) (exchanging \\(T\\) for \\(F\\) and vice versa).\nFrom an application of uniform reflection over this disquotational theory, the truth axioms for the corresponding two predicate version of KF are derivable (Horsten and Leigh, 2016). The converse also holds, as does the generalisation to finite and transfinite iterations of reflection (Leigh, 2017).\n As remarked above, if KF\nproves \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) for some\nsentence \\(\\phi\\) then \\(\\phi\\) holds in all Kripke fixed point models. In\nparticular, there are \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\) fixed\npoints that form a model of the internal theory of KF. Thus from the\nperspective of KF, the least fixed point (from which Kripke’s theory\nis defined) is not singled out. Burgess (forthcoming) provides an\nexpansion of KF, named \\(\\mu\\)KF, that attempts to capture the minimal\nKripkean fixed point. KF is expanded by additional axioms that express\nthat the internal theory of KF is the smallest class closed under the\ndefining axioms for Kripkean truth. This can be formulated as a single\naxiom schema that states, for each open formula \\(\\phi\\),  \n If \\(\\phi\\) satisfies the same axioms of KF as the predicate \\(T\\)\n then \\(\\phi\\) holds of every true sentence.\n \nFrom a proof-theoretic perspective \\(\\mu\\)KF is significantly stronger\nthan KF. The single axiom schema expressing the minimality of the\ntruth predicate allows one to embed into \\(\\mu\\)KF the system\nID\\(_1\\) of one arithmetical inductive definition, an\nimpredicative theory. While intuitively plausible, \\(\\mu\\)KF suffers the\nsame expressive incompleteness as KF: Since the minimal Kripkean fixed\npoint forms a complete \\(\\Pi^{1}_1\\) set and the\ninternal theory of \\(\\mu\\)KF remains recursively enumerable, there are\nstandard models of the theory in which the interpretation of the truth\npredicate is not actually the minimal fixed point. At present there\nlacks a thorough analysis of the models of \\(\\mu\\)KF.\n KF is intended to be an axiomatization of Kripke’s (1975)\nsemantical theory. This theory is based on partial logic with the\nStrong Kleene evaluation scheme. In Strong Kleene logic not every\nsentence \\(\\phi \\vee \\neg \\phi\\) is a theorem; in particular, this\ndisjunction is not true if \\(\\phi\\) lacks a truth\nvalue. Consequently \\(T\\ulcorner L\\vee \\neg L\\urcorner\\)\n(where \\(L\\) is the Liar sentence) is not a theorem of KF and its\nnegation is even provable. Cantini (1990) has proposed a system VF\nthat is inspired by the supervaluations scheme. In VF all classical\ntautologies are provably true\nand \\(T\\ulcorner L \\vee \\neg L\\urcorner\\), for instance, is a theorem of\nVF. VF can be formulated\nin \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\) and uses\nclassical logic. It is no longer a compositional theory of\ntruth, for the following is not a theorem of VF: Not only is this principle inconsistent with the other axioms of\nVF, it does not fit the supervaluationist model for it\nimplies \\(T\\ulcorner L\\urcorner \\vee T\\ulcorner \\neg L\\urcorner\\),\nwhich of course is not correct because according to the intended\nsemantics neither the liar sentence nor its negation is true: both\nlack a truth value. Extending a result due to Friedman and Sheard (1987), Cantini\nshowed that VF is much stronger than KF: VF is proof-theoretically\nequivalent to the theory ID\\(_1\\) of non-iterated inductive\ndefinitions, which is not predicative.  The theories of truth discussed thus far are all axiomatized in\nclassical logic. Some authors have also looked into axiomatic theories\nof truth based on non-classical logic (see, for example, Field 2008,\nHalbach and Horsten 2006, Leigh and Rathjen 2012). There are a number\nof reasons why a logic weaker than classical logic may be\npreferred. The most obvious is that by weakening the logic, some\ncollections of axioms of truth that were previously inconsistent\nbecome consistent. Another common reason is that the axiomatic theory\nin question intends to capture a particular non-classical semantics of\ntruth, for which a classical background theory may prove unsound. The inconsistency of the \\(T\\)-sentences does not rely on\nclassical reasoning. It is also inconsistent over much weaker logics\nsuch as minimal logic and partial logic. However, classical logic does\nplay a role in restricting the free use of principles of truth. For\ninstance, over a classical base theory, the compositional axiom for\nimplication \\((\\rightarrow)\\) is equivalent to the principle of completeness,\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[{\\scriptsize A}] \\vee T[\\neg{\\scriptsize A}\\)]). If the logic under\nthe truth predicate is classical, completeness is equivalent to the compositional axiom for disjunction. Without the law of\nexcluded middle, FS can be formulated as a fully compositional theory\nwhile not proving the truth-completeness principle (Leigh & Rathjen\n2012). In addition, classical logic has an effect on attempts to\ncombine compositional and self-applicable axioms of truth. If, for\nexample, one drops the axiom of truth-consistency from FS (the\nleft-to-right direction of axiom 2 in Section 4.3)\nas well as the law of excluded middle for the truth predicate, it is\npossible to add consistently the truth-iteration axiom\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\rightarrow T[T{\\scriptsize A}])\\).\nThe resulting theory\nstill bears a strong resemblance to FS in that the constructive\nversion of the rule-of-revision semantics for all finite levels\nprovides a natural model of the theory, and the two theories share the same \\(\\Pi^{0}_2\\) consequences (Leigh & Rathjen 2012; Leigh, 2013). \nThis result should be contrasted with KF which, if formulated\nwithout the law of excluded middle, remains maximally consistent with\nrespect to its choice of truth axioms but is a conservative extension of\nHeyting arithmetic. Kripke’s (1975) theory in its different guises is based on partial\nlogic. In order to obtain models for a theory in classical logic, the\nextension of the truth predicate in the partial model is used again as\nthe extension of truth in the classical model. In the classical model\nfalse sentences and those without a truth value in the partial model\nare declared not true. KF is sound with respect to these classical\nmodels and thus incorporates two distinct logics. The first is the\n‘internal’ logic of statements under the truth predicate\nand is formulated with the Strong Kleene valuation schema. The second\nis the ‘external’ logic which is full classical logic. An\neffect of formulating KF in classical logic is that the theory cannot\nbe consistently closed under the truth-introduction rule\n \n If \\(\\phi\\) is a theorem of KF, so is\n \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\).\n \nA second effect of classical logic is the statement of the excluded\nmiddle for the liar sentence. Neither the Liar sentence nor its\nnegation obtains a truth value in Kripke’s theory, so the disjunction\nof the two is not valid. The upshot is that KF, if viewed as an\naxiomatisation of Kripke’s theory, is not sound with respect to its\nintended semantics. For this reason Halbach and Horsten (2006) and\nHorsten (2011) explore an axiomatization of Kripke’s theory with\npartial logic as inner and outer logic. Their suggestion, a\ntheory labelled PKF (‘partial KF’), can be axiomatised as\na Gentzen-style two-sided sequent calculus based on Strong Kleene\nlogic (see the entry on many-valued\nlogic). PKF is formed by adding to this calculus the\nPeano–Dedekind axioms of arithmetic including full induction and\nthe compositional and truth-iteration rules for the truth predicate as\nproscribed by Kripke’s theory. The result is a theory of truth that is\nsound with respect to Kripke’s theory.\n Halbach and Horsten show that this axiomatization of Kripke’s\ntheory is significantly weaker than it’s classical cousin KF. The\nresult demonstrates that restricting logic only for sentences with the\ntruth predicate can hamper also the derivation of truth-free theorems.\n Field (2008) and others criticised theories based on partial logic\nfor the absence of a ‘proper’ conditional and\nbi-conditional. Various authors have proposed conditionals and\nbi-conditionals that are not definable in terms of \\(\\neg , \\vee\\) and\n\\(\\wedge\\). Field (2008) aims at an axiomatic theory of truth not\ndissimilar to PKF but with a new conditional. Feferman (1984) also\nintroduced a bi-conditional to a theory in non-classical logic. Unlike\nField’s and his own 1984 theory, Feferman’s (2008) theory DT is\nformulated in classical logic, but it’s internal logic is again a\npartial logic with a strong conditional.","contact.mail":"volker.halbach@philosophy.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"philosophy.ox.ac.uk"},{"date.published":"2005-12-26","date.changed":"2018-01-18","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-axiomatic/","author1":"Volker Halbach","author1.info":"http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfop0114/","author2.info":"http://flov.gu.se/english/about/staff?languageId=100001&userId=xleigr","entry":"truth-axiomatic","body.text":"\n\nAn axiomatic theory of truth is a deductive theory of truth as a\nprimitive undefined predicate. Because of the liar and other\nparadoxes, the axioms and rules have to be chosen carefully in order\nto avoid inconsistency. Many axiom systems for the truth predicate\nhave been discussed in the literature and their respective properties\nbeen analysed. Several philosophers, including many deflationists, have endorsed axiomatic theories of truth in their\naccounts of truth. The logical properties of the formal theories are\nrelevant to various philosophical questions, such as questions about\nthe ontological status of properties, Gödel’s theorems,\ntruth-theoretic deflationism, eliminability of semantic notions and\nthe theory of meaning.\n\nThere have been many attempts to define truth in terms of\n correspondence,\n coherence or other notions. \nHowever, it is far from clear that truth is a definable notion. In\nformal settings satisfying certain natural conditions, Tarski’s\ntheorem on the undefinability of the truth predicate shows that a\ndefinition of a truth predicate requires resources that go beyond\nthose of the formal language for which truth is going to be defined.\nIn these cases definitional approaches to truth have to fail. By contrast,\nthe axiomatic approach does not presuppose that truth can be\ndefined. Instead, a formal language is expanded by a new primitive\npredicate for truth or satisfaction, and axioms for that predicate are then laid\ndown. This approach by itself does not preclude the possibility that the truth predicate\nis definable, although in many cases it can be shown that the truth\npredicate is not definable. In semantic theories of truth (e.g., Tarski 1935, Kripke 1975), in\ncontrast, a truth predicate is defined for a language, the so-called\nobject language. This definition is carried out in a metalanguage or\nmetatheory, which is typically taken to include set theory or at least\nanother strong theory or expressively rich interpreted\nlanguage. Tarski’s theorem on the undefinability of the truth\npredicate shows that, given certain general assumptions, the resources\nof the metalanguage or metatheory must go beyond the resources of the\nobject-language. So semantic approaches usually necessitate the use of\na metalanguage that is more powerful than the object-language for\nwhich it provides a semantics. As with other formal deductive systems, axiomatic theories of truth can be\npresented within very weak logical frameworks. These frameworks require very\nfew resources, and in particular, avoid the need for a strong metalanguage and\nmetatheory.  Formal work on axiomatic theories of truth has helped to shed some light on\nsemantic theories of truth. For instance, it has yielded information on what is\nrequired of a metalanguage that is sufficient for defining a truth predicate.\nSemantic theories of truth, in turn, provide one with the theoretical tools\nneeded for investigating models of axiomatic theories of truth and with\nmotivations for certain axiomatic theories. Thus axiomatic and semantic\napproaches to truth are intertwined. This entry outlines the most popular axiomatic theories of truth and\nmentions some of the formal results that have been obtained concerning them. We\ngive only hints as to their philosophical applications. Theories of truth and predication are closely related to theories of\n properties and\n property attribution. To say that an open formula \\(\\phi(x)\\)\nis true of an individual \\(a\\) seems equivalent (in some sense)\nto the claim that \\(a\\) has the property of\nbeing such that \\(\\phi\\) (this property is signified by the open formula).\nFor example, one might say that ‘\\(x\\) is a poor philosopher’ is true\nof Tom instead of saying that Tom has the property of being a poor philosopher.\nQuantification over definable properties can then be mimicked in a language\nwith a truth predicate by quantifying over formulas. Instead of saying, for\ninstance, that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exactly the same properties, one\nsays that exactly the same formulas are true of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The\nreduction of properties to truth works also to some extent for sets of\nindividuals. There are also reductions in the other direction: Tarski (1935) has\nshown that certain second-order existence assumptions (e.g.,\ncomprehension axioms) may be utilized to define truth (see the entry\non Tarski’s definition of\ntruth). The mathematical analysis of axiomatic theories of truth\nand second-order systems has exhibited many equivalences between these\nsecond-order existence assumptions and truth-theoretic\nassumptions. These results show exactly what is required for defining a truth predicate\nthat satisfies certain axioms, thereby sharpening Tarski’s insights into\ndefinability of truth. In particular, proof-theoretic equivalences described in\nSection 3.3 below make explicit to what extent a\nmetalanguage (or rather metatheory) has to be richer than the object language\nin order to be able to define a truth predicate. The equivalence between second-order theories and truth theories also has\nbearing on traditional metaphysical topics. The reductions of second-order\ntheories (i.e., theories of properties or sets) to axiomatic theories of truth\nmay be conceived as forms of reductive nominalism, for they replace existence\nassumptions for sets or properties (e.g., comprehension axioms) by\nontologically innocuous assumptions, in the present case by assumptions on the\nbehaviour of the truth predicate. According to Gödel’s incompleteness theorems,\n the statement that Peano Arithmetic (PA)\nis consistent, in its guise as a number-theoretic statement (given the\ntechnique of Gödel numbering), cannot be derived in PA\nitself. But PA can be strengthened by adding this consistency\nstatement or by stronger axioms. In particular, axioms partially\nexpressing the soundness of PA can be added. These are known as\nreflection principles. An example of a reflection principle for PA\nwould be the set of\nsentences \\(Bew_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner)\n\\rightarrow \\phi\\) where \\(\\phi\\) is a formula of the language of\narithmetic, \\(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) a name for \\(\\phi\\)\nand \\(Bew_{PA}(x)\\) is the standard provability\npredicate for PA (‘\\(Bew\\)’ was introduced by\nGödel and is short for the German word\n‘beweisbar’, that is,\n‘provable’).  The process of adding reflection principles can be iterated: one\ncan add, for example, a reflection principle R for PA to PA; this\nresults in a new theory PA+R. Then one adds the reflection principle\nfor the system PA+R to the theory PA+R. This process can be continued\ninto the transfinite (see Feferman 1962 and Franzén 2004). The reflection principles express—at least\npartially—the soundness of the system. The most natural and full\nexpression of the soundness of a system involves the truth predicate\nand is known as the Global Reflection Principle (see Kreisel and\nLévy 1968). The Global Reflection Principle for a formal system\nS states that all sentences provable in S are true: \\(Bew_S (x)\\) expresses here provability of\nsentences in the system S (we omit discussion here of the problems of\ndefining \\(Bew_S (x))\\). The truth predicate\nhas to satisfy certain principles; otherwise the global reflection\nprinciple would be vacuous. Thus not only the global reflection\nprinciple has to be added, but also axioms for truth. If a natural\ntheory of truth like T(PA) below is added, however, it is no longer\nnecessary to postulate the global reflection principle explicitly, as\ntheories like T(PA) prove already the global reflection principle for\nPA. One may therefore view truth theories as reflection principles as\nthey prove soundness statements and add the resources to express these\nstatements. Thus instead of iterating reflection principles that are formulated\nentirely in the language of arithmetic, one can add by iteration new\ntruth predicates and correspondingly new axioms for the new truth\npredicates. Thereby one might hope to make explicit all the\nassumptions that are implicit in the acceptance of a theory like\nPA. The resulting theory is called the reflective closure of the\ninitial theory. Feferman (1991) has proposed the use of a single truth\npredicate and a single theory (KF), rather than a hierarchy of\npredicates and theories, in order to explicate the reflective closure\nof PA and other theories. (KF is discussed further\nin Section 4.4 below.) The relation of truth theories and (iterated) reflection principles\nalso became prominent in the discussion of truth-theoretic\ndeflationism (see Tennant 2002 and the follow-up discussion). Many proponents of\n deflationist theories of truth\n have chosen to treat truth as a primitive notion\nand to axiomatize it, often using some version of\nthe \\(T\\)-sentences as axioms. \\(T\\)-sentences are\nequivalences of the form\n\\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner \\leftrightarrow \\phi\\), where \\(T\\) is the truth predicate, \\(\\phi\\) is a sentence\nand \\(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) is a name for the\nsentence \\(\\phi\\). (More refined axioms have also been discussed by\ndeflationists.) At first glance at least, the axiomatic approach seems\nmuch less ‘deflationary’ than those more traditional\ntheories which rely on a definition of truth in terms of\ncorrespondence or the like. If truth can be explicitly defined, it can\nbe eliminated, whereas an axiomatized notion of truth may and often\ndoes come with commitments that go beyond that of the base\ntheory.  If truth does not have any explanatory force, as some deflationists\nclaim, the axioms for truth should not allow us to prove any new\ntheorems that do not involve the truth predicate. Accordingly, Horsten (1995), Shapiro (1998) and Ketland (1999) have suggested that\na deflationary axiomatization of truth should be at\nleast conservative. The new axioms for truth are conservative\nif they do not imply any additional sentences (free of occurrences of\nthe truth-predicate) that aren’t already provable without the\ntruth axioms. Thus a non-conservative theory of truth adds new\nnon-semantic content to a theory and has genuine explanatory power,\ncontrary to many deflationist views. Certain natural theories of\ntruth, however, fail to be conservative (see Section\n3.3 below, Field 1999 and Shapiro 2002 for further\ndiscussion). According to many deflationists, truth serves merely the purpose of\nexpressing infinite conjunctions. It is plain that not all\ninfinite conjunctions can be expressed because there are uncountably\nmany (non-equivalent) infinite conjunctions over a countable\nlanguage. Since the language with an added truth predicate has only\ncountably many formulas, not every infinite conjunction can be\nexpressed by a different finite formula. The formal work on axiomatic\ntheories of truth has helped to specify exactly which infinite\nconjunctions can be expressed with a truth predicate. Feferman (1991)\nprovides a proof-theoretic analysis of a fairly strong system. (Again,\nthis will be explained in the discussion about KF\nin Section 4.4 below.) In most axiomatic theories, truth is conceived as a predicate of\nobjects. There is an extensive philosophical discussion on the\ncategory of objects to which truth applies: propositions conceived as\nobjects that are independent of any language, types and tokens of\nsentences and utterances, thoughts, and many other objects have been\nproposed. Since the structure of sentences considered as types is\nrelatively clear, sentence types have often been used as the objects\nthat can be true. In many cases there is no need to make very specific\nmetaphysical commitments, because only certain modest assumptions on\nthe structure of these objects are required, independently from\nwhether they are finally taken to be syntactic objects, propositions\nor still something else. The theory that describes the properties of\nthe objects to which truth can be attributed is called the base\ntheory. The formulation of the base theory does not involve the\ntruth predicate or any specific truth-theoretic assumptions. The base\ntheory could describe the structure of sentences, propositions and the\nlike, so that notions like the negation of such an object can then be\nused in the formulation of the truth-theoretic axioms. In many axiomatic truth theories, truth is taken as a predicate\napplying to the Gödel numbers of sentences. Peano arithmetic has\nproved to be a versatile theory of objects to which truth is applied,\nmainly because adding truth-theoretic axioms to Peano arithmetic\nyields interesting systems and because Peano arithmetic is equivalent\nto many straightforward theories of syntax and even theories of\npropositions. However, other base theories have been considered as\nwell, including formal syntax theories and set theories. Of course, we can also investigate theories which result by adding\nthe truth-theoretic axioms to much stronger theories like set\ntheory. Usually there is no chance of proving the consistency of set\ntheory plus further truth-theoretic axioms because the consistency of\nset theory itself cannot be established without assumptions\ntranscending set theory. In many cases not even relative consistency\nproofs are feasible. However, if adding certain truth-theoretic axioms\nto PA yields a consistent theory, it seems at least plausible that\nadding analogous axioms to set theory will not lead to an\ninconsistency. Therefore, the hope is that research on theories of\ntruth over PA will give an some indication of what will happen when we\nextend stronger theories with axioms for the truth predicate. However, Fujimoto (2012)\n has shown that some axiomatic truth theories over set theory differ from their counterparts over Peano arithmetic in some aspects. For the sake of definiteness we assume that the language of\narithmetic has exactly \\(\\neg , \\wedge\\) and \\(\\vee\\) as connectives and\n\\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\exists\\) as quantifiers. It has as individual constants\nonly the symbol 0 for zero; its only function symbol is the unary\nsuccessor symbol \\(S\\); addition and multiplication are expressed\nby predicate symbols. Therefore the only closed terms of the language\nof arithmetic are the numerals\n\\(0, S\\)(0), \\(S(S\\)(0)), \\(S(S(S\\)(0))),\n…. \nThe language of arithmetic does not contain the unary predicate\nsymbol \\(T\\), so\nlet \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\) be the\nlanguage of arithmetic augmented by the new unary predicate\nsymbol \\(T\\) for truth. If \\(\\phi\\) is a sentence\nof \\(\\mathcal{L}_T,\n\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) is a name for \\(\\phi\\) in the\nlanguage \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\);\nformally speaking, it is the numeral of\nthe Gödel number of\n\\(\\phi\\). In general, Greek letters like \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are variables of\nthe metalanguage, that is, the language used for talking about\ntheories of truth and the language in which this entry is written\n(i.e., English enriched by some symbols). \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) range over\nformulas of the formal\nlanguage \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\). In what follows, we use small, upper case italic letters\nlike \\({\\scriptsize A}, {\\scriptsize B},\\ldots\\) as\nvariables in \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\)\nranging over sentences (or their Gödel numbers, to be\nprecise). Thus\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(\\ldots{\\scriptsize A}\\ldots)\\)\nstands for\n\\(\\forall x(Sent_T (x)\n\\rightarrow \\ldots x\\ldots)\\),\nwhere \\(Sent_T (x)\\) expresses in the\nlanguage of arithmetic that \\(x\\) is a sentence of the language\nof arithmetic extended by the predicate symbol \\(T\\). The\nsyntactical operations of forming a conjunction of two sentences and\nsimilar operations can be expressed in the language of\narithmetic. Since the language of arithmetic does not contain any\nfunction symbol apart from the symbol for successor, these operations\nmust be expressed by sutiable predicate expressions. Thus one can say\nin the language \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\)\nthat a negation of a sentence\nof \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\) is true if and\nonly if the sentence itself is not true. We would write this as  The square brackets indicate that the operation of forming the negation of\n\\({\\scriptsize A}\\) is expressed in the language of arithmetic. Since the\nlanguage of arithmetic does not contain a function symbol representing the\nfunction that sends sentences to their negations, appropriate paraphrases\ninvolving predicates must be given.  Thus, for instance, the expression is a single sentence of the language \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\) saying that a conjunction of\nsentences of \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\) is true if\nand only if both sentences are true. In contrast,  is only a schema. That is, it stands for the set of all sentences\nthat are obtained from the above expression by substituting sentences\nof \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\) for the Greek\nletters \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\). The single sentence\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}\\forall{\\scriptsize B}(T[{\\scriptsize A} \\wedge{\\scriptsize B}] \\leftrightarrow \n(T{\\scriptsize A} \\wedge T{\\scriptsize B}))\\) implies all sentences\nwhich are instances of the schema, but the instances of the schema do\nnot imply the single universally quantified sentence. In general, the\nquantified versions are stronger than the corresponding schemata.  In typed theories of truth, only the truth of sentences not\ncontaining the same truth predicate is provable, thus avoiding the\nparadoxes by observing Tarski’s distinction between object and\nmetalanguage. Certain truth predicates can be defined within the language of\narithmetic. Predicates suitable as truth predicates for sublanguages\nof the language of arithmetic can be defined within the language of\narithmetic, as long as the quantificational complexity of the formulas\nin the sublanguage is restricted. In particular, there is a\nformula \\(Tr_0 (x)\\) that expresses\nthat \\(x\\) is a true atomic sentence of the language of\narithmetic, that is, a sentence of the form \\(n=k\\),\nwhere \\(k\\) and \\(n\\) are identical numerals. For further\ninformation on partial truth predicates see, for instance,\nHájek and Pudlak (1993), Kaye (1991) and Takeuti (1987). The definable truth predicates are truly redundant, because they\nare expressible in PA; therefore there is no need to introduce them\naxiomatically. All truth predicates in the following are not definable\nin the language of arithmetic, and therefore not redundant at least in\nthe sense that they are not definable.  The typed \\(T\\)-sentences are all equivalences of the\nform \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner \\leftrightarrow \\phi\\), where \\(\\phi\\) is a sentence not containing the truth\npredicate. Tarski (1935) called any theory proving these equivalences\n‘materially adequate’. Tarski (1935) criticised an\naxiomatization of truth relying only on the \\(T\\)-sentences, not\nbecause he aimed at a definition rather than an axiomatization of\ntruth, but because such a theory seemed too weak. Thus although the\ntheory is materially adequate, Tarski thought that\nthe \\(T\\)-sentences are deductively too weak. He observed, in\nparticular, that the \\(T\\)-sentences do not prove the principle\nof completeness, that is, the sentence\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T{\\scriptsize A}\\vee T[\\neg{\\scriptsize A}\\)])\nwhere the quantifier \\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}\\) is restricted\nto sentences not containing T. Theories of truth based on the \\(T\\)-sentences, and their\nformal properties, have also recently been a focus of interest in the\ncontext of so-called deflationary theories of\ntruth. The \\(T\\)-sentences \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner \\leftrightarrow \\phi\\) (where \\(\\phi\\) does not contain \\(T)\\) are not\nconservative over first-order logic with identity, that is, they prove\na sentence not containing \\(T\\) that is not logically valid. For\nthe \\(T\\)-sentences prove that the sentences \\(0=0\\) and \\(\\neg 0=0\\) are\ndifferent and that therefore at least two objects exist. In other\nwords, the \\(T\\)-sentences are not conservative over the empty\nbase theory. If the \\(T\\)-sentences are added to PA, the\nresulting theory is conservative over PA. This means that the theory\ndoes not prove \\(T\\)-free sentences that are not already provable\nin PA. This result even holds if in addition to\nthe \\(T\\)-sentences also all induction axioms containing the\ntruth predicate are added. This may be shown by appealing to the\nCompactness Theorem. In the form outlined above, T-sentences express the equivalence between \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) and \\(\\phi\\) only when \\(\\phi\\) is a sentence.\nIn order to capture the equivalence for properties \\((x\\) has property P iff ‘P’ is true of \\(x)\\) one must generalise the T-sentences. The result are usually referred to as the uniform T-senences and are formalised by the equivalences \n\\(\\forall x(T\\ulcorner \\phi(\\underline{x})\\urcorner \\leftrightarrow \\phi(x))\\) for each open formula \\(\\phi(v)\\) with at most \\(v\\) free in \\(\\phi\\).\nUnderlining the variable indicates it is bound from the outside.\nMore precisely, \\(\\ulcorner \\phi(\\underline{x})\\urcorner\\) stands for the result of replacing the variable \\(v\\)\nin \\(\\ulcorner \\phi(v)\\urcorner\\) by the numeral\nof \\(x\\). As was observed already by Tarski (1935), certain desirable\ngeneralizations don’t follow from the T-sentences. For instance,\ntogether with reasonable base theories they don’t imply that a\nconjunction is true if both conjuncts are true. In order to obtain systems that also prove universally quantified\ntruth-theoretic principles, one can turn the inductive clauses of\nTarski’s definition of truth into axioms. In the following\naxioms, \\(AtomSent_{PA}(\\ulcorner{\\scriptsize A}\\urcorner)\\)\nexpresses that \\({\\scriptsize A}\\) is an atomic sentence of the\nlanguage of\narithmetic, \\(Sent_{PA}(\\ulcorner{\\scriptsize A}\\urcorner)\\)\nexpresses that \\({\\scriptsize A}\\) is a sentence of the language\nof arithmetic. Axiom 1 says that an atomic sentence of the language of Peano\narithmetic is true if and only if it is true according to the\narithmetical truth predicate for this language\n\\((Tr_0\\) was defined in Section\n3.1). Axioms 2–6 claim that truth commutes with all\nconnectives and quantifiers. Axiom 5 says that a universally\nquantified sentence of the language of arithmetic is true if and only\nif all its numerical instances are true.\n\n\\(Sent_{PA}(\\forall v{\\scriptsize A})\\)\nsays that \\({\\scriptsize A}(v)\\) is a formula with at\nmost \\(v\\) free (because\n\\(\\forall v{\\scriptsize A}(v)\\) is a\nsentence). If these axioms are to be formulated for a language like set theory\nthat lacks names for all objects, then axioms 5 and 6 require the use\nof a satisfaction relation rather than a unary truth predicate. Axioms in the style of 1–6 above played a central role\nin Donald Davidson‘s theory of meaning and\nin several deflationist approaches to truth.  The theory given by all axioms of PA and Axioms 1–6 but with\ninduction only for \\(T\\)-free formulae is conservative over PA,\nthat is, it doesn’t prove any new \\(T\\)-free theorems that\nnot already provable in PA. However, not all models of PA can be\nexpanded to models of PA + axioms 1–6. This follows from a\nresult due to Lachlan (1981). Kotlarski, Krajewski, and Lachlan (1981)\nproved the conservativeness very similar to PA + axioms 1–6 by\nmodel-theoretic means. Although several authors claimed that this result is also finitarily provable, no such\nproof was available until Enayat & Visser (2015) and Leigh\n(2015). Moreover, the theory given by PA + axioms 1–6 is relatively interpretable in PA. However, this result is sensitive to the choice of the base theory: it fails for finitely axiomatized theories (Heck 2015, Nicolai 2016). These proof-theoretic results have been used extensively in the discussion of truth-theoretic deflationism (see Cieśliński 2017). \nOf course PA + axioms 1–6 is restrictive insofar as it does not\ncontain the induction axioms in the language with the truth\npredicate.\n There are various labels for the system that is obtained by\nadding all induction axioms involving the truth predicate to the\nsystem PA + axioms 1–6: T(PA), CT, PA(S) or PA + ‘there is a\nfull inductive satisfaction class’. This theory is no longer\nconservative over its base theory PA. For instance one can formalise\nthe soundness theorem or global reflection principle for PA, that is,\nthe claim that all sentences provable in PA are true. The global\nreflection principle for PA in turn implies the consistency of PA,\nwhich is not provable in pure PA by\nGödel’s\n Second Incompleteness Theorem.\n Thus T(PA) is not conservative over PA. T(PA) is much\nstronger than the mere consistency statement for PA: T(PA) is\nequivalent to the second-order system ACA of arithmetical\ncomprehension (see Takeuti 1987 and Feferman 1991). More precisely,\nT(PA) and ACA are intertranslatable in a way that preserves all\narithmetical sentences. ACA is given by the axioms of PA with full\ninduction in the second-order language and the following comprehension\nprinciple: \nwhere \\(\\phi(x)\\) is any formula (in which \\(x\\) may or may\nnot be free) that does not contain any second-order quantifiers, but\npossibly free second-order variables. In T(PA), quantification\nover sets can be defined as quantification over formulas with\none free variable and membership as the truth of the formula as\napplied to a number.  \nAs the global reflection principle entails formal consistency, the conservativeness result for PA + axioms 1–6 implies that the global reflection principle for Peano arithmetic is not derivable in the typed compositional theory without expanding the induction axioms.\nIn fact, this theory proves neither the statement that all logical validities are true (global reflection for pure first-order logic) nor that all the Peano axioms of arithmetic are true.\nPerhaps surprisingly, of these two unprovable statements it is the former that is the stronger.\nThe latter can be added as an axiom and the theory remains conservative over PA (Enayat and Visser 2015, Leigh 2015).\nIn contrast, over PA + axioms 1–6, the global reflection principle for first-order logic is equivalent to global reflection for Peano arithmetic (Cieśliński 2010), and these two theories have the same arithmetic consequences as adding the axiom of induction for bounded \\((\\Delta_0)\\) formulas containing the truth predicate (Wcisło and Łełyk 2017).\n The transition from PA to T(PA) can be imagined as an act of reflection on the truth of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\)-sentences in PA. Similarly, the step from the typed \\(T\\)-sentences to the compositional axioms is also tied to a reflection principle, specifically the uniform reflection principle over the typed uniform \\(T\\)-sentences.\nThis is the collection of sentences \n\\(\\forall x\\, Bew_S (\\ulcorner \\phi(\\underline{x})\\urcorner) \\rightarrow \\phi\\)(x) where \\(\\phi\\) ranges over formulas in \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\) with one free variable and S is the theory of the uniform typed T-sentences.\nUniform reflection exactly captures the difference between the two theories: the reflection principle is both derivable in T(PA) and suffices to derive the six compositional axioms (Halbach 2001).\nMoreover, the equivalence extends to iterations of uniform reflection, in that for any ordinal \\(\\alpha , 1 + \\alpha\\) iterations of uniform reflection over the typed \\(T\\)-sentences coincides with T(PA) extended by transfinite induction up to the ordinal \\(\\varepsilon_{\\alpha}\\), namely the \\(\\alpha\\)-th ordinal with the property that \\(\\omega^{\\alpha} = \\alpha\\) (Leigh 2016).\n Much stronger fragments of second-order arithmetic can be\ninterpreted by type-free truth systems, that is, by theories of truth\nthat prove not only the truth of arithmetical sentences but also the\ntruth of sentences of the language \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\) with the truth\npredicate; see Section 4 below. The above mentioned theories of truth can be iterated by\nintroducing indexed truth predicates. One adds to the language of PA\ntruth predicates indexed by ordinals (or ordinal notations) or one\nadds a binary truth predicate that applies to ordinal notations and\nsentences. In this respect the hierarchical approach does not fit the\nframework outlined in Section 2, because the language\ndoes not feature a single unary truth predicate applying to sentences\nbut rather many unary truth predicates or a single binary truth\npredicate (or even a single unary truth predicate applying to pairs of\nordinal notations and sentences). In such a language an axiomatization of Tarski’s hierarchy of truth\npredicates can be formulated. On the proof-theoretic side iterating\ntruth theories in the style of T(PA) corresponds to iterating\nelementary comprehension, that is, to iterating ACA. The system of\niterated truth theories corresponds to the system of ramified analysis\n(see Feferman 1991).  Visser (1989) has studied non-wellfounded\nhierarchies of languages and axiomatizations thereof. If one adds\nthe \\(T\\)-sentences \\(T_n\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner \\leftrightarrow \\phi\\) to the language of arithmetic where \\(\\phi\\) contains only\ntruth predicates \\(T_k\\)\nwith \\(k\\gt n\\) to PA, a theory is\nobtained that does not have a standard \\((\\omega\\)-)model. The truth predicates in natural languages do not come with any\nouvert type restriction. Therefore typed theories of truth (axiomatic\nas well as semantic theories) have been thought to be inadequate for\nanalysing the truth predicate of natural language, although recently\nhierarchical theories have been advocated by Glanzberg (forthcoming)\nand others. This is one motive for investigating type-free theories of\ntruth, that is, systems of truth that allow one to prove the truth of\nsentences involving the truth predicate. Some type-free theories of\ntruth have much higher expressive power than the typed theories that\nhave been surveyed in the previous section (at least as long as\nindexed truth predicates are avoided). Therefore type-free theories of\ntruth are much more powerful tools in the reduction of other theories\n(for instance, second-order ones).  The set of\nall \\(T\\)-sentences \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner \\leftrightarrow \\phi\\), where \\(\\phi\\) is any sentence of the\nlanguage \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\), that\nis, where \\(\\phi\\) may contain \\(T\\), is inconsistent with PA (or\nany theory that proves the diagonal lemma) because of\nthe Liar paradox. Therefore one might\ntry to drop from the set of all \\(T\\)-sentences only those that\nlead to an inconsistency. In other words, one may consider maximal\nconsistent sets of \\(T\\)-sentences. McGee (1992) showed that\nthere are uncountably many maximal sets of \\(T\\)-sentences that\nare consistent with PA. So the strategy does not lead to a single\ntheory. Even worse, given an arithmetical sentence (i.e., a sentence\nnot containing \\(T)\\) that can neither be proved nor disproved in\nPA, one can find a consistent \\(T\\)-sentence that decides this\nsentence (McGee 1992). This implies that many consistent sets\nof \\(T\\)-sentences prove false arithmetical statements. Thus the\nstrategy to drop just the \\(T\\)-sentences that yield an\ninconsistency is doomed.  A set of \\(T\\)-sentences that does not imply any false\narithmetical statement may be obtained by allowing only those \\(\\phi\\)\nin \\(T\\)-sentences \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner \\leftrightarrow \\phi\\) that contain \\(T\\) only positively, that is, in the\nscope of an even number of negation symbols. Like the typed theory\nin Section 3.2 this theory does not prove\ncertain generalizations but proves the same T-free sentences as the\nstrong type-free compositional Kripke-Feferman theory below (Halbach\n2009). Schindler (2015) obtained a deductively very strong truth theory based on stratified disquotational principles. Besides the disquotational feature of truth, one would also like to\ncapture the compositional features of truth and generalize the axioms\nof typed compositional truth to the type-free case. To this end,\naxioms or rules concerning the truth of atomic sentences with the\ntruth predicate will have to be added and the restriction\nto \\(T\\)-free sentences in the compositional axioms will have to\nbe lifted. In order to treat truth like other predicates, one will add\nthe axiom\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[T{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow T{\\scriptsize A})\\) (where\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}\\) ranges over all sentences). If the\ntype restriction of the typed compositional axiom for\nnegation is removed, the axiom\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[\\neg{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow \\neg T{\\scriptsize A})\\) is obtained. However, the axioms\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[T{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow T{\\scriptsize A})\\) and\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[\\neg{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow \\neg T{\\scriptsize A})\\) are inconsistent over\nweak theories of syntax, so one of them has to be given up. If\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[\\neg{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow \\neg T{\\scriptsize A})\\) is retained, one will\nhave to find weaker axioms or rules for truth iteration, but truth\nremains a classical concept in the sense that\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[\\neg{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow \\neg T{\\scriptsize A})\\) implies the law of\nexcluded middle (for any sentence either the sentence itself or its\nnegation is true) and the law of noncontradiction (for no sentence the\nsentence itself and its negation are true). If, in contrast,\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[\\neg{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow \\neg T{\\scriptsize A})\\) is rejected and\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[T{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow T{\\scriptsize A})\\) retained, then it will\nbecome provable that either some sentences are true together with\ntheir negations or that for some sentences neither they nor their\nnegations are true, and thus systems of non-classical truth are\nobtained, although the systems themselves are still formulated in\nclassical logic. In the next two sections we overview the most\nprominent system of each kind. The system FS, named after Friedman and Sheard (1987), retains the\nnegation axiom\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[\\neg{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow \\neg T{\\scriptsize A})\\). The further\ncompositional axioms are obtained by lifting the type restriction to\ntheir untyped counterparts: \n If \\(\\phi\\) is a theorem, one may infer\n \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\), and conversely, if\n \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) is a theorem, one may\n infer \\(\\phi\\).  It follows from results due to McGee (1985) that FS is\n\\(\\omega\\)-inconsistent, that is, FS proves\n\\(\\exists x\\neg \\phi(x)\\), but proves also \\(\\phi\\)(0),\n\\(\\phi\\)(1), \\(\\phi\\)(2), … for some formula \\(\\phi(x)\\)\nof \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\). The\narithmetical theorems of FS, however, are all correct. In FS one can define all finite levels of the classical Tarskian\nhierarchy, but FS isn’t strong enough to allow one to recover\nany of its transfinite levels. Indeed, Halbach (1994) determined its\nproof-theoretic strength to be precisely that of the theory of\nramified truth for all finite levels (i.e., finitely iterated T(PA);\nsee Section 3.4) or, equivalently, the theory of\nramified analysis for all finite levels. If either direction of the\nrule is dropped but the other kept, FS retains its proof-theoretic\nstrength (Sheard 2001). It is a virtue of FS that it is thoroughly classical: It is\nformulated in classical logic; if a sentence is provably true in FS,\nthen the sentence itself is provable in FS; and conversely if a\nsentence is provable, then it is also provably true. Its drawback is\nits \\(\\omega\\)-inconsistency. FS may be seen as an axiomatization of\nrule-of-revision semantics for all finite levels (see the entry on\nthe revision theory of truth). The Kripke–Feferman theory retains the truth iteration axiom\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[T{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow T{\\scriptsize A})\\), but the notion of truth\naxiomatized is no longer classical because the negation axiom\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[\\neg{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\leftrightarrow \\neg T{\\scriptsize A})\\) is dropped.  The semantical construction captured by this theory is a\ngeneralization of the Tarskian typed inductive definition of truth\ncaptured by T(PA). In the generalized definition one starts with the\ntrue atomic sentence of the arithmetical language and then one\ndeclares true the complex sentences depending on whether its\ncomponents are true or not. For instance, as in the typed case, if\n\\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are true, their conjunction \\(\\phi \\wedge \\psi\\) will be\ntrue as well. In the case of the quantified sentences their truth\nvalue is determined by the truth values of their instances (one could\nrender the quantifier clauses purely compositional by using a\nsatisfaction predicate); for instance, a universally quantified\nsentence will be declared true if and only if all its instances are\ntrue. One can now extend this inductive definition of truth to the\nlanguage \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\) by\ndeclaring a sentence of the\nform \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) true\nif \\(\\phi\\) is already true. Moreover one will declare\n\\(\\neg T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) true if\n\\(\\neg \\phi\\) is true. By making this idea precise, one obtains a variant\nof Kripke’s (1975) theory of truth with the so called Strong Kleene\nvaluation scheme (see the entry\non many-valued logic). If\naxiomatized it leads to the following system, which is known as KF\n(‘Kripke–Feferman’), of which several variants\nappear in the literature: \nApart from the truth-theoretic axioms, KF comprises all axioms of PA\nand all induction axioms involving the truth predicate. The system is\ncredited to Feferman on the basis of two lectures for the Association\nof Symbolic Logic, one in 1979 and the second in 1983, as well as in\nsubsequent manuscripts. Feferman published his version of the system\nunder the label Ref(PA) (‘weak reflective closure of PA’)\nonly in 1991, after several other versions of KF had already appeared\nin print (e.g., Reinhardt 1986, Cantini 1989, who both refer to this\nunpublished work by Feferman). KF itself is formulated in classical logic, but it describes a\nnon-classical notion of truth. For instance, one can\nprove \\(T\\ulcorner L\\urcorner \\leftrightarrow T\\ulcorner\\neg L\\urcorner\\)\nif \\(L\\) is the Liar sentence. Thus KF proves that either both\nthe liar sentence and its negation are true or that neither is\ntrue. So either is the notion of truth paraconsistent (a sentence is\ntrue together with its negation) or paracomplete (neither is\ntrue). Some authors have augmented KF with an axiom ruling out\ntruth-value gluts, which makes KF sound for Kripke’s model\nconstruction, because Kripke had ruled out truth-value gluts. Feferman (1991) showed that KF is proof-theoretically equivalent to\nthe theory of ramified analysis through all levels below\n\\(\\varepsilon_0\\), the limit of the sequence \\(\\omega ,\n\\omega^{\\omega},\n\\omega^{\\omega^{ \\omega} },\\ldots\\), or a theory of\nramified truth through the same ordinals. This result shows that in KF\nexactly \\(\\varepsilon_0\\) many levels of the classical Tarskian\nhierarchy in its axiomatized form can be recovered. Thus KF is far\nstronger than FS, let alone T(PA). Feferman (1991) devised also a\nstrengthening of KF that is as strong as full predicative analysis,\nthat is ramified analysis or truth up to the ordinal\n\\(\\Gamma_0\\). Just as with the typed truth predicate, the theory KF (more precisely, a common variant of it) can be obtained via an act of reflection on a system of untyped \\(T\\)-sentences. The system of \\(T\\)-sentences in question is the extension of the uniform positive untyped \\(T\\)-sentences by a primitive falsity predicate, that is, the theory features two unary predicates \\(T\\) and \\(F\\) and axioms \nfor every formula \\(\\phi(v)\\) positive in both \\(T\\) and \\(F\\), where \\(\\phi '\\) represents the De Morgan dual of \\(\\phi\\) (exchanging \\(T\\) for \\(F\\) and vice versa).\nFrom an application of uniform reflection over this disquotational theory, the truth axioms for the corresponding two predicate version of KF are derivable (Horsten and Leigh, 2016). The converse also holds, as does the generalisation to finite and transfinite iterations of reflection (Leigh, 2017).\n As remarked above, if KF\nproves \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) for some\nsentence \\(\\phi\\) then \\(\\phi\\) holds in all Kripke fixed point models. In\nparticular, there are \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\) fixed\npoints that form a model of the internal theory of KF. Thus from the\nperspective of KF, the least fixed point (from which Kripke’s theory\nis defined) is not singled out. Burgess (forthcoming) provides an\nexpansion of KF, named \\(\\mu\\)KF, that attempts to capture the minimal\nKripkean fixed point. KF is expanded by additional axioms that express\nthat the internal theory of KF is the smallest class closed under the\ndefining axioms for Kripkean truth. This can be formulated as a single\naxiom schema that states, for each open formula \\(\\phi\\),  \n If \\(\\phi\\) satisfies the same axioms of KF as the predicate \\(T\\)\n then \\(\\phi\\) holds of every true sentence.\n \nFrom a proof-theoretic perspective \\(\\mu\\)KF is significantly stronger\nthan KF. The single axiom schema expressing the minimality of the\ntruth predicate allows one to embed into \\(\\mu\\)KF the system\nID\\(_1\\) of one arithmetical inductive definition, an\nimpredicative theory. While intuitively plausible, \\(\\mu\\)KF suffers the\nsame expressive incompleteness as KF: Since the minimal Kripkean fixed\npoint forms a complete \\(\\Pi^{1}_1\\) set and the\ninternal theory of \\(\\mu\\)KF remains recursively enumerable, there are\nstandard models of the theory in which the interpretation of the truth\npredicate is not actually the minimal fixed point. At present there\nlacks a thorough analysis of the models of \\(\\mu\\)KF.\n KF is intended to be an axiomatization of Kripke’s (1975)\nsemantical theory. This theory is based on partial logic with the\nStrong Kleene evaluation scheme. In Strong Kleene logic not every\nsentence \\(\\phi \\vee \\neg \\phi\\) is a theorem; in particular, this\ndisjunction is not true if \\(\\phi\\) lacks a truth\nvalue. Consequently \\(T\\ulcorner L\\vee \\neg L\\urcorner\\)\n(where \\(L\\) is the Liar sentence) is not a theorem of KF and its\nnegation is even provable. Cantini (1990) has proposed a system VF\nthat is inspired by the supervaluations scheme. In VF all classical\ntautologies are provably true\nand \\(T\\ulcorner L \\vee \\neg L\\urcorner\\), for instance, is a theorem of\nVF. VF can be formulated\nin \\(\\mathcal{L}_T\\) and uses\nclassical logic. It is no longer a compositional theory of\ntruth, for the following is not a theorem of VF: Not only is this principle inconsistent with the other axioms of\nVF, it does not fit the supervaluationist model for it\nimplies \\(T\\ulcorner L\\urcorner \\vee T\\ulcorner \\neg L\\urcorner\\),\nwhich of course is not correct because according to the intended\nsemantics neither the liar sentence nor its negation is true: both\nlack a truth value. Extending a result due to Friedman and Sheard (1987), Cantini\nshowed that VF is much stronger than KF: VF is proof-theoretically\nequivalent to the theory ID\\(_1\\) of non-iterated inductive\ndefinitions, which is not predicative.  The theories of truth discussed thus far are all axiomatized in\nclassical logic. Some authors have also looked into axiomatic theories\nof truth based on non-classical logic (see, for example, Field 2008,\nHalbach and Horsten 2006, Leigh and Rathjen 2012). There are a number\nof reasons why a logic weaker than classical logic may be\npreferred. The most obvious is that by weakening the logic, some\ncollections of axioms of truth that were previously inconsistent\nbecome consistent. Another common reason is that the axiomatic theory\nin question intends to capture a particular non-classical semantics of\ntruth, for which a classical background theory may prove unsound. The inconsistency of the \\(T\\)-sentences does not rely on\nclassical reasoning. It is also inconsistent over much weaker logics\nsuch as minimal logic and partial logic. However, classical logic does\nplay a role in restricting the free use of principles of truth. For\ninstance, over a classical base theory, the compositional axiom for\nimplication \\((\\rightarrow)\\) is equivalent to the principle of completeness,\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[{\\scriptsize A}] \\vee T[\\neg{\\scriptsize A}\\)]). If the logic under\nthe truth predicate is classical, completeness is equivalent to the compositional axiom for disjunction. Without the law of\nexcluded middle, FS can be formulated as a fully compositional theory\nwhile not proving the truth-completeness principle (Leigh & Rathjen\n2012). In addition, classical logic has an effect on attempts to\ncombine compositional and self-applicable axioms of truth. If, for\nexample, one drops the axiom of truth-consistency from FS (the\nleft-to-right direction of axiom 2 in Section 4.3)\nas well as the law of excluded middle for the truth predicate, it is\npossible to add consistently the truth-iteration axiom\n\\(\\forall{\\scriptsize A}(T[{\\scriptsize A}]\n\\rightarrow T[T{\\scriptsize A}])\\).\nThe resulting theory\nstill bears a strong resemblance to FS in that the constructive\nversion of the rule-of-revision semantics for all finite levels\nprovides a natural model of the theory, and the two theories share the same \\(\\Pi^{0}_2\\) consequences (Leigh & Rathjen 2012; Leigh, 2013). \nThis result should be contrasted with KF which, if formulated\nwithout the law of excluded middle, remains maximally consistent with\nrespect to its choice of truth axioms but is a conservative extension of\nHeyting arithmetic. Kripke’s (1975) theory in its different guises is based on partial\nlogic. In order to obtain models for a theory in classical logic, the\nextension of the truth predicate in the partial model is used again as\nthe extension of truth in the classical model. In the classical model\nfalse sentences and those without a truth value in the partial model\nare declared not true. KF is sound with respect to these classical\nmodels and thus incorporates two distinct logics. The first is the\n‘internal’ logic of statements under the truth predicate\nand is formulated with the Strong Kleene valuation schema. The second\nis the ‘external’ logic which is full classical logic. An\neffect of formulating KF in classical logic is that the theory cannot\nbe consistently closed under the truth-introduction rule\n \n If \\(\\phi\\) is a theorem of KF, so is\n \\(T\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\).\n \nA second effect of classical logic is the statement of the excluded\nmiddle for the liar sentence. Neither the Liar sentence nor its\nnegation obtains a truth value in Kripke’s theory, so the disjunction\nof the two is not valid. The upshot is that KF, if viewed as an\naxiomatisation of Kripke’s theory, is not sound with respect to its\nintended semantics. For this reason Halbach and Horsten (2006) and\nHorsten (2011) explore an axiomatization of Kripke’s theory with\npartial logic as inner and outer logic. Their suggestion, a\ntheory labelled PKF (‘partial KF’), can be axiomatised as\na Gentzen-style two-sided sequent calculus based on Strong Kleene\nlogic (see the entry on many-valued\nlogic). PKF is formed by adding to this calculus the\nPeano–Dedekind axioms of arithmetic including full induction and\nthe compositional and truth-iteration rules for the truth predicate as\nproscribed by Kripke’s theory. The result is a theory of truth that is\nsound with respect to Kripke’s theory.\n Halbach and Horsten show that this axiomatization of Kripke’s\ntheory is significantly weaker than it’s classical cousin KF. The\nresult demonstrates that restricting logic only for sentences with the\ntruth predicate can hamper also the derivation of truth-free theorems.\n Field (2008) and others criticised theories based on partial logic\nfor the absence of a ‘proper’ conditional and\nbi-conditional. Various authors have proposed conditionals and\nbi-conditionals that are not definable in terms of \\(\\neg , \\vee\\) and\n\\(\\wedge\\). Field (2008) aims at an axiomatic theory of truth not\ndissimilar to PKF but with a new conditional. Feferman (1984) also\nintroduced a bi-conditional to a theory in non-classical logic. Unlike\nField’s and his own 1984 theory, Feferman’s (2008) theory DT is\nformulated in classical logic, but it’s internal logic is again a\npartial logic with a strong conditional.","contact.mail":"graham.leigh@gu.se","contact.domain":"gu.se"}]
