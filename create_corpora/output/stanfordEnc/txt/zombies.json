Yet zombies\nbehave just like us, and some even spend a lot of time discussing\nconsciousness.\n\n\nFew people, if any, think zombies actually exist. But many hold that\nthey are at least conceivable, and some that they are possible. It\nseems that if zombies really are possible, then physicalism is false\nand some kind of dualism is true. For many philosophers that is the\nchief importance of the zombie idea. But it is also valuable for the\nsharp focus it gives to philosophical theorizing about consciousness\nand other aspects of the mind (see for example Howell 2013; Kriegel\n2011; Stoljar 2006; Tye 2008). Use of the zombie idea against\nphysicalism also raises more general questions about the relations\nbetween imaginability, conceivability, and possibility. Finally,\nzombies raise epistemological difficulties: they reinstate the\n‘other minds’ problem.\n\nDescartes held that non-human animals are automata: their behavior is\nwholly explicable in terms of physical mechanisms. But human behavior\n(he argued) could not be explained in that way. Exploring the idea of\na machine that would look and behave like a human being, he thought\ntwo things would unmask it: it could not use language creatively, and\nit could not produce appropriate non-verbal behavior in arbitrarily\nvarious situations (Discourse V). For him, therefore, no\nmachine could behave like a human being. Knowing only seventeenth\ncentury technology, he concluded that to explain distinctively human\nbehavior required something beyond the physical: an immaterial mind,\ninteracting with processes in the brain and the rest of the body. (He\nhad a priori arguments for the same conclusion, one of which\nanticipates the ‘conceivability argument’ discussed in\nSection 3 below.) If he is right, there could not be a world\nphysically like the actual world but lacking such minds: human bodies\nwould not work properly. If we suddenly lost our minds our bodies\nmight continue to run on for a while: our hearts might continue to\nbeat, we might breathe while asleep and digest food; we might even\nwalk or sing in a mindless sort of way (so he implies in his Reply\nto Objections IV). But without the contribution made by minds,\nbehavior could not show characteristically human features. So although\nDescartes did everything short of spelling out the idea of zombies,\nthe question of their possibility did not arise for him. The nearest\nthing was automata whose behavior was easily recognizable as not fully\nhuman. \nIn the nineteenth century scientists began to think that physics was\ncapable of explaining all physical events that were explicable at all.\nIt seemed that every physical effect has a physical cause: that the\nphysical world is ‘closed under causation’. The developing\nscience of neurophysiology was set to extend such explanations to\nhuman behavior. But if human behavior is explicable physically, how\ndoes consciousness fit into the story? One response —\nphysicalism (or materialism) — is to insist that consciousness\ntoo involves only physical processes. However, the phenomena of\nconsciousness are hard to account for in those terms, and some\nthinkers concluded that something nonphysical must be involved. Given\nthe causal closure of the physical, they were forced to conclude that\nconsciousness has no effects on the physical world. On this view human\nbeings are ‘conscious automata’, as T. H. Huxley put it:\nall physical events, human behavior included, are explicable in terms\nof physical processes; and the phenomena of consciousness are causally\ninert by-products — epiphenomena (see James 1890, Chapter 5). It\neventually became clear that this view entailed that there could be\npurely physical organisms exactly like us except for lacking\nconsciousness. G. F. Stout (1931) argued that if epiphenomenalism (the\nmore familiar name for the ‘conscious automaton’ theory)\nis true, \nWhat Stout describes here and finds prima facie incredible is\na zombie world: an entire world whose physical processes are closed\nunder causation (as the epiphenomenalists he was attacking held) and\nexactly duplicate those in the actual world, but where there are no\nconscious experiences. \nSimilar ideas were current in discussions of physicalism in the 1970s.\nAs a counterexample to the psychophysical identity theory there was an\n‘imitation man’, whose ‘brain-states exactly\nparalleled ours in their physico-chemical properties’ but who\nfelt no pains and saw no colors (Campbell 1970). It was claimed that\nzombies are a counterexample to physicalism in general, and arguments\nwere devised to back up the intuition that they are possible (Kirk\n1974a, 1974b: he argued that physicalism commits one to the\n‘Entailment Thesis’, by which the purely physical truths\nabout the world entail mental truths by logical or conceptual\nnecessity). Other kinds of systems were envisaged which behaved like\nnormal human beings, or were even functionally like human beings, but\nlacked the ‘qualia’ we have (Block 1980a, 1980b, 1981;\nShoemaker 1975, 1981). (See the entry on\n qualia.\n Roughly, qualia are the properties by which we classify experiences\naccording to ‘what they are like’: what it is like to\nsmell roasting coffee beans, for example. Even physicalists can\nconsistently use this expression, although unlike dualists they take\nqualia to be physical.) The most systematic use of the zombie idea\nagainst physicalism is by David Chalmers (1996), whose contributions\nto the debate will be considered shortly. \nIf zombies are to be counterexamples to physicalism, it is not enough\nfor them to be behaviorally and functionally like normal human beings:\nplenty of physicalists accept that merely behavioral or functional\nduplicates of ourselves might lack qualia. Zombies must be like normal\nhuman beings in all physical respects, and they must have the\nphysical properties that physicalists suppose we have. (For the use of\na different kind of zombies in epistemology, see Lyons 2009; for an\ninteresting other kind, which however does not threaten physicalism,\nsee Olson 2018.) This requires them to be subject to the causal\nclosure of the physical, which is why their supposed lack of\nconsciousness is a challenge to physicalism. If, instead, they were to\nbe conceived of as creatures whose behavior could not be explained\nphysically, physicalists would have no reason to bother with the idea:\nthere is plenty of evidence that, as epiphenomenalists hold, our\nmovements actually are explicable in physical terms (see e.g. Papineau\n2002). \nThe usual assumption is that none of us is actually a zombie, and that\nzombies cannot exist in our world. The central question, however, is\nnot whether zombies can exist in our world, but whether they, or a\nwhole zombie world (which is sometimes a more appropriate idea to work\nwith), are possible in some broader sense. \nA metaphor of Saul Kripke’s helps to show how the zombie idea\nthreatens physicalism (Kripke 1972/80, 153f.). Imagine God creating\nthe world and deciding to bring into existence the whole of the\nphysical universe. Having created this purely physical universe, did\nhe have to do any more work to provide for consciousness? Answering\nyes to this question implies there is more to consciousness than the\npurely physical facts alone can supply. If nothing else, it implies\nthat consciousness depends at least partly on nonphysical properties,\nones that would not exist in a purely physical world; it would be a\nzombie world. Physicalists, on the other hand, are committed to\nanswering no. They have to say that by fixing the purely physical\nfacts, God did everything that was needed to fix the mental facts\nabout the organisms thereby created, including their thoughts,\nfeelings, emotions, and experiences. And if fixing the physical facts\nis alone enough to fix the mental facts, then it seems that a zombie\nworld is impossible. \nHowever, not everyone agrees that physicalism entails the\nimpossibility of zombies. One suggestion is that physicalists can\nconcede there are possible worlds which are exact duplicates of our\nworld in all purely physical respects, but where the physical\nproperties which give rise to consciousness in our world are prevented\nfrom doing so by nonphysical items which block consciousness. That\nwould let physicalists consistently allow the possibility of zombie\nworlds (Leuenberger 2008. On such ‘blockers’ see Hawthorne\n2002b; Chalmers 2010, 163–165). This approach, however, is\nobviously inconsistent with maintaining that conscious states are\neither identical with or constituted by physical or functional states.\nSo it is not clear that physicalists can consistently allow the\npossibility of consciousness-blockers. \nIn any case, what kind of impossibility is relevant here? Physicalists\ncannot just say zombies are ruled out by the laws of nature, since\neven dualists can agree they are impossible in that sense: that it is\nby nomological necessity that the physical facts about us\nbring consciousness with them. Physicalism therefore needs something\nstronger.  \nTwo further kinds of necessity are available: metaphysical and\nlogical. Now, many philosophers (largely influenced by the zombie\nidea) believe the connection from physical facts to consciousness\ncannot be logical even in a broad sense. And certainly the conceptual\nscheme of physics does not appear to enable logical links\nfrom the physical to the experiential or phenomenal (see e.g. Kriegel\n2011; Stoljar 2006). However, some argue that nevertheless zombies are\nnot really conceivable at all (Kirk 2005, 2008, 2013; Tye 2006); Kirk\n(2013) also maintains that although the physical facts do not entail\nthe truth about conscious experience a priori, they\nnevertheless entail it by logical necessity.  \nStill, many physicalists hold that what guarantees the impossibility\nof zombies is ‘metaphysical’ necessity. Typically they\nmaintain that states of phenomenal consciousness are identical with\nphysical states, and that these identities are necessary a posteriori\nas argued by Kripke (see e.g. McLaughlin 2005, and for criticism,\nStoljar 2000). But the vocabulary of possibility and necessity is\nslippery. For example there is disagreement over whether logical and\nmetaphysical possibility are different (see supervenience,\nSection 3.1); when Kripke (1972/80) writes of ‘logical’\nand ‘metaphysical’ possibility he seems to use those words\ninterchangeably (Yablo 1999: 457n.), and some use ‘logical’\nwhere others prefer ‘conceptual’ (Chalmers 1999: 477);\ncompare Latham 2000, 72f.). \nMany think that if the physical facts entail consciousness by\nmetaphysical necessity, then physicalists can maintain that even\nthough zombies are metaphysically impossible, they are still\nconceivable (Balog 2012; Loar 1990/97; McLaughlin 2005;\nSections 5.1, 5.2 below). To the contrary, Chalmers argues that\nconceivability actually entails metaphysical possibility. If he is\nright, then that popular brand of physicalism is mistaken. The\nso-called ‘conceivability argument’ for the possibility of\nzombies will provide a focus for discussing some of the main problems\nraised by the zombie idea. \nThe simplest version of this argument goes: \n(Kripke used a similar argument in his 1972/80. For versions of it see\nChalmers 1996, 93–171; 2010, 141–205; Levine 2001; Nagel\n1974; Stoljar 2001.) Clearly the conceivability argument is valid. However, both its\npremisses are problematic. They are unclear as stated, and\ncontroversial even when clarified. A key question is how we should\nunderstand ‘conceivable’ in this context. \nMany philosophers are willing to concede that zombies are conceivable\nin some sense (e.g. Hill 1997; Hill and McLaughlin 1999; Loar 1999;\nYablo 1999). However, that sense is sometimes quite broad. For\nexample, a claim that ‘there are no substantive a priori ties\nbetween the concept of pain and the concept of C-fiber\nstimulation’ has been backed up by the point that ‘it is\nin principle possible to master either of these concepts fully without\nhaving mastered the other’ (Hill 1997, 76). By that standard,\nthough, it would be conceivable that the ratio of a circle’s\ncircumference to its diameter is a rational number, when it\nisn’t. If conceivability in that sense entailed possibility, it\nwould be both possible and impossible for the ratio to be rational;\nwhich would make such conceivability useless for the purposes of the\nconceivability argument. So understood, premiss (1) of the argument\nwould be easy to swallow; but (2) would have to be rejected.\nEvidently, the lower the threshold for conceivability, the easier it\nis to accept (1) — but the harder it is to accept (2). So the\nkind of conceivability invoked in premisses (1) and (2) needs to be\nstrongly constrained. A common and useful definition, which will be\nfollowed here, is: cannot be known a priori to be false; so A\nis conceivable if and only if not-A cannot be ruled out a priori. (For\nsophistication of these and related ideas see Chalmers 1999, 477;\n2002; 2007; 2010; 5.1 below.)  \nJoseph Levine discusses a version of the conceivability argument in\nhis 2001. He views the conceivability of zombies as ‘the\nprincipal manifestation of the explanatory gap’ (79). What\ncreates this gap, in his view, is the epistemological problem\nof explaining how the phenomenal is related to the physical. He sees\nno way to solve this problem, and thinks it remains even if zombies\nare impossible. \nCampbell, Copeland and Deng 2017 argue that, quite generally, for any conceivability argument there is a corresponding ‘mirror argument’ which can be rejected only at the cost of undermining the main argument, and conclude that all conceivability arguments are ‘logically bankrupt’.\n \nWe now face two key questions: Are zombies conceivable in the sense\nexplained? If they are conceivable, does it follow that they are\npossible? Only if the answer to both questions is yes will the\nconceivability argument succeed. We can take them in that order. \nThose who exploited the zombie idea in the 1970s typically assumed\nwithout argument that zombies are not just conceivable but possible\n(e. g. Campbell 1970, Nagel 1970). When Chalmers reactivated the idea,\nhe found the conceivability of zombies ‘obvious’,\nremarking that ‘it certainly seems that a coherent situation is\ndescribed; I can discern no contradiction in the description’\n(1996, p. 96). However, he also recognized that this intuition cannot\nbe relied on. The nature of conscious experience is after all hard to\nunderstand: what strikes some people as obviously possible could still\nturn out to harbour hidden contradictions (Nagel 1998; Stoljar 2001).\nClearly, those who maintain that zombies are conceivable must provide\njustification, recognizing that, being an epistemic claim dependent on\nour cognitive abilities, it is defeasible. \nKirk (1974a, 1974b) attempted to provide such justification, in the\nform of arguments intended to show that zombies are possible (hence\nconceivable). However, they fall well short of their target, depending\non much the same cluster of intuitions as the original idea. Chalmers\n(1996) presented a series of five arguments against the view that\nthere is an a priori entailment from physical facts to mental\nfacts. Each argument would directly or indirectly reinforce the\nintuitive appeal of the zombie idea. The first will be considered\nshortly; the other four appeal respectively to the alleged possibility\nof ‘inverted spectrum’ without physical difference (see\ninverted qualia); the alleged impossibility of learning about\nconscious experience on the basis of purely physical information;\nJackson’s (1982) ‘knowledge argument’ (related to\nthe last); and what Chalmers calls ‘the absence of\nanalysis’: the point being that his opponents ‘will have\nto give us some idea of how the existence of consciousness\nmight be entailed by the physical facts’, when ‘any\nattempt to demonstrate such an entailment is doomed to failure’\n(1996, p. 104).  \nHis first argument goes roughly as follows. Suppose a population of\ntiny people disable your brain and replicate its functions themselves,\nwhile keeping the rest of your body in working order (see Block\n1980a); each homunculus uses a cell phone to perform the\nsignal-receiving and -transmitting functions of an individual neuron.\nWould such a system be conscious? Intuitively one may be inclined to\nsay not. Some, notably functionalists, bite the bullet and answer yes.\nHowever, the argument does not depend on assuming that the\nhomunculus-head would not be conscious. It depends only on the\nassumption that its not being conscious is conceivable\n— which many people find reasonable. In Chalmers’s words,\nall that matters here is that when we say the system might lack\nconsciousness, ‘a meaningful possibility is being expressed, and\nit is an open question whether consciousness arises or not’\n(1996, p. 97). If he is right, then conceivably the system is not\nconscious. In that case it is already very much like a zombie, the\nonly difference being that it has little people where a zombie has\nneurons. And why should that make a difference to whether the\nsituation is conceivable? Why should switching from homunculi to\nneurons necessarily switch on the light of consciousness? (For doubts\nabout the assumption that it is conceivable that the homunculus-head\nlacks consciousness, see e.g. Loar 1990/1997, pp. 613f.) \nOther considerations favoring the conceivability of zombies can be\nfound in Block (1995, 2002); Levine (2001); Searle (1992). Chalmers\n(2010) develops his defense further; see 5.1 below. \nAlthough in the past it was quite widely accepted that zombies are\nconceivable, skepticism has been growing. Before considering some\ndirect attacks on the idea, let us briefly recall three views which\nonce seemed to support the claim that we can know a priori\nthat dualism is false — hence, on reasonable assumptions, that\nzombies are inconceivable.  \nThe first is verificationism, according to which a\n(declarative) sentence is meaningful just in case its truth or falsity\ncan be verified. This entails that unverifiable sentences are\nliterally meaningless, so that no metaphysical claim according to\nwhich unobservable nonphysical items exist can be true. However, since\nour ability to think and talk about our experiences is itself a\nproblem for verificationism, to presuppose this view when attacking\nthe zombie idea would beg the question. The second view appeals to\nWittgenstein’s private language argument. Although not crudely\nverificationistic, it depends on the assumption that in order for\nwords to be meaningful, their use must be open to public checking. But\nsince this checkability assumption, if sound, would prove that we\ncannot talk about qualia in the ways defenders of the zombie\npossibility think we can, it too seems question-begging in the present\ncontext. According to the third view, behaviorism, there is\nno more to having mental states than being disposed to behave in\ncertain ways. As a possible basis for attacking the zombie idea,\nbehaviorism is in a similar situation to verificationism and the\nprivate language argument. Zombies would satisfy all behavioral\nconditions for full consciousness, so that if we could know a priori\nthat behaviorism was correct, zombie worlds would be inconceivable for\nthat reason. It seems unlikely, though, that behaviorism can be shown\nto be correct. (Dennett 1991 defends a position with strong affinities\nto behaviorism, though it might be better classified as a variety of\nfunctionalism).  \nFunctionalism is a much more widely supported approach to the mental.\nAccording to it, mental states are not just a matter of behavior and\ndispositions, but of causal or other functional relations among\nsensory inputs, internal states, and behavioral outputs. Note that\nunless the nature of the internal processing is taken into account as\nwell, functionalism falls to most of the usual objections to\nbehaviorism, for example the ‘homunculus-head’ described\nin the last section; it therefore seems that any plausible\nfunctionalism must take account of internal functions not necessarily\nreflected in behavioral dispositions. Now, since zombies would satisfy\nall the functional conditions for full consciousness, functionalism\nentails that zombies are impossible, although it would obviously be\nquestion-begging simply to presuppose functionalism when attacking the\nzombie idea. However, increasingly sophisticated versions of\nfunctionalism are being developed, and any arguments for functionalism\nare a fortiori arguments against the possibility of zombies. (For some\ndefenses of functionalism against zombies see Dennett 1991; 1995;\n1999; Kirk 2017; Shoemaker 1999; Tye 2006; 2008; for doubts about\nfunctionalism’s capacity to deal with zombies see for example\nHarnad 1995.) \nApart from broad-front functionalist theories of the mental, there are\nmore narrowly focused attacks on the conceivability of zombies, some\nof which are noted below.  \nCan we really imagine zombies? Daniel Dennett thinks those\nwho accept the conceivability of zombies have failed to imagine them\nthoroughly enough: ‘they invariably underestimate the task of\nconception (or imagination), and end up imagining something that\nviolates their own definition’ (1995, p. 322. Marcus 2004 makes\na related point; see also Woodling 2014). Given his broadly\nfunctionalist model of consciousness, he argues, we can see why the\n‘putative contrast between zombies and conscious beings is\nillusory’ (325. See also his 1991; 1999). Consciousness is\n‘not a single wonderful separable thing … but a huge\ncomplex of many different informational capacities’ (1995, 324.\nCottrell 1999 supports this approach). \nZombies’ utterances. Suppose I smell roasting coffee\nbeans and say, ‘Mm! I love that smell!’. Everyone would\nrightly assume I was talking about my experience. But now suppose my\nzombie twin produces the same utterance. He too seems to be talking\nabout an experience, but in fact he isn’t because he’s\njust a zombie. Is he mistaken? Is he lying? Could his utterance\nsomehow be interpreted as true, or is it totally without truth value?\nNigel Thomas (1996) argues that ‘any line that zombiphiles take\non these questions will get them into serious trouble’. \nKnowing about and referring to qualia. Recall that by\ndefinition a zombie world is just like our world as physicalists\nsuppose it to be, but without consciousness. Since this implies that\nconsciousness depends on something nonphysical, it follows that\nzombies (assuming they are possible in the first place) could be made\nconscious by the addition of something nonphysical, which might as\nwell be qualia. And given that a zombie world would be causally\nclosed, these qualia would have to be causally inert: either\nepiphenomenal or parallel to the correlated physical processes. It\ntherefore seems that if a zombie world is conceivable then so is\nepiphenomenalism. (Note that this does not require epiphenomenalism to\nbe actually true as well as conceivable.) If that is correct,\nobjections to the conceivability of epiphenomenalism are also\nobjections to the conceivability of zombies. The most obvious is the\nfamiliar and powerful claim that experiences have effects on behavior\n(Perry 2001). A less obvious objection to epiphenomenalism starts from\nthe fact that we refer to and know about our conscious\nexperiences — which can hardly be denied, since otherwise we\ncould not be discussing these ideas in the first place. The objection\nappeals to the widely held view that whatever we can know or refer to\nmust have effects on us, even if only indirectly (Kripke 1972/80). On\nthat basis, our counterparts in epiphenomenalistic worlds could not\nknow about or refer to their qualia. If that is right,\nepiphenomenalistic worlds are not conceivable, in which case neither\nare zombies. \nTo this attack Chalmers replies that the crucial consideration is that\nwe are ‘acquainted’ with our experiences. This\n‘intimate epistemic relation’ both ensures that we can\nrefer to experiences and also justifies our claims to know about them.\nSince, in contrast, our zombie twins have no experiences, what appear\nto be their judgments about experience are unjustified. Chalmers\nsuggests that even if qualia have no causal influence on our\njudgments, their mere presence in the appropriate physical context\nensures that our thoughts are about those qualia. He thinks it also\nconstitutes justification for our knowledge claims even if experiences\nare not explanatorily relevant to making the judgments in question\n(Chalmers 1996, 172—209; 1999, 493f; see also his 2003,\n2010). \nThe problem of epistemic contact. Just now it seemed that if\nzombies are conceivable, then epiphenomenalist and parallelist worlds\nare also conceivable. In that case the friends of zombies must explain\nhow the epiphenomenal qualia in such worlds could possibly be objects\nof acquaintance, or indeed make any sort of intimate contribution to\npeople’s lives; and here Kirk (2005; 2008) suggests the zombie\nidea faces a further difficulty. This emerges when we consider such\nthings as attending to, thinking about, remembering, and comparing our\nexperiences: activities that bring us into ‘epistemic\ncontact’ with them. Such activities involve cognitive\nprocessing, which in turn involves changes causing other changes.\nSince epiphenomenal qualia are causally inert, they themselves could\nnot do that processing; so if they actually constitute our experiences\n(as epiphenomenalism and parallelism imply) then the necessary\nprocessing must be done by the body. The trouble is that the zombie\nstory makes it impossible for such processing to put us into epistemic\ncontact with epiphenomenal qualia. This is because the only resources\nit can appeal to for that purpose are the assumed causation of qualia\nby neural processes and their isomorphism with them: factors which\n(Kirk argues) cannot do the necessary cognitive work. If that is\nright, the notions of epiphenomenal qualia and zombies lead to a\ncontradiction. They imply a conception of consciousness which requires\npeople to be in epistemic contact with their qualia, while at the same\ntime ruling out the possibility of such contact. \n‘Powerful qualities’. An interesting recent\nobjection to the zombie idea is based on the (controversial) idea of\n‘powerful qualities’: the view that all properties are\nboth dispositional and qualitative, and indeed that a thing’s\ndispositions are identical with its qualities. Alexander Carruth\n(2016), for example, argues that the conceivability argument\npresupposes that while physical properties are dispositional,\nphenomenal ones are qualitative. On that basis a zombie duplicate of\nour world would instantiate our world’s dispositional properties\nbut not its phenomenal ones. The powerful qualities view rules that\nout a priori, making it not even conceivable. For if a\nthing’s dispositions are identical with its qualities, nothing\ncan instantiate certain dispositional properties without also\ninstantiating whatever qualities are supposedly identical with them.\nCountering this line of argument, Henry Taylor (2017) claims it\ndepends on an implausible account of the distinction between the\nphysical and the phenomenal, arguing in particular that the physical\ncannot be confined to the dispositional.  \nFor other attacks on the conceivability of zombies see Balog 1999;\nCottrell 1999; Harnad 1995; Marcus 2004; Shoemaker 1999; Stoljar 2001;\nTye 2006.  \nPremise (2) of the conceivability argument is: whatever is conceivable\nis possible. Although this appears to be a defensible claim, it has\nbeen attacked from several angles.  \nA number of philosophers argue that Kripke’s ideas about a\nposteriori necessary truth facilitate the defense of physicalism. They\nurge that even if a zombie world is conceivable, that does not\nestablish that it is possible in the way that matters. Conceivability\nis an epistemic notion, they say, while possibility is a metaphysical\none: ‘It is false that if one can in principle conceive that P,\nthen it is logically possible that P; … Given psychophysical\nidentities, it is an ‘a posteriori’ fact that any physical\nduplicate of our world is exactly like ours in respect of positive\nfacts about sensory states’ (Hill and McLaughlin 1999, 446. See\nalso Hill 1997; Loar 1990/1997; 1999; McLaughlin 2005; Webster 2006).\nSome philosophers reject even the assumption that conceivability is a\nguide to possibility, challenging the view that the burden of\nproof is on those who deny the zombie possibility (Block and Stalnaker\n1999; Hill and McLaughlin 1999; Yablo 1993). \nChalmers has responded in several places (1996, 131–134; 1999,\n476–7; 2010, 141–205). His most detailed version of the\nconceivability argument (2010) uses the framework of two-dimensional\nsemantics. This enables him to distinguish two kinds of possibility\nand two corresponding kinds of conceivability. In the\n‘primary’ sense conceivability entails possibility; for\nexample it is conceivable that water should have been a substance\nchemically different from H2O. In the other, ‘secondary’\nsense, it is neither conceivable nor possible that water should have\nbeen chemically different. The difficulty for the conceivability\nargument can be expressed by saying that even if zombie worlds are\nprimarily conceivable and therefore primarily possible, it does not\nfollow that they are also secondarily possible. And a posteriori\nphysicalists will typically deny that it follows, on the ground that\nonly the secondary possibility of zombie worlds would entail the\nfalsity of physicalism. At this point Chalmers in effect presents his\nopponents with a dilemma, which is (crudely summarizing his\nconclusions) that either the primary conceivability of zombies does\nafter all entail their secondary possibility, in which case the\nconceivability argument works and materialism is false; or else what\nhe calls ‘Russellian monism’, briefly considered at\nSection 5.3 below, is true. (See also Jackson 1998; and for\ndiscussions, Brueckner 2002; Loar 1999; Hill and McLaughlin 1999;\nPerry 2001, 169–208; Piccinini 2017; Sebastián 2017; Shoemaker\n1999; Soames 2005; Yablo 1999.)  \nMany physicalists hold that both the zombie idea and Frank\nJackson’s knowledge argument can be dealt with through a proper\nunderstanding of the nature of phenomenal concepts (roughly, the\nconcepts we use when conveying the character of our experiences: for\nexample ‘sweet’, ‘the way I see blue’).\nExponents of the conceivability argument hold that the supposed\n‘explanatory gap’ between the physical and the phenomenal\n— which is expressed in the idea that zombies are conceivable\n— brings with it an ontological gap. According to the\n‘phenomenal concept strategy’ (Stoljar 2005) there is\nreally only a conceptual gap: phenomenal concepts have features which\nmislead us into supposing there is an ontological gap in addition to\nan epistemic one, when there isn’t. \nThus it is argued that even if a zombie world is indeed conceivable,\nit does not follow that there are nonphysical properties in our world.\nIf that is right, physicalists can concede the conceivability of\nzombies while insisting that the properties we pick out in terms of\nphenomenal concepts are physical. ‘Given that properties are\nconstituted by the world and not by our concepts’, Brian Loar\ncomments, ‘it is fair of the physicalist to request a\njustification of the assumption that conceptually distinct concepts\nmust express metaphysically distinct properties’ (Loar\n1999, 467; see also his 1997). He also argues that phenomenal concepts\nare ‘recognitional’, in contrast to physical concepts,\nwhich are ‘theoretical’. Phenomenal concepts, Loar says,\n‘express the very properties they pick out, as Kripke observed\nin the case of ‘pain’’ (1999, 468). He thinks these\npoints explain the conceivability of a zombie world, while maintaining\nthat there is no possible world in which the relevant physical\nproperties are distinct from consciousness. Chalmers objects that\nLoar’s account does not justify the view that physical concepts\nrefer to phenomenal properties (1999, 488). He argues further (2007)\nthat exponents of this approach face a dilemma. Let C be whichever\npsychological ‘key features’ we have but zombies lack.\nThen if it is conceivable that the purely physical facts about us\nshould have held without C, then C is not physicalistically\nexplicable. On the other hand, if that is not conceivable, then in his\nview C cannot explain our epistemic situation as contrasted with that\nof zombies. So either C is not physicalistically explicable, or it\ncannot explain our epistemic situation. (For discussions see Ball\n2009; Balog 2012; Carruthers 2005; Chalmers 1999; 2007; 2010; Crane\n2005; Loar 1990/97; Papineau 2002; Pereboom 2011; Stoljar 2000; Tye\n2008.)  \nFollowing Russell (1927), some philosophers suggest that physics tells\nus only about the ‘structural’ properties of things\n— such as their dispositions and nomic relations — rather\nthan about the ‘intrinsic’ properties which supposedly\nunderlie and account for their structural properties. Thus Daniel\nStoljar (2001) argues that there are two distinct notions of the\nphysical and correspondingly of physicalism, depending on whether one\nappeals only to what is provided for by physics or also to the\nintrinsic properties of physical objects. He suggests that even if one\nof the corresponding two versions of the conceivability argument is\nsound, the other is not — because (roughly) physicalists can\nalways object that, since we do not know enough about the physical\nworld (in particular, about its intrinsic properties), we cannot\n‘strongly’ conceive of the possibility of zombies. \nThese ideas are exploited in what Chalmers calls ‘Russellian\nmonism’ (a variety of neutral monism). In our world, he\nsuggests, the underlying intrinsic properties might be\n‘phenomenal properties, or they might be protophenomenal\nproperties: properties that collectively constitute phenomenal\nproperties when organized in the appropriate way’ (2010: p.\n151); while in some other worlds the corresponding intrinsic physical\nproperties did not provide for consciousness. If the intrinsic\nproperties which supposedly provide for our consciousness are\nnevertheless classified as physical, exponents can deny the\npossibility of zombies if these are understood to be our\n‘full’ physical duplicates. At the same time they can\nconcede the possibility of zombies which duplicate us only in their\nstructural properties. As he points out, this view is ‘a highly\ndistinctive form of physicalism that has much in common with property\ndualism and that many physicalists will want to reject’\n(Chalmers 2010, p. 152; see also Pereboom 2011). One obstacle to\ncounting it as physicalism is that it seems unable to explain why the\nspecial intrinsic properties in our world should provide for\nconsciousness, while those which perform the same functions in those\nother worlds do not: this has to be accepted as a brute fact.  \nPhilip Goff (2010) suggests that this loophole for Russellian versions\nof physicalism weakens the zombie argument. He recommends instead an\nargument from ghosts: pure subjects of experience without any physical\nnature. He argues that such ghosts are conceivable and possible, and\nthat they provide an argument against physicalism which leaves no\nloophole for Russellian monism. (Physicalists are likely to object\nthat arguments against the conceivability of zombies can also be\nmobilized against ghosts.)  \nSpecial factors. It has been suggested that there are special\nfactors at work in the psychophysical case which have a strong\ntendency to mislead us. For example it is claimed that what enables us\nto imagine or conceive of states of consciousness is a different\ncognitive faculty from what enables us to conceive of physical facts:\n‘there are significant differences between the cognitive factors\nresponsible for Cartesian intuitions [such as those about zombies] and\nthose responsible for modal intuitions of a wide variety of other\nkinds’ (Hill and McLaughlin 1999, p. 449. See also Hill 1997).\nThe suggestion is that these differences help to explain the ease with\nwhich we seem able to conceive of zombies, and the difficulty we have\nin understanding the claim that they are nevertheless impossible. \nConditional analysis. Another line of objection rests on\nconditional analyses of the concept of qualia. Roughly, the idea is\nthat if there actually are certain nonphysical properties\nwhich fit our conception of qualia, then that is what qualia are, in\nwhich case zombies are conceivable; but if there are no such\nnonphysical properties, then qualia are whichever physical properties\nperform the appropriate functions, and zombies are not conceivable. It\nis argued that this approach enables physicalists to accept that the\npossibility of zombies is conceivable, while denying that zombies are\nconceivable (Hawthorne 2002a; Braddon-Mitchell 2003. See Stalnaker\n2002 for a related point, and for criticism, Alter 2007; Chalmers\n2010, pp. 159–59; Crane 2006). \nCausal essentialism. According to the theory of causal\nessentialism, the causal properties of physical properties are\nessential to them. Brian Garrett (2009) exploits this theory to argue\nthat the zombie argument against physicalism depends on broadly Humean\nassumptions about the laws of nature and property identity which\npresuppose the falsity of causal essentialism. If we reject those\nassumptions and accept that some physical properties have essentially\nthe capacity to produce consciousness, then ‘we cannot accept\nthe genuine possibility of zombie worlds’ even if such worlds\nare conceivable (see also Aranyosi 2010). \nMore on zombies’ utterances. Consider a zombie world\nthat is an exact physical duplicate of our world and contains zombie\ntwins of all philosophers, including some who appeal to the\nconceivability argument. Katalin Balog (1999) argues that while their\nutterances would be meaningful, their sentences would not always mean\nwhat they do in our mouths. She further argues — to oversimplify\n— that if the conceivability argument were sound in actual\nphilosophers’ mouths, then it would be sound in the mouths of\nzombie philosophers too. But since by hypothesis physicalism is true\nin their world, their argument is not sound. Therefore the\nconceivability argument used by actual philosophers is not sound\neither. If this argument works, it has the piquant feature that\n‘the zombies that antiphysicalists think possible in the end\nundermine the arguments that allege to establish their\npossibility’ (502. Chalmers offers brief replies in his 2003;\n2010, pp. 159–60). \nThe anti-zombie argument for physicalism. The conceivability\nargument — which assumes physicalism entails that zombies are\nimpossible — purports to refute it by showing they are possible.\nAs we saw, the simplest version of this argument goes: (1) zombies are\nconceivable; (2) whatever is conceivable is possible; (3) therefore\nzombies are possible. However, ‘anti-zombies’ —\nduplicates of ourselves made conscious by the purely physical facts\n(Frankish 2007) — also seem conceivable. So we have a parallel\nargument: (1*) anti-zombies are conceivable; (2) whatever is\nconceivable is possible; (3*) therefore anti-zombies are possible. But\n(3) and (3*) cannot both be true, since if the purely physical facts\nabout anti-zombies make them conscious, then the exactly similar\nphysical facts about zombies make them conscious too, and they are not\nzombies after all (Frankish 2007; Marton 1998; Piccinini 2017;\nSturgeon 2000, pp. 114–116). One moral is that we should reject\nthe inference from conceivability to possibility. (Brown 2010 argues\nthat if anti-zombies are conceivable, then zombies are inconceivable.)\nThe most promising reply for exponents of the conceivability argument\nseems to be to deny that anti-zombies are conceivable (Chalmers 2010,\n180). \nIf zombies are genuinely possible, then not only is physicalism\nproblematic, so are some widely held views on other topics. Here are\nthree notable examples. \nDescartes accepted the common assumption that not only do physical\nevents have mental effects, but mental events have physical effects\n(for example, thinking about the political situation makes me write a\nletter). The difficulty for his dualism, it was thought, was to\nunderstand how the nonphysical could have effects on the physical. But\nif zombies are possible — requiring the physical world to be\ncausally closed — there is no work for nonphysical qualia to do.\nIn that case the difficulty is to understand how, in spite of\nappearances, the nonphysical could fail to have effects on\nthe physical. Still supposing zombies are possible, it then becomes\nhard to see any alternative to parallelism or epiphenomenalism, with\nthe radical revision of common assumptions about mental causation that\nthose views entail. True, the friends of zombies do not seem compelled\nto be epiphenomenalists or parallelists about the actual\nworld. They may be interactionists, holding that our world is not\nphysically closed, and that as a matter of actual fact, nonphysical\nproperties do have physical effects. Or they may favor\n‘panprotopsychism’, according to which what is\nmetaphysically fundamental is not physical properties, but phenomenal\nor ‘protophenomenal’ ones (Chalmers 1991, 297—299;\n1999, 492) — a view arguably compatible with the causal closure\nof the physical. But neither of those options is easy. Abandoning\ncausal closure conflicts with empirical evidence; while the idea that\nphenomenal or quasi-phenomenal properties are fundamental is\nobscure. \nThe apparent possibility of zombies also seems to pose a problem for\nevolutionary theory. Why did creatures with qualia survive rather than\nthose creatures’ zombie counterparts? If zombies could have\nsurvived, what’s the use of consciousness? Owen Flanagan and\nThomas Polger have used the apparent possibility of zombies to support\nthe claim that ‘There are as yet no credible stories about why\nsubjects of experience emerged, why they might have won — or\nshould have been expected to win — an evolutionary battle\nagainst very intelligent zombie-like information-sensitive\norganisms’ (1995, 321): a problem not faced by those who reject\nthe possibility of zombies. One response on behalf of those who do\naccept it is to suggest that there might be fundamental laws linking\nthe phenomenal to the physical. Such laws would not depend on whether\nconscious creatures ever happened to evolve, in which case, arguably,\nevolution poses no special problem (Chalmers 1996, 171). \nIf qualia have no physical effects, then nothing will enable anyone to\nestablish for certain that anyone else actually has qualia.\nPhilosophers who believe they have a solid response to skepticism\nabout other minds may therefore conclude that this consequence of the\nzombie idea is enough to condemn it. Others, however, may regard the\nskeptical consequence as ‘a confirmation’, on the ground\nthat we really are ignorant of others’ minds (Campbell 1970,\n120). Of course not all responses to other minds skepticism imply that\nzombies are inconceivable. \nThe intuitive appeal of the zombie idea can be overwhelming. But that\nwas true once of the idea that the earth stands still, and is true now\nof the idea that science can explain events without appealing to\nanything nonphysical. Some anti-physicalists believe their\nopponents’ commitment makes them turn a blind eye to the\ndifficulties: \nOn the other hand, some physicalists believe the zombie idea exerts an\nirrational grip on anti-physicalist thinking, so that \nIn spite of the fact that the arguments on both sides have become\nincreasingly sophisticated — or perhaps because of it —\nthey have not become more persuasive. The pull in each direction\nremains strong.","contact.mail":"Robert.Kirk@nottingham.ac.uk","contact.domain":"nottingham.ac.uk"}]
