For this reason he spoke of absolute space and\nabsolute time, so as to distinguish these entities from the\nvarious ways by which we measure them (which he called relative\nspaces and relative times). From antiquity into the\neighteenth century, contrary views which denied that space and time\nare real entities maintained that the world is necessarily a material\nplenum. Concerning space, they held that the idea of empty space is a\nconceptual impossibility. Space is nothing but an abstraction we use\nto compare different arrangements of the bodies constituting the\nplenum. Concerning time, they insisted, there can be no lapse of time\nwithout change occurring somewhere. Time is merely a measure of \ncycles of change within the world.  \n\n\n Associated with these issues about the ontological status of space\nand time was the question of the nature of true motion. Newton defined\nthe true motion of a body to be its motion through absolute\nspace. Those who, before or shortly after Newton, rejected the reality\nof space, did not necessarily deny that there is a fact of the matter\nas to the state of true motion of any given body. They thought rather\nthat the concept of true motion could be analyzed in terms of the\nspecifics of the relative motions or the causes thereof. The\ndifficulty (or, as Newton alleged, the impossibility) of so doing\nconstituted for Newton a strong argument for the existence of absolute\nspace.  \n\n\n In recent literature, Newton's theses regarding the ontology of space\nand time have come to be called substantivalism in contrast\nto relationism. It should be emphasized, though, that Newton\ndid not regard space and time as genuine substances (as are,\nparadigmatically, bodies and minds), but rather as real entities with\ntheir own manner of existence as necessitated by God's existence (more\nspecifically, his omnipresence and eternality).  \n\n\n Today, Newton is best known as a physicist whose greatest single\ncontribution was the formulation of classical mechanics and\ngravitational theory as set out in his Philosophae Naturalis\nPrincipia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural\nPhilosophy), first published in 1687, and now usually referred to\nsimply as “Newton's Principia”. Newton's views on\nspace, time, and motion not only provided the kinematical basis for\nthis monumental work and thus for the whole of classical physics up\nuntil the early twentieth century, but also played an integral role in\nNewton's general system of philosophy and theology (largely developed\nprior to the Principia). Because Newton never drafted a\ntreatise on, or even a digest of, this general system, his stature as\none of the great philosophers of the seventeenth century, indeed, of\nall time, is no longer widely appreciated.   \n A “Scholium” at the beginning of the Principia,\ninserted between the “Definitions” and the “Laws of\nMotion”, lays out Newton's views on time, space, place, and\nmotion. He begins by saying that, since in common life these\nquantities are conceived of in terms of their relations to sensible bodies, it is\nincumbent to distinguish between, on the one hand, the relative,\napparent, common conception of them, and, on the other, the absolute,\ntrue, mathematical quantities themselves. To paraphrase:  \n Newton devotes the bulk of the Scholium to arguing that the\ndistinction between the true quantities and their relative measures is\nnecessary and justified.  \n It is evident from these characterizations that, according to Newton:\n \n The first of these theses was a point of major contention in\n17th-century natural philosophy and one assailed by Newton's critics\nsuch as Leibniz, Huygens, and Berkeley. The second was not in\ngeneral dispute. Descartes, Leibniz, and Berkeley all believed that,\nto put it in somewhat scholastic terms, the predicate ‘x is\nin true motion’ is a complete predicate in the sense that it holds or\nfails to hold for any given body. (Huygens, at least in his\npost-Principia views, constitutes a special case.) Thus, for\nthose who denied the first thesis, it was necessary to secure a\ndefinition, or an analysis, of what it means for a body be in true\nmotion (and what determines the quantity of that motion), so as to be\nas adequate to the facts as Newton's characterization of true\nmotion. The figures mentioned above all deemed that motion relative to\nother bodies is a necessary condition for true motion,\nalthough not, by itself, a sufficient condition.   \n Over the course of years, the consensus in the 17th and early 18th\nCenturies on thesis (2) was lost sight of, and it became common to\ncharacterize Newton's opponents as  denying that there is a\nfact of the matter as to whether a body is in true motion and\nmaintaining instead that all motion is merely relative\nmotion. Thus, modern readers expect that Newton's Scholium on\nspace, time, and motion should be read as arguing not only thesis (1)\nabove, but also thesis (2), that all motion is not merely relative\nmotion, but that some motions are true and absolute. Newton's\narguments concerning motion, however, are designed to show, not that\ntrue motion is distinct from merely relative motion (which is granted\nby all), but rather that the only feasible analysis of true motion\nrequires reference to absolute places, and thus the existence of\nabsolute space.   \n In particular it has been assumed that Newton's so-called “rotating\nbucket experiment”, together with the later example of a pair of\nglobes connected by a chord and revolving about their center of\ngravity, is supposed to argue, or provide evidence for, the existence\nof true, or absolute, motion. Not only is this false, but the two\ncases have distinct purposes in the framework of the Scholium. The\nrotating bucket experiment is the last of five arguments from the\n“properties, causes, and effects of motion” designed to show\ncumulatively that an adequate analysis of true motion must involve\nreference to absolute space. In contrast, the example of the revolving\nglobes is intended to illustrate how it is that, despite the fact that\nabsolute space is invisible to the senses, it is nonetheless possible\nto infer the quantity of absolute motion of individual bodies in\nvarious cases.   \n The most important question shaping 17th-century views on the nature\nof space, time and motion is whether or not a true void or vacuum is\npossible, i.e., a place devoid of body of any sort (including rarified\nsubstances such as air). Ancient atomism, dating back at least to the\npre-Socratic philosopher Democritus (5th century, B. C.), held that\nnot only is such possible, but in fact actually exists among the\ninterstices of the smallest, indivisible parts of matter and extends\nwithout bound infinitely. Following Plato, Aristotle rejected the\npossibility of a void, claiming that, by definition, a void is\nnothing, and what is nothing cannot exist.   \n According to Aristotle, the universe is a material plenum, finite in\nextent, bounded by the outermost sphere of the fixed stars. Beyond\nthat there is no void, i.e., empty places, since, as Aristotle defines\n‘place’, the place of something is the outermost of “the\ninnermost motionless boundary of what contains it.” Hence, since there\nare no boundaries outside the outermost celestial sphere, there are no\nplaces or space outside of it.   \n Time, according to Aristotle, is just the measure of motion, where by\n‘motion’ he means change of any sort, including\nqualitative change. In order to define the uniformity of time, that\nis, the notion of equal intervals of time, Aristotle was guided by\nastronomical practice, which in antiquity provided the most practical and accurate measures of time. He identified uniform motion with the rate of motion of\nthe fixed stars, a choice for which he found a dynamical justification\nin his celestial physics.   \n “Local” motion is but one species of motion, viz., change of\nplace. Motion, in general, he defined as the actualization of\npotentiality, a notion commonly held in the 17th century to be so\nobscure as to be either useless or meaningless. However, as far as\nlocal motion is concerned, there is no difficulty as to what\nconstitutes the true or absolute motion of a body in a finite\ngeocentric universe. Indeed, elementary substances in the sub-lunar\nrealm (earth, air, fire, and water) move of their own accord either up\nor down, i.e., toward the center or away from the center by their very\nnature. The celestial realm, beginning with the orbit of the moon,\nconsists of an interlocking network of celestial spheres composed of a\nfifth element (aether), which by its nature is disposed to circular\nmotion about the center of the of universe (i.e., the center of the\nearth). If the motion of this substance is taken to be the measure of\ntime, the celestial spheres necessarily rotate uniformly. Since the\nnet motion of an embedded sphere is the sum of its natural motion\nsuperimposed on the natural motions of the spheres in which it is\nembedded, and since the axes of rotation are in general set at\nslightly different angles in order to account for why the sun does not\nmove on the celestial equator and the planets and the moon do not move\nstrictly on the ecliptic (i.e., the path of the sun against the fixed\nstars), the motions of the moon, planets, and even the sun are not\nnecessarily uniform. However, since the sphere of the fixed stars is\nembedded in no other celestial sphere in motion, the motion of the\nfixed stars is de facto the measure of all motion.   \n The motions spoken of so far are all natural motions of the\nsubstances in questions, motions induced by the body being the very\nsubstance that it is. In contrast, other motions, in which the cause\nof the motion is external rather that internal to the body, Aristotle\nsubsumed under the concept of violent motion. Violent motion\nrequired for its continuation the constant application of an external\ncause.   \n Although Aristotle's views dominated medieval scholasticism, there\noccurred a renewed interest in atomism in the early 17th\nCentury. Apart from general factors such as the Renaissance, Humanism,\nand the Reformation, specific innovations of the 16th Century made it\nattractive. Although Copernicus' introduction of a helio-static system\nwas motivated by a strict adherence to Aristotle's dynamics of\ncelestial spheres, it brought into question his terrestial\nphysics. Galileo's telescopic observations of the surface of the moon and\nhis discovery of moons orbiting about Jupiter brought into question\nthe very distinction between the terrestial and the\ncelestial. Moreover, the visibility of an abundance of new stars,\napparently without end, suggested that the universe may in fact be\nwithout bound.   \n An important representative of the revival of atomism and its\nconcomitant views concerning the void is Walter Charleton's\nPhysiologia Epicuro-Gassendo-Charltoniana: Or a Fabrick of Science\nNatural, upon the Hypothesis of Atoms, “Founded by Epicurus, Repaired\nby Petrus Gassendus, Augmented by Walter Charleton”, which\nappeared in English in 1654, twelve years after Newton's birth. It is\na text with which Newton became familiar as an undergraduate, and some\nof the core theses concerning time and space later put forth in the\nPrincipia and various unpublished manuscripts in Newton's hand can be\nfound in Charleton.  These include:  \n Charleton's arguments for his views concerning time have much the\nsame tenor as those given by Newton in the Principia. In\nmarked contrast, though, those for empty, immense, and immutable space\nare quite different. Charleton appeals to the explanation of such\nphenomena as rarefaction and condensation, the differences in “degrees\nof Gravity” of bodies, and the numerous ways in which bodies can\ninterpenetrate at the micro-level in terms of solubility, absorption,\ncalefaction, and diverse chemical reactions. However, Charleton does\nnot introduce the terminology of “relative” time, “relative” spaces,\nor “relative” places, and nowhere raises concerns regarding true\n(absolute) motion versus merely relative motion. Oddly enough,\nalthough Charleton occasionlly mentions and criticizes Descartes with\nregard to other matters, no note of the fact is made that Descartes, a\ndecade earlier, had proposed explanations, in detail or in outline,\nfor just these sorts phenomena according to a system of nature in\nwhich the world is completely filled with matter and in which space\ndistinct from body cannot exist. Descartes, it can be justly said, is\nthe founder of the other main school of the “mechancal philosophy” of\nthe 17th Century, which stood in direct opposition to atomism on the\nissue of the possibility of a vacuum and which adapted the\nAristotelian doctrines on the nature of time, space, and motion to the\nnew world view. \n Although avowedly anti-Aristotelian in many regards, particularly on\nthe view, shared with atomists, that all qualitative change on the\nmacroscopic scale is reducible to the rearrangement and/or motion of\nmatter on the microscopic scale, it was Descartes' ambition to carry\nout this program by retaining what is essentially Aristotle's notion of\nPrime Matter. The pure elements (earth, air, fire, and water) of\nAristotle's physics could mutate into one another by alteration of the\nfundamental qualities definitive of them. These were the four haptic\nqualities of hot, cold, wet, and dry. Because of this, there had to be\nsomething distinguishable, at least in thought, from qualities that\npersist during elemental alteration. This quality-less substratum is\nwhat Aristotle referred to simply as matter, or as it is often called,\nPrime Matter, in order to avoid confusion with the macroscopically\nidentifiable, quality-laden, homogenous portions of everyday\nobjects. Unlike atomists, who attributed at least the quality of\nhardness (impenetrability) to the ultimate particles of matter,\nDescartes argued that matter, or synonymously, body [corpus] has no\nqualities whatsoever, but only quantity, i.e., extension. In other\nwords, body and extension are literally one and the same [res\nextensa]. An immediate corollary is that there can be no vacuum, for\nthat would require an extended region devoid of body --- a manifest\ncontradiction. The task, then, was to show how all apparent qualities\ncan be explained in terms of the infinite divisibility and\nrearrangement of extension with respect to itself. The task was grand\nindeed, for its goal was to develop a unified celestial and\nterrestrial physics that could account equally for the ductility of\nmetals, magnetic attraction, the tides, the mechanism of gravity, the\nmotion of the planets, the appearance and disappearance of comets, and\nthe birth and death of stars (supernovae).   \n Descartes published his system of the world in 1644 as the\nPrinciples of Philosophy (Principia\nPhilosophae). Part II of the Principles lays out the\nthesis of the identity of space (extension) and matter, develops a\ndefinition of motion in the “true, or philosophical sense”, and sets\nout the fundamental dynamical laws of his system. Motion, according to\n“the truth of the matter”, is defined to be “the translation of one\npart of matter, or one body, from the vicinity of those bodies, which\nare immediately contiguous to it and are viewed as if at rest, to the\nvicinity of others.” In consequence, Descartes points out, each body\nhas a single motion proper to it (in contrast to the numerous relative\nmotions that can be ascribed to it depending on which other bodies are\nselected in order to determine its place). It is this single proper\nmotion that figures in his laws of motion. Of particular importance\nfor Descartes' entire system, is that a body in circular motion has an\nendeavor [conatus] to recede from the center of rotation.   \n This fact, together with Descartes' contention that a body also\nparticipates in the motion of a body of which it is a part, makes it\ndifficult to reconcile Descartes' system of the world with his\ndefinition of proper motion. Newton concluded that the doctrine is in\nfact self-refuting and that, where Descartes needed to, he had\nsurreptitiously helped himself to a notion of space independent of\nbody, particularly in order to assign the desired degree of\ncentrifugal conatus to the planets and their satellites as\nthey are swept about by celestial vortices of “subtle” matter.   \n The untitled and unfinished manuscript which begins “De Gravitatione\net aequipondio fluidorum et solidorum …”, written perhaps a decade\nor more before the Principia, consists for the most part of\nan extensive and scathing critique of Descartes' doctrine of\nmotion. The document, published for the first time in (Hall and Hall,\n1962), is well worth the study for a glimpse at the development of\nNewton's thinking at a relatively young age. It manifestly embraces\nthe doctrines of space and time later codified in the\nPrincipia. Notable, as well, is that each of the five\narguments from the properties, causes and effects of motion advanced\nin the Scholium has a clearly identifiable antecedent in  De\nGravitatione. (See Rynasiewicz 1995 for details.) This makes it\nclear the extent to which the Scholium is concerned to argue\nspecifically against the Cartesian system (as pointed out by Stein\n1967), which Newton perceived to be the only other viable contender at\nthe time.   \n The Scholium has a clearly discernible structure. Four paragraphs\nmarked by Roman numerals I–IV follow the opening paragraph, giving\nNewton's characterizations of time, space, place and motion,\nrespectively, as summarized in the third paragraph of Section 1\nabove. If we were to extend Newton's enumeration to the remaining\nparagraphs, then paragraphs V–XII constitute a sustained defense of\nthe distinctions as characterized in I–IV. Paragraph XIII then\nstates the general conclusion that the relative quantities are\ngenuinely distinct from the respective absolute quantities and makes\ncomments on the semantic issue of the meanings of these terms in the\nBible. There follows one remaining, and quite extensive paragraph\n[XIV], which takes up the question how in practice one can ascertain\nthe true motions of bodies and concludes: “But how we are to obtain\nthe true motions from their causes, effects and apparent differences,\nand vice-versa, will be explained at length in the treatise that\nfollows. For that is the end to which I composed it.”   \n In what follows, links have been inserted to the text of the Scholium\naccording to the extended enumeration suggested above. Clicking on a\nlink will open a new window in such a way that the reader can navigate\nback and forth between a given paragraph of the text and the\ncommentary elucidating that paragraph. \n Paragraph\n V\nappeals to the fact that astronomy distinguishes between absolute and\nrelative time in its use of the so-called equation of time. This\nserves to correct for inequalities in the commonly adopted standard of\ntime, the solar day, which most people mistakenly believe\nto be uniform. The solar day, defined as the period of time it takes\nthe sun to return to zenith, varies by as much as 20 minutes over the\ncourse of a year. The standard of correction in the equation of time\nused in Ptolemaic astronomy was based upon the assumption that the\nsidereal day—the period of time it takes a fixed star to return\nto zenith—is constant, because the celestial sphere on which\nthe fixed stars are located should not be assumed to speed up and slow\ndown. With the demise of the Ptolemaic system and Aristotelian\ncosmology, this rationale was no longer compelling, and at least some\nastronomers, most notably Kepler, called into doubt whether the rate of\nrotation of the earth remained constant over the course of the\nyear. (Kepler considered that its rotation would be faster when closer\nto the sun due to an excitatory effect of the sun.) Thus, the issue of\nthe correct measure of time occupied considerable attention in 17th\nCentury astronomy, especially because the ability to measure the rate\nof rotation of the earth is equivalent to the problem of determining\nlongitude, which, for sea-faring nations, was critical for navigation\n(and hence military and economic dominance). Huygens' pendulum clock\nprovided the first terrestrial candidate for a decently accurate\nmeasure of uniform time. Newton mentions this, as well as the eclipses\nof the moons of Jupiter, an alternative method based on Kepler's\nperiod law.   \n The invocation of the need for an equation of time in astronomy is\nnot just an appeal to a well entrenched scientific practice. In the\ncourse of his discussion, Newton explains why he thinks the need is\njustified. Although he will argue in Book\nIII of the Principia that the diurnal rotation of the earth\nis  uniform, this is a contingent fact. It could have been otherwise.\nIndeed, it could have been that there are\nno uniform motions to serve as accurate measures of\ntime. The reason is that all motion is subject to being accelerated or\nretarded (by the application of external forces). In contrast,\nabsolute time (which is nothing other than duration or the\nperseverance of the existence of things) remains the same, whether the\nmotions be be swift, slow, or null.   \n Paragraph\n VI\n defends\nthe thesis of the immobility of (absolute) space, which against the\nbackdrop of Descartes, clearly means that the parts of space, just as\nthe parts of time, do not change their relation with respect to one\nanother. Newton argues that the parts of space are their own places,\nand for a place to be moved out of itself is absurd. A more expansive\nantecedent of this argument occurs in De Gravitatione,\napplied specifically to time: if yesterday and tomorrow were to\ninterchange their temporal relations with respect to the remainder of\ntime, then yesterday would become today, and today yesterday. Thus,\nNewton held an interestingly holistic identity criterion for the parts\nof space and time.   \n Newton devotes five full paragraphs to justifying his\ncharacterization of the distinction between absolute and relative\nmotion. The first three present arguments from properties of absolute\nmotion and rest, the next presents an argument from their causes, and\nthe final an argument from their effects. The force of these has\nconfused modern commentators for a combination of reasons which,\nhistorically, are difficult to untangle. Since only those not already\nprejudiced by those commentaries, directly or indirectly, will find\nwhat follows unusual, it is best to defer an autopsy of those reasons\nuntil Section 6, after an exposition of the arguments.\n \n Suffice it to say for the moment that it is a common misunderstanding\nthat in these arguments Newton intends to develop empirical\ncriteria for distinguishing cases of absolute motion from merely\napparent motion and  thereby to disprove the thesis that all motion is \nmerely relative motion. To the contrary,\nthe arguments take as their point of departure the assumption, common\nto Cartesian and Aristotelian philosophy, that each body has a unique\nstate of true motion (or rest). Throughout the arguments, the terms\n‘true motion’ and ‘absolute motion’ are\ntreated synonymously. At issue is whether true motion (and rest) can\nbe reduced to some special instance of relative motion (or rest) with\nrespect to other bodies. In announcing at the outset of these\narguments that “absolute and relative rest and motion are\ndistinguished by by their properties, causes, and effects”, Newton\nindicates his intent to show that they cannot, at least if true motion\nand rest are to have those features we generally associate, or ought\nto associate, with them.   \n Property: Bodies that are truly at rest are at rest\n with respect to one another.\n \n Conclusion: True rest cannot be defined simply in\n terms of position relative to other bodies in the local\n vicinity.\n \n Reasoning: Suppose there were a body somewhere in\nthe universe absolutely at rest, say far away, in the region of the\nfixed stars, or even farther. (Whether or not that body might ever be\nobserved doesn't enter into what follows.) Clearly it is impossible to\nknow just from considering the positions of bodies in our region\nrelative to one another whether any of these latter bodies maintains a\nfixed position with respect to that hypothetical distant body. To\namplify, let B be one of the local bodies, C the relative\nconfiguration over time of the set of local bodies, and A the far\ndistant body at absolute rest. The specification of C alone fails to\nestablish the position of B relative to A over time. In particular, C\nfails to establish whether B is relatively at rest with respect A,\nwhich, by the property stated above, is a necessary condition for B to\nbe absolutely at rest. Hence, specification of the local configuration\nC underdetermines whether or not B is at absolute rest. Thus the\nconclusion: it is impossible to define what it is for a body such as B\nto be at absolute rest [i.e., to give necessary and sufficient\nconditions for when it is that B is at rest] simply in terms of how B\nfits into the local configuration C.   \n Property: If a part of a body maintains a fixed\nposition with respect to the body as a whole, then it participates in\nthe motion of the whole body.   \n Conclusion: True and absolute motion cannot be\ndefined as a translation from the vicinity of (the immediately\nsurrounding) bodies, viewing the latter as if they were at rest.   \n Reasoning: Newton first introduces two\nconsiderations that can be taken either to support, or to illustrate,\nor to amplify upon the import of the stated property. The first is\nthat if a part of a rotating body is at rest relative to the body as a\nwhole, it endeavors to recede from the axis of rotation. The second is\nthat the impetus of a body to move forward arises from the combination\nof the impetus of its parts.   \n From the property it follows that if those bodies surrounding a given\nbody move (either rotationally or progressively forward as a fixed\nconfiguration) while the surrounded body is at rest relative to the\nsurrounding ones, then the surrounded body partakes in the (true)\nmotion of the group of surrounding bodies. Hence, if the surrounding\nbodies move truly, then so does the surrounded body. But according to\nthe (Cartesian) definition of motion—which identifies the true\nmotion of a body with its transference from the vicinity of\nimmediately surrounding bodies, regarding the surrounding bodies to be\nas though they are at rest—it would have to be said (wrongly)\nthat the surrounded body is truly at rest. Hence that definition is\nuntenable.   \n Property: Anything put in a moving place moves along\nwith that place, and hence a body participates in the motion of its\nplace when it moves [relatively] away from that place.   \n Conclusion: The complete and absolute motion of a\nbody cannot be defined except by means of stationary places.   \n Reasoning: From the property, the [relative] motion\nof a body out of a given place is only part of the motion of the body\nif the place in question is itself in motion. The complete and true\nmotion of the body consists of its motion relative to the moving place\nadded vectorially to whatever motion the place may have. Should the\nplace be moving relative to a place which is in turn moving, then the\nmotion of that place must be added, and so on. Barring infinite\nregress, the sum must terminate with a motion relative to a stationary\nplace.   \n Addended Argument: After deriving this conclusion,\nNewton amplifies upon the consequences. The only places that are\nstationary are all of those that that stay in fixed positions with\nrespect to one another from infinity to infinity, and since these\nalways remain stationary, they make up what Newton calls immobile\nabsolute space.   \n Causes: the forces impressed upon bodies. The major\npremise is that application of a [non-zero net] force on a body is\nboth a necessary and sufficient condition for either generating or\naltering its true motion. More specifically:  \n (A) Impressed force is a necessary condition for generating or\naltering true motion (but not, as remains to be shown, merely relative\nmotion).   \n (B) Application of a [non-zero net] force is a sufficient condition\nfor the generation or alteration of true motion (but not, as will be\nshown subsequently, merely relative motion).   \n Conclusion: The true motion of an individual body\ncannot be defined as any particular sub-instance of its motion\nrelative to other bodies.   \n Reasoning: Newton seeks to establish that\napplication of a positive net force to a body is neither a necessary\nnot a sufficient condition for the generation of motion relative to\nother bodies. The two lines of reasoning are given separately, call\nthem ‘Prong A’ and ‘Prong B’, respectively.\n \n Prong A: To be established is that, although an impressed\nforce is necessary for the generation or alteration of true motion in\na body, it is not necessary for the generation of motion relative to\nother bodies. The reasoning is quite simple: pick a given body and\nmerely apply the same [accelerative] force to all other bodies in\nquestion. These other bodies will then remain in the same relative\nconfiguration with respect to one another, but a relative motion with\nrespect to the original body [to which no force has been applied] will\neither be generated or altered.   \n Prong B: To be established is that, although an impressed\nforce is sufficient for the generation or alteration of true motion in\na body, it is not sufficient for the generation of motion relative to\nother bodies. Again, the line of reasoning is quite\nstraightforward. Consider an arbitrarily given body amongst a system\nof bodies and simply apply the same [accelerative] force to all bodies\nin question. Then, despite the fact that a force has been impressed\nupon the originally given body, there is neither generation nor\nalteration of relative motion with respect to the remaining bodies.\n \n Effects: the forces of receding from the axis of\nrotational motion [centrifugal endeavor]. The major premise is that\nthe centrifugal endeavor of bodies [or parts of bodies] to recede from\nthe axis of rotation is directly proportional to the quantity of the\ntrue circular motion.   \n Conclusion: True rotational motion cannot be defined\nas relative rotation with respect to the surrounding bodies.   \n Reasoning: The line of reasoning is in fact parallel\nto the preceding argument from causes, although this may not be\ncompletely perspicuous due to the fact that the correlates of the two\nprongs above are here stages of a single on-going experimental\nsituation, the so-called “rotating bucket” experiment, which, Newton\nintimates, he actually performed. In order to set up this experiment,\none suspends a bucket using a long cord and by turning the bucket\nrepeatedly, winds up the cord until it is strongly twisted, then fills\nthe bucket with water. During the course of the experiment, the degree\nto which the water tries to climb up the sides of the bucket is used\nas a measure of its centrifugal endeavor to recede from the\ncenter. Newton uses the experiment to establish that centrifugal\nendeavor is neither a necessary condition nor a sufficient condition\nfor the existence of relative circular motion [of the water] with\nrespect to its surroundings [the bucket].   \n Stage 1: When the bucket is first released, it rotates\nrapidly with respect to the rest frame of the experimenter while the\nwater remains at rest with respect to the experimenter. In other\nwords, there is rapid relative motion of the water with respect to the\nbucket. However, the surface of the water remains flat, indicating\nthat it has no tendency to recede from the axis of relative\nrotation. Thus, the existence of centrifugal endeavor in the parts of\na body is not a necessary condition for the body to be rotating\nrelative to its surroundings. That is, such relative rotation with\nrespect to immediately adjacent bodies need not produce any\ncentrifugal endeavor in the parts of the body to recede from the axis\nof relative rotation.   \n In the further course of the experiment, as the bucket continues to\nrotate, the water gradually begins to rotate with it, and as it does\nso, begins to climb up the sides of the bucket. Eventually, according\nto Newton, the water acquires the same rotation of the bucket relative\nto the lab frame, at which point we have the following situation.\n \n Stage 2: The water and the bucket are at relative rest, yet\nthe water has achieved its highest ascent up the sides of the bucket,\nindicating a maximum centrifugal endeavor to recede from the axis of\ncommon rotation. Hence, the existence of centrifugal endeavor is not a\nsufficient condition for the presence of relative circular motion\nbetween a body and its surroundings, i.e., if a body, or rather its\nparts, have a centrifugal endeavor to recede from a central axis, it\ndoes not follow that there is a relative circular motion of the body\nwith respect to its immediate surroundings.   \n Astrophysical Application. After deriving the\nconclusion, Newton uses the premises of the first two arguments from\nproperties, together with the premise of the argument from effects, to\ncritique the vortex theory of planetary motion. According to that\ntheory, each of the planets (and most notably the earth) is relatively\nat rest with respect to the “subtle” matter of the celestial vortex of\nour own sun. Hence, according to Descartes' own definition of true\nmotion (as well as his explicit insistence), they have no true\nmotion. However, it is manifest that they do not maintain fixed\npositions with respect to one another. So, according to the property\ninvoked in the first argument, they cannot [all] be truly at\nrest. Moreover, from the property invoked in the second argument, they\npartake in the circular motion of the solar vortex [assuming that\nmotion to be true motion, as Descartes implicitly assumed]. Finally,\nbecause they would accordingly participate in the true circular motion\nof this hypothetical vortex, they should have an endeavor to recede\nfrom the axis of its rotation.   \n This completes the sequence of arguments from the properties, causes,\nand effects of motion. The next paragraph\n  [XIII]\n states the cumulative conclusions of the arguments marshalled\nbeginning with the arguments for absolute time in paragraph V: “Hence\nrelative quantities are not the quantities themselves, whose names\nthey bear, but are only sensible measures of them (either accurate or\ninaccurate), which are commonly used in place of the quantities they\nmeasure.” Having made his case, Newton comments on the ordinary\nlanguage meaning of the terms for these quantities\nin order to address contemporary issues of dogma\nand heresy.   \n Galileo's condemnation by the Catholic Church for asserting that the\nearth is in motion was still recent history at the time Newton\ncomposed the Principia. Descartes, who lived in reach of\nPapal authority and feared similar fate, had found a clever way of\nespousing Copernicanism without falling prey to accusation of\nheresy. According to his definition of motion “properly speaking”, he\ncontends, the earth is truly at rest.   \n In Newton's system of the world as set out in Book III of the\nPrincipia, the earth patently moves absolutely. In\nanticipation, Newton indicates how to reconcile this with scripture by\nobserving that, if usage determines the meanings of words, then in\nordinary discourse (including the Bible) the terms ‘time’,\n‘space’, ‘place’, and ‘motion‘ are\nproperly understood to signify the relative quantities; only in\nspecialized and mathematical contexts do they denote the absolute\nquantities. (Keep in mind Newton's title, The\nMathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy.)\nHe proceeds to chastise Descartes on two counts, first for doing\nviolence to the scriptures by taking them to refer to the absolute\nquantities, and second, for confusing the true quantities with their\nrelative measures.   \n Having argued his case that true motion consists in motion with\nrespect to absolute space, and thus having dealt to his satisfaction\nwith the metaphysics of motion, Newton turns in the final\nparagraph of the Scholium to epistemological strategies\navailable on his account. On an Aristotelian or Cartesian account, one\ncan directly observe the allegedly absolute motion of a body if both\nit and its immediate surroundings are visible. In contrast, because\nthe parts of absolute space are not directly accessible to the senses,\nit is very difficult, Newton confesses,  to ascertain the true motion of\nindividual bodies and to discriminate them in practice from the\napparent motions. “Nevertheless,” he remarks in a rare moment of wit,\n“the situation is not entirely desperate.” Evidence is available in\npart from apparent motions, which are the differences of true motions,\nand in part from the forces, which are the causes and effects of true\nmotions.   \n Newton illustrates with an example. Imagine a pair of globes,\nconnected by a cord, revolving about their common center of\ngravity. The endeavor of the globes to recede from the axis of motion\nis revealed by the tension in the cord, from which the quantity of\ncircular motion can be estimated. Furthermore, whether the direction of\ntheir revolution is clockwise or counterclockwise can be detected by\napplying forces to opposite faces of the globes to see whether the\ntension in the cord increases or decreases. All this can be done in\nempty space where no other bodies are present to serve as points of\nreference.   \n Suppose now that, in addition to the globes, there is second system\nof bodies maintaining fixed positions with respect to one another (for\nexample, the fixed stars). If the two systems are in a state of\nrelative rotation, one cannot gauge from just the relative rotation,\nwhich, if either, is at rest. However, from the tension in the cord\nconnecting globes, one can establish whether the relative rotation is\ndue entirely to the absolute rotation of the system of\nglobes. Supposing so, the second system of bodies can then be\nexploited to provide an alternative technique for determining whether\nthe globes revolve in a clockwise or counterclockwise \ndirection—one simply consults the direction of rotation relative to \nthe stationary system.   \n At this point Newton cuts off the Scholium, explaining that the whole\npoint of having written the treatise to follow is to show how to infer\nthe true motions from their causes, effects, and apparent differences,\nand conversely the causes and effects from either the true or the\napparent motions.   \n As remarked in Section 5.3 above, the purpose of the arguments from\nproperties, causes, and effects has been widely misunderstood in both\nthe historical and philosophical literature, and as a consequence, so\ntoo the relation of these to the example of the revolving globes in\nthe final paragraph. Some diagnosis as to why may help those readers\nalready steeped in tradition to overcome certain prejudices they bring\nto the Scholium and may also serve to further illuminate the framework\nin which Newton and his contemporaries struggle with the problem of\nmotion.   \n (1) Newton's stated intention in the Scholium is to maintain that\nabsolute space, time, and motion are genuinely distinct from their\nrelative counterparts. For the case of space, this clearly amounts to\narguing the existence of an entity distinct from body in which bodies\nare located—something denied by relationists. Similarly, for\nthe case of time, this involves arguing the existence of an entity\ndistinct from the succession of particular events in which the events\nare located—again, something denied by relationists. It may\nseem then as a matter of course that, for the case of motion, Newton\nshould argue for existence of something denied by relationists,\npresumably, absolute motion. \n (2) It would amount to a virtual petitio principii were\nNewton to rest a case for absolute motion on the existence of absolute\nspace. Hence, one would expect him to appeal to various physical\nphenomena that might provide independent warrant. Now it is well known\nthat Newton's laws satisfy the principle of Galilean relativity,\naccording to which there can be no experimental test to determine\nwhether a system is at rest or in a state of uniform rectilinear\nmotion. However, Newton's laws do support a distinction\nbetween inertial and non-inertial motion in that they predict, in\nnon-inertial frames, the appearance of so-called “fictitious forces,”\nfor instance, centrifugal forces in rotating frames, resulting in a\ntendency for bodies to recede from the axis of rotation. Since this is\nexactly the effect involved in the rotating bucket experiment, it is\ntempting to interpret Newton as marshaling it as a case in which this\nphenomenon suggests independent warrant for the existence of absolute\nmotion.   \n (3) Moreover, since the same effect is operative in the example of\nthe revolving globes, it is hard to see why that example does not\nserve the very same purpose. In fact, in his famous critique of Newton\nin the Science of Mechanics, Ernst Mach, in quoting from the\nPrincipia, cut out all of the intervening text to make it\nappear as though the two are but variant examples in the development\nof a single argument.   \n (4) Finally, the choice of language in Motte's 1729 translation,\nwhich is the basis for the most widely available twentieth century\nEnglish translation by Cajori, tends to reinforce the presumption that\nthe arguments from properties, causes, and effects seek to identify\nphenomena that empirically distinguish absolute from (merely)\napparent motion. In the Cajori version, the conclusions of the first\nthree arguments, the arguments from the properties of motion and rest,\nread: \n Thus, it is tempting to assume that both the argument from causes and\nthe argument from effects are likewise concerned to identify an\nempirical signature of absolute motion by which it can be\ndistinguished from (merely) apparent motion. (Reading the arguments in\nthis fashion, only the argument from effects, which deals with the\ncentrifugal effects of circular motion, appears to help Newton's \ncause—a commonly registered complaint.)   \n It will be more illuminating to respond to these in reverse order.\n \n (Ad 4) It is an artifact of Motte's translation that the Latin verb\ndefiniri (passive infinitive) is rendered occasionally as\n‘be determined’ rather than as ‘be\ndefined’. According to seventeenth-century English usage, either\nchoice is acceptable. In appropriate contexts, the two function as\nsynonyms, as in the Euclidean axiom, “Two points determine a line.”\nMotte's practice conforms with this. The conclusion of the argument\nfrom effects, ‘definiri’ is translated as ‘be\ndefined’: \n If one now goes back and substitutes ‘be defined’ for\n‘be determined’ into the conclusions from the arguments\nfrom properties quoted above, they take on, to the modern ear, a\ndifferent meaning. They make claims as to what constitutes an adequate\ndefinition of the concepts of true, or absolute, motion and rest.\n \n (Ad 3) We have already seen how\n paragraph XIII\n signals the conclusion,\nnot just of the arguments from properties, causes, and effects, but\nthe direct arguments for absolute time and absolute space as well,\nwhich, altogether, Newton takes establish the ontological distinction\nbetween the absolute and the relative quantities. That the next\nparagraph, in which the globes are introduced, concerns a different,\nepistemological issue would be apparent were it not for another\nartifact of the Motte translation, this time involving the Latin verb\n‘distinguere’. Newton uses the word again and again,\nalmost thematically, in characterizing and arguing for the ontological\ndistinction between the absolute and the relative quantities; and\nMotte renders it in English as ‘to\ndistinguish’. Unfortunately, the English verb appears in the\nMotte translation one more time at the start of the final paragraph: \n But in the Latin, the word ‘distinguere’ is nowhere to be\nfound. Rather, the sentence reads: \n Thus, to the Latin reader, it is clear that Newton is moving on to a\ndifferent consideration.   \n (Ad 2) What has been said in connection with (4) suffices against the\nfalse expectations developed in (2). However, there may remain some\nsense that, even on a proper reading, Newton tried to bluff his way\npast the principle of Galilean relativity. Newton indeed acknowledges\nthe principle, though not by name, in Corollary V to the laws of\nmotion: \n And there is no reason to think that he did not appreciate the\nlimitation it poses for experimentally differentiating between\nabsolute rest and uniform motion in a straight line. A particular\ninstance of Corollary V is the solar system as a whole. Assuming the\nabsence of external forces, it follows (from Corollary IV to the laws)\nthat the center of gravity of the solar system is either at rest or\nmoves uniformly in a straight line. But which? Because of Corollary V,\nwhen Newton wishes to attribute a definite state of motion to the\ncenter of mass of the solar system in Book III, he must introduce the\n hypothesis that “The center of the system of the world is at\nrest.” Should this not be some source of embarrassment?   \n Apparently not. Immediately following the hypothesis, he writes: \n According to Newton, the attribution of a state of absolute rest to\none or the other of these bodies is universally taken for\ngranted. What does confound all conventional wisdom in what follows is\nthat neither the earth nor the sun is at rest, but rather the\ncenter of gravity of the solar system.   \n (Ad 1) Although arguing that absolute space and absolute time are\ndistinct from any relative spaces and relative times involves, in each\ncase, arguing for the existence of an additional entity, it does not\nfollow that, in arguing that absolute motion is distinct from relative\nmotion, Newton is obliged to argue yet another existence\nclaim. Unfortunately, the term ‘absolute motion’ is prone\nto be read in two distinct ways. On one reading, it means, as a matter\nof stipulative definition, ‘change of absolute place’. In\nthis sense of ‘absolute motion’, the existence of absolute\nmotion (or more precisely, the possibility of the existence of\nabsolute motion) follows immediately from the existence of absolute\nspace and absolute time.  As indicated before, nothing further needs\nto be said.  On the other reading, ‘absolute motion’ is\nsynonymous with ‘true motion’. And as we have just seen,\nNewton finds no reason to doubt that his audience does not grant that\na body is either truly at rest or truly in motion. The venerable\ntradition that takes motion and rest to be contraries has yet to be\nquestioned. So it is not incumbent on Newton make a case for the\nreality of absolute motion in the sense of true motion. What is\nincumbent is for him to argue that true motion just is change of\nabsolute place.  And that is the purpose of the arguments from\nproperties, causes, and effects.   \n Newton's views on space, time, and motion dominated physics from the\n17th Century until the advent of the theory of relativity in the 20th\nCentury. Nonetheless, these views have been subjected to frequent\ncriticism, beginning with contemporaries, such as Leibniz and\nBerkeley, and continuing on to the close of the 19th Century, most\nnotably with Ernst Mach, whose writings influenced Einstein. In the\nearly twentieth century, Newton tended to be cast as a metaphysical\ndogmatist by the early philosophical interpreters of relativity, in\nparticular Hans Reichenbach.  Unfortunately, that stigma has tended to\nlinger.   \n More recent scholarship reveals a more sober picture of why Newton\nfelt fully justified in positing absolute space, absolute time, and\nabsolute motion. Moreover, the novel feature of special relativity,\nthe rejection of absolute simultaneity—something that never\noccurred to any of Newton's earlier critics—necessitated only\nthat absolute space and absolute time be replaced with an absolute\nspace-time (Minkowski spacetime). And although Einstein's development\nof general relativity was in large part motivated by a desire to\nimplement a general principle of relativity, to wit that all motion is\nrelative motion, that it succeeds in doing so was questioned shortly\nafter the theory was introduced. As for the question of the\nabsoluteness of space-time in general relativity, it no longer has the\ncharacter of something which acts without being acted upon, as\nEinstein himself pointed out. The space-time metric tensor\nnot only encodes for spatiotemporal structure, but also represents the\ngravitational potentials, and thus gravitational energy.  By Einstein's\nfamous equation for the equivalence of energy and mass,\nit follows that the gravitational field possesses mass.  \nOnly, since gravitational energy can not be localized in terms of\nan energy density tensor, but is possessed by the field holistically,\nneither can this mass be localized.  Thus, philosophical\ncontroversy as to whether space-time can exist without matter becomes\ntendentious according whether one counts the gravitation field as\nsomething material or not.   \n Thus, the question whether the revolution in our views about space\nand time in the last century vindicates Newton's critics as more\nphilosophically astute becomes a misplaced one. The distinction\nbetween what counts as matter in contrast to empty space presupposed\nin the earlier debates has been eclipsed by possibilities undreamt of\nbefore the introduction of modern field\n theory and relativity.[1]","contact.mail":"ryno@lorentz.phl.jhu.edu","contact.domain":"lorentz.phl.jhu.edu"}]
