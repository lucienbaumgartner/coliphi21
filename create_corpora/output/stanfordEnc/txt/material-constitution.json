We might say that the lump\nconstitutes the statue, but what is this relation of\nmaterial constitution? Some insist that constitution is\nidentity, on the grounds that distinct material objects cannot\noccupy the same place at the same time. Others argue that\nconstitution is not identity, since the statue and the lump\ndiffer in important respects. Still others take cases like this to\nmotivate revisionary views about the nature of persistence, parthood,\nmodality, identity, or existence.\n\n\nThis article presents some of the most important puzzles of material\nconstitution and evaluates some of the most popular responses.\n\nPuzzles of material constitution played an important role in the\ndevelopment of philosophy and continue to be a source of much debate\ntoday. Here, we introduce four of the most famous puzzles. \nThe Debtor’s Paradox. The ancient playwright Epicharmus\ntells the tale of a poor but resourceful debtor. When approached for\npayment, the man responds with a riddle. If you add a pebble to a\ncollection of pebbles, you no longer have the same number. If you add\na length to a cubit, you no longer have the same measure. In the same\nway, if you add a bit of matter to a portion of matter you no longer\nhave the same entity. Since man is nothing more than a material object\nwhose matter is constantly changing, we do not survive from one moment\nto the next. The debtor concludes that he is not the same person who\nincurred the debt, so he cannot be held responsible for payment. The\nexasperated creditor then strikes the debtor, who protests the abusive\ntreatment. The creditor expresses sympathy, but points out that he\ncannot be held accountable for the assault. After all, material change\nhas already taken place so, by the debtor’s own line of\nreasoning, the guilty party is no longer present. The scene is\nintended to be comedic, but the argument is no laughing matter. The\nman who incurred the debt was constituted by one portion of matter,\nM1. The man who is approached for payment is constituted by\na distinct portion of matter, M2 (let us assume, for the\nsake of argument, that M2 consists of M1,\ntogether with some new matter). If constitution is identity, the\ndebtor’s reasoning is sound: the man who is approached for\npayment is not the man who incurred the debt. More generally, this\nversion of the argument would show that it is impossible for human\npersons to survive the addition of any new parts.  \nThe Puzzle of Dion and Theon. The Stoic philosopher\nChrysippus invites us to consider the case of Dion and Theon, where\nDion is a normal human being and Theon is a large part of Dion\nconsisting of everything but Dion’s right foot. Suppose now that\nthe right foot is removed. Theon obviously survives the operation, for\nhis parts remain completely unchanged. But in that case it seems as if\nDion does not survive the operation, for otherwise we would\nhave two people in the same place at the same time. Hence, Dion does\nnot survive the loss of his foot. More generally, the argument would\nshow that human persons cannot survive the loss of any constituent\nparts. (A modern variation on the ancient puzzle, due to Peter Geach\n1962 by way of David Wiggins 1967, concerns Tibbles and Tib, where\nTibbles is a cat and Tib a cat-part consisting of everything but\nTibbles’s tail.) \nThe Ship of Theseus Puzzle. The ancient historian Plutarch\nrecounts the story of the famous ship of Theseus, which was displayed\nin Athens for many centuries. Over time, the ship’s planks wore\ndown and were gradually replaced. In the ancient world, the ship\nbecame “a standing example among the philosophers, for the\nlogical question as to things that grow; one side holding that the\nship remained the same, and the other contending it was not the\nsame” (Clough 1859, p. 21). In the modern era, the case took on\nadded interest, owing to a twist from Thomas Hobbes. Suppose that a\ncustodian collects the original planks as they are removed from the\nship and later puts them back together in the original arrangement. In\nthis version of the story, we are left with two seafaring vessels, one\non display in Athens and one in the possession of the custodian. But\nwhere is the famous Ship of Theseus? Some will say that the ship is\nwith the museum, since ships can survive the complete replacement of\nparts, provided that the change is sufficiently gradual. Others will\nsay that the ship is with the custodian, since ships can survive being\ndisassembled and reassembled. Both answers seems right, but this leads\nto the surprising conclusion that, at the end of the story, the ship\nof Theseus is in two places at once. More generally, the argument\nsuggests that it is possible for one material object to exist in two\nplaces at the same time. We get an equally implausible result by\nworking backwards: There are clearly two ships at the end of the\nstory. Each of those ships was also around at the beginning of the\nstory, for the reasons just given. So, at the beginning of the story,\nthere were actually two ships of Theseus occupying the same place at\nthe same time, one of which would go on to the museum and one of which\nwould enter into the care of the custodian. \nThe Puzzle of the Statue and the Clay. Various ancient\nphilosophers, including Aristotle, pointed out that statues seem to\ndiffer in important respects from the portions of matter from which\nthey are made. To illustrate: Suppose that, on Monday, a sculptor\npurchases an unformed lump of clay, which he names ‘Lump’.\nSuppose further that, on Tuesday, the artist sculpts the clay into the\nform of the biblical king David and names his statue\n‘David’. It is tempting to say that, in this case, there\nis only one object in the sculptor’s hands—David just\nis Lump. But, on reflection, this identification is problematic,\nsince Lump and David seem to differ in various respects. First, Lump\nand David differ in their temporal properties: Lump existed\non Monday, while David did not. Second, they differ in their\npersistence conditions (i.e., the conditions under which they\nwould and would not continue to exist): Lump could survive being\nsquashed, David could not. Third, they differ in kind: Lump\nis a mere lump of clay, while David is a statue. More generally, we\ncan say that Lump and David differ in their non-categorical\nproperties, where these include all of the various ways that a\nthing was, will, would, could, or\nmust be. (Fine 2003 argues that Lump and David also differ in\ntheir aesthetic properties, among other things.) But if Lump\nand David differ in even one respect, they are not the same\nthing, for Leibniz’s Law tells that, for any x\nand y, if x = y, then x and\ny have all the same properties. Thus, it seems as if the\nsculptor holds not one, but two, material objects in his hands: a\nstatue and a lump of clay. More generally, it is possible for\ntwo material objects to exist in the same place at the same time.  \nThe four puzzles differ in details, but present a common problem. (A\nfifth puzzle about material constitution—the problem of the\nmany—raises significantly different issues and is dealt\nwith in a separate entry. See the entry on the\n problem of the many.)\n We will focus on the case of the statue and the clay, and we will\nformulate the argument as follows:  \nThe premises are plausible, but the conclusion seems absurd, for it\nimplies the possibility of spatially coincident objects. As\nDavid Wiggins notes, “It a truism frequently called in evidence\nand confidently relied upon in philosophy that two things cannot be in\nthe same place at the same time.” (1968, p. 90) Since the\nconclusion contradicts the truism, we are left with a paradox:\nseemingly true premises have led to a seemingly false conclusion.  \nGenerally speaking, there are five possible replies to the paradox.\nFirst, one could simply accept (4) and admit that David is not\nidentical to Lump. We consider this response in sections 2 and 3,\nwhere we discuss the constitution view of David Wiggins\n(1968) and the temporal parts theory of David Lewis (1976).\nSecond, one could deny (1) by either denying the existence of David or\nby insisting that David existed on Monday. We consider these responses\nin section 4, where we discuss the eliminativist views of\nPeter Unger (1979), Peter van Inwagen (1990), and Roderick Chisholm\n(1979). Third, one could deny (2) by either denying the existence of\nLump (as the eliminativist does) or by denying that Lump survives\nbeing shaped into a statue. We consider this second option in section\n5, where we discuss the dominant kinds view of Michael Burke\n(1992). Fourth, one could deny (3) by rejecting the standard\nformulation of Leibniz’s Law. We consider this response in\nsection 6, where we discuss the relative identity theory of\nPeter Geach (1967). Fifth and finally, one could respond to the\nparadox by insisting that the underlying issues are in some sense\nverbal, so that there is no fact of the matter about which premise (if\nany) is false. We consider this response in section 7, where we\ndiscuss the deflationist views of Rudolf Carnap (1950) and\nothers. \nOne final note: Our focus will be on puzzles about material\nobjects, but similar problems arise for other kinds of\nentities, including events, properties, and groups. Suppose, for\nexample, that Jackie attacks his enemy by kicking him. What is the\nrelation between the attack and the kick? We might say that the kick\nconstitutes an attack, but what is the relation of event\nconstitution? (For an introduction to the parallel debate over\nevents, see Davidson 1969, Goldman 1970, and Pfeifer 1989. For the\ndebate over property constitution, see Shoemaker 2003. For the debate\nover group constitution, see Uzquiano 2004a.)  \nThe most popular reply to the paradox of material constitution is to\nembrace the conclusion: Lump and Statue exist at the same place at the\nsame time, but differ in their non-categorical properties, so it is\npossible for there to be two material objects in the same place at the\nsame time. This view is sometimes referred to as the constitution\nview since it holds that the statue is constituted by, but not\nidentical to, the lump of clay from which it is formed. In a slogan:\nconstitution is not identity. (Johnston 1992, Baker 1997)\nConstitution is distinguished from identity insofar as it is an\nasymmetric relation: Lump constitutes Statue, but not\nvice versa. Constitution is also taken to be a\ndependence relation: As David Wiggins puts it, the statue\n“consists in” and is “nothing over and above”\nthe lump of clay (1968, p. 91; for more on the nature of constitution,\nsee Wasserman 2004). \nThe constitution view is extremely popular, having been defended, in\nsome form or other, by Baker (1997, 2000, 2002, 2007), Chappell\n(1990), Doepke (1982, 1996), Fine (2003), Forbes (1987), Johnston\n(1992), Koslicki (2004), Kripke (1971), Levey (1997), Lowe (1983,\n1995), Oderberg (1996), Pollock (1974, pp. 157–174), Salmon\n(1981, pp. 224–9), Shoemaker (1999, 2003), Shorter (1977),\nSimons (1985, 1987, pp. 210–252), Thomson (1983, 1998), and\nYablo (1987). Indeed, the view is so common that it has been labeled\n“the standard account” (Burke 1992). Why not join the\ncrowd? \n“Just try to walk through a wall,” quips the skeptic.\n“Two things can’t be in the same place at the same\ntime!” We will call this the impenetrability objection,\nsince it appeals to the common idea that impenetrability is the mark\nof the material. \nThe constitution theorist has a ready reply to the obvious objection:\nunlike you and the wall, David and Lump share the same matter\nand the same parts and it is in virtue of these facts that\nthose two objects are able to occupy the same place at the same time\n(Wiggins 1968). In short: spatial coincidence (the sharing of place)\nis explained by material coincidence (the sharing parts). Material\ncoincidence also helps to answer another common complaint: suppose\nthat Lump weighs 10lbs; David will then weigh 10lbs. as well. So why\ndon’t you get a reading of 20lbs. when you place both on the\nscale? “Why don’t the two together weigh twice as\nmuch?” (Lewis 1986, p. 252) Answer: because the two objects\nshare the same weight as a result of sharing the same\nparts. (Zimmerman 1995, p. 89, fn. 57. As Zimmerman notes, we do\nnot calculate the weight of something by summing the weights of all\nits parts—weigh the bricks and the molecules of a wall\nand you will get the wrong result, since you will have weighed some\nparts more than once. According to the constitution theorist, weighing\nDavid and Lump involves the same kind of\ndouble-counting.) \nMaterial coincidence may explain how spatial coincidence is possible,\nbut what about material coincidence itself? On the face of it, the\nclaim that different things can be made up out of the same parts at\nthe same time is no more plausible than the claim that different\nthings can be located in the same place at the same time. We will call\nthis the extensionality objection, since it appeals to the\ncommon idea that wholes are individuated by their parts in the same\nway that sets are individuated by their members. More formally, the\nprinciple is this: \nNote three things about this principle. First, ‘P’ stands\nfor the generic parthood relation, which is to be distinguished from\nthe relations of improper parthood (x is an improper\npart of y if and only if x =y) and\nproper parthood (x is a proper part of y if\nand only if x is a part of y and x ≠\ny). Second, the extensionality principle is formulated in\nterms of a two-place parthood relation. Constitution theorists,\nhowever, typically employ a three-place relation that holds\nbetween parts, wholes, and times. So, for example, it is said\nthat my baby teeth are a part of me at one time, but not\nat another (for more on the relation between the constitution\nview and temporally-relativized mereology, see Thomson 1983 and\nThomson 1998). Having noted this point, I will now leave temporal\nqualifiers implicit. Third, and most importantly, note that\nextensionality is a theorem in standard systems of mereology,\nthe logic of parts and wholes (see the entry on\n mereology).\n The problem, of course, is that the extensionality principle is\ninconsistent with the constitution view if we assume that coinciding\nobjects occupy the same place at the same time by having all of the\nsame parts at those times. If David and Lump share all of the same\nparts, for example, extensionality tells us that David is\nLump. \nOne obvious response to this objection is to deny extensionality\n(Thompson 1983). But this move comes at a cost, since extensionality\nfollows from the standard assumption that the parthood relation is\nboth reflexive and antisymmetric:  \nAntisymmetry:\n∀x∀y[(Pxy & Pyx)\n→ x = y]  \nReflexivity tells us that everything is part of itself, so if\nx and y share all of the same parts, then each must\nbe a part of the other. Antisymmetry then implies that x is\nidentical to y. (The extensionality objection is sometimes\nframed in terms of a different Extensionality principle according to\nwhich objects are identical if and only if they share all of the same\nproper parts. This principle does not follow from Reflexivity\nand Antisymmetry, but it is a theorem of standard systems of\nmereology—see the entry on\n mereology\n for more details.) \nA second response is to say that coinciding objects share all of their\nmaterial parts, but that they differ in some\nnon-material aspect (Rea 1998, Paul 2002, McDaniel 2001). The\nmost familiar version of this view traces back to Aristote and the\nidea that material objects are compounds of matter and\nform. If one accepts this view, then one could say that David\nand Lump differ in their parts since only David has the form\nStatue as a non-material part. (For a recent defense of an\nAristotle-inspired view, see Koslicki 2008. For more details on\nAristotle’s own views, see the entry on\n Aristotle’s metaphysics.) \nAccording to the constitution view, David and Lump share the same\nmatter. As a result, those objects share many of the same properties.\nBoth have the same weight, the same shape, and the same coloring.\nGeneralizing, we can say that those two objects share all of the same\ncategorical properties. Of course, David and Lump also differ\nwith respect to their non-categorical properties (where these\ninclude temporal properties, persistence conditions, and kind\nproperties). So we should ask: What could account for these\ndifferences? How can two things that are exactly alike in so many ways\nstill differ in these other respects? We will call this the\ngrounding objection since it appeals to the common idea that\nnon-categorical properties are grounded in categorical properties.\n(For alternative statements of the objection, see Burke 1992, Heller\n1990, pp. 30–2, Oderberg 1996, p. 158, Simons 1987, pp.\n225–6, and Zimmerman 1995, pp. 87–8. Note: The grounding\nobjection is sometimes framed in terms of supervenience, but this is a\nmistake for supervenience and grounding are importantly different\nrelations. For more on this issue, see Zimmerman 1995, Olson 2001, and\nBennett 2004. See the entry on\n metaphysical grounding\n and Section 5.5 of the entry on\n supervenience.) \nOne response to the grounding objection attempts to ground the\nnon-categorical features of coinciding objects in relational\nfacts about those objects. For example, Lynne Rudder Baker suggests\nthat David is a statue, rather than a mere lump of\nclay, because it is essentially related to an artworld—it\nis the sort of thing that is admired, reviewed, and discussed. Lump\ndoes not receive this sort of attention and for this reason it differs\nin kind. (Baker 2000, pp. 35–46) The problem with this\nexplanation is that it seems to get things exactly backwards, for it\nis natural to say that David is admired, reviewed, and discussed by\nthose in the art community because it is a statue (rather\nthan a mere lump of clay). A second, related, response attempts to\nground the non-categorical features of coinciding objects in\nhistorical facts. For example, one might point out that Lump\nwas created by a claymaker whose intent was to create some clay, while\nDavid was created by a sculptor whose intent was to create a statue.\nOne can then claim that the relevant difference in kind membership is\ndetermined, at least in part, by these historical facts. Consider an\nanalogy. A counterfeit dollar bill may be qualitatively identical to a\ngenuine dollar bill, but those two objects would still differ in kind\nsince only one would be an actual dollar bill. Presumably,\nthis difference in kind is explained by historical facts about how\nthose bills came into being. According to the constitution theorist,\nthe same kind of explanation applies in the case of the statue and the\nclay. The general problem with this line of response is that it cannot\nbe extended to every case of constitution. Consider, for example, Alan\nGibbard’s (1975) famous example of Lumpl and Goliath.\nAn artist sculpts a statue of the biblical giant Goliath in two\npieces—bottom and top halves—and then brings the two\npieces together. In so doing, he creates a new statue (which he names\n‘Goliath’) and a new piece of clay (which he names\n‘Lumpl’). After a brief tour of the local art galleries,\nthe statue is then smashed to bits, simultaneously destroying both\nGoliath and Lumpl. The crucial feature of this case is that Lumpl and\nGoliath share all of their historical properties and appear\nto stand in the same relations to everything else around\nthem. For example, both are created at the same time, by the same\nperson, with a single set of intentions. Both are put on display in\nthe same galleries and gazed upon by the same patrons. Both are\ndestroyed at the same time, in exactly the same way. In short, Lumpl\nand Goliath seem to share all of their categorical\nproperties—including their relational properties—while\nstill differing with respect to their modal properties and kind\nproperties. But, in that case, it seems as if there is nothing to\nground these non-categorical differences. (For a potential reply to\nthis and other worries, see Sutton 2012.)  \nAt this point we have reviewed the three most common objections to the\nconstitution view: the impenetrability objection, the extensionality\nobjection, and the grounding objection. A fourth and final concern is\nwhat we might call the anthropic objection. (Sider 2001, pp.\n156–8 refers to this as the “arbitrariness worry”.\nFor a classic statement of the problem, see Sosa 1987. For a more\nrecent statement, see section 2.5 of the entry on\n ordinary objects.)\n Thus far, we have focused on the question of whether two material\nobjects—like David and Lump—could exist at the same place\nand time. But why stop at two? Consider the mereological\nsum of material simples that is made up out of all the simples\nthat currently compose David and Lump. Those simples existed long\nbefore David or Lump came into existence, so the sum is distinct from\nthe other two objects. So now it seems as if we have three objects in\nthe same place at the same time: a lump, a statue, and a sum. But why\nstop at three? Consider the instatue that coincides\nwith David whenever that statue is indoors and then goes out of\nexistence whenever David is taken outside. (This example is inspired\nby Eli Hirsch’s 1982, p. 32 example of incars and\noutcars.) Now it looks as if we have four objects in the same\nplace at the same time: a lump, a statue, a sum, and an instatue. But\nwhy stop at four? There is also the tablestatue (that exists\nwhen and only when the statue is on a table), the litstatue (that\nexists when and only when the statue is in the light), the\ndinnerstatue (that exists when only when the statue’s sculptor\nis eating dinner), and so on. Ernest Sosa (1987) refers to this\nmultiplication of entities as “the explosion of reality”.\n \nDefenders of the constitution view may run from the explosion and\ninsist that there are only two (or three or four) objects in the same\nplace at the same time. But what justifies this exclusionary attitude?\nGranted, we humans do not normally concern ourselves with\ninstatues, litstatues, and the rest. Ordinary English does not even\nhave sortal terms for discussing these entities. But these\nare facts about our interests and linguistic decisions. Why\nshould we think that there is a correspondence between the sortal\nterms in our language and the kinds of objects in the\nworld? One way to explain this correspondence would be to claim that\nreality is determined, in some sense, by our conceptual scheme. But\nthe constitution view is typically offered as an alternative\nto anti-realist doctrines of this kind. Perhaps, then, the\nconstitution theorist should accept Sosa’s explosion and say\nthat our inattentiveness does not exclude instatues, litstatues and\nall the rest from the realm of being? Perhaps all of those objects\nexist at the same place at the same time, sharing the same parts and\nthe same matter? Perhaps. But accepting this explosion brings us very\nclose to endorsing a second view on material constitution. It is to\nthis view that we now turn. \nConsider the case of Interstate 5. I-5 runs through Washington,\nOregon, and California, but the road is not wholly present in any of\nthose states. Rather, I-5 exists in different states by having\ndifferent road segments in each—there is the Washington segment\nof I-5, the Oregon segment of I-5, and the California segment of I-5.\nAccording to the temporal parts theorist (or\nfour-dimensionalist), persistence through time is exactly\nlike that (see Quine 1953a, Lewis 1976, and Sider 2001). Just\nas roads exist at different places by having distinct spatial parts at\nthose places, material objects exist at different times by having\ndistinct temporal parts at those times. In the case of David\nLewis, for example, there is the 1970s segment, the 1980s segment, and\nthe 1990s segment. More formally, we can say that x is a\ntemporal part of y at (or during) t if and only if\n(i) x is a part of y at (or during) t, (ii)\nx overlaps everything that is a part of y at (or\nduring) t, and (iii) x exists only at (or during)\nt. (Sider 2001, p. 60) Informally, we can say that a temporal\npart of something just consists of all and only that object’s\nparts at some time (or during some temporal interval). If you want to\nknow what a temporal part looks like, just look in the\nmirror—what you see is your current temporal part. (Of course,\nyou can also see yourself in the mirror by seeing your\ncurrent temporal part, just as you can see a road by seeing one of its\nsegments.)  \nConsider now the case of U.S. Route 29, which runs from the western\nsuburbs of Baltimore, Maryland, to Pensacola, Florida. As U.S. 29\npasses through Charlotte it becomes Tyson St.—a street wholly\nlocated within the state of North Carolina. The two roadways in this\ncase are not identical, but they are partly identical, for\nTyson St. is identical to a proper spatial part of U.S. 29. According\nto the temporal parts theorist, the case of the statue and the clay is\njust like that. Lump exists for some period of time and then\n“turns into” David. If the sculptor is unsatisfied with\nher work and squashes the statue, then Lump—but not\nDavid—continues to exist, in which case David is nothing more\nthan a proper temporal part of Lump.  \nThere are, of course, various arguments for and against the doctrine\nof temporal parts. (For a summary, see the entry on\n temporal parts.)\n Here, we focus on the relevance of the doctrine to the puzzles of\nmaterial constitution and, in particular, to the challenges facing the\nconstitution view. \nThe impenetrability objection. The first problem for the\nconstitution view was that it allowed for two material objects to\nexist in the same place at the same time. The temporal parts theorist\navoids this objection for he will say that, whenever Lump and David\nexist, there is a single object that exactly occupies the relevant\nlocation—a temporal part that is shared by both David and Lump.\nOf course, the friend of temporal parts will admit that there is a\nsense in which two material objects can exist in the same place\nat the same time, since two persisting objects that share a common\ntemporal will be partly present at the same location. But\nthis is no more problematic than two roads being partly present at the\nsame place by virtue of sharing a common road segment.  \nThe extensionality objection. The second problem for the\nconstitution view was that it allowed for two objects to be composed\nof all the same parts. The temporal parts theorist avoids this problem\nin the case of the statue and the lump, since he will say that those\nobjects share some, but not all, of the same temporal parts. Of\ncourse, he will also admit that there is a sense in which two\nobjects can have all of the same parts, since two objects that share a\ncommon temporal part will have all the same parts at that\ntime. But this is no more problematic than two roads that share a\ncommon road segment and, thus, have all of the same parts at that\nplace. \nThe grounding objection. The third challenge for the\nconstitution theorist was to identify a ground for the non-categorical\nfeatures of coinciding objects. The same challenge can be put to the\nfriend of temporal parts. In the case of the statue and the lump of\nclay, for example, we have two objects that share all of the same\ncategorical properties whenever they both exist—in virtue of\nwhat, then, do they differ with respect to their temporal properties,\nkind properties, and so on? The temporal parts theorist could follow\nthe constitution theorist in claiming that the relevant objects differ\nin kind, for example, in virtue of their historical properties or he\ncould simply insist that the difference in kind is grounded in the\nfact that the two objects have different temporal parts. (See\nWasserman 2002 for more on temporal parts and the grounding\nproblem.) \nThe anthropic objection. The last worry for the constitution\nview was that it postulated an unexplained correspondence between the\nsortal terms in our language and the kinds of objects in the world.\nThe temporal parts theorist avoids this worry as well. On the standard\nfour-dimensionalist picture, persisting objects are ultimately\ncomposed of instantaneous temporal parts and, for any\ncollection of these parts, there is a further object that they\ncompose. Thus, there is a material object corresponding to every\nfilled region of spacetime. (Quine 1960, p. 171) For example, there is\nan object composed of all and only the temporal parts of David\nwhen that statue is indoors. This would be what we earlier\ncalled an “instatue”. There is also an object composed of\nall and only the temporal parts of David when that statue is in\nthe light. This is what we earlier called a\n“litstatue”. In this way, the temporal parts theorist\nfinds a place for all of the objects introduced earlier, and thereby\navoids an implausible correlation between the sortal terms of our\nlanguage and the kinds of objects in the world. (Of course, he avoids\nthis objection by accepting Sosa’s explosion, which many take to\nbe an even more objectionable result—see, for example, Markosian\n1998, p. 228.) \nThe temporal parts theorist thus avoids all of the objections facing\nthe constitution view, at least when we restrict our attention to the\noriginal puzzle of Lump and David. Unfortunately, matters are not so\nsimple in Gibbard’s case of Lumpl and Goliath. Those objects\nexist at all of the same times and thus share all of the same temporal\nparts. The four-dimensionalist who accepts extensionality will thus be\nforced to conclude that Lumpl is identical to Goliath. But, in that\ncase, he faces the following kind of argument: \n(1) appears true, since Goliath could not survive being rolled up into\na ball, for example. But Lumpl could survive that change in\nshape, so (2) appears true as well. Finally, (3) appears to follow\nfrom Leibniz’s Law. Goliath has the property of being\nessentially statue-shaped and Lumpl does not, so Goliath is not\nidentical to Lumpl.  \nThe most popular reply to this objection is due to David Lewis (1971,\n1986), who defends a counterpart theory of de re\nmodal ascriptions (like (1) and (2) above). According to this view,\nordinary individuals like Goliath and Lumpl are\nworldbound—they exist in only one possible\nworld—but have counterparts at many other possible\nworlds. These counterparts serve as the truth-makers for de\nre modal ascriptions. Roughly, we say that something is\nessentially F just in case all of its counterparts are F and\nwe say that something is contingently F just in case one or\nmore of its counterparts are not-F. The counterpart relation is a\nrelation of similarity, rather than identity, and, as with\nall similarity talk, claims about counterparts will be vague and\nsensitive to context. The most important point in this connection is\nthat names and other referring expressions are often associated with\nkinds that determine the appropriate counterpart relation for\nassessing de re modal claims involving those terms. In\nGibbard’s case, for example, we introduced the name\n‘Goliath’ for the statue and the name\n‘Lumpl’ for the piece of clay. Thus, claims that\ninclude the name ‘Goliath’ invoke a\nstatue-counterpart relation, whereas claims that include the\nname ‘Lumpl’ invoke a piece-of-clay-counterpart\nrelation. (1), for example, attributes to Goliath the property of\nbeing such that all of its statue-counterparts are\nstatue-shaped. And (2) denies Lumpl the property of being\nsuch that all of its piece-of-clay-counterparts are\nstatue-shaped. Since the predicates in the two premises express\ndifferent properties, Leibniz’s Law has no application. (For a\ncriticism of this response, see Fara and Williamson 2005.)  \nThe simplest way of avoiding the puzzles of material constitution is\nto deny the existence of some of the objects that give rise to those\nproblems. For example, if one claims that there are no such things as\nstatues and lumps of clay, then there is no threat of having a statue\nand a lump of clay in the same place at the same time. In this\nsection, we briefly introduce three versions of this eliminativist\nview.  \nEliminativism is often associated with Peter Unger (1979), who\n(previously) defended the thesis of mereological nihilism.\nNihilism is the view that there are there are no composite objects\n(i.e., objects with proper parts); there are only mereological simples\n(i.e., objects with no proper parts). The nihilist thus denies the\nexistence of statues, ships, humans, and all other macroscopic\nmaterial objects. On this view, there are only atoms in the void.\nSince the nihilist denies the existence of statues in general, he will\ndeny the existence of the particular statue, David. Hence, he will\nreject the very first premise of the original argument for coincident\nobjects. He will also reject the second premise of that argument,\nsince he will deny the existence of the relevant lump. (Terminological\nnote: Unger called himself a ‘nihilist’, but his use of\nthe term differed slightly from current usage—see van Inwagen\n1990, p. 73.)  \nThe nihilist makes two main claims, one negative and one positive.\nBoth claims can be challenged. Let us begin with the negative thesis\nthat there are no composite objects and no statues in particular. The\nmost common reaction to this claim is an incredulous stare. For many,\nthe existence of composite objects is a Moorean fact, more certain\nthan any premise that could be used to argue against it. The nihilist\nmay reply by pointing out that there is a sense in which\nstatues do exist. In our original case, for example, the nihilist will\nsay that, strictly speaking, there is no statue, but there\nare some simples arranged statuewise. Those simples jointly\noccupy a statue-shaped region of space, jointly resemble the biblical\nking David, and jointly sit on some simples arranged tablewise. So,\nloosely speaking, we can say that there is a statue of David\non the table. Similarly for all talk of statues, ships, and other\ncomposite objects—wherever commonsense says that there is a\ncomposite object belonging to the kind K, the nihilist will\nsay that there are some simples arranged K-wise and so,\nloosely speaking, a K. (For more details on this paraphrasing\nstrategy, see van Inwagen 1990, chapter 10. For worries, see\nO’Leary-Hawthorne and Michael 1996, Uzquiano 2004b, and McGrath\n2005.) This brings us to the nihilist’s positive thesis that\nthere are material simples. This claim can also be challenged (see\nSider 1993, Zimmerman 1996, and Schaffer 2003). It was once thought\nthat chemical atoms were fundamental particles, until the discovery of\nprotons and neutrons. And it was thought that protons and neutrons\nwere mereological simples, until the discovery of quarks. One might\nthink it is possible for this process goes on without limit, in which\ncase our world would be gunky (i.e., it would have no simples\nas proper parts). The problem is that this possibility is inconsistent\nwith nihilism, which seems to imply that a material world must contain\nmaterial simples.  \nA second version of eliminativism is associated with Peter van Inwagen\n(1990), who defends the following thesis about composition: There is\nsome y such that the xs compose y if and\nonly if the activity of the xs constitute a life. According\nto this thesis, the only composite objects are living organisms.\nBeyond that, there are only material simples. So, for example, van\nInwagen recognizes the existence of apple trees, but not apples. Van\nInwagen’s view is closely related to nihilism, but has one\nnotable advantage—it allows for the existence of human persons.\nFor example, in the case of Dion and Theon, van Inwagen will say that\nDion exists at the beginning of the story, since the activity of the\nrelevant simples constitutes a life (the life of Dion). But van\nInwagen will deny that Theon exists, for the activity of the relevant\nsimples only constitutes a part of Dion’s life at that\ntime. (Of course, the activity of those same simples constitutes a\nlife after Dion’s right foot is removed, at which point the\nsimples come to compose Dion.) More generally, van Inwagen denies the\nexistence of what he calls “arbitrary undetached parts”:\n \nLet m = Dion, t = a pre-operation time,\nr1 = the region occupied by Dion at t,\nand r2 = the region corresponding to all of Dion\nexcept for his right foot at t. If DAUP were correct, Theon\nwould exist, for it would just be the proper part of Dion that\noccupies r2 at t. Van Inwagen denies the\nexistence of Theon, so he denies DAUP as well. (For more on DAUP and\nits role in puzzles of material constitution, see van Inwagen 1981,\nOlson 1996, and Parsons 2004.)  \nVan Inwagen’s version of eliminativism is subject to the same\nobjections raised against nihilism, but it also faces problems of its\nown. Here is one worry. There are borderline cases where it is vague\nwhether or not the activity of some simples constitutes a life\n(consider, for example, the question of when, exactly, a person comes\ninto existence or passes away). But, if it is vague whether the\nactivity of some simples constitutes a life then, according to van\nInwagen, it is vague how many objects exist. But it cannot be vague\nhow many objects exist, since cardinality claims can be made in a part\nof language where nothing is vague. Suppose, for example, that there\nare exactly one-million simples and suppose it is vague whether or not\nthe activity of those simples constitutes a life. Now consider the\nnumerical sentence that asserts the existence of (at least)\none-million and one objects. (A numerical sentence is a\nfirst-order sentence asserting the existence of some objects. For\nexample, the numerical sentence that there exist at least two objects\nis: ∃x∃y(x ≠ y).)\nIf van Inwagen is correct, it is indeterminate whether or not the\nrelevant numerical sentence is true, in which case one of the\nconstituent expressions—‘∃’,\n‘x’, ‘y’, ‘~’,\n‘=’—must be vague. Yet many philosophers have\nclaimed that the terms of first-order logic do not admit of borderline\ncases. (For a more detailed presentation of this argument, see Lewis\n1986, pp. 212–213, Sider 2001, pp. 120–132, and section\n2.2 of the entry on\n ordinary objects.\n For potential replies, see Hirsch 2002b, Liebesman and Eklund 2007,\nand van Inwagen 1990, Chapter 13.)  \nA third version of eliminativism is often associated with Roderick\nChisholm (1973), who defends the doctrine of mereological\nessentialism: For any x and y, if x is\na part of y then, necessarily, y exists only if\nx is a part of y. This doctrine is an\n“eliminativist” view insofar as it denies the existence of\nmereologically ductile objects. For example, in the Ship of Theseus\ncase it is natural to think that there is a ship which survives the\nreplacement of at least some of its parts. The essentialist’s\nresponse to the paradox is to deny this apparent truism. In the same\nway, the Debtor’s Paradox and the Puzzle of Deon and Theon only\narise on the assumption that human persons can gain and lose parts.\nThe essentialist solves these puzzles by rejecting this assumption.\nThe Puzzle of the Statue and the Clay remains problematic, however,\nfor that example involved a change in shape, rather than a change in\nparts. In order to respond to this puzzle, the essentialist must\nendorse an additional principle: For any xs and for any\ny, if the xs compose y then, necessarily,\nthe xs exist only if they compose y. This thesis\nsays that the whole is essential to the parts, so that whenever you\nhave the same parts, you have the same whole. We will refer to the\ncombination of this principle and the doctrine of mereological\nessentialism as the thesis of mereological constancy. The\ndefender of this thesis will say that, in our earlier case, Lump\nexists on both Monday and Tuesday, for the same clay parts are there\non both days. The same is true of David. The parts that compose David\non Tuesday are present on Monday, in which case the first premise of\nthe earlier argument is false—David did exist on\nMonday. In that case, the defender of mereological constancy is free\nto identify David and Lump and thereby avoid commitment to coincident\nobjects.  \nViewed from one perspective, the doctrine of mereological constancy\ncan seem somewhat intuitive. When one rearranges the dining room\nfurniture, one does not bring new furniture into existence—one\nsimply brings existing furniture into a new arrangement. In the same\nway, rearranging the material contents of the universe does not bring\nnew material objects into existence—it simply puts existing\nobjects into new arrangements. Thus, when the artist sculpts the lump\nof clay she gives that object a new form, but does not create a new\nobject. Viewed from another perspective, however, mereological\nconstancy seems completely absurd, for it implies that if we\nannihilate a single subatomic particle from David, the entire statue\nwill be destroyed. (More frightening still, if we annihilate a single\nparticle from your body, you will no longer exist.) The mereological\nessentialist may reply that, if we were to annihilate a particle from\nDavid, there would still be a statue left in its place—call it\nDavid*. David* would not be identical to David, but it would\nbe very similar to David. For example, it would have roughly the same\nmass, the same shape, and the same location. In one sense, then, we\ncould say that the earlier statue is the same as the latter\nstatue. So we could say that, loosely speaking, David\nsurvives. (In Chisholm’s terminology, David* is a\n“statue-successor” of David, and what we would normally\nthink of as the statue is nothing more than a “logical\nconstruction” out of these and other successive objects—it\nis what Chisholm calls an ens successivum.) Here is a second\nworry for the defender of mereological constancy. Imagine that the\nartist who sculpted David becomes dissatisfied with her work and\nsquashes the statue. All of David’s clay parts would survive the\nsquashing, so the thesis of mereological constancy tells us that\nDavid, the statue, survives. But this seems absurd—statues\ncannot survive being squashed. We get an equally absurd result in the\nopposite direction. David’s parts existed prior to the\nsculpting, so David itself existed prior to the sculpting. But how can\na statue exist before it is sculpted? The defender of mereological\nconstancy may reply by pointing out that that the thing which is\n(currently) a statue may have existed prior to the sculpting, but it\nwas not (then) a statue. In this sense, at least, we can say that the\nstatue did not exist prior to sculpting. Similarly, the thing which is\n(currently) a statue may survive being squashed, but it will not\n(then) be a statue. So, loosely speaking, the statue will not\nsurvive the squashing. (For more details on this paraphrasing\nstrategy, see Chisholm 1976, chapter 3.) \nIn the previous section, we examined various ways of resisting the\nfirst premise of our original argument: David did not exist on\nMonday. Let us now turn our attention to the second premise of\nthat argument: Lump did exist on Monday. Eliminativists like\nUnger and van Inwagen will reject this premise, since they deny the\nexistence of lumps like Lump. But there are other theories that lead\nto the rejection of this premise as well. One such theory is the\ndominant kind view, which is defended by Michael Burke (1994,\n1997a, 1997b).  \nBurke begins with the assumption that there is a single object present\non Tuesday. For the moment, let us simply refer to this object as\nRex. Burke assumes that Rex is both a lump of clay and a\nstatue. This is a perfectly natural assumption, but it is also\nproblematic. As we have seen, kinds like lump of clay and\nstatue are associated with different modal properties and\ndifferent persistence conditions in particular. To return to an\nearlier example, the kind lump of clay is associated with the\npersistence condition of being able to survive squashing,\nwhile the kind statue is associated with the persistence\ncondition of being unable to survive squashing. Now consider\nthe following principle: For any object o and kind\nK, if o is a K, then o has the\npersistence conditions associated with K (Burke 1994, p.\n598). If this principle is correct, we have a problem. Rex is both a\nlump of clay and a statue, so the principle tells us that it is able\nto survive squashing and that it is not. Burke concludes that the\nproposed principle is false: It is possible for an object to be a\nK without having the persistence conditions associated with\nthat kind. In particular, Burke claims that Rex is a statue and a lump\nof clay, but it only has the persistence conditions associated with\none of those kinds. Which one? Burke answers that, in general, an\nobject has the persistence conditions associated with its dominant\nkind. What is a dominant kind? Burke answers that, in general, an\nobject’s dominant kind is the kind that “entails\npossession of the widest range of properties” (1994, p. 607; for\nan alternative account of dominance, see Rea 2000). For example, if\nsomething is a lump of clay, then it must have certain physical\nproperties. If something is a statue, on the other hand, it must\nhave both physical properties and aesthetic\nproperties. In this sense, statue entails a wider range\nof properties than lump of clay. Hence, statue\ndominates lump of clay. Rex therefore has the persistence\nconditions associated with the kind statue. Rex, in other\nwords, is just David. What about Lump? In the original story, the name\n‘Lump’ is introduced for the lump of clay that exists on\nMonday. At that point there was no statue, so Lump’s dominant\nkind is simply lump of clay. Let us now introduce the name\n‘Lump*’ for the lump of clay that exists on Tuesday. The\nlump of clay that exists on Tuesday is also a statue (Lump* is David,\ni.e., Rex), so Lump*’s dominant kind is statue. Hence,\nLump ≠ Lump*. On Burke’s view, the process of sculpting a\nlump of clay into a statue destroys one object (a mere lump of clay)\nand replaces it with another (a statue). The resulting statue is also\na lump of clay, but it is numerically distinct from the lump of clay\nwith which we began. Burke concludes that Lump exists on Monday, but\ndoes not exist on Tuesday. Hence, the second premise of the original\nargument is false.  \nThe dominant kinds view has several advantages over the eliminativist\nviews discussed in the previous section. Most notably, the dominant\nkinds view recognizes the existence of ordinary objects like statues\nand lumps of clay and allows for these objects to gain and lose parts.\nHowever, some of the objections raised in previous sections apply to\nBurke’s view as well. For example, the anthropic objection from\nsection 2 can also be raised against the dominant kinds view (Sider\n2001, p. 165). In addition, the view faces problems of its own.  \nFirst, there is the objection from commonsense. According to Burke,\nsculptors can destroy lumps of clay by doing nothing more than\nreshaping them in accordance with certain artistic intentions. In\nfact, given certain theories of what constitutes an artwork, the\nsculptor doesn’t even have to do that much. Suppose that an\nartist takes a liking to a particular rock in his yard. He gives it\nthe title Rocky and invites art critics to admire his new\nwork. If this is all it takes to create a work of art, then this is\nall it takes to destroy a rock. After all, the rock at the beginning\nof the story has piece of rock as its dominant kind, while\nthe rock that exists at the end of the story has piece of art\nas its dominant kind. Hence, the latter rock is numerically distinct\nfrom the former—the original rock is no more. Yet this seems\nabsurd. We are not gods. We cannot create and destroy material objects\nwith the power of thought alone. Burke replies to this objection by\ndistinguishing various readings of ‘the rock’. (1994,\n596–7) ‘The rock’ can be understood as a singular\ndescription that denotes the rock (a single object).\n‘The rock’ can also be understood as a plural description\nthat denotes all of the little pieces of rock. Finally,\n‘the rock’ can be understood as a mass description that\ndenotes the relevant rocky stuff. On the first reading, the\nrock from the beginning of the story is not the same as the rock at\nthe end of the story. But, on the second and third readings, the rock\nfrom the beginning of the story is the same as the rock at\nthe end of the story. The artist may destroy the relevant object, but\nhe does not destroy the little pieces of rock that compose that object\nor the rocky stuff that constitutes that object. Hence, there is a\ngood sense in which “the rock” survives. Burke claims that\nthis is enough to satisfy the demands of commonsense. (For more on\nmass descriptions and the distinction between stuff and things, see\nthe entry on\n the metaphysics of mass expressions.)\n  \nA second problem concerns Burke’s account of dominance. Burke\nclaims that one kind dominates another when it entails a wider range\nof properties. This seems to get the current case correct, for there\nis a natural sense in which statue entails a wider range of\nproperties than lump of clay. But other cases are less clear.\nTake, for example, the case of a performance artist who poses his own\nbody to form a statue. The relevant object is both a human person and\na statue. The kind statue entails having certain physical and\naesthetic properties, but does not entail having any mental\nproperties. The kind human person entails having certain\nphysical and mental properties, but one could argue that it does not\nentail having any aesthetic properties. In that case, neither kind\ndominates the other, so Burke’s account fails to tell us what\nthe object is or what persistence conditions it possesses.\n(For more on these kinds of cases, see Rea 2000.)  \nA third problem for the dominant kinds view is that it cannot be\nextended to cover all cases of constitution. Take, for example, the\nShip of Theseus Puzzle. In that case, we seem to have two objects in\nthe same place at the same time, where both of the objects are\nships. Since there is a single kind at issue, the\nquestion of dominance does not arise and Burke’s account\nprovides no help. \nIn the previous two sections, we discussed various ways of challenging\nthe first two premises of the argument for coincident entities. Let us\nnow turn our attention to the third and final premise: If David\ndid not exist on Monday and Lump did exist on Monday, then David is\nnot identical to Lump. The premise follows from Leibniz’s\nLaw: for any x and y, if x is identical to\ny, then x and y share all of the same\nproperties. The denial of Leibniz’s Law therefore provides one\nway of resisting the final premise of the argument.  \nThe denial of Leibniz’s Law is sometimes associated with Peter\nGeach (1962, 1967), who defends a view called the relative\nidentity theory. Geach’s central thesis is that there is no\nrelation of absolute identity—there are only relations of\nrelative identity. In particular, identity is always relative to a\nkind. Thus, we can say that David is the same statue\nas Lump and we can say that David is the same lump of clay as\nLump, but it makes no sense to say that David is the same as Lump\nsimpliciter. The consequent of the third premise is therefore\nnonsense—saying ‘David is not identical to Lump’ is\nlike saying ‘David is not to the left of’. More generally,\nGeach rejects the standard formulation of Leibniz’s Law as\nincomplete, since it includes a non-relativized identity predicate. In\nthis way, the relative identity theorist is able to block the third\nstep of the argument for coincident objects.  \nGeach makes many interesting claims about the behavior of relative\nidentity relations. For example, he claims that it is possible for\na to be the same K as b, but not the same\nK*, where ‘K’ and\n‘K*’ are sortal terms denoting distinct kinds.\nTake the Debtor’s Paradox. In that case, we have an earlier\nportion of matter, M1, and a later portion of matter\nM2. According to Geach, M1 is not the same\nportion of matter as M2, but it is the same person. In this\nway, he is able to allow for the persistence of persons through\nchanges in parts. (For further details on Geach’s view, see the\nentry on\n relative identity.)\n  \nThe relative identity theorist may deny the standard formulation of\nLeibniz’s Law, but there is significant pressure to accept\nsome version of that principle since it seems to capture a\ncentral fact about identity. An obvious suggestion is to offer a\nrelativized version of Leibniz’s Law: For any x and\ny, if x is the same K as y, then x\nand y share all of the same properties (where ‘K’\nis a sortal denoting a kind). If Geach’s relative identity\nrelations do not conform to this law, one might worry that they are\nnot identity relations at all. And here we have a potential\nproblem. Take the case of David and Lump. As we have seen, some\nphilosophers want to say that David is both a statue and a lump of\nclay (it is not a mere lump of clay, since it is also a\nstatue, but it is still a lump of clay). Lump is obviously a lump of\nclay. Since there is only one lump of clay on Tuesday, David must be\nthe same lump of clay as Lump. But then, by the relativized version of\nLeibniz’s Law, David and Lump must share all of the same\nproperties. This, once again, seems false. Lump existed on Monday, but\nDavid did not, so there is a property that Lump has and David lacks:\nhaving existed on Monday. In response, the relative identity\ntheorist might appeal to another component of Geach’s view.\nGeach suggests that proper names are always associated with kinds. For\nexample, ‘David’ is associated with the kind\nstatue and ‘Lump’ is associated with the kind\nlump of clay. Taking a cue from the counterpart theorist\n(section 3), the relative identity theorist may go on to claim that\nthis association creates opaque contexts when we ascribe modal\nproperties. Take, for example, the following pair of statements: \nThe relative identity theorist could say that (1) is true if and only\nif there was a lump of clay on Monday which is the same lump\nof clay as Lump. (2), on the other hand, is true just in case there\nwas statue on Monday which is the same statue as David. Given\nthese truth conditions, (1) is true and (2) is false, for there was a\nlump of clay on Monday (the same lump of clay as Lump), but no statue.\nMore importantly, on this analysis the predicates in (1) and (2)\nexpress different properties, in which case the relativized version of\nLeibniz’s Law has no application. So, one cannot move from (1)\nand the negation of (2) to the conclusion that Lump and David are\ndistinct lumps of clay. \nA second worry for Geach is that it seems as if the relative identity\ntheory cannot solve all of the puzzles with which we began. Take, once\nagain, the Ship of Theseus Puzzle. In that case, we have the original\nship of Theseus (A), the museum’s ship (B), and the\ncustodian’s ship (C). The problem is that B seems to be the same\nship as A, which seems to be the same ship as C. If the same ship\nas relation is transitive, we get the absurd conclusion that B is\nthe same ship as C. The relative identity theorist might deny\ntransitivity, of course, but this would give us another reason to\nsuspect that relativized identity relations are not identity\nrelations, for transitivity seems to be a central feature of identity.\n(For more on this worry, see Gupta 1980.)  \nA third and final worry for Geach concerns his denial of absolute\nidentity. As many commentators have pointed out, this denial has\ndrastic implications for logic, semantics, and set theory. To take\njust one example, consider the set theorist’s axiom of\nextensionality: For any sets A and B, if\nA and B have the same members, then A is\nthe same set as B. Let A be David’s unit set\nand let B be Lump’s unit set. Is A the same\nset as B? The relativist must reject this question as\nill-formed. It makes no sense to ask whether x and y\nare the same members, since this requires a notion of absolute\nidentity (intuitively, ‘member’ does not denote a genuine\nkind, so ‘same member as’ does not express a relative\nidentity relation). As a result, the relative identity theorist must\ndeny extensionality, which throws set theory into jeopardy. (For a\ndetailed discussion of this and other concerns, see Hawthorne\n2004.) \nImagine a debate between two friends over whether or not boats are\nships. One party points to a rowboat and says, “That boat is a\nship. After all, a ship is a vessel that floats on water and the\nrowboat is obviously a vessel that floats on water.” The second\nparty demurs: “A ship is a sufficiently large vessel\nthat floats on water and the rowboat is not sufficiently large. So the\nboat is not a ship.” Clearly, there is something defective about\nthis debate. Note three things in this connection. First, there are\ntwo “candidate meanings” for the predicate\n‘ship’, namely a vessel that floats on water and\na sufficiently large vessel that floats on water. Second,\nneither of these candidate meanings is more “natural” than\nthe other—unlike ‘water’ or ‘electron’,\nthe predicate ‘ship’ does not correspond to a natural kind\nin the world. Third, the two parties to the debate agree on all of the\n“non-ship” facts—in particular, both parties agree\nthat the rowboat is a vessel, that it floats on water, and that it is\nrelatively small in size. Given these points, it is tempting to say\nthat the two parties agree on all of the facts and that their\ndispute is merely verbal. Note that this conclusion is\nconsistent with the view that one of the parties is actually mistaken.\nSuppose, for example, that the doctrine of semantic\nexternalism is correct, so that the meaning of our shared terms\nis determined by the overall pattern of use within our linguistic\ncommunity (see the entry on\n externalism about mental content).\n That pattern of use may determine that one of the candidate\nmeanings—presumably the second—is the actual meaning of\n‘ship’ in English. In that case, the first party in the\ndebate is simply mistaken: the rowboat is not a ship. Still, there is\na clear sense in which the debate is verbal, for there is a possible\nlanguage (“English*”) that (a) employs a different,\nequally natural meaning for the predicate ‘ship’, (b) is\nadequate for describing all of the facts, and (c) is such that the\nfirst party’s statements come out true, relative to that\nlanguage. Thus, we might say that the real dispute between the two\nparties is over whether or not English is English*. And that is\nclearly a verbal dispute.  \nSome philosophers have suggested that the debate over material\nconstitution is defective in exactly the same way. There is no genuine\ndispute between Lewis and Unger, for example, over whether or not\nstatues exist. Both parties agree on all of the relevant\nfacts—in particular, both parties agree that there are simples\narranged statuewise. And both parties agree that there are two\npossible languages (“Lewis-English” and\n“Unger-English”) where the sentence “Statues\nexist” comes out true in one and false in the other. So the real\ndisagreement between Lewis and Unger is over whether English is\nLewis-English or whether it is Unger-English. In other words, the\ndebate is merely verbal. This kind of deflationist view is\noften associated with Rudolf Carnap (1950), Hilary Putnam (1987, 1994,\n2004) and, more recently, Eli Hirsch (2002a, 2002b, 2005). The issues\nraised by deflationism are extremely complicated; here, we will limit\nourselves to a few initial observations. (For a longer introduction to\nthese issues, see Chalmers, Manley, and Wasserman 2009. For an\nextended defense of deflationism, see Thomasson 2015.) \nIn the imagined dispute, we know exactly what the disputed term is\n(‘ship’) and exactly what the relevant candidate meanings\nare (a vessel that floats on water and a sufficiently\nlarge vessel that floats on water). In the actual dispute between\nLewis and Unger, matters are not so clear. One might suspect that the\ndisputed term in this case is the predicate ‘statue’, but\nit turns out to be fairly difficult to specify the relevant candidate\nmeanings. For example, we might say that, in Lewis-English,\n‘statue’ simply means a collection of simples arranged\nstatuewise. Whether or not that is a plausible interpretation of\nwhat Lewis means depends in part on the meaning of\n‘collection’ (for discussion, see Sider 2009, pp.\n388–90). In any case, it is even more difficult to specify an\nappropriate candidate meaning for ‘statue’ in\nUnger-English. More importantly, even if we are able to specify the\nrelevant candidate meanings, we will not have succeeded in showing\nthat the general dispute between Lewis and Unger is verbal, for the\ndispute can be brought out without using the predicate\n‘statue’ (or any non-logical predicate, for that matter).\nConsider, for example, a world that contains one-million simples\narranged statuewise and nothing else. And consider the numerical\nsentence (see section 4) which asserts the existence of (at least)\none-million and one things. Lewis and Unger will disagree over the\ntruth of that sentence. But that sentence contains only logical\nvocabulary. Hence, if the two parties are really talking past each\nother, then they must assign different meanings to one or more of the\nlogical constants. \nThe most plausible suggestion is that Lewis and Unger assign (or, at\nleast, intend to assign) different meanings to the existential\nquantifier, ‘∃’ (as well as quantificational phrases\nlike ‘there are’, ‘there is’, and\n‘some’). And, indeed, this is where deflationists have\nfocused their attention. Putnam, for example, writes that “[T]he\nlogical primitives themselves, and in particular the notions of object\nand existence, have a multitude of different uses rather than one\nabsolute ‘meaning’.” (1987, p. 71) This\nthesis—the thesis that there are many meanings for the\nexistential quantifier that are equally natural and equally adequate\nfor describing all the facts—is often referred to as“the\ndoctrine of quantifier variance” (Hirsch 2002b, Sider 2009).\nWhat exactly are the candidate meanings in question? Once again,\nmatters are not so clear. Lewis could, of course, simply interpret\nUnger to be using a restricted quantifier that ranges only\nover simples. On that interpretation, Unger speaks truthfully when he\nasserts “Statues do not exist”, since there are no statues\namong the simples. The problem with this interpretation is that it\nseems manifestly implausible, given that Unger will insist that his\nquantifiers are to be understood as unrestricted. Even more worrying\nis the question of how Unger is supposed to interpret Lewis. He\ncannot, for example, say that Lewis is using a less restrictive\nquantifier, for that would be to say that there are things (that\nLewis’s quantifier ranges over) that do not exist (by\nUnger’s own lights). Unger could, perhaps, take a more holistic\napproach and interpret Lewis’s assertion of “Statues\nexist” to mean there are some simples arranged\nstatuewise. More generally, Unger could interpret Lewis by\nreplacing singular quantifiers over composites with plural quantifiers\nover simples, and by replacing each predicate of composites with an\nirreducibly plural predicate of simples. Once again, we should expect\nprotest—Lewis will reject the proposed translation and insist\nthat he is using singular quantification when he asserts\n“Statues exist”.  \nThese initial observations bring out one disanalogy between the\nontological dispute and paradigm verbal disputes. In the earlier\nargument over whether or not boats are ships, the proposed\ntranslations are friendly, since the first party will admit\nthat he uses ‘ship’ to mean a vessel that floats on\nwater and the second will grant that he uses ‘ship’\nto mean a sufficiently large vessel that floats on water.\nGiven this disambiguation, the dispute will evaporate. The\ndeflationist’s proposals are instead hostile, for\nneither Lewis nor Unger will accept the deflationist interpretation\noffered by his opponent. (For further discussion on this point, see\nSider 2009, section 5.) This does not mean that the ontologists’\ndebate is non-verbal, but it does mean that the issues involved here\nare more complicated than those in paradigm verbal disputes.
