As evolution is too large of a topic to\naddress thoroughly in one entry, the primary goal of this entry is to\nserve as a broad overview of contemporary issues in evolution with\nlinks to other entries where more in-depth discussion can be found.\nThe entry begins with a brief survey of definitions of evolution,\nfollowed by a discussion of the different modes of evolution and\nrelated philosophical issues, and ends with a summary of other topics in\nthe philosophy of evolution focusing particularly on topics\ncovered in this encyclopedia.\n\nThe definition of evolution given at the outset of this entry is very\ngeneral; there are more specific ones in the literature, some of which\ndo not fit this general characterization. Here is a sampling. \nAlthough the work of Charles Darwin (see the entry on\n Darwinism) is usually the starting point for contemporary understandings\nof evolution, interestingly, he does not use the term in the first\nedition of On the Origin of Species, referring instead to\n“descent with modification”. In the early-mid 20th\ncentury, the “modern synthesis” gave birth to\n population genetics,\n which provided a mathematization of Darwinian evolutionary theory in\nlight of Mendelian genetics (see also the entry on\n evolutionary genetics).\n This yielded a prevalent—probably the most\nprevalent—understanding of evolution as “any change in the\nfrequency of alleles within a population from one generation to the\nnext”. Note, however, that this definition refers to evolution\nonly in a microevolutionary context and thus doesn’t reference\nthe emergence of new species (and their new characteristics), although\nit is intended to underlie those macroevolutionary changes.  \nIn a popular textbook, Douglas Futuyma gives a more expansive\ndefinition:  \n[biological evolution] is change in the properties of groups of\norganisms over the course of generations…it embraces everything\nfrom slight changes in the proportions of different forms of a gene\nwithin a population to the alterations that led from the earliest\norganism to dinosaurs, bees, oaks, and humans. (2005: 2)  \nNote also that Futuyma’s definition, unlike the population\ngenetics’ definition, does not limit itself to changes in\nalleles; John Endler’s definition is similar in this\nrespect:  \nEvolution may be defined as any net directional change or any\ncumulative change in the characteristics of organisms or populations\nover many generations—in other words, descent with\nmodification… It explicitly includes the origin as well as the\nspread of alleles, variants, trait values, or character states.\n(Endler 1986: 5)  \nYet even this definition is not expansive enough; molecular evolution\nfocuses on the molecular changes within macromolecules such as DNA and\nRNA.  \nIn a very different vein, Leigh van Valen characterized evolution as\n“the control of development by ecology” (1973, 488); this\nanticipates those who emphasize the importance of development in\nevolution, including proponents of “evo-devo” (see\n the entry on developmental biology).\n Today, some have called for an “extended evolutionary\nsynthesis” in light of developmental biology and other recent\nfindings in evolutionary biology. \nAlthough this entry focuses on biological evolution, philosophers and\nbiologists have also sought to extend evolutionary ideas to the\ncultural realm. Figuring out how and whether to extend the definition\nof evolution to this realm is part of the study of\n cultural evolution.\n  \nIn spite of this diversity of definitions, there has been very little\nphilosophical analysis of the term “evolution” itself.\nThis dearth forms a stark contrast to the voluminous literature in the\nphilosophy of evolution; indeed, for a long time the\n philosophy of biology\n was focused almost entirely on evolution. Thankfully, that is no\nlonger the case, with philosophers turning their attentions to issues\nin genetics, molecular biology, ecology, developmental biology, and\nmore. It may be, as Theodosius Dobzhansky famously said, that\n“Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of\nevolution” (1973: 125), but much of biology is not evolutionary\nbiology. Still, though, philosophy of evolution remains a growing and\nvibrant area within the philosophy of biology. \nIt is essential to understand that biologists recognize many ways that\nevolution can occur, evolution by\n natural selection\n being just one of them, although it is often held to be the most\nprevalent one. Evolution can also occur through genetic drift,\nmutation, or migration. It can also occur through sexual selection,\nwhich some consider to be a form of natural selection and others\nconsider to be distinct from natural selection (the latter having been\nDarwin’s 1859, 1874 view). Evolutionary theory, then, can be\ntaken to be the study (including, but not limited to, mathematical\nmodels) of these and other modes of evolution. \nTo see why it makes sense to think of multiple modes of evolution,\nconsider again one of the definitions of evolution presented above,\nwhere evolution is understood as “any change in the frequency of\nalleles within a population from one generation to the next”.\nWith natural selection, the frequency of alleles that confer greater\nfitness would tend to increase over those which confer lesser fitness.\nSexual selection would be the same, but with fitness understood\nstrictly in terms of mating ability. With genetic drift, a form of\nevolution that involves chance (see the entry on\n genetic drift\n  for explanation), there could be an increase in the frequency\nof alleles that confer greater fitness, an increase in the frequency\nof alleles that confer lesser fitness, or an increase in the frequency\nof alleles whose manifestation (if any) was neutral. If organisms\nmigrate from one population to another, it is likely that there will\nbe a change in the frequency of alleles in both populations. And if\nthere is a mutation from one allele to another, then the frequency of\nalleles in the population will likewise change, albeit by a small\namount. Distinguishing these different modes of evolution allows\nbiologists to track the various factors that are relevant to\nevolutionary changes in a population. \nThe careful reader may have noted that the previous paragraph invoked\nprobabilistic language: what tends to happen, what\ncould happen, what is likely to happen. Indeed,\nmathematical evolutionary models today (see the entry on\n population genetics)\n are typically statistical models. This fact about evolutionary\nmodels has given rise to a debate in the philosophy of evolution over\nwhether natural selection and genetic drift should be be understood as\ncauses of evolution, as most biologists conceive them, or as mere\nstatistical summaries of lower-level causes: births, deaths, etc. (The\n natural selection\n and\n genetic drift\n entries give more information about this debate). It is for this\nreason that this entry uses the more neutral phrase “modes of\nevolution” so as not to beg any questions under dispute between\nthe causalist and the statisticalist. \nAlthough there is widespread agreement that there are multiple modes\nof evolution, much contemporary work in biology and philosophy of\nbiology has been focused on natural selection. Whether this focus is a\ngood thing or not is in part what the debate over\n adaptationism\n is about. That is, do we have reason to think that natural selection\nis the most prevalent or most important mode of evolution? Should\nscientific methodologies be geared toward testing natural selection\nhypotheses or toward a variety of possible evolutionary modes? The\nfocus on natural selection has also led to a large literature on the\nconcept of\n fitness,\n given that population genetics’ definitions and other\ndefinitions of natural selection typically invoke fitness; a natural\nselection explanation of why X was more successful than\nY might invoke X’s higher fitness. What fitness\nmeans, what entities it applies to (genes, organisms, groups,\nindividuals, types), what sort of probabilities it invokes, if any,\nand how it should be calculated, are all under philosophical dispute.\nThere is also a large literature on conceptually and empirically\ndistinguishing natural selection from genetic drift. Migration,\nmutation (as a mode of evolution), and sexual selection have received\nless attention from philosophers of biology. \nSome of the work in the philosophy of evolution deals with\ncontroversial issues. There is, of course, the debate over\n creationism.\n The vast majority of philosophers agree that creationism has significantly less evidence in its favor as compared to the abundant evidence in favor of evolution.  They also agree that\ncreationism ought not to be taught in a public school science classroom,\nbut they sometimes disagree over the reasons why. For example, is\nit because it fails some criteria of science? If so, which criteria?\nOr is it because of the lack of evidence? Or is it because of its\nreligious basis? Debates over\n sociobiology\n and\n evolutionary psychology—areas\n that seek to explain human behavior and psychology as evolved\ncharacteristics—have likewise stirred up controversy over their\nscientific status. Proponents have also been accused of employing an\nexcessive and uncritical adaptationism and resting on sexist or other\nproblematic biases (on the latter, see the entry on\n feminist philosophy of biology). \nAnother nexus of topics in the philosophy of evolution involves\n heredity and heritability.\n Although it was not explicitly emphasized in the definitions of\nevolution given above, evolution is usually taken to be about\nheritable changes over time, i.e., characteristics that are\nable to be passed from one generation to the next. But there has been\nsome discussion over which entities can properly be said to be\nheritable. Genes are uncontroversial, but are seen as too limited by\nsome, who would consider phenomena such as learning and cultural\ntransmission, epigenetic inheritance, and ecological inheritance to be\nheritable as well. The term “heritability” can likewise\ncause confusion, as it is a technical term within evolutionary theory,\nand understanding the term and its implications is not trivial.\nClassically, heredity has been thought of in terms of the\n genotype/phenotype distinction,\n with genotypes being seen as heritable and phenotypes being seen as\nnot heritable. But to accept that distinction seems to accept a\ndistinction between\n innate and acquired characteristics,\n and that distinction has been challenged, or at least shown to be\nmore complicated than it would seem at first glance. Heredity also\nraises questions about\n biological information—do\n genotypes pass along information, and if so, in what\nsense? \nRelatedly, for heredity to be a part of evolution, there must be\n replication\n of entities, or at least reproduction (with the former being a\nspecial case of the latter that involves copying). In order to allow\nfor a more general theory of evolution, many authors will speak of\nreplicators (or reproducers) and vehicles (or interactors) rather than\nthe more limited and specific terms “genes” and\n“organisms”. With these terms in hand, one can more easily\nbegin to discuss (as many have) questions over\n units and levels of selection:\n does selection occur at the level of the gene, the organism, the\ngroup, the species, or all of the above? These units of selection\n(replicators/reproducers or vehicles/interactors) are often taken to\nbe biological individuals (see the entry on\n the biological notion of individual)\n as a necessary condition for being units of selection at all.  \nInterestingly, another major area in which biological individuality\nhas played a large role is in debates over the nature of  species.\n That is, many philosophers of biology maintain that species are\nproperly construed as individuals. Species, often referred to as\n“units of evolution”—groups of organisms that evolve\nin a unified way—are nonetheless rarely seen as units of\nselection. In Elisabeth Lloyd’s terminology (see the\nentry on\n units and levels of selection),\n this is presumably because species are rarely seen as\nreplicators/reproducers or vehicles/interactors but are commonly seen\nas beneficiaries of evolution by natural selection. In addition to\nsorting out whether species are individuals and what sort of units of\nevolution (if any) they might be, there are many-decades’ worth\nof papers trying to characterize the species concept, whether in terms\nof interbreeding, phylogeny, morphology, ecology, or some other set of\ncharacteristics. Here, as in many other areas of the philosophy of\nbiology, there have also been arguments for a pluralistic\napproach. \nYet another area of discussion is\n evolutionary game theory—an\n application of the mathematical theory of games to biological and\nother evolutionary contexts. It has provided a source of putative\nexplanations for human and other behaviors; evolutionary psychology,\nmentioned above, is one area that frequently makes use of a game\ntheory approach. Among the more challenging behaviors that\nevolutionary game theory has sought to explain is\n altruism.\n With altruism, we again encounter questions about the level at which\nselection is operating (organisms or groups) because of questions\nabout which entities selection is benefiting or harming.
