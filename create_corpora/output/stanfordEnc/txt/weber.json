Weber’s wide-ranging\ncontributions gave critical impetus to the birth of new academic\ndisciplines such as sociology as well as to the significant\nreorientation in law, economics, political science, and religious\nstudies. His methodological writings were instrumental in establishing\nthe self-identity of modern social science as a distinct field of\ninquiry; he is still claimed as the source of inspiration by empirical\npositivists and their hermeneutic detractors alike. More\nsubstantively, Weber’s two most celebrated contributions were\nthe “rationalization thesis,” a grand meta-historical\nanalysis of the dominance of the west in modern times, and the\n“Protestant Ethic thesis,” a non-Marxist genealogy of\nmodern capitalism. Together, these two theses helped launch his\nreputation as one of the founding theorists of modernity. In addition,\nhis avid interest and participation in politics led to a unique strand\nof political realism comparable to that of Machiavelli and Hobbes. As\nsuch, Max Weber’s influence was far-reaching across the vast\narray of disciplinary, methodological, ideological and philosophical\nreflections that are still our own and increasingly more so.\n\nMaximilian Carl Emil “Max” Weber (1864–1920) was\nborn in the Prussian city of Erfurt to a family of notable heritage.\nHis father, Max Sr., came from a Westphalian family of merchants and\nindustrialists in the textile business and went on to become a lawyer\nand National Liberal parliamentarian in Wilhelmine politics. His\nmother, Helene, came from the Fallenstein and Souchay families, both\nof the long illustrious Huguenot line, which had for generations\nproduced public servants and academicians. His younger brother,\nAlfred, was an influential political economist and sociologist, too.\nEvidently, Max Weber was brought up in a prosperous, cosmopolitan, and\nhighly cultivated family milieu that was well-plugged into the\npolitical, social, and cultural establishment of the German\nBürgertum [Roth 2000]. Also, his parents represented\ntwo, often conflicting, poles of identity between which their eldest\nson would struggle throughout his life — worldly statesmanship\nand ascetic scholarship. \nEducated mainly at the universities of Heidelberg and Berlin, Weber\nwas trained in law, eventually writing his\nHabilitationsschrift on Roman law and agrarian history under\nAugust Meitzen, a prominent political economist of the time. After\nsome flirtation with legal practice and public service, he received an\nimportant research commission from the Verein für\nSozialpolitik (the leading social science association under\nGustav Schmoller’s leadership) and produced the so-called East\nElbian Report on the displacement of the German agrarian workers in\nEast Prussia by Polish migrant labours. Greeted upon publication with\nhigh acclaim and political controversy, this early success led to his\nfirst university appointment at Freiburg in 1894 to be followed by a\nprestigious professorship in political economy at Heidelberg two years\nlater. Weber and his wife Marianne, an intellectual in her own right\nand early women’s rights activist, soon found themselves at the\ncenter of the vibrant intellectual and cultural life of Heidelberg;\nthe so-called “Weber Circle” attracted such intellectual\nluminaries as Georg Jellinek, Ernst Troeltsch, and Werner Sombart and\nlater a number of younger scholars including Marc Bloch, Robert\nMichels, and György Lukács. Weber was also active in\npublic life as he continued to play an important role as a Young Turk\nin the Verein and maintain a close association with the\nliberal Evangelische-soziale Kongress (especially with the\nleader of its younger generation, Friedrich Naumann). It was during\nthis time that he first established a solid reputation as a brilliant\npolitical economist and outspoken public intellectual. \nAll these fruitful years came to an abrupt halt in 1897 when Weber\ncollapsed with a nervous-breakdown shortly after his father’s\nsudden death (precipitated by a heated confrontation with Weber)\n[Radkau 2011, 53–69]. His routine as a teacher and scholar was\ninterrupted so badly that he eventually withdrew from regular teaching\nduties in 1903, to which he would not return until 1919. Although\nseverely compromised and unable to write as prolifically as before, he\nstill managed to immerse himself in the study of various philosophical\nand religious topics, which resulted in a new direction in his\nscholarship as the publication of miscellaneous methodological essays\nas well as The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\n(1904–1905) testifies. Also noteworthy about this period is his\nextensive visit to America in 1904, which left an indelible trace in\nhis understanding of modernity in general [Scaff 2011]. \nAfter this stint essentially as a private scholar, he slowly resumed\nhis participation in various academic and public activities. With\nEdgar Jaffé and Sombart, he took over editorial control of the\nArchiv für Sozialwissenschaften und Sozialpolitik,\nturning it into a leading social science journal of the day as well as\nhis new institutional platform. In 1909, he co-founded the\nDeutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie, in part as a\nresult of his growing unease with the Verein’s\nconservative politics and lack of methodological discipline, becoming\nits first treasurer (he would resign from it in 1912, though). This\nperiod of his life, until interrupted by the outbreak of the First\nWorld War in 1914, brought the pinnacles of his achievements as he\nworked intensely in two areas – the comparative sociology of\nworld religions and his contributions to the Grundriss der\nSozialökonomik (to be published posthumously as Economy\nand Society). Along with the major methodological essays that he\ndrafted during this time, these works would become mainly responsible\nfor Weber’s enduring reputation as one of the founding fathers\nof modern social science. \nWith the onset of the First World War, Weber’s involvement in\npublic life took an unexpected turn. At first a fervent nationalist\nsupporter of the war, as virtually all German intellectuals of the\ntime were, he grew disillusioned with the German war policies,\neventually refashioning himself as one of the most vocal critics of\nthe Kaiser government in a time of war. As a public intellectual, he\nissued private reports to government leaders and wrote journalistic\npieces to warn against the Belgian annexation policy and the unlimited\nsubmarine warfare, which, as the war deepened, evolved into a call for\noverall democratization of the authoritarian state that was Wilhelmine\nGermany. By 1917, Weber was campaigning vigorously for a wholesale\nconstitutional reform for post-war Germany, including the introduction\nof universal suffrage and the empowerment of parliament. \nWhen defeat came in 1918, Germany found in Weber a public intellectual\nleader, even possibly a future statesman, with relatively solid\nliberal democratic credentials who was well-positioned to influence\nthe course of post-war reconstruction. He was invited to join the\ndraft board of the Weimar Constitution as well as the German\ndelegation to Versaille; albeit in vain, he even ran for a\nparliamentary seat on the liberal Democratic Party ticket. In those\ncapacities, however, he opposed the German Revolution (all too\nsensibly) and the Versaille Treaty (all too quixotically) alike,\nputting himself in an unsustainable position that defied the partisan\nalignments of the day. By all accounts, his political activities bore\nlittle fruit, except his advocacy for a robust plebiscitary presidency\nin the Weimar Constitution. \nFrustrated with day-to-day politics, he turned to his scholarly\npursuits with renewed vigour. In 1919, he briefly taught in turn at\nthe universities of Vienna (General Economic History was an\noutcome of this experience) and Munich (where he gave the much-lauded\nlectures, Science as a Vocation and Politics as a\nVocation), while compiling his scattered writings on religion in\nthe form of massive three-volume Gesammelte Aufsätze zur\nReligionssoziologie [GARS hereafter]. All these\nreinvigorated scholarly activities ended abruptly in 1920, however,\nwhen he succumbed to the Spanish flue and died suddenly of pneumonia\nin Munich. Max Weber was fifty six years old. \nPutting Weber in the context of philosophical tradition proper is not\nan easy task. For all the astonishing variety of identities that can\nbe ascribed to him as a scholar, he was certainly no philosopher at\nleast in the narrow sense of the term. His reputation as a Solonic\nlegislator of modern social science also tends to cloud our\nappreciation of the extent to which his ideas were embedded in the\nintellectual tradition of the time. Broadly speaking, Weber’s\nphilosophical worldview, if not coherent philosophy, was informed by\nthe deep crisis of the Enlightenment project in fin-de-siècle\nEurope, which was characterized by the intellectual revolt against\npositivist reason, a celebration of subjective will and intuition, and\na neo-Romantic longing for spiritual wholesomeness [Hughes 1977]. In\nother words, Weber belonged to a generation of self-claimed epigones\nwho had to struggle with the legacies of Darwin, Marx, and Nietzsche.\nAs such, the philosophical backdrop to his thoughts will be outlined\nhere along two axes: epistemology and ethics. \nWeber encountered the pan-European cultural crisis of his time mainly\nas filtered through the jargon of German Historicism [Beiser 2011].\nHis early training in law had exposed him to the sharp divide between\nthe reigning Labandian legal positivism and the historical\njurisprudence championed by Otto von Gierke (one of his teachers at\nBerlin); in his later incarnation as a political economist, he was\nkeenly interested in the heated “strife over methods”\n(Methodenstreit) between the positivist economic methodology\nof Carl Menger and the historical economics of Schmoller (his mentor\nduring the early days). Arguably, however, it was not until Weber grew\nacquainted with the Baden or Southwestern School of Neo-Kantians,\nespecially through Wilhelm Windelband, Emil Lask, and Heinrich Rickert\n(his one-time colleague at Freiburg), that he found a rich conceptual\ntemplate suitable for the clearer elaboration of his own\nepistemological position. \nIn opposition to a Hegelian emanationist epistemology, briefly,\nNeo-Kantians shared the Kantian dichotomy between reality and concept.\nNot an emanent derivative of concepts as Hegel posited, reality is\nirrational and incomprehensible, and the concept, only an abstract\nconstruction of our mind. Nor is the concept a matter of will,\nintuition, and subjective consciousness as Wilhelm Dilthey posited.\nAccording to Hermann Cohen, one of the early Neo-Kantians, concept\nformation is fundamentally a cognitive process, which cannot but be\nrational as Kant held. If our cognition is logical and all reality\nexists within cognition, then only a reality that we can comprehend in\nthe form of knowledge is rational — metaphysics is thereby\nreduced to epistemology, and Being to logic. As such, the process of\nconcept formation both in the natural (Natur-) and the\ncultural-historical sciences (Geisteswissenschaften) has to be\nuniversal as well as abstract, not different in kind but in their\nsubject matters. The latter is only different in dealing with the\nquestion of values in addition to logical relationships. \nFor Windelband, however, the difference between the two kinds of\nknowledge has to do with its aim and method as well.\nCultural-historical knowledge is not concerned with a phenomenon\nbecause of what it shares with other phenomena, but rather because of\nits own definitive qualities. For values, which form its proper\nsubject, are radically subjective, concrete and individualistic.\nUnlike the “nomothetic” knowledge that natural science\nseeks, what matters in historical science is not a universal law-like\ncausality, but an understanding of the particular way in which an\nindividual ascribes values to certain events and institutions or takes\na position towards the general cultural values of his/her time under a\nunique, never-to-be-repeated constellation of historical\ncircumstances. Therefore, cultural-historical science seeks\n“ideographic” knowledge; it aims to understand the\nparticular, concrete and irrational “historical\nindividual” with inescapably universal, abstract, and\nrational concepts. Turning irrational reality into rational concept,\nit does not simply paint (abbilden) a picture of reality but\ntransforms (umbilden) it. Occupying the gray area between\nirrational reality and rational concept, then, its question became\ntwofold for the Neo-Kantians. One is in what way we can understand the\nirreducibly subjective values held by the historical actors in an\nobjective fashion, and the other, by what criteria we can select a\ncertain historical phenomenon as opposed to another as historically\nsignificant subject matter worthy of our attention. In short, the\nissue was not only the values to be comprehended by the seeker of\nhistorical knowledge, but also his/her own values, which are no less\nsubjective. Value-judgment (Werturteil) as well as value\n(Wert) became a keen issue. \nAccording to Rickert’s definitive elaboration, value-judgment\nprecedes values. He posits that the “in-dividual,” as\nopposed to mere “individual,” phenomenon can be isolated\nas a discrete subject of our historical inquiry when we ascribe\ncertain subjective values to the singular coherence and indivisibility\nthat are responsible for its uniqueness. In his theory of\nvalue-relation (Wertbeziehung), Rickert argues that relating\nhistorical objects to values can still retain objective validity when\nit is based on a series of explicitly formulated conceptual\ndistinctions; that between the investigator’s values and those\nof the historical actor under investigation, between personal or\nprivate values and general cultural values of the time, and between\nsubjective value-judgment and objective value-relations. \nIn so positing, however, Rickert is making two highly questionable\nassumptions. One is that there are certain values in every culture\nthat are universally accepted within that culture as valid, and the\nother, that a historian free of bias must agree on what these values\nare. Just as natural science must assume “unconditionally and\nuniversally valid laws of nature,” so, too, cultural-historical\nscience must assume that there are “unconditionally and\nuniversally valid values.” If so, an “in-dividual”\nhistorical event has to be reduced to an “individual”\nmanifestation of the objective process of history, a conclusion that\nessentially implies that Rickert returned to the German Idealist faith\nin the meaningfulness of history and the objective validity of the\ndiverse values to be found in history. An empirical study in\nhistorical science, in the end, cannot do without a metaphysics of\nhistory. Bridging irrational reality and rational concept in\nhistorical science, or overcoming hiatus irrationalis\n(à la Lask) without recourse to a metaphysics of history still\nremained a problem as acutely as before. While accepting the broadly\nneo-Kantian conceptual template as Rickert elaborated it,\nWeber’s methodological writings would turn mostly on this\nissue. \nGerman Idealism seems to have exerted another enduring influence on\nWeber, discernible in his ethical worldview more than in his\nepistemological position. This was the strand of Idealist discourse in\nwhich a broadly Kantian ethic and its Nietzschean critique figure\nprominently. \nThe way in which Weber understood Kant seems to have come through the\nconceptual template set by moral psychology and philosophical\nanthropology. In conscious opposition to the utilitarian-naturalistic\njustification of modern individualism, Kant viewed moral action as\nsimultaneously principled and self-disciplined and expressive\nof genuine freedom and autonomy. On this Kantian view, freedom and\nautonomy are to be found in the instrumental control of the self and\nthe world (objectification) according to a law formulated solely from\nwithin (subjectification). Furthermore, such a paradoxical compound is\nmade possible by an internalization or willful acceptance of a\ntranscendental rational principle, which saves it from falling prey to\nthe hedonistic subjectification that Kant found in Enlightenment\nnaturalism and which he so detested. Kant in this regard follows\nRousseau in condemning utilitarianism; instrumental-rational control\nof the world in the service of our desires and needs just degenerates\ninto organized egoism. In order to prevent it, mere freedom of choice\nbased on elective will (Willkür) has to be replaced by\nthe exercise of purely rational will (Wille). Instrumental\ntransformation of the self is thus the crucial benchmark of autonomous\nmoral agency for Kant as well as for Locke, but its basis has been\nfundamentally altered in Kant; it should be done with the purpose of\nserving a higher end, that is, the universal law of reason. A willful\nself-transformation is demanded now in the service of a higher law\nbased on reason, or an “ultimate value” in Weber’s\nparlance.  \nWeber’s understanding of this Kantian ethical template was\nstrongly tinged by the Protestant theological debate taking place in\nthe Germany of his time between (orthodox Lutheran) Albrecht Ritschl\nand Matthias Schneckenburger (of Calvinist persuasion), a context with\nwhich Weber became acquainted through his Heidelberg colleague,\nTroeltsch. Suffice it to note in this connection that Weber’s\nsharp critique of Ritschl’s Lutheran communitarianism seems\nreflective of his broadly Kantian preoccupation with radically\nsubjective individualism and the methodical transformation of the self\n[Graf 1995]. \nAll in all, one might say that:“the preoccupations of Kant and\nof Weber are really the same. One was a philosopher and the other a\nsociologist, but there… the difference ends” [Gellner\n1974, 184]. That which also ends, however, is Weber’s\nsubscription to a Kantian ethic of duty when it comes to the\npossibility of a universal law of reason. Weber was keenly aware of\nthe fact that the Kantian linkage between growing self-consciousness,\nthe possibility of universal law, and principled and thus free action\nhad been irrevocably severed. Kant managed to preserve the precarious\nduo of non-arbitrary action and subjective freedom by asserting such a\nlinkage, which Weber believed to be unsustainable in his allegedly\nNietzschean age. \nAccording to Nietzsche, “will to truth” cannot be content\nwith the metaphysical construction of a grand metanarrative, whether\nit be monotheistic religion or modern science, and growing\nself-consciousness, or “intellectualization” à la\nWeber, can lead only to a radical skepticism, value relativism, or,\neven worse, nihilism. According to such a Historicist diagnosis of\nmodernity that culminates in the “death of God,” the\nalternative seems to be either a radical self-assertion and\nself-creation that runs the risk of being arbitrary (as in Nietzsche)\nor a complete desertion of the modern ideal of self-autonomous freedom\n(as in early Foucault). If the first approach leads to a radical\ndivinization of humanity, one possible extension of modern humanism,\nthe second leads inexorably to a “dedivinization” of\nhumanity, a postmodern antihumanism [Vattimo 1988, 31–47]. \nSeen in this light, Weber’s ethical sensibility is built on a\nfirm rejection of a Nietzschean divination and Foucaultian resignation\nalike, both of which are radically at odds with a Kantian ethic of\nduty. In other words, Weber’s ethical project can be described\nas a search for a non-arbitrary form of freedom (his Kantian side) in\nwhat he perceived as an increasingly post-metaphysical world (his\nNietzschean side). According to Paul Honigsheim, his pupil and distant\ncousin, Weber’s ethic is that of “tragedy” and\n“nevertheless” [Honigsheim 2003, 113]. This deep tension\nbetween the Kantian moral imperatives and a Nietzschean diagnosis of\nthe modern cultural world is apparently what gives such a darkly\ntragic and agnostic shade to Weber’s ethical worldview. \nWeber’s main contribution as such, nonetheless, lies neither in\nepistemology nor in ethics. Although they deeply informed his thoughts\nto an extent still under-appreciated, his main preoccupation lay\nelsewhere. He was after all one of the founding fathers of modern\nsocial science. Beyond the recognition, however, that Weber is not\nsimply a sociologist par excellence as Talcott Parsons’s\nDurkheimian interpretation made him out to be, identifying an\nidée maîtresse throughout his disparate oeuvre\nhas been debated ever since his own days and is still far from\nsettled. Economy and Society, his alleged magnum\nopus, was a posthumous publication based upon his widow’s\neditorship, the thematic architectonic of which is unlikely to be\nreconstructed beyond doubt even after its recent reissuing under the\nrubric of Max Weber Gesamtausgabe [MWG hereafter].\nGARS forms a more coherent whole since its editorial edifice\nwas the work of Weber himself; and yet, its relationship to his other\nsociologies of, for instance, law, city, music, domination, and\neconomy, remains controvertible. Accordingly, his overarching theme\nhas also been variously surmised as a developmental history of Western\nrationalism (Wolfgang Schluchter), the universal history of\nrationalist culture (Friedrich Tenbruck), or simply the\nMenschentum as it emerges and degenerates in modern rational\nsociety (Wilhelm Hennis). The first depicts Weber as a\ncomparative-historical sociologist; the second, a latter-day Idealist\nhistorian of culture reminiscent of Jacob Burckhardt; and the third, a\npolitical philosopher on a par with Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Rousseau.\nImportant as they are for in-house Weber scholarship, however, these\nphilological disputes need not hamper our attempt to grasp the gist of\nhis ideas. Suffice it for us to recognize that, albeit with varying\ndegrees of emphasis, these different interpretations all converge on\nthe thematic centrality of rationality, rationalism, and\nrationalization in making sense of Weber. \nAt the outset, what immediately strikes a student of Weber’s\nrationalization thesis is its seeming irreversibility and\nEurocentrism. The apocalyptic imagery of the “iron cage”\nthat haunts the concluding pages of the Protestant Ethic is\ncommonly taken to reflect his dark fatalism about the inexorable\nunfolding of rationalization and its culmination in the complete loss\nof freedom and meaning in the modern world. The “Author’s\nIntroduction” (Vorbemerkung to GARS) also\ncontains oft-quoted passages that allegedly disclose Weber’s\nbelief in the unique singularity of Western civilization’s\nachievement in the direction of rationalization, or lack thereof in\nother parts of the world. For example: \nTaken together, then, the rationalization process as Weber narrated it\nseems quite akin to a metahistorical teleology that irrevocably sets\nthe West apart from and indeed above the East. \nAt the same time, nonetheless, Weber adamantly denied the possibility\nof a universal law of history in his methodological essays. Even\nwithin the same pages of Vorbemerkung, he said,\n“rationalizations of the most varied character have existed in\nvarious departments of life and in all areas of culture”\n[Ibid., 26]. He also made clear that his study of various\nforms of world religions was to be taken for its heuristic value\nrather than as “complete analyses of cultures, however\nbrief” [Ibid., 27]. It was meant as a\ncomparative-conceptual platform on which to erect the edifying\nfeatures of rationalization in the West. If merely a heuristic device\nand not a universal law of progress, then, what is rationalization and\nwhence comes his uncompromisingly dystopian vision? \nRoughly put, taking place in all areas of human life from religion and\nlaw to music and architecture, rationalization means a historical\ndrive towards a world in which “one can, in principle, master\nall things by calculation” [Weber 1919/1946, 139]. For instance,\nmodern capitalism is a rational mode of economic life because it\ndepends on a calculable process of production. This search for exact\ncalculability underpins such institutional innovations as monetary\naccounting (especially double-entry bookkeeping), centralization of\nproduction control, separation of workers from the means of\nproduction, supply of formally free labour, disciplined control on the\nfactory floor, and other features that make modern capitalism\nqualitatively different from all other modes of organizing\neconomic life. The enhanced calculability of the production process is\nalso buttressed by that in non-economic spheres such as law and\nadministration. Legal formalism and bureaucratic management reinforce\nthe elements of predictability in the sociopolitical environment that\nencumbers industrial capitalism by means of introducing formal\nequality of citizenship, a rule-bound legislation of legal norms, an\nautonomous judiciary, and a depoliticized professional bureaucracy.\nFurther, all this calculability and predictability in political,\nsocial, and economic spheres was not possible without changes of\nvalues in ethics, religion, psychology, and culture. Institutional\nrationalization was, in other words, predicated upon the rise of a\npeculiarly rational type of personality, or a “person of\nvocation” (Berufsmensch) as outlined in the\nProtestant Ethic. The outcome of this complex interplay of\nideas and interests was modern rational Western civilization with its\nenormous material and cultural capacity for relentless\nworld-mastery. \nOn a more analytical plateau, all these disparate processes of\nrationalization can be surmised as increasing knowledge, growing\nimpersonality, and enhanced control [Brubaker 1991, 32–35].\nFirst, knowledge. Rational action in one very general sense\npresupposes knowledge. It requires some knowledge of the ideational\nand material circumstances in which our action is embedded, since to\nact rationally is to act on the basis of conscious reflection about\nthe probable consequences of action. As such, the knowledge that\nunderpins a rational action is of a causal nature conceived in terms\nof means-ends relationships, aspiring towards a systematic, logically\ninterconnected whole. Modern scientific and technological knowledge is\na culmination of this process that Weber called intellectualization,\nin the course of which, the germinating grounds of human knowledge in\nthe past, such as religion, theology, and metaphysics, were slowly\npushed back to the realm of the superstitious, mystical, or simply\nirrational. It is only in modern Western civilization, according to\nWeber, that this gradual process of disenchantment\n(Entzauberung) has reached its radical conclusion. \nSecond, impersonality. Rationalization, according to Weber, entails\nobjectification (Versachlichung). Industrial capitalism, for\none, reduces workers to sheer numbers in an accounting book,\ncompletely free from the fetters of tradition and non-economic\nconsiderations, and so does the market relationship vis-à-vis\nbuyers and sellers. For another, having abandoned the principle of\nKhadi justice (i.e., personalized ad hoc adjudication),\nmodern law and administration also rule in strict accordance with the\nsystematic formal codes and sine ira et studio, that is,\n“without anger or passion.” Again, Weber found the seed of\nobjectification not in material interests alone, but in the Puritan\nvocational ethic (Berufsethik) and the life conduct that it\ninspired, which was predicated upon a disenchanted monotheistic\ntheodicy that reduced humans to mere tools of God’s providence.\nIronically, for Weber, modern inward subjectivity was born once we\nlost any inherent value qua humans and became thoroughly\nobjectified vis-à-vis God in the course of the Reformation.\nModern individuals are subjectified and objectified all at once. \nThird, control. Pervasive in Weber’s view of rationalization is\nthe increasing control in social and material life. Scientific and\ntechnical rationalization has greatly improved both the human capacity\nfor a mastery over nature and institutionalized discipline\nvia bureaucratic administration, legal formalism, and\nindustrial capitalism. The calculable, disciplined control over humans\nwas, again, an unintended consequence of the Puritan ethic of rigorous\nself-discipline and self-control, or what Weber called\n“innerworldly asceticism (innerweltliche\nAskese).” Here again, Weber saw the irony that a modern\nindividual citizen equipped with inviolable rights was born as a part\nof the rational, disciplinary ethos that increasingly penetrated into\nevery aspect of social life. \nThus seen, rationalization as Weber postulated it is anything but an\nunequivocal historical phenomenon. As already pointed out, first,\nWeber views it as a process taking place in disparate fields of human\nlife with a logic of each field’s own and varying directions;\n“each one of these fields may be rationalized in terms of very\ndifferent ultimate values and ends, and what is rational from one\npoint of view may well be irrational from another” [Weber\n1920/1992, 27]. Second, and more important, its ethical ramification\nfor Weber is deeply ambivalent. To use his own dichotomy, the\nformal-procedural rationality (Zweckrationalität) to\nwhich Western rationalization tends does not necessarily go with a\nsubstantive-value rationality (Wertrationalität). On the\none hand, exact calculability and predictability in the social\nenvironment that formal rationalization has brought about dramatically\nenhances individual freedom by helping individuals understand and\nnavigate through the complex web of practice and institutions in order\nto realize the ends of their own choice. On the other hand, freedom\nand agency are seriously curtailed by the same force in history when\nindividuals are reduced to a “cog in a machine,” or\ntrapped in an “iron cage” that formal rationalization has\nspawned with irresistible efficiency and at the expense of substantive\nrationality. Thus his famous lament in the Protestant\nEthic: \nThird, Weber envisions the future of rationalization not only in terms\nof “mechanized petrification,” but also of a chaotic, even\natrophic, inundation of subjective values. In other words, the\nbureaucratic “iron cage” is only one side of the modernity\nthat rationalization has brought about; the other is a\n“polytheism” of value-fragmentation. At the apex of\nrationalization, we moderns have suddenly found ourselves living\n“as did the ancients when their world was not yet disenchanted\nof its gods and demons” [Weber 1919/1946, 148]. Modern Western\nsociety is, Weber seems to say, once again enchanted as a result of\ndisenchantment. How did this happen and with what consequences? \nIn point of fact, Weber’s rationalization thesis can be\nunderstood with richer nuance when we approach it as, for lack of\nbetter terms, a dialectics of disenchantment and reenchantment rather\nthan as a one-sided, unilinear process of secularization.\nDisenchantment had ushered in monotheistic religions in the West. In\npractice, this means that ad hoc maxims for life-conduct had\nbeen gradually displaced by a unified total system of meaning and\nvalue, which historically culminated in the Puritan ethic of vocation.\nHere, the irony was that disenchantment was an ongoing process\nnonetheless. Disenchantment in its second phase pushed aside\nmonotheistic religion as something irrational, thus delegitimating it\nas a unifying worldview in the modern secular world. \nModern science, which was singularly responsible for this late\ndevelopment, was initially welcomed as a surrogate system of orderly\nvalue-creation, as Weber found in the convictions of Bacon (science as\n“the road to true nature”) and Descartes (as\n“the road to the true god”) [Weber 1919/1946,\n142]. For Weber, nevertheless, modern science is a deeply nihilistic\nenterprise in which any scientific achievement worthy of the name\nmust “ask to be surpassed and made obsolete” in a\nprocess “that is in principle ad infinitum,” at\nwhich point, “we come to the problem of the meaning of\nscience.” He went on to ask: “For it is simply not\nself-evident that something which is subject to such a law is in\nitself meaningful and rational. Why should one do something which in\nreality never comes to an end and never can?” [Ibid.,\n138: translation altered]. In short, modern science has relentlessly\ndeconstructed other sources of value-creation, in the course of which\nits own meaning has also been dissipated beyond repair. The result is\nthe “Götterdämmerung of all evaluative\nperspectives” including its own [Weber 1904/1949, 86]. \nIrretrievably gone as a result is a unifying worldview, be it\nreligious or scientific, and what ensues is its fragmentation into\nincompatible value spheres. Weber, for instance, observed:\n“since Nietzsche, we realize that something can be beautiful,\nnot only in spite of the aspect in which it is not good, but rather in\nthat very aspect” [Weber 1919/1946, 148]. That is to say,\naesthetic values now stand in irreconcilable antagonism to religious\nvalues, transforming “value judgments (Werturteile)\ninto judgments of taste (Geschmacksurteile) by which what is\nmorally reprehensible becomes merely what is tasteless” [Weber\n1915/1946, 342]. \nWeber is, then, not envisioning a peaceful dissolution of the\ngrand metanarratives of monotheistic religion and universal science\ninto a series of local narratives and the consequent modern pluralist\nculture in which different cultural practices follow their own\nimmanent logic. His vision of polytheistic reenchantment is rather\nthat of an incommensurable value-fragmentation into a plurality of\nalternative metanarratives, each of which claims to answer the same\nmetaphysical questions that religion and science strove to cope with\nin their own ways. The slow death of God has reached its apogee in the\nreturn of gods and demons who “strive to gain power over our\nlives and again ... resume their eternal struggle with one\nanother” [Weber 1919/1946, 149]. \nSeen this way, it makes sense that Weber’s rationalization\nthesis concludes with two strikingly dissimilar prophecies — one\nis the imminent iron cage of bureaucratic petrification and the other,\nthe Hellenistic pluralism of warring deities. The modern world has\ncome to be monotheistic and polytheistic all at once. What seems to\nunderlie this seemingly self-contradictory imagery of modernity is the\nproblem of modern humanity (Menschentum) and its loss of\nfreedom and moral agency. Disenchantment has created a world with no\nobjectively ascertainable ground for one’s conviction. Under the\ncircumstances, according to Weber, a modern individual tends to act\nonly on one’s own aesthetic impulse and arbitrary convictions\nthat cannot be communicated in the eventuality; the majority of those\nwho cannot even act on their convictions, or the “last men who\ninvented happiness” à la Nietzsche, lead the life of a\n“cog in a machine.” Whether the problem of modernity is\naccounted for in terms of a permeation of objective, instrumental\nrationality or of a purposeless agitation of subjective values, Weber\nviewed these two images as constituting a single problem insofar as\nthey contributed to the inertia of modern individuals who fail to take\nprincipled moral action. The “sensualists without heart”\nand “specialists without spirit” indeed formed two faces\nof the same coin that may be called the disempowerment of the\nmodern self. \nOnce things were different, Weber claimed. An unflinching sense of\nconviction that relied on nothing but one’s innermost\npersonality once issued in a highly methodical and disciplined conduct\nof everyday life — or, simply, life as a duty. Born amidst the\nturmoil of the Reformation, this archetypal modern self drew its\nstrength solely from within in the sense that one’s principle of\naction was determined by one’s own psychological need to gain\nself-affirmation. Also, the way in which this deeply introspective\nsubjectivity was practiced, that is, in self-mastery, entailed a\nhighly rational and radically methodical attitude towards one’s\ninner self and the outer, objective world. Transforming the self into\nan integrated personality and mastering the world with tireless\nenergy, subjective value and objective rationality once formed\n“one unbroken whole” [Weber 1910/1978, 319]. Weber calls\nthe agent of this unity the “person of vocation”\n(Berufsmensch) in his religious writings,\n“personality” (Persönlichkeit) in the\nmethodological essays, “genuine politician”\n(Berufspolitiker) in the political writings, and\n“charismatic individual” in Economy and\n Society.[1]\n The much-celebrated Protestant Ethic thesis was indeed a genealogical\naccount of this idiosyncratic moral agency in modern times [Goldman\n1992]. \nOnce different, too, was the mode of society constituted by and in\nturn constitutive of this type of moral agency. Weber’s social\nimagination revealed its keenest sense of irony when he traced the\nroot of the cohesive integration, intense socialization, and severe\ncommunal discipline of the “sectlike society”\n(Sektengesellschaft) to the isolated and introspective\nsubjectivity of the Puritan person of vocation. The irony was that the\nself-absorbed, anxiety-ridden and even antisocial virtues of the\nperson of vocation could be sustained only in the thick disciplinary\nmilieu of small-scale associational life. Membership in exclusive\nvoluntary associational life is open, and it is such membership, or\n“achieved quality,” that guarantees the ethical qualities\nof the individuals with whom one interacts. “The old ‘sect\nspirit’ holds sway with relentless effect in the intrinsic\nnature of such associations,” Weber observed, for the sect was\nthe first mass organization to combine individual agency and social\ndiscipline in such a systematic way. Weber thus claimed that\n“the ascetic conventicles and sects … formed one of the\nmost important foundations of modern individualism” [Weber\n1920/1946, 321]. It seems clear that what Weber was trying to outline\nhere is an archetypical form of social organization that can empower\nindividual moral agency by sustaining group disciplinary dynamism, a\nkind of pluralistically organized social life we would now call a\n“civil society” [Kim 2007, 57–94]. \nTo summarize, the irony with which Weber accounted for rationalization\nwas driven by the deepening tension between modernity and\nmodernization. Weber’s problem with modernity\noriginates from the fact that it required a historically unique\nconstellation of cultural values and social institutions, and yet,\nmodernization has effectively undermined the cultural basis for modern\nindividualism and its germinating ground of disciplinary society,\nwhich together had given the original impetus to modernity. The modern\nproject has fallen victim to its own success, and in peril is the\nindividual moral agency and freedom. Under the late modern\ncircumstances characterized by the “iron cage” and\n“warring deities,” then, Weber’s question becomes:\n“How is it at all possible to salvage any remnants of\n‘individual’ freedom of movement in any sense\ngiven this all-powerful trend” [Weber 1918/1994, 159]? \nSuch an appreciation of Weber’s main problematic, which\nculminates in the question of modern individual freedom, may help shed\nlight on some of the controversial aspects of Weber’s\nmethodology. In accounting for his methodological claims, it needs to\nbe borne in mind that Weber was not at all interested in writing a\nsystematic epistemological treatise in order to put an end to the\n“strife over methods” (Methodenstreit) of his\ntime between historicism and positivism. His ambition was much more\nmodest and pragmatic. Just as “the person who attempted to walk\nby constantly applying anatomical knowledge would be in danger of\nstumbling” [Weber 1906/1949, 115; translation altered], so can\nmethodology be a kind of knowledge that may supply a rule of thumb,\ncodified a posteriori, for what historians and social\nscientists do, but it could never substitute for the skills they use\nin their research practice. Instead, Weber’s attempt to mediate\nhistoricism and positivism was meant to aid an actual researcher make\na practical value-judgment that is fair and acceptable in the face of\nthe plethora of subjective values that one encounters when selecting\nand processing historical data. After all, the questions that drove\nhis methodological reflections were what it means to practice science\nin the modern polytheistic world and how one can do science with a\nsense of vocation. In his own words, “the capacity to\ndistinguish between empirical knowledge and value-judgments, and the\nfulfillment of the scientific duty to see the factual truth as well as\nthe practical duty to stand up for our own ideals constitute the\nprogram to which we wish to adhere with ever increasing\nfirmness” [Weber 1904/1949, 58]. Sheldon Wolin thus concludes\nthat Weber “formulated the idea of methodology to serve, not\nsimply as a guide to investigation but as a moral practice and a mode\nof political action” [Wolin 1981, 414]. In short, Weber’s\nmethodology was as ethical as it was epistemological. \nBuilding on the Neo-Kantian nominalism outlined above [2.1], thus,\nWeber’s contribution to methodology turned mostly on the\nquestion of objectivity and the role of subjective values in\nhistorical and cultural concept formation. On the one hand, he\nfollowed Windelband in positing that historical and cultural knowledge\nis categorically distinct from natural scientific knowledge. Action\nthat is the subject of any social scientific inquiry is clearly\ndifferent from mere behaviour. While behaviour can be accounted for\nwithout reference to inner motives and thus can be reduced to mere\naggregate numbers, making it possible to establish positivistic\nregularities, and even laws, of collective behaviour, an action can\nonly be interpreted because it is based on a radically subjective\nattribution of meaning and values to what one does. What a social\nscientist seeks to understand is this subjective dimension of human\nconduct as it relates to others. On the other hand, an\nunderstanding(Verstehen) in this subjective sense is not\nanchored in a non-cognitive empathy or intuitive appreciation that is\narational by nature; it can gain objective validity when the meanings\nand values to be comprehended are explained causally, that is, as a\nmeans to an end. A teleological contextualization of an action in the\nmeans-end nexus is indeed the precondition for a causal explanation\nthat can be objectively ascertained. So far, Weber is not essentially\nin disagreement with Rickert. \nFrom Weber’s perspective, however, the problem that\nRickert’s formulation raised was the objectivity of the end to\nwhich an action is held to be oriented. As pointed out, Rickert in the\nend had to rely on a certain transhistorical, transcultural criterion\nin order to account for the purpose of an action, an assumption that\ncannot be warranted in Weber’s view. To be consistent with the\nNeo-Kantian presuppositions, instead, the ends themselves have to be\nconceived of as no less subjective. Imputing an end to an action is of\na fictional nature in the sense that it is not free from the\nsubjective value-judgment that conditions the researcher’s\nthematization of a certain subject matter out of “an infinite\nmultiplicity of successively and coexistently emerging and\ndisappearing events” [Weber 1904/1949, 72]. Although a\ncounterfactual analysis might aid in stabilizing the process of causal\nimputation, it cannot do away completely with the subjective nature of\nthe researcher’s perspective. \nIn the end, the kind of objective knowledge that historical and\ncultural sciences may achieve is precariously limited. An action can\nbe interpreted with objective validity only at the level of means, not\nends. An end, however, even a “self-evident” one, is\nirreducibly subjective, thus defying an objective understanding; it\ncan only be reconstructed conceptually based on a researcher’s\nno less subjective values. Objectivity in historical and social\nsciences is, then, not a goal that can be reached with the aid of a\ncorrect method, but an ideal that must be striven for without a\npromise of ultimate fulfillment. In this sense, one might say that the\nso-called “value-freedom” (Wertfreiheit) is as\nmuch a methodological principle for Weber as an ethical virtue that a\npersonality fit for modern science must possess. \nThe methodology of “ideal type” (Idealtypus) is\nanother testimony to such a broadly ethical intention of Weber.\nAccording to Weber’s definition, “an ideal type is formed\nby the one-sided accentuation of one or more points of\nview” according to which “concrete individual\nphenomena … are arranged into a unified analytical\nconstruct” (Gedankenbild); in its purely fictional\nnature, it is a methodological “utopia [that] cannot be found\nempirically anywhere in reality” [Weber 1904/1949, 90]. Keenly\naware of its fictional nature, the ideal type never seeks to claim its\nvalidity in terms of a reproduction of or a correspondence with\nreality. Its validity can be ascertained only in terms of adequacy,\nwhich is too conveniently ignored by the proponents of positivism.\nThis does not mean, however, that objectivity, limited as it is, can\nbe gained by “weighing the various evaluations against one\nanother and making a ‘statesman-like’ compromise among\nthem” [Weber 1917/1949, 10], which is often proposed as a\nsolution by those sharing Weber’s kind of methodological\nperspectivism. Such a practice, which Weber calls\n“syncretism,” is not only impossible but also unethical,\nfor it avoids “the practical duty to stand up for our own\nideals” [Weber 1904/1949, 58]. \nAccording to Weber, a clear value commitment, no matter how\nsubjective, is both unavoidable and necessary. It is\nunavoidable, for otherwise no meaningful knowledge can be\nattained. Further, it is necessary, for otherwise the value\nposition of a researcher would not be foregrounded clearly and\nadmitted as such — not only to the readers of the research\noutcome but also to the very researcher him/herself. In other words,\nWeber’s emphasis on “one-sidedness”\n(Einseitigkeit) not only affirms the subjective nature of\nscientific knowledge but also demands that the researcher be\nself-consciously subjective. The ideal type is devised for\nthis purpose, for “only as an ideal type” can subjective\nvalue — “that unfortunate child of misery of our\nscience” — “be given an unambiguous meaning”\n[Ibid., 107]. Along with value-freedom, then, what the ideal\ntype methodology entails in ethical terms is, on the one hand, a\ndaring confrontation with the tragically subjective foundation of our\nhistorical and social scientific knowledge and, on the other, a public\nconfession of one’s own subjective value. Weber’s\nmethodology in the end amounts to a call for the heroic\ncharacter-virtue of clear-sightedness and intellectual integrity that\ntogether constitute a genuine person of science — a scientist\nwith a sense of vocation who has a passionate commitment to\none’s own specialized research, yet is utterly “free of\nillusions” [Löwith 1982, 38]. \nEven more explicitly ethical than was his methodology, Weber’s\npolitical project also discloses his entrenched preoccupation with the\nwillful resuscitation of certain character traits in modern society.\nAt the outset, it seems undeniable that Weber was a deeply liberal\npolitical thinker especially in a German context that is not well\nknown for liberalism. This means that his ultimate value as a\npolitical thinker was locked on individual freedom, that “old,\ngeneral type of human ideals” [Weber 1895/1994, 19]. He was also\na bourgeois liberal, and self-consciously so, in a time of\ngreat transformations that were undermining the social conditions\nnecessary to support classical liberal values and bourgeois\ninstitutions, thereby compelling liberalism to search for a\nfundamental reorientation. To that extent, he belongs to that\ngeneration of liberal political thinkers in fin-de-siècle\nEurope who clearly perceived the general crisis of liberalism and\nsought to resolve it in their own liberal ways [Bellamy 1992,\n157–216]. Weber’s own way was to address the problem of\nclassical liberal characterology that was, in his view, being\nprogressively undermined by the indiscriminate bureaucratization of\nmodern society. \nSuch a concern with ethical character is clearly discernible in\nWeber’s stark political realism that permeates his political\nsociology. For instance, utterly devoid of any moral qualities that\nmany of his contemporaries attributed to the state, it is defined all\ntoo thinly as “a human community that (successfully) claims the\nmonopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a\ngiven territory” [Weber 1919/1994, 310]. With the same sobriety\nor brevity, he asserted that, even in a democratic state, domination\nof the ruled by the ruler(s) is simply an inescapable political\nreality. That is why, for Weber, a study of the political, even a\nvalue-free, empirical sociology, cannot but be an inquiry into the\ndifferent modalities by which a domination is effectuated and\nsustained. For sure, Weber also maintained that a domination worthy of\nscholarly attention – or, literally, “lordship”\n(Herrschaft) – is about something much more than the\nbrute factuality of subjugation and subservience. For “the\nmerely external fact of the order being obeyed is not sufficient to\nsignify domination in our sense; we cannot overlook the meaning of the\nfact that the command is accepted as a valid norm”\n[Weber 1921–22/1978, 946]. In other words, it has to be a\ndomination mediated through mutual interpretation, in which\nthe rulers claim legitimacy and the ruled acquiesce to it\nvoluntarily. \nFrom this allegedly realistic premise, Weber famously moved on to\nidentify three ideal types of legitimate domination based on,\nrespectively, charisma, tradition, and legal rationality. Roughly, the\nfirst type of legitimacy claim depends on how persuasively the leaders\nprove their charismatic qualities, for which they receive personal\ndevotions and emotive followings from the ruled. The second kind of\nclaim can be made successfully when certain practice, custom, and\nmores are institutionalized to (re)produce a stable pattern of\ndomination over a long duration of time. In sharp contrast to these\ncrucial dependences on personality traits and the passage of time, the\nthird type of authority is unfettered by time, place, and other forms\nof contingency as it derives its legitimacy from adherence to\nimpersonal rules and universal principles that can only be found by\nsuitable legal-rational reasoning. Weber’s fame and influence as\na political thinker are built most critically upon this typology and\nthe ways in which those ideal types are deployed in his political\nsociology – or, more literally, sociology of domination\n(Herrschaftssoziologie). \nAs such, it should be clear from the outset that these ideal types are\nnot to be taken as supplying normative grounds for passing judgments\non legitimacy claims. After all, these are political-sociological\ncategories rather than full-blown political-philosophical concepts. Be\nthat as it may, Weber’s political sociology has been accused\nvariously of its embedded normative biases. Read in juxtaposition to\nhis voluminous political writings, it is criticized to this day as\nharbouring or foreshadowing, among others, Bonapartist caesarism,\npassive-revolutionary Fordist ideology, quasi-Fascist elitism, and\neven proto-Nazism (especially with respect to his robust nationalism\nand/or nihilistic celebration of power) [inter alia, Strauss\n1950; Marcuse in Stammer (ed.) 1971; Mommsen 1984; Rehman 2013]. In\naddition to these politically heated charges, Weber’s typology\nalso reveals a crucial lacuna even as an empirical political\nsociology. That is to say, it allows scant, or ambiguous, a conceptual\ntopos for democracy. \nIn fact, it seems as though Weber is unsure of the proper place of\ndemocracy in his schema. At one point, democracy is deemed as a\nfourth type of legitimacy because it should be able to\nembrace legitimacy from below whereas his three ideal types\nall focus on that from above [Breuer in Schroeder (ed.) 1998,\n2]. At other times, Weber seems to believe that democracy is simply\nnon-legitimate, rather than another type of legitimate\ndomination, because it aspires to an identity between the ruler and\nthe ruled (i.e., no domination at all), but without assuming a\nhierarchical and asymmetrical relationship of power, his concept of\nlegitimacy takes hardly off the ground. Thus, Weber could describe the\nemergence of proto-democracy in the late medieval urban communes only\nin terms of “revolutionary usurpation” [Weber\n1921–22/1978, 1250], calling them the “first\ndeliberately non-legitimate and revolutionary political\nassociation” [ibid., 1302]. Too recalcitrant to fit\ninto his overall schema, in other words, these historical prototypes\nof democracy simply fall outside of his typology of\ndomination as a- or illegitimate. \nOverlapping but still distinguishable is Weber’s yet another way\nof conceptualizing democracy, which had to do with charismatic\nlegitimacy. The best example is the Puritan sect in which authority is\nlegitimated only on the grounds of a consensual order created\nvoluntarily by proven believers possessing their own quantum of\ncharismatic legitimating power. As a result of this political\ncorollary of the Protestant doctrine of universal priesthood, Puritan\nsects could and did “insist upon ‘direct democratic\nadministration’ by the congregation” and thereby do away\nwith the hierarchical distinction between those rulling and those\nruled [ibid., 1208]. In a secularized version of this group\ndynamics, a democratic ballot would become the primary tool by which\npresumed charisma of the individual lay citizenry are aggregated and\ntransmitted to their elected leader who become “the agent and\nhence the servant of his voters, not their chosen master”\n[ibid., 1128]. Rather than an outright non-legitimate or\nfourth type of domination, here, democracy comes across as an\nextremely rare subset of a diffused and institutionalized from of\ncharismatic legitimacy. \nThe irony is unmistakable. It seems as though one of the most\ninfluential political thinkers of the twentieth century cannot come to\nclear terms with its zeitgeist in which democracy, in whatever shape\nand shade, emerged as the only acceptable ground for political\nlegitimacy. Weber’s such awkwardness is nowhere more compelling,\neven alarming, than in his advocacy for “leadership\ndemocracy” (Führerdemokratie) during the\nconstitutional politics of post-WWI Germany. \nIf the genuine self-rule of the people is impossible, according to his\nsomber realism, the only choice is one between leaderless and\nleadership democracy. When advocating a sweeping democratization of\ndefeated Germany, thus, Weber envisioned democracy in Germany as a\npolitical marketplace in which strong charismatic leaders can be\nidentified and elected by winning votes in a free competition, even\nbattle, among themselves. Preserving and enhancing this element of\nstruggle in politics is important since it is only through a dynamic\nelectoral process that national leadership strong enough to control an\notherwise omnipotent bureaucracy can be made. The primary concern for\nWeber in designing democratic institutions has, in other words, less\nto do with the realization of democratic ideals, such as rights,\nequality, justice, or self-rule, than with cultivation of certain\ncharacter traits befitting a robust national leadership. In its\noverriding preoccupation with the leadership qualities, Weber’s\ntheory of democracy contains ominous streaks that may vindicate\nJürgen Habermas’s famous critique that Carl Schmitt,\n“the Kronjurist of the Third Reich,” was “a\nlegitimate pupil of Weber’s” [Habermas in Stammer (ed.),\n1971, 66]. \nFor a fair and comprehensive assessment, however, it should also be\nbrought into the purview that Weber’s leadership democracy is\nnot solely reliant upon the fortuitous personality traits of its\nleaders, let alone a caesaristic dictator. In addition to the free\nelectoral competition led by the organized mass parties, Weber saw\nlocalized, yet public associational life as a breeding ground for the\nformation of charismatic leaders. When leaders are identified and\ntrained at the level of, say neighborhood choral societies and bowling\nclubs [Weber 1910/2002], the alleged authoritarian elitism of\nleadership democracy comes across as more pluralistic in its\nconceptualization, far from its usual identification with demagogic\ndictatorship and unthinking mass following. Insofar as a civil\nsociety, or “sectlike society” in his own parlance [see\n4.3 above], functions as an effective medium for the horizontal\ndiffusion of charismatic qualities among lay people, his notion of\ncharismatic leadership can retain a strongly democratic tone to the\nextent that he also suggested associational pluralism as a\nsociocultural ground for the political education of the lay citizenry\nfrom which genuine leaders would hail. Weber’s charismatic\nleadership has to be “democratically manufactured” [Green\n2008, 208], in short, and such a formative political project is\npredicated upon a pluralistically organized civil society as well as\nuniversal suffrage, free elections, and organized parties. \nWeber’s preoccupation with civic education runs like a thread\nthrough his nationalism as well. There can be no denying that Weber\nwas an ardent nationalist. And yet, his nationalism was unambiguously\nfree from the obsession with primordial ethnicity and race that was\nprevalent in Wilhelmine Germany. Even in the Freiburg Address of 1895,\nwhich unleashed his nationalist zeal with an uninhibited and youthful\nrhetorical force, he makes it clear that the ultimate rationale for\nthe nationalist value-commitment that should guide all political\njudgments, even political and economic sciences as well, has less to\ndo with the promotion of the German national interests per se than\nwith a civic education of the citizenry in general and political\nmaturity of the bourgeois class in particular. At a time when\n“the ultimate, most sublime values have retreated from the\npublic sphere” [Weber 1919/1946, 155], Weber found an\ninstrumental value in nationalism insofar as it can imbue patriotic\nfeelings among the otherwise apathetic citizenry and thereby increase\ntheir participation in public affairs.  \nCrucial to this civic educational project was, according to Weber,\nexposing citizens to the harsh reality of “eternal\nstruggle,” or power-politics (Machtpolitik) among the\nnation-states with which Germany had to engage actively [Weber\n1895/1994, 16]. Weber observed with more than a hint of envy, for\nexample, that it was “the reverberation of a position of world\npower” that exposed the English citizens “to\n‘chronic’ political schooling,” and it was this\npolitical education that made possible both the empire-building\nand liberal democracy [Ibid., 26]. In this sense,\nWeber’s nationalism can be surmised as a variant of liberal\nimperialism, or social imperialism (Sozialimperialismus) as\nit was called in Germany; to that extent, one might say that his\npolitical thinking is not free from the problems of liberalism in\nturn-of-the-century Europe [Beetham 1989, 322]. Be that as it may,\nWeber’s liberal nationalism was still significantly different\nfrom his contemporaries’ in its preoccupation with a liberal\ncharacterology and civic education [Kim 2007, 133–72]. The next\nquestion that Weber’s ethico-political project raises is, then,\nwhat kind of character virtues are necessary for the kind of\nleadership and citizenship that can together make a great nation,\nwhile holding inevitable bureaucratization in check. \nWeber suggested two sets of ethical virtues that a proper political\neducation should cultivate — the ethic of conviction\n(Gesinnungsethik) and the ethic of responsibility\n(Verantwortungsethik). According to the ethic of\nresponsibility, on the one hand, an action is given meaning only as a\ncause of an effect, that is, only in terms of its causal relationship\nto the empirical world. The virtue lies in an objective understanding\nof the possible causal effect of an action and the calculated\nreorientation of the elements of an action in such a way as to achieve\na desired consequence. An ethical question is thereby reduced to a\nquestion of technically correct procedure, and free action consists of\nchoosing the correct means. By emphasizing the causality to which a\nfree agent subscribes, in short, Weber prescribes an ethical integrity\nbetween action and consequences, instead of a Kantian emphasis on that\nbetween action and intention. \nAccording to the ethic of conviction, on the other hand, a free agent\nshould be able to choose autonomously not only the means, but also the\nend; “this concept of personality finds its\n‘essence’ in the constancy of its inner relation to\ncertain ultimate ‘values’ and ‘meanings’ of\nlife” [Weber 1903–06/1975, 192]. In this respect,\nWeber’s problem hinges on the recognition that the kind of\nrationality applied in choosing a means cannot be used in choosing an\nend. These two kinds of reasoning represent categorically distinct\nmodes of rationality, a boundary further reinforced by modern value\nfragmentation. With no objectively ascertainable ground of choice\nprovided, then, a free agent has to create a purpose ex\nnihilo: “ultimately life as a whole, if it is not to be\npermitted to run on as an event in nature but is instead to be\nconsciously guided, is a series of ultimate decisions through which\nthe soul — as in Plato — chooses its own fate”\n[Weber 1917/1949, 18]. This ultimate decision and the Kantian\nintegrity between intention and action constitute the essence of what\nWeber calls an ethic of conviction. \nIt is often held that the gulf between these two types of ethic is\nunbridgeable for Weber. Demanding an unmitigated integrity between\none’s ultimate value and political action, that is to say, the\ndeontological ethic of conviction cannot be reconciled with\nthat of responsibility which is consequentialist in essence.\nIn fact, Weber himself admitted the “abysmal contrast”\nthat separates the two. This frank admission, nevertheless, cannot be\ntaken to mean that he privileged the latter over the former as far as\npolitical education is concerned. \nWeber clearly understood the deep tension between consequentialism and\ndeontology, but he still insisted that they should be forcefully\nbrought together. The former recognition only lends urgency to the\nlatter agenda. Resolving this analytical inconsistency in terms of\ncertain “ethical decrees” did not interest Weber at all.\nInstead, he sought for a moral character that can produce this\n“combination” with a sheer force of will. He called such a\ncharacter a “politician with a sense of vocation”\n(Berufspolitiker) who combines a passionate conviction in\nsupra-mundane ideals that politics has to serve and a sober rational\ncalculation of its realizability in this mundane world. Weber thus\nconcluded: “the ethic of conviction and the ethic of\nresponsibility are not absolute opposites. They are complementary to\none another, and only in combination do they produce the true human\nbeing who is capable of having a ‘vocation for\npolitics’” [Weber 1919/1994, 368]. \nIn the end, Weber’s ethical project is not about formal analysis\nof moral maxims, nor is it about substantive virtues that reflect some\nkind of ontic telos. It is too formal to be an Aristotelean virtue\nethics, and it is too concerned with moral character to be a Kantian\ndeontology narrowly understood. The goal of Weber’s ethical\nproject, rather, aims at cultivating a character who can willfully\nbring together these conflicting formal virtues to create what he\ncalls “total personality”\n(Gesamtpersönlichkeit). It culminates in an ethical\ncharacterology or philosophical anthropology in which passion and\nreason are properly ordered by sheer force of individual volition. In\nthis light, Weber’s political virtue resides not simply in a\nsubjective intensity of value commitment nor in a detached\nintellectual integrity, but in their willful combination in a unified\nsoul. \nSeen this way, we find a remarkable consistency in Weber’s\nthought. Weber’s main problematic turned on the question of\nindividual autonomy and freedom in an increasingly rationalized\nsociety. His dystopian and pessimistic assessment of rationalization\ndrove him to search for solutions through politics and science, which\nbroadly converge on a certain practice of the self. What he\ncalled the “person of vocation,” first outlined famously\nin The Protestant Ethic, provided a bedrock for his various\nefforts to resuscitate a character who can willfully combine\nunflinching conviction and methodical rationality even in a society\nbesieged by bureaucratic petrification and value fragmentation. It is\nalso in this entrenched preoccupation with an ethical characterology\nunder modern circumstances that we find the source of his enduring\ninfluences on twentieth-century political and social thought. \nOn the left, Weber’s articulation of the tension between\nmodernity and modernization found resounding echoes in the\n“Dialectics of Enlightenment” thesis by Theodor Adorno and\nMax Horkheimer; György Lukács’s own critique of the\nperversion of capitalist reason owes no less to Weber’s\nproblematization of instrumental rationality on which is also built\nJürgen Habermas’s elaboration of communicative rationality\nas an alternative. Different elements in Weber’s political\nthought, e.g., intense political struggle as an antidote to modern\nbureaucratic petrification, leadership democracy and plebiscitary\npresidency, uncompromising realism in international politics, and\nvalue-freedom and value-relativism in political ethics, were selected\nand critically appropriated by such diverse thinkers on the right as\nCarl Schmitt, Joseph Schumpeter, Leo Strauss, Hans Morgenthau, and\nRaymond Aron. Even the postmodernist project of deconstructing\nEnlightenment selfhood finds, as Michel Foucault does, a precursor in\nWeber. All in all, across the vastly different ideological and\nmethodological spectrum, Max Weber’s thought will continue to be\na deep reservoir of fresh inspiration as long as an individual’s\nfate under (post)modern circumstances does not lose its privileged\nplace in the political, social, cultural, and philosophical\nself-reflections of our time.","contact.mail":"sunghokim@yonsei.ac.kr","contact.domain":"yonsei.ac.kr"}]
